*PS14C:	But I give them a so then I saw Mrs on Tuesday when I was at Ashington And she came up with all sorts of things that she would like for the the new Wandsbergh development But on a but there 's nothing ready of course so th there 's there 's a giant sundial they 're going to have in one of the courtyards and it 's a giant one it 's it 's the the building and the blocks of things in in the in the courtyard that make up the the time So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the of the courtyard and it 's eight o'clock and that one is nine o'clock and so forth This is just in a courtyard and there 'll be shrubs and things so she 's got .  1391463_1446665
*PS14B:	Hold on Wha how where is it going to be seen from .  1446665_1449385
*PS14C:	I presume it 's seen from the wards that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard There 's also erm a play area for the the children 's ward there 's also some murals on the the walls various artistic murals And of course they 've got this grant from Artcan for six thousand pound for a proggie mat exhibition .  1449745_1475595
*PS14B:	A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat .  1478115_1484785
*PS14C:	Well .  1484785_1485005
*PS14B:	exhibition .  1485615_1485785
*PS14C:	well over over a period it 's and other things too but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it And various other art things But also th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden up But that 's a apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here to the Wandsbergh Hospital But then I thought perhaps if that .  1485785_1517995
*PS14B:	I ca n't see the education committee with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here .  1519225_1524785
*PS14C:	Well they wo n't .  1524785_1525495
*PS14B:	to go Ashington Hospital to do a .  1525505_1526545
*PS14C:	they wo n't so the they they .  1526545_1527385
*PS14B:	garden .  1527805_1527985
*PS14C:	the the the education committee and the school governors have no money at all .  1527985_1531285

*PS14C:	to pay for that .  1532145_1532445
*PS14B:	I would expect .  1532445_1532655
*PS14C:	But then .  1532825_1533565
*PS14B:	that 's a very low priority .  1533565_1534775
*PS14C:	well it is n't even a priority it is nothing They wo n't get the money Th they wo n't pay for them to go swimming .  1534775_1539805
*PS14B:	Well I do n't .  1539985_1540545
*PS14C:	they 've got ta walk to go swimming But I thought that now that the M S has acquired that bus and it 's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time and it 's a twenty nine seater bus I mean the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in but in between times it 's twenty seats you see .  1540555_1565735
*PS14B:	And then you 'll need a P S V .  1565735_1567505
*PS14C:	Well .  1567505_1567655
*PS14B:	licence .  1567655_1567905
*PS14C:	but but that 's that 's that 's easily remedied if you could get a er a driving licence holder to take them oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents or somebody who could take the children er periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing So that was a possibility But I have n't seen Miss about all these sort of things But I did also say to Mrs that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September that it might be better to discuss it with them after I 've discussed with Miss .  1567905_1602543
*PS14B:	I only know one person I only know one bus driver with children .  1602543_1612206

*PS14C:	To sixteen .  1631276_1631546
*PS14B:	you 're not reducing the size of the bus .  1631546_1633606
*PS14C:	Well I think that 's crazy .  1633666_1634536
*PS14B:	And someone who 's been just used to driving a car are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra .  1634536_1641926
*PS14C:	Well .  1641926_1642106
*PS14B:	tuition .  1642106_1642276

*PS14B:	I know .  1651046_1651836
*PS14C:	which only takes four wheelchairs and of course there 's the drivers of of the minibus things that bring them I think I I would query that anyway that just .  1651836_1662906
*PS14B:	Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition .  1662906_1666516

*PS14B:	it .  1668156_1668316
*PS14C:	but I query as well whether just because you reduce the number of spa passengers in it that you you you do n't need a P S V licence or the equivalent is n't a P S V licence but it 's it 's .  1668316_1681726
*PS14B:	Oh you do the they 've looked into that .  1681996_1682836
*PS14C:	But it sounds doubtful to me But anyway there 's the insurance point of view But anyway any I mean that 's the easy and I mean if if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving before they take passengers out I mean I did n't drive the minibus until I 'd driven it without passengers .  1683156_1703096
*PS14B:	Yeah .  1703096_1703646
