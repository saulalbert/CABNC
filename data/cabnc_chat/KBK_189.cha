*CHR:	Happy with it all? •132631_132698•
*CHR:	I don't know but to be truthful I am not hundred percent sold on any of it. •132945_134409•
*LYN:	Oh I'm sorry about that. •134409_134655•
        Because I like them all. •134655_134850•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	That's correct. •134871_135112•
*CHR:	May I look at that please? •135140_135595•
*CHR:	With the pads in I feel square on the top. •135595_136011•
        If I could take them out. •136174_136492•
*LYN:	Just a moment, may I? •136512_136662•
        They don't look harsh. •136684_136835•
*CHR:	To me they are too wide. •136835_136961•
*LYN:	Alright to me they don't look harsh. •136961_137096•
        You know they don't sort of poke up in the air like shoulders sometimes do. •137106_137410•
