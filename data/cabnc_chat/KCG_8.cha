*JAN:	Mm, is that normally how it is from Fridays?
*LYN:	No it's normally from Saturday morning till Sunday morning    (.)  (        ) I just think we'll end up going for the day   ((clears throat)) but he said, he's got Gerry coming up from Hull to mind the shop   (.) on Saturday, he said oh you're tired and you need a change and a rest   (.) he said something like erm
*JAN:	Do you think he'll stay over Saturday night?

*JAN:	Oh right, oh can't you take her, oh no you can't really can you?
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	You can't   (.) right  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	and you don't know what to do
*LYN:	I tried to
*JAN:	for the best
*LYN:	Well I do know what I want to do, but   (.) it's knocked me for six cos I sort of felt really guilty
*JAN:	Mm 
*LYN:	sort of you can't kick them while they're down and
*JAN:	Yeah, but you do it, it were a good time though.
*LYN:	Mm  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	 (        ) heard something on the radio, he said, oh will you still love me in a year's time, so I looked   (        ) That's how I am, horrible to him really   (.) it's worse than being married.
*JAN:	So when're you gonna tell him, when're you gonna do it   (        ) take the bull by the horns? (.) 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	Yeah I can still see you   (        ) in flaming two year's time simply because you're too frightened to say anything to him, to my son.
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	 (        ) hello   (.) you don't give yourself time to wake up before you start moaning
*LYN:	Say not her again   ((laugh)) oh look, he's such a cutey
*JAN:	Urgh
*LYN:	hello
*JAN:	got a bit warm under there
*LYN:	I was gonna say he's got rosy cheeks
*JAN:	I know, it's alright when the sun's out, but when the sun goes in it's freezing so I've had his plastic  (        ) 
*LYN:	Mm
*JAN:	he was a little git last night.
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	Well no just screaming at the top of his voice, our Ben had to bring him down in the end and give him a drink and start again, even then I had to stay with him until he went to sleep
*LYN:	Ah  (.) 
*JAN:	this all started after last weekend   (.) Deana put him to bed didn't she?Instead of letting John's mum do it, consequently he got dead upset so 
*LYN:	Oh 
*JAN:	so he was dead annoyed with it, all week I've been struggling to get him to bed  (.) 
*LYN:	 ((clears throat)) 
*JAN:	he, he was a treat before, just used to take him up, give him a cuddle, say night-night and that was it
*LYN:	So why did it disturb him with Deana?Is it just
*JAN:	Well I just 
*LYN:	it's not like an adult?
*JAN:	Yeah I suppose so, yeah 
*LYN:	It seems, it's comforting is it?It's the same routine
*JAN:	Yeah, of course you can't sort of cuddle him like that cos he's too heavy, I rock him you know for a, a couple of minutes, not that long, he's taken his braces off as well still do, don't ya?Mm
*LYN:	Ah look at them  (.) 
*JAN:	there, I don't know, I don't know what you're gonna do, cos whatever it is you're not doing it, it's just letting time go by aren't ya, treading water if you like.
*LYN:	Last night I got really upset, I did in bed and erm   (.) he kept saying what's the matter?What's the matter?And you have
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	and everything, yeah
*JAN:	Mm
*LYN:	but he'd just told me about the housing   (        ) with the car and everything.
*JAN:	Is it, is he, is that right, is somebody coming down to value the house?
*LYN:	No, just coming back home to show me the flaming car, and that's what sa I didn't   (        ) but I feel dead awful really, but I didn't jump up and down
*JAN:	I'm not surprised, I'd have done me fruit, if I was going around with somebody that, that say they're gonna put the house on the market for me, want to make a go, a go of the marriage, a new baby, two other kids and then oh, but yet, yet wants to play around in a, you know a little sports car, that nobody but two people can sit in
*LYN:	I know
*JAN:	I can't 
*LYN:	that's the weekend only and there's me  (        ) 
*JAN:	Well he's got so many debts Lynn it just doesn't seem right he's, he's living in cuckoo land, I mean when are you ever gonna feel secure with somebody like that?
*LYN:	Never
*JAN:	You can't can ya? (.) 
*LYN:	Is there any more tea in the pot Jane at all?
*JAN:	Yeah there might be  (.) 
*LYN:	Well thanks that was beautiful tea, (        ) sort of ready for it
*JAN:	I'm not surprised with all that dashing around, he asks such a lot of you Lynn and I can't understand why he's like that when he says he loves you and everything, and he wants
*LYN:	I know   (        ) I don't know why I'm being so bloody docile no I really have and then 
*JAN:	I don't know he's gonna come a right bloody cropper
*LYN:	I keep burning  (        ) , I bet I didn't, I thought, pardon me, positive   (.) mm I popped round, I went in yesterday   (        ) I'm going to say something   (        ) and then he's going on about well I've sold me car to pay the mortgage and
*JAN:	And then all he tells you is a pack of bloody lies 
*LYN:	I know 
*JAN:	if he can lie that bloody easily
*LYN:	well he, he said he, he wanted it as a surprise well it's not a surprise for me is it?
*JAN:	Yeah, but he knew you wasn't 
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	you wasn't keen on the idea anyway didn't he?
*LYN:	Well that's right, yeah, cos then he asked me ages ago did I think he was being selfish, I said yes
*JAN:	Mm
*LYN:	I said, but like you tell me it's your life, mm 
*JAN:	he's like a Jekyll and Hyde that bloke, I've told you before you wanna be bloody careful how it works out  (.) 
*LYN:	and then he said to me how, how do you feel about your baby now?Not, you know, and I said okay?
*JAN:	It's going to be his baby when it's a good baby
*LYN:	I know 
*JAN:	but your baby when anything comes to actually buying for it and er looking after it I would imagine, I can't see him doing all what he says he's gonna do with it Lynn
*LYN:	No
*JAN:	Oi you, he's playing with your
*LYN:	Oh let's have a, is it in there?
*JAN:	 (        ) no   (.) right, we'll have another cup of tea and then we'll have that nice cake
*LYN:	Right   (.) look at you, eating all your crisps   (.) look it's going to rain
*JAN:	I'm gonna go and bring my pushchair in then before it does, are you taking that with ya?Or just   (        ) 
*LYN:	Yeah, I'm going to, I'm just working out
*JAN:	I'll be back in a tick
*LYN:	mm, mm  (.) 
*JAN:	So you've still got your other   (        ) have ya that Alice had?
*LYN:	Mm, well it's at erm Carl's and
*JAN:	Yeah   (.) but you could use it like when   (        ) 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	mind you, you might be pleased with it when it's  (        ) 
*LYN:	Mm, I'm damn sure I will, I quite like doing things like that
*JAN:	Yeah
*LYN:	very   ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	but they remember which one    (        )  (.) I did, I think it was that Mothercare one   (.) they get grubby with the things and everything and it was a sunny day and I went outside with me bucket and me felt and me scrubbing brush
*JAN:	Yeah
*LYN:	and I just, I threw buckets of water on it to rinse it, and it dried because it was really warm and it came up like new 
*JAN:	Came up like new 
*LYN:	cos you can have a real good go at the wheels that way outside 
*JAN:	Yeah, outside, it's like my pram, I mean, I was, Stacey was going in hospital last year to have her adeno adenoids out and Sue was having him and I thought well, he was too big for his carrycot, but take the pram down and he's got nothing to sleep in   (.) and er, I put him in it, it been six months since it was do well since he started using it, so I give that a good going over and the pram wheels come up lovely
*LYN:	I know
*JAN:	you know I get a Brillo
*LYN:	Yeah 
*JAN:	and some Jif on it, but erm, it's not been done since, so when the next good bit of weather, I've got to get the pushchair out and give that a good going over 
*LYN:	And do that 
*JAN:	and me pram as well 
*LYN:	I know, I fancied a big pram, but there you go  (.) 
*JAN:	Well it's, whether you've really got somewhere to put it really that's the top and bottom of it 
*LYN:	Well there's nowhere to walk to now, is there, you know   (        ) 
*JAN:	Well where would you, mind you I suppose like in the olden days you could only get big prams, they just had them in the living room didn't they?
*LYN:	Yeah, well it'd just have to go in the hall, but, no, this will be better, carrycot and   (.) that, (        ) ridiculous prices though
*JAN:	Well it is, it's different if you was, if you was starting from scratch I suppose   (.) you know, first baby you're inclined to, you want everything new don't you with these new  (.) 
*LYN:	Well I sort of said to him as well about, I said and it's ridiculous, just because I said the bedding had been lo in the loft
*JAN:	Mm
*LYN:	with the cot and everything he, he sort of er   (.) thought it was 
*JAN:	Well some lofts are lovely aren't they?I mean our loft is a right mess 
*LYN:	grotty I mean they're all in bin bags
*JAN:	Mm
*LYN:	they only need washing  (        ) , I mean I might be wrong, they might have, they might have gone funny, but I doubt it   (.) they've not been up there that long really only about two 
*JAN:	Oh all of my stuff has been up in the loft   (.) it's like you say, I mean if they've been double wrapped and everything and you wash them
*LYN:	 (        ) he should put his hand in his pocket really and buy something
*JAN:	Of course he should, you ought to just ask him for say a hundred, you know to buy a couple of packs of nappies and some cream and changing mat, a changing bag, you'll want all that won't you?
*LYN:	I know a changing bag could cost sixteen 
*JAN:	Fifteen sixteen pounds and then you've got another six or seven pound for a changing mat   (.) you wanna say to him, that you know, can I have er, some money, I want to start getting us a few things together, but you, I mean, what about clothes?
*LYN:	I know, he, he said er, he said about, plus when I mentioned the pushchair and the carrycot he said oh well  (        ) , so I said yeah 
*JAN:	Yeah 
*LYN:	I said that development, I said, (        ) with the bargain coming up with a
*JAN:	He alright?
*LYN:	Yeah he's alright there   (.) oh I just  ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	Ooh, you've made a right mess with them crisps young man, ain't ya?The thing is Lynn you've got to start early  (.) 
*LYN:	Well
*JAN:	it's all part of the, of the process of getting ready for it though int it?
*LYN:	Yeah
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	where've you got these from?
*LYN:	Er the deli, you know in the village
*JAN:	Oh they should be nice then
*LYN:	you might need a, get a fork to eat it with, you don't mind, you might need a fork because 
*JAN:	Oh right are these of, what did you have, is that what you had before one of these with the bits of carrot on 
*LYN:	Yeah, but you might, I can't remember whether you really liked it and I thought oh
*JAN:	Oh I did yeah.So it was the deli not that other place, because there's er, a, a little cake shop int there in the village?
*LYN:	Near where, next to 
*JAN:	I know where
*LYN:	where the new florist is?
*JAN:	Yeah, I know where the erm the delicatessen is, so you got them from there and not the other shop, cos

*LYN:	it's opposite erm, yeah not Parker Radburn 
*JAN:	what about Lingraves do they erm?
*LYN:	No they've gone, it's a florist now
*JAN:	Oh really, I only went in there the other day, well the other week about a fortnight ago 
*LYN:	I know cos I know when, when I got these   (        ) when I came, about two weeks ago
*JAN:	Ah
*LYN:	they were in, I know they've been there years
*JAN:	 ((clears throat)) You know what's done it, I suppose Parker and Radburn going in there 
*LYN:	Mm 
*JAN:	and they just about managed didn't they with the  (        ) ?
*LYN:	cos they sell different sort of  (        ) 
*JAN:	Mm, me and John had a, er one from the Spinces the other day very nice 
*LYN:	What, yeah they're oblong aren't they?
*JAN:	Yeah   (.) you can have my, would you like my carrot?You can take it off 
*LYN:	Er will, will Michael like it?
*JAN:	No it's marzipan int it?
*LYN:	Yeah   (.) right, erm thank you very much
*JAN:	You like marzipan do you?
*LYN:	Mm
*JAN:	Yuck, yuck, I like almonds and everything but
*LYN:	You just don't like
*JAN:	I just don't like marzipan, I think it was something that to do when I was a kid to be honest
*LYN:	They do another sort and that's really nice, it's called a nutty Vera
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	and it looks like this but it's a similar texture, but it's a different taste, it's got walnuts on the, bit on the top
*JAN:	Oh
*LYN:	and what it is, the man that bakes them, it's a   (        ) that makes his
*JAN:	Mm
*LYN:	and he's related to   (.) Vera Duckworth out of Coronation Street cos it's   (        ) 
*JAN:	Oh it's because 
*LYN:	something like that
*JAN:	Oh
*LYN:	so he's done one after her, a nutty Vera.
*JAN:	I bet that's nice
*LYN:	That's what she said anyway
*JAN:	with nuts on instead of erm
*LYN:	Yeah   (.) d'ya know I could drink and drink and drink    (        )  (.) you know there only   (        ) you get all the fingers caught, it's like with an ironing board int it?
*JAN:	Oh God, yeah 
*LYN:	It's like looking at another planet to a man
*JAN:	that's right   (.) what's that?Is that marzipan?
*LYN:	That is isn't it? (.) 
*JAN:	Yes it is, I'll have to dig that  (        ) 
*LYN:	Ah
*JAN:	and it's everything just to stop you getting at    (        )  (.) what, well get it then   (.) yeah, I've, I don't mind some of it, I've not had a bit of marzipan for   (.) I don't mind these erm almond slices, I quite like them, but I think it must be the texture of the marzipan
*LYN:	Mm, I love it, they do erm, German erm marzipan bar, chocolate bar
*JAN:	Oh aye
*LYN:	have you ever made marzipan?
*JAN:	No
*LYN:	I did it in the sixth form, it's really hard, it takes ages
*JAN:	Does it?
*LYN:	That's why I would think, it's ground almonds they're expensive
*JAN:	That's right, yeah
*LYN:	it, and it doesn't taste anything like, I mean this'll be probably be home, nearest to homemade, but that 
*JAN:	Mm 
*LYN:	bright yellow stuff it doesn't taste like that at all 
*JAN:	No
*LYN:	it's, sort of very more of 
*JAN:	Here 
*LYN:	a subtle taste, you know it   (        ) need loads of ground almonds
*JAN:	Mm
*LYN:	just to make a small   (.) oh  (.) 
*JAN:	That come off rather easily, would you like my marzipan?
*LYN:	Hmm, well leave it there and I'll see how I go, cos I've had one carrot and I, sort of like, I had your carrot and I'm putting mine    (        )  (.) quite rich though that's the thing, I quite like that bit there cos that's like brown sugar   (.) erm
*JAN:	It's lovely
*LYN:	Carl started me on this, he was into carrot cake for years and
*JAN:	Yeah?
*LYN:	mm   (.) and it's similar to a cake we used to have when he used to love erm   (        ) when we were engaged he introduced  (        ) 
*JAN:	That's another name for it int it apparently 
*LYN:	Oh is it oh it was the same, but it was taller, and that sort of buttery cream that was all on top and that had nuts and things 
*JAN:	Mm 
*LYN:	rather than 
*JAN:	we had, I told you, at this meal we went to, on Saturday they had erm carrot cake, but that was completely covered in like this cream cheese
*LYN:	Mm sounds nice, mm 
*JAN:	it was gorgeous but Chris was saying that Tescos do one, but they call it passion cake which is the same thing 
*LYN:	Oh the same, mm  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	like a horse today, drinking
*JAN:	Have you got a sore throat or something or just thirsty?
*LYN:	I don't know   (        ) catarrh but er    (        )  (.) I've been thirsty the last few days  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	I remember we used to just fancy  (        ) 
*JAN:	Mm
*LYN:	 (        ) go and buy one and dash in with a cup of tea and he   ((laugh)) I hoped no one called and no one 
*JAN:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	it's more satisfying when you're desperate for something and you get home 
*JAN:	Mm 
*LYN:	and   (        ) gulp it down
*JAN:	 ((laugh))  (.) You're getting in a mess Michael    (.)  (        ) do it now, have you ever tried, bought, what, you can buy it in a slab can't you, but without the cream on
*LYN:	No I've not seen it
*JAN:	like   (        ) can buy it the, just carrot cake 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	no, no, I've only just got onto  (        ) 
*LYN:	Oh
*GRO:	 (        )  (.) 
*JAN:	There, I'm not too keen on the creamy soft piece
*LYN:	Mm, I like that  (.) 
*JAN:	You're a mess, mm
*LYN:	 (        ) oh that's not too bad, you know
*JAN:	What were ya?
*LYN:	One thirty over eighty
*JAN:	How much weight have you put on?
*LYN:	Well she weighed me with me boots, er everything on and on their scales it was nine stone eight.
