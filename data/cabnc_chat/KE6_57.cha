@Comment:	conversation #58 (Tape 037801)
*WEN:	Went to bed and er of course the kid went berserk didn't he?And er god you should of heard him, god if it ain't Ross all over again, mummy, mummy and she left him there, as I said when they first came he was in the far bedroom, well now I suppose with all these people she's rearranged it indoors and he's in the one next to our house, and she's shouting at him and er it went on how, I can't tell you how long, I mean, Bev and I was talking through bedrooms you know
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	and er, it was gone eleven I would of thought, anyway he stopped and I slept like a log, got up at twenty past six, but erm, it's a strange thing because one of those came last evening and it parked outside George's, now I said yesterday, when Alan goes to work, it's not long after six normally to go up to London and that
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	and I said to both of them, I just don't know how he got past that second car in the road right, come out of his drive, I couldn't believe that he could of done it, but he did, because he went you know 
*SAN:	Yeah 
*WEN:	anyway last night, they parked outside George's so I reckon, I mean it's only us thinking he's put a note in the door because he will do this, because when a bloke used to leave his car outside Alan's gate, others, instead of the station
*SAN:	Yeah
*WEN:	Alan left a note on his windscreen
*SAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	but er, I don't know how he got out yesterday and I've never, never know him parked down the road, not at all, anyway we got, I got home and erm, I said to Bev you know, right go and phone Lesley see if she's in and then I did a bit of housework and then the phone rang, ooh, we was aiming to go out at one and that must of been ten to one, and it was Liz
*SAN:	Oh yeah
*WEN:	and er I said to Bev well you do what you like, you know, she went out, the first time she's answered the phone, since
*SAN:	Yeah
*WEN:	Anyway er Liz said can you come over like today so Bev said yes what does it entail?Liz got quite cross you know she's quite oh bugger it, you know, and er she said to Liz what's the hours?Oh I dunno you'll have to talk to Ian, she said I've been working Les done, er Les, Les told me eleven till three, it was half past eleven till three and er, so Bev was alright 
*SAN:	That's exactly what we do
*WEN:	Yes, well Bev was asking, I mean I was doing housework, oh, I was doing bits and pieces you know, and er getting me coat and all that and er   (.) she was asking questions and all that and Liz said I'll pick you up at twenty past eleven, so Bev said alright then, so she come off the phone said she'd go and have a look and apparently erm, it must of been yesterday if, if Liz is telling the truth she said to whoever are you going to do anything about this?And he said oh yeah, so, I said to Bev well, they had the feeling it was haphazard or whatever the word be, anyway
*SAN:	So she's going over about it 
*WEN:	she's going over at half past eleven and she said to me if it's not worth the money I'm not changing and er, I shall tell him that I've certainly got to go on the books you know 
*SAN:	Mm 
*WEN:	can't do it any other way, so I said oh I'll go and have a look, I've got to go down town and
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	that's right
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	that's right, I mean she's, she's took some money, or taken some money if, I mean she'll be home twelve o'clock if it don't suit her like
*SAN:	Yeah
*WEN:	she'll only get a taxi, if er, she thinks it not viable, but er, it, it to me, it just seems not buggering about, but
*SAN:	I mean there are some places like that and
*WEN:	There are
*SAN:	people are quite happy to work there
*WEN:	Mm
*SAN:	and the pay is
*WEN:	Mm
*SAN:	pretty okay
*WEN:	Yeah, well I mean I don't know what she's been earning this Liz, but

*WEN:	That's that woman who looks after Dee Dee's sister
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	does that and all, and er   (.) she had a da , she went to the authorities about that woman
*SAN:	Yeah, did she get anywhere?
*WEN:	Well I don't know, but she, I said, cos she's telling me about her coming, only three days up the hospital then she's gotta go back to her own place because Ian said she'd never managed, she keeps falling and she said this woman never went to see her once when she was in hospital, yet she's getting paid it look all the time, and she ought to go to see if there's anything she wants you see
*SAN:	Yeah
*WEN:	and er, I said, morning, I said er

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	eh?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	but er, as I say I can't remember precisely, I just scanned it and give it to Mick who was out the door like, Lesley put her house up for a hundred and twenty six   (.) erm, one   (.) how much is it?

*DOR:	But she still hasn't had any body in to see it
*WEN:	No but it is a strange thing because sometimes you get my end of the market and you get somebody wants her end of the market, but erm

*WEN:	Yeah
*SAN:	they're gonna go for the best there is

*SAN:	and they're gonna go out of town detached 
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah
*SAN:	as much as they can get

*WEN:	and er, she's got two more raises at school, they'll give him a credit and then wrote him a letter saying that he'll probably be expelled again, of course she went busting up there
*SAN:	No wonder you said about the credit
*WEN:	Yeah
*SAN:	Thought he turned over
*WEN:	Yeah
*SAN:	a new leaf 
*WEN:	yeah , well the thing was he Peter gave him a key

*WEN:	she was shouting at him, didn't hear any dogs, and erm, it was gone eleven, must of been
*DOR:	Yeah it was 
*WEN:	before it stopped and then of course I slept like a bloody log until about twenty past seven

*WEN:	yeah  (.) 
*DOR:	I don't have to come out until seven

*DOR:	near, well not quite seven so I mean I don't have to do a lot but I just liked to er take my time and you know 
*WEN:	Well I, I did nothing , I did nothing you see because erm, by the time I'd been in the bathroom done the sandwiches
*DOR:	Yeah
*WEN:	blah, blah, got myself a cup of tea, blah, blah, blah, got on me coat
*DOR:	Mm

*DOR:	But did she, did a 
*WEN:	time for him Doreen

*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	but she said, well the last lot that I've got
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	but one of the times when we were not chatty, but talked, she said how naughty he'd got, but I mean she's never with him
*DOR:	Well, cos I mean if he goes to school now and he didn't, he picked up things and then
*WEN:	Well I, I
*DOR:	he's not got 
*WEN:	he's, he's 
*DOR:	time for and well that is it innit, well if she's not got time for him

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	a day off didn't he?

*WEN:	Anyway I'm hopeful that he'll be in today, because I mean the noise won't stop, so I mean when I report it, it just goes on
*DOR:	Mm, mm
*WEN:	it just goes on, but I said to Sandra where they've been parking all these cars, Alan over the road he comes out just after six o'clock and goes to London every day and I don't know how he got his car out with the 
*DOR:	No 
*WEN:	but he did, anyway last night when these, this car arrived, they parked it down the road outside George's, well I've never known that and I reckon Alan's put a note through the door

*WEN:	I don't know how he got out, I mean our road is so difficult anyway, of course there wa , that night there were two, yeah two when them, he had to get out in the morning, but er, I mean he did it, but I expect it was a struggle
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	you know you have to go backwards and forwards
*DOR:	Yeah
*WEN:	shake yourself round, but I've never know that last night
*DOR:	Yeah sometimes when Rosemary was here, we didn't have any bother or anything but now and again somebody, she did their hair at the time 
*WEN:	Oh yeah 
*DOR:	dress making and er somebody would park outside our house, not by the drive, but there but to get in Les had to swing over and round 
*WEN:	That's it 
*DOR:	and then when they were
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	he couldn't swing much so he had to go down and back in but er
*WEN:	That's what you have to do 
*DOR:	it was only occasionally, I mean no bother with it or each other 
*WEN:	I mean this is virtually every day
*DOR:	Yeah
*WEN:	every day now, now I mean I don't know how many she's got living in there or what they've got living in there, they stay 
*UNK:	 (        )

*SAN:	hell of a squeak of brakes and they had two vans and as you used to turn the corner by Swatons, the bollards are out
*WEN:	Yeah
*SAN:	the wrong, the wrong side of the road, of course you've got the blind bend, somebody had gone round there, somebody else was coming down old Whitton Road legally 
*DOR:	Mm, mm 
*WEN:	Oh my god 
*SAN:	and they sort of met and how they didn't hit I don't know   (.) but at the moment it's, well get the car back today it's er been away being done, cos somebody smashed into him
*WEN:	Oh no  (.) 
*SAN:	he managed to pull it out, he, they smashed all the front wing in, he was parked
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	outside a customer's house and all of a sudden there was a knock at the door
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	getting to the end, you know the important bit of the sale
*WEN:	Someone bashed you 
*SAN:	got 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	and it was a young girl next door, a car
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	backed out of her parents' drive
*DOR:	Mm
*SAN:	well drove out and turned, her bumper caught Mick's wing and right up against the wheel so imagine to pull it out to drive it and the driver said oh won't claim on the insurance she said, erm, I'll pay it, get three estimates and let me have them and Mick said it's gonna be about three hundred quid, well if it had gone through the insurance he could then have put in for a hire car
*WEN:	Oh yeah
*SAN:	of course he couldn't, he said oh well he said what's the point
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	so he hadn't been working, earning money, he knocked a hole in the dining room from the lounge wall yesterday  (.) 
*WEN:	Well I, I, I have got 
*SAN:	cos I say 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	and the worse is the mess is, my god
*WEN:	Well I have to say Sandra that I would, alright you've got a lot of mess, but I have to say I'd sooner have one like that than
*SAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	well we've tongued and grooved
*SAN:	Just as well we haven't got next door neighbour 
*WEN:	right 
*SAN:	joined on
*WEN:	tongued and grooved or, or something pine for the kitchen wall, do it, pay it, forget it right, so, I mean I don't know what wood I mean we'd have, we'd have to see it, but I said to him look I said something's gotta be done, so I said to him shall we get Gary  or somebody similar to do some Artexing in here and he said well with the coal fire and all that he said it'll, it'll get dirty
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	which it will won't it?
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	And erm, so I said alright then give me some suggestions, because when we moved out of erm Milton Avenue, Diane and Harry immediately did the walls wood in the kitchen, about the same size as mine
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	and it looked like
*DOR:	Andrew's got that in his bathroom half way, that's what he said 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	and then he's got a moulded piece along the top of it and then he's 
*WEN:	Yeah 
*DOR:	got the wall paper, it looks ever so nice
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	does, does it?
*DOR:	rubbed it all down and
*WEN:	And that would be alright in a, in a bathroom you know
*SAN:	Dean's got a complete pine bathroom
*WEN:	Has he?
*SAN:	he's boxed his bathroom in pine and 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	that wood stuff and then varnished
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	well I said to him
*SAN:	It looks nice very nice it looks 
*WEN:	look I said I don't mind vinyl, I don't mind good vinyl the only good, the only one that, it was good for the toilet, but I got it in a pack cos we've got such a small single toilet
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	I got it in a pack outside Fads
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	but if you believe the proper price
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	I mean it was just three rolls 
*DOR:	I know it's terrible the price of it, weren't it?When you go, at Tesco's they've got a sale ain't they?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	that, that quick one Texas
*WEN:	Yeah
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	twenty five is it or twenty percent off or something, but I think I don't know some of the stuff when you 
*WEN:	Well I said to him look, I said I know I'm fed up with this thing next door, and I don't want to stay there, but Alan said that I've got to stay there, right, so I said to him, you know, we have to start doing something and I said to him something permanent because he ain't a handy man, I mean he'll do it, because I mean it's something like measuring steel innit?Let's be honest 
*DOR:	But you've got to keep on and that yeah, that's right, yeah 
*WEN:	but I said to him, I'll go and buy vinyl and we can come back into the same position, and he ain't no good at sticking vinyl up, I always go round with a bloody
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	then I have to do something I suppose before we look round it'll be August we'll be off to Malta
*DOR:	Mm and then it's the winter again 
*WEN:	and then he'll look round and 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	winter comes so quick
*WEN:	So quick and he said alright then I erm, I said well where shall we go and he said there's plenty of places
*DOR:	Mm
*WEN:	to buy wood
*DOR:	I mean I know nothing
*WEN:	As I say next we're getting this Phillip's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	this Phillip, he does a lot, I mean I don't like Phillip's but as I say
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	my Ian says that, Ian says that
*DOR:	That's a lot, I mean that wooden fence we had I mean, a lot of garden fences are dear, but it was a pound cheaper in the garden centre at Tesco's 
*WEN:	We've got one there
*SAN:	Most of B & Q stuffs are cheaper
*DOR:	B & Q's nice
*WEN:	Yeah, where is that builders that

*WEN:	Tim's coming up to move the bath back and all that you see, this old bath and erm, do some pipe work, but until that's all done, erm, er, until this woman is sorted out, because if I find in the end we've got to insulate again, then I know how I feel, I mean that tongue and groove going up polystyrene in the lounge and yesterday I think he's got a new organ
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah, I think it's an organ, and that, that is all in those two recesses, now, you know if I find you know that I don't get anywhere and I can't see that I won't, but if, because the bathroom is where the dog is there, of course consequently that comes through the corner of the lounge
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	erm, well before wherever you put anything, you know, finished article on the bathroom wall, that one wall we might have to do whatever they allow
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	because this is, I mean I didn't hear the dogs last night, only the kid, but I mean nevertheless the day before if you'd of been in there, so but, but the kitchen can be done, toilet can be done
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	We don't want tiles now look
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	and I think he's got all the tiles now there's a load of tiles going cheap in there
*WEN:	I know, and this is what I said, he said I know I don't really want the old vinyl, do it anyway
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	oh it's a pig of a job
*WEN:	Yeah I remember you have to
*SAN:	It's alright if your walls are absolutely

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	mine is absolutely I mean it's, it looks fine and it's done, but if you actually put the skirt level there are actual places 
*DOR:	Mm, mm yeah 
*WEN:	Well when you walked in my porch when those blokes were doing it, you walked in there, I mean it's nice, it's a wrong suite for the for the room, too narrow the room for one of those
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	I think
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	but the minute you walk in a shop, pretty curtains, Austrian blinds, a new shower
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	the minute you walk in there you look at this lump
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) Our wall is flat 
*WEN:	because the wall 
*DOR:	but when Pete was doing the sides of the erm lounge and he erm put that coving up
*WEN:	round it 
*DOR:	and got sort of in the hall, ha, and you can just about see it 
*WEN:	Yeah 
*DOR:	now, it's sort of wall goes

*DOR:	down  ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	Oh yes
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	and he said crikey look at this, what am I gonna do here and he sort of had to fill quite a big gap in, but he sort of pushed it and filled it and then the wallpaper goes up so you can just see it, a little bit, what's a name now, just in the hall there's a bit 
*SAN:	Ours shows because it's not a bold pattern it's very subdued
*DOR:	Mm
*SAN:	but it's a lot like a chevron
*DOR:	Mm, mm
*SAN:	so you've got your pattern down, because when you've got something like that 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) Yeah 
*SAN:	it's fine, until, unless you actually look
*DOR:	that's right yeah  ((laugh)) 
*SAN:	go all round the ceiling line, round, the pattern all matches, and the pattern
*DOR:	Yeah
*SAN:	you walk round the room this side and it's all level, it's when you get up the top
*DOR:	Yeah, it's just in this one top part in the corner
*SAN:	well the bit where it meets, pattern should be over the door, so it's not until you're in the room and looking back out 
*DOR:	not back over, yeah 
*SAN:	but when he did it I said oh my god you know I said yeah, but you know it's there
*DOR:	Yeah, like where I sit in my chair if I look up there I can see it, but as I say it's not there all the wallpaper 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	it doesn't, but when he first sort of put it up, I thought oh crumbs look at that  ((laugh)) 
*SAN:	Yes, I must admit I had one or two people going up the loo and looking, I mean people stop and look when we first had all the stuff outside, you know, what you doing in there?Because then they could see the conservatory gradually taking shape
*DOR:	Mm
*SAN:	but  (.) 
*DOR:	yeah lovely

*SAN:	but Annette was out yesterday after work and she come in and she sort of opened the door, good god she said just as well I'm not sitting in to watch television, well you couldn't
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SAN:	until about half past nine, when they said right that's all the dir dirty work done, he said I'm going up to have a shower and he put the carpet, rolled the carpet half back, and picked up a load of mess and we had polythene dust sheets over it
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SAN:	and the dust that had got underneath was absolutely thick 
*DOR:	Mm, you wouldn't know , you wouldn't believe it would you?
*SAN:	the television the video and all that

*DOR:	sucking it up  ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	Of course he's tried to get under a polythene sheet to contain it
*DOR:	Right, is like the dentist  ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	it was hot, it was dust in that hammer drill, god it makes a noise, it did, it certainly saved a lot though
*SAN:	Yeah
