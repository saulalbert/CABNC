*CLA:	I can't find any where else to put it . •141499_141692•
*HEL:	Well why don't you put it on the table or on the little table, it doesn't even fit on that shelf, does it? •141692_142333•
        It's too big. •142338_142435•
        You can't really have that and these plates on that shelf. •142555_142891•

*HEL:	Alright, well. •143367_143425•
*CLA:	It's always falling . •143425_143547•
*HEL:	On the little table it'll fit, and you can put the cups . •143877_144238•

*HEL:	Cups and saucers on, well you can do that, look you can do that better than I can. •144341_144917•
        Here you are, there, it's on the little table, now you put the cups and saucers on it. •145021_145352•
*CLA:	Ok, it doesn't matter they can stay . •145484_145614•
*HEL:	Go on, you can do those better than I can. •145750_145931•
