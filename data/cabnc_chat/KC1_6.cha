@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 040706)
*STE:	If the worst comes to the worst Dave's found a place where we can get new tyres for about twenty five quid each for the M G.
*FRA:	Oh yeah.
*STE:	He's still trying to find some   (.) he's phoned a bloke in Plymouth see if he can get them.
*FRA:	That's a nice tyre we got for the erm caravan for ten quid. (.) It's er
*STE:	 (        ) would be nice cos they look ni we had on the other white M G and they're a nice   (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah 
*STE:	 (        ) .The other one's all arrived over safely and the bloke's driven it and he's all happy with it
*FRA:	Oh good.
*STE:	and waiting for his next one to come   (        ) 
*FRA:	Oh marvellous.
*STE:	Er
*FRA:	Is he selling them over there?
*STE:	No he's keeping them for just fun cars for himself, he's just got the money to burn over there 
*FRA:	Marvellous
*STE:	so   (.) he's only, he's got a   (.) one of the new   (.) B M W seven three five that er no the big Merc, a big new Merc through that's right, not the   (.) the latest Merc   (        ) so he says er er he's a bit disappointed with the brakes on the M G but   (.) Dave said they were a phenomenal brake for an   [laughing] M G he said    (        )  [] 
*FRA:	Yes.
*STE:	compare it against the latest Merc  (        ) 
*FRA:	That's right.
*STE:	 (        )  (.) He's all 
*FRA:	I expect 
*STE:	he's all been paid all his money and  (        ) 
*FRA:	Mm but it's good in a way that he's got his money because he can sort of, sort of finance ours
*STE:	Well yeah he is, he's got a little bit anyway   (        ) 
*FRA:	till we, yeah yeah, I should imagine he is.
*STE:	quite a few bits and pieces. (.) It's getting Kevin in to finish it off.I phoned Kevin, I've got Kevin's mum and dad's phone number off Dave and phoned at home but he's gone out for the day or something they said.
*FRA:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*STE:	But he's got to strip the bonnet so Dave said well I'll get my lad to strip the bonnet this afternoon and er   (.) you know, (        ) few hundred quid for the day we'll be glad to be able to finish off doing them and   (.) He's got too many   (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah cos you haven't been able to 
*STE:	to play with really er we c to clear ten we've still got two and a half grand left
*FRA:	Have we?
*STE:	and so there's twelve and a half grand we're owed
*FRA:	Yeah yeah 
*STE:	 (        ) so if he charges, you know, fifteen hundred for his bit and then another grand to finish it off we're still clearing ten, you know, (        ) 
*FRA:	Oh well that's good then.
*STE:	we might even clear a little bit more than ten but 
*FRA:	Bit more than ten, yeah.
*STE:	I mean if he charges two and a half I wouldn't be disappointed cos it's been in his garage, he's pushed everything along and he's always   (        ) so
*FRA:	Yeah, oh and he's been pretty reasonable hasn't he?
*STE:	we're all going out for a drink with yourselves I think.
*FRA:	Good.That sounds like a good idea.
*STE:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Me, I don't drink.
*STE:	 [laughing] No don't drink   [] any more   (        ) 
*FRA:	Not at this moment.
*STE:	starts tonight dunnit?
*FRA:	 [laughing] It was funny  [] 
*STE:	 (        ) I'll see if he can arrange the old erm  (        ) 
*FRA:	the guy's er filling out the form for the er mortgage and he's er   (.) said non-smoker?Yeah, yeah and Lynette yeah non-smoker, you know.When we got outside I said I couldn't very well offer him one I only had two left in the packet   ((laugh)) 
*STE:	 ((laugh)) That makes quite a difference on your policy, the premium 
*FRA:	Yeah 
*STE:	if you're non-smokers.
*FRA:	She laughed, she thought it was hilarious.
*STE:	Yeah.
*FRA:	Couldn't really offer him one. (.) 
*STE:	Ah the well known tube company of   (.) Shung Wa 
*FRA:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] 
*STE:	 (        ) Toshiba tubes   (        ) 
*FRA:	Chung Wa yeah.
*STE:	Chung Wa 
*FRA:	Wonder where these are made, oh Taiwan. (.) 
*STE:	It must be the big companies that have gone and set factories up   (        ) mustn't they?
*FRA:	Yeah.I tell you what, what a beautiful little chassis that, I mean that's 
*STE:	 (        ) the technology just from a
*FRA:	I mean that's so easy innit?
*STE:	It's beautiful innit?Easy to work on.
*FRA:	Yeah.
*STE:	All you've gotta do is find out what's wr gone wrong with it.
*FRA:	Well I should think it's this little frame chip here, I'm 
*STE:	Oh 
*FRA:	I'm gonna check all round I mean I should imagine that's what it must be.
*STE:	Standard one is it?Or something weird.
*FRA:	Well it's bound to be something weird I suppose. (        )  (.) fifty, oh   (.) looks like a five five one thread  (.) 
*STE:	A N?
*FRA:	What do you make it?I think that's
*STE:	Well   (        ) have a look.
*FRA:	I'll get the t the torch, that's what I want probably.
*STE:	Ah   (.) yep, perfectly correct.A N five five one five   (.) you won't have one of them in stock will you?
*FRA:	No. (.) Have a check see if the   (        ) go in that direction, pretty sure they do. [singing] la la la la la    []  (.) yeah, that's it, that's the frame output chip. (.) I think I might just give it a solder over because it's er a bit dry in that area. (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Oh yeah. (.) 
*STE:	That's   (        ) I've done all of that plus them others you   (        ) 
*FRA:	Yes I'll just try these erm   (.) solder up this service switch and er    (.)  (        ) everything else seems alright, there's no   (        ) anywhere, mind you it's nine times out of ten it'll   (        )  (.) 
*STE:	Oh quite a nice design innit eh?The leaves are long enough to    (.)  (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah   (.) I can leave the speaker off for a minute. (.) I can just about get in behind without blowing myself up I think. (.) No, that's what it'll be then
*STE:	 (        )  (.)
