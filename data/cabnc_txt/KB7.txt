               [4] If you press [...] this one, if you press record ... it
               won't because there's a tape in but if you just press press
               record [...] automatic [...] and you press [...] record and the
               play button ... but you can't press just the record button.
               [5] They automatically both go down.

Stuart (PS02H) [6] Provided there's a tape in the
Ann (PS02G)    [7] In the machine.
Stuart (PS02H) [8] in the machine that
Ann (PS02G)    [9] I saw it actually when I was ... just doing it and it went
               ... how loud it was.
               [10] How could you be unobtru but it isn't look.
               [11] Can't hear it.
               [12] Cos you can hear it bzzzzzzzzzzz
Stuart (PS02H) [13] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [14] I thought ... [...] loud.
Stuart (PS02H) [15] [...] noisy [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [16] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [17] You're gonna
Ann (PS02G)    [18] You could be an ob an obtrusive [...] making that noise.
Stuart (PS02H) [19] No.
               [20] No it doesn't
Ann (PS02G)    [21] Though it doesn't make a noise cos I was doing it wrong.
Stuart (PS02H) [22] Yes.
               [23] It's going slowly now.
Ann (PS02G)    [24] [laugh] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [25] Going much more slowly now as it records more ... conver
               conversations.
Ann (PS02G)    [26] That's it.
               [27] ... Mm ... Don't stop talking now.
               [28] [...] silly.
               [29] [laugh] ... It's all gonna go quiet now isn't it?
               [30] Nobody else'll say anything. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [31] [...] at all.
Ann (PS02G)    [32] [laugh] That's ridiculous!
               [33] [laughing] You gotta []
Stuart (PS02H) [34] [...] .
               [35] We'll just have to ... put it down there some time and just
               ... put it on.
Ann (PS02G)    [36] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [37] So you wouldn't know when it's on or when it's off.
Ann (PS02G)    [38] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [39] Just have to try and, take a little while to get used to
               it.
               [40] Once you're used to it it's probably [...] .
               [41] It's all a matter of getting used to being recorded.
               [42] Conversation.
Ann (PS02G)    [43] Yeah well it sounds ever so funny when you hear it [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [44] I know.
               [45] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [46] Horrible.
               [47] You think ... I don't sound like that!
               [48] [laugh] . Really makes you think.
               [49] I wish [...] done something about my ... the way I speak.
Stuart (PS02H) [50] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [51] Mine's terrible because I've got a low voice, a deep voice
               anyway.
               [52] Sound more like a man I do.
               [53] I do on the phone don't I?
Stuart (PS02H) [54] Don't know really.
               [55] I've not really heard you much on the phone.
Ann (PS02G)    [56] Used to telephone didn't you?
Stuart (PS02H) [57] Well yeah but
Ann (PS02G)    [58] Didn't know it was me.
Stuart (PS02H) [59] Oh yeah I knew it was you so it didn't make a lot of
               difference.
Ann (PS02G)    [60] People have told me on the phone that I sound [cough] cos
               I've got a deep voice I
Stuart (PS02H) [61] You sound different.
               [62] ... Vera does.
Ann (PS02G)    [63] Does she?
Stuart (PS02H) [64] Mm.
               [65] ... She sounds funny on the phone.
               [66] Most odd.
               [67] Phone her up and think ... that's not Vera I'm talking to.
               [68] Doesn't sound like Vera.
               [69] But it is ... although it doesn't sound like her.
               [70] Funny innit?
Ann (PS02G)    [71] What, her voice is different?
Stuart (PS02H) [72] No it just sounds
Ann (PS02G)    [73] Or does she talk different because she's on the phone?
Stuart (PS02H) [74] No ... just sounds
Ann (PS02G)    [75] Some people do.
               [76] [clears throat] They put their phone voice on.
Stuart (PS02H) [77] Yeah.
               [78] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [79] Don't they?
Stuart (PS02H) [80] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [81] Oh I can't put any voice on, I've just got me own. [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [82] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [83] I find people do tend to put a ... quite a lot do, put a
               telephone voice on. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [84] Specially if you're phoning a posh restaurant.
Ann (PS02G)    [85] Yes.
Stuart (PS02H) [86] Or something like that.
               [87] You tend to sort of I'd like to book a table for two
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [88] on Saturday night.
               [89] Rather than say ... look mush I want a
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [90] I want a table, you know. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [91] [cough] ... Oh I'd better go and wash our dishes dear.
Stuart (PS02H) [92] Not many to do now [...] done them all.
Ann (PS02G)    [93] Most of them.
               [94] There's only yours.
               [95] Have you had
Stuart (PS02H) [96] What about
Ann (PS02G)    [97] enough to eat?
Stuart (PS02H) [98] Yes thank you.
               [99] Fine.
               [100] I would have done it actually when, when I took the plate
               out but the water in the bowl was cold.
               [101] Thought it was hot but it was cold.
Ann (PS02G)    [102] I think I've used most of the hot water.
               [103] I think I need to put the immersion on for just ... a
               little while.
Stuart (PS02H) [104] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [105] I need a bath as well but
Stuart (PS02H) [106] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [107] I've used quite a few buckets of water washing walls.
Stuart (PS02H) [108] Washing the walls and ... [...] ... What's going on
               outside?
               [109] ... Car or lorry or something going by by the sound of it.
               ...
Ann (PS02G)    [110] About that little ... flat in ... [...] in Albany Road.
Stuart (PS02H) [111] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [112] You have to realize that ... we're never gonna get away
               from work.
               [113] Cos when the wind blows you can smell a tandoori and
               [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [114] It's when you walk up that way you know you're getting
               near it
Stuart (PS02H) [115] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [116] cos you can smell it.
               [117] Won't bother you?
Stuart (PS02H) [118] No.

Ann (PS02G)    [405] That's what one of his school reports said.
               [406] Jonathan suffers with an over ab abundance of exuberance.

               that mean er ... he never sits still and he's always tearing
               about and [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [408] said well something like that. [laugh] .
Stuart (PS02H) [409] Yeah but probably now they'd call it hyperactivity.
Ann (PS02G)    [410] Probably.
               [411] ... I don't think he was, he was just ... I dunno [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [412] A lad.
Ann (PS02G)    [413] Yeah.
               [414] And I I er and not only that I used to say to teachers
               well if ... if they'd ask him about and if he had ... anything
               er er and he'd be bored.
Stuart (PS02H) [415] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [416] [...] why do you [...] Jonathan,St Steven said oh he'd
               been in detention.
               [417] Why have you been in detention?
               [418] ... Oh I was playing up and they chucked me out the class
               or something and I had to stay in at dinner time.
               [419] Said well why were you playing up?
               [420] I was bored.
Stuart (PS02H) [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [421] I tried telling some of the teachers that.
               [422] He finds the lessons boring ... so obviously they're gonna
               mess about.
Stuart (PS02H) [423] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [424] If they're bor if you're bored and you can't
Stuart (PS02H) [425] Bored yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [426] So you, you get distracted and do something else
Stuart (PS02H) [427] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [428] you shouldn't be doing.
               [429] And that's a fault in some ways of the teachers.
Stuart (PS02H) [430] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [431] If the pupils are bored the ... should make it interesting
               enough to keep their interest.
Stuart (PS02H) [432] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [433] Mm.
               [434] Yeah I know [...] subjects they're not ... you can't be
               interested in all of them.
Stuart (PS02H) [435] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [436] Look at them cars. [cough]
Stuart (PS02H) [437] When I was at the garage ... getting the petrol ... I give
               them, signed the cheque and they put the cheque through the ...
               cheque machine printing it out and that ... and er ... they've
               got a free offer at the moment.
               [438] You collect these tokens for ... collect so many tokens
               and you get ... a free Corgi toy.
               [439] ... I mean normally I don't bother with the tokens, I mean
               I ... Anyway I paid the cheque ... and I said to Peter I said
               ... oh by the way what about me ... tokens for me ... for me toy
               I said ... if I get a free one of them I can give it to ... give
               it to the grandchildren.
               [440] See, Ricky'd like that I'm sure, little Corgi car I said
               [...] .
               [441] He said oh no you don't get them with cheques.
               [442] Cash sales only.
               [443] ... [...] I thought ... I just spent twenty seven quid on
               petrol [...] I said [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [444] And you can't even have a bloody free Dinky car.
Stuart (PS02H) [445] free couple of vouchers for a new ... for a Corgi toy.
               [446] ... There's a woman in there she said oh give it to him.
               [447] I said [...] give you a cuddle some time.
Ann (PS02G)    [448] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [449] I just thought you know I ... [...] okay it's only a
               cheque I know but
Ann (PS02G)    [450] Yeah but it's still twenty seven quid.
               [451] They don't get many twenty seven pound customers.
Stuart (PS02H) [452] No.
               [453] That's what I thought.
Ann (PS02G)    [454] Fiver or what have you.
Stuart (PS02H) [455] I think it's I think it's one voucher for fifteen litres.
               [456] ... Now what do I have?
               [457] If I had twenty seven quid's worth ... at fifty P a litre
               ... that's ... fifty two ... fifty two?
               [458] Fifty two litres [...] roughly [...] so if it was one
               voucher for fifteen that's ... three innit?
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [459] And I think it was six vouchers for for a free
Ann (PS02G)    [460] That's it.
Stuart (PS02H) [461] free Corgi toy.
               [462] So all I've got to do is when I run out again fill it up
               again spending another twenty five quid's worth or so ... that
               would have been six and I could have had a free Corgi toy for
               ... Ricky for Christmas.
Ann (PS02G)    [463] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [464] Or ... whatever. [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [465] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [466] Little present innit?
Ann (PS02G)    [467] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [468] Hasn't cost me nothing has it?
               [469] Or hasn't cost you anything.
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [470] But next time I shall have to run, take the cash in there.
               [471] ... And see ... see what they say next time.

               [474] And they've got a machine to do it anyway to ... work it
               all out, print it all out.
Ann (PS02G)    [475] Not very fair is it?
Stuart (PS02H) [476] Oh no.
Ann (PS02G)    [477] Saying cash I mean it's still cash ... innit? ...

               chap in [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [617] I did think it, well I did think it was a possibility but
               I mean
Ann (PS02G)    [618] Probably his mother and father ... her mother and father
               had been in there anyway.
Stuart (PS02H) [619] [...] there's a little boy there'd be no chance of him ...
               going in there anyway.
Ann (PS02G)    [620] Oh no, course not.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [621] Course not.
Stuart (PS02H) [622] So
Ann (PS02G)    [623] I'm going soft in the ... her mum and dad'll probably be
               in.
               [624] That's their regular [...] if they were having a ...
               country and western they would ask him to do it because he's
Stuart (PS02H) [625] What's his ... what's her mum and dad look like?
Ann (PS02G)    [626] He's big.
               [627] He's a, such a big fella.
               [628] Fat.

               [laughing] broad [] .
               [630] But dad's a [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [631] Maybe they were in the lounge perhaps.
Ann (PS02G)    [632] bigger ... I mean he he he's at least as tall as you if
               not bigger and er also ...
Stuart (PS02H) [633] Sort of Tom size?

               foot two. [laugh] .

Stuart (PS02H) [642] Well then I certainly didn't see anybody in there looking
               like that.
               [643] ... I must admit. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [644] Oh she usually goes after bingo.
               [645] They'll probably be in all night and she's just walked up
               from the bingo and ... toddle in there.
Stuart (PS02H) [646] No I didn't see anybody looking like that so ... I don't
               know.
Ann (PS02G)    [647] I wouldn't think they'd be in the lounge.
               [648] They could be but I wouldn't have thought so.
Stuart (PS02H) [649] Thursday night anyway I wouldn't, does she go to the
               Empire [...]

               she?
               [660] ... Probably went to ... I know that she does go [...] .
               [661] She [...] there most of the evening and she goes to bingo
               and
Stuart (PS02H) [662] Yeah.

               [671] ... [...] anyway but ... Well Ann is going ... to retire.
               [672] I suppose you're gonna have a bottle and a fag.
               [673] Mind you, the smell of you I think you've had sufficient
               bottles but
Stuart (PS02H) [674] [...] well [...] ...
Ann (PS02G)    [675] Told you not to drink much.
Stuart (PS02H) [676] I did n't.
Ann (PS02G)    [677] Ooh.
               [678] Perhaps I'd better stop up then.
Stuart (PS02H) [679] Well I tried not to, but
Ann (PS02G)    [680] [laugh] What?
Stuart (PS02H) [681] [...] Bob said do you want a drink and ... Ron said do you
               want a drink and I said to Ron do you want a drink Ron and
               everyone said do you want a drink and ...
Ann (PS02G)    [682] You had quite a few.
Stuart (PS02H) [683] No, not that many.
               [684] [laugh] But er
Ann (PS02G)    [685] But I might as well go to bed.
Stuart (PS02H) [686] probably erm
Ann (PS02G)    [687] But I might as well go to bed?
               [688] And you do realize that this conversation is on a tape
               recorder?
Stuart (PS02H) [689] Well I don't mind.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [690] [...] if it is [...] .
               [691] That's what they want.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [692] Natural conversations so
Ann (PS02G)    [693] Not sure how natural though [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [694] [laugh] I'll have a can of beer and ... then I'll probably
               go to bed. [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [695] We haven't got any left.
               [696] I drunk them.
Stuart (PS02H) [697] They've gone have they?
Ann (PS02G)    [698] Mhm.
Stuart (PS02H) [699] Oh.
               [700] I'd better have a bottle then.
Ann (PS02G)    [701] I drunk them as well.

Stuart (PS02H) [707] Crafty devil.
               [708] ... Put them round the corner where ... where I didn't
               know where they were.
Ann (PS02G)    [709] Falling over now.

Ann (PS02G)    [714] Oh I wish you'd have been at home, I'd have gone round
               there.
Stuart (PS02H) [715] What've they been up to now then?
Ann (PS02G)    [716] Oh god!
               [717] She's been screaming.
               [718] He's been ... reckon she must have locked herself up in
               the dark.
               [719] And the only place with a lock on is the bathroom and I
               reckon they'll blooming knock the blooming door down by the
               sound of it.
Stuart (PS02H) [720] Gawd.
Brian (PS02J)  [721] She was screaming, he was swearing.
               [722] Running up and down the stairs.
Stuart (PS02H) [723] What time was this?
Ann (PS02G)    [724] Quarter to ten till about half past ten.
               [725] Or half an hour till half past ten [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [726] Well that wouldn't please them next door would it?
Ann (PS02G)    [727] No.
Stuart (PS02H) [728] Coo. [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [729] And and really I mean you can't ... I'm I'm s I'm saying
               that you, you can't interfere but ... by god I'd long for
               someone to come in and interfere.
               [730] ... I really would have done.
               [731] And er er I ... I could never understand why people ...
               that obviously could hear what went on ... and pretended they
               never.
               [732] ... I know you don't wanna get involved
Stuart (PS02H) [733] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [734] and this that and the other ... but people must have heard
               what went on and and ... you know the next morning they'd see a
               black eye and just carry out a normal conversation as though
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [735] and you know they hadn't heard it all and
Stuart (PS02H) [736] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [737] ooh have you had a fall or something?
               [738] Then you know I mean they must have [...] what was going
               on oh aye they just completely ... ignore it.
Stuart (PS02H) [739] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [740] I'd be walking round ... if I could get around.
Stuart (PS02H) [741] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [742] It were just you know oh it's a nice morning when I'm
               hanging the washing out as though everything was wonderful you
               know [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [743] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [744] normal.
Stuart (PS02H) [745] Yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [746] Ooh I thought he was going to, ooh I felt ... made me go
               cold and I ... I thought if, if I hadn't been here on my own I'd
               have been very tempted to go round and ... and say is there
               anything I can do.
               [747] ... Or I'd have called the police I think.
               [748] I weren't sure what I'd have done but
Stuart (PS02H) [749] Bad as that?
Ann (PS02G)    [750] Oh [...] .
               [751] He was a calling her effing this, swearing oh it was
               dreadful.
               [752] She was screaming and you could hear her crying.
               [753] Then you hear, she pounded up the bloody stairs and he was
               after her ... and I reckon ... well the only room with a lock
               ...
Stuart (PS02H) [754] As you say is the bathroom.
Ann (PS02G)    [755] is the bathroom, so she must have been in there cos he's
               hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it.
               [756] ... Bloody hell of a row.
               [757] ... Or whether she opened it or whether she was in the
               front bedroom with something behind the door I dunno but ...
Stuart (PS02H) [758] That's his
Ann (PS02G)    [759] and she run back down the stairs and the front door was
               opening and banging and shutting, whether she run outside or
               what ... I don't know what happened, the dog was bloody barking.
Stuart (PS02H) [760] Oh lord. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [761] Well it's a wonder Ann and Rita haven't done something
               about it.
Stuart (PS02H) [762] Well I say it's er ... amazing they've not said, said
               something [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [763] And they had company as well there's a car there, blue
               car. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [764] Who Ann and Rita or?
Ann (PS02G)    [765] Or Ann and Rita.
               [766] I don't know.
Stuart (PS02H) [767] [...] Sally innit?
Ann (PS02G)    [768] I don't know who it was. [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [769] It was Sally if it was a blue e , blue cavalier.
               [770] ... T D O something something something.
Ann (PS02G)    [771] Sally can't drive so it must be some
Stuart (PS02H) [772] Can't she?
Ann (PS02G)    [773] [...] Her latest beau I should think, I don't know.
Stuart (PS02H) [774] Maybe.
               [775] Maybe maybe. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [776] But it was ... I mean I could hear it over the telly.
               [777] ... I know I don't have the telly on full blast but ... I
               could hear it
Stuart (PS02H) [778] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [779] above the telly.
               [780] When I first heard the first noise I thought what the
               bloody hell's that and I turned the sound down.
Stuart (PS02H) [781] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [782] Thought bloody hell, put it back up but you could, it was
               really distressing me cos
Stuart (PS02H) [783] You knew what was possibly going on.
Ann (PS02G)    [784] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [785] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [786] A woman and that don't s I mean ... if you're having just
               an argument ... it's raised voices but a woman doesn't scream
               and ... cry like that unless ...
Stuart (PS02H) [787] Unless there's something really
Ann (PS02G)    [788] something awful going on.
Stuart (PS02H) [789] Mm. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [790] I mean Ann and Rita reckon they're not married or anything
               but why the hell does she stay with him then?
               [791] She's not got a bloody
Stuart (PS02H) [792] Well there you go I mean
Ann (PS02G)    [793] she's got no children.
               [794] They're only young.
               [795] ... It's her house.
               [796] Isn't his.
               [797] ... He couldn't, she bought it without, with her father
               and
Stuart (PS02H) [798] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [799] and he come and lived with her in it.
               [800] ... Bloody hell.
               [801] I know I mean I stayed with him but I had three kids.
Stuart (PS02H) [802] Gonna say you're you're [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [803] I had three kids, where could I go with them?
Stuart (PS02H) [804] Mm.
               [805] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [806] If I'd have been on me own I mean that's all I was waiting
               for, mine to grow up so I could clear off.
Stuart (PS02H) [807] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [808] If I'd have been on me own I wouldn't have stopped bloody
               long.
               [809] ... I mean even if she walks out he doesn't, no court in
               the land would give him the house if it's hers.
               [810] ... [...] evicted and then she could come back again.
Stuart (PS02H) [811] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [812] Well if she went to the police they'd chuck him out.
               [813] He has no legal rights to the property.
               [814] It's in her name, she's, her father's helping her ... paid
               the deposit or something and she clears the mortgage ... she has
               no right, he has no right to it all if she went to the police.
               [815] They'd just turf him out wouldn't they?
Stuart (PS02H) [816] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [817] Well why stay in a relationship like that?
               [818] ... Don't understand it. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [819] Certainly a bit rough, a bit hard.
Ann (PS02G)    [820] Went quiet about half past ten so whether he buggered off
               out or what I don't know.
Stuart (PS02H) [821] Mm maybe.
Ann (PS02G)    [822] Certainly the front door was opening and banging and
               shutting.
Stuart (PS02H) [823] Say I'm surprised Ann and Rita haven't sort of didn't
Ann (PS02G)    [824] Well banging on the wall probably with all the other
               banging and [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [825] May maybe.
               [826] Maybe.
               [827] They [...] part of the banging.
Ann (PS02G)    [828] So much bloody banging going on.
Stuart (PS02H) [829] Probably part of the banging ... Ann and Rita.
Ann (PS02G)    [830] And the people on this side [...] you don't know how they
               were reacting as well.
               [831] Say, they was a quite young couple.
               [832] We don't hear them that much do we?
               [833] ... Mornings is the ... time I hear them most.
               [834] Cos they go out to work at half past eight and you hear
               them between half past seven and half past eight
*** 5 (Tape 018205) ***

Ann (PS02G)    [867] Well you're good at remembering numbers.

               [872] Funny innit?
Ann (PS02G)    [873] Yes very strange but you are strange.
Stuart (PS02H) [874] I know yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [875] Very strange, yeah, very strange.
Ann (PS02G)    [876] You always remember numbers.
               [877] Don't you?
               [878] Car numbers and telephone numbers and
Stuart (PS02H) [879] Car numbers I remember more by the letters than the
               numbers.
               [880] Because there are s specific set numbers.
               [881] ... Once I see
Ann (PS02G)    [882] [...] When they come round at work and says ... this car
               blocked in I say oh go and ask Stuart he'll probably know.
               [883] [laugh] Give you a blooming it's a blue something or other
               and this is the number.
               [884] [...] Go and ask [...] .
               [885] I said go and Stuart or Bill they, they know most of them.
               [886] [laugh] ... I wouldn't know one from another.
Stuart (PS02H) [887] [...] associated the letters with the car and the letters
               with the car go together.
               [888] And then the numbers, the numbers I don't remember that
               well.
               [889] Some of them I do.
               [890] ... [...] now with them changing the ... the changeover
               cos they always used to be ... the letters followed by the
               numbers.
               [891] Now they've got ... the initial letter ... followed by the
               number then the letters.
               [892] Rather than so ... As I say you associate the car and the
               number together.
Ann (PS02G)    [893] I don't. [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [894] It would probably throw me completely If you [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [895] it would throw me completely if you put, if you changed
               some of the number plates over.
               [896] If you put Tina's number plate ... on another car ... and
               visa versa ... that would throw, I I'd probably look at it and
               think ... you know, oh somebody's got a new car or that looks
               familiar but it's not the right car so I wouldn't think about
               it.
               [897] Even though I know Tina's is C two one one Y C L ... if it
               was on a different car ... I'd probably look at it ... and think
Ann (PS02G)    [898] Oh that's not right.
Stuart (PS02H) [899] it's not right, it's not Tina's.
               [900] And so I wouldn't think that that ... I ... probably ...
               Just a ... just a trait of personality.
Ann (PS02G)    [901] I wonder how she is if she's ... at work or at home.
               [laugh] ...
Stuart (PS02H) [902] Don't really ... [laughing] don't really care to tell you
               the truth in a way but []
Ann (PS02G)    [903] Oh that's nice.
Stuart (PS02H) [904] Well no I care ... I care if Tina's not well and hope she
               gets better soon but ... I don't care if [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [905] You don't care about work getting in a muddle [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [906] I don't care about work and them being in a muddle, no not
               at all.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh] [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [907] Let them get on with it.
Ann (PS02G)    [908] That's not very nice.
Stuart (PS02H) [909] It is.
Ann (PS02G)    [910] No it isn't.
Stuart (PS02H) [911] Well it is.
               [912] Why isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [913] Cos it isn't.
Stuart (PS02H) [914] Well
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [915] if ... a lot of others were off we'd have to cope somehow
               wouldn't we?
               [916] ... So ... there you go.
               [917] Just cos we're off.
               [918] ... And possibly Tina and that is off so ... they'll just
               have to struggle on as if we were there and ... a lot of others
               were off.
               [919] ... Don't you agree?
Ann (PS02G)    [920] Yes darling. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [921] Right.
               [922] So what's on the agenda for today?
Ann (PS02G)    [923] Well you know very well.
               [924] We are going shopping.
Stuart (PS02H) [925] Where are we going shopping?
Ann (PS02G)    [926] Whenever you're ready to take me shopping.
Stuart (PS02H) [927] But where ... are we going shopping?
Ann (PS02G)    [928] Well ... probably Wisbech.
               [929] No point in going to Lynn if we're going to mum's.
Stuart (PS02H) [930] No but where?
Ann (PS02G)    [931] Wherever you wish to take me.
Stuart (PS02H) [932] Where would Ann want to go?
Ann (PS02G)    [933] I don't mind.
               [934] ... Haven't got a lot of choice.
               [935] I don't like Tescos at Wisbech cos it's [...] .
Stuart (PS02H) [936] Right.
Ann (PS02G)    [937] So it's Gateway Gateway or blooming Rainbow.
               [938] ... Suppose we could go down the Rainbow and have a look
               at that microwave.
               [939] ... But I'll have to go into town first.
               [940] ... Cos I don't think they'll give me the shopping for
               nothing and there's no bank down Rainbow.
               [941] Well there is, a Co-op bank but I don't think they'll let
               me have some money out of it.
Stuart (PS02H) [942] Mm.
               [943] Maybe not.
Ann (PS02G)    [944] And seeing as I haven't got an account with them I don't
               think they'll say well you can ... have some anyway.
Stuart (PS02H) [945] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [946] No.
Stuart (PS02H) [947] And then we're going into town?
               [948] Well we've got to go into town
Ann (PS02G)    [949] Got to see the estate agents and see if we can ... view
               something today.
Stuart (PS02H) [950] Mm [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [951] [...] other ones that we are ... definitely interested in
               and underneath the ones that we are ... not so interested in.
Stuart (PS02H) [952] Yeah [...] there's one down, that one down Elizabeth
               Terrace.
               [953] I was just trying to figure out which one it is.
               [954] ... Hundred and twenty.
Ann (PS02G)    [955] I don't know if that isn't ... erm what they call it who
               died not long ago?
               [956] ... Hazel's mum's.
               [957] Cos perhaps the dad's moved out or you know [...] .
               [958] Quite close to her.
               [959] ... Oh what was her name?
               [960] Old Hazel's mother.
Stuart (PS02H) [961] Hazel's mother.
Ann (PS02G)    [962] The little old lady who went to Salvation Army, always
               wearing a little hat.
               [963] Oh what was her name?
               [964] Cos you know her as well.
               [965] And I said oh my god she's died and you said ... oh I know
               her. ... [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [966] What used to go to the Salvation Army?
Ann (PS02G)    [967] She was [...] to Salvation Army.
               [968] Ever so small little lady.
               [969] ... or something.
               [970] I can remember her kids and I can't remember her name.
               [971] ... Terrible.
               [972] Hazel and Terry, mother-in-law's brother Terry ... fire
               officer at Wisbech, it's his mother-in-law ... laws.
               [973] And she died not more than a few months ago.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [974] [...] Oh it's awful.
               [975] It's dreadful I mean ... quite fond of her.
Stuart (PS02H) [976] Just trying to think which one it was anyway .
Ann (PS02G)    [977] I think it's her house.
Stuart (PS02H) [978] Yeah but I'm trying think which one it is.
               [979] ... Cos I say I know that ... I know Elizabeth Terrace
               well.
Ann (PS02G)    [980] Yeah I know cos I think you called on her cos you knew
               her.
               [981] When she died you said ... oh I know her well [laugh] .
Stuart (PS02H) [982] Hundred and twenty.
               [983] ... Let's go and have a look.
               [984] Oh it's in here somewhere innit?
Ann (PS02G)    [985] [...] I put a ring round it so I know ...
Stuart (PS02H) [986] Oh yeah here we are, hundred and twenty.
               [987] Ah the one ... one in from the end.
               [988] ... Yeah, I know the one now.
               [989] One in from the end. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [990] I think that is her house.
               [991] Mind she had a husband but ... should think he ... living
               with one of the kids.
Stuart (PS02H) [992] Can't think who lived there now.
               [993] God, cos I used to call on that one.
               [994] ... [...] perhaps.
               [995] ... [...] The only trouble down Elizabeth Terrace ...
               parking.
Ann (PS02G)    [...] ...
Stuart (PS02H) [996] That's the only trouble.
               [997] The only consolation ... if
Ann (PS02G)    [998] [...] the college.
Stuart (PS02H) [999] if that was a possibility ... or if that became a
               possibility [...] mum only live round the corner.
               [1000] ... Not that far away is she?
               [1001] Few hundred yards.
Ann (PS02G)    [1002] She drives.
Stuart (PS02H) [1003] And I could leave the car in her driveway.
Ann (PS02G)    [1004] Then there's the college.
               [1005] Lot of people park in the college.
               [1006] ... Don't they?
Stuart (PS02H) [1007] So that is a possi I was just wondering which one it was
               cos I say I know ... some of them are a bit you know
Ann (PS02G)    [1008] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1009] a bit dodgy.
               [1010] I knew there there they had a lot of trouble with one of
               them but ... nearer Helen's end.
               [1011] There was one there that was empty and ... for a long
               long while.
               [1012] The builders started building, knocking it about
Ann (PS02G)    [1013] And it fell to bits.
Stuart (PS02H) [1014] And then it
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [1015] and then, no the ... ran out of money.
               [1016] The builder ran out of money ... and the ... it was just
               a shell.
               [1017] You know, nothing in it.
               [1018] No windows no doors no nothing er you know, completely
               gutted it ... to make it all, to renovate it and then ran out of
               money and then it just stood there completely empty.
               [1019] ... And can you imagine a house in the open air in
               winter?
Ann (PS02G)    [1020] Do it a lot of good would it?
Stuart (PS02H) [1021] It wouldn't do it a lot of good, no exactly.
Ann (PS02G)    [1022] Woodwork and
Stuart (PS02H) [1023] [...] exactly.
Ann (PS02G)    [1024] and even the brickwork.
Stuart (PS02H) [1025] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [1026] [...] damp and ... If you get me back to mum's for about
               three o'clock time at the latest to take her to Osborne House.
Stuart (PS02H) [1027] Well that's what she's that's what she's [...] she's, she
               just sort of she didn't mean it but
Ann (PS02G)    [1028] No it [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1029] it was her thought that we were
Ann (PS02G)    [1030] Yeah cos I mean you'd probably run her back, rather than
               her biking.
               [1031] ... As I say I mean we, if we could make an appointment
               say three fifteen or three thirty to see Sefton Avenue.
               [1032] ... Cos we'd be up there anyway.
Stuart (PS02H) [1033] Yeah. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1034] Wouldn't we?
               [1035] Before it gets dark and you couldn't see anything anyway.
Stuart (PS02H) [1036] Oh we'd have to go and have a look in the light.
Ann (PS02G)    [1037] Well that's it. [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1038] Definitely.
Ann (PS02G)    [1039] cos you can't see a lot.
               [1040] Cos there won't be electricity on.
               [1041] Anyway you wanna have a good look round [...] seriously
               consider it.
               [1042] Cos I think now we [...] haven't heard from Mr and I
               think that means ... he's not prepared to take it so he's not
               bothered about coming.
               [1043] ... Yeah?
               [1044] Is that the ... way you're reading it?
Stuart (PS02H) [1045] That's the way I'm reading it.
               [1046] I'm ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1047] Ignore it cos the man might ... just leave him in there
               renting it until or when forever it goes up.
               [1048] But we can't afford it to go up.
Stuart (PS02H) [1049] I'm disappointed that he's not been back
Ann (PS02G)    [1050] Yeah I am.
Stuart (PS02H) [1051] to discuss it.
Ann (PS02G)    [1052] Yeah I am.
Stuart (PS02H) [1053] And to put the position to him.
               [1054] Look the market's not very good I know but ... we're
               sitting tenants.
               [1055] We're quite happy to take it on.
               [1056] We'd like to take it on.
               [1057] If we leave have you got another tenant to come in?
               [1058] You're gonna lose two hundred and fifty pound a month.
               [1059] And a good two hundred and fifty pound a month.
Ann (PS02G)    [1060] Exactly.
Stuart (PS02H) [1061] You know, not one that he has any hassle in getting.
Ann (PS02G)    [1062] That's it.
               [1063] He don't have to keep calling and wandering around after
               us.
               [1064] [...] But I'm not prepared to go on renting it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1065] No no.
Ann (PS02G)    [1066] As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid
               off ... a place of our own is is just ... I mean if [...] I have
               to rent it well I'll have to rent one.
               [1067] If we can't get anything else and we can't afford
               anything else we've just got to go on paying it but
Stuart (PS02H) [1068] But
Ann (PS02G)    [1069] when there's so much other [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1070] as I say you look at ... I mean this is two fifty.
               [1071] You look here in the paper and see how much they are.
Ann (PS02G)    [1072] Yeah I know.
               [1073] Some of them are terrible.
Stuart (PS02H) [1074] You're talking two sixty, two eighty.
Ann (PS02G)    [1075] I know.
               [1076] Three hundred.
Stuart (PS02H) [1077] To let.
               [1078] Three seventy.
Ann (PS02G)    [1079] No!
Stuart (PS02H) [1080] Detached four bedroomed house admittedly.
               [1081] [...] Granary.
               [1082] Two b two two bed
Ann (PS02G)    [1083] That's the one I fancy.
               [1084] If I went anywhere into another flat, I'd quite fancy
               going into [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1085] Two bed second floor self-contained flat.
               [1086] Living room kitchen bathroom twelve months two seventy
               five unfurnished.
Ann (PS02G)    [1087] Mm I know.
Stuart (PS02H) [1088] Armada Close two eighty.
               [1089] Norfolk Street two eighty.
Ann (PS02G)    [1090] Mm I wouldn't I wouldn't go in to Armada Close I don't
               think.
Stuart (PS02H) [1091] That's furnished.
               [1092] Six months.
               [1093] Two eighty.
Ann (PS02G)    [1094] Yeah well you see, furnished you see they can charge
               extra.
Stuart (PS02H) [1095] Norfolk Street [...] self-contained principally first
               floor flat, two bedrooms furnished two eighty.
Ann (PS02G)    [1096] I wouldn't want a furnished one now.
Stuart (PS02H) [1097] No, of course not.
               [1098] But ... as I say
Ann (PS02G)    [1099] I know they are expensive.
               [1100] Which is why I [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1101] Two sixty [...] two eighty which is the same price as
               [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1102] which, which is why now er that Rose and Jean when they
               considered it.
               [1103] Mum said how about renting one in Wisbech but I said well
               if she can't afford a mortgage you can't afford to rent one.
               [1104] Not anything that's ... worth living in.
Stuart (PS02H) [1105] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [1106] [...] fifty quid a week ones are er forty pound a week
               and so on.
               [1107] You gets what you pay for ... which nowadays isn't a lot,
               not for that money.
               [1108] You know when I asked, was gonna have ... er on Lynn Road
               there what was that fifty a ... fifty a week?
               [1109] I mean it was
Stuart (PS02H) [1110] Fifty or fifty five weren't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1111] it was ... clean but that's about all you could say.
Stuart (PS02H) [1112] Is that the one Ann is in now?
               [1113] Or in that area.
Ann (PS02G)    [1114] I don't know where Ann is.
               [1115] No I think she's down Victoria Road somewhere.
               [1116] She won't tell anybody.
               [1117] But I think she lives somewhere down Victoria Road.
               [1118] ... I don't know.
               [1119] She's only in a bedsit.
Stuart (PS02H) [1120] Yeah.
               [1121] But I mean you see her up town though.
Ann (PS02G)    [1122] I know.
               [1123] That's cos she's lonely and she just wanders about.
               [1124] She gets up
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1125] don't want to stay in the bedsit.
               [1126] One room ... [...] she she shares a bathroom and kitchen.
               [1127] She just goes for a walk.
               [1128] I mean she's seeing people and ...
Stuart (PS02H) [1129] Yeah but I mean the times I've seen her it's been this
               end of town rather than that end of town.
               [1130] Which has made, which which just makes me think
Ann (PS02G)    [1131] I don't really, I just presume she lives down Victoria
               Road somewhere but I don't really know.
Stuart (PS02H) [1132] And she walks to work.
Ann (PS02G)    [1133] She couldn't do any other.
               [1134] She hasn't got a vehicle, she can't afford one.
Stuart (PS02H) [1135] No no.
               [1136] But that just makes me think why, that's what makes me
               think she's living [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [1137] She could be.
               [1138] [clears throat] But that weren't a bedsitter that I was
               in [...] .
               [1139] Shared bathroom but I
Stuart (PS02H) [1140] No [...] but yeah
Ann (PS02G)    [1141] but it was a kitchen and bedroom and living room.
               [1142] They're only tiny like an alcove bedroom but
Stuart (PS02H) [1143] Oh yeah I've been in one of them.
               [1144] You know I've seen them.
Ann (PS02G)    [1145] I mean it was the only one with a ... with its own
               kitchen.
               [1146] The one that I was gonna have.
Stuart (PS02H) [1147] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1148] This was right up the top and there were ... a tiny attic
               bedroom thing was made into a ... not very salubrious but it had
               a cooker and a sink.
Stuart (PS02H) [1149] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1150] [clears throat] ... And as I say that was fifty or
               something a week and it wasn't ... wasn't worth it really.
Stuart (PS02H) [1151] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [1152] Furniture wasn't that posh but then er but the only thing
               I thought about it was safe and it was clean.
               [1153] Needed a bit of personalizing but it was ... it was old-
               fashioned furniture but it was polished.
               [1154] It was clean.
               [1155] Had a reasonable carpet on the floor and, and so on.
Stuart (PS02H) [1156] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1157] But it wasn't worth fifty pound a week.
               [1158] ... Definitely not.
Stuart (PS02H) [1159] But that's what they're going for though isn't it?
               [1160] If they can get them for that [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1161] [...] people do [...] .
               [1162] People are desperate to buy and they'll have whatever and
               they have to pay.
Stuart (PS02H) [1163] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1164] When you think that one ... [...] what was thirty three
               thousand two hundred and sixty a month or something wasn't it?
               [1165] Well that's gonna be about two hundred and forty, two
               hundred and fifty a month for that one down [...] .
               [1166] [clears throat] Cos thirty three worked out two sixty
               didn't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [1167] Oh the mortgage you mean?
Ann (PS02G)    [1168] Mortgage.
               [1169] So you can say two hundred and fifty pound a month to buy
               a place.
Stuart (PS02H) [1170] Oh yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1171] And yet they want two eighty to rent one.
               [1172] ... Seems quite ridiculous.
Stuart (PS02H) [1173] Well that's if you're prepared to ... buy a flat.
               [1174] ... That's the only thing isn't it?
               [1175] If you're prepared to buy a flat.
Ann (PS02G)    [1176] Yeah but at least you've got, actually got the property
               haven't you?
               [1177] You're not just paying somebody else to have a ... Cos if
               you're moving if you can't sell it you can always rent it again.
               [1178] Which is what a lot of people are doing [...] ... houses
               especially.
               [1179] They buy a house cos they've had a child or something.
               [1180] They can't afford to ... they can't sell that one so they
               rent that out which pays the mortgage for it and start again on
               another mortgage.
Stuart (PS02H) [1181] You've got to be a bit careful when you're renting out
               though.
Ann (PS02G)    [1182] Oh yes.
               [1183] Got to be careful of your tenants.
               [1184] [...] pay.
Stuart (PS02H) [1185] Tenants.
Ann (PS02G)    [1186] That's why it's best to go through an agency or er
               something like White and Eddies because they have people that
               collect them and they have people who have to take up references
               and [clears throat]
Stuart (PS02H) [1187] Yeah but not only that but I mean if you
Ann (PS02G)    [1188] And they have they have proper leases.
               [1189] I mean after that they're out and
Stuart (PS02H) [1190] Yeah ... .
               [1191] well I mean all, all well it counts towards your income
               as well.
Ann (PS02G)    [1192] Oh yeah I know.
               [1193] ... Oh yeah income tax on it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1194] Counts counts towards your income.
Ann (PS02G)    [1195] But a lot of people are doing it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1196] Mm.
               [1197] ... Oh I know.
               [1198] Well there's [...] for one.
               [1199] [...] sell [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1200] Lot of people are doing it because they just can't ...
               well circumstances.
               [1201] It's either the job or something means they've gotta go
               away or ... they can't afford, they can't sell them so they ...
               [...] I don't know if that would make your income different if
               you were still paying a mortgage [...] .
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1202] Even though your, all the money
Stuart (PS02H) [1203] Think [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1204] you were getting in was getting paid out again?
Stuart (PS02H) [1205] I think you'll find it counts towards your income.
               [1206] So I mean if you had a job ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1207] Paying them more tax.
Stuart (PS02H) [1208] You, you got a job say you're earning
Ann (PS02G)    [1209] But I think the expenses when you're
Stuart (PS02H) [1210] earning ten thousand a year.
               [1211] And you're going, you're getting two hundred and fifty
               pound a month ... as well in rent
Ann (PS02G)    [1212] Yeah but you, you'd be able to claim expenses.
Stuart (PS02H) [1213] I think so, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1214] You wouldn't pay the whole of it taxable if it was ...
               you know you would claim expenses for one thing and another.
Stuart (PS02H) [1215] Oh I don't know but I mean I wouldn't have thought so.
               [1216] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1217] Otherwise ... probably that's why they are dear because
               they have to do things like that. [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1218] That's probably why they're the price they are, two
               eighty.
Ann (PS02G)    [1219] That's it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1220] Because people take [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1221] Pay fifty and thirty quid a week more is a bloody what
               they get stopped off them. [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [1222] [...] and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina.
               [1223] ... And to pay off the mortgage they've got to charge so
               much [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1224] I mean Tina's got that little house .
               [1225] I mean now you'd get it two hundred and fi , I mean Tina
               pays two hundred and forty eight er pound a week, a month.
               [1226] Three hundred and forty eight pound a month mortgage on
               that little house.
Stuart (PS02H) [1227] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1228] I mean that was bloody thirty nine thousand, or was it
               forty one when she had it.
               [1229] It was
Stuart (PS02H) [1230] I know.
Ann (PS02G)    [1231] forty one I think.
               [1232] I mean now they're going for thirty two.
               [1233] We can afford one like that.
Stuart (PS02H) [1234] Yeah we could [...] isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1235] Mm.
               [1236] ... They don't sell now.
               [1237] Not selling at all.
               [1238] There's a few renting now cos they can't sell them.
               [1239] ... So ... It's a nice enough little house but ... I'm
               not awfully keen on it are you?
Stuart (PS02H) [1240] I don't like the, I don't like the bedroom
Ann (PS02G)    [1241] No I don't
Stuart (PS02H) [1242] situation for one.
Ann (PS02G)    [1243] If it had a door and a wall and
Stuart (PS02H) [1244] You're just straight upstairs and you fall into bed.
Ann (PS02G)    [1245] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [1246] Handy I suppose but
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [1247] [laughing] In some respects but [] ... I mean it just
               doesn't ... I mean in a way I suppose well with Tina being a non
               smoker and Wiggie being a non smoker
Ann (PS02G)    [1248] It's not so bad.
Stuart (PS02H) [1249] isn't so bad but, I mean if you're like us and I mean the
               smoke's just
Ann (PS02G)    [1250] That's it.
               [1251] That's why Tina doesn't like people smoking in her house
               because it gets into her bedroom.
Stuart (PS02H) [1252] Yes.
               [1253] Exactly.
               [1254] The smoke would just rise straight up and
Ann (PS02G)    [1255] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1256] straight up into the bedroom.
               [1257] I mean she doesn't smoke anyway so I mean you know
Ann (PS02G)    [1258] She doesn't like people smoking in her house.
               [1259] Because she says I don't want my bedroom smelling of
               smoke, her sheets and ... everything else. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [1260] She would do [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1261] Mind you they have done a bit more to it since Wiggie's
               been there in as much as she's had a big curtain put across
Stuart (PS02H) [1262] Oh yeah.
               [1263] Across the top of the stairs like or [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1264] All the way across.
               [1265] Because Steve couldn't sleep.
Stuart (PS02H) [1266] Because of the light in that little
Ann (PS02G)    [1267] Because it's light.
               [1268] See you'd even the patio door light went
Stuart (PS02H) [1269] Straight upstairs.
Ann (PS02G)    [1270] straight upstairs.
Stuart (PS02H) [1271] And that
Ann (PS02G)    [1272] Because he's, and then
Stuart (PS02H) [1273] skylight [...] .
               [1274] Mm yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1275] skylight .
               [1276] He's had a blind put up ... a special blind that leads
               straight across the fanlight.
               [1277] And she's had curtains ... big track put across so that
               sh
Stuart (PS02H) [1278] She can shut it off.
Ann (PS02G)    [1279] she can shut it right off.
               [1280] She couldn't, she just wasn't sleeping.
               [1281] Said was broad daylight.
Stuart (PS02H) [1282] Mhm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1283] She said oh he ... you know we've had all that done.
               [1284] Tracked across the ceiling so that ... shut the [...]
               off.
               [1285] ... She said he just couldn't sleep in there.
Stuart (PS02H) [1286] With the light.
Ann (PS02G)    [1287] With all the lights and ... daylight and sunshine through
               the bloody ... thing and ... It was alright once he got off but
               he had a job getting off when it was
Stuart (PS02H) [1288] Mm mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1289] as I say when it was sunlight shining through the bloody
               thing on his face.
               [1290] ... Mm they've had a special, they had a skylight blind
               made .
Stuart (PS02H) [1291] Mm mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1292] They couldn't have an ordinary one cos it would hang
               down.
               [1293] ... Has to be on a runners on the side as well otherwise
               it would ... just fall down.
Stuart (PS02H) [1294] Side yeah so it [...] fall [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1295] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1296] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1297] It's got a, you know like a frame what you put in ...
               along.
Stuart (PS02H) [1298] Like a venetian blind in a way [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [1299] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [1300] Or a straight down blind but at an angle ... but er but
               on runners to hold, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1301] But it's got runners to hold the side in you see?
Stuart (PS02H) [1302] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1303] I mean [...] but Steven would but
Stuart (PS02H) [1304] Do they owe [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1305] [...] the building society and erm
Stuart (PS02H) [1306] [...] the building society.
               [1307] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1308] They'll have to pay another mortgage as well.
Stuart (PS02H) [1309] Yeah but on the ... yeah but I mean if she ... sold it
               for thirty two ... she'd still owe them nine thousand wouldn't
               she?
Ann (PS02G)    [1310] Well she must have paid a bit off.
               [1311] She's been in there about three years.
Stuart (PS02H) [1312] Yeah.
               [1313] Well say she owes them nine thousand anyway.
Ann (PS02G)    [1314] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1315] But then er if they wanted another mortgage it would be
Ann (PS02G)    [1316] That would be added to it you see.
Stuart (PS02H) [1317] They'd probably have a fifty thousand pound mortgage ...
               to pay off the ... the existing mortgage on that one and the
               balance.
               [1318] I mean they can afford it between them.
Ann (PS02G)    [1319] Well I don't know, I mean Steve must pay about eighty
               pounds a bloody week.
Stuart (PS02H) [1320] Oh yeah of course Steven and his maintenance.
               [1321] Maintenance.
Ann (PS02G)    [1322] Maintenance and one thing and another.
Stuart (PS02H) [1323] Yeah.
               [1324] ... Yeah that would cut it down wouldn't it? [...] on
               their own you can say they'd be able to afford it but if you
               consider the outgoings as well eighty pound a
Ann (PS02G)    [1325] Mind you saying that, three hundred fifty ... pound a
               month to buy a bigger mortgage anyway.
               [1326] ... Nowadays.
Stuart (PS02H) [1327] For the interest rate yeah, but it would only buy the
               same sort of mortgage that Tina's got on it already.
Ann (PS02G)    [1328] Yeah well that's what I mean.
               [1329] They could have bought, afford a
Stuart (PS02H) [1330] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1331] a a better property for about forty four thousand or
               whatever for the same money.
               [1332] Cos that's how it's worked out.
Stuart (PS02H) [1333] No cos she still owes, if she sold it she'd still owe the
               balance between the selling price and
Ann (PS02G)    [1334] Yeah so she's got to buy a cheaper one and that would be
               added to it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1335] That would be added to it you see.
Ann (PS02G)    [1336] Mm and just his wages how much extra they could afford.
Stuart (PS02H) [1337] That's it.
Ann (PS02G)    [1338] I know Steven would like [...] .
Stuart (PS02H) [1339] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1340] He'd like one with a spare bedroom so the children can
               come and stop.
               [1341] I mean Tina's worried now, she's got his mother coming
               for christmas for a fortnight.
               [1342] ... Don't know where the hell she'll sleep, she's got to
               sleep in the living room.
Stuart (PS02H) [1343] Mm.
               [1344] [...] ... But that's about fifty [...] isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1345] Fifty two [...] probably get the fifty.
Stuart (PS02H) [1346] As I say you're looking at a
Ann (PS02G)    [1347] Hefty mortgage.
               [1348] Tina reckons out of her wages she's got ninety [...] ,
               ninety six pound a week ... out of her wages ... just for
               mortgage and
Stuart (PS02H) [1349] Expenses.
Ann (PS02G)    [1350] expenses.
               [1351] That's gone before she starts. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [1352] And then out of Wiggie's he's got
Ann (PS02G)    [1353] Seventy five I think he pays.
               [1354] ... It's a lot of money gone before you've even [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1355] Mhm before you even start.
               [1356] [...] ... Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1357] Depends what you want most don't it I suppose?
Stuart (PS02H) [1358] Mm mm.
               [1359] That's true.
Ann (PS02G)    [1360] She'd like to change the car.
               [1361] I mean she never liked that car.
               [1362] Ever.
               [1363] She had a nice car before Chris made her have that more
               or less.
               [1364] She didn't want it.
               [1365] She hated it at first, she wouldn't drive it.
               [1366] ... Noisy and clumsy, she didn't like it at all.
               [1367] She never has really.
Stuart (PS02H) [1368] It's not it's not a bad car is it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1369] She doesn't like it.
               [1370] Never been happy with it.
               [1371] Never.
               [1372] It was Chris's idea to have the ... diesel one and that
               model.
               [1373] He ... talked her into it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1374] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1375] But ... she hated it at first.
               [1376] ... She'd do anything rather than drive it at first.
               [1377] ... I don't know what she had before but it was a
Stuart (PS02H) [1378] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1379] Mind you it was quite old.
               [1380] I think it was a car that she'd had for ... was well
               looked after her dad used to see to it for her but it was ...
               she'd had it for some years and she was always poodling about in
               you see.
               [1381] ... And it was her second car that she'd ever had sort of
               thing.
Stuart (PS02H) [1382] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1383] She'd had it five or six years or something like that.
               [1384] ... You know, think it was about ten year old when she
               got rid of it.
               [1385] Something like that.
Stuart (PS02H) [1386] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1387] But, say it was a lovely little car really.
               [1388] ... And she hated that.
Stuart (PS02H) [1389] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [1390] Times she used to go [...] really hate it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1391] [laugh] ... Yeah if that one, that Elizabeth Terrace one
               is, is the one I think it is ... which is the one fairly near
               the end ... in that in that bottom, bottom row ... I think the
               live in the first one, they still live in the first one ... on
               the corner.
               [1392] I'm not sure if they've moved actually now.
               [1393] They may have done.
               [1394] Got a funny feeling they have now.
               [1395] But [...] ... Who's that?
Ann (PS02G)    [1396] Paper man.
Stuart (PS02H) [1397] Bloody hell. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1398] Morning.
Stuart (PS02H) [1399] Did somebody kick you out of bed this morning Brian?
Brian (PS02J)  [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1400] Thank you very much.
               [1401] Thankyou.
               [1402] Bubye.
Stuart (PS02H) [1403] Thought somebody must have kicked him out of bed this
               morning.
               [1404] Only half half past ten.
Ann (PS02G)    [1405] [...] quarter past ten. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [1406] That ain't bad.
               [1407] Got the time to have a quick look at the paper now
               haven't we?
Ann (PS02G)    [1408] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1409] [...] The Standard?
Ann (PS02G)    [1410] I don't mind.
Stuart (PS02H) [1411] Oh [...] mind at all
*** 7 (Tape 018207) ***
Ann (PS02G)    [1412] And if we make an appointment to view some places and
               then we'll know what time we've got to doing the shopping and
               fit it in round taking mum.
               [1413] Seeing mum.
Stuart (PS02H) [1414] [...] something erm next week.
Ann (PS02G)    [1415] So you don't fancy this afternoon?
Stuart (PS02H) [1416] In the morning.
               [1417] Oh yeah well ... yeah I mean if if they if
Ann (PS02G)    [1418] Cos as I say if we did see Sefton Avenue or New Drove
               today.
Stuart (PS02H) [1419] If there's nothing available.
               [1420] That's what I meant.
Ann (PS02G)    [1421] Oh yeah, there's plenty of time.
               [1422] ... I don't really want to go on a Saturday.
               [1423] [...] Saturday afternoons with mum. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [1424] [...] Saturday afternoons with Helen.
Ann (PS02G)    [1425] [...] well I wouldn't be absolutely ... if, if I had to
               go out then I'd have to go out.
               [1426] ... Then there's always Saturday morning [...] see Helen
               but then Stuart likes to sleep in.
               [1427] [laugh] But no I think Saturday's out really.
               [1428] It's not a day for viewing houses.
               [1429] ... We could go out Sunday?
               [1430] And mum could come as well.
Stuart (PS02H) [1431] I don't know whether they work [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1432] [...] Oh yes.
               [1433] People at work all the week don't they?
Stuart (PS02H) [1434] Yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [1435] Gets dark in the evenings then then then ... definitely.
               [1436] That's the only time you can view a property.
               [1437] I mean unless somebody's living in it you can't go in the
               evenings in the winter can you?
               [1438] And I don't ... fancy a house that somebody's actually
               living in.
               [1439] Cos then you've got ta wait while they
Stuart (PS02H) [1440] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1441] And it can all fall through because theirs is falling
               through or they can't get out when you want and ... that can go
               on for ... Can it not?
Stuart (PS02H) [1442] Yeah. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1443] Sometimes it just can't be helped cos there's nothing ...
               in your price range you know that you like that ... isn't empty
               but ... I would prefer ... an empty property so that when we
               decide and then whatever just [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1444] Certainly if we'd see something that would do this
               afternoon, or [...] New Drove [...] today, that's fine.
Stuart (PS02H) [1445] No problem. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1446] Two of them at New Drove are downstairs and one is an
               upstairs.
               [1447] The one upstairs, because it hasn't got a bay window
Stuart (PS02H) [1448] Yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [1449] is larger.
               [1450] ... The upstairs one is slightly larger.
Stuart (PS02H) [1451] The upstairs one's larger? [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1452] [...] number seven which is an upstairs one ... hasn't
               got any bay windows.
               [1453] It is ... larger than the two five and six that are
               downstairs.
Stuart (PS02H) [1454] Who's selling that one?
Ann (PS02G)    [1455] Well one's Cornerstone.
               [1456] One's Cornerstone
Stuart (PS02H) [1457] So one's Cornerstone and two are the other [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1458] Two are Hansard
Stuart (PS02H) [1459] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1460] I think it's Cornerstone one that's ... the larger of the
               two, the three.
               [1461] ... Six ... seven.
               [1462] Hansard.
Stuart (PS02H) [1463] Hansard.
Ann (PS02G)    [1464] They're doing five and seven so they've got one above
               each other.
Stuart (PS02H) [1465] So they've got ... one ... one's doing two and one's
               doing one.
Ann (PS02G)    [1466] One's doing five and seven which is ... this is for two
               and one's doing six which is this one.
Stuart (PS02H) [1467] Yeah. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1468] Seven is definitely slightly bigger than six and five.
               [1469] ... I checked it out.
               [1470] The lounge is fourteen by ten.
               [1471] ... The bedroom is thirteen nine by nine [...] instead of
               eleven by eight.
               [1472] ... That kitchen's thirteen by five, that totals eleven
               by seven.
Stuart (PS02H) [1473] Neither here nor there is it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1474] No.
               [1475] None of it's much difference.
               [1476] It's only a diff er it's a matter of two feet here and
Stuart (PS02H) [1477] Yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [1478] But then I don't mind [...] .
               [1479] I don't mind living upstairs or on the ground.
               [1480] Well I mean if they've got the key to both might ...
               haven't decided on both of them you might as well go and see
               them.
Stuart (PS02H) [1481] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1482] Both of them.
               [1483] See which one you like the best or if you like them at
               all.
               [1484] ... But as it's ... got that financial package
Stuart (PS02H) [1485] That's Cornerstone?
Ann (PS02G)    [1486] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1487] Don't know whether the same applies to the other two.
Ann (PS02G)    [1488] [...] it.
               [1489] The financial package [...] .
Stuart (PS02H) [1490] With Cornerstone?
Ann (PS02G)    [1491] [...] Cornerstone.
Stuart (PS02H) [1492] Doesn't actually say that in ... Pantiles
Ann (PS02G)    [1493] No
Stuart (PS02H) [1494] Oh.
               [1495] Just have to ask [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [1496] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1497] But actually the one at Cornerstone is fifty pound
               cheaper than the both of them at Hansard.
Stuart (PS02H) [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [1498] It is!
Stuart (PS02H) [1499] Fifty pound.
Ann (PS02G)    [1500] One's nine nine fifty and one's nine nine
Stuart (PS02H) [1501] [...] five, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1502] So it's forty five pound different. [laugh] [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1503] Well that's a good way, if you think about it he's got,
               he's got four flats there ... hasn't he?
Ann (PS02G)    [1504] Oh yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1505] Four flats at thirty thousand.
               [1506] That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses.
               [1507] They could be sixty thousand apiece.
Ann (PS02G)    [1508] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1509] Whereas if he had, if he sold them as separate houses
               he'd probably get forty thousand apiece.
Ann (PS02G)    [1510] Yeah that's just [...] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1511] Forty five thousand even apiece.
Ann (PS02G)    [1512] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1513] But he's making the money by selling them as flats.
Ann (PS02G)    [1514] Yeah.
               [1515] The only difference is he's had a few thousand extra
               because it's got two kitchens and two bathrooms.
               [1516] [...] partitions and
Stuart (PS02H) [1517] Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings.
Ann (PS02G)    [1518] But apart from that oh an extra bath instead of the other
               bedroom
Stuart (PS02H) [1519] Yeah.
               [1520] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1521] and erm another kitchen instead of a dining room or
               something and that's the only difference.
               [1522] Say three four thousand probably.
               [1523] For the extra bits and pieces that's all.
Stuart (PS02H) [1524] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1525] I don't know how many of them there are.
               [1526] ... Whether they only had four flats or whether there's a
               ... flat on another block and another block of fours down the
               road.
               [1527] I mean I don't know.
Stuart (PS02H) [1528] Only assume there's ... you've got that one block.
Ann (PS02G)    [1529] Well there might be ... four blocks of four or ... I du n
               no.
Stuart (PS02H) [1530] No I don't think so.
               [1531] Not enough space for them.
Ann (PS02G)    [1532] No I don't know.
               [1533] I mean you know the area better than me.
Stuart (PS02H) [1534] Unless they've knocked them garages down or something
               [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1535] I've no idea [...] .
               [1536] I know them council houses aren't usually [...] but I
               mean I can't visualize how much land there is.
               [1537] ... I only know that by going to school and ... [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1538] Yeah. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1539] [...] where they are. ... [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1540] Yeah. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1541] Probably should have gone the other way into town but
Stuart (PS02H) [1542] [...] that
Ann (PS02G)    [1543] Eh?
Stuart (PS02H) [1544] Neither here nor there. [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1545] Well you could have gone sort of like round the Rainbow
               and ... that way on.
               [1546] That's what I meant.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1547] [...] the bypass [...] that end of town ... would have
               been perhaps a little bit clearer.
Stuart (PS02H) [1548] [...] If you look at the first it might help you to
               decide whether you like
Ann (PS02G)    [1549] That's it.
               [1550] Whether you wanna go and see it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1551] Whether you wanna go and see them or not.
               [1552] Whether you like the positions.
Ann (PS02G)    [1553] I mean we know where Sefton Avenue is and we know that's
Stuart (PS02H) [1554] Well we know where it is.
Ann (PS02G)    [1555] a nice house. [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [1556] Well we don't know really.
               [1557] We haven't seen it have we?
Ann (PS02G)    [1558] Well I mean [...] I mean
Stuart (PS02H) [1559] Yeah but we haven't actually looked ins
Ann (PS02G)    [1560] No but I mean I know which house it is with that [...]
               one, and you do don't you?
Stuart (PS02H) [1561] I think so yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [1562] Well I think so as well.
Stuart (PS02H) [1563] But it would be nice just to go and have a quick ...
               check.
Ann (PS02G)    [1564] Oh I think, just to make sure that [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1565] Just to make sure I like it.
               [1566] Or
Ann (PS02G)    [1567] it is the house that we're thinking about.
               [1568] We think it is.
Stuart (PS02H) [1569] You may not like it.
Ann (PS02G)    [1570] I said as soon as I see it in the paper oh that looks
               nice.
               [1571] Where's that?
               [1572] I mean ... not sure.
Stuart (PS02H) [1573] [...] is it?
               [1574] Or is this the one round the other end?
Ann (PS02G)    [1575] It's that one.
Stuart (PS02H) [1576] It's up here.
               [1577] That one there right on the corner yeah?
Ann (PS02G)    [1578] Yes.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1579] That's it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1580] I thought there was a separate [...] but it's not, no
               it's not is it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1581] Think it is.
Stuart (PS02H) [1582] It's an older property.
               [1583] Got the double glazing.
               [1584] ... Alright.
Ann (PS02G)    [1585] [...] ... Looks nice.
               [1586] Nice house though isn't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [1587] Yeah it's an older, more solid house.
Ann (PS02G)    [1588] You know sometimes I like as I say they've got
Stuart (PS02H) [1589] Yeah.
               [1590] Yeah Yeah true.
               [1591] Very true.
Ann (PS02G)    [1592] they've got erm
Stuart (PS02H) [1593] Very true.
Ann (PS02G)    [1594] Yeah it's a nice house. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1595] And this is a back, the back door [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1596] Oh I see.
               [1597] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1598] this one because you, there's the back view look I mean
               that's ... that's a back door isn't it?
               [1599] So you have the downstairs back and the the front stairs
               go up to the ... can't actually see [...] ... That's definitely
               the back door.
Stuart (PS02H) [1600] There's a parking space as well.
Ann (PS02G)    [1601] Oh yeah it says allotted parking space. ...
*** 8 (Tape 018301) ***
Ann (PS02G)    [1602] We have made him an offer but he's not very keen.
None (PS6TB)   [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1603] I don't think, I don't think he will.
               [1604] He's not like that.
None (PS6TB)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1605] It looks as if he's not very keen on the price we want to
               pay.
               [1606] He said he knows the market's low and he'd rather wait.
               [1607] But then we wouldn't be able to afford it if the market
               goes up and ... [laugh]
None (PS6TB)   [1608] That's right.
               [1609] [...] same time [...] .
Stuart (PS02H) [1610] If it's on, if it's on the market for a long while.
               [1611] ... He can have it on the market for a year or so.
None (PS6TB)   [1612] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1613] And he's and he's
None (PS6TB)   [1614] He's got you there and [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1615] Well at the moment he's got us
Ann (PS02G)    [1616] Well that's it.
               [1617] I mean we're paying two hundred and fifty pound a month
               so at least he's getting that coming in.
               [1618] But then you can really have a mortgage for that. [laugh]

None (PS6TB)   [1619] [...] and the thing is as well [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1620] No.
               [1621] But at the moment he's ... well he's not come back to us
               with any answer from our offer at all so ... we're we're
               presuming that means no so we thought we'd better start looking.
               [laugh]
None (PS6TB)   [1622] Oh and if you're paying that kind of money you could
               afford a mortgage couldn't you?
Ann (PS02G)    [1623] That's it.
Stuart (PS02H) [1624] Thereabouts anyway.
None (PS6TB)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1625] Yeah it's it's not much more.
               [1626] And Stuart's been and enquired and it wouldn't be much
               more for a small property.
None (PS6TB)   [1627] When the market lifts then you'd [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [1628] That's it.
*** 9 (Tape 018302) ***
Ann (PS02G)    [1629] There's not a lot more in here is there?
               [1630] [laugh] ... There's a bedroom, it's very [...]
Jill (PS02K)   [1631] They don't make them any more do they?
Ann (PS02G)    [1632] No. ...
Jill (PS02K)   [1633] They call this the bedroom do they, or ... ?
Stuart (PS02H) [1634] Yeah.
               [1635] I mean it's quite a good
Ann (PS02G)    [1636] This bedroom's got the bay window.
               [1637] They've got security locks [...] same as ours.
Stuart (PS02H) [1638] Security locks like ... like we've like we've got at
               home.
               [1639] Yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [1640] Yeah.

Stuart (PS02H) [1644] Don't think [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1645] No.
Jill (PS02K)   [1646] Quite like the ceilings.
               [1647] They're different aren't they?
Ann (PS02G)    [1648] Yeah, mm.
Jill (PS02K)   [1649] Quite pretty.

               [1653] I don't know what other colours they had [...] .
               [1654] But it's ... reasonably good quality.
               [1655] ... There's an airing cupboard [...] ... Probably got a
               dead body in there.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Jill (PS02K)   [1656] I watch too many mysteries don't I?
Ann (PS02G)    [1657] [...] ... Cooker goes in there and the washing machine in
               there.
Stuart (PS02H) [1658] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1659] Nowhere for a fridge.
               [1660] Well you'd have to have it sticking out [...] round.
Stuart (PS02H) [1661] This is a bit silly isn't it?
               [1662] Not having any room for a fridge anywhere.
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1663] The cooker would have go in there and the washing machine
               in there.
Stuart (PS02H) [1664] Washing machine in there.
Ann (PS02G)    [1665] No fridge.
Jill (PS02K)   [1666] No he hasn't thought about it very well has he? ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1667] I'm afraid it would have to be sticking out. [...]
Jill (PS02K)   [1668] Is it, is it a tall fridge?
               [1669] Or is it just an ordinary worktop one?
Ann (PS02G)    [1670] No just an ordinary fridge.
Stuart (PS02H) [1671] There isn't a fridge. [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [1672] Well there will be .
               [1673] Just an ordinary one.
Jill (PS02K)   [1674] [...] what the other ones are like.
Stuart (PS02H) [1675] Unless you, unless you get the fridge in the [...]
               cupboard.
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1676] Oh this is just exactly the same only the other way
               round.
Stuart (PS02H) [1677] Same, the same but opposite.
Ann (PS02G)    [1678] Yeah.
               [1679] [...] in the cupboard [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1680] Oh yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Jill (PS02K)   [1681] Oh that's [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1682] [...] It hasn't got a sink in this one.
Stuart (PS02H) [1683] It hasn't got a toilet either.
Ann (PS02G)    [1684] Or toilet.
               [1685] It's all been [laugh]
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1686] Er actually [...] it has been broken into, this one.
Jill (PS02K)   [1687] Oh no.
Ann (PS02G)    [1688] We looked at it outside and and the window
Stuart (PS02H) [1689] It looks like it yeah. [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1690] at the back there is broken.
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1691] [...] somebody's been helping themselves.
Jill (PS02K)   [1692] [...] fire alarms keep [...] though don't they? [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [1693] Number seven.
               [1694] This is the [...] .
Jill (PS02K)   [1695] [...] ?
Ann (PS02G)    [1696] Yeah.
               [1697] ... Yeah you see ... [...] your washing machine.

Stuart (PS02H) [1699] Oh I see.
               [1700] This is different isn't it?
Jill (PS02K)   [1701] Yeah.
               [1702] Got a bit more space.
Ann (PS02G)    [1703] Yeah.
               [1704] See you could have your cooker one side and your washing
               machine and fridge, washing machine under there and fridge
               there.
Jill (PS02K)   [1705] So what you've achieved is this piece over the stairs.
Ann (PS02G)    [1706] Yeah.
               [1707] Mm.
               [1708] I said the one upstairs was bigger.
Stuart (PS02H) [1709] Yes.
               [1710] You said it was bigger didn't you?
               [1711] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1712] I was reading the things and I said it was a bigger ...
               upstairs is, are bigger than the downstairs.
Jill (PS02K)   [1713] It's better cos the other one's a little bit of an alley
               isn't it, the kitchen?
Ann (PS02G)    [1714] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1715] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1716] It's quite pleasant that is.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1717] Yeah you see it's bigger cos the bedroom
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1718] is a bigger bed bigger room altogether.
Jill (PS02K)   [1719] Goodness.
               [1720] What a difference.
Stuart (PS02H) [1721] Oh there is a difference.
               [1722] No this is the living room.
Jill (PS02K)   [1723] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1724] This is the living room here.
(PS001)        [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1725] Yeah that's right.
               [1726] This is the bedroom.
Jill (PS02K)   [1727] But even so
Ann (PS02G)    [1728] But even the bedroom's bigger.
Stuart (PS02H) [1729] Oh crikey that's a big bedroom too isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1730] It's bigger.
               [1731] Most definitely.
Stuart (PS02H) [1732] Yeah I said [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1733] So you'd have [...]
Jill (PS02K)   [1734] It's a lot better.
               [1735] Yeah.
               [1736] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1737] I could tell by the ... you know the details
Stuart (PS02H) [1738] Financial [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1739] it just seemed that
Stuart (PS02H) [1740] Yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [1741] The way they were reading.
Ann (PS02G)    [1742] Yeah the way it was reading.
               [1743] I said to Stuart I'm sure
Jill (PS02K)   [1744] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1745] the upstairs is bigger [...] .
               [1746] He said that can't be.
               [1747] But you've got the hall and that underneath you see.
Jill (PS02K)   [1748] Yeah it's the landing and everything.
Stuart (PS02H) [1749] Underneath us yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [1750] Yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [1751] It would be quite pleasant up here.
Ann (PS02G)    [1752] Yeah.
               [1753] I like this one, I don't like the downstairs one so much.
Stuart (PS02H) [1754] No I like this much more.
Jill (PS02K)   [1755] What colour's the bathroom?
Stuart (PS02H) [1756] [...] the bathroom's even nice.
Ann (PS02G)    [1757] It is isn't it?

Jill (PS02K)   [1763] What's [...] this little cupboard?

Jill (PS02K)   [1765] Yeah.
               [1766] You could put your hoover and ironing board in that.
Ann (PS02G)    [1767] Yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [1768] Cos they don't think of those things do they? [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [1769] No they never do, do they?
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1770] Yeah I prefer this one to downstairs.
               [1771] It's much better.
Stuart (PS02H) [1772] I do.
               [1773] ... I do.
               [1774] Yeah.

Ann (PS02G)    [1777] rubbish [laugh] .
               [1778] ... Well that one actually's not advertized so it might
               have gone.
Jill (PS02K)   [1779] Oh. [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [1780] [...] we've only seen ... well we've seen advertized

Jill (PS02K)   [1783] Oh right.
               [1784] That wasn't ...
Ann (PS02G)    [1785] well there's no details in
Jill (PS02K)   [1786] That's probably sold then because if I had a choice of
               four ... I would take the upstairs one wouldn't you? [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1787] Yes.
               [1788] [...] said.
Stuart (PS02H) [1789] Yeah.

Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1810] Yeah that other one was a bit narrow and
Jill (PS02K)   [1811] [...] a bit more elbow room.
Ann (PS02G)    [1812] Yeah.
               [1813] I like this one.
Stuart (PS02H) [1814] Yeah I do.
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1815] I definitely much prefer this one.
               [1816] And I say the rooms are bigger as well.
Jill (PS02K)   [1817] Yeah, it's a good size.
Stuart (PS02H) [1818] Yes they are.
               [1819] Oh yes I definitely like the upstairs to the downstairs.
Jill (PS02K)   [1820] And what number's this?
Stuart (PS02H) [1821] Seven.
Ann (PS02G)    [1822] Seven.
               [1823] Mm.

Ann (PS02G)    [1833] Yeah.
               [1834] I definitely [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1835] That that [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1836] Yeah that's, when I was reading the thing I said to you
               somehow the upstairs seemed much better.
Stuart (PS02H) [1837] Yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [1838] Cos it's quite a big [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [1839] It is.
               [1840] It is a nice size bedroom.
Jill (PS02K)   [1841] Have you got
Ann (PS02G)    [1842] Yes.
Jill (PS02K)   [1843] wardrobes and dressing tables?
               [1844] So you'd [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [1845] Mm.
Jill (PS02K)   [1846] Quite pleasant view as well.
Ann (PS02G)    [1847] It is, that's it.
               [1848] It's not likely to be over ... well actually I don't we
               don't know if they're gonna be building there.
Stuart (PS02H) [1849] Well I think you'll I think you'll find you'll get
               buildings
Ann (PS02G)    [1850] Eventually.
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1851] eventually round the back.
Jill (PS02K)   [1852] It would be a good start wouldn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [1853] Yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [1854] Especially if you can get the right price.
Ann (PS02G)    [1855] Well I certainly, yeah, I certainly like this one. ...
Jill (PS02K)   [1856] When you say you've had [...] what sort of figures are
               looking ... well, can you achieve?
               [1857] Do you know?
Stuart (PS02H) [1858] Thirty two thousand.
Ann (PS02G)    [1859] Thirty two and a half maximum wasn't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [1860] Mm thirty two and a half at a push.
Jill (PS02K)   [1861] So really you just wanna get something as cheap as
               possible and
Ann (PS02G)    [1862] Yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1863] Cheap but nice.
Ann (PS02G)    [1864] Yeah. [laugh]
Jill (PS02K)   [1865] Cheap as possible but
Ann (PS02G)    [1866] That's it.
Jill (PS02K)   [1867] you want a bargain.
Ann (PS02G)    [1868] And this one's, as I say it's twenty nine something so I
               mean it's ... it's about right isn't it? [laugh]
Jill (PS02K)   [1869] Mm .
               [1870] Yeah and there are all sorts of ways you could [...] .
               [1871] You could either go in with [...] cash [...] .
               [1872] Do you have any deposit at all?
Stuart (PS02H) [1873] No.
Jill (PS02K)   [1874] [...] ?
Stuart (PS02H) [1875] No.
               [1876] I definitely like this one.
Jill (PS02K)   [1877] The benefit of this one as well is ... if, let's just say
               we, that you knocked him right down on his money [...] force as
               cheap a buy as possible ... then ask if you can do a hundred
               percent.
None (PS6TB)   [1878] Mm.
Jill (PS02K)   [1879] Providing ... it's [...] providing it's [...] providing
               it's not [...] damp [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1880] That's right.
Jill (PS02K)   [1881] new roofs and everything.
               [1882] I mean you'd have no problem with this.
Stuart (PS02H) [1883] No.
               [1884] None at all.
Jill (PS02K)   [1885] No problem at all, no maintenance at all .
               [1886] Right, looks good.
Ann (PS02G)    [1887] It does yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [1888] Yeah.
               [1889] Alright.
Ann (PS02G)    [1890] I definitely like this one.
Jill (PS02K)   [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [1891] Yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [1892] So we could work towards [...] to knock him right down.
               [1893] Cos then obviously when the market lifts it's then ...
               that's where you're gonna gain.

               [1910] That's all it is ... in the kitchen.

Ann (PS02G)    [2238] It's ever so nice.

Jill (PS02K)   [2247] Do you hear them at all?
None (PS6TB)   [2248] Erm ... sometimes if he's ... been out very very late and
               I'm still up and he's come home after a heavy night drinking.
               [2249] I mean I'm not saying he's alcoholic but he goes out with
               the lads and he ... you know he'll he'll sort of thud up the
               stairs.
Stuart (PS02H) [2250] Mm.
None (PS6TB)   [2251] But then he'll apologize the next day.

               [2255] [laugh] [...] this one.
Stuart (PS02H) [2256] [laugh] Oh probably, probably.
Ann (PS02G)    [2257] If he goes to the pub Stuart would probably know him
               anyway. [laugh]
Jill (PS02K)   [2258] Might do yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [2259] More than likely.
None (PS6TB)   [2260] No, I mean it it's not as if you hear the telly or
Jill (PS02K)   [2261] Oh I see, these are his stairs.
Ann (PS02G)    [2262] That's the stairway.
None (PS6TB)   [2263] That's his stairs, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [2264] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [2265] Yes.
               [2266] His door's just there isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [2267] Yeah.
None (PS6TB)   [2268] That's right, yeah that's [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
None (PS6TB)   [2269] Yes that's his door there and
Stuart (PS02H) [2270] Yeah.
None (PS6TB)   [2271] that's his stairs out.
               [2272] But the upstairs one that's ... the kitchen's a bit
               smaller.
               [2273] Erm and instead of the bath in the bathroom he's just got
               a shower up there.
Ann (PS02G)    [2274] [...] probably is [...] wardrobes there.
None (PS6TB)   [2275] I must admit I like a shower but then again I do like the
               chance to have a bath now and again
Stuart (PS02H) [2276] bath every, every now and again yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [2277] Yeah that's bigger.
None (PS6TB)   [2278] Erm which is why I went for the downstairs cos I had a
               choice of either.
               [2279] But I went for the downstairs one because of the bath.
Stuart (PS02H) [2280] Yeah, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [2281] Yeah be nice.
Stuart (PS02H) [2282] It's nice.

               upstairs and downstairs [...] .
               [2285] But the upstairs one in the other one was was
Ann (PS02G)    [2286] Was bigger than the downstairs.
Stuart (PS02H) [2287] Hell of a lot of difference really, it's surprising just
               a
None (PS6TB)   [2288] Yeah.
               [2289] I mean I must admit I've looked at some other flats.
               [2290] Erm ... and one I looked at I couldn't believe it.
               [2291] Erm ... I mean it was a top floor flat.
               [2292] And so I mean you had to sort of go up several flights of
               stairs ... and you walked in and it, it looked lovely.
               [2293] Thought oh this is nice it erm ... it ha it hadn't got a
               separate kitchen, it was sort of like ... a kitchen diner
Jill (PS02K)   [2294] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [2295] Mm.
None (PS6TB)   [2296] but it was very big.
Jill (PS02K)   [2297] A studio.
Ann (PS02G)    [2298] Mm.
None (PS6TB)   [2299] It was very big.
               [2300] I thought oh well this is lovely.
               [2301] Walks into the bedroom, well you would have hardly got
               the bed in there never mind about anything else.
               [2302] And er there was a hand basin in there ... and when you
               went into
Stuart (PS02H) [2303] In, in the bedroom?
None (PS6TB)   [2304] In the bedroom.
Stuart (PS02H) [2305] Yeah.
None (PS6TB)   [2306] When you walked into the ... well what I would call a
               cupboard but they classed it as the bathroom.
Stuart (PS02H) [laugh]
None (PS6TB)   [2307] You'd got the toilet there ... and behind the door, I
               mean you had to sort of squeeze yourself and shut the door, and
               behind the door was a shower.
Jill (PS02K)   [2308] You're joking.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
None (PS6TB)   [2309] No shower curtain mind you.
Jill (PS02K)   [2310] Even so, no room to swing a cat.
None (PS6TB)   [2311] Terrible.
               [2312] It was terrible.
Stuart (PS02H) [2313] Yes.
               [2314] This is nice though.
               [2315] I like this.

Stuart (PS02H) [2317] Very much.
None (PS6TB)   [2318] Yeah it's a nice, just a nice size.
Jill (PS02K)   [2319] Do you know who the builder is?
               [2320] It says here local [...] building.
None (PS6TB)   [2321] Erm ... well no all I know is Bates and Dack but they
               didn't actually, but I mean yeah they put it together.
Stuart (PS02H) [2322] They, they renovated it.
               [2323] They they they
None (PS6TB)   [2324] That's right yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [2325] They renovated it.
Stuart (PS02H) [2326] they re, revamped it or whatever.
Jill (PS02K)   [2327] [...] allocated parking.
               [2328] You just park in the road or?
None (PS6TB)   [2329] No, no there's the gravel down
Stuart (PS02H) [2330] There's a space down [...]
None (PS6TB)   [2331] the side is for parking.
Jill (PS02K)   [2332] Oh good.
               [2333] So you've ... got your own bit.
None (PS6TB)   [2334] Oh yeah.

               clothes out there at all? [...]
None (PS6TB)   [2337] No.
               [2338] There's no ... line.
Jill (PS02K)   [2339] Can't get over the size of this though.
               [2340] I think I'd probably put my wardrobes on his, on the
               stair wall.
               [2341] That would dampen it a bit wouldn't it? [...]
None (PS6TB)   [2342] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [2343] Nice [...] .

Ann (PS02G)    [2356] Thank you very much.
               [2357] I'm sorry to bother you. [laugh]
None (PS6TB)   [2358] If you can hear next door's music I can assure you it's
               not a regular occurrence.
               [2359] And if you tell him about it he tu , he's in a rock band.
               [2360] Erm ... now and again he practises but he usually tries
               to do it when I'm not here but erm not
Jill (PS02K)   [2361] [...] seem quite friendly then?
None (PS6TB)   [2362] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [2363] Well we, we work shifts so he could probably do it when
               we're on earlies and
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
None (PS6TB)   [2364] Well that's right yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [2365] And when we're on lates he can do it at
None (PS6TB)   [2366] Yeah if you let it, I mean you know he's fair like that.
               [2367] If you let him know.
Ann (PS02G)    [2368] We're not really in that much anyway are we?
Stuart (PS02H) [2369] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [2370] No.
               [2371] We work long hours and ...
Jill (PS02K)   [2372] Thing is don't you find in th in this sort of environment
               if you've got, you know ... if they're nice people you all
               communicate don't you?
Ann (PS02G)    [2373] Yeah, you can do things like that.
Jill (PS02K)   [2374] And that can work to your favour because if ever you have
               a problem, then you know.
Ann (PS02G)    [2375] Yeah you can talk and
Jill (PS02K)   [2376] That's right.
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
None (PS6TB)   [2377] Yeah I mean that's the same as ... I di I must admit I
               did have sort of an argument with him ... once over his music.
               [2378] We fell out for a little while but I mean, [...] playing
               loud but I mean upstairs is fine.
               [2379] And next door to him, number five ... they're an elderly
               couple erm and they've got one of their sons living there at erm
               ... he's disabled in some way but I'm not quite sure how.
Ann (PS02G)    [2380] Mm.
None (PS6TB)   [2381] But they are very very friendly.
               [2382] Very friendly they are.
(PS001)        [2383] Mm.
None (PS6TB)   [2384] I suppose some people might say to them oh you're being
               nosy but then that doesn't bother me because you don't tell them
               what you don't want them to know.
Jill (PS02K)   [2385] No.
Stuart (PS02H) [2386] That's right.
Jill (PS02K)   [2387] But it's nice because if ever you're poorly then it's in
               your welfare isn't it?

               [2395] Oh yeah.
Jill (PS02K)   [2396] No I'm really impressed.
Ann (PS02G)    [2397] It's nice isn't it?
Jill (PS02K)   [2398] Did you just want to have a little wander? ...
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [2399] Yeah.
               [2400] I like this one too.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]

Jill (PS02K)   [2402] Yeah.
               [2403] One each.

               couldn't you?
               [2424] Have it away from that [...] .
None (PS6TB)   [2425] I like them like that because what I tend to do with
               [...] so I like them that big because then I can cut them up
               into sticks, stick them in the fridge, then if I feel like being
               naughty ... [laughing] not ever so naughty because I'm nibbling
               at carrots rather than a packet of crisps or something [] .
Jill (PS02K)   [2426] But they're a nice ... aren't they?
None (PS6TB)   [2427] Oh yeah and I mean that sort of size [...]

               icing on it ... pink.
               [2690] But the pink went a bit
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Jeanie (PS02L) [2691] Well the cochineal was a bit dry so I put some water in
               and boof

Ann (PS02G)    [2696] Mm.
Jeanie (PS02L) [2697] Or there's some biscuits.
               [2698] Or there's some Ryvita.
               [2699] ... Sheila has lost three and a half pounds this week.
Ann (PS02G)    [2700] Oh lovely.
               [2701] Isn't she doing well?
Jeanie (PS02L) [2702] And ... well she's that chuffed with herself last night
Ann (PS02G)    [2703] She's so, done really well hasn't she?
Jeanie (PS02L) [2704] yeah, no she won the fruit.
               [2705] Have this heating on.
Ann (PS02G)    [2706] No it's alright.
Jeanie (PS02L) [2707] Sure?
               [2708] Erm
Ann (PS02G)    [2709] It's not cold outside it's lovely.
               [2710] ... No it's quite mild.
Jeanie (PS02L) [2711] No it isn't cold.
               [2712] I mean I had the heating on to start with and oh I
               thought this is ridiculous.
               [2713] I mean
Ann (PS02G)    [2714] Yes.
Jeanie (PS02L) [2715] I may as well save my ga
Ann (PS02G)    [2716] That's it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [2717] cos it's gonna cost me ... Erm ... she won the fruit.
               [2718] Now what they do is ... each of them takes ... a piece of
               fruit each time they go
Ann (PS02G)    [2719] Mm.
Jeanie (PS02L) [2720] I mean this is quite a good idea actually.
               [2721] An apple or an orange or something.
               [2722] So the one who loses the most weight wins the fruit.
               [2723] And she got the fruit.
Ann (PS02G)    [2724] Wins it.
               [2725] Oh that's definitely an incentive.
               [2726] Oh lovely.
Jeanie (PS02L) [2727] Three and a half pound she lost and she lost more than
               any of them.

Stuart (PS02H) [3206] Shall we have a nice cup of tea?
Ann (PS02G)    [3207] I was gasping.
               [3208] Especially when that man was ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3209] Rabbitting?
Ann (PS02G)    [3210] Yeah, which I didn't understand any of it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3211] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [3212] Pension mortgages and this mortgage and and he didn't
               really know how er er ... cos that that foreign Lucy or whatever
               her name was
Stuart (PS02H) [3213] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3214] that foreign lady was quite amused.
               [3215] She was laughing when you were asking him questions.
               [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3216] Oh.
Ann (PS02G)    [3217] [laughing] as if to say ah ah ... he's not sure what he's
               doing.
               [3218] ... He's got somebody here who knows [] .
Stuart (PS02H) [laugh]
Ann (PS02G)    [3219] [laughing] Instead of just sitting there and quoting all
               these figures
Stuart (PS02H) [3220] [...] yeah
Ann (PS02G)    [3221] and blinding you with science [] .
Stuart (PS02H) [3222] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3223] Somebody who can ask questions and knew what he was
               talking about. [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3224] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3225] And she was giggling away.
               [3226] She kept raising her eyebrows and laughing.
               [3227] [laugh] I was watching her.
Stuart (PS02H) [3228] Well I couldn't see her cos I had my back turned.
Ann (PS02G)    [3229] No you had your back to her.
Stuart (PS02H) [3230] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3231] But I could see behind you and she was ... [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3232] Well there you are.
               [3233] When you do know a bit about it you yes you want to know
Ann (PS02G)    [3234] Well that's it.
               [3235] You're not, and you're not gonna be blinded by all these
               ... like he was, what was he saying about ... all endowments are
               are not unit then you were saying yes they are and [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3236] I didn't know ... what [...] on about there.
               [3237] I I think he got his
Ann (PS02G)    [3238] [...] said that.
Stuart (PS02H) [3239] Oh he knew what he was talking about but ...
Ann (PS02G)    [3240] But you were confusing him because you knew, where he's
               used to just sitting there and telling blah blah blah blah and
Stuart (PS02H) [3241] Well you see the thing is they they they
Ann (PS02G)    [3242] And you knew what he was on about.
Stuart (PS02H) [3243] they quote this unit linked business.
               [3244] Now it's all
Ann (PS02G)    [3245] And you didn't want that did you?
Stuart (PS02H) [3246] well and good a unit linked policy but ... as I said to
               you before that ... if they, if the market crashes the day
               before your policy is due out you
Ann (PS02G)    [3247] And you haven't got enough money.
Stuart (PS02H) [3248] you could, you can lose a th ... I don't want one.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3249] If the market crashes the day before you take your
               policy's due to mature ... wallop.
               [3250] You can lose a lot of money in a ... you know, just like
               that.
Ann (PS02G)    [3251] But do you think this thing what he was on about, pension
               ... mortgage, do you think that would be better?
               [3252] Was that that PEP thing what's all in the papers at the
               moment?
Stuart (PS02H) [3253] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [3254] Is that what it means?
Stuart (PS02H) [3255] PEP's different.
Ann (PS02G)    [3256] Oh.
               [3257] Is it similar?
Stuart (PS02H) [3258] PEP's a personal equity plan.
Ann (PS02G)    [3259] Oh.
               [3260] Sorry.
Stuart (PS02H) [3261] Which is different.
               [3262] ... To be perfectly honest ... in my current situation
Ann (PS02G)    [3263] Mhm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3264] a pension mortgage ... would be more advantageous.
Ann (PS02G)    [3265] Well that's the most important thing isn't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [3266] At the moment.
               [3267] Because well I'm not in a pension scheme at work.
               [3268] But I have got an option to go in it
Ann (PS02G)    [3269] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [3270] if I want to.
Ann (PS02G)    [3271] Mhm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3272] Erm ... the only problem is ... well, even s even, not so
               much now because ... because the er ... [...] a bit better.
               [3273] ... Because of the m because of the way pensions and that
               are are organized now, they're more flexible now ... I mean, you
               can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension
               scheme, you were obliged to go in it ... that was it.
               [3274] All your other arrangements went up, went through the
               window.
Ann (PS02G)    [3275] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3276] Erm so it it it it's difficult.
Ann (PS02G)    [3277] Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays can't
               you and [...] into a
Stuart (PS02H) [3278] You can now take, now now now you can take them with you.
Ann (PS02G)    [3279] Mm.
               [3280] Where they used to be frozen and then you started another
               one wherever you went next time.
Stuart (PS02H) [3281] That's right.
               [3282] That's right.
               [3283] Whereas now [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3284] And you ended up with three four d silly little bits and
               pieces didn't you?
Stuart (PS02H) [3285] Yeah.
               [3286] Yeah.
               [3287] Whereas now you see all the they can put them all into
               one.
Ann (PS02G)    [3288] Yeah.
               [3289] I know you can take them with you now.
Stuart (PS02H) [3290] Mm.
               [3291] So in a way I think
Ann (PS02G)    [3292] And it was a lot less money as well wasn't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [3293] I mm yeah but that w don't forget
Ann (PS02G)    [3294] It started
Stuart (PS02H) [3295] that was sixty five.
Ann (PS02G)    [3296] Yeah [...] .
Stuart (PS02H) [3297] The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which
               is true they double every five years.
               [3298] Particularly in the later years there's you know
Ann (PS02G)    [3299] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3300] more ... And that's why I said, when it sounded so low
               ... that's why I I still doubt his figures.
               [3301] I still think two hundred pound a month ... a thirty
               thousand pound mortgage ... it's too low.
Ann (PS02G)    [3302] And and a cash sum at the end of it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3303] Still think it's low.
Ann (PS02G)    [3304] Seems quite ... doesn't seem a lot does it?
Stuart (PS02H) [3305] No.
               [3306] I'm pretty certain
Ann (PS02G)    [3307] And would you still have to have an insurance on top of
               that?
Stuart (PS02H) [3308] You have to have term assurance.
Ann (PS02G)    [3309] So you'd still have to have ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3310] You'd have
Ann (PS02G)    [3311] you'd have the two hundred pound and then you'd have a
               life insurance on top?
Stuart (PS02H) [3312] No no no.
               [3313] No.
               [3314] That was it, two hundred and twelve pound
Ann (PS02G)    [3315] The whole lot?
Stuart (PS02H) [3316] The whole lot.
Ann (PS02G)    [3317] Well why doesn't everybody have them then?
Stuart (PS02H) [3318] Because not everybody's eligible for them.
Ann (PS02G)    [3319] I know but they didn't, he didn't suggest it to you or
               ... why doesn't he say well there is this er er, you said that
               he didn't.
               [3320] And he must have known that they're gonna be cheaper so
               why doesn't he advise people who are starting out to take one of
               them?
Stuart (PS02H) [3321] Didn't ask [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3322] Rather than a
Stuart (PS02H) [3323] Didn't ask the questions.
Ann (PS02G)    [3324] I know, exactly.
               [3325] But surely that's
Stuart (PS02H) [3326] He didn't ... he
Ann (PS02G)    [3327] his job.
               [3328] If he's trying to find you the cheapest
Stuart (PS02H) [3329] He's not doing his job.
               [3330] Basically
Ann (PS02G)    [3331] Exactly.
Stuart (PS02H) [3332] he's not doing his job.
Ann (PS02G)    [3333] Because a young couple going in ... well even in our
               situation, you haven't got much money and you want the cheapest
               thing for the best ... we you know.
               [3334] But he never suggested it.
               [3335] You said ... what about a company, what about a a pension
               mortgage and he
Stuart (PS02H) [3336] He didn't, he he didn't ask the question.
               [3337] Which he should have asked.
Ann (PS02G)    [3338] Mm.
               [3339] Exactly.
               [3340] Yeah because it is cheaper and
Stuart (PS02H) [3341] You see the thing is ... you see I mean wh wh when this
               ... law came out, LAUTRO and all that business came out ...
               that, and best advice and all this sort of thing ... you had to
               go through all the finances and what people earned and all that
               sort of thing.
               [3342] What they've got insurance already ... erm so on and so
               forth.
               [3343] And arrange around those circumstances the best advice
               ... package.
Ann (PS02G)    [3344] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3345] But he didn't ask me the questions.
               [3346] He just ... he just ... he just
Ann (PS02G)    [3347] No he just could do an endowment one and that was it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3348] he just assumed it was gonna be
Ann (PS02G)    [3349] An an endowment policy, and endowment mortgage and that
               was it.
               [3350] He didn't tell you anything else.
Stuart (PS02H) [3351] No.
               [3352] ... Well you see when he said your base is gonna be
Ann (PS02G)    [3353] I know.
Stuart (PS02H) [3354] a hundred and two hundred
Ann (PS02G)    [3355] Ninety six.
Stuart (PS02H) [3356] and fifteen pounds or whatever
Ann (PS02G)    [3357] Two hundred and five and then that ... on a ninety six
Stuart (PS02H) [3358] And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a
               first time buyer.
Ann (PS02G)    [3359] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3360] That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six ... for
               the first year.
               [3361] Then it goes back up to the base rate.
Ann (PS02G)    [3362] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [3363] Not, I know all that's that's obvious.
Ann (PS02G)    [3364] That's quite clear.
               [3365] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3366] But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a
               ... pension mortgage ... I thought well if a hundred and ninety
Ann (PS02G)    [3367] That's only five pound a month to earn your pension.
               [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3368] if a hu if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how
               come you don't
Ann (PS02G)    [3369] That gives you five pound a month towards your pension
               which is nothing is it?
Stuart (PS02H) [3370] how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one
               pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with, because
               of the term assurance on top.
               [3371] That's fourteen pounds a month term assurance.
               [3372] ... Quite high I think.
Ann (PS02G)    [3373] [sigh] What's term assurance?
               [3374] Don't understand that.
Stuart (PS02H) [3375] Term assurance is ... life insurance ... just on life
               only.
               [3376] With no cash sum at the end.
Ann (PS02G)    [3377] Well if you died ... you'd be dead.
               [3378] Well that's fair enough isn't it?
               [3379] You wouldn't want anything else.
Stuart (PS02H) [3380] But er throughout throughout the term of my life ...
Ann (PS02G)    [3381] And if you died the [...] would be paid.
Stuart (PS02H) [3382] If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is
               payable.
Ann (PS02G)    [3383] That's it, you'd pay [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [3384] But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high.
               [3385] ... Term assurance.
               [3386] I'm tempted, I'm I'm I'm tempted to have a word with
               Mick. ... [...] ...
Ann (PS02G)    [3387] What and arrange your own?
Stuart (PS02H) [3388] Well
Ann (PS02G)    [3389] Or he'd just tell you?
Stuart (PS02H) [3390] well I, whether I, I don't know whether he would or
               whether he wouldn't.
               [3391] I mean he might ... he might not but ... then again he
               might.
               [3392] He might if I, if I talk to him he might tell me what
               sort of ... I don't want to hassle him you see cos I've hassled
Ann (PS02G)    [3393] No, that's it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3394] him before [...] .
               [3395] Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort
               of thing and I don't wanna ... I'd like to know.
Ann (PS02G)    [3396] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3397] I'd like to know ... before you know
Ann (PS02G)    [3398] You've got to get the right deal.
Stuart (PS02H) [3399] Yeah.
               [3400] I, I did ... two hundred and one pound a month or two
               hundred and fift okay it sounds cheap but ... I don't know
               fourteen pound a month just for li thirty thousand pound life
               cover over ... suppose it's the
Ann (PS02G)    [3401] Yeah but that's not that much a we
Stuart (PS02H) [3402] I suppose it's the term of years.
Ann (PS02G)    [3403] It's only three quid a m a week.
Stuart (PS02H) [3404] Yeah but I suppose it's the term of years as well.
               [3405] You sort of to sixty five rather than at sixty.
Ann (PS02G)    [3406] Well that's it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3407] So that probably makes it but I say without having me own
               book ... to check it I can't
Ann (PS02G)    [3408] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3409] I can't tell you.
               [3410] You see you can, you get a lot, you can get tax relief
               off that or you used to be able to get tax relief.
Ann (PS02G)    [3411] Well he said you could get tax relief on the whole lot.
Stuart (PS02H) [3412] On the whole lot, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3413] That's what he said.
               [3414] At twenty five percent.
Stuart (PS02H) [3415] At twenty five percent.
               [3416] I think you still, I'm not sure whether they've changed
               the law round or not cos they
Ann (PS02G)    [3417] Well that's what he said didn't he?
Stuart (PS02H) [3418] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3419] Er you'd be handy for a a tax relief on the whole lot
               rather than just
Stuart (PS02H) [3420] Yeah. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [3421] part of it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3422] Cos that [...] you see if you, if you, if you could link
               up ... life assurance to your pension ... you could get tax
               relief on your life assurance you see?
Ann (PS02G)    [3423] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3424] Which makes it advantageous ... because there's no tax
               relief on life policies now as there was
Stuart (PS02H) [3425] There used to be, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3426] There used to be but there is no
Ann (PS02G)    [3427] But they stopped it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3428] there is, they stopped it.
               [3429] There isn't any more.
Ann (PS02G)    [3430] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3431] No, I'm sort of I think he confused himself as well as
               confusing me slightly [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3432] Yeah be because you ... you confused him.
Stuart (PS02H) [3433] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3434] Because you knew.
Stuart (PS02H) [3435] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3436] Rather than somebody as I say like me who sat down there
               and he'd just quote all these figures and you wouldn't know what
               the hell he was on about and just, all you, all I would
               understand at the end is ... that's what you gotta pay.
Stuart (PS02H) [3437] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3438] [laugh] Which is what most people that go in there
Stuart (PS02H) [3439] Are interested in.
Ann (PS02G)    [3440] Well they wouldn't understand all the rest.
               [3441] This plan, that plan, the other plan.
               [3442] They only know well ... you either have this option
               paying this amount, that option paying that amount or that
               option paying that amount and which one do you want to have.
Stuart (PS02H) [3443] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3444] And and you don't understand any of the rest of it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3445] No.
               [3446] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [3447] You just sit there mm yeah mm no mm ... well that's the
               cheapest, that's the dearest and ... and take their [laughing]
               advice which ones the best for you and have it [] .
               [3448] And that's er that's all normal ... people who don't
               understand any of it ... that's the way they'd go about it isn't
               it?
Stuart (PS02H) [3449] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3450] You'd just accept whatever was ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3451] See the other thing, I don't know ... well no I'm not
               sure you can now.
               [3452] ... See if I took a pension ... mortgage out it would be
               linked to me ... lumped into me current ... pension contract.
               [3453] Cos I've already got a pension ... scheme running.
               [3454] ... Cos I've contracted out of SERPS.
               [3455] ... And also got ... erm ... erm what used to be called
               [...] seventy seven.
Ann (PS02G)    [3456] [laugh] Yes Stuart.
Stuart (PS02H) [3457] Erm ... a frozen pension with the Pru
Ann (PS02G)    [3458] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [3459] linked in with it ... at the moment.
               [3460] That's that's that's my pension arrangements at the
               moment.
Ann (PS02G)    [3461] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3462] Mm so ... I'm tempted ... er if I'm gonna do a pension
               [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3463] I tell you what you wa who you wanna go and see.
               [3464] Who I saw when I bought the house ... at er thing.
               [3465] Now he was, I know he blinded me with science but he wa ,
               he was really very good and he had his computer there and he
               went through all these different societies and plans.
Stuart (PS02H) [3466] Well that's what he's done.
               [3467] You see that's what he's done.
Ann (PS02G)    [3468] No but he had I mean he had a screen and er
Stuart (PS02H) [3469] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3470] and that was ... that's along near Maxie's near the post
               office but it's a ...
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3471] Yeah, I saw him.
Stuart (PS02H) [3472] Oh the erm the Scots chap?
               [3473] Er what's his name?
Ann (PS02G)    [3474] Oh and he was smashing.
               [3475] And he explained it all to me.
Stuart (PS02H) [3476] Oh ... I can't think of his name now.
               [3477] I I I have had dealings with him.
Ann (PS02G)    [3478] He he explained it all.
Stuart (PS02H) [3479] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3480] And although there was all these figures and er ... and
               he explained ... what was best, I mean he was purely a financial
               ... I mean he he ... as he said when we went in cos ... it
               doesn't make no difference, I I I'm not ... attached to
               anything.
               [3481] I'm here to
Stuart (PS02H) [3482] No.
               [3483] But nor's he.
Ann (PS02G)    [3484] I am here to give you advice.
Stuart (PS02H) [3485] That's it.
Ann (PS02G)    [3486] And that's it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3487] Independent financial advice.
Ann (PS02G)    [3488] And ... and therefore I'm not here to sell you this or
               that.
               [3489] I'm here purely to find out, you want to buy this council
               house ... and and and I'm here purely to find out your
               circumstances and and what would be the best deal for you.
Stuart (PS02H) [3490] That's right.
Ann (PS02G)    [3491] And he went, I mean I was there ... for blooming ages.
               [3492] And he went through everything ... till he found out ...
               and it wa I didn't have the abs the absolute cheapest one.
               [3493] Cos he didn't think that was a ... because Steven was
               disabled and that as well and on my money and one thing and
               another
Stuart (PS02H) [3494] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3495] and ... and one thing and another but er ... it ... I
               mean mi mine ended up with the Bradford and Bingley, I mean
Stuart (PS02H) [3496] Yeah well they're agents for Bradley, Bradford and
               Bingley [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3497] Yeah I know but he did say that even though agents I'm
               not giving you this and then he showed me all the things you
               know to sort of prove that he was doing it.
               [3498] But that's wh oh yeah that's who I had.
Stuart (PS02H) [3499] Yeah.
               [3500] It doesn't matter what building society you go to.
Ann (PS02G)    [3501] No well that's what he said, it doesn't but I mean ... he
               went through all these and insurance companies and because of my
               ... kidney being removed ... I had to pay, I had to pay higher
               even though I didn't have to have a bloody medical but I had to
               pay high because of my ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3502] Yeah.
               [3503] Medical condition.
Ann (PS02G)    [3504] because I'd had medical Yeah it was cos I'd had all these
               operations.
               [3505] You know you had to put how many operations have you had
               in the last ten years and ... have are you er receiving any
               treatment and all that bloody blah blah blah.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3506] And so mine, mine was higher
Stuart (PS02H) [3507] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3508] than er than other peoples which is why he went to all
               these bloody quotes.
Stuart (PS02H) [3509] See the thing ... yeah.
               [3510] As I say the thing, the thing is as I say it's you you
               your mor
Ann (PS02G)    [3511] He sorted it all out.
               [3512] But he was really good.
Stuart (PS02H) [3513] Yeah.
               [3514] Your mortgage, it doesn't matter who your mortgage is
               with, basically.
               [3515] I mean you can go to most places and
Ann (PS02G)    [3516] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3517] you're gonna be paying
Ann (PS02G)    [3518] But when you buy a council house it is slightly different
               in as much as some ... some of them won't have them.
Stuart (PS02H) [3519] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3520] Then also, he also gave me ... I mean I got hundred
               percent mortgage which you are allowed on, I mean the law says
               er ... t ... the chance to buy so therefore you don't have to
               have a deposit.
               [3521] But he also gave me enough to cover all my fees, legal
               fees.
Stuart (PS02H) [3522] Yeah.
               [3523] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3524] So I borrowed over what the house was worth.
               [3525] But that was only because ... I'd lived in it for a long
               time and I got a discount so the house was really
Stuart (PS02H) [3526] Discount.
               [3527] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3528] worth more
Stuart (PS02H) [3529] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3530] than what I was paying for it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3531] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3532] Cos I got a discount so er I borrowed another thousand
               pound
Stuart (PS02H) [3533] To cover your costs.
Ann (PS02G)    [3534] to cover all the costs for the survey for Maxie's and ...
               and this that and the other.
               [3535] Which I think come to about eight nine hundred pound.
Stuart (PS02H) [3536] Mm.
               [3537] As I say it doesn't matter what building
Ann (PS02G)    [3538] Anyway he borrowed all that for me.
Stuart (PS02H) [3539] it doesn't matter what building society you go to, you're
               gonna be paying basically the same rate.
               [3540] Because they're all the same rate.
               [3541] The base rate's the same.
               [3542] You, okay one place you can get a percent discount ...
               you might get a percent and a half discount depending on your
Ann (PS02G)    [3543] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3544] depending on the building society at the time.
               [3545] It's the life policy
Ann (PS02G)    [3546] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3547] that makes the difference.
Ann (PS02G)    [3548] But to go to somebody like him ... who knew his job
Stuart (PS02H) [3549] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3550] which was his job and and had everything there and he, he
               patched through to this computer this place and ... different
               computers that he had.
Stuart (PS02H) [3551] Yeah.
               [3552] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3553] And the facility to to get through to.
Stuart (PS02H) [3554] Mm.
               [3555] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3556] That he could get all these to find out what he thought
               was the best policy in in your
Stuart (PS02H) [3557] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3558] as I say because of my health and one thing and another
               you couldn't just ... and he, and he was really good he was and
               explained everything to me I say that
Stuart (PS02H) [3559] Can't think of his name now but I know the chap.
               [3560] He was a tall chap with glasses. [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3561] Mm.
               [3562] Yeah.
               [3563] Yeah.
               [3564] Ever so nice.
Stuart (PS02H) [3565] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3566] He really you know made me feel ... I say I weren't sat
               there like I was with that fella thinking ... well he don't seem
               to know what he's saying anyway. [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3567] No no.
Ann (PS02G)    [3568] Which is what the impression I got about him, he wasn't
               really sure himself.
Stuart (PS02H) [3569] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3570] But I think that was partly you floored him because you
               knew.
Stuart (PS02H) [3571] Yeah.
               [3572] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3573] He sort of was a bit you got him a bit couldn't say.
               [3574] But certainly that man that I went to that time he was
               very very nice and
Stuart (PS02H) [3575] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3576] then you could see he'd patch into all these different
               bloody things and
Stuart (PS02H) [3577] Mm mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3578] and and and I ended up with ... er a reasonable ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3579] Was yours an endowment?
               [3580] Or just
Ann (PS02G)    [3581] It was an endowment.
               [3582] Yeah it had to be.
               [3583] [...] I dunno why but ... it had to be. [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [3584] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3585] Well I don't know but that's what
Stuart (PS02H) [3586] When does your mortgage finish then?
Ann (PS02G)    [3587] My mortgage?
               [3588] I had it in ... eighty one, twenty years so ... another
               ten years.
Stuart (PS02H) [3589] So in fact there's still an endowment policy on you to
               cover that mortgage?
Ann (PS02G)    [3590] No they were all cancelled weren't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [3591] I dunno [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3592] Oh yeah I signed the form. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3593] So your endowment ... policy
Ann (PS02G)    [3594] Everything's all
Stuart (PS02H) [3595] Ended.
Ann (PS02G)    [3596] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [3597] Cancelled.
Ann (PS02G)    [3598] Cancelled.
               [3599] Stopped.
Stuart (PS02H) [3600] Well what about the money?
Ann (PS02G)    [3601] The money was all [...] .
               [3602] I don't know.
               [3603] I just signed forms to say that I was ... no longer
               responsible or had any claim on the property or whatever.
               [3604] And that was it.
               [3605] I didn't have to pay any more and I didn't, and I was
               passing it over to ... to Steve.
               [3606] I don't know what happened.
Stuart (PS02H) [3607] Yeah but what about the [...] The life policy was in your
               name.
Ann (PS02G)    [3608] The whole lot was in ... was it endowment?
               [3609] No I dunno, it can't have been can it?
               [3610] I don't know.
               [3611] No it wasn't it was a ... no it wasn't an endowment.
               [3612] I didn't pay.
               [3613] I only paid extra insurance.
Stuart (PS02H) [3614] Oh just a straight term p policy like I was
Ann (PS02G)    [3615] Yeah because ... yeah because, because of my health.
Stuart (PS02H) [3616] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3617] Yeah.
               [3618] That was it.
               [3619] Yeah it was [...] ... Yeah.
               [3620] Because of my health.
Stuart (PS02H) [3621] It was a term assurance rather than it being an endowment
               insurance.
               [3622] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3623] I couldn't, I don't think he could get the other ... he
               got that one because of,i in my health you couldn't ... they
               couldn't say how long
Stuart (PS02H) [3624] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3625] because of my kidney.
               [3626] The other kidney could go all blah blah blah and this
               that and the other.
               [3627] Yeah.
               [3628] It was just ordinary insurance.
               [3629] ... I don't know how much it was.
               [3630] ... I don't know.
               [3631] I mean I only paid a hundred and sixty pound a month but
               I mean [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [3632] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3633] Then I only borrowed twenty odd thousand cos I got a ...
               forty odd percent discount off the price of the house anyway.
Stuart (PS02H) [3634] Mm. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [3635] Twenty two I think it was, something like that.
Stuart (PS02H) [3636] Mm.
               [3637] ... You see [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3638] And the rent was thirty six pound ... a week.
               [3639] And it ended up I was buying it for less money than what
               I was paying monthly for rent.
Stuart (PS02H) [3640] Yeah.
               [3641] Well you would do.
Ann (PS02G)    [3642] So it was all
Stuart (PS02H) [3643] It was worth it.
Ann (PS02G)    [3644] Might as well have done it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3645] Mm.
               [3646] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3647] So I went into it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3648] Mm.
               [3649] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3650] Yeah it ... it worked out hundred and sixty one pound a
               month, with the insurance.
               [3651] So it's alright I mean I paid the whole bloody lot to
               them, I didn't
Stuart (PS02H) [3652] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3653] sort it all out.
               [3654] You don't pay it separate, I didn't.
               [3655] I paid to council offices.
Stuart (PS02H) [3656] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3657] And they sorted, they ... forward it I suppose or did
               whatever they had to do with it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3658] Mm mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3659] Used to pay at the council offices.
               [3660] [...] different book.
               [3661] ... [...] used to go and pay it.
               [3662] Write the cheque out and he'd just take it in.
Stuart (PS02H) [3663] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3664] I could have had it done through the bank but he was
               always up town anyway so
Stuart (PS02H) [3665] Mm.
               [3666] So it didn't make any difference.
Ann (PS02G)    [3667] didn't make any difference one way or the other.
Stuart (PS02H) [3668] Mm.
               [3669] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3670] So how about you?
               [3671] You'd have it done through the bank anyway and I'd just
               pay you ... weekly I cou might as well rather than monthly
               [laugh] .
Stuart (PS02H) [3672] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [3673] Save you going to the bank.
               [3674] ... Couldn't I?
               [3675] Just give you the money you [...] spends.
Stuart (PS02H) [3676] We'll see when we come, when it comes down to it won't
               we?
               [3677] What we could do financially.
               [3678] And sort something out then.
Ann (PS02G)    [3679] Well of course we will.
               [3680] [...] expect you to pay
Stuart (PS02H) [3681] But I cert I I I I I ju I it it just sounds ... you know
               two hundred pounds a month, just over two hundred pound a month
               [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3682] Sounds smashing dunnit?
Stuart (PS02H) [3683] Sounds wonderful.
Ann (PS02G)    [3684] That's what I said, why doesn't everybody have them? ...
               [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [3685] Well that's why I can't believe it.
Ann (PS02G)    [3686] Well he said go back and ... tomorrow at least and ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3687] And check his figures.
Ann (PS02G)    [3688] Mhm.
               [3689] If that's right that's the one you want really isn't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [3690] Well I I I yeah.
               [3691] I mean obviously I'd have to pay more ... er for if I
               want it to ... end at sixty.
Ann (PS02G)    [3692] Mm.
               [3693] But even then it won't be ... will it be that much?
Stuart (PS02H) [3694] To get [...] to get a higher lump sum.
               [3695] To get a higher lump sum.
               [3696] But then you see
Ann (PS02G)    [3697] Would it be that much more?
Stuart (PS02H) [3698] Shouldn't think so.
Ann (PS02G)    [3699] Well exactly.
               [3700] So it's gonna
Stuart (PS02H) [3701] You see it's
Ann (PS02G)    [3702] be less than a ... want two hundred and eighty.
Stuart (PS02H) [3703] Oh yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [3704] [...] I said so you might as well have that and have a
               lump sum and a blooming house and
Stuart (PS02H) [3705] And a pension.
Ann (PS02G)    [3706] And a pension.
               [3707] That's what I mean.
               [3708] Might as well have your pension.
               [3709] [...] when you get to sixty.
Stuart (PS02H) [3710] Mm.
               [3711] ... Say it's only twenty six years and ... course with a
               pension see you can increase your contributions.
Ann (PS02G)    [3712] Yeah.
               [3713] If if you get a better job and what have you you can
               always
Stuart (PS02H) [3714] Better job or whatever or ... pay rise or whatever you
               can increase
Ann (PS02G)    [3715] Yeah you
Stuart (PS02H) [3716] your contributions into your pension plan
Ann (PS02G)    [3717] Exactly, yes.
Stuart (PS02H) [3718] and still, and finish your mortgage earlier.
Ann (PS02G)    [3719] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [3720] Fifty five.
Ann (PS02G)    [3721] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3722] Or fifty.
               [3723] Depending on how much you wanna pay.
Ann (PS02G)    [3724] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3725] If you wanna pay more into it.
               [3726] ... But I still think [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3727] Well see what he comes up with.
Stuart (PS02H) [3728] See what he comes up with, yeah.
               [3729] See what he comes up with.
Ann (PS02G)    [3730] And certainly ... say ... two hundred and twenty five
               pound a month it's still worth having.
Stuart (PS02H) [3731] It's cheaper than we're paying now isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [3732] Mm.
               [3733] Even if it's two hundred and fifty it ... the same
Stuart (PS02H) [3734] Well you'd still
Ann (PS02G)    [3735] you're gonna have a pension and and a home.
Stuart (PS02H) [3736] In a way I'd rather pay the same ... and finish the
               mortgage earlier.
Ann (PS02G)    [3737] Yeah well that's it.
               [3738] You could volunteer to pay two hundred and fifty a month
               couldn't you?
Stuart (PS02H) [3739] And pay a higher pension ... policy.
Ann (PS02G)    [3740] Mhm.
               [3741] That's what I mean.
Stuart (PS02H) [3742] And then and then you've got the option ... then you've
               got the further option that if you want to reduce your premiums
               on your pension ... you can do.
Ann (PS02G)    [3743] If anything happened.
               [3744] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3745] If anything ... if ... if it does ... You see again and
               then you see if you're out of a job you see you ... if you
               happen to be out of a job then you're not eligible for a pension
               policy.
Ann (PS02G)    [3746] What happens then then?
               [3747] If you get made redundant?
Stuart (PS02H) [3748] Well.
Ann (PS02G)    [3749] And you've already got it.
Stuart (PS02H) [3750] Well, then you have to freeze it.
               [3751] See that's that's the oth that's another drawback with
               the pension.
               [3752] Whereas an endowment policy it doesn't matter.
               [3753] You you can carry on paying an endowment policy.
               [3754] ... So it, you know ... there's pros and cons either way.
Ann (PS02G)    [3755] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [3756] There's there's er pros and cons in buying either of tho
               either of the flats.
               [3757] ... You see er that's the thing isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [3758] Mhm.
               [3759] ... But you've got to make the decision cos I like both
               of them very much.
Stuart (PS02H) [3760] I do.
Ann (PS02G)    [3761] So therefore you have to make the decision which one, if
               it comes down to it, would you like to live in.
               [3762] ... I mean if we could get that one down at ... New Drove
               what is it, twenty nine?
               [3763] ... So that's gonna be, say if you get ... fifteen
               hundred off it ... it's gonna be twenty eight.
Stuart (PS02H) [3764] Call it, it's thirty thousand isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [3765] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [3766] What is it, twenty nine nine nine five.
               [3767] You might as well call it thirty thousand [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [3768] Well say you get twenty eight and a half.
               [3769] ... You're gonna get it cheaper ... the mor the monthly
               payment is cheaper.
               [3770] ... And then aff and then you could afford to buy some
               blooming carpets.
               [3771] And with the other one you've got to find a deposit which
               you'd have to pay back. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3772] But you wouldn't have to buy any carpets.
Ann (PS02G)    [3773] You wouldn't have to buy the carpets. ...
Stuart (PS02H) [3774] And ... you say we'd ... gonna have to have a cooker and
               a fridge and that aren't you?
Ann (PS02G)    [3775] Well a cooker you definitely, a fridge ... say we could
               perhaps borrow that one of mum's until we could afford one.
               [3776] Or pick up a cheap one.
Stuart (PS02H) [3777] Unless ... I say if you knocked him down.
Ann (PS02G)    [3778] But a cooker's no problem because I know you can go into
               the Electricity Board and say ... I'm moving into a new

                turn up or you put your one to it.
                [4839] Simple as that.
                [4840] The queen six and hope for turn up.
                [4841] That would split, split your hand up totally.
Ann (PS02G)     [4842] Mm that's why I was yeah.
                [4843] Yes well I didn't know you see.
                [4844] If I don't like playing singles, easy as doubles because
                you only have to put one in and it's easier.
Stuart (PS02H)  [4845] One in ... yeah.

Stuart (PS02H) [6533] Two tens.
Ann (PS02G)    [6534] That's it ... that's all you got.

               pence, okay?
               [6536] ... You're not taking all that money are you?

Stuart (PS02H) [6544] Well here are, one, two, three on the bounce and I
               thought well ... you know that's a fairly good start, jack,
               queen, king ... king high was a bit dodgy ... [...] ... you
               never know do you?
Ann (PS02G)    [6545] Oh I've got a handful of bloody ... pairs here, wait a
               minute ... got fo I've only got three ... feels like a bloody
               handful of them!
               [6546] ... Can't do nothing here ... Ain't got nothing there.
Stuart (PS02H) [6547] Is that what you're playing?
Ann (PS02G)    [6548] Well I have to, I ain't got nothing else.
Stuart (PS02H) [6549] Three fours ... eight, nine, ten ... queen high ... the
               pairs stuck at the end though dear.
Ann (PS02G)    [6550] Oh [...] ... not one flush.
Stuart (PS02H) [6551] Must of been [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [6552] Yeah but then it split the bloody pairs all in bits.
Stuart (PS02H) [6553] Yeah, I know, I know [...] yes.
Ann (PS02G)    [6554] Couldn't make a lot with that [...] , could I really?
Stuart (PS02H) [6555] Not really no.
Ann (PS02G)    [6556] [...] there for three pairs which was just as well I
               stopped you on the last one.
Stuart (PS02H) [6557] Ooh!
               [6558] ... Ooh!
               [6559] ... You bugger!
Ann (PS02G)    [6560] Oh I want card for run [...] ... and I bet I can't bloody
               do owt with this lot.
Stuart (PS02H) [6561] No neither can I.
Ann (PS02G)    [6562] Can't even ... bloody hell!
               [6563] ... Ain't got eight ... ha ha.
Stuart (PS02H) [6564] Nope ... No how's it going?
Ann (PS02G)    [6565] I don't bloody know [laughing] how to play [] ! ...
               [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [6566] Wanna play one, two, three, four, five, six and [...]
               haven't you?
Ann (PS02G)    [6567] Yes.
Stuart (PS02H) [6568] Or five six seven and ... that's what you wanna do innit?
Ann (PS02G)    [6569] Oh yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [6570] No ... no I wouldn't do that ... I always do it like this
               ... if I was playing that hand ... three flu well you could go
               well ... you got a choice ... you can go ... take a chance on
               your last hand, not getting through ... or ... you can go two,
               three, five, six, seven ... two three four, ace [...] finish
               them ... which is what I'd probably do.
Ann (PS02G)    [6571] Oh I didn't see that, oh
Stuart (PS02H) [6572] One more try
Ann (PS02G)    [6573] I didn't see that love
Stuart (PS02H) [6574] three queens ... jack flush ... ace high, so I mean you
               wouldn't get any it anyway.
Ann (PS02G)    [6575] I didn't see that last flush, I couldn't ba , I couldn't
               sort them out.
Stuart (PS02H) [6576] Yeah but I mean it's ... it makes you one, two, three,
               you wouldn't of had a one two three to start with
Ann (PS02G)    [6577] I know that
Stuart (PS02H) [6578] but you had a eight [...] to finish with which is [...]
               finishing ... and a one, two, three ... might not be [...] and a
               ... better run ... so ... I think I would have been tempted to
               finish with the ace flush there ... try and stop me rather than
               trying to win it ... cos you had nothing else did you?
               [6579] ... No ... you didn't have ... you didn't have a
               finishing hand, you didn't really have a brilliant first two
               hands ... and then the pick of the one, two, three bouncer ... I
               might ... I might have been persuaded to play the one, two,
               three bouncer and hope that that got through ... but to finish
               with an ace flush ... but good.
Ann (PS02G)    [6580] Oh I don't know ... I ain't got nothing.
Stuart (PS02H) [6581] Neither have I.
Ann (PS02G)    [6582] Oh I'm not playing this, bugger it!
               [6583] You chose, I can't sort it out [...] ... [...] ... I
               ain't playing no more, it's damn boring!
Stuart (PS02H) [6584] There a nice pair of fours ... ace high there ... er ...
               seven, pair of nines, ace high ... about all you got really ...
               that's all of it ... whatever you got [...] .

               aces, and a pair of eights ... would have been mine whichever
               way you played it.

               something like that, which is purely chemical and never seen as
               li a damn orange ... That's all it is is flavourings and water
               and

               of an hour to the ... erm ... bus stop ... which is right
               outside the door ... of the hotel we were getting ... so ... and
               we use the bus rather than take the car in daily, cos it's
               easier ... so I ... and er ... and of course I sat down and had
               a breakfast and I thoroughly enjo , I didn't have any cereals
               ... you know, I says well er ... and I had ... a little bit of

None (PS6TB)   [6920] the they don't do the same sweets week in week out, I
               mean the they ... erm they vary them a on a ... possibly on a
               ... on an eight week basis so it all depends which week you go

None (PS6TB)   [6922] as to which ... sweets is actually ... on that week ...
               and if it's one that you don't really fancy, well ... I'm not
               bothered, I'm not bothered about the sweets.

               five dishes on it

None (PS6TB)   [6928] Well if you
Ann (PS02G)    [6929] I mean she does everything, you know, burgers ... you
               know, stuff that people want, I mean that's bar meals, but to
               sit in the dining
None (PS6TB)   [6930] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [6931] room you have
None (PS6TB)   [6932] Yeah, well basically
Ann (PS02G)    [6933] proper meals.
None (PS6TB)   [6934] ours ... basically what you wa what you, what is set up
               there basic bar meals but i you can have it in the restaurant if
               you want.
Ann (PS02G)    [6935] If you wish.
None (PS6TB)   [6936] If you wish ... you know ... but I mean during the week
               ... nine times
Ann (PS02G)    [6937] So
None (PS6TB)   [6938] out of ten
Ann (PS02G)    [6939] so she did ... I think it was four ... se special meals
               then ... when we were there there was ... salmon, duckling
None (PS6TB)   [6940] [...] at the moment, only on a Sunday ... we get the odd
               meals on a Sunday, we get the odd meals on a ... Saturday night
               ... but nine times out of ten they only want to sit in there
               there's a
Ann (PS02G)    [6941] Sit in there.
None (PS6TB)   [6942] they don't want to sit in the restaurant ... they very
               rarely do get them sitting in the restaurant ... [...] ... I
               suppose to a certain extent other than the Sundays ... it's just
               waste of space.
Ann (PS02G)    [6943] Yeah.
None (PS6TB)   [6944] And it's not earning us anything in there, but mind you
               ... erm it sometimes during the week ... where erm ... the
               tables are full of a load of papers and what have you where I've
               been doing paper work and that
Ann (PS02G)    [6945] Yeah.

               their paper work, Sarah does her homework there and ... [...]
               ... we have our meals in there ... so erm ... sort of it doesn't
               really matter ... but er ... you know it saves them all coming
               out for a meal, and having to do it ... cos trouble is ... it's
               too small to keep an eye on people ... to see if they want
               anything, everything's alright and what have you
Ann (PS02G)    [6947] Yeah.

Ann (PS02G)    [7076] Yeah.
None (PS6TB)   [7077] to get up to the thirty five mile an hour you gotta go
               through all the five gears ... so you're forever ... pa going
               like that ... erm ... and that made it worse ... so that last
               fortnight ... she hasn't been on the bike ... and that last
               weekend when she went out ... she went ... because we was busy,
               she got her bike out and she went up to work ... [...] one or
               two of her mates and then come home ... she said she'd wished

               any better ... but erm ... she's injured it but ... not er you
               know it's obviously she can't ... move it a lot that way which
               is what's ... effecting her, but mind you ... once she gets back
               on her bike again, as it's cold weather
Ann (PS02G)    [7080] Yeah that won't help [...]
None (PS6TB)   [7081] it'll be back again ... Mind you, I feel it ... I mean I

               when you can see them, my scars and all there ... If I touch
               that, that'll be very gingerly ... [...] ach aches like hell!
               [7084] ... And course we're doing a lot of counting today ...
               this wrist ... is a ... you know ... I don't mind that ... you
               see ... what did that wrist was ... that elbow I had to have a
               second operation on it, [...] in the arm up here ... because er
               ... I had to have some bone taken away in the elbow ... course
               it stretched ... guiders ... but they also ... erm ... disturbed
               the wrist joint ... because it was in plaster like that
               stretched round ... and disturbed the wrist joint ... and I ke

Stuart (PS02H) [11905] Thursday morning can't you?
Ann (PS02G)    [11906] Don't know if I could do the electric one ... definitely
               ... Guess that's about whether the [...] ... I'd like one of
               them, one of them and ... yeah but we don't know when it can be

               but ... but er we'll let you know, well we can ... so [...] it's
               there ... that's what we wish, they'd [...] the bills go and
               we'll let you know when you can be ... the keys can be available
               for you to put it in.
Stuart (PS02H) [11907] And so the ... Can't [...] first [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [11908] Mm, I know.
Stuart (PS02H) [11909] That's the first job ... first one in [...] ... then you
               ... get the carpet sorted out.
Ann (PS02G)    [11910] Yeah cos it's much easier than dragging all [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [11911] At least at least you know how ... you know ... if he
               says you can have this one or this one ... yeah cos the choice
               between one or the other ... and he says well I can fit this one
               immediately, but, this one I've gotta order.
Ann (PS02G)    [11912] They've gotta send for.
Stuart (PS02H) [11913] I mean it might ... might just sway as to one way or the
               other if there's a bit of a ... well we like them both, but
               which one, you know?
Ann (PS02G)    [11914] I don't wanna get carpets without you with me ... cos
               you have to live with them as well.
Stuart (PS02H) [11915] I can have a look at them, now ... in the catalogue.
Ann (PS02G)    [11916] Yeah but they won't be exactly the same in shops.
Stuart (PS02H) [11917] No, true.
Ann (PS02G)    [11918] Similar but not the same.
Stuart (PS02H) [11919] No not the same, that's true.
               [11920] Mind you I suppose out of a catalogue it's ... at least
               you can feel them and see them ... all that.
Ann (PS02G)    [11921] Oh and I'd rather
Stuart (PS02H) [11922] Only on ... [...] see the whole roll.
Ann (PS02G)    [11923] I'd rather go in the shop and see it ... cos sometimes,
               especially if it's got a pattern on ... turn out to be better
               than the catalogue ... cos when it comes, it don't look the
               same, and then the same colour do you?
               [11924] Cos a ... reproduction's never ... perfect is it?
Stuart (PS02H) [11925] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [11926] In a photograph it's never ... true ... then you go in a
               shop and what you see is what you get.
Stuart (PS02H) [11927] Definitely ... There's only a, there's only really ...
               what two carpets [...] and these are ... [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [11928] [...] carpet [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [11929] two main bit.
Ann (PS02G)    [11930] [...] for a bathroom, I mean ... neither were very good.
Stuart (PS02H) [11931] Yeah but then again ... yeah but as I say i i if you ...
               if you want the same in the bathroom and the bedroom
Ann (PS02G)    [11932] Well I don't
Stuart (PS02H) [11933] and the same in the hall in the living room
Ann (PS02G)    [11934] So two colours.
Stuart (PS02H) [11935] you only got two carpets to sort out ... and a bit of
               lino ... rather than having a different one with this one and a
               ... different one for that one and then ... a different one for
Ann (PS02G)    [11936] Yeah, I'll go and put that [...] together those
Stuart (PS02H) [11937] Alright.
Ann (PS02G)    [...]

Stuart (PS02H) [11945] [reading+shouting] Saturn your ruler is in exceptionally

Stuart (PS02H) [11954] Mm. [pouring]
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [11955] No [...] I'm sure we are ... Yes we certainly are dear.
Ann (PS02G)    [11956] All seems to have happened in such a rush.
Stuart (PS02H) [11957] Well yeah but
Ann (PS02G)    [11958] There's so much to think about.
Stuart (PS02H) [11959] I know.
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [11960] But we had to really because
Ann (PS02G)    [11961] No because we wouldn't have got that fifteen hundred
               pounds ... they hadn't agreed to do us a service.
Stuart (PS02H) [11962] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [11963] I wanna get it through.
Stuart (PS02H) [11964] Well they said they'd wait, I mean fifteen hundred pound
               ain't he would pa put a deposit down, it's only five percent ...
               innit?
               [11965] Fifteen hundred pound ... if he was prepared to put a
               deposit down [...] or something that would have been fifteen
               hundred quid.
Ann (PS02G)    [11966] Yes.
Stuart (PS02H) [11967] So ... we got it.
Ann (PS02G)    [11968] He must have been looking for [...] bathroom.
Stuart (PS02H) [11969] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [11970] Otherwise he wouldn't have accepted without any
Stuart (PS02H) [11971] Without any quibble.
Ann (PS02G)    [11972] No.
Stuart (PS02H) [11973] I thought it was worth pushing for the extra ... I mean
               when he said a thousand, I thought it would be
Ann (PS02G)    [11974] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [11975] worth pushing for an extra five hundred, and did get it.
Ann (PS02G)    [11976] Yeah well he said a thousand because he knew he could
               get ... he'd carpet that ... er er [...] for a thousand.
Stuart (PS02H) [11977] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [11978] That's why he mentioned that sort of figure ... if all
               you wanted was a or , a fridge, a cooker ... and some carpets,
               you could do that easy on a thousand.

Stuart (PS02H) [12016] It is a little bit er
Ann (PS02G)    [12017] With a deadlock on the front door so he ... can't get in
               and out or anything.
Stuart (PS02H) [12018] Oh yeah ... can't jump on the window to get in or
               anything.

Ann (PS02G)    [12021] Looks like a [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [12022] It's gonna be a little bit tricky isn't it really,
               having a
Ann (PS02G)    [12023] I think I would just about give up over that.
Stuart (PS02H) [12024] It's a shame.
Ann (PS02G)    [12025] [...] , but I mean a downstairs one wouldn't be quite so
               bad
Stuart (PS02H) [12026] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [12027] but those stairs won't ... like, I mean, I wouldn't like
               it that if it was just indoors forever ... would you, honestly?
Stuart (PS02H) [12028] Not really.
Ann (PS02G)    [12029] It's not fair on an animal even.
Stuart (PS02H) [12030] It's not natural ... no.
Ann (PS02G)    [12031] Cats or something.
Stuart (PS02H) [12032] Not really is it?
Ann (PS02G)    [12033] No I know and I don't fancy litter trays and things
               either.
Stuart (PS02H) [12034] We might do one day or ... see
Ann (PS02G)    [12035] Yeah but ... but not while we're there, I don't think
               it's [...] ... must get another budgie sometime ... get Steven's
               budgie or something.
Stuart (PS02H) [12036] Yeah a cat's a little bit out on dashing upstairs now
               innit really?
               [12037] ... It's a shame, but, there you go.
Ann (PS02G)    [12038] Definitely is up here, it's
Stuart (PS02H) [12039] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [12040] not fair on a animal as I say, he's bound to ... be
               trapped at the bloody door for hours before anybody come in and
Stuart (PS02H) [12041] It ain't fair.
Ann (PS02G)    [12042] No.
Stuart (PS02H) [12043] Actually that's something we'll have to ... negotiate
               with our ... er ... opposite neighbour
Ann (PS02G)    [12044] The stair carpets.
Stuart (PS02H) [12045] stair carpet.
Ann (PS02G)    [12046] Hadn't thought of that, well that's gonna be noisy
               anybody coming home late at night ... wooden stairs.
Stuart (PS02H) [12047] Don't know who you got ... we'll have to wait and see
               who we get.
Ann (PS02G)    [12048] Well fling that rug out the hall it'll be a start, bung
               it out on the landing ... for a start.
Stuart (PS02H) [12049] Yeah ... yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [12050] So at least there's something up there at the doors to
               wipe your feet on and what not, but ... I'm not splashing out on
               stair carpet ... until somebody else has been
Stuart (PS02H) [12051] Oh no.
Ann (PS02G)    [12052] in [...] as well.
Stuart (PS02H) [12053] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [12054] Well there's something that will have to be will be
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [12055] needed eventually.
Stuart (PS02H) [12056] I say a negotiation with ... next door neighbour ... or
               something like that.
Ann (PS02G)    [12057] But you come home late at night when people are asleep
Stuart (PS02H) [12058] Start banging up the stairs and
Ann (PS02G)    [12059] and you lot, and stroll in after half past four an five
               o'clock in the morning, you know, you do.
Stuart (PS02H) [12060] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [12061] If I don't get up till nine, it's a bit
Stuart (PS02H) [12062] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [12063] It won't be very nice ... so we'll have to just ...
               manage ... as for as ... the stall light ... the hall lighting
               ... who is responsible for that?
               [12064] ... Cos the staircase has gotta be lit, I mean you can't
               get
Stuart (PS02H) [12065] There is a light out there isn't there?
               [12066] ... I noticed that.
Ann (PS02G)    [12067] I mean who who cares for the electricity?
               [12068] ... It's gotta be on someone's electric hasn't it?
               [12069] ... You can't, one flat's not gonna be responsible for
               having the hall lit up all night long which it will be and then
               ... length of time, unless it's on a timer switch.
Stuart (PS02H) [12070] Mm ... that is something we will have to investigate.
Ann (PS02G)    [12071] I know.
Stuart (PS02H) [12072] [...] ... di discuss with our
Ann (PS02G)    [12073] I mean with

               somebody's meter or somewhere.

               fortnight.
Stuart (PS02H) [12100] Well off we go, back to work.
Ann (PS02G)    [12101] Won't use so much petrol from now on anyway, to get to
               work will we?
Stuart (PS02H) [12102] Wouldn't be a lot of difference actually.
Ann (PS02G)    [12103] Oh won't it?
Stuart (PS02H) [12104] No ... By time you ... I mean it's not that far ... but
               ... by the time you get there the car won't have a chance to
               warm up thoroughly.
Ann (PS02G)    [12105] Oh, use more petrol, I see.
Stuart (PS02H) [12106] So you'd be on automatic choke for a bit of the way,
               most of the way anyway so ... [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [12107] Mm.

               the time as well the ones that we ... cruise in ... top gear ...
               I don't think that's really for me ... [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [12109] Oh.
Stuart (PS02H) [12110] Not appreciably amateur.
Ann (PS02G)    [12111] Ah ... sorry ... won't do it ... perhaps ... you turn li

Stuart (PS02H) [12114] I hope so.
Ann (PS02G)    [12115] Yeah so do I ... don't wanna lose touch with them now.
Stuart (PS02H) [12116] That would be ... stroll up to the Royal Standard.
Ann (PS02G)    [12117] Yes, that's it ... some odd nights we was on our way
               home from work, it's [...] going up to the ... even when we're
               on earlies and ... and weekends we can ... go there can't we?
               [12118] ... It's not that far ... there along the bypass there,
               it's not that far away is it?
Stuart (PS02H) [12119] About that again, it's a similar distance I would say.
Ann (PS02G)    [12120] That's what I mean, it's not
Stuart (PS02H) [12121] It's as near to the ... as it would have been from there
               [...] ... [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [12122] So it's not a lot of ... lot of bother ... the only
               thing is that i ... you gotta drive ... in town rather than
               drive ... on country lanes ... to get to the main roads ...
               [...] ... little bit more ... dangerous ... as far as getting
               caught is concerned ... ha!
Stuart (PS02H) [12123] It's [...] ... we can always walk up the [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [12124] Yep ... walk in the town if you're going
Stuart (PS02H) [12125] Walk in the town.
Ann (PS02G)    [12126] if you want a good drink, doesn't matter does it?
               [12127] ... Can you get through to town ... [...] there's no
               through road that way, other end, but couldn't is there any
               short cuts you get into town that way?
               [12128] ... No?
Stuart (PS02H) [12129] No, it's a longer way.
Ann (PS02G)    [12130] Is it?
Stuart (PS02H) [12131] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [12132] Ah I just wondered, I mean I don't know out that way.
Stuart (PS02H) [12133] No ... erm ... might as well continue now ... half way
               round ... do a u-turn.
Ann (PS02G)    [12134] That's going the wrong way dear.
Stuart (PS02H) [12135] Yeah looks like it dunnit?
Ann (PS02G)    [12136] Not sure of where he is ... mm mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [12137] No the only w
Ann (PS02G)    [12138] He's forgotten something.
Stuart (PS02H) [12139] The only way to town is ... come up to way
Ann (PS02G)    [12140] And come back again.
Stuart (PS02H) [12141] towards [...] Boy's School ... then Corporation Road and
               then in town.
Ann (PS02G)    [12142] No I didn't know if you could walk ... if there's any
               ... short cuts if you wanted to walk into town.
Stuart (PS02H) [12143] No ... no there's not.
Ann (PS02G)    [12144] I jus ... just wondered, not knowing the area as well as
               you do ... wondered if there was a little
Stuart (PS02H) [12145] You go down to the bottom of these roads there and ...
               [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [12146] Do you end up sort of metal box end?
Stuart (PS02H) [12147] No, there's metal boxes ... at each
Ann (PS02G)    [12148] Well
Stuart (PS02H) [12149] end.
Ann (PS02G)    [12150] Yeah I know that's what I mean, if you get walking down
               there you'd come to all the factories I presume.
Stuart (PS02H) [12151] If you come up ... er when you're at the Weasel Lane
Ann (PS02G)    [12152] Mm ... mhm.
Stuart (PS02H) [12153] instead of turning up towards the Royal Standard you
               turn the other way, that comes down past [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [12154] Mm.
Stuart (PS02H) [12155] Then you go right down to the bottom of [...] Road you
               ... cos that's a dead end anyway, [...] .
Ann (PS02G)    [12156] I didn't know if there was lanes going off into town,whe
               or oh I don't know.
Stuart (PS02H) [12157] Mhm.
Ann (PS02G)    [12158] [...] ... I shall have to be looking out for a second
               hand bike-y ... just for the occasional trip into town ...
               without getting Stuey out of bed ... so I be a bit more
               independent than just ... bothering you all time, if I just
               wanna pop anywhere.
Stuart (PS02H) [12159] It isn't a great problem ... not really.
Ann (PS02G)    [12160] No I know my but it ... it'll give me a little
               independence as well will it not?
Stuart (PS02H) [12161] You got a shop at the top of the road ain't you?
Ann (PS02G)    [12162] Yeah it's not far is it?
Stuart (PS02H) [12163] Shops at the ... top there.
Ann (PS02G)    [12164] It's not far from Rainbow really, to do you main
               shopping if you ... in a hurry, is it?
Stuart (PS02H) [12165] No ... that's up ... that's just up the ... [...]

Stuart (PS02H) [12237] That's quite often why I like, when I go down Norbet
               Street I don't like parking in Norbet Street itself cos it's
               only half an hour ... if you park down ... Royal Place ... it's
Ann (PS02G)    [12238] It's a
Stuart (PS02H) [12239] an hour
Ann (PS02G)    [12240] It's an hour.
Stuart (PS02H) [12241] Then I could have an hour, you see so it just gives you
               that extra breathing space if you

Stuart (PS02H) [12250] Quite normal to be a little bit more than half an hour
               but el traffico wardens about an whoever ... takes your number
               ... sort of jus just after you parked then it is half an hour
               but sometimes it's not for

               we didn't need one ... Ann's got another team in the ... other
               room doing it.

Deidre (PS039) [13022] Have we got some more Birds Eye pies up to truss?
Ann (PS02G)    [13023] Yeah
Deidre (PS039) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [13024] they didn't do them!
               [13025] ... Actually they perhaps let us go back on them then
Deidre (PS039) [13026] Well
Ann (PS02G)    [13027] tomorrow
Deidre (PS039) [13028] if you do that, I think perhaps that's the best kind of
               action, have a word with him and go down ... I mean
Ann (PS02G)    [13029] You mean go back on them, cos we didn't finish them cos
               there was three pallets ... and we didn't even do two.
Deidre (PS039) [13030] There's only twelve with a [...] last week weren't
               there?
Ann (PS02G)    [13031] We didn't finish them cos they wanted to start trussing
               early
Deidre (PS039) [13032] It's what you had last week.
Ann (PS02G)    [13033] and then Ann started that little line trussing you see,
               so we've ... done it between us but ... I've got a thousand to
               do and she's got about four d t
Deidre (PS039) [13034] Ann, even if they do some [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [13035] I bet you feel like a [...] now, [...] ... give them in
               when they can't truss them ... dunno.
Deidre (PS039) [13036] That I've only had
Ann (PS02G)    [13037] We give them in when they came trussed with the though
               we had before.
Deidre (PS039) [13038] It's not very heavy ... [...] ... Really to start a
               truss that's [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [13039] Well, with the two lines going yeah ... would have been
               about right then but see, John ... I don't suppose he realised
               Ann was gonna ... fetch all the people out of here there and
               everywhere and start that up.
Deidre (PS039) [13040] What did he do, did he say [...]

Deidre (PS039) [13045] Yeah yeah but he wouldn't [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [13046] I suppose that's what John thought, we might not get
               them done, start early and get them finished
Deidre (PS039) [13047] That's good.
Ann (PS02G)    [13048] He just said leave the Bird's Eye pies and ... start
               your trussing.
Deidre (PS039) [13049] That was gone seven o'clock when [...]

Ann (PS02G)    [13203] [...] I know it was fourteen by nine foot something, I'm
               up to nine, ten which is exactly which she said [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [13204] They'd rather do that than having to piece [...] twelve
               quarter then you've got to have [...] join the bit then all the
               pattern that will be matching exactly er [...] you'll use more.

Stuart (PS02H) [13208] Mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [13209] suppose they have to match the pattern otherwise it does
               look quite silly ... which is what they've done in here, they
               haven't matched the patterns ... [...] that wall there is it, it
               ain't joined

Stuart (PS02H) [13212] Yes, yes
Ann (PS02G)    [13213] but it just knocked the cotton sticks out, just put the
               piece down, there's no way I'm gonna do this, so it doesn't
               matter does it?
Stuart (PS02H) [13214] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [13215] That's definitely, this is the raw bit and that's a bit
               of the end of the cut-off, probably have [...] the landing or
               something ... can use the rest of it through [...]

               have that piece where it's [...] bottom of the stairs or
               wherever, I mean, the, stand on [...] slip mats ... you're gonna
               get that because of the, the airing cupboard is part of the
               hall, part of the bedroom and ... nothing you can do about that
               one, and on the wall it's just gonna be one length of each room,

Stuart (PS02H) [13325] Go for a microwave or do you just go for
Ann (PS02G)    [13326] We've got nine hundred pounds approximately, after the

               pound, two hundred pound for suite and the microwave ...

               thing isn't it?
Ann (PS02G)    [13329] Yep.
Stuart (PS02H) [13330] There are so many combinations of what to have, what to

Stuart (PS02H) [13332] Carpets, cooker fridge
Ann (PS02G)    [13333] Yeah.
Stuart (PS02H) [13334] they're the definite needs and erm ...
Ann (PS02G)    [13335] That was eleven hundred pounds

Ann (PS02G)    [13336] approximately, you've got four hundred pound really to

               under seven hundred and ninety nine [...] ...
Stuart (PS02H) [13347] I think you'd be better off with a ... with a new cooker
               and fridge
Ann (PS02G)    [13348] Oh yeah, definitely I think ...
Stuart (PS02H) [13349] [...] , you can go second hand

Ann (PS02G)    [14191] I shouldn't think until you at least gone to the
               mortgage he's gonna give us authorization to spend his money.
Stuart (PS02H) [...] ...
Ann (PS02G)    [14192] I'm not gonna use authori to go and spend one thousand,
               five hundred pounds and it all falls through [laugh]
Stuart (PS02H) [14193] That's true, that's true, that's true,
Ann (PS02G)    [14194] after we've spent it ...
Stuart (PS02H) [14195] very true, very true
Ann (PS02G)    [14196] And what we having for lunch? ...
Stuart (PS02H) [14197] Don't know, I don't know what we're having
Ann (PS02G)    [14198] Taking fish to mum's or find something when we get

               don't know how old it will be.
Ann (PS02G)    [14200] No ...
Stuart (PS02H) [14201] No point in buying ... fish extra if we know we're gonna
               be, have to wait or something ...
Ann (PS02G)    [14202] If we're gonna be late, we'll have to buy the fish, cos
               we won't have time to cook anything.
Stuart (PS02H) [14203] Oh fish and chips you mean, from the chippie?
Ann (PS02G)    [14204] Yeah, yes I'll just have a piece of fish and you can
               have ... fish and chips, we won't have time to cook anything
               will we?
Stuart (PS02H) [14205] That's what I mean
Ann (PS02G)    [14206] Depending on the time.
Stuart (PS02H) [14207] or I say [...] chicken alright? ...
Ann (PS02G)    [14208] Depending on how long we're gonna have to cook it, well
               I mean, [...] , oh well [...] what I can ... still you'll have
               to [...] fish and chips ...
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [14209] still you perhaps have to buy fish and chips
Stuart (PS02H) [14210] Why?
Ann (PS02G)    [14211] cos Ann hasn't got a lot of pennies anyway
Stuart (PS02H) [14212] Nor has Stuey.
Ann (PS02G)    [14213] hasn't he?
               [14214] Oh bloody hell, we're poor streaks then dear.

               at all, I didn't have that much left, I bought mum's cigs and
               that bit of shopping the other day and that was the end of that
               ... [sigh] ... we will survive.
Stuart (PS02H) [14222] Pay day late again?

               just, quite like it, it's now big, it's about the most thing
               he's ever recorded that I have liked,
Stuart (PS02H) [14234] Mm.

               ... Christmas number one's going to be Bohemian Rhapsody which I
               do like you know [...]

Stuart (PS02H) [14240] going up ...
Ann (PS02G)    [14241] that will do.
Stuart (PS02H) [14242] They always [...] prices keep falling.
Ann (PS02G)    [14243] [...] ... Well, I understand its ... reasoning [...] ,
               but, I think if you've been very hard pushed [...] list, with
               this money, don't you?
Stuart (PS02H) [14244] Mm, mm.
Ann (PS02G)    [14245] Considering I'm not supposed to have that ... cos I had
               it when Ann and [...] bought it [...] not sure if it's now ...
               are you?
Stuart (PS02H) [14246] Not really, was, though I thought we were offering a
               reasonable price taking everything into consideration
Ann (PS02G)    [14247] [...] upstairs and
Stuart (PS02H) [14248] [...] price market
Ann (PS02G)    [14249] market

Stuart (PS02H) [14252] the [...] , I thought that was fair
Ann (PS02G)    [14253] as it stands at the moment.
Stuart (PS02H) [14254] fairly good deal.
Ann (PS02G)    [14255] Mm.
               [14256] See here, they're gonna get thirty six for it as it
               stands ... put it on the market as [...] ...
Stuart (PS02H) [14257] Might do, yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [14258] Might even [...] two years [...] .
Stuart (PS02H) [14259] When you look at, look at the old houses on the market,
               erm, yeah, I think he might just, he might wait a while, there
               aren't that many buyers,
Ann (PS02G)    [14260] Oh that's it, that's why they're coming down, that's why
               [...] are quite pleased to see us dear, especially at this time
               of the year, not many people will buy Christmas time, think oh
               we'll wait and go and get Christmas over and the spring and ...
Stuart (PS02H) [14261] I think looking at the market you can, you can get a,
               erm detached, semi-detached sort of one you know one bedroom I
               suppose,
Ann (PS02G)    [14262] You can get two bedroom
Stuart (PS02H) [14263] two bedroom at a push for about thirty four, thirty
               five, thirty six, thirty seven,
Ann (PS02G)    [...]
Stuart (PS02H) [14264] oh I don't know, I don't know, I think it will be a
               while getting rid of it yes, but I think he might get his price
               eventually, but it will take a long while to get it [...] , it's
               up to him if he wants a quick sale, [...] ... you know, thirty
               five yeah I, thirty five thousand I think [...] , as I say
               taking everything into consideration, I mean, failing three okay
               I know I did the [...] thirty three ... so take thirty five,
               thirty three and a half, oh [...] he ain't got much to worry
               about ...
Ann (PS02G)    [14265] Well
Stuart (PS02H) [...] ...
Ann (PS02G)    [14266] I'd better get some clothies on ... cause a bit of a
               stir round the estate agents [...] , naked from the waist down,

               I [...] ask permission if I'd er ... wanted to as a [...]
               without being asked to do it, I would of gone and seen personnel
               and asked, I would not of dreamed of doing it in a work's
               situation unless I was asked, say anything personal I'd turned
               it off ... not that it, apart from me and Stuart
Stuart (PS02H) [14272] Go on.

               really, we went me and er telling me about her problems I only
               put that on a tape do you?

Ann (PS02G)    [14275] you know, anything personal like that you turn it off
               don't you? ... not that they know or care whi anyone's personal
               problems anyway, they don't know who we are ...

Ann (PS02G)    [14363] Pardon.
Stuart (PS02H) [14364] I doubt they do as well.
Ann (PS02G)    [14365] Oh I don't know, cos there's a hell of a lot of people
               parking, same cars in that multi-storey in there.
Stuart (PS02H) [14366] Let's have a look then.
Ann (PS02G)    [14367] [...] can if you want, in the [...] it's not that far to
               go around and [...] use one for the whole day.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [14368] Pardon.
Stuart (PS02H) [14369] [...] I suppose.
Ann (PS02G)    [14370] Yeah, that gets pretty full weekends but [...] I don't
               like that one ... every week in The Standard there's always a,
               you know, this break in, that break in and
Stuart (PS02H) [14371] When you park your car you've got the [...] breaking in.
Ann (PS02G)    [14372] I know, but that one seems worse than anywhere, isn't
               it, every week you know stolen out of the [...] car park ... car
               broken into, I mean who's, I can't imagine with all them cars in
               there that nobody ever seems to see anything.
Stuart (PS02H) [14373] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [14374] Or they do, and turn a blind eye.
Stuart (PS02H) [14375] Quite often that happens late at night, doesn't it, you
               know
Ann (PS02G)    [14376] Yeah
Stuart (PS02H) [14377] after chucking out time.
Ann (PS02G)    [14378] I think a lot of people are just, you know, I'm not
               getting involved in them, they might belt me one, walk away,
               anyway you can't blame them, sad, people can't, people can't say
               it were you and your boy, you know, leave that, leave that alone
               or else I'll go and get a policeman, the fear of them
Stuart (PS02H) [14379] Young
Ann (PS02G)    [14380] belting them one.
Stuart (PS02H) [14381] go and get a policeman, time you've gone and got a
               policeman they're off
Ann (PS02G)    [14382] They're gone
Stuart (PS02H) [14383] you know, so, there's no
Ann (PS02G)    [14384] seen so much of it that it, that somebody will see some
               of it ... but then, well maybe there, and he didn't really erm,
               you know, you get out of it quick.
Stuart (PS02H) [14385] Turn a blind eye don't they?
Ann (PS02G)    [14386] Yeah, cos they don't want to get involved and they're
               frightened of the consequences.
Stuart (PS02H) [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [14387] [...] more police statements and probably hours [...]
               police stations
Stuart (PS02H) [14388] Yeah.

               liable to put a brick through your window, or belt you one, or
               damage your car next time they see it.
Stuart (PS02H) [14390] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [14391] So you can't blame people in that respect really.
Stuart (PS02H) [14392] So it's, if you want to get it done this will be one
               hell of a big car park won't it?

               minutes on the phone and I've got the information for you, but
               if you've got a sleepless night, that's not worth it.
Stuart (PS02H) [14709] No.

None (PS6TB)   [14711] Still that doesn't matter if, because if I put ...
(PS001)        [...]

Stuart (PS02H) [14713] in case it makes a difference to your
None (PS6TB)   [14714] hang on, I have got the figures here ...
None (PS6TB)   [14715] Erm, twelve ninety, twelve ninety four, erm I, I don't
               think [...]

Stuart (PS02H) [14731] a little bit cheaper
None (PS6TB)   [14732] absolutely, yeah
Stuart (PS02H) [14733] Fair enough, as long as though we [...] honest
None (PS6TB)   [14734] Well I think you know, you, you, you, it was an honest
               answer to, to both questions, cos they didn't say do you smoke a
               pipe, that you smoke you know or whatever or just said
               cigarettes.
Stuart (PS02H) [14735] Don't smoke cigarettes and I thought no [...] when it
               comes back it may work out much cheaper.
None (PS6TB)   [14736] Yeah, that's right.

               price of the house just under the stamp duty.
Ann (PS02G)    [14923] Yeah so they could so they could, didn't have to pay it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14924] So they didn't have to pay it.
Ann (PS02G)    [14925] I mean what is stamp duty?
               [14926] It's ridiculous really isn't it?
Jeanie (PS02L) [14927] Oh god that's government.
Ann (PS02G)    [14928] That's it.
               [14929] Why should they have a cut of it?

               that or not now.
Ann (PS02G)    [14940] I don't know whether they do that.
               [14941] I know it's quite, the stamp duty can come to a lot of
               money can't it?
Jeanie (PS02L) [14942] Yeah.
               [14943] And mine did.

Ann (PS02G)    [14946] Yeah, you had it out the other day.
               [14947] It's a lot of money.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14948] I didn't think it would be that.
               [14949] Well the solicitor just took that off the price of the
               house.
Ann (PS02G)    [14950] Well that's it, they just they just see to it all.
               [14951] You don't know how many, how much

               selling a house.
Ann (PS02G)    [14953] No.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14954] You're just buying a house.
Ann (PS02G)    [14955] Mm.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14956] You know, so ... ooh they're crafty aren't they?
               [14957] Never mind, not to worry.
               [14958] Not to worry, all these things come to try you.
Ann (PS02G)    [14959] Yeah.
               [14960] ... We signed all the forms anyway so that's something.
               [14961] [laugh] But with his being tied up with a pension he
               gets twelve thousand pension as well.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14962] Oh, that's alright.
               [14963] ... But then if he if he ever needs
Ann (PS02G)    [14964] Once he retires.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14965] Yeah but what happens if he snuffs it?
               [14966] Is that house paid for Ann?
Ann (PS02G)    [14967] Oh yeah.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14968] Oh that's alright.
               [14969] That's covered.

               [14976] He had to put your name down on it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14977] Did he?
Ann (PS02G)    [14978] As you're next er his next of kin and you will ... [...]
               the property will become yours.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14979] You'll have to
Stuart (PS02H) [14980] Is that alright?
Jeanie (PS02L) [14981] You'll have to make a will now then.
Stuart (PS02H) [14982] If you don't want all the ... chips don't bother
Ann (PS02G)    [14983] Oh I don't want as that, I didn't want as that.
               [14984] I said a couple.
Stuart (PS02H) [14985] Well that is a couple.
Ann (PS02G)    [laugh]
Jeanie (PS02L) [14986] I say ... he'll have to make a will now.
               [14987] So that you'll be the beneficiary.
Ann (PS02G)    [14988] Don't matter does it?
Jeanie (PS02L) [14989] No, but you should do.
               [14990] Aye it does matter!
               [14991] Does matter.
Ann (PS02G)    [14992] I say I can't see you saying right ... he's died tom
               today, out tomorrow can you? [laugh]
Jeanie (PS02L) [14993] I didn't think I'd get anything anyway.
Ann (PS02G)    [14994] You're his next of kin you see.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14995] Am I?
Ann (PS02G)    [14996] Mm.
Jeanie (PS02L) [14997] How about his father?
               [14998] ... Yeah, how about his father?
Ann (PS02G)    [14999] [...] he didn't mention it.
               [15000] Your name's on it now.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15001] Yeah but his father's his next of kin just as much as I
               am Ann.
               [15002] [...] put that out, I'll put that out ... cos you'll not
               get any peace.
               [15003] You won't get any peace Ann.
               [15004] I'll put that out.
Ann (PS02G)    [15005] Well your name's on it so that's it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15006] Yeah but I was just saying, when you think about it.
               [15007] See, there's all these complications.
               [15008] ... If anything happens to me.
Ann (PS02G)    [15009] Yeah but if you're the named person.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15010] Yeah.
               [15011] ... I don't know whether his father is [...] ...
               probably is isn't he?
Ann (PS02G)    [15012] Mhm.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15013] See if you think about that don't you?
               [15014] ... It's the same with anything to me, if I leave this
               house to Sheila and Bruce ... if anything happened to Sheila
               Bruce would get it.
               [15015] You know.
Ann (PS02G)    [15016] [...] Sh Sheila's dad.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15017] Shouldn't, he should really but I don't really want that
               to happen [laugh] .
Ann (PS02G)    [15018] [laugh] And that's the law isn't it?
Jeanie (PS02L) [15019] Shouldn't say that, should I?
               [15020] I know.
               [15021] ... When my mother met, we were met you know ... when we
               got married the solicitor had us in because he wanted us to make
               a will because see ... we didn't take the money that we got from
               mum.
               [15022] But if anything had happened to me ... any of her
               husbands could.
Stuart (PS02H) [15023] Is that alright dear?
Ann (PS02G)    [15024] Lovely thank you.

               know dad [...] cos he didn't leave a will.
               [15027] But when we got married see that complicated things
               because ... if anything had happened to me
Ann (PS02G)    [15028] Your husband would have been entitled to it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15029] yo my husband was entitled to it.
Ann (PS02G)    [15030] That's it. ...
Jeanie (PS02L) [15031] Well there you are.

               do you?
Ann (PS02G)    [15236] No, cos there's a lot of batter
Jeanie (PS02L) [15237] There's a lot of batter.

               [15631] ... I mean really anybody can say anything if you don't,
               if they don't look into it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15632] No that's
Ann (PS02G)    [15633] I could say I've never had an illness in me life and
               whatever can't I?
               [15634] Anybody could s
Jeanie (PS02L) [15635] That's right.

Ann (PS02G)    [15640] You know I mean anybody could say anything.
               [15641] I could say no I've never had an illness.
               [15642] I mean it wouldn't be the truth but you, if they didn't
               look into it you could say it couldn't you?
Jeanie (PS02L) [15643] That's right. [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [15644] And no doubt some people who would try that kind of
               thing isn't there?

               [15653] But you don't think
Stuart (PS02H) [15654] For the pension purpose, for the pension plan a medical
               is not needed.
               [15655] That is, doesn't matter.
Ann (PS02G)    [15656] Oh well.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15657] Oh.
Stuart (PS02H) [15658] The only thing that I might need a medical for is my

Jeanie (PS02L) [15659] Oh.
               [15660] ... Well, that's what I mean.

               January cos you get thirty thousand quid if you bump him off.

Jeanie (PS02L) [15774] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [15775] understanding and just signing papers.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15776] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [15777] At least he knows and he
Jeanie (PS02L) [15778] What you're doing.
Ann (PS02G)    [15779] questions and he, he understands it all.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15780] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [15781] Which a lot of people would, say they go and sit down
               there and they say ... blah blah blah sign here and
Jeanie (PS02L) [15782] It's not fair but that is what happens.
Ann (PS02G)    [15783] It's what happens because you don't understand all the
Jeanie (PS02L) [15784] No.
Ann (PS02G)    [15785] terms and the things they use.
               [15786] You don't know what they're on about.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15787] No you don't.
Ann (PS02G)    [15788] I mean even today he'd made a mistake on that thing and
               you spotted it where I wouldn't have done.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15789] Oh my god.
               [15790] He must be
Ann (PS02G)    [15791] He didn't take tax relief off.
               [15792] Cos Stuart will get tax relief and he hadn't put that
               down.
               [15793] But Stuart noticed it straight away.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15794] I is he much cop, this bloke?
Stuart (PS02H) [15795] I think ... I mean, it's something, a pension mortgage
               is something that doesn't crop up ... every day.
Ann (PS02G)    [15796] No, not many peo ... you've got ... I don't know why.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15797] They don't know how to cope with it.
Ann (PS02G)    [15798] I don't know why it doesn't crop up because it's cheaper
               than an ordinary one, so why it doesn't
Jeanie (PS02L) [15799] Because they don't want ... yeah well you you'd better
               tell your mates at work that.
Ann (PS02G)    [15800] Why it doesn't I don't know.
               [15801] I don't understand that.
               [15802] And not only does
Jeanie (PS02L) [15803] Is it cheaper than an ordinary one?
Ann (PS02G)    [15804] Well it is as mu it's ... it's worked out a few pounds
               cheaper.
Stuart (PS02H) [15805] It can ... it can be yeah.
               [15806] It can [...]
Ann (PS02G)    [15807] But not only that at the end he's also, as well as the
               house he's getting a pension as well instead of just the house.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15808] Well that's what I mean.
               [15809] That's what I mean.
               [15810] You get a pe just an ordinary pension, thing, you know
               ... mortgage.
               [15811] You don't get a pension at the end of it.
               [15812] ... You're gonna get a pension as well.
Ann (PS02G)    [15813] Well that's it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15814] Well that's not bad. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [15815] Well er I'd never heard of it.
               [15816] ... I'd never heard of it.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15817] Not only that you see ... alright the mortgage rates
               might go up but ... I mean if you're working your wages are
               gonna go up Stuart.
               [15818] Aren't they?
               [15819] ... You'll have a pay rise and and you're gonna still be
               paying s you know?
               [15820] So as the years go past
Ann (PS02G)    [15821] Pay an average amount of your wage, whatever.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15822] As the years go past ... I mean if the wages go up as
               they have done, you know, regularly ... your mortgage is gonna
               gonna gonna be smaller.
Ann (PS02G)    [15823] Yeah that's that's what happens with people now.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15824] Yeah.
Ann (PS02G)    [15825] People who are paying seventy eighty pound a month
               mortgage who've had them for years and then
Jeanie (PS02L) [15826] Years.
               [15827] That's right.
               [15828] And the same thing will happen to you, see.
               [15829] And then you'll be pleased.
Ann (PS02G)    [15830] Yeah.
Jeanie (PS02L) [15831] You've started.
               [15832] I mean I know it's hard to start with.
               [15833] Isn't it?
               [15834] ... It is difficult. ...
Ann (PS02G)    [15835] But we've got all that side sorted out haven't we? ...
Jeanie (PS02L) [15836] It's difficult.
               [15837] ... I mean we paid eight qui , eight pound a month
Ann (PS02G)    [15838] Er er
Jeanie (PS02L) [15839] and that was a hell of a lot of money.
Ann (PS02G)    [15840] Yeah well that's it, if your wages are only eight quid a
               week [laughing] if you're paying a month's wa

               safest ... investment.
               [15974] It was a ... at the time it was a ... I'd got the money
               and it was a bit of a speculation.

               [15999] That's right.
               [16000] Until the market picks up again and ...
Ann (PS02G)    [16001] I mean it's not a good investment is it?
               [16002] ... Speculative.

Stuart (PS02H) [16015] Didn't matter so much at that particular time.
               [16016] And the ... market looked as though it was gonna be ...
               quite buoyant.
               [16017] I wish I'd have took them out a long while ago when they
               were ... higher.
Ann (PS02G)    [16018] Mm invested them somewhere else.
Stuart (PS02H) [16019] Well yeah, but like you say you don't know do you?
