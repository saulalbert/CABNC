*STU:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	And picked us up and I went in there and I were   (.) yeah half past eleven time.I mean it was a bit loud because it was live music I suppose but   (.) it wasn't a bad night  (        ) . (        ) got lively.

*ANN:	Might even have had my Steven in   (        ) wouldn't have known him.
*STU:	Yeah, he would.
*ANN:	How do you know?
*STU:	Because there wasn't a tall   (.) slim   (.) ginger-haired chap in   (        ) 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	I did think it, well I did think it was a possibility but I mean 
*ANN:	Probably his mother and father   (.) her mother and father had been in there anyway.
*STU:	 (        ) there's a little boy there'd be no chance of him   (.) going in there anyway.
*ANN:	Oh no, course not.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Course not.
*STU:	So
*ANN:	I'm going soft in the   (.) her mum and dad'll probably be in.That's their regular   (        ) if they were having a   (.) country and western they would ask him to do it because he's
*STU:	What's his   (.) what's her mum and dad look like?
*ANN:	He's big.He's a, such a big fella.Fat. (.) Sue's mum's little and fat, nearly as tall as she's   [laughing] broad  [] .But dad's a   (        ) 
*STU:	Maybe they were in the lounge perhaps.
*ANN:	bigger   (.) I mean he he he's at least as tall as you if not bigger and er also  (.) 
*STU:	Sort of Tom  size?
*ANN:	Yeah. (.) And she's about the same size round but about five foot two. ((laugh)) .
*STU:	Well I didn't see anybody
*ANN:	Sue's a big girl.She's as tall as me and   (.) weighs nearly
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	she must weight fourteen, fifteen stone I should think.Sue's   (.) big 
*STU:	Well then I certainly didn't see anybody in there looking like that. (.) I must admit. (.) 
*ANN:	Oh she usually goes after bingo.They'll probably be in all night and she's just walked up from the bingo and   (.) toddle in there.
*STU:	No I didn't see anybody looking like that so   (.) I don't know.
*ANN:	I wouldn't think they'd be in the lounge.They could be but I wouldn't have thought so.
*STU:	Thursday night anyway I wouldn't, does she go to the Empire   (        ) 
*ANN:	Well I don't really know do I?Empire.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Do they have it Wednesday night   (        ) bingo?
*STU:	 (        ) Thursday night don't they, bingo?

*STU:	Thursday night not at the Empire.Wednesday night the Empire, Friday night  (        ) .Thursday night  (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh well she wouldn't be there after the bingo then would she? (.) Probably went to   (.) I know that she does go  (        ) .She   (        ) there most of the evening and she goes to bingo and
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Cos they live    (.)  (        ) down round near Tina's but   (.) not like Tina's house, before that   (.) off Allard Avenue round the back of Allard Avenue. (.) Sherwood is it?
*STU:	Sherwood, yeah Sherwood Avenue .
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah they live up   (        ) yeah. (.) So it's not that far for The Loco really.
*STU:	No just a   (.) short walk.
*ANN:	It's sort of their local type of thing. (.)  (        ) anyway but   (.) Well Ann is going   (.) to retire.I suppose you're gonna have a bottle and a fag.Mind you, the smell of you I think you've had sufficient bottles but
*STU:	 (        ) well   (        )  (.) 
*ANN:	Told you not to drink much.
*STU:	I did n't.

*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	 (        ) if it is  (        ) .That's what they want.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Natural conversations so
*ANN:	Not sure how natural though  ((laugh)) 
*STU:	 ((laugh)) I'll have a can of beer and   (.) then I'll probably go to bed. (        ) 
*ANN:	We haven't got any left.I drunk them.
*STU:	They've gone have they?
*ANN:	Mhm.
*STU:	Oh.I'd better have a bottle then.

*ANN:	Oh I wish you'd have been at home, I'd have gone round there.
*STU:	What've they been up to now then?
*ANN:	Oh god!She's been screaming.He's been   (.) reckon she must have locked herself up in the dark.And the only place with a lock on is the bathroom and I reckon they'll blooming knock the blooming door down by the sound of it.
*STU:	Gawd.
*BRI:	She was screaming, he was swearing.Running up and down the stairs.
*STU:	What time was this?
*ANN:	Quarter to ten till about half past ten.Or half an hour till half past ten  (        ) 
*STU:	Well that wouldn't please them next door would it?
*ANN:	No.
*STU:	Coo. (        ) 
*ANN:	And and really I mean you can't   (.) I'm I'm s I'm saying that you, you can't interfere but   (.) by god I'd long for someone to come in and interfere. (.) I really would have done.And er er I   (.) I could never understand why people   (.) that obviously could hear what went on   (.) and pretended they never. (.) I know you don't wanna get involved
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	and this that and the other   (.) but people must have heard what went on and and   (.) you know the next morning they'd see a black eye and just carry out a normal conversation as though 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	and you know they hadn't heard it all and
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	ooh have you had a fall or something?Then you know I mean they must have   (        ) what was going on oh aye they just completely   (.) ignore it.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	I'd be walking round   (.) if I could get around.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	It were just you know oh it's a nice morning when I'm hanging the washing out as though everything was wonderful you know   ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	normal.
*STU:	Yes.
*ANN:	Ooh I thought he was going to, ooh I felt   (.) made me go cold and I   (.) I thought if, if I hadn't been here on my own I'd have been very tempted to go round and   (.) and say is there anything I can do. (.) Or I'd have called the police I think.I weren't sure what I'd have done but
*STU:	Bad as that?
*ANN:	Oh  (        ) .He was a calling her effing this, swearing oh it was dreadful.She was screaming and you could hear her crying.Then you hear, she pounded up the bloody stairs and he was after her   (.) and I reckon   (.) well the only room with a lock  (.) 
*STU:	As you say is the bathroom.
*ANN:	is the bathroom, so she must have been in there cos he's hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it. (.) Bloody hell of a row. (.) Or whether she opened it or whether she was in the front bedroom with something behind the door I dunno but  (.) 
*STU:	That's his
*ANN:	and she run back down the stairs and the front door was opening and banging and shutting, whether she run outside or what   (.) I don't know what happened, the dog was bloody barking.
*STU:	Oh lord. (.) 
*ANN:	Well it's a wonder Ann and Rita haven't done something about it.
*STU:	Well I say it's er   (.) amazing they've not said, said something   (        ) 
*ANN:	And they had company as well there's a car there, blue car. (.) 
*STU:	Who Ann and Rita or?
*ANN:	Or Ann and Rita.I don't know.
*STU:	 (        ) Sally innit?
*ANN:	I don't know who it was. (        ) 
*STU:	It was Sally if it was a blue e , blue cavalier. (.) T D O something something something.
*ANN:	Sally can't drive so it must be some
*STU:	Can't she?
*ANN:	 (        ) Her latest beau I should think, I don't know.
*STU:	Maybe.Maybe maybe. (.) 
*ANN:	But it was   (.) I mean I could hear it over the telly. (.) I know I don't have the telly on full blast but   (.) I could hear it
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	above the telly.When I first heard the first noise I thought what the bloody hell's that and I turned the sound down.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Thought bloody hell, put it back up but you could, it was really distressing me cos
*STU:	You knew what was possibly going on.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	A woman and that don't s I mean   (.) if you're having just an argument   (.) it's raised voices but a woman doesn't scream and   (.) cry like that unless  (.) 
*STU:	Unless there's something really
*ANN:	something awful going on.
*STU:	Mm. (.) 
*ANN:	I mean Ann and Rita reckon they're not married or anything but why the hell does she stay with him then?She's not got a bloody
*STU:	Well there you go I mean 
*ANN:	she's got no children.They're only young. (.) It's her house.Isn't his. (.) He couldn't, she bought it without, with her father and
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	and he come and lived with her in it. (.) Bloody hell.I know I mean I stayed with him but I had three kids.
*STU:	Gonna say you're you're  (        ) 
*ANN:	I had three kids, where could I go with them?
*STU:	Mm.Mm.
*ANN:	If I'd have been on me own I mean that's all I was waiting for, mine to grow up so I could clear off.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	If I'd have been on me own I wouldn't have stopped bloody long. (.) I mean even if she walks out he doesn't, no court in the land would give him the house if it's hers. (.)  (        ) evicted and then she could come back again.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	Well if she went to the police they'd chuck him out.He has no legal rights to the property.It's in her name, she's, her father's helping her   (.) paid the deposit or something and she clears the mortgage   (.) she has no right, he has no right to it all if she went to the police.They'd just turf him out wouldn't they?
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	Well why stay in a relationship like that? (.) Don't understand it. (.) 
*STU:	Certainly a bit rough, a bit hard.
*ANN:	Went quiet about half past ten so whether he buggered off out or what I don't know.
*STU:	Mm maybe.
*ANN:	Certainly the front door was opening and banging and shutting.
*STU:	Say I'm surprised Ann and Rita haven't sort of didn't
*ANN:	Well banging on the wall probably with all the other banging and   ((laugh)) 
*STU:	May maybe.Maybe.They   (        ) part of the banging.
*ANN:	So much bloody banging going on.
*STU:	Probably part of the banging   (.) Ann and Rita.
*ANN:	And the people on this side   (        ) you don't know how they were reacting as well.Say, they was a quite young couple.We don't hear them that much do we? (.) Mornings is the   (.) time I hear them most.Cos they go out to work at half past eight and you hear them between half past seven and half past eight
