@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 026503)
*CLA:	I can't see Mike and Robin making   [laughing] a cake   []  (        ) , can you?
*NIN:	No.No but
*CLA:	Not  (        ) , no no no. (        ) Robin necessarily but   (.) just   (        ) temperaments   (        ) 
*NIN:	I don't know but well I remember going out   (.) shopping and when I came back you'd got
*CLA:	Jill.
*NIN:	you'd gone out.No they were, they were all of them there.
*CLA:	Were they?
*NIN:	Nan and I were out shopping.When we got back
*CLA:	Mm?
*NIN:	 (.) it was christmas shopping I think.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	Anyway   (.) you'd been out and bought one of those m packets of m cake mix.
*CLA:	 [laughing] Oh it would be ready mixed, yes  [] .
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) Well   (.) and they'd made little buns. ((laugh)) They were very nice really. (.) 
*CLA:	Oh it's a tribute to the
*NIN:	The state of the kitchen wasn't. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Well   (.) that'll be a tribute to the manufacturer, sure.Mm well I rem 
*NIN:	And Robin and L and erm   (.) Carol doing that er cabbage   (.) cabbage 
*CLA:	Oh that revolting 
*NIN:	That was horrible.
*CLA:	That was terrible. (.) I remember Jill though.I don't remember the mix but mm I don't know that, I vaguely remember now, yes but
*NIN:	Oh they were all there
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	because we'd gone out, I think it was the christmas shopping we were doing on our own.
*CLA:	Was it?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm.Yes I've got a hazy recollection but  (        ) .Mm. (.) Jill'll remember.But she was a lot younger surely, Jill?And she'd be a bit 
*NIN:	Oh she'd be young, erm
*CLA:	Younger than them I mean.
*NIN:	They weren't, oh they were younger than Carol Caroline and erm Ken.
*CLA:	Mm mm mm. (.) Mm.
*NIN:	But then   (.) look at Chris.He must have been interested in cooking, mustn't he?
*CLA:	I don't   (        ) Chris 
*NIN:	No I think the young fellows today are more because of course they go into the flats don't they?
*CLA:	Mm well that's true of course.
*NIN:	I remember when Mike and Robin went into their flats I   (.) spent quite a long time with them 
*CLA:	Yeah I know.Mm.Mm.Mhm.
*NIN:	Showing them how to do simple dishes.
*CLA:	Mhm. (.) But erm   (.) quite frankly I can't see myself ever getting   (.) given the same sort of circumstances.
*NIN:	Well n no.
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	I can't either. [laughing] Knowing you I    []  (.) no it's laughable.
*CLA:	Yeah. (.) 
*NIN:	Can't imagine you meeting me with a nice cooked dinner and a   (.) a cake   [laughing] made by yo your own fair 
*CLA:	 (        ) No I 
*NIN:	with a candle on  [] .
*CLA:	No. (.) Use a soldering iron or a blow lamp or something, not  ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	 ((laugh))  (.) Burnt toast.
*CLA:	Ah no, it's not really burnt, it's the way I like it though.Must admit technically 
*NIN:	Well it used to smoke. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Well yes technically speaking I suppose it is burnt but   (.) well done I   (        ) 
*NIN:	Well it doesn't taste very nice.
*CLA:	I can't agree cos I, that's how I like it.
*NIN:	And the s Well you used to scrape some of it off because it was all over the   (        ) 
*CLA:	Oh if it gets really charred I know but
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	if it's really charred that's a bit 
*NIN:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*CLA:	Certain degree of grey blackness even but  (.) 
*NIN:	And how d'you get toast   (.) charred so that you've got to scrape it off but it isn't burnt?Oh I  ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Well leaving it that little bit too long, you know.
*NIN:	 (        )  (.) 
*CLA:	 [laughing] Remember Ro Robin coming home    (.)  (        ) I don't believe it, burnt   (.) burnt toast   [] from an electric toaster.I don't know how he does it. ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	I don't know. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh))  (.) Mm. (.) Oh well. (.) Doesn't feel like Sunday   (        ) does it?
*NIN:	No. (.) I've not seen any more sight of that heron.
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	I don't, I think it was just a flash in the pan.
*CLA:	I don't think, well.
*NIN:	I don't think   (.) I'm certain there's not 
*CLA:	I think it's much to do about nothing quite honestly.
*NIN:	I do. (.) 
*CLA:	I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some sort of er
*NIN:	Well I don't feel like having a plastic heron. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Well I mean how do all the rest of the pond they've not all got bloody herons, plastic herons perched on the side have they?
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	Plastic   (        ) 
*NIN:	But you know d'you remember me going round the corner and seeing that erm  (.) 
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	 (        ) pond with all those plastic ducks on?
*CLA:	Flipping ducks on it.Yeah I know.
*NIN:	That might have been some   (.) deterrent of some description.
*CLA:	I don't think so somehow.That was just   (        ) 
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) but I'm n I'm certainly not having little plastic ducks 
*CLA:	Art nouveau.
*NIN:	and   (.) little gnomes about.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) That's interesting er   (.) that erm   (.) comment Steve made about the   (.) postcard.And the bird of prey silhouette, you know?I can 
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	believe that being   (.) rather effective.
*NIN:	Well actually I have read about the heron that er I think was it   (.) I'm not sure that   (        ) 
*CLA:	What the plastic   ((laugh)) plastic heron  (        ) ?
*NIN:	Oh   (        ) yes.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) Mm.
*NIN:	No way. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Mm. (.) But that silhouette business, that could work you know.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	I can see that working. (.) Birds of prey.
*NIN:	Well   (.) really when you think, it's only the same way as   (.) er laying the hose amongst your flower beds.For cats.
*CLA:	Oh the snake you mean?Yeah.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm   (.) I've still to have that proved to me to be honest.It's a damn great snake 
*NIN:	Well I have.
*CLA:	isn't it?If you think about it.
*NIN:	Yes.Well I think   (.) well, you know when we used to leave ours across the, the lawn there?
*CLA:	Mm, yeah.
*NIN:	Well S 
*CLA:	Cat didn't bother.
*NIN:	Samba no he
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	Well he did a he did for a bit.
*CLA:	Are you sure?
*NIN:	 (        ) Yes, I've watched him sort of er   (.) warily 
*CLA:	Waiting 
*NIN:	walk round.But then he got so used to it that he didn't bother.
*CLA:	Mm, yeah.That's what I mean.It may, if it's any effect at all it's very short lived I think.
*NIN:	Mm.I don't think pepper's a very useful deterrent.I've sprinkled loads of 
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	pepper round.
*CLA:	One shower of rain and you've lost it anyway.
*NIN:	Mm. (.) 
*CLA:	I'd have thought. (.) Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	I think the only deterrent is putting   (.) netting or something over it but er
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	you can't put netting over your whole garden can you?It's silly.
*CLA:	No no. (.) We'll have to watch that pond though    (        )  (.) leaves next year.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Well this year of course. (        )  (.) Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Well I can't really see what you can do, only have netting over that when the leaves start to fall.
*CLA:	Well yes   ((cough)) I could be a little bit more erm   (.) atten  ((cough)) attentive to the damn thing couldn't I? (.) We need to sca scrape quite a lot of that out but erm   (.) not all by any means. (.) See a certain percentage have blown in I think off the grass and if I had some sort of a 
*NIN:	I was just er yeah.I was just gonna say that.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	I think our problem here is it gets so windy with being on the corner.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm. (.) Yeah. (.) 
*NIN:	D'you want any more tea?
*CLA:	Oh yes please.But I think   (.) mm   (.) mm.
*NIN:	That was a silly question wasn't it?
*CLA:	It was unnecessary wasn't it? (.)  (        ) oh yes I'll want a bit of a hand then.With   (.) the top window
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	I've left it with two screws holding it at the moment.As we did, (        ) painting the outside yeah.
*NIN:	Yes.I it won't blow out though?
*CLA:	No not at all.I'm gonna hold it while you take the two final screws out.
*NIN:	Oh I see. (        ) ?
*CLA:	 ((cough)) Yeah. ((cough)) Cos it's almost impossible to get at it. (.)  ((cough))  (.) 
*NIN:	It won't erm   (.) I think
*CLA:	What?
*NIN:	once you've got the window done it won't be too bad will it?
*CLA:	You mean the whole frame?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	And the opening light?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	It won't be too bad, will it?
*NIN:	Oh I mean, what I mean is you've not
*CLA:	Well there's not a tremendous amount of burning left.There's only   (.) one skirting board   ((clears throat)) and the pipe cover.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	The casing round the other cupboard.
*NIN:	Mm. (.) 
*CLA:	And that's it I think.And possibly the edges of the cupboard doors, I don't know.
*NIN:	Yes, they're not very brilliant.
*CLA:	No. (.) Mm certainly want cleaning up.I may end up taking them off completely though. ((cough)) I think that may be easier to do   ((cough)) rather than do them in situ, you know? (.)  (        )  (.)  ((sigh)) 
*NIN:	Are you going to have a piece of cake?
*CLA:	Oh yeah.
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	He's done this in two   (.) and then sandwiched them together.
*CLA:	What two cakes and put them together, he's?
*NIN:	Yes.Well I used to do that.
*CLA:	Mm. (.)  ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	It's quite good though.
*CLA:	Mm.I'm trying to remember, did they have any, the kids?
*NIN:	Erm
*CLA:	I know they cut some for them but  (.) 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	It's a wonder Caroline didn't. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	She usually stuffs doesn't she?
*CLA:	Mm.Well yes. (.)  (        ) 
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*NIN:	Did Jill say what time Caroline's appointment was?
*CLA:	No.Er well   (.) not to me she didn't.
*NIN:	No well.She pro she might have done to me but I can't remember.
*CLA:	In the afternoon. (.) They seem very confident they'll be back in time don't they?
*NIN:	Twenty five to four to meet   (.) young
*CLA:	Yeah.Pick him up at twenty five to four. (.) 
*NIN:	There's a heck of a lot of burning off when you come to think of all the burning off of paint we're going to have to do.
*CLA:	Oh god I know.You're telling me. ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	But then 
*CLA:	Where possible I'll sand down obviously but there's   (.) there 
*NIN:	Yes but usually 
*CLA:	won't be many places I'd have thought.
*NIN:	There isn't.It's
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	Cos it's been piled on so
*CLA:	Yeah.I can't get over that screw in the woodwork.
*NIN:	I know!
*CLA:	Good god.I've seen dust before but   (.) and bits of fluff and rag and stuff but I've never seen a bloody, and a nail   (.) damn great screw!
*NIN:	Well it's the same as the, the way they've papered the walls round.They've just papered over things.You know?
*CLA:	They've papered over, [laughing] I know  [] .I know.Mm.
*NIN:	It wouldn't have been, if they'd had any furniture in when we, when we first got in   (.) I wouldn't have been surprised to see it painted round there as well. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Oh the   (        ) you mean?Oh aye.
*NIN:	 (        ) mm.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) Mm. (.) No, coming back to the   ((clears throat))  (        ) . (.) I would prefer to keep it in natural wood if we can but 
*NIN:	Oh yeah.
*CLA:	all those splodges of white   (.) are putty.
*NIN:	Are they?
*CLA:	Mm.Unfortunately. (.) 
*NIN:	And there's nothing at all you can cover them with?
*CLA:	Well   (.) except to take them out.Scrape the bits of putty out     (.)  (        )  (.) and put some   (.) filler in that will accept stain.
*NIN:	I think that'd be better.
*CLA:	Mm.But that's a   [laughing] fairly long   [] job though.
*NIN:	Er yes, but I mean it it   (.) it would be worth it. (.) 
*CLA:	Mm. (.) See it won't accept stain anyway   (.) with that varnish on.
*NIN:	Well I don't like this colour stain anyway.
*CLA:	Well I don't.
*NIN:	It's a nasty colour.
*CLA:	You can't burn that off though.It's dust.
*NIN:	You couldn't 
*CLA:	What?
*NIN:	just give a dab of paint over?A dark paint.
*CLA:	It'd stand out a mile wouldn't it?
*NIN:	Would it?
*CLA:	Well   (.) perhaps not as   (.) obviously 
*NIN:	Well if you did it with a small brush?
*CLA:	Well it would still stand out wouldn't it cos it's a different colour?Mm.Not as 
*NIN:	You don't 
*CLA:	not as obvious perhaps as the white but 
*NIN:	That's what I mean.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm. (.) But I'll have to get rid of all that varnish before it'll take any other stain.
*NIN:	Mm.See what it's like. (.) 
*CLA:	I   (.) what it's like when?
*NIN:	When you've got rid of the varnish.
*CLA:	Mm.I may have to use varnish stripper.Get a kind of varnish stripper for it.
*NIN:	Well it might be better than erm   (.) doing it any other way because
*CLA:	I don't think it'll burn off. (.) 
*NIN:	No I'm thinking of the fumes. (.) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh))  (.) After all the other fumes I don't think that'll matter.
*NIN:	After what?
*CLA:	After the fumes of the paintwork, I don't think that'll  (.) 
*NIN:	Won't that be worse than  (        ) ?
*CLA:	No.Not as bad as.No no.
*NIN:	Oh. (.) Cos I remember when you did twenty seven.
*CLA:	Mm.Ah well that was a varnish paint.
*NIN:	That was quite 
*CLA:	That was a varnish paint.
*NIN:	And that won't, that'll just be    (.)  (        ) stain?
*CLA:	Varnish.No.It is a stain varnish. (.)  (        )  (.) In other words varnish, with a stain added to the varnish before you apply it.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it with 
*NIN:	Oh I see.
*CLA:	relatively clear varnish. (.) 
*NIN:	Mm. (.) Once we've got those tiles off at the bottom there
*CLA:	Mm?
*NIN:	well we might as well paint   (        ) 
*CLA:	Well I think, I mean they're very nice, it would rather, I'd prefer to, it would be nice to have   (.) tile there to break it  (        ) , but not those damn things and they certainly won't come off and go back. (.) 
*NIN:	They're a bit messy aren't they?
*CLA:	Mm. (.) One two three four five six seven eight, twenty four.Two dozen. (.) Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	How many did we get in the pack?
*CLA:	The pack.I don't know  (        ) .
*NIN:	I think it was twenty five.
*CLA:	I really don't know.Oh it varies, the pack doesn't it?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Think it is twenty five actually. (        ) pack anyway  (        ) .
*NIN:	But erm   (.) finding the right tile  (        ) .
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	In any case you don't want them all the same do you?I think we're better off just snapping it off.Wonder what state the wall's in?
*CLA:	Doesn't really matter all that much.I'd skim over the plaster anyway.
*NIN:	Mm.Be a right mess won't it?
*CLA:	Mm. (.) It's highly probable I'll finish up skimming anyway.
*NIN:	Mm I was just thinking that.
*CLA:	 (        ) mm.
*NIN:	I mean the way, what have they done here? (.) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) Well what have they done anywhere? (.) Mm.
*NIN:	Well they ran short of tiles or they ha they wouldn't be bothered cutting.I bet 
*CLA:	That's more likely the case.Mm.
*NIN:	One two three four  (        ) 
*CLA:	Twenty four.
*NIN:	five six seven eight  (.) 
*CLA:	Twenty four on this front face wasn't there?
*NIN:	Yes, there was three more there.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	So that ma er in any case they'd of got   (.) some of it being the two colours.
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	It looks quite effective  (        ) .
*CLA:	Oh it's quite effective if it's done correctly, yes. (.) As it is now it's bloody awful.
*NIN:	Have you had some cake?
*CLA:	Er no I'll give it a   (.) miss right now thankyou.I'm a bit full   (        ) from my sandwich. (.) No I I'll enjoy it more 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	later on.No no.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Cup of tea would go down like a bomb but
*NIN:	 (        ) you've not eaten it. (.) 
*CLA:	Possibly yes.Mm.Mhm. (.) I meant to ask, oh  (.) 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	 (        ) Aha aha. (.) 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Pardon?
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Right. (        )  (.)  ((cough)) Right. ((cough))  (.)  (        ) 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	 ((cough)) Pardon?
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Er oh yes, yes I have actually. (.) 
*NIN:	Let's put this cake back in its tin. (.) 
*CLA:	I'll have a cup of tea then bash on with my window then I think.
*NIN:	Well the sooner it's finished  (        ) 
*CLA:	Well, yes because it is at least dry today.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	But erm   (.) It's gonna make a hell of a racket sanding down afterwards you know.
*NIN:	Well it can't be helped.
*CLA:	No it can't be helped, no. (.) I'll probably have to get some medium grade paper too. (.) Cos I've got a lot of gr fine and coarse but  (.) 
*NIN:	 (        ) with us making a row won't they?
*CLA:	I can't think that all that much goes through you know, to be honest. (.) Obviously 
*NIN:	Yeah well but by and large we've not 
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	really been on their wall have we?
*CLA:	No that's what I mean.
*NIN:	 [laughing] When we start down here   (        )  [] .
*CLA:	Some of the heavier banging and the, the high pitch   (.) high frequency erm   (.) noises like me drill and erm  (.) 
*NIN:	Just keep it down to erm 
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	a minimum   (        ) keep
*CLA:	Yeah yeah.
*NIN:	not do it late, just keep stopping before it gets too late.
*CLA:	Well exactly what we have been doing.
*NIN:	Cos it is annoying isn't it, you know?
*CLA:	Oh yeah. (.) 
*NIN:	But there's not an awful lot you can do is there?I mean if we had a firm of workmen in they'd   (        ) 
*CLA:	They'd still do, yeah.
*NIN:	they'd make   [laughing] more noise   [] wouldn't they?
*CLA:	Oh rather more noise, yeah.
*NIN:	But erm
*CLA:	And the clatter of tea cups. ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	But then I was   (.) meant to mention, ask Rachel if she'd seen the photograph cos Mike didn't know   (.) about the two photographs that er Rachel and Louise have taken.
*NIN:	Mm.Have I given yours, has yours got sugar in?
*CLA:	I don't know.
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	I really don't know. (.) 
*NIN:	I'm not sure whether that has ha I can usually tell er I've
*CLA:	Well you claim to be able to.
*NIN:	No I think it's, I can normally, yeah.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Mm. (.) I'm glad I found out what that is.
*CLA:	Yeah.What the hell's it called, a what?
*NIN:	Erm
*CLA:	Something anemone wasn't it?
*NIN:	Anemone blander 
*CLA:	Oh yes?
*NIN:	 [reading] February to April.Requires f the first to flower is A blander.February to April.Requires full sun as flowers close in shady conditions.
*CLA:	Mm will it get it there?
*NIN:	Grow it in the rockery   (.) or naturali naturalize it in grassland  [] .
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	That sounds like it.
*CLA:	Well it looks like the illustration doesn't it?
*NIN:	Well it looks li yes.It does.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Mm can go by the leaves, I thought the leaves look like it too. (.) Well we look like getting, if it spreads 
*CLA:	Has it   (.) yeah 
*NIN:	as much as it has there we look like getting  (        ) .
*CLA:	Has it got the same number of petals on it?
*NIN:	Yes, it   (.) similar, yes.It's di , that's di , they differ.
*CLA:	Oh yeah.Not just the colour and the number of  (.) 
*NIN:	 (        )  (.) Well I'm not sure but I'm not going out to count them. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) Well it's  (        ) . (.) I would have thought. (.) Must get some rose fertiliser you know too because erm   (.) I don't suppose the original plants have been fed for generations, literally.
*NIN:	Oh you mean for those ramblers?Yeah.
*CLA:	Yeah.Well those ramblers and all over the place, mm.
*NIN:	Mm.It looks to me as if it's going to blooming rain again.
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	I'm fed up with this weather.
*CLA:	Well it's a good general purpose fertiliser   (        ) isn't it?
*NIN:	Yes. (.) What was the other one?
*CLA:	Growmore 
*NIN:	Growmore.No. (.) Erm
*CLA:	 (        ) You're the gardening expert.
*NIN:	No I think it was the rose fertiliser, they said use it for the tomatoes as well.
*CLA:	Yeah that's right, yeah.Ah!That was right erm   (.) it was the tomato fertiliser wasn't it, that was quite good for something? (.) As well, er you know as well as the rose fertiliser.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Yes, they can use rose fertiliser for tomatoes. (.) But also tomato fertiliser   [laughing] apparently is useful for   [] I don't know. (.) Look it up at the end of the book. (.) Incidentally what's this er   (.) operation that Jenny was on about?Er not Jenny, Josie   (.) was on about this morning that   (.) er Jenny had?
*NIN:	Caesarian.
*CLA:	Oh she had a caesarian did she?I was forgetting she had a caesarian.
*NIN:	Yes course she has.That's probably why it's 
*CLA:	Of course.
*NIN:	taken her to get   (.) on her feet  (        ) .
*CLA:	Of course, good god yes.I was thinking it was   (        ) knit one purl one on the stitches you know, but   (.) mm.Of course, oh yeah. (.) Oh yes. (.) Yes it was on the radio this morning about that erm   (.) it is in England somewhere I think    (.)  [laughing] a woman's given birth to a fifteen pound   [] some ounces kid.
*NIN:	Oh dear me.
*CLA:	Good gracious.Tremendous size that is isn't it?
*NIN:	Mm.Yeah.
*CLA:	Mind its weight, I don't know about the size but   (.) mm. (.) We seem to have a tremendous lot of seagulls don't we?Over that playing field there.
*NIN:	Well it's being so windy isn't it? (        ) 
*CLA:	Yeah well I, no I'm generalizing throughout the year.
*NIN:	Well we're not that far from the sea are we?
*CLA:	Of course not, that's true.Yeah. (.) Mm.Oh yes but I mean they   (.) they seem to concentrate pretty well round these playing fields for some reason. (.)  (        ) blackbird there.
*NIN:	Yeah I know. (        ) the way they land.
*CLA:	Yeah it's interesting to watch the different birds, the different methods of landing.Some are quite accurate.The others are a bit sprawling those blackbirds I think .
*NIN:	Mm the  (        ) .
*CLA:	Yeah. (.) caw caw caw    ((laugh))  (.) That looks like an old one to me doesn't it? (.) 
*NIN:	An old fella  ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Yeah.Well not an old fella necessarily. (.) 
*NIN:	I'm still sort of puzzling   (.) what the best thing, best thing to do for that hedge down there.Cos we can't er   (.) until we get   (.) it cleared all the way along it   (.) although, it seems to change.If you look
*CLA:	Hang on.What seems to change?
*NIN:	The hedge. (.) If you look from here 
*CLA:	In what way does it ch  (        ) ?
*NIN:	Well if you look from here
*CLA:	I'm looking from here.
*NIN:	And then you go along.
*CLA:	I'm going along.
*NIN:	By the time it gets to that   (.) all that rubbish that we're going to shift.
*CLA:	Er y oh yes, there in front.
*NIN:	Well then if you look it   (.) tends to change to a different variety   (        ) trees.
*CLA:	Oh it does there.See what you mean.Yes.Yeah   (        ) 
*NIN:	I don't 
*CLA:	it definitely does change doesn't it?Mm.
*NIN:	I don't know what they are, but one of those trees has little catkins on it.Very poor.
*CLA:	Yes.
*NIN:	So it obviously 
*CLA:	 [laughing] I'm not surprised   [] they're poor   (        ) .
*NIN:	I know I know.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	But erm   (.) it wants the roots   (.) clearing
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	and feeding and
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.Mhm.
*NIN:	It's a shame though to let them die because th they're   (.) I like to have a, a different   (.) I don't want it all the same.It's   (        ) boring isn't it?
*CLA:	Oh you're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia aren't you? (        ) 
*NIN:	That gives interest, especially 
*CLA:	Same 
*NIN:	into the corner.
*CLA:	Mm that's why I don't want to clip that erm bottom hedge too cleanly. (.) 
*NIN:	No but I think
*CLA:	Lop it down.Yes I agree.Lop it down but erm
*NIN:	I think we need to, for th this time round   (.) because it'll soon get, you know
*CLA:	Take its own   (        ) 
*NIN:	 (        ) .
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.Yes maybe you're right.
*NIN:	But I do think for now we're just going to have to cu chop it down.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	It's going to get worse and worse if we don't. (.) 
*CLA:	Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter, hedge cutter you know?
*NIN:	Yes.I looked in the paper to see if there was any.
*CLA:	No there weren't.
*NIN:	They're very expensive to buy aren't they?
*CLA:	Oh new they are certainly yes.
*NIN:	Yes, and you want a double action one?
*CLA:	Preferably.Not essentially.
*NIN:	I, I wouldn't think that erm   (.) like the different length of the blades.You don't want a very big one.
*CLA:	I don't think you need the, think it's a twenty four is it? (        ) no.
*NIN:	I would think they're more trouble than they're worth unless you've got
*CLA:	Yeah.They could be.
*NIN:	a great big  (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.Oh and you'd have to be that little bit more careful too.
*NIN:	Mm.Yes exactly.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	 (        ) .I think that's what   (        ) 
*CLA:	And again, unless the motor is fairly hefty  (        ) 
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out.Because it's doing more work isn't it?
*NIN:	I don't  (        ) .
*CLA:	Mm well in theory.A bigger area, bigger length.You're cutting more at the same time.
*NIN:	Yeah I was looking at the petrol driven ones. (        ) 
*CLA:	Good god.
*NIN:	I know. [laughing] That's what   [] I thought.
*CLA:	Stone the crows.Cor.
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) It took me breath away so
*CLA:	Good gracious me.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	No no.
*NIN:	Just how
*CLA:	What?
*NIN:	much   (.) erm   (.) how much can you cut with those as opposed to having   (.) needing   (.) the erm, the other ones that are used for trees.Erm
*CLA:	 [laughing] Chainsaw  [] ?
*NIN:	chainsaw.I couldn't, forget the word.The chainsaw.
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) Oh they'll take er do a fair amount of work but erm   (.) I think, certainly as far as the hedge is concerned
*NIN:	Well I know that.
*CLA:	Yeah hang on.Hang on. (.) In a well established hedge like that
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	I would think er the loppers, if the erm   (.) hedgecutter won't tackle it the loppers will
*NIN:	Yes but what I was thinking more
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	is the rest of the, round there   (.) round at the side there. (.) I mean a lot of the   (.) you know when we start getting rid of all the rubbish down that side?
*CLA:	Er I wouldn't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm that bush there.That's a little bit too heavy for it.
*NIN:	Which bush?
*CLA:	Well the one   (.) where the hedge terminates and
*NIN:	Mm   (.) well.
*CLA:	That dead looking e well dead  (        ) 
*NIN:	No.No but would it do to, I mean you're going to have a lot of the   (.) stuff that we chopped off
*CLA:	Yeah. (.) 
*NIN:	to put to, if we're getting a trailer and getting rid of it all.
*CLA:	Yeah.Yeah.
*NIN:	You're going to have to cut it down still further into smaller pieces aren't you, to get as much as you can in the trailer?
*CLA:	Oh I see what you mean, to cram on the trailer.Yes.Yes yes.
*NIN:	Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to u revert to erm   (.) a chainsaw?
*CLA:	Er   (.) combination of both I should think.I, well I'm not too concerned about that anyway.I can use the loppers.If we were doing it seven days a week, fair enough, you'd probably need a chainsaw but    (.)  (        ) anything, the loppers or the handsaw.
*NIN:	Oh handsaw?Oh that's hard work.
*CLA:	No.No no no no not the really not the thick ones  (        ) 
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	But erm
*NIN:	Well I was just thinking of taking the work out of it.
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*NIN:	Mm it's one hell of a lot of work   (        ) 
*CLA:	But you see we don't really need a chainsaw do we?
*NIN:	No I wouldn't say so normal but er there's quite a lot to   (        ) 
*CLA:	No. (.) No.No.To hire one possibly for a specific   (        ) specific job but
*NIN:	I wonder how much they are to hire?
*CLA:	Not very dear.
*NIN:	Oh aren't they?
*CLA:	What erm chainsaws?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	I think   (.) last time I looked at the hire list, price, price list
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	I think about   (.) five six quid a day something like that, they were last year.Mm.
*NIN:	Oh that's not bad really.
*CLA:	Oh it isn't bad if you've got a lot of erm chainsaw work to do.That can be done in a day you know.
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) Now whether that's erm   (.) including all the protective clothing or not I dunno.
*NIN:	I don't know.
*CLA:	There might be a different charge for that but 
*NIN:	Er did you   (.) think any more about the er   (.) rubbish clearance that was, they were advertising in the paper?I mean what d'you think?
*CLA:	Oh the   (.) twelve quid's worth wasn't it?Was it twelve?Sixteen.
*NIN:	Sixteen quid for one load.What's a load? ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	What is, well yes.Anything that'll fill a skip, it'll be a skip.
*NIN:	Skip  (        ) .
*CLA:	And I suspect that'll be the smallest skip, I don't know.
*NIN:	I would imagine so.
*CLA:	Did it say from?What did it just say?
*NIN:	No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I 
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	thought mm I wonder how much a load is. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Well yes, it's probably the smallest skip.
*NIN:	But it'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite a lot of it.
*CLA:	See I don't see erm   (.) them shifting very much for that because by the time you've   (.) got a bloke out   (.) paid his wages, paid for the   (.) the erm   (.) skip shifter, transporter you know.
*NIN:	Well if this is a skip.It might just be a trailer.
*CLA:	It might be a trailer.It might be an open back lorry, you know.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	A lorry?
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	Well we could get rid of qu  [laughing] I doubt it whether they're going to shift that  [] 
*CLA:	Well, you know mm.
*NIN:	I doubt that.
*CLA:	But again on a costing basis I mean hourly.How long is it gonna take a chap to load loads?
*NIN:	Yes but I'm thinking I mean there's so much to do here Larry, you er   (.) you know, you're not a young man any more.You can't er do too much.
*CLA:	Er I had noticed.Yes.Yes.Yes.
*NIN:	It's no good wearing yourself out if you can get anything done 
*CLA:	 [laughing] I was worn out already.What are you on about  [] ?
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) You know what I mean.
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) I'm knackered.Mm.
*NIN:	But it makes sense to me to have a little bit of help.
*CLA:	Oh I'm not adverse to having   (.) bit of help
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	you know of the right sort.No no no, no no no, no   (        ) Erm
*NIN:	You're usually pretty independent.
*CLA:	A little perhaps but er   (.) I mean you can have people that are more damn trouble than they're worth can't you?Quite honestly.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Spend your time watching
*NIN:	Well you know the, all the stuff that you've got   (.) at the side where
*CLA:	Ah well that's straight on the trailer, yeah.
*NIN:	Is it?
*CLA:	Well more, more or less, yeah.One or two things I'll be keeping but most of it   (.) it's just straight, that's why it's all piled up ready to go.
*NIN:	Ah but I wasn't just meaning on the concrete bit.I was meaning on the soil.There's loads and loads of what you trimmed off the  (        ) .
*CLA:	Oh that's not rubbish that's just erm off the trees isn't it?
*NIN:	Well it's still got to be got rid of hasn't it?
*CLA:	Chuck it over the fence and it'll go straight in, more or less straight in the trailer won't it? (.)  (        ) 
*NIN:	It'll be just like you   ((laugh)) to get your trailer and your car down there when er    [laughing]  (        ) arrive and  (        ) .
*CLA:	Oh highly probable.Sod's law, yes  (        ) .
*NIN:	I know  [] . (.) I can't get over the fact that, that all
*CLA:	What?
*NIN:	all through the winter we've had daisies all over the grass. (.) 
*CLA:	Oh yes you mean the fact that they've been in flower  (        ) ?Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	You don't usually see daisies do you  (        ) ?
*CLA:	I honestly don't know Nina.I don't know.
*NIN:	Mm don't think it's dry enough to cut the grass is it?
*CLA:	Oh I w , no I wouldn't do it today.No, crikey no.
*NIN:	No I don't think so.It doesn't look very promising.
*CLA:	No. (.) 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	It makes it hard work doesn't it? (        ) 
*CLA:	Oh yes.
*NIN:	Have to do a bit at a time.
*CLA:	I'm going to investigate, see if I can't do a conv I don't think for one minute I will but it's possible   (.) do a conversion   (.) er into erm   (.) the box type.Cos that way all the   (.) or most of the cuttings at least, go into the box wouldn't they?It's possible.
*NIN:	Oh it might be more trouble than it's worth.
*CLA:	It might be.It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small vacuum cleaner   [laughing] and cutting the erm  [] 
*NIN:	Ah don't use 
*CLA:	No?
*NIN:	No I, I prefer using it just as it is quite frankly. (        ) 
*CLA:	Well i it's not a big thing, it's only   (.) you know what I mean don't you?That yellow and green one?
*NIN:	Yes I know what you mean but I don't fancy you messing about with the   (.) grasscutter.
*CLA:	No
*NIN:	Cos I find it   (.) if there's anything else attached to it  (.) 
*CLA:	It depends which mounting.Keep the centre of gravity low   (.) and there'd be no problems.
*NIN:	No I don't, I can't agree with you there.
*CLA:	Mm.Maybe not, no.
*NIN:	No, leave well alone.
*CLA:	Mm    (.)  ((whistling)) 
*NIN:	 (        ) don't you?And then you just make a mess of what you've already got.
*CLA:	It's quite possible but erm    (.)  ((whistling)) 
*NIN:	Mm but I, I mean I can use it as it is now but anything else on to it I would find it difficult. (.) 
*CLA:	 ((whistling)) Well I'm gonna bash on with the erm
*NIN:	Right, are you ready for the window yet?
*CLA:	Well er yes please.We can do it now then.
*NIN:	Well I'll come and do that then  (        ) 
*CLA:	Okay.Right. (.) And hopefully by   (.) teatime I should have got the burning done. (.) Right, away we go.
