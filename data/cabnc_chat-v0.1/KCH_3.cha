*DAV:	Then it was Edward, then Henry  then Gordon, then James, then Percy . •218355_225285•
*JAN:	Then Percy. •226855_227415•
        Yeah. •227415_227595•

        Mum. •243145_243285•
*JAN:	Yes? •243285_243515•
*DAV:	If I had loads of room in  house I'd put them all together. •243515_247525•
        Put them behind Gordon. •247665_249215•
*JAN:	Yes but, I don't think Gordon, it's only Thomas that really has any caravan, sometimes Percy isn't it? •249365_255275•
        The, the  larger engines, the express engines don't. •255275_262325•
        Maybe James. •262435_263115•
*DAV:	I thought er •263115_263345•
*JAN:	Cos it's usually the er  the tender engines don't  pull  caravan do they? •263345_269445•
*DAV:	Yes. •269445_269695•
*JAN:	It's only the tankers isn't it? •269695_271905•
*DAV:	But mum! •271905_272355•
        Look  you can't get the express coaches. •272365_276415•
*JAN:	No. •276415_276525•
*DAV:	But mum  •276745_277125•
*JAN:	Why, why  •277125_277555•
*DAV:	Mum. •277605_277815•
*JAN:	I just think Tom's looking very battered. •277815_279885•
        The cabs are very chipped. •279885_280965•
        It's, I think you have to take a bit more care of those. •280965_283725•
        Cos you will throw them at the back of the box instead of lining them up. •283815_286495•
        D'ya remember how I got that box where you could lay them in  separately? •286495_290305•
        And of course you're not being very careful. •290375_294395•
        You're not a very careful with your toys young man are you? •294395_297225•

        A big, a big board. •306935_308055•
*JAN:	I don't think we really need that do we now? •308675_312785•
*DAV:	No. •312785_313065•
        Apparently it isn't a very big one. •313075_315225•
*JAN:	Well, well you've got  •315235_316075•
*DAV:	All over  •316145_316445•
*JAN:	the board that you set out the Lego on, you could run those on that. •316445_319385•
        That's taking up enough room  •319425_320045•
*DAV:	It is  •320045_320145•
*JAN:	we I don't think we've got any more space. •320145_322015•

*DAV:	Ooh yes! •338255_338845•
*JAN:	Well keep them all together this time. •342105_342975•
        Or that'll get trod on. •344905_345615•
*DAV:	Ooh! •345615_345745•
        There's that . •351875_352985•
        Got Thomas. •353075_353385•
*JAN:	How come you've got two Thomas? •353395_354655•
        Oh! •354985_355155•
        you bought another Thomas with Annie and Clarabel, is that  •355155_356955•
*DAV:	Yeah. •357065_357125•

*DAV:	Whoops. •386875_386975•
*JAN:	Looks good in there. •388375_389505•
        They're not in the right pair are they? •391145_394315•
        Unfortunately, the Fat Controller. •394315_394685•
*DAV:	No they do come . •395085_395925•
*JAN:	Mm. •395925_396135•
        Not actually, I think you can get different sizes can't you? •396135_409015•
        Just those and erm  small and that it's difficult to find, those are like the very small ones, they have a picture on there. •409825_420505•
        Tt. •420505_420685•
*DAV:	But mum •420685_420825•
*JAN:	But I don't think the Fat Controller's supposed to be quite as nice is he? •421175_428935•
        Are you finding they're not particularly ? •428945_430145•
*DAV:	Mine are all staying there. •430465_431215•

*DAV:	You know these two they, cos they  set don't they? •431425_433615•
*JAN:	They come together, yes. •434555_434995•
        But I think you've  got different sizes there. •435005_436575•
*DAV:	Well, mum •436575_437045•
*JAN:	And probably only bigger ones. •437105_438455•
*DAV:	they came as the same  they came in the same colour thing round them in the red letters saying what they are. •438455_445665•
*JAN:	Mm. •446045_446125•
        The same packaging. •446125_447115•
*DAV:	Yeah. •447205_447265•
        Same package, package. •447265_448345•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •448415_451345•
        Cos you can get the bigger •451345_451955•
*DAV:	Mm mm. •451995_452985•
*JAN:	got the bigger Thomas haven't you? •452985_455145•
        Got two of them the one that, that pushes one round. •455145_456595•
*DAV:	Hey mum! •456595_456995•
        You, you can get a toy the same as the Fat Controller there. •456995_460425•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •460595_461025•
*DAV:	A really big one, that big! •461025_462435•
        They're that big. •462435_462705•
*JAN:	Well I don't, I haven't seen one that size. •462705_465165•
*DAV:	That big. •465425_466085•
*JAN:	It's probably  yes. •466335_467115•
        Maybe a bit smaller. •467115_468435•
*DAV:	No. •468435_468575•
        I think it's Fat Controller bubble bath. •468585_471295•
*JAN:	Oh! •471445_471555•
        I see what you mean . •471675_472195•
*DAV:	I think  •472195_472415•
*JAN:	Yeah. •472415_472475•
*DAV:	I think it is. •472515_472905•
        Well I think it was made of a squidgy thing. •472905_475445•
*JAN:	Now, I was only thinking this morning when I was in your bathroom  you've got lots of bubble bath left over from Christmas. •475445_481635•
        You've still got some left over from the year before, but people keep giving you it. •482085_487855•
*DAV:	Mm. •487885_487975•
*JAN:	Chrissy's still got that turtle bubble bath that he doesn't want anybody to use. •487975_490845•
        And you've got the same one. •490875_495595•
        And then er  pots with the squidgy soap in. •495595_497665•
*DAV:	Oh yeah! •497905_498045•
*JAN:	And then there's another tall bottle that Wendy got you. •498045_500605•
        You've still got the lot from last year that David and Wendy got you and you've  •500605_504045•
*DAV:	You soap  •504045_504285•
*JAN:	still got this year's. •504295_504585•
        I think it's about time you used some of that. •504585_505995•
*DAV:	I, I'm the only person who used the squidgy soap. •505995_508245•
*JAN:	Didn't we have to stop using it because Chrissy was coming out in a rash? •508245_512575•
*DAV:	No . •512575_512735•

*DAV:	Well we  •598595_598915•
*JAN:	But of course it's five to four isn't it? •598925_600805•
        It's the beginning of the programmes rather than the end. •600805_603115•

        We've only missed one. •603905_604795•
*DAV:	Mum. •604795_604925•
*JAN:	I hadn't even got the tape lined up ready to  the next, the next one on. •604925_610735•

*DAV:	Well that's what Chrissy did see. •616415_619485•

        Oh, I better move out the way, I might get squashed. •641265_646735•
        If we got this Monopoly game finished we could get this cleared up couldn't we? •646735_649765•
        It's been going on a few days this game. •649765_654285•
        I think Chrissy's got a  although I'm not sure actually, you might win. •654905_658115•
        You've got two sets haven't you? •658335_659295•
        And quite a lot of money. •659365_661615•
        Have you got houses  on your set? •661765_663655•
        Yes you have. •664655_665605•
        You've got a house on . •665835_670255•
        I started off quite well. •670255_672845•
        I've got Mayfair  Piccadilly, Fleet Street and Regent Street, but I never got a set did I? •673035_677475•
*DAV:	Mum, how much, how much do you want for Fleet Street? •677475_680465•

*DAV:	Then I'll have just three sets. •680955_683535•
*JAN:	Yes. •683535_683725•
        If I land on  something where  I need some money. •683725_688005•
        Chris has got quite a lot of, he's got Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road. •688075_692795•
        Although, they don't cost much to buy though. •692875_693925•
        a few houses on them. •693925_696875•
        You can earn  some money. •696955_697975•
        So I might need, if I land on that I'll probably have to sell Fleet Street to be able to survive. •697975_703575•
        And I think once I do that I shall have lost out because Chris has got Park Lane and he's not going to part with those. •703575_716585•
        So I don't think I'm going to do very well . •716965_720095•
