@Comment:	conversation #46 (Tape 019101)
*ANN:	We've got to take that specification thing with us this morning, it will might help  •41825_242925•
*STU:	What time? •269525_285425•
*ANN:	Seven foot six by seven kitchen, plus units  so you would get two metres  it's not very much at all  •360725_700325•
*STU:	At least you'll know exactly rather than sort of saying well  •807925_131362•
*ANN:	I know it was fourteen by nine foot something, I'm up to nine, ten which is exactly which she said  •134942_161272•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	They'd rather do that than having to piece  twelve quarter then you've got to have  join the bit then all the pattern that will be matching exactly er  you'll use more. •162652_176802•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	to cover er a metre  •177912_179672•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	you have to  cos they can't do nothing with the bits, they give you all the bits  •181712_186212•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Well yeah you do, you can't end up quite a lot of it   •190022_193632•
*STU:	Mm. •194682_194742•
*ANN:	suppose they have to match the pattern otherwise it does look quite silly  which is what they've done in here, they haven't matched the patterns   that wall there is it, it ain't joined •197892_217362•
*STU:	Isn't joined. •217712_220062•
*ANN:	walk in, here, this is the end of the where they all went too and that piece is a piece cut off and it's not, it's gripped together underneath •220572_229272•
*STU:	Yes, yes •229272_230042•
*ANN:	but it just knocked the cotton sticks out, just put the piece down, there's no way I'm gonna do this, so it doesn't matter does it? •230042_237292•
*STU:	No. •238072_238132•
*ANN:	That's definitely, this is the raw bit and that's a bit of the end of the cut-off, probably have  the landing or something  can use the rest of it through  •238272_251492•
*STU:	Oh I say this is nine foot nine  just gonna get a bit for it,tie a little bit on edge and that's it. •251492_269962•
*ANN:	Bedroom has got a, it's in an alcove  so you'll have that piece where it's  bottom of the stairs or wherever, I mean, the, stand on  slip mats  you're gonna get that because of the, the airing cupboard is part of the hall, part of the bedroom and  nothing you can do about that one, and on the wall it's just gonna be one length of each room,cut off,perfect,, actually they don't normally do that, they usually just  the measurement, cos I not, never understood why they don't have  measurements there all standard , you guarantee use the one strip of another roll  •269962_336332•
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	The new houses are pretty standard why don't they convert them, you know , you guarantee if you use six rolls of wallpaper  you'll need one to  seven, something silly like that  •336422_353792•
*STU:	Way it always goes, an extra roll  need to buy •354002_358762•
*ANN:	Need to buy, you have done. •358762_360262•
*STU:	That's a  •360302_361042•
*ANN:	To do underneath the window or on top of the door or some silly thing like that  •361472_365602•
