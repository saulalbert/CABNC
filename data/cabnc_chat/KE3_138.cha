*JAC:	just because it's up there or not cos it's the only leg that is shaking  the others aren't . •261150_261599•
*MUM:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Mm  it's probably shaking cos it's up there my leg does that sometimes. •261638_261957•
*MUM:	Perhaps he don't realize he can put it down. •261957_262163•
*JAC:	Yeah. •262176_262202•

*JAC:	But I should imagine they were lying  and stay there  •263355_263551•
*MUM:	Well they were  in front of the fire  •263576_263737•
*TON:	something growing out  the back  •263737_263832•
