        She'll say a few daft things like  she always says, how's my mother? •_•
*ANN:	Oh! •_•
        But •_•
*BET:	And what does she think  •_•
*ANN:	Oh! •_•

*ANN:	Well how old is she, eighty •_•
*BET:	She's eighty two. •_•
*ANN:	eighty two. •_•
*BET:	That's what I said to her when she said it the other day I said  how old are you Mrs ? •_•
        She said  eighty two. •_•
        I says, right. •_•
        How old would your mother be? •_•
        And I could see the  wheels turning  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*BET:	round, see. •_•
*ANN:	 ((cough)) 
*BET:	Then Jimmy said  well you know she's been dead for  many years  and er  she says, oh that's right. •_•
        And she just sort of brushed it off. •_•
        And she'll say to Jimmy  erm  I don't know how you're managing to look after yourself. •_•
        Who's getting your  meals ? •_•
        Well, of course Jimmy's got his own meals for  the whole of his life more  •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*BET:	or less. •_•
*ANN:	In fact, one of the nurses had said to Jim last night  your mum said  er  don't tell my brother  and then, then she said, your brother? •_•
        Who, who is your brother? •_•
        She said, I don't, I mean, don't tell my son. •_•
        So well Jim said, well what is it? •_•
        She said I can't  tell you, I haven't to tell you ! •_•
        So he didn't know what she'd been up to. •_•
*BET:	Oh dear ! •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah. •_•
*BET:	Well the thing is, she's got nobody to talk to there you see, she's in this little four bedder •_•
*ANN:	Aha. •_•
*BET:	all the and like all closed off  •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*BET:	and the lady  opposite •_•
*ANN:	I've never been in in er  one or  two. •_•
*BET:	Two. •_•
*ANN:	Two. •_•

*BET:	The lady opposite, erm  has had a stroke but she's not  exactly  and she's deaf •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah. •_•
*BET:	so she can't hear her. •_•
        Mrs  can't get up to go over to her. •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*BET:	Now the lady in the bed diagonally, she, has to be hoisted everywhere. •_•
*ANN:	Oh! •_•
*BET:	I think she must have had a really bad stroke. •_•
        Now she talks across to her, but she has a bit of a  ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, and it's difficult  •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BET:	to understand. •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*BET:	And the lady on the other bed  beside her, is erm  she's very deaf. •_•
        So, the result is that, that she just  sits there or lies there •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*BET:	she can't, she can't stand or anything. •_•
*ANN:	Who's Mr  got in with him? •_•

        I says it's sad. •_•
        I said you couldn't manage  on your own . •_•
        No, that's why he was frightened when they did the alterations. •_•
        Er, and they wanted him to move  out completely away somewhere, he was frightened he didn't get back in after. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*BET:	And, I think he just moved in to  Muriel's next door. •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
        Yeah, that's right. •_•

*BET:	So  but  erm  Jimmy hasn't sort of put it to her yet. •_•
*ANN:	Is Doug  going into the police  or applying? •_•
*BET:	Well he told me last year he'd applied. •_•
*ANN:	I know. •_•
        He told me he applied but I thought he told me he'd been turned down. •_•
*BET:	Well I never heard the  well he had applied once before  and  he  he got as far an interview and then he  didn't get any further. •_•
        But then he applied just last summer for the Metropolitan. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        Cos er erm  •_•
*BET:	I haven't heard the outcome of that. •_•
*ANN:	Marie  Marie was going down to her mother's  she was running as usual, she dashed up to our back door and said, is Doug around? •_•
        And I said, I don't know what shift he's on, is his car out? •_•
        And it wasn't. •_•
*BET:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	And I said do you want a piece of paper to write him a message or something? •_•
        And she said, no it was just that  he's talking of renting his house  erm  and I know of someone who wants to rent one. •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
*ANN:	So I said well where's Doug going? •_•
        Then she said something about  June  and the Met. •_•
*BET:	Oh well Doug wasn't here again, he never mentioned it. •_•
*ANN:	Or did she say he's going for an interview in  June for the Met, or something, anyway. •_•
*BET:	Well he's not  •_•
*ANN:	Cos I, I haven't seen him at all. •_•
*BET:	I walked up  from the woods with him, came  •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*BET:	together, he never mentioned it. •_•
*ANN:	In fact, I thought it must be all finished with because  he, he was quite talkative about it during the summer •_•
*BET:	Yes. •_•
        well I remember well I was, I was sure •_•
*ANN:	then I, and he said to me about  •_•
*BET:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	being turned down. •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
        Cos he hoped, if he got into the Met  and then he transfer  up here. •_•
*ANN:	Oh! •_•
*BET:	You see, like  it's like  's grandson. •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*BET:	I mean he started off in the Met  er  did his training and everything  and then I think he's up here somewhere now. •_•
*ANN:	I tell you someone  erm  our boiler went wrong on  ah, I think it was Wednesday •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
*ANN:	Thursday, I just can't remember, and Raymond came through •_•
*BET:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	it must have been Thursday because I didn't want him to come, I said to Jim, tell him not to come we'll just turn the whole lot off. •_•
        But the kitchen was reeking  of  •_•
*BET:	mm. •_•
*ANN:	fumes! •_•
        And, and  •_•
*BET:	Oh dear! •_•
*ANN:	er, I could feel it prickling the back of my nose and my throat •_•
*BET:	Yes. •_•
*ANN:	and  and my eyes started to water •_•
*BET:	Mhm. •_•
*ANN:	I opened the windows. •_•
        Oh! •_•
        And there was  when it came on, in the afternoon there was this tremendous  very loud roar! •_•
        Now, it sometimes goes  whoosh! •_•
*BET:	Yes. •_•
        When they  •_•
*ANN:	It comes on initially •_•
*BET:	Yes. •_•
        And dies down. •_•
*ANN:	and it immediately dies down and then it's okay, but there was this tremendous roar  and a loud click and it went out. •_•
        And it was only about  it was within a couple of minutes, or, probably less  Jim came in  er  I think he was, I don't know where he'd been cos his day off was Thursday I think. •_•
        Yes he was. •_•
        And  I told him about it, and he said oh yes, the pilot light has gone out  and he relit it. •_•
        And it was fine. •_•
        It sounded okay  but we kept getting these fumes. •_•
        So we kept opening the door  it blew out once again and he put it on again  and we were still getting these fumes till about  oh  about half past five it seemed to stop,we had the windows open. •_•
*BET:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	And then  Raymond phoned at about quarter to seven. •_•
        No. •_•
        He didn't. •_•
        Sorry! •_•
        Sorry! •_•
        It he phoned at  it was, it was five to six, Jim was going to take me to aerobics because of the weather •_•
*BET:	Mm mm. •_•
*ANN:	I had my wellies in case the leisure centre was flooded! •_•
*BET:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Ha. •_•
        There was only ten of us there. •_•
        Anyway, erm  Raymond was on the phone because he was and I was saying to Jim  tell him I don't want him to come if the if the road's cut off to Blythe I don't want him to get stuck, I mean, he's got a wife  •_•
*BET:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	and two small children at home. •_•
        And I'm saying, it's time I was out, I'm gonna be  late . •_•
        Anyway, he insisted he was coming at half past seven. •_•
        And he came at half past seven and he cleaned it and he looked at it, and he said er  it wasn't  anything that he could see, he thinks it was just down draught, but we've had winds before. •_•
        And he said that  the cowl  we've got on that chimney •_•
*BET:	Yes. •_•
*ANN:	off the kitchen and and runs the boiler, he said it's the best kind you can get, nothing should come in there. •_•
        And as he's driven up at the back then he looked up and he said  you you could see daylight through it so it was, wasn't blocked by anything. •_•
*BET:	Wasn't blocked. •_•
*ANN:	Erm  but he said  •_•
*BET:	D'ya think it was the rain, maybe? •_•
*ANN:	I don't know. •_•
*BET:	Driving wind? •_•
*ANN:	I said could it have been continuous rain? •_•
        And he said something about  he'd once  they'd once had to work  all one day and all one night near the Regent  Centre  because  er, something had gone wrong with the  gas pipes because erm of flooding. •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
        Right. •_•
*ANN:	So whether we've  but nobody else seems to have noticed anything like this. •_•
*BET:	No, I, I haven't had anything like that. •_•
*ANN:	Anyway, he couldn't find anything. •_•
        He said, we'll just have to  leave it  and, if it happens again we'll have to go into it further, but it hasn't happened again, so now it's okay. •_•
*BET:	Mm mm. •_•
*ANN:	Except last night  I thought  what on earth's this? •_•
        It just smelt like Christmas cake cooking, and I wasn't cooking anything at all. •_•
        I mean  Jim went to work at one o'clock and the last of the kids  went home, I've had my dinner •_•
*BET:	Perhaps something's melting then. •_•
*ANN:	at midday. •_•
        But it was no, it was no stronger in the kitchen than the living room. •_•
*BET:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	I sniffed around the boiler, I sniffed around the cooker  •_•
*BET:	 ((laugh))  (        ) 
*ANN:	ah, but  when the kids went home I just had  I had a sandwich. •_•
*BET:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	That's all I had, I hadn't cooked anything. •_•
*BET:	Mhm. •_•
*ANN:	Erm  the triplets had  soup  and stottie and I warmed that up in the microwave. •_•
*BET:	Mm mm. •_•
*ANN:	And this smell lasted for about half an hour and then, then I couldn't smell it again. •_•
*BET:	And it disappeared? •_•
        It's, what kind of boiler is that you have? •_•
*ANN:	Er  ooh! •_•
        I can't remember the make. •_•
        It's one of these that uses less fuel. •_•
        More efficient. •_•
        Well we've had it, how long have we had it? •_•
        About  three, four years. •_•
        Anyway, how are the  •_•
*BET:	Well you've had a bother with it though haven't you? •_•
*ANN:	We've have had, •_•
*BET:	Well about two or three  •_•

*BET:	Mhm. •_•
*ANN:	Have been too close to it  and it had, and the vents at the back had got churned up with dust at one time, I keep dusting it now. •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
*ANN:	Anyway, while I Raymond was here, he says, oh Alan's back. •_•
        And they said, well where from? •_•

*ANN:	Richard threw himself on the floor screaming! •_•
*BET:	Ee! •_•

*BET:	Oh dear! •_•
*ANN:	And I was and he,of course he's, he's heavy •_•
*BET:	Yes. •_•
*ANN:	and when he just makes himself flop, he wouldn't stand up. •_•
        When I tried to sit him up  •_•
*BET:	Pick him up. •_•
*ANN:	to put his coat on, I picked him up and tried to carry him, and he just flung himself around so hard I had to put him down and he immediately flung himself on the floor again! •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
        Lovely  exhibition . •_•
*ANN:	Oh! •_•
        Golly! •_•

*BET:	And was it because he didn't want to leave? •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*BET:	 ((laugh))

*ANN:	because there were different children coming in the afternoon. •_•
*BET:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	But no, no. •_•
*BET:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	So I picked him up and I carried him, Dorothy had gone out the wrong door, instead of going out the door at that end  she'd gone right along this long corridor •_•
*BET:	And come out the main door. •_•
*ANN:	so I followed her and of course, we're going past all the blooming classrooms! •_•
        And the  •_•
*BET:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	classrooms all had their doors open. •_•
*BET:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And  anyway I carried him half way along and I had to put him down •_•
*BET:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	I managed to get his coat on  and a woman came along, I, I don't know if she was a dinner lady or what, she had a  a sort of overall on  and er  I said come on let's catch up with your mummy, and she said, ah! •_•

        Aha. •_•
*ANN:	And I said yes. •_•
        And she said, oh Mr  teaches  my son at school. •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
*ANN:	She said, come along hold my hand as well and er, I'll tell my son that, that er Mr  's son  took me to the door. •_•
        So he shut up  •_•
*BET:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	and listened to her. •_•
*BET:	Oh! •_•
*ANN:	He'd calmed down  •_•
*BET:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	by then. •_•
*BET:	Well I had trouble  •_•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*BET:	with Joshua on erm  what day will it be? •_•
        Erm  it must have been the last day, it must have been Friday, must have been Friday. •_•
        Cos usually, he's keen to go to Ron and Stephanie's. •_•
*ANN:	Mhm. •_•
*BET:	He wouldn't get in his pushchair. •_•
        He wouldn't put his coat on. •_•
        Erm  I finally got his coat on, and then, I said, come on we'll walk. •_•
        No. •_•
        No. •_•
        And chuck his hat down on the kitchen floor. •_•
        I said, well I'd have to go and leave you then. •_•
        So, of course, he got up, I went to close the door  he was there  so  I tried him in his pushchair, I says well you'll have to walk, I know it's only five minutes away. •_•
        So •_•
*ANN:	Mhm. •_•
*BET:	it was a bad day. •_•
        So er  he wouldn't move! •_•
        Got so far on, he stood and he started crying and yelling and, don't want to go! •_•
        Want to go home! •_•
        Don't want to go! •_•
        Now I used to get him along there  and  then he was sort of in tears but there was  kids in the hall, the little hall  and then when you sort come in the door, not the main door, the one, the  •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*BET:	door you're supposed to come in. •_•
*ANN:	The one we should have gone in  •_•
*BET:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	and come out of? •_•
*BET:	Well, immediately on the left there's a door  and the hall goes along by the path that you, you come up to that door. •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*BET:	And, the children were in there erm doing their P E and er  he went stood at the door and watched them and he was  quite happy. •_•
        And, they all filed out  and the  the caretaker, I presume, started putting the tables up, and the chairs for lunch •_•
*ANN:	Mhm. •_•
*BET:	and er  he wouldn't keep out, so, so in the end the caretaker got him a little chair •_•
*ANN:	Mhm. •_•
*BET:	and  sat him against the wall. •_•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*BET:	He said that's your chair, now  you can watch me. •_•
        Well he sat there as good as gold. •_•
        The only trouble was when Stephanie come out he didn't  want to come home . •_•
*ANN:	 ((laugh))
