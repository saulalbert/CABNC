@Comment:	conversation #11 (Tape 029004)
*ENA:	Within the next, er month or so   (.) a national consultation is being held within the URC   (.) to consider the advice of   (        ) producing   (.) a programme of training for eldership which will be used throughout the call of the church   (.) and if there are any suggestions or any proposal that anyone would like to make   (.) I shall be very glad to receive them within the next month.Thank you.
*UNK:	Any other questions or comments? (.) And you  (        ) .
*UNK:	Yes, but I'll try to be brief.
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	As I understand things, and I work from what I know   (.) to what I don't know   (.) anyone ordained an elder following these guidelines is recognised as an elder within the United Reform Church and within the Presbyterian Church of Wales. (.) As a result of that, and I think   (.) to make sure this is something we would have to ask the   (        ) advisory committee   (.) but I would read it   (.) that that includes mutual recognition of eldership. (.) And so in my   ((tape change)) ((side two of two hundred and eighty nine))
*UNK:	That it would yes. (.) But I'd want to consult the giant advisory committee   (.) before putting that into print.
*UNK:	Yo , that's an important question that comes as a   (.) we can attempt   (.) or   (.) the group can attempt to answer that question   (.) the in reports of the next    (        )  (.) so we don't lose it off the agenda.
*UNK:	Yes.
*UNK:	Would that be fair?
*UNK:	Yes.
*UNK:	I'll just put that aside. (.) All in those in favour of the resolution that we   (.) commend to these   (.) to the church   (        ) 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	we agree the procedure for the election of ordination and induction of elders   (.) in   (        ) and in churches. (.) Please show? (.) Any against?
*UNK:	Actually I've rather hurried through   (.) that objective part of our   (        ) I only had my   (.) time   (.) to bring before you   (.) one other very important issue   (.) and two other pieces of information. (.) There are a few copies remaining of   (        ) newsletter. (.) There's also information about the International Ecumenical Fellowship   (.) which is something that you as an individual can do   (.) to support ecumenical work.If you want to know more about it, pick up a leaflet. (.) If, we have run out of leaflets   (.) pick up John !
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Because he is a member   (.) and he can tell you about it. (.) The most   (.) important thing   (.) in this report   (.) is from the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland   (.) and it's a resolution   (.) that they passed   (.) on Northern Ireland. (.) You should have this   (.) received this in the pew   (.) when you came in   (.) this morning. (.) The reason it is important today   (.) is because tomorrow   (.) has been   (.) requested to be appointed to be   (.) a special day in prayer   (.) for peace   (.) justice   (.) in Northern Ireland. (.) Like this resolution   (.) I would urge   (.) all of you   (.) when you go back   (.) to your congregation   (.) those ministers who   (.) are following the moderator's request, those ministers from the South who will not be   (.) conducting morning worship tomorrow because of the long journey   (.) request whoever is conducting worship to use this   (.) in the service   (.) in the prayers! (.) Those of you who are here without ministers   (.) badger your minister! (.) When you get back tonight   (.) or tomorrow   (.) to include this   (.) in your time and prayer   (.) in one of your services tomorrow. (.) And don't   (.) let it stop there! (.) A day of prayer is important   (.) as it changes our pattern of prayer   (.) and as it changes   (.) our concerns week by week and year by year. (.) Some of the   (.) attempts at peacemaking   (.) the churches in Ireland are making   (.) may seem worrying   (.) may seem politically subversive   (.) but how will we respond   (.) to the longing for peace   (.) to the desire   (.) for reconciliation   (.) for the hope   (.) the stakes    (        )  (.) that will result   (.) in a permanent and just solution?I commend to you all   (.) this   (        ) 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	of prayer. (.) And will move   (.) that   (.) this document be taken back   (.) to your local churches and used. (.) We  (        ) .
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	We move to   (.) page five, the top half of page five and    (.)  (        ) and Graham will introduce the   (.) world famous issue.
*ENA:	Having cre , credit by David  's withering look   (.) I always say you have to be terrified!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	It's a bit 
*UNK:	I'm a spy!
*ENA:	Oh, after all that it didn't work! (.) It's at this point in our agenda when er   (.) the world search   (.) it's   (.) our agenda   (.) and er   (.) in introducing the report there are just four things I want to comment about. (.) Er, I refer, first of all to   (.) the continuing links we have with the church in Hungary   (.) and to remind that there is a, a party of young who are currently negotiating the   (.) er, visit to Hungary at this present time. (.) And er, we would hope that that programme of reciprocal visits will continue over the ensuing years. (.) We also find there are, and I hope that you will read it carefully, because I think you will find it   (.) a fairly daunting report   (.) which comes from Hugh    (.) who has managed, you know, has been working, erm, in   (.) er, Romania   (.) with the Bishop   (.) erm, who more or less, kind of, started off the, or whose work started off the   (.) the revolution that took place in Romania. (.) Within that report he tells us   (.) erm, the rather startling disturbance story, that in fact   (.) it almost suggests, has been suggested the revolution hasn't happened because the situation   (.) has continued as before with a different name   (.) but basically with the same   (.) er   (.) with the same kind of programme intact. (.) And in the creation of unity, unity   (        ) there's deep concern about the status of American churches in Romania   (.) and obviously the Hungarian church   (.) in Romania is affected by that whole process so I would urge you to read that letter   (.) to remember the work of Hugh erm   (.) and to   (.) be aware of, of what   (.) the situation is   (.) in that part of the world.It seems important that I should have links, in developing links   (.) you ought to see that as part of our agenda. (.) Hugh, himself   (.) I think he is completing his work   (.) and there, in, in a few months time   (.) and I know there have attempts made to find someone to replace him.As yet er, that has not been possible, but if you knew of anybody, young person who you thought might be suitable   (.) and might   (.) mi , might like the challenge of an interesting venture of this nature   (.) I'm sure if you let us know, or let the moderator know   (.) we'll be very happy to, er, suggest that name or see if there's any, any possibility   (.) erm, in continuing that  (        ) . (.) We also feel it's important that we should   (.) be doing just a bit more than just having exchanges, that there is a whole process of   (        ) that needs to go on.There's an assumption   (.) by some politicians that just because there is this   (.) immense change taking place in Eastern Europe, that this is victory for Western capitalism   (.) erm, I think there might be some of who might be a bit cautious about that victory and might believe that er   (.) there is still much that needs to be shared and understood   (.) and it isn't as simple as perhaps some political figures might suggest it could be. (.) So I want to, first of all, in presenting this report to remind you of the importance of that link   (.) and for us to encourage its development. (.) Secondly, the World Church erm   (.) is your agenda in the sense that   (.) you might be interested to know there is a   (.) erm   (.) a video now available, er   (.) which introduces the work of CWM for the churches. (.) And that video can be obtained from Tavistock Church, in Tavistock Place   (.) it costs twelve pound fifty, with one pound fifty postage   (.) erm, but I think that it has been recommended to us and a number of the provinces have asked for copies to be made available   (.) and then maybe there are some churches within our provence that might like to have that video so that they can draw the attention of their churches to the work   (.) of the Council for World Mission. (.) Thirdly, we will in a moment be hearing a report   (.) erm, about the   (.) World Council of Churches   (.) assembly which took place in Canberra   (.) so there is another aspect to the World Church hitting our agenda today. (.) But fourth, and I think it was reflected very much in the discussions this morning   (.) just to simply remind you that you are the World Church!You know, we sometimes think of the World Church as being something that's out there beyond us, but we are the World Church aren't we?We're   (.) we are part of the that process and it's   (.) it's sometimes encouraging for us to remember that there are   (.) small denominations, small groups like us around the world   (.) who are struggling to make their Christian witness real   (.) in their particular context. (.) And it's important that the kind of story that we're being told this morning, or to continue to be told, we are to continually hear and observing 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	stories   (.) because they are encouraging   (.) it does make us feel that even though we are a small denomination that does not stop us from preventing new ideas which we can share and in which we can learn from each other.So, I would hope that out of this experience of this morning you will continue to er let some of those stories come forward   (.) and, and let us hear them and let us share in them. (.) And, with those comments moderator, I'd like to present the er report of the World Church, Church and Mission.
*UNK:	Are there any questions, either on the report or in what  (        ) ?
*UNK:	Then it gives me great pleasure now to erm   (.) I always knew that John al , has had something different from the rest of us you know   (.) he has that kind of air doesn't he, that   (.) that status in the pulpit which   (.) you know, (        ) ?
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	And of course, I've now discovered what it is, he's a distant relative of the   (.) Archbishop of Wales.
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	There was always er   (.) there was always something there! (.) There was just something about his daring  (        ) .
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) that's alright then. (.) I'm not gonna do that John. (.) Erm, I'm   (.) I'm never sure about Bishops and Archbishops, erm   (.) I remember Archbishop Runcie once commenting about   (.) er, an activity that took place at the installation of a Bishop and it's, I gather, I mean I've, I haven't actually been to one, but if you're Bishop or an Archbishop   (        ) when they act to   (.) the triumph and act of installation took place there were   (.) you'll find that the person was surrounded by Bishops and they were all sort of looking in on this er, this body that was gonna be installed and somebody once asked what are they doing? (.) Ar , Archbishop Run , Runcie said well it's just simply an operation to remove their backbone!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Erm   (.) I don't know! (.) I would like to er   (.) say that we are very   (.) grateful today to be   (.) able to welcome amongst us his grace   (.) erm, the most reverent Alwyn  who has just recently been elected as the Archbishop of Wales. (.) We're delighted that you have found time out of your busy schedule and timetable   (.) to come and spend time with us today and we're very glad   (.) that you are able to do so and I would ask   (.) er, John, our moderator if he will receive me now   (.) and invite you to address our  (        ) .
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*IDA:	Well, first of all may I   (.) respond positively to   (.) those kind words of welcome that you extended to me.
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	At least, I feel at home.
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	I won't say any more! (.) Some of you may have listened very attentively to the, to a programme that put o , was put out a week ago I think, with Betty    (.) er, in Welsh   (.) and er   (.) some of you therefore, will know something my background. (.) Er   (.) last year   (.) and time has flown hasn't it? (.) Last February, twelve months last February I'm, I was privileged   (.) to   (.) travel to Canberra   (.) in Australia   (.) fortunately not on my own, because there are wi , witnesses. (.) Er
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	There were seven of us from Wales   (.) er   (.) and two of them are present here this afternoon. (.) Noel was present and    (.)  (        ) presenting the Welsh independence in    (        )  (.) and also   (.) Gethyn was present   (.) erm   (.) I'd like to see, er, know that Gethyn was representing the Church in Wales   (.) apart from the fact that he's also a baptist. (.) Er, as you know, Gethyn does work   (.) for the Church in Wales now   (.) and this, in a special way, is a   (.) testifies   (.) to   (.) the fact that he is   (.) er   (.) an ecumenical person. (.) Working ecumenically   (.) in Wales.He is also   (.) a secretary of Envis that is the commission of covenant to churches   (.) of which we are all members of churches. (.) Yes, I er   (.) I went in February nineteen ninety two   (.) and certainly this was a great privilege   (.) to be there for, was it, three weeks?Three weeks I think   (.) er   (.) spending time with members of other churches   (.) and also members of others cultures from all over the world. (.) The er   (.) I've got to keep an eye on my watch, this is what I'm going by!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	It's a    (        )  (.) more than anything else.I know that you are behind schedule   (.) and I don't want to incur the wrath of your moderator!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	During the, the fortnight in which we met in Canberra   (.) eight hundred and twenty six of us were official delegates   (.) er, to the World Council of Churches.Delegates from the member churches. (.) And, in a sense   (.) the World Council of Churches at this point can be regarded as the supreme legislative body   (.) of the World Church. (.) And you're quite right   (.) er   (.) we must regard the World Church as meaning ourselves. (.) We tend to refer to the World Church as something outside our particular constituency   (.) and we mustn't forget that we must own the World Church.And this is something that came home to me very much in Canberra. (.) We   (.) we are   (        ) from Wales   (.) and I would like to say   (.) that all the Welsh representatives were at one.That we could own what was going on in Canberra.This was not entirely true   (.) of other   (.) people from other churches   (.) in the United Kingdom unfortunately! (.) The World Council of Churches assembly takes pla , place roughly every seven years. (.) And though the World Council Churches was formed   (.) before the second world war   (.) yet, the first assembly was not held until nineteen forty eight at Amsterdam! (.) Second assembly was held in nineteen fifty four at Edmunston in the United States. (.) And then it was fir , er, the turn of the third world   (.) the third assembly   (.) was held in New Delhi in nineteen sixty one. (.) And then, the fourth assembly er, was held in Loopsala  (.) Sw  (.) in Sweden   (.) and the fifth assembly was   (.) er, held in Nairobi. (.) And then   (.) er, the sixth assembly in Vancouver in nineteen eight three   (.) and the seventh assembly   (.) in Canberra, last year. (.) Now, you'll see that   (.) it has a tendency to go   (.) all over the world   (.) wherever it is invited   (.) but whoever invites the World Council of Churches now   (.) must, in fact, be able to cope with a great number of people!Not only delegates   (.) but also people who attend as a service from other churches outside the membership of the World Council   (.) and also   (.) to cope with the press. (.) Unfortunately, in this country we were badly served by the press! (.) And it had, it'd be true to say that whatever you read in your newspapers   (.) er, while we were in Canberra, I would advise you   (.) not to believe half of it! (.) Or a quarter of this! (.) Because what came back to us was very much tittle tattle gossip   (.) that people picked up in   (.) er, Canberra! (.) And, it is true to say that that did not represent the   (.) what really went on in Canberra!Because, above all, it was an experience   (.) experience of meeting people from different churches   (.) wi  (.) experience of meeting people of different cultures   (.) experience, too, of listening attentively and worshipping with people of different church traditions of your own. (.) And that was   (.) something to   (.) er   (.) an experience to cherish! (.) The World Council Churches on this occasion reviewed the work accomplished during the seven and a half years since the last assembly   (.) in Vancouver in Canada. (.) It rec , received a report therefore, from the Central Council of the World Counc , Council of Churches   (.) which meets   (.) I think, once a year   (.) Noel can correct me on this   (.) once a year, or a at least once every two years. (.) And then we have a member from Wales on the Central Council of the World Council of Churches, Miss Carole  who   (.) er, although she is from Wales, member of the church of Wales   (.) she now lives in Belfast. (.) But er, we were not successful in putting up an   (.) er and er to have a member of Wales elected on this occasion to serve for the next seven years   (.) unfortunately! (.) And er   (.) i , it, this caused a great deal of hurt, if I may say so? (.) And then the er   (.) Council also   (.) set guidelines for it's programme in the years ahead. (.) It also chose presidents, it also chose, a   (.) hundred and fifty members to serve   (.) on the central committee, or the executive committee   (.) of the World's Council of Churches. (.) It also made statements on pressing issues   (.) in the church and the world. (.) And these, above all else included the Gulf war because   (.) this   (.) war was on while we were in Canberra. (.) And this really owed a great deal of tension! (.) We er, the we, we have also to make statements on the   (.) indigenous people and land rights   (.) because we were confronted with the position of Aborigine people   (.) in   (.) er, Australia. (.) And we were concerned about their land rights   (.) or in other words, their human rights 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*IDA:	their natural human rights.I'll speak about that in a moment or two. (.) We were concerned too   (.) about internal conflicts   (.) in certain countries   (.) and especially in South Africa. (.) But all these statements revealed the desire of the assembly to pray more ardently for the spirit of unity to reconcile   (.) people. (.) Indeed, this was a very rare opportunity for all delegates and visitors, as I said, to meet   (.) to listen   (.) yes, and to hear it first hand about the life and witness of more than three hundred member churches throughout the world   (.) in a hundred countries! (.) It was certainly and opportunity for the churches together to look at the world situation in conversation together and thus, to deepen the faith which have to proclaim   (.) at arriving at a common understanding of the situation. (.) It isn't the   (.) you are not expected, at least, I was not expected to   (.) to see the Council producing masses of pages for our reading afterwards   (.) and this report, by the way, is worth reading. (.) Sounds of the spirit. (.) If you had read this   (.) I shouldn't be here this afternoon!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	But are we going to inflict that on you?But, can I say this   (.) that what mattered most to me was the fact that I have been in conversation with so many people   (.) and to be able to allow that conversation to affect my faith   (.) and a faith that I have to   (.) proclaim day by day and Sunday by Sunday   (.) from the pulpits of my church. (.) As previous   (.) as in previous assemblies   (.) worship wasn't central to our activity. (.) Besides, morning worship there were midday sermons and in sessions   (.) together with evening worship. (.) What I missed most at this occa , on this occasion was the opportunity for bible study, but I think   (.) getting pe  (.) er, a visitor of another kind there was able to visit some of the bible studies each morning. (.) The daily pattern of study and discussion work was divided into two parts   (.) in the morning, participants met in small groups   (.) in the afternoon, all members   (.) met in   (        ) session    (.)  (        ) sessions   (        ) reports from central committee   (.) and also er, reports on developments in the World Church. (.) The main theme of the assembly, therefore, was   (.) the prayer   (.) come holy spirit renew the whole creation. (.)  ((repeating in welsh)). (.) Appertaining to a   (        ) to infuse   (.) through dramatic presentic presentations   (.) the main theme   (.) by the or  (.) aboriginal of Australians telling about their life   (.) and struggle. (.) Other Ecumenical topics presented were the life and history of ecumenical movement   (.) you retain and justice and peace   (.) ecumenical sharing. (.) and indeed, the recent programme justice, peace and integrature of creation featured very prominently in our discussions.And no doubt, it will continue as a very important theme for the future. (.) Some themes of the assembly therefore were   (.) giver of life   (.) sustain your creation   (.) spirit of truth   (.) set us free   (.) spirit of unity reconcile your people   (.) Holy Spirit transform   (.) and sanctify us. (.) What about the background, therefore   (.) to the assembly's discussion?But first of all   (.) the global situation in the Gulf.This marred the peace situation! (.) Plane flights had to be diverted   (.) so, by the time we got to Canberra we were very conscious of the destructive element   (.) of the Gulf   (.) in our prayers and in our discussions.Secondly, we were made aware of the effects of what can be described as liberation thinking and liberation theology   (.) not only in South America   (.) but only, also, in the Pacific regions   (.) Asia, Japan and Korea. (.) Then   (.) there was the influence of the third world, or the two thirds world   (.) the churches   (.) the politics   (.) and the cultures. (.) And then fourthly, more and more the orthodox churches placed, played a very significant part in guiding the port of    (        )  (.) as far as   (.) as the assembly was concerned.Significantly to, there was the abstinence of Roman Catholic church influence   (.) and dominance.Some of us, some of us tried to make a plea   (.) and I hope we will try, still try to make a plea   (.) that there should be a significant Roman Catholic   (.) er, element within the membership of the World Council of Churches   (.) in the future. (.) So we were presented, as it were, with a partial membership of the World Church. (.) As far as I'm concerned two things set the assembly   (.) in context   (.) firstly, the sense of space. (.) For many Australians the desert which covers much of their country means   (.) a vast emptiness   (.) solitude   (.) and the struggle to survive in hostile surroundings. (.) But, for the original inhabitants of the lands the desert is the familiar place that provides nature   (.) and gives meaning to life. (.) It was natural, therefore, that the assembly should take up this kind of understanding.It was not too late to realise that space should be given in the programme for a proper consideration of the perception of winning in relation to the whole team of the assembly. (.) Winning space therefore   (.) assumed a significant part of the assembly programme. (.) Again, as I said, the Gulf war brought the peace question very much into the arena   (.) and accordingly there was always the pressure for prece , reconsideration of the peace   (.) under the general heading of peace space. (.) And, can I suggest that we need to bring that very much into our discussions and into our prayers constantly in our churches. (.) Significant that we have been challenged by our master to be peace   (.) makers   (.) how real is that in our churches? (.) And   (.) tomorrow will be the real test, won't it not? (.) That we are really praying for peace and identifying ourselves with peace struggle in Ireland. (.) Secondly, there was also the context of the Aborigines.We were reminded of their plight at the opening service of the assembly.One thing I forgot to bring with me this afternoon was a tape of the assembly worship   (.) I'm sorry about that, but I don't think you've got a tape recorder have you?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*IDA:	That upsets me!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	We were reminded of their plight   (.) of peace, as I said, at the opening service. (.) Outside the   (        ) marched in   (.) the aborigines had their fire of gum tree branches   (.) to purify the atmosphere   (.) very much like the flames of fire which appeared on the first whit Sunday. (.) The twenty sixth of January seventeen eighty eight   (.) the British established a small prison community at Sydney Cove on the east coast of Australia    (.)  (        ) villain read the declaration   (.) and hoisted the Union Jack claiming the east coast of the entire Australian continent   (.) for the British crown. (.) And that meant   (.) quite a   (        ) effect as far as the aborigines were concerned   (.) they had lost their territory! (.) The aborigines were not consulted or compensated! (.) European occupation of land gradually extended through most of the continent. (.) In more remote areas   (.) reserves were set aside for the igi indigenous hab , inhabitants. (.) They were   (.) sa , put aside, they did not count! (.) But by the end of the nineteenth century there were six British colonies in Australia! (.) On the first of January nineteen hundred and one   (.) they formed a federation   (.) and most adult aborigines were   (        ) 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*IDA:	vote   (.) in the process   (.) for deciding on the federation. (.) The culture of the minorities of indigenous people that   (.) was given providence at the assembly. (.) And this was expressed in a very imaginative presentation by Professor    (.) a young    (        )  (.) in her keynote lecture when she called   (.) for three significant changes. (.) The first was that for our generation   (.) we must learn how to live with the earth   (.) promoting harmony   (.) sustainability   (.) and diversity   (.) and, therefore, creation, spirituality was the keynote of the address.Secondly   (.) she said there must be a change from the habit of dualism   (.) to, what she described as interconnectialism  (.) We must see a relationship between things. (.) In many parts of the earth, she said, the organised life in accordance with a sense of dualism   (.) body, spirit, man, women, black and white, poor and rich   (.) we must try and see   (.) them, in Christ   (.) coming together. (.) They all make sense. (.) The third change was from the culture of death   (.) to the culture of life. (.) What is happening right now in the Persian Gulf, she says, shows the best example of the culture of death! (.) She urged the assembly to use the energy of the Holy Spirit to tear apart all walks of division and culture of death in separators.Let us participate in the Holy Spirit of   (        ) of life   (.) fighting for our life on this earth in solidarity with all living peace. (.) Have you noticed   (.) if you listen hard to your radio tomorrow morning   (.) and you will hear so much about suffering and death   (.) and very little   (.) about life! (.) I think we had better try and influence that as churches   (.) not that we should    (.)  (        ) about the suffering that goes on   (.) about the death that goes on, but I think we ought to give all this   (.) another dimension in churches. (.) That one would be   (.) thankful of the fact that Christ   (.) has spoke   (.) and talked about life. (.) Now, this approach   (.) was criticised by the Orthodox church representatives as merely   (        ) criticism   (.) an attempt to unify different faiths. (.) But many of us saw it as an approach which emphasised the need to allow the faith of Christ to be incarnated within particular culture   (.) and Sir Paul , the former Archbishop of New Zealand took the same stand point as   (.) a Maori, in his own   (        ) address   (.) and called delegates present to speak and act as people of hope   (.) and to respond sensitively to economic and environment progility and isolation, not only in the Pacific but wherever they are. (.) Now then   (.) who do we assess   (        ) with the assembly?May I make   (.) one or two observations and then I'll finish. (.) On the whole, the assembly gave us   (        ) and understanding   (.) of the worldwide church which was struggling to achieve reconciliation and to promote peace     (.)  (        )  (.) and justice. (.) If we belong to the World Church then we must be   (.) in with   (.) part of this worldwide process   (.) and we shall never be ashamed of it. (.) Secondly, moreover, it was an experience a  (.) and an opportunity to meet Christians of other churches. (.) Differing traditions and those of other cultures and be in constant dialogue with them. (.) We never have that opportunity   (.) in this country do we?Unless we ask people to bring in people, for instance, from the Afro- Caribbean churches to join us in our worship and to lead our worship. (.) Can I also say   (.) that, er   (.) yes, we were badly served by the press   (.) but I think that er   (.) the onus now is on those of us who went to Canberra to be able to share with others and   (.) we have been going round to tell others about Canberra   (.) to share with you and with others   (.) the experience of being present in the World Council of Churches   (.) in Canberra. (.) I would hope that   (.) by the time we come to the next assembly   (.) where there is going to be   (.) that there will be an opportunity for the churches, er, at home here to take part in preparing for the next assembly.Also, that the churches at home, of whatever church or denomination we are to be   (.) they also can own, not just in   (.) the World Council of Churches. (.) At present, I do think that there is that kind of willingness to be   (.) er, engaged in this kind 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*IDA:	of preparation. (.) I think, we ought to be taking time to try and   (.) prepare, well   (.) for the next assembly   (.) and in doing so to own what goes on there and to say, yes   (.) as the previous speaker said   (.) we are the World Church in a very real way. (.) Now, moderator   (.) I've taken   (.) yes   (.) I'm only five out of 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	the programme!Er, can I say that it's been a great pleasure coming   (.) er, to you and to say that erm   (.) that there's far more to say, of course, about Canberra   (.) er, but I hope that that taster will help you to try and appreciate what went on there.Thank you very much indeed.
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*ENA:	Can I thank you for sharing with us the   (.) the example of the concentration, that you put so much in such a short time. (.) A good example for the rest of us!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	We've got the rest  (        ) ! (.) We're grateful for your taking the time to be with us. (.) We're grateful to your commitment to the   (.) ecumenical life of churches   (.) in Wales   (.) particularly. (.) Last week we met as a team, working with   (        ) and    (        )  (.) next week we will be meeting  (        ) . (.) So it'll be Hollywell to get  (        ) , it's a good way of  (        ) !
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	And   (        ) for your   (.) your time and your energy   (.) and for your fellowship as well.
*IDA:	It's very kind of you all 
*ENA:	Thank you.
*IDA:	Thank you very much.Yes.
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*ENA:	You're willing to, you're welcome to stay for as long as you wish   (        ) or to leave when you wish to leave. (        ) 
*IDA:	 (        ) 
*ENA:	to us. (.) We ought now to   (.) think briefly about  (        ) .
*PHI:	 (        ) is never to show any interest in anything
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	because, if you do you get landed with what I've got to do this afternoon! (.) And   (.) it was my concern that churches should know   (.) the implication of the children act as it's related to   (.) the life of the church that I'm   (.) landing in front of you. (.) You should of all   (.) saw the last Synod papers   (.) received this. (.) How many of you are familiar with it? (.) There are a few hands. (.) I've got a red and a blue, I'm sorry I haven't got yellow and green
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	but I couldn't   (.) get the   (        ) political parties. (.) It's not electioneering   (.) er, they're just in different coloured paper   (.) to please the eye. (.) Er, if you   (.) have not had a copy of this sent to you   (.) what I have said to them, by what I say afterwards   (.) erm   (.) it will be worth purchasing. (.) My question ha , again another question, how do you make the Lord interesting?
