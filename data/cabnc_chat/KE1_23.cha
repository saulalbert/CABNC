*STE:	three of my frets on the bottom string that you can't bend up, I don't know what's wrong. •175614_176046•
        And you hit it and it bends up and it just dies  and I've been sitting like, I mean I, I definitely don't think that it is anything with the way I hold it in like cos I've been sitting going  and I just, just hit it and it goes ee, it just dies so you can't bend, that's on  too. •176102_180480•
