*WEN:	He's horrible really you know.
*SAN:	I mean there are occasions when you  (        ) 
*WEN:	Don't you find it so terribly annoying that he's walking round   (.) not paying his poll tax?
*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	Don't you? (.) Well I do Sandra.I mean Doreen said   (.) erm I wouldn't do nothing about it but   (        ) well when we found out she said I will, I'll report him but   (.) you know when you know
*SAN:	Well I mean what   (.) all you can do really is anonymously    (.)  (        ) is phone up  (        ) 
*BEV:	Hello.
*WEN:	Oh here she is.Alright?
*BEV:	Hiya.Yeah.

*WEN:	I say if you want we'll phone Leslie
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	I said to Sandra, well this   (.) job business Bev, he's not said a bloody word to me this morning   (        ) he's, in actual fact   (.) he's been  (.) 
*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	well yeah, he hasn't been able to 
*SAN:	He hasn't been talking to anybody has he?
*WEN:	no, but he hasn't been able to because he has to come round    (        )  (.) but he's all ra ra ra ra, whistle whistle whistle.
*BEV:	Well let's face it, she said she'd phone me Tuesday 
*WEN:	Tuesday mm.But it's 
*BEV:	Now it's Thursday today
*WEN:	but there's there's something I didn't tell you the other day
*BEV:	Oh yeah
*WEN:	and I did say to you that you must go, if you go there you must go on the books because you're with a solicitor
*BEV:	Oh yeah.
*WEN:	Yeah.Well I, what I didn't tell you was   (        ) I don't know if I told Sandra did I? (.) No I didn't
*SAN:	 (        ) can't remember it.
*WEN:	No well    (.)  (        ) 
*BEV:	They wanted me to go on casual.
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	You can't be casual any more it's against the law.
*WEN:	Well   (.) well well
*BEV:	 (        ) even bar work   (        ) but it's 
*WEN:	well 
*BEV:	it's against the law now.
*WEN:	he said to me one day, and I don't remember the day   (.) he said the best thing would be for her to go on casual, then she can keep her thingy thingy.Well I never said 
*BEV:	Oh yeah, I'm sure! ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	yeah, well I never 
*SAN:	So you can do the same as him and you can also not register for poll tax.
*WEN:	Well she's registered already.
*BEV:	I'm registered already.
*WEN:	And I mean if she got this job she'd have to pay the full amount, if she's on Income Support you don't do you?
*BEV:	No.I only pay twenty percent when 
*WEN:	But that's beside the point.Yeah well   (        ) 
*BEV:	But I'd rather pay the lot   [laughing] I tell you  [] .
*WEN:	Well no, that's very fair comment Bev but I think this is a dodgy do.I find this 
*BEV:	It sounds it.
*WEN:	I find this strange.Anyway what he said to me was
*SAN:	I reckon they're gonna carry on paying her, keep her on the books   (        ) 
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Yeah, no they're not, they're giving her a lump sum 
*BEV:	You see with maternity they have to do it anyway.
*WEN:	Yeah but they're giving her it all in one lump sum, that's the deposit on their place.He told me that.But this other bit that I was telling you
*BEV:	Mm?
*WEN:	he phoned her that mor it was that morning, I know it was now, and anyway he went off and he phoned her and he came back and he said to me   (.) yes she'll, give us your phone number didn't he?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	And she said, he said she said yes that's cheaper for us.Cos they won't be paying any
*BEV:	Nothing.
*WEN:	thingy doodles, I, I said I don't think you ought to touch it.
*BEV:	Well   (.) I couldn't do that anyway, I'd have to say
*WEN:	Well that's what I said to you 
*BEV:	if you take me on then it's gotta go on
*WEN:	I told you that didn't I?But I didn't tell you all that was said cos I thought well I'm not gonna say it if there's no need   (.) because you would automatically go there 
*BEV:	 (        ) I ain't do nothing against the law.
*WEN:	Well I think it's gonna be difficult anyway Bev.And the bus fares will be
*BEV:	Well it'd be very expensive in the long run.
*SAN:	I don't   (.) well, (        ) probably like some of the others   (        ) cos they get a bus in on market day, they get a bus home
*BEV:	Well she said it, you have to catch the Woolworth one, the one for Woolworth and then walk half a mile.
*WEN:	I, I don't, I   (.) I'm bothered 
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	I know.I'm bothered about it though.
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Well Sandra
*SAN:	 (        ) and that's years back now.That was one po no that was seventy five   (.) each way but they go up through   (        ) and it's now gonna be twenty eight to Manor Road
*WEN:	Oh
*SAN:	just before the hospital
*WEN:	 (        ) the hospital?
*SAN:	and   (.) depending on whether they can't have an odd or even amount   (        ) forty eight to the Drove which is as far as, if you work at  (        ) , that's as far as you can get in the morning and get off and walk through.
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	But I'm, I'm bothered by all this.I know he's a liar, I know he can be a liar, but I'm still bothered by it, I mean
*BEV:	Well  (        ) 
*WEN:	it's Thursday and she was supposed to phone you Tuesday but he still keeps   (        ) 
*BEV:	If she phones then it'll it, it will be   (.) I wouldn't take it unless it's on my terms.
*WEN:	 (        )  (.) I think it, you know
*BEV:	It would have to go through the books
*WEN:	Well it would.
*BEV:	because no way 
*SAN:	Well somebody sooner or later's gonna catch up, I can't understand really why these people think oh I'll get away with it.
*BEV:	I don't know why they bother.I don't know why they   (        ) 
*WEN:	Well it's like 
*SAN:	Cos they don't half hammer you and if they catch up with you once they watch you like a hawk.
*WEN:	Yeah but this is the one that ain't paying his poll tax look Bev.
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Ain't registered.Well you've bloody registered and you've only been back a month haven't you?
*BEV:	Month and a bit yeah.
*WEN:	Month and a bit.
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	No I don't like this, I don't er   (.) it sticks in your mind don't it?
*BEV:	Well it would be on my terms, there's no way I'd go   (        ) cos I know it's against the law  (        ) 
*WEN:	Well Sue said that to me up here didn't she?
*SAN:	Yeah and they   (        ) 
*BEV:	They can't do it.
*SAN:	and it was too much hassle to put her into any other job.
*WEN:	Yes it was. (.) But I mean
*SAN:	 (        ) National Insurance  (        ) 
*WEN:	Mm. (.) Oh that's something I was  (        ) 
*SAN:	Cos quite how they work it out   (.) I know before 
*WEN:	Well 
*SAN:	you had to notify all your employ everybody knew
*WEN:	Yeah.
*SAN:	and between them they decided
*WEN:	Yeah.Right   (.) now 
*SAN:	 (        ) twenty five percent cash  (        ) 
*WEN:	I've just remembered this, her saying about Annette, you know when Sue came up and said about erm   (.) being stunk out by the exhaust on that 
*SAN:	Yeah 
*WEN:	bloody lorry   (.)  (        )

*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	right?And I said yeah, I was on one and Suzie was on seven, and I said yeah, even the cleaners complain, you know, in the evening that he don't shut the door when he goes to the loo   (.) and er I said, must have said, when she's working and Dee Dee turned round and she gl she laughed and said working?I said well whatever you wanna call it.And then er I said well th this place was never like this when old   (        ) was here and, and Dee said no it damned well wasn't.And I looked at Sue and I said you know   [laughing] she's got twenty jobs    []  (.) erm two cleaning   (.) and
*SAN:	Childminding.
*WEN:	childminding.And I said how, I  (        ) , how does he get on  (        ) ?She said oh that's up to her, that's nothing to do with us. (.) So if he does declare them
*SAN:	Well if she's childminding, she can say she's self employed.
*BEV:	She's self employed there.
*SAN:	Therefore   (.)  (        ) 
*BEV:	Was it there when you left for work this morning?
*WEN:	There were there were four there this morning when I went to work.

*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Yeah but what's the point?What's the point?If I can   (        ) 
*BEV:	Because you might they might say before you can do anything you've gotta give them this fourteen days notice.
*WEN:	Well then they'll tell me won't they?But at least it'll be on the cards won't it?I'd sooner tape because I mean that was quite impressive that tape with all that static wasn't it?

*WEN:	Oh yeah.
*BEV:	 (        )

*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Who said, who told them  (        ) ?
*BEV:	Well they're actually paying for it on the erm  (.) 
*WEN:	On the books?
*BEV:	books.This is the council.They wrote back and said   (.) you have proof but you don't have receipts and
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	No I know
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	 (        )  (.) er
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	Yeah.Cos she said well   (        )  (.)

*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	What the whole  (        ) ?
*BEV:	Yes.When I twisted it
*WEN:	Yeah?
*BEV:	to turn it on well it suddenly went.
*WEN:	Oh well he said he   (.) he said he'd have to have a look at it didn't he? (.) 
*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	What? (.)  (        ) 
*BEV:	Oh look look.
*WEN:	Well if I   (.) erm 
*BEV:	Could take it down Leslie's and tell her or  (.) 
*WEN:	What?
*BEV:	will she want a tape down there?
*WEN:	Oh we'll see.I'll take that, I'll readdress that letter   (.) and 
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	and that can go in the   (.) box can't it?
*BEV:	Yeah. (.) 
*WEN:	Normally, I say, I don't see the point of staying in for this.
*BEV:	No.
*WEN:	I know we've gotta go out tomorrow but then if we don't go down there today we're not gonna go this week.
*BEV:	No. (.) But she   (.) she was pleased to hear
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	 (        ) give you a hand with this.
*WEN:	Yeah. (.) It's dirty, it runs out black.That's a new, brand new tap that is. (.) Brand new tap. (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	I don't know who you do that  (        ) 
*BEV:	Well let's take the whole lot out. (.) Well give me the bowl and I'll put it in the bath.
*WEN:	That'll be a job for Tim won't it?
*BEV:	Yeah.Oh yeah. (.) 
*WEN:	I just hope that that boy
*BEV:	I'm sure he will.
*WEN:	I mean he
*BEV:	Oh yeah
*WEN:	he said he understood why we wanted to do it.But 
*BEV:	And   (        ) can hear the crackle and the bloody  (        ) 
*WEN:	Yeah you can
*BEV:	cos the ba er the crackle is very bad.These two?
*WEN:	Yeah, that's all we've got left.
*BEV:	 ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	Yeah well I mean with all this noise and that you don't feel like doing much do you?
*BEV:	No.
*WEN:	Anyway I talked to Ann about this this morning and we've come to the decision to leave it on   (.) because that's what we did in the   (.) in the erm  (.) 
*BEV:	We knew you would.
*WEN:	in the ha in the what's name there and it might be a better idea because it's not  (        ) .So if we start pulling them about which is   (.) cos I said to her about the hall and if I don't scrub it all off   (.) we're gonna have to   (        ) erm   (.) gonna have to do the hall and er I said we've got to try to put it on because the walls are so   (.) ooh   (.) bitty   (.) you know what I mean?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	And er I really feel that, you know, you can make yourself more bloody trouble   (.) cos that's what happened to Helen   (.) next door.When she got the erm   (.) paper off in the erm er er in the hall, she found it all fell apart.All the walls fell apart. (.) 
*BEV:	It's like living back in the flat.
*WEN:	I've done this before, but I mean Tim will have to have a look at it when he
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	if it, if we can't, oh it's the dustman 
*BEV:	Have we 
*WEN:	dustman innit?
*BEV:	Yeah.Have we got a bucket? (.) 
*WEN:	I've got a bucket yeah, why?
*BEV:	Well it's easier with a bucket.
*WEN:	Oh. (.) Oh a kettle should do, after that lot. (.) If we can get that lot sorted
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	and then you can use the kettle can't you?
*BEV:	Yes. (.) Oh    (        )  (.) finished that sleeve off but I must sew it on.
*WEN:	Yeah?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	 (        ) ?
*BEV:	Yeah. (.) 
*WEN:	Right I'll leave that there. (.) No I'm afraid this Des is  (.) 
*BEV:	Well I'm not bothered.
*WEN:	a very peculiar character, I just find it all so peculiar. (.) And I mean Dee said to me this morning   (.) cos she heard us one morning
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	well Des, she heard Des look   (.) talking about it   (.) and er   (.) she said has she heard anything and I said no, I said not fully but more or less   (.) we stayed in yesterday   (.) cos you said shall we go out didn't you?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	And I said more or less we stayed in but not a word. (.) And I say there was some sort of a   (.) an embarrassment I can only call it
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	today. (.) All this whistling and  (.) 
*BEV:	It was all nervous.
*WEN:	nervous, yeah.Bit of singing and   (.) and that sort of thing. (.) Well they wanna, don't matter to me at all I just think they're dodgy characters.And you know they don't pay the poll tax and you   (.) you've been told almost you can do it on   (.) casual.You got to think about it ain't you?
*BEV:	Mm.Well I wouldn't do it on cas 
*WEN:	Eh?
*BEV:	I said I wouldn't do it on casual. (.) 
*WEN:	Well you wouldn't do it, no.Too much bloody worry, I mean we've never done anything like that anyway.I say it's like him   (.) him not paying his poll tax.If he's gonna do things like that he wants to keep his gob shut doesn't he?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	You know?I just   (.) can't understand.But mind you he can't keep his gob shut, so I do understand   (.) you know that er
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	that is the way he is. (.) He's full of gut really. (.) But anyway if they did phone now I think it's very bad practice   (.) if she's leaving tomorrow
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	cos Sandra said why the hell has she left so late?You know I mean it must be three weeks now till she has it.She said you don't normally do that.
*BEV:	Well she could have it any day now.
*WEN:	Well that's what she said, fortnight either way actually.Just exactly what Sandra said. (.) So she been in next door has she, all, the whole morning?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Yeah well of course only just gone from last bloody night haven't they? (.) I mean she seems to fill the bloody house with people every day of the week. (.) Certainly some strange goings on in there I reckon.
*BEV:	Yeah well you see some people can't help that.
*WEN:	Some people what? (.) 
*BEV:	Can't help that.
*WEN:	Help what? (.) 
*BEV:	But have people round.
*WEN:	Yeah but it's such a strange bloody house innit?Don't know what's going on in there do you?
*BEV:	Well I would have liked to have known what the noise was last night, I'm sure it was a video game or something.
*WEN:	If it picked up, if he finds what I think he could probably find us   (.) I mean he knows precisely what we want and   (        ) 
*BEV:	He wants an amplifier.
*WEN:	Yes but as I said before   (.) he now has heard it so 
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	he knows what we want to eliminate. (.) 
*BEV:	Oh he'll come up trumps for us.
*WEN:	I'm sure he will. (.)  (        )  (.) What about the animals this morning then?
*BEV:	Oh not bad. (.) 
*WEN:	Well probably cos somebody'd been with them.Innit? (.) Well if they're not left continually on their own they've got a bit of company haven't they?
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	That's the point.But when they're left totally on their own for hours and hours.Well    (.)  (        ) make the veg    (        )  (.) if I do that.
*BEV:	Woman and the man went up the garden
*WEN:	The woman what?
*BEV:	Woman and the man   (.) and the kid
*WEN:	Yeah?
*BEV:	the alsatian and one other bloody  (        ) 
*WEN:	Went up the garden?What were they doing then? (.) 
*BEV:	Talk. (.) 
*WEN:	Got a chicken and a bloody rabbit up there.Well there was.Whether there still is, I mean   (.) I used to hear the chicken making a ruddy noise.I mean obviously you won't hear the rabbit but   (.) I don't think I'm gonna stay in   (        ) anyway.Alright so we'll be out two days   (        ) there's 
*BEV:	No but you're staying with me.
*WEN:	nothing to do.I mean we even get bored with the knitting.
*BEV:	 (        )  ((speaking with mouth full))
*WEN:	Eh?
*BEV:	You can very easily get bored with knitting.
*WEN:	Mm.What's the  (        ) ?Oh    (        )  (.) But I mean I get to work I'm so bloody tired.I'll get those earplugs out   (.) for night times if it's necessary.
*BEV:	Mm. (.) 
*WEN:	 (        )  (.) 
*BEV:	There you are.
*WEN:	What? (.) Yeah. (.) No we can shove that in the box.
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Don't know what it is, don't need to open it do we? (.) I know he's, he's up there this weekend. (.) 
*BEV:	Well you do know
*WEN:	What? (.) 
*BEV:	he'd probably be very pleased to see   (.) well all three of us if we wanted to.
*WEN:	Oh they brought that back in.
*BEV:	Yeah, I didn't think they were going. (.) All three of us if we went up for a weekend.
*WEN:	He's gotta work Bev, he's not doing enough.He's not doing enough, he had one bad result another  (        ) 
*BEV:	Oh, I didn't know that.
*WEN:	No you didn't did you?Couple of decent ones and one bad one.And his average is sixty two percent. (.)  (        ) Sunday but I mean   (.) I'm not sure, I'll say it now, I'm not sure   (.) I'm certainly not sure he's doing enough. (.) If you think about it   (.) if you think about it I've probably  (        ) 
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	 (        ) where he is up and down, up and down and people are in and out and
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	well I'm sorry but from where I'm looking at it    (.)  (        ) sixty two   (        ) but   (.) not that I've thought about it in any depth but   (.)  (        ) 
*BEV:	Mm
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	But there again   (        ) and that have lived in town before 
*WEN:	Oh yeah.
*BEV:	so maybe not.
*WEN:	 (        )  (.)  (        )  (.) Probably touting for business, that's all it is.Barclays have lost a load of money.
*BEV:	Yeah. (.) Right I can start
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	if you want.
*WEN:	It's in the freezer, there's a packet   (        ) 
*BEV:	Well I'll I'll do er   (.) carrots and that first.
*WEN:	And I say if you do the spuds just well, if they start to go brown inside chuck them.
*BEV:	Right.
*WEN:	Cos it goes right the way through. (.) There's a lot of   (        ) out to the hospital though innit?
*BEV:	Yeah. (.) 
*WEN:	Well I think we'll have to find somewhere to lock it, well Danny says there's places all over. (.) 
*BEV:	Well there will be.
*WEN:	Yeah.Could get a, quite a   (.) a good deal I would have thought   (.) somewhere. (.) 
*BEV:	 (        ) use this   (.) tomato and onion?
*WEN:	Well why not? (.) Yeah that's a good idea.
*BEV:	With minced beef, I won't put carrots in cos that 
*WEN:	No.
*BEV:	might not be
*WEN:	Well see what they say.Is there anything in here I've gotta get out?
*BEV:	Well the things will be in there
*WEN:	 (        ) things 
*BEV:	Yeah one   (.) So I won't do carrots
*WEN:	No.But you need some more onion
*BEV:	Yeah I'll do an onion.
*WEN:	the potato will be on the top anyway so   (.) that won't matter will it? (.) 
*BEV:	Well it says serve with   (.) fresh mince vegetable, mixed vegetables.Cos what you do is you put your meat in that, you don't put your
*WEN:	No
*BEV:	potato in it   (.) do potato on the side
*WEN:	Oh well we can do that then.That'll be simpler anyway won't it?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	It'll be a pot of potatoes but   (.) I should put some onion in there though.
*BEV:	Oh yeah.
*WEN:	Cos he'll want that.
*BEV:	And your meat
*WEN:	And your meat yeah.
*BEV:	So  (.) 
*WEN:	Well that'll be a bit simpler won't it?Could that be done in a pot?
*BEV:	Yeah, well it's for casserole so  (.) 
*WEN:	Well a pot will be simpler for when we get back if she's in of course but  (.) 
*BEV:	No I can't see why not.
*WEN:	 (        )  (.) Mind you get your tea.
*BEV:	Yeah. (.) 
*WEN:	I think we need a breather anyway.
*BEV:	Well it's just a waste of a lovely day.
*WEN:	Yeah.It's beautiful innit? (.) 
*BEV:	Well no, the reason I    (        )  (.) and because these things just go so quickly
*WEN:	Well yeah
*BEV:	that maybe it would work out cheaper to start all over again.Well they   (.) I would think up there there's a screw 
*WEN:	Screw yeah. (.) Well  (        ) 
*BEV:	Will you have the new fashion taps or do you want   (.) different bits here? (        ) 
*WEN:	This but this is twenty five pounds worth there.
*BEV:	Yes I know. (.) 
*WEN:	I mean it was only months ago cos it's only a while ago that Tim came. (.) I saw that   (        ) down there again. (.) 
*BEV:	Do you want some more onion than that, yes?
*WEN:	I should chuck another one in, what difference does it make?
*BEV:	Oh my eyes!
*WEN:	Yeah   (.) that is it. (.) I mean there is a lot of wall space here that is not wall look.
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	 (        ) but I can't see the point of doing vinyl on that anyway   (.) I really cannot. (.)
