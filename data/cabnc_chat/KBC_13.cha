        Why did they take it a stage further with him? •180600_180853•
        He'd got high blood pressure, he wasn't in any pain  he's living a normal life. •180853_181628•

*GOR:	where, he wanted a heart bypass? •182385_182618•
*AUD:	first and foremost he was in a private scheme. •182618_182906•
*GOR:	Well,probably that's it then. •182907_183057•
*AUD:	Yeah. •183109_183156•
        and probably because because of his father and er  the the other relative  having the bypasses done. •183156_183834•
        So they took it  •183876_183950•
*GOR:	Mm. •183950_183953•
*AUD:	a step further, but I think probably, it's because he was in er  er a private scheme. •183953_184436•

        I mean I think  er, when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tablets ever, so, I think it's kept it all under control and you've, you, we eat a sensible diet. •185587_186763•
        The only, the only er  thing I complained about with you is, is the butter. •186769_187006•

*GOR:	I don't eat that much bread you see. •187565_187889•
*AUD:	No. •187903_187947•
        So I, I think really, and I think  what I think with him, I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family, it runs in the family. •187947_189219•
