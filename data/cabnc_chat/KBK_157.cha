*CHR:	I see right. •721302_722322•
*DAV:	. •_•
        When you start is to do a thing, put that mallet down like that and then line up the which you need to go. •725792_734032•
*CHR:	I see. •734382_734862•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes. •734962_735322•
*DAV:	The other ball contact, must be a contact there. •735322_742692•
*CHR:	Yes. •743082_743372•
*DAV:	Just about enough  the red from . •746732_752982•
        Now that yellow, that blue ball must move •753562_755062•
*CHR:	Right. •756022_756302•
*DAV:	otherwise it's fault. •756302_757522•
        Now where that centre of that V is  where the black ball will go. •761582_766152•
*CHR:	Right. •766502_767192•
        Got you. •767192_767442•
*DAV:	I, I don't tend to do it like that at all, I do   it very nearly go, it's on the wrong side unfortunately.. •768192_793562•
*CHR:	Yes, yes, it, it did curl with the grass didn't it? •793922_803732•
*DAV:	Yes.. •803912_804172•
*CHR:	Right. •806512_806802•
        What you didn't want to do in that case, no  •806802_812192•
*DAV:	No .. •812682_813102•
*CHR:	Yes indeed. •815472_816452•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right. •816572_816802•
*DAV:	You can . •816802_817092•
*CHR:	Yes, I see. •819042_819512•
*DAV:	So it doesn't matter if this ball goes off. •819822_826332•
        Moving slightly the wrong way. •826332_832222•
*CHR:	Yes. •834632_834802•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes. •835342_835542•
*DAV:	, where, where you want the ball to come back. •845072_860642•
*CHR:	I understand, yes, yes. •860682_862182•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right. •865782_866202•
*DAV:	And there's no benefit of having a row  as you had before. •866662_870182•
*CHR:	Right. •877172_877532•
*DAV:	. •_•
        The black would of come up about there. •878042_887332•
*CHR:	Yes. •887812_888202•
*DAV:	Which would've enabled me to rush,up there, but I didn't. •888522_892582•
*CHR:	Right. •892582_892822•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right. •893142_893482•
        O K •894832_895152•
*DAV:	Right now you come out  or go up to red. •895312_899232•
        I think I would just go up to red •901082_903562•
*CHR:	Yes. •904012_904312•
*DAV:	till you've got the feel of it, I . •904312_905122•
*CHR:	Right, fine. •906552_907312•
*DAV:	And the object is to hit red. •909472_910912•
*CHR:	Yes, quite, quite, it's, it's intriguing because it's so so different to what I had in mind. •912312_917762•
        Eh that was strange stuff  •925952_927502•
