*PS04U:	God . 
*PS04Y:	He joined when he was seventeen or sixteen Made redundant He can not get another job . 
*PS04U:	We were saying that Ron in number four he was a builder He had his own business van the whole lot he had staff working for him And he hurt his back last year and the doctor said well you 'll either be dead within six months You 've got ta give up the building work He 's only thirty odd thirty seven thirty eight Given it up and he said oh well got no kids you know they live in this house got no kids And they always have a holiday abroad and they go out a lot good social life They eat out once a week you know . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	And because she ca n't have children and er this was what last June it all happened He said oh alright I 'll do something you know cement or milkman . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	or something just casual couple of hours Could n't get nothing . 
*PS04Y:	No No . 
*PS04U:	Absolutely nothing And say he 's round about the fortyish age and we spoke to him last week and I said you got a job yet He said no and I 'm getting worried now he said me my wife works full time and we could cope on the money but he said now we do n't go out . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	You know once a fortnight He said we 're not getting the luxuries like we could when we were both working full time . 
*PS04Y:	Mm Mm . 
*PS04U:	He said we 're surviving . 
*PS04Y:	Mm Oh yes . 
*PS04U:	Cos they 've got a next to nothing mortgage . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah Mm . 
*PS04U:	But er . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah it 's like with me I mean of course do n't forget that I 've got a good two hundred pounds to come on about the fifth of December from the British Legion 's savings . 
*PS04U:	Oh of course you have . 
*PS04Y:	I 've been saving five pounds a week for practically the whole of the year And that will be chucked into the building society so that I can when I get my Marks and Spencers debt come through I can pay a great wodge off . 
*PS04U:	Off that . 
*PS04Y:	But I shall still have to draw on some capital Brenda nevertheless . 
*PS04U:	You will I mean you have to Christmas time though do n't you . 
*PS04Y:	Well erm I have thought now what shall I do after Christmas Because you know I like January I 've achieved a Christmas I 've made everybody happy . 
*PS04U:	That 's right . 
*PS04Y:	And I thought that sewing machine is really going to get out to work And I 'm not going to buy any fabric I 'm going to make up the fabric I 've got And it 's I 'm going to do things for the house like I want to make erm Chris has put back the rail over my windowsill I do n't whether you remember I had a bamboo pole . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	And I made a a thing and it looked awful . 
*PS04U:	I know you said . 
*PS04Y:	and I took it down But I bought some beautiful crimson bias binding from Laura Ashley do n't laugh but I 'm taking the valance of Paul 's bed . 
*PS04U:	I remember you saying . 
*PS04Y:	because it 's a white valance And I 'm going to have this white frill sp er erm roll and I 'm going to roll the fabric I 'm going to leave all the pleating not cut into that but cut the valance platform and fold it over if you understand me and make it go over the the pole . 
*PS04U:	That 's a good idea . 
*PS04Y:	Erm so that I 'll have oh plenty of gathers you see but the pole will be smooth My mistake was to to spread something through that went into horrid nasty gathers on the pole Did n't look anything just looked messy So I thought have it smooth over the pole and then all frilly underneath and this lovely line of soft crimson And I thought you know I mean when when erm Philip goes and I 'm in the en suite in in the en suite bedroom Everybody says it does pay you to have the house looking fresh That room the paint to my eye has either faded or changed colour or something Now I noticed this with in the sitting room this year I got John friend of Nev 's to repaint the walls because do you remember they were called soft peach . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	And I looked at them and I thought that is n't soft peach any more That 's a glaring pink . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	I suspect that Dulux emulsion paint changes colour . 
*PS04U:	Oh yeah it does Tell you what I 've got it 's a marvellous thing The decorators at Peter 's works cos they they erm tradesmen they 've got a colour card . 
*PS04Y:	Ah yes I 've got that . 
*PS04U:	Have you this is the tradesmen 's card . 
*PS04Y:	Which one is it . 
*PS04U:	It 's a Dulux but you ca n't get it from the shop It 's tradesmen . 
*PS04Y:	No that 's right Erm Anthony Anthony got me that . 
*PS04U:	Got one yeah Marvellous are n't they . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah . 
*PS04U:	cos you got every single . 
*PS04Y:	Which year is it . 
*PS04U:	Now This year . 
*PS04Y:	Oh I have n't got the up to date one Let's have a quick gander through Erm so I thought what have I got I 've actually got a great load still of gardenia and white mixed which is what was put on the walls in the sitting room I thought I 'll put that on the walls in the bedroom I 'm not going to bother to go out and buy new paint when I 've got a damn great tub . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	of this lovely soft pale cream Erm I do n't know whether I was with you when I bought er rolls of . 
*PS04U:	Borders . 
*PS04Y:	Borders I 've got a very pale grey . 
*PS04U:	Remember that in Marks and Sparks a couple of months back they were selling borders off and I bought a beautiful aqua one And they were fifty p each on a background . 
*PS04Y:	I wonder if they 're still doing them . 
*PS04U:	No They were just it was just a one day I went round there shopping and they had and I bought some beige ones for the kitchen . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	Erm and it cost me two quid I think for the four . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	And I mean I have n't put them up yet I thought I 'll wait to I sort of really like the bathroom I want to it 's got the wallpaper starting to peel off . 
*PS04Y:	Tal speaking of wallpaper I am going to paper the en suite Er I only need two rolls . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	Possibly even one So I 'm going to look in the in the bin And I shall make some more little cushions for the bedroom and I 'm going to use this idea of terribly ordinary cotton . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	there 's nothing wonderful about the cotton but the cushions look absolutely superb because there were just thin lines of the you can tell it was when you looked at it quite cheap ribbon but just arranged in a beautiful square and then a little bit of lace . 
*PS04U:	like those tissue boxes Now I 've got a friend of mine that makes them Now that was seven ninety nine that you bought for Rosemary Now that was Marks they 're nice ones Now she gets them and she sells them for ten quid . 
*PS04Y:	I say . 
*PS04U:	And they 're not I mean they 're pretty but they 're not that magnolia range in Marks is lovely . 
*PS04Y:	That 's lovely yes . 
*PS04U:	And but she sells them . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah . 
*PS04U:	You know she does parties as well but . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah yeah . 
*PS04U:	she said she she 's losing the profit at selling them at ten pounds . 
*PS04Y:	Yes Mm . 
*PS04U:	Because the lace the time She said tissue . 
*PS04Y:	Do you remember when we tried to make fluffy dogs . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	And we found we just were were wasting our time . 
*PS04U:	Wasting our time . 
*PS04Y:	You 're up against the factory conveyor belt system of sewing when you one person does only ears and the other does bodies and . 
*PS04U:	That 's right . 
*PS04Y:	Yes Yes that is lovely . 
*PS04U:	It 's good is n't it . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	I think we ought to get some kip . 
*PS04Y:	I think so I hate to but erm . 
*PS04U:	talk for tonight . 
*PS04Y:	I must . 
*PS04U:	I wan na in a minute . 
*PS04Y:	No and we must . 
*PS04U:	It 's quarter past twelve . 
*PS04Y:	I do n't like going up late nor do you . 
*PS04U:	Right . 
*PS04Y:	But we 'll have plenty of sleep I mean I think five six hour 's sleep is absolutely enough . 
*PS04U:	Oh yeah I 'll get Dave to set the alarm and then we can have breakfast before we sort of rush out Otherwise I 'll sleep through . 
*PS04Y:	Mm Well that 's partly what did me today I was deter you see I I have to set a good example to Neil And I was determined that everywhere although not absolutely superbly glittering everywhere was going to be tidy before I left So I went through every blessed room Tidy tidy tidy Throwing away rubbish you know what it is . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	Bitsy bitsy bitsy of this and that and the other Came out without anything inside me and then had this ghastly experience of not I was I was banking on being able to get a hot cup of coffee on the train No coffee And then this wretched journey . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	And I got thoroughly upset . 
*PS04U:	Oh you could tell right on the phone you were sort of all keyed up with it . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah . 
*PS04U:	Do you need a drink of water or anything . 
*PS04Y:	No thanks dear . 
*PS04U:	You 're alright You might hear Dave switch that off in the morning Erm but he probably wo n't .
