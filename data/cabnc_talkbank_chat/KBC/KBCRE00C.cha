*PS1A9:	Well er well first .  1823113_1823853
*PS1AA:	where he wanted a heart bypass .  1823853_1826183
*PS1A9:	first and foremost he was in a private scheme .  1826183_1829063
*PS1AA:	Well pro probably that 's it then .  1829073_1830573
*PS1A9:	Yeah A and probably because i because of his father and er the rela the other relative having the bypasses done So they took it .  1831093_1839503
*PS1AA:	Mm .  1839503_1839533
*PS1A9:	a step further but I think probably it 's because he was in er er a private scheme .  1839533_1844363

*PS1A9:	Ah well I well I would n't say that really Gordon I mean I think er when your blood pressure was found out and you 'd been taking tablets ever so I think it 's kept it all under control and you 've you we eat a sensible diet The only the only er thing I complained about with you is is the butter .  1852653_1870063
*PS1AA:	Mm I do n't have that much now .  1870523_1872183

*PS1AA:	I do n't eat that much bread you see .  1875653_1878893
