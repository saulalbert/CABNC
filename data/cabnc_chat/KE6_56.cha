        Well •240116_240125•
*BEV:	It'll be unfortunate for the couple that, whoever got woken up •240182_240563•
*WEN:	Yeah. •240563_240571•
        But it might do something. •240571_240719•
        I know what you're meaning. •240719_240940•
*BEV:	Cos you dunno what Alan might have done. •240940_241074•
*WEN:	Ay? •241115_241125•
*BEV:	You dunno what Alan might have done. •241160_241327•
*WEN:	Well  •241341_241363•
*BEV:	If that car was there and •241465_241607•
*WEN:	Yeah. •241607_241638•
        It, I think he got out and I I do  , I said to you and your father how he got out I just dunno! •241664_242299•
        Cos it's a very difficult road this. •242307_242544•
*BEV:	Yeah. •242548_242578•
*WEN:	But I think he did  probably just, because when I got up  er  when I , you see when I come down the stairs I can see through that window look •242606_243605•
*BEV:	Mm. •243644_243665•
*WEN:	and  Alan's light was on in the hall, call it the hall  and the car was there  well a little while later  he went. •243823_244738•
        I think he got out  but I don't think it would have been easy, there's  that time this morning. •244738_245312•
        And, I've never known these people  put the car down by George's! •245312_245925•
        So, knowing Alan, do you remember somebody  used to park their car in front of Alan's gate when they went to London? •245926_246509•
*BEV:	Yeah. •246509_246553•
*WEN:	And he left a note on the windscreen. •246613_246828•
        But I mean Alan has to go up to London! •246828_247286•
        It's not long after six o'clock in the morning that he leaves. •247286_247825•
        But er  , I fully understand what you're saying. •247825_248671•
        Really! •248671_248713•
*BEV:	Well I say  some  let's say Sandra wanted to get out •248761_249521•
*WEN:	Yeah. •249584_249593•
*BEV:	and couldn't  and can't  •249617_249704•
*WEN:	Yeah! •249708_249735•
        Yeah! •249736_249737•
*BEV:	Right? •249774_249809•
*WEN:	Yeah. •249878_249899•
*BEV:	And she should be able to. •249899_250118•
*WEN:	But another thing is you see  where Sandra lives, you saying that  where she lives is apparently  erm  P C , now I don't know him, but she does  he lives up the same road  and when people park  didn't she tell you this when we were coming down? •250118_252004•
*BEV:	No , I don't mean that Sandra, I meant this one! •252004_252206•
*WEN:	Oh Sandra over here? •252224_252277•
*BEV:	Right? •252341_252364•
*WEN:	Yeah. •252364_252390•
*BEV:	Let's just say she couldn't out •252422_252618•
*WEN:	Yeah. •252625_252638•
*BEV:	and she went to Claire and George tonight •252639_252895•
*WEN:	Yeah. •252895_252901•
*BEV:	and said is  anybody staying with you? •252916_253218•
*WEN:	Oh yeah, that'd do it! •253235_253589•
*BEV:	That would do it wouldn't it? •253590_253721•
*WEN:	But, what I was gonna say was  concerning them blocking these pavements  if the  •253730_254064•
*BEV:	I know as I was there when she  •254064_254312•
*WEN:	You were there when she said about P C . •254359_254485•
        Well if we had some  I know there's two policemen up round the corner here. •254485_254907•
        Cos they walk down here, here  •254920_255154•
*BEV:	Is there any one in ? •255154_255259•
*WEN:	Well P C  I think  is an older policeman. •255259_255807•
*BEV:	Yeah, that's what I meant. •255807_256023•
*WEN:	Mm. •256026_256047•
        These are two young-uns I reckon they lodge up here somewhere. •256087_256298•
        Not this road  but round  where Colin and  •256298_256842•
*BEV:	any policemen isn't she? •256842_257012•
*WEN:	Ay? •257012_257036•
        You what? •257036_257049•
*BEV:	The lodger, policeman. •257049_257566•
*WEN:	Who did? •257566_257629•
*BEV:	Linda. •257640_257653•
*WEN:	Yeah, she did didn't she? •257712_258043•
*BEV:	A nice one. •258043_258095•
*WEN:	I forgot that. •258095_258211•
        Yeah. •258288_258302•
        Yeah. •258302_258305•
        But you see somebody like P C , being an older person  he does it properly I suppose, is what  •258305_259589•
*BEV:	Yeah. •259589_259598•
*WEN:	the answer is. •259598_259659•
        He goes and knocks people's door and says you're blocking the pavement! •259659_259975•
        Well if he'd have come down here that night, or that day  when there was three cars in  in the drive and one  right across the pavement, and then that  that big lorry on the pavement  he'd have had them wouldn't he? •259976_261457•
*BEV:	Yeah. •261457_261476•
