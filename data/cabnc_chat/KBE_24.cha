I said do you realize we owe Julie fifteen pound and she wants it today. We borrowed it to go out with. Well you'll have to pay her won't you.  (.) I thought well, I don't know. He's hopeless. 
*UNK:	Why does she want it today, I mean you got to pay it back  (  )  
*BET:	Well yes. So she said give me thirteen didn't she. Cos she owed me two. 
*UNK:	I don't know  (  ) .

*UNK:	Don't worry. You know I don't worry. 
*BET:	I'm not in a very strong position anyway  (  )  
*UNK:	I asked one of they didn't I? 
*BET:	Yeah nobody said yes did they? 
*UNK:	Ask Clayton, he'll pay for it. Say give our our   (  ) some money for doing me hair.
