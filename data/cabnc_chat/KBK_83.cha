@Comment:	conversation #83 (Tape 002317)
*NOR:	But erm, Liz is getting hassle from her insurance company about her claim on her new door.
*CHR:	Oh yes.
*NOR:	No what happened?
*CHR:	No I don't remember your telling me.
*NOR:	When Suzannah went down there, (        ) from last, she was strap strapping Layla into the back seat
*CHR:	Mhm.
*NOR:	for Liz, while Liz went into the house to get something, and someone came down Hurst Road, misjudged it, and scrapped the car door, bashed Lizzie's side and scraped along side of her car, as she drove past  (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	And it meant a respray on her car and a new door for Lizzie's car, sit down.
*CHR:	Right.
*NOR:	And Jim said she was going far too fast, took up all three car lengths, parked cars to stop.
*CHR:	Phew.
*NOR:	And, and obviously she was going to  (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	And   (        ) happened, opened the door any wider, cos she was still strapping the child in.Of which she had been doing as Liz left the car.
*CHR:	Yes.Was Suzannah hurt?
*NOR:	No, she wasn't, only the car door.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	But now Lizzie's insurance company have said they'll do what they can for her, but as she had opened the door into the oncoming traffic, probably was her fault.
*CHR:	And this took place in Hurst Road?I mean  (.) 
*NOR:	Yes.
*CHR:	tha  (.) that's a bit of a nonsense to my mind.
*NOR:	Well exactly, I mean there's double parking in a single line and the lady   (        ) weary.
*CHR:	You can't move at more than about fifteen miles an hour maximum down Hurst Road anyway can you?
*NOR:	 (        ) Anyway, Liz is a bit annoyed because she doesn't want to lose her no claims bonus.
*CHR:	Absolutely.Absolutely right, yes.
*NOR:	And I feel in a way slightly responsible that it was Suzannah.
*CHR:	Well I don't suppose Suzannah was doing anything she shouldn't have been.
*NOR:	No she wasn't, but even so, you know, I said that to Liz, Liz said oh it's not, it's nothing to do with your responsibility.E  (.) even so she has to pay the first something or other you, as one does in a claim
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	towards the new door.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	She said I've paid that, that's not a hassle or, anyway she's paid it, she's said that's not a hassle, but er, I thought well maybe I   (        ) some money, I don't know, what do you normally pay on these things, twenty five, twenty six?
*CHR:	Oh its variable.
*NOR:	But it does, so, she said she hasn't got an up to date highway code knows anything about it about taking repair in narrow street  (        ) .Well I found a couple of possible useful quotes of the highway code.
*CHR:	Mm.Good.
*NOR:	I, I'm going to   (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	 (        ) if you like.
*NOR:	Well she, I gave her the   (.) the clause number thing.
*CHR:	Right  (.) 
*NOR:	 (        ) should be fighting for her on this not giving way   (        ) 
*CHR:	Well I mean, who's her broker?
*NOR:	She doesn't have one you see.
*CHR:	Oh, she should use Jeffrey  hasn't she?
*NOR:	No, she didn't say.She feels that they're not really interested as long as, you know
*CHR:	Well I wouldn't, I, I would recommend that you tell her to contact Jeffrey, say will you take this on for me please, and ca  (.) carry my car insurance for me in future.
