@Comment:	conversation #8 (Tape 006408)
*NON:	That school like, Alexander goes to I mean it's a good place to go to isn't it? If you can afford to send your kids there.  (.) I would say there was more going on, going for them isn't there than 
*FRE:	Oh yes, yes. 
*NON:	than the old comprehensive schools. Some are better than others of course but er 
*FRE:	I think that a big advantage if you wanting to get in very large areas like London and Birmingham. I think that if the schools, I don't suppose that   (  ) kind of thing but erm, I mean the schools out in Surrey and all erm places like that. When you get down there   (  ) they're much   (.) much better than 
*NON:	Oh yes. I mean we have a local school, Hayes School which is a very good comprehensive 
*FRE:	Mm. All the comprehensives. 
*NON:	and everybody 
*FRE:	But I don't think parts of Croydon, south of Croydon, Birmingham   (  ) they're much better down there. 
*NON:	I mean people move in to Hayes specially so that their kids can go there. 
*FRE:	Yes.  (.) I think generally speaking you erm schools out in the country are better. 
*NON:	Oh yes. Mm 
*FRE:	Cos then you  (  )  
*NON:	It's O K if your headmasters that run the school change I mean schools tend to change with headmasters don't they? (.)  
*FRE:	Cos it'd be, I mean a big disadvantage to a lot of particular schools around this area is the number of erm Asian and 
*NON:	Yes. 
*FRE:	erm Indian. I mean, they, they probably don't speak English and they're at at a disadvantage to start off with. 
*NON:	Yes. 
*FRE:	Which again is holding the others back. 
*NON:	Yes, yes.  (.)  (  ) changing headmasters at his school and they had a terrible reputation one time. 
*FRE:	Did it? 
*NON:	  (  )  
*NON:	  (  )  Sorry. 
*FRE:	 (  ) your black rucksack? 
*NON:	My black  (  )  
*FRE:	The one that was in, in the other room? 
*NON:	Yeah. 
*FRE:	Well I put it in the hall 
*NON:	Yeah. 
*FRE:	behind the hall stand but mummy must have shifted it cos, shifted it with that er that bag of hers so I should ask mummy where it is. Cos it was, I put it behind the hall stand. 
*NON:	O K. 
*NON:	But they had a new headmaster oh he's just retired, he's been there   (.) been there since Lynn was there when   (.) since she was   (.) since the er she's twice that age so I mean he must have been there eighteen years but when he went there he's er  totally   (  ) the school from the word go   
*NON:	 No, I got, I need to get some stuff out of the red one. 
*NON:	and it changed out of all recognition. Now it's one of the, the best schools   (.) for miles around. 
*FRE:	Is he er   (.) is he due to retire or 
*NON:	Ye  yes he's just retired. 
*FRE:	He has just retired? 
*NON:	There's been a new headmaster for the last year I think so I don't know what he    (  )   
*NON:	 Bath now   (  )   
*NON:	What did you say? 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	Well you might find as he's got a good, good disciplined school he'll   (.) Unless of course he's of the opposite    (  )   
*NON:	 Well yes    (  )   
*NON:	  (  )  
*FRE:	have any discipline   (  ) do as they like. 
*NON:	Mm. All go to school in uniform and you know 
*FRE:	Mm. I think that they should actually. 
*NON:	Yes.  (.) Except the sixth form, they can

*NON:	Mm. But not even next year when he goes to school? 
*FRE:	I don't think so, no I'll ask him when he comes down. I don't think so. Think they did away with the green 
*NON:	Oh. 
*FRE:	the, the the green erm   (.) coats when they er, when they go up to the main school.

*NON:	But I thought there was a gas tap there you know? 
*NON:	Well we put carpet down and couldn't find any place  (  ) . 
*FRE:	I mean they don't take they only take a board up where they put it on to erm put it leading through and er where they bring it out.
