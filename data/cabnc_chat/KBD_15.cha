        It was M S F thing, we were with Margaret  about the  M S F. •220452_220826•
        And  said, oh, let's go and find a cup of coffee  but, have a bit of a walk and walk down to conference but we'll not walk down the prom •220914_221610•
*BAR:	Mm. •221610_221644•
*TER:	we'll walk down the road at the back  and we'd only just turned round the corner from the Claremont and we found this restaurant  and it was, it was an absolutely brilliant chef, really nice restaurant, really high quality  and it was  was  quite reasonable price, it wasn't cheap. •221644_223262•
*BAR:	Mm. •223272_223307•
*TER:	So, when we found this we thought ooh, this is alright! •223356_223666•
        You know, we'll  so we've been quite a few times since, but I cannot think of the name of it. •223666_224121•
        You see, Jim doesn't like, I mean, we'd go to Carriages probably  cos it's a  a proper Italian •224135_224805•
*BAR:	Yeah. •224822_224846•
*TER:	that absolutely reeks with garlic and  all the rest of it. •224929_225279•
        Well  that means Jim will pull a face! •225279_225508•
        Or he'll start going  •225517_225728•
*BAR:	Oh, this big international financier! •225728_225849•
*TER:	Oh! •225849_225942•
        No! •225942_225959•
        Not, I mean, is the, when it comes down to food  he's a traditionalist. •225959_226424•
        So we've always got to find somewhere to eat that's  •226451_226802•
*BAR:	You're gonna be pushed getting, you know, roast beef and Yorkshire in Brussels aren't you? •226803_227136•
*TER:	God knows! •227173_227206•
*BAR:	Steak and kidney pie! •227218_227294•
*TER:	You're joking! •227299_227354•
        Cos everybody sort of, just try to think, think of in Brussels. •227354_227593•
        Why they go, they go to er  a six course sort of have as much main course as you like. •227593_228371•
        It's a  a  a a really nice restaurant  but you can pick all your food raw  and they just, there's a chef cooking, and you just get one of these plates, you can have as many helpings as you want, they serve you a cold starter and a hot starter  but there's  a buffet that's about  half the size of our club  and one side of it it's all  fish on a wet fish slab, and steak, and veal, and chicken and  so there's every sort of meat you can think of, and you can pick a wooden platter full of it, so you go and give it the chef with this number that they give you  and then they come serve you with whatever you want. •228371_232318•
        And you can have as many helpings of whatever you want. •232328_232629•
        And the salad stuff  and fresh fruit and all that sort of thing, takes  about the full length of our bar up  you know, you, you couldn't think of a salad that isn't there. •232629_233785•
        But you can't, and there's, then there's loads of hot veg. •233796_234099•
*BAR:	Mm. •234131_234149•
*TER:	There's no vegetables you can't mention. •234213_234388•

*BAR:	Yeah. •235041_235062•

        The Labour Party came to  to use that quite a lot. •235495_235877•
        Because  they've got  big seating areas as well, where they put, sort of eight tables together and all your party can sit together. •235898_236785•
*BAR:	Mm. •236791_236809•
*TER:	When we were there  Stan  was with us and he'd  been a few times to Brussels  with the Labour Party and, and he said oh it's great! •236871_237742•
        Because  usually you go off to a restaurant and if there's twenty of you  you can't sit together can you? •237744_238336•
*BAR:	No. •238336_238344•
