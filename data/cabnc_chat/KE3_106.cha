*JAC:	I must admit I like to see that, because   (.) so many people, if a dog had to lose a leg they'd say put it to sleep, put it to sleep.
*TON:	Mm. (.) Yeah 
*JAC:	And   (.) why? (.) If you lost a leg they'd stick a false one on you or give you a set of wheels.
*TON:	Mm.Right.
*JAC:	So why kill it why kill a dog because it's gonna lose a leg.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	It's got   (.) well you've only got two.You lose yours, one of yours and it's a disaster.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	If a dog loses one, well it's still got three to get on with, you know?
*CHR:	Yeah. (        ) 
*JAC:	It's hardly a handicap at all to a dog.
*CHR:	It's happened to one dog and he learned to walk like a human   (        )  ((crisp packets rattling))
*JAC:	Mm.
*CHR:	He walked like a human. (        ) . And he spun right round and he   (        ) like that.And they said get up.And he rolls over and then he sort of put his legs up.I can't remember   (.) no he sort of I can't do it.
*JAC:	But to lose a leg for a dog is hardly a handicap at all.
*TON:	Mm.
*CHR:	Cos they've got three others.They just lose their balance occasionally.
*JAC:	Well that's why a dog that limps slightly   (.) very often there's practically nothing wrong with it.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	If it thinks it's gonna hurt it will limp.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) Yeah 
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*JAC:	Whereas people, if you've got a painful leg you've got to walk on it.Whereas a dog might have a slightly painful leg and it will limp like hell.
*TON:	Mm.Yeah.
*JAC:	Cos it doesn't have to use it. ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Oh no we've got some really hard numbers     (        )  (.)  (        ) french if I had a dictionary I could look it up but I haven't.
