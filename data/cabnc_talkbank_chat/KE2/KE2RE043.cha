*KE2PSUN:	Yeah Now I found that you see cos I passed my eleven plus and I lived in Hampshire and the grammar school was Hampshire Grammar School for Girls which was quite a long way away from where I lived and it would have entailed a bus and the train and I and there was only me that passed and I I did n't wan na do it So I went to a very good secondary school but I was in the A one stream right the way through and I was always within that top three of that A one stream and it gave me confidence and I really got on And I never regretted not going .  909535_932825
