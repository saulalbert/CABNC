@Comment:	conversation #32 (Tape 004205)
*CAR:	Lovely, very, very, good indeed, that, that is there now, sounds very good, just, erm, a few little things, would you try to give me more on the fifth finger, the E, the E flat, there, think of a crescendo  ((piano music)), to that, want that come out, then, then it will, erm, I'm almost frightened to put a crescendo in because it wasn't the, a big one.
*CAR:	No.
*CAR:	If I put that in, to remind you to bring that up.
*CAR:	Aha.
*CAR:	I thought this was most impressive, very, very good indeed, it   (.) it was, it sounded really very convincing, it did, worked beautifully, now, where, the only error as such, is this bar, you're making these much too long, you're making them almost crotchet length.
*CAR:	Mm.
*CAR:	But, so erm, just think there for a moment, one, two, one, two, and one, and two, and, you're going one and two and one and 
*CAR:	And 
*CAR:	So you're halving the tempo, but, it needs a slight roe that means just lead into it, so, ((piano music)), two and one, can do that, but you're doing  ((piano playing)), ((laugh)) , and it's instable for ever.
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) Right.
*CAR:	And then, you know, it, it, makes that sound strange, so just watch that, that, erm, what if we just pick it up around here, just for me to hear that and get that right, we ought to be fine, any  (        ) .
*CAR:	 ((cough))  ((piano music))
*CAR:	And one and two, that's it, got it, erm, the, better we just do to check that it's correct and   (        ) to remind you for rhythm, is listen to those, because those are exactly the same as those.
*CAR:	Yeah.
*CAR:	Just once again this time  (        ) .
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	Two and one and two and one and, now there you just make the crotchet a bit too short, erm, try until you get it into your system, which you will, just counting that, in, inside yourself.
*CAR:	Mhm.
*CAR:	And you'll find then that, that, that will fit, can you just adjust your  (        ) ?
*CAR:	This?
*CAR:	Yes.
*CAR:	Work out what fingers should be.
*CAR:	 ((piano music))F sharp.
*CAR:	 ((playing piano))
*CAR:	And one, two and   (        ) and, you've got it, yeah, yeah, do it once again, and try, the other thing, is try not to hold down   ((pressed key on piano))that D, as you play the C, it's not important, but, it's better if you don't.
