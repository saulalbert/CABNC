*RIC:	Oh. •_•
*TER:	to erm  where is it? •_•
        Near Arken where they cross the border  that's about two hundred miles  and then, you know, by the time they've gone through  er er, they'll sort of be well down into erm  sort of Stuttgart way I think that sort of area probably. •_•
*RIC:	Mm. •_•
*TER:	And there's service stations on the motorway you see where you can stop for breakfast. •_•
*RIC:	Mm mm. •_•
*TER:	And then erm  they'll have a couple of hours or an hour break there probably and then erm •_•
*RIC:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	they'll journey on to er erm  where's he going,Kittsbeile ? •_•
        So , they'll probably go down to Munich  and then drop down on the motorway from Munich •_•
*RIC:	Mhm. •_•
*TER:	erm  the corsair there, the motorway goes through  ah, what's the name of the place? •_•
        Wurley I think it is •_•

        So erm •_•
*RIC:	Mm. •_•
        Oh . •_•
*TER:	Either that or they go through to Salzburg  and then come off the motorway there. •_•
        I don't know which, well you know , when it's that sort of area it's , as you say I mean it's  from here it's nine hundred, at least nine hundred miles  you know it's about two hundred and fifty to Dover isn't it? •_•
*RIC:	Aha. •_•
*TER:	And then you've got about  you know, you got six hundred and, six to seven hundred miles the other side. •_•
*RIC:	Well that camper can cope with it. •_•
*TER:	I know. •_•
        You know I I sometimes wonder when you go by plane and you get all the  the hooha at the airport and you, you get fog delay and delay, get delayed here and delayed there  think why on earth you bother you go by train! •_•
        Go by plane! •_•
        But  when you go by coach you you realise why you go by plane, you know! •_•
*RIC:	That's right. •_•
*TER:	Cos we went to Winterlarken the year before last, was it the year before last? •_•
        No! •_•
        I don't know when we went on the coach  to Mannock Farm Camp Site  erm  you know, and it's a long old haul! •_•
*RIC:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*TER:	you know sleep in the, you sort of have a night's sleeping in the coach while it's travelling but  •_•
*RIC:	Yeah but  •_•
*TER:	it's , it's never the same you see. •_•
        It isn't until ah , the only time we did have a smashing journey, we went with erm  oh  what's, what's the name of a local firm from Plymouth? •_•
*RIC:	No. •_•
*TER:	No. •_•
        Traffens  •_•
*RIC:	 (        ) 
*TER:	We went with Traffens one year, the first year in fact we went with Traffens and that was super because  when we got to the other side  sort of, it was then about ten o'clock  he said well if you  if there's enough people want it we will transform your  transform your seats into bunks  and most people wanted  and  you were able to  push the seats  so one, two pairs of seats  one of the seats went up and the other went down  and you had four bunks •_•
*RIC:	My God! •_•
*TER:	flat  across two seats  two pairs of seats. •_•
        And you, you know, you used, you used anything as a pillow that you'd got •_•
*RIC:	Aha. •_•
*TER:	erm  and you were flat. •_•
        And I had a , you know, I mean you you were aware that you were in a coach and you'd you'd wake up occasionally and realise you , but by enlarge I had eight hours sleep! •_•
*RIC:	Oh! •_•
*TER:	And it was super! •_•
*RIC:	 ((laugh)) 
*TER:	And the fact that you lie down you you , you spread the weight you see  •_•
*RIC:	Yeah, that's right. •_•
*TER:	it's not all on your bottom  or on  •_•
*RIC:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	the lower part of your back  •_•
*RIC:	That's right, right. •_•
*TER:	and you can turn over one way or you can turn over the other way. •_•
*RIC:	Mm. •_•
*TER:	And it was really, it was very good! •_•
        But they haven't done that, you know, the next time we went they hadn't got that sort of seating arrangement. •_•
        I don't know why because that seems to me to be  a first rate way of travelling, you know! •_•
*RIC:	lay down, yeah! •_•
*TER:	I think it's super! •_•
        Anyway , d'you wanna use your hose I mean I'll put the car in the garage if you do. •_•
