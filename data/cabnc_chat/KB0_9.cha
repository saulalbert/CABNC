@Comment:	conversation #9 (Tape 029002)
*ALA:	Oh dear my batteries are going flat! (.) Oh no it's alright! (.) Erm
*MAR:	So what, are you trying it out for somebody are you?
*ALA:	No, er
*MAR:	We to , were you recording  (        ) ?
*ALA:	I've been doing, doing so.
*MAR:	You have? (.) Now, you won't   (        ) about the Wrexham  (        ) .
*ALA:	Er, yes.
*MAR:	Did you have, did you read those words?
*ALA:	Er   (.) yes, I just glanced through it.
*MAR:	Oh!
*ALA:	Well   (.) actually there's no decision yet from the church meeting
*MAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	so we've still got to
*MAR:	 (        ) .
*ALA:	Yes, but they could 
*MAR:	And they could 
*ALA:	sell it.
*MAR:	I mean, my favourite   (        ) but  (        ) .
*MAR:	Mm.
*MAR:	And it was a major problem of finance   (.) it seems to me   (        ) when you've two possible avenues left to take.
*MAR:	When you   (        ) I think it's   (.) yes.
*MAR:	One is   (.) getting a loan from the church
*MAR:	Mm.
*MAR:	and repaying it at   (.) five percent interest or whatever is a rate of 
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	fare. (.) And   (.) there's no guarantee they'll   (.) they'll lend it.
*ALA:	If they ask for money.
*MAR:	The other is to apply to come back    (        )  (.) that   (.) I   (.) the interest that I  (        ) . (.) I was told that o , over a year ago    (        )  (.) but I haven't found any yet!
*ALA:	I see!
*MAR:	I've got a lot of information about tru  (.) charitable trusts but all  (        ) ! (.) I can't see that any one of them which is   (.) you know, would have that as one of the things.
*ALA:	I see.
*MAR:	Now I haven't finished, but I mean I, it really is at the top of my mind,yo , you know it hasn't   (.) I haven't given it top priority.
*MAR:	Well you've got a lot of other things to think about I'd say.
*MAR:	Well all the other things have been   (        ) more urgent, so therefore, I haven't really pursued it to its limits.
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	So, you know if   (.) if you find there's a   (        ) position for   (        ) when they absolutely need help   (.) you know, phone me again or write to me again and tell me you've   (.) you've, you've set everything  (        ) .
*ALA:	Well keep in touch.
*MAR:	But, well I mean I   (.) it's a   (        ) so far, I really don't push.
*ALA:	I see.
*MAR:	I've got the names of lots of  (        ) 
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	I'll try to get started. (.) But, you know   (.) if you need some    (        )  (.) I can't   (        ) any of them a , as being willing to  (        ) .
*ALA:	Mm mm.
*MAR:	In the pipeline. (.) But there may something at the    (        )  (.) there might 
*MAR:	Oh there mi there might be! (.) I think might be   (        ) because it's a   (        ) the four churches toge together.
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	That's right, (        ) .
*MAR:	If it   (        ) need it   (.) to share the cost of the new one   (.) but once it goes on the 
*MAR:	Sa 
*MAR:	four churches
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	and not on the one. (.) and er, also   (        ) therefore   (.) you'll have the  (        ) , if you like
*ALA:	Yeah.
*MAR:	or  (        ) . (.) I wish some other churches would come and  (        ) .
*ALA:	Well we'll be stuck into finding a finance man   (.) er, to watch the cost over the  (        ) .
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) You need  (        ) ?
*ALA:	Yeah, I mean  (        ) .
*MAR:	You've gotta look at   (.) the same as  (        ) .
*ALA:	Have you got
*MAR:	Erm    (.)  (        ) in the personals
*ALA:	to me  (        ) .
*MAR:	and the personal situation now   (.) is that   (        ) economic climate    (        )  (.) get a house   (.) how many are talking here!
*ALA:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	sometimes from a  (        ) .
*MAR:	Like, you'd better    (        )  (.) can I get rid of these?
*ALA:	Please!
*MAR:	Would you be able stay with the one you've got?
*MAR:	Well the one we've got above our    (        )  (.) in fact, there's one next door to us going for sale at the moment   (.) and they're asking advertised prices    (        )  (.) else you'll be getting about fifty thousand on top   (.) that's ours. (.) It was a short    (        )  (.) she wants fifty thousand pound for  (        ) ! (.) And because   (.) that one   (.) even if we didn't rule out    (        )  (.) it says fifteen forty.
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	And it seems for the churches   (.) we'd then be looking up to point   (.) forty perc , fourteen percent   (.) for fifty thousand pounds.
*ALA:	A , actually   (.) John was suggesting   (.) that we might talk nicely to John's dad about the money they've got invested in the sale of their pro , their ground. (.) I don't know how far we'd get but er   (.) it's worth looking at.
*MAR:	The only thing is though, I mean, you see but   (.) I think the church itself   (.) and   (.) I would say the church as the group now
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	would be looking at that   (.) as a more meaningful   (.) contribution to  (        ) .
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	Well what else can you talk  (        ) ? (.) So to be able to    (        )  (.) the   (.) sweepstake    (        )  (.) in the past   (        ) another church and they could be, they could be   (        ) on the interest   (.) you know, the amount   (.) towards   (.) running costs such as this. (.) Well, to me running costs wouldn't be   (        ) and the cost of towards   (.) borrowing   (.) a house is the same way you know.
*MAR:	Well exactly!The point is that    (.)  (        ) looks very nice  (        ) .
*ALA:	Yeah.
*MAR:	You know, but I mean if the church cannot find    (.)  (        ) contributions it really can't  (        ) ! (.) Well you see  (        ) , like   (.) like   (.)  (        ) .
*ALA:	Exactly!Yes well   (.) erm   (.) we're still going to have to talk about it with the elders you see.
*MAR:	Sorry, what did you say?
*ALA:	We're still going to have to talk about with the e , with the 
*MAR:	With the 
*ALA:	joint elders group.
*MAR:	Yes, yes, yes, yes
*ALA:	Erm
*MAR:	Quite right!
*ALA:	which meets on Monday. (.) Er so   (.) I might be in touch with you after that.
*MAR:	Oh right. (.) But I mean even now you can   (.) you can read that thing out to me.
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	I mean, that, that was   (        ) you er    (.)  (        ) goals, you know. (.) No, no messing, I mean I did that    (.)  (        ) ages ago and I,i , it just arrived!I think I was already in  (        ) .
*ALA:	Did you have a good holiday by the way?
*MAR:	Lovely holiday, thank you.But I wa  (.) but I was there for a fortnight and when I came back   (.) I, you know it's   (.) preparing for Synod just takes all the time we have somehow and I
*ALA:	Oh yes.
*MAR:	I   (.) I was only off the plane just last week   (.) I'd better have a look at this   (        ) 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*MAR:	dear, dear, dear!
*ALA:	Just a mi , matter of interest where do you come from because on this   (.) dictionary thing I'm supposed to put down what people's local accent is?
*MAR:	Ah, that's good! (.) Only Oxford, no I'm, mine is in in   (.) inexplicable because I've lived in so many places and I pick up accents! (.) I was born in Lancashire, so that's 
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	the basis of it all. (.) I've had the roughest edges knocked off it when I went to University. (.) And the , but then I went to live in   (.) Northern Ireland so I've got a so  (.) picked up a fair bit of Northern Ireland.
*ALA:	Yes well, it does happen when,whe 
*MAR:	Cos it's a hybrid, it's an old 
*ALA:	It 
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	it does happen when you move around.
*MAR:	Yeah it does.
*ALA:	In   (.) I think it happened to me to some extent.
*MAR:	Well it does, if if   (.) if you pick up   (        ) accents, some people never change!
*ALA:	That's true.
*MAR:	 (        ) some people, doesn't matter where you go they never change! (.) But, if you are at all I mean yo , you, I think you pick up reflections.
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	You know, I haven't been consciously stru , striving to change my accent. (.) In fact, you know I'm consciously now not to become a Welsh accent   (.) because if I've got the Welsh accent added to it all it'll be horrendous!
*ALA:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	But er    (.)  (        ) 
*ALA:	Right.
*MAR:	I have  (        ) 
*MAR:	Yeah.
*MAR:	isn't it? (.)  (        ) 
*ALA:	Yes. (.) It's at least distinctive!
*MAR:	It is. (.) On the notice you sent out   (.) the other day for Monday's meeting
*MAR:	Yes.
*MAR:	I think you put a paragraph first   (.) that said maybe we will need to consider   (.) our recommendation
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	and the, of course, you went onto to number one the man's     (.)  (        )  (.) two er, group secretary   (        ) who draws it out   (.) I forgot what the other one was.
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	Maybe in some thing which   (        ) at the moment   (.) is that the be number one.
*ALA:	Er   (.) which wo , which one you mean, the
*MAR:	Well tha tha that number one be the question on recommendation.
*ALA:	I see!Oh yes!Well I was thinking that.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) But it really is, it might have got lost in the paragraph mighten it? (.) Cos when the   (        ) comes underneath.
*ALA:	I see what you mean.
*MAR:	It isn't being critical at all but   (.) on this position situation that might the first thing that we
*ALA:	Oh yes, I was assuming that   (.) erm   (.) a I do , I didn't really set it out as a formal agenda just as a
*MAR:	Just as a note 
*ALA:	a reminder, like.
*MAR:	Erm   (.) I don't know what the situation will be in the other churches.
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	And I must say between us at the moment   (.) there wasn't a strong feeling   (.) what it's all about.
*ALA:	Not a strong feeling in favour? (.) No?
*MAR:	No, I'm only saying   (        ) as prepared   (.) with 
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	 (        ) .
*ALA:	Well erm
*MAR:	I mean, this is nothing to do with a   (        ) don't worry that's   (.) we don't want them thinking that the house is the issue cos it isn't, alright? (.) The house   (.) what rate is  (        ) ?
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	Whether there are   (.) the   (        ) 
*ALA:	No I thi 
*MAR:	which   (.) erm   (.) we had an elders meeting on Thursday and between Sunday and Thursday   (.) various people have comments and people along
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	on Saturday or Sunday     (.)  (        )  (.) erm   (.) there was erm   (.) a tale at the elders meeting on su , subversion   (.) and overall feelings   (.) erm   (.) erm   (.) that we wouldn't  (        ) .
*ALA:	Oh! (.) That's a pity!
*MAR:	Yeah   (.) well that's     (.)  (        )  (.) erm, I mean, the only talking is between us at the moment it's just, you know, (        ) . (.) If, of course, on Monday   (.) that's a vote, a recommendation is taken
*ALA:	Mm 
*MAR:	you know   (.) we would accept a reco , whatever the   (.) Monday's meeting was.
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	We we wouldn't mean sticking out of the wood and saying no  (        ) .
*ALA:	Yeah but
*MAR:	In fact, report back just all about meeting and say
*ALA:	Bu , but o , on the other hand yo you've got to se  (.) you've to er   (.) give the information that you have about the feeling in the church!
*MAR:	Yes. (.) In fact we   (.) i it would   (        ) expressed interest   (.) it will be expressed a week on Monday.
*ALA:	Yes. (.) Erm   (.) I mean I   (.) I, I don't know, I mean i it's not not, it's not my business to even look 
*MAR:	Oh yes.
*ALA:	one way or the other! (.) I , it's simply my business tosortof   (.) help the works.
*MAR:	See, mm it   (.) that's true yes. (.) That if it's as well    (        )  (.) well before the meeting Monday because   (.) at the end of the day   (.) you know   (.) we, we gotta look at the matter going forward isn't it?
*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	You know    (        )  (.) is   (        ) going forward to a week on Sunday and then whatever else happens   (.) we're going through the process aren't we? (.) And having this all come on Monday thinking that everything is   (.) we gotta   (        ) to the church we're feeling   (.) well if we don't go through now, where do we go? (.)  (        ) 
*ALA:	Well I don't   (.) I don't think   (.) that should influence them too much. (.) I mean   (.) it   (.) one wants to get a settlement quickly
*MAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	but it's more important to get the right person than to do it 
*MAR:	Well cer 
*ALA:	quickly.
*MAR:	well certain things   (.) like John  there
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	a number of people   (.)  (        ) 
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	and then what's it amount to?If I use the word aggression.
*ALA:	Yes. (.) I mean they

*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	And people felt there was an aggressiveness   (.) a about him!
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	And in trying to bring these four churches together   (.) it would be a li  (.) you know, not  (        ) .
*ALA:	A lot of tact may be needed at times, yes.
*MAR:	And   (.) you could see them all so   (.) nervousness   (.) anxiety   (.) that I wasn't told about. (.) And unfortunately this 
*UNK:	 [shouting] First can we have you back in the church  [] !
*MAR:	we've had this problem in the past with John ! (.) And with   (        ) makes

*MAR:	you'd wanna make sure yo  (.) the right role of leadership is needed   (.) and er   (.) certainly this helps in that as well.
*ALA:	Even when. (.)  (        ) 
*MAR:	Er just     (.)  (        )  (.) more negative  (        ) . (.) Well that seems to be the mood  (        ) .
*ALA:	Well   (.) what the church meeting's got to decide 
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) the church meeting will have to! (.) It's the church meeting's   (.) final decision.
*ALA:	I mean even if, even i , even if the elders recommend positively   (.) if the church meeting goes against it, well that's it!
*MAR:	 (        ) . (.) But erm   (.) on the other hand we we've gotta try, as a group of elders to come together I 
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	must admit.
*ALA:	To see what goes.
*MAR:	Erm, some of us may go to   (        ) tomorrow   (.) and 
*ALA:	Mm. (.) That'd be a good idea, I think!
*MAR:	Perhaps in some way, yes.Erm   (.) I I feel by going to   (        ) cos   (.) sometimes they're more involved than   (        ) these days.
*ALA:	Than, than in talk with God 
*MAR:	Yep.
*ALA:	yes.
*MAR:	Well not, that isn't how it   (.) but

*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	And I go there every month.
*ALA:	Mm.
*MAR:	So, you know, I do feel quite involved in what they're doing and they're   (.) they will readily come and share with you.
*ALA:	Nice!
*MAR:	You know? (.) And we'll see, we'll see what goes. (.) And I, I thought it's where we've   (.) we could share the minutes together before Monday's meeting.

*ALA:	Yes.
*MAR:	adventure   (.) was probably enough   (.) that erm   (.) I would have flown a kite     (.)  ((laugh))  (.) and one or two things otherwise! (.) So I felt because the   (.) time was pushing, passing so much, and the  (        )
