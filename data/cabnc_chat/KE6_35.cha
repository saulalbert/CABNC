*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	and hopefully   (        ) But I said to him about   (.) Duttons Road   (.) and I said to him what I'll do is, I've gotta go to town tomorrow   (.) I'll er get some tapes   (.) and start taping
*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	and write a letter for Duttons Road, enclose one of the tapes   (.) and say where do I go from here? (.) I mean you know, I mean it was just impossible, I don't know what the hell's going on in there.There's two cars in the road, two in the drive this morning.Been there all night.Course they're all in bed aren't they?
*SAN:	Yeah. (.) Do you know bus fares go up Sunday?
*WEN:	Well I haven't been using the bus Sandra.
*SAN:	Twenty eight now   (.) it will be   (.) and thirty four from the hospital.
*WEN:	Ooh!Dear oh dear.
*SAN:	There was a notice and   (.) it was Monday   (.) and I said, you know, what was it?Oh, don't really know, they tend to go up sort of two
*WEN:	Well sometimes they went up one.Some while back.
*SAN:	Well yeah, I don't think any of them are going up one   (.) this time.
*WEN:	Well we've been walking, I mean   (.) we ain't been out this week.
*SAN:	So it was the chatty one this morning.He started chatting and there was nobody else on the bus and I said to him what are they?It's twenty eight.I said what's the hospital  (        ) ?He said thirty four.The Drove   (.) should be forty seven he said but it's an odd amount.He said   (.) they may, cos it's forty five at the moment
*WEN:	Yeah.
*SAN:	he said they may just go one to forty six he said or they may even go forty eight on that one   (.) to even it up. (        )  (.) 
*WEN:	Ah there's the continuation innit?
*SAN:	And he said thank goodness,h he said oh they got   (        ) and I said yeah   (.) I've got Monday and Tuesday off he said, it might have died down when I get back he said cos us drivers take all the stick.
*WEN:	I suppose that's perfectly true.
*SAN:	Which   [laughing] yeah I said well   [] there's nobody else, I said they get on and you say I want more money   (.) but he said it's a nightmare.
*WEN:	Gotta be.Gotta be innit?
*SAN:	But I mean the hospital, when you think
*WEN:	Yeah but people don't realize do they?
*SAN:	that need, you know   (.) if you're, unless you live sort of here   (.) you're going up for appointments, doctors, whatever 
*WEN:	Well that's what I mean.
*SAN:	and you don't feel like walking.You get on, I mean if it's a mum and a kid or   (.)  (        ) 
*WEN:	Oh well we've been walking when we've gone into town   (.) but I mean   (.) just between you and me   (.) but when I got home Bev said    (        )  (.) pop into town I've got a parcel to post and I said well I can't   (.) I said because according to Des   (.) well nothing happened
*SAN:	It didn't.
*WEN:	and she got a bit angry and I, I get a bit angry so I said, because I said well what the hell is going on?Now
*SAN:	He should of kept his mouth shut.I mean if she's gone home 
*WEN:	He should.
*SAN:	and said ooh they didn't half seem interested, I reckon they might   (.) then he comes in and says 
*WEN:	Well I'm not gonna say a word to him Sandra, I'm not 
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	gonna say a word, I'm gonna wait on   (.) and see if he says anything   (.) and er she got 
*SAN:	Cos surely I mean if they'd of said   (.) we are going to
*WEN:	Mm  (.) 
*SAN:	but they didn't  (        ) 
*WEN:	Yeah.Well I think it's a just a mess about place don't you?I mean she's in and out of town all the time like you said   (.) here there and bloody everywhere.
*SAN:	Perhaps they had something else in mind, perhaps it's her.Perhaps she was thinking oh yes it's   (        ) 
*WEN:	Well why didn't he say that yesterday then? (.) I mean it
*SAN:	Or is he twisting what she says.
*WEN:	Well   (.) but yesterday, when he said that, you'd of thought
*SAN:	Well I did
*WEN:	well mind you, the only thing is he said did she get a phone call yesterday and she never   (.) so he might have   (        ) he expected her to have had one.Would you not think?
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Yeah.But she's getting cross now cos I said to her look   (.) you've gotta think about this seriously.You going out there, you stop all your Income Support and it co turns out to be a bloody week or something   (.) well alright you turn round and get back on Income Support but it's not simple is it?
*SAN:	Is she regis she's registered with quite a few agencies hasn't she?
*WEN:	All of them yeah.

*WEN:	Yeah.
*SAN:	when they've just had a call in, to start on Monday.
*WEN:	Yeah. (.) 
*SAN:	You know, so it's her
*WEN:	But I, I mean I'm 
*SAN:	 (        ) the possibility that she could get some
*WEN:	Yeah.Well I'm not very happy about this situation at all, I have to say.Alright so he should keep his mouth shut, this I agree with   (.) but at the same time   (        ) she leaves 
*SAN:	Well so somebody ain't 
*WEN:	tomorrow.
*SAN:	Yeah somebody ain't telling the truth are they?
*WEN:	No.So it's up to her.I said to her well it's up to you what you do, but I said er I, I don't like the situation.I mean she sat watching Neighbours all that day.He did say to me right in the very beginning basically it's answering the telephone.And then er that
*SAN:	Well if that's case she can go and work for one of the taxi companies and sit in their office and ans 
*WEN:	That's right.

*DOR:	Ooh
*WEN:	Anyway I'm not saying a word to him, I'm gonna wait and see if and what he says   (.) because I say it's making me angry.And that's the second, third time he's said to me

*SAN:	Oh    (.)  (        ) the first payments are due  (        ) .But we started late last year didn't we?
*WEN:	Thought we started in June, but I got one more to pay.So I got   (        ) I got Friday   (.) to pay and that's ten months.
*SAN:	I  (.)  (        ) of that and I said to to him is that the last one?He said well I ain't heard nothing but   (        ) 
*WEN:	Well it is for me.Definitely.I've got one more  (        ) 
*SAN:	That's February's payment.
*WEN:	That'll be February's payment yeah     (.)  (        )  (.) No 
*SAN:	 (        ) the month so you'll have to   (        ) 
*WEN:	No 
*SAN:	March. (.) 
*WEN:	It would be March because we started late didn't we?Do you remember?
*SAN:	Cos normally normally you finish in February 
*WEN:	Yeah well normally I would of been finished wouldn't I?
*SAN:	and we used to have March
*WEN:	I pay it at the end of the previous month so it's due on the   (        ) twenty eighth, twenty ninth 
*SAN:	We used to start paying the rates in May.
*WEN:	Yeah we did   (.) but I had a feeling   (.) we were late   (.) last year 
*SAN:	So I should think that's   (.) but I reckon we must   (.) cos the government changed it, it knocked hundred and forty quid off didn't they?
*WEN:	Yeah.No I, I, but I'm sure I've got one more to pay but it'll be the fifteenth of March that'll be due.
*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	Cos I do it, the day he gets paid I pay all the bills
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	and that'll be for the next month   (        ) 
*SAN:	But I said to   (        ) I said well you might get a free month but I said or you    (.)  (        ) in March and then Ap  (.) supposedly April starts again.
*WEN:	Well that depends when they start again dunnit?
*SAN:	Unless they do it, less the banker's orders go   (.) start 
*WEN:	Yeah.
*SAN:	in May.
*WEN:	Don't know Sandra.But I'm 
*SAN:	It was just a bit in The Echo cos they're all about here and 
*WEN:	sure I've got one more to pay.
*SAN:	Eastleigh is quite high again.That's nearly three hundred.
*WEN:	So's Welwyn innit?
*SAN:	Welwyn's over three hundred.
*WEN:	Yeah.I saw that on the   (.) well proposed   (        ) 
*SAN:	Yeah.Cos Annette paid a lot when she was then at Chandler's Ford   (        ) 
*WEN:	Yeah 
*SAN:	very high one.
*WEN:	Ah.
*SAN:	Thanks Gloria. (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	Mind you Marguerite's was over the three hundred last year when she   (        ) 
*WEN:	And where was that? (.) 
*SAN:	Er   (.) it's funny up round there cos there's about three different councils well although her address is Hampshire
*WEN:	Yeah
*SAN:	the postcode   (.) is Guildford   (.) and you've got Aldershot or there's   (        ) and there's another one that is   (.) three different cou  (        ) another one 
*WEN:	 ((cough)) Mm.
*SAN:	But it was one, one of them anyway and hers was over three hundred so   (        ) save a bit.
*WEN:	Mm. (.) 
*SAN:	But once again they haven't worked hers out, I mean she told them she was down here in January   (.) and she still hasn't had a bill yet for the end of this year.
*WEN:	Well all you can do is tell them, I mean you're within the law then, it's up to them innit?You know?
*SAN:	 (        ) twenty one days don't you, when you move to no she notified the one she'd left.She said I'm not paying any more up there, I'm moving   (        ) 
*WEN:	 ((cough)) 
*SAN:	and notified   (        ) 
*DOR:	I mean they all ought to be geared up for all this for Christ's sake.
*WEN:	Mm.
*DOR:	It must be happening every day of the damned week.
*SAN:	Yeah.They take so long to sort it.
*WEN:	But I mean it's like Hugh, they said he hadn't registered or something wasn't it?That's what they said.But  (        ) , (        ) said to me one day   (        ) erm  (.) 
*SAN:	Yeah but he wasn't paying it before was he?
*WEN:	He hadn't registered, that's what I was told.
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	So when the bit of paper came   (.) they just ignore it   (        ) 
*SAN:	They said he 
*DOR:	Well   (        ) 
*SAN:	you, you haven't paid when he was out at   (        ) cos you have to notify them that you're moving
*WEN:	Mm
*SAN:	so one council's got a bit of paper and it ties up with the other one when you come here   (.) but if you don't, if you haven't paid before you couldn't tell them you were leaving 
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	or if he suddenly says here   (.) I'm here
*WEN:	Mm.
*SAN:	well then the next question is where have you come from?
*DOR:	Mm that's, that's right yeah.
*WEN:	Yeah but he hadn't registered, that's what   (.) cos I said to   (        ) well I don't really know this sort of thing I said, (        ) said here, that's first I knew.I said now there's three more of us that know that he's not paying poll tax
*DOR:	Mm.
*WEN:	then she said yeah he told me all about it, she said he hadn't registered.And I said well if, if you're gonna do this sort of thing you keep your bloody gob shut. (.) Don't you?
*DOR:	Mm.
*WEN:	Cos there's all of us that know now, she knows.
*DOR:	Good job he didn't tell me.Not that I could do anything but I wouldn't   (        ) 
*SAN:	But he didn't register 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	When they move into that new house though, cos I mean the council are aware that the new   (        ) 
*DOR:	Yeah.Well you would think so Sandra
*SAN:	and services to be connected   (        ) 
*DOR:	but I mean when you have a erm
*SAN:	You know the builders might even say we've sold these two.
*DOR:	when they don't have erm, when you have your election form and that and you send it in,do don't they come round if you haven't sent it back, or do they just, they used to didn't they?
*SAN:	No.They don't check up. (        ) 
*DOR:	Well I, I know something I erm, what was it then, what  (        ) ?Perhaps it was the erm 
*SAN:	sign those papers because they thought there was a tie-up
*DOR:	 ((cough)) perhaps it was when we had the census paper 
*SAN:	Loads of people 
*DOR:	then was it?
*SAN:	Census paper had to be 
*DOR:	Oh 
*SAN:	done, yeah.
*DOR:	Cos they came round then.Why can't, if they don't get things back, why don't they come round?
*WEN:	They can't cos I don't think there's enough   (        ) 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*WEN:	in this country.What I said, if it was like 
*UNK:	 (        ) enough people 
*WEN:	No!If it was like Germany where everything is, is regimented, whatever word you wanna use   (.) whether you agree with this or whether you don't, everybody in Germany pays everything that they should.
*UNK:	Mm.
*WEN:	Now, if you agree
*DOR:	Well I suppose that is it, you see in this they don't believe in   (        ) believe more in freedom don't they? (        ) 
*WEN:	Oh yeah 
*UNK:	Hiya!
*SAN:	They've blocked the idea of I D cards haven't they cos  (        ) 
*WEN:	Mm.Yeah.Well you see 
*DOR:	Like we had in the war, we had an
*WEN:	Yeah.
*DOR:	identity card.
*WEN:	But you see you can say it's the big brother and all this rubbish, but the fact remains that we three are paying the poll tax and he is not.
*SAN:	Mm.This is it.
*WEN:	This is how it ends up  (        ) .I mean everything is, is   (.) well, regimented, I can't think of a better word   (        ) 
*SAN:	 (        ) Germany they do it with T V licences 
*DOR:	 ((cough)) 
*WEN:	Yeah
*SAN:	 (        ) when he went in to hire   (.) or buy a television, they 
*WEN:	Yes they do.Yeah.
*SAN:	had to notify the authorities that so and so has signed up for one. (.) So perhaps the house  (        ) 
*WEN:	Mm.
*SAN:	Well I don't know but, but if they   (        ) up there 
*DOR:	 (        )  ((cough)) 
*SAN:	and bought a house   (.) well then the next question is well where have you come from?
*WEN:	Well of course and this is   (.) don't you feel whether it's   (        ) 
*SAN:	So I mean   (        ) 
*WEN:	Yeah!So you and I and Doreen 
*DOR:	 (        ) let everybody come here don't we?I mean to say    (.)  (        ) law in other countries but they're always pleased to come here and take all our what's it aren't they?
*WEN:	This is it! (        ) immigration   (        ) to stop.
*DOR:	I mean all the Scottish and the Welsh, [laughing] I always remember when   [] when erm   (.) when the first houses, when we lived, when I lived with me mother, and in that house we lived in was a big estate   (.) erm near us and erm   (.) ever such a lot of Welsh people lived there   (.) and, I don't know who it was, somebody wanted a place, couldn't get anywhere   (.) and my mother went up there with      (        )  [laughing]  (        )  [] you let all the Welsh people come here he s she said they run us down   (        ) and that was years and years ago she said, nearly everybody on that estate's Welsh   (        ) ourselves.
*WEN:	 (        ) with Dennis and Marge we'd been out with Dennis and Marge you know, a while back, and they're both Scottish and they run this country down to the
*SAN:	I know.
*WEN:	and he's, he's   (        ) working in there! (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	up until now, but, well   (        ) are different now   (.) this is the last place he stopped, he would walk down the road if he heard of a job for five pound more
*DOR:	Mm.
*WEN:	and
