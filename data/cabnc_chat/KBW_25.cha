        I think they're just a bit shortstaffed because  the girl that's usually in there hasn't been in there for weeks, Josie. •396492_402752•
        They've had the girl that's normally in there on a Saturday  during the week. •402752_413502•
        Perhaps she's ill. •413502_421232•

        The lady that was in there today  not Rosie the one that does the stories, she's always there  well, when she's there. •439492_446982•
        The other lady, Josie, she's normally  in there. •447032_449772•
        But she hasn't been there for a few weeks now so I think she might be ill. •449772_453772•
        Or on holiday or something. •453782_455122•
        No she can't be on holiday all that length of time. •455122_458222•

*DOR:	Well I suppose she does go on a Saturday as well. •466432_468782•
