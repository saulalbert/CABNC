@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 055402)
*GIL:	 ((sigh))  (.) I'm really, really, really changed dramatically from not eating very much to scoffing my face at every single available opportunity.
*JEM:	Really?
*GIL:	Mm.
*JEM:	I'm alright  (        ) 
*GIL:	It might just be today though. (.) Can I have a light? (.)  [singing] left it all    (        )  [] Do you still wanna go to the pub later?
*JEM:	I think, yeah, (        )  (.) 
*GIL:	Twenty to nine now, shall we just go for last orders or something? (.) Go about ten or something. (.) Yeah Judy seems to be finding her job very boring actually. (.)  [singing]  (        )  [] . Apparently she's just pumping in er   (.) like addresses and stuff into a computer.They're graduates. ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	 (        ) quite good today actually, we've got erm Pat   (.) who is like erm   (.) who is, I think she's like the personnel in charge of I know that she's in charge of personnel there
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	she's quite good and she said well you're intelligent, you can do this for me and she had me doing this like   (        ) phone calls ringing people up and
*GIL:	Mm.
*JEM:	 (        ) and
*GIL:	Brilliant.
*JEM:	And I, it was good, I was actually   (        )  (.) 
*GIL:	Actually recognized.
*JEM:	that I did have a brain and I was capable of doing things even though it was 
*GIL:	Yeah. (        ) 
*JEM:	very, anyone could do it, you know
*GIL:	Well thing is that I mean a lot of these jobs, I mean er yeah   (.) they recognize that, I mean a lot of them   (.) yo they think you're as thick as shit and treat you like you're as thick as shit just because you're doing a thick as shit job   (.) but you know they can't necessarily give you more
*JEM:	Yeah I   (        ) 
*GIL:	more er  (.) 
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	they can't necessarily give you more er   (.) erm    (.)  [laughing] don't suppose you want to get me a cloth do you  [] ? (.) More erm responsibility cos you have to be trained for it.Or know what you're talking about on the phone maybe. (.) Lovely, thank you sweetheart.Ah! ((laugh))  (.) 
*JEM:	 (        ) the fact that she's, she's intelligent as well erm she, you know, she's gonna s she knew that I didn't know what I was talking about so she said right you look,yo you look er you, you ask them about this, this, this and this and they might say this to you, so I knew what, if they asked me, I knew what I was talking about rather than 
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	being completely lost. (.) 
*GIL:	Mm. (.)  [singing] Yes she's gone, gone, gone   [] 
*JEM:	The only thing is my back has started to go.
*GIL:	Why?Slouching around?
*JEM:	Sitting at a desk.It really is hurting a lot. (.) Never mind. (.) 
*GIL:	So how much money will you get for the three days' work you've done?
*JEM:	Erm   (.) I'm not sure really.Wait and see.
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	 (        ) going to cash my giro today as well you can only cash it at one of your local   (        ) 
*GIL:	How much is it?
*JEM:	Sixty three quid. (.) But that's for two weeks.
*GIL:	Oh yeah, yeah I suppose so.
*JEM:	Cos it comes in, it seems a lot cos it always comes in one big lump.
*GIL:	Did you sort out Housing Benefit ever?
*JEM:	I sent it off but I haven't had anything back.I sent my rent book off as proof of the fact that I was   (.) of what the rent was
*GIL:	Cos you might get a big fat juicy cheque for that.
*JEM:	The thing is, I was thinking right, is it'll probably happen when I'm, if   (        ) come through, it'll probably happen while I'm away.
*GIL:	Yeah but what you could do, Nancy will be really responsible about things like that, you can say to her if a big fat Housing Benefit cheque comes for me cash it and put it in my bank.
*JEM:	But will she be able to do that?Won't I have to countersign it or something first?
*GIL:	No. (.) 
*JEM:	Yeah but I think on the back of the   (        ) giro there's a thing where you have to countersign it saying I authorize so and so
*GIL:	Mm. (.) Get her to forge it. (.) They won't ask for any, any   (.) do you know did you, were you there when Darrel was talking about that woman in the Post Office?Cos I w he was, he was in the Post Office one day and he saw this old woman and she'd just cashed all her giros and this bloke just nicked it   (.) in the Post Office.Just grabbed her handbag and ran off with it. (.) Sort of stood there watching her cash the giros and then nicked her money. (.) An old woman.I mean she's probably not got any money.
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	I think that's outrageous. (.) Well I don't mind, well I mean this is a horrible thing to say but I don't necessarily mind people robbing from the rich   (.) but when it's poor people robbing from the poor, it's a really wank off, really wanky thing to do, you know, I just think it's disgusting. (.) 
*JEM:	Well you can understand it when somebody poor robs someone who's rich, but when someone who's poor robs someone else who's poor it's just  (.) 
*GIL:	I've written Darrel a letter you know and er
*JEM:	Have you posted it?
*GIL:	No it's down there, and in it   (.) er I wrote it last night actually when I was feeling pretty fucked off so it's probably a bit out of order but I wrote to him and said erm   (.) tt Josh has been round this evening asking questions about what's happened with his money   (.) erm   (.) and I think you're really out of order. (.) 
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Thing is that he's in er he's in such a pickle, he's doing what   (.) I can understand him doing it cos I'd do it, he's kind of just putting it off   (.) having to sort it out. (.) But I said to him look Josh isn't exactly well off at the moment, he needs the money or   (.) what he bought so   (.)  ((sigh)) 
*JEM:	 (        ) cos I mean I get    (.)  (        ) er talked about it and I know about it and that kind of thing and I   (        ) that Darrel  (        ) 
*GIL:	I'm not saying anything because it's none of my business as far as I'm concerned
*JEM:	No.
*GIL:	it's between them.
*JEM:	Yeah. (        ) 
*GIL:	No. (.) 
*JEM:	I mean Josh is alright, I mean Josh will understand, if Darrel said to him look, this is the situation, Josh would understand   (.) to a certain extent.
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	I'd quite like to know how much   (.) like how,wheth what Darrel actually ran away from, I mean he owes so many people money.
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	Well not,n actually that's not necessarily true, he owes his land he owed his landlord loads of money, I'm not sure whether he actually got round to paying him off. ((sniff))  (.) What would you feel like listening to? (.) 
*JEM:	Erm  (.) 
*GIL:	Something in the same vein?
*JEM:	Yeah. (.) 
*GIL:	I know what I feel like listening to, it's just whether or not I can find it. (.) I quite lis like   (        ) Tapestry. (.) Carole King.
*JEM:	Yeah. (.) 
*GIL:	Mm it's a case of remembering what it's on the side o aha! (.) Have you done that, I, I saw a tape in your room the other day, erm   (.) lovingly compiled in Berkshire    (.)  ((laugh)) it was like a   (.) it was like a tape in a box like 
*JEM:	That's Josh's.
*GIL:	Oh what, who taped him that?
*JEM:	Erm oh I dunno, a friend of his. (.) Erm Martin   (        ) 
*GIL:	What sort of music is it?Oh really?He's the one that got busted at the  ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	erm   (.) it's, it's a kind of   (.) dancey kind of   (.) hate the word but raveish type music but a bit mellower.
*GIL:	Mm. (.) Bit like that System Seven tape? (.) Of Simon's.
*JEM:	Yes, yeah.Oh did you, you recorded that did you?
*GIL:	Mm. (.) It's good actually, very good. (.) I really like it. (.) 
*JEM:	Yeah.I'm, I'm gonna go up and see him before we go. (.) 
*GIL:	Simon?
*JEM:	Mm.
*GIL:	I am wondering actually what I should do about Helen.See now I, I would like to speak to her to check she's alright.But in doing so I'd be telling her that I knew that it had happened and therefore that Simon had talked to me. (.) Or that I would have to say oh Simon told me, and I don't think that is a very good thing to do really. (.) Cos she'd ask me how I'd know.It wouldn't be a case of oh Si Helen I've heard on the grapevine   (.) would it? (.) Tell you who I might phone up in a minute  ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	Yeah?
*GIL:	Vanessa. (.) And not 
*JEM:	Vanessa and Dangerous?
*GIL:	 [laughing] And Dangerous yeah  [] .And not tell her that I know and wait for her to tell me.
*JEM:	That   (.) what are, are they, what are the, the you know
*GIL:	 [laughing] They're fucking engaged   []  (.) 
*JEM:	Oh she didn't!What   (        ) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) That's what I mean.But if she says something to me about it   (.) I mean if she says something to me about it I'm not gonna act surprised I'll say oh yeah I've heard. (.) 
*JEM:	Who told you?
*GIL:	Liz. (.) What should I s er what should, would you be honest? (.) I mean I'm not gonna say look I hate Dangerous, I think he's an absolute wanker and how can you marry someone who's
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	uses the nickname Dangerous for fuck's sake.
*JEM:	cos you could, I mean if if she asked you about it, you know, you could just say well   (.) honestly I'm quite, I didn't think you were the kind of person who'd go for   (.) I know, I know that   (.) thing is I mean I can see, I can see that she's going for him because  (.) 
*GIL:	What I might actually do is say well I re if she does actually a I mean what she'll probably do is say   (.) oh have you heard about me and Dangerous, and I'll say yes.And she'll say   (.) and that's all I'll say.And I'll say yeah, yeah I've heard. (.) And then if she says something like well what do you think I might just say well   (.) I haven't really talked to you very much about the way that you feel about Dangerous so I don't really know   (.) erm   (.) Dangerous, what a fucking stupid name!And then if she says well   (.) and, and then I might say but I just would imagine that you'd have a lot more to do with your life before you thought about settling down and getting engaged to someone.
*JEM:	And also someone like him because I mean, I mean er obviously he, he seemed like a, I mean I'm sure he's a nice guy   (.) er I mean when it comes down to it he probably is a nice guy, he's probably nice to her but it's just the fact that he is so restricted in his views and  (.) 
*GIL:	It's also the fact that I know for a fact, I know for a fact that she's very frightened of his temper when it happens.I know she is.Cos she's talked to me about it.I mean there's been a couple of times that he's really lost his temper with her and erm   (.) and, and really flown off the handle, badly.And I reckon that he's the sort of person who would turn into someone that would hit someo hit his   (.) his woman, because he takes her for granted enough as it is, and that, I reckon that's how wife battering starts because the husband starts taking the woman for granted so much
*JEM:	Mm.
*GIL:	that, then starts taking their anger out on her
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	and, and   (.) if she's already scared of his temper and they've not even   (.) lived together, well they have lived together for quite a while actually   (.) so I mean it's not like they don't know each other but   (.) once they're married and they've been married for a couple of years I reckon, and he starts thinking of her more as a possession sort of thing   (.) I can, I can really imagine 
*JEM:	I can just imagine 
*GIL:	him starting hitting her.
*JEM:	I can imagine him being one of these, these, these er husbands who just want, who want, who will want to go out with the lads   (.) on his night out and will get, you know, he's a, he's ste I can imagine him being one of these stereotypical husbands who goes out  (        ) , gets pissed, comes back  (        ) , who wants the dinner on the table and
*GIL:	Mm.I can imagine it going in that dir yeah that way.It won't be like it for a couple of years. (.) But he's not the sort of person that'll say ah   (.) yeah we've been doing this for a little while, why don't we just take off and go somewhere and fuck it, fuck it, let's just go and do something together   (.) he's the sort of person that they would settle down into this safe little life and, which wouldn't actually be that safe for Vanessa, it'd be very   (.) very   (.) you know, much what Dangerous wants to do.But I, I can understand why she'd want to marry, why she'd want to do that, cos she hasn't ha well had an awful lot of   (.) brilliant times in her life since she left Nigeria.Nigeria was what kept her alive.She hated living in England. (.) But I don't understand why she hasn't just earned the money and gone off somewhere.
*JEM:	Yeah but they're gonna, it's such a hard thing to do.I mean 
*GIL:	Especially by yourself, she doesn't know anyone she could do it with.
*JEM:	Yeah and, and if you could, I mean the thing is, if you're, if er, if we didn't have each other to go off with   (.) erm it would have made everything for us a lot different, I mean okay we're lucky we're in a situation where we do know a lot of people who are, who are like- minded
*GIL:	Mm.
*JEM:	and we could maybe find someone else to go off and do it with
*GIL:	Though it would be a case of finding someone else to go off with and not just sort of like, I mean we mentioned it years ago.
*JEM:	Well I remember when we first met we wanted to go and do a dissertation together didn't we?
*GIL:	 [laughing] Yeah!Oh can you remember   [] walking around the streets of France   (.) saying yeah let's go and do our dissertation somewhere.
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	Funny isn't it how we meet people, how you can know them for ages then you just sort of talk to them, or once you start talking to them you realize that you've got
*GIL:	An awful lot in common, yeah.
*JEM:	 (        ) in common.So much in common.
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	You know I'm, in some ways you know I'm so glad I've never had like   (.) well before you know it used to bother me that I'd never had a long-term relationship and that  (.) 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	erm   (.) because it's something other people have and now, now I'm quite happy with myself and   (.) feel a lot more sure about the way I think and what I want
*GIL:	Mm.
*JEM:	erm it doesn't bother me in the slightest because I know that   (.) I would prefer maybe to be on my own   (.) than to be   (        ) restricted by someone.
*GIL:	Yeah because the other thing is that although   (.) erm   (.) you might have all these sort of high flying ideas about what you wanna do and you don't actually feel tied down by a relationship, actually   (.) you do live your life thinking well   (.) can't really do that because I wanna be with him.
*JEM:	Mm. (.) 
*GIL:	It's just a different choice. (.) You might not necessarily feel stuck in it, but it does make you stick around.
*JEM:	You can get, you get yeah you can get tied into it without realizing it.
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) Yeah definitely.It just makes leaving that much harder.
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	It makes   (        ) like doing anything that much harder.
*JEM:	Yeah. (.) 
*GIL:	Definitely. ((sniff))  (.) Mm. (.)  [laughing] What  [] ? (.) 
*JEM:	No I was just worrying that I always thought that I would never ever like   (.) come across anyone who I thought that I can even vaguely click with but I just realized that I can   (.) and it's just quite a nice feeling. (.) 
*GIL:	Have you er have you spoken to Pete yet?
*JEM:	No I've been thinking about that actually, I must  (.) 
*GIL:	 [laughing] You've been saying it for so long  [] .
*JEM:	Well I know, I b I, I was thinking before I'll wr I, I should write to him but now I, I'm   (.) I'm getting towards the stage where I want to write to him.
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	Cos you can't just write to someone, you have to want to write to them really.
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	Cos I'm thinking about it now, I mean   (.) it was totally my fault, it was, cos I wanted a relationship   (        ) he seemed, he seemed
*GIL:	Alright.
*JEM:	he seemed like, he, he, I looked at him, right, and I looked at everything about him and I thought   (.) that is the kind of guy I want, which is true, but it wasn't the guy. (.) 
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	And he never, we never really   (.) we never, we never discussed things, you know, we talked, we never discussed things really.
*GIL:	Mm.
*JEM:	I never felt like   (.) I never felt animated talking to him, you know if you talk to someone you get really, you really get animated and   (        ) 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	we always, we always get like, you know, a buzz off it or whatever but 
*GIL:	Oh you do get a total buzz off it 
*JEM:	Yeah 
*GIL:	I reckon.Especially if it, especially if it's someone that you're snogging   (.) as well. (.) I do love this tape, I really love it.Janet gave it to Frank for Christmas. (.) Ha! ((whistling))  (.)  [singing] make it   (.) and I just can't take it  [] 
*JEM:	No I'm so, I'm so lucky I've met the people I've met, you know, so lucky. (.) I really am.
*GIL:	Yeah, I often think that actually.
*JEM:	I really am realizing it now.And if I hadn't met the people I've met, I think I'd've been a very frustrated person   (.) cos erm, even though you can think of something,un unless, if you have other people you can go, if you say to somebody you could say, oh God, you know let's do this and this and this, or I think, really think this or this and someone else goes   (.) yes I do 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	as well, I agree with you 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	you're like   (.) I am right, even though you know you are it's like reinforcing your ideas.
*GIL:	Also it's kind of er   (.) even if you er sort of different people don't, I mean a lot of people don't discuss as much as we do. (.) I've really, really, really realized that.Most people don't actually   (.) go into things as deeply as we do.We've er oh it's, it's all to do with this sort of special thing that we found.
*JEM:	It is, it is true though.
*GIL:	Definitely.I don't, I don't know anybody   (.) that I, I've   (.) I mean I've never seen a group, I mean you see it on films every   [laughing] now and then you know  [] , a group of people that really, really spark one another off, like in The Big Chill and all the things like that   (.) but erm   (.) I've never seen it before.Not, not to the extent of what we've got. (.) Not as permanent.
*JEM:	My brother actually, Michael has been very good   (.) he still sees erm    (.)  (        ) cos he's always friends with    (        )  (.) and they're really good friends.I mean it's not, it's not the same kind of thing that we've got, it's a different kind of relationship cos he's a different kind of person
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	but erm it's good that he kept up with everyone, they are really good friends and he can really rely on them, they're all really decent
*GIL:	Mm.
*JEM:	really decent people, all, all decent blokes. (.) 
*GIL:	That's a really lovely jumper, is it new?
*JEM:	Erm
*GIL:	Have I seen it before? (.) I don't think I have.
*JEM:	I got it in the summer   (.) erm but then for some reason I decided I didn't like it.I it's nice but it's a bit, it's a bit erm impractical, it looks, it look it's not as thick as it looks, (        ) 
*GIL:	Oh really?
*JEM:	I mean
*GIL:	It looks very thick.
*JEM:	Well feel it, it's not. (.) 
*GIL:	Oh it's cos it's this new velvety stuff isn't it?
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	 [laughing] Oh this new velvety stuff  [] . (.) 
*JEM:	 (        ) talking about things and things like   (        ) everything from   (        ) the universe erm
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	 [laughing] we, because we covered it, and er  [] 
*GIL:	He's fucking mad, Simon, he always makes people think and talk about these mad things that they probably wouldn't talk about that often.
*JEM:	Yeah.He's fucking excellent, he sparked me off    (        )  (.) erm   (.) shit what was I saying? (        ) 
*GIL:	Oh I don't know, I can't really remember.
*JEM:	Rewind the tape. [laughing] Rewind the tape   ((laugh)) rewind the tape, let me hear it   ((laugh)) I'll remember  []
