*STU:	No.No it doesn't 
*ANN:	Though it doesn't make a noise cos I was doing it wrong.
*STU:	Yes.It's going slowly now.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) Yeah.
*STU:	Going much more slowly now as it records more   (.) conver conversations.
*ANN:	That's it. (.) Mm   (.) Don't stop talking now. (        ) silly. ((laugh))  (.) It's all gonna go quiet now isn't it?Nobody else'll say anything. (.) 
*STU:	 (        ) at all.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) That's ridiculous! [laughing] You gotta  [] 
*STU:	 (        ) .We'll just have to   (.) put it down there some time and just   (.) put it on.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	So you wouldn't know when it's on or when it's off.
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	Just have to try and, take a little while to get used to it.Once you're used to it it's probably  (        ) .It's all a matter of getting used to being recorded.Conversation.
*ANN:	Yeah well it sounds ever so funny when you hear it   (        ) 
*STU:	I know.Yeah.
*ANN:	Horrible.You think   (.) I don't sound like that! ((laugh)) . Really makes you think.I wish   (        ) done something about my   (.) the way I speak.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	Mine's terrible because I've got a low voice, a deep voice anyway.Sound more like a man I do.I do on the phone don't I?
*STU:	Don't know really.I've not really heard you much on the phone.
*ANN:	Used to telephone didn't you?
*STU:	Well yeah but
*ANN:	Didn't know it was me.
*STU:	Oh yeah I knew it was you so it didn't make a lot of difference.
*ANN:	People have told me on the phone that I sound   ((cough)) cos I've got a deep voice I
*STU:	You sound different. (.) Vera does.
*ANN:	Does she?
*STU:	Mm. (.) She sounds funny on the phone.Most odd.Phone her up and think   (.) that's not Vera I'm talking to.Doesn't sound like Vera.But it is   (.) although it doesn't sound like her.Funny innit?
*ANN:	What, her voice is different?
*STU:	No it just sounds 
*ANN:	Or does she talk different because she's on the phone?
*STU:	No   (.) just sounds

*STU:	Yes thank you.Fine.I would have done it actually when, when I took the plate out but the water in the bowl was cold.Thought it was hot but it was cold.

*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	I need a bath as well but
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	I've used quite a few buckets of water washing walls.
