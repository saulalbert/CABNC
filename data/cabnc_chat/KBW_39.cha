*DOR:	but it was cold when we got in and even colder when we got out  ((laugh)) , so if we all go down with pneumonia  that will   (  )

*UNK:	Oh, oh 
*DOR:	 (  ) on the left  carried on   ((laugh))   
*UNK:	  (  )   (  ) 
*DOR:	well that's I thought when I saw it coming out I thought oh goodness this is gonna be ten P a week, that's the same for everybody, very good 
*UNK:	How does  (  )  
*DOR:	and because it's slight yellow you don't lose it you know, if you keep all your stuff in it at home you can see it under the chairs and you know huh, find it again  ((laugh)) . We, one doesn't try to lose things, but they just happen don't they really   ((laugh)) I think I appreciate more now, you know when I was, when I was teaching I used to think oh stupid woman she's not, to bring this book in and you know, and now I think oh dear, huh, yeah and you also appreciate the people, I would appreciate now those who managed to do it every day without fail, manage to sort of let, because they must of put themselves out no end  to have   
*UNK:	 Yes   
*DOR:	done it  as opposed   
*UNK:	 keep in   
*DOR:	to those who think oh blow I can't find it just tough    ((laugh))  (.) mm 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	no   ((laugh)) hope we don't lose it on that Tim, it's got all my money in at the moment, it's a really good one isn't it, we're really enjoying it at the moment   (.) doesn't what number it is but we just, what do we do with this? (.)  
*UNK:	Something seven 
*DOR:	Something seven, sixty seven perhaps even or seventy something, anyway whatever it's got money hasn't it? (.)  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	It is 
*UNK:	well we haven't seemed to   (  ) the new five P's 
*DOR:	yeah, well I was gonna say those new five P's are   (  ) but you see you just get the new five P's and low and behold  they will produce something else   
*UNK:	 they change    (  )   (.) hang on 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	oh yes 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	He's got chicken pox at the moment I think 
*UNK:	Oh 
*DOR:	I think she's probably just come out for a quick stroll, we won't spend our time over that at the moment, (  )  hello   
*UNK:	 Hello   
*DOR:	alright? 
*UNK:	Have they not had chicken pox? 
*DOR:	Yes, ours have, yeah they probably passed it on in fact, kids probably passed it to them 
*UNK:	Oh 
*DOR:	weeks ago. 
*UNK:	I was thinking I haven't heard him cry  (  )  
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Is he happier? 
*DOR:	Tim you mean? 
*UNK:	No, that  (  )  
*DOR:	Oh that one 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Yes  ((laugh)) . I tell you something I was amazed at erm the reading book he appeared with, Fluff and Nip and goodness knows what that went out with the ark when I came out of college, I don't know whether they're all reading that or whether it's just sort of found them and must of been just perhaps a one off or something, but, I was amazed 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	no I don't think it is, I think it's probably got   
*UNK:	  (  )  
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	it's the moral, that's right, and the moral sounds, sounds good doesn't it, I don't know if it is, but  it just sounds it I suppose   
*UNK:	 Well I, I mean   (  )   
*DOR:	no, no 
*UNK:	I mean I like   (  ) very much 
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	yeah, could well be, I don't know what it is 
*UNK:	if it's anything   (  ) school 
*DOR:	no and I, I think particularly this new head seems to know exactly what she's doing, where she's going, I think it's excellent so I'm sure she's working everybody to death and I think that's brilliant  ((laugh))  
*UNK:	Yeah 
*DOR:	 well I was worked to death   
*UNK:	 if she   (  )   
*DOR:	when I first came out of college and I really appreciated it 
*UNK:	well I, I, I   
*DOR:	 you know  you had high standards and you knew where you were aiming for and that's what I want my kids to go through as well, you know, somebody who's gonna do their best   
*UNK:	 because it rubs off on them   
*DOR:	mm 
*UNK:	it's, it's everybody around them got to  try hard   
*DOR:	 that's right  , that's right 
*UNK:	you know the stuff I mean  they will   
*DOR:	 yeah   
*UNK:	know  that's there expect    
*DOR:	 that's right and  you know that if the staff has put theirselves out to make a decent crash in their environment they're gonna go mad at the children if they muck it up, so therefore, you know, you're gonna have that 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	I think that one of the   (.) things that get me at the moment is the time keeping, it's very bad 
*DOR:	mm 
*UNK:	I mean they stroll in at quarter  to nine and I think   
*DOR:	 right, right   
*UNK:	 I think that   
*DOR:	 it's a bit bad that   
*UNK:	yeah 
*DOR:	yeah, well I was there the other day and erm the bell went and nobody sort of moved and I thought I think, I know, you know, so I got up and I washed me cup of tea like, you know, they looked at me as if you know oh there's a keen   (  )  ((laugh)) , but I mean I do think it's important  to do that, because not only that it's not fair for the   
*UNK:	 I think   (  ) the day you get   (  ) I've, I've   (  )   
*DOR:	dinner ladies, because I mean they're stuck out there you know doing their best. 
*UNK:	cos   (  ) from their every angle a child needs  (  )  
*DOR:	yeah, yeah 
*UNK:	cos it's   (  ) I mean my two I've always been very  (  )  
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	 and they've never been late to their jobs   
*DOR:	 I aim to get things there on time   
*UNK:	you know they've both got little jobs, they've never be late and  they   
*DOR:	 mm   
*UNK:	have to go  and   
*DOR:	 yeah   
*UNK:	all that sort of thing, but 
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	I don't know what   (  ) strolling and  (  )  
*DOR:	yeah, you mean the children and the  say rather than  
*UNK:	 oh yeah   
*DOR:	the staff 
*UNK:	 oh yes, I meant the children   
*DOR:	 yeah   
*UNK:	yeah, I was thinking of the parent and teacher side of it 
*DOR:	oh yeah 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	you're waiting to go into assembly 
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	I don't know, it should, to me   (  ) every day, one, two children  you know   
*DOR:	 yep   
*UNK:	I think   (  ) they're late every day 
*DOR:	yeah  ((laugh))  
*UNK:	once or twice  (  )  
*DOR:	they probably don't get up until quarter to nine, see they have a struggle really to get there on time  ((laugh))  
*UNK:	I, I, if you can manage to get here for ten past nine every day, why can't you manage to get  here for nine o'clock   
*DOR:	 to get here for nine o'clock  every day, yeah 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	it's five to it says  on the bits of paper   
*UNK:	 it's five to   (  )  
*DOR:	but then the bell doesn't go till nine, although sometimes it goes at two minutes to nine and sometimes it goes at five past nine 
*UNK:	I think all the clocks are    (  )   
*DOR:	 they say  something different or something  do they? 
*UNK:	 yeah  , because I was in the    (  )   
*DOR:	 Cos sometimes I think we've got hours  and we hear bell going as we're coming up the hill and we think oh dear and then, you know, other times   
*UNK:	 yeah   
*DOR:	we'll be sitting in the playground for ages, well standing in the playground for ages. 
*UNK:	I think sometimes these things crop up  (  )  
*DOR:	Yeah 
*UNK:	and we all get rather engrossed 
*DOR:	yeah 
*UNK:	and then everybody's gone to the classroom and you think oh gosh the bell 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	anyway I    (  )   
*DOR:	 right, OK   
*UNK:	see you. 
*DOR:	bye  (5.0)
