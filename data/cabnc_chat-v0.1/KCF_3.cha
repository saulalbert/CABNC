*HER:	Yeah. •120206_120217•
        No because you're paying extra thirty five pence for  •120290_120508•
*ALI:	Alright then, so I'm gonna have one pound sixty five a week? •120520_120889•
*HER:	Yeah. •120962_120983•
        Providing you don't put any petrol in your vehicle. •121019_121228•
        And you don't do any drinking. •121321_121440•
        Fine, so you've got that. •121505_121768•
*ALI:	That, that'll suit me. •121795_121859•
        I, I won't put no petrol in the vehicle then and I won't do no drinking. •121859_122673•
        Okay? •122673_122682•
*HER:	Course •122682_122697•
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	Stuart's going to be one thirty five down. •122697_123273•
        And even more when he gets his car back on the road, so •123273_123632•
*IRI:	He's not putting his car back on the road. •123699_125120•
        I don't know why he isn't. •125266_126278•
*HER:	put his car back on the road. •126771_127326•
*ALI:	. •_•
        But I think once they've gone off the road now it's  gonna be  gonna be worse  when the, when the engine stops ? •129183_129747•
        When you take anything off the road   left it a couple of days without running it, even on a Sunday, it'd be a harder to get it back going again on Monday. •129750_131077•
*HER:	Well the thing is if he can get four hundred quid why doesn't he get one of them new bikes that Sinclair's brought out? •131129_131893•
        Well, they run for an hour on a battery  without pedalling, three hours if you pedal. •131900_132211•
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	It's a bike  it's electric. •132211_132270•
        It's a battery. •132270_132305•
        It's a bike and you go  like that to get it going and then you, it rides along. •132305_133063•
        Isn't it? •133080_133106•
*IRI:	I've no idea. •133106_133216•
        I've not even   •133216_133246•
*HER:	four hundred and odd pounds. •133382_133456•
*ALI:	Oh that's not bad is it? •133456_133634•
        Cos you can pay that for a blooming mountain bike. •133634_134015•
*HER:	Yeah. •134015_134033•
        And it'll run for an hour  without pedalling. •134033_134124•
        If you pedal you can get as much as three hours. •134134_134665•
        A penny  it costs a penny to recharge it, it recharges in an hour. •134665_134820•
        So if you go •134842_134910•
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	No but if you go from here to work isn't it? •134910_135057•
        Plug it in  in the what's name, pull lead off it and plug it in  and then it'll •135137_135572•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*HER:	a penny, say here's a penny. •135788_136062•
        And then he's ready to come back home again isn't he? •136062_136328•
        Plug it in here  give your mam a penny. •136328_136661•
*IRI:	Er  give him a penny   •136677_136765•
*HER:	That's what it is. •137284_137466•
        Rechargeable battery. •137493_138274•
*ALI:	Well say I moved and lived in Gambia. •138274_138433•

*HER:	Ah but you've got a British passport. •141566_141725•
        You're not a resident of Gambia. •142069_142254•
        You're a British  •142459_142515•
*ALI:	they don't know. •142608_142650•
        And you can vote loads of times there. •142650_142798•
        You're not on a register. •142798_142874•
*HER:	They put a stamp on you. •142874_143177•
*ALI:	Stamp on where? •143181_143355•

*HER:	Yeah the Pakistanis! •146988_147047•

        This is what all the trouble's about, they've all got British passports. •147190_147447•
*ALI:	Well why are they allowed to have a British passport? •147454_147803•
*IRI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	the empire we allowed them to have British passports didn't we? •147822_148131•

        And Indians and all this. •149253_149348•
        And this is why we're trying to stop them coming in. •149352_149608•
        There's ten thousand a week coming in. •149735_150540•
*ALI:	Every week? •150560_150584•

        Straight into this country. •152223_152340•
        And be doing all our  they will be gonna come and do all the jobs that we don't want like in, in  catering and, and things like that. •152416_153304•
        All the rough jobs. •153424_153515•
        They get in here  then they bring their families and then they're gonna  fill the country up aren't they? •153560_154031•
        It's only a little tiny country. •154031_154154•
