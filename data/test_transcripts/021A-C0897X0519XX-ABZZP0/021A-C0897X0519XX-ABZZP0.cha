Frederick       3533    and I'm seeing the surgeon today and erm <pause> and I met somebody the other day who'd had it done and his fingers weren't affected, you know, so I mean it's just the luck of the draw I think.
3534    However <pause> I thought well I'm, I'm er
Yvonne  3535    Mind you it does look better than when I saw it last.

3548    Oh.
Yvonne  3549    Oh right <pause> hope the surgeon might be able to provide you with <unclear>
Frederick       3550    Mm well <pause> I, I mean really I want him to tell me <pause> I mean she implies that I'm gonna get, you know, back <pause> fully back to normal but <pause> I <pause> I'm beginning to wonder myself
Yvonne  3551    Mm.
Frederick       3552    er I, I mean I really can't doubt her but erm, you know, you, how you have hunches.
Yvonne  3553    Yeah.
Frederick       3554    I feel as though I'm on a plateau at the moment although sh sh when I said that she said well <pause> i it is getting better so the
Yvonne  3555    There's a physio.
3556    <shouting>:[ Trish ] <pause> I've got a patient for you Trish if you've got five minutes to spare please. <laugh>
Trish   3557    Oh dear.
Frederick       3558    Er he's ever such a nice patient though
Yvonne  3559    It's not serious.
Trish   3560    Oh great!
Frederick       3561    he's ever such a nice patient.
3562    You didn't have the pleasure of meeting him when he used to work here.
Yvonne  3563    <laugh> This is Fred, he used to, he used to work in <unclear>
Frederick       3564    Hello.
3565    <unclear> contracture.
Trish   3566    Is that what you've got?
Frederick       3567     Opera no, I've had it.
Yvonne  3568    He's had an operation.
Frederick       3569    Mm.
Yvonne          <unclear >
Frederick       3570    No no, I won't say that.
3571    Operation the sixth of December <pause> on the little finger <pause> er and my other fingers swelled up <unclear>
Trish   3572    Mm.
Frederick       3573    and are still not down.
3574    <pause> Really what I'm wanting you to tell me is how normal is that and
Trish   3575    <sigh> To be honest I'm not, I erm <pause> not quite sure really.
3576    I mean have, have you been back to, to, to clinic following <unclear>
Frederick       3577    Oh yeah yeah yeah.
3578    Well I had it done on the insurance you know
Trish   3579    Right yeah.
Frederick       3580    so I'm seeing the surgeon again today
Trish   3581    Are you?
3582    You
Frederick       3583    but of course he's the one who's done it
Trish   3584    Mm.
Frederick       3585    so even if he sort of made a, a bodge, I'm not suggesting he has <laughing>:[ he's not likely to, to ] say yes that's because of that.
Trish   3586    So is the finger better then?
3587    I mean
Frederick       3588    Well <pause> erm it, oh well I mean it is better in as much as it was sticking out like that
Trish   3589    Mm.
Frederick       3590    and I can <laughing>:[ whereas I ] couldn't get a glove on now I can now.
Trish   3591    Right.
Frederick       3592    I haven't got all that much movement.
Trish   3593    Yeah.
Frederick       3594    Well you know I mean it's not too bad I suppose.
Trish   3595    No I'd just be, I mean I must admit I've, I've not really seen one for years and years and years.
3596    You get quite sort of specialized.
3597    I think
Frederick       3598    Yeah quite.
Trish   3599    undoubtedly I think you need to ask him, you know, that erm just say to him that you're very concerned about the fingers
Frederick       3600    Yeah, yeah.
Trish   3601    and, you know, what can, what can <unclear> do about it.
Frederick       3602    Now the physio, I'm I'm having the, I'm having physio
Trish   3603    Yeah.
Frederick       3604    and I was just saying to Yvonne er I'm rapidly running out of my physio allowance, you know, because of the amount that
Trish   3605    Yes, yeah, yeah perhaps you're not
Frederick       3606    she's doing erm and she seems to imply that er it will get back to normal but, you know, I <pause> I just, I'm not er happy about that myself.
Trish   3607    Well I would have thought so but really erm I think you just need to sort of
Frederick       3608    I, I, I mean it really has been swollen and er inflamed
Trish   3609    So it's down a bit?
Frederick       3610    Oh yes.
Trish   3611    Yeah.
Frederick       3612    Oh yes, yes yes yes.
3613    Oh yes and I had er pressure sores, you know?
Trish   3614    Mm.
3615    Yeah, no I think you just need to be frank with him and you know say <pause> you're happy about the finger, fine, but just, you know, <unclear>
Frederick       3616    I'm more concerned about these
Trish   3617    Yeah.
Frederick       3618    because these were okay <laugh>
Trish   3619    Right
Frederick       3620    than, than this.
Trish   3621    Yeah, well no I would be direct with him and say, you know
Frederick       3622    Yeah.
Trish   3623    you're really worried about these
Frederick       3624    Yeah.
Trish   3625    and, and just see, sort of see what, what he says really
Frederick       3626    Mm.
Trish   3627    and if you're having physio that's, that's good but like you say <unclear>
Yvonne          [telephone number] <unclear>
Frederick       3628    No I mean I, I don't know how much.
3629    It, the bill was hundred and thirty eight quid last month <pause> and it'll be more than that this month and I think my yearly allowance is about three hundred, you know, so I'm rapidly running out.
3630    <pause> Anyway thanks for your, no no
Trish   3631    Sorry I can't really sort of say I must admit I couldn't really see why they should be like that really cos I mean it is a bit puzzling cos if they've only just done anything, they've only been tampering with this finger so
Frederick       3632    The, the, the the other thing er I, I have the feeling in this finger of, not pins and needles, but just a slight difference he's obviously cut some nerves I should imagine.
3633    But er you know I'm, as I say, I'm more concerned about those <pause>
Trish   3634    How annoying.
3635    But I must admit I haven't seen an I haven't seen, you know it's years well it'll be years <unclear>
Frederick       3636    You see what what I'm up against is, I mean the physio who, who, I mean she's private of course
Trish   3637    Mm.
Frederick       3638    she is one wanting er referrals from Mr [last or full name] so she's not going to say oh well you know there's something wrong there, you know?
Trish   3639    Mm.
Frederick       3640    Is she?
Trish   3641    No.
Frederick       3642    You see.
3643    Er er and er <pause> I'm not saying that there is necessarily, but even if there was she's not going to because she wants to preserve her, her referrals.
3644    Don't want me <unclear>
Trish   3645    Well I'd just say you're really worried about these fingers
Frederick       3646    Yeah.
Trish   3647    and that, you know, <unclear> and you just say, you know <pause> you know, what, what are you <laughing>:[ gonna do about this ]
Frederick       3648    Yeah.
Trish   3649    you know, should it, should it actually be like <unclear>
Frederick       3650    Yeah.
Trish   3651    Then if you get some answers then you can always say to him well this is what, you know, this is what
Frederick       3652    Yeah well I mean I saw him what, either a fortnight or three weeks ago, three, probably about three weeks, and at that stage my plaster that I'd had on after the er op had only been off perhaps a fortnight, it was Christmas intervening you see, so he had every sort of right to say, you know, oh well yeah <pause> it should be okay, yeah. <unclear>
Trish   3653    Think the only thing you can do is as I say be honest and say that, you know, you're very worried about your fingers
Frederick       3654    Yeah, yeah.
Trish   3655    <unclear> I know it's not a lot of help but erm
Frederick       3656    No well you, you
Trish   3657    I'm, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to say whether it was <unclear> or not so <unclear>
Frederick       3658    Yeah, yeah, well that, that's fine, that's all I wanted to know, I'm pleased you popped in, i it
Trish   3659    <laughing>:[ Sorry ]
Frederick       3660    yes but i it's sort of erm
Trish   3661    Even if it's only to give you the confidence you know
Frederick       3662    Yeah.
Trish   3663    to sort of
Frederick       3664    Yeah.
Trish   3665    It's awful I <unclear>, I'm the same if I'm going to see a doctor, I think ooh
Frederick       3666    Well when you've got
Trish   3667    you forget what you were going to ask <unclear>
Frederick       3668    Yes but when you've been, when you've been in the work as I have over many years with doctors, I was a mental welfare officer so I mean I know <pause> er, you know, you can be fobbed off.
Trish   3669    That's right.
3670    No go for it. <laugh> <pause>
Frederick       3671    Right.
Trish   3672    <unclear> <laugh> Well I hope it is <unclear> but they're not good are they?
Frederick       3673    Well if that, th
Trish           <unclear>
Frederick       3674    Yes I'm, yeah, yeah I mean I can drive
Trish   3675    But that's it?
Frederick       3676    er but I haven't got, I haven't got a grip. <pause>
Trish           <unclear>
Frederick       3677    Thanks very much.
Trish   3678    get sorted out
Frederick       3679    Thanks.
3680    Cheers.
