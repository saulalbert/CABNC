@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 033401)
*PAT:	erm   (.) I think it can't be bad for you   (.) because   (.) you do quite a lot of the same exercise as you'd do in proper aerobics 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*PAT:	but you're in the water the whole time. 
*NOE:	I don't even know what proper aerobics are anyhow. 
*PAT:	Oh you just keep moving the whole time. Running on the spot and  waving your arms about   
*NOE:	 Just seem to  keep moving all the time without even running on the spot. 
*PAT:	Yeah well   (.) this is, this is   (.) you know   (  ) it's very difficult to run in the water 
*NOE:	I know it is. 
*PAT:	cos it keeps getting round your feet and sort of  
*NOE:	  ((laugh))  
*PAT:	making you drop over. 
*NOE:	Yeah. 
*PAT:	And I suppose developing the muscles that keep you   (.) from dropping over   (.) it's pro  can't be, can't be a bad thing. 
*NOE:	I suppose it can't, no.  I   
*PAT:	 And then  you do other exercises like lying on your back, putting your feet   (.) your   (.) from the knees downwards over the edge of the pool   (.) and then trying to do sit ups. 
*NOE:	Good heavens! 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	I'm too old for any of that. 
*ENI:	But Noel, isn't exercise against resistance is supposed to have some special benefit isn't it? (.)  
*NOE:	Well I'm doing that all the time, I'm doing it with you my love. 
*PAT:	  ((laugh))  
*ENI:	 Oh come off it. 
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) Erm   (.) I don't know, I, I, I, I   (.) I just feel that this is   (.) that sort of exercise where   (.) er 
*ENI:	Ooh sorry. 
*PAT:	it only lasts an hour, it's not going to do any harm 
*ENI:	No I'm sure it isn't. 
*PAT:	it's erm a good thing to be doing. 
*ENI:	 Because swimming's   
*NOE:	 I think something that  does do harm is jogging. 
*PAT:	Yeah well 
*ENI:	Well yes that's a beast. 
*PAT:	I, I did a little jog this morning with the dogs cos it was too cold to walk. 
*NOE:	Oh  ((laugh))  
*ENI:	Ah yes. (.)  
*PAT:	And I've got another one this afternoon I think. 
*NOE:	Have you ever been in the sauna at er Woodbridge? 
*PAT:	No I haven't. 
*NOE:	Er er no I haven't either. Er I one, went into one at Iceland that was   (.) it was lovely. 
*PAT:	I've been in a sauna in London   (.) I belong to a health club there. 
*NOE:	Mm. (.)  
*PAT:	I used to play squash. 
*NOE:	Mm. (  )   
*ENI:	 That's a  violent one isn't it, squash? (.)  
*PAT:	Yes. (.)  
*ENI:	I, I can't think that really violent exercise is a good thing generally is it? Something that's more measured 
*PAT:	Oh I don't think   (.) I don't think it hurts when you're young, I think when you're older you should only do it if you've done warming up first. 
*ENI:	I think so too probably, and you've been used to it. That let's us off, isn't it nice? (.)  
*PAT:	I think the warming up exercises in themselves are a good thing though 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	even if you don't do anything after 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	after warming up. (.)  
*ENI:	 (  ) 
*PAT:	The class I go to on Monday evenings   (.) erm   (.) we do warming up exercises   (.) and I'd be quite happy if they just stayed warming up exercises for the whole hour. 
*ENI:	Yes.  (.) Have you got someone properly qualified taking them? 
*PAT:	Yes, she's very good. 
*ENI:	Mm. (.)  
*NOE:	I went to a sauna in Iceland 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*NOE:	and then was able to straight, in, in the hotel it was 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*NOE:	straight up in the lift to my bedroom and it was lovely you know, yeah   (.) in the hot, in the   (  ) swimming pa  pool 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*NOE:	or through the shower then in the swimming pool then back again   (.) and when I'd finished with it I went straight upstairs to my room and I went to sleep straight away, it was lovely. 
*ENI:	I was waiting for him to say he went out and rolled in the snow   (.) because that's the proper end isn't it? 
*PAT:	Mm and you should beat yourself with twigs as well. 
*GRO:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	I'm not   (.) I don't know really about that. 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	Oh you should definitely do that, I mean   
*ENI:	 That borders  on the nasty I think. ((laugh))  
*NOE:	They had a   (.) there was a sort of electric burner in the place as a whole 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*NOE:	where they kept on throwing on 
*PAT:	Water to 
*NOE:	water with some erm sort of fir smelling in it. 
*PAT:	Oh yes, it made steam. 
*NOE:	Mm. Fine mm. 
*ENI:	That's it. I should apologize for canned soup, but I spent so long talking to Stanley this morning 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	you know sometimes you can just tell he wants you to talk to him, and erm   (.) so I er couldn't make a proper soup, sorry, but this is   
*PAT:	 I think   
*ENI:	good actually I think. 
*PAT:	Yes, which is it? Is it Heinz? 
*ENI:	Heinz tomato    ((laughing))  (  )  
*PAT:	I   (.) I made some stock the other day 
*NOE:	Mhm. 
*PAT:	and I put some of it in the freezer 
*ENI:	Yes, ideal. 
*PAT:	in erm sort of bowls. 
*ENI:	What did you use for your stock? 
*PAT:	Some bones. 
*ENI:	And? (.)  
*PAT:	Oh   (.) some onions and  (.)  
*ENI:	Carrot? 
*PAT:	carrot, yes. 
*ENI:	Celery? That gives a lovely flavour. 
*PAT:	I don't think I had any celery, I had, I had   (.) put in whatever I had in the house and sort of various herbs and spices and things. 
*NOE:	Did you put the bones in the stock before or after the dogs had had them? 
*ENI:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*PAT:	During? 
*GRO:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	During  ((laugh))  
*PAT:	The dogs went into it instead. 
*ENI:	Think what a luscious stock the dogs would make. 
*PAT:	No they wouldn't. 
*ENI:	Mhm. 
*PAT:	Erm 
*ENI:	All that hair. Yuk. 
*PAT:	erm   (.) no what happened was that he gave me some bones that were far too big for the dogs. So I made stock out of those. 
*ENI:	Where they gorgeous marrow bones?  That   (  )   
*PAT:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	Oh yes, they make wonderful stock don't they? 
*PAT:	Mm. Well normally when he gives marrow bones I ask him to chop them up a bit smaller 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	but he gave them to me practically 
*NOE:	Mm.  (.) He's an obliging chap isn't he? 
*ENI:	Mm. I always feel   (.) that when he's giving, (  ) , because he gives them to one, doesn't charge for any 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	er anything for the bones, one can hardly say   (.) erm give that another whack across the knuckle because 
*NOE:	He wouldn't 
*ENI:	the big knuckle has so much  locked inside   
*NOE:	 He wouldn't mind. 
*ENI:	it doesn't it? 
*PAT:	I do. 
*ENI:	Do you? 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	I should  really. 
*NOE:	 He wouldn't  mind. 
*ENI:	I ought to have courage. 
*PAT:	He charges high enough prices for his other things. 
*ENI:	Yes he, you're right, mhm. 
*PAT:	Erm   (.) when you do your stock   (.) do you first of all   (.) roast the bone? 
*ENI:	No but that is erm   (.) er a counsel of perfection or something isn't it? It it's a method anyway. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Erm   (.) do you? 
*PAT:	No. Well I didn't because   (.) I just couldn't be bothered to put the oven on to get as hot as that  for such short period of time. 
*ENI:	  (  )  What in fact does it do? (.)  
*PAT:	Oh I should think it erm melts out the marrow and does all sorts of quite good things for it. It probably gives it a good colour too. 
*ENI:	It gives it colour   (.) erm I'm sure because of the, of the fact that they're roasted. There's one thing that erm I sometimes do to give it colour, is once I've taken off the outside skin of the onion, the very outside 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	I put the next one in. 
*PAT:	Mm?  (.) Does that, that gives it  colour does it? 
*ENI:	 I read that  somewhere, mm. (.)  
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	But roasting them, I wouldn't like to get them with any sort of burnt   (.) taste. 
*PAT:	Well I don't think it would give a burnt taste but I think, I think it probably could do quite a lot of good for it. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	Er I just read it in er I was reading Delia. 
*ENI:	Mm, yes.  (.) Oh yes she's good.  (.) And she tells you to do that does she? 
*PAT:	Yes. (.)  
*ENI:	It's the matter of the moment really, you just fling them into a roasting tin don't you and put it in the oven?  (.) And that's alright if you've got a Rayburn but otherwise you have to start 
*PAT:	Yes, start from scratch. 
*ENI:	heating it up, mm. 
*PAT:	Now   (.) when I was away staying with my cousins 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	he is a G P   (.) in High Wycombe   (.) and he's a fundholder. 
*ENI:	Oh good, tell me about it. 
*PAT:	Well he's also been on hundreds of committees because they were sort of one of the early ones  to be done   
*ENI:	 Mm. 
*PAT:	and they have a battery of sort of board members   (.) drawn from here there and everywhere, including a fair quantity of   (.) redundanted service people. 
*ENI:	Oh. 
*PAT:	They had an S A S officer running, running them  ((laugh))  
*ENI:	 ((laughing)) Is that to get you ri  to get rid of the patients he didn't want ? ((laugh))  
*PAT:	No, it was to get rid of the Health Service. He, he, he said that at one point this chap had used the phrase that   (.) well that they were going for controlled destabilization from the Health Service. 
*NOE:	Controlled what? 
*PAT:	Destabilization. 
*NOE:	Oh. 
*ENI:	The S A S man was? 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Why? (.)  
*PAT:	That's what the aim of   (.) the people doing it was. 
*ENI:	You mean the official government line? 
*PAT:	Mm or that's what they er   (.) or maybe that was his interpretation of it anyway this   (.) was a phrase that came out   (.) in, in the actual meetings. And then he told me a hilarious story about the way in which the chairman of the committee, I'm not sure quite what particular branch in the world he'd come from but   (.) he was looking at the figures, I suppose it was an accountant   (.) looking at the, the figures saying now why is it that the amount spent on district nurses has gone up?  (.) So he was told petrol has gone up.  (.) He said yes but you now have your health centre and the district nurses work from there.  (.) So erm they all looked at him, you know, the district nurses   (.) so John said to this man what   (.) there are some of our patients   (.) who are housebound  (.)  
*ENI:	Yes. 
*PAT:	and some of them   (.) as well as being housebound, maybe aren't very well and are bedbound  ((laugh))  
*NOE:	 ((laughing)) Mm  
*PAT:	and the district nurses visit them in their homes. He had to explain it to this man. 
*NOE:	 Good god. 
*ENI:	 Where did he  fund this committee from one has to ask  immediately. 
*PAT:	  (  )  he's not given his committee   (.) it's wished on him.  The local authority   
*ENI:	  (  )  
*PAT:	the local authority creates the committee. 
*ENI:	But I, I had no idea that he then had to be   (.) that, being given his own funding, he then had to be   (.) organized by a committee. Oh that's outrageous. 
*NOE:	Local council  (  )  
*PAT:	I think it must have been some sort of 
*NOE:	Yeah. 
*PAT:	thing like that, I don't know. (.)  
*ENI:	Well it doesn't seem sensible, I thought it was the G Ps getting control.  (.) I mean this is what's going to happen   (.) to the detriment of the health service right through 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	administration by people who don't know what it's all about. 
*PAT:	That's right. (.)  
*NOE:	 (  ) what has happened to a lot of these hospitals hasn't it? 
*PAT:	Well it seems to be still going on. What do you make of this idea of building a new hospital at Norwich   (.) with fewer beds? I can't understand it because if they've got fewer beds why don't they, they just hide a few of the beds they've got already? 
*NOE:	Absolutely. (.)  
*PAT:	Mm why do they have to have a green field site   (.) and start again? 
*ENI:	Is it because they're going to incorporate a lot of high tech   (.) treatments? 
*PAT:	I think so, yes. 
*ENI:	Mm and, you see erm   (.) it is a fact that they need fewer hospital beds nowadays because 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	the, the hospital stays are dramatically shorter than they were. 
*PAT:	Mm yes but we're coming up to a time when er the quantity of old people is going to be rather high    (.)  (  ) than before because we're all healthier. 
*NOE:	Mm. Mm. (.)  
*ENI:	They'll have something special for them like concentration camps. 
*PAT:	I know. Th  they've got those in Ipswich already haven't they? That's what they've made the old Anglesey Road hospital into. 
*ENI:	Is that so? 
*PAT:	Mm something like that. 
*ENI:	I wonder how it really goes. I wonder  (.)  
*PAT:	I don't know. Erm   (.) well  it's   
*ENI:	 Oh  this is disappointing because I thought that with G P who'll   (.) knows what he requires   (.) and what his patients require was going to have   (.) erm a pretty   (.) er erm 
*PAT:	Well you can't leave a G P to spend the money like he likes, you've got to have a committee for it. You  think about it. 
*ENI:	  ((laugh))  
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	You, you know? 
*NOE:	Ah! 
*ENI:	Ah. 
*PAT:	Yes anyway have you heard about how they do the costing? Will   was telling me  about it, how   (  ) how   (  ) how they   
*ENI:	 Oh do tell me because I   (  )   
*PAT:	how they cost erm   (.) something like a tonsillectomy. 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*ENI:	And how do they? 
*PAT:	Well apparently they count the procedures that are involved in doing it 
*NOE:	Mm? 
*PAT:	erm they have a price per procedure 
*ENI:	Yes? 
*PAT:	and they tot it up. 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	But they haven't got it quantified to such a point where they can actually distinguish a tonsillectomy which might have a lot of procedures but actually takes about half a minute   (.) with er other things that are, you know, much much more complicated and the cost of tonsillectomies is unreasonably high   (.) compared with erm, you know, with   (  )   
*ENI:	  (  )  
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Really? 
*PAT:	Mm. They haven't, they haven't got the pricing right. And   (.) I can understand them not having the pricing right, I don't think they've spent long enough   (.) working out what the prices of things are. 
*ENI:	They've dearly gone on for years not knowing, let alone tonsillectomies, what   
*PAT:	 Yes, they didn't   
*ENI:	these wretched erm 
*PAT:	they didn't  know   
*ENI:	 transplants  costs. 
*PAT:	they didn't know what they cost   (.) but equally being asked to budget   (.) against not knowing what  things cost   
*NOE:	 Mm mm   
*PAT:	is er equally stupid. 
*ENI:	Yes it is. Because er er ya   (.)  absol    
*PAT:	 But then, but then  the er the whole thing gets knocked for six anyway because of general   (.) unpredictableness of, of, of illness. 
*ENI:	Well it does I suppose.  It does. 
*PAT:	 You can  you can apply statistics to it a bit but it's very unlikely the statis  st  statistics   (.) and what really happens   (.) will always add up in fact.  (.) They, they've suddenly had a few outbreaks of polio haven't they? 
*ENI:	Oh have they? 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	I didn't hear that. I say. 
*PAT:	Mhm.  (.) Yep. They've had the odd child who hasn't been erm whatnotted   (.) and  some various   
*ENI:	 Ah! 
*PAT:	various men seem to have caught it from changing their nappies. 
*ENI:	Yes! I did hear of that. I'm sorry I wasn't relating it to erm   (.) to polio. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Erm  (.)  
*PAT:	Well you know, you've only got to get maybe smallpox back again and that will knock all their predictions for six. 
*ENI:	Erm 
*PAT:	They say they've wiped smallpox off the face of the earth. 
*ENI:	Yes they do you see. That's the doubtful one isn't it, because it's gone. It's supposed to be completely gone. 
*PAT:	Yeah but do they, do they inoculate children against it at all? 
*ENI:	No I don't think   (.) no I don't think we have smallpox inoculation er of, of children do we? 
*PAT:	Don't know we I mean we used to    (  )   
*ENI:	 Because they  say it's   (.) it's, it's   (.) gone completely. Erm   (.) sorry love we need a fork for that. Perhaps the meat fork from the shop would do nicely. No er er    (.)  (  ) erm   (.) it's all in the cutting, of course it is very   (.) no that's pork and Noel daren't touch it so I've got two slices so that you and I could have one. 
*PAT:	That's very nice, thank you. 
*ENI:	And Noel will have the other. Erm 
*PAT:	I haven't had any pork for ages. (.)  
*ENI:	it's so new to them that they're bothering to cost it, but how did we go on in the older days? I'm trying to think. Did we know anything about what our operations were costing?  I can't remember. 
*PAT:	 Well if y  you if  if you go to a BUPA hospital you go pa  you pay   (.) a sort of erm, you know, related type of    (  )   
*ENI:	 Yes a figure that's  been around that anyway, yes. 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	Ya. (.)  
*PAT:	But I don't know 
*ENI:	 ((whispering)) I'm just having that to start with I think . 
*PAT:	erm   (.) I do  I don't, I mean I don't know how accurate it is or whether it's sort of, you know, a set of figures they decided to put on. 
*ENI:	It wouldn't relate to  what it costs   
*PAT:	 to keep to keep  to keep their profits going. 
*ENI:	Yes, that's right. 
*PAT:	Well  it probably does relate   
*ENI:	 That's what it    (.) that'll be it. 
*PAT:	it probably does relate pretty well. 
*ENI:	I bet it doesn't relate to an actual operation in a   (.) general hospital because you've got so many people wanting their rake off in a private one surely? I mean  haven't you? 
*PAT:	 Yes.  Yes. 
*ENI:	That erm 
*PAT:	Yes their profit    (  )   
*ENI:	 Ya that's right. 
*NOE:	  (  )  rather tired   (.) bit fed up with private medicine at the moment. (.)  
*ENI:	Oh because of Richard?  I'm convinced that   
*NOE:	  (  ) Richard     
*ENI:	you know Richard   (.) er er  ? 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	Had he gone to a   (.) National Health hospital 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	with the request to have that back thing done for him 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	I'm convinced that at the age of seventy eight people do  they would have said don't bother. 
*PAT:	Yes I'm sure they would have done. 
*ENI:	Ya. And er would have erm   (.) perceived that he wasn't greatly hampered by it, but once you've got a surgeon who is going to get a fat fee   (.) he did say to him are you sure you want this done 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	but Richard was sure he wanted it done   (.) and nothing came between him and that   (.) intention. And you see he's, it's going to finish him. He's not going to get better. 
*PAT:	No. Erm   (.) but   (6.0) did he tol  tell you that   (.) the surgeon asked him if he really wanted it done? 
*ENI:	Oh yes it's known that he did. 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	He said er you're sure   (.) because it was quite a thought, for a man his age. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	But I think a surgeon in a National Health would have said   (.) look here I do not recommend this. 
*PAT:	Yeah but then the first thing he would have done would have been   (.) got up and gone off and got it done privately. (.)  
*ENI:	That is the danger.  (.) He would. So er the end was I suppose always connectable. 
*PAT:	Ya.  (.) If that's, if that's what private will do for you 
*ENI:	 Mm. 
*NOE:	 Mm. (.)  
*PAT:	I mean, I think, I hadn't realized that they would make different decisions on medical grounds. (.)  
*ENI:	Mm   (.) they will, it's more permissive if you're in the private sector.  (.) I'm sure of that.  (.) It doesn't come so hea  heavily loaded with advice against things. (.)  
*PAT:	What, because it's all too good for the moneybags? 
*ENI:	Yes it's, it's I suppose human nature to want to pursue your craft   (.) wherever you can. 
*PAT:	Mm. (.)  
*ENI:	But erm   (.) but it's been a very bad thing for him. (.)  
*PAT:	Yes. (6.0)  
*ENI:	But you see   (.) they've had computers in hospitals now for   (.) years 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	and are, are employing and paying people to work them   (.) but they don't ever seem to come to any   (.) let's say reportable   (.) conclusion about the cost of operations. I think if we knew what those heart and lung transplants cost, people would be up in arms that the National Health Service is being expected to fund that. 
*PAT:	Mm.  (.) Well y   (.) they're a little bit like   (.) nuclear electricity in terms of erm   (.) the expensive end  aren't they? 
*NOE:	 Mm.  Mm. (.)  
*ENI:	Yes I suppose that's so.  (.) I wish the government could really   (.) tellingly   (.) er do down these dreadful lies and scandal erm   (.) scaremongering things that the   (.) Labour opposition is putting forward. I mean they don't honestly care two hoots about people, if they can talk about the dreadful state the, the care of old people is in and   (.) all the rest of it and that it's going to get worse, frightening old people. That's not caring for the community at all.  (.) That's just erm   (.) politicking isn't it? 
*PAT:	Yes. I can think of nothing worse than Kinnock coming into power. 
*ENI:	Oh!  (.) Imagine   (.) how people like erm   (.) erm   (.) Helmut Kohl and 
*NOE:	Cook? 
*ENI:	Not Cook 
*NOE:	Oh. 
*ENI:	because he's in his own party, I mean Cook yes well he's a snidey little thing, I'm talking about the erm ambassadors and the politicians, the ministers who would be   
*NOE:	 Oh yes, oh lord yes. 
*ENI:	you know, opposing him. 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*ENI:	They'd just, they'd just run over him   (.) absolutely, whilst he was grinning.  (.) One can't see him in an ambassadorial role at all can one? 
*PAT:	No. (.)  
*ENI:	It may not come to it. (6.0)  
*PAT:	But this recession is quite a problem. 
*ENI:	Oh it must be. (.)  
*NOE:	It's a worldwide thing though. 
*PAT:	Mm.  (.) Yes but the trouble about it is that the English are so insular   (.) that lots of them don't, don't realize it or won't believe it. 
*NOE:	No. 
*ENI:	That's true. They, they regard that as an excuse. 
*PAT:	Mm. (.)  
*ENI:	Have some more chutney, it was given to us by our German daughter-in-law. 
*PAT:	 Oh   
*ENI:	 So  it will be perfect. 
*PAT:	Did she make it herself? 
*ENI:	She did. 
*PAT:	Goodness. (.)  
*ENI:	It was our Christmas present wasn't it? 
*NOE:	I forget what it was, was it her present? 
*ENI:	Mm.  (.)  (  )  (13.0) Well has it been nice not having to go to France? 
*PAT:	Mm.  (.) Except of having to go to London instead. 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) Mm I couldn't tell how many people would agree with you about that one   (.) that London could be at least a bit preferable to Paris. (.)  
*PAT:	Well   (.) Helen's a bit like you   (.) she, she sort of perks up when she starts to smell the petrol fumes    (  )   
*NOE:	 Mm!   ((laugh)) Ya. 
*PAT:	And she said she had a lovely time. She went to an exhibition, she   (.) went for a browsing sort of shop. She said the shops were empty. 
*ENI:	Mm.  (.) Shopping is much more comfortable now. 
*PAT:	Mm. I'd better go and try and do some  some time. 
*ENI:	 Mm.   (.) There's a lovely suit in    (.)  at the moment in the sale in   (.) what's that place called? 
*PAT:	 (  ) ? 
*ENI:	Near    (.)   (  )   
*PAT:	  (  )  
*NOE:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	 (  )  (.) it's really lovely. Smart, one could go to town or anywhere in it. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*NOE:	Why is it you don't buy it then? 
*ENI:	Well because it's darkish in colour   (.) and I'd rather promised myself that if I have anything new now   (.) it'll be of a brighter colour. 
*NOE:	Oh well go and buy the thing before somebody else does, go up this afternoon. 
*ENI:	Dearest I'm saying it's a dark colour. 
*NOE:	 Yes. 
*PAT:	 Yeah but  you could wear it with, you could wear bright things with it. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	Shush, don't   
*NOE:	  (  )  
*ENI:	push me, I don't need pushing. No no really   (.) I, I, I've resolved, it's charcoal grey you see 
*PAT:	It sounds very smart Enid. 
*ENI:	Very smart. 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	We're going to have  Princess Diana. 
*ENI:	 My size  too. 
*PAT:	Is it? 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	It's got your name written on it. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	Why don't you go up and buy the thing? 
*ENI:	No.  (.) I'll phone her and ask her if she's got it in red. ((laugh))  
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	You can pinch a bit more of my er    (  )   
*PAT:	 Like the telephone woman. 
*ENI:	Mm? 
*PAT:	Like the telephone woman. 
*ENI:	Oh er isn't she oh isn't she super? 
*PAT:	I don't like the advertisements they're doing for the telephone now though. 
*ENI:	Which are they? (.)  
*PAT:	Oh they have this silly man who   (.) picks up the telephone in a   (.) he's er got a chef's hat on and he says Giovanni's   (.) and then it was, it turns out to be one of his old friends so he lapses into sort of Glaswegian. 
*ENI:	Oh no! 
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	I haven't heard that one.  (.) Oh but Maureen erm   (.) er what's  she called? Maureen Lipman, yes   
*NOE:	 Lipman, Lipman. 
*ENI:	is very good on those isn't she? 
*PAT:	Mm. (.)  
*ENI:	She's the right sort. Erm   (.) the thing that I   (.) feel I couldn't go to see her in   (.) is erm Hello Joyce. 
*PAT:	Yes, that Joyce Grenfell thing? 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	A bit of it was on the television. 
*ENI:	Yes, I saw that bit and it wasn't good 
*PAT:	No. 
*ENI:	because sh  Joyce Grenfell was such a lady, it came through. And   (.) and wh  and er   (.) Maureen Lipman is much more earthy 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and that came through and it was no good. If you've seen Joyce Grenfell you, you couldn't    (  )   
*NOE:	 Funny thing to put   
*PAT:	No. 
*NOE:	a Jewess to   (.) to try to represent Joyce Grenfell anyhow isn't it? 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Yes in a way, except she    (  )  (.) well you could do, it could be done. Did you feel that about her on television? 
*PAT:	Well I felt, I just didn't know what it was but it lacked the sort of charm that it had before. 
*ENI:	Mm.  (.) Completely. Almost thought when she, when it was   (.) when it was erm   (.) er mentioned in the first place that she was going to do it 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	I almost thought ooh   (.) you know I'd love to write and say oh don't, don't.  ((laugh)) Joyce Grenfell was such a lady. You couldn't say that to her cos she didn't   (.) it would be insulting but   (.) in fact, that's the big difference. 
*PAT:	Mm.  (.) Talking of things like this, you know   (.) er some people have postcards with their name on   (.) in black, across the top    (  )   
*ENI:	 Oh yes they do.  Yes that's right, they do. 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	Well   (.) er all sorts of funny people like have them like erm   (.) Iris   has, has them. 
*ENI:	 Oh does she? 
*NOE:	 And does Jane   . 
*PAT:	Yes. Yes she has them 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	my aunt has them, my father used to have them. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	and   (.) so I've always associated them with sort of erm, you know, what people had before all those sticky labels came    (  )   
*ENI:	 Mm  yes. People who did things properly? 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	Well   (.) when I was in the London office one chap who is an   (.) east end Jew made good, his name is Ralph  , erm suddenly gasped and said gosh isn't this wonderful? So I sort of was called to look at it, and I said oh yes, all the people I know who have got those are over seventy. 
*NOE:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) And was it one of his own? 
*PAT:	No no, someone had sent it to him. 
*ENI:	Somebody had sent to him. 
*PAT:	And he, he thought that it was   (.) such a touch of class about it. 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	 ((laughing)) And I expect he's gone away to get them printed now  
*ENI:	 ((laughing)) Oh probably. 
*PAT:	because I s   I said, I said   
*ENI:	 How funny . 
*PAT:	I said well they're just what people had before   (.) the sticky labels. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*PAT:	And he dragged out his sticky labels   (.) which, which had got blue stripes on them 
*ENI:	No? 
*PAT:	 ((laughing)) Yes, I thought  ((laugh))  
*ENI:	 ((laughing)) No  
*PAT:	that wasn't terribly elegant  but anyway his blue labels had got, these little sticky labels had got blue stripes on them 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*PAT:	 (  ) top and bottom. (  )   
*ENI:	 Oh how  funny. 
*PAT:	Erm   (.) and so I guess he's gone away to get some made. 
*ENI:	Mm  ((laugh))  
*PAT:	And I said   (.) and of course to do it really properly, you also have envelopes so that if you want to you can stick, stick the card in an envelope  that will   
*NOE:	 Yes. 
*PAT:	fit it. Cos that's what we used to have. 
*ENI:	Mm. Oh yes it wouldn't go naked through the post would it? 
*NOE:	  (  )  
*PAT:	 Well you can  yes  you can't   
*ENI:	 Mm   
*PAT:	you know, you could use it for quick notes 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	to drop on people's doorsteps 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*PAT:	or, or 
*ENI:	Which is useful. 
*PAT:	Yes. Or if you just want to sort of signify a, a quick thank you to someone. 
*ENI:	Mm yes. 
*PAT:	Or a quick come 
*ENI:	Yes I hadn't thought about that. 
*NOE:	Mm  mm   
*PAT:	 they're  they are very useful, I've often thought of having some made 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	because, in fact every time I get one from someone else I always think why haven't I gone and got some of those yet? 
*ENI:	I know why, because you're not seventy. ((laugh))  
*PAT:	That's right, give me another twenty years. 
*NOE:	We had those envelopes er and the cards for our concerts. 
*ENI:	Well they were probably erm   (.) invitation to a  concert. 
*NOE:	 Yeah  but they were all fixed up to go into the same envelope sort of thing. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	Yes    (  )   
*ENI:	 Oh yes  you can't  (  ) , can't use them though. 
*NOE:	No. 
*ENI:	Got too much detail of where we lived and erm you know   (.) that it  was a concert. 
*PAT:	 But  but these   (.) you know, you had your telephone number and   (  ) you know, just had a whole statement of everything  about you. 
*ENI:	 Mm  mm. 
*PAT:	And  (.)  
*ENI:	And all you needed was the brief message that you had to send. 
*PAT:	Yes. And it saved you hav  it saved you having to do the preliminary thing of saying dear whoever you are 
*NOE:	  (  )  
*ENI:	 Of course, that's right.  That's right. 
*PAT:	which was sometimes quite a difficult thing to do. 
*ENI:	Well on a personal card you're not supposed to put dear anybody  are you so   
*PAT:	 I know  but 
*ENI:	that does make it difficult. 
*PAT:	No it made it very easy. You know, especially when perhaps you were having a mixed sort of meeting 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	wh  I remember that when I was   (.) at home it was a mixed sort of meeting in which some of the people from the village were coming who you didn't really know but   (.) they had to be asked 
*ENI:	Mm. Mm. Yes. 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) well you I mean you, you could cover er cover the whole thing  couldn't you? 
*NOE:	 Mm  mm. 
*ENI:	Without saying dear so and so. 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*ENI:	  (  )  
*PAT:	 And without  really having to sign it. You could just put your initial in the corner. 
*ENI:	Of course. 
*NOE:	Mm that's right it  (  )  
*ENI:	Are they called gentle    (  )   
*NOE:	 Yes   
*ENI:	cards? ((laugh))   
*PAT:	  ((laughing)) Something like that, yes . ((laugh))  
*ENI:	 (  ) safe distance cards. ((laugh))  
*PAT:	I must go and get some made. 
*NOE:	  ((laugh))  
*ENI:	  (  )  indeed. 
*PAT:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*ENI:	Oh gosh. Have you used any of these erm things called Post It? (.)  
*PAT:	Oh yes they, they use them a lot at work. 
*ENI:	Th  but they're useful? 
*NOE:	What are they? 
*ENI:	Well er they're er like your autumn leaves that you used to leave on everybody's benches 
*NOE:	Oh did I? 
*ENI:	erm but they've got a sticky bit on them 
*NOE:	Oh I know, yes. 
*ENI:	and so you, you'd have stuck it on the bench you see erm   (.) and it comes off anything without making a mark on    (  )   
*NOE:	 Oh yes we've  got a little pack of them in London I think on the, by the telephone. 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	That's right, some teeny weeny ones? 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Mm Folly gave them  to you? 
*NOE:	 They they    (.)  they used to call them my autumn leaves er   
*ENI:	  (  )  erm Patsy and more 
*NOE:	Oh have some more 
*ENI:	an  another piece of  ham, do   (  )   
*NOE:	 have some more ham or  you're getting some nice cheese in a minute. 
*ENI:	 Oh   (  ) cheese. 
*PAT:	  (  ) are we having some cheese? 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	Well I think I'll wait for some cheese  (  )  
*NOE:	Mm. Ye  yes I used to leave  notes   
*PAT:	 I'm  I'm tr  I'm tr  I'm trying not to overeat you see? 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Right. Please yourself. 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	I'm trying to avoid    (  )  (.) being noticed if I overeat. 
*ENI:	You're trying to, you're trying to avoid being  starved all the time aren't you darling? 
*PAT:	 You're allowed to have some water aren't  you  (  ) ? 
*NOE:	No no no no no  (  )  
*ENI:	It's difficult for you but he's trying to avoid being starved. Will that plate do? 
*PAT:	It'll  be fine. 
*ENI:	  (  )  dish you out a larger one. 
*PAT:	No no it will be absolutely fine, thank you. 
*ENI:	Okay. Well help yourself, I can recommend   (  )  cheese. 
*NOE:	 Well  autumn leave is the best way out of, of   (.) of er communicating. If I were to turn to a man on a bench 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	and say to him so and so and so and so he'd always answer back and say I want to do it this way 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*NOE:	and er the time was wasted, but you give an autumn leaf   (.) a little note saying what it, what you, what you wanted done there wasn't much chance he could argue. 
*PAT:	Yes I heard a very interesting conversation on the way down here in that programme Just a Minute  (.)  
*ENI:	Oh 
*PAT:	you know the one I mean? 
*ENI:	I hate it but I'll tell you why in a minute. 
*PAT:	Mm mm. 
*ENI:	Go on. 
*PAT:	Well I don't like it very much but   (.) it has this very interesting discussion as to whether a fax was   (.) cheaper or more expensive than the telephone 
*NOE:	Mm? 
*PAT:	and   (.) the biggest pro for a fax that I can think of is that you can send the message   (.) and that's that, there's no risk of it dribbling on into, into  doubt   (  )   
*NOE:	 Mm   (  )   
*ENI:	As it would on the telephone, yes. 
*PAT:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	How right. Mm. 
*PAT:	So I thought that was quite interesting  to think   
*NOE:	 Mm and  they can't argue  with a fax. 
*PAT:	 think about. (.)  
*ENI:	I hate that programme because   (.) I like   (.) I tend to come and   (.) listen to the content of what they're saying 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and they're only saying it for the sake of keeping going. 
*PAT:	Yes    (  )   
*ENI:	 And then  er so it's never, it's never worth   (.) serious attention is it? 
*PAT:	Well just occasionally it is. Sometimes you do get something interesting. And and and  and then   
*ENI:	  (  )  
*PAT:	and then they get interrupted and you wish, you know, you wish they hadn't. 
*ENI:	That's it, you see   (  ) that's full of frustration 
*PAT:	Yes  it's   (  )   
*ENI:	 for me   (  )   
*PAT:	 (  ) I don't like it, I, I prefer things like the news quiz 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	or   (.) even   (.) that one about that game with Mornington Crescent in it. 
*ENI:	Mornington Crescent? 
*PAT:	Yes. (.)  
*ENI:	I've heard that phrase used but I don't know what it's for. 
*PAT:	Oh well it's, it's where   (.) they say   (.) say a sequence of underground station names or  or locations   
*ENI:	 Oh   
*PAT:	in London   (.) in, in a sort of clever way that makes it sound as though there's some terrific good reasoning for it 
*ENI:	Oh. 
*PAT:	and they just say it totally randomly and the last one just   (.) the first pers  person who says Mornington Crescent is the winner   (.) but they've made a great big sort of   (.) fiction as to how   (.) why, when it is suitable to say  Mornington Crescent   
*ENI:	 You have to come  to it 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	I, yes I see. (  )   
*PAT:	 Th  there's no logic  to it at all but they play it on. 
*ENI:	How extraordinary, I've not heard that one. Mhm. 
*PAT:	It's a programme where they also   (.) sing the songs of one tune   (.) wh  to another tune. (.)  
*ENI:	Oh   (.) you mean the programme where they do that? 
*PAT:	Mm. (.)  
*ENI:	Erm well that's not   (.) that's not My Music is it? 
*PAT:	No. 
*ENI:	No.  Erm   
*PAT:	 That's  erm 
*ENI:	can't remember what it's called. (.)  
*PAT:	Mm   (.) it's Jazz With Humphrey Littleton. (.)  
*ENI:	Oh.  (.) I, I'm, I'm not with you on that one because erm I'm sure I'm   (.) vaguely at the back of my mind I think I know what it is, I have heard of it I mean 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	or heard it 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	but I can't bring it to mind, it won't come to the front   (.)  as it were. 
*PAT:	 Well I can't  remember what it's called. (.)  
*ENI:	Erm   (.) yes apart from My Music I can't think of one. I heard a very amusing thing on the radio this morning 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	came in half way through it, at least half way erm but it was so obviously the voice of erm   (.) Freud, Clement Freud 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	talking   (.) and he was telling about a visit he had paid to China for a whole week 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and how he'd seen   (.) prison and er they'd said they hadn't any prisons but he found one and   (.) erm   (.) hospitals and all that sort of thing   (.) and at the end of the week's visit erm one of the very high ups, whom he named and I've forgotten the name of him, I think I'll just use that, thank you   (.) erm sent for h  he, he was brought before him as it were and the man said to him are there any questions er at the end of your week that you want to ask   (.) and he said   (.) well perhaps there is one   (.) he said erm Winston Churchill was here erm a month or two, a few months ago 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and he also, he like me stayed in the   (.) and he named the hotel  in   
*PAT:	 Mm. 
*ENI:	Peking   (.) he said can you tell me why   (.) his room was larger than mine 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and his room had three windows erm   (.) and I, mine only had two 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	he said in spite of the fact that I've been in parliament for longer than he has, which surprised me cos I wouldn't have thought so   (.) this is the young Winston Churchill of course so the Chinese man said to him erm oh well the reason for that was that he had a famous grandfather 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	and so   ((laughing)) Clement Freud  said, not to him but now on this programme this morning, that's the first time I've ever been de-grandfathered  ((laugh))  
*GRO:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	That was rather nice wasn't it? 
*PAT:	Presumably his grandfather was Sigmund Freud was it? 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	The Chinese didn't know. 
*PAT:	No I shouldn't think the Chinese have got much time for that sort of approach to life. 
*ENI:	I don't think they have either. I don't think they'd have been impressed even if he'd told them  ((laugh))  
*PAT:	No. Erm   (.) did you see that th  they're, they're going to look for some sort of gene called the Churchill factor? 
*ENI:	No. 
*PAT:	Well they want to find out why it is that someone who smoked so much and drank   ((laughing)) so much  
*ENI:	Mm! 
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) 
*PAT:	had to live so long. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*PAT:	Well it's obvious. It's the same sort of factor that allows anybody who smokes a lot to not get cancer and not get bronchitis and live, also live a long time. There are plenty of them. 
*ENI:	Well that's true. 
*PAT:	I  it's just a question of, you know, something in your make-up that is inoculating you and other people have a weakness. 
*ENI:	Well that's right. Other people go down with it. You can't really I should think find a gene surely that's 
*PAT:	There must be something though Enid. 
*ENI:	Mm there must be. 
*NOE:	His father was a very weak man wasn't he? 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*NOE:	His mother was a character but    (.)   (  )   
*ENI:	 She was not nice. 
*NOE:	Not nice but she had a strong character. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	But  his   
*ENI:	 This  reminds me 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	might I just say this darling cos I've just remembered, I'll forget   (.) senile you see?  (.) Erm   (.) we have a video of the last programme of the Churchill series 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	erm which a friend in London very kindly made for us because we were out with her, her mother 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and couldn't see it 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and erm   (.) Joan's video has gone wrong in some way 
*PAT:	Really? 
*ENI:	Yes, she doesn't know how to work it to begin with but she 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	was working 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	 ((laughing)) she was working  on that, of course we don't know a thing about it, erm   (.) and the make, the erm   (.) the handyman chap came along and took a part away, it was faulty   
*PAT:	 Mm. 
*ENI:	so we can't see it. 
*PAT:	Do you want to come and see it on mine? 
*ENI:	I was going, I'm getting round to that you see aren't I? 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	Erm   (.) we feel rather badly about not returning it to this person who made it for us 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	because it's now a fortnight since we had it I think 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*PAT:	Well come and see it on mine. 
*ENI:	May we do that? 
*PAT:	Mm, sure. 
*ENI:	But when, that's not going to disturb you? (.)  
*PAT:	Don't know. Erm   (.) let's think. (.)  
*ENI:	Tomorrow morning? No. (.)  
*NOE:	I'm taking, I'm going to London tomorrow afternoon, I 
*ENI:	Afternoon. 
*NOE:	I, no I've only just thought of it, I'd take it with me if, if we'd seen it. 
*ENI:	Mm. (.)  
*PAT:	I've got to go out this evening. 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Well tomorrow, what happens to you tomorrow? Is it your lazy day  when you   
*PAT:	 Yes. 
*NOE:	Mm well we won't see it tom  we'll keep it another week   (.) keep it another week   (.)  I'll get my diary. 
*ENI:	  (  )   (.) 
*NOE:	I'll get my diary, can't talk without a diary. 
*ENI:	Okay.  (.) We can't do it next Saturday   (.) because erm we've got two people, a Scotsman married to a Chinese 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	coming to spend Saturday. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	So that's a dead day for next week. And   (.) might be able to do it before the weekend  perhaps   
*PAT:	 Yeah  think so, I'm just   (.) when does Noel get back from London? (.)  
*ENI:	Erm hoping Monday evening.  (.) He's going to see Mr  . He has a little bit of a scratchiness in one of his eyes 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	erm and   (.) phoned up and sort of semi made an appointment, not exactly 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	erm because Mr   was abroad   (.) and the girl said well I mean   (.) come in on Monday, when he'll be back 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and he may be able to see you then. 
*PAT:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	So   (.) come Monday morning, Sunday night in fact, Noel said gosh I can   (  ) this is, this seems to have gone light. We've got some ointment from the doctor which didn't work last time he put it out 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	and seems to have worked this time. So he said I can't go along and bother a busy man when it's feeling much better. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	So erm   (.) he didn't go 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	but he got a phone call on the   (.) Tuesday from Mr   's secretary to say oh Mr   would like to see you anyway because er he feels it may have   (.) erm   (.) it was a letter, I'm sorry, which came 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	in case it has any bearing on   (.) any difficulty you might have in the future so   (.) he's to go down  (  )  
*PAT:	So he's got an appointment? 
*ENI:	Mm   (.) Monday morning.  (.) And then he's going to call at Sotherby's. Do you know   (.) Sotherby's are the most dilettante people you've ever come across, they really are. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	With the exception of the one   (.) erm   (.) section leader that he deals with normally. At the beginning of this week a girl phoned up and said that erm   (.) the chap he normally deals with is away 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	but there's an organ is Sussex they want him to look at   (.) and erm so he said well   (.) send me a photograph er they've got a photograph of it you see 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	send the photograph and that gives me an idea whether it's worth going to look at it at all.  (.) That I think was about Tuesday. 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	It never came. This is what they do, they phone up   (.)  asking   (  )   
*PAT:	 They could have  they could have even faxed it. 
*ENI:	Mm   (.) well we haven't got a fax. 
*PAT:	Oh no. 
*ENI:	But   (.) the thing is, what they do tend to do is, they suddenly find themselves in a panic because they've behaved like this about it and the person at the other end is shouting when are you coming to see this organ 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	I was talking about how dilatory S  er Sotherby's are. 
*NOE:	Oh.  Yes but I know the thing dear no   
*PAT:	 Well of course they're not, they're not in a  businesslike business are they? 
*ENI:	No   (.) not really, no.  (.) And I wonder if it seems to be that they prefer you come out of the upper drawer than come up with your brilliant A levels or whatever. 
*PAT:	They do, yes. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	Exactly that. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	They are erm   (.) a very, you know one, one of the last bastions where those sort of people can find a refuge. 
*ENI:	Yes. I suppose so. 
*NOE:	I find them 
*PAT:	You know,l  like, like the Duke of Kent's daughter. 
*ENI:	Mm.  Does she work there? 
*PAT:	 She works in  art galleries or, or some art  gallery   
*ENI:	 Or some  art gallery. 
*PAT:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*PAT:	And the man she's marrying   (.) is an art gallery. 
*ENI:	So he is. That's right.  So he is. 
*PAT:	  (  )  there has to be space for these people   (.) though somehow I always feel that they cream it all the same. 
*ENI:	Mm I think they do cream it, yes. 
*PAT:	 (  )  (8.0) 
*ENI:	Oh that's    (  )   
*PAT:	 Well du   during next week is what we think Noel. 
*NOE:	Pardon? 
*PAT:	During next week erm I'm just trying to think, I've got very heavy days on Monday and Tuesday   (.) so 
*NOE:	 (  ) 
*PAT:	Wednesday's a possibility   (.) then in that case. 
*NOE:	Er let's   (.) shall, can we leave it open? 
*PAT:	Mhm, certainly. 
*ENI:	And then we'll arrange it with you, mm? 
*NOE:	 Yes.  Erm I don't know whether   (  ) I think   (  ) post rather erm er I see I'm not going to London after   (.) erm after this week   (  )  (.)  
*PAT:	Ooh. 
*ENI:	  (  )  
*NOE:	 Oh you're going to be making  some of your special coffee are you love? 
*ENI:	I am indeed. 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	 (  ) 
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	Ooh er  (.)  
*NOE:	How's your barn proceeding? 
*PAT:	Don't know, it doesn't seem to be doing anything and what the   (  ) was that during the week when   (  ) was in residence   (.) one night the dogs barked and he went out to see what was happening and there was a young man who worked in it   (.) this was in the pitch dark, was up there taking some of his stuff away. 
*NOE:	Oh. 
*ENI:	Oh. 
*PAT:	So I wonder. 
*NOE:	Has he run out of cash? 
*PAT:	Well, I wouldn't be surprised. 
*ENI:	Why would he need to do it in the dark? 
*PAT:	Well if for instance it's approaching receivership  (.)  
*ENI:	Oh oh oh 
*PAT:	you'd want to sort of, you know 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Oh yes. 
*PAT:	get your stuff and you'd want it not to be obvious that you'd got your stuff. 
*ENI:	Oh I see, yes. 
*PAT:	But that's, that's only a  guess though   
*NOE:	  (  )  
*PAT:	I don't know. 
*NOE:	you mean the young man who actually owns it or the man who's employed working on it? 
*PAT:	Well   (.) I don't know who exactly owns it 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*PAT:	but the man who has been doing the work there who said he owned it 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	Oh I know, oh. But the, the   (.) lady who was erm   (.) what's her name daughter, she used to live in the    (.)  (  ) erm   (.) erm live in the terraced house   (.) erm  (.)  
*PAT:	What Jo   ? 
*NOE:	 Mrs  what? 
*PAT:	 you mean? 
*NOE:	No er the people before them. 
*PAT:	The  ? 
*NOE:	What? 
*PAT:	The  ? 
*NOE:	 yes, Ann   's daughter 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*NOE:	who's got the farm up at  (  )  
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*NOE:	and there's a   (.) there's a farm for sale opposite there, you never saw such a wreck in all your life. 
*ENI:	Oh  it is a wreck. 
*PAT:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	Yes it really is. 
*PAT:	Yes. 
*ENI:	I think the vogue is dying isn't it? 
*PAT:	Yes. Erm   (.) they're being much stricter about what you can do to them. 
*ENI:	Erm. (.)  
*NOE:	And how you do it perhaps. 
*PAT:	And how you do it and everything, yes. I think that erm   (.) across the road from me he's just mucked around. 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*PAT:	He hasn't done things in the sort of, you know, the preferred way. 
*ENI:	That was the sign from the beginning wasn't it? 
*PAT:	Yes. And he hasn't had   (.) building inspections at the right sorts of times. 
*ENI:	Ah. (.)  
*PAT:	So I think he's going to find himself in a lot of trouble. 
*NOE:	That's good. 
*PAT:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Well he didn't, he did deserve it didn't he, really? 
*PAT:	 Yep. (.)  
*ENI:	But he paid dearly for it in the first place didn't he? 
*PAT:	I think it's such a shame that he's gone and put that wretched wirenetting fence so close to the road 
*ENI:	I agree. 
*PAT:	across the road from me. 
*NOE:	That what? 
*PAT:	Wirenetting fence across the road. 
*NOE:	Yes   (.) it is wretched. 
*PAT:	Cos it's so close to the road, it doesn't give me any swinging round room 
*ENI:	Well actually  if he's   (  )   
*PAT:	 on my side of  the road. 
*ENI:	If he's having problems 
*PAT:	Mm? 
*ENI:	you may be able to get that rectified mayn't you? 
*PAT:	Ya. 
*ENI:	And say  yes   
*NOE:	 Better  arrange for the coal lorr  lorry to back in to it  one day. 
*PAT:	 Ya I was  I've been thinking of trying to have a big delivery  of something. ((laugh))   
*NOE:	 I mean I would  do you er have  ? 
*PAT:	I don't have any coal delivered unfortunately. 
*NOE:	Oh. 
*PAT:	I've go  I've got some coal in the coal shed and it, you know,i  it sort of lasts me. 
*NOE:	Oh. 
*PAT:	I never seem to run out. 
*NOE:	Because if you had old er   (.) what's his name? (.)  
*ENI:	Don  . 
*NOE:	Don  , 's man   (.) er if you explained the bother 
*PAT:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	er he would back his   (.) with a little encouragement from me he'd back his lorry right into it and   (  ) flatten it for you. 
*ENI:	 ((laughing)) Darling he's a very  nice man. 
*NOE:	I know he is, that's why he'd do it. 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*PAT:	Well unfortunately if, if I did have a delivery of coal it would come in through the other entrance. 
*NOE:	Oh   ((laugh)) that needn't prevent you from   (.) backing in er backing into it when he turns round. (.)  
*PAT:	No it's been, it's been a tough week this last week. 
*NOE:	Oh dear.  (.) I'm sorry.  (.) I feel very sorry for people who have to work for their living now, I really do. 
*PAT:	Mm. Yes. (.)
