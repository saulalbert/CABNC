*PS091:	and erm ooh she 's marvellous . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS091:	She 's be ei eighty six and she lives alone and she 's she 's absolutely ge again the Arch Deacon it 's the Arch Deacon there that 's the trouble He got a bulldozer to bull to bulldoze up the erm aisles and bulldoze the sanctuary and he 's thrown away God knows what I mean there are there there were erm all sorts of things there And his and he got rid of the beautiful eagle erm you know reading desk and he got rid of the Bishops 's erm chair the Bishop 's what do they call it . 
*PS092:	Oh yes . 
*PS090:	Throne . 
*PS091:	The Bishop 's throne And he 's put all wrought iron one there . 
*PS090:	Yeah Well I . 
*PS091:	Absolutely furious Sh she wo n't . 
*PS090:	I have n't been in . 
*PS091:	go near it Do you know what she does On is the erm erm nearly next door is the old erm Quaker Chapel . 
*PS090:	Oh yes . 
*PS091:	the most beautiful building and nobody can pull it down but . 
*PS092:	Not the chapel Mollie . 
*PS091:	No . 
*PS092:	Not . 
*PS090:	Meeting House . 
*PS091:	Meeting House . 
*PS092:	Meeting House . 
*PS091:	yes And opposite her is where the erm Quakers meet now because they ca n't afford to run the chapel the erm Meeting . 
*PS090:	Meeting House . 
*PS091:	Meeting House as a big one and they are getting fewer But she says I sometimes just walk across the road and go to the Meeting House at you know . 
*PS090:	Well I 've got a theory . 
*PS091:	rather than the cathedral . 
*PS092:	Yeah . 
*PS090:	I 've got a theory I have a feeling there 's going to be a great revival of people with a Quakered mind way of thinking . 
*PS092:	Yes . 
*PS091:	I I . 
*PS092:	Yes . 
*PS091:	do agree . 
*PS092:	But the trouble is Noel in the meantime erm the Quakers have fallen apart because the Quakers have filled themselves up with sort of barefooted raw carrot eaters with beads . 
*PS091:	Well I know they have yes I agree . 
*PS092:	with the and have n't but have n't ever read . 
*PS091:	That 's right . 
*PS092:	the bible . 
*PS091:	0 . 
*PS092:	sort of Eastern religion type meditation and thing and it 's no good at all The old fashioned Quakers who were sikhs and everything . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	Now what I have learnt at college this week which is rather interesting I think Well I think you 'll be interested Erm in the bible in the new part the new testament there 's a er an epistle of James . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	Well I am told that that is the earliest thing at all . 
*PS090:	I 'd say that . 
*PS092:	That is his erm actually a brother of Jesus in his family . 
*PS091:	Yes . 
*PS092:	and so it 's very much as he was thinking and it should be in the old testament really cos it was written you know before Jesus . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS091:	That 's right . 
*PS090:	before the before the crucifixion Erm and it 's been quickly Christianized with just two little lectures at the beginning of two chapters to Christianize so it was popped in for new testament and it 's the nearest we can get to to teaching And of course it 's totally Jewish . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	but I 'd say it 's th it 's th Je the Jewish teaching as Christ would have preached it . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	you see and it 's for all the family And there 's towards the end of the first chapter there 's a bit all about erm erm er temptation and deliver us from evil kind of thing which is obviously rather from the from the Lord 's Prayer and yet it 's rather explained rather nicely and it it 's a lovely lovely book It 's only five . 
*PS091:	0 . 
*PS090:	Do you know I have n't ever read it I will do of course . 
*PS091:	I 've heard about that . 
*PS092:	It 's lovely It really is lovely And you really feel that . 
*PS091:	0 . 
*PS092:	here is a . 
*PS091:	I sha n't be able to walk home . 
*PS090:	Really . 
*PS092:	It seems to be . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	everything sort of in a nutshell you do n't need any of the rest . 
*PS091:	Oh well . 
*PS092:	of the new . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	testament that 's just quite enough it 's just a just th the Jewish thing filled out slightly and and and a little bit less rules and you know i it 's very very lovely . 
*PS091:	Well apparently Chelms . 
*PS090:	I 've never read it but I shall . 
*PS092:	We 'll have a go yes . 
*PS091:	Well that 's what Chelmsford 's got you see Chelmsford was was full of Quaker I mean I can I can erm quote the Quaker the families who still live there . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS091:	Oh all the important people were Quaker families when I lived there you see And the erm the . 
*PS090:	The I was gon na say them . 
*PS091:	Oh the were appalling . 
*PS090:	Ah yeah the the and I knew them . 
*PS091:	Oh yes . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS091:	and erm . 
*PS092:	What about the . 
*PS090:	They 're still there apparently . 
*PS092:	The were . 
*PS091:	Oh yes they 're still there . 
*PS092:	and the were the Norfolk more were n't they . 
*PS091:	Mm mm . 
*PS092:	Were the Norfolk more were they . 
*PS091:	I think they were Yes I I mean I ca n't remember they and the and . 
*PS090:	By the time . 
*PS091:	I ca n't remember now but they 're at least five I was thinking of them the other night well they er five at least erm they were . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS091:	th they were Quakers . 
*PS090:	But er . 
*PS091:	and something else I ca n't remember them . 
*PS090:	I di I always think of the I met one or two of those . 
*PS091:	They 're . 
*PS090:	A when I go through . 
*PS091:	Oh Mrs . 
*PS090:	off the train and still standing there with her name on her side . 
*PS092:	0 . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	Yeah that 's right . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	Yeah . 
*PS091:	Oh they 're lovely people . 
*PS090:	But er . 
*PS091:	They ran everything . 
*PS090:	I 'd been per wo ah I I feel that all this doctrine res religions are spoilt . 
*PS092:	That 's what I said . 
*PS090:	by doctrine . 
*PS092:	Exactly . 
*PS091:	Oh no . 
*PS092:	Nobody believes . 
*PS091:	That 's wrong . 
*PS092:	any of it now I mean I think . 
*PS091:	No I know . 
*PS092:	0 . 
*PS091:	I know . 
*PS092:	Yeah it 's terribly sad It 's terribly sad . 
*PS091:	I think it 's . 
*PS092:	Even the Bishop of Durham I 've just recently bought one of his books and I rather wish I had n't I 'm not liking it much erm he 's still much too orthodox really . 
*PS090:	Is he . 
*PS092:	You know he 's still hanging on to . 
*PS091:	Oh he is . 
*PS092:	and trying to . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	show . 
*PS090:	Well I mean you ca n't you . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS090:	you ca n't get fish from prize thinking fish . 
*PS092:	No . 
*PS090:	can you . 
*PS091:	No . 
*PS092:	But I know they blamed him for that And he says you can because he says it 's important for it to be a living thing that 's got to change with the time . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS092:	In all that way he 's quite correct . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	I think It 's just that he has n't to me changed enough he 's still stuck up with all these various things That really . 
*PS090:	Well I know let's face it if he if he was really convinced of the falsity of most it he . 
*PS092:	Mm . 
*PS090:	could n't be a conscience to obtain his seat could he . 
*PS092:	Well he reckons you can say it in a different way You can say . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS092:	it entirely symbolically and spiritually and and . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	things do n't . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	have to have happened in fact And that the stories were told to make a point and . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	the trouble is people have lost the point and kept the story Erm you know it 's saying that . 
*PS090:	Well the earliest man who used to think like this was Albert . 
*PS092:	Yes oh yes course it . 
*PS091:	Yeah . 
*PS092:	was . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS092:	He wrote that marvellous book . 
*PS091:	Oh . 
*PS090:	Well . 
*PS091:	a lovely book . 
*PS090:	I 've got about six of his books in there . 
*PS091:	Well I had all of his books . 
*PS092:	famous . 
*PS090:	No er you mean erm . 
*PS091:	I know quite a few . 
*PS092:	The er . 
*PS090:	Christ the Historic Jesus . 
*PS092:	Yes With that famous last . 
*PS090:	That is his best book . 
*PS092:	chapter which is so lovely when . 
*PS090:	Yeah . 
*PS092:	he sort of says well you still can spiritually meet Jesus even though you know it 's a rather lovely . 
*PS091:	0 . 
*PS092:	the last chapter I say he moves him the more you search for him historically . 
*PS090:	Yeah . 
*PS092:	but there is a there 's something hanging about still But in a funny way perhaps there is I do n't know I 'm very very very very tied up with it I I I invariably turn relatively happy with it all . 
*PS090:	I do n't think one has to worry too much . 
*PS092:	Been brought up so much bought up a Christian . 
*PS091:	Yes . 
*PS092:	you just find it difficult to to admit that one 's rather you know But certainly that epistle of James to me was just marvellous Just everything . 
*PS090:	I I ca n't . 
*PS092:	Mm . 
*PS090:	ever remember reading James If I had I 've forgotten about it . 
*PS092:	Mm . 
*PS090:	But I shall read him tonight . 
*PS092:	Well certainly you 'll enjoy it . 
*PS091:	Oh . 
*PS090:	Did you go to .

*PS090:	Yeah . 
*PS091:	Mm Mm .

*PS092:	was very nicely done Louis was very upset cos she forgot to erm have anyone to take the names erm . 
*PS090:	Well . 
*PS092:	so I wrote down . 
*PS091:	0 . 
*PS092:	as many as I could think of . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	and erm and I asked Margaret they had a better view where she was . 
*PS091:	Mm . 
*PS092:	and she told a lot of other people and so I think we got a pretty comprehensive list actually . 
*PS090:	Oh we could n't er we . 
*PS092:	No . 
*PS090:	we could n't go anyhow . 
*PS092:	No It was very packed in there but I could n't see a lot of anything . 
*PS090:	But I was glad we could n't because they asked me to read the lesson . 
*PS091:	No it it 's miserable . 
*PS092:	Oh yeah . 
*PS091:	It spoils everything does n't it . 
*PS090:	I 'm glad to say . 
*PS092:	Mm . 
*PS090:	and stuck to it . 
*PS091:	I think there were some people there who did n't really know but they maybe went because they 'd got to a funeral . 
*PS092:	Well it was n't erm . 
*PS091:	Oh .
