@Comment:	conversation #1 (Tape 051602)
*JAN:	Hello
*FRE:	Hello   (.) how are you?
*JAN:	Er   (        ) 
*FRE:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	How are you?
*FRE:	Alright.
*JAN:	I'm not gonna pass it down to you.
*FRE:	You're not?
*JAN:	No.
*FRE:	Are you sure of that?
*JAN:	I'm gonna leave you to it.Pete 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	 [laughing] it's Fred  [] .I'll leave, I, I won't stay with you cos I don't want you get too   (        ) 
*FRE:	Okay then.
*PET:	Collapse, me too.
*JAN:	Go in and sit down a sec. (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	I'm moderately well.
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Let me come quite clean   (.) on that and tell you that you, at the very moment I hope you are being recorded. (.) 
*PET:	Good heavens. (.)  (        ) a cross section. (.) 
*FRE:	Yes er actually the lady dropped in on me yesterday so I  (.) 
*PET:	Well I suppose it's erm
*FRE:	Sounds quite an interesting
*PET:	an interesting idea.
*FRE:	Yeah, I thought so. (.) 
*PET:	I'm not convinced   (.) that   (.) we can establish   (.) exactly what we're after   (.) erm   (.) the sort of conversation or communication 
*FRE:	What 
*PET:	that people use.
*FRE:	Yeah, it seems to me that erm   (.) they are   (.) it's er going to be a comparative thing   ((cough)) from   (.) nineteen ninety two, and then in, we'll say nineteen ninety seven for argument's sake. (.) 
*PET:	The trouble is 
*FRE:	Or, or or gradually er on. (.) 
*PET:	increasingly I think nowadays   (.) people   (.) converse in   (.) not a foreign language, because the   (.) terms that people use are   (.) familiar but meanings that they   (.) intend   (.) are not, and th th th the computer people are the worst because they use ordinary words   (.) which mean completely different things in the 
*FRE:	Than 
*PET:	context of,o o of people just 
*FRE:	Yeah 
*PET:	talking
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*PET:	and   (.) there they, they talk about a database   (.) which is a   (.) it's not an English word
*FRE:	No a computer
*PET:	so what on earth does it mean?
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	Well   (.) I used the word to mo er in a report I was writing    ((sigh))  [whispering] years ago    []  (.) it was ten years ago   (.) and I knew what I meant but I hadn't sat down and defined what I meant, perhaps I should have done.
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	Since then a    (.)  ((sigh)) program's been written called Database One which means something completely different   (.) which has been updated to Database Two and Three and may be Four, which mean different things, that's why they've got different numbers, they do more clever things   (.) and   (.) nowadays you talk, you hear people talking about databases and they all mean different things.They usually mean   (.) a file   (.) of information which is processed by different, completely different 
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	computer systems.One, as it were, to pick out addresses, one to pick out   (.) socio-economic groups, one to pick out motor cars, one to pick out number of bedrooms, one to pick out whatever, and   (.) trivially or, or superficially everyone says the same thing, a database, it's on the database, now 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	the file is there, that's a computer term, or   (.) exactly that, a l a, a listing of names, addresses and houses and cars and everything else, and a file is a defined computer term, what you do with it is the next thing
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	and   (.) the way in which you do what you do with it   (.) depends on what you put in.If you only put people in who are owner-occupiers then you will not have all the information, all the people, who are in rented accommodation.
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*PET:	If you only put in people who live in houses, you'll not have all the people who live in maisonettes and flats
*FRE:	Mm yeah 
*PET:	 (        ) .If you are   (.) not eligible to be put in if you don't have a motor car then you're discounting an enormous number of people who may have motorcycles or motor caravans or, you know, something which is perfectly valid but it invalidates the information that you think you are getting out of the file because you only put in   (.) certain   (.) perfectly reasonable, groups of er of things and i in, in, in Boots there's a, there's a er there's a   (.) a wonderful expression or    (.)  (        ) actually is, is the one I'm particularly thinking about, you know we, we sell   (.) shall we say a million bottles of aspirin a year, it is in fact considerably more than that, and that is perfectly reasonable and valid and   (.) mm   (.) but   (.) in the definition of that we obviously only included what Boots the Chemists sold because that's all the people who
*FRE:	Yeah, that's 
*PET:	sold bottles 
*FRE:	Yeah 
*PET:	of aspirin
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	made by Boots.But now of course there's Crooks and that means, not bottles of aspirins, bad example, but Strepsils the lozenges for example, are now sold in an enormous range of private pharmacies which are not Boots and they are therefore completely outside the term output, it may be a restricted term, it may not be the one we want, but that is what it was meant and that is what the number is generated from. (.) Now of course er   (.) we've sold the er chain of chemists in Canada who might have sold bottles of aspirin but, before we sold the chain, there was another enormous quantity of bottles of aspirin which wasn't defined, it was   (.) something which was introduced after, long after we defined what we meant by outputs of aspirin.And   (.) the rate of change of, of, of   (.) society   (.) no the background to what we're doing, shifts the   (.) goalposts is the fashionable term but what you thought you meant you no longer mean, and of course, if one is meticulously methodical, one adjusts the definition as the circumstances change
*FRE:	Yes, yeah 
*PET:	 (        ) we don't do that.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	Not with a thing like a outputs of aspirin, I mean everyone in Boots knows what the outputs of aspirin are   (.) just strange that they are in fact three times what we'd thought they were and we've   (        ) course there's Crooks, course there's this, course there's that   (.) tremendous discernment, tremendous understanding but if you haven't got that tremendous understanding, you've just joined the company, you   [laughing] think you know   [] something and you don't because    (.)  (        ) not what they think they are
*FRE:	Mm, mm
*PET:	and er  (.) 
*FRE:	Anyway, how are you? (.) 
*PET:	I, I'm not too bad. (.) I feel that er   (.) it's been a, a slightly peculiar month really. (.) Sort of, when we went to see Jan's mother for Christmas, I was saying to myself yeah, mm   (.) this time last year   (.) I was on holiday from work
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	now I am retired and er   (.) yes last year I was feeling a bit decrepit, you know I used to go for a full wal walk round   (        ) after lunch, after dinner, around where she lives and    (.)  [whispering] it's much harder now  [] .
*FRE:	Mm, how long is it since you   ((cough)) knocked off work   (.) sick?
*PET:	Well I got flu in February last year
*FRE:	February ninety one?
*PET:	Yeah.
*FRE:	S so   (.) ah.
*PET:	And I never went back.
*FRE:	Yeah.But you were presumably feeling not well before then? (.) Yeah.
*PET:	Well you, you, you, you, you know the, you know the, the scenario that    (.)  ((sigh)) everything goes wrong, you know, everything goes wrong you know from time to time and you say to yourself oh it'll get better
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	it gets better   (.) and you say ooh I'm tired
*FRE:	Yes, that's right.
*PET:	oh I've had a bit of a day or erm ooh, whatever it is, and erm   (.) I   (.) said to myself I am making allowances for being tired and getting, getting on a bit, you know, and   ((sigh)) that went on for quite a while actually until I said to myself    ((laugh))  [laughing] I'm making up allowances you know, I'm  [] 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*PET:	there is something seriously, seriously queer   (.) you know maybe it's a brain tumour, you know, maybe it's er I'm going potty, maybe it's all sorts of things, and fortunately I er I s I went to the vet and erm    (.)  ((laugh)) two weeks before he retired   ((laugh)) but you know he, he was full of experience, that's really what I'm saying, he wouldn't be retiring otherwise 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah 
*PET:	and er he said to himself there's something I, I, I don't know what it is necessarily but there is something, go to a specialist and the specialist was very very good   (.) you know blah blah blah blah you want some te I want some tests, you know, so I had some tests, you know and   (.) the crew that were doing the tests they knew what they were looking for and they either found it or they didn't, don't know.But in due course   (.) er   (.) when I was still off with flu, erm back to the specialist   (        ) another test, you know, and   (.) that was er   (.) March, April of last year and the result of it was that there is something in there which is characteristic of what's, what we call multiple sclerosis which   (.) seems to me is about as broad as it's long, you know, it's, it's a very large   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yes i i i it's one of those erm illnesses that erm   (.) the average person knows of it and, and knows   (.) just a little bit but doesn't know very much.
*PET:	Well an an an and I, it seems to me that the, the er I mean you go, you go to the er to the M S Society and you find   (.) just about everybody there, you know, you find people who, who are in wheelchairs, you find people who are walking around, you find people who are   (.) er   (.) controlling their diet   (.) you find people who are obs s taking extreme   (.) dietary   (.) precautions, no, not precautions, no they are taking extreme care of their diet, er er I mean   (        ) on gluten-free diets and you know what that means
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	you can't have anything which has any 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	wheat or barley or anything connected   (.) and you find other people who are walking around relatively   (.) independently and you find people who are walking around   (.) slowly  ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	and you find erm   (.) people like Lynn  you know, bless her, who now, who   (.) isn't too bad when she's not too bad and isn't too good when she's not too good, you know, and   (.) it is such a very very    (        )  (.) Not only can you not put anything visibly in   (.) in common with everyone that's got it, even the people   [laughing] that have got it can't say   [] I cannot do this   (.) period, they say oh well I'm not too good   (        ) now but maybe last week or maybe next week
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*PET:	So it's erm   (.) it's all a bit peculiar. (.) You now have to get, in er er, because there was a sort of erm gradation from being off ill, which wasn't familiar, to being off long term sick which you can't have any experience of   (.) to erm early retirement on health grounds and you just can't have any experience of that either   (.) erm to being retired and it's,i i it's, it's quite interesting
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	 [laughing] going from one to the other in a year   []  ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	Yeah, I thought it was longer than that you know.
*PET:	Well erm the er   (.) th th th the first and most   (.) horrific incidence was I think   (.) in the May, no no no it wasn't May, it was   (.) when we went down to s to Cats in London   (.) which was   (.) at the end of   (.) eighty nine   (.) beginning of   (.) ninety   (.) and I went to, I went to the   (.) the doctor in June of nineteen ninety and   (.) odd things were sort of going through nineteen ninety, but it wasn't until nineteen ninety one   (.) and I was off ill and   (.) it all went
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	so it's, it's all part of er life's rich tapestry
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*PET:	and erm
*FRE:	Yeah.And is Janet, has Janet been able to go back to work yet?Er obviously she's not fit at the moment.
*PET:	Well
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	she's been back
*FRE:	She has?Yeah.
*PET:	and erm in fact she was back all the   (.) all the, all the summer
*FRE:	No I meant   (.) fairly recently
*PET:	No.
*FRE:	is it since she er was not well, mm.
*PET:	Erm we had gone down to, to, to   (.) Bognor to the christening of her, our   (.) nephew and   (.) she wasn't too,th that was in November, it was sort of middle of November, and   (.) something was going wrong there and so when I, when I was retiring on the twenty seventh of November she couldn't come in and er  (.) 
*FRE:	Was that to Boots?D 
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	yeah, yeah.
*PET:	month of December was sort of off and   (.) trying to do odd things and then she   (.) went down with this, this flu er   (.) which was   (.) progressively worse since the new year.So, you know what these girls are, they sort of I personally, you know, as it were a trained scientist, a certified chemist who    (        )  (.) you tend to, to take a, a slightly   (.) er diagnostic view of things, but that's not quite right, but you take a slightly   (.) objective view of things and I, I, I, I've been thinking to myself    (.)  [sighing] ah it is   [] rotten unfair on girls because sometimes sort of between about fifteen and twenty five, but now I suppose because they're all growing up so much earlier it's between ten and twenty, they have a pretty monumental change, they, and, and   (.) it's not a bundle of laughs but they can talk to their friends, they can see their friends and talk to their mothers, they can get a vague way it's gonna affect them and they can   (.) you know, sort of, let's say twenty, twenty five   (.) settle into a routine which has   (.) variations every, during the four weeks and they vary between individuals, I mean   (.) it's well known
*FRE:	Yeah, that's right.
*PET:	you know that s some don't really have a great deal of problem, others really do have a sort of off work for two or three days every month and it's not a bundle of laughs because, you know, that really must be difficult, but   (.) they, they get a rough idea of how it   (.) for them
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	and it goes through their, for the rest of their twenties, the rest of their thirties and most of their forties and then suddenly   [shouting] bang   [] maybe something ghastly seems to be happening which they are absolutely unaware of, you know, they don't know why they are   (.) crying or, or   (.) er unable to cope with whatever they can't cope with   (.) and that's it, that's them off and they start worrying about er osteoporosis and you know an enormous number of, of now medically defined problems of the menopause, and they may start going on to all sorts of things like hormone replacement therapy or even primrose oil or whatever the hell   (.) and they're sitting there   (.) at an age when they are   (.) fairly loaded up with experience and maturity and all the rest of it   [whispering] and they don't know what they are doing  [] . (.) All the   (.) wisdom of er in, in writing and doctors and everything else says   [laughing] oh it all varies you know some do this and some do that   [] some go straight through in a regal dignified way and they just carry on into relatively old age, you know, smooth as   (.) relaxed, nothing to worry about, away.
*FRE:	Mm, mm 
*PET:	And   (.) tt Jan was er was   (.) er wondering   (.) during last year and went on to hormone replacement therapy because she was   (.) and the doctor was a bit concerned about possible osteoporosis which is erm brittle bone   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah 
*PET:	i it's, it's obviously a thing which, if one can possibly avoid it's a good idea to    ((laugh))  (.) and erm    (.)  ((sigh)) I must say it helped but it   (.) you don't know what is helping because you know   [laughing] we don't know what her symptoms are going to be  [] .Maybe H R T was helping what her symptoms would have been if she hadn't taken them, maybe they were worse because she was, maybe they were the same in spite of it, but I dunno.Er anyhow th th the, the eventual thing was maybe her blood pressure was going up higher than it should and maybe   (.) whether the cumulative stress of having a husband off in my state, maybe   (.)  ((sigh)) 
*FRE:	Yeah what 
*PET:	 (        ) her, you know maybe   (        ) all sorts of things   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah well this is,th this is it I mean th th there are often a lot of things happening at the same time er er some of which as you just sort of hinted at are sort of er erm   (.) of a psychological er er have a psychological factor in them which all add to it don't they?
*PET:	Well   (.) my feeling is that   (.) you know if yo if you're car doesn't run   (.) tinker with the carburettor   (        ) and if it still isn't running right, tinker with something else, if you like, the fatal thing is   [laughing] to tinker with both   [] because then you just don't know what you've got, and erm she's been on, on   (.) this hormone replacement which is er er   (.) no big deal but, you know, hormones are   (        ) 
*FRE:	Well th 
*PET:	big things.
*FRE:	I, I, I've met ladies who have, have really benefited
*PET:	Oh yeah
*FRE:	from it.
*PET:	oh yeah.
*FRE:	Yeah. (.) 
*PET:	Erm   (.) her blood pressure was being, being depressed   (.) er by some other, you know, blood pressure regulator and erm   (.) one of the side effects of hormone replacement may be, yeah, ((laugh)) that   (.) people's   (.) susceptibility to migraine is heightened. (.) So y y y you, you, you, you've got at least three things which are all sort of brewing up there and you think good grief what a, what a, what a state to be in because the poor doctor doesn't know what on earth to do, poor Jan doesn't know, well it's worse for Jan cos she's sitting there thinking I'm going potty or, you know, can't stand properly or you know is leaning over or, or   (.) numb down one side of her face or, or   (.) or   (.) whatever it was, it was i i it was the, the dizziness I think actually which   (.) which was most alarming.And so erm    (.)  (        ) get flu on top of it all erm  ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	Quite.
*PET:	It really is a very difficult, difficult erm
*FRE:	Yeah there's quite a bit of flu about at the moment isn't there?
*PET:	Yeah. (.) Well what   (.) I know the answer is   (.) is to say don't worry   (.) be concerned but don't worry because worrying doesn't do you no good, it doesn't do the condition no good and it doesn't do everybody else any good either because they just say oh she's   (.) you know what she is, depressed by whatever it is and that's, as it were, objectively logical but   (.) wh wh what seems to me to be the absolutely   (.) overwhelming is to say he's not worried, he's desperately concerned, he's more concerned than humans can possibly be but   (.) if god isn't worried, what on earth are we burning up our resources worrying about because if he's not worried   (.) concerned yes, but he's not worried.
*FRE:	Who are you talking about now?
*PET:	God.
*FRE:	Oh god, yeah.Yeah.
*PET:	I mean he is desperately concerned, I mean he, he loves us all with a concern which just er er   (.) er er i is greater than anything we can understand, so   (        ) concern at the   (.) at the slightest   (.) er doubt about, I can't understand how concerned he is but er   (.) I totally relax 
*FRE:	Yeah 
*PET:	but if the god of heaven is concerned   (.) that's fine, he's not worrying because he created the whole thing, therefore it seemed to me pretty good   (.) reason to be concerned   (        ) 
*FRE:	Concerned but not worried.
*PET:	but not worried, and I'm certainly not 
*FRE:	Yeah I, well I'm with you mm
*PET:	you know, lying awake at nights you know   (.) cos er th three and four in the morning   (.) everything's quiet, you know,
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	the heating's off  ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	I think people who are   (.) liable to worry about their condition   (.) have a very very difficult time at three and four in the morning and er   (.) old ladies are particularly vulnerable I think.
*FRE:	Well I, I had a period of waking up at four
*PET:	Isn't it   (        ) 
*FRE:	and not going off again.
*PET:	Isn't it
*FRE:	Mind you
*PET:	demoralising?
*FRE:	Yeah but I'd far sooner do that than not get off to sleep at night.
*PET:	Yeah I think that's   (.) that's right, you know.That's where everyone's different of course but erm I, I think it is, it is   (.) it is   (.) a factor that erm   (.) one can watch television or can listen to the radio or one can go for a walk or do all sorts of things as it were before   [laughing] noon and midnight but three or four in the morning, you know, when everything is  [] 
*FRE:	Mm
*PET:	at a very low level I think it's a very potentially demoralising thing 
*FRE:	Mm al although 
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah although it didn't, it didn't   (.) I w I wasn't too concerned about it, I thought well you know I'm resting er and er I'm the sort of person who only needs about six hours, if I get six hours I'm okay   (.) erm, you know, on a regular basis I'm talking about.So er I mean it didn't really affect me too much.
*PET:	But it's   (.) a low time isn't it?And it can be
*FRE:	Mm.Well 
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	er well er here again I think er it's the old old story of erm it affects different people different ways.Where some people are   (.) better a at night   (.) I'm erm I'm now talking about before going to bed
*PET:	Mm.
*FRE:	th than first thing in the morning   (.) erm   (.) whereas I, I think probably I am probably better as soon as I get up than last thing at night. (.) 
*PET:	Yes er I, I, I, I think    (        )  (.) one's either an owl or a   (.) some other bird which,wh wh which doesn't at night but does by, by, by day you know.
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	Yeah I, I, I think that er   (.) the, the, the M S Society have er er say that we've got eighty thousand members in the United Kingdom, Great Britain, Northern Ireland   (.) only problem is they appear to have eighty thousand different conditions  ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	Yeah yeah 
*PET:	That's absolutely right.Every doctor will say you know 
*FRE:	Yeah yeah.
*PET:	people do differ
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	and some of them differ so much from others who you put in the same box and you 
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	think well maybe we've got the box wrong.
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	I think, I think that's it and er   (.) tt
*FRE:	You mentioned Christopher , what er the last time   (.) it's, I'm going back a little while, the last time I was talking with Janet   (.) he, she was a bit unhappy, I think he was in er a teaching practice at the time   (.) and she was wondering how he was going to go on. (.) 
*PET:	 ((sigh)) 
*FRE:	That must be the best part of the year ago I should think though now.
*PET:	Yeah. (.) Well the, the, the, the, the sort of, the sort of background as I have seen it   (        ) he never   (.) struck me as being particularly clever or bright   (.) it's just that he always seemed to be very well taught and academically successful and exams never seemed an undue problem, and so   (.) he went off to   (.) Wolverhampton Poly which he selected for, you know, all the usual reasons, reasonable place, reasonable course, a reasonable this a reasonable that, (        ) tt   (.) erm to do computer science which of course all the kids want to do now   (.) erm twentieth centu no it isn't it's a sort of nineteen eighties version of wanting to be an engine driver isn't it?They all want to be   (.) so he went off to be a computer scientist and   (.) either   (.) he was too interested in   (.) er   (.) what he describes as cult television which you think   (        ) 
*FRE:	 ((yawn)) 
*PET:	but it's not   (        ) television,i i it's, it's Doctor Who and, and Prisoner and, you know   (.) er very   (.) interesting and very easy for enthusiasts to   (.) direct a lot of their time and energy to   (.) maybe I don't   (.) maybe there was a   (.) increased pressure to work and study   (.) which was erm self motivated rather than being externally imposed, maybe he    (.)  (        ) maybe there was a   ((cough)) fundamental     (.)  ((sigh))  (.) lack of enthusiasm in him for   (.) what is described as the hardware of computing, the, the, the, the, the instruments, the machines   (.) maybe there was a less than   ((cough)) comprehensive understanding of what is known as the firmware, that's to say I mean   (.) operating systems that are built into the thing to make it work, you've got to understand   (.) the firmware because otherwise you don't understand what the machine will   (.) think you mean and what that will do and   (.) I would have thought that whereas superficially you can ignore the firmware, it's all in there, it understands   (.) as you, I would have thought, grew into a   (.) er a graduate computer scientist you've got to have some idea about that.Er maybe he was, I think, a little superficial in his enthusiasm for what is referred to as the software, that's to say that's the computer programs that you 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	write, you write and er   (.) feed into the thing which it operates along the rules defined by its firmware which someone else has put into it.Anyhow, whatever it was, maybe   (.) a little, as Jan says, he also had a f a bad flu bug at a bad time   (.) anyhow he crashed out of the computer science course   (.) and he announced that he was   (.) only regarding the computer science course as being a stepping stone to being a teacher so the sensible thing to do would be to go on to the teacher training course at Lancashire, an education course, cos that's what he wanted to do.So that cost an awful lot of money because he was on a grant of course and he, he spent er about a year as a trainee teacher and we thought that was great because he was, he was dealing with, with er    (.)  (        ) 
*FRE:	Wasn't he i in juniors yeah yeah
*PET:	Well I can't remember what the terms are, infants er
*FRE:	There's infants and juniors isn't there?
*PET:	Yeah it,i it's the very young ones
*FRE:	Ah infants.
*PET:	it was the very young ones and er   (.) the vast majority of   (.) infant teachers are girls
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	and so he had a   (.) a degree of uniqueness and er in the area that he was   (.) vast numbers of   (.) ethnic minorities   (.) so he was er he was   (.) a white male vegetarian 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*PET:	and I would have thought it was absolutely great, you know, [laughing] he really, I would have though   [] had a stimulating, challenging   (.) lovely environment to, to, to be in, I, I, I, I, I hoped that if he was going  (        ) , I thought he was going to   (.) go on, it was just going to be very expensive tt paying his fees, his this   (        ) 
*FRE:	 ((sigh)) 
*PET:	I was therefore   (.) a little surprised and very disappointed when he failed his teaching practice.Erm   (.) I was, I was a bit erm    (.)  (        ) about that, you know, I just though what on earth now? (.) He is unemployed and receiving state benefit as employed which   [whispering] isn't very much  [] 
*FRE:	Is he at home or is he down there?
*PET:	He wants, wants to stay with us forever   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah quite.Quite. (.) 
*PET:	I erm   (.) am obviously feeling guilty cos I'm not feeling guilty but   (.) it makes me   (.) cough a bit to go to the post office every week and get vastly more disabl disability er invalidity benefit than he gets, vastly more. (.) And each month Boots Pensions Limited pay me a very reasonable   (.) pension.
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	 (        ) large, not generous but I think good grief poor Christopher's sitting there  (        ) .I agree the state is picking up his, his   (.) rent   (.) which is er er quite a lot er but even so, you know, [whispering] he hasn't got very much money and   (.) cannot have a very    []  (.) enthusiastic view of what the future holds
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.It's a very bad time.
*PET:	It is bad
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	So he's, he's now doing er A level psychology and G S C E sociology at   (.) night school   (.) whilst he is keeping his days free to try and get a job   (.) which is not easy anywhere
*FRE:	Right.
*PET:	it is   (.) no easier in greater Wolverhampton, and if you have eczema and a congenitally weak back you aren't actually falling over yourself in prospects for   (.) the best   (.) chances.So erm we're both   (.) very concerned, not worried, very concerned about what on earth he is doing and what he is going to do.
*FRE:	Yeah quite.
*PET:	You know he's twenty two, twenty three years old, you know, you know   (.) whatever he's doing he's liable to be with him for a few years yet   (.) and what can one see     (.)  [whispering]  (        )  [] 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	You know?
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	There just doesn't seem to be anything   (.) on the, on the   (.) horizon.So after he's, he's sat these two exams   (.) erm
*FRE:	Is he doing them this year?
*PET:	Yeah,
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	he may be eligible to be on a   ((cough)) training course, for what we don't know, but er after you've been unemployed six months you are either required to or you have the opportunity to, or you can   (.) go on a state training course but what they train you for or to do we, we haven't actually got   (.) defined yet.And   (.) possibly   (.) either after that or   (.) simultaneously with that or   (.) to transfer there, he might go up to   (.) live in his father's house up in Yorkshire, Mytholmroyd   (.) er er I dunno but it seems to me that if there is a worse place to be unemployed than Wolverhampton, West Riding has gotta be erm   (.) a   [laughing] competitor  [] 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah
*PET:	and Hebden Bridge and Sowerby Bridge seem to be, you know, on each side of M Mytholmroyd, you know, on a railway line from Halifax which goes through to   (        ) and Todmorden and places.Beautiful part of the world, you know, maybe that's exactly what you wanna do, you wanna kick out Wolverhampton and go for Mytholmroyd particularly if you've got a house or if your father's got a house there which is   (        ) there maybe a lot, a lot , a lot going for it but   (.) you're looking for this long term prospects   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah quite er it doesn't sound too good. (.) 
*PET:	So er I   ((sigh)) I thought to myself well   (.) I dunno, I dunno   (.) all these Newton girls have been off to Sri Lanka or    (.)  (        ) or, or Zaire or wherever    (.)  [laughing] and you'd   [] you know, isn't that great?Don't really want to   (.) he's not very keen on the prospect of going   (        ) V S O or   (.) whatever.And then I say to myself oh come on, oh don't say when I was your age I wanted   (.) did   (.) nearly or whatever.Say
