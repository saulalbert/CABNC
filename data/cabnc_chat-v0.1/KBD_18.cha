*BAR:	You know when we, we, when we first opened from a dead start  right? •207131_207456•
        The first fifty five weeks  which is •207535_207764•
*HUG:	Just over a year. •207764_207896•
*BAR:	a year  we did on the bar did ninety thousand quid. •207896_208311•
*HUG:	Jesus! •208493_208509•
*BAR:	The next five months  less than half a year  the next five months after that right? •208533_209135•
*HUG:	When Jean stopped doing her silly things? •209147_209282•
*BAR:	Yeah. •209313_209342•
        Well, yeah, when  er er after that first year the next five months  seventy nine thousand! •209342_209816•
*HUG:	Fucking hell! •209989_210026•
*BAR:	In five months. •210052_210096•
        So if we'd have carried on at that  •210195_210330•
*HUG:	So you would have like, you would have well doubled that. •210330_210557•
*BAR:	Yeah. •210559_210570•
        I mean we, it, have been  •210570_210646•
*HUG:	Five months you would have equalled . •210668_210766•
*BAR:	Well I think we'd have gone to  two hundred thousand. •210771_210970•
*HUG:	Yeah. •210981_210994•
*BAR:	But that, at the end of that period was when Volks recalled the loan. •211055_211364•
*HUG:	Aye. •211364_211367•
        And  •211415_211421•
*BAR:	And  •211568_211576•
*HUG:	you were buying seventy off them or something? •211576_211711•
*BAR:	Yeah. •211711_211735•
        But er, but when  •211851_211914•
*HUG:	You were getting all your orders from them at that time? •211914_212049•
*BAR:	Yeah. •212049_212065•
        But when Volks recalled the loan  we sort of give up. •212090_212481•
*HUG:	Yeah. •212509_212526•
*BAR:	I, we went two day week opening and not publicizing it, everything. •212540_212875•
*HUG:	Yeah. •212879_212885•
*BAR:	So if we'd have just carried on the way that was going, I mean, that got it from ninety thousand in  just over a year  to, to seventy nine thousand in five months. •212909_213632•
*HUG:	Jesus! •213632_213648•
        It's amazing! •213648_213689•
*BAR:	Know what I mean, like we didn't want  •213689_213943•
