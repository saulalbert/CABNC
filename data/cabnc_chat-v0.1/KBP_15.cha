*NIN:	This one. •173777_173830•
*CLA:	Mhm. •173851_173878•
*NIN:	It looks very small. •174003_174101•

*CLA:	Yes. •174836_174853•
        Exactly, yes. •174853_174914•

*CLA:	Yeah. •175510_175542•
*NIN:	 (        )

*NIN:	Forty two for this. •175705_175826•
*CLA:	And thirty something for that. •175857_175974•
        Thirty seven I think it was, something like that. •175974_176174•
        Could be wrong. •176174_176338•
*NIN:	Yes it is but I think this is the one  erm this is  •176338_176616•

        There wouldn't be room for the caravan to start with. •178776_178932•
*NIN:	I thought there would. •178973_179064•
*CLA:	No I don't think so, no. •179064_179137•
        Yeah. •179137_179148•

*NIN:	What? •181960_181966•
*CLA:	Well some estates, not many of course, but some estates have got  a no go area for caravans parked don't they? •181966_182768•
        Mm. •182768_182774•

*NIN:	Ah well there's a caravan parked round the corner. •183261_183537•

*NIN:	No. •183783_183805•
*CLA:	But erm  it would be a damn sight safer down here wouldn't it? •183805_184371•

*CLA:	Well it is for us because we've always been saying it. •191293_191488•

*NIN:	Oh yes. •195841_195853•

*CLA:	Fancy putting boss white? •198424_198530•
*NIN:	You know what they say? •198530_198615•
        Never trouble trouble. •198615_198712•
*CLA:	Oh I know. •198712_198781•
        If it works leave it alone, but •198781_198917•
*NIN:	I'll say . •198917_198945•
*CLA:	erm  on balance it's best left on and to just •198958_199252•
*NIN:	Well it is really •199252_199322•
*CLA:	Yes. •199322_199340•
*NIN:	if we can get away with it. •199340_199490•
*CLA:	Oh yes. •199490_199502•
        I'd far sooner take it off and do a proper job but  well  •199557_199762•
*NIN:	It er well it's easier isn't it, really? •199795_200004•
        But on the  •200011_200084•
*CLA:	Well  •200084_200094•
*NIN:	other hand, you might have problems with it leaking if you take it off anyway, so •200094_200475•
*CLA:	Well that's a yes exactly, yes. •200475_200557•
        Cos   •200608_200619•
*NIN:	No, if you've got to  •200619_200907•
*CLA:	and I've got to scrape out all that horrible boss white. •200907_201159•
        Cos it goes rock hard that stuff, over the years you know? •201159_201401•
*NIN:	Mm. •201450_201462•
*CLA:	Boss white. •201462_201484•
*NIN:	I wonder whether it was leaking in, when they  put it in in the first place? •201484_201838•
*CLA:	Do you mean that's why they used boss white? •201838_201954•
        Possibly. •201954_201978•
        Yeah. •201978_202023•
        Mm. •202037_202055•

*CLA:	Oh quite, yes. •202521_202653•
        Mm. •202653_202681•
        Have you noticed that by and large, not all the time of course but  I should say that eighty percent of the time birds face that way? •202681_203953•
*NIN:	No I've never noticed which cos I'm  •203961_204141•
*CLA:	Mm. •204141_204166•

*CLA:	In the tree, yeah. •204268_204404•
        Mm. •204404_204424•

*NIN:	It looks like a picture doesn't it sometimes? •204705_204948•
        With those trees. •204948_205121•
*CLA:	Oh god, yes. •205121_205161•

*NIN:	I've never seen so many perch in one tree. •205200_205406•
*CLA:	Mm. •205416_205451•
        Facing basically west, aren't they? •205566_205715•
*NIN:	Mm. •205716_205717•
        That's true. •205773_206465•

*NIN:	The windows are filthy outside . •206620_206736•
*CLA:	Mm. •206762_206780•
        You don't often get one pigeon though do you? •207383_207782•
        There's usually at least two of them. •207782_208079•
*NIN:	Well you usually have two together don't you? •208083_208610•
*CLA:	Yeah, exactly. •208611_208618•

        bunged up now. •209260_209333•
*NIN:	I wonder who  I wonder who chopped and vandalized all those daffodils round the corner?? •209362_210716•
*CLA:	Well  and the fact that it was just their garden, and as far as I can make out it was simply that garden, it would suggest that she's fallen out with some kids or  something like that or somebody and  yeah. •210758_211740•
*NIN:	Mm. •211740_211746•
*CLA:	I mean why pick on one garden and systematically  •211807_212039•
*NIN:	Well they probably thing, yes but cabbages? •212039_212205•
        Fancy taking cabbages! •212260_212309•
*CLA:	I don't think they'd been actually taken from what I can gather. •212323_212657•
*NIN:	Well what did they do to them? •212657_212722•
        Oh just cut them? •212722_212764•

*NIN:	Peculiar thing to do. •212946_213222•
*CLA:	Oh according to Josie, I really don't know about all the cabbages, it might consist of one or two. •213234_213638•
        Funny business, yeah. •213638_213711•
*NIN:	Oh it's a shame though isn't it? •213738_213949•
*CLA:	Mm. •213950_213951•
        Mm. •213951_213957•
*NIN:	All the time you spend waiting for the blooming things to grow . •214000_214355•
*CLA:	That's Yvonne's mother isn't it? •214355_214478•
        Yeah. •214479_214480•
*NIN:	That's right. •214480_214536•

*NIN:	You can't be sure of that. •215290_215377•
*CLA:	Oh no no no no no. •215377_215446•
        If there'd been a trail of destruction down the road, then fair enough, but •215446_215959•
*NIN:	I couldn't er  go and vandalize something, I mean a thing like flowers. •215959_216313•
*CLA:	Mm. •216313_216333•

*CLA:	Well we think so. •216512_216654•
        Obviously there's others that don't think so, but  not everybody thinks so. •216654_217000•
*NIN:	Well a lot of people like, I mean most people like flowers don't they? •217000_217308•

*CLA:	Oh yeah it's very small beer really isn't it? •219403_219560•
        Compared to some of the dodges they get up to. •219560_219701•
*NIN:	It is really. •219732_219888•
*CLA:	Mm. •219960_219972•

        Other than that, over the door area somewhere, I don't know exactly. •220740_220971•
        I might stick it on a flying lead and wander around with it for a bit  and see where it's best. •220985_221456•
*NIN:	Mm. •221456_221476•
*CLA:	But I've got a rough idea where it'll go anyway. •221476_221715•
*NIN:	Mm. •221715_221733•
*CLA:	of course is cable running to it  providing it with power. •221857_222292•
        I'll probably run it from the garage . •222292_222376•
*NIN:	Mm. •222376_222405•
*CLA:	About the easiest source. •222518_222598•
*NIN:	On the corner I think would be perhaps a good idea, do you think? •222598_222980•
        Between the garage and the house. •222986_223497•
*CLA:	Do you mean the return? •223497_223830•
        If you come from the front of the house going towards the garage, that little bit there? •223830_224113•
        There's two feet or something . •224113_224250•
*NIN:	No. •224269_224291•
        I thought you were going to put it facing the front. •224301_224487•
*CLA:	I am, yes. •224510_224562•
        Well what do you mean then, the corner? •224566_224669•
*NIN:	On the on the front of the house at the corner. •224669_225060•
*CLA:	Yes , you mean literally on the corner? •225095_225202•
        The apex of two •225202_225300•
*NIN:	Yes. •225300_225316•
*CLA:	Well I'd have to make something to mount it on to go right on the corner but  •225316_225702•
*NIN:	Well I know that. •225702_225751•
        Well wherever you put it you're going to have to make something to mount it on. •225751_226055•
*CLA:	No. •226055_226067•
        No. •226086_226092•
        No. •226117_226124•
        No. •226124_226131•
*NIN:	Why? •226131_226139•
*CLA:	It'll screw drive  on to a flat surface. •226141_226343•
        Brickwork. •226343_226384•
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Yeah. •226414_226453•
        Certainly it will. •226483_226579•
        Yeah. •226734_226743•
        Mm. •226873_226879•
*NIN:	How high up are you thinking of putting it? •226998_229647•
*CLA:	Above a vandal . •229778_230203•
*NIN:	How high  . •230203_230314•
        How high is the one we've got at the back? •230314_230523•
*CLA:	Well so you've got to get up a ladder to get at it. •230523_230754•
        Er up a step ladder I mean, not a  •230754_231813•
*NIN:	I think about, above the number. •231813_232099•
*CLA:	I'd thought roughly speaking in that area, yes but •232099_232541•
*NIN:	Er yes, well somewhere there. •232543_232694•
*CLA:	Ah well that would illuminate the er  see if I put it fairly close to the actual corner at the front side, going down towards the garage. •232699_233415•
        Close to that corner, still lighting on the front face but •233415_233670•
*NIN:	Mm. •233673_233688•
*CLA:	then a percentage of light will go round the corner. •233688_233968•
        Well  cos lights don't go round corners but  •233968_234096•
*NIN:	What about on the garage above what about on the garage? •234096_234275•
*CLA:	No. •234275_234306•
*NIN:	No? •234314_234332•
*CLA:	No that would throw the front door into shadow wouldn't it? •234361_234564•
*NIN:	Mm. •234564_234572•
*CLA:	Mm. •234653_234663•
*NIN:	Well above the number then. •234728_234992•
        Cos you're nearly, you know, more or less on the corner there anyway aren't you? •234997_236082•
*CLA:	Mm like I say that would be  mm. •236110_236298•
        Oh that way I can then get a decent cable run I think to the garage. •236298_236907•
        For feed, you know? •236907_237015•
*NIN:	Mm. •237015_237021•
*CLA:	Mm. •237138_237146•
        Well that's the easiest bit,. •237146_237344•
        To the  circuit, yeah. •237344_237536•
*NIN:	What's that then? •237536_237804•
*CLA:	That is . •237809_237858•
        It will be helpful though, having a light there. •237866_238267•
*NIN:	Oh yes. •238267_238347•
*CLA:	Because at night, you get a percentage a a  •238347_238530•
*NIN:	Yes you do. •238530_238557•
*CLA:	degree of light I should say from that  street lighting, but not an awful lot. •238557_238831•
*NIN:	Not the same, no. •238863_238916•
*CLA:	Mm. •239142_239148•
*NIN:	No it is handy having the light. •239148_239305•
*CLA:	And for people coming in, going out for the step. •239305_239546•
*NIN:	Yeah. •239546_239560•
*CLA:	whatever, you know? •239560_239627•
        Mm. •239627_239633•
*NIN:	 (        )  (.) 
*CLA:	It'll be a quite sufficient  spread to, to cope with the er  entrance to the garage I mean, you know? •240208_240720•
        Mm. •240720_240727•
        I still think two rows of erm pavers  stones inbetween's the best bet for the front you know? •240832_241861•
        To put there. •241896_241988•
        There's only one problem  •241988_242201•
*NIN:	You mean to the garage? •242201_242268•
*CLA:	Well the approach to the garage, yeah. •242268_242429•
        The drive. •242429_242484•
*NIN:	Like Mike's got at, in their   •242484_242629•
*CLA:	Er yes. •242629_242669•
        Yes. •242669_242683•
        Exactly. •242683_242693•
        Yeah. •242693_242725•
        The usual thing, yeah. •242740_242842•
*NIN:	Well you get a erm •242842_242882•
*CLA:	You get a what? •242882_242993•
*NIN:	You get a lot of weeds where the chippings are. •242993_243221•
*CLA:	No, not if you put sodium chlorate down. •243244_243433•
        Nothing'll grow then. •243433_243548•
        Good grief. •243548_243674•
*NIN:	The thing is if you  •243679_243799•
*CLA:	If you what? •243815_244055•
*NIN:	erm  I'm just thinking if, like when anybody comes to stay  •244101_244718•
*CLA:	Yeah. •244718_244740•
        Yeah. •244752_244769•
*NIN:	and you run the car, or somebody runs the car  the other way •244791_245186•
*CLA:	Up the sides, yeah. •245186_245257•
        Yeah? •245261_245284•
*NIN:	Well then you're going across, you're not staying er you're not on the pavers are you? •245294_245762•
*CLA:	No, well that doesn't really matter. •245785_245922•
        I mean the erm  in fact, there's only one fairly tight  path you can follow to get the car in. •245922_246819•
        Into the side. •246819_246923•
        If you think about it. •246923_247104•
*NIN:	Mm. •247104_247112•
*CLA:	It'll be worth putting a couple of pavers on there just to cope with the track of the er the wheels going in. •247112_247506•
*NIN:	Oh wouldn't that look a bit odd? •247521_247684•
*CLA:	Not necessarily, no. •247684_247805•
        No. •247811_247834•
        I don't mean put down like bloody tramlines . •248014_248136•

*NIN:	A you know  •248803_248902•
*CLA:	that actually. •248949_248973•
*NIN:	Well it is but it   •248973_249103•
*CLA:	I was looking at it again this morning. •249103_249324•

*NIN:	I thought that. •249366_249396•
*CLA:	Ooh  hark at her! •249396_249484•
*NIN:	Yes. •249484_249494•

*CLA:	Well they want stabilizing a bit yeah and er •249985_250207•

        Mm. •250700_250716•

*NIN:	As long as I can get, walk along and get to all the plants there. •250953_251242•
        What do you think of that ? •251259_251427•
        I'd definitely think about moving those other pavers at the bottom. •251427_251828•
        There were the steps are. •251954_252037•
*CLA:	Oh lifting them you mean?you mean? •252072_252216•
        Oh god . •252216_252269•

*CLA:	Yes. •252475_252481•
        Yeah. •252487_252543•
*NIN:	I don't see any reason for that, to be quite honest, why they've done that? •252566_252885•
*CLA:	Well there was at the time obviously. •252885_253011•
        Cos do you remember there was that erm  monstrous  creation I should say erection,erection  for erm  •253011_253706•

*NIN:	We've got to move those before we grow anything. •254247_254523•
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*NIN:	I've put some of the bricks over one side, so that'll eliminate getting rid of one side of them. •254523_255246•
*CLA:	No, I'm not with you. •255246_255422•
*NIN:	Well where I've put me bricks  they're  •255422_255715•
*CLA:	Yes. •255716_255717•
*NIN:	on top of some of those  stones that are underneath. •255867_256983•

        Peter  which on a map looks quicker but it isn't cos it's a winding •267304_267798•
*NIN:	Mm. •267798_267851•

*CLA:	Mm. •269065_269079•
        Mm. •269089_269105•
*NIN:	because there's such an awful lot to do. •269105_269258•
*CLA:	Mm. •269258_269269•
*NIN:	We could bring them right  well the two that are down there could come   •269317_269655•
*CLA:	Yeah. •269684_269697•
*NIN:	It would save you a lot of cementing wouldn't it? •269728_269935•

        Oh yes, yes. •271806_271881•

*CLA:	In some ways it is  sensible, yes because you're carrying muck down. •272723_273097•
