*DEI:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	they didn't do them! (.) Actually they perhaps let us go back on them then
*DEI:	Well
*ANN:	tomorrow
*DEI:	if you do that, I think perhaps that's the best kind of action, have a word with him and go down   (.) I mean 
*ANN:	You mean go back on them, cos we didn't finish them cos there was three pallets   (.) and we didn't even do two.
*DEI:	There's only twelve with a   (        ) last week weren't there?
*ANN:	We didn't finish them cos they wanted to start trussing early 
*DEI:	It's what you had last week.
*ANN:	and then Ann started that little line trussing you see, so we've   (.) done it between us but   (.) I've got a thousand to do and she's got about four d t 
*DEI:	Ann, even if they do some  (        ) 
*ANN:	I bet you feel like a   (        ) now, (        )  (.) give them in when they can't truss them   (.) dunno.
*DEI:	That I've only had
*ANN:	We give them in when they came trussed with the though we had before.
*DEI:	It's not very heavy     (.)  (        )  (.) Really to start a truss that's  (        ) 
*ANN:	Well, with the two lines going yeah   (.) would have been about right then but see, John   (.) I don't suppose he realised Ann was gonna   (.) fetch all the people out of here there and everywhere and start that up.
*DEI:	What did he do, did he say   (        ) 
*ANN:	Well I pa 
*DEI:	 (        ) Ann?

*ANN:	no so she started trussing, helping me.
*DEI:	Yeah yeah but he wouldn't  (        ) 
*ANN:	I suppose that's what John thought, we might not get them done, start early and get them finished
*DEI:	That's good.
*ANN:	He just said leave the Bird's Eye pies and   (.) start your trussing.
*DEI:	That was gone seven o'clock when  (        )
