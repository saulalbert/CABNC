@Comment:	conversation #17 (Tape 029203)
*ENA:	Oh you won't need sixteen megabytes even if you decide to   (.) improve the   (.) let's unpack that   (.) thing and then we'll see how much space we're talking about   (.) how much of that's padding and how of that is   (.) real thing, (  ) .  (8.0) I was taught that   (.) when I worked in the grocery warehouse.  (.) If you open a box with a penknife always do that. 
*ALA:	So that you have to    (  )   
*ENA:	 So get it to go all the way. 
*ALA:	Cut the   (.) end that's for  (  ) . 
*ENA:	Do the contents the world of good! 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	Oh!  (.) What's happened to this  (  ) . 
*ALA:	Yeah. 
*ENA:	Yep! (.)  (  ) get it out. 
*ALA:	Whatever! 
*ENA:	Right we're on to this roll now   (.)  (  ) .  (.) Oh! Right! ((paper rustling)) 
*ENA:	Right!  (.) Can you pull that off?  (.) That one.  (.) Right!  (8.0) Before I realised I've got mine.  (9.0)  ((sighing)) Okay ! ((paper rustling)) 
*ALA:	It is slightly bigger than the other one isn't it? 
*ENA:	Quite a lot bigger actually.  (.)  Mm. 
*ALA:	 Oh  dear!  (.) Yes, it's got more back to it.  (.) Oh the screen   (.) mm, about the same size. 
*ENA:	It's a little bit bigger   (.) I think you'll find   (.) if you put the tape measure on it you'll find it's a little bit bigger.  (.) Right.  (9.0) Right. 
*ALA:	Presumably this is the power supply for it? 
*ENA:	Yeah.  (12.0) Woops! The main colour monitor   (.) operating instructions in here.  (15.0) How many spare points you got? 
*ALA:	Erm   (.) one at the moment, but I can pull out the radio without any problem. 
*ENA:	Oh fine.  (.) It's a  (  )  
*ALA:	No, one of these spools    (.)   (  )   
*ENA:	 Full wear   (  )   
*ALA:	If I can crawl under here   (.) I 
*ENA:	Yes, I just wanna have a look at   (.) yes you can crawl under there to your hearts content!  (.) You can unplug that for the moment.  (.) I'm not really worried about it. 
*ALA:	No, I just, thinking it's easier if I take it down this way. 
*ENA:	Oh alright. 
*ALA:	Then I pull it   (.)  (  ) . 
*ENA:	Now, (  ) .  (9.0) Ultimately   (.) er   (.) they might change the lead on the end of that monitor.  (.) What's the matter? 
*ALA:	I was wondering   (.) where the socket is.  (.) Oh I see where it's gone! 
*ENA:	Right! 
*ALA:	I should have  (  ) .  (.) Oh there's plenty of wire. 
*ENA:	Oh yes. 
*ALA:	Right. 
*ENA:	Now if I'd have been sensible 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	which I really am   (8.0) I'd have brought over   (.) my 
*ALA:	Oh! 
*ENA:	what's his name?  (.) My monitor. 
*ALA:	Why? 
*ENA:	Well   (.) if I'd swapped monitors with you can pro   (.) and I don't suppose you'll wanna get rid of your Amstrad today 
*ALA:	No. 
*ENA:	and you'll probably want to keep it for a little while? 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Oh hang on, moving leads and things   (.) don't stand up!  (.) Not just yet anyway. 
*ALA:	Right. 
*ENA:	Erm   (.) I could of taken the black and white one 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	and then I could have shown mine to this lady, cos I mean the only difference is is the   (.) black and white isn't it? 
*ALA:	Er, yes. 
*ENA:	Er   (.) I'll have another lead for you in just a sec   (.) I'm afraid.  (.) Hang on a mo   (.) just screw this in.  (7.0) Right   (.) straight under there     (.)  (  )  (7.0) there is actually a power outpoint on this   (.) so if we can get the right kind of plug 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	we could actually drive the monitor off the box and you'd only need one socket. 
*ALA:	Well it doesn't really matter because I got   (.) and unused socket here. 
*ENA:	Yeah but I mean   (.) if you i   (.) in some ways it's easier   (.) cos then when you turn it off, you turn everything off.  (.) You see what I mean? 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Er erm   (.) there's a white   (.) plug   (.) have a seen a mucky grey, a white   (.) plug?  (.) I'll lower it down here. 
*ALA:	I've got, yes. 
*ENA:	Got it? 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Fine. 
*ALA:	It's here.  (13.0) Right, it's in! 
*ENA:	That's in?  (.) We need the keyboard now.  (.) I got a   (.) er   (8.0) find out where that plugs in.  (10.0) At the back somewhere usually.  (12.0) Then   (6.0) we can turn it on and see if it all works.  (.) Can you hold that for a mo  ?  While   
*ALA:	 Yes. 
*ENA:	I hold the lead. 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	There's a    (.)   ((sighing)) Oh ! 
*ALA:	 That's  got the   (.) vacuum   (  ) on the top. 
*ENA:	 ((laugh))  (.) Ah!  (.) Anything down that hole? 
*ALA:	Have you found it? 
*ENA:	Aha. 
*ALA:	Oh    (  )   
*ENA:	 Just seeing   
*ALA:	it's twelve   (.) I didn't realise that went in there. 
*ENA:	No, and somewhere or other I   (.) have got for you   (.) a copy of the   (.) long string   (.) the long   (.) you know?  (.) The erm   (8.0) the long   (.) trip card   (.) to work gently. 
*ALA:	Oh I see! 
*ENA:	Right   (.) there you go!  (9.0) Have you got a ruler? 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Yes, that's fine.  (.) Yes, you see that screen's   (.) twelve inches   (.) and that's screen's over   (.) over an inch bigger, nearly fourteen. 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	Do you want to turn it on? 
*ALA:	Is that the on button? 
*ENA:	Aha.  (.) It's, just rock it.  (.) Don't push it properly.  (17.0) Oh good, it's the go  , it's the good DOS! 
*ALA:	Yeah. 
*ENA:	It's a good do  , that's a very good   (.) erm   (.) files    (.)   (  )   
*ALA:	 Oh! 
*ENA:	put out. 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	Oh that's interesting! Let's have a look. 
*ALA:	Has it got a DOS directory?  (.) Two DOS directories!  (.) Old Do  , DOS and old DOS. 
*ENA:	I got version five. 
*ALA:	Well that's the latest isn't it? 
*ENA:	Yeah, except I haven't got all the   (.) things. 
*ALA:	Well if it's on this hard disc could we copy  it over? 
*ENA:	 We could  , we could   (.) we could keep it.  (.)  An E   
*ALA:	 Cos it's   
*ENA:	I R   (.) C   (.) and that's   (.) that's like   (.) oh no, we can have it, it's all set up this will save us a  ag  , ages of time! 
*ALA:	Good! 
*ENA:	DOS.  (12.0) Goodness, a lot of files on there! It would of been better 
*ALA:	If you'd done a P. 
*ENA:	No, sub-directory   (.) slash P   (.) Oh marvellous!  (.) I think we'll call it that.  (.)  (  ) . (6.0) Let's ring  .  (.) Erm   (.) how do we get it to load high that's what I want to know? (.)  (  ) . 
*ALA:	Mm.  (.) just   (.)  erm   
*ENA:	 erm   
*ALA:	I haven't got his work number on the memory so  I'll   
*ENA:	 Right. 
*ALA:	have to look it up.  (.) Er   (.) I should know it but 
*ENA:	No handbook, but I suppose we can buy some DOS five handbooks? 
*ALA:	Well I was thinking that. 
*ENA:	It would be worth   (.) copying all that off. 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Before we lose any of it! 
*ALA:	Er    (.)  ((whispering)) perhaps it's not !  (.) I know, work  .  (.) I wonder if we'll get him? 
*ENA:	Ah, well if not we'll try the car. 
*ALA:	No. 
*ENA:	Oh right. 
*ALA:	 .   (.) this one goes straight through to his office doesn't it? 
*ENA:	Ya. 
*ALA:	 ((talking on the phone))Good morning! How are you?  (.) Ooh fine thanks! We just want a bit of information about setting up a computer.  (.) Da  , er David'll talk to you. 
*ENA:	 ((talking on the phone))Hiya Rob!  (.) Erm   (.) these things have come with DOS five on them   (.) er but no books or anything! But never mind. Erm   (.) in the   (.) ah   (.) or to accept dot that, no,config  si  , how do you get it to load high?  (6.0)  ((whispering)) Have you got a pencil and paper   (  ) ? 
*ALA:	Er 
*ENA:	Oh right. 
*ALA:	 ((whispering)) I'll get you some . 
*ENA:	I mean you got, I mean I've got the rest   (.) config  sys  sorted out.  (.) Will do.  (.) Aha.  (11.0) Yes.  (.) I mean, I've put files equals twenty   (7.0) yeah but I'm   (.) DOS   (.) equals high with a   (.) H I G H, yes.  (.) Right! That's all I really needed to know.  (.) I don't need much else.  (.) Apart from busy sitting there thinking erm   (.) yeah, well I usually leave command dot com  in the root directory.  (6.0) Yeah.  (.) Yeah.  (18.0) Yeah.  (.) It should give   (.) yeah, I just need   (.) country   (.) yeah.  (.) Do  , does it help if DOS is high is near the beginning?  (.) Oh well it doesn't matter.  (.) Fine, that's alright.  (.) I'll just add it to the end, that's all I was thinking. Sometimes the   (.) they make a fuss if you put them in the wrong place.  (.) No   (.) not at the moment.  (10.0) Yeah.  (.) Yeah, ultimately they might wanna   (.) end up with erm   (.) a mouse driver high but   (.) it's alright.  (.) Yes, I mean it does it for you doesn't it?  (.) Basically.  (.) Yeah.  (7.0) Oh.  (.) Yeah.  (.) I used to always load anti  sys  but I, then I found out there's nothing I ever I really needed it, so I took it out!  ((laugh))  (.) But I suppose you've got more complicated setups than me?  (.) What?  (.) Yeah.  (.) Mm.  (.) Okay, thanks very much Rob!  (.) Bye    ((phonecall ends)) (.) Yes, right.  (.) Now let's find out something!  (.) Just check that that boots properly.  (.) Control alt   (7.0) it's deleted   (  ) segment but we don't really   (.) need that.  (.) We'll let it just   (.) setup isn't really that e   (.) erm   (.) you can do fancy things!  (.) Er   (.) that's a   (.) I think what we'll do is we'll get used to it. 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	So I'll just   ((whispering)) put that there.  (.) Would you be turning that round there ? 
*ALA:	I can do that sometimes but I don't 
*ENA:	Erm   (.) no, soon as you get an ordinary chip dot bat   (.) file 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	erm   (.) it will   (9.0) it reads the clock    (  )  (.) automatically.  (.) We'll just have to set it once but it hasn't done it. It's no good setting now because if there's no alt   (  ) dot bat 
*ALA:	I   (.) it won't keep it? 
*ENA:	Yeah. 
*ALA:	Mm mm. 
*ENA:	Oh!  (.) Right.  (.) Er, I need a copy of Xtree 
*ALA:	Er 
*ENA:	I want to have a look at the 
*ALA:	Erm, my   (  ) is 
*ENA:	I'm always  carrying it. 
*ALA:	 Here it is. 
*ENA:	I'm always sorting out people's computers for them. 
*ALA:	Ah? 
*ENA:	I said I always carry Xtree, I'm always sorting out   (.) people's computers for them. 
*ALA:	I see! 
*ENA:	A chair would help wouldn't it? 
*ALA:	Yes, why not have one?  (.) Er   (.) would you prefer the chair or the stool? Have what  you like. 
*ENA:	 It doesn't  matter   (.) one can have one.  (.) Ah, interesting!  (.) Aha!  (.) I wonder what's in old DOS?  (.) Read me now!  (.) View.  (17.0) Oh I understand!  (.) That's fine, you can delete that.  (.) Aha!  (11.0) That's fine.  (8.0) Now then   (.) er   (.) I wanna get back onto your computer. 
*ALA:	Right. 
*ENA:	Cos   (.) I want to   (8.0) that you need to put somewhere safe   (.) that's   (.) the disc driver for the   (.) card. 
*ALA:	Oh! 
*ENA:	This  is a   
*ALA:	 So that's  backup is it? 
*ENA:	Yeah   (.) write protected if you wouldn't mind? 
*ALA:	Oh. 
*ENA:	Before you get anywhere else done.  (.) Erm 
*ALA:	Right.  (7.0) Mhm. 
*ENA:	Right.  (7.0) Where did I, where did I put that piece of paper I had? 
*ALA:	Here you are. 
*ENA:	DOS equals high   (8.0) that's high.  (.) Drive five, one one   (7.0) that's    (6.0)  ((sighing)) There we are !  (16.0) Right!  (.) Ooh!  (.) Take the Xtree out   (.) there   (.) what's that's  (  ) ?  (.) Oh that's funny! 
*ALA:	What's that? 
*ENA:	It goes the other way.  (.) That'll take a bit of getting used to that! (.)  (  ) . 
*ALA:	How do you mean, it goes the other way? 
*ENA:	You turn it   (.) it's on the other side.  (.) Feels funny! 
*ALA:	Oh   (.) it's done! 
*ENA:	Do anything different, you still turn it the same way to lock it down it's just 
*ALA:	Oh it's just the shape of the thing? 
*ENA:	Just feels different! You can get  used   
*ALA:	 Mm. 
*ENA:	to it quick enough.  (.) Er   (.) and that one   (.) and that one   (.) how's that one  (  ) ?  (.) Er   (.) control copy all eight files as they are to the    (  )  (.) and that should   (.) do it! (.)  (  ) say on there. 
*ALA:	 Actually   
*ENA:	 Doesn't take  long does it? 
*ALA:	No. 
*ENA:	Right!  (.) Let's have a look, look see.  (.)  (  )  (.) There are!  (.) That's   (  ) assist   (.) what's this?  (13.0) Six.  (13.0) How do you get in this one?  (.) In there, oh you don't!  (7.0) Yeah, this is a windows thing.  (.) You don't need it. 
*ALA:	Lovely!  (8.0) Oh that 
*ENA:	Here? 
*ALA:	Win eight twenty is? 
*ENA:	Yeah, so if you'd have been running windows on it.  (.) I'll check it.  (8.0) Files read only. 
*ALA:	Oh well it doesn't  matter. 
*ENA:	 Oh! 
*ALA:	I wouldn't worry. 
*ENA:	Okay.  (.) Oh, by the way you'll only have one det   (.) well it   (.) you've got the whole lot on this thing. 
*ALA:	Right.  (.) You mean   (.) I don't need a C and a D? 
*ENA:	No.  (.) It runs the whole the lot! 
*ALA:	Oh! 
*ENA:	Don't matter. 
*ALA:	Well that's more what I'm used to. 
*ENA:	Xtree's more pretty in this isn't it?  (21.0) Where's the directory?  (.) There's   (6.0) er   (.) what's sub-directory known as?  (.) Handle? (.) and then   (.) sub-directory in D-base!  (.) I think the sub  dire  , we don't want the Gem. 
*ALA:	No. 
*ENA:	Cos I haven't sorted them out yet! 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	Er   (.) I'm gonna sit down quietly and do it one day   (.) erm   (.) it's   (.) and make a sub-directory. That's for storing.  (.) Can you scroll that down a bit?  (.)  (  )  (8.0) Oh!  (.) Hang on! 
*ALA:	Further? 
*ENA:	No, just as   (.) bit more, yeah.  (.) Leave your sub- directory as   (.) utils.  (6.0) Yeah, and I want to make the sub-directories so that can  (  ) .  (.) Make a sub- directory as   (.)  .  (.) Make as sub-directory as WP    (.)  (  ) papers. It's gonna take as long as I thought cos I have to format it and install it.  (.) Make a sub-directory as Wordperfect fifty one. 
*ALA:	Actually that   (.) is that a sub-directory or a main one? 
*ENA:	It's a sub-directory of the root directory   (.)  it's alright. 
*ALA:	 I see! 
*ENA:	And that's it!  (.) And you've got a sub-directory which says DOCS. 
*ALA:	Yes, what? 
*ENA:	Have you ever used that? 
*ALA:	I don't think I have used it. 
*ENA:	Well you can always make   (.) no I don't need to make the rest because erm   (.) oh yes   (.) graphics!  (.) Make a sub- directory as   (.) graphics. 
*ALA:	Macros?  (.) Do I need one for that? 
*ENA:	Oh yeah!  (.) You have macros don't you? 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Just wanna call them the same things as you're used to. 
*ALA:	Printers   (.) no print  , yes printer will be the same won't it?  (6.0) Speller. 
*ENA:	You call yours speller.  (6.0) It's  now   
*ALA:	 Yes. 
*ENA:	on.  (10.0) Right! 
*ALA:	Yes, that's the end by the look of it. 
*ENA:	Pardon me! 
*ALA:	 ((sighing)) Oh well ! 
*ENA:	Right!  (.) Let's take that out.  (.) No, that one was brown that was.  (.) No, and that one was brown.  (.) I tend to keep them in the originals cos then I   (.) if I need to  (  ) . 
*ALA:	Mm. 
*ENA:	Now let's    (.)  (  ) boot it and see what happens.  (6.0) No   (.) is it switched on   (.)  (  ) .  (7.0) Take that out   (.) otherwise it'll boot all the disc drive.  (30.0) Okay.  (9.0) Should be alright. 
*ALA:	Good! 
*ENA:	Er   (16.0) Right   (.) can I have your   (.) erm   (.) all your bible ones?  (10.0)  ((whispering)) There's some   (  ) . 
*ALA:	We've had those! 
*ENA:	They're all 
*ALA:	Ah! 
*ENA:	over there I think. 
*ALA:	Yes, here they are. 
*ENA:	Oh   (.) don't really need this!  (.) Never mind!  (.) Is this the order you put them up in? 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Oh, so you'd like those in order, put back in there? (.)  (  ) . 
*ALA:	The only thing is, I did wonder whether the   (.) two  (.)  
*ENA:	What? 
*ALA:	there's two files at the end which I thought   (.) maybe ought to be at the beginning. Where are they? 
*ENA:	In there. 
*ALA:	Er 
*ENA:	They're all in one big directory, DOS   
*ALA:	 These  two 
*ENA:	doesn't care! 
*ALA:	You see those two are right at the end, and those   (.) I don't know whether those ought to be together   (.) before XX. 
*ENA:	Well it, they're   
*ALA:	 So   
*ENA:	all in one directory. 
*ALA:	It doesn't  matter? 
*ENA:	 It  doesn't care! 
*ALA:	I see! 
*ENA:	It's called Bible isn't it? 
*ALA:	Yes. 
*ENA:	Copy   (.) mm   (.) perhaps it doesn't like   (.) Oh, that's the only thing!  (.) You're gonna get   (.) used to that.  (.) The se   (.) there's no second   (.) star.  (.) In   (.) that er, Bible.  (8.0) Oh!  (.) That's cos I made a mistake! (.)  (  )  (.) if I   (.) did I forget to do a word there?  (.) No.  (10.0) Star 
*ALA:	Oh! So that's drive B is it? 
*ENA:	Yeah.  (10.0) Star   (.)  (  ) . 
*ALA:	I haven't   (.) bothered to make    (.)  ((cough)) a label. 
*ENA:	No, I don't blame you. 
*ALA:	 ((cough)) 
*ENA:	Take them long enough wouldn't it? 
*ALA:	 ((cough)) 
*ENA:	Alright? 
*ALA:	Mm. (94.0)   ((cough))   
*ENA:	 Right!   (.) I will get used this drive sooner or later!  (11.0) Boring this innit? ((laugh))  
*ALA:	Yes.  (.) Still   (.) it has go  , got to be done.  (.) Well you could leave those   (  ) couldn't you? 
*ENA:	 ((shouting)) No, it's alright!  (.) I like to check that it all works   (.) you know?  (.) Get a few things on it and check that it works .  (6.0) It won't take long. 
*ALA:	Right you are! 
*ENA:	How many discs did you say this was? 
*ALA:	Twenty one of them. 
*ENA:	Mm. 
*ALA:	Er   (.) this one, yes I think we'll put that  (  ) . 
*ENA:	Yeah, no   (.) I'm putting them that way on top of each other. That's right!  (10.0) Hopefully another coffee? 
*ALA:	I've   (.) just put the kettle on. 
*ENA:	Oh! 
*ALA:	I thought you might be ready for one. 
*ENA:	Actually they spend more time   (.) changing discs probably than the 
*ALA:	Than the actual copying, yes.  (.) Well you can't help it  when you copy   
*ENA:	 Well look at  the speed it takes a disc onto the hard disc!  (.) Watch! 
*ALA:	Now is that a file? 
*ENA:	That's a whole file! ((laugh))  
*ALA:	Oh yes, it takes long  , spends longer reading than it is   (.)   (  ) ! 
*ENA:	 Oh yeah!   (.) Much longer! 
*ALA:	Yeah. 
*ENA:	Well it's longer, it's about ten times as long! 
*ALA:	Ha!  (.) Oh because that's the er 
*ENA:	That's a slow floppy innit? 
*ALA:	 Mm. 
*ENA:	 Floppies  are, that is terrible!  (112.0)  ((shouting)) I'm up to book fourteen . 
*ALA:	You what? 
*ENA:	I'm up to book fifteen! 
*ALA:	Oh! 
*ENA:	Oh I'm more than half way through!  (.) Only nine left. 
*ALA:	Good!  (7.0)  ((whispering)) Suppose I could of put this   (.) out there   (  ) ? 
*ENA:	What are doing? It should be going down.  (.) Fortunately this'll be the biggest job of all!  (.) I suppose actually loading Wordperfect will be the slowest job of all.  (.) Always takes a bit longer   (.) doesn't it? 
*ALA:	Mm.  (.) It's er   (6.0) there's not so many discs to load though. 
*ENA:	No? 
*ALA:	There's not so many discs. 
*ENA:	No, but er   (.) I can't just do this with it! 
*ALA:	No.  (11.0) Where are you going? 
*ENA:	Just wanna look at those.  (.)  ((whispering))  (  ) . (26.0) I mean Autoroute's only about three files.  (.)  Only got   
*ALA:	 Yeah. 
*ENA:	three discs so that won't take very long.  (.) D-base is what? Five at the moment.  (9.0) You know it says book forty, do you have to know which books you want to go into?
