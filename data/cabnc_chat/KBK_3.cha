@Comment:	conversation #3 (Tape 002003)
*CHR:	I've never seen such dry grapefruit. •108389_108560•
*NOR:	I ought to complain really. •108560_108738•
        It's such, such a time wasting procedure when you've got to  take things back. •108817_109482•
*CHR:	Where did they come from? •109482_109580•
*NOR:	Sainsbury's. •109595_109622•
*CHR:	Mm. •109622_109630•
*NOR:	It's the same sort we had before that have been so good. •109630_109864•
        And the last couple of weeks I bought the cheaper ones. •109889_110237•
*CHR:	Yes. •110277_110323•
*NOR:	And that was forty eight pence for one grapefruit because it was pink. •110414_110765•
*CHR:	Doesn't even look pink, does it? •110954_111068•
*NOR:	No. •111454_111525•
*CHR:	Well I think you complain. •111610_111686•
        I don't think you have to take it back, I didn't take that chicken back to Safeway's if you remember. •111686_112031•
*NOR:	What chicken was that? •112125_112202•
*CHR:	The one that smelt. •112202_112294•
*NOR:	Did you complain? •112527_112586•
*CHR:	Yes. •112724_112756•
        Don't you remember that? •112892_112966•
*NOR:	I remember the chicken. •112966_113048•
        But I don't remember  •113048_113110•
*CHR:	Some months ago. •113110_113147•
        I took the label back. •113147_113258•
        Didn't take, didn't bother with the chicken. •113381_113526•
        And she didn't, she scarcely even looked at the label. •113555_113726•
        She took my word for it. •113736_113842•
        Unfortunately because it, it was a special sell today job with a reduction off others I didn't get much money back. •113924_114487•
        And then went and bought another fresh chicken  had to pay even more money for it. •114487_115213•
        . Ah. •115213_115230•
        Well it's incredible how little mail, and there's nothing on fax or telex either. •115276_116759•
*NOR:	They're all on holiday perhaps  half term. •116936_117904•
*CHR:	This is not nice. •117904_118041•
*NOR:	Looks revolting. •118154_118253•
*CHR:	Mm. •118253_118259•
        Well. •118259_118274•
*NOR:	Well don't bother, we'll take it back. •118299_118759•
*CHR:	Really not good. •118998_119176•
        Extraordinary. •119176_119239•
        Will you have toast? •119255_119859•
        Cake? •120263_120295•
        Sorry, will you have some toast? •120575_120713•
*NOR:	 (        )
