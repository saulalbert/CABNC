*TON:	Can you change your game, so you can play it with thr with two?
*CHR:	No, what you do
*TON:	Mm, mm.
*CHR:	is erm, well you do it, you've got one Joker in pack right, and you mix them up and you deal them out and you look at your cards, if you've got a Joker
*TON:	Mm.Yeah.Yeah
*CHR:	then, then you, everyone's got to mix up there cards again
*TON:	Mm.
*CHR:	You've got to put them in the order so you can see him, but the other person can't
*TON:	Mm.
*CHR:	and you've got to pick someone to choose out your card, and they don't know if you've got the Joker or not
*TON:	Mm, mm.
*CHR:	and they've got to pick one of the cards and they might get the Joker.
*TON:	Right, I see.
*CHR:	But, the trouble is you can tell who's got the Joker when there's two, because if you haven't, you know the other person has.
*TON:	Yeah.
*CHR:	But if you've got more than one person then it's harder.
*TON:	Mm, we could play pairs if you like.
*CHR:	Snap?
*TON:	Yeah, can play snap.
*CHR:	I put the same cards oh   (        ) and we can play  (        ) .
*TON:	Well, I won't, I'll play one game with you and then I'll go and get your tea   (.) alright?So.
