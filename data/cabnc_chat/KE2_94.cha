*MAR:	I was taking my very independent three year old daughter for a walk and I asked her to hold my hand. •756682_765322•
        I can hold my own hand thank you  came the reply and she did . •765842_769342•
*TER:	Yeah. •769842_770802•
        Tell you what, it's gonna be a strange journey up to Woodbridge •773382_787702•
*MAR:	Mm •788302_788482•
*TER:	because  where  all the sort of a route that I reckon I know  I, I am not gonna know it all. •789022_797802•
*MAR:	No. •849352_849542•
        Oh dear , you'd say this would be me   as I was leaving the travel agents I heard a woman say  my friend and I want to get away from it all, can you recommend somewhere completely unspoiled with a really nice shopping area . •850482_865292•
*TER:	Mm ah you're right there. •866242_868022•
        Somewhere like Trega Mills  •871322_877482•
*MAR:	Oh that's a good idea. •893672_903502•
*TER:	Good lord  •912252_912872•
*MAR:	Use dampened string when tying up parcels, when the string dries it shrinks and  •914492_919662•
*TER:	It tightens up. •919662_920262•
*MAR:	makes your parcel more secure . •920262_921462•
