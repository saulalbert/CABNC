*UNK:	Yes and he said  he's very bright! •641365_644535•
        He said but unfortunately  because he's boisterous, which he is  and because it's easier for them with their numbers to let him just get away with it or  say oh Martin go outside we can't, you know, then then he wasn't  learning to  •644725_656405•
*TER:	That's right! •656405_656695•
*UNK:	his full capacity. •656695_657655•
        So where he is now, they really stretch them but they unwind them in the afternoons by games and and  •658175_662915•
*TER:	That's it. •662915_663235•
*UNK:	and, you know  •663235_663825•
*TER:	Yeah. •663885_664105•
*UNK:	, and drama  •664135_664455•
*TER:	That's right! •664735_665505•
*TER:	and  er as it should be done. •665505_667285•
        And he's getting on very well. •667285_668805•
        Because he went to Little Abbotsbury Prep School and at the age of four  I mean, he could read and read quite well actually, and erm write  very well actually! •668805_678745•
        And do lots of things that I knew he was capable of doing. •678745_681635•
        And I learnt from various teachers that when you go to these private schools and they've been to  schools, they hold them back  because they like, they don't like the •681635_689695•
*TER:	They don't like somebody  •689695_690615•
*UNK:	No. •690615_690675•
        They  •690675_690865•
*TER:	That's right! •690875_691235•
*UNK:	they, they like   •691235_691565•
*TER:	it it it upsets the system! •691565_692845•
        Yep! •692845_693025•
*UNK:	But like there  and be all the same and that really upset me! •693025_696575•
        And I thought my God you know we've got him really on this far •696575_698945•
*TER:	That's right! •698955_699415•
        And then it gets held back! •699415_700535•
*UNK:	and then he played in the afternoons! •700535_701665•
        And I  , you know at six and I said my God  he did that at Abbotsbury when he was four! •701665_705155•
*TER:	That's right! •705675_706315•
*UNK:	And so,I mean it was to me it was a total waste of time over there! •706395_708595•
        I'll be honest with you. •709235_710015•
*TER:	Yeah. •710015_710255•
*UNK:	And I live so near  •710255_710725•
*TER:	I know! •710725_711135•
*UNK:	that damn school it really, I thought  •711135_712375•
*TER:	It's a shame because years ago when Miss what was her  •712385_714445•
*UNK:	Miss . •714910_715030•
*TER:	Miss   and they had a lovely violin group there  and  •715545_718515•
*UNK:	But it's down to head though isn't it? •718515_719395•
*TER:	I mean  •719395_719745•
*UNK:	You know? •719745_720075•
