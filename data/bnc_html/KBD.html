               [5151]  [phonecall starts] Francis?<br>
               [5152] It's Jean here.<br>
               [5153] I   ... yes, I've just had my massive little row with The Savoy   ... about the prices and they just wanted to charge us the normal price!<br>
               [5154] So I've said they can get stood on.<br>
               [5155] And I booked at the Claremont   ... which is, twenty eight pounds.<br>
               [5156] Well, I'm not being prepared to be held to ransom by them.<br>
               [5157] And I'm, I'm faxing   ... erm   ... I'm sorry, I'm not gonna fax it, I'm just going to send a letter to national office   ... about The Savoy in First Leisure.<br>
               [5158] Because they can't do this to delegates!<br>
               [5159] Cos they did it with you last year didn't they?<br>
               [5160] Mm.<br>
               [5161]  ... Yeah.<br>
               [5162] Yeah.<br>
               [5163] Well, I think we should tell national office that this is, you know, this is happening and it's not on!<br>
               [5164]  ... I've got   ... I'll tell you what I've got, I've got for nineteen ninety two   ... confere Register of Conference Accommodation, from national office   ... whe where they tell you to book!<br>
               [5165] You know, cos I'd got it at a P P C as well, for national conference.<br>
               [5166] So I've actually two you see.<br>
               [5167] So   ... erm   ... I'm sending one back to national office saying, these hotels are sending confirmation at the full price for local government conference.<br>
               [5168] Now   ... I, I've rung the Claremont and they've said, oh yes, it's the conference erm   ... you know   ... amount   ... and we're very,appar we were, I was very lucky cos we got the last three rooms.<br>
               [5169] And she said, we're absolutely booked up!<br>
               [5170] But, you see Bob told me about it, he said, well he, you know   ... booked at the Claremont because he'd had problems getting prices out of the others.<br>
               [5171] But, our union always stay at the Claremont and we've always found it, you know, okay.<br>
               [5172] But I'm, I'm not paying sixty five quid a night!<br>
               [5173] It's just stupid Francis!<br>
               [5174] Cos you're never in it.<br>
               [5175] I mean, you always go to   ... you know, somewhere else don't you?<br></td>

               [5179] And that's what it says.<br>
               [5180] It was, was when I went Francis.<br>
               [5181] Night porter, Q is lifts to all floor, and S is swimming pool   ... and I know there's a swimming pool because   ... not that I ever used it, but   ... ma it, it was when I booked Francis.<br>
               [5182] It's right on the prom on the corner on, on North Prom.<br>
               [5183] It's not far from the Imperial Francis.<br>
               [5184] So   ... but it was erm   ... just go on that bit of the prom, it's huge!<br>
               [5185] It's a huge hotel on the corner.<br>
               [5186] You can't miss it.<br>
               [5187] I'll, I'll give you the o the address anyway.<br>
               [5188] Erm, two hundred and seventy North Prom.<br>
               [5189]  ... Yeah.<br>
               [5190] Two seventy North Prom.<br>
               [5191] Erm, and you just say what   ... yeah, two seventy North Prom.<br>
               [5192] It's, it's pa just past, if you keep going past the Pembroke   ... it's there.<br>
               [5193] But erm   ... that's right, going out.<br>
               [5194] Yes.<br>
               [5195] It's just past there.<br>
               [5196] You can't lose it Francis, cos it's one of the major hotels.<br>
               [5197] Yeah.<br>
               [5198] They've got, they've got lots of bars, there's a bar in the basement and there's bars upstairs, and a dance floor and a swimming pool and   ... I'm sure it will Francis.<br>
               [5199] I mean   ... yeah, well I don't blame him.<br>
               [5200] But it says   ... number of bedrooms available with private bathroom and toilet, or shower and toilet.<br>
               [5201] There are very few hotels of this standard that don't have showers and toilets.<br>
               [5202] So   ... it's twenty eight Francis, which is, I think is   ... yes.<br>
               [5203] Yes.<br>
               [5204] Well, it doesn't matter where we go to eat does it?<br>
               [5205] And we, can go and eat wherever we want.<br>
               [5206] Oh!<br>
               [5207] But   ... th you can have bed and breakfast and evening meal if you want.<br>
               [5208] Erm, but generally,ye I mean cos Eileen and I go to a    [...]  ... we nearly always go somewhere like Carriages or   ... you know, somewhere Italian   ... which is, you know, it might, it all depends on what Jim's eating at the time.<br>
               [5209] But, but   ... you can't go wrong, there's plenty to eat in Blackpool can you?<br>
               [5210] In fact, I'm trying to think of a place that erm   ... we once went when we   ... at regional conference, it was behind the Claremont somewhere.<br>
               [5211] It was a   ... it was a   ... little Italian restaurant with about forty six   ... and we went at regional conference and it was astounding!<br>
               [5212] It was a really brilliant chef!<br>
               [5213] I'll try and get Bob to find the   ... the number of it.<br>
               [5214] Cos that was really   ... a really nice place.<br>
               [5215] But, you wouldn't have expected to find it where you found it.<br>
               [5216] No.<br>
               [5217] You know the road behind the promenade?<br>
               [5218] It was on that road.<br>
               [5219] And we only found it by chance, you know how you go off to   ... think oh I'll, I'll go and find a coffee or something, and we found this restaurant at lunch time and had a coffee there   ... and we looked at the menu and, you know, we, we couldn't believe it!<br>
               [5220] Yeah.<br>
               [5221] Well I'll try, I'll try and get Bob to remember the name of it.<br>
               [5222] Alright.<br>
               [5223] And so I'll see you when we get there Francis.<br>
               [5224] I said we'll a probably arrive early afternoon.<br>
               [5225] So   ... no   ... doesn't   ... well you know what he'll be like, he'll be messing about all day.<br>
               [5226] But I know Kinnock's speaking at four isn't he?<br>
               [5227] So we   ... I want to   ... Yeah.<br>
               [5228] Yeah.<br>
               [5229] Oh well he'll have to be then.<br>
               [5230] Yeah.<br>
               [5231]  ... Yeah.<br>
               [5232] That's alright.<br>
               [5233] Don't worry.<br>
               [5234] I'll, I'll look after  [...] .<br>
               [5235] Because there's erm   ... there's   ... Geoff and Louise are staying with us, and Eileen and I are staying.<br>
               [5236] You and Jim are staying.<br>
               [5237] And I know that Bob and Sue have booked at the Claremont so there'll be quite a few of us there.<br>
               [5238] So, I'll, I'll keep an eye on us.<br>
               [5239] And I'll go and have a look at your room.<br>
               [5240]  [laugh]  ... Just to make sure everything's alright   ... before he gets there.<br>
               [5241] Right.<br>
               [5242] Thanks Francis.<br>
