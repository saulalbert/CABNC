                           well, but then I thought ... well that's stupid that
                           is because ... you weren't as ... as bad as Pete was

                           advantage of him, it really
Emma (PS0EC)               [436] Yeah.

Emma (PS0EC)               [445] He thinks like, okay fair enough ... lets have
                           a bit of snog you know, fair enough, whatever else!
                           [446] But like

                           [451] ... He's probably just jealous!
Helena (PS0EB)             [452] Well like I said, I said that, I said that to
                           Pete and Pete goes, God I wish he'd make up his

Emma (PS0EC)               [453] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [454] So he'd obviously sa ... not said it, I mean

                           don't, I don't know, Andy really surprises me
                           because like ... he always seems to be like, the
                           quiet one doesn't it?

                           whatever he ... he
Helena (PS0EB)             [462] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [463] doesn't get involved because everything
                           revolves round him doesn't it?
Helena (PS0EB)             [464] Yeah.
Emma (PS0EC)               [465] But like ... everybody,eve
Helena (PS0EB)             [466] It's his house everyone goes to isn't it?
Emma (PS0EC)               [467] Everybody seems to ... Andy seems to know
                           everything!

                           [471] But like, I don't mind ... cos I know he won't
                           say anything.
Helena (PS0EB)             [472] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [473] I mean ... flipping talk about keeping it a
                           secret!

                           after Scott had told him ... and like, I was crying
                           ... at the door, and he goes ... ahh, is something

                           [476] ... And er, he goes ... oh I don't expect, has
                           it got anything to do with Helena and Joan?

                           honest.
                           [572] ... I got

                           ... you know, that stripy top on?
Emma (PS0EC)               [575] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [576] And my mum, my mum was sat in ... The Weathers
                           with me ... and I'd talked to her and everything and
                           I didn't even know that that
Emma (PS0EC)               [577] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [578] one was there!
                           [579] And like, [laugh] ... but like, I got
Emma (PS0EC)               [...]
Helena (PS0EB)             [580] up the next morning and I just went ... oh
                           Jesus!
Emma (PS0EC)               [581] But there was
Helena (PS0EB)             [582] They were like
Emma (PS0EC)               [583] this one
Helena (PS0EB)             [584] still
Emma (PS0EC)               [585] and
Helena (PS0EB)             [586] up there and the one on my back as well!
Emma (PS0EC)               [587] And Scott, Scott did this and like ... and erm
                           ... he goes ... oh it's not that bad!
                           [588] And I goes, oh you stupid git!
                           [589] Why did you have to do it there for, you know?
                           [590] Put my school shirt on, oh you won't see it!
                           [591] Oh no won't see it with that flipping big
                           collar on my school shirt!
                           [592] Actually, you couldn't see it, but you could
                           see it through anyway so it didn't make really that
                           much difference.
                           [593] But like, I got the mirror down and like, I
                           looked at it ... and whether it was the light or
                           whether it just hadn't come up cos it was only like,
                           a few seconds afterwards
Helena (PS0EB)             [594] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [595] I looked at it and it was just like sort of,
                           light brown ... and I thought oh that's not too bad!
                           [596] I got home and it was like, glowing [laughing]
                           and I'm thinking oh my God!

                           neck and I thought ... and like I was ... I was

                           wasn't bad ... like, cos all the time I was just
                           wearing like polo necks or like ... shirts with high
                           collars and stuff cos it wasn't actually on my neck
                           it was just like on my, this one.

Helena (PS0EB)             [624] Oh!
Emma (PS0EC)               [625] isn't it?
Helena (PS0EB)             [626] And I was thinking, oh ... I wa ... honestly I
                           didn't know they were there.
Emma (PS0EC)               [627] But like, Scott was going to me ... he was
                           going to me, oh stop complaining or I'll give you

                           [642] Shut up before I punch your face in!
                           [643] But like erm ... no one else saw it.
                           [644] But, I tell you what, it was so embarrassing!
                           [645] The, it was the Mo , the Monday after the
                           Saturday got, the Saturday it was done, I had P E
                           ... oh great!
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [646] So there's me like ... I'm sat in first lesson
                           we have ... P E last lesson ... sat in the first
                           lesson ... and I'm th , I've thought ... God my bra

                           [647] ... So I'm right ... I thought ... oh my God!
                           [648] ... There's a gap in between, they're not
                           attached any more!
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [649] [laughing] What would you do [] ?
                           [650] ... [...] . ... I mean, like, okay it wasn't

Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [651] [laughing] [...] exploding everywhere wouldn't
                           she [] !
                           [652] But like, I was thinking ... this is gonna be
                           so embarrassing like in P E!
                           [653] [laughing] With ha half a bra on [] !
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [654] [laughing] [...] [] !
Helena (PS0EB)             [655] [laughing] [...] ... my cups down ... my cups
                           down to my waist [] !
Emma (PS0EC)               [656] I sa , I was sat there and ... and then we was
                           in maths, like the lesson before and I was going
                           Zena, I don't wanna do P E!
                           [657] I just do not want to do P E!
                           [658] And she's going, why not?
                           [659] You like P E, I don't wanna do it Zena ...
                           will you write me a letter to get me out of it?
                           [660] She's going ... no I won't, you know, not
                           unless you tell me what it i , why it is you don't
                           wanna do it!
                           [661] So in the end I wro , I wrote her this letter
                           because I couldn't say it out loud [laughing] in
                           case anyone else heard me!
                           [662] And say that I've busted my bra strap [] !
                           [663] So she goes, oh don't worry about it.
                           [664] Like, we go into the loo and like, you can
                           mend it.
Helena (PS0EB)             [665] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [666] So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all,
                           okay, I thought, cos like, some of them have got the
                           loop actually on the, the like on the top of the cup
                           haven't they?
Helena (PS0EB)             [667] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [668] Did this one?
                           [669] No!
                           [670] The loop's attached to the end of the strap!
                           [671] It's a bit of the cup that's actually come
                           apart, unsewn!
                           [672] So that meant I had to get ... the part of
                           the, the top bit of the cup, thread it through the
                           hoo , the hoop and then tie it in a knot!
                           [673] So like, you can imagine ... I had to have all
                           the strap completely undone ... so like ... the, the
                           buckle was like down here! [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [674] [laugh] ... And above the knot!
Helena (PS0EB)             [675] Comfortable then?
Emma (PS0EC)               [676] Well [...] it wasn't, it wasn't that bad but
                           like ... it was really weird because like ... you
                           could see like, people like, especially the lads,
                           just sort of looking at you ... and then like ...
                           not meaning to be pervy but just like, looking again
                           as if to think ... why has Emma got a, a
                           extraordinary lump [laughing] on half the top of her
                           boob, you know [] !
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [677] [laughing] It's like a lump there!
                           [678] They're thinking, mm, a shame [] !
                           [679] But like, it was alright then because like ...
                           means that you can changed up in this one corner of
                           the changing room all the time ... and so ... I'd
                           got my shirt on while I was putting my T-shirt on
                           ... like ... for the reason that my bra strap was
                           bust, not actually because I'd got a gigantic
                           [laughing] love bite around my neck [] !
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [680] But like er
Helena (PS0EB)             [681] But I mean
Emma (PS0EC)               [682] So that was alright really.
Helena (PS0EB)             [683] But, I couldn't believe it cos I ... he goes
                           to me, what do you think of love bites?
                           [684] And I goes, I think they're horrible to be
                           quite honest, I don't
Emma (PS0EC)               [685] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [686] like them!
Emma (PS0EC)               [687] Same as me!
                           [688] I goes to Scott, I really really [laughing]
                           hate love bites [] ... and er ... and he goes, yeah
                           and me.
                           [689] The only time he's ever had one was at this
                           kid's party ... Fran , Franny someone, he's
                           [laughing] actually a bloke [] !
Helena (PS0EB)             [690] [laughing] Ooh that's []
Emma (PS0EC)               [691] [laughing] I said that's [] ... he went to

Helena (PS0EB)             [717] At least
Emma (PS0EC)               [718] really disgusting!
                           [719] Cos like, Scott was going I've never gave

                           off the conversation where was the perviest you've
                           ever had one ... I mean, knowing that I didn't have
                           one, ever had one before ... and that was Mark ,
                           feeble attempt that lasted about ten minutes
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [721] [laughing] I think [] !
                           [722] And I was really upset about that as you can
                           imagine!
                           [723] But like erm ... what was I saying?
                           [724] Oh yeah ... so I was going what's the perviest
                           place?
                           [725] I was thinking, you know, Scotts bound to have
                           some pervy ones off Mandy [...] !
                           [726] But like er, and he was going oh I've never

                           bloke! [...] [] .
Helena (PS0EB)             [727] Girls don't do it to boys as much as boys do
                           it to girls though do they?
Emma (PS0EC)               [728] No I know.
                           [729] ... That is really sick though!
Helena (PS0EB)             [730] I certainly don't think so anyway.
Emma (PS0EC)               [731] I think that's really disgusting, they look
                           silly!
Helena (PS0EB)             [732] I think it looks awful on boys!
                           [733] I mean, it looks bad enough on girls but I
                           mean
Emma (PS0EC)               [734] I know, it looks really cheap doesn't it?
Helena (PS0EB)             [735] Yeah.
Emma (PS0EC)               [736] Sort of like ... eh eh eh eh eh!
Helena (PS0EB)             [737] But I didn't ... that's why it's
Emma (PS0EC)               [738] I'm a big slag!
Helena (PS0EB)             [739] that's why I
Emma (PS0EC)               [740] Ha!

Emma (PS0EC)               [742] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [743] At school.
Emma (PS0EC)               [744] You didn't tell anyone like, except ... Joe
                           then told Stuart, [laughing] Mr [] !
Helena (PS0EB)             [745] Really funny!

Helena (PS0EB)             [787] But
Emma (PS0EC)               [788] But like, he was really sounding off at Joe!
                           [789] And like, I mean ... he didn't know about

                           [800] ... Ah, but is he coming on Saturday?
Helena (PS0EB)             [801] [...] hasn't he?
Emma (PS0EC)               [802] He's
Helena (PS0EB)             [803] Oh ... I asked him
Emma (PS0EC)               [804] You've asked [...] ?
Helena (PS0EB)             [805] I asked him whether he was and
Emma (PS0EC)               [806] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [807] he said ... that he wa ... he didn't know, he
                           was either coming now or was going to Tramps [...] .
Emma (PS0EC)               [808] Yeah.
                           [809] ... Cos someone said last night they were
                           going to Tramps but whether that was just like, they
                           might be going to Tramps or what.
                           [810] This bra's too small, I'll have to get a new
                           one!
Helena (PS0EB)             [811] But
Emma (PS0EC)               [laugh]
Helena (PS0EB)             [812] I think he'll probably go to Tramps to be
                           quite honest.
                           [813] I think
Emma (PS0EC)               [814] Mm.
Helena (PS0EB)             [815] prob , I think Susan might be going actually.
Emma (PS0EC)               [816] Mm.
Helena (PS0EB)             [817] And if it's a toss up between me and Susan
                           it's, [laughing] yeah Susan [] !

Emma (PS0EC)               [823] [...] ... offensively.
Helena (PS0EB)             [824] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [825] But like ... he goes on on and on, don't he
                           about how wonderful Susan is and then ... you know
                           ... he gets drunk and that's it isn't it?
Helena (PS0EB)             [826] But ... like, he even said it, he said to me
                           when I was drunk and I, and it pissed me off a
                           little bit actually cos like, he goes to me ... you

                           and went, scowled at him for a bit!
Emma (PS0EC)               [842] Yeah.

                           [1311] ... Well
Helena (PS0EB)             [1312] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [1313] I mean ... well I thought to myself, God what
                           a life!
                           [1314] ... I mean, I know it's not her fault ... but
                           like, every Wednesday she has ... all the people
                           from the college bridge [...] go to her house to
                           play bridge.
                           [1315] ... I mean the kid's
Helena (PS0EB)             [1316] Poor kid!
Emma (PS0EC)               [1317] just sat there on the sofa!
                           [1318] ... I mean, okay, he goes to bed about, what,
                           eight o'clock or whatever?
                           [1319] ... But like, I mean ... God, do you know I'd
                           really hate that!
                           [1320] I mean, I used to hate it with like ...
                           having ... flipping ... anyone come up to our house
                           when I was little!
Helena (PS0EB)             [1321] Yeah.
                           [1322] ... I remember, I remember once
Emma (PS0EC)               [1323] Apparently his mum's hardly there!
                           [1324] ... Because ... the baby-sitter she's got at
                           the moment right ... she said she doesn't mind doing
                           ... Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays ... as well as the
                           weekends ... but she doesn't wanna do every day ...
                           each week.
                           [1325] ... Ma , how much does she go out?
                           [1326] ... I mean, God, the poor kid I feel really
                           sorry for him!
Helena (PS0EB)             [1327] [sigh] Yeah!
                           [1328] ... I mean ... ooh!
Emma (PS0EC)               [1329] That's why she's asked me to do it, but like
                           I said to mum ... you know, I'm not gonna say to
                           her, oh yeah I'll do it whenever you want, I'll say
                           like ... they're gonna do this extra course on
                           Wednesday nights ... and she said, like ... unless
                           she could get a baby-sitter she couldn't go ...
                           which is the reason I'm doing it.
                           [1330] ... So like
Helena (PS0EB)             [1331] Just say you'll do it Wednesday night.
Emma (PS0EC)               [1332] Yeah ... say I can do it Wednesday nights,
                           apart from that, you know ... it's too bad sort of
                           thing!
                           [1333] So I think I'm gonna change my nights ...
                           this, of staying in ... to either Mo , Monday and
                           Wednesday or ... Tuesday and Wednesday ... something
                           like that.
                           [1334] I don't know really!
                           [1335] ... But like, like erm ... that'd be quite
                           good because if I go to someone else 's house like,
                           you don't wanna be sort of like, messing about with
                           all, all the stuff, you haven't got anything to ...
                           mess about with, do your hair or whatever can you?
Helena (PS0EB)             [1336] No.
Emma (PS0EC)               [1337] Mess around with your make up.
                           [1338] ... So I can get loads of homework done ...
                           and erm ... like I can count that as one of my
                           nights in.
Helena (PS0EB)             [1339] Mm.
Emma (PS0EC)               [1340] So that'll be quite useful I reckon really
                           ... as well as getting a bit of money.
Helena (PS0EB)             [1341] Well, oh my mum's having such a fit about
                           like ... on our er, exam leads ... like er ... she

                           lock them in the, lock them in the shed all day,
                           take
Emma (PS0EC)               [1347] Mm.
Helena (PS0EB)             [1348] the keys with her ... and take the er, plug
                           off the telly ... so we've got nothing to ... occupy
                           us!

Emma (PS0EC)               [1350] Mm.
Helena (PS0EB)             [1351] Because ... we're both such weak willed
                           people, honestly!
Emma (PS0EC)               [1352] Same as me.
                           [1353] ... I mean, I've got a, I've got a French

                           [1354] So she goes, I want it first thing tomorrow

                           ... came to a word I didn't know and thought ... ah

               I don't really want to.
David (PS0EE)  [1904] No I shouldn't worry [...]
Helena (PS0EB) [1905] Cos er , she's gotta go cos her brother's in it.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1906] [...] shouldn't you?

David (PS0EE)  [1910] A B and a C ... that is.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1911] Yeah, but A, it says a two ... I mean, if you get three
               then you can get Nottingham couldn't
David (PS0EE)  [1912] Yeah.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1913] you?
David (PS0EE)  [1914] Yeah.
               [1915] ... Well ... three C's ... must be over the points then.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1916] Right
Helena (PS0EB) [whistling]
Sheila (PS0ED) [1917] Er ... [...]
Helena (PS0EB) [whistling]
David (PS0EE)  [1918] Not like that feller yesterday said that ... really they
               can er ... they can refuse if you get
Sheila (PS0ED) [1919] Well yeah!
David (PS0EE)  [1920] a di difference of their point stipulation
Sheila (PS0ED) [1921] Oh, yeah.
David (PS0EE)  [1922] and er ... their gra , grade stipulation so ... even if
               you got ... three A's they can still refuse you.
               [1923] ... He said that ... he said it doesn't happen in York,
               but it has happened in some places ... you know.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1924] I could understand them refusing you if they'd asked for
               ... say, a B in english and C in something else
David (PS0EE)  [1925] Yes.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1926] and you got D in English and D in so , although it may
               not be the point, or C.
David (PS0EE)  [1927] Yes.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1928] Because ... then you ... you wouldn't ... certainly up,
               be up to the standard would you?
               [1929] In that particular
David (PS0EE)  [1930] No.
Helena (PS0EB) [1931] Mm.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1932] er ... particular thing.
Helena (PS0EB) [1933] But I suppose ... espec , like if you got really really
               good grades ... you'd be ... different to the group.
               [1934] ... You know, say if they wanted to get you three C's and
               you got three A's ... shut up Sam!
               [1935] ... You could be lot ... a lot different to the group.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1936] The higher standard?
Helena (PS0EB) [1937] Yeah.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1938] Mm.
Helena (PS0EB) [1939] Which might make it more difficult to teach.
Sheila (PS0ED) [1940] Yeah, I suppose it would.
               [1941] ... True!
               [1942] ... Would it make an effect?
Helena (PS0EB) [1943] Mm.

                           sometime.

                           might have ju ge , been getting over dramatic or
                           something!
                           [2335] ... But she ... but ... her period was a week

                           down to my house ... and she was really, really,
                           really in a happy mood!

                           a daddy [] !
Joanne (PS0EF)             [2342] Fucking hell, [...] !
                           [2343] I hope she hadn't done it that Saturday when
                           we all were outside and we watching

Joanne (PS0EF)             [2351] If she's given him a blow job, I mean
Helena (PS0EB)             [2352] But I mean, she's probably done something
                           like that ... and ... she's just got over dramatic
                           about it! ... [...]

                           [2357] But I don't think I can rely on myself to
                           take them everyday!
Helena (PS0EB)             [2358] If you was there you could take them, too

Helena (PS0EB)             [3690] Well about all this business with Shrimpy.
                           ...
Joanne (PS0EF)             [3691] Yeah but you, you must admit Shrimpy's trying
                           his damn hardest.
Helena (PS0EB)             [3692] I, I, I mean I don't know, I wasn't there for
                           half the things she was talking about last night, I
                           mean I was upstairs for three quarters of an hour
                           trying to go to sleep [...]
Joanne (PS0EF)             [3693] Yeah well I mean I was there and all they did
                           was they didn't say anything to each other, in the
                           same room, just acted totally normally but didn't
                           say anything to each other .
                           [3694] ... Shrimpy's trying his flipping nice to try
                           and let this drop and just [...] .
                           [3695] We all know he still fancies her ... he's
                           just trying to, you know ... keep it ... he's just
                           trying to forget it and try and act as normal as
                           possible with her and hopefully things will get back
                           to be back to ... what, what they were.
                           [3696] ... But flipping Scott, mister interferior
Helena (PS0EB)             [3697] [laughing] Interferior [] ? [laugh]
Joanne (PS0EF)             [3698] Yeah interferer.
                           [3699] Flipping ... no, it really annoys me that
                           does.
                           [3700] They're always going on about how much
                           Shrimpy ... gets other people involved and ... can't
                           ... stick up for himself aren't they?
                           [3701] And bloody ... Scott runs rushing off and
                           thinks he's mister hard man.
                           [3702] [...] ... What sort of things are you gonna
                           say anyway?
Helena (PS0EB)             [3703] Well I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna say that
                           Joanne's a bit worried about Shrimpy ... which is
                           true
Joanne (PS0EF)             [3704] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [3705] you know?
                           [3706] And I'm just gonna say ... you know, I think
                           it would ... be better if Scott didn't rush in like
                           that, you know?
                           [3707] ... I can understand why he did it, to be
                           quite honest.
Joanne (PS0EF)             [3708] Yeah but you say to her ... that they're
                           always on about how s Shrimpy can't do anything for
                           himself, and it's between Emma, it's not between ...
                           it was al ... even Scott said to me at the beginning
                           oh it's not between me, it's nothing to do with me,
                           it's between Emma and Scott.
Helena (PS0EB)             [3709] Emma and Shrimpy.
Joanne (PS0EF)             [3710] Emma and Shrimpy then.
                           [3711] And erm ... he's been, then he rushes ahead
                           full storm ... don't he?
Helena (PS0EB)             [3712] Mm.
                           [3713] He shouldn't have done that really, he was a
                           bit naughty.
Joanne (PS0EF)             [3714] He,sh she ought to learn to sh she's, they
                           was all on about how Shrimpy can't stick up for
                           himself, and then flaming ... Emma does exactly the
                           same but worse cos she gets Scott to do it for her.
                           [3715] ... She's gonna have to one of these, I'm not
                           being funny but she can't stick up for herself, that
                           girl can't.
                           [3716] It's about time she had the courage to do it,
                           herself if she's in a strop.
                           [3717] There's no point getting Scott, cos what's
                           gonna happen when she finishes with Scott?
                           [3718] ... She really [...]

                           [4712] Why didn't you do it, start it earlier?
Scott (PS0EH)              [4713] Because Debbie is a stupid bitch.

                           about erm
Helena (PS0EB)             [5438] Oh A why do men insist on doing disgusting
                           things to their hair?

                           ponytail except for a bit at the front dripping
                           down.
                           [5448] Excellent
Emma (PS0EC)               [...]
Helena (PS0EB)             [5449] It takes honestly it takes so much willpower
                           to grow your hair it really does.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5450] I know it that's why I cut mine.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5451] It get, it gets, it gets to about that length

Andy (PS0EG)               [5452] [...] no it gets to shoulder, it gets to
                           shoulder length ... well remember mine did, [...]
                           mine before I had it cut
Helena (PS0EB)             [5453] Oh that wasn't shoulder length.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5454] Yeah.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5455] No well it was like down to there.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5456] [laugh] It was when it grew from here.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5457] And that, and that, and that was a like a
                           really [...] .
                           [5458] It began to annoy me.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5459] Yeah my hair was that long when I had it cut.
                           [5460] It really cheesed me off. ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [5461] If you, you get it to a certain length ...
                           and it's a bit too short to have the layers cut out,
                           cos you need it all the same length really and it
                           pisses you off so much.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5462] It's too, it's too long to do anything with
                           and to short to
Helena (PS0EB)             [5463] Yeah.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5464] it's too short to
Helena (PS0EB)             [5465] Cut [...]
Andy (PS0EG)               [5466] like
Helena (PS0EB)             [5467] It's too sh
Andy (PS0EG)               [5468] Style.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5469] look, start ... yeah, too short to look
                           stylish and too long to do anything with
Helena (PS0EB)             [5470] Yeah.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5471] so it just sort of there [...]
Emma (PS0EC)               [5472] Yeah, too heavy innit sort of thing.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5473] Yeah.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5474] If you can have it c if you can have it cut
                           all one length it's alright then.
Emma (PS0EC)               [5475] Your perm's quite [...] now innit?
Andy (PS0EG)               [5476] I was thinking of having extensions actually,
                           in my hair ... till it grew.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5477] Having what?
Andy (PS0EG)               [5478] Extensions.
Emma (PS0EC)               [5479] Do you know how much they cost?
Andy (PS0EG)               [5480] Yeah about forty quid.
Emma (PS0EC)               [5481] Yeah that's not for a lot though, that isn't.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5482] That's [...] for your whole head [...] .
                           [5483] It is, forty quid.
                           [5484] I mean he just leaves the
Emma (PS0EC)               [5485] You've gotta have your hair longer than that
                           though.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5486] you have, it probably you can't,ye yeah but
                           my hair was the right length before.
                           [5487] That's when I was gonna have it done.
                           [5488] But er
Andy (PS0EG)               [5489] Wanna keep ... wanna keep mine short at the
                           back now. ...
Emma (PS0EC)               [5490] Yeah I think, I think
Andy (PS0EG)               [5491] You, you can't wash your hair for about ...
                           er when you have extensions
Emma (PS0EC)               [5492] I don't like men having long hair.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5493] you can't wash your hair for about two months
                           or something like that.
Emma (PS0EC)               [5494] Don't suit them.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5495] Cos [...] had it done, he never washes his,
                           like erm went for about four months without washing
                           his hair and it, it really did reek.
                           [5496] It was horrible, it just smelt.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5497] If you leave it for so long though
Andy (PS0EG)               [5498] Really bad.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5499] it starts cleaning itself and it's alright
                           then.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5500] Well his didn't.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5501] But you have to leave it for like months.
Emma (PS0EC)               [5502] Are you growing your hair again? ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [5503] Are you? ...
Andy (PS0EG)               [5504] Alright this is a good one
Helena (PS0EB)             [5505] I thought about having mine permed actually.
                           [laugh]
Emma (PS0EC)               [5506] It won't suit you.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5507] What?
Emma (PS0EC)               [5508] It won't suit you.
Joanne (PS0EF)             [5509] Don't start that.
                           [5510] From my experience of perms ... I wouldn't
                           bother.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5511] Perms are okay if ... [...]
Emma (PS0EC)               [5512] Yeah but it depends whose hair it is.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5513] having to look stupid [...] drop out and look
                           okay [...]
Andy (PS0EG)               [5514] Here you are And this is a good one ...
                           diskette fire ... you [...] computer [...] you need
                           a disk, some scissors, white or blue kitchen matches
                           so [...] and clear nail polish.
                           [5515] The reason they've gotta be those colours is
                           erm [...] and clear nail polish.
                           [5516] Carefully open up the diskette three point
                           five inches for the best effect and it's like my
                           Amiga one ... remove the top covering from the
                           inside, scrape a lot of match powder into a bowl
                           [...] match powder.
                           [5517] After you have a lot, spread it evenly on the
                           inside disk.
                           [5518] Using nail polish spread it over the match
                           [...] mixture, let it dry, carefully put diskette
                           back together [...] nail polish to seal it, do it on
                           the inside where it came apart.
                           [5519] When that disk is in a drive the drive head
                           [...] to read the disk which causes a small fire ...
                           inside [...] disk drive [...] ha ha ha ha, let the
                           fuckhead try and fix that.
                           [5520] [laugh] It melts all your disk drive.
                           [5521] Start all, start a fire.
                           [5522] Excellent eh? [...] bomb, this is good.
Joanne (PS0EF)             [5523] Well on mine she did it once, it didn't work
                           so she did it again for free and then it all started
                           breaking off.
                           [5524] It fell out the day after.
Emma (PS0EC)               [5525] It's probably your hair then.
Joanne (PS0EF)             [5526] Then I grew it out
Emma (PS0EC)               [...]
Joanne (PS0EF)             [5527] then I grew it out and then it was all
                           brittle still so I had it cut.
                           [5528] And now I'm growing it.

                           it is real nice and tight then when you see a geek

Helena (PS0EB)             [5565] What?
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5566] [...] ... what?
Helena (PS0EB)             [5567] They're doing a survey
Andy (PS0EG)               [5568] Here you are, napalm napalm lightbulb.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5569] on like what words different [...]
Andy (PS0EG)               [5570] Heat kerosene and [...] gasoline in a double
                           boiler, melt soap chips and stir in slowly, put
                           somewhere and allow to cool.
                           [5571] Heat the thread of the bulb very carefully to
                           melt the glue, remove thread slowing drawing out the

                           hell out. [laugh]
Helena (PS0EB)             [5573] [...] and like what accent people are talking

mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [...]
Helena (PS0EB)             [5574] Yeah.
                           [5575] Well it's how we, it's how we usually talk
                           isn't it?
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5576] [...] that much usually.
Helena (PS0EB)             [5577] What?
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5578] We don't [...] that much [...]

Andy (PS0EG)               [5580] When the victim switches the switch he will
                           be in for a big surprise.
                           [5581] ... Basically you've killed him.
                           [5582] ... It just blows the whole room up.
                           [5583] [laughing] Have fun it says underneath [] .

Helena (PS0EB)             [5584] [...] till tomorrow.
                           [5585] I've only done three tapes, he gave me
                           twenty.
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5586] He gave you twenty tapes?
Andy (PS0EG)               [5587] Yeah here you are this is a good one, calcium
                           carbine bomb [...] .
                           [5588] This is extremely dangerous.
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5589] And they wanted you to do all of them?
Helena (PS0EB)             [5590] No.
                           [5591] You only have to do as many as you can.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5592] Exercise extreme caution.
                           [5593] Obtain some calcium carbine this is [...] and
                           can be found at nearly every hardware store.
                           [5594] Take a few pieces of this stuff, it looks
                           like gravel
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5595] You've brought a load round with you now have
                           you, to do? [laugh]
Helena (PS0EB)             [5596] What?
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5597] Are you gonna do a load [...] tonight?
Helena (PS0EB)             [5598] No.
                           [5599] I'll give him whatever I do.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5600] and put it in a glass jar with some water,
                           put a lid on tightly.
                           [5601] The carbine will react with the water to
                           produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the
                           gas used in cutting torches.
                           [5602] Eventually the glass will explode from
                           internal pressure, it will leave a burning ragged
                           hole and you get a nice fire ball.
                           [5603] [laugh] Be excellent wouldn't it?

Andy (PS0EG)               [5619] Yeah.
Joanne (PS0EF)             [5620] Don't matter then.
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Andy (PS0EG)               [5621] No, what your whiff
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5622] Don't keep mine in there cos he uses it.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5623] [...] What?
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5624] You use my deodorant if I leave it in there.

Andy (PS0EG)               [5627] No [...] it stinks.

Andy (PS0EG)               [5630] Haven't got any in there [...]
mark/shrimpy (PS0EJ)       [5631] Not that one.
                           [5632] What, which one is it you had ... not, you
                           got yeah and you haven't got it any more.
                           [5633] It was really sick it was
Andy (PS0EG)               [5634] I though that [...]

                           [5660] Six of them in that pack what you got from

                           [5661] I got one of them and I had [...] and it's

Andy (PS0EG)               [5663] Ah yeah.
Andy (PS0EG)               [5664] and I spilt the entire contents of that over
                           my shirt ... one of my old shirts ... and it's the
                           only one I had to wear, I actually had to wear it,

                           [5665] It still does smell a bit cos I haven't
                           washed it since then and that was about three months

David (PS0EE)              [6224] and Claire said to me oh well Labour if
                           Labour get in we'll get, we'll get a, you know,
                           we'll be much better off, we'll get a much better
                           grant, er Jane goes but oh we'll get, we'll get
                           every erm, my mum and dad will get loads of other
                           things er dad, I won't be able to pay for it, I goes
                           well no because you probably get, you get the
                           housing benefit back
Scott (PS0EH)              [6225] You won't get better grants, you won't
                           though, cos it won't have time to work through
Helena (PS0EB)             [6226] No it might, it might
David (PS0EE)              [6227] But you will do
Helena (PS0EB)             [6228] be the year after
David (PS0EE)              [6229] Yeah
Scott (PS0EH)              [6230] Yeah, well for the last year
David (PS0EE)              [6231] but I think
Helena (PS0EB)             [6232] I think, I think actually, I think they will
                           try to do something actually because if they, if
                           they do away with the loans thing
Scott (PS0EH)              [6233] Yeah
Helena (PS0EB)             [6234] they'll have to try do something won't they?
Scott (PS0EH)              [6235] I know the way, I know, but
Helena (PS0EB)             [6236] To be honest
Scott (PS0EH)              [6237] you don't, it's not going to be you
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...]
Scott (PS0EH)              [6238] just because you vote for Labour
Helena (PS0EB)             [6239] oh no, no it's not no
David (PS0EE)              [6240] No I mean of course not
Scott (PS0EH)              [6241] and then they can't say alright, oh students
                           give them hundred pound a week, he give them none,
                           give them none
Helena (PS0EB)             [6242] no, they can't do that because of the state
                           of the economy
Scott (PS0EH)              [6243] and then if
David (PS0EE)              [6244] I know that, but
Scott (PS0EH)              [6245] You've got to be realistic like ain't you?
David (PS0EE)              [6246] but surely, but surely ... I mean surely
                           they'll be able to restore the housing benefit
Helena (PS0EB)             [6247] Well hopefully they'll be able to do
                           something
David (PS0EE)              [6248] Well it says in that, in that thing I've got
                           they're gonna restore a fair system of grants
Helena (PS0EB)             [6249] Yeah
David (PS0EE)              [6250] of grants, that's, that's the thing I looked
                           at, it didn't say a fair grant
Helena (PS0EB)             [6251] No
David (PS0EE)              [6252] it said grants
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6253] Yeah
David (PS0EE)              [6254] so ... I mean even if they don't bring in, oh
                           the housing benefit
Helena (PS0EB)             [6255] But I mean
David (PS0EE)              [6256] they'll bring in something a housing grant
Helena (PS0EB)             [6257] you know, I mean, on
Scott (PS0EH)              [6258] to, to my, to my mind, when
Helena (PS0EB)             [6259] on April the tenth they're not going to be
                           able to go
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6260] No when they hear it all day
Helena (PS0EB)             [6261] oh, you know, that's, that's it because for
                           thirteen years they have dismantled the social
                           system, that's what they've done in thirteen years,
                           so they can't say overnight, we'll put it all back
                           because there isn't, there, there isn't the finance
                           there because they've spent it all to have done what
                           they've done
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6262] Yeah
Helena (PS0EB)             [6263] because they've sold everything off like gas
                           and electricity and everything and all the resources
                           they've got for it they've spent, to supplement
                           everything else, so the money won't be there, and,
                           and the income from the electricity and that isn't
                           going to the Government it's going to private
                           enterprise
David (PS0EE)              [6264] Yeah
Helena (PS0EB)             [6265] so, so it's not gonna be there, and
                           unfortunately it's going to take a while, because
                           we're in such a deep recession and recession is bad,
                           and it's not getting any better
David (PS0EE)              [6266] Yeah it won't
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...]
David (PS0EE)              [6267] any more
Scott (PS0EH)              [6268] What
Helena (PS0EB)             [6269] It, it'll take a long time before it starts
                           to buck up.
Scott (PS0EH)              [6270] Why, why do they say, that for the election
                           it will take them three or four years to put,
                           whatever they promise into operation?
Helena (PS0EB)             [6271] Yeah, to put it right, to start to put it
                           right
David (PS0EE)              [6272] Well they're they're education promises are,
                           we'll do this within two years, we'll do this within

Scott (PS0EH)              [6273] Yeah
David (PS0EE)              [6274] three years
Helena (PS0EB)             [6275] yeah well I mean they'll want to and they've
                           got
Scott (PS0EH)              [6276] within three years you're leaving
Helena (PS0EB)             [6277] Yeah, but they've got
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6278] They've got to help people like me but I
                           don't know
Helena (PS0EB)             [6279] they've got to try and show
Scott (PS0EH)              [6280] what, you shouldn't think
Helena (PS0EB)             [6281] that they are doing something
David (PS0EE)              [6282] You should just you this is what I'm trying
                           to tell
Scott (PS0EH)              [6283] you shouldn't think what's it going to do to
                           me
David (PS0EE)              [6284] this is what I'm trying to tell everybody at
                           school, you shouldn't be thinking oh, how's it gonna
                           effect me, what I'll do if
Scott (PS0EH)              [6285] No
Helena (PS0EB)             [6286] No because you should help, think of a
                           society as whole
David (PS0EE)              [6287] because, that, this is, the , I said to this
                           kid the other day, he goes oh, like Ian was arguing
                           with them when I went in
Scott (PS0EH)              [6288] Yeah
David (PS0EE)              [6289] and he was going oh all what the Tories
                           haven't done for you, and he goes and what are
                           Labour gonna do for us?
                           [6290] I goes well they'll improve the grant to
                           start off with, he goes well it won't be in time to
                           benefit us, I goes well you shouldn't just be
                           thinking about yourself
Helena (PS0EB)             [6291] No
Scott (PS0EH)              [6292] No that's the trouble with people
Helena (PS0EB)             [6293] Yeah
David (PS0EE)              [6294] They're just, they're just bothered about,
                           about themselves
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6295] Everyone, everyone thinks of themselves, it's
                           like on their, all them people who are under that
                           certain amount, they're all gonna be going oh well
                           in here
Scott (PS0EH)              [6296] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6297] we'll vote for them, then
Scott (PS0EH)              [6298] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6299] and people do that don't they?
David (PS0EE)              [6300] Well it's like , it's like Richard today, he
                           goes well what, well what are Labour gonna do for
                           us?
                           [6301] So I goes well, they'll probably, they'll
                           probably erm ... er give better grants and restore
                           erm, er housing benefit of sorts, whatever happens
Helena (PS0EB)             [6302] Well is he going to university?
David (PS0EE)              [6303] Yeah
Helena (PS0EB)             [6304] What doing?
David (PS0EE)              [6305] Dunno [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...]
David (PS0EE)              [6306] or something, and, he goes
Helena (PS0EB)             [6307] But the only, I think the only course he'll
                           pass is mucking about course, let's see who can muck
                           about for the next three years the most.
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6308] I can't understand it, they've got to have a
                           decent grade to go to university, but they seem to
                           think that they can get in on D's and E's, if he
                           gets D's and E's, he's not going anywhere, except to
                           work
David (PS0EE)              [6309] No, I, I wouldn't I wouldn't expect it, I
                           reckon
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6310] because I mean, because
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...]
Scott (PS0EH)              [6311] come on
Helena (PS0EB)             [laugh]
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6312] He ain't, because to me you, you not got,
                           you're wasting your time
Helena (PS0EB)             [6313] Stupid innit?
                           [6314] If you haven't got, if you haven't got enough
                           discipline to get a good grade in your O levels
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6315] in school then you're not
Helena (PS0EB)             [6316] then you no way gonna have enough discipline
                           to get any sort of grade at university
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6317] because you live in
Scott (PS0EH)              [6318] That's for the testing innit?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6319] Yeah, because, I mean you're living at home
                           when your doing A levels, you, you haven't even got
Helena (PS0EB)             [6320] And you got
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6321] the discipline of your parents to say get up
                           there and do something have you?
Scott (PS0EH)              [6322] No
David (PS0EE)              [6323] But some people don't, Adeleine got that, his
                           parents don't tell him to get on with it, half, half
                           the people at school they got that ...
Sheila (PS0ED)             [6324] Well if I didn't, I mean I don't think, you
                           do enough either of you do enough, but in, you know
                           I mean

                           she's already, she's always been really nice to me,
                           but ... like them people she goes around, well she

Helena (PS0EB)             [6928] she's alright actually, sometimes she just

                           know
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [6932] Maybe she needs to grow up a bit more
Helena (PS0EB)             [6933] Yeah probably ... I think she'll always be
                           like it though, cos her mum's just the same, she's
                           just like her mum, you know ... her mum got in a

Helena (PS0EB)             [7073] Yeah, where was Christ Hospital then?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7074] Christ Hospital was on Lindon Hill ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7075] Where?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7076] Christ Hospital was

                           art college? ...
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7078] Yeah, you know, half way up Lindon Hill
                           there's three stone steps
Helena (PS0EB)             [7079] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7080] and you went up there and there's them
                           building sort of on the top isn't there
Helena (PS0EB)             [7081] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7082] that piece, and so you start go up this
                           building across, and it's like it's, it's the school
                           there
Helena (PS0EB)             [7083] Right
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7084] and that's Christ Hospital, or was
Helena (PS0EB)             [7085] Or was
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7086] and that was the girls grammar school and
                           then there was the City school where your dad went
                           and there was the Lincoln school
Helena (PS0EB)             [7087] Was that co-ed?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7088] that come out at Bram , Brambury Road, what?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7089] Was it boys and girls?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7090] No, no, there was the girls school and there
                           was the two boys school
Helena (PS0EB)             [7091] That's a bit unfair ...
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7092] There wasn't another grammar, there wasn't
                           another girls grammar school, oh what was Spring
                           Hill?
                           [7093] ... Oh great, I don't know, Spring Hill was
                           something
Helena (PS0EB)             [7094] Girls?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7095] Yeah, it was a, yeah Spring Hill was a
                           grammar school, it was a girls grammar school
Helena (PS0EB)             [7096] Oh ...
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7097] Yeah because erm, poor thingy, the girl I
                           went to school with she went on to Spring Hill when
                           she was fifteen, see you could go on to grammar
                           school when you were fifteen then as well as going
                           at eleven
Helena (PS0EB)             [7098] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7099] if you passed, if you failed the eleven plus
                           and if you were clever enough, you could take an
                           exam, like an entry exam to go, it's sort of if you
                           improve from eleven to fifteen you could take an
                           entry exam to go into grammar school then, so that
                           you could take your G C E's ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7100] Like erm, but, like Miss says some of the
                           stuff on it was so rubbish, I mean like, there was
                           somebody she knew, who their son failed the eleven
                           plus twice and now they've got their P H D
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7101] Yeah, mm
Helena (PS0EB)             [7102] they failed, but they failed their eleven
                           plus twice
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7103] Mm
Helena (PS0EB)             [7104] but now they've got their P H D
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7105] Mm, mm
Helena (PS0EB)             [7106] you know, it's so stupid innit? ...
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7107] It's too young an age which to, erm
Helena (PS0EB)             [7108] Assess like that
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7109] judge , judge people and, and, and, split
                           them like that
Helena (PS0EB)             [7110] Mm
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7111] Too young.
Helena (PS0EB)             [7112] I mean it might be alright for the more
                           intelligent people or whatever, cos they get the
                           best teachers then don't they?
                           [7113] But I mean for the other people it's just,
                           it's just rejection innit, you're not good enough
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7114] Well I'm not stupid , I mean I wasn't stu ,
                           when I was at the junior schools in the country I
                           wasn't stupid
Helena (PS0EB)             [7115] No
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7116] but I went from there straight to there
                           taking me eleven plus
Helena (PS0EB)             [7117] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7118] I never had any practice at anything or, and
                           I should imagine they did, I don't know, I don't
                           know how it worked
Helena (PS0EB)             [7119] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7120] but I never had anything, I just went from
                           one to the another, and I had to take it in the hall
                           one day ... and I wasn't, I was never very good at
                           maths anyway, not that kind of maths.
Helena (PS0EB)             [7121] Not algebra ... oh we had this, we
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7122] I could never remember how to do them, I mean
                           if somebody, if someone sat with me and explained it
                           to me and then I, and then I could do it, I would do

Helena (PS0EB)             [7123] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7124] it then for that lesson, but after that I
                           couldn't remember again how to do it
Helena (PS0EB)             [7125] That's, that's just like me that is, if I get
                           into a rhythm and someone gives er, I can do it
                           then, but if I just sit on a page, I think oh how do
                           you do that?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7126] Mm, I can never remember the formulas, like
                           your dad said formula for such and such a thing is
                           so and so and that, but I could never remember them
                           ... so I was no good then, because I couldn't
                           remember it ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7127] Mm, them nice
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7128] and then there was St Joseph's which was
                           private
Helena (PS0EB)             [7129] Mm ... mm there was only one in Redditch

Sheila (PS0ED)             [7146] I was good at English ... history, sport
Helena (PS0EB)             [7147] You ought to try taking some of them,
                           honestly they're so easy the exams are, like
                           history, ah, talk about easy, spartan erm, you could
                           G C S E, P E mum

                           done then probably
Helena (PS0EB)             [7149] You remind me of bit, eh, you're like a bit
                           what Joanne's like, except Joanne's better at maths
                           but she's not very good at English, like when they
                           were doing Animal Farm, I had to explain that it was
                           a parody of the Russian revolution and everything
                           and she just sat there with her mouth open.
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7150] What did she go to see the other day that she
                           reckon was a load of rubbish?

                           most aggravating little gits there, because as soon
                           as they found out, they all started messing about
                           then, for three hours it was on, could you imagine
                           sitting in there with them lot for three hours?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7161] What about the teachers?

                           than it actually is ... dad said to me once that if

Helena (PS0EB)             [7180] What?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7181] that's what I don't like about it
Helena (PS0EB)             [7182] It's not, it's no bigger than our school
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7183] Isn't it?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7184] No
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7185] It's not got the same discipline ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7186] It's about the sa , well it's might, just a
                           little bit bigger than our school, about another
                           hundred or something, but that's, that's a drop in
                           the ocean when you've got seven hundred there ...
                           that's like one in each class or something you know,
                           extra
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7187] Still there's no discipline ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7188] No discipline ah, no discipline
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...] ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7189] and er, we were like, we was on about, you
                           know like we were talking about the education system
                           and everything in English and you know I told you
                           they were on about people changing at eleven and
                           everyone else in the class wanted the thirteen
                           system except me, it's only cos what they're used to
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7190] Oh yes what they're used to, what they
                           always, yeah, I know
Helena (PS0EB)             [7191] but I mean, but like I said, I said, I mean,
                           I went, I went to the ... like I changed then, I
                           mean to be quite honest I didn't like it, I didn't
                           like it
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7192] What the same people in school?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7193] no I didn't , I never liked it, whether that
                           was because I knew we weren't gonna be there, or,
                           you know, I just, I was only there six months
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7194] Mm ... you would of done eventually, you
                           would of got in alright, once you were settled and
                           that
Helena (PS0EB)             [7195] I, you know, I just ... I would of been
                           alright if it was a bit more organised I don't
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7196] I think
Helena (PS0EB)             [7197] know it never seemed quite very organised
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7198] they sent it back, I think, I thought the
                           twelve was, was quite good actually, I thought the
                           twelve when they went up at twelve, but then when
                           they changed it back to the junior and infants it
                           was the elev , the eleven and it was a bit, I think
                           it, you know eleven might be perhaps too young, I
                           think twelve is a reasonable
Helena (PS0EB)             [7199] Mm
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7200] age.
Helena (PS0EB)             [7201] But you see I was thrown from one teacher all
                           the time Miss all the time
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7202] Yeah to that
Helena (PS0EB)             [7203] to, to German , French, Latin
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7204] Yeah
Helena (PS0EB)             [7205] er, you know proper algebra and all that kind
                           of stuff and it, and it was, I think I would of been
                           better if I had of gone to Our Ladies cos I don't
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7206] Well I don't know I mean it would of still
                           been the same if you'd of gone to Our Ladies, it
                           would of still been one, one
Helena (PS0EB)             [7207] One teacher
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7208] Yeah
Helena (PS0EB)             [7209] was there?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7210] Yeah I think so
Helena (PS0EB)             [7211] I know, but
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7212] yeah because they were the only one who would
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...]
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7213] didn't we?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7214] I know, but that, at St. Hughes you're stuck
                           in a little rut aren't you?
                           [7215] I mean
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7216] Well, the trouble is you got to be the eldest
                           and you were the eldest for such a long time
Helena (PS0EB)             [7217] You mean we were the eldest for five years
                           there
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7218] Yeah because you go to be the eldest and then
                           just at the time you should of gone on and become
                           the youngest, it changed so you were the eldest all
                           the time
Helena (PS0EB)             [7219] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7220] and that made the difference I think, that
                           probably made the difference
Helena (PS0EB)             [7221] That particularly didn't bother me it was the
                           regime, the sudden change in the regime
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7222] Yeah
Helena (PS0EB)             [7223] you know ... I think I would of got used to
                           it
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7224] Oh I
Helena (PS0EB)             [7225] but you know.
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7226] I feel surprised that I put, how thick was
                           she?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7227] What?

Sheila (PS0ED)             [7231] supposedly cleverness
Helena (PS0EB)             [7232] Supposedly, when I, when I told Nicola the
                           other day that you reckon that I don't do enough
                           work, she says cor blimey ... she was shocked she
                           was, shocked ... oh do it, do it as near to the
                           microphone as you can mum

Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...] ...
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7234] I don't think er, I don't think you do do
                           work, enough work, either of you really ... I mean
                           if I sat an eleven plus today, by what, if they ever
                           brought it back, it'll be a lot different than what
                           it was then
Helena (PS0EB)             [7235] I
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7236] it'd be easy wouldn't it? ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7237] It wouldn't of been easier
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7238] Well it would, it would of, it'd be easier, I
                           think it would
Helena (PS0EB)             [7239] Not to everybody it wouldn't
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7240] Well I think, I think, I think to be honest
                           they've all got easier ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7241] I'd say they'd got harder, you should see
                           some of the things we do in maths mum, it's not easy
Unknown speaker (KCEPSUNK) [...]
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7242] No I know that , that's it's not easier now,
                           you know, but I think er that would be easier
                           wouldn't it?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7243] You know, I mean ... you, the problem with
                           you and dad is, cos you never got particularly
                           involved with it you don't, you don't know exactly
                           what's happening at school, you don't know what we
                           do.
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7244] Well I've never got particularly involved
                           with this school, I got involved with the other
                           schools
Helena (PS0EB)             [7245] I know, but, mum that, that was, that was
                           five years ago, I mean I've moved on a great deal
                           since then
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7246] Oh yeah, I know it's not, no I know it's not
                           easy, I don't try to make out it's easy
Helena (PS0EB)             [7247] I mean some, some of them are what, what I
                           would deem as fairly easy, I mean I find history
                           easy, but not everyone does
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7248] Oh no, I know that, I know that I mean some
                           people find some things easy, some people find some
                           things hard, don't they?
                           [7249] But I mean that's er, a fact of life ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7250] You know, but I mean, there's no way easy,
                           especially the science and maths ... equals I times

Helena (PS0EB)             [7309] which they all do in my class, cos they're
                           all thick ... I couldn't believe it right
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7310] Well they're all supposedly got intelligent
                           parents by the sou , by the sound of things
Helena (PS0EB)             [7311] Oh not all of them, I was sat, I, I was sat
                           there
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7312] All thick like me
Helena (PS0EB)             [7313] and I went who's applying to go on to
                           university or education after eighteen, so I put up
                           my hand, turned round and flipping Stuart and Danny
                           had put their hands up and I just went oh god,
                           they're gonna do really well ... and Terry, and
                           Terry, we're talking Terry, Terry who hasn't got a
                           brain cell to rub together
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7314] What, er, mm, he's in your class ain't he?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7315] so ... ah that boy, this is the one who said
                           I think we should be allowed to hit girls
Sheila (PS0ED)             [laugh]
Helena (PS0EB)             [7316] he supposedly, he, two short planks does not
                           describe this boy, even Miss hates him ... that was
                           it, she, we were having this discussion right in
                           education, she goes, are you cynical about education
                           Terry, he goes, no, he goes, oh she goes why?
                           [7317] He goes I don't know what cynical means
Sheila (PS0ED)             [laugh]
Helena (PS0EB)             [7318] I said, ah no and everyone in the class just
                           cracked up ... sometimes you wonder, you wonder
                           whether he does it on purpose ... he must do it on
                           purpose, no one can be that thick
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7319] How many was thinking of going on?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7320] Ninety five per cent
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7321] Yeah, oh ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7322] but erm like Vicky who's got, in her English
                           folder, this is Vicky Vicky, she's got in her
                           literature she's got nine A's and one B and in her
                           other I don't know what she's got, ten A's probably,
                           mm she's not going to, she wants to be a nurse
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7323] Oh does she?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7324] and er, like she said aren't you Vicky and
                           she goes no miss, mm, you can't be a nurse till your
                           eighteen
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7325] No, no you can't go into student, student
Helena (PS0EB)             [7326] so like, you know, she's gonna stay on, do A
                           levels and then go into it
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7327] Mm
Helena (PS0EB)             [7328] because she might as well have some A levels
                           just in case or whatever, but erm ... you know I,
                           you know she's, you know, I can understand that
                           actually, she's being quiet sensible about it she
                           said there's nothing else I want to do and I might
                           as well do something that I enjoy, you know, you've
                           only got one life haven't you when it comes down to
                           it?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7329] Well if that's what she wants to do, that's
                           what she wants to do, innit?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7330] Mm, like, her dad says to her why don't you
                           be a doctor ... and she, but she don't want to, you
                           know, she wants to be in a hospital and that, she
                           don't want to end up in general practice
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7331] Well she doesn't necessarily end up in
                           general practice does she?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7332] No, but ...
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7333] But I mean for the first year she won't be
                           in, if she goes into student, she'll be in college
Helena (PS0EB)             [7334] I know, but it won't take as long for her to
                           get there as it would if she becomes a doctor
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7335] Oh no, three years ain't it a student?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7336] Mm
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7337] But then you get on hand experience right ...
                           hands on I should say, not on hand ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7338] but erm
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7339] learning how to clean pot pa , er bed pans
                           and make beds and things like that
Helena (PS0EB)             [7340] Clear up sick, that's a favourite job isn't
                           it?
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7341] Mm ...
Helena (PS0EB)             [7342] Yeah, I thought of being that once but ... I
                           wouldn't mind it in the wards, but I wouldn't want
                           to be in the operating theatre, I don't know why,
                           the blood don't put me off or anything, but
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7343] You do have to go into the theatre for so
                           long I think
Helena (PS0EB)             [7344] Mm
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7345] but then you can, you can specialize you see,
                           I mean some nurses go into the theatre all the time
                           once they've qualified
Helena (PS0EB)             [7346] Yeah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7347] I think they do have to go in, you have to go
                           into each area
Helena (PS0EB)             [7348] But like, I mean I don't mind the blood or
                           whatever, and if they were doing little things, I
                           could handle it, but like, like on that op ,
                           operation that woman was having the other day and
                           they cut her open and they just pulled
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7349] Well they do
Helena (PS0EB)             [7350] and that, that, that's the thing that makes
                           me retch, not the cutting, it's when they just pull
                           it apart
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7351] Well I know
Helena (PS0EB)             [7352] when it rips ooh, they could of cut it
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7353] Well they do cut it
Helena (PS0EB)             [7354] No they cut the skin and then they just
                           pulled it apart
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7355] Yes because it's not the like that
                           underneath, if they didn't pull it apart they, they
                           cut down, if they cut down with a knife they could
                           cut into something couldn't they?
Helena (PS0EB)             [7356] Oh, er
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7357] It could be dangerous so you, you open up the
                           top and then the other parts ... the lining
Helena (PS0EB)             [7358] Ah
Sheila (PS0ED)             [laugh]
Helena (PS0EB)             [7359] Yeah but what they ripped was all fat, all
                           her fat, ooh
Sheila (PS0ED)             [7360] Yeah, but you see, you've got the, you got
                           all the other things in, down, down, underneath,
                           well I mean if you started going in with a knife and
                           you started cutting them I mean you could cut an
                           artery or anything couldn't you?
                           [7361] Which could be a bit nasty, you know ...
                           [singing] and then she'd say buy a little bag for
                           me, a chick, a chick, a chick, a chickita []
