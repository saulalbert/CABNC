*JAN:	mm •473015_473075•
*CHR:	that was her choice really  •473075_474405•

*CHR:	that's the one Mike's mad on, and when I went in on, er •602300_606710•
*JAN:	that particular colour or a different colour? •606710_608540•
*CHR:	yeah it looks lovely in the square, yeah because I thought it was quite light, but it isn't actually •608540_614060•
*JAN:	It's the pinky one int it there  •614070_616040•
*CHR:	it's erm, you shut up, no I went in, I've never been in Weeks, to go in and have a look and everything, it was Hamish that was in that time and you can have a right laugh with him, he's the one that came and sorted the hall and stairs  •616040_630490•
*JAN:	Oh  •630490_630590•
*CHR:	out for me and erm, when he went in on Monday, erm it was the other one the lad that actually owns it, so I was in there for about bloody half an hour and we came home with some samples and one that I quite liked it was up on the wall and he said that is my best selling Axminster that I had, and it was like, it was maybe it was a bit too busy, it was, it was greyey and it was all different other colours in it, but it was a lot of flowers on it, it wasn't a traditional Axminster you see Mike loves these traditional Axminsters and he doesn't really, he won't really entertain anything else, erm, anyway I brought that sample home  and what else? •630590_669110•
        Oh yeah that's the only one I brought home, on Tuesday it was, well as soon as he saw, I brought it in and me dad looked at it and he goes yeah it's alright, I knew he didn't like it and then when Mike got in, he said oh I don't like that, so I said why? •670510_681520•
        Well you take it back I said and you pick the carpet •681570_683860•
*JAN:	Mm where's this for then? •683920_685350•
*CHR:	so, this is the front room •685460_686690•
*JAN:	The front room •686770_687220•
*CHR:	so er, he goes off and he comes back with three samples then, well one of them, it has been in the window as well, but it's a very definite diamondy shape •687980_696480•
*JAN:	More •696640_697320•
*CHR:	no quite big shaped diamond but it's in like pastel pink and pastel blue and it's very, very pastely colours  •697320_706960•
*JAN:	Can't remember those  •707340_710280•
*CHR:	but I would imagine down on a floor it would look very, the diamonds would be too much if you  •710280_715920•
*JAN:	hit ya mm •715920_716150•
*CHR:	know what I mean, he brought that one home and he brought another quite nice traditional one, but it tended to be quite browny, and then another one and, er •716150_725660•
*JAN:	You're not ripping that up? •726110_728750•
*CHR:	and then you know the one that was in the window? •728750_730940•
*JAN:	Yeah •730940_731030•
*CHR:	He didn't bring a sample home of that cos he, he brought the same design but in a different colour, but it was more greeny •731030_738610•
*JAN:	mm •738650_738950•
*CHR:	so, anyway, I just, we've got it down on the floor and I says if we had a brown suite •738950_745360•
*JAN:	mm •745360_745750•
*CHR:	that would be ideal •745830_746860•
*JAN:	yeah •746860_746980•
*CHR:	even though there was a bit of grey in it, it was the, really the brown that predominated it, I said it, it, the grey suite wouldn't go with it •748160_754390•
*JAN:	so you're gonna have the front room with your grey suite in it? •754390_757710•
*CHR:	yeah  •757710_757770•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	then shall I •757770_758250•

*CHR:	and it's the and, yeah, me and Joanne weren't very keen on any of the carpets either and as soon as she saw that she said oh that's lovely •773150_778860•
*JAN:	mm •778870_778880•
*CHR:	she said now I do like that, cos it looks nice and warm cos there's loads of colours in it, there's pink, there's burgundy, there's blue, green, every colour you can think of, you've  •779080_792040•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	oh, you're determined to have that you are, aren't ya? •792410_796200•
        If he got a •796210_796930•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	wouldn't do him any harm, but it wouldn't half make him go ah, cos it's dead minty •796930_801170•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	what are ya? •801220_802170•
        What are ya? •807730_809950•
        Leave my handbag alone  but you see when it was in the window Jane I thought it looked a bit too light, but I think what makes it look like that is they've got the light shining  •809950_823100•
*JAN:	Yeah  •823100_823410•
*CHR:	right on it •823410_824380•
*JAN:	I've seen it down Chris and I love it •824380_826450•
*CHR:	when you actually see it on the floor, it looks totally different •826540_829490•
*JAN:	Glenys has got it, very, very very, very similar, there's very, there's not a lot in it, I'll take those magazines off •829560_837200•
*CHR:	you see, oh Christ, erm  •837420_838530•
*JAN:	but she got it in the greens •839580_843220•
*CHR:	yeah, well I, Mike says I brought that one home when we were looking for a hall instead, but I said no I said it was one very similar, but he said we couldn't have it because erm  •843220_854640•
*JAN:	no  •854640_855180•
*CHR:	with them being the squares you'd lose a hell of a lot coming down the stairs  •855180_859110•
*JAN:	mm  •859110_859280•
*CHR:	you know on the turn and everything  •859280_860460•
*JAN:	it would spoil it I mean •860460_861890•

*JAN:	yeah, yeah I mean I'd thought about it for ours  •864490_866080•

*CHR:	no  •900770_901130•
*JAN:	you know •901130_901450•

*JAN:	Mike said   •936440_936670•
*CHR:	but you see the fortunate thing about it Jane, with that one, most of the carpets are only twelve foot wide •936700_942080•
*JAN:	mm •942200_942310•
*CHR:	which would mean, cos the room's thirteen foot wide •942440_945690•

*CHR:	we would of had to •946530_947490•
*JAN:	Have another piece •947490_948290•
*CHR:	buy an extra five square yards •948920_950730•
*JAN:	yeah •950800_951050•
*CHR:	cos it was only twelve foot wide, anyway, they do that one in fifteen foot wide •951220_956030•
*JAN:	Oh do they? •956150_956650•
*CHR:	so it, we've got to have twenty one something square yards, I think he worked it out at •956730_961390•
*JAN:	Is it thirteen foot wide then the room? •961390_964080•

*JAN:	no  •966860_966930•
*CHR:	room's only about eleven and a half, because you get the back room, the front room and then it goes in a bit •967000_973080•
*JAN:	right •973080_973300•
*CHR:	to the back room •973590_974270•

*CHR:	where it's •976400_977740•
*JAN:	So what's the length of the front room? •977740_978880•
*CHR:	Er fourteen ten, by •978880_981130•
*JAN:	It's bigger than what it looks really  •982210_983720•
*CHR:	though it's bigger than what you think really •983720_984880•
*JAN:	I think it's deceiving because it's got such high ceilings •985020_987530•
*CHR:	yeah •987530_987890•
*JAN:	the high ceilings sort of seems to take it off with  •987950_991820•
*CHR:	yeah  •991820_991940•
*JAN:	I know it sounds silly, but perhaps if the ceilings was lower it would look big •992100_995060•
*CHR:	yeah, yeah •995060_995300•
*JAN:	higher that •995300_996350•
*CHR:	I think it's just maybe er how you have it as well  •996560_999410•
*JAN:	mm  •100007_100036•
*CHR:	I mean if you look at it now without the dining table  •100036_100254•
*JAN:	yeah  •100254_100308•
*CHR:	it looks totally different •100316_100414•

*CHR:	I mean, Mike really likes that as a front room, he keeps saying that's gonna be our room, you know •100475_100998•
*JAN:	mm I like a front room  •100998_101111•
*CHR:	he's, he's funny he does like a front room, so I thought well sod it, I hate picking carpets Jane, so I thought sod it he can pick  •101111_101769•
*JAN:	yeah  •101769_101783•
*CHR:	the carpet and if it's not right he can •101825_102052•

*JAN:	I don't think you can go wrong, far wrong with that one •102077_102211•
*CHR:	No, it is nice •102296_102338•
*JAN:	thinking of pink and grey in there •102338_102488•
*CHR:	yeah, and he wants to, he came home this morning and he said, he must of been thinking about it, and he said well we could emulsion the walls, he said erm, why don't we do an apricot white, I says well that's peach, I said the  •102551_103798•
*JAN:	Yeah  •103798_103814•
*CHR:	the carpet's pink •103836_103891•
*JAN:	yeah and, the suite •103891_104037•
*CHR:	it wouldn't, it wouldn't look right, I mean we have got apricot white on the walls in the back room now, but I said, he, I think he feels as though, a definite pink is not the right colour for a room, do you know what I mean? •104037_105468•
*JAN:	Mm •105468_105472•
*CHR:	And yet it, I was quite happy with it to be honest  •105472_105731•
*JAN:	yeah  •105731_105737•
*CHR:	Jane because I think it looks quite warm •105737_105893•
*JAN:	yeah, you can only put another colour into your curtains and bring it out with your carpet  •105893_106273•
*CHR:	Yeah, well what I think he, I think he will emulsion over it cos I mean the ceiling's a bit, as you say she'd been a smoker •106273_107146•
*JAN:	mm •107146_107162•
*CHR:	and the ceiling in that front room is a very deep, deep pink I think, if I can remember rightly, I think we'll go over, we'll probably will go over it and  •107162_108062•
*JAN:	yeah  •108062_108069•
*CHR:	erm we're not gonna go mad knocking picture frames down in that room, it's too much of a big job •108069_108555•
*JAN:	Yes it is, innit? •108555_108655•
*CHR:	I'm just gonna put a border round it •108655_108823•
*JAN:	Mm •108823_108851•
*CHR:	seen like a border in perhaps like a bit of pink and bit of grey on it and it's like sort of scalloped edging •108851_109484•
*JAN:	Mm that'll look nice  •109575_109778•
*CHR:	so put that over •109778_109832•
*JAN:	yeah •109839_109848•
*CHR:	at the top of the erm •109848_109923•

*CHR:	of the picture frame •109978_110036•
*JAN:	yeah •110083_110134•
*CHR:	it sort of brings the ceiling down a little bit as well  •110134_110367•
*JAN:	yeah  •110493_110507•
*CHR:	cos to be honest, the more Mike goes over there, the more he keeps saying he doesn't really want to pull the picture frames down  •110507_111198•
*JAN:	no well with them being such a tall ceilings, they're probably  •111198_111475•
*CHR:	I don't know why, yeah and I think he feels as though you, he says well if you decorate it right you can blend it in with the wallpaper  •111476_112142•
*JAN:	mm  •112146_112156•
*CHR:	anyway you know, so  •112156_112316•

*CHR:	Same colour as the walls •112650_112794•

*JAN:	yeah, it'll look nice •113086_113201•
*CHR:	and then it'll just, it'll just be titivated up really, so we can live in it and then the back room can just be done at our own time. •113201_113950•
