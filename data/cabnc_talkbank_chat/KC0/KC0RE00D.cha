*PS092:	Ooh yes Yeah .  169015_170375
*PS093:	Yes the whole scene has altered And er as I say observing this and watching Hector 's work and how things have gone on over the years er as you know there 's been a tremendous revival of interest in driving so many people have er restored carts or had new ones built and erm the young farriers who 've never had the experience with driving horses they have run into problems with erm keeping them going soundly and overcoming problems which crop up when horses are driven on the road a lot .  170925_203285
*PS092:	Yeah .  203285_203375
*PS08Y:	Mm .  203375_203535

*PS092:	Well yeah that is I 'm I mean that 's a completely different er er laxing of the it 's completely different Er when you 're riding a horse you see the weight is all on the back er whichever tendency do and what we call the gait er .  205225_223205
*PS08Y:	Yes .  224025_224595
*PS092:	is the hind legs in the front .  224675_226115
*PS08Y:	Yes .  226375_226785
*PS092:	they have a tendency to open them make them wider apart .  226785_229775
*PS08Y:	Oh yes .  229775_229895
*PS092:	by the backs .  229895_230625
*PS08Y:	G A I T .  230625_231415
*PS093:	That 's right that kind of gait .  231415_232455
*PS092:	By the back and swop them you see Well er with a driving horse that 's completely opposite because yo your vehicle behind the horse is pushing against it .  232455_243475
*PS08Y:	Yes .  243755_243955
*PS092:	and have a tendency to punt the back .  244045_246785
*PS08Y:	Really .  247325_247575
*PS092:	so that pushes the legs fo closer together do you see .  247575_250905
*PS08Y:	Good heavens .  251045_251605
*PS093:	They 're more likely to .  251605_252065
*PS092:	And then they 're more likely to hit they 're more likely to hit .  252095_254545
*PS093:	Mm .  254545_254605
*PS092:	the front legs with the back legs .  254685_256995
*PS08Y:	Really .  256995_257125
*PS092:	when they 're going especially going down hill .  257615_259245

*PS092:	Yeah Forging .  262005_262295
*PS08Y:	What is it .  262295_262605
*PS093:	It 's what now there 's a .  263015_263935
*PS08Y:	Forging .  263935_264305
*PS093:	completely .  264305_264765
*PS092:	Yeah .  264765_264875
*PS093:	different use for the word forging .  264875_267075
*PS08Y:	Now is it related to forging ahead in any way Oh do is that where forging ahead comes .  267195_272255
*PS093:	I .  272585_272615
*PS08Y:	from When you 're really pushing .  272615_274055
*PS092:	Yeah yeah pushing .  274055_274345

*PS08Y:	Yes .  276385_276475
*PS093:	well be I would say the term .  276475_278295
*PS092:	And and then they can .  278295_278795
*PS093:	forging ahead has come from the use of that word in relation to horses .  278795_284005
*PS08Y:	Yes .  284005_284135
*PS092:	Yes .  284135_284395
*PS093:	I would say because that .  284395_285305
*PS092:	Yeah probably .  285305_285725
*PS093:	dates back many many years does n't .  285725_287335
*PS092:	Yeah .  287335_287395
*PS093:	it .  287395_287495
*PS092:	Yeah .  287685_287965
*PS093:	Yes Because they .  288005_289305
*PS092:	That 's it .  289305_289535
*PS093:	do do it when they 're pushing ahead .  289535_290665
*PS092:	Yeah .  290665_290815
*PS093:	they they hit the front foot with the hind one .  290815_293135
*PS08Y:	Good Lord .  293135_293435
*PS093:	Occasionally you .  293435_294075
*PS092:	Yeah .  294075_294135
*PS093:	hear them do it .  294135_294895
*PS08Y:	Oh .  295325_295605

*PS092:	Yeah yeah yeah yeah .  297305_297785
*PS093:	crack you .  297785_297995

*PS08Y:	Mm .  305025_305335
*PS092:	Completely different .  305435_306275
*PS093:	If they do it too much then the farrier 's not doing a good job .  306275_309585
*PS092:	Job .  309585_309885
*PS093:	and his job .  310055_310885
*PS08Y:	Really .  310885_311035
*PS093:	is to re-balance the shoe so that er it just misses .  311035_315375
*PS092:	Miss .  315475_315755
*PS093:	the front foot as it comes forward If the .  315755_318445
*PS08Y:	Right .  318445_318595
*PS093:	if the horse is travelling fast on the road he 's at the trot I mean it is n't .  318595_323085
*PS08Y:	Yes .  323095_323105
*PS093:	the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road they never ever should .  323105_326885
*PS08Y:	No .  326885_327245
*PS093:	Erm but at the trot when th the the legs are moving the diagonals are moving so of course the front and the hind foot come very close together .  327345_335625
*PS08Y:	Ah that 's it .  335795_336585
*PS093:	at one point in the gait .  336585_337555
*PS092:	Yeah .  337555_337745
*PS093:	and if the .  337745_338545
*PS08Y:	Yes .  338565_338645
*PS093:	shoe is slightly wrongly balanced or the foot is slightly wrongly trimmed then you get these troubles you .  338645_345365
*PS092:	Yeah .  345365_345435
*PS093:	also get what we call brushing do n't you .  345435_347245
*PS092:	Brushing When they .  347245_347665
*PS093:	Tell Edith about that .  347665_348835
*PS092:	when they hit both legs together like the hind legs when they they 'll hit each other they 'll hit one hind leg .  348835_355785
*PS093:	They really they .  355785_356185
*PS092:	with other one you see .  356185_356825
*PS093:	They really .  356825_357035
*PS08Y:	Ooh .  357085_357385

*PS092:	Yeah .  364545_365045
*PS093:	which is of course the little junction between the skin and the hair .  365045_368955
*PS092:	Yeah .  368955_369195
*PS08Y:	Ooh .  369195_369515

*PS093:	tissue grows from And they do .  373925_375595
*PS092:	And on the front .  375595_376095
*PS093:	damage their coronet .  376095_377045
