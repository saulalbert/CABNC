*GIN:	Yes , yes, and all the rest of it .
*NON:	and all the rest of it .Oh my god.
*GIN:	My husband's eh, never bought the Christmas presents, he buys one and usually he'd only get that from one of the girls, what shall I get mum can you do   (        ) .
*NON:	So he doesn't actually go out and do
*GIN:	He doesn't have to do anything, but about four Christmas's ago I had the whole lot down, I had nine of us for the whole Christmas week, erm, Boxing Day I went in the kitchen, two of Diane's friends had arrived, who lived in London and I went in the kitchen, I'd had a bad dose of the flu virus that was 
*NON:	Oh ,
*GIN:	going around and I'd worked right through it because of all the Christmas preparation
*NON:	we don't have another option do you?
*GIN:	and I went into the kitchen and I fell down, first time in my life, I've never passed out, not 
*NON:	That's right ,
*GIN:	even in pregnancies or anything
*NON:	mm.
*GIN:	next thing I remember was being undressed and in bed with Debbie standing there with a boiled egg on a tray, saying mummy were so sorry you'll never do Christmas again, you've done it for us for forty years, we shall do it for you now.
*NON:	Oh, bless her cotton socks.

*GIN:	Yeah , what would you like me to do?
*NON:	Yes.
*GIN:	If, I say, if you want me out of the kitchen just say so, I don't want to be under your feet .
*NON:	But if   (        ) absolutely you won't go quietly , but
*GIN:	And they either say go and read the paper mum, I'll call you in half an hour.
*NON:	Yes, and then you'll feel you don't want to be   (        ) , yes absolutely, I know.
*GIN:	And we get on fine .
*NON:	It takes you a long while to realise what a twit you've been for so long.
*GIN:	Yes.Oh bless their hearts, they'd always helped, but they hadn't realised I think .
*NON:	Yes but until you are the one who does it you have no comprehension of what is involved.
*GIN:	Yes, yes, Diane was the first 
*NON:	This year I have my mummy and my daddy coming up for a couple of days and that will be fine
*GIN:	Yeah.

*GIN:	I think you're much better off.
*NON:	for the first time since he went

*GIN:	He's got nothing left , he's got nothing left. (        ) .
*NON:	 (        ) , he's probably widdleing nothing, poor   (        ) that wasn't worth sitting down for, no to think that once I've gone on, which I did on Friday, I'm now on my way out the other end
*GIN:	 [whispering]  (        )  [] .
*NON:	it's absolute bliss.
*GIN:	 [whispering]  (        )  [] .
*NON:	Yes, I think I do.
*GIN:	Oh    [whispering]  (        )  [] .
*NON:	I was talking to my girls    (        )  (        ) honestly say, it never crosses my mind 
*GIN:	On my own with, with 
*NON:	to think I wish he'd come back I get back to how life was cos I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole .
*GIN:	 (        ) .No, no .

*GIN:	Don't throw it too far otherwise .
*NON:	The longer you throw, the more , good boy, it's so well hidden in the leaves, it's exactly the same colour that's the trouble this time of year, but no, life is a funny thing, and I find it personally very hard to believe that only two months ago, I mean what is it nine weeks ago, and I suddenly had an enormous   (        ) view
*GIN:	Yes,
*NON:	and yet here you are ,
*GIN:	It knocks you on your heels doesn't it?.

*GIN:	Yes.
*NON:	You find out who your friends are.
*GIN:	Yes.

*GIN:	Well both my daughters are married to 
*NON:	That's what I'm going to do ,

*GIN:	Yes.
*NON:	on Thursday, we go on a book buying expedition, every year, June and me, we choose a lot of books of  (        ) , but it's a lot more fun to go and actually pick the things off the shelve 
*GIN:	Oh lovely .
*NON:	and there's a library supplier, advertised to a box shop up in Lytham Saint Anne's
*GIN:	So it's all paid for.
*NON:	oh yes, (        ) shuttle
*GIN:	Ah?
*NON:	oh you'll love it, on the shuttle with the   (        ) representative of Midlands, the firm get's us the other end and drives up to, we spend all day hacking around   (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) on the shelves there .I didn't know they had a big library.
*NON:	Oh, yes, it's a three million books, it's called Help Jackson, it's one of the very, very old   (        ) and that, I literally 
*GIN:	Oh so, the public is nothing  ((laugh)) .
*NON:	 (        ) three million books on the shelve, and we don't have time going properly at the price so we go  anything you want, bung it on the trolley and soon as the trolleys full it's taken away and another one given, and you poke around and then in the evening, you stay in a hotel overnight, and then the following morning, they get   (        ) and you just   (        ) sort of send up the money   (        ) and they just shout up the money as we go, then, (        ) every time I get to a thousand they say one, two, and you say right, tell me when I get near three, ((laugh)) and I've got this erm, I'm dreadful at maths, I failed maths O Level three times and I   (        ) don't think about prices, I've never been more than fifteen pounds out .
*GIN:	Carry a computer .
*NON:	I can't, you haven't got time.
*GIN:	No.
*NON:	I've never been more than fifteen pounds out, at the end of the day   (        ) which is unbelievable.
*GIN:	Well, very good .
*NON:	It's just   (        ) somewhere.
*GIN:	This is what the Government pay for?
*NON:	This is all for provided for   (        ) Broadmoor.
*GIN:	For the, for the inmates of Broadmoor?
*NON:	Yeah oh yes.
*GIN:	They have a, a life of Riley don't they?
*NON:	Well, the trouble is that they've got a closed 
*GIN:	Think about it .
*NON:	population, whereas in a public library there are people using the  (        ) , some of   (        ) for life so therefore you can't even send   (        ) year in and year out they have to constantly changing
*GIN:	Huh, you have more sympathy for them than I do.
*NON:	aha, ha.
*GIN:	My first sympathy is with the people that they're in there because of, if you see what I mean?Hello love, I mean if they, if they were in cells without any books to read or televisions to watch I wouldn't have that much sympathy, my sympathy is with the little girls
*NON:	Yes.
*GIN:	who've been left
*NON:	Oh yes, I can understand that, but it's in the same way as 
*GIN:	assaulted in bushes ,
*NON:	you don't hate someone, because they have to
*GIN:	oh no I don't hate them.
*NON:	you don't hate someone cos they have Leukaemia, you can't really hate someone 
*GIN:	Oh no ,
*NON:	who has schizophrenia, they're, they're because they've 
*GIN:	no ,
*NON:	done something, because of the illness .
*GIN:	I feel sorry for them there, but for the grace of god, does anyone of us?
*NON:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*GIN:	If they're sick in their heads , if they're sick in their heads and they have to rape little girls.
*NON:	Mm.
*GIN:	But my first thought is for the little girls
*NON:	Oh yes, I  (        ) .
*GIN:	and I would stick a needle in their bottom while they were fast asleep, so they didn't wake up any more, just like you would with an animal that does that.
*NON:	Mm, it's very easy to think that, until you know them as people, I must admit, there are ,
*GIN:	Yes, I can see your point ,
*NON:	there is a hardcore, see, it's not necessarily what they've done, but when you meet them there's something instinctively repulsive about them
*GIN:	yes.
*NON:	and not in, not necessarily the most seriousness, something the way they look at you
*GIN:	Yeah.
*NON:	that to me is a hundred per cent unacceptable
*GIN:	Yes.
*NON:	and you just think yuck
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*NON:	and you have to try and cover over, you can't say, god you're vile aren't you? ((laugh)) , but erm,
*GIN:	Well I remember, so I used to talk to the nurses quite a lot when I walked Roxanna, my other German shepherd, in Wellington
*NON:	Yes.
*GIN:	and quite a lot of the nurses used to walk their nurses, I mean they're er war trained and unarmed combat and they're wardens, let's face it, they're not nurses, and one of them was saying to me, oh we had a fellow in the other day, he'd, he'd a, fallen up the police stations steps I think erm, he said that he'd been to see the do gooders, he had this interview
*NON:	Mm.
*GIN:	and he convinced them he didn't need an operation, he was, he was cured, he'd had his treatment,psy psychiatrist that seen him and he was all right thank you, he said, and they're so clever they can convince anybody on the outside 
*NON:	Oh yes, yes .Yes we ask a psychopath now why  (        ) 
*GIN:	Exactly, and as they took him back to his room, not his cell, but his room, he turned to my, my mate who was with me and said er, I don't want an operation I like having sex with little girls, he said now I've got two little girls and I had to turn and walk away
*NON:	 ((cough)) mm.
*GIN:	I said I can understand, he said I had to turn and walk away because my fingers were itching
*NON:	Yes, I find it a lot easier actually not to know what they've done, when you start work there you tend to come over these cases, which   (        ) to do
*GIN:	Yeah.
*NON:	as much as anything, but it's only cos you're writing a letter, and you say oh hello you writing a letter to mum, he says no I killed her to come here, you don't put your foot in it a big way, but after a while because you know nobody there is nice it really makes a lot of difference   (        ) people
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*NON:	you don't think oh here comes a rapist, here's a sex offender, he's a whatever, just to take them as they come as people, because you've got to treat them all the same anyway
*GIN:	Yes, but this fellow you see, I said to him erm, you had a lot to do with that fellow, he'd, he'd been down to collect him from someone on the South Coast as well with a police of course, and I said what happened to the little girl? he said oh she's been in psychiatric care, care for four years
*NON:	 (        ) oh yeah.
*GIN:	and there's no chance of her, and she was shattered, her, her life was ruined .
*NON:	Oh their life's can be totally wrecked, I don't doubt it for a moment.
*GIN:	But I didn't have much sympathy for the man who was 
*NON:	There, there are those who it gives a   (        ) going out and 
*GIN:	Who's got a cigarette ration and his television ,
*NON:	you think, oh my god, you know, I'll put loads of money on him, (        ) .
*GIN:	yeah, do you remember the one, two or three years ago who talked to do gooders, that he was, he was fine
*NON:	 (        ) 
*GIN:	and he was let out and first, within twenty four hours he'd gone down to the South Coast and killed his mother and his girl friend
*NON:	Yes, oh yes.
*GIN:	just like that.
*NON:	Yes, there are those who  (        ) .
*GIN:	I mean I would, I would I'd stick a needle in their bottoms just like I would for a dog that had gone b , gone bad, I'd say poor creature can't help it
*NON:	There are some, but then you see Ginny there's a girl in there .
*GIN:	I feel sorry for the victims 
*NON:	There's a girl in there killed her daddy, but whey did she kill daddy, she killed daddy because 
*GIN:	Cos dad ,
*NON:	he'd raped her and abused her from 
*GIN:	yes ,
*NON:	the age of six and a half
*GIN:	well she shouldn't be in there .
*NON:	Who's, who's the wrong one there?.
*GIN:	She shouldn't be in there.
*NON:	She needs help.
*GIN:	She shouldn't be in there.
*NON:	Exactly, but I mean I rest my case, there's, when you know their entire story, some of them, it makes you wonder who's more sinning against than sinning   (.) it's a strange affair.
*GIN:	I think she had every right to  (        ) .
*NON:	Yes, so do I, (        ) .
*GIN:	Just to fight   (        ) .
*NON:	But then future is hatred of men, she's likely to go out and kill every other 
*GIN:	Yes ,
*NON:	man she comes across.
*GIN:	yes.
*NON:	Your duties then is to protect the outside world and her from her health.
*GIN:	Yeah.
*NON:	So I mean it, it's obviously a lot more sort of complicated as it seems on the outside .
*UNK:	 (        ) take everyone individual .
*NON:	Henry, come back you silly thing.
*GIN:	 ((laugh)) .
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*NON:	Come here and sit.
*GIN:	What a lot of walk for your fuel wasn't it?Can't you get your van down?It's a long walk.
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*NON:	You like suffering be honest, you like suffering.
*GIN:	You drove past me the other day when I drov , was it you?When I
*NON:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	I did drive the other day, yeah .
*GIN:	When I whipped him , when I whipped him into the side just down there.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*GIN:	I heard this, this, a range rover coming ever so, ever so patiently behind me at walking pace, I suddenly realised there was something behind me.
*NON:	Was that a Sunday morning walk   (        ) Ginny?.
*UNK:	 (        ) a bit busier on the Sunday  (        ) .
*GIN:	I think so, yes, yes.
*NON:	Walked all around yesterday lunch time, didn't see a soul in the pla , I saw one, was it you, on the back meadow?
*UNK:	I wasn't there yesterday  (        ) .
*NON:	There was one chap in the green thingy, yeah.Oh you're so butch and   (        ) Henry, bye, bye
*GIN:	Don't work too hard.
*NON:	I'll see you, phone you one day in the week, I saw the post lady coming up the drive and I said to Henry who's that, he threw himself against the top window so there was indeed someone coming up the drive, tore into the dinning room, picked up his tennis ball, raced back to the window and wow, wow, wow , with his ball in his mouth, and I said Henry you're really going to frightened off intruders with a ball in your mouth, I said   ((laugh))  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh no , honestly he would, if there was strangers.
*NON:	Yes, oh I'm sure he would, but I mean, (        ) .
*GIN:	Wow, wow, wow is enough , yes, he goes mad at the post, he drags it all across, all across the hall, all through the lounge.
*NON:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh yes, I would too if they had one   (        ) .
*NON:	 (        ) , ring up the   (        ) and say sorry my dog ate it.
*GIN:	Yes.
*NON:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Yes, oh Rocket, for the first few months I had him, after he was rescued, and he was so protective of me, because I'd given him a good home and never, never hit him in the face .

*GIN:	No he goes up, he puts his ,
*NON:	Is he yours?.
*GIN:	no put's his paws on Keith and wags his tail and says, hit me.
*NON:	I'll take it.
*GIN:	I'll take, that's what he was   (.) got used to you see 
*NON:	Really .
*GIN:	Can't bear angry voices, first he used to go underneath the rocking chair
*NON:	And hide.
*GIN:	and hide, now, even if Keith's arguing with the television, which he would, Politician, he'll still go up and put his paws up on his knee, wag his tail, and bury his head and say, hit me instead ,
*NON:	Here I am , oh
*GIN:	I'm, I'm the punch bag

*GIN:	a, give him a chew or a treat or something you know.
*NON:	poor Rocket, god how awful.

*GIN:	Threatened her once or twice .
*NON:	 (        ) out the door like that   (        ) I'd put them out the door just like that .

*GIN:	Yeah ,
*NON:	is not one of the emotions.
*GIN:	I think there is sympathy erm for the people who are sick of course I can .
