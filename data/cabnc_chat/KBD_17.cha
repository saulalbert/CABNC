*BAR:	damage a tile, then you're only replacing a tile. •126856_127039•
        And just sort of carpet the two top areas, two raised areas, and have the other, the rest of it as a sort of lino  floor. •127109_127723•
*HUG:	Mm. •127754_127768•

        If you could just get hold of say, the rainbow •132156_132346•
*HUG:	Yeah. •132370_132395•
*BAR:	effect of a I mean, that's the beauty about it  you, you'll never get hold of a Harley Davidson, but you might get hold of a petrol cap. •132415_132971•
*HUG:	Yeah. •133011_133019•

*BAR:	and you just bang those around the place. •133167_133378•
        Er, a few handlebars and whatever else and, but, but  but don't do it like the British bikers, do it like an American  bar, so it can be cleaned and •133378_134158•
*HUG:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	I mean it can look nice and  •134158_134272•

        That's right. •134754_134809•
        You see, and then if, if, if, if, if sort of people are, you know, holiday makers come in, and it's an American theme, they expect it. •134809_135544•
*HUG:	Mm. •135544_135557•
*BAR:	As I say, they expect I've got music, it's not gonna come as a shock to them. •135557_135858•
*HUG:	They've got   •135859_135883•
*BAR:	You know, and it'll, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I think. •135883_136195•
        And, and it won't cost a lot to do, cos all you do instead of green, you'll paint that red  and you've got the white pick out anyway, and a blue, seated blue carpet. •136195_136976•
*HUG:	I wondered what those fucking ! •136976_137139•
