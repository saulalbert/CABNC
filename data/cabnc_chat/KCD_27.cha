*HEL:	I think you've just cost me a fortune today. •917742_919892•
*CLA:	Have I? •920592_921012•
*HEL:	Take one of those boxes of tissues and use tooth brush, tooth paste. •921202_925942•
        What, got some soap have you? •927792_929682•
*CLA:	Yes, yeah. •929772_930592•
*HEL:	Right, your tooth paste. •931152_932442•
*CLA:	Thank you. •933052_933492•
*HEL:	Right, these two can go up, oh that's Amy's soap. •933492_938762•
*CLA:	Bored with it, so I'll  it out every day. •938762_942642•
*HEL:	Yes, right. •942942_943232•
        There's your film. •946472_947112•
*CLA:	Ah thanks. •947112_947312•
*HEL:	Right . •948442_948762•
*CLA:	That's mine?. •948762_949522•
*HEL:	Yeah. •949812_949912•
*CLA:	Oh right. •949912_950322•
*HEL:	There's your cartridges. •950912_953502•
*CLA:	Do I need to take both packets? •953532_956802•
*HEL:	I wouldn't think so, I can't think you'll get through ten cartridges myself, that seems rather excessive. •957082_963542•
