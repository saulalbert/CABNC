*PS1BL:	Where there is a pavement or foot path used do not walk next to the curb with your back from the traffic look both ways before you step into the road where there is no foot path walk on the right hand side of the road it is safer to walk on the side facing on coming traffic keep as close as possible to the side of the road take care at right hand bends keep one behind if that is possible particularly line heavy traffic on flurry do not allow children under age five at least out alone on the road go with them walk between them and the traffic and always keep tight hold of their hands if you ca n't do this then use reigns as security secure them firmly into the pushchair do not let them run into the road always wear or carry something bright or light or reflected within the dark of light this is especially important that all uses it it 's just the rules I suppose .

*PS1BL:	alcohol and road user . 
*PS1BN:	do n't need any more of that you know not to drink and drive you wan na learn your roundabouts junctions and that and get how to give way and . 
*PS1BL:	well we just do this people get asked this drive as responsible and driving that children under fourteen are sitting . 
*PS1BN:	sit down . 
*PS1BL:	when they are travelling in the front a child now one year must use an approved child restrain design for age and weight a child over one may wear any approved child restraint on adult seat belt in the rear a child must be restrained and the appropriate restrain is fitted the the term appropriate restrain includes the following infants under one year old a carry or cot which is held by straps children one two or three years in appropriate child seat or harness or booster cushion with an adult belt not a household cushion Children from four to fourteen year old an appropriate child seat or harness In the rear an adult may be restrained in preference to the child however an adult must not deny a child the use Do not carry children in the middle of space by the rear seats of an estate car or a hatch back unless the manufacturer has provide the seat for this purpose Signs know your traffic signs right signals give signal give signals if they would help or warn other road users watch out for the signals of other drivers and motor cyclists or pedal cyclists and take necessary action from them You must obey the signals given by a police officer . 
*PS1BN:	0 . 
*PS1BL:	way no way see them man Moving off before moving off always use your mirrors but look round as well for a final check signal as necessary before moving out move off only when you can do so safely without making the road user change speed or direction right . 
*PS1BN:	you gon na ask us some questions . 
*PS1BL:	I 'm gon na in a minute driving along what must you do when you 're driving along . 
*PS1BN:	take care . 
*PS1BL:	what else . 
*PS1BN:	I do n't get what you mean anyway . 
*PS1BL:	well when you 're driving along give us some of the things what you do tell us something that you do when you 're driving along . 
*PS1BN:	keep an eye on traffic ahead . 
*PS1BL:	use your mirrors often that you know what is behind you and that each sign is what you said . 
*PS1BN:	erm check all your speed limits . 
*PS1BL:	driving along keep to the left except when road signals or markings indicate otherwise or when you intend to overtake or turn right or when you have to pass stationery vehicles or pedestrians in the road allow others to overtake you if they want you you must not drive on by the side of the road Use your mirrors on narrow or winding roads or where there is a lot of oncoming traffic drivers of large or slow moving vehicles should be prepared to pull in and slow down to stop as soon as there is suitable opportunity well before you take off or turn left or turn right or slow down or stop use your mirrors you should always look behind even if they 're none a motor cycle should always look behind either then give the appropriate signal if necessary remember the routine . 
*PS1BN:	yes . 
*PS1BL:	what . 
*PS1BN:	reverse signal and manoeuvre . 
*PS1BL:	always keep a special look out for cyclists particularly when overtaking or turning bearing in mind that two wheels are much less easy to see than large vehicles Driving for long distances may make you sleepy to help prevent this make sure there is plenty of fresh air in your vehicle if you become tired on the journey stop and rest at a suitable parking place right You must obey the speed limits for the road and for your vehicle remember the except the motorways there is a thirty mile per hour speed limit on all roads where there are streets unless sign show otherwise Bear in mind that any speed limit is a maximum it does not mean that it is safe to drive at that speed always take into account all the conditions at the time never drive so fast that you can not stop well within the distance you can see to be clear Go much more slowly if the road is wet or icy or first drive more slowly at night remember it can be especially difficult to see pedestrians or cyclists at night and in poor daylight conditions do not break sharply except in an emergency Leave enough space between you and the vehicle in front so that you can pull up safely if it slows down or stops suddenly the safe rule is never to get closer than the overall stopping distance shown below but on the open road in good conditions leave a gap of one metre for each mile an hour of your speed or a two second time gap may be enough they will also leave space for an overtaking vehicle pulling or wet or icy or the gap should be at least double that drop back if you know that taking vehicle closing gap in front of you make way for ambulance fire engines police or van emergency vehicles when their blue lamps are flashing or their bells two tone cones or sirens or In towns give way to buses indicating an intention to move out from the bus stops if you can do so safely Use of microphones and car telephones . 
*PS1BN:	They wo n't use . 
*PS1BL:	Do not use a hand held microphone . 
*PS1BN:	0 . 
*PS1BL:	or telephone when vehicles moving except in emergencies you should only stick your fix or clip on microphone where it will not distract your attention from road do not stop on a hard shoul shoulder of a motorway to answer or make a call however urgent Driving in fog when driving in fog check your . 
*PS1BN:	eh check your what your lights . 
*PS1BL:	you see you to do if you 're not listening . 
*PS1BN:	check your lights . 
*PS1BL:	no I did n't say that . 
*PS1BN:	in the in the fog what you do . 
*PS1BL:	what you do when driving in fog check your . 
*PS1BN:	speed yes . 
*PS1BL:	and slow down keep a safe distance you should always be able to pull up within your range of vision what else do n't you do what do n't you do in fog . 
*PS1BN:	overtake . 
*PS1BL:	hang on to somebody elses tail lights it gives us a false sense of security watch your speed you may be going much faster than you think do not speed up to get away from the vehicle which is too close behind you remember that if you 're driving with heavy people it may take longer to pull up and speed on ahead warning signals or . 
*PS1BN:	0 . 
*PS1BL:	check and clean your wind screens lights reflectors and windows remember that fog can give is often patchy . 
*PS1BN:	0 . 
*PS1BL:	even though when it is clearing . 
*PS1BN:	Sharon I only wan na learn this bit by bit you know not the whole book . 
*PS1BL:	a pelican crossing has the signals have the same meaning as traffic lights except that the flashing amber signal will follow the red stop signal when amber light is flashing you must give . 
*PS1BN:	I . 
*PS1BL:	what you do when amber light flashing after the stop . 
*PS1BN:	stop stop at the line stop behind the line . 
*PS1BL:	you must give way to any pedestrians on the crossing so otherwise you may proceed a straight pelican is one crossing even when there is a central refuge and you must wait for people crossing from the further side of the refuge do n't harass the pedestrians for instance by revving your engine When turning into a road junction give way to what 's a road junction . 
*PS1BN:	like a coming out . 
*PS1BL:	oh give way to . 
*PS1BN:	traffic coming out . 
*PS1BL:	pedestrians who are crossing the road in which you are turning when entering or emerging from property bordering on a road give way to pedestrians as well as the traffic on the road remember pavements are for people not for motor cycles motor vehicles . 
*PS1BN:	is it here . 
*PS1BL:	I do n't take Lines and lanes along the road A single broken line with long markings and short gaps in the middle of the road is the . 
*PS1BN:	what lines . 
*PS1BL:	single broken lines with long markings and short gaps with the middle in the middle of the road is the hazard warning lines do not cross it unless you can see that the road well ahead is clear Where there are double white lines along the . 
*PS1BN:	give way . 
*PS1BL:	road and the line nearer to you is solid you must not cross or straddle it except when you need to get in and out of the premises on side road Where there are double white lines along the road and the line nearer to you is broken you may cross the lines to overtake if you Overtaking give us some do not overtake unless you can do so without . 
*PS1BN:	slow motors down or causes . 
*PS1BL:	0 . 
*PS1BN:	I was just gon na say . 
*PS1BL:	before you start overtaking make sure the road is clear use your mirror signal before you move out . 
*PS1BN:	signal then move out . 
*PS1BL:	be careful in the dusk remember mirror signal manoeuvre once you start to overtake move quickly passed the vehicle you are overtaking when overtake er overtake only on the right except when the driver in the front has signalled that he intends to turn right you can overtake him on the left without getting in the way when you want to turn left at a junction when traffic is moving slowly in queues and be er in a lane on the right and moving more slowly than you are in one way streets but not dual carriageways maybe with a path on either side when traffic is moving as described do not increase your speed while being overtaken slow down if necessary to let the overtaking vehicle pass On the tail lane road give way to vehicles coming towards you you must not overtake if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a solid line on the out of you erm if you 're within a zig zag area the pelican crossing after a normal overtaking sign until the end of the restriction do not overtake when you can not see far enough ahead for example when coming through . 
*PS1BN:	bend . 
*PS1BL:	a corner or bend . 
*PS1BN:	single traffic single line traffic . 
*PS1BL:	hump back bridge or the brow of the hill or where you might come into conflict with the car with other road users for example at . 
*PS1BN:	junctions . 
*PS1BL:	the road junction . 
*PS1BN:	roundabout . 
*PS1BL:	do n't say that a level crossing or where the road narrows on approached any type of pedestrian crossing or where it would involve driving over an area marked with diagonal stripes to or che chevrons do not overtake when you do so would force another vehicle to swerve or slow down if in doubt do not overtake so where 'd you not overtake . 
*PS1BN:	on a corner . 
*PS1BL:	or . 
*PS1BN:	hump backed bridge . 
*PS1BL:	mm . 
*PS1BN:	round a bend junction . 
*PS1BL:	yeah . 
*KBMPSUN:	0 . 
*PS1BL:	at a level cross at a level crossing or where the road bends or approach to any pedestrian crossing Road junctions Approach road junctions with great care consider your road position and your speed drive on only when you are sure it is safe to do so and that you will not block the junction watch out for long vehicles which maybe turning left or right at the junction ahead but which may have to use to make a turn when waiting to emerge at a junction do not assume that a vehicle approaching from the right which is signalling with it 's left hand direction indicator would turn left wait to make sure do you know what I mean . 
*PS1BN:	0 . 
*PS1BL:	that if you leave and that car comes and signals left it means that you 've got to wait for it to go in in case it does n't you know what I mean At a junction with double broken white lines across the road it . 
*PS1BN:	0 . 
*PS1BL:	may also have the give way sign on invert inverted triangle on the carriageway you must be ready to let traffic on the major road go first At junctions with a stop sign and a solid white line across your approach you must stop at the line wait for a safe gap in the traffic before you move When crossing the dual carriageway or turning right into the road treat each half as a separate road wait . 
*PS1BN:	do you know what it means by that . 
*PS1BL:	in the cen central driving dividing strip . 
*PS1BN:	do you know what that means . 
*PS1BL:	until there is a safe gap . 
*PS1BN:	do you know what . 
*PS1BL:	it means you come to turn right on road and each . 
*PS1BN:	it 's er . 
*PS1BL:	lanes a separate road does n't it . 
*PS1BN:	you know when you come you know when you and nanny drop us off at ours . 
*PS1BL:	aha . 
*PS1BN:	and there 's a slip road you 've got ta come on to there 's a slip road you go down ai n't there . 
*PS1BL:	aha . 
*PS1BN:	you slowly make your way out do n't got by you look over your right shoulder . 
*PS1BL:	aha . 
*PS1BN:	that 's erm that 's a slip road what you and then your next lane you stay in that lane only use a right and then if you want to overtake you go into right and then back into right . 
*PS1BL:	oh . 
*PS1BN:	I mean never stay in the right hand lane . 
*PS1BL:	why . 
*PS1BN:	because you overtake is speeding there the left hand lane is n't the right hand lane is for overtaking . 
*PS1BL:	what happens at our speed . 
*PS1BN:	well you stick on the right hand lane when no one overtaking that 's not causing trouble for us is it . 
*PS1BL:	Where a junction has a mini roundabout it will have a sign placed before the give way Boxed junctions have criss cross yellow lines painted on the road You must not enter the box . 
*PS1BN:	you stay behind it . 
*PS1BL:	if your exit road or lane from from is not clear but you may enter the box when you want to turn right and are prevented from doing so Junctions controlled by police or a traffic warden when all traffic is held up by police officer or traffic warden you must not go left or right until you are signalled to do so Junctions controlled by traffic lights do not go forward when the traffic lights are green unless there is room for you to clear the junction safely never go forward when the red amber lights are shown together when traffic lights have a green arrow filter signal do not get into the lane when filtering is allowed unless you Well before you turn right use your mirror to make sure you know the position on movement of the traffic behind you When it is safe give a right turn signal and as soon as you can do so take safely take up position just left of the middle of the road or in the space marked by right turned vehicles if you can leave room for other vehicles to pass on the left wait until there is a safe gap between you and any oncoming vehicle looking look out of sight for motor cyclists and pedestrians then make a turn but do not cut the corner as people like pedestrians crossing the road in which you are turning Remember mirror signal manoeuvre When approaching a roundabout I 'm not testing you any more . 
*PS1BN:	I was laughing at her that fake thing she 's got on it . 
*PS1BL:	I 'm not testing you any more . 
*PS1BN:	I 'll test you then . 
*PS1BL:	What 's the . 
*PS1BN:	you know carriage a single carriage way . 
*PS1BL:	mm . 
*PS1BN:	now a a dual carriage way that has three lanes what lane do you use . 
*PS1BL:	the left . 
*PS1BN:	right what one you use for overtaking . 
*PS1BL:	mm . 
*PS1BN:	what one you use for overtaking . 
*PS1BL:	right . 
*PS1BN:	middle lane . 
*PS1BL:	all three lanes is the taught now middle . 
*PS1BN:	middle lane you never stay in it either . 
*PS1BL:	so what 's the last . 
*PS1BN:	it 's just . 
*PS1BL:	one for . 
*PS1BN:	turn right . 
*PS1BL:	turn aye . 
*PS1BN:	see the one . 
*PS1BL:	0 . 
*PS1BN:	like you know on the opposite side of the road you 've got as much right to use that as he has . 
*PS1BL:	right . 
*PS1BN:	on a single carriageway where a road has four four lanes do not use . 
*PS1BL:	on a single carriageway where a lane has got four lanes . 
*PS1BN:	yeah if a single carriageway or has four more lanes do not use the right hand path you use that one and that one but do n't use them two . 
*PS1BL:	why er if plain English that right in it . 
*PS1BN:	it 's the same same as er three way one . 
*PS1BL:	so you 've gotto take on fast moving traffic or turn right right are we asking some more questions I do n't know that much really I do n't know . 
*PS1BN:	right . 
*PS1BL:	I . 
*PS1BN:	I 'm gon na ask you some stopping distances . 
*PS1BL:	I do n't know them . 
*PS1BN:	well you 're gon na learn them cos you 've got they they ask you straight away that a built up area . 
*PS1BL:	mm .

*PS1BN:	it 's seventy like it 's a dual carriageway . 
*PS1BL:	well it tells you and if it 's any less than seventy . 
*PS1BN:	no I 'm sure one of you says it was seventy for the coast road it 's only a two way traffic . 
*PS1BL:	0 . 
*PS1BN:	it 's a two way traffic a single lane traffic so it 's classed as sixty . 
*PS1BL:	but it tells you on the thing it a white thing with a line through it .

*PS1BN:	the national speed limit aye . 
*PS1BL:	seventy . 
*PS1BN:	you 've got two that 's not your you 've got two national speed limits you 've got a sixty and a seventy seventy is for like a dual carriageway and a motorway sixty is a single carriageway cos it 's only two way traffic . 
*PS1BL:	so white line with a black thing through could be just sixty . 
*PS1BN:	it could be sixty if you 're on a if you 're on a two way traffic right . 
*PS1BL:	mot what 's on a motorway .

*PS1BM:	at seventy mile it should be your hundred and forty feet . 
*PS1BL:	should n't have . 
*PS1BN:	no you should n't it should be three hundred and fifteen the overall length seventy is your think thinking distance for that is seventy and your stopping distance should be two four five . 
*PS1BL:	how 'd ya work it out Darren you gon na tell us or not . 
*PS1BN:	it 's so simple . 
*PS1BL:	right well it is .
