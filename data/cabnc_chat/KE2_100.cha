*TER:	Have you got potatoes? •233455_236555•
*GRO:	 (        )  (.)

        You put it there and I put it somewhere else •260025_261705•
*TER:	What's that? •261935_262395•
        The mat? •263215_263575•
*MAR:	I thought I put it over there, erm I would only want half of these potatoes, would you manage those? •266455_273255•
*TER:	Ha, I don't know I'll have one anyway, I'll see then when I, whether I can manage the other half afterwards or not, cos it looks enormous •273255_281135•
*MAR:	Well they're all big now aren't they? •281955_283425•
*TER:	They are, that's right •283425_284445•
*MAR:	There was one that I had to throw away because it was erm •284445_286805•
*TER:	Oh is that so •287135_287895•
*MAR:	all damaged at one end and I, you know, erm  thought I'd cut that away •287895_295195•
*TER:	Yeah •295565_295845•
*MAR:	but in fact it was bad all the way through •296755_298425•
*TER:	Mm  •298425_298775•
*MAR:	so , I must confess when I say that we've had bad, like that time when  Did you give er Lucy back her English? •301265_356755•
*TER:	Mm, mm •356755_357015•
*MAR:	I thought she was clutching it as she went past here  but erm, oh you've had some? •357295_372005•
*TER:	No I haven't, I haven't, when you've had yours  •372295_400155•
*MAR:	This is the cheesy one  I bought some beetroot the other day, they had some nice little ones, which I must cook, they were ever so cheap, I've forgotten how cheap but you know they were really cheap  •404405_431595•
*TER:	Mm  •434065_434175•
*MAR:	Now can you see what I did with the lid at them? •434315_445095•
*TER:	Yes •446915_447175•
*MAR:	Oh perhaps I never had it  a man came here, from somebody or other double glazing •451105_460875•
*TER:	Oh I heard the bell go  •462965_463865•
*MAR:	I thought it might of been Pat sort of at that time, but erm  when I looked out I saw a man with a billboard thing  •470015_492335•
*TER:	One of the little maps in the book shows the Isle of Wight with some towns round the Isle of Wight, and it said Poole so she said Poole, she said  the boat sailed from out of France? •494425_562745•
        So I said no Portsmouth oh she said that's right she said I'm going from Portsmouth •562805_566845•
*MAR:	Oh is she? •567585_568115•
*TER:	Oh I said, yes she said, I like going on a boat, she said not that I've been on one she said  she's never been on a boat across •570535_579745•
*MAR:	No I don't think any of them have you see •580435_582075•
*TER:	Oh, she's you know, when she's been to Austria of course she's flown •582655_586475•
*MAR:	Yes that's right  •586705_587505•
*TER:	so she's erm, quite looking forward to that •590355_592525•
*MAR:	She is, gave her some of the warnings that er •593615_596105•
*TER:	No I didn't actually, but  •596105_597225•
*MAR:	I shouldn't think it great easy to fall off a boat actually would you? •602745_606665•
*TER:	No  well  having said that, if you're fool enough to sit on the side •608425_621405•
*MAR:	Oh yeah  but I mean if you're sitting on a seat or if you've got sort of have the rails  •622185_630495•
*TER:	Ah, mm, mm, mm  •630495_630705•
*MAR:	looking at the water, I think you would have to sort of climb up over the rails to fall in wouldn't you? •630705_636815•
*TER:	Oh yeah, you'd have to perch up on them, sit on them, you know •636815_640295•
*MAR:	Mm •640295_640415•
*TER:	well I mean you know, you know what children are, you never know what they might do •640415_646475•
*MAR:	I always took the point about the children in the hall didn't they? •646655_651045•
*TER:	Mm, mm •651325_651645•
*MAR:	They hadn't thought about that  do you know, I reckon that Sister Josephine erm behind all this, she wanted that hall and she and Father  used to talk about this you see  they want to extend the church back and do away with the car parking area as well, oh that's alright, but erm  sort of can't see any point in it, I mean congregations are going down, they're not increasing, the church is big enough for  what is necessary I would of thought wouldn't you? •653055_718482•
        Don't need a cathedral in it  •721512_722862•
*TER:	Well of course you never know I mean if they close Saint Gregory's •722902_725532•
*MAR:	I wouldn't of thought they'd do that •727902_729842•
*TER:	Mm, I wouldn't, but •731442_732972•
*MAR:	They'd of more like I would of thought close King Staiton  because Saint Gregory's was a purpose built church •733662_743782•
*TER:	Yeah  •743782_744082•
*MAR:	but I never forget the way that Doreen when she said we were doing things, she said you shouldn't of started it she said, you'll only get kicked in the teeth at Saint Joseph's •744872_763872•
*TER:	Is that what she said? •764502_765262•
*MAR:	Oh yes right from the beginning •765332_766892•
*TER:	Did she really? •766892_767412•
        I didn't know that  oh •767412_774042•
*MAR:	Yes, when we came out here   I'll never forget Mark, not even saying thank you, not, not even for raising the money I mean I wouldn't expect that from the parishioners, that's what we should be trying to do, but even for the food and that, till erm Kitty and  and the way he got up then and said it, most ungraciously •774802_837212•
*TER:	Yes  mind you I had to admit, you know me, I know, never have been very impressed with him  •838372_851072•
*MAR:	With him , well for some reason he doesn't like us, well, you say I was thinking, I've been thinking as you know this is the sort of thing that I, gets on to my mind, but I was thinking to myself well really and truly we are so honest people ourselves, we don't go round you know and screw sort of fiddling things, I suppose it comes to hard to us when we discover other people have •851072_886252•
*TER:	Yeah  •886252_886412•
*MAR:	but I know Kay wasn't very pleased with Sister about these sort of erm  stout things, cos Sister said well if they're not collected by the time of the next jumble, we sort of empty the cupboard and put them all in for erm the jumble sale   Kay said to me they're not hers to do that with •893992_919922•
*TER:	Mind you •923742_924412•
*MAR:	No, no, no that was, I mean Kay did what she had to do and sort of got the person  •926302_930392•
*TER:	Yeah, fair enough  •930392_930972•
*MAR:	to do it, but Sister wouldn't of even have that, she would of just erm, chucked them, but I know Kay put a lot of work into, she's not coming •931172_944372•
*TER:	Who's not coming? •944832_946852•
*MAR:	Whoever is due to come •947852_949712•
