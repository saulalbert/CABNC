*JEA:	It's terrible.
*BRE:	And erm, so of course, she's, you know, not been well for a couple of weeks and she's gone down from nine four, to seven stone.
*JEA:	Lord.
*BRE:	So they said last week there having her in and she's in till Christmas.
*JEA:	Why can't people be happy.Why can't they be contented with what they've got?
*BRE:	That's right, well I said to Lee, you don't half pick your blooming girl friends, he had that neurotic one up the road, didn't he?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	But this one I think he's not

*JEA:	Yes,
*BRE:	on a 
*JEA:	having ,
*BRE:	Saturday.
*JEA:	having been through that experience with Helen, he'll be a lot more weary.
*BRE:	Yeah cos he realise I mean, he often says oh well, you know, she made me turn against my family and be horrible and he says I haven't had time, he says I realise how wrong I was.
*JEA:	Neil, Neil now says, that when he meets a girl, he, he waits to see if she's got any characteristics in common with the dreadful Vicky , the girl that he eventually fetch her much deserved slosh on the chops and was pulled into Ipswich Magistrates Court, you know, oh I shouldn't laugh, but erm, he says he looks for those characteristics, and the moment he sees that the girl is going to be this sort of neurotic, excitable, hysterical creature he walks away.
*BRE:	I don't blame him.
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	Well I think Lee, he, he just realise, I mean   (        ) I mean he only sees her once a week any way, doesn't he? (.) but you know, she is, she is a lovely girl
*JEA:	Good.
*BRE:	but erm, it's like now, I mean there's no way she'll visit cos he's got too much homework in the work
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	and I mean he's tied up tomorrow.
*JEA:	Mm, yeah.
*BRE:	Erm, (.) I said did you say your mum phoned up?
*DAV:	No, I phoned her last night, she  (        ) .
