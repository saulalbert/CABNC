*JEA:	Well, the thing I mainly notice when last week when Paul was home, not last week, the week before last I had Paul solidly at home, he moved himself entirely in lock, stock and barrel at the weekend, he was then with me waiting for his job  and he went out every day and did little bit's of shopping for me, got him from under my feet, saved me money, cos I was only buying what I absolutely needed, and the amount of time that I had, I mean I was able to go out for the whole day with Peggy on Wednesday, I was able to get food prepared and, admittedly I didn't manage to get as much done as I thought I was going to do, but then I think that's with most people in life, •152892_198342•
