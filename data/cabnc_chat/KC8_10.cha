*UNK:	Yes, for his cars •153254_153532•
*GIL:	Well actually I've, I've, I'm toying with the idea, I haven't quite made my mind up, erm I've seen some wax waistcoats •153534_154438•
*UNK:	Oh •154449_154477•
*GIL:	wax jackets but they're a waistcoat and I've, I've ordered one really just to see what it's, it's like, because erm at the moment I can, I just try and get a bit closer to the door, I think we'll go round again, erm  cos in the, in my club book at the moment, I, I can get twenty percent off and which brings it down to, it's well say thirty pound so twenty per cent off it brings me down to erm  brings it down to twenty four pounds and then erm with my commission off that brings it down to just under twenty one pound •154482_158422•
*UNK:	mm •158459_158477•
*GIL:	so I'm toying, that's what I'm toying with at the moment, is this erm  wax jacket •158478_159422•
*UNK:	Oh. •159422_159429•
*GIL:	well it's not a jacket, it's a sort, as I say it's a waistcoat. •159430_159796•

*UNK:	Dad's just got in •160258_160470•
*GIL:	Oh gawld, move forward a bit, so that's what I was going to get, but erm in BeWise they've got erm checked shirts and they're five ninety nine this brushed cotton thing, so I thought if I get him that waistcoat and a pair of cords, erm and get him one of these brushed cotton shirts   that'll be that sort of colour  •160715_163202•
*UNK:	How much are the cords then? •163208_163372•
*GIL:	What in the club book? •163372_163585•

*UNK:	Well what do you want? •165624_165783•
*GIL:	Well I'm, I'm easy, I mean the thickish cord erm, washes , they wear better I think the thickish cord but I mean erm and they're a bit warmer, but if you shop about usually you can get them erm the same price as the needlecord  I'll leave that with you, right. •165784_167781•
*UNK:	If we've got to go to Boston at some point, for the bras you see, so erm •167798_168632•
