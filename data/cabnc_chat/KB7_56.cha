*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JEA:	You used to buy the   (.) I don't know  whether they do that or not now. 
*ANN:	 I don't know whether they do that.  I know it's quite, the stamp duty can come to a lot of money can't it? 
*JEA:	Yeah. And mine did. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JEA:	I read that 
*ANN:	Yeah, you had it out the other day.  It's a lot of money. 
*JEA:	 I didn't think it would  be that. Well the solicitor just took that off the  price of the house. 
*ANN:	 Well that's it, they just  they just see to it all. You don't know  how many, how much   
*JEA:	 Yeah but see  they can't do that with you cos you're not selling a house. 
*ANN:	No. 
*JEA:	You're just buying a house. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JEA:	You know, so   (.) ooh they're crafty aren't they? Never mind, not to worry. Not to worry, all these things come to try you. 
*ANN:	Yeah.  (.) We signed all the forms anyway so that's something.  ((laugh)) But with his being tied up with a pension he gets twelve thousand pension as well. 
*JEA:	Oh, that's alright.  (.) But then if he  if he ever needs   
*ANN:	 Once he retires. 
*JEA:	Yeah but what happens if he snuffs it? Is that house paid for Ann? 
*ANN:	Oh yeah. 
*JEA:	Oh that's alright. That's covered. 
*ANN:	It will be yours. 
*JEA:	Yeah that's alright.  Mine? 
*ANN:	  (  )  
*JEA:	Ooh  (  ) ? 
*ANN:	Yeah. You're his next of kin and you're the one on the paper. He had to put your name down on it. 
*JEA:	Did he? 
*ANN:	As you're next er his next of kin and you will    (.)  (  ) the property will become yours. 
*JEA:	 You'll have to   
*STU:	 Is that alright? 
*JEA:	You'll have to make a will now then. 
*STU:	If you don't want all the   (.) chips  don't bother   
*ANN:	 Oh I don't  want as that, I didn't want as that. I said a couple. 
*STU:	Well that is a couple. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEA:	I say   (.) he'll have to make a will now.  So that you'll be the beneficiary. 
*ANN:	 Don't matter  does it? 
*JEA:	No, but you should do. Aye it does matter! Does matter. 
*ANN:	I say I can't see you saying right   (.) he's died tom  today, out tomorrow can you? ((laugh))  
*JEA:	I didn't think I'd get anything anyway. 
*ANN:	You're his next of kin you see. 
*JEA:	Am I? 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JEA:	How about his father?  (.)  Yeah, how about his father? 
*ANN:	  (  ) he didn't mention it.  Your name's on it now. 
*JEA:	Yeah but his father's his next of kin just as much as I am Ann.  (  ) put that out, I'll put that out   (.) cos you'll not get any peace. You won't get any peace Ann. I'll put that out. 
*ANN:	Well your name's on it so that's it. 
*JEA:	Yeah but I was just saying, when you think about it. See, there's all these complications.  (.) If anything happens to me. 
*ANN:	Yeah but if you're the named person. 
*JEA:	Yeah.  (.) I don't know whether his father is    (  )  (.) probably is isn't he? 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*JEA:	See if you think about that don't you?  (.) It's the same with anything to me, if I leave this house to Sheila and Bruce   (.) if anything happened to Sheila Bruce would get it. You know. 
*ANN:	 (  ) Sh  Sheila's dad. 
*JEA:	Shouldn't, he should really but I don't really want that to happen  ((laugh)) . 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) And that's the law isn't it? 
*JEA:	Shouldn't say that, should I? I know.  (.) When my mother met, we were met you know   (.) when we got married the solicitor had us in because he wanted us to make a will because see   (.) we didn't take the money that we got from mum. But if anything had happened to me   (.) any of her husbands could. 
*STU:	Is that alright dear? 
*ANN:	 Lovely thank you. 
*JEA:	 Yeah.  And me mum used to live off the interest on what, you know dad   (  ) cos he didn't leave a will. But when we got married see that complicated things because   (.)  if anything had happened to me   
*ANN:	 Your husband would have been entitled to it. 
*JEA:	yo  my husband was entitled to it. 
*ANN:	That's it. (.)  
*JEA:	Well there you are. Yeah, all sorts of funny things can happen, isn't there? When you think about it. 
*STU:	Kettle is boiling if you want a 
*JEA:	Pardon? 
*STU:	The kettle    (  )   
*ANN:	 I'll make   it in a minute. 
*JEA:	 No no no  no. I'll wait until you've had your tea.  (.) It's alright    (  )  (.) I've had my hair done.
