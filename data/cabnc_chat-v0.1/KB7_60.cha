*STU:	And a few hundred in the building society. •771515_773065•
        And I've still got my unit trust thing but I know it's gone down. •774105_776235•
        I don't want to touch it if  I'll leave and leave it if I can. •776235_779435•
        It, no, I mean that  was always my plan if ever you need the money  •780535_785155•
*NON:	 (        ) 
*STU:	Okay  alright. •786475_787105•

*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	I was gonna be nice to you today and all. •793403_795103•
        Yeah as I say, that unit trust thing I was  I know it's not the safest investment but it never was the  safest  investment. •795103_804543•
        It was a  at the time it was a  I'd got the money and it was a bit of a speculation. •804543_810073•
        But unfortunately it's not quite worked out  to plan. •810873_813763•
        But I mean if  •813763_814313•
*ANN:	If it, if if  •815173_817793•
*STU:	I mean even with the market being depressed there's still gonna be eight hundred pounds in there. •820253_823403•
*ANN:	So it's •823473_823653•
*STU:	that's but that's making a loss. •827833_829093•
        I mean I'd rather leave it if I can until it does  •830163_832473•
*ANN:	Yeah  if we absolutely •832733_833543•
*STU:	If we're absolutely desperate then  •833543_835513•
*ANN:	We'll have to do it. •835753_837373•
        Is it hard getting them out? •837373_838493•
        I don't know, or I can't remember. •838493_839923•
*STU:	Few  few days. •840003_840713•
        Phone them up  phone them up. •840973_841633•
        Find out what  •841633_843983•
*ANN:	You don't want to make a loss if you don't have to. •843983_845813•
*STU:	find out what the price is and if the price is  you know whatever then you take them out. •846053_850403•
        Just say right I'll cash, take cash and you  and they will send you a cheque in the post more or less. •850893_855423•
        But as I say, yeah  •860013_860983•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	unfortunately I mean if I'd left it where it was erm would have, it would have been better. •863083_867713•
        So  say if we have to we have to. •870603_872743•
        You know, I'd rather wait until  you know till  •873153_877223•
*ANN:	Until it's taken out. •877293_877693•
*STU:	till then. •877693_878013•
        That's right. •878023_879083•
        Until the market picks up again and  •879353_883253•
*ANN:	I mean it's not a good investment is it? •883253_887013•
        Speculative. •887233_887373•
*STU:	yeah  yeah but the  when I was  •887703_890273•

*STU:	when I was advising  •891303_892193•
*ANN:	Well well well that's it. •892193_892913•

        Er •902853_902883•
*ANN:	I mean there's safer investments. •902883_904433•

*STU:	Didn't matter so much at that particular time. •912553_915863•
        And the  market looked as though it was gonna be  quite buoyant. •916143_919013•
        I wish I'd have took them out a long while ago when they were  higher. •919053_920993•
