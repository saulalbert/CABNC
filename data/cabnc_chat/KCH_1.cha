        And we'll save the decorating for when it's raining again. •_•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	Cos it's not as if we have to keep it for the weekend, I can do it during the week. •_•

        After that you think, you    right. •_•
        I think that's worse than having a filling. •_•

*PHI:	for years. •_•
*JAN:	I don't think we have to discuss that while we're eating. •_•
        All too prone to neglect  so that's why we take good care of your teeth. •_•
*PHI:	Pardon? •_•
*JAN:	No it's not, I didn't put it back. •_•

*JAN:	And put your turkey mug away for a while. •_•
*CHR:	Yes. •_•
*JAN:	Good. •_•
        Well David's mug is positively quiet compared to  •_•
*CHR:	I'll finish this drink first though. •_•
*JAN:	Well yes . •_•
        I think we might even wash it before it goes in the  David's mug is quiet compared to  Oh have you bitten your mouth again? •_•
        I think it's because you try to eat too much at one go. •_•
*DAV:	Well there's this first. •_•
*CHR:	 ((sigh)) 
*JAN:	If you want to wear your jeans Chrissy, they're in the drawer. •_•

*PHI:	What's your plan on the violin front today Chris? •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
        We didn't do a particularly good practice on Thursday. •_•
        Friday night you got let off. •_•
        So  there's two good ones to do. •_•
        We've got to go through one of the exam pieces. •_•
        She wants to run through them all and then you've got to fill in a piece of paper on which three pieces you'd like to do, and you know, she wants the cheque and  full details of what name to go on the certificate and that sort of thing. •_•
        I read it through as four pounds, and Brenda next to me is saying, fourteen and I had to re-read it, it, course it's fourteen. •_•
        I thought that was rather a lot. •_•
*PHI:	Not really. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
        I don't remember it being that much last year, but she's using a different board this year so maybe that's something to do with it. •_•
*PHI:	David, another piece of this. •_•
*JAN:	I think he's had enough. •_•
*PHI:	Right. •_•
*DAV:	No, not, not , Vitalite please. •_•
*JAN:	Oh. •_•
*PHI:	I know. •_•
        I know, I've got it all worked out. •_•
*CHR:	I'll have the crusts. •_•

*PHI:	Well •_•
*JAN:	Is that alright? •_•
*PHI:	Yep. •_•
        Fine. •_•
        After two dinners now I've had enough. •_•

        I'm not interested. •_•
        I had that Thursday night. •_•
*JAN:	The beef, yes, that's, I thought you did. •_•
        Erm, we need some more milk. •_•

*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	But we can pick that up any time today can't we? •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
        Or Sunday. •_•
*CHR:	Certainly looks like it  the sun's going in. •_•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •_•
*PHI:	Yeah, probably if you want me to get that old mower going I ought to go up to Woods and  see if I can get a new drive belt. •_•
*JAN:	Well it would be nice if I could use it. •_•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •_•
*DAV:	But why don't you use the other one? •_•
*JAN:	And when, when the weather is nice  •_•
*PHI:	Mm? •_•
*JAN:	I said I would be very happy to be out there. •_•
*DAV:	We've got two mowers. •_•
        The red one and a green one. •_•
        Why don't you use the green one? •_•
*PHI:	Well I like the ride on one because it's easier. •_•
        The, the  green one it takes hours to cut  used to take about three hours for me to cut all the grass with that one. •_•
*JAN:	But first, but when we first came here I spent three hours on a Sunday morning, and I only did that area where you play football. •_•
*DAV:	Ah! •_•
*JAN:	Mind you, I was just slow. •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	Erm  •_•
*PHI:	If you'd started the motor and used it it would have helped. •_•
*JAN:	What about, are we going to put that one in the sale this year, the one that's out in the shed? •_•
*PHI:	Yes I would think so. •_•
*JAN:	Yes it would be nice if we were, we got rid of that. •_•

*JAN:	Then I can  •_•
*CHR:	traction engine rally auction. •_•
*JAN:	That's what, yes I think it was . •_•
*PHI:	But it's the  it's the transporting of it. •_•
        I have no trailer. •_•
*JAN:	You see if we can get away on holiday earlier this year because the violin exam's in June or in July we'll be back. •_•
        Cos you remember we came round, we came back the night before the traction engine rally cos I didn't have time to get organized. •_•
*DAV:	What about, you could hire a trailer. •_•
*PHI:	Not with your mouth full! •_•
*JAN:	I'm sure we could  work out something. •_•
*PHI:	I'll have to check I've got all the engine bits, whether I left any at dad's so I can at least stick, bolt  •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*PHI:	the engine back together. •_•
*JAN:	You do agree though we should get rid of it? •_•
*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
        I'm never going to do that one. •_•
        There's your tractor to do, there's my motorbike to do, and so many other  •_•
*JAN:	I know but that  •_•
*PHI:	things that mower's a  •_•
*JAN:	I don't like  •_•

*PHI:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	Repot some plants. •_•
*DAV:	Dad. •_•
*PHI:	Yes love. •_•
*DAV:	You've never taken us on a ride on your motorbike this year. •_•
*PHI:	Well I haven't, haven't had it out this year. •_•

*JAN:	D'ya know I think, I think, I think it has been out this year. •_•
*PHI:	Yes I, actually I think it •_•
*JAN:	It has. •_•
*PHI:	I think we have run it once this year. •_•
        But er, there's two things Dave. •_•
*DAV:	Yes. •_•
*PHI:	Number one is, I don't like using it on wet grass. •_•
        The other one, is you and Chrissy  getting too big to take you both on it now. •_•
        Have to be one at a time now. •_•
        And you'll have to ride on the back, you can't ride on the tank any more. •_•
*DAV:	Why? •_•
*PHI:	You're too big. •_•
*JAN:	You're too big now. •_•
        You're six now. •_•
*DAV:	I remember when I used to ride on the tank. •_•
*JAN:	You were only a baby, I used to be very frightened. •_•
        You had nothing to hold on to, you were just squeezed in between daddy's legs. •_•
*DAV:	But when I  was a bit older •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*DAV:	and I was still riding on the tank •_•
*JAN:	Yes but •_•
*DAV:	I gripped erm  I gripped it. •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
        Yes well your hands were a bit bigger and you knew where to hold on. •_•
*PHI:	More? •_•
*JAN:	Yes please. •_•
        Thank you. •_•
*DAV:	Dad. •_•
*PHI:	Mhm? •_•
*DAV:	We can get the motorbike out in the summer. •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
        I wasn't meaning that motorbike in any case. •_•
        That one goes. •_•
        There's another one in there that doesn't. •_•
        Ah. •_•
*JAN:	Oh don't tell me . •_•
        Which reminds me, when are we going to get rid of all those other car bits in there? •_•
*DAV:	Oh yes! •_•
        I know, there's a windscreen up er, on the ceiling •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*DAV:	which came from the car you, you two got married in. •_•
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	And you've still got that  paste on it. •_•
*JAN:	I was under the impression we got married in the church . •_•
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	No you got it wrong Dave. •_•
*DAV:	Well you nicked it off someone's car though. •_•
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	I dismantled  that car. •_•
*JAN:	 ((cough)) 
*PHI:	It was one  your uncle David  brought up for me so that I could get  take it to pieces to make the car we'd got  better. •_•
*DAV:	Ah! •_•
*PHI:	Took the engine out, the gearbox out. •_•
*JAN:	You do realize it's nine years later and we've still got the bits, got all the bits in the garage? •_•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •_•
        Be collector's pieces. •_•
*JAN:	Can we get rid of them? •_•
        No I'm, I'm  •_•
*PHI:	D'ya want any more? •_•
*JAN:	I'm having another piece of toast in a moment. •_•
        But there's no rush though. •_•
        I'm tired this morning, but not as tired as I thought I would be considering two nights out. •_•
*PHI:	At least you've had one of them in your own bed. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
        And the smoke  the smoke on Thursday was awful! •_•
        You'd think the Roadrunners friends wouldn't smoke as much as they did. •_•
        But then you see Wendy brings all the friends from Leckernby Installations, of course, they all smoke. •_•
        They got crowds of them from there. •_•
*PHI:	Mhm. •_•
*JAN:	Actually I was thinking  it would be nice erm  I have to make a team up with erm  Wendy's parents and we would do quite well with the joint knowledge of four of us. •_•
*PHI:	It's your competitive instinct coming out again. •_•
        You're trying to win. •_•
*JAN:	One of the questions erm, there was a  one of the categories was quiz shows  so I thought well I, I don't, I won't do very well here cos I just don't watch enough  and one of the questions was, who was the helper on erm  My, on Take Your Pick? •_•
        The old Take Your Pick. •_•
        Well one of the ones that that used to Take Your Pick? •_•
*PHI:	Who well Michael  •_•
*JAN:	That was Michael Miles. •_•
*PHI:	Michael Miles used to do it. •_•
        Who was the helper? •_•
*JAN:	On Take Your, on Take Your Pick. •_•
*PHI:	Bob  Walker. •_•
*JAN:	Well, you see, er we didn't know that. •_•
        if you'd have been there we'd have done well. •_•
        And then it was who was the helper on Double Your Money? •_•
        Well we  •_•
*PHI:	Hughey Green and er  •_•
*JAN:	finally got to Monica and we thought that was enough, so we just wrote Monica, we thought they'd accept that and they did n't. •_•
        the  we didn't get the full marks we, we didn't get  •_•
*PHI:	I can't remember her name. •_•
*JAN:	Monica Rose. •_•
*PHI:	Oh. •_•
*JAN:	But you see, if we'd had yous and then, we were doing quite well up until  •_•
*PHI:	Well I wasn't around. •_•

*JAN:	Erm  I rinsed out the bottom of the , yes. •_•
*PHI:	Alright. •_•
*JAN:	Why would they leave those poles? •_•
        I mean they were there at lunchtime when I came home and there was nobody with them so I assumed they'd knocked off for lunch. •_•
        And then •_•
*PHI:	I think somebody's trying to upset you. •_•
*JAN:	is that all they're trying to do? •_•
        Because it's frustrating  •_•
*PHI:	Well no, I don't know, but  •_•
*JAN:	to put them there and then  •_•
*PHI:	I wouldn't er  •_•
*JAN:	leave them there. •_•
*PHI:	they've lined one up at each end of the field so it, it looks like they're saying, well, you know that's a parcel of land. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*PHI:	But, I don't know. •_•
*JAN:	I mean I, I reckon it'd be nice if they, they sort of parcel it up and then sell some of it •_•
*PHI:	Go round and ask. •_•
*JAN:	No. •_•
*PHI:	Why not? •_•
*JAN:	I I don't know whether I want to  spend er, you know, so much money on that. •_•
*PHI:	Well would you rather do that or have a conservatory? •_•
*JAN:	Well it  the land would cost  so much  more than the I don't know if I want to spend so much money here, I'd rather  •_•

*PHI:	It's alright. •_•
        Janet should come to work shouldn't she? •_•
*JAN:	Do you think she'll  turn up on Monday? •_•
*PHI:	Oh I would think so. •_•
        She's got the most  abysmal sickness record! •_•
        She'll  rigid cos her pay stopped at one stage and  it was wrong because she hadn't been warned •_•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •_•
*PHI:	but erm  she did a  threw a wobbler about it and  •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*PHI:	then when we checked into it •_•
*JAN:	It was right. •_•
*PHI:	and you got her sickness record it  it was, well it's •_•
*JAN:	What's the matter with her? •_•
*PHI:	they nearly paid her  erm early forties and a spinster. •_•
*JAN:	Oh Phillip! •_•
        That's  •_•
*PHI:	D'ya know what I mean? •_•
*JAN:	very sexist. •_•
        I don't like that. •_•
        Is she in her early forties? •_•
*PHI:	Yes. •_•
        Forty one I think. •_•
*JAN:	You mean she's my age? •_•
        I thought she was older than me. •_•
*PHI:	There you are, you see. •_•
*JAN:	No I think   •_•
*PHI:	She's, she's, she's typical of the •_•
*JAN:	Now now! •_•
*PHI:	of the eight cats •_•
*JAN:	Oh I know she is. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*PHI:	living on your own syndrome. •_•
        So I think it's the cats she catches anything from. •_•
        She worries and frets all the time. •_•
        It's cos she's nobody to talk to. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
        That's what  Julie and I were saying that  when you live on your own you get a bit like that. •_•
*PHI:	Oh! •_•
        She, she gets all wound up at home and then comes to work and  where there's people to sound off about, everything under the  er the sun. •_•
*JAN:	We were saying about John, we was talking about John  as well. •_•
*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	And the fact he can't just accept things, he has to question things. •_•
        And we were talking about M E, and how •_•
*PHI:	Oh he's a very intense person. •_•
*JAN:	how Dave, I was saying about Dave and how he's sort of taken, taken a completely different attitude to things. •_•
*PHI:	More relaxed. •_•
        But  •_•
*JAN:	If he, if he couldn't do anything then he would accept it and not do it and then try a bit and if he had to  go back to bed. •_•
        I mean he gave up work for a long time didn't he? •_•
*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
        But it's such a  sort of thing  •_•
*JAN:	And the contrast in personalities though, they're just   •_•
*PHI:	Well there's a contrast in personality and you don't really know whether anybody's got the same thing because nobody's narrowed it down  •_•
*JAN:	No, oh no, I mean  •_•
*PHI:	down. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah you can't. •_•
*PHI:	All they know is that they're •_•
*JAN:	But Julie was saying  •_•
*PHI:	different. •_•
*JAN:	about that sleeping treatment that he took,that finished him off because he, he, he  •_•
*PHI:	Yes but  •_•
*JAN:	staked so much on that and we were, we were agreeing  •_•
*PHI:	Oh yes I know. •_•
*JAN:	that the reason he didn't sleep was because the fact that he was just sitting around all day. •_•
        So you wouldn't sleep  •_•
*PHI:	But they didn't  •_•
*JAN:	then your body doesn't need it. •_•
*PHI:	they didn't do it properly though. •_•
*JAN:	Oh! •_•
        That was the other thing she said, that he, he should have gone into hospital. •_•
*PHI:	Course he should. •_•
        He tried to do it at home and that was  •_•
*JAN:	They  •_•
*PHI:	ridiculous! •_•
*JAN:	did he have the opportunity to go into hospital to have it done? •_•
*PHI:	Erm, well the  •_•
*JAN:	I would have thought  •_•
*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	so because erm  •_•
*PHI:	I mean Paul said, with the blokes down in London and he, he gave them the pills and told them that they go back home and so he did. •_•
*JAN:	Yes but the, Julie said, and she's right of course, you can't have the erm  strength of drugs to, to, to administer at home because obviously •_•
*PHI:	It wasn't, it wasn't •_•
*JAN:	you've got to be monitored on that sort of thing. •_•
        You can't be put into  •_•
*PHI:	it wasn't done right. •_•
*JAN:	a deep drugs and not have erm  some medical staff  monitoring you. •_•
*PHI:	Yeah it sounds like you did a lot of work yesterday. •_•
*JAN:	I told you we I talked, I, I disturbed her all day long. •_•
*PHI:	Oh look! •_•
*JAN:	What? •_•
        Why is that? •_•
        What is it? •_•
*PHI:	Oh! •_•
*JAN:	I was going to say it was just something stuck on  the  •_•
*PHI:	It's I'll pick it up,if it  it was rust on the . •_•
*JAN:	No, no. •_•
        It, it, it  •_•
*PHI:	No, now that I've seen it. •_•
*JAN:	while I was sitting from here I could erm  see it had something stuck on it. •_•
*PHI:	The sheep seemed to have thinned out. •_•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •_•
        I think they must be up that other end cos there's about a couple of dozen yesterday I noticed. •_•
*PHI:	Only two down here. •_•
        They're not eating our hedge. •_•
*JAN:	No, see that one that's going up near where I planted granddad's honeysuckle? •_•
*PHI:	Mhm. •_•
*JAN:	They erm,they er   there was a lamb nibbling that yesterday and he's taken off,so the bits at the top and the bottom  have no connection any longer so •_•
*PHI:	Oh! •_•
*JAN:	It's not, I don't think that's granddad's honeysuckle. •_•
        I must go out and check it. •_•
*PHI:	I don't know where granddad's is. •_•
*JAN:	No, it's it's just down there. •_•
*PHI:	But that was a wispy one, granddad's was ever so big. •_•
*JAN:	No, granddad's  never really took off  •_•
*PHI:	With big leaves. •_•
*JAN:	because of the  of the drought. •_•
        When we were away it didn't get watered on. •_•
        I used to water it every day. •_•
*PHI:	Well everything looks as though it's had a good water now. •_•
*JAN:	All four lilac trees have taken anyway. •_•
        I want to check that the  •_•
*PHI:	Did I tell me when we got up to erm  Newcastle we turned on the local news, they'd had five inches of rain  which is a winter's rain in four days. •_•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •_•
*PHI:	The Metro station just down from  Gosforth Park er was flooded to platform level. •_•
*JAN:	Oh . •_•
        Like d'ya, do you remember Sheffield  •_•
*PHI:	And all the overheads were  •_•
*JAN:	flooded last year? •_•
*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
        And, and everywhere you went the fields  waterlogged  •_•
*JAN:	Actually standing in water. •_•
*PHI:	Standing in water all the way up. •_•
        Snow on the hills and everything. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*PHI:	But fortunately, you know, we, we only got  tail end of it, a bit of sleet. •_•
*JAN:	Whereabouts did you go yesterday? •_•
        You know you said  there was a bus coming at half past eight. •_•
        Where did  •_•
*PHI:	Erm  •_•
*JAN:	you go? •_•
        I couldn't  •_•
*PHI:	to  •_•
*JAN:	I couldn't quite imagine what you were doing. •_•
*PHI:	went round the erm  British Gas research establishment. •_•
*JAN:	Oh! •_•
        Was it was it very interesting? •_•
*PHI:	Amazing! •_•
        Amazing! •_•
        And  very impressed. •_•
        The  it's a massive place and, you know, five or six hundred staff, and erm, it's where they  develop all the new technology for the  gas fields  delivery of gas to your house and everything. •_•
        But you see they're spending a lot of the time  you know, on  developing ways of repairing roads after they've been in them. •_•
        And what's impressive is they're doing research that we should have been doing for years! •_•
        I mean, it's a bit much when the gas board is there showing us •_•
*JAN:	How to research   •_•
*PHI:	how, it's developed materials, it's developed techniques and everything for mending roads. •_•
        So  it's er  a bit humbling. •_•
*JAN:	So did you learn something? •_•
*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
        Quite a lot. •_•
        You see when the erm  legislation changes shortly, well the legislation is there but  when it's enacted  erm  they  they will become responsible for repairing after their own hole digging  and they have to provide us with guarantees. •_•
*JAN:	Certain standard and time to do it in. •_•
*PHI:	Yes, but I've, they've got to guarantee the repair for at least two years after they've done it. •_•
*JAN:	Ah I see. •_•
*PHI:	So, British Gas, the commercial, have worked out that there's only one way to do that, you do the job properly to start with. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*PHI:	And so, they're putting all the effort into doing it. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
        Well they  •_•
*PHI:	And er  •_•
*JAN:	don't wanna, amount of time of coming back again to do it haven't  •_•
*PHI:	It's  •_•
*JAN:	they? •_•
*PHI:	well that's lost money isn't it? •_•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •_•
*PHI:	So  no it was very impressive. •_•
        I'll  I think it's a bit much when you have highway engineers there and  really  they were showing us how it should be done. •_•
        And er  •_•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •_•
*PHI:	they proved, you know, some things, certain rollers and stuff that  we thought were useless, you know Paddy's dancing partner? •_•
*JAN:	Oh yeah . •_•
*PHI:	Erm  well we thought that was out of fashion. •_•
        They've shown that  if you run it at the right speed and stuff it's one of the most effective  methods of doing it  and erm  the ones we say are the nice little plate compactors which are  the best thing, they are useless in comparative performance so •_•
*JAN:	Mhm. •_•
*PHI:	er  no it was, good. •_•
        The money they spend on research! •_•
        I forget what it was, the turnover was erm  something like eight billion. •_•
        Or was it  no er it, probably eight hundred billion. •_•
        It was in some figure you can't even relate to. •_•
        So •_•
*JAN:	Well they must have a lot of money. •_•
        Isn't it British Gas' Chairman that's just had that enormous pay rise? •_•
*PHI:	Well I think most of them have. •_•
        Oh yes, but the Gas one has. •_•
        But I mean the  the standard of entertainment, I mean  put, putting  •_•
*JAN:	 ((clears throat)) 
*PHI:	us all in that hotel for •_•
*JAN:	Somebody was saying  rang in complained to Peter  about the, the amount of, what, what are they getting? •_•
        It's not, it's not quarter of a million is it? •_•
        It's about two hundred thousand. •_•
*PHI:	probably something like that. •_•
*JAN:	And Peter said well what would you consider  a reasonable salary for him? •_•
        And I thought he would say something like, you know something really silly, about fifty, sixty thousand, but he said  I think a hundred and fifty thousand's enough. •_•
        And, I thought well, it is really isn't it? •_•
*PHI:	Probably is. •_•
*JAN:	And for, for somebody who was ringing in, an ordinary person just complaining •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	I, I do think they have rather gone over the top. •_•
*PHI:	Well, there you are. •_•
        If you want to attract the right people and keep them you have to pay them money. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah but, don't, I'm sure there must be a lot of right people who will work for a hundred and fifty thousand. •_•
*PHI:	Probably not. •_•
*JAN:	Well •_•
*PHI:	The other thing that was interesting I learnt at dinner on  Thursday night is, under the  government's legislation within so many years, nineteen ninety four I think, they've got to have reduced their market share from the original hundred percent  to sixty percent  as new firms come in to  sell gas •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
*PHI:	Now, as the bloke said there, the only way you can do that with people coming in from the outside is that British Gas  have got to keep pushing their prices up to make it worthwhile for somebody else to come in. •_•
*JAN:	For the competition to get in. •_•
*PHI:	You can't just suddenly say well we're not gonna supply this quarter or something unless there's somebody coming in •_•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •_•
*PHI:	to do it. •_•
        To make it commercially attractive to somebody else British Gas have to got keep lifting their prices to a level, that eventually somebody comes in and says oh yes  •_•
*JAN:	It's worth my while   •_•
*PHI:	it's worth me having a go. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*PHI:	I asked them if once they'd got rid of the forty percent they could then get it back  by dropping the prices, you know, they've, they've  •_•
*JAN:	By, by competing. •_•
*PHI:	satisfied them legally? •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*PHI:	They weren't sure about that. •_•
        But, they, they thought they'd probably struggle. •_•
*JAN:	I thought, just assumed they would have known. •_•
*PHI:	Well,I'm not dealing with the marketing people was I? •_•
*JAN:	No. •_•
*PHI:	I was, dealing with the engineering people. •_•
        Right. •_•
        If you're clearing up I'll go upstairs  and er •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
        Yes, I think you're right . •_•
        Oh no, there's some more sheep sitting over there. •_•
        Under under that tree that is left. •_•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •_•
        Nothing from the insurance company was there? •_•
*JAN:	No. •_•
        Oh yes, I wonder •_•
*PHI:	You wonder what? •_•
*JAN:	I wonder what they've decided to •_•
*PHI:	Well  it's out of our hands. •_•
        It's just very important that  •_•
*JAN:	I hope you remembered to pick up those    discs last night. •_•
        I can't understand why he, I mean he had nothing to do with it. •_•
        And Lorna did her own sheet didn't she? •_•
        We, we did our own. •_•
        Didn't Lorna fill in her own sheet? •_•
*PHI:	Yes. •_•
*JAN:	So. •_•
*PHI:	Well they said it was me and Lorna. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*PHI:	Well I  that it was you. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
        But we've ended up with, they've got the prize and we're the ones who did it, who, who did it. •_•
        Who did do it. •_•
*PHI:	I'm not worried about it. •_•
*JAN:	Well it  •_•
*PHI:	I say it's a compact disc when you haven't got a compact disc player  •_•
*JAN:	When you haven't got a player  •_•
*PHI:	it er •_•
*JAN:	but neither have they, it's a, thing is this  •_•
*PHI:	it's a bit of a luxury. •_•
*JAN:	Well I thought I would use it as a raffle prize at school or something. •_•
        Give it straight back into something. •_•
        No use  •_•
*PHI:	Okay. •_•
*JAN:	to us, I can't see us  •_•
*PHI:	Anyway, I'll be down in a minute. •_•
*JAN:	can't see us ever having a compact disc player. •_•
*PHI:	No. •_•
        Dave. •_•
        Come on. •_•
        Get a move on this morning. •_•
*JAN:	Oh! •_•
        Phillip the tape's going . •_•
*CHR:	What? •_•
*PHI:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	Well I can't hold a conversation on my own. •_•
*PHI:	Why not? •_•
*JAN:	Well, I'm not very good at that sort  •_•
*PHI:	What? •_•
*JAN:	of thing. •_•
