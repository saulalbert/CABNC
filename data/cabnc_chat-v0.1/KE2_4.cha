*HOL:	It was Friday the thirteenth at midnight, the moon was full and shining brightly. •232666_233275•
        Jane Hall had booked into the Riverside Hotel, she walked over to the reception desk and rang the bell, hello I'm Jane Hall I've booked a weekend stay here, ah yes Miss Hall if you would just like to sign here, here's your key, your room is six floors up, third on the right, have a nice stay. •233275_235315•
        She took the lift up to the sixth floor and came to the room one O nine, which was her room, as she entered she noticed cobwebs and dampness on the walls, she flung her bed, bags on the bed and went downstairs to supper, after her supper she went to report, she went to the reception desk to report the cobwebs and dampness, she rang the bell a few times but no one answered, she was just about to go back to her room when she heard Mr Sandy the receptionist in the back room talking to her assistant, I put the body in Miss Hall's wardrobe, Jane ran upstairs and sure enough there was a body, Jane rang the police then straight away, please could you come to the Riverside Hotel, there's something I think you should see, there was a knock at the door and Mr Sandy answered it, hello, oh hello we've just had phone call from here, are you sure this is the right hotel? •235315_241232•
        Yes, well I didn't call, but I did said Jane, well you leave, well I'll leave you to it said Mr Sandy, if you would come upstairs, the policeman and Jane entered her room, please look in the cupboard, I think we've got a case Sarge, do you mind if I make a quick phone call? •241232_243337•
        Go ahead, hello is Sergeant Briggs there please, if you would just hold for a minute, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, hello this is Sergeant Briggs who's calling? •243337_244336•
        Sergeant it's P C Garfield, Sergeant Huddersfield and myself are at the Riverside Hotel, we've just found a body in Miss Hall's wardrobe room one O nine, well could you describe him? •244340_245584•
        He's about six foot two, short black hair, moustache, blue eyes and according to his record card he's twenty seven and his name is John Banks and he lives at 36 Church Hill Road, Upper Tracey, and we think he's been shot, I'll be right over, stay where you are. •245584_247558•
        About fifteen minutes later Sergeant Briggs entered Jane's room, we'll take him back to the station and tomorrow we'll go around and ask a few questions. •247567_248377•
        Oh by the way Miss Hall do you know anything, said P C Garfield, well said Jane I wasn't going to tell, but I think Mr Sandy and their assistant knows something about it, because about twelve thirty this morning I was going to report about the cobwebs and dampness on the walls and I heard Mr Sandy and his assistant talking in the back room. •248377_250449•
        Well just that they had put the body in my wardrobe, that's a start thanks. •250449_250724•
        The next day the policeman went where Mr Banks lived and they rang the bell, hello, hello are you Mrs Banks? •250724_251306•
        Yes, yes I am. •251306_251335•
        Well we've got some bad news about your son John, oh I think you'd better come in. •251335_251635•
        Well what have you got to tell me about John? •251635_251756•
        I'm afraid, I'm afraid, no, I am very sorry to tell you this but your son has been murdered said Sergeant Briggs, murdered, but how? •251757_252366•
        He was shot, John my poor John, what am I going to tell his wife? •252366_252714•
        He was married? •252718_252749•
        Yes to a Mrs Stow before, I'm sorry we have to tell you like this, anyway do you know why he came to the hotel? •252749_253343•
        Yes he had booked there for a week, I think it was for a business meeting with Mr Sandy, that's all I know. •253343_253945•
        Mr Sandy, are you sure said P C Garfield? •253945_254071•
        Yes he's the receptionist there isn't he? •254071_254169•
        Yes he is, you've been a lot of help, thanks. •254170_254395•
        At midday Sergeant Briggs and P C Garfield went back to the Riverside Hotel to talk to Mr Sandy. •254395_254915•
        Do you know anything about Mr Bank's death said Sergeant Briggs? •255038_255300•
        No, yes you do, don't lie, I heard you yesterday morning, twelve thirty, you were talking to your assistant in the, about you put the body in my wardrobe said Jane, okay I know something, in fact I know a lot more than all of you. •255300_256481•
        I know who did it. •256481_256536•
        Who said P C Garfield? •256540_256606•
        Ah but that would be telling, just tell us said Jane, you really want to know don't you? •256606_257055•
        Look stop playing games and tell us said Sergeant Brigg, okay it was me said Mr Sandy. •257055_257366•
        I could of guessed said P C Garfield, but why? •257366_257493•
        Well I was having an affair with his wife and I loved her so much I wanted to marry her, I wanted his land and his money, so I thought if he was out of the way it would be easier to get what I wanted and of course it was. •257493_258293•
        I hope you know how many years you'll get for this said P C Garfield, of course I do I'm not stupid. •258297_258779•
