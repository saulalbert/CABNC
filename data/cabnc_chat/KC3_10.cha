*YVO:	Yes, yes. •92015_93185•
*FRE:	and I'm seeing the surgeon today and erm  and I met somebody the other day who'd had it done and his fingers weren't affected, you know, so I mean it's just the luck of the draw I think. •93185_106505•
        However  I thought well I'm, I'm er •108625_111905•
*YVO:	Mind you it does look better than when I saw it last. •111945_113755•

        Oh. •136195_136225•
*YVO:	Oh right  hope the surgeon might be able to provide you with  •136225_140745•
*FRE:	Mm well  I, I mean really I want him to tell me  I mean she implies that I'm gonna get, you know, back  fully back to normal but  I  I'm beginning to wonder myself •143665_160985•
*YVO:	Mm. •161225_161575•
*FRE:	er I, I mean I really can't doubt her but erm, you know, you, how you have hunches. •161775_167595•
*YVO:	Yeah. •167595_167655•
*FRE:	I feel as though I'm on a plateau at the moment although when I said that she said well  it is getting better so the  •168205_176445•
*YVO:	There's a physio. •176835_177305•
        Trish   I've got a patient for you Trish if you've got five minutes to spare please. •177305_187355•

*TRI:	Oh great! •190935_191355•

*YVO:	This is Fred, he used to, he used to work in   •197925_201255•
*FRE:	Hello. •201285_201405•
        contracture. •201995_202425•
*TRI:	Is that what you've got? •202495_205705•
*FRE:	no, I've had it. •205705_206595•
*YVO:	He's had an operation. •206655_208145•
*FRE:	Mm. •208995_209305•
*YVO:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	No no, I won't say that. •211065_212245•
        Operation the sixth of December  on the little finger  er and my other fingers swelled up  •214235_224165•
*TRI:	Mm. •225285_225475•
*FRE:	and are still not down. •226515_228555•
        Really what I'm wanting you to tell me is how normal is that and •232255_237555•
*TRI:	To be honest I'm not, I erm  not quite sure really. •238405_242015•
        I mean have, have you been back to, to, to clinic following   •242015_245765•
*FRE:	Oh yeah yeah yeah. •245795_246375•
        Well I had it done on the insurance you know  •246575_251425•
*TRI:	Right yeah. •251425_251585•
*FRE:	so I'm seeing the surgeon again today •252395_254145•
*TRI:	Are you? •254145_254245•
        You  •254505_254565•
*FRE:	but of course he's the one who's done it •254565_255925•
*TRI:	Mm. •255925_256025•
*FRE:	so even if he sort of made a, a bodge, I'm not suggesting he has  he's not likely to, to  say yes that's because of that. •257085_263685•
*TRI:	So is the finger better then? •263685_264675•
        I mean •264675_265385•
*FRE:	Well  erm it, oh well I mean it is better in as much as it was sticking out like that •265385_271845•
*TRI:	Mm. •271845_271935•
*FRE:	and I can  whereas I  couldn't get a glove on now I can now. •272225_275245•
*TRI:	Right. •275245_275375•
*FRE:	I haven't got all that much movement. •275835_277855•
*TRI:	Yeah. •278955_279015•
*FRE:	Well you know I mean it's not too bad I suppose. •279015_281065•
*TRI:	No I'd just be, I mean I must admit I've, I've not really seen one for years and years and years. •282155_288495•
        You get quite sort of specialized. •288655_289995•
        I think  •289995_290405•
*FRE:	Yeah quite. •290525_291215•
*TRI:	undoubtedly I think you need to ask him, you know, that erm just say to him that you're very concerned about the fingers •291215_296985•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •296985_297125•
*TRI:	and, you know, what can, what can  do about it. •297125_300185•
*FRE:	Now the physio, I'm I'm having the, I'm having physio •300185_302955•
*TRI:	Yeah. •303135_303295•
*FRE:	and I was just saying to Yvonne er I'm rapidly running out of my physio allowance, you know, because of the amount that  •304035_311075•
*TRI:	Yes, yeah, yeah perhaps you're not  •311075_312015•
*FRE:	she's doing erm and she seems to imply that er it will get back to normal but, you know, I  I just, I'm not er happy about that myself. •312015_323425•
*TRI:	Well I would have thought so but really erm I think you just need to sort of  •324095_328135•
*FRE:	I, I, I mean it really has been swollen and er inflamed  •328725_332465•
*TRI:	So it's down a bit? •332465_332735•
*FRE:	Oh yes. •333135_333575•
*TRI:	Yeah. •334375_334515•
*FRE:	Oh yes, yes yes yes. •334515_335685•
        Oh yes and I had er pressure sores, you know? •336535_340295•
*TRI:	Mm. •340295_340355•
        Yeah, no I think you just need to be frank with him and you know say  you're happy about the finger, fine, but just, you know, •343055_349675•
*FRE:	I'm more concerned about these •349935_351115•
*TRI:	Yeah. •351115_351215•
*FRE:	because these were okay  •351215_352315•
*TRI:	Right •352455_352565•
*FRE:	than, than this. •352745_353695•
*TRI:	Yeah, well no I would be direct with him and say, you know •354345_357455•
*FRE:	Yeah. •357455_357525•
*TRI:	you're really worried about these •357525_358665•
*FRE:	Yeah. •358665_358745•
*TRI:	and, and just see, sort of see what, what he says really •358745_362445•
*FRE:	Mm. •362445_362505•
*TRI:	and if you're having physio that's, that's good but like you say   •362795_367435•
*YVO:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	No I mean I, I don't know how much. •368675_370375•
        It, the bill was hundred and thirty eight quid last month  and it'll be more than that this month and I think my yearly allowance is about three hundred, you know, so I'm rapidly running out. •370625_380695•
        Anyway thanks for your, no no  •381225_384975•
*TRI:	Sorry I can't really sort of say I must admit I couldn't really see why they should be like that really cos I mean it is a bit puzzling cos if they've only just done anything, they've only been tampering with this finger so  •384975_395175•
*FRE:	The, the, the the other thing er I, I have the feeling in this finger of, not pins and needles, but just a slight difference he's obviously cut some nerves I should imagine. •395175_405655•
        But er you know I'm, as I say, I'm more concerned about those  •406795_410385•
*TRI:	How annoying. •410385_410605•
        But I must admit I haven't seen I haven't seen, you know it's years well it'll be years   •410715_423095•
*FRE:	You see what what I'm up against is, I mean the physio who, who, I mean she's private of course  •423255_427865•
*TRI:	Mm. •428455_428515•
*FRE:	she is one wanting er referrals from Mr  so she's not going to say oh well you know there's something wrong there, you know? •429085_436069•
*TRI:	Mm. •436069_436129•
*FRE:	Is she? •436999_437269•
*TRI:	No. •437709_437769•
*FRE:	You see. •438159_438509•
        Er er and er  I'm not saying that there is necessarily, but even if there was she's not going to because she wants to preserve her, her referrals. •439079_448139•
        Don't want me   •449229_449709•
*TRI:	Well I'd just say you're really worried about these fingers •449739_452449•
*FRE:	Yeah. •452469_452529•
*TRI:	and that, you know,and you just say, you know  you know, what, what are you  gonna do about this  •452699_459659•
*FRE:	Yeah. •459889_459949•
*TRI:	you know, should it, should it actually be like  •459949_461809•
*FRE:	Yeah. •462129_462189•
*TRI:	Then if you get some answers then you can always say to him well this is what, you know, this is what  •462279_467249•
*FRE:	Yeah well I mean I saw him what, either a fortnight or three weeks ago, three, probably about three weeks, and at that stage my plaster that I'd had on after the er op had only been off perhaps a fortnight, it was Christmas intervening you see, so he had every sort of right to say, you know, oh well yeah  it should be okay, yeah. •467249_505899•
*TRI:	Think the only thing you can do is as I say be honest and say that, you know, you're very worried about your fingers •506719_518089•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •518089_519109•
*TRI:	I know it's not a lot of help but erm •519319_521129•
*FRE:	No well you, you •521129_522149•
*TRI:	I'm, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to say whether it was  or not so  •522149_527749•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, well that, that's fine, that's all I wanted to know, I'm pleased you popped in,it  •528209_534099•
*TRI:	Sorry   •534299_534579•
*FRE:	yes but it's sort of erm •534579_535929•
*TRI:	Even if it's only to give you the confidence you know  •536599_539999•

*TRI:	to sort of  •540679_540859•

*TRI:	It's awful I , I'm the same if I'm going to see a doctor, I think ooh •541519_552049•
*FRE:	Well when you've got  •552049_552879•
*TRI:	you forget what you were going to ask   •552879_556309•
*FRE:	Yes but when you've been, when you've been in the work as I have over many years with doctors, I was a mental welfare officer so I mean I know  er, you know, you can be fobbed off. •556339_565749•
*TRI:	That's right. •565969_566259•
        No go for it. •566259_567149•
*FRE:	Right. •567229_567389•
*TRI:	Well I hope it is  but they're not good are they? •568059_571449•
*FRE:	Well if that, •571589_572019•
