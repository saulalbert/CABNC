        They were winning three nil  three two at the end of it. •243437_243832•
        Oxford scored one on the end   •243832_243913•
*BAR:	Not many first division teams left is there? •243913_244112•
*HUG:	Nine. •244118_244128•
*BAR:	About  nine is there? •244382_244553•
*HUG:	Wrexham were unlucky against Blackburn. •244553_244689•
*BAR:	Oh! •244774_244796•
        Weren't they? •244796_244838•
        Didn't they play well? •244838_244909•
*HUG:	Yes! •244930_244945•
        They've always been a  •244945_244980•
*BAR:	I thought they played  •244980_245043•
*HUG:	good club side  Wrexham. •245043_245132•
*BAR:	Yeah, they have but I mean, they got a lot of good skilful young lads haven't they? •245132_245460•
        They're only like nineteen and twenty  •245460_245623•
*HUG:	Yeah. •245625_245636•
*BAR:	and  I mean that young fullback looked brilliant! •245636_245824•
        That  •245951_245957•
*HUG:	Yeah. •246046_246058•
        Mm mm. •246058_246185•
        Quite good. •246192_246216•
        Composed as well like. •246223_246891•
        Talented. •246892_246893•
*BAR:	Yeah. •246893_246897•
        It's a funny law that er  clear chance at goal job innit? •246897_247319•
        I mean it's a  funny definition. •247320_247942•
        I must admit I, I  if you could stop that deliberate foul it's  I mean it's better for the game if you can stop it. •247942_248913•
*HUG:	Send them off. •248947_249043•
*BAR:	Yeah. •249044_249045•
        Yeah. •249045_249061•
        That's right. •249079_249099•
        I mean if you're gonna do it  •249099_249172•
*HUG:	Yeah. •249172_249183•
*BAR:	do it, do it, do it  •249193_249558•
*HUG:	Yeah. •249579_249623•
*BAR:	consistently. •249623_249641•
        Cos, actually, the other thing about defenders hauling people down like that, you know, how many times when a forward's through one on one on a goal keeper does he score? •249641_250277•
        It's not that often actually. •250277_250383•
*HUG:	No. •250383_250414•
*BAR:	I mean, okay, somebody like Besty  •250444_250565•
*HUG:	Thing you want  •250565_250601•
*BAR:	you could bet on •250601_250656•
*HUG:	Yeah. •250656_250671•
*BAR:	nine times out of ten, but  •250671_250765•
*HUG:	But even, even against the goalkeeper they fucking lose fifty percent of the, like  •250765_251019•
*BAR:	Yeah. •251019_251041•
*HUG:	I was saying  more than fifty percent of the playing  •251041_251162•
*BAR:	Yeah, I would, yeah. •251162_251381•
        Yeah. •251381_251391•
        Yeah. •251392_251393•
*HUG:	And that's all just  one on one on the goalkeeper. •251393_251832•
*BAR:	Yeah. •251833_251834•
        Well that's what I mean, I mean, you know,the player could let him, could let him go really without deliberately fouling him because  it's, it's gonna  •252178_252864•
*HUG:	Half the  •252877_252916•
*BAR:	be at least a fifty fifty •252916_253113•
*HUG:	Yeah. •253113_253119•
*BAR:	chance that the goalkeeper's gonna save it innit? •253119_253917•
*HUG:	It's fucking gotta be straight like that, I, I, I don't fucking  taking off three points for a   . •253917_254623•
        At the start it seemed to improve the matches but it, they've just become too hectic now I think. •254623_254976•
*BAR:	Mm. •255081_255098•
*HUG:	You know, there's not as much skill involved as there was. •255099_255323•
*BAR:	No. •255324_255325•
        No, that's right. •255325_255468•
        It's •255468_255525•
*HUG:	Like the •255525_255550•
*BAR:	incredibly passed. •255550_255573•
*HUG:	the first, the first season like the football did seem to improve but it's not •255573_255855•
*BAR:	That's right. •255855_255916•
*HUG:	gonna go back now I think. •256484_256942•
*BAR:	United have got a strange side at the moment though  •256942_257095•
*HUG:	Oh yes. •257095_257112•
*BAR:	I mean I don't think you can  it's alright having all these players but if you  he doesn't seem  •257112_257503•
*HUG:	They don't play. •257503_257542•
*BAR:	he doesn't seem to  •257542_257601•
*HUG:	They  •257601_257639•
*BAR:	have an idea of what he wants. •257639_257730•
        Cos I mean  •257730_257776•
*HUG:	No they don't. •257777_257833•
*BAR:	every week he's got a different sort of format. •257834_258115•
*HUG:	Well what's he supposed to do? •258115_258329•
        Giggs, Semen . •258329_258344•
*BAR:	Well he had him  •258344_258547•
*HUG:	Well I think he's gotta look at, and the team should be in with you  •258547_258753•
*BAR:	Yeah. •258753_258776•
*HUG:	like. •258776_258787•
*BAR:	He had him playing yesterday, er, but they dropped Hughes. •258787_259110•
*HUG:	Yeah I know . •259117_259158•
        Well you don't drop Hughes for anybody! •259159_259263•
*BAR:	And his two subs, Hughes and Sharp, I mean it does rather hamstring  •259263_259533•
*HUG:	Yeah. •259540_259563•
*BAR:	you if anything happens to a central defender dunnit? •259563_259923•
*HUG:	Yeah. •259923_259930•
        Well I don't think Hughes should ever be sub like, he should be on the team. •259931_260255•
*BAR:	Well that's right, even if he's not scoring goals he's creating so much pressure and, and  •260255_260629•
*HUG:	Yeah, he always done like. •260629_260762•
        Good in defence as well. •260770_260792•
*BAR:	Yeah. •260936_260945•
        That's right. •261041_261066•
        Well he's also summat, er I mean he's, he's one of the best  at holding a ball  you know  •261066_261493•
*HUG:	Fantastic shielding the ball  •261493_261530•
*BAR:	on his own. •261537_261656•

*HUG:	I know. •263440_263452•
*BAR:	it was a  it was full pass inside to two fullbacks  er, for the  Southampton player that was running on  this fullback shaded it away  you know, guiding him out of it, he's running to the Smeichel came out to the edge of the area  but he was like right on the edge  as the player was coming to him, so he just let it roll a little bit further, he stopped it with his foot, the guy came and tackled him off  got it  instead of just picking it up with his hand, I mean he was actually in the area but like  he was right on the edge and he took a step back  •263452_266142•
*HUG:	Why the fuck didn't he  •266159_266230•
