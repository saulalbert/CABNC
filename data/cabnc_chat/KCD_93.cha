*NON:	Well it seems to me, if you cut it, if you put that one there, then this other piece, it'll use to do in there.
*HEL:	What other piece?
*NON:	Well, if we cut a piece round there.
*HEL:	Yeah.
*NON:	And the other piece that we got could do that one, that piece in there.
*HEL:	Ah, you not, yes, alright.
*NON:	Ok   (.)  (        ) .
*HEL:	Well I mean half a bottle to do the top and the down, you can do that bit, measure if you like.
*NON:	Yeah, ok, if you can measure it, then I can cut off. (        ) . ((cutting wall paper)).
*HEL:	Can't tell whether that's going to reach or not.I don't think it is, I think, no, I think you've got to come down another pattern.Oh that one down then  (        ) .
*NON:	Got what you want?
*HEL:	Yeah.
*NON:	 (        ) .
*HEL:	Couldn't really see in the corner whether it was going, so tight.Shall I go and get the other scissors out of the   (.) cut the right side.
*NON:	Yes.
