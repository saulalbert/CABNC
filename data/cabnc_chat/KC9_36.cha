@Comment:	conversation #36 (Tape 014502)
*UNK:	I thought really done all   (        ) haven't done all that much, cos I was alone most of the time
*KEI:	Mm, mm.
*GIN:	The   (        ) make you, sort of what were doing when   (        ) making   (        ) another member of staff, so there's a   (        ) going on full time    (.)  (        ) having free coffee like Dinda did, much   (        ) change it to be  (        ) , but I mean it's just there for free, all day every day, she's now   (        ) ten penny piece in, they get a card, get a little pin pricked on, every time they used it up to twenty they get twenty cups of coffee on its card
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	no, they loose it so of course they have to go and buy another card  (        ) .Every time I do the laundry I bet there's a coffee machine card in there, shirt pocket, there's two there this morning.
*KEI:	Oh I guess that, that means that's all right when it, did you    (        )  (        ) coffee machine  (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) seventeen thousand pounds if he gave them a free cup of coffee.
*KEI:	Well he, he, he   (        ) given them a free cup of coffee it'll be alright, but he didn't, he gave, the machine took ten P pieces so he provided them with the ten P pieces to put in and then when it was full up he'd empty it out and give them all ten P pieces back
*GIN:	So he was given them coffee.
*KEI:	So he was, for it was, it was a perk, or something like that, (        ) I, I couldn't really understand what they, they were getting at .
*GIN:	I couldn't understand it either.
*KEI:	I thought that was absolutely  (        ) .
*GIN:	To charge him I mean, somebody gets a company car
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	the tax man charges him, who is, who's got the use of the company car
*KEI:	Yes, yes.
*GIN:	doesn't charge the boss
*KEI:	No, that's right, mm.
*GIN:	Well I think   (        ) expenses I'd should imagine that's written off against it.
*KEI:	Well he, he said if they, if, if, some, get a visitor in and I give them a cup of coffee well that's all right, but   (        ) I don't know if it's money or, or like maybe, maybe  (        ) .
*GIN:	But it seems to me   (        ) it's the person, people drinking the coffee who are getting the perk, therefore they should have twenty pounds a year added for   (.) free coffee providers
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	worth twenty pounds a year or whatever it is worth 
*KEI:	Well he   (        ) he was saying that, that the boss was the one that provided the money that the chap was  (        ) .
*GIN:	So he, that was definite, yeah.
*KEI:	If he was given them tokens or something like that, it would of been alright, but I, I, I   (        ) a couple of weeks ago 
*GIN:	Perhaps now they're not doing it then .
*KEI:	I've forgotten the details on it .
*GIN:	Well imagine what Panasonic are going to own
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	giving out those great big blocks of  (        ) , all getting as much as  (        ) .
*KEI:	Well, this, this is   (        ) a lot of people, of er to erm  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh I  (        ) .
*VIC:	 (        ) he, he was sort of on loan to another company
*GIN:	Mm.
*KEI:	and they say   (        ) film industry department, Wakefield somewhere got John's name out of the blue, so that, don't know anything else about it because he's, he's always been seen by you know , this, this other company, and he got three tax   (        ) eighty seven, eighty eight, eighty eight, eighty nine, ninety, and one what, were the estimate was twenty five thousand pounds, and five thousand pounds
*GIN:	Yes , and he hadn't even earned that had he?
*KEI:	 [laughing] not a chance, he, he never even earned that much money in all his   ((laugh))  [] , no but I mean having, having had the income tax done that to you   (        ) however ridiculous that it is you've got to do something about it
*GIN:	 (        ) , yeah
*KEI:	and having been sort of helping  (        ) 
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*KEI:	The   (        ) finally he decided what   (        ) he had to right back to say, you know, I, I, tell you this is how much I've earned
*GIN:	Yeah
*KEI:	this is how much tax I've paid, this is, I mean if you go on the dole too unless you've made a note of it there is no record of how much you've been paid on the dole, they, they give John the what he calls a giro, takes it to the bank and cashes it and there is no, no record of   (        ) and when he's been on the dole.I mean he's got plenty of   (        ) every single bit of papers that they're given all the time.
*GIN:	Yeah , but the D S S must have it, (        ) .
*KEI:	Well I, I don't know how keen they are on giving them out, just  (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*KEI:	Actually it was lucky for us because when John rang up   (.) the
*GIN:	For his firm.
*KEI:	for his firm, erm, he said   (        ) I'll, I will see to it, which she's doing at the moment but  (        ) , but erm, I don't know how far
*GIN:	At least it's got an end now with the others if he's on the film company, he's got an end now hasn't he now he's got   (        ) .
*KEI:	Yes I suppose so, but I feel sorry for Simon cos you see John and Geoff they can both go on the dole but Simon's is  (        ) .The   (        ) or, or anything so at the moment  (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*KEI:	Any way the thing is erm, I hope   (        ) only have a   (        ) 
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*KEI:	What he's, he's earns, er pay tax on everything he's earned
*GIN:	Yeah
*KEI:	never had a   (        ) not for all the things   (        ) 
*GIN:	No, no 
*KEI:	and er, he's been on the dole admittedly he did go on the dole   (        ) If you're on the dole for part of the year, your own salary is   (        ) do they add your dole money to the salary, charge you tax on that ,
*GIN:	Oh yes, oh not half 
*KEI:	you see so I think,
*GIN:	not half 
*KEI:	I said to Paddy I think that they do that John will owe, owe them some money cos he'll owe them tax from all the doles  (        ) .
*GIN:	he can't tell them how much it is?
*KEI:	Because er, I don't know whether
*GIN:	Oh well that   (        ) signature for it every time and it goes on his file every one has a file .
*KEI:	Well I hope so , because he's been when he went  (        ) 
*GIN:	Huh.He didn't get very much  (        ) .
*KEI:	So I, I don't think it's finished yet somehow, he don't seemed worried about it   (        )  (.) 
*GIN:	It seems that they chase somebody like John who, at the outside may end up after five years owing them perhaps a hundred to two hundred pounds
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	and yet people like the Maxwell board
*KEI:	Yeah, yeah.
*GIN:	millions involved and other people who are running dodgy companies
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	going bankrupt and then starting up another company in another name
*KEI:	Mm, mm
*GIN:	which I don't think should be allowed, go right themselves off and leave lots of people that they owe money to and can't get it, they get threatened 
*KEI:	That's right and then they go and start again 
*GIN:	in the   (        ) or something, it's   (        ) some of them are   (        ) all over again, start them off of course.
*KEI:	 (        ) that everybody without jobs  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh the people that took over the  (        ) .
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	Ever such a charming family, (        ) green grocers   (        ) nice enough people they have next door
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	he said and I got on very well with them, have a chat and I used to help them when they came in   (        ) they were West Indians which gave everybody a bit of a shock when   (        ) running a local Spa
*KEI:	Yes.
*GIN:	 (        ) , but erm, (        ) and I notice that quite often the shelves would be half empty, (        ) came here, I would stop on the way back from the school   (        ) the bank and the butcher's and the paper shop over the road I could come in quarter to nine and I'm, you know, I, I was done and I said to my Arnold they're not going to sell much unless they put some money into filling the shelves surely Spa will back them, and he said I keep on telling them that I keep on saying to them if you don't put the goods there on display people are going to go over the road to Lipton's and   (        ) and
*KEI:	Mm, mm.
*GIN:	eventually they went bankrupt, Florrie is an   (        ) of mine, she used to work there part time and she always enjoyed it, she's been there say twenty years  (        ) , she just came back from holiday and found the place is closed down and none of for the past er fifteen months he'd been there, that past fifteen months none of their part time staff had their stamps put on their cards, so for their, for their pension 
*KEI:	 (        ) yeah ,
*GIN:	they've, they've got to put their National, National Ins Insurance stamps, erm, none of the Tax that they'd stopped from their wages had been paid to the tax man, so apparently there was   (        ) I don't see how they've already paid their employer ,
*KEI:	they   (        ) ,
*GIN:	it was P A Y E, (        ) not  (        ) .
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Yeah, (        ) but people can do it even in a little way
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	little local people, part time housewifes earn a bit extra to pay their mortgage or save up to go on holiday
*KEI:	Yes.
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Yeah.
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Not very fair is it?
*KEI:	No it's not  (.) 
*GIN:	How that coffee machines   (        ) any, any old machine   (        ) well it's a small office, maybe a bigger offices have the vending machine, but every office will have a machine.I've usually been, been senior secretary, I've usually been the one in charge of the petty cash, which, sent out for proper coffee and the new kettle if the kettle blew it's fused and the and the tea pot and the tea bags and the, I just used to write a note in the, in the cash book
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	and cash back in the box of the petty cash
*KEI:	Yes.
*GIN:	if I needed any I, I used to ask my boss or phone up head office and say petty cash is getting a bit low I've used a lot of stamps last week, they'd send me up a cheque and  (        ) , never any question of they've provided us with tea and the pint of milk I use, I, I'd bring it in with me or ask the   (        ) 
*KEI:	 (        )  (.) I suppose that they  (        ) 
*GIN:	Yes, yes, ten minutes office time spent in the loo, mm   (.)  (        ) 
*KEI:	Yeah might be   (        ) strong  (        ) .
*GIN:	You see the leaves in our garden, imagine 
*KEI:	 ((laugh)) 
*GIN:	can't you with all those trees up the top, I give up on it.
*KEI:	Ah.
*GIN:	I saw a gadget the other day that's two, two plastic circles with handles on, mm, I think I paid about seven pounds and this was to gather up leaves and big lot of
*KEI:	Mm, mm.
*GIN:	look at it, it's   (        ) isn't it?
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	What I'll do pay out extra for two bits of plastic.
*VIC:	 (        ) that was a good idea if you can borrow next door's dustbin   (        ) your own you'd narf get a lot of leaves up
*GIN:	You would.
*VIC:	you'd carry them quite safely round the corner or whatever you want, but I  (        ) .
*GIN:	Most of my leaves drop down and fall in the borders
*VIC:	 (        ) soil
*GIN:	Yes, yes. (        ) 
*VIC:	Every time I think about it I'm either too busy or the weather's too rotten, when I'm not tired the weather's pouring with rain or bitterly cold or  (        ) .Did I tell you where we planted the
*GIN:	You did, did you?
*VIC:	We did, yes, (        ) the two Rhododendron behind the   (        ) and put them on the   (        ) outside 
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	and then put the two bushes over there, the Mallow and the other one.
*GIN:	oh great, great feel happier now.
*VIC:	The, the last one that I bought was going to be easy, but oh  (        ) .
*GIN:	So you should have space for something sweet smelling outside those big patio doors 
*KEI:	That's right, I want some Lavender and Azalea and stuff like that, now   (        ) 
*GIN:	 (        ) , yes that sort of stuff.
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Mm.
*KEI:	 (        ) evening, I used to go up there   (        ) and er  (        )
