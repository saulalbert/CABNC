*DAV:	Yes.That was the first one where Dot gets cold.
*JAN:	Mm.I like that book.I like the earlier stories better than the recent ones.
*DAV:	Mum.
*JAN:	I'm not, not so keen on those.I like the books, the original books that I had when I was a little rather than the new books.
*DAV:	Books of Thomas?
*JAN:	Yes.
*DAV:	Mm.
*JAN:	The pictures are nicer in those books.
*DAV:	But mum   (.) er

*DAV:	Well but 
*JAN:	children.
*DAV:	Mum.There was,the there were two they had that I had got.So er, they had   (        ) The Big Engine and I, I've read that so   (.) but the small railway engines.
*JAN:	Aha.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	 [yawning] Oh!I must stop yawning  [] .I wish I could   (.) I wish I had a bit more energy this morning.
*DAV:	Mum, this is only just a yard.
*JAN:	Yes, you've got it looking like the yard.Where are the engines now?You could do the turntable in front.Cos that's how it is in the book isn't it?When they  (        ) .Or facing that to go on the turntable.
*DAV:	Yes.And mum.
*JAN:	Mind your head lovey.You're very close 
*DAV:	You see the 
*JAN:	to that table.
*DAV:	have you noticed
*JAN:	Mm mm?
*DAV:	that   (.) you know erm all like tracks which lead into the sheds
*JAN:	 [yawning] Oh!Excuse me.Yeah  [] .

*JAN:	Yes.They've got  (        ) .
*DAV:	Mhm mm.Cos Gordon wanted to go to straight through this    (        )  (.) and th the turn table.
*JAN:	Can you think of another way of turning the engine without using the turntable?
*DAV:	Of course!
*JAN:	Can you?
*DAV:	I'll use, I'll use Duck.
*JAN:	Just demonstrate it for me.Mm mm.Have you ever seen an engine go on a coach like, kerb like that?
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	What was the shape we were talking about yesterday?
*DAV:	It's a triangle.
*JAN:	That's right.It's got a   (        ) curve on each end.Yeah?And what is the matter with that?That's it.And then it goes backwards.No actually it doesn't have a curve, it is a triangle but it's got a longer base hasn't it?It would extend so that it could just jump back.
*DAV:	Right.To there.
*JAN:	Mm.
*DAV:	Up to the top.
*JAN:	Then you can get an engine tuned without using the turntable   (.) these  (        ) .
*DAV:	Like
*JAN:	Cos James is pointing, it goes backwards.You've got engines facing in opposite directions.
*DAV:	Oh.Ha!
*JAN:	 ((yawn)) 
*DAV:	I'll walk. (.) Take one of these off mum. ((door slam))
*JAN:	Oh!That's daddy and Christopher back again.That didn't take them long did it?I hope they've got the bits now.I really ought to go and help them seeing as we're  (        ) .

*JAN:	 [laughing] Yes  [] .
*DAV:	in an exam.
*JAN:	You're nearly laughing aren't you?Yes, that's all we ever do.
*DAV:	But then when you got a ta  (.) th the new one is that when you've got the tape recorder on you go wo ho ho ho ho ho!
*JAN:	 ((laugh))  (.) Though sometimes, when they've been smashed into   (        ) and then I have to turn the other way, they go oh!Horror struck aren't they half the time.Somebody as asked to keep it.
*DAV:	Well
*JAN:	When James and Tara had it, d'ya remember?
*DAV:	Oh yes.And mum 
*JAN:	Well, that's just 
*DAV:	in the brake, in the brake van.
*JAN:	Oh that's the other one.Yes.
*DAV:	The brake van.The face was on the other end   (.) and it was looking really surprised.
