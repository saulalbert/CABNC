*JAN:	It looks very green now it's had all that rain.Have you blown your nose properly?Go and throw that one away and get me another one and I'll help you.
*DAV:	Mum.
*JAN:	And then you can come and tell me all about 
*DAV:	I ha 
*JAN:	your game.
*DAV:	I've had Duck for a long time.
*JAN:	Yes.Oh it's Donald and Douglas is, is, are those   (.) will you go and get those tissues sorted out please?
*DAV:	I've still got the two twins to get.Douglas 
*JAN:	Well 
*DAV:	and Douglas and Bill and Ben.

*JAN:	Now keep that in your pocket and keep that nose clean 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*JAN:	please.It's the only way to get rid of that cold.
*DAV:	My first engine in the Fat Controller's Railway was Thomas.
*JAN:	Yes that's right.
*DAV:	Then it was Edward, then Henry   (.) then Gordon, then James, then Percy .
*JAN:	Then Percy.Yeah.
*DAV:	Then Toby
*JAN:	Toby the Tram.And Henrietta   (.) the coach.
*DAV:	Then it was Duck.
*JAN:	Did we make a coach for, for Toby,Henrie can you buy Henrietta?
*DAV:	Yes you can buy them.
*JAN:	Do you want a Henrietta as well?
*DAV:	Oh yes please mum!Mum.
*JAN:	Yes?
*DAV:	If I had loads of room in   (        ) house I'd put them all together.Put them e behind Gordon.
*JAN:	Yes but, I don't think Gordon, it's only Thomas that really has any caravan, sometimes Percy isn't it?The, the   (.) larger engines, the express engines don't.Maybe James.
*DAV:	I thought er
*JAN:	Cos it's usually the er   (.) the tender engines don't   (.) pull   (        ) caravan do they?
*DAV:	Yes.
*JAN:	It's only the tankers isn't it?
*DAV:	But mum!Look   (.) you can't get the express coaches.
*JAN:	No.
*DAV:	But mum 
*JAN:	Why, why 
*DAV:	Mum.
*JAN:	I just think Tom's looking very battered.The cabs are very chipped.It's, I think you have to take a bit more care of those.Cos you will throw them at the back of the box instead of lining them up.D'ya remember how I got that box where you could lay them in   (.) separately?And of course you're not being very careful.You're not a very careful with your toys young man are you?
*DAV:	But mum
*JAN:	Mhm?
*DAV:	you, you ca you can get a bo you can get a set of, you can get a board for these to get room on   (.) so you 
*JAN:	Mhm.
*DAV:	Yeah.A big, a big board.
*JAN:	I don't think we really need that do we now?
*DAV:	No.Apparently it isn't a very big one.
*JAN:	Well, well you've got 
*DAV:	All over 
*JAN:	the board that you set out the Lego on, you could run those on that.That's taking up enough room 
*DAV:	It is 
*JAN:	we do I don't think we've got any more space.
*DAV:	The board's damaged from, cos that board's damaged beca  (.) from Duck, from Duck to Diesel.
*JAN:	D'ya know I'd forgotten it's got dirty beads on. (.) It's a long time since you've had this set out.
*DAV:	Ooh yes!
*JAN:	Well keep them all together this time.Or that'll get trod on.
*DAV:	Ooh!There's that  (        ) . (.) Got Thomas.
*JAN:	How come you've got two Thomas?Oh!Yo you bought another Thomas with Annie and Clarabel, is that 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*JAN:	is that the one?
*DAV:	I bought, we bought the Thomas second   (.) and then we 
*JAN:	Second one.
*DAV:	got one Thomas with Annie and Clarabel.
*JAN:	Mm. (.) Oh.
*DAV:	Mum.
*JAN:	Yes?
*DAV:	You know when we did gold paint on James'  (        ) ?
*JAN:	Yes.
*DAV:	It's red paint.
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*DAV:	Whoops.
*JAN:	Looks good in there. (.) They're not in the right pair are they?Unfortunately, the Fat Controller.
*DAV:	No they do come  (        ) .
*JAN:	Mm.Not actually, I think you can get different sizes can't you?Just those and erm   (.) small and that it's difficult to find, those are like the very small ones, they have a picture on there.Tt.
*DAV:	But mum
*JAN:	But I don't think the Fat Controller's supposed to be quite as nice is he?Are you finding they're not particularly  (        ) ?
*DAV:	Mine are all staying there.
*JAN:	Oh. (        ) .
*DAV:	 (        ) ?
*JAN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	You know these two they, cos they   (        ) set don't they?
*JAN:	They come together, yes.But I think you've   (.) got different sizes there.
*DAV:	Well, mum
*JAN:	And probably only bigger ones.
*DAV:	they came as the same   (.) they came in the same colour mu thing round them we in the red letters saying what they are.
*JAN:	Mm.The same packaging.
*DAV:	Yeah.Same package, package.
*JAN:	Mm mm.Cos you can get the bigger
*DAV:	Mm mm.
*JAN:	got the bigger Thomas haven't you?Got two of them the one that, that pushes one round.
*DAV:	Hey mum!You, you can get a toy the same as the Fat Controller there.
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*DAV:	A really big one, that big!They're that big.
*JAN:	Well I don't, I haven't seen one that size.
*DAV:	That big.
*JAN:	It's probably   (.) yes.Maybe a bit smaller.
*DAV:	No.Bu  (.) I think it's Fat Controller bubble bath.
*JAN:	 [laughing] Oh!I see what you mean  [] .
*DAV:	I think 
*JAN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	I think it is.Well I think it was made of a squidgy thing.
*JAN:	Now, I was only thinking this morning when I was in your bathroom   (.) you've got lots of bubble bath left over from Christmas.You've still got some left over from the year before, but people keep giving you it.
*DAV:	Mm.
*JAN:	Chrissy's still got that turtle bubble bath that he doesn't want anybody to use.And you've got the same one.And then er   (.) pots with the squidgy soap in.
*DAV:	Oh yeah!
*JAN:	And then there's another tall bottle that Wendy got you.You've still got the lot from last year that David and Wendy got you and you've 
*DAV:	You soap 
*JAN:	still got this year's.I think it's about time you used some of that.
*DAV:	I, I'm the only person who used the squidgy soap.
*JAN:	Didn't we have to stop using it because Chrissy was coming out in a rash?
*DAV:	 [laughing] No  [] .No.
*JAN:	And we didn't know what it was.
*DAV:	No because I was,ha because I had the diarrhoea.
*JAN:	Did you?
*DAV:	Yeah.That was the reason we that was when we stopped using the turtle stuff.
*JAN:	D'ya know, I don't know.
*DAV:	Mm mm.
*JAN:	Well we'll start using it again.Start using the stuff ta cos there's another big bottle in the cupboard as well in your bathroom.
*DAV:	Yes.
*JAN:	No point in saving it.You may as well use it.
*DAV:	Mm mm.Mum.
*JAN:	Yes?
*DAV:	You know of that music which goes with the engines?
*JAN:	Mm.
*DAV:	Well as soon as you know, knowing it too well.
*JAN:	 (        ) .Oh we must make sure on Tuesday we're home to record, what time is the   (        ) on?It starts at five to four doesn't it?I must get the tape lined up so that it's ready to switch on when we come home cos it's gonna be, walk home from school if it's a nice day, we'll, we'll have to hurry home.Cos we usually walk slowly don't we?So we're not getting home till about four o'clock.But if we, we erm
*DAV:	Hurry.
*JAN:	Well if it's, if it's   (.) if the weather's not very good I'll meet you in the car, but if it's a nice day I, I'd much rather walk to meet you.
*DAV:	But mum we did go in th the car.You said, it's erm   (.) at five past five.
*JAN:	No we, we walked and I, I got the time wrong didn't we?Cos we came in and Chrissy, instead of switching on the children's programmes put his computer on so we didn't see it.
*DAV:	Well we 
*JAN:	But of course it's five to four isn't it?It's the beginning of the programmes rather than the end.Never mind.We've only missed one.
*DAV:	Mum.
*JAN:	I hadn't even got the tape lined up ready to   (.) the next, the next one on.So I'll have to get it set up ready for when I meet you from school and then we can switch it on as soon as we get home.
*DAV:	Well that's what Chrissy did see.
*JAN:	Well we'll remember.The Tuesday after that we go on holiday, it's the Easter holidays.
*DAV:	Can you move your foot mum.
*JAN:	I'm sorry.
*DAV:	You're ri you're right on the railway.
*JAN:	I'm standing on the railway?Oh, I better move out the way, I might get squashed. (.) If we got this Monopoly game finished we could get this cleared up couldn't we?It's been going on a few days this game.I think Chrissy's got a   (.) although I'm not sure actually, you might win.You've got two sets haven't you?And quite a lot of money.Have you got houses   (.) on your set?Yes you have.You've got a house on  (        ) . (.) I started off quite well.I've got Mayfair   (.) Piccadilly, Fleet Street and Regent Street, but I never got a set did I?
*DAV:	Mum, how much, how much do you want for Fleet Street?
*JAN:	Well
*DAV:	Then I'll have just three sets.
*JAN:	Yes.If I land on   (.) something where   (.) I need some money.Chris has got quite a lot of, he's got Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road.Although, they don't cost much to buy though. (        ) a few houses on them.You can earn   (.) some money.So I might need, if I land on that I'll probably have to sell Fleet Street to be able to survive.And I think once I do that I shall have lost out because Chris has got Park Lane and he's not going to part with those. (.)  [yawning] So I don't think I'm going to do very well  [] .
*DAV:	Mum.
*JAN:	Yes?Mind 
*DAV:	The 
*JAN:	your head on the cupboard.
*DAV:	Mum, you know that's going pa round the   (        ) and passed   (.) that   (        ) there?
*JAN:	Yes.
*DAV:	That's the tunnel.
*JAN:	Oh I see, yes.That is
*DAV:	 (        )  (.) Mum.
*JAN:	Yes?
*DAV:	Er we  (.) you know I put it away to bring it out, out in here?
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*DAV:	Well   (.) when I was last playing with it   (.) that   (.) James kept on er   (.) in   (        ) and in    (        )  (.) that erm   (.) he stopped at the station and I have to take it   (.) like that   (.) far enough   (.) cos I wanted Gordon to be there   (.) so he co could pick up the express   (.) pick, up the coaches
*JAN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	and it's, I think I can set down.Right.
*JAN:	Oh I know what we used for the board.Do you remember that big puzzle   (.) that   (.) Barry  gave Chris?
*DAV:	Ah!
*JAN:	That's what we used.We used to put the fire engines in it as well.Do you remember it makes into a   (.) into a big road and it's got a   (        ) and a school, and factory and
*DAV:	It hasn't got a factory.
*JAN:	No?Got lots of things in it though.
*DAV:	It's got a  (        ) .
*JAN:	Mm mm.I was thinking you could put Thomas and the carriages in there.
*DAV:	And you can try everything on
*JAN:	And it isn't, it's not big enough to get all the engines on.
*DAV:	Is it big enough to put   (.) put, put Gordon on?
*JAN:	Well Gordon's a very big engine.
*DAV:	The biggest of all of the engines on the Fat Controller's Railway.He's the only   (.)  (        ) .He's the only  (        ) .
*JAN:	 (        ) specific.But, could do.
*DAV:	Yes.
*JAN:	The wheeler engines 
*DAV:	And then put 
*JAN:	Look, yes there's a four, six   (.) two 
*DAV:	Two.
*JAN:	other engines that we're not going to get

*JAN:	They do don't they?
*DAV:	Yes.And it's bad with this on lock.A three has, ordinary ones.
*JAN:	Yes, they have that
*DAV:	Like that.
*JAN:	slope on.
*DAV:	That's erm   (.) Scotsman.
*JAN:	Why has Scotsman  (        ) ? [whispering]  (        )  [] . Erm   (.) let me see, let's think of an example of an A four   (.) six.

*DAV:	No he banged it so he can't 
*JAN:	He banged it so that it would bend.He's very naughty.
