*ENI:	No, and of course the weeds will have a •_•
*MOL:	Yeah, they   •_•
*ENI:	a fine old time won't they? •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ENI:	Aha. •_•
        But your ground, I  imagine you've kept it fairly , free of weeds  for quite a  •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ENI:	time now? •_•
*MOL:	Erm  on our  some of our small plants  we don't use any erm  sprays or  •_•
*ENI:	No. •_•
*MOL:	we use erm  a rake  or a  and we draw across the seeds and  that'll  , bring out the weeds. •_•
*ENI:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	I done that  on my wheat this afternoon  erm  but we have to use fertiliser on ours cos  •_•
*ENI:	Mm. •_•
*MOL:	we don't have to sort of, ain't gotta take really too much muck •_•
*ENI:	Mm. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*MOL:	cos we do  half, we muck erm  I've grown pretty well •_•
*ENI:	Mm. •_•
*MOL:	so it gives the plants a boost •_•
*ENI:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	so we don't have too much muck so, and like  put some fertiliser on the other bits. •_•
*ENI:	I see. •_•
        Because, in fact, you can't put that compost  on the, or that muck on the, when you say muck, do you mean the compost that you make with the vegetables? •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ENI:	Yes. •_•
        Erm, you can't put that on till it's really broken down can you? •_•
*MOL:	No. •_•
*ENI:	So it's erm  you use up probably quite quickly what you've got. •_•
*MOL:	Yes, erm  all our  sort of cabbage stalks and  beans stalks go onto  the muck heap  to turn into a sort of compost, but  other people they just sort of burn  or take them away and buy a bag of compost. •_•
*ENI:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	But erm  bought bags of compost aren't so good  cos if you use all er, stuff you're growing you put erm  it back onto the ground •_•
*ENI:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*MOL:	what's come off the ground. •_•
*ENI:	Mm, yes. •_•
        Yes, it seems reasonable doesn't it, to put it all back? •_•
        It's all been natural stuff hasn't it? •_•
*MOL:	Yes. •_•
*ENI:	Aha. •_•
        Which bit of the gardening do you like best? •_•
*MOL:	Well erm  the best bit, I like harvesting, I don't like  the digging is alright but it hurt your back so  •_•
*ENI:	Yes. •_•
        You get  once you've done a lot you suddenly  •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ENI:	feel it don't you? •_•
        But the hoeing is nice and easy •_•
*MOL:	Yeah, okay. •_•
*ENI:	more or less. •_•

*MOL:	We got erm  various sorts of hoes. •_•

*MOL:	Yeah, but they smell! •_•
*ENI:	Oh, do they? •_•
*MOL:	Yeah, erm  when we're up the farm  when er, after a few days we put the feed in them they smell. •_•
*ENI:	Oh that's not nice is it? •_•
*MOL:	No, cos all the  plastic sort of •_•
*ENI:	Yes, that's because they've got a light on them isn't it? •_•

*ENI:	Aha. •_•
*MOL:	erm  when we've dug them up I  I didn't think they looked like carrots until we had  •_•
*ENI:	No. •_•
*MOL:	them. •_•
*ENI:	That's right they, and they must be a bit fiddly to peel mustn't they? •_•
        To scrape, rather. •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ENI:	Instead of a nice long scrape, you've got to go round corners haven't you? •_•
*MOL:	Yeah I keep, when I  I I always scrape the vegetables sometimes but when I do though I keep cutting my fingers! •_•
*ENI:	Ugh, yes, yes! •_•
*MOL:	So I gave them to dad to do. •_•
*ENI:	Ha! •_•
        What's the idea of those little carrots? •_•
*MOL:	I don't know. •_•
        Er  erm, there's only been  last year that I've grown them •_•
*ENI:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	so I don't know much about them yet. •_•
*ENI:	Did you like the taste of them? •_•
*MOL:	Yes they're, they're nice and sweet. •_•
*ENI:	Are they? •_•
        Mm. •_•
*MOL:	Erm  other carrots, erm they don't grow that well, I don't think so anyway. •_•
*ENI:	No. •_•
        Well there's so many things that get into carrots aren't there? •_•
        There's a , a wire worm or something? •_•
*MOL:	Yes erm •_•
*ENI:	And carrot fly. •_•

        Erm  leatherjackets, they're bad for them. •_•
*ENI:	Oh yes! •_•
        Mm. •_•
*MOL:	Erm  so when you sort of dig the ground up you have to chuck them out the way. •_•
*ENI:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	Cos they'll, they'll work their way back in. •_•
*ENI:	I'm sure. •_•
*MOL:	Start eating the  plants and that. •_•
*ENI:	The plants. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        That's why I say  nature works against you instead of with you. •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ENI:	So I don't bother! •_•
*NOE:	Don't you put any lime on them? •_•
*MOL:	Erm  well  we have tried it once  erm but  we put soot on them because they'll  •_•
*ENI:	Yes, soot is supposed to be good for something. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*MOL:	Erm, that will , that will stick to them and erm  they will  that will make them  feel ill so they  •_•

*MOL:	Yes. •_•
*ENI:	I've forgotten what they used to use soot especially. •_•
        My father used it, but I've forgotten what it was. •_•
*NOE:	Never use it on vegetables, around vegetables  to stop  insects creeping too. •_•
