*PS0BL:	Mm .  1386743_1386923
*PS0BK:	I am wondering actually what I should do about Helen See now I I would like to speak to her to check she 's alright But in doing so I 'd be telling her that I knew that it had happened and therefore that Simon had talked to me Or that I would have to say oh Simon told me and I do n't think that is a very good thing to do really Cos she 'd ask me how I 'd know It would n't be a case of oh Si Helen I 've heard on the grapevine would it Tell you who I might phone up in a minute .  1386923_1420623
*PS0BL:	Yeah .  1420723_1420943
*PS0BK:	Vanessa And not .  1421893_1423653
*PS0BL:	Vanessa and Dangerous .  1423653_1425303
*PS0BK:	And Dangerous yeah And not tell her that I know and wait for her to tell me .  1425303_1430233
*PS0BL:	That what are are they what are the the you know .  1430233_1431053
*PS0BK:	They 're fucking engaged .  1431183_1432383
*PS0BL:	Oh she did n't What .  1432863_1435243
*PS0BK:	That 's what I mean But if she says something to me about it I mean if she says something to me about it I 'm not gon na act surprised I 'll say oh yeah I 've heard .  1435243_1448733
*PS0BL:	Who told you .  1449133_1453713
*PS0BK:	Liz What should I s er what should would you be honest I mean I 'm not gon na say look I hate Dangerous I think he 's an absolute wanker and how can you marry someone who 's .  1453713_1461723
*PS0BL:	0 . 
*PS0BK:	uses the nickname Dangerous for fuck 's sake .  1461723_1463443
*PS0BL:	cos you could I mean if if she asked you about it you know you could just say well honestly I 'm quite I did n't think you were the kind of person who 'd go for I know I know that thing is I mean I can see I can see that she 's going for him because .  1463443_1476923
*PS0BK:	What I might actually do is say well I re if she does actually a I mean what she 'll probably do is say oh have you heard about me and Dangerous and I 'll say yes And she 'll say and that 's all I 'll say And I 'll say yeah yeah I 've heard And then if she says something like well what do you think I might just say well I have n't really talked to you very much about the way that you feel about Dangerous so I do n't really know erm Dangerous what a fucking stupid name And then if she says well and and then I might say but I just would imagine that you 'd have a lot more to do with your life before you thought about settling down and getting engaged to someone .  1476923_1516453
*PS0BL:	And also someone like him because I mean I mean er obviously he he seemed like a I mean I 'm sure he 's a nice guy er I mean when it comes down to it he probably is a nice guy he 's probably nice to her but it 's just the fact that he is so restricted in his views and .  1516453_1528913
*PS0BK:	It 's also the fact that I know for a fact I know for a fact that she 's very frightened of his temper when it happens I know she is Cos she 's talked to me about it I mean there 's been a couple of times that he 's really lost his temper with her and erm and and really flown off the handle badly And I reckon that he 's the sort of person who would turn into someone that would hit someo hit his his woman because he takes her for granted enough as it is and that I reckon that 's how wife battering starts because the husband starts taking the woman for granted so much .  1528913_1558223
*PS0BL:	Mm .  1558543_1558813
*PS0BK:	that then starts taking their anger out on her .  1558813_1561503
*PS0BL:	Yeah .  1562503_1562563
*PS0BK:	and and if she 's already scared of his temper and they 've not even lived together well they have lived together for quite a while actually so I mean it 's not like they do n't know each other but once they 're married and they 've been married for a couple of years I reckon and he starts thinking of her more as a possession sort of thing I can I can really imagine .  1563123_1579633
*PS0BL:	I can just imagine .  1579633_1580553
*PS0BK:	him starting hitting her .  1580553_1581383
*PS0BL:	I can imagine him being one of these these these er husbands who just want who want who will want to go out with the lads on his night out and will get you know he 's a he 's ste I can imagine him being one of these stereotypical husbands who goes out gets pissed comes back who wants the dinner on the table and .  1581383_1597193
*PS0BK:	Mm I can imagine it going in that dir yeah that way It wo n't be like it for a couple of years But he 's not the sort of person that 'll say ah yeah we 've been doing this for a little while why do n't we just take off and go somewhere and fuck it fuck it let's just go and do something together he 's the sort of person that they would settle down into this safe little life and which would n't actually be that safe for Vanessa it 'd be very very you know much what Dangerous wants to do But I I can understand why she 'd want to marry why she 'd want to do that cos she has n't ha well had an awful lot of brilliant times in her life since she left Nigeria Nigeria was what kept her alive She hated living in England But I do n't understand why she has n't just earned the money and gone off somewhere .  1597473_1640463
*PS0BL:	Yeah but they 're gon na it 's such a hard thing to do I mean .  1640473_1643283
*PS0BK:	Especially by yourself she does n't know anyone she could do it with .  1643283_1644893
*PS0BL:	Yeah and and if you could I mean the thing is if you 're if er if we did n't have each other to go off with erm it would have made everything for us a lot different I mean okay we 're lucky we 're in a situation where we do know a lot of people who are who are like- minded .  1644923_1657713
*PS0BK:	Mm .  1657713_1657923
*PS0BL:	and we could maybe find someone else to go off and do it with .  1657923_1660633
*PS0BK:	Though it would be a case of finding someone else to go off with and not just sort of like I mean we mentioned it years ago .  1660633_1665943
*PS0BL:	Well I remember when we first met we wanted to go and do a dissertation together did n't we .  1665943_1669743
*PS0BK:	Yeah Oh can you remember walking around the streets of France saying yeah let's go and do our dissertation somewhere .  1669833_1681813
*PS0BL:	0 . 
*PS0BK:	Yeah .  1681813_1681963
*PS0BL:	Funny is n't it how we meet people how you can know them for ages then you just sort of talk to them or once you start talking to them you realize that you 've got .  1681973_1687923
*PS0BK:	An awful lot in common yeah .  1691193_1691433
*PS0BL:	in common So much in common .  1691603_1697363
*PS0BK:	Yeah Yeah .  1699453_1699693
*PS0BL:	You know I 'm in some ways you know I 'm so glad I 've never had like well before you know it used to bother me that I 'd never had a long-term relationship and that .  1699693_1707163
*PS0BK:	Yeah .  1707163_1707313
*PS0BL:	erm because it 's something other people have and now now I 'm quite happy with myself and feel a lot more sure about the way I think and what I want .  1707313_1715103
*PS0BK:	Mm .  1715103_1715163
*PS0BL:	erm it does n't bother me in the slightest because I know that I would prefer maybe to be on my own than to be restricted by someone .  1715163_1726593
*PS0BK:	Yeah because the other thing is that although erm you might have all these sort of high flying ideas about what you wan na do and you do n't actually feel tied down by a relationship actually you do live your life thinking well ca n't really do that because I wan na be with him .  1726813_1742163
*PS0BL:	Mm .  1744263_1744553
*PS0BK:	It 's just a different choice You might not necessarily feel stuck in it but it does make you stick around .  1744563_1752353
*PS0BL:	You can get you get yeah you can get tied into it without realizing it .  1752353_1754673
*PS0BK:	Yeah Yeah definitely It just makes leaving that much harder .  1755903_1759553
*PS0BL:	Yeah .  1759553_1759633
*PS0BK:	It makes like doing anything that much harder .  1760553_1762713
*PS0BL:	Yeah .  1767363_1767973
*PS0BK:	Definitely Mm What .  1771213_1777823
*PS0BL:	No I was just worrying that I always thought that I would never ever like come across anyone who I thought that I can even vaguely click with but I just realized that I can and it 's just quite a nice feeling .  1777823_1791373
*PS0BK:	Have you er have you spoken to Pete yet .  1791373_1793833
*PS0BL:	No I 've been thinking about that actually I must .  1793833_1796043
*PS0BK:	You 've been saying it for so long .  1796053_1797123
*PS0BL:	Well I know I b I I was thinking before I 'll wr I I should write to him but now I I 'm I 'm getting towards the stage where I want to write to him .  1797123_1803973
*PS0BK:	Yeah .  1805443_1805513

*PS0BK:	Yeah .  1815493_1815593
*PS0BL:	Cos I 'm thinking about it now I mean it was totally my fault it was cos I wanted a relationship he seemed he seemed .  1815603_1823713
*PS0BK:	Alright .  1823803_1824013
