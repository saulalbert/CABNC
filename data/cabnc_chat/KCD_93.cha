*NON:	Well it seems to me, if you cut it, if you put that one there, then this other piece, it'll use to do in there. •241824_242459•
*HEL:	What other piece? •242497_242559•
*NON:	Well, if we cut a piece round there. •242654_242808•
*HEL:	Yeah. •242934_242946•
*NON:	And the other piece that we got could do that one, that piece in there. •242946_244476•
*HEL:	Ah, you not, yes, alright. •244476_244729•
*NON:	Ok  . •244731_244740•
*HEL:	Well I mean half a bottle to do the top and the down, you can do that bit, measure if you like. •245294_246099•
*NON:	Yeah, ok, if you can measure it, then I can cut off... •246118_246339•
*HEL:	Can't tell whether that's going to reach or not. •248518_248752•
        I don't think it is, I think, no, I think you've got to come down another pattern. •248752_249205•
        Oh that one down then . •249205_249266•
*NON:	Got what you want? •249972_250027•
*HEL:	Yeah. •250056_250083•
*NON:	. •_•
*HEL:	Couldn't really see in the corner whether it was going, so tight. •250926_251274•
        Shall I go and get the other scissors out of the  cut the right side. •251607_252837•
*NON:	Yes. •252845_252854•
