*BRE:	If it's the   (        ) and that down it   (.) he couldn't see a blockage.
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	And as soon as he   (.) put some funnels and that down it   (.) rods   (.) pressure came back.
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	So you can't, but what Dave's saying is   (.) i if lighting the boiler   (.) and then it's going
*JEA:	It's switching in and out is it?
*BRE:	switching off   (.) and 
*JEA:	Oh.
*BRE:	the water's stone cold.
*JEA:	Yeah, yeah.
*DAV:	 (        ) touched that   (.) he touched several things.
*NIG:	What I'll do   (.) so is anything sucked down into the boiler   (        ) or
*DAV:	Right, I'll turn the central heating off.
*BRE:	What about the   (.) didn't you say tha what was the central heating thing, why was that hot?
*NIG:	 (        )  (.)  (        )  (.)  (        ) .
*BRE:	Bet that boiler has already had it!
*DAV:	What's the boiling point of water, people?
*NIG:	It's a hundred, Dave.
*JEA:	Ooh.
*DAV:	Is it   (.) so what would be si sixty five   (        ) being a reasonable temperature for hot water for a bath.
*NIG:	 (        ) hot in the tank.
*DAV:	Obviously you've gotta have cold too.
*NIG:	You nearly ready?
*BRE:	What just sixty five in a bath?
*NIG:	Well not sixty five   (        ) water 
*JEA:	Sixty five from the hot tap.
*BRE:	Oh what do you think it is then?
*JEA:	 (        ) so.
*NIG:	Well it's about, I mean that's normal about sixty, sixty 
*DAV:	About   (        ) 
*NIG:	five.
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	Has it gone 
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	up again then?
*NIG:	It has but I've turned the stat back up   (.) on the cylinder   (.) just made the boiler cut in again   (.) cos that's that's why the boilers cutting out cos it   (.) what it does once it gets up to temperature   (.) then it'll shut itself off.
*BRE:	Where's the thermostat for that then upstairs in the attic?
*NIG:	On on the tank.
*BRE:	Yeah but why would it be all of a sudden need to turn it up   (.) now?
*NIG:	I've turned it down.
*BRE:	Oh you've turned it down?
*NIG:	Yeah.
*BRE:	I thought you meant a 
*NIG:	See it might have reached temperature before   (.) I mean I don't know, I can't   (.) do a
*BRE:	I mean it's been 
*NIG:	do you have 
*BRE:	apparently alright, I mean 
*NIG:	do you have cold water coming out
*DAV:	it was put the boiling w w really hot
*NIG:	Yeah
*DAV:	and then
*NIG:	what hotter than normal?
*DAV:	Well I thought it was, yeah.
*BRE:	But you don't you remember Carla had a bath Sunday she ha , we had a bath about nine o'clock   (.) and then   (        ) when we got back she went to have her bath   (.) and she got in it and it was stone cold!
*JEA:	Ah!
*DAV:	I actually hear Lisa the other night she was coming out of the bath, oh she said, the bath's cold.
*BRE:	There's no hot water was there?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And it was about three hours later and I said to her 
*DAV:	It's really cutting out a lot.
*NIG:	Might be the stat   (.) playing up.
*BRE:	There thermostat?
*NIG:	Yeah on the
*JEA:	Mm.
*NIG:	from the erm   (.) tank   (.) see what it does once 
*BRE:	How much long do they last?
*NIG:	when it get's up   (.) well   (.) who knows, sort of thing   (.) once it gets up to temperature
*BRE:	Mm.
*NIG:	it like   (.) sends the thing down the old wiring and flicks the boiler off   (.) the same as with the heating once it gets up to temperature the boiler will cut off.
*BRE:	Yeah.
*NIG:	That might be that.
*BRE:	So does, it that a new one
*NIG:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	that's on there?
*JEA:	 ((cough)) 
*NIG:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	Yeah.
*NIG:	Well it's   (        ) 
*BRE:	Would have they put   (.) when they put the   (.) boiler in cos the boiler w  (.) we've had in three years.

*NIG:	they'd have to put

*NIG:	Oh right.
*BRE:	Servowarm in there   (.) and then Les 
*NIG:	but the heating

*DAV:	 (        ) boil I think   (.) there is a   (.) there's a thing there for the   (        ) 
*NIG:	Yeah that's that's what I mean it's if it if it run on   (.) the immersion before   (.) then you wouldn't have had that tank stat on there.
*BRE:	You don't we were u we had to use the immersion didn't we cos w we moved in in the June and   (.) Lofty and Brian said well don't have it done cos you're not gonna use until August   (.) so we   (.) they did it August time for us   (.) so but we didn't use Servowarm cos it had blown up, they just disconnected it for us, so we used the ho the immersion heater 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	until they came
*NIG:	Mm.
*BRE:	and then when they did it   (.) thr three months after we moved in
