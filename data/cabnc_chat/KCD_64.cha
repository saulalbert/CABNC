*NON:	I think British Gas profits are unbelievable.They er  (        ) .
*HEL:	 (        ) 
*NON:	Yeah, they buy gas at eighteen P and they sell it for forty three P. (        ) vast profit   (        ) and then they  (        ) .
*HEL:	How come, I mean, why does the big discrepancy?
*NON:	Why that's what they're charging, never mind the discrepancy.
*HEL:	Who sells it to them at eighteen P?
*NON:	The oil company.
*HEL:	The oil company.
*NON:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	So why are they allowed to charge forty three P to the consumers?
*NON:	They're a monopoly aren't they?
*HEL:	I mean what do they do to it to justify charging any more? (        ) .
*NON:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Don't do anything to it.
*NON:	No, (        ) .Deliver it to your home   (.) Well, what I   (        ) to is the erm, getting involved in  (        ) .Cos with British Gas you can't  (        ) .
*HEL:	Mm yes  (        ) .
*NON:	Erm , (        ) yourself on the gas side, because gas itself is not self   (        ) apart from.
*CLA:	I'd like to go down daddy.
*NON:	 (        ) is very small.
*CLA:	Mummy that's  (        ) .Have you got the new ones?
*NON:	No, (        ) .
*HEL:	Don't think so.
*CLA:	You, have you?Have you got the new ones?
*NON:	No wasting the outside of that one.
*HEL:	Mm, mm.
*NON:	I can't see a way.
*CLA:	Have you got the new ones?
*HEL:	I think they were thirty five dollars a packet.I don't know poppet.
*NON:	 (        )  (.)

*HEL:	Yes, we'll have a few.Think   (        ) oh it hasn't actually.Thought you had to put the weight on by law?
*NON:	Fright in asking what    (        )  (.) Somebody   (        ) erm, sell all the stuff, sell  (        ) .
*HEL:	I wouldn't of thought they needed to.
*NON:	They don't need to, but, erm, I mean nine, ninety eight per cent of their sales is on sale of gas, so the only way you can make a name for yourself is getting involved in things other than gas, one, installing central heating or kitchen  (        ) . (        ) talk about it.The way British Gas get involved.
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*NON:	 (        ) .I mean their gas showrooms in the high street.If you're running a business economically you wouldn't have those.
*HEL:	 ((cough)) never anybody in them anyway.
*NON:	No, but they weren't   (        ) for them, cos they, doesn't really matter, they've got so much pocket out of gas   (.) But the Gas   (        ) is erm, make them increase prices at five per cent less than the rate of inflation that way  (        ) . (        ) they get rid of  (        ) , saying that   (        ) privatised the price of gas is gone down fourteen per cent in the past  (        ) .
*HEL:	Has it?
*NON:	Well, well.
*HEL:	I haven't noticed.
*NON:	I mean nobody pick him up on that, but I mean, he might mean in real terms with, I don't think he has in real terms.
*HEL:	 (        ) 
*NON:	 (        ) has gone up.
