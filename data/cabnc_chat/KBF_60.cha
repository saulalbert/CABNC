@Comment:	conversation #61 (Tape 015602)
*JEA:	Well, the thing I mainly notice when last week when Paul was home, not last week, the week before last I had Paul solidly at home, he moved himself entirely in lock, stock and barrel at the weekend, he was then with me waiting for his job   (.) and he went out every day and did little bit's of shopping for me, got him from under my feet, saved me money, cos I was only buying what I absolutely needed, and the amount of time that I had, I mean I was able to go out for the whole day with Peggy on Wednesday, I was able to get food prepared and, admittedly I didn't manage to get as much done as I thought I was going to do, but then I think that's with most people in life,
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	but, not to have to drag out in the car to the solar and buy food in the supermarkets 
*BRE:	Oh it's wonderful .
*JEA:	Oh it was glorious   (.) I made a note to myself actually, that I'm only going to go out once a week for a proper shop, from a list, in the solar and the rest of the time I'm going to go to the quite expensive little Robber's Roe, round the corner from me.
*BRE:	Mm, I haven't been shopping this weekend.
*JEA:	You can't.
*BRE:	We go one, you know, if I   (        ) I just make do with what we've got.
*JEA:	Well yes, I do a lot of that, mm, yes.
*BRE:	I'm booked tomorrow because I'm going to Blackbush at seven o'clock in the morning
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Oh my god, there's remembering things, erm   (.) I'm hoping to  (        ) , ok I don't, I don't want to go you know it's too early
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	cos I'm going as a favour to give her a lift really.
*JEA:	Yeah, yeah   (.) I hate people who park on the ramp and causes to put yourself to a hill start, they are a   (        )  (.) 
*BRE:	Joy of a, joy of a
*JEA:	The automatic, yeah.
*BRE:	automatic, yes.
*JEA:	Yes.Neil of course is doing the male macho bit, oh yes it's, all very nice driving the automatic, but I like gears really, yeah.
*BRE:	I like the automatic when it's a, your on hill's like this.
*JEA:	Oh yes.Gerry was taught to drive in nineteen forty six in the States, where they, they gone, they'd gone over to total automatic, and he despised manual gears, thought they were a ridiculous waste of time and effort, said you want to concentrate on the, on the road, not on the car, but then you see Gerry improved himself, he was a  (.) 
*BRE:	Look at the queue to get in there now.
*JEA:	yeah, he was a Squadron Leader he was   (        ) Squadron Leader, being engaged in combat he done the lot, he didn't need to prove that he was male. (        ) with our parking and   (        ) aren't we?
*BRE:	Trouble with   (        ) .Yeah.I've gotta, I think people are so un-organised with Christmas, you've got to be organised, you've got to say like, you know, I'm only going to those shops, you know, if like like now, say   (        ) so we went in Boots
*JEA:	Like   (        ) , yeah.
*BRE:	for ten minutes.
*JEA:	Yeah, erm, also, erm,
*BRE:	But I think we could of gone down to British Home Stores, but we both probably would have spent more, than,
*JEA:	Oh, but we did get everything .
*BRE:	But we got , we got what was on our list.
*JEA:	Got something for everybody now.
*BRE:	And that's it, you've done your bit.
*JEA:	And once you've done that, you've got spare time and spare money you can buy extra, but come, come down to it Brenda, once the Christmas Day is over
*BRE:	That's it.
*JEA:	does anybody remember particularly what they were given, or make a great deal about it, of a meal of it, unless you've given them something absolutely outstanding like a fur coat, I remember the fur coat I was given in 
*BRE:	Or a car .
*JEA:	Well exactly.
*BRE:	That's it.Oh god that money gone right on  (.) 
*JEA:	 (        ) some old man, they are the worse you know .
*BRE:	Young   (        ) pulled right the way across and the traffic lights were obviously red.

*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	 ((laugh)) , it's quite good.
*BRE:	Marvellous, it's  (        ) 
*JEA:	When we went to John Lewis's in, in High Wycombe, they got some cheap fabrics on in lace or, or fine   (        ) material, and you know I very much now regret not getting some, because I want to dress up, remember I had a, a lace cover, a fitted lace cover on my kitchen   (        ) table
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	in one of the bedrooms a lacy   (        ) do you remember that?
