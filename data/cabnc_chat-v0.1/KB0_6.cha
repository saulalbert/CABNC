*GET:	Knowing Martin  what  John has just told me about him  if I didn't know him I don't think it would me anything! •102135_102963•
        Brief details like that are meaningless! •103096_103287•
        I trust the Ministerial Committee  to make decisions and bring recommendations. •103434_103975•
        On the other hand, I would like to meet the candidates to see what they look like. •104084_104431•
        But that doesn't , but what they look like is not going to affect whether I  support the Ministerial Committee or not. •104547_105143•
*UNK:	What actual details do we give to you? •105203_105764•
*GET:	Despite what David said, that  •105764_105884•

*GET:	Actually, I think David is right. •106431_106547•
        , it didn't come over, but for me when we interviewed Martin is one of most refreshing interviews  I've had the pleasure of taking part in! •106646_107604•
        He's a man of  rare   who was so privileged to go to Cambridge  and to be interviewed. •107618_108143•
        And came back having learnt a new verse  •108154_108330•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*GET:	which was probably written about twenty or thirty years ago  but recognised that his own congregations  would be very suspicious of them! •108411_109173•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	And it delights from this  thank you John. •109173_109581•

*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	erm  he is a member of Vanroch Caerphilly  at URC  and has done  I think  he is currently at   and erm  have felt a gentle call emerging over the last  few years  and erm  all started in Cambridge, that's about it, that's all I can say. •112210_114360•
*NOE:	Oxford. •114396_114432•
*GET:	Oxford, sorry! •114505_114560•
        Had too much . •114777_114852•
        All in favour of er Ian's  call being  affirmed please. •114852_115410•
        Thank you. •115410_115444•
        And thirdly, we ask you to affirm the call of Peter   for praying for  in the ministry. •115558_116279•
        Peter is a member of  right, he's actually a member of Clygarthy URC but he works  and has erm  as a  form of day pastor  and . •116279_117594•
        Member of Clan othel URC and has worked and  served as a form of day pastor at Clygarthy URC  and he  has come from the Anglican tradition  Church of England  and he has erm  over the years towards the reform tradition. •117594_119467•
        He  seeks to work as a   ministry within the Vale  and brings tremendous  in  erm to the ministry which he  he will hopefully let the side  . •119620_121100•
        He is also a self-employed  . •121100_121281•
*NOE:	I thought he'd be touting for business! •121293_122070•

        All in favour please show. •122546_122660•
        Thank you. •122825_123009•
        As we come to end of  of that part  we have erm  Burmingford Hall of Ministry two, three people  and we have also  as part of the report recognised the timing of Roy , where's Roy? •123067_124808•
        Roy, who is sitting over there. •124808_124890•
        Lastly,recognise this man is Bob, who's sitting over there. •124999_125397•
        Erm  those two people, along with Bryn   erm  were also in, in college together. •125422_126026•
        So they started their ministry off together, and I think it's  something quite special to me  and to recognise that we  have sent three people off on a journey  and three people, two here, have come to the end of a journey and  just part of the journey  and are beginning to discover that  will be  discovered in the life  of the three human beings, human beings •126099_128656•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	at the time. •128874_128954•
        Shall we remember  and these three friends in life. •128954_129464•
        Lord we thank you for the ways in which you challenge and call people  to all forms of ministry within the light of your church. •129662_130351•
        And especially we thank you today for the call of Martin  and Ian  and Richard  to the Ministry of Word and Sacrament within the light of your church. •130557_131579•
        We pray for them and their families. •131812_131997•
        We pray for them in their studies. •132208_132365•
        In their pilgrimage to  discover more of your presence in their lives. •132558_132983•
        As they begin a particular stage of the ministry  we also pray for those who are coming towards the end of that particular stage of the ministry. •133346_134263•
        Remember especially Bob and Roy  and we pray that you will enable them to find fulfilment and enjoyment, and enrichment  in their lives as they  step forward  in faith and confidence in  Lord in your mercy  •134580_137006•
*UNK:	Amen. •137115_137144•
*GET:	Amen. •137144_137188•
        Reports are not always about revolutions  and that's important! •137931_138364•
        And you will see that we now have  a good  erm  . •138373_138664•
        Well, over to Noel  to relax with each other thoughts, questions, comments about the life of the ministry of the church. •139008_140194•
        And  happens  some people have prepared particular presentations, you will see after one is on , and one of political insubordination, one on the process of learning together. •140194_141528•
        Five  districts have erm  prepared some of vision  in order to  share that vision or that example of what is happening in the districts, relating to the ministry  erm  with the   and those who have come to us as well. •141707_143617•
        And  one church has prepared a  little presentation or  mind-stretching, heart-stretching thought of church and community. •143694_144484•
        So we're, we're here now to relax. •144633_144915•
        To talk about the Ministry of Office. •144915_145137•
        I think, in starting this off, I would like to  encourage as many people to take place in conversation, if possible. •145175_146182•
        And I will include in that  those who are  younger than most of us here. •146300_146882•
        Er, to talk about what  you think about the ministry  of the church as well. •146896_147326•
        We're talking about this  partly because of the document passed in the ministry in which, everybody has avidly read  and erm  has been  talked about after the seventeenth  er, in York  in July. •147560_148946•
        But I think the more important reason for talking about  the Ministry of the New Church, or the Ministry of the Church  is because of the  erm  developing needs and the  developing thoughts and ideas which are actually  additions  which are the, the crucial area  where ministry takes place. •149001_151661•
        First of all, I think it would be useful if we were clear  that with the new , ministry was a waste! •151667_152531•
        Too often, we are limited in thinking of ministry as those who  either do or do not work where  are thought of. •152531_153729•
        And, we might call those Ministers, if you like, with a big M. •153879_154293•
        Erm  but we'll be talking about the Ministry of the Church. •154293_154748•
        We're actually talking about, I mean, if you remember this , we're talking about  the absinity  of the body of Christ. •154748_155736•
        That is the Ministry of the Church. •155751_156019•
        But each one that's here  however old or however young  are a part  an active part  an essential part  a crucial part  of the Ministry of the Body of Christ. •156187_157541•
        We are these. •157541_157782•
        And how we relate  within the church  and how we relate outside the church  although, in essence, there is nothing outside the church  there is nothing that that position . •157782_159220•
        Okay? •159220_159230•
        As you look into your shaving mirror in the morning, you shall say, hello Minister, how are you? •159244_160101•
        Or as you look into your drawer in the morning, to find out what you need  to put into your hand bag in the day, you say hello Minister, how are you? •160101_161184•
        Okay? •161184_161190•
        That's . •161614_161630•
        We're also talking in terms of a ministry  which  what you expect  is very often what you get  you're trained to be somebody , okay?. •161630_163007•
        And one of the things that these trainings help you   is that if you expect something of a child  then you're much more likely to get it! •163007_163936•
        That way it's positive. •163965_164211•
        If you expect that child is going to  do a fantastic job  on that painting  then that encouragement and confidence is coming across. •164212_165153•
        It also works negatively! •165179_165515•
        If you don't expect much from little Tommy  then, little Tommy is less and less likely to give you anything much! •165515_166194•
        So we're talking about ministry. •166194_166546•
        We're talking about something which is bound by our expectations. •166546_166852•
        We need to be aware of our expectations  because our expectations can be  limiting  and can be stretching and  inspiring. •166852_168052•
        We also are exercising the Ministry of the Church  within a context. •168087_168920•
        We've learnt something about the church and . •168920_169241•
        One of the contexts in which we are exercising ministry is that we have  for the last fifty years  well I haven't personally! •169241_170272•
        But for the last fifty years or so  for most of us  the experience of the church  has been declined  and  closer  and  reducing number of people with dog collars. •170273_172281•
        Okay? •172281_172294•
        There have been negative interference. •172294_172744•
        We need to be aware  of how those can actually triple the numbers. •172744_173358•
        We need to be aware of how  we are  subconsciously  taught. •173382_174089•
        A Geographer  knows that  and  the whole environment importance. •174279_175372•
        A Geographer also knows that in order to  use maps  you need to know  where you are. •175412_176513•
        You can't get anywhere without knowing where we are. •176513_177011•
        Half of our exercise in listening to each other is to know where we are. •177023_177796•
        In order that we can begin to recognise  the movements and the visions and the views  of where we can be. •177993_178658•
        Knowing where we are in terms of the way in which we are tricked into having  bad . •178658_179598•
        Knowing where we are in the way in which we are tricked  into believing that erm  our churches now are weaker than when they were founded  and  probably most of you, many of you have heard my children's prayer. •179619_181272•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*GET:	the children are the difference between churches now and churches in the past. •181273_181795•
        Especially at church anniversaries. •181836_182016•
        .And nine times out of ten when I ask the congregation  whether your church is bigger now than it was when it was founded  nine times out of ten the congregation say, it is smaller now than when it was founded. •182016_183521•
        And nine point nine times out of ten they are wrong! •183634_183858•
        We've got a wrong  false  image of the . •183858_184534•
        And that is harmful! •184534_184989•
        And it's parallel. •184989_185227•
        Those visions come from within ourselves. •185228_185781•
        Come from the way in which we don't necessarily take on board what we are learning. •185781_186695•
        They come also from  orgasmic enters or whatever  such programmes there are go around these days,! •186695_187199•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	Carole, you tell the people sitting next to you what orgasmic is. •187201_188014•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	What did he say? •188014_188427•
*UNK:	I don't know ! •188488_188575•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Is it Derek Nimmo? •188576_188636•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	In the nineteen fifties. •188636_189032•
*UNK:	I never •189032_189151•
*GET:	Erm •189210_189213•
*UNK:	I never watched it, in fact. •189213_189602•
*GET:	There's also the whole of notion of what we are saying by our ministry together. •189623_190004•
        Okay? •190004_190028•
        What we are, what we are saying by our buildings. •190053_190479•
*UNK:	sort of ended in a little   •190549_190670•
*GET:	What we are saying by our notice boards. •190677_190997•
        Many of which are still in action. •190997_191333•
        What we are saying by our commitment or our attitude. •191428_191649•
        What we are saying by  the way in which we share what we are saying by our commitment to justice  and peace. •191649_192268•
        All of these are involved  and a part of our ministry. •192349_193063•
        And, that again, might be me  but many of you when you've heard me say it in a service  I've ended up  with my asking at the end of a sermon  asking the congregation to smile. •193063_194548•
        Now, you know that's  how many of you I, have I done that to? •194548_194979•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	Well that, that may be a reflection on me, okay? •195098_195302•
        But  what are we saying by our expressions  both within worship and outside? •195356_196240•
        And of course, our discussion of ministry i.e. the activity of the people of God  is not just a domestic thing about the URC. •196285_197247•
        I mean, we  we get bound up with  with all sorts of domestic things, and will, I expect, later today. •197247_197891•
        But it's also  erm  about discovering the completeness of the ministry of the people of God  as we enter through the various commitments that we have  to our sister churches  in Wales and in Britain  and in the world, whether it's routine or a particular relationship of members or  All that's part of the context  of the ways in which we're talking about  and sharing with each other with God. •197891_201745•
        Please smile? •201745_201767•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	There is a list here  three major's presentations on  communion  on political insubordination  and on the pilgrimage of learning together. •201785_202970•
        I think what we'll do is hear each of those three presentations  and then I will allow a time for comment, especially discussion  after each  I will limit that  to make sure we get time for all  so that's  that's the way we're going to do it. •202970_205439•
*UNK:	Thank you. •205439_205477•
*GET:	But first of all  in terms of a precedency attitude  I hope I'm looking in the right place? •205477_205938•
        Nannette  erm  is going to  lead us in our  . •205950_206392•
        Nannette would you like everybody where you are and who you are? •206392_207236•
*PHI:	Nannette  the Minister of the United Reform Church in Merthyr  also sharing the ministry with the Presbyterian Church of Wales in Merthyr and Merthyr Vale. •207267_208370•
        Thank you John for that introduction. •208465_208650•
        I remember John coming to Merthyr and asking the young people to find, see if there was anybody who was over a hundred in the congregation! •208650_209483•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	And the dazzling thing was that quite a few made a beeline for  a lady who , could at least give  thirty years! •209533_210209•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	I thought  haven't noticed from where I'm standing! •210212_211137•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	In preparing ours for today  and  the whole question of thinking of being, main precedency of communion rests in our understanding erm, of ordination, which I know  later we  we will have time to discuss. •211137_212727•
        But, may I ask , of you a question  not for answers but will  erm  perhaps come later in the debate  and that is what does the  service of Holy Communion mean  to you? •212741_214308•
        Our answers  will get crushed. •214535_214865•
        But one thing that I would share with you  and it's this, is that  whenever the  friends of Jesus eat and drink together  they remember him  his sacrificial love for them  and the wonderful gift of freedom that he has made possible. •214865_216908•
        I'll say at the outset, that Holy Communion is not something that we play about with. •216909_217667•
        Our communion service is part of the rich tradition which has been passed down to us  from Jesus Christ. •217667_218603•
        But having said that  I have to share with you the  a key element er, in the life of the church has been the ordained Ministry of Word and Sacrament  and pastoral care. •218603_219902•
        And there is no intention to dispense with this kind of service. •220138_220803•
        But concern is expressed  in the number of jobs that the perfect minister is expected to do. •220803_221573•
        I stand here, I am not a perfect minister because I am over forty  I've got  children that are not too awkward but  erm, could be awkward  and, I haven't a spouse  ah  and ah  I stand here saying that I'm not good at everything  I'm good with young people, I'm not only good with old people  I try to do my best. •221573_223848•
        We know the picture of a perfect minister  but  we  there is a challenge  to relief ministers  to do the work that they are called to do. •223878_225530•
        This will lead to  a long debate. •225538_225951•
        But, it is  it seems from this report that  is in front of us  that it is now appropriate for the URC  to take a new step with regard to the local ministry of elders. •226027_227556•
        Already this morning the question has been asked about providing elders. •227556_228097•
        And it is that  each local church, of whatever sign  should be invited to nominate from amongst their elder division  those elders who district council  might consider and recognise as dividing elders  for a stated period of years  with authority to , provide them all services of worship and meetings of that local church, as the need arises. •228097_231149•
        And this has been suggested, the same thing, the understanding that we have now of special authorization  which obviously doesn't work. •231170_232512•
        The reasons for looking at this change and, I quote the reports  the  the ways the district council interpret the existing clause  about ,precedency  is the district council  ah, interpret in very different ways. •232523_234802•
        A second thing is that  a , is it right that a company of people  should be deprived of a sacrament  because an ordained minister is not available? •234859_236279•
        Remembering the words of Jesus, that where two or three are gathered together. •236291_236824•
        The third thing that the , the report says is that there is no magical element about sacraments. •236854_237582•
        But  sacrament has everything to do with the grace of God  and the faith of the church. •237715_238345•
        And this proposal is seen, lastly, as developing  local leadership. •238351_239044•
        The proposal is that presiding elders  and whether proposal is the right word, but the suggestion that presiding elders  be  appointed following our conviction  that every local church  should have regular sacramental worship  with presiding  with people  presiding  being allowed. •239052_241419•
        Can I close by saying that every time Christians share the Lord's supper  they are publicly declaring their needs to be fed with the living bread and wine. •241419_242861•
        What does the holy  communion, what the Lord's supper  mean  to you? •242861_244432•

        And  we lack provisions  that allows for a presidency in the absence  of a minister  is a good one as long as it is monitored closely by  district council. •246105_247220•
        And  be that there no magical  erm   like you, which I agree there is a mystical. •247220_247852•
        Like it isn't   you know that  the Eucharist, er the the  the communion is very central to our worship  and  having had ten years working at the Navy  that was an eye opener  and deepening of my own spiritual awareness  in the, as in the sanctity that I got, the sacrament  and how other churches see it  and er  helped to create a very   affirm, at the very centre of my own  if you like, pilgrimage. •247852_250756•
        What had abhorred me in the past  and sometimes, er, perhaps arrive and been to the church and say, oh by the way it's communion! •250756_251647•
        And  have that sprung on me  I I I, I I feel terrible because  the communion service is, is something I have to prepare for  in myself  and obviously shape the whole service around it. •251647_252915•
        And I think we need to heighten, sharpen our awareness of  erm  what I understand by communion  and er  er, also to er, to remember that the  injunction of Paul as he was  you know that I have  received of the Lord at which I deliver unto you. •253051_254747•
        Those words of execution as we continue to read them. •254787_255241•
        There's a severe warning against those  who can't do it in a spirit of  of of,lardiness and, and not discerning  to the body and and, and the will of Christ. •255241_256173•
        Perhaps that needs to be reminded about them. •256173_256376•
        But they er er er, it's good to have  and sharing it  but I  but I, but I, I personally feel as long as it's  well monitored within the  within the district council  in the event of a minister not being able to be there  then  er a , er , a recognised person to  . •256389_257860•

*PHI:	Yep. •261021_261043•
*UNK:	Erm  oh yes  my next question was  er, what is holy communion? •261052_261585•
        I'd like to re-phrase the question  what is holy  in  communion? •261585_262417•
*UNK:	Okay  well I mean •262417_262472•
*UNK:	do we say, what is holy in communion we then recognise that it's not  what  but who  who is holy  in communion  okay? •262472_263679•
        The holy, as in communion to me is a who  not a what! •263679_264064•
        Okay? •264107_264111•
        And I think that debate  er between the, the  tradition and, and the  the   and and er, Roman Catholic traditions, you know er, this business of elevating the host and and  substantiation   so the elements themselves that, that it become holy  alright? •264124_265890•
        And then it's a kind of a what, you know? •265942_266143•
        It's the body of a what, and the blood as a what! •266153_266415•
*UNK:	Have you read ? •266415_266563•
*UNK:	But that's not it! •266564_266634•
        And that's not what Paul meant  when he said  the body of a what! •266635_267103•
        He meant  who? •267136_267292•
        That is holy. •267301_267445•
        And who is holy? •267445_267623•
        Jesus Christ. •267704_267747•
        Alright? •267747_267770•
        You wanted it, and that's it! •267770_267833•
        When two or three are doubted  they're wrong! •267844_268195•
        So, what's the who? •268196_268301•
        That's the holy to me. •268307_268416•
        And the other who of holy  is the Saint. •268416_268981•
        I'm making this point because I think that we can get really  to verify   •268981_269339•
*UNK:	You're always going on about •269339_269586•
*UNK:	You know  this whole of idea of things and ritual being the holy  and that things in the ritual there  yes, there are sacred symbols  and they need to be handled in that, that, that sense of sacredness, but the  that which makes them sacred  is the person, our Lord  and us  in communion with him and with each other and it seems to me that wherever that happens there is sacrament. •269636_272257•
        Wherever that happens there is  holy communion. •272257_272583•
        Even if the elements aren't even present. •272665_272868•
        Okay? •272868_272874•
        But I think I think those elements are important otherwise Jesus wouldn't have made a point of it! •272874_274125•
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*ENA:	David     East Wales. •274125_274319•
        Can I clarify please what exactly we are talking about here? •274319_274919•
        Because the document, Patterns of Ministry  does not  talk about lay presidency! •274919_275601•
        It talks about the presidency of ordained people! •275656_276199•
        Elders  who are ordained! •276199_276502•
        Now, I rather wish it was talking about  lay presidency  and I would go along with Nannette  on the question of a lay person  presiding in communion. •276502_277714•
        Ecumenical dynamite, I know! •277714_278005•
        But I think we need to be clear  whether we are talking  about ordained or lay people  and further on in the discussion whether we can indeed justify that division. •278005_279823•
*UNK:	How can try  and allow an elder   as an ordained minister of the free people . •279823_280489•
        Can I say that need holy communion as a group thing  in a way of our communion  and  as a church we are going to be Roman Catholic. •280489_281980•
        It is the community  as a  an affirmation of the community  and to say that we need to have an outsider in to do that  because there is not an ordained minister there  to me, is a little like the situation in some Anglican Parishes where there's a woman  sitting •281980_17•
