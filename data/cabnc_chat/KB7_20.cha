@Comment:	conversation #20 (Tape 018507)
*ANN:	It's    (        )  (.) innit?
*STU:	Mhm.
*ANN:	And it doesn't say it has to be other people here   (.) probably not, every bit of it
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	but
*STU:	Some of it.
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	I can't do much about that, I mean you can't go sticking in other people's noses.
*STU:	No that's true.
*ANN:	Oh wrong way round   (.) two kings, two eights.
*STU:	Two tens.
*ANN:	That's it   (.) that's all you got.
*STU:	If I take penny there then, that will all make   (.) forty pence, okay? (.) You're not taking all that money are you? (.) You'll start getting back now, now you're back to your last four pence   (.) when it comes down   (.) you start getting back   (.) don't you? (.) Oh, what do I want here? (.) Oh I don't know whether I wanted that   (.) Bloody hell! (.) One, two, three on the bounce   (.) three, six, eight, jack   (.) what's that supposed to be? (.) And a pair   [laughing] of tens    []  (.) jack, queen, king   (.) Feel alright? (.) Bloody man, I don't want to see that    (        )  (.) it's got three   (        ) on it.
*ANN:	Oh   (        ) boys on it.
*STU:	Well here are, one, two, three on the bounce and I thought well   (.) you know that's a fairly good start, jack, queen, king   (.) king high was a bit dodgy     (.)  (        )  (.) you never know do you?
*ANN:	Oh I've got a handful of bloody   (.) pairs here, wait a minute   (.) got fo I've only got three   (.) feels like a bloody handful of them! (.) Can't do nothing here   (.) Ain't got nothing there.
*STU:	Is that what you're playing?
*ANN:	Well I have to, I ain't got nothing else.
*STU:	Three fours   (.) eight, nine, ten   (.) queen high   (.) the pairs stuck at the end though dear.
*ANN:	Oh    (        )  (.) not one flush.
*STU:	Must of been  (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah but then it split the bloody pairs all in bits.
*STU:	Yeah, I know, I know   (        ) yes.
*ANN:	Couldn't make a lot with that  (        ) , could I really?
*STU:	Not really no.
*ANN:	 (        ) there for three pairs which was just as well I stopped you on the last one.
*STU:	Ooh! (.) Ooh! (.) You bugger!
*ANN:	Oh I want card for run    (        )  (.) and I bet I can't bloody do owt with this lot.
*STU:	No neither can I.
*ANN:	Can't even   (.) bloody hell! (.) Ain't got eight   (.) ha ha.
*STU:	Nope   (.) No how's it going?
*ANN:	I don't bloody know   [laughing] how to play  [] ! (.)  ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Wanna play one, two, three, four, five, six and   (        ) haven't you?
*ANN:	Yes.
*STU:	Or five six seven and   (.) that's what you wanna do innit?
*ANN:	Oh yeah.
*STU:	No   (.) no I wouldn't do that   (.) I always do it like this   (.) if I was playing that hand   (.) three flu well you could go well   (.) you got a choice   (.) you can go   (.) take a chance on your last hand, not getting through   (.) or   (.) you can go two, three, five, six, seven   (.) two three four, ace   (        ) finish them   (.) which is what I'd probably do.
*ANN:	Oh I didn't see that, oh 
*STU:	One more try
*ANN:	I didn't see that love
*STU:	three queens   (.) jack flush   (.) ace high, so I mean you wouldn't get any it anyway.
*ANN:	I didn't see that last flush, I couldn't ba , I couldn't sort them out.
*STU:	Yeah but I mean it's   (.) it makes you one, two, three, you wouldn't of had a one two three to start with 
*ANN:	I know that 
*STU:	but you had a eight   (        ) to finish with which is   (        ) finishing   (.) and a one, two, three   (.) might not be   (        ) and a   (.) better run   (.) so   (.) I think I would have been tempted to finish with the ace flush there   (.) try and stop me rather than trying to win it   (.) cos you had nothing else did you? (.) No   (.) you didn't have   (.) you didn't have a finishing hand, you didn't really have a brilliant first two hands   (.) and then the pick of the one, two, three bouncer   (.) I might   (.) I might have been persuaded to play the one, two, three bouncer and hope that that got through   (.) but to finish with an ace flush   (.) but good.
*ANN:	Oh I don't know   (.) I ain't got nothing.
*STU:	Neither have I.
*ANN:	Oh I'm not playing this, bugger it!You chose, I can't sort it out      (        )  (.)  (        )  (.) I ain't playing no more, it's damn boring!
*STU:	There a nice pair of fours   (.) ace high there   (.) er   (.) seven, pair of nines, ace high   (.) about all you got really   (.) that's all of it   (.) whatever you got  (        ) .

*ANN:	That's it.
*STU:	high   (.) I'm only coming out with a ten flush, pair of aces, and a pair of eights   (.) would have been mine whichever way you played it.
*ANN:	That's it.
*STU:	 (        ) about   (.) or either of them   (.) want all your pennies my dear.
*ANN:	Wasn't that a damn boring game!
