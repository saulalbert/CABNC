*JOA:	Don't start that. •112438_112482•
        From my experience of perms  I wouldn't bother. •112493_112728•

        The reason they've gotta be those colours is erm  and clear nail polish. •113433_113578•
        Carefully open up the diskette three point five inches for the best effect and it's like my Amiga one  remove the top covering from the inside, scrape a lot of match powder into a bowl  match powder. •113578_114222•
        After you have a lot, spread it evenly on the inside disk. •114222_114473•
        Using nail polish spread it over the match  mixture, let it dry, carefully put diskette back together  nail polish to seal it, do it on the inside where it came apart. •114491_115015•
        When that disk is in a drive the drive head  to read the disk which causes a small fire  inside  disk drive  ha ha ha ha, let the fuckhead try and fix that. •115015_115648•
        It melts all your disk drive. •115656_115763•
