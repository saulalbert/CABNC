*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	what are they deaf in there? •_•
        Be interesting cos you can hear exactly what they're saying, mm  I say people like Simon and Doreen who don't erm televise much and you've got the telephone you told me don't you? •_•
*BEV:	Erm •_•
*WEN:	The other day  have that other one there  •_•
*BEV:	Oh it could only of been at five thirty •_•
*WEN:	Mm •_•
*BEV:	they won't go yet •_•
*WEN:	They might not go all night, but er •_•
*BEV:	Well they were doing it at eleven o'clock last night, it must of been something like that because I heard every word  •_•
*WEN:	Yeah over that  I mean sometimes you want to sit quiet and you cannot can you? •_•
*BEV:	No •_•
*WEN:	Yeah, well I dunno, do it all properly  I must do all my bits and pieces tonight, I haven't done them this week, oh let's have a look at the poll tax, because I thought there was one more, I'm sure there is •_•
*BEV:	Yeah  •_•
*WEN:	Sandra wasn't sure, I don't know, I'm sure there is •_•
*BEV:	Yeah there is •_•
*WEN:	turn on that and I've done mine  •_•
*BEV:	But the kids are changed these days you know •_•
*WEN:	The kids are what did you say? •_•
*BEV:	Changed •_•
*WEN:	Well I don't •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	not right is it? •_•
*BEV:	Like, I would never of thought of •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah, what you talking about him next door? •_•
        Or thingy •_•
*BEV:	Well both  •_•
*WEN:	Both , but this one next door Bev is pushed from pillar to post •_•
*BEV:	Yeah •_•
*WEN:	I mean  •_•
*BEV:	he wants loving •_•
*WEN:	he's a very kid where the mother's got to go to work •_•
*BEV:	he wants loving •_•
*WEN:	and I mean let's face it if he is still with the old grandmother, it's, that's a different world as well innit? •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	But this kid goes haywire and a lot of them do  I mean he's all crash bang wallop isn't he? •_•
        There's no •_•
*BEV:	Wayne is though •_•
*WEN:	Wayne yeah but she, she was his neighbours and that don't she? •_•
        That one down the road aren't they? •_•
*BEV:	Yeah  •_•
*WEN:	And all that, or at Betty's or, what have you, I don't think she'd leave them with the mother-in-law •_•
*BEV:	No •_•
*WEN:	but she leaves them with the neighbours or a neighbour, but I mean it's all different to bringing them up yourself, innit? •_•
        Gotta be, there a, it's a complex really because nobody will agree, erm, give, bringing up a kid will they? •_•
*BEV:	No •_•
*WEN:	Nobody and I don't ever think people will bring up somebody else's the same as they would their selves, I, I don't think it's possible for anybody to do it, I mean look at Julia when she was a, that childminder with that Kerry •_•
*BEV:	No she didn't care •_•
*WEN:	Julia didn't care a sod about that kid, she'd let her to scream on, stand in the middle of the garden screaming, indoors screaming and she said to me I have no feelings for her whatsoever but she took the bloody money every week and this is what's so wrong, nobody knows how she er was as that child, only people like us who would hear •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	and all Julia wanted was more and more and more money, there was a conflict on how many children she could have and sometimes she had five in there, one of them which was then very small which she had to spend time feeding and that and that was Kerry •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	well those others, three of those, somebody else's children plus her own ran total riot out in the garden, but I mean there's not enough people to come round and do spot checks even if they're allowed, I don't know whether they're allowed to, but they've  •_•
*BEV:	I don't know if they can •_•
*WEN:	No I don't, but nevertheless nobody knew only people like us and the neighbours, how that kid was every day when her mother to the T S B and her mother according to Julia had her because it was the done thing  her mother, her own mother wouldn't have her, Kerry to look after her  and I know that for a fact because one time when Ross was ill, Julia said I can't have her and she said oh god I suppose I've got to go and beg my mother to have her now  she did, but the woman said to Julia, I mean she wouldn't give up her job, they had a four bedroomed house, two bloody great cars, eleven cats •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	and er, I mean what she saw of Kerry was, she dropped her here at quarter to nine, she picked her up between five and half past and the rest of her she saw around kid, the rest of the time she saw her own kid and er Julia was to have her until she went to school, so I mean how can there be any bond there, which there can't, but the mother said herself I had her because it was the done thing  so I mean it's, it's today innit don't you think? •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	I mean all that kid do was scream, scream, scream, scream, I mean Ross wasn't the best one to be with, cos he was selfish and of course in Julia's eyes he never did any wrong but Kerry come off worse all the time and I said childminding is fine and it's necessary but the people, you know that, that people can't know people and Julia was a spoilt brat so •_•
*BEV:	Mm  •_•
*WEN:	I mean you must, if you're looking after a little girl, you must in the end, unless you've low and detest children, or unless you're out purely and simply for the money, I mean how can you •_•
*BEV:	Not get a bond. •_•
*WEN:	well how can you not get somewhat attached to a child, I mean of course there's children you don't like, like adults you don't like •_•
*BEV:	Yeah, but then you still, if you see them every day •_•
*WEN:	That's what I mean •_•
*BEV:	you get somewhat attached to them •_•
*WEN:	Julia felt nothing for that child, she didn't like her, she didn't hate her, I mean she, she didn't  she just felt nothing cos that's precisely what she told me, that's her words, not mine, you know and I find then, that, she shouldn't be a childminder •_•
*BEV:	No  •_•
*WEN:	that's my instant reaction, instant •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	that Julia wanted money more, more money, I mean he worked every hour that god gave at , so his money must of been decent, had to be •_•
*BEV:	I don't think daddy would of let them •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	oh I don't know cos Julia was living with a bloke before that, I don't think they'll of had any say in it •_•
*BEV:	Oh •_•
*WEN:	and from what I understood he was already married anyway, never, never was mentioned here, but I did hear it, whether it was true or not I'm not say it, but I was told that he was already married and divorced to marry her, that was what I was told, no I mean I don't know, but  but I'm damn sure that I know •_•
*BEV:	I hope this fucking kid don't play with that every day •_•
*WEN:	That's alright, play with it, there's no point in saying anything to them Bev it's now got to be proven  and I say, if I can get it done and I can get it sent off, then they will point me in the right direction won't they? •_•
*BEV:	Oh yeah •_•
*WEN:	That's the, that's the whole point, you, you have to start somewhere, yes I can give her a bit of paper, yes she can throw it in the bin, it's made no difference, in fact I think it's getting worse since I spoke to her, isn't it? •_•
        She's had more people in there, the dogs have been left more hours that  •_•
*BEV:	Ah that's just her situation •_•
*WEN:	Fair comment, but this week she was on holiday, didn't stop her and going and leaving them poor dogs in there barking their heads off and crying, for seven and a half hours did it? •_•
*BEV:	No  •_•
*WEN:	I mean poor dogs and this, I mean we've said it all before it's not viable, four dogs and a semi that you don't exercise, four dogs that er appear particularly one of them to be housed in the same little area, day in day out with a curtain on the door, so that there's not even light going in there •_•
*BEV:	That's so he can't see out in the garden •_•
*WEN:	That's what? •_•
        So that he can't see what's going on, cos she thinks if he don't see what's going on he won't bark, but he cries  but I mean she shouldn't have them there, she's never here so she shouldn't have them, I mean look at the trouble Alan had to get Jessie, because they worked, but Emma goes home every lunch time to see to Jessie  from the bank, but I mean the woman  one of them wouldn't let her have a dog, one kennels, which is how it should be, but I mean this one breed those three herself so, yeah  I mean if you breed dogs yourself and you have three in the house of the same breed, what the hell do you want an alsatian for, as well but the whole point is she don't have them as enjoyment, she don't have them as company •_•
*BEV:	Yeah, they're just there •_•
*WEN:	They're their, their animals that's all like that chicken up the garden I mean I don't know what it's in, might be in a run, but being the place that is in behind that shed, there ain't that much space with a rabbit as well is there, you know, I mean, there might be a run on the floor, it'll be crazy to have a run on the floor because she's had rats •_•
*BEV:	Oh •_•
*WEN:	ain't she? •_•
*BEV:	yeah •_•
*WEN:	And she's had rats under that shed  it ain't that long ago she said, she said she had them  so I mean I can't see anybody with an ounce of common sense letting a chicken being on the ground, ground •_•
*BEV:	Well no •_•
*WEN:	who knows I don't know, I wouldn't, but who knows? •_•
        You're back to that situation of commonsense again ain't you? •_•
        Won't she? •_•
*BEV:	Safe from •_•
*WEN:	Safe from cuts, good heavens •_•
*BEV:	What? •_•
*WEN:	probably the er, poll tax are •_•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*WEN:	Right, that was worth it, weren't it? •_•
        I think oh he's left out there his •_•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*WEN:	Oh it's bubbling away nice •_•
*BEV:	Stir him again then •_•
*WEN:	What again? •_•
*BEV:	It says stir occasionally •_•
*WEN:	Oh  watch that dish, it's a bit hot that dish  right •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	no, just towels, good one, right whip it out for me then please, I'll have to leave it there because some of this is, still out there, ta  well that's not bad, time wise •_•
*BEV:	No •_•
*WEN:	Oh  I bet these kids find this thrilling you know, don't you? •_•
*BEV:	God  •_•
*WEN:	Barking dogs next door  barking dogs next door again, so I shall, plenty of material shouldn't we? •_•
        Subject to material  •_•
*BEV:	god, yeah  The annoying, the most annoying thing about it •_•
*WEN:	Yeah •_•
*BEV:	is, is if she tries she can make it quiet in there •_•
*WEN:	That's what she's supposed to do according to the Citizens Advice Bureau, is to control them so that she don't annoy the neighbours •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	Now Sunday when I had her about that terrific barking, your father was the first to say, look she stopped it •_•
*BEV:	Yeah •_•
*WEN:	but she lets them bark on like she lets the kids scream on, and that is today innit? •_•
        I think basically what it comes down to, it doesn't bother her •_•
*BEV:	So why should it •_•
*WEN:	so she doesn't care about anybody else •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	It can't bother her Bev because the amount of noise that we get through the walls is so bad and she's in it, she's actually there with the animals barking, so she takes no notice whatsoever of them •_•
*BEV:	No •_•
*WEN:	she's probably bloody used to it after all the years she must of had them, she tells  •_•
*BEV:	can't  •_•
*WEN:	she tells me they're all old dogs •_•
*BEV:	But dogs whatever age don't  •_•
*WEN:	Well  •_•
*BEV:	make that noise •_•
*WEN:	the way she said it that day was, they're old dogs, they don't need the exercise and they don't bark, that is the impression, impression I got  •_•
*BEV:	It's not true so  •_•
*WEN:	Now what's that point to spend an afternoon here  no point at all is there? •_•
*BEV:	Not a lot •_•
*WEN:	Well there isn't any more is there? •_•
*BEV:	They wanna get that paper out •_•
*WEN:	Sorry? •_•
*BEV:	Do you think that put that paper through the •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	what out in the garage? •_•
*BEV:	Yeah •_•
*WEN:	I dunno, right let me do this and then I'll have a look  I mean I've got to do this because I'm not sure of it, •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	done now innit? •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	I wouldn't wanna do it tomorrow, well only later afternoon  but I mean if I have to put ear plugs in at night to get some sleep because of them, surely the authorities have gotta say something about that  •_•
*BEV:	Well •_•
*WEN:	well for god's sake, I mean I often wonder about people who make noise like this how they would feel if we did do the same, but I still say because we've done our polystyrene insulation she can't hear us, it's worked in the reverse ain't it? •_•
*BEV:	Probably •_•
*WEN:	Instead of us, you know, instead of it blocking out for our benefit, I reckon it blocked out for their benefit somehow  a hell of a lot of insulation, in here •_•
*BEV:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	a hell of a lot really, normally you wouldn't have the vinyl and normally I would think you would only put the tongue and groove not out of the polystyrene behind it and the vinyl, I can't see why people want tongue and groove that they go to all those lengths would you? •_•
*BEV:	No •_•
*WEN:	Well I don't think so tongue and groove is, is wood innit? •_•
        I don't know I mean I don't know nothing about these things, what, really have to feel that we are the lot  •_•
