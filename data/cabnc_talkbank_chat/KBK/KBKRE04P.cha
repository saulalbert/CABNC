*PS107:	What I 'll do to pick it up play a game probably play a game later Get used to those shots right .  2093523_2104113
*PS05X:	Oh .  2104383_2104413
*PS107:	Problem is when you 're demonstrating is you tend to do things wrong .  2105033_2111183
*PS05X:	0 . 
*PS107:	I mean you should be able to have an awful lot of gap .  2111743_2118113
*PS05X:	They do n't do they no .  2118353_2119603
*PS107:	about an eighth in size Yes this standard is alright but the championship would be about a sixteen Though what you should do is is just walk up to the ball that line through there .  2119693_2133403
*PS05X:	Oh right .  2133403_2133753
*PS107:	It enables you to line that up .  2133753_2135223
*PS05X:	It 's it 's a sight Yes yes .  2135413_2136803
*PS107:	It 's fairly important that as when you walk up to the ball you 're body is in line with where you want to be .  2136803_2142553
*PS05X:	Right right .  2142673_2143063
*PS107:	And then as you walk up you really should sort of almost end in the ideal place and then having lined up the shot put it through like that .  2143253_2154583
*PS05X:	Right and it 's anticipated that you will strike the erm the hoop in the process .  2155073_2159623
*PS107:	Yes yes there 's no harm in that I mean it would be nice to go through cleanly but .  2159903_2163743
*PS05X:	Right yes .  2163743_2164423
*PS107:	How you hold the mallet is really up to you eh there are many different ways you can hold it like that you can hold it down there up there .  2166423_2173803
*PS05X:	Oh .  2174093_2174123
*PS107:	like that just a however you feel comfortable .  2174543_2177633
*PS05X:	It 's it 's a question of control and movement .  2177633_2179333
*PS107:	You 'll find it the better I do n't rank much but tend tend to to just do that and it 'll go through .  2179593_2190323
*PS05X:	Yes yes You tend to let the mallet do the work rather than .  2190323_2193753
*PS107:	Yes .  2194253_2194423
*PS05X:	0 . 
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes .  2194633_2195253
*PS107:	quite the height .  2203383_2204003
*PS05X:	Right .  2204003_2204243
*PS107:	same sort of height as me and surely Anyway just just try that .  2210893_2227133
*PS05X:	Yes .  2227883_2227973
*PS107:	Obviously taking a bit harder . 
*PS05X:	Right yes .  2247943_2249033
*PS107:	Can you see that ball weighs about a pound so got ta be able to .  2249193_2252413
*PS05X:	Yeah right right .  2252413_2254343
*PS107:	You take a bit of force .  2254623_2257243
*PS05X:	Yes yes quite .  2257243_2257783
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes I yes I take your point .  2260543_2262703
*PS107:	If you 're going to approach the that 's the striker 's move . 
*PS05X:	I see .  2272343_2272703
*PS107:	That .  2273563_2273723
*PS05X:	Right .  2275343_2275533
*PS107:	So you 'll try and just get the back a little lean perhaps a little bit over towards there like that erm .  2275533_2287173
*PS05X:	Right .  2291973_2292083
*PS107:	Then if you want blue to go the other side of the hoop and black to go here say to the black wo n't go quite so far and the blue will .  2292413_2303363
*PS05X:	Right so that you 'll do a clean run through .  2306323_2308963
*PS107:	Then you can that ball again .  2311313_2312643
*PS05X:	Right .  2312743_2312853
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Right Then you 've got a continuation shot .  2312853_2327113
*PS107:	Having run you 've got another continuation shot .  2327193_2330633
*PS05X:	Right .  2330953_2331213
*PS107:	You then take that 's how you would progress through the hoop .  2331213_2336213
*PS05X:	Right right and you 'll use an opponent 's ball normally or any ball .  2336463_2340463
*PS107:	When you 're until you 're in danger of breaking down I mean breaking down would be when you 'd approach the hoop like that and you realize you ca n't run it .  2340463_2349683
*PS05X:	Yes .  2349893_2350193
*PS107:	And you 've got your opponent 's ball the other side of the hoop and the blue ball 's over there somewhere so you obviously would n't try and run the hoop you 'll just join back up with your partner 's ball .  2350473_2359933
*PS05X:	To scupper the opposition .  2360403_2362433
*PS107:	Well he he .  2362433_2362813
*PS05X:	To give him nothing to play with Yes yes .  2362903_2366503
*PS107:	Erm no I mean ideally you 'll make the break if you have another ball .  2366853_2373913
*PS05X:	Right .  2374843_2375023
*PS107:	Having made the two comes through to there you just having clear of the metal work you put this is a three foot just not in it at the moment .  2375023_2391763
*PS05X:	Right .  2391873_2391963
*PS107:	You 'd want to put that yellow ball up on your next hoop and and get black somewhere near the blue so then you can run that .  2392953_2399973
*PS05X:	I see yes yes .  2400223_2402113
*PS107:	Something like that it 's not very good .  2403463_2405723
*PS05X:	Yes oh yes .  2408513_2409403
*PS107:	The trouble is with demonstrating is talking as well as . 
*PS05X:	No no no problem .  2416073_2425583
*PS107:	I need to get that just that little bit further this time . 
*PS05X:	Right right .  2432213_2435853
*PS107:	round the hoop well that should come back up like to come back up onto the yard line .  2437023_2448363
*PS05X:	I see now what about the red .  2448923_2450583
*PS107:	Well .  2450893_2451163
*PS05X:	We ignore that as we 're not actually playing .  2451803_2453523
*PS107:	Ideally that would be in the middle there somewhere as a pivot . 
*PS05X:	Right .  2464793_2465093
*PS107:	To you 've gone through the hoop so you 've pushed so .  2465443_2475863
*PS05X:	Oh so it 's not a straightforward round the outside and up the middle .  2479733_2483133
*PS107:	Oh you have to got there in a minute .  2483163_2483943
*PS05X:	Yes I see .  2484133_2484593
*PS107:	We 're putting red we 're putting blue on the .  2484593_2486663
*PS05X:	Oh I see I see yes .  2487163_2489113
*PS107:	I 'm just going up near red ourselves .  2491473_2493163
*PS05X:	Yes .  2505873_2506263
*PS107:	That 's a bit better .  2506433_2511633
*PS05X:	Yes smashing .  2512463_2515423
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	0 . 
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Right so long as we then strike yellow we can put it in .  2521243_2525893
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Move forward onto the hoop .  2526493_2527483
*PS107:	Yes .  2530263_2530353
*PS05X:	Right .  2530483_2530603
*PS107:	Does n't matter if yellow goes off Does n't matter if the ball goes off in the or when you 're running a hoop it just comes back up .  2530723_2539003
*PS05X:	Right .  2539403_2539693
*PS107:	But at any other time it 's the end of your turn .  2539743_2541633
*PS05X:	Right .  2541633_2541723
*PS107:	Now we 've got this is a roll shot and we want the yellow to go beyond and the black to stop just in front of of the hoop .  2542943_2559353
*PS05X:	Right .  2559373_2559463
*PS107:	Oh .  2559463_2559493
*PS05X:	Does that matter .  2559493_2560053
*PS107:	Should be able to get through there Secret here is to miss that . 
*PS05X:	Yes .  2569913_2570183
*PS107:	If you miss that it 's got to go through .  2570183_2572053
*PS05X:	Yep .  2572283_2572473
*PS107:	Well if you put a just hit it down a little bit I got probably wo n't get through but if you hit it down a little bit to give it a bit of spin it might carry it through very nearly did n't it .  2573283_2583883
*PS05X:	Mm .  2584153_2584213
*PS107:	You see it .  2584433_2584843
*PS05X:	Yes yes .  2585123_2585943
*PS107:	If it had been spinning a bit more it would of kept on .  2586043_2588273
*PS05X:	Yep yep .  2588343_2588613
*PS107:	Let's just assume that we 've hit that erm that would have been .  2588753_2592383
*PS05X:	That would have .  2592383_2592743
*PS107:	that would have been the end of my turn .  2592743_2594533
*PS05X:	Oh would it No it 's got it 's got to be cleanly through right fine .  2594533_2597093
*PS107:	This side .  2597373_2598623
*PS05X:	Yes yes .  2598623_2598863
*PS107:	So what you see people doing is this oh no you should n't do that .  2599283_2603953
*PS05X:	Aha .  2603953_2604103
*PS107:	I say to you well I mean I say to you it 's not through that 's accepted .  2604403_2607613
*PS05X:	Yes .  2607613_2607913
*PS107:	If I say to you do you think that 's through .  2608243_2610203
*PS05X:	Yes yes very questionable well it 's it 's .  2610203_2617923
*PS107:	they say to me yes that 's through it 's O K so that 's it you do n't have to .  2617933_2623443
*PS05X:	Right right .  2623473_2624203
*PS107:	I think really if you 're doing that you should ask somebody else to come and .  2624423_2627413
*PS05X:	Yes .  2627413_2627493
*PS107:	But once you do that soon as you put your mallet against the hoop you push the hoop if it 's loose forward anyway .  2627563_2633873
*PS05X:	Yes indeed you have yes yes .  2633873_2635523
*PS107:	and eh you 've obviously dislodged the situation where somebody else should argue perhaps .  2635633_2639173
*PS05X:	Yes yes yes that 's right yes .  2639173_2640583
*PS107:	But if if I say to you no I 'm sorry Chris that 's through .  2640743_2644303
*PS05X:	Mm mm .  2644303_2644823
*PS107:	then you would have to accept it cos it 's really the person who 's in play who 's the referee .  2644943_2648703
*PS05X:	Yes right I see .  2648703_2649663
*PS107:	In a certain and friendly way .  2649663_2650833
*PS05X:	Yes yes indeed yes fine .  2650833_2652033
*PS107:	I mean I I would say almost certain that 's not true is it .  2652033_2655643
*PS05X:	I I can just see a touch of the black .  2656153_2657623
*PS107:	That 's right it 's not through I mean we both agree it 's not through .  2657623_2659773
*PS05X:	Mm quite quite yes .  2659773_2660413
*PS107:	but you 'll see players who I mean I mean did it the other day when I was playing and she did this oh yes she I said you 've moved it I thoroughly accepted it was n't through you should n't do that .  2660653_2672673
*PS05X:	0 . 
*PS107:	How can how can you possibly put that ball back where it was .  2672673_2676013
*PS05X:	Yes absolutely yes .  2676013_2676653
*PS107:	Yeah .  2676973_2677173
*PS05X:	Yes .  2677483_2677633
*PS107:	You can see it was n't through we both agreed it .  2678483_2680613
*PS05X:	Yes yes .  2680613_2680983
*PS107:	Erm push that yellow down erm so let push it down there ah not hard enough because the black should have gone nearer to the red . 
*PS05X:	Yes .  2705103_2705603
*PS107:	And then red down to blue all the way round .  2705603_2707783
*PS05X:	I see yes .  2707783_2708903
*PS107:	Very .  2708903_2709163
