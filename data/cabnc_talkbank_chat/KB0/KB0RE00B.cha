*PS004:	Shoppers creche that must er registered What does registration mean It means that when you go along to the social services register and it 's above board children 's work that you are doing But they have a right within the law to carry out to check all persons who are offering help in caring And registration may be denied anyone who has been convicted of any certain types of offense It 's the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that all those leading groups are people of good standing The church must make every effort to achieve the highest standards And the church as bible road to fame in alerting us to our responsibilities Now there 's one thing that I have to alert us all to the rest may not have been important perhaps only to some of the larger churches but groups are advised and churches are advised to make sure that in buildings that are used ah for many different groups that young children under the age of eight do not come into contact with any casual people who may be using that building Now that is quite an implication when you think about it There is need to emphasise the importance of encouraging people to re receive some sort of training when they come forward and offer to be involved in the work of our under eights and young people I do n't think there 's any need for me to spell out any more at this point what that may mean but the responsibility in as churches to ensure that we care for the under eights I will in fact erm answer any questions afterwards .  305_139595
*KB0PSUN:	Thank you Nanette An introduction that is important There are a number ar of areas in the ma state legislation that have been aligned to the church or will affect the running of the church One is the children act one will be something on on on the preparation of food another will be one affecting the way in which charities have to keep registered accounts er financial accounts which means that an example erm is responsible for registering the accounts of congregations by law And another will be erm the responsibility to er the minister the alterations to listed buildings which might be landed on the on the churches What Nanette has said has been an important introduction and if yo if what sa you have prepared altogether is legible then perhaps give it to Eileen and it can go out in the Synod papers that will be helpful Erm and in the faith and life department of urc we 'd better preparing a pack on the children rights Other information on whatever We move now we move now to er faith and life is on we 're on page thirty five moderator and friends of faith and life In the very short space of time that we have available this afternoon there are three subjects that I need simply to bring to the attention of Synod The first the little report under the heading of faith and life on page five of your reports the second is the report of the provincial advocate which is on page six and the third the report of the Youth Secretary which is on page twenty Erm all those because subjects come under the general umbrella of faith and life and I think er moderator probably the correct thing is to do is to be formal and to begin by er proposing that these three reports be received for discussion .  141165_286025
*KB0PSUN:	Then I 'll receive the reports of faith and life and the Youth Secretary and the new secretary for discussion yes .  287095_295365

*KB0PSUN:	weekend that we are arranging this summer as we have done annually for a number of years Er there is a a little orange leaflet which has been placed on the seats during the day that many of you I hope already have er for anyone who has n't may I perhaps place these on the front table there 's a the there 's another supply over there and could I please ask that some responsible representative from each district would please take a few more of these away with you so that they are distributed in district meetings in the near future and attention drawn to them there er if there are not enough copies er then I 'm sure the provincial office on receiving a a request from you will make sure there 's more that passed on to you Now if you had an opportunity of glancing at the leaflet already you will have seen that the leader for this July 's er weekend is is Mr Henry and I do n't think I can do any better than to spend two minutes of the time that we 've got in asking Henry if he would say a word or two of introduction to the theme for this year .  308865_379548
*KB0PSUN:	Ignatius of Loyal er or er more properly known to me in church history was the scourge of the wrath of the of the council of reformation and inside of consumism but I think regards some years ago in on Ignatius spirituality of bibles which I 'm delighted to see John has mentioned in his prologue for the er for his introduction to Holywell the the the association 's there came to discover who Saint Ignatius er helping to sort of tap greater spiritual depths and er resources and consequently trained as spiritual director er in Ignatian things The spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyala have once were once described as a sort of a spiritual from which people of past men put together again .  387648_434678

*KB0PSUN:	Er to start off with they do the full spiritual exercise of Ignatius Loyal all takes thirty days in silent retreat with a with an individual er under individual guidance with a with a a director or it could take anything from nine months to eighteen months to do in er day da da da living in open sort of retreat What I hope to do is simply to share with you the life of Idigo and in experiences and to walk alongside him and also to help us reflectively to look and examine our own journey where are we with God Where 's God in our life where has he been and where is he directing us And so it 'll be a gentle I hope and er reflective type of weekend and er using some of the tools of Ignatius and other tools cos Ignatius was very er adaptable er you know in in methods of prayer and reflection and contemplation I .  440668_506618
*KB0PSUN:	Thank you And I I I hope that I I hope there 's a good variety of people will again as you always have done will turn up er this year to share fellowship a on this theme which er is is a refresh theme I think for for many of us Now the other two subjects I 'm really only dealing because the people responsible are are not here in the flesh this afternoon but Alyd the provincial advocate and I I think of Bill that 's also gone too er yes he he has he has had to leave this afternoon Erm so what I promised to do in er er a moment or two if people are to ask specific questions or comments to make arising from either of those printed reports on page six and page twenty erm if you would make your point or ask your question now er it will be recorded and transmitted to the officers responsible and they will take any necessary action or give any reverent replies to those questions This does n't preclude any private questions in conversation with those people at any stage during the life of the church So if if there are any formal concerns that anybody would wish to bring formally before Synod and erm to either Alyd or Bill then perhaps state them Right .  511778_601000

*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	And first of all before we er we put the reports we there are a number of er there 's one alteration and a number of er additions obviously alteration or I should say a a an amendment is something an important place on page fifteen er at the tope of the page referring to December nineteen ninety two I 've put which is agreed by gp committee with the exception of young these representatives that we ask them to bring thirty pounds towards the cost that should be twenty five That 's the actual figure Erm one difficulty with with giving a financial report is so many things seem to happen quickly and a erm apart from the fact that there was a a major finance resources comes from we as well you see that I have to tell you now these have been done on the red letter assembly side and you may want to alter one there er according to reform I see the cost per erm person attending is not a hundred and twelve pounds but a hundred and fourteen pounds and that means that we have forty representatives we 've got to try and find four thousand five hundred and sixty Now I hope I 've got these facts right and I 'm sure that not that Eileen may correct me that er we have er forty hundred pounds in the budget budget for this er the erm South Wales congregation has has kindly erm given us grant of a thousand pounds and I understand from the secretary of con Cardiff congregation and he 's also offered a thousand pounds I do n't know whether we 've got that yet But then .  858205_982255
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	That will be it is thousand so that 's er that 's three thousand four hundred short of a four by sixty And what the difference is that er we thought that you could have one young person per district and that they only have to pay thirty two pounds each but I think these are only purely .  983085_997795
*KB0PSUN:	Yes er I have them for those who received that incorrect information from me I must apologise erm young people who are going as delegates as representatives of their district must be treated as adult representatives and they have to pay full price Er for for people who are going to group and and for any young people who are going observers there are special arrangements to be made which does n't relate to our official represented district I 'm sorry about that .  997795_1028855
*KB0PSUN:	So that means that er in th the total we do have to pay in some way or another is four thousand pounds with sixty but we 'll say we 've already got three thousand four hundred if all the for forty people go and they pay twenty five pounds each that 's another thousand so we 've got a I think I 've got it right a we 're only a hundred and sixty short Fairly reasonable I hope we get that from somewhere So er er that that is if we 're up-to-date on the financial Now the most er serious business the er Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety two and the Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety three At the meeting er of the Financial Resources Committee that I attended on Wednesday the first thing we discussed was the er the giving so far up to the end of February from the various provinces and we by the end of February er the total was up to thirty thousand pounds less than we required er which could mean that the end of the year it could be a hundred and eighty thousand pounds less than required but er of all the .  1028935_1103385
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	all the provinces bar one have balances which could be used to make that up so the money is fairly short and we 're bear er for pains the .  1103565_1114415
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	ten and a half thousand from the first of July onwards for this year Now erm i i in Wales and I 'm sorry to say our figure er we should of produced ninety thousand pounds and we provi er produced er eighty three thousand two hundred and nine that means we are er six thousand eight hundred down in two months Now we have a balance as it already tells you er in er earlier in the paragraph of this paper that that we had a er balance of sixteen thousand pounds a in the ministry last year so if we knock sixteen thousand pounds .  1114735_1154795
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	what we 're likely to be short of it seems to me we could end up being twenty four thousand pounds short at the end of the year Now there are quite a number of reasons for this and the good news I think that I bought good news again this morning is that presentations both about budgets er and about what we do wi with the small churches is er could be some of our salvation Question of budgets our I was almost said halleluja .  1155255_1187265
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	If only all our churches could do that we would really be getting somewhere The biggest problem of all is that we ca n't look forward and that a lot of the problems being problems are happening now and happened since the er the first of January that should of happened they should of happened in th in th in the er at least the three months before the end of last year if not more So er we 're getting people saying it 's impossible to pay this even though they were asked if they could pay it at the the the time it was given sometime last July Well that 's one the other reason of course we have got a large number of chur very small churches in fact looking at our mai ministry figures nineteen ninety there were thirty churches that did n't pay anything to the maintenance and a lot of these I think maybe .  1187965_1239175
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	that both Gethwyn and Russell sorted out er who up on on those extremes that you get in a group that that maybe feel they re that they really have nothing to hardly anything to do with us they 've do n't receive ministry and why should that be and after be asked each year has to go up And they see o I just wonder whether they just pile letters in the wastepaper basket And therefore if it can really come to this possibility of ministry a sort of Young Farmers Club idea of getting themselves about that could be a a a a a a marvellous boost So the the other thing which is er erm a real problem partly because of that is is when one talks about an increase in in giving increase in percentage i or a contribution of the church is in er we were talking about twenty percent la twenty one percent last year that would be alright if everybody gave twenty one percent Those who did nothing they can eas easily increase their giving by twenty one percent it 's still the same .  1239805_1302345
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	It means that the other people have to give more that 's why some of the churches I think they 've found that their er requests for their er er their er contributions have gone up enormously So er those are the pro those are a lot of the problems that we are we are facing now will we really er will we end up at twenty four thousand down at the end of the year That i all I can say is that my that 's my best guess at the moment We know there are some churches which er will probably only pay quarterly so they have n't paid yet so that 's money that 's coming in On the other hand we know there are some churches that are finding great difficulty in meeting er what they 've said they can .  1302445_1342515
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	and are doing their best to do it So that 's on the down side So er at the moment they 're saying all I can see is that er we would have to use up the whole of our balance that 's sixteen thousand and the twenty four thousand arrears Now that as the picture er leads me onto the next er stage which is what in ministry er what can we do in nineteen ninety three Erm a letter was sent to all district secretaries who I think in mo most cases sent these round to churches to see if we could get some idea from you as to what sort of increase in contributions could be possible for nineteen ninety three That 's quite difficult to do because where there 's so many churches not being sure whether they 're going to make it this year how can they say what 's going to happen next year On the other hand er if we did what our friend from Cheltenham is doing we would have lo we would be looking forward like that all the time we would have some idea Now I 'm pleased to say we have had quite a number of of er replies from churches on what they think they can d do On the other hand some of these er are good re positive replies and some of them some are negative And it seemed to me that when I as the er your representative on Provincial Finance Committee is asked to make a co commitment for this for this for er for nineteen ninety three I could say no better than what we had as out target this year and that was hard Cos clearly we 've only er reached something like five hundred three thousand four thousand er then it 's gon na be a a big jump to get to the five hundred and forty Now nobody er er a at this stage at the er Financial Resources Committee er challenge us on this figure I think we will just stage of of doing arith arithmetic of adding it up but no doubt that the staff will be comparing what going to be er what within a but have prepared for next year with what we 're supposed to do this year and ours is an increase of another percent We look at all the other conferences the lowest after that was the Northern Provence which is in a very similar position to ourselves and they were offering a five percent increase Er a few others were offering seven to nine and most of the others were offering between ten and fifteen percent So we 're way down on all the others so that then falls three hundred thousand pound short of what is required to er give ministers an increase to twelve thousand next year There seem to be our two groups er in one of our provinces and they say that the rich and poor but the rich er er are not so rich and others That in fact er there are three provinces who are already now contributing more than anyone else that they feel that the churches should go forward to try and raise the minister 's to what was proposedly that the assembly last year they should be paid thirteen thousand two hundred but in order to do that see another six hundred thousand pound raised and it is likely that this will be put as a challenge to the churches at assembly Now if I could just remind you of what 's happened at the Lyndford Haven er er Synod last March erm the Financial Committee have suggested that we should go for a target of five hundred and ten thousand but er this is we are not gon na be able to even start looking at the eleven and a half thousand if if er all the provinces do it for months and more and we I think very bravely or foolishly whatever way you li look at it proposed that we should got to five hundred and forty thousand and it looks as thought we 're gon na end up certainly nearer to five ten than five forty Erm but if we er are are going to en ensure that ministers can get er at least twelve a of twelve thousand next year then we have to er erm there has to be further offers from provinces As I say there are three provinces who 'd like to go further and than that be even er more increases Now I have put down reports about the finance committee er as it were but I think the responses from the churches and districts sort of calculator will be there we think that it would seem as though we should only offer the same amount as last year But I think if we have further discussions with churches and districts that we might see that we can break that a bit further for that reason when we come to er come to the resolutions I would advise you er er propose a minor amendment with the second thing But I think that er .  1342515_1656445
*KB0PSUN:	We can now receive this report for the Any questions or comments on paragraphs that are not erm relating to those So any questions or comments on paragraph one on page thirteen Or paragraph two or paragraph three or paragraph five or paragraph that 's it Yes So if there are no questions or comments on those paragraphs erm we move to the other resolutions .  1656445_1687095

*KB0PSUN:	Er what I would like to propose the erm a a that resolution two of course was put down at the time it had to be put down er and is clearly going to be affected by that it happened at the th the financial services in March and what I have suggested is that you might prefer this be a a a second resolution it is or and turn to the to add on the end of that resolution thus urging local churches to through their consultations with district treasurers and finance committee to increase their contributions to the Ministry of Mission Fund in nineteen ninety three in such a way that provincial commi commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two But th the thing is that it looks as though it is going to be a fairly ongoing thing that 's going to it may be well on certainly er a beyond assembly when we have to come to a conclusion and therefore we ought to know the picture er of within reform churches far more clearly in giving more time But clearly we need to have the authority that the that er to having discussed to a form of .  1693825_1772845

*KB0PSUN:	I think I should while you 're putting the words in such a way so it was n't a er it was n't thought that everybody just increased everything by five percent But as I say the the people who did not five five percent er therefore others may not have given more .  2317411_2330861
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	Others may give less because they 've got a lot of members so that therefore it 's so that the provence as a whole could be advised And I would have thought us giving five percent and and there are other provinces that are giving more will ensure at least the the on twelve thousand we pay next year and therefore starting with eleven and half thousand we paid this year and that provinces and in ourselves went further than that it is possible .  2331991_2362121
