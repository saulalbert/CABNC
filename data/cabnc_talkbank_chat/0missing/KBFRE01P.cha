*PS04U:	Mm it 's dished up in that . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm . 
*PS04U:	This tea and that little bit gives you any inclination how to go about that Oh I see look Department numbers and how you spend it so you must have to fill this card in I should think The only the only department is the cosmetics that 's not we 'll ask when we get there . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm . 
*PS04U:	It 's not half past ten already is it . 
*PS04Y:	Hm I was just thinking Returning from Stone Market I had a taxi at twenty past nine I arrived at the station in good time for the train but I did n't have to wait more than three or four minutes and I was in London at ten to eleven That 's not bad going is it . 
*PS04U:	No . 
*PS04Y:	At Liverpool Street . 
*PS04U:	Leave the from the journey . 
*PS04Y:	That was the next bit . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah Journeys are funny You 'd think because we live on you know Woking is on top of us but it 's but it I notice that it was quite you know a time By the time we sat down here I thought well considering that we came in by car door to door practically and that when the driving was n't public transport it it 's taken quite a time to get into . 
*PS04U:	It 's we actually got car locked did n't we We left home at half past nine So it 's taken an hour just to drop her off Get parked and get in here It 's taken an hour . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm mm . 
*PS04U:	Like you say you could sort of travel into London in that hour could n't you . 
*PS04Y:	Yes yes strange is n't it .

*PS04U:	Inside of that everything else There 's some the baby in the highchair smashed it . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm . 
*PS04Y:	Now unless you 're out with your husband I ca n't see the point of bringing your baby out on Christmas shopping . 
*PS04U:	It 's too crowded for the kid is n't it . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm mm . 
*PS04U:	Mind you some people I suppose have got no option That they have to . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah My preferred option would be to leave the chap at home with the baby That 's what I did when Ann was small But then Jerry was n't interested in shopping anyway He quite liked to leave it to me . 
*PS04U:	No Rather be home and let you get on with it . 
*PS04Y:	Hm hm hm . 
*PS04U:	I think you get you get either a man who really likes shopping do n't you .

*PS04U:	And they 'll say that 's a good scoop Getting a out is n't it .

*PS04Y:	Mm That 's marvellous . 
*PS04U:	So it should would have been a hundred and forty five . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	God there 's a hell of a difference is n't there . 
*PS04Y:	Yes it is . 
*PS04U:	But the only thing awkward I suppose about that is the fact you 've got to erm carry it around . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	All right I mean all right she did so that one of the guys would perhaps carry it around for you . 
*PS04Y:	You do n't like to ask them . 
*PS04U:	But you do n't like to because of the fact you know he 'll be erm sort of lugging it around and you 'd feel you 'd actually have to sort of hurry him up would n't you You know hurry up . 
*PS04Y:	Yes yes . 
*PS04U:	because . 
*PS04Y:	When I have been entertaining Shirley and Terry Jones doing an evening meal on a Saturday or a Sunday and sometimes both to help Shirley when she was getting into the run of going back to work I found that one of the cheapest of dinner party deserts was lemon meringue pie . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	And everybody likes it . 
*PS04U:	It always goes down well does n't it . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	Christmas time whenever . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	And to take the hex off it I grate the lemons the day before and wrap the grated rind in cling film . 
*PS04U:	Yeah you do that do n't you . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	I know that one you made last time you were down There 's no waste in our house . 
*PS04Y:	That 's right I No . 
*PS04U:	What 's having Having turkey for Christmas or . 
*PS04Y:	Hm . 
*PS04U:	They having turkey at Christmas or do n't they let you know . 
*PS04Y:	I do n't know what they 'll have You see Mary Ann and Mitch are vegetarian . 
*PS04U:	Are they going for dinner as well at Richard . 
*PS04Y:	Oh I think so Yes I think it 's going to be a proper family Christmas . 
*PS04U:	The trouble with that if you turn it down . 
*PS04Y:	Then that would be awful . 
*PS04U:	Even this is probably this one year you could probably done with . 
*PS04Y:	I could have done with saving some I would 've liked to have looked after me and kept an eye on the rest with Paul . 
*PS04U:	0 . 
*PS04Y:	Yes Everybody Yes . 
*PS04U:	It 's fairly typical though is n't it One year you could do with . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm mm . 
*PS04U:	staying around . 
*PS04Y:	You mean as it is I think that Neil was a bit of a sensitive area . 
*PS04U:	Hm . 
*PS04Y:	You know I 'm I 'm spending money and time on him that really I suppose in theory I would be spending on my own grandchildren However I take the attitude that in modern times people do n't people are not obliged . 
*PS04U:	The thing is who else . 
*KBFPSUN:	All right 0 . 
*PS04Y:	to feel by duty as it were that they ought to take notice of their immediate family John and Maryanne are capable of financially supporting themselves So I do n't worry about the money aspect And in every other way psychologically emotionally morally they are able to look after themselves Neil is n't . 
*PS04U:	I think and I think that 's that 's saying you ca n't pick your families You can pick your friends . 
*PS04Y:	Mm It is true . 
*PS04U:	So true . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	Because . 
*PS04Y:	You found it so . 
*PS04U:	You can do without that hassle and at least if you 've a good relationship you got a good . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm . 
*PS04U:	At least there 's not a lot of chance to have hassles . 
*PS04Y:	No no . 
*PS04U:	But that 's how relationships should be . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm It is one of the great arguments for the old fashioned sort of religion Which you could turn you could legitimately turn to people and say why are you leaning on me so hard for all this support You ought to be reading your bible saying your prayers going to church and getting in touch with the boss That 's why I laughed when they were said Terry Waite would need counselling I bet that Terry Waite was praying his head off and he 'd memorised masses of the bible which he would be reciting to himself probably said he thought two o'clock every afternoon I 'll remember what I can of Book of Isaiah you know I do n't suppose he needed any counselling He 'd do better counselling other people . 
*PS04U:	That 's right Yes Because I mean he 's he 's er needs it all Even though he 's been to a prison I mean He 's seen what 's going on and five years is it . 
*PS04Y:	Yes yes voluntary bit . 
*PS04U:	Thank you It 's delicious . 
*PS04Y:	Beautiful stuff is n't it .

*PS04U:	Yeah but often it 's a bit heavy though is n't it Sometimes it . 
*PS04Y:	Or .

*PS04Y:	only bread and butter pudding with custard or chocolate ho ho .

*PS04Y:	Well men 's the fabrics of men 's clothing is better stronger . 
*PS04U:	Hm . 
*PS04Y:	Because men feel cold more I mean they can wear if you think about it they wear suits in the middle of summer where we 're into sleeveless linen dresses .

*PS04U:	Are n't they . 
*PS04Y:	No They are next door neighbours who I think are very nice but I do n't think that Jackie and Nev have a lot in common with That 's one house that adjoins them and then a little further on it 's a lane It 's about as wide as this Brenda . 
*PS04U:	Well what do they need What what area is it . 
*PS04Y:	It 's called Fenn Lane . 
*PS04U:	How much is it . 
*PS04Y:	And it 's in between St Mary and Needham market . 
*PS04U:	And how far is it from you . 
*PS04Y:	About a between ten and fifteen minutes drive I suppose Ten minutes perhaps . 
*PS04U:	Oh it 's not far . 
*PS04Y:	No . 
*PS04U:	Still doing her kitchen job . 
*PS04Y:	Yes and she phoned me and she said I feel as though I dropped out of the bottom of the world she said You know I just do n't see anybody Well of course you 're working on Monday You see she used to have Mondays to herself and I would often go round on a Monday afternoon and we could we could talk But that 's gone and I said I ca n't run in at half past five when you get home from school and chat to you because Nev will be coming at six and I do n't want to be there all that often when he 's there erm it 's just you know it 's just happened And I also thought to myself and I 'm probably going to move a lot further away than Fenn Lane . 
*PS04U:	She does n't I mean she does n't bother that much now does she . 
*PS04Y:	No . 
*PS04U:	I mean I think been up . 
*PS04Y:	She can with a true friend I 'm very sorry for her because I think she and Nev have made a really a quite ferocious mess of their lives Nev never intended to be slaving away doing kitchen fitting He wanted to wood sculpture that was his idea in . 
*PS04U:	And slow down a bit did n't he . 
*PS04Y:	Yes yes . 
*PS04U:	Cause he 's almost . 
*PS04Y:	He 's on the gallop and he looks very old and worn . 
*PS04U:	Does he . 
*PS04Y:	Mm And she never wanted to return to full time teaching It 's providential for her that she 's got a job that she 's very good at and that she enjoys In an extremely nice school . 
*PS04U:	0 . 
*PS04Y:	And my handkerchief such as it is if she is no I 'll have to go to the loo or something to get some paper I sha n't worry about Such a perishing bore Oh bless you thank you very much . 
*PS04U:	Knew I had a I hope to get it . 
*PS04Y:	Hm mm . 
*PS04U:	And Jackie 's . 
*PS04Y:	That 's right and who knows When we go into Smith 's in Woking I 've got myself . 
*PS04U:	Busy . 
*PS04U:	I might see something for Jackie Mm . 
*PS04U:	0 . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah . 
*PS04U:	It 's only two o'clock . 
*PS04Y:	I 'm amazed . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah And I really feel like going back putting my feet up and chatting to you a bit more because we have n't chatted enough have we . 
*PS04U:	we have always got the bulk we are only going to be in Woking an hour . 
*PS04Y:	Yes We have n't chatted enough . 
*PS04U:	will you the er tapes You really feel that we 've really put into it and really done well have n't we . 
*PS04Y:	Oh I could n't have done a quarter of it . 
*PS04U:	And I think I 'm left with two people and that 's it . 
*PS04Y:	I could n't have a quarter of it . 
*PS04U:	No . 
*PS04Y:	I 'd have dithered and I 'd have got tired and I 'd gone off of . 
*PS04U:	Oh well I think I well I 'll come back off holiday . 
*PS04Y:	That 's right I 'll do it again and I 'll have another go at it . 
*PS04U:	Well I could have spent the whole week I just I just I could have spent five afternoons and it was finished I could have done more I do n't think I would have done Cause I work at cause a couple of weeks ago I thought I God I 'll make an effort I thought . 
*PS04Y:	I think it makes a very big difference knowing that . 
*PS04U:	Yeah without having to think too hard And still you make sure I mean you know for that what I 've spent . 
*PS04Y:	Oh it was well worth . 
*PS04Y:	Oh it was well C . 
*PS04U:	It 's got everybody . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah it was within you budget and you 've done the lot I went over budget but then I expected I would Cause for one thing I was buying for more . 
*PS04U:	Yes You know did you I mean none of us realised you had thirty odd to buy . 
*PS04Y:	But I remember when you said that that last year . 
*PS04U:	Fifty odd I think fifty three Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	And I think the year before years before I 've had something like forty or thirty five In what you might call quiet years . 
*PS04U:	Funny those in Smiths for two pounds off are lovely . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	And the ones we saw in Marks and all that were nothing were they . 
*PS04Y:	And it pays to travel about You see the problem with Jackie and Nev is always been that they ca n't believe that you can get things in a place like W H Smiths that will that will do very nicely as a Christmas present They tend to go always to the top of the . 
*PS04U:	But it does n't pay . 
*PS04Y:	Oh yes yes They go a a Medici shop or Athena or whatever and they 're looking at the best . 
*PS04U:	Well you ca n't afford to . 
*PS04Y:	See Mary Ann and Mitch are giving up on erm buying Christmas presents because she says you 're buying things for people and they everybody 's therefore I think that tokeny things are the best And that 's what I 've bought this year Tokeny things . 
*PS04U:	And is that is that what she 's doing . 
*PS04Y:	They 're buying disposable presents like giving theatre vouchers and erm I do n't know what else but she said disposable things that people can have some fun with . 
*PS04U:	Good idea is n't it Mm . 
*PS04Y:	And what I 'm giving is just something nice in the spirit of Christmas but it has n't broken my bank or my back . 
*PS04U:	Things done in one How these people go week after week after week looking for bargain I mean Chris I mean we picked up some bargains today but how you can go week I mean it 's okay yes but when you 're Christmas shopping you ca n't go for because it 's just . 
*PS04Y:	No no you ca n't . 
*PS04U:	Because it 's just so I mean that C and A is so busy all the it gets it gets so claustrophobic . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm yeah . 
*PS04U:	Look at this traffic coming in now And I think the way we did it we marked down the three shops we wanted to do and make sure you do those three shops . 
*PS04Y:	I do n't think that even though by next year I would be a bit better of in the sense that I should have sold my house bought something cheaper and have some capital invested so that I have a little extra monthly income I should be living in some where that 's cheaper to run . 
*PS04U:	You do n't know you might end up with this this little old chap you 're with . 
*PS04Y:	Oh I would n't mind but I would n't marry anybody . 
*PS04U:	You might live with him . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm on and off You do n't know do you You do n't know . 
*PS04U:	I mean then yes you can buy a smaller even more so then . 
*PS04Y:	Well I would I I mean I intend to keep my own roof whatever Neil can be in it and look after it Yes erm but I do n't think I 'll ever again buy expensive Christmas presents in the way that I did in the past Spending forty and fifty pounds a head on . 
*PS04U:	A head . 
*PS04Y:	for mm . 
*PS04U:	Is n't it Like the gents' track suits and . 
*PS04Y:	Yes No I ca n't er I ca n't think of myself as doing that again . 
*PS04U:	I think it 's it 's like those candies there 's lots of little things you know which people are buying It 's like those bags I mean le I mean I 'd go if they bought me one of those bags . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	You know if er people do n't oh no they 're only one twenty five and you ca n't buy someone that . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	But it 's not not not the issue of it is it . 
*PS04Y:	No no it is n't . 
*PS04U:	Huge . 
*PS04Y:	Mm home people Brenda and I thought Guildford between us Yesterday we bought Camberley . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	Oh yes . 
*PS04U:	thing we got so many of each yes . 
*PS04Y:	A bit cold . 
*PS04U:	Mm Oh ooh . 
*PS04U:	Well I think that 's a good idea though that he 's got boxes from Marks I bet they 'll be a real seller those boxes which No wonder they call them underwear boxes . 
*PS04Y:	Oh yes . 
*PS04U:	If you had to buy a box then the tissue paper then the bow . 
*PS04Y:	Oh I know The time consumed in getting it all in . 
*PS04U:	All I would do with it just to fancy it up you know to buy some of that pink sheering stuff . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	and curl it . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	and just tie it on the top Yeah You 've saved on wrapping paper . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	I 've got to get some petrol I have to get at When did you ask me in Guildford B H S now . 
*PS04Y:	0 . 
*PS04U:	You said it was for a B H S . 
*PS04Y:	That 's right Erm I ca n't It 'll come to me . 
*PS04U:	I like how many of those tops you got on . 
*PS04Y:	I 've only got this one I had a cream one and it got wrecked by going I think Neil put it in the wash with one of his black T-shirts It came out all . 
*PS04U:	Really it 's really flattering top . 
*PS04Y:	It is It 's very soft and easy to wear and . 
*PS04U:	Yeah Erm . 
*PS04Y:	Well I do n't know erm they 're warm They are warm and but it 's colour I do n't know whether I perhaps if I saw cream again this year I might buy it but erm I 'm not sure that I want to when this deep orangy colour I bought a red one in a different style but the same sort of fabric in Benthalls Do you remember When I bought that black and white check skirt . 
*PS04U:	Oh yeah . 
*PS04Y:	I bought a red blouse . 
*PS04U:	You worn that . 
*PS04Y:	Yes but the sleeve the wrong side I 'm picking the sleeve head and trying to get it together And I would have got it together if I 'd had time had gone out to work instead of for days on end being unemployed and sitting and telling me about Karen Honestly Brenda you pay for being nice . 
*PS04U:	Oh but he he said the same things He goes on and . 
*PS04Y:	Of course he does He goes over and over yeah Does n't listen to a word I say Like the woman 's no good Of course I told some things about Wendy But it really made yet more hair fall off the top of his bald head I said fairly bluntly I said look a working woman needs a working man to help support herself and her children I said no nobody is going to be able these days woman not be able to support herself on twenty hours a week which is what Karen does putting out bread in the Asda . 
*PS04U:	Is she the original one then . 
*PS04Y:	She 's the original one . 
*PS04U:	She 's not the one that was coming around with the baby . 
*PS04Y:	No It was Michelle who was coming around with the baby . 
*PS04U:	That 's right . 
*PS04Y:	And I found two pairs of Michelle 's knickers after that and I did n't know what I shou Now I do n't know how they managed this dear because she was coming round in the day with little Donna with her and I was around and there you are you see Indeed love will find a way Anyway erm I said to him look A women needs a man to support her I said mark the chap that she 's got at the moment is taking her out to discos and things and she 'll find that he does n't really want to kick in and help to support her I said she she might well come back to you I said she 's tried to keep you on a string just in case she did n't land the next fish He looked horrified You know as far as he 's concerned it 's all love and glamour . 
*PS04U:	How come she took him back then She did n't want . 
*PS04Y:	Well I think that she was trying to keep him dangling so that she 'd have somebody to fall back on if she did n't land another man . 
*PS04U:	But was n't she sort of playing around with another man . 
*PS04Y:	She is now She is now yes She 's now carrying on . 
*PS04U:	What did he say . 
*PS04Y:	Erm he 's seen the man going in and out of the house She 's told him that she 's got this other man . 
*PS04U:	Cause I can remember him saying before he used to drive round to spy . 
*PS04Y:	Yes Well there is another man and she has told Paul that frankly she 's lapping up the attention He 's taking her out for meals and they 're having a good time together you know Quite strange but as soon as he 's paid for for the goods and got the goods the chap 's going to go off looking for another Yes Cause he does n't want to stay with her But I 've told Paul that if he goes back to Karen and you know takes some his things out Then he takes all of his things out and himself and he never comes back . 
*PS04U:	Is he is he . 
*PS04Y:	I 've had this twice and each time it 's been upheaval because he 's got a lot of goods which had to moved in shoe horned in moved peoples belongings out of one cupboard into another And the second time round it 's been perfect for him because he bought from Karen 's house the Hoover and the saucepans and everything that was his Everything that belonged to him But he said that before I said why was Michelle able to come in between you and Karen He said well Karen had been getting moody He said Karen is getting Paul is boring She 's told Paul that he 's boring What Paul needs is this little girl who does n't care whether a man 's a bit boring . 
*PS04U:	Yes Because I can imagine Paul being sort of a homely chap . 
*PS04Y:	He is . 
*PS04U:	If he gets the right sort . 
*PS04Y:	He is . 
*PS04U:	league with someone who can put up with his sort of . 
*PS04Y:	quietness and . 
*PS04U:	conversation cause he likes to chat and this But I mean . 
*PS04Y:	Yes yes yes He 's a pleasant enough chap . 
*PS04U:	He is is n't he . 
*PS04Y:	Yes But he is not erm a playboy He 's not going to spend money on like Pete was forever buying Pam cheap jewellery from Ratners and erm things of that nature . 
*PS04U:	Did he ever get back with her . 
*PS04Y:	Well she tells me that she 's going to throw Shaun out because Shaun is boring er dun put er Shaun she has no respect for she says because he has n't got a job He wo n't get a job he wo n't work And she said to me what did I think of the idea of taking Pete back Once they were properly divorced taking him back just as er a lover And I said that sounds to me to be a very good idea I said then you 're not at his mercy because anybody to whose at Pete 's mercy will suffer He 's got a very nasty streak He 's got a nasty snide way of putting things . 
*PS04U:	Has he . 
*PS04Y:	Oh yes nasty . 
*PS04U:	But he 's he 's quite fond of her is n't he . 
*PS04Y:	Oh he adores her Oh yes he wants her back And I said she said I you see I know him I said there 's a lot to be said for a chap that you inside out know his ways and how to cope with them but never ever put yourself at his mercy by marrying him And the house will be hers you see when they 're properly divorced It will be in her name So if he starts coming the old soldier she can bung him out . 
*PS04U:	Did she bail herself out in the end with over her money situation . 
*PS04Y:	Oh yeah I went guarantor for that . 
*PS04U:	Oh you had did you have to pay the money Because you . 
*PS04Y:	No no she managed I told her on pain of death not to tell Pete that I was backing . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	erm cause otherwise he would of sat back and said oh Jean can pay that . 
*PS04U:	That 's right . 
*PS04Y:	But she knew that in the last resort that if he did win that I would do it but he 's he 's paid off now As soon as he paid off he went on the dole again He 's quite a gypsy you know he looks like a gypsy Did you meet him . 
*PS04U:	No never met him . 
*PS04Y:	Oh Plausible rogue . 
*PS04U:	My God Look at the queue to get into the car park .
