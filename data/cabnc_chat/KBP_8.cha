@Comment:	conversation #8 (Tape 026602)
*CLA:	The broom.
*NIN:	The broom, yes   (        ) 
*CLA:	Erm 
*NIN:	different coloured broom.
*CLA:	Oh for the back?Yes.
*NIN:	Yes.I think erm   (.) we'll have to have a trip to St Ishmal's for that.
*CLA:	Probably.Where else could we go?
*NIN:	Erm well we do 
*CLA:	Other than that er rather expensive
*NIN:	Well what I, I do like about St Ishmal's is the way it's laid out and   (        ) 
*CLA:	It's laid out but the plants look healthy and they're kept in healthy conditions.
*NIN:	They do.Yeah.
*CLA:	Mhm.To me that Dingle place
*NIN:	I wasn't very struck on that.
*CLA:	I wasn't at all struck, no. (.) 
*NIN:	No I wasn't.
*CLA:	There were all weeds growing among the plants they're selling.
*NIN:	Messy.
*CLA:	Yes, messy.And it wasn't just the messiness, I don't mind that, but
*NIN:	No. (        ) 
*CLA:	They weren't looked after.
*NIN:	cos you   (.) it was difficult to find   (.) the things that you w you want   (.) oh I don't know, it was just
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	it didn't erm didn't appeal to me somehow.
*CLA:	No. (.) 
*NIN:	But erm I remember when we got the original broom that we've got in the garden now, the golden one
*CLA:	Yeah.Where did we get that?
*NIN:	We got that at St Ishmal's.
*CLA:	Did we? (        ) Mm.
*NIN:	And erm   (.) they're sort of labelled, you know what, it gives you this picture of what you're buying as well.
*CLA:	Oh yes.With most of the plants it does, yeah.
*NIN:	Yes cos I want to get the particular one I want
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	to go next to the  (.) 
*CLA:	Well obviously, yeah.
*NIN:	you know, for the effect and erm 
*CLA:	For the for the contrast, yeah.Mm.
*NIN:	I want to know the height
*CLA:	Mhm.
*NIN:	it's going to grow   (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	I think it's er   (.) I think it'll look nice there.
*CLA:	It should look quite attractive.
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	It might be a bit of a job erm   (.) keeping them separate. (        ) growing into one another.
*NIN:	But I don't think so.
*CLA:	No?
*NIN:	Oh no.
*CLA:	Oh.
*NIN:	Well, it doesn't really matter.
*CLA:	Oh that's alright then.Good.
*NIN:	Because I mean they don't sort of grow out, they grow up don't they? (.) 
*CLA:	Yeah, but they do grow out a bit too.I mean the one at twenty seven 
*NIN:	Yes I know but not enough   (.) it wouldn't really matter if   (.) that, a little bit of it  (        ) .
*CLA:	No no.No no no no.
*NIN:	cos that's the idea.
*CLA:	Mm I suppose so, yeah.Mm.
*NIN:	Did you see, you know this last gardener's    (.)  (        ) 
*CLA:	Gardener's World?
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	I haven't really looked at it, no.I glanced very briefly at it but
*NIN:	Where it had er a broom garden?
*CLA:	No I didn't see that.
*NIN:	Oh let's have a look and see if I can find it. (        ) And I thought
*CLA:	Some er excellent photography there you know.
*NIN:	I know. (.) 
*CLA:	Mark you, most of  (        ) 
*NIN:	There's a primula  (        ) 
*CLA:	There's a what?
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) I think that's what they call a cowslip now  (        ) .
*CLA:	I've no idea. (        ) 
*NIN:	 ((laugh))  (        )  (.) 
*CLA:	 (        ) Saturday or Sunday?
*NIN:	Saturday. (.) You know where I've put   (.) you know down the bottom end of the garden,th that little bit of digging? (.) To shape the ga er where the grass is?Right up in front of the sweetpeas? (.) 
*CLA:	Erm   (.) the left or the right?
*NIN:	Right down at the bottom there by the apple tree. (.) 
*CLA:	Do you mean where the daffs are going? (        ) 
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Yes.Oh yes.
*NIN:	 (        ) yes but   (.) on the side.
*CLA:	Oh there you mean, not at the bottom, at the side.
*NIN:	Where I've just dug.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	Where I've just dug there.And I said I'd put sweetpeas?
*CLA:	Mm.Mm. (.) Yeah?
*NIN:	I was wondering whether to   (.) put some   (.) fuchsia. (.) Because I've got some fu   (        ) 
*CLA:	Haven't we got some   (        ) towards this end? (.) Perhaps   (        ) 
*NIN:	Yes we've got got s I've got loads in, in flowerpot, in these big containers.And I 
*CLA:	Oh I see.
*NIN:	I'm just stumped where to put them.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	I don't want to keep them in containers.
*CLA:	If it's an evergreen, no it's not is it?
*NIN:	Fuchsia?
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	No.Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	No, they die down   (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	Most of the ones that we brought seem to have erm
*CLA:	Survived.
*NIN:	Survived.Which I'm glad.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	Because we've got some nice ones.And then those that Karen brought us, they were nice.
*CLA:	Yes.Yeah.
*NIN:	Got some lovely ones.
*CLA:	Mhm. (.) 
*NIN:	Well I thought they'd be   (.) protected by the fence.
*CLA:	Yeah. (.) Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Wouldn't have much room for sweetpeas though would I?I don't know though, they'd grow up behind wouldn't they? (.) 
*CLA:	Yes.Course they will, yeah.Mm.
*NIN:	The only problem being cutting the hedge.
*CLA:	 (        ) Pardon?
*NIN:	The only problem being cutting the hedge.
*CLA:	Cutting the hedge?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Oh yeah.
*NIN:	But
*CLA:	But how often do you have to cut that sort of hedge then?
*NIN:	Not a lot.
*CLA:	Not like a privet  (        ) .Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	 (        ) if I can find   (.) erm   (.) I can't   (.) I remember Carolyn bringing that, you know that little er the   (        ) anemone?
*CLA:	No?
*NIN:	And we didn't know what it was. (        ) 
*CLA:	Er all I can remember   (        ) a lot of plants coming.
*NIN:	Yes well
*CLA:	But I can't remember  (        ) 
*NIN:	I remember that   (.) in a little pot   (.) down there and   (.) you know they were labelled?She put the labels on.
*CLA:	Oh yes she did, a label mhm.
*NIN:	Well I'm sure I remember the anemone blander 
*CLA:	Mm.I don't know.Oh I see   (        ) 
*NIN:	And I think I planted it  (.) 
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	and it nothing s , it didn't seem to survive.
*CLA:	Mhm.
*NIN:	And I was reading about the conditions.Maybe with erm   (.) erm putting fertiliser on them   (.) you know
*CLA:	Mhm.Mm.
*NIN:	erm  (        ) 
*CLA:	Mhm.
*NIN:	I think it   (        ) and it's come up  (        ) 
*CLA:	Ah!
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) Well, good o.
*NIN:	It looks quite pretty now but it could be quite  (        ) .
*CLA:	Well  (        ) .
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) Yeah, true.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) I've come across a bit of architrave by the way.Quite apart from 
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	 (        ) .Erm   (.)  (        ) .So I can use that as an experimental piece.
*NIN:	Where? (        ) 
*CLA:	 (        ) , there's stuff   (.) come to think of it it's the one in the hall.The doorway that's bricked up.Yeah.
*NIN:	Oh of course.I keep forgetting there was a doorway there   [laughing] when we arrived  [] .
*CLA:	Yeah.That's right. (        ) the architrave from there.
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	Erm   (.) it's exactly the same varnish stain as this.
*NIN:	Is it?
*CLA:	So I can muck about on that piece before I   (.) tackle it in here, so   (.) mm. (        ) stripping goes.
*NIN:	Oh I see what you mean.To to er see 
*CLA:	Without staining, without   (        ) what?
*NIN:	Mm that's true.To see if w what colour we can get that we like instead of this?
*CLA:	Yeah.Yeah.That's right.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	First of all   (.) what's the best stripping medium.Whether it's gonna be gentle heat, whether it's gonna be   (.) varnish stripper?Paint stripper?What the hell. (.) And then see the   (.) go on.
*NIN:	Er w do you have to strip it?
*CLA:	If we want to change the colour.Unless we're going to use a varnish stain as such.But it's very, and it looks a bit crummy, that stuff I always think.
*NIN:	Ooh   ((laugh))  (        ) .Ooh well I don't know, (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.See look at 
*NIN:	It's a big area.
*CLA:	Pardon?
*NIN:	It's a big area to strip.Why, wouldn't it
*CLA:	Well it's only what   (.) erm the architrave   (.) the arch there   (.) this side, that side and that one there.
*NIN:	Well I mean if you had it sort of darker, wouldn't it stain darker slightly?
*CLA:	Well as I say you can't stain varnished wood Nina.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	You can put a varnish stain on.Varnish stain   (        ) but erm   (.) In   (.) in this particular light now I can see   (.) where they've put on thick blodges that run down.
*NIN:	I know, it's terrible isn't it?
*CLA:	Mm. (        ) 
*NIN:	I wouldn't think that was a professional job.
*CLA:	Oh what was?I don't think  (        ) .
*NIN:	But   (.) well originally what would they have done with it?When it was built?
*CLA:	Oh no I don't think, I don't think it's from square one.It probably would be varnished from square one but that's not the original varnish.
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	Shouldn't think, no.
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	I doubt it very much indeed.
*NIN:	shocking colour   (        ) isn't it?
*CLA:	Yes it is.And do you know the old bog door, it's the same colour as next door's.Or was I should say.
*NIN:	Was it?
*CLA:	The same yucky blue, yeah  (        ) .
*NIN:	Was it?
*CLA:	Mm.So   (.) if you look at the   (.) next time you're in the loo
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	where the handle was, look where the blue   (.) shows.And that's that was the original colour.
*NIN:	That w do you think that's what they did originally?
*CLA:	Yeah.The original colour, yeah.
*NIN:	Mm   (        ) when it was built?
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	 (        ) blue didn't they?
*CLA:	It might of course have been a more acceptable blue when it was put on because it changes 
*NIN:	Do you remember that er flat that Lil and Nev er went into?
*CLA:	Oh goodness.
*NIN:	Before they
*CLA:	Oh down here  (        ) ?
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	Where?
*NIN:	They've not been in a flat   (        ) 
*CLA:	Oh Prestwych 
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	Yes. (        ) 
*NIN:	Well when, yes where they rented when they sold theirs 
*CLA:	Yeah, yeah.
*NIN:	and were waiting for their other house up here to be finished.
*CLA:	Paid a fortune for the damn  (        ) .Yeah.
*NIN:	Well    (.)  [laughing] that was all blue, do you remember  [] ?
*CLA:	No.I only remember one 
*NIN:	Because when I   (.) when I went to see Lil
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	er spent the day with her
*CLA:	Yeah yeah.
*NIN:	and I hadn't seen the flat before, and the first thing she said to me   ((laugh)) wherever you look in here it's blue.And it was too.
*CLA:	Was it really?
*NIN:	Yes.Er it   (        ) 
*CLA:	Well how do you mean?The paintwork was blue?
*NIN:	Everything, yes.Paint, decorations, everything.
*CLA:	What  (        ) ?
*NIN:	Well n 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	not every not every exactly everything but
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	as you got, went into the flat you got an overall   (.) picture of blue.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	Everywhere you looked was blue.
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*NIN:	I find blue a depressing colour even though I like blue.I mean I 
*CLA:	Well it's   (        ) isn't it?Blue for depression and red for excitement and
*NIN:	Yes but
*CLA:	What's a calming colour? (        ) 
*NIN:	For a decoration in a home I don't like blue.
*CLA:	No, no.
*NIN:	And yet young Nicky's gone for blue.Blue   (        ) 
*CLA:	Well it's a change from black that  (        ) . ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	Well yes they've got the black furniture you know 
*CLA:	They've got the furniture   (        ) of course, yes.That's true.
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	Some of it looks nice, but   (.) I wouldn't like  (        ) 
*CLA:	Well it'll   (.) die the death eventually won't it?I mean the stripped pine   (        ) really horrible. (.) 
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Isn't it?
*NIN:	Yes, well I think   (.) I think it's overdone.
*CLA:	Course it's overdone.
*NIN:	I like a bit but
*CLA:	It's blooming cheap half of it.It is cheap. (.) Er no it isn't cheap  (        ) .
*NIN:	 (        ) cheap.
*CLA:	God no.
*NIN:	I wouldn't say that. (.) 
*CLA:	Cheaper than  (        ) 
*NIN:	It's a bit glaring to me.I find it so, it's not as mellow as I like.
*CLA:	No, it's not. (        ) . It's usually crummy wood.Badly assembled. (.) 
*NIN:	Well it   [laughing] depends how much you're going to pay for your furniture   [] doesn't it really?
*CLA:	Well I mean the one that er   (        ) that er thing, what is it?
*NIN:	They paid a lot for that didn't they?
*CLA:	It's it's rubbish, that thing.
*NIN:	Is it?
*CLA:	It's rubbish.Absolute rubbish.It really is cos 
*NIN:	Mm.I'm not struck on   (        ) 
*CLA:	they moved it out when we went on one occasion cos   (.) was the carpet wet or something?I don't know.They moved it out for something   (        ) reason so   (.) I had occasion to look at it more closely.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	I thought, I was looking at it before, I thought mm. (.) Anyway   (.) it drew my attention to it and I thought god god. (.) Mm   (.) it might be fashionable but phoo   (.) Incidentally I wasn't far out with th the age of our friend across the road was I?
*NIN:	No.No.
*CLA:	Twenty four.I thought he was about that.Mm. (.) Bit like Eric's place in a way   (.)  (        ) .
*NIN:	Oh never!Wonder how he is.
*CLA:	Mm well no.Not in that se pardon?
*NIN:	I wonder how he is 
*CLA:	Eric?I don't know I wonder.
*NIN:	and whether he's still going. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Oh probably, yeah.
*NIN:	 [laughing] Probably  [] .
*CLA:	Floating with his beer every afternoon, yeah. ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) He's a funny old stick wasn't he?
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	Wonder whether he got anywhere with the ?Seemed to make a beeline for his place didn't they?
*CLA:	Mm.Most probably he got   (        ) waffling on   (        ) in the Royal Oak and that.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Gave the impression   (        ) I think.Mm. (.) I can't see our friend er what was his name?The chap that bought our house? (.) 
*NIN:	Oh   (.) god
*CLA:	The probation officer anyway   (        ) 
*NIN:	.
*CLA:	.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	 ((cough)) Erm   (.) I can't see him   (.) him getting very   (.) chummy with Eric can you?
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) No.
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	 [laughing] Nor Eric getting chummy with   []  (.) 
*CLA:	No.Well he'd try, initially.He did try.
*NIN:	I know.
*CLA:	Oh yeah. (.) Mm.He's a soft touch for everybody else.
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Mm. (.) Mm. (.) He always meant very well though, Eric, in a lot of ways.He couldn't help being a simple soul could he? [laughing] Simple soul. (        )  [] .
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) No.No.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) He used to swear blind he saw his mother standing at the end of the bed.
*NIN:	He   (.) Eric did?
*CLA:	Yeah.He'd seen his mother sat at the end of the bed   (.) ages after she was dead, you know.
*NIN:	Oh   (        ) 
*CLA:	Oh yeah.
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	Yeah.He was quite genuine.He wasn't mm. (.) Mm I think that was when his had auntie died, he'd seen his mother. (.)  (        ) 
*NIN:	When his auntie died?
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Oh that's going back a bit isn't it?
*CLA:	I know yes.Oh yes.
*NIN:	 [laughing] He didn't see   [] his auntie as well then? ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) No I don't think so.I don't know I'm sure but he never mentioned it anyway.
*NIN:	I don't remem erm his   (.) I don't remember his mother. (.) Only
*CLA:	 ((sigh)) I've got a very hazy, but I could be confusing it   (.) her with one of the other relatives   (        ) 
*NIN:	I think   (.) she was ill when
*CLA:	Was she short, dumpy   (.) podgy sort of thing and?
*NIN:	Well no, I don't know.I don't remember  (        ) .
*CLA:	Oh I, neither do I. (        ) 
*NIN:	What did?
*CLA:	Auntie  (        ) 
*NIN:	Oh auntie was only small, similar to to Eric.Well about the same size as nan really.
*CLA:	Yeah. (.) So it could have been his auntie, his mother   (.) I don't know. (.) I wonder if John and   (.) John and er mm
*NIN:	Liz.
*CLA:	Liz have moved yet.
*NIN:	Well we thought they had last time we went.Do you remember?
*CLA:	Oh yes, I vaguely remember that but I, whether they'd actually moved or not I don't know.
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	I wonder what had happened to the stool.
*CLA:	 [laughing] Which stool  [] ?
*NIN:	Th do you remember   (.) er who was going to, oh I don't    (.)  (        ) it was the store that Robin made.
*CLA:	Oh the tall stool Robin made?Yes yes.
*NIN:	Yes.And Rob and   (.) John and Liz were   (.) hanging on to it    (        )  (.) somebody was going to pick it up weren't they?
*CLA:	 (        ) actually.
*NIN:	 [laughing] I've forgotten  [] .
*CLA:	I don't know!It was a state of chaos then though wasn't it?
*NIN:	Well   [laughing] I wouldn't like to move, we are not moving again   (        )  [] .
*CLA:	Oh god no.
*NIN:	No way.
*CLA:	Never again. ((laugh)) Well if we do we'll wait another sixty years anyway.
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) Mm.
*NIN:	Oh what an upheaval.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	I don't know how people can   (.) move from one place to another.Do the place up then
*CLA:	Well
*NIN:	move over to another place.Oh heck, no thank you.
*CLA:	it depends on a lot of factors really doesn't it?
*NIN:	Mm  ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Or a lot of factors come into it. (.) Age group   (.) finances 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	desire to move   (.) for a variety of reasons, erm      (.)  ((sigh))  (.)  (        ) permanently regarded   (        ) house in the first place, you know?
*NIN:	Mm I mean like in Jill's case, Jill and Steve
*CLA:	Yes, that always struck me as a bit odd, yes.
*NIN:	I it's a big upheaval every few years isn't it
*CLA:	Yeah.Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	to have to do it with your job?
*CLA:	Yeah. (.) Mm.
*NIN:	And it's worse when you've got children to cope with as well.
*CLA:	That and the obvious school problem too with the kids, yeah.
*NIN:	Mm.I don't think it's good for them moving them about from school to school do you?
*CLA:	No it can't be. (.) Well I don't know about that, I mean with some schools it'd be a good idea to get them away from it.
*NIN:	Well  ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	And some areas, in fact.I mean    (        )  (.) really desirable to move away from there wasn't it?
*NIN:	Er well that's true.
*CLA:	Mm.And privately it would be no bad thing to move away from where they are now.I mean, well they're gonna have problems wherever they go, but   (.) the   (.) on erm   (.) a different estate   (.) different type of estate, they wouldn't have as many problems would they?
*NIN:	Mm I don't know so much.
*CLA:	I don't think so.Not as many. (.) 
*NIN:	I've found out how to get rid of the cat scratching.
*CLA:	No   (.) another idea?What is it this time?
*NIN:	No, it's not my idea.Apparently you can get 
*CLA:	No, no?
*NIN:	pellets of   (.) er lion dung   ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 [laughing] Oh I, yes  [] .Don't you remember erm
*NIN:	 [laughing] Oh dear  [] .
*CLA:	somebody on Gardener's Question Time answering that?
*NIN:	I didn't know you could get it in pellets.
*CLA:	 [laughing] Well either did I but  [] 
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Yes   (        ) 
*NIN:	Although although inoffensive to people, cats dislike   (.) the scent and avoid 
*CLA:	 [laughing] For obvious reasons, yeah  [] .
*NIN:	Mm.We'll try that.
*CLA:	Yes.
*NIN:	Materials cause no ill effects to plants   ((laugh)) soil or your own pets.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) How much er    [laughing]  (        )  [] ?
*NIN:	It doesn't say. ((laugh))
