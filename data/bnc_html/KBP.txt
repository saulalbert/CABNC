Unknown speaker (KBPPSUNK) [1] and you switch it on before they arrive.

Clarence (PS065)           [4] Yes, exactly.
                           [5] Yeah.
                           [6] Yeah.
                           [7] But no it, it doesn't bother me.
                           [8] I don't mind you know on camera, I don't mind
                           being on video, anything.
Lil (PS068)                [9] But in fairness to your friends Larry, you can
                           hardly

Nina (PS066)     [21] I don't know but well I remember going out ... shopping
                 and when I came back you'd got
Clarence (PS065) [22] Jill.
Nina (PS066)     [23] you'd gone out.
                 [24] No they were, they were all of them there.
Clarence (PS065) [25] Were they?
Nina (PS066)     [26] Nan and I were out shopping.
                 [27] When we got back
Clarence (PS065) [28] Mm?
Nina (PS066)     [29] ... it was christmas shopping I think.
Clarence (PS065) [30] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [31] Anyway ... you'd been out and bought one of those m
                 packets of m cake mix.
Clarence (PS065) [32] [laughing] Oh it would be ready mixed, yes [] .
Nina (PS066)     [33] [laugh] Well ... and they'd made little buns.
                 [34] [laugh] They were very nice really. ...
Clarence (PS065) [35] Oh it's a tribute to the
Nina (PS066)     [36] The state of the kitchen wasn't. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [37] Well ... that'll be a tribute to the manufacturer, sure.
                 [38] Mm well I rem
Nina (PS066)     [39] And Robin and L and erm ... Carol doing that er cabbage
                 ... cabbage
Clarence (PS065) [40] Oh that revolting
Nina (PS066)     [41] That was horrible.
Clarence (PS065) [42] That was terrible.
                 [43] ... I remember Jill though.
                 [44] I don't remember the mix but mm I don't know that, I
                 vaguely remember now, yes but
Nina (PS066)     [45] Oh they were all there
Clarence (PS065) [46] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [47] because we'd gone out, I think it was the christmas
                 shopping we were doing on our own.
Clarence (PS065) [48] Was it?
Nina (PS066)     [49] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [50] Mm.
                 [51] Yes I've got a hazy recollection but [...] .
                 [52] Mm.
                 [53] ... Jill'll remember.
                 [54] But she was a lot younger surely, Jill?
                 [55] And she'd be a bit
Nina (PS066)     [56] Oh she'd be young, erm
Clarence (PS065) [57] Younger than them I mean.
Nina (PS066)     [58] They weren't, oh they were younger than Carol Caroline
                 and erm Ken.
Clarence (PS065) [59] Mm mm mm.
                 [60] ... Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [61] But then ... look at Chris.
                 [62] He must have been interested in cooking, mustn't he?
Clarence (PS065) [63] I don't [...] Chris
Nina (PS066)     [64] No I think the young fellows today are more because of
                 course they go into the flats don't they?
Clarence (PS065) [65] Mm well that's true of course.
Nina (PS066)     [66] I remember when Mike and Robin went into their flats I
                 ... spent quite a long time with them
Clarence (PS065) [67] Yeah I know.
                 [68] Mm.
                 [69] Mm.
                 [70] Mhm.
Nina (PS066)     [71] Showing them how to do simple dishes.
Clarence (PS065) [72] Mhm.
                 [73] ... But erm ... quite frankly I can't see myself ever
                 getting ... given the same sort of circumstances.
Nina (PS066)     [74] Well n no.
Clarence (PS065) [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [75] I can't either.
                 [76] [laughing] Knowing you I [] ... no it's laughable.
Clarence (PS065) [77] Yeah. ...
Nina (PS066)     [78] Can't imagine you meeting me with a nice cooked dinner
                 and a ... a cake [laughing] made by yo your own fair
Clarence (PS065) [79] [...] No I
Nina (PS066)     [80] with a candle on [] .
Clarence (PS065) [81] No.
                 [82] ... Use a soldering iron or a blow lamp or something, not
                 [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [83] [laugh] ... Burnt toast.
Clarence (PS065) [84] Ah no, it's not really burnt, it's the way I like it
                 though.
                 [85] Must admit technically
Nina (PS066)     [86] Well it used to smoke. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [87] Well yes technically speaking I suppose it is burnt but
                 ... well done I [...]
Nina (PS066)     [88] Well it doesn't taste very nice.
Clarence (PS065) [89] I can't agree cos I, that's how I like it.
Nina (PS066)     [90] And the s Well you used to scrape some of it off because
                 it was all over the [...]
Clarence (PS065) [91] Oh if it gets really charred I know but
Nina (PS066)     [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [92] if it's really charred that's a bit
Nina (PS066)     [laugh] ...
Clarence (PS065) [93] Certain degree of grey blackness even but ...
Nina (PS066)     [94] And how d'you get toast ... charred so that you've got to
                 scrape it off but it isn't burnt?
                 [95] Oh I [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [96] Well leaving it that little bit too long, you know.
Nina (PS066)     [...] ...
Clarence (PS065) [97] [laughing] Remember Ro Robin coming home ... [...] I
                 don't believe it, burnt ... burnt toast [] from an electric
                 toaster.
                 [98] I don't know how he does it. [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [99] I don't know. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [100] [laugh] ... Mm.
                 [101] ... Oh well.
                 [102] ... Doesn't feel like Sunday [...] does it?
Nina (PS066)     [103] No.
                 [104] ... I've not seen any more sight of that heron.
Clarence (PS065) [105] No.
Nina (PS066)     [106] I don't, I think it was just a flash in the pan.
Clarence (PS065) [107] I don't think, well.
Nina (PS066)     [108] I don't think ... I'm certain there's not
Clarence (PS065) [109] I think it's much to do about nothing quite honestly.
Nina (PS066)     [110] I do. ...
Clarence (PS065) [111] I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some
                 sort of er
Nina (PS066)     [112] Well I don't feel like having a plastic heron. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [113] Well I mean how do all the rest of the pond they've not
                 all got bloody herons, plastic herons perched on the side have
                 they?
Nina (PS066)     [114] No.
Clarence (PS065) [115] Plastic [...]
Nina (PS066)     [116] But you know d'you remember me going round the corner
                 and seeing that erm ...
Clarence (PS065) [117] Mm.
                 [118] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [119] [...] pond with all those plastic ducks on?
Clarence (PS065) [120] Flipping ducks on it.
                 [121] Yeah I know.
Nina (PS066)     [122] That might have been some ... deterrent of some
                 description.
Clarence (PS065) [123] I don't think so somehow.
                 [124] That was just [...]
Nina (PS066)     [125] [laugh] but I'm n I'm certainly not having little
                 plastic ducks
Clarence (PS065) [126] Art nouveau.
Nina (PS066)     [127] and ... little gnomes about.
Clarence (PS065) [128] Mm.
                 [129] ... That's interesting er ... that erm ... comment Steve
                 made about the ... postcard.
                 [130] And the bird of prey silhouette, you know?
                 [131] I can
Nina (PS066)     [132] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [133] believe that being ... rather effective.
Nina (PS066)     [134] Well actually I have read about the heron that er I
                 think was it ... I'm not sure that [...]
Clarence (PS065) [135] What the plastic [laugh] plastic heron [...] ?
Nina (PS066)     [136] Oh [...] yes.
Clarence (PS065) [137] Mm.
                 [138] ... Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [139] No way. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [140] Mm.
                 [141] ... But that silhouette business, that could work you
                 know.
Nina (PS066)     [142] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [143] I can see that working.
                 [144] ... Birds of prey.
Nina (PS066)     [145] Well ... really when you think, it's only the same way
                 as ... er laying the hose amongst your flower beds.
                 [146] For cats.
Clarence (PS065) [147] Oh the snake you mean?
                 [148] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [149] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [150] Mm ... I've still to have that proved to me to be
                 honest.
                 [151] It's a damn great snake
Nina (PS066)     [152] Well I have.
Clarence (PS065) [153] isn't it?
                 [154] If you think about it.
Nina (PS066)     [155] Yes.
                 [156] Well I think ... well, you know when we used to leave
                 ours across the, the lawn there?
Clarence (PS065) [157] Mm, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [158] Well S
Clarence (PS065) [159] Cat didn't bother.
Nina (PS066)     [160] Samba no he
Clarence (PS065) [161] No.
Nina (PS066)     [162] Well he did a he did for a bit.
Clarence (PS065) [163] Are you sure?
Nina (PS066)     [164] [...] Yes, I've watched him sort of er ... warily
Clarence (PS065) [165] Waiting
Nina (PS066)     [166] walk round.
                 [167] But then he got so used to it that he didn't bother.
Clarence (PS065) [168] Mm, yeah.
                 [169] That's what I mean.
                 [170] It may, if it's any effect at all it's very short lived
                 I think.
Nina (PS066)     [171] Mm.
                 [172] I don't think pepper's a very useful deterrent.
                 [173] I've sprinkled loads of
Clarence (PS065) [174] No.
Nina (PS066)     [175] pepper round.
Clarence (PS065) [176] One shower of rain and you've lost it anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [177] Mm. ...
Clarence (PS065) [178] I'd have thought.
                 [179] ... Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [180] I think the only deterrent is putting ... netting or
                 something over it but er
Clarence (PS065) [181] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [182] you can't put netting over your whole garden can you?
                 [183] It's silly.
Clarence (PS065) [184] No no.
                 [185] ... We'll have to watch that pond though [...] ...
                 leaves next year.
Nina (PS066)     [186] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [187] Well this year of course.
                 [188] [...] ... Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [189] Well I can't really see what you can do, only have
                 netting over that when the leaves start to fall.
Clarence (PS065) [190] Well yes [cough] I could be a little bit more erm ...
                 atten [cough] attentive to the damn thing couldn't I?
                 [191] ... We need to sca scrape quite a lot of that out but
                 erm ... not all by any means.
                 [192] ... See a certain percentage have blown in I think off
                 the grass and if I had some sort of a
Nina (PS066)     [193] I was just er yeah.
                 [194] I was just gonna say that.
Clarence (PS065) [195] Mm.
                 [196] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [197] I think our problem here is it gets so windy with being
                 on the corner.
Clarence (PS065) [198] Mm.
                 [199] Mm.
                 [200] ... Yeah. ...
Nina (PS066)     [201] D'you want any more tea?
Clarence (PS065) [202] Oh yes please.
                 [203] But I think ... mm ... mm.
Nina (PS066)     [204] That was a silly question wasn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [205] It was unnecessary wasn't it? ... [...] oh yes I'll want
                 a bit of a hand then.
                 [206] With ... the top window
Nina (PS066)     [207] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [208] I've left it with two screws holding it at the moment.
                 [209] As we did, [...] painting the outside yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [210] Yes.
                 [211] I it won't blow out though?
Clarence (PS065) [212] No not at all.
                 [213] I'm gonna hold it while you take the two final screws
                 out.
Nina (PS066)     [214] Oh I see. [...] ?
Clarence (PS065) [215] [cough] Yeah.
                 [216] [cough] Cos it's almost impossible to get at it. ...
                 [cough] ...
Nina (PS066)     [217] It won't erm ... I think
Clarence (PS065) [218] What?
Nina (PS066)     [219] once you've got the window done it won't be too bad will
                 it?
Clarence (PS065) [220] You mean the whole frame?
Nina (PS066)     [221] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [222] And the opening light?
Nina (PS066)     [223] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [224] It won't be too bad, will it?
Nina (PS066)     [225] Oh I mean, what I mean is you've not
Clarence (PS065) [226] Well there's not a tremendous amount of burning left.
                 [227] There's only ... one skirting board [clears throat] and
                 the pipe cover.
Nina (PS066)     [228] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [229] The casing round the other cupboard.
Nina (PS066)     [230] Mm. ...
Clarence (PS065) [231] And that's it I think.
                 [232] And possibly the edges of the cupboard doors, I don't
                 know.
Nina (PS066)     [233] Yes, they're not very brilliant.
Clarence (PS065) [234] No.
                 [235] ... Mm certainly want cleaning up.
                 [236] I may end up taking them off completely though.
                 [237] [cough] I think that may be easier to do [cough] rather
                 than do them in situ, you know? ... [...] ... [sigh]
Nina (PS066)     [238] Are you going to have a piece of cake?
Clarence (PS065) [239] Oh yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [240] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [241] He's done this in two ... and then sandwiched them
                 together.
Clarence (PS065) [242] What two cakes and put them together, he's?
Nina (PS066)     [243] Yes.
                 [244] Well I used to do that.
Clarence (PS065) [245] Mm. ... [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [246] It's quite good though.
Clarence (PS065) [247] Mm.
                 [248] I'm trying to remember, did they have any, the kids?
Nina (PS066)     [249] Erm
Clarence (PS065) [250] I know they cut some for them but ...
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [251] It's a wonder Caroline didn't. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [252] No.
Nina (PS066)     [253] She usually stuffs doesn't she?
Clarence (PS065) [254] Mm.
                 [255] Well yes. ... [...]
Nina (PS066)     [256] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [...]
Nina (PS066)     [257] Did Jill say what time Caroline's appointment was?
Clarence (PS065) [258] No.
                 [259] Er well ... not to me she didn't.
Nina (PS066)     [260] No well.
                 [261] She pro she might have done to me but I can't remember.
Clarence (PS065) [262] In the afternoon.
                 [263] ... They seem very confident they'll be back in time
                 don't they?
Nina (PS066)     [264] Twenty five to four to meet ... young
Clarence (PS065) [265] Yeah.
                 [266] Pick him up at twenty five to four. ...
Nina (PS066)     [267] There's a heck of a lot of burning off when you come to
                 think of all the burning off of paint we're going to have to
                 do.
Clarence (PS065) [268] Oh god I know.
                 [269] You're telling me. [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [270] But then
Clarence (PS065) [271] Where possible I'll sand down obviously but there's ...
                 there
Nina (PS066)     [272] Yes but usually
Clarence (PS065) [273] won't be many places I'd have thought.
Nina (PS066)     [274] There isn't.
                 [275] It's
Clarence (PS065) [276] No.
Nina (PS066)     [277] Cos it's been piled on so
Clarence (PS065) [278] Yeah.
                 [279] I can't get over that screw in the woodwork.
Nina (PS066)     [280] I know!
Clarence (PS065) [281] Good god.
                 [282] I've seen dust before but ... and bits of fluff and rag
                 and stuff but I've never seen a bloody, and a nail ... damn
                 great screw!
Nina (PS066)     [283] Well it's the same as the, the way they've papered the
                 walls round.
                 [284] They've just papered over things.
                 [285] You know?
Clarence (PS065) [286] They've papered over, [laughing] I know [] .
                 [287] I know.
                 [288] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [289] It wouldn't have been, if they'd had any furniture in
                 when we, when we first got in ... I wouldn't have been
                 surprised to see it painted round there as well. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [290] Oh the [...] you mean?
                 [291] Oh aye.
Nina (PS066)     [292] [...] mm.
Clarence (PS065) [293] Mm.
                 [294] ... Mm.
                 [295] ... No, coming back to the [clears throat] [...] .
                 [296] ... I would prefer to keep it in natural wood if we can
                 but
Nina (PS066)     [297] Oh yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [298] all those splodges of white ... are putty.
Nina (PS066)     [299] Are they?
Clarence (PS065) [300] Mm.
                 [301] Unfortunately. ...
Nina (PS066)     [302] And there's nothing at all you can cover them with?
Clarence (PS065) [303] Well ... except to take them out.
                 [304] Scrape the bits of putty out ... [...] ... and put some
                 ... filler in that will accept stain.
Nina (PS066)     [305] I think that'd be better.
Clarence (PS065) [306] Mm.
                 [307] But that's a [laughing] fairly long [] job though.
Nina (PS066)     [308] Er yes, but I mean it it ... it would be worth it. ...
Clarence (PS065) [309] Mm.
                 [310] ... See it won't accept stain anyway ... with that
                 varnish on.
Nina (PS066)     [311] Well I don't like this colour stain anyway.
Clarence (PS065) [312] Well I don't.
Nina (PS066)     [313] It's a nasty colour.
Clarence (PS065) [314] You can't burn that off though.
                 [315] It's dust.
Nina (PS066)     [316] You couldn't
Clarence (PS065) [317] What?
Nina (PS066)     [318] just give a dab of paint over?
                 [319] A dark paint.
Clarence (PS065) [320] It'd stand out a mile wouldn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [321] Would it?
Clarence (PS065) [322] Well ... perhaps not as ... obviously
Nina (PS066)     [323] Well if you did it with a small brush?
Clarence (PS065) [324] Well it would still stand out wouldn't it cos it's a
                 different colour?
                 [325] Mm.
                 [326] Not as
Nina (PS066)     [327] You don't
Clarence (PS065) [328] not as obvious perhaps as the white but
Nina (PS066)     [329] That's what I mean.
Clarence (PS065) [330] Mm.
                 [331] Mm.
                 [332] ... But I'll have to get rid of all that varnish before
                 it'll take any other stain.
Nina (PS066)     [333] Mm.
                 [334] See what it's like. ...
Clarence (PS065) [335] I ... what it's like when?
Nina (PS066)     [336] When you've got rid of the varnish.
Clarence (PS065) [337] Mm.
                 [338] I may have to use varnish stripper.
                 [339] Get a kind of varnish stripper for it.
Nina (PS066)     [340] Well it might be better than erm ... doing it any other
                 way because
Clarence (PS065) [341] I don't think it'll burn off. ...
Nina (PS066)     [342] No I'm thinking of the fumes. ...
Clarence (PS065) [343] [laugh] ... After all the other fumes I don't think
                 that'll matter.
Nina (PS066)     [344] After what?
Clarence (PS065) [345] After the fumes of the paintwork, I don't think that'll
                 ...
Nina (PS066)     [346] Won't that be worse than [...] ?
Clarence (PS065) [347] No.
                 [348] Not as bad as.
                 [349] No no.
Nina (PS066)     [350] Oh.
                 [351] ... Cos I remember when you did twenty seven.
Clarence (PS065) [352] Mm.
                 [353] Ah well that was a varnish paint.
Nina (PS066)     [354] That was quite
Clarence (PS065) [355] That was a varnish paint.
Nina (PS066)     [356] And that won't, that'll just be ... [...] stain?
Clarence (PS065) [357] Varnish.
                 [358] No.
                 [359] It is a stain varnish.
                 [360] ... [...] ... In other words varnish, with a stain added
                 to the varnish before you apply it.
Nina (PS066)     [361] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [362] As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it
                 with
Nina (PS066)     [363] Oh I see.
Clarence (PS065) [364] relatively clear varnish. ...
Nina (PS066)     [365] Mm.
                 [366] ... Once we've got those tiles off at the bottom there
Clarence (PS065) [367] Mm?
Nina (PS066)     [368] well we might as well paint [...]
Clarence (PS065) [369] Well I think, I mean they're very nice, it would rather,
                 I'd prefer to, it would be nice to have ... tile there to
                 break it [...] , but not those damn things and they certainly
                 won't come off and go back. ...
Nina (PS066)     [370] They're a bit messy aren't they?
Clarence (PS065) [371] Mm.
                 [372] ... One two three four five six seven eight, twenty
                 four.
                 [373] Two dozen.
                 [374] ... Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [375] How many did we get in the pack?
Clarence (PS065) [376] The pack.
                 [377] I don't know [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [378] I think it was twenty five.
Clarence (PS065) [379] I really don't know.
                 [380] Oh it varies, the pack doesn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [381] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [382] Think it is twenty five actually.
                 [383] [...] pack anyway [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [384] But erm ... finding the right tile [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [385] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [386] In any case you don't want them all the same do you?
                 [387] I think we're better off just snapping it off.
                 [388] Wonder what state the wall's in?
Clarence (PS065) [389] Doesn't really matter all that much.
                 [390] I'd skim over the plaster anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [391] Mm.
                 [392] Be a right mess won't it?
Clarence (PS065) [393] Mm.
                 [394] ... It's highly probable I'll finish up skimming anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [395] Mm I was just thinking that.
Clarence (PS065) [396] [...] mm.
Nina (PS066)     [397] I mean the way, what have they done here? ...
Clarence (PS065) [398] [laugh] Well what have they done anywhere?
                 [399] ... Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [400] Well they ran short of tiles or they ha they wouldn't be
                 bothered cutting.
                 [401] I bet
Clarence (PS065) [402] That's more likely the case.
                 [403] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [404] One two three four [...]
Clarence (PS065) [405] Twenty four.
Nina (PS066)     [406] five six seven eight ...
Clarence (PS065) [407] Twenty four on this front face wasn't there?
Nina (PS066)     [408] Yes, there was three more there.
Clarence (PS065) [409] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [410] So that ma er in any case they'd of got ... some of it
                 being the two colours.
Clarence (PS065) [411] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [412] It looks quite effective [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [413] Oh it's quite effective if it's done correctly, yes.
                 [414] ... As it is now it's bloody awful.
Nina (PS066)     [415] Have you had some cake?
Clarence (PS065) [416] Er no I'll give it a ... miss right now thankyou.
                 [417] I'm a bit full [...] from my sandwich.
                 [418] ... No I I'll enjoy it more
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [419] later on.
                 [420] No no.
Nina (PS066)     [421] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [422] Cup of tea would go down like a bomb but
Nina (PS066)     [423] [...] you've not eaten it. ...
Clarence (PS065) [424] Possibly yes.
                 [425] Mm.
                 [426] Mhm.
                 [427] ... I meant to ask, oh ...
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [428] [...] Aha aha. ...
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [429] Pardon?
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [430] Right.
                 [431] [...] ... [cough] Right. [cough] ... [...]
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [432] [cough] Pardon?
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [433] Er oh yes, yes I have actually. ...
Nina (PS066)     [434] Let's put this cake back in its tin. ...
Clarence (PS065) [435] I'll have a cup of tea then bash on with my window then
                 I think.
Nina (PS066)     [436] Well the sooner it's finished [...]
Clarence (PS065) [437] Well, yes because it is at least dry today.
Nina (PS066)     [438] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [439] But erm ... It's gonna make a hell of a racket sanding
                 down afterwards you know.
Nina (PS066)     [440] Well it can't be helped.
Clarence (PS065) [441] No it can't be helped, no.
                 [442] ... I'll probably have to get some medium grade paper
                 too.
                 [443] ... Cos I've got a lot of gr fine and coarse but ...
Nina (PS066)     [444] [...] with us making a row won't they?
Clarence (PS065) [445] I can't think that all that much goes through you know,
                 to be honest.
                 [446] ... Obviously
Nina (PS066)     [447] Yeah well but by and large we've not
Clarence (PS065) [448] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [449] really been on their wall have we?
Clarence (PS065) [450] No that's what I mean.
Nina (PS066)     [451] [laughing] When we start down here [...] [] .
Clarence (PS065) [452] Some of the heavier banging and the, the high pitch ...
                 high frequency erm ... noises like me drill and erm ...
Nina (PS066)     [453] Just keep it down to erm
Clarence (PS065) [454] Mm.
                 [455] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [456] a minimum [...] keep
Clarence (PS065) [457] Yeah yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [458] not do it late, just keep stopping before it gets too
                 late.
Clarence (PS065) [459] Well exactly what we have been doing.
Nina (PS066)     [460] Cos it is annoying isn't it, you know?
Clarence (PS065) [461] Oh yeah. ...
Nina (PS066)     [462] But there's not an awful lot you can do is there?
                 [463] I mean if we had a firm of workmen in they'd [...]
Clarence (PS065) [464] They'd still do, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [465] they'd make [laughing] more noise [] wouldn't they?
Clarence (PS065) [466] Oh rather more noise, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [467] But erm
Clarence (PS065) [468] And the clatter of tea cups. [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [469] But then I was ... meant to mention, ask Rachel if she'd
                 seen the photograph cos Mike didn't know ... about the two
                 photographs that er Rachel and Louise have taken.
Nina (PS066)     [470] Mm.
                 [471] Have I given yours, has yours got sugar in?
Clarence (PS065) [472] I don't know.
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [473] I really don't know. ...
Nina (PS066)     [474] I'm not sure whether that has ha I can usually tell er
                 I've
Clarence (PS065) [475] Well you claim to be able to.
Nina (PS066)     [476] No I think it's, I can normally, yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [477] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [478] Mm.
                 [479] ... I'm glad I found out what that is.
Clarence (PS065) [480] Yeah.
                 [481] What the hell's it called, a what?
Nina (PS066)     [482] Erm
Clarence (PS065) [483] Something anemone wasn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [484] Anemone blander
Clarence (PS065) [485] Oh yes?

                 [488] February to April.
                 [489] Requires full sun as flowers close in shady conditions.
Clarence (PS065) [490] Mm will it get it there?
Nina (PS066)     [491] Grow it in the rockery ... or naturali naturalize it in
                 grassland [] .
Clarence (PS065) [492] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [493] That sounds like it.
Clarence (PS065) [494] Well it looks like the illustration doesn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [495] Well it looks li yes.
                 [496] It does.
Clarence (PS065) [497] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [498] Mm can go by the leaves, I thought the leaves look like
                 it too.

Clarence (PS065) [500] Has it ... yeah
Nina (PS066)     [501] as much as it has there we look like getting [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [502] Has it got the same number of petals on it?
Nina (PS066)     [503] Yes, it ... similar, yes.
                 [504] It's di , that's di , they differ.
Clarence (PS065) [505] Oh yeah.
                 [506] Not just the colour and the number of ...
Nina (PS066)     [507] [...] ... Well I'm not sure but I'm not going out to
                 count them. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [508] [laugh] Well it's [...] .
                 [509] ... I would have thought.
                 [510] ... Must get some rose fertiliser you know too because
                 erm ... I don't suppose the original plants have been fed for
                 generations, literally.
Nina (PS066)     [511] Oh you mean for those ramblers?
                 [512] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [513] Yeah.
                 [514] Well those ramblers and all over the place, mm.
Nina (PS066)     [515] Mm.
                 [516] It looks to me as if it's going to blooming rain again.
Clarence (PS065) [517] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [518] I'm fed up with this weather.
Clarence (PS065) [519] Well it's a good general purpose fertiliser [...] isn't
                 it?
Nina (PS066)     [520] Yes.
                 [521] ... What was the other one?
Clarence (PS065) [522] Growmore
Nina (PS066)     [523] Growmore.
                 [524] No.
                 [525] ... Erm
Clarence (PS065) [526] [...] You're the gardening expert.
Nina (PS066)     [527] No I think it was the rose fertiliser, they said use it
                 for the tomatoes as well.
Clarence (PS065) [528] Yeah that's right, yeah.
                 [529] Ah!
                 [530] That was right erm ... it was the tomato fertiliser
                 wasn't it, that was quite good for something?
                 [531] ... As well, er you know as well as the rose fertiliser.
Nina (PS066)     [532] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [533] Yes, they can use rose fertiliser for tomatoes.
                 [534] ... But also tomato fertiliser [laughing] apparently is
                 useful for [] I don't know.
                 [535] ... Look it up at the end of the book.
                 [536] ... Incidentally what's this er ... operation that Jenny
                 was on about?
                 [537] Er not Jenny, Josie ... was on about this morning that
                 ... er Jenny had?
Nina (PS066)     [538] Caesarian.
Clarence (PS065) [539] Oh she had a caesarian did she?
                 [540] I was forgetting she had a caesarian.
Nina (PS066)     [541] Yes course she has.
                 [542] That's probably why it's
Clarence (PS065) [543] Of course.
Nina (PS066)     [544] taken her to get ... on her feet [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [545] Of course, good god yes.
                 [546] I was thinking it was [...] knit one purl one on the
                 stitches you know, but ... mm.
                 [547] Of course, oh yeah.
                 [548] ... Oh yes.
                 [549] ... Yes it was on the radio this morning about that erm
                 ... it is in England somewhere I think ... [laughing] a
                 woman's given birth to a fifteen pound [] some ounces kid.
Nina (PS066)     [550] Oh dear me.
Clarence (PS065) [551] Good gracious.
                 [552] Tremendous size that is isn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [553] Mm.
                 [554] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [555] Mind its weight, I don't know about the size but ... mm.
                 [556] ... We seem to have a tremendous lot of seagulls don't
                 we?
                 [557] Over that playing field there.
Nina (PS066)     [558] Well it's being so windy isn't it? [...]
Clarence (PS065) [559] Yeah well I, no I'm generalizing throughout the year.
Nina (PS066)     [560] Well we're not that far from the sea are we?
Clarence (PS065) [561] Of course not, that's true.
                 [562] Yeah.
                 [563] ... Mm.
                 [564] Oh yes but I mean they ... they seem to concentrate
                 pretty well round these playing fields for some reason.
                 [565] ... [...] blackbird there.
Nina (PS066)     [566] Yeah I know.
                 [567] [...] the way they land.
Clarence (PS065) [568] Yeah it's interesting to watch the different birds, the
                 different methods of landing.
                 [569] Some are quite accurate.
                 [570] The others are a bit sprawling those blackbirds I think
                 .
Nina (PS066)     [571] Mm the [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [572] Yeah.
                 [573] ... caw caw caw [laugh] ... That looks like an old one
                 to me doesn't it? ...
Nina (PS066)     [574] An old fella [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [575] Yeah.
                 [576] Well not an old fella necessarily. ...
Nina (PS066)     [577] I'm still sort of puzzling ... what the best thing, best
                 thing to do for that hedge down there.
                 [578] Cos we can't er ... until we get ... it cleared all the
                 way along it ... although, it seems to change.
                 [579] If you look
Clarence (PS065) [580] Hang on.
                 [581] What seems to change?
Nina (PS066)     [582] The hedge.
                 [583] ... If you look from here
Clarence (PS065) [584] In what way does it ch [...] ?
Nina (PS066)     [585] Well if you look from here
Clarence (PS065) [586] I'm looking from here.
Nina (PS066)     [587] And then you go along.
Clarence (PS065) [588] I'm going along.
Nina (PS066)     [589] By the time it gets to that ... all that rubbish that
                 we're going to shift.
Clarence (PS065) [590] Er y oh yes, there in front.
Nina (PS066)     [591] Well then if you look it ... tends to change to a
                 different variety [...] trees.
Clarence (PS065) [592] Oh it does there.
                 [593] See what you mean.
                 [594] Yes.
                 [595] Yeah [...]
Nina (PS066)     [596] I don't
Clarence (PS065) [597] it definitely does change doesn't it?
                 [598] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [599] I don't know what they are, but one of those trees has
                 little catkins on it.
                 [600] Very poor.
Clarence (PS065) [601] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [602] So it obviously
Clarence (PS065) [603] [laughing] I'm not surprised [] they're poor [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [604] I know I know.
Clarence (PS065) [605] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [606] But erm ... it wants the roots ... clearing
Clarence (PS065) [607] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [608] and feeding and
Clarence (PS065) [609] Mm.
                 [610] Mm.
                 [611] Mhm.
Nina (PS066)     [612] It's a shame though to let them die because th they're
                 ... I like to have a, a different ... I don't want it all the
                 same.
                 [613] It's [...] boring isn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [614] Oh you're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia
                 aren't you? [...]
Nina (PS066)     [615] That gives interest, especially
Clarence (PS065) [616] Same
Nina (PS066)     [617] into the corner.
Clarence (PS065) [618] Mm that's why I don't want to clip that erm bottom hedge
                 too cleanly. ...
Nina (PS066)     [619] No but I think
Clarence (PS065) [620] Lop it down.
                 [621] Yes I agree.
                 [622] Lop it down but erm
Nina (PS066)     [623] I think we need to, for th this time round ... because
                 it'll soon get, you know
Clarence (PS065) [624] Take its own [...]
Nina (PS066)     [625] [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [626] Mm.
                 [627] Mm.
                 [628] Yes maybe you're right.
Nina (PS066)     [629] But I do think for now we're just going to have to cu
                 chop it down.
Clarence (PS065) [630] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [631] It's going to get worse and worse if we don't. ...
Clarence (PS065) [632] Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter,
                 hedge cutter you know?
Nina (PS066)     [633] Yes.
                 [634] I looked in the paper to see if there was any.
Clarence (PS065) [635] No there weren't.
Nina (PS066)     [636] They're very expensive to buy aren't they?
Clarence (PS065) [637] Oh new they are certainly yes.
Nina (PS066)     [638] Yes, and you want a double action one?
Clarence (PS065) [639] Preferably.
                 [640] Not essentially.
Nina (PS066)     [641] I, I wouldn't think that erm ... like the different
                 length of the blades.
                 [642] You don't want a very big one.
Clarence (PS065) [643] I don't think you need the, think it's a twenty four is
                 it? [...] no.
Nina (PS066)     [644] I would think they're more trouble than they're worth
                 unless you've got
Clarence (PS065) [645] Yeah.
                 [646] They could be.
Nina (PS066)     [647] a great big [...]
Clarence (PS065) [648] Mm.
                 [649] Oh and you'd have to be that little bit more careful
                 too.
Nina (PS066)     [650] Mm.
                 [651] Yes exactly.
Clarence (PS065) [652] Mm.
                 [653] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [654] [...] .
                 [655] I think that's what [...]
Clarence (PS065) [656] And again, unless the motor is fairly hefty [...]
Nina (PS066)     [657] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [658] it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out.
                 [659] Because it's doing more work isn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [660] I don't [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [661] Mm well in theory.
                 [662] A bigger area, bigger length.
                 [663] You're cutting more at the same time.
Nina (PS066)     [664] Yeah I was looking at the petrol driven ones. [...]
Clarence (PS065) [665] Good god.
Nina (PS066)     [666] I know.
                 [667] [laughing] That's what [] I thought.
Clarence (PS065) [668] Stone the crows.
                 [669] Cor.
Nina (PS066)     [670] [laugh] It took me breath away so
Clarence (PS065) [671] Good gracious me.
Nina (PS066)     [672] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [673] No no.
Nina (PS066)     [674] Just how
Clarence (PS065) [675] What?
Nina (PS066)     [676] much ... erm ... how much can you cut with those as
                 opposed to having ... needing ... the erm, the other ones that
                 are used for trees.
                 [677] Erm
Clarence (PS065) [678] [laughing] Chainsaw [] ?
Nina (PS066)     [679] chainsaw.
                 [680] I couldn't, forget the word.
                 [681] The chainsaw.
Clarence (PS065) [682] [laugh] Oh they'll take er do a fair amount of work but
                 erm ... I think, certainly as far as the hedge is concerned
Nina (PS066)     [683] Well I know that.
Clarence (PS065) [684] Yeah hang on.
                 [685] Hang on.
                 [686] ... In a well established hedge like that
Nina (PS066)     [687] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [688] I would think er the loppers, if the erm ... hedgecutter
                 won't tackle it the loppers will
Nina (PS066)     [689] Yes but what I was thinking more
Clarence (PS065) [690] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [691] is the rest of the, round there ... round at the side
                 there.
                 [692] ... I mean a lot of the ... you know when we start
                 getting rid of all the rubbish down that side?
Clarence (PS065) [693] Er I wouldn't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through
                 that erm that bush there.
                 [694] That's a little bit too heavy for it.
Nina (PS066)     [695] Which bush?
Clarence (PS065) [696] Well the one ... where the hedge terminates and
Nina (PS066)     [697] Mm ... well.
Clarence (PS065) [698] That dead looking e well dead [...]
Nina (PS066)     [699] No.
                 [700] No but would it do to, I mean you're going to have a lot
                 of the ... stuff that we chopped off
Clarence (PS065) [701] Yeah. ...
Nina (PS066)     [702] to put to, if we're getting a trailer and getting rid of
                 it all.
Clarence (PS065) [703] Yeah.
                 [704] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [705] You're going to have to cut it down still further into
                 smaller pieces aren't you, to get as much as you can in the
                 trailer?
Clarence (PS065) [706] Oh I see what you mean, to cram on the trailer.
                 [707] Yes.
                 [708] Yes yes.
Nina (PS066)     [709] Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to u revert
                 to erm ... a chainsaw?
Clarence (PS065) [710] Er ... combination of both I should think.
                 [711] I, well I'm not too concerned about that anyway.
                 [712] I can use the loppers.
                 [713] If we were doing it seven days a week, fair enough,
                 you'd probably need a chainsaw but ... [...] anything, the
                 loppers or the handsaw.
Nina (PS066)     [714] Oh handsaw?
                 [715] Oh that's hard work.
Clarence (PS065) [716] No.
                 [717] No no no no not the really not the thick ones [...]
Nina (PS066)     [718] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [719] But erm
Nina (PS066)     [720] Well I was just thinking of taking the work out of it.
Clarence (PS065) [...]
Nina (PS066)     [721] Mm it's one hell of a lot of work [...]
Clarence (PS065) [722] But you see we don't really need a chainsaw do we?
Nina (PS066)     [723] No I wouldn't say so normal but er there's quite a lot
                 to [...]
Clarence (PS065) [724] No.
                 [725] ... No.
                 [726] No.
                 [727] To hire one possibly for a specific [...] specific job
                 but
Nina (PS066)     [728] I wonder how much they are to hire?
Clarence (PS065) [729] Not very dear.
Nina (PS066)     [730] Oh aren't they?
Clarence (PS065) [731] What erm chainsaws?
Nina (PS066)     [732] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [733] I think ... last time I looked at the hire list, price,
                 price list
Nina (PS066)     [734] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [735] I think about ... five six quid a day something like
                 that, they were last year.
                 [736] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [737] Oh that's not bad really.
Clarence (PS065) [738] Oh it isn't bad if you've got a lot of erm chainsaw work
                 to do.
                 [739] That can be done in a day you know.
Nina (PS066)     [740] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [741] Mm.
                 [742] ... Now whether that's erm ... including all the
                 protective clothing or not I dunno.
Nina (PS066)     [743] I don't know.
Clarence (PS065) [744] There might be a different charge for that but
Nina (PS066)     [745] Er did you ... think any more about the er ... rubbish
                 clearance that was, they were advertising in the paper?
                 [746] I mean what d'you think?
Clarence (PS065) [747] Oh the ... twelve quid's worth wasn't it?
                 [748] Was it twelve?
                 [749] Sixteen.
Nina (PS066)     [750] Sixteen quid for one load.
                 [751] What's a load? [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [752] What is, well yes.
                 [753] Anything that'll fill a skip, it'll be a skip.
Nina (PS066)     [754] Skip [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [755] And I suspect that'll be the smallest skip, I don't
                 know.
Nina (PS066)     [756] I would imagine so.
Clarence (PS065) [757] Did it say from?
                 [758] What did it just say?
Nina (PS066)     [759] No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I
Clarence (PS065) [760] Mm.
                 [761] Mm.
                 [762] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [763] thought mm I wonder how much a load is. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [764] Well yes, it's probably the smallest skip.
Nina (PS066)     [765] But it'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite
                 a lot of it.
Clarence (PS065) [766] See I don't see erm ... them shifting very much for that
                 because by the time you've ... got a bloke out ... paid his
                 wages, paid for the ... the erm ... skip shifter, transporter
                 you know.
Nina (PS066)     [767] Well if this is a skip.
                 [768] It might just be a trailer.
Clarence (PS065) [769] It might be a trailer.
                 [770] It might be an open back lorry, you know.
Nina (PS066)     [771] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [772] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [773] A lorry?
Clarence (PS065) [774] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [775] Well we could get rid of qu [laughing] I doubt it
                 whether they're going to shift that []
Clarence (PS065) [776] Well, you know mm.
Nina (PS066)     [777] I doubt that.
Clarence (PS065) [778] But again on a costing basis I mean hourly.
                 [779] How long is it gonna take a chap to load loads?
Nina (PS066)     [780] Yes but I'm thinking I mean there's so much to do here
                 Larry, you er ... you know, you're not a young man any more.
                 [781] You can't er do too much.
Clarence (PS065) [782] Er I had noticed.
                 [783] Yes.
                 [784] Yes.
                 [785] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [786] It's no good wearing yourself out if you can get
                 anything done
Clarence (PS065) [787] [laughing] I was worn out already.
                 [788] What are you on about [] ?
Nina (PS066)     [789] [laugh] You know what I mean.
Clarence (PS065) [790] [laugh] I'm knackered.
                 [791] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [792] But it makes sense to me to have a little bit of help.
Clarence (PS065) [793] Oh I'm not adverse to having ... bit of help
Nina (PS066)     [794] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [795] you know of the right sort.
                 [796] No no no, no no no, no [...] Erm
Nina (PS066)     [797] You're usually pretty independent.
Clarence (PS065) [798] A little perhaps but er ... I mean you can have people
                 that are more damn trouble than they're worth can't you?
                 [799] Quite honestly.
Nina (PS066)     [800] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [801] Spend your time watching
Nina (PS066)     [802] Well you know the, all the stuff that you've got ... at
                 the side where
Clarence (PS065) [803] Ah well that's straight on the trailer, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [804] Is it?
Clarence (PS065) [805] Well more, more or less, yeah.
                 [806] One or two things I'll be keeping but most of it ...
                 it's just straight, that's why it's all piled up ready to go.
Nina (PS066)     [807] Ah but I wasn't just meaning on the concrete bit.
                 [808] I was meaning on the soil.
                 [809] There's loads and loads of what you trimmed off the
                 [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [810] Oh that's not rubbish that's just erm off the trees
                 isn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [811] Well it's still got to be got rid of hasn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [812] Chuck it over the fence and it'll go straight in, more
                 or less straight in the trailer won't it? ... [...]
Nina (PS066)     [813] It'll be just like you [laugh] to get your trailer and
                 your car down there when er [laughing] [...] arrive and [...]
                 .
Clarence (PS065) [814] Oh highly probable.
                 [815] Sod's law, yes [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [816] I know [] .
                 [817] ... I can't get over the fact that, that all
Clarence (PS065) [818] What?
Nina (PS066)     [819] all through the winter we've had daisies all over the
                 grass. ...
Clarence (PS065) [820] Oh yes you mean the fact that they've been in flower
                 [...] ?
                 [821] Mm.
                 [822] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [823] You don't usually see daisies do you [...] ?
Clarence (PS065) [824] I honestly don't know Nina.
                 [825] I don't know.
Nina (PS066)     [826] Mm don't think it's dry enough to cut the grass is it?
Clarence (PS065) [827] Oh I w , no I wouldn't do it today.
                 [828] No, crikey no.
Nina (PS066)     [829] No I don't think so.
                 [830] It doesn't look very promising.
Clarence (PS065) [831] No. ...
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [832] Mm.
                 [833] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [834] It makes it hard work doesn't it? [...]
Clarence (PS065) [835] Oh yes.
Nina (PS066)     [836] Have to do a bit at a time.
Clarence (PS065) [837] I'm going to investigate, see if I can't do a conv I
                 don't think for one minute I will but it's possible ... do a
                 conversion ... er into erm ... the box type.
                 [838] Cos that way all the ... or most of the cuttings at
                 least, go into the box wouldn't they?
                 [839] It's possible.
Nina (PS066)     [840] Oh it might be more trouble than it's worth.
Clarence (PS065) [841] It might be.
                 [842] It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small
                 vacuum cleaner [laughing] and cutting the erm []
Nina (PS066)     [843] Ah don't use
Clarence (PS065) [844] No?
Nina (PS066)     [845] No I, I prefer using it just as it is quite frankly.
                 [...]
Clarence (PS065) [846] Well i it's not a big thing, it's only ... you know what
                 I mean don't you?
                 [847] That yellow and green one?
Nina (PS066)     [848] Yes I know what you mean but I don't fancy you messing
                 about with the ... grasscutter.
Clarence (PS065) [849] No
Nina (PS066)     [850] Cos I find it ... if there's anything else attached to
                 it ...
Clarence (PS065) [851] It depends which mounting.
                 [852] Keep the centre of gravity low ... and there'd be no
                 problems.
Nina (PS066)     [853] No I don't, I can't agree with you there.
Clarence (PS065) [854] Mm.
                 [855] Maybe not, no.
Nina (PS066)     [856] No, leave well alone.
Clarence (PS065) [857] Mm ... [whistling]
Nina (PS066)     [858] [...] don't you?
                 [859] And then you just make a mess of what you've already
                 got.
Clarence (PS065) [860] It's quite possible but erm ... [whistling]
Nina (PS066)     [861] Mm but I, I mean I can use it as it is now but anything
                 else on to it I would find it difficult. ...
Clarence (PS065) [862] [whistling] Well I'm gonna bash on with the erm
Nina (PS066)     [863] Right, are you ready for the window yet?
Clarence (PS065) [864] Well er yes please.
                 [865] We can do it now then.
Nina (PS066)     [866] Well I'll come and do that then [...]
Clarence (PS065) [867] Okay.
                 [868] Right.
                 [869] ... And hopefully by ... teatime I should have got the
                 burning done.
                 [870] ... Right, away we go.

                 we lived up in Manchester.

Nina (PS066)     [896] [laugh] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [897] Prick them out!
                 [898] How on earth d'you remember that, prick them out? ...
Nina (PS066)     [899] It's a tedious job.
                 [900] But it's worth it.
Clarence (PS065) [901] Well not really.
Nina (PS066)     [902] I wonder how Jill's are doing?
Clarence (PS065) [903] Mm dunno.

Clarence (PS065) [917] Oh [laughing] definitely [] I know that but were they
                 pleasant, unpleasant?
                 [918] Rather nice or ... run of the mill or?
Nina (PS066)     [919] Oh they were those little ones.
                 [920] Little sweet ones.
Clarence (PS065) [921] Oh that's right.

Clarence (PS065) [929] No I don't frankly, no.

Clarence (PS065) [931] Mm.
                 [932] Oh ... that's right.
Nina (PS066)     [933] And they weren't very brilliant at all.
Clarence (PS065) [934] I remember growing those on the [laugh] roof of the
                 shelter.
                 [935] What were those?

Clarence (PS065) [1024] Oh I know it's a combined fertiliser and weed killer.
Nina (PS066)     [1025] And I can't remember what she said it was.
Clarence (PS065) [1026] The only weeds we've got to get rid of really are those
                 erm ... are they dandelions?
Nina (PS066)     [1027] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1028] Mm.

Clarence (PS065) [1091] No no no no.
                 [1092] That's why people won't vote er a lot of people won't
                 vote for them.
                 [1093] ... Cos they're considered a wasted vote aren't they?
                 [1094] But erm ... you're voting for a party not for a
                 character.
Nina (PS066)     [1095] Mm.

Clarence (PS065) [1105] That was on the way anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [1106] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1107] If she hadn't done it somebody else would have done.
                 [1108] ... It's a pendulum business isn't it?

Nina (PS066)     [1126] Mm. ...

Nina (PS066)     [1142] Mm ... I can't understand why people want to be in
                 politics.

Nina (PS066)     [1146] Mm I know. ...
Clarence (PS065) [1147] Why do people want to be vicars and things?

Nina (PS066)     [1149] What did Ken say, little Ken say he wanted to be?
Clarence (PS065) [1150] Erm ...
Nina (PS066)     [1151] It wasn't an engineer?

Clarence (PS065) [1156] No no no.
                 [1157] It was something to do with growing things.
                 [1158] That sort of came over quite strongly.
Nina (PS066)     [1159] Oh no that was his second choice.
Clarence (PS065) [1160] Was it?
Nina (PS066)     [1161] Mm.

Nina (PS066)     [1198] No.
Clarence (PS065) [1199] In part I suppose it's due to ... erm ... complete
                 contrast of lifestyle between Jill and Steve's way and our
                 way.
                 [1200] ... Could be.

Nina (PS066)     [1206] I always want to cuddle her.
Nina (PS066)     [1207] Press the wave switch now, plonk you know.

                 ... chatting away in the presence of grandparents isn't it?
                 [1219] [laughing] Unless the grandparents are a couple of
                 weirdies [] .
                 [1220] Perhaps she thinks we're two weird, no I'm weird

                 [1231] ... And then I think more rain tonight [...] .
                 [1232] But as the girl in the ... post office said erm ...

                 probably is, the gulf stream
*** 5 (Tape 026506) ***
Clarence (PS065) [1233] It's not too bad finding [cough] where you want to go
Nina (PS066)     [1234] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1235] when it comes to looking for x-ray or path lab or
                 whatever it is ... but finding your way out.
                 [1236] ... Very seldom they have continuing ... er continuity
                 [cough] of markers saying exit, you know, or this way out.
Nina (PS066)     [1237] Wouldn't it, it's stupid that
Clarence (PS065) [1238] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1239] isn't it?
                 [1240] You can't get out quick enough can you, usually?
Clarence (PS065) [1241] Not short on the emergency exit signs, but yeah

                 right and gone ahead [...]
Nina (PS066)     [1245] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1246] It's like a labyrinth [laughing] you know [] .

Nina (PS066)     [1264] Mm.

Nina (PS066)     [1273] I can't remember all the details.

Nina (PS066)     [1276] I, I know Carolyn said that they ... in the end
Clarence (PS065) [1277] Yeah.

                 [1281] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1282] because they were so way out.

Clarence (PS065) [1304] I remember going late at night.
                 [1305] Were we collecting her?
Nina (PS066)     [1306] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1307] Were we really?
                 [1308] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1309] [...] she was in the flat.
Clarence (PS065) [...]
Nina (PS066)     [1310] And she'd passed out in the phone box. ...
Clarence (PS065) [1311] I remember that happening but ...
Nina (PS066)     [1312] And that's when we went to collect her there.
Clarence (PS065) [1313] And that was Withamshaw?
Nina (PS066)     [1314] That was Withamshaw yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1315] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1316] Er sh yes they were in er where were they living?
                 [1317] The flat then, they weren't ... they didn't have the
                 house.
Clarence (PS065) [1318] Mm.
                 [1319] Mm.
                 [1320] You said. ...
Nina (PS066)     [1321] And she'd only just gone to the end of the road to
                 phone ... Ken was working away.
Clarence (PS065) [1322] Oh yes, that's right.
                 [1323] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1324] Wasn't he?
Clarence (PS065) [1325] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1326] And Nicky wanted to, it was only ... a cock's stride
                 down the road.
                 [1327] Andrew was in bed and she just whipped out so Nicky
                 could say goodnight to her daddy.
Clarence (PS065) [1328] [laughing] Oh yes, that's right [] .
                 [1329] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1330] Oh dear.
                 [1331] What a performance. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [1332] [laugh] Mm.
                 [1333] ... Yes, you get so used to having a phone at home
                 don't you?
Nina (PS066)     [1334] Mm.
                 [1335] It's very handy.
                 [1336] Having to go to the end of the road, well it's daft
                 now.
                 [1337] That's if you can find one working.
Clarence (PS065) [1338] Not too bad here from what I've seen.
Nina (PS066)     [1339] No.
Clarence (PS065) [1340] No.
Nina (PS066)     [1341] No but I mean in Manchester it was shocking wasn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [1342] Oh well!
                 [1343] ... It was a very pleasant surprise if there is one
                 working.
                 [1344] ... Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [1345] You know I was just thinking
Clarence (PS065) [1346] Were you?
                 [1347] Jolly good.
Nina (PS066)     [1348] That well ... Lil and Nev going up on the mini break
Clarence (PS065) [1349] W tomorrow is it they go?
Nina (PS066)     [1350] Yeah Wednesday to Saturday, yes.
Clarence (PS065) [1351] Mm go on.
Nina (PS066)     [1352] I'll bet they hear of these mini breaks through the wh
                 I can't remember
Clarence (PS065) [1353] She probably
Nina (PS066)     [1354] her name.
Clarence (PS065) [1355] Was it Carol?
                 [1356] No it's not Carol.
Nina (PS066)     [1357] No.
                 [1358] No it's
Clarence (PS065) [1359] I don't know what her name is but ... I know the one
                 you mean.
                 [1360] The travel agency girl?
Nina (PS066)     [1361] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1362] Young woman, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1363] I wouldn't be surprised.
Clarence (PS065) [1364] Probably.
                 [1365] Mm.
                 [1366] ... Mm.
                 [1367] ... I'm wondering what ... made them change their mind
                 ... over the er knock through into the garage.
Nina (PS066)     [1368] Well I suppose they thought it was a bit too much.
                 [1369] I mean the place they've got there, it er [...] it
                 would mean
Clarence (PS065) [1370] Oh I'm not sugge
Nina (PS066)     [1371] that them decorating
Clarence (PS065) [1372] I know.
Nina (PS066)     [1373] the whole lot again wouldn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [1374] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1375] Oh no way.
Clarence (PS065) [1376] Yes but surely they thought that through before they
                 got to the stage that ... I mean even with the mortgage
Nina (PS066)     [1377] Well that's probably why they've decided against it.
Clarence (PS065) [1378] No.
                 [1379] ... Before [cough] they got to the stage of asking for
                 quotes because Nev had moved all his tools and tackle and
                 stuff ... to clear it.
Nina (PS066)     [1380] Had they actu actu really had a quote?
Clarence (PS065) [1381] I don't know.
                 [1382] I really don't know.
Nina (PS066)     [1383] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1384] They were due to get one.
                 [1385] Any time.
Nina (PS066)     [1386] They might have had one and found out what [laughing]
                 it was going to cost and were decided against [] .
Clarence (PS065) [1387] Possibly.
Nina (PS066)     [1388] They're having a mini break instead.
Clarence (PS065) [1389] Oh possibly ... again i it's just possible actually
                 that ... the construction of the bungalow didn't lend itself
                 properly well to ... knocking through.
Nina (PS066)     [1390] Well I think ... oh well it's so beautiful I mean as it
                 is in there, they don't need anything doing to, I mean
Clarence (PS065) [1391] Well
Nina (PS066)     [1392] they've got it nice.
                 [1393] They've got it ... so they don't get s sort of minimum
                 ... you know?
Clarence (PS065) [1394] Labour.
Nina (PS066)     [1395] Yes.
                 [1396] So I shouldn't imagine that erm ... I mean once we've
                 got through this one I'm blowed if I'm going to do it
Clarence (PS065) [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [1397] just for the sake of doing it.
                 [1398] [laughing] It'll have to really need it before we start
                 again [] .
Clarence (PS065) [1399] Well mm.
                 [1400] Oh yeah I know.
                 [1401] But they, they are a little bit inclined to what shall
                 we spend some money on next, aren't they?
Nina (PS066)     [1402] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1403] [cough] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1404] Well if it's there fair do.
Clarence (PS065) [1405] Oh!
                 [1406] Fair do, I know but er ... it's up to them what they do
                 with their money I know but ... mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [1407] What's happened to the rest of the paper Larry?
                 [1408] There's only half of it there.
Clarence (PS065) [1409] Well which paper [...] ?
Nina (PS066)     [1410] The Telegraph.
                 [1411] Last week's Telegraph.
                 [1412] There's only one
Clarence (PS065) [1413] I haven't the faintest idea.
Nina (PS066)     [1414] sheet there.
                 [1415] Just one
Clarence (PS065) [1416] One sheet?
Nina (PS066)     [1417] Well one ... section.
Clarence (PS065) [1418] Oh.
                 [1419] [laughing] I don't know [] .
                 [1420] I haven't the faintest idea.
Nina (PS066)     [1421] It's just disappeared.
Clarence (PS065) [1422] I haven't moved it at all.
                 [1423] Not knowingly anyway.
                 [1424] ... No.
                 [1425] ... It's possible I've used it but I don't erm ...
                 don't recall.
                 [1426] Never had an occasion to use, well the only time I've
                 used a newspaper as far as I know ... this afternoon when I
                 emptied the bag.
                 [1427] And that was
Nina (PS066)     [1428] Because we were going to phone up
Clarence (PS065) [1429] Yeah I know.
Nina (PS066)     [1430] the piece at ... with the
Clarence (PS065) [1431] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [1432] housing in.
Clarence (PS065) [1433] Yes for the er
Nina (PS066)     [1434] We were going to phone up and that seems to have
Clarence (PS065) [1435] the two bungalows yeah.
                 [1436] Mm.
                 [1437] It is incidentally [...] .
                 [1438] It's where I thought it was.
Nina (PS066)     [1439] Is it?
Clarence (PS065) [1440] On the left hand side [...] and erm ... it's ... pretty
                 near the main road.
Nina (PS066)     [1441] Mm.
                 [1442] Oh I know where you mean.
Clarence (PS065) [1443] Oh you do?
Nina (PS066)     [1444] I think I do anyway.
Clarence (PS065) [1445] The area [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [1446] Mm.
                 [1447] I thought it was on the main road?
Clarence (PS065) [1448] It is on the main road.
Nina (PS066)     [1449] Oh I see what you mean, the front's pretty near the
                 main road?
                 [1450] Would that bother them do you think, being so close to
                 the main
Clarence (PS065) [1451] I don't know Nina.
                 [1452] I haven't the faintest idea.
Nina (PS066)     [1453] Cos it looks quite a decent ... reasonable bungalow.
                 [1454] I wonder how much they want for it?
Clarence (PS065) [1455] I d I could only glanced at it as I drove past cos the
                 traffic was ... moving fairly quickly for the lights there you
                 know.
                 [1456] But
Nina (PS066)     [1457] Mm.
                 [1458] I bet the layout's something similar to that one we saw
                 ... further [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [1459] Probably.
                 [1460] There's not much of a difference between
Nina (PS066)     [1461] No, it looks the same shape somehow doesn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [1462] No.
                 [1463] Mm, yeah yeah.
                 [1464] ... [cough] [...] fairly tight.
Nina (PS066)     [1465] But that, they're, the one that
Clarence (PS065) [1466] [cough] Sorry, go on.
Nina (PS066)     [1467] we went to er look at, four of them, in the middle of
                 er the three.
Clarence (PS065) [1468] Oh yeah.
                 [1469] Where Whereabouts was that?
Nina (PS066)     [1470] There was four ... four it was in the middle.
                 [1471] The girl that works at the garage,sh next door to that.
Clarence (PS065) [1472] Oh not a bungalow, a house you mean?
                 [1473] Sorry, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1474] A house.
                 [1475] Well that one, I mean everybody said oh ... that's too
                 near to the main road so if that was too near to the main road
                 so will this one be.
Clarence (PS065) [1476] Well did Carolyn say that?
                 [1477] I can't remember.
Nina (PS066)     [1478] No Dawn said.
                 [1479] Neither can I.
Clarence (PS065) [1480] Well Dawn thought it was.
                 [1481] I certainly thought it was.
                 [1482] But then
Nina (PS066)     [1483] I know.
                 [1484] I didn't.
Clarence (PS065) [1485] I don't like traffic noise.
Nina (PS066)     [1486] It w yes it, I'd, it wouldn't have bothered me that.
Clarence (PS065) [1487] Mm.
                 [1488] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1489] But it, I can quite see that it would bother some
                 people.
Clarence (PS065) [1490] Mm.
                 [1491] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [1492] But it's not as if it's a main road like
Clarence (PS065) [1493] Oh crikey, no.
Nina (PS066)     [1494] [laughing] in Manchester is it [] ?
Clarence (PS065) [1495] Oh no.
                 [1496] No.
Nina (PS066)     [1497] There you could complain but I, I wouldn't say you get
                 that much traffic at night.
Clarence (PS065) [1498] Mm.
                 [1499] Mm.
                 [1500] ... Certainly not at night you won't get a lot, no.
                 [1501] Erm
Nina (PS066)     [1502] Well you wouldn't notice during the day.
                 [1503] You don't notice the same.
                 [1504] It's when everywhere's quiet.
                 [1505] And you're trying to sleep.
Clarence (PS065) [1506] Yes but it's noises you don't notice, if they're
                 continuous then they become
Nina (PS066)     [1507] That's right.
                 [1508] True.
Clarence (PS065) [1509] Yeah.
                 [1510] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [1511] Still ...
Clarence (PS065) [1512] I mean that's one of the beauties here wasn't it?
                 [1513] It's so peaceful, so quiet.
Nina (PS066)     [1514] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1515] There's no noises to get used to really.
Nina (PS066)     [1516] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1517] Apart from the birds and the bees and the
Nina (PS066)     [1518] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1519] sycamore trees.
Nina (PS066)     [1520] [laughing] And Sambo [...] [] .
Clarence (PS065) [1521] [laughing] And Sambo flying around yeah [] .
                 [1522] ... No he just crawled under the door ... sort of
                 glare, [...] glare at me and then scootled, shooted past, you
                 know. [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [1523] Why?
Clarence (PS065) [1524] Shot I should say.
Nina (PS066)     [1525] [laughing] Shooted past [] .
Clarence (PS065) [1526] Shooted past.
                 [1527] He shooted past as well as shot past.
                 [1528] [laugh] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1529] I wonder why?
Clarence (PS065) [1530] I don't know because he he's never really been
                 frightfully keen on me, that cat.
Nina (PS066)     [1531] Maybe it's probably has a rough working idea it's you
                 that put the fountain on today. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [1532] I doubt that very [laughing] much indeed.
                 [1533] Get on [] .
                 [1534] No.
                 [1535] No.

Clarence (PS065) [1538] He's alright.
                 [1539] He let me sort of tickle him and god knows what but er
                 ... he's pretty wary for some reason.
                 [1540] ... It may well be of course that father was a bit er
                 ... all dog and no cat sort of person, you know?
                 [1541] I dunno.
Nina (PS066)     [1542] Mm.
                 [1543] The they're both, they're all in lovely condition
                 aren't they?
                 [1544] Beautifully cared for.
Clarence (PS065) [1545] Oh yes.
                 [1546] No argument about that, yes.

                 wall affair at the front
Clarence (PS065) [1554] Hang on.
                 [1555] Oh there, yes.
                 [1556] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1557] it erm ... we won't need to be bothered quite so much
                 about getting paving stones.
                 [1558] Or stones, suitable stones to build will we?
Clarence (PS065) [1559] Well we won't be needing so many that's for sure, no.
                 [1560] I want some for the ... [laughing] erection [] ... at
                 the side of the pool there.

                 [1565] It's only gotta match the existing er
Nina (PS066)     [1566] Well how many do you want?
                 [1567] I mean don't you want to put it on bricks?
Clarence (PS065) [1568] Not bricks as such, no.
Nina (PS066)     [1569] [...] just ...
Clarence (PS065) [1570] Cut some of the paving stones
Nina (PS066)     [1571] I see.
Clarence (PS065) [1572] to roughly brick size
Nina (PS066)     [1573] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1574] and use that.
                 [1575] As I have done with that erm
Nina (PS066)     [1576] Well how many will you need?
Clarence (PS065) [1577] collection ... Pardon?
Nina (PS066)     [1578] You won't need that many for there.
Clarence (PS065) [1579] Not no no no no no.
                 [1580] Not an awful lot, no.
                 [1581] I can pad out with sto with er brick where it doesn't
                 show.
                 [1582] It'd look a bit odd with bricks though, I think.
Nina (PS066)     [1583] Mm.
                 [1584] True.
Clarence (PS065) [1585] Oh yeah.
                 [1586] ... And then we want matching slabs really don't we?
Nina (PS066)     [1587] Yes.
                 [1588] That'd be nice actu to have erm something you could sit
                 on there.
Clarence (PS065) [1589] Mm.
                 [1590] ... Wonder what do they do with old gravestones when
                 they've er
Nina (PS066)     [1591] Ooh I hate to think.
Clarence (PS065) [1592] when they've abandoned the graveyard.
Nina (PS066)     [1593] Well they seem to be there for ... er you know when
                 they did all that erm ... levelling at erm ... Southam Southam
                 cemetery?
Clarence (PS065) [1594] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1595] I wonder what they did with them then?
                 [1596] ... They just flattened it didn't they and and [...] .
                 [1597] It's a bit much when you come
Clarence (PS065) [1598] Yes, they made it so it could be
Nina (PS066)     [1599] to think of somebody paying a fortune for a
Clarence (PS065) [1600] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [1601] gravestone and then they come along and flatten it.
Clarence (PS065) [1602] Oh there must have been some sort of arrangement, I
                 don't know.
                 [1603] To, to cope with that though.
Nina (PS066)     [1604] Well quite a few of them [...]
Clarence (PS065) [1605] Well bear in mind a lot of them were very old ones and
                 there are
Nina (PS066)     [1606] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1607] probably no nearest and dearest left surviving.
Nina (PS066)     [1608] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1609] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1610] True. ...
Clarence (PS065) [1611] I seem to remember ... [...] papers ... about that.
                 [1612] ... Erm ... that removal or disposal or alteration of
                 the ... any creation around the grave was erm ... can be done
                 at the discretion of, of the
Nina (PS066)     [1613] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1614] parks authority or whatever it is, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1615] It was better really when they'd done it
Clarence (PS065) [1616] Parks and cemeteries, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1617] wasn't it?
                 [1618] It was much neater.
Clarence (PS065) [1619] Oh yes.
                 [1620] Both in ... far more pleasant to the eye
Nina (PS066)     [1621] Oh yes.
Clarence (PS065) [1622] far neater and er ... oh yeah.
                 [1623] [laughing] They can get more bodies in too [...] [] .
Nina (PS066)     [1624] Ooh!
Clarence (PS065) [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [1625] Shall we change the subject? [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [1626] No I ... ha!
                 [1627] [...] ... No I just had a thought because there must be
                 stacks of old grave gravestones around.
                 [1628] Some of the marble they ... cracking [...] ... cracking
                 bit of, yeah I know.
Nina (PS066)     [1629] No they ... yes they are.
Clarence (PS065) [1630] Should be for the price they charge too.
                 [1631] ... Ridiculous [...] forking out a fortune.
Nina (PS066)     [1632] I wonder how many [laugh] I wonder how many people have
                 now got them as hearths?
                 [1633] Now this marble er this kind of marble hearths.
Clarence (PS065) [1634] Yes you've got, yeah.
                 [1635] Yeah that's a point.
                 [1636] That's a point.
Nina (PS066)     [1637] I don't like that thing we've got there. [...]
Clarence (PS065) [1638] I think they're rather thicker than that, the damaged
                 gravestone.
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [1639] Mm.
                 [1640] ... When you think of all the [...] .
                 [1641] Go on.
Nina (PS066)     [1642] Mind you it it's ... indestructible really isn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [1643] Oh
Nina (PS066)     [1644] Once you've got it down.
Clarence (PS065) [1645] I wouldn't say indestructible, but I know what you
                 mean, yeah.
                 [1646] Yeah.
                 [1647] Yeah very very longlasting, yeah.
                 [1648] Depends on the quality of the marble too doesn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [1649] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1650] Obviously.
                 [1651] ... No I was gonna say, when you think of all the money
                 that's spent ... with these very elaborate ... er headstones
                 ... erm creations showing ... angels looking down on them,
                 plonking at their harps and god knows what.
                 [1652] They look quite nice from one point of view [...] but
                 er ... fifty seventy eighty hundred years later ... what the
                 hell does it matter?
                 [1653] You know?
Nina (PS066)     [1654] Mhm well I suppose it does to some people.
                 [1655] ... We've got to decide what to do at our fireplace yet
                 haven't we?
                 [1656] ... Ooh ... what a problem.
Clarence (PS065) [1657] Well if we get some [laughing] headstones it'll be
                 different [] .
Nina (PS066)     [1658] If ... you know if you, pardon?
                 [1659] [laugh] If you take
Clarence (PS065) [1660] Cor.
Nina (PS066)     [1661] the top off, the wooden part
Clarence (PS065) [1662] Er yes.
                 [1663] The mantelpiece?
Nina (PS066)     [1664] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [1665] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1666] Do you think it'll ... it's sort of cut so that the er
                 it fits on top of the brickwork?
Clarence (PS065) [1667] That one is I'm pretty sure, yes.
                 [1668] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1669] Do you think it'll look ... still look cock-eyed, the
                 brickwork?
Clarence (PS065) [1670] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [1671] Mm.
                 [1672] Mind you it won't matter if we erm ... [...] will it?
Clarence (PS065) [1673] Oh no that will ... [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [1674] Fancy building, I mean that must have been done when,
                 when the house was built.
Clarence (PS065) [1675] No.
                 [1676] No no, it's not original that.
                 [1677] No.
Nina (PS066)     [1678] [...] the original one then?
Clarence (PS065) [1679] You can see where the original fire surround was.
Nina (PS066)     [1680] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [1681] Look at the plaster work there behind it, above it.
                 [1682] Mm.
                 [1683] ... And where's the hearth ... different hearth isn't
                 it?
Nina (PS066)     [1684] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1685] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1686] Yes, that's right.
Clarence (PS065) [1687] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [1688] I'll be glad when that's done.
                 [1689] It's going to be a big job really.
Clarence (PS065) [1690] Mm.
                 [1691] ... No I should imagine it's a typical sixties, late
                 sixties erm ... well early sixties ... er tile surround, you
                 know?
Nina (PS066)     [1692] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1693] It's not [cough]
Nina (PS066)     [1694] When you look there's, there's ... really there's only
                 this room
Clarence (PS065) [1695] [laugh] Go on.
Nina (PS066)     [1696] to remove the paper.
Clarence (PS065) [1697] Erm
Nina (PS066)     [1698] Er the the the two rooms, like the big room ... and the
                 bathroom
Clarence (PS065) [1699] And our bedroom.
Nina (PS066)     [1700] Oh there's not much to move in
Clarence (PS065) [1701] There's in there, no.
Nina (PS066)     [1702] in the be because I think

                 [1709] Yes it's good enough there.
Nina (PS066)     [1710] Well there's only the little bit on the breast of the
                 er ... the chimney breast type of thing
Clarence (PS065) [1711] There's between the two ... yeah yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1712] that needs removing.
Clarence (PS065) [1713] Mm.
                 [1714] Mm.
                 [1715] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1716] And that was, that came off quite easily on the other
                 wall.
Clarence (PS065) [1717] Yeah.
                 [1718] [...] . Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1719] There's not that much to do so this is the main one
                 really.

                 [1721] Mm.

Clarence (PS065) [1726] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1727] well Joan and Clive were saying they did them.
Clarence (PS065) [1728] Yes and Derek ... remember, next door?

Clarence (PS065) [1730] And Terry , he said [...] .

Nina (PS066)     [1732] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1733] [laughing] So they must have been pretty good [] .
Nina (PS066)     [1734] Mm. [...]
Clarence (PS065) [1735] Mm.

                 road ... she ... hired one
Clarence (PS065) [1738] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1739] and finish [laughing] she didn't know where to stop []
                 .
                 [1740] And she it was so quick.
                 [1741] Yes it was very efficient.
Clarence (PS065) [1742] You mean it was working so quick and easy?

Clarence (PS065) [1747] Oh.
                 [1748] ... Do you remember the old days when it was standard
                 practice to put one ... paper on top of another?
Nina (PS066)     [1749] Ooh!
                 [1750] How many pa
Clarence (PS065) [1751] With the overlap.
Nina (PS066)     [1752] I know.
                 [1753] How many papers did we move
Clarence (PS065) [1754] You know? [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [1755] off the er
Clarence (PS065) [1756] Oh god I don't know.
Nina (PS066)     [1757] the old [...] .

Clarence (PS065) [1760] Yes.

                 [1762] Yeah.
                 [1763] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1764] What a job.
                 [1765] It was a heck of a long way up there as well wasn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [1766] Yeah.
                 [1767] But do you remember the borders?
                 [1768] The edges I should say at the, at the roll?
Nina (PS066)     [1769] Mm.
                 [1770] Yes.
                 [1771] I do.
Clarence (PS065) [1772] They used to have little marks to line the paper up
                 when you hang it.
Nina (PS066)     [1773] Oh?
Clarence (PS065) [1774] Yeah.
                 [1775] Down the
Nina (PS066)     [1776] Can't remember that.
Clarence (PS065) [1777] Exactly.
                 [1778] Down the edge
Nina (PS066)     [1779] Mm?
Clarence (PS065) [1780] the name of the manufacturer and possibly the ... say
                 the model like the ... that particular paper's ... erm
                 category ... name.
                 [1781] But it had ... at about oh eighteen inch intervals,
                 something like that?
                 [1782] Little marks, sometimes an arrow ... sticking out.
                 [1783] When you, when you put the next roll on you married up
                 the arrow.
Nina (PS066)     [1784] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [1785] Yeah.
                 [1786] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1787] I remember cutting out when you used to have to cut all
                 down your rolls of wallpaper.
Clarence (PS065) [1788] That's right.
Nina (PS066)     [1789] And do you remember [laughing] when you had to cut all
                 your borders out [] ?
Clarence (PS065) [1790] Yeah but don't you remember when they had that erm ...
                 erm ... semi-perforated edge on it?
                 [1791] And you knocked it on the edge of a table?
Nina (PS066)     [1792] Oh yes. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [1793] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1794] Things have changed a bit.
Clarence (PS065) [1795] Yes.
                 [1796] I don't quite know why they put that edge on in the
                 first place.
Nina (PS066)     [1797] No.
Clarence (PS065) [1798] Unless it was, in those days, they didn't have the
                 shrink wrap stuff did they?
Nina (PS066)     [1799] I think they used to overlap them one edge didn't they?
Clarence (PS065) [1800] Oh didn't th I was just thinking yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1801] That's right.
Clarence (PS065) [1802] Oh it was standard to, yeah a standard practice job
                 that, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1803] To overlap.
                 [1804] Well you could always see the join.
Clarence (PS065) [1805] Oh yes of course.
Nina (PS066)     [1806] And the joins they've put on this wallpaper here they
                 stand out
Clarence (PS065) [1807] [laughing] Oh god [] .
Nina (PS066)     [1808] about a mile don't they? [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [1809] Well this particular paper, you ... you've got to be
                 very care
Nina (PS066)     [1810] I don't like it.
Clarence (PS065) [1811] otherwise it crushes ... very easily.
Nina (PS066)     [1812] Mm.
                 [1813] I don't like it.
Clarence (PS065) [1814] Mm.
                 [1815] ... No.
                 [1816] It's not my favourite [...] by any means. ...
Nina (PS066)     [1817] We'll have to go and be having a look at ... at erm
Clarence (PS065) [1818] What?
Nina (PS066)     [1819] choose a paper for the room where we're doing now.
Clarence (PS065) [1820] Yes, there's a bit more plastering to be done yet.
Nina (PS066)     [1821] Not a lot though is there?
Clarence (PS065) [1822] Not a lot, no.
                 [1823] I want to skim that corner, ceiling and the top of the
                 wall.
                 [1824] ... Erm
Nina (PS066)     [1825] And strip all the little [...]
Clarence (PS065) [1826] and [...] there's also there's a ... usual crack
                 between the plasterboard and ceiling over the door and a
                 little crack running down to the door.
Nina (PS066)     [1827] Is there?
Clarence (PS065) [1828] [...] yeah.
                 [1829] It's worth doing.
Nina (PS066)     [1830] Oh yes.
Clarence (PS065) [1831] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1832] And do it properly.
                 [1833] Well [...]
Clarence (PS065) [1834] Mm.
                 [1835] Oh yes.
                 [1836] And there's all the burning off and ... mm.
                 [1837] [cough] ... And also I want to, while the ... carpet's
                 up, investigate the run of the cable.
                 [1838] So it's
Nina (PS066)     [1839] And have you any idea yet? ...
Clarence (PS065) [1840] About?
Nina (PS066)     [1841] Where the cable runs?
Clarence (PS065) [1842] Yes.
                 [1843] Yeah, yeah.
                 [1844] ... I think it's a spur coming off ... that runs into
                 the er ... But I don't think it's a proper imme immersion
                 heater circuit.
Nina (PS066)     [1845] You're joking?
Clarence (PS065) [1846] Well it doesn't have to be.
Nina (PS066)     [1847] Should it be?
                 [1848] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [1849] No it doesn't have to be.
                 [1850] No no no.
                 [1851] No.
                 [1852] No.
Nina (PS066)     [1853] There's a ... a mark on the wall, you know where the
                 switch is ... where you switch the pump on and off?
Clarence (PS065) [1854] Er ... yes.
Nina (PS066)     [1855] Well there's a mark on the wall.
                 [1856] Something's been on the wall that was round.
Clarence (PS065) [1857] Yes.
                 [1858] That would be erm ... the junction box.
                 [1859] ... Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1860] Why would they need another junction box there then?
                 [1861] Cos there's one down at the bottom.
Clarence (PS065) [1862] To feed I s would suspect the immersion heater.
                 [1863] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1864] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [1865] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1866] Well what have they taken it off for then?
                 [1867] Oh they wouldn't need, they wouldn't ... mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1868] Because y you, when you have your cable up to the
                 junction, hang on up to your junction box
Nina (PS066)     [1869] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1870] and from the junction box to the actual immersion
                 heater itself
Nina (PS066)     [1871] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1872] you have erm [cough] a heatproof cable called er
                 systaflex I think it's called.
Nina (PS066)     [1873] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1874] Yeah.
                 [1875] Er ... it's sort of a white, braided stuff that goes
                 over.
Nina (PS066)     [1876] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1877] Heat resistant.
Nina (PS066)     [1878] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1879] So you'd need a junction box to erm connect the
Nina (PS066)     [1880] Well you know how they've ... you know where the pipe
                 comes out of the ... cupboard?
Clarence (PS065) [1881] Hang on.
                 [1882] There are a lot of pipes.
Nina (PS066)     [1883] No, the the pipe that I w I think [laugh] supposedly
                 leads to the radiator.
Clarence (PS065) [1884] Erm
Nina (PS066)     [1885] And it comes down under that little
Clarence (PS065) [1886] do you mean the one with the pump in?
Nina (PS066)     [1887] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [1888] Oh that pipe.
                 [1889] Yeah, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1890] By the wall, and it
Clarence (PS065) [1891] Oh.
Nina (PS066)     [1892] comes into that little erm ... ooh the sort of semi ...
                 skirting board thing.
Clarence (PS065) [1893] Erm
Nina (PS066)     [1894] That stands away from the wall. ...
Clarence (PS065) [1895] offhand I can't say yes I do but
Nina (PS066)     [1896] Well it it's flat and then it comes down.
                 [1897] You've got your skirting board
Clarence (PS065) [1898] [laughing] Flat and then it comes down [] .
Nina (PS066)     [1899] It houses ... pipes.
                 [1900] ... And it's
Clarence (PS065) [1901] Oh you you mean in the room?
Nina (PS066)     [1902] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1903] Yes but I mean which pipe you mean, no.
Nina (PS066)     [1904] Well I don't know the pipe.
                 [1905] I haven't seen the pipe have I?
Clarence (PS065) [1906] Oh it's in the ... oh sorry, go on.
                 [1907] Carry on.
Nina (PS066)     [1908] No.
                 [1909] This thing ... but er er the pipe comes from the ...
                 cupboard.
                 [1910] You can see it
Clarence (PS065) [1911] If there's a pipe or pipes [...] cupboard yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1912] I dunno but it ... you can see it coming through
Clarence (PS065) [1913] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1914] and it ... into that housing
Clarence (PS065) [1915] Yeah.
                 [1916] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1917] and then it comes right round to the radiator
Clarence (PS065) [1918] Yes I know, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1919] and goes right to that wall doesn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [1920] Yes.
                 [1921] Yeah yeah.
                 [1922] Yeah.
                 [1923] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1924] Well why would it need ... if that, if ... it does
                 that, when it gets to the radiator
Clarence (PS065) [1925] Oh it's not just for the radiator.
Nina (PS066)     [1926] Oh.
                 [1927] I see [...]
Clarence (PS065) [1928] It's the hot water to the tap in the kitchen.
Nina (PS066)     [1929] Oh I see.
Clarence (PS065) [1930] That's right, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1931] As well.
                 [1932] Well what I was looking at this afternoon ... was your
                 radiator ... comes through the floor.
                 [1933] And yet all these pipes are here.
                 [1934] Why isn't ... why ... wouldn't they take erm ... your
                 radiator pipe ... the water, the pipe that feeds the radiator?
Clarence (PS065) [1935] Mm.
                 [1936] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1937] Why wouldn't it come through ... that little housing?
                 [1938] Instead of coming under the floor?
Clarence (PS065) [1939] Well again that's not original is it?
                 [1940] ... The central heating ... system is er ... a later
                 addition to the house isn't it?
Nina (PS066)     [1941] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [1942] And those pipes were where the circs where the, the ...
                 where the pipe run to the hot water tap in the kitchen.
                 [1943] And to the bathroom.
Nina (PS066)     [1944] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [1945] Mm.
                 [1946] ... And quite probably the cold water supply to the
                 bathroom too.
                 [1947] ... Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1948] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1949] And I think ... not the kitchen, that's on the rising
                 main.
                 [1950] Cos your stop tap is ... underneath the er
Nina (PS066)     [1951] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1952] sink top there.
                 [1953] [...] . But that one there is er ... [cough] fed, I'm
                 pretty sure ... from ... the, yes it is.
                 [1954] ... Yeah because the pipe goes up there.
                 [1955] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [1956] Oh yes of course.
                 [1957] It goes right through to the bathroom doesn't it?
                 [1958] That's it.
Clarence (PS065) [1959] And, if you think about it, there's a header tank ...
                 in the loft.
Nina (PS066)     [1960] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [1961] [...] the cold water from somewhere.
Nina (PS066)     [1962] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1963] So it'll come from there ... across the ceiling
Nina (PS066)     [1964] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1965] across the ceiling ... up through the erm ... cupboard
Nina (PS066)     [1966] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1967] into the l into the loft and [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [1968] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1969] Mm.
                 [1970] So [...] you'll have the hot water pipe ... to supply
                 the hot tap
Nina (PS066)     [1971] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1972] taps.
                 [1973] ... And the cold water feeds by the er header tank in
                 the loft.
Nina (PS066)     [1974] Mm.
                 [1975] Well why wouldn't they take them underneath the floor?
                 [1976] ... They could of, couldn't they, up there? ...
Clarence (PS065) [1977] Yes they certainly could.
                 [1978] But at the time of building I think it was ... just
                 continued practice from the victorian days to run it round on
                 the top.
                 [1979] Mm.
                 [1980] ... Pretty sure.
                 [1981] ... There has been, or appears to have been, a hole in
                 the wall that's been plastered up rather badly but ... above
                 that housing, that cover
Nina (PS066)     [1982] Mm?
Clarence (PS065) [1983] on the ... bathroom wall
Nina (PS066)     [1984] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1985] the wall separating the bathroom from the spare room
Nina (PS066)     [1986] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [1987] from the back bedroom ... in the bottom there's been a
                 hole about the size of a pipe
Nina (PS066)     [1988] Was there?
Clarence (PS065) [1989] about three quarter pipe, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [1990] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [1991] Or fifteen mil twenty two millimetres yeah.
                 [1992] ... Mm. ... [whistling] ...
Nina (PS066)     [1993] I think I'll wash up and then have a cup of tea.
Clarence (PS065) [1994] What a good ...
Nina (PS066)     [1995] What time is it?
Clarence (PS065) [1996] [yawn] time we had a ... wash up and a cup of tea I
                 think.
                 [1997] It's ... two and a half minutes to six o'clock.
                 [1998] Or eighteen hundred.
                 [1999] ... Oh the news.
                 [2000] Let's see if the queen's dead.
Nina (PS066)     [2001] Pardon?
Clarence (PS065) [2002] Where's the new oh is that the news?
Nina (PS066)     [2003] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [2004] See if the queen's dead.
*** 6 (Tape 026507) ***
Clarence (PS065) [2005] Oh yes I noticed [...] yeah.
                 [2006] Well [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2007] The only thing I [...] only I don't know all the names
                 of some of the people.
Clarence (PS065) [2008] Oh I wouldn't know any of them. ...
Nina (PS066)     [2009] But ... apart from that it's not a very difficult one.
Clarence (PS065) [2010] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [2011] Let's have a look what's what.
Clarence (PS065) [2012] Is it based on the contents of ... of rather the erm
Nina (PS066)     [2013] Yes.
                 [2014] It is.
Clarence (PS065) [2015] people on the box?
Nina (PS066)     [2016] It is.
Clarence (PS065) [2017] Oh crikey, [laughing] I w definitely wouldn't know [] .
Nina (PS066)     [2018] Pardon?
Clarence (PS065) [2019] I definitely wouldn't know, no. [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2020] Oh you would.
Clarence (PS065) [2021] up my nose it's erm ... quite erm
Nina (PS066)     [2022] I know.
                 [2023] I went in there and I thought something was burning.
                 [2024] Don't let me forget there's a cake in the oven will
                 you?
Clarence (PS065) [2025] Not a bun but a cake.
                 [2026] Right. ... [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2027] You know what I'm like.
                 [2028] I forgot it completely last week.
Clarence (PS065) [2029] Well what time ... do I remind you?
Nina (PS066)     [2030] Remind me at half past ... half past if I don't
                 remember myself.
Clarence (PS065) [2031] Half past six?
Nina (PS066)     [2032] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [2033] Yeah.
                 [2034] Well it's quarter past six now.
Nina (PS066)     [2035] I know what it is now but
Clarence (PS065) [2036] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2037] I'm quite capable of forgetting in about five minutes.
Clarence (PS065) [2038] Mm.
                 [2039] [laughing] Well it wouldn't take me that long [...] []
                 .
Nina (PS066)     [2040] Oh dear. [laugh] ...
Clarence (PS065) [2041] Quite a bit more [...] today anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [2042] Oh well yes.
Clarence (PS065) [2043] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2044] It's a hard slog [laughing] isn't it [] ?
                 [2045] I wish we'd got a bit further really but it's hard
                 work.
Clarence (PS065) [2046] There's a lot of work.
                 [2047] But we, we're getting there slowly.
                 [2048] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [2049] Let's have a look and see what's what.
Clarence (PS065) [2050] [...] you see the doors are different, quarter inch
                 difference in size.
Nina (PS066)     [2051] You wouldn't, I wouldn't have thought that.
                 [2052] [...] the same.
Clarence (PS065) [2053] No it didn't surprise me cos they usually ... no, they
                 put the casing up, the door casing.
Nina (PS066)     [2054] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [2055] And then the chippie erm ... cuts the door to fit.
                 [2056] [...] it, you know?
                 [2057] Very seldom you get it a perfect fit when you
Nina (PS066)     [2058] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [2059] just [...] it in.
                 [2060] ... Fortunately it is the right way round.
Nina (PS066)     [2061] Mm.
                 [2062] I don't think they, I would have thought that
                 everything was more or less
Clarence (PS065) [2063] Well it is more or less.
Nina (PS066)     [2064] spot on
Clarence (PS065) [2065] No.
                 [2066] No.
Nina (PS066)     [2067] size.
                 [2068] When the houses were built at the same time and
Clarence (PS065) [2069] They possibly are today.
                 [2070] Erm ... a lot of stuff's factory er
Nina (PS066)     [2071] Is that the sort of job that er Ken would be doing?
Clarence (PS065) [2072] On the building site, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [2073] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [2074] Mm.
                 [2075] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [2076] Mm.
                 [2077] ... Did you hear Josie was saying about er
Clarence (PS065) [2078] What?
Nina (PS066)     [2079] [...] ?
                 [2080] He's busy on this building project now but he doesn't
                 know after.
Clarence (PS065) [2081] Oh she said a few days ago about [...] some bungalow or
                 something he's ... he's helping to build.
                 [2082] He, he's a brickie isn't he?
                 [2083] Yes that's right.
Nina (PS066)     [2084] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [2085] Mm.
                 [2086] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2087] Whereabouts?
Clarence (PS065) [2088] I haven't the faintest idea.
Nina (PS066)     [2089] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [2090] Not the faintest. ...
Nina (PS066)     [2091] So it ... they, he'll be worried if ... oh mind you er
                 ... anything in the building trade is a bit iffy isn't it?
                 [2092] I can't see Ken
Clarence (PS065) [2093] [...] yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [2094] getting a a job really, can you?
                 [2095] Certainly not now. [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2096] I'd have thought he's going to find it extremely
                 difficult down here to find a job.
Nina (PS066)     [2097] Because I don't [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2098] Of any sort.
                 [2099] Never mind just in the building trade.
Nina (PS066)     [2100] Yes, I don't think he'll rush down [...] .
                 [2101] But he's so used to being [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [2102] Well he's got all his mates [...] .
                 [2103] And he er I don't think he's got the confidence to
                 [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [2104] No.
                 [2105] I don't.
Clarence (PS065) [2106] No.
Nina (PS066)     [2107] And then again he's getting older, I mean [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2108] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2109] it's more difficult as you get older [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [2110] See I did see there's that place erm ... erm ... oh
                 it's going, it's ... Tearscross direction.
                 [2111] ... Erm
Nina (PS066)     [2112] Erm
Clarence (PS065) [2113] they advert
Nina (PS066)     [2114] [...] ?
Clarence (PS065) [2115] Well, they advertise in the paper every week.
                 [2116] ... Advertise [...] carpenters and joiners.
                 [2117] But [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2118] The thing is er where he is now
Clarence (PS065) [2119] Mhm.
Nina (PS066)     [2120] er when, mind you he's been in his job for a while now.
Clarence (PS065) [2121] Mm.
                 [2122] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2123] But I mean ... when the jobs have finished ... he's
                 always
Clarence (PS065) [2124] Well he
Nina (PS066)     [2125] managed to get on to another one pretty well straight
                 away.
Clarence (PS065) [2126] See hang on no no no.
                 [2127] The job's been never finished ... never will be
                 finished ... with the corporation on it.
                 [2128] It's amazing [...] .
                 [2129] [laughing] Specially there [] .
Nina (PS066)     [2130] No but I mean, I don't mean wh I don't mean where he's
                 been working for the corporation, I mean ... before when he's
                 had these various jobs and they've finished and he's had, you
                 know, the job's finished and they've had to go somewhere.
Clarence (PS065) [2131] Oh the shopfitting and mm mm mm.
                 [2132] Mhm.
                 [2133] Mhm.
Nina (PS066)     [2134] He's always been ... quick at picking another job up
                 [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2135] Oh to be fair to him, yes he has.
                 [2136] He's been very quick at that.
Nina (PS066)     [2137] But as you get older that's not so easy is it?
Clarence (PS065) [2138] No, precisely.
                 [2139] No.
                 [2140] No.
Nina (PS066)     [2141] And he might not find it so easy here.
                 [2142] Cos there's so many more people in pretty much the same
                 trade. ...
Clarence (PS065) [2143] I would have thought so.
                 [2144] Yes.
                 [2145] I would have thought so.
Nina (PS066)     [2146] Mm.
                 [2147] And it just isn't commonsense to commute
Clarence (PS065) [2148] No.
Nina (PS066)     [2149] to Manchester is it?
Clarence (PS065) [2150] Oh he'd never do it.
                 [2151] It's ridiculous.
Nina (PS066)     [2152] Mind you, the only thing that I was thinking of, do you
                 know when he was commuting ...
Clarence (PS065) [2153] Ah.
Nina (PS066)     [2154] that firm he was working for
Clarence (PS065) [2155] Yeah, can't
Nina (PS066)     [2156] to Sw was it Swansea?
Clarence (PS065) [2157] It probably was Swansea area.
                 [2158] I think it was, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [2159] Yes it was Swansea area.
Clarence (PS065) [2160] Go on.
Nina (PS066)     [2161] He seemed to like that, although he did get fed up with
                 it [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [2162] Ah yes but it was quite a different run you see Nina.
                 [2163] That was motorway nearly all the way.
Nina (PS066)     [2164] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [2165] And he could do it in ... less time.
Nina (PS066)     [2166] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [2167] It was a straight run.
                 [2168] There was no driving involved.
                 [2169] You just point the car in the right direction ... press
                 the [...] pedal and you're there [...] . [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2170] It was still a long way.
Clarence (PS065) [2171] It's a longish way but erm ... for Ken it's not quite
                 the same as erm ... the A roads and B roads and
Nina (PS066)     [2172] No.
Clarence (PS065) [2173] oh no.
Nina (PS066)     [2174] No.
Clarence (PS065) [2175] Cos he doesn't really like driving.
Nina (PS066)     [2176] No he doesn't.
Clarence (PS065) [2177] No.
Nina (PS066)     [2178] And it is a bit of a tedious journey.
Clarence (PS065) [2179] He'd never do Mike's job.
                 [2180] Well [laugh] he'd never do Mike's job anyway but
Nina (PS066)     [2181] Oh no.
Clarence (PS065) [2182] you know, the driving side [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [2183] No but Mike enjoys it doesn't he?
Clarence (PS065) [2184] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [2185] He covers a a rattling ... big area.
Clarence (PS065) [2186] He's got a big area to cover, Mike ... if you think
                 about it. [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2187] He seems to enjoy the job doesn't he?
Clarence (PS065) [2188] Seems to yes.
                 [2189] Mark you he wouldn't crack on if he didn't.
                 [2190] No he wouldn't say very much about [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [2191] Well ... no I don't suppose so.
Clarence (PS065) [2192] No.
                 [2193] No. ...
Nina (PS066)     [2194] But goi reading between the lines, you can usually have
                 a a rough working idea [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2195] Oh yes he obviously likes it better than when he was at
                 er at that erm what do they call themselves? ... [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2196] Oh I can't remember now.
                 [2197] Erm oh well you see
Clarence (PS065) [2198] Mm.
                 [2199] Oh a hi fi firm.
Nina (PS066)     [2200] he doesn't l like being tied to the bench does he?
Clarence (PS065) [2201] Oh no.
                 [2202] He'd sooner be out.
Nina (PS066)     [2203] And I think I think he does his job well anyway.
Clarence (PS065) [2204] I'm quite sure he does his job extremely well, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [2205] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [2206] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2207] So all is well.
Clarence (PS065) [2208] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2209] It, it's a sha I feel sorry for young married couples
                 these days.
Clarence (PS065) [2210] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2211] It's very hard going isn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [2212] Oh yes.
                 [2213] Mm.
                 [2214] Oh yes.
                 [2215] ... Well
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2216] Go on.
Nina (PS066)     [2217] Mm.
                 [2218] I was gonna say something, I've forgotten. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [2219] As is my wont.
Clarence (PS065) [2220] Well you usually mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [2221] Mm but I can't see, I don't think Carolyn would have
                 much difficulty. ...
Clarence (PS065) [2222] Er no I d particularly ... in view of her experience
Nina (PS066)     [2223] Cos ... yeah
Clarence (PS065) [2224] I don't think she would.
Nina (PS066)     [2225] Exactly.
Clarence (PS065) [2226] Quite as much anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [2227] No I don't.
Clarence (PS065) [2228] She might have to wait a wee while but I think she'll
                 get on, yes.
Nina (PS066)     [2229] I think so.
Clarence (PS065) [2230] And possibilities for Carolyn
Nina (PS066)     [2231] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [2232] came now.
                 [2233] I don't ... we may be completely wrong.
                 [2234] But as far as this exchange business is concerned.
Nina (PS066)     [2235] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [2236] You'd never get erm ... you'd never get an exchange.
Nina (PS066)     [2237] No.
Clarence (PS065) [2238] I don't think we operate that scheme now.
Nina (PS066)     [2239] Larry have you got any books out from the library?
Clarence (PS065) [2240] No.
Nina (PS066)     [2241] That needs taking back?
Clarence (PS065) [2242] No, no.
Nina (PS066)     [2243] I was just looking at that, going right off the subject
                 but er that Uri Geller?
                 [2244] I bet that's interesting?
Clarence (PS065) [2245] It's er moderately interesting so far, yes.
Nina (PS066)     [2246] Yes.
                 [2247] I wouldn't mind reading that.
Clarence (PS065) [2248] No I thought you might.
                 [2249] That's one, another reason I got it out from the
                 library.
                 [2250] Erm it rabbits on quite a lot up to now.
Nina (PS066)     [2251] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [2252] About all the er astonishment, amazement ... the
                 English press and public and the Swedish press and the public
                 and the American press and public, you know?
                 [2253] Push push push all the time.

Clarence (PS065) [2256] Yes well of course you can only assume that what he
                 says is correct.
                 [2257] He's quoting various ... er authorities on the subject
                 [...] .
                 [2258] I've only just started the damn thing really.

                 he had this ... [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2260] Well he that's why he wanders on a bit.
                 [2261] Erm keeps giving little bits ... erm ... It was when he
                 was a child apparently, he claims to have been aware of it,
                 you know?
                 [2262] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2263] A ch as a child?
Clarence (PS065) [2264] Mm.

                 [2266] How old?
Clarence (PS065) [2267] Oh that I don't know. [...]
Nina (PS066)     [2268] Oh it doesn't give any particular age?
Clarence (PS065) [2269] Mm.
                 [2270] ... He admits to wanting to be a showman, you know?
Nina (PS066)     [2271] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [2272] A film star and god knows what.
Nina (PS066)     [2273] Oh well [...] [laugh] .
                 [2274] Loads of children do that don't they?
Clarence (PS065) [2275] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2276] It doesn't mean to say it always comes off. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [2277] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [2278] Mm.

Clarence (PS065) [2284] You certainly shoot through the first few ch chapters
                 of that anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [2285] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [2286] Oh yes.
                 [2287] Lot of repetition.
                 [2288] In effect.
Nina (PS066)     [2289] What's an ongoing topic? [...]
Clarence (PS065) [2290] [laughing] Politics [] .
Nina (PS066)     [2291] [laugh] In five. ...

Clarence (PS065)           [2373] Yes thank you.
Nina (PS066)               [2374] [laughing] They'll think we're always
                           blooming eating [] .
Unknown speaker (KBPPSUNK) [laugh]
Clarence (PS065)           [2375] [...] puddings.
Nina (PS066)               [2376] [laugh] Oh dear.
Clarence (PS065)           [2377] Well let's face it [...] Mm.
*** 8 (Tape 026602) ***
Clarence (PS065)           [2378] The broom.
Nina (PS066)               [2379] The broom, yes [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2380] Erm
Nina (PS066)               [2381] different coloured broom.
Clarence (PS065)           [2382] Oh for the back?
                           [2383] Yes.
Nina (PS066)               [2384] Yes.
                           [2385] I think erm ... we'll have to have a trip to
                           St Ishmal's for that.
Clarence (PS065)           [2386] Probably.
                           [2387] Where else could we go?
Nina (PS066)               [2388] Erm well we do
Clarence (PS065)           [2389] Other than that er rather expensive
Nina (PS066)               [2390] Well what I, I do like about St Ishmal's is
                           the way it's laid out and [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2391] It's laid out but the plants look healthy and
                           they're kept in healthy conditions.
Nina (PS066)               [2392] They do.
                           [2393] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065)           [2394] Mhm.
                           [2395] To me that Dingle place
Nina (PS066)               [2396] I wasn't very struck on that.
Clarence (PS065)           [2397] I wasn't at all struck, no. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2398] No I wasn't.
Clarence (PS065)           [2399] There were all weeds growing among the plants
                           they're selling.
Nina (PS066)               [2400] Messy.
Clarence (PS065)           [2401] Yes, messy.
                           [2402] And it wasn't just the messiness, I don't
                           mind that, but
Nina (PS066)               [2403] No. [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2404] They weren't looked after.
Nina (PS066)               [2405] cos you ... it was difficult to find ... the
                           things that you w you want ... oh I don't know, it
                           was just
Clarence (PS065)           [2406] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2407] it didn't erm didn't appeal to me somehow.
Clarence (PS065)           [2408] No. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2409] But erm I remember when we got the original
                           broom that we've got in the garden now, the golden
                           one
Clarence (PS065)           [2410] Yeah.
                           [2411] Where did we get that?
Nina (PS066)               [2412] We got that at St Ishmal's.
Clarence (PS065)           [2413] Did we?
                           [2414] [...] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2415] And erm ... they're sort of labelled, you
                           know what, it gives you this picture of what you're
                           buying as well.
Clarence (PS065)           [2416] Oh yes.
                           [2417] With most of the plants it does, yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2418] Yes cos I want to get the particular one I
                           want
Clarence (PS065)           [2419] Mm.
                           [2420] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2421] to go next to the ...
Clarence (PS065)           [2422] Well obviously, yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2423] you know, for the effect and erm
Clarence (PS065)           [2424] For the for the contrast, yeah.
                           [2425] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2426] I want to know the height
Clarence (PS065)           [2427] Mhm.
Nina (PS066)               [2428] it's going to grow [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2429] Mm.
                           [2430] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2431] I think it's er ... I think it'll look nice
                           there.
Clarence (PS065)           [2432] It should look quite attractive.
Nina (PS066)               [2433] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065)           [2434] It might be a bit of a job erm ... keeping
                           them separate.
                           [2435] [...] growing into one another.
Nina (PS066)               [2436] But I don't think so.
Clarence (PS065)           [2437] No?
Nina (PS066)               [2438] Oh no.
Clarence (PS065)           [2439] Oh.
Nina (PS066)               [2440] Well, it doesn't really matter.
Clarence (PS065)           [2441] Oh that's alright then.
                           [2442] Good.
Nina (PS066)               [2443] Because I mean they don't sort of grow out,
                           they grow up don't they? ...
Clarence (PS065)           [2444] Yeah, but they do grow out a bit too.
                           [2445] I mean the one at twenty seven
Nina (PS066)               [2446] Yes I know but not enough ... it wouldn't
                           really matter if ... that, a little bit of it [...]
                           .
Clarence (PS065)           [2447] No no.
                           [2448] No no no no.
Nina (PS066)               [2449] cos that's the idea.
Clarence (PS065)           [2450] Mm I suppose so, yeah.
                           [2451] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2452] Did you see, you know this last gardener's
                           ... [...]

Nina (PS066)               [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2454] I haven't really looked at it, no.
                           [2455] I glanced very briefly at it but
Nina (PS066)               [2456] Where it had er a broom garden?
Clarence (PS065)           [2457] No I didn't see that.

                           it.

Clarence (PS065)           [2464] There's a what?
Nina (PS066)               [2465] [laugh] I think that's what they call a

                           digging?

                           [2471] Right up in front of the sweetpeas? ...
Clarence (PS065)           [2472] Erm ... the left or the right?
Nina (PS066)               [2473] Right down at the bottom there by the apple
                           tree. ...
Clarence (PS065)           [2474] Do you mean where the daffs are going? [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2475] Mm.

                           side.

Clarence (PS065)           [2481] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2482] Where I've just dug there.

Nina (PS066)               [2487] I was wondering whether to ... put some ...

Clarence (PS065)           [2493] Oh I see.
Nina (PS066)               [2494] I'm just stumped where to put them.
Clarence (PS065)           [2495] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2496] I don't want to keep them in containers.
Clarence (PS065)           [2497] If it's an evergreen, no it's not is it?
Nina (PS066)               [2498] Fuchsia?
Clarence (PS065)           [2499] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2500] No.
Clarence (PS065)           [2501] No.
                           [2502] Mm. ...

Clarence (PS065)           [2504] Mm.
                           [2505] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2506] Most of the ones that we brought seem to have
                           erm
Clarence (PS065)           [2507] Survived.
Nina (PS066)               [2508] Survived.

Clarence (PS065)           [2510] Mm.

Nina (PS066)               [2512] Because we've got some nice ones.
                           [2513] And then those that Karen brought us, they
                           were nice.

Clarence (PS065)           [2517] Mhm. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2518] Well I thought they'd be ... protected by the
                           fence.
Clarence (PS065)           [2519] Yeah.
                           [2520] ... Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2521] Wouldn't have much room for sweetpeas though
                           would I?
                           [2522] I don't know though, they'd grow up behind
                           wouldn't they? ...

Nina (PS066)               [2526] The only problem being cutting the hedge.
Clarence (PS065)           [2527] [...] Pardon?
Nina (PS066)               [2528] The only problem being cutting the hedge.
Clarence (PS065)           [2529] Cutting the hedge?
Nina (PS066)               [2530] Mm.
Clarence (PS065)           [2531] Oh yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2532] But
Clarence (PS065)           [2533] But how often do you have to cut that sort of
                           hedge then?
Nina (PS066)               [2534] Not a lot.
Clarence (PS065)           [2535] Not like a privet [...] .

Clarence (PS065)           [2542] But I can't remember [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2543] I remember that ... in a little pot ... down
                           there and ... you know they were labelled?
                           [2544] She put the labels on.
Clarence (PS065)           [2545] Oh yes she did, a label mhm.

Nina (PS066)               [2552] and it nothing s , it didn't seem to survive.

Clarence (PS065)           [2566] Mm.
                           [2567] ... I've come across a bit of architrave by
                           the way.
                           [2568] Quite apart from
Nina (PS066)               [2569] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065)           [2570] [...] .
                           [2571] Erm ... [...] .
                           [2572] So I can use that as an experimental piece.
Nina (PS066)               [2573] Where? [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2574] [...] , there's stuff ... come to think of it
                           it's the one in the hall.
                           [2575] The doorway that's bricked up.
                           [2576] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2577] Oh of course.
                           [2578] I keep forgetting there was a doorway there
                           [laughing] when we arrived [] .
Clarence (PS065)           [2579] Yeah.
                           [2580] That's right.
                           [2581] [...] the architrave from there.
Nina (PS066)               [2582] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065)           [2583] Erm ... it's exactly the same varnish stain
                           as this.
Nina (PS066)               [2584] Is it?
Clarence (PS065)           [2585] So I can muck about on that piece before I
                           ... tackle it in here, so ... mm.
                           [2586] [...] stripping goes.
Nina (PS066)               [2587] Oh I see what you mean.
                           [2588] To to er see
Clarence (PS065)           [2589] Without staining, without [...] what?
Nina (PS066)               [2590] Mm that's true.
                           [2591] To see if w what colour we can get that we
                           like instead of this?
Clarence (PS065)           [2592] Yeah.
                           [2593] Yeah.
                           [2594] That's right.
Nina (PS066)               [2595] Mm.
Clarence (PS065)           [2596] First of all ... what's the best stripping
                           medium.
                           [2597] Whether it's gonna be gentle heat, whether
                           it's gonna be ... varnish stripper?
                           [2598] Paint stripper?
                           [2599] What the hell.
                           [2600] ... And then see the ... go on.
Nina (PS066)               [2601] Er w do you have to strip it?
Clarence (PS065)           [2602] If we want to change the colour.
                           [2603] Unless we're going to use a varnish stain as
                           such.
                           [2604] But it's very, and it looks a bit crummy,
                           that stuff I always think.
Nina (PS066)               [2605] Ooh [laugh] [...] .
                           [2606] Ooh well I don't know, [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2607] Mm.
                           [2608] See look at
Nina (PS066)               [2609] It's a big area.
Clarence (PS065)           [2610] Pardon?
Nina (PS066)               [2611] It's a big area to strip.
                           [2612] Why, wouldn't it
Clarence (PS065)           [2613] Well it's only what ... erm the architrave
                           ... the arch there ... this side, that side and that
                           one there.
Nina (PS066)               [2614] Well I mean if you had it sort of darker,
                           wouldn't it stain darker slightly?
Clarence (PS065)           [2615] Well as I say you can't stain varnished wood
                           Nina.
Nina (PS066)               [2616] Oh.
Clarence (PS065)           [2617] You can put a varnish stain on.
                           [2618] Varnish stain [...] but erm ... In ... in
                           this particular light now I can see ... where
                           they've put on thick blodges that run down.
Nina (PS066)               [2619] I know, it's terrible isn't it?
Clarence (PS065)           [2620] Mm. [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2621] I wouldn't think that was a professional job.
Clarence (PS065)           [2622] Oh what was?
                           [2623] I don't think [...] .
Nina (PS066)               [2624] But ... well originally what would they have
                           done with it?
                           [2625] When it was built?
Clarence (PS065)           [2626] Oh no I don't think, I don't think it's from
                           square one.
                           [2627] It probably would be varnished from square
                           one but that's not the original varnish.
Nina (PS066)               [2628] No.
Clarence (PS065)           [2629] Shouldn't think, no.
Nina (PS066)               [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2630] I doubt it very much indeed.
Nina (PS066)               [2631] shocking colour [...] isn't it?
Clarence (PS065)           [2632] Yes it is.
                           [2633] And do you know the old bog door, it's the
                           same colour as next door's.
                           [2634] Or was I should say.
Nina (PS066)               [2635] Was it?
Clarence (PS065)           [2636] The same yucky blue, yeah [...] .
Nina (PS066)               [2637] Was it?
Clarence (PS065)           [2638] Mm.
                           [2639] So ... if you look at the ... next time
                           you're in the loo
Nina (PS066)               [2640] Mm.
Clarence (PS065)           [2641] where the handle was, look where the blue ...
                           shows.
                           [2642] And that's that was the original colour.
Nina (PS066)               [2643] That w do you think that's what they did
                           originally?
Clarence (PS065)           [2644] Yeah.
                           [2645] The original colour, yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2646] Mm [...] when it was built?
Clarence (PS065)           [2647] Mm.
                           [2648] Mm.
                           [2649] Mm.
                           [2650] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2651] [...] blue didn't they?
Clarence (PS065)           [2652] It might of course have been a more
                           acceptable blue when it was put on because it
                           changes
Nina (PS066)               [2653] Do you remember that er flat that Lil and Nev
                           er went into?
Clarence (PS065)           [2654] Oh goodness.
Nina (PS066)               [2655] Before they

Nina (PS066)               [2657] No.
Clarence (PS065)           [2658] Where?
Nina (PS066)               [2659] They've not been in a flat [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2660] Oh Prestwych
Nina (PS066)               [2661] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065)           [2662] Yes. [...]

                           sold theirs
Clarence (PS065)           [2664] Yeah, yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2665] and were waiting for their other house up
                           here to be finished.
Clarence (PS065)           [2666] Paid a fortune for the damn [...] .
                           [2667] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2668] Well ... [laughing] that was all blue, do you
                           remember [] ?
Clarence (PS065)           [2669] No.
                           [2670] I only remember one
Nina (PS066)               [2671] Because when I ... when I went to see Lil
Clarence (PS065)           [2672] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2673] er spent the day with her
Clarence (PS065)           [2674] Yeah yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2675] and I hadn't seen the flat before, and the
                           first thing she said to me [laugh] wherever you look
                           in here it's blue.
                           [2676] And it was too.
Clarence (PS065)           [2677] Was it really?
Nina (PS066)               [2678] Yes.
                           [2679] Er it [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2680] Well how do you mean?
                           [2681] The paintwork was blue?
Nina (PS066)               [2682] Everything, yes.
                           [2683] Paint, decorations, everything.
Clarence (PS065)           [2684] What [...] ?
Nina (PS066)               [2685] Well n
Clarence (PS065)           [laugh]
Nina (PS066)               [2686] not every not every exactly everything but
Clarence (PS065)           [2687] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2688] as you got, went into the flat you got an
                           overall ... picture of blue.
Clarence (PS065)           [2689] Mm.
                           [2690] Mm.
                           [2691] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2692] Everywhere you looked was blue.
Clarence (PS065)           [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2693] I find blue a depressing colour even though I
                           like blue.
                           [2694] I mean I
Clarence (PS065)           [2695] Well it's [...] isn't it?
                           [2696] Blue for depression and red for excitement
                           and
Nina (PS066)               [2697] Yes but
Clarence (PS065)           [2698] What's a calming colour? [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2699] For a decoration in a home I don't like blue.
Clarence (PS065)           [2700] No, no.
Nina (PS066)               [2701] And yet young Nicky's gone for blue.
                           [2702] Blue [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2703] Well it's a change from black that [...] .

Nina (PS066)               [2704] Well yes they've got the black furniture you
                           know
Clarence (PS065)           [2705] They've got the furniture [...] of course,
                           yes.
                           [2706] That's true.
Nina (PS066)               [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2707] Mm.
                           [2708] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2709] Some of it looks nice, but ... I wouldn't
                           like [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2710] Well it'll ... die the death eventually won't
                           it?
                           [2711] I mean the stripped pine [...] really
                           horrible. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2712] Mm.
Clarence (PS065)           [2713] Isn't it?
Nina (PS066)               [2714] Yes, well I think ... I think it's overdone.
Clarence (PS065)           [2715] Course it's overdone.
Nina (PS066)               [2716] I like a bit but
Clarence (PS065)           [2717] It's blooming cheap half of it.
                           [2718] It is cheap.
                           [2719] ... Er no it isn't cheap [...] .
Nina (PS066)               [2720] [...] cheap.
Clarence (PS065)           [2721] God no.
Nina (PS066)               [2722] I wouldn't say that. ...
Clarence (PS065)           [2723] Cheaper than [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2724] It's a bit glaring to me.
                           [2725] I find it so, it's not as mellow as I like.
Clarence (PS065)           [2726] No, it's not.
                           [2727] [...] . It's usually crummy wood.
                           [2728] Badly assembled. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2729] Well it [laughing] depends how much you're
                           going to pay for your furniture [] doesn't it
                           really?
Clarence (PS065)           [2730] Well I mean the one that er [...] that er
                           thing, what is it?
Nina (PS066)               [2731] They paid a lot for that didn't they?
Clarence (PS065)           [2732] It's it's rubbish, that thing.
Nina (PS066)               [2733] Is it?
Clarence (PS065)           [2734] It's rubbish.
                           [2735] Absolute rubbish.
                           [2736] It really is cos
Nina (PS066)               [2737] Mm.
                           [2738] I'm not struck on [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2739] they moved it out when we went on one
                           occasion cos ... was the carpet wet or something?
                           [2740] I don't know.
                           [2741] They moved it out for something [...] reason
                           so ... I had occasion to look at it more closely.
Nina (PS066)               [2742] Oh.
Clarence (PS065)           [2743] I thought, I was looking at it before, I
                           thought mm.
                           [2744] ... Anyway ... it drew my attention to it and
                           I thought god god.

Clarence (PS065)           [2814] [laugh] No I don't think so.
                           [2815] I don't know I'm sure but he never mentioned
                           it anyway.
Nina (PS066)               [2816] I don't remem erm his ... I don't remember

Clarence (PS065)           [2818] [sigh] I've got a very hazy, but I could be
                           confusing it ... her with one of the other relatives
                           [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2819] I think ... she was ill when

                           and?
Nina (PS066)               [2821] Well no, I don't know.

Clarence (PS065)           [2823] Oh I, neither do I. [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2824] What did?
Clarence (PS065)           [2825] Auntie [...]

Clarence (PS065)           [2828] Yeah.
                           [2829] ... So it could have been his auntie, his
                           mother ... I don't know.
                           [2830] ... I wonder if John and ... John and er mm

                           [2834] Do you remember?
Clarence (PS065)           [2835] Oh yes, I vaguely remember that but I,
                           whether they'd actually moved or not I don't know.
Nina (PS066)               [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2836] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2837] I wonder what had happened to the stool.
Clarence (PS065)           [2838] [laughing] Which stool [] ?
Nina (PS066)               [2839] Th do you remember ... er who was going to,

                           made.
Clarence (PS065)           [2840] Oh the tall stool Robin made?
                           [2841] Yes yes.
Nina (PS066)               [2842] Yes.
                           [2843] And Rob and ... John and Liz were ... hanging

                           weren't they?
Clarence (PS065)           [2844] [...] actually.
Nina (PS066)               [2845] [laughing] I've forgotten [] .
Clarence (PS065)           [2846] I don't know!
                           [2847] It was a state of chaos then though wasn't
                           it?
Nina (PS066)               [2848] Well [laughing] I wouldn't like to move, we
                           are not moving again [...] [] .

Nina (PS066)               [2850] No way.
Clarence (PS065)           [2851] Never again.
                           [2852] [laugh] Well if we do we'll wait another
                           sixty years anyway.
Nina (PS066)               [laugh]
Clarence (PS065)           [2853] [laugh] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2854] Oh what an upheaval.
Clarence (PS065)           [2855] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2856] I don't know how people can ... move from one
                           place to another.
                           [2857] Do the place up then
Clarence (PS065)           [2858] Well
Nina (PS066)               [2859] move over to another place.
                           [2860] Oh heck, no thank you.
Clarence (PS065)           [2861] it depends on a lot of factors really doesn't
                           it?
Nina (PS066)               [2862] Mm [laugh]
Clarence (PS065)           [2863] Or a lot of factors come into it.
                           [2864] ... Age group ... finances
Nina (PS066)               [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [2865] desire to move ... for a variety of reasons,
                           erm ... [sigh] ... [...] permanently regarded [...]
                           house in the first place, you know?
Nina (PS066)               [2866] Mm I mean like in Jill's case, Jill and Steve
Clarence (PS065)           [2867] Yes, that always struck me as a bit odd, yes.
Nina (PS066)               [2868] I it's a big upheaval every few years isn't
                           it
Clarence (PS065)           [2869] Yeah.
                           [2870] Mm.
                           [2871] Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2872] to have to do it with your job?
Clarence (PS065)           [2873] Yeah.
                           [2874] ... Mm.
Nina (PS066)               [2875] And it's worse when you've got children to
                           cope with as well.
Clarence (PS065)           [2876] That and the obvious school problem too with
                           the kids, yeah.
Nina (PS066)               [2877] Mm.
                           [2878] I don't think it's good for them moving them
                           about from school to school do you?
Clarence (PS065)           [2879] No it can't be.
                           [2880] ... Well I don't know about that, I mean with
                           some schools it'd be a good idea to get them away
                           from it.
Nina (PS066)               [2881] Well [laugh]
Clarence (PS065)           [2882] And some areas, in fact.
                           [2883] I mean [...] ... really desirable to move
                           away from there wasn't it?
Nina (PS066)               [2884] Er well that's true.
Clarence (PS065)           [2885] Mm.
                           [2886] And privately it would be no bad thing to
                           move away from where they are now.
                           [2887] I mean, well they're gonna have problems
                           wherever they go, but ... the ... on erm ... a
                           different estate ... different type of estate, they
                           wouldn't have as many problems would they?
Nina (PS066)               [2888] Mm I don't know so much.
Clarence (PS065)           [2889] I don't think so.
                           [2890] Not as many. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2891] I've found out how to get rid of the cat
                           scratching.
Clarence (PS065)           [2892] No ... another idea?
                           [2893] What is it this time?
Nina (PS066)               [2894] No, it's not my idea.
                           [2895] Apparently you can get
Clarence (PS065)           [2896] No, no?

Nina (PS066)               [2902] I didn't know you could get it in pellets.
Clarence (PS065)           [2903] [laughing] Well either did I but []
Nina (PS066)               [laugh]
Clarence (PS065)           [2904] Yes [...]
Nina (PS066)               [2905] Although although inoffensive to people, cats
                           dislike ... the scent and avoid

Nina (PS066)               [2917] pellets come in a handy sealed plastic bag

Nina (PS066)               [2937] I'm sure it was in here somewhere.

Clarence (PS065)           [2943] Well er won't it be in the other one,
                           catalogue.
Nina (PS066)               [2944] Yeah, I think it was in this one.

Nina (PS066)               [2957] Mm. ...
Clarence (PS065)           [2958] It's not worth looking on the box for the
                           news because it's, they'll be nothing new. ...
Nina (PS066)               [2959] I can't find it.

                           [2970] A tiny little thing of the size of a tomato

                           like that.

                           before I only
Clarence (PS065)           [2991] Oh.
Nina (PS066)               [2992] thought about it when I was reading the
                           property thing ... it might be er while I'm in Leo's

Clarence (PS065)           [2993] Oh yes.

                           be an idea, although I wouldn't mind going in and
                           having a look.
Clarence (PS065)           [3000] Yeah.
                           [3001] You can have a look.
Nina (PS066)               [3002] But usually by the time I come out of Leo's
                           [laughing] I'm dying to get home [] .
Clarence (PS065)           [3003] Yeah.

Clarence (PS065)           [3036] There's no ... there's no price on there I

Nina (PS066)               [3037] No that's just the thing.
Clarence (PS065)           [3038] Ooh!
Nina (PS066)               [3039] It's a stupid habit, not putting the price
                           on.
                           [3040] ... People must lose sales for that. [...]
Clarence (PS065)           [3041] Well it's possibly at the request of the
                           vendor you know.
Nina (PS066)               [3042] I know they do.
                           [3043] But what I'm saying is people
Clarence (PS065)           [3044] Oh yeah I know.
Nina (PS066)               [3045] a lot of people, if they're, alright ... if
                           you want it, you're interested, and you're
                           interested you'll find out.

Clarence (PS065)           [3049] Oh no no no.
Nina (PS066)               [3050] You do tend to skip by if there's another one

                           too expensive, or whatever, yeah.
                           [3055] Oh quite, mm.

                           [3059] Or possibly [...]
Nina (PS066)               [3060] I don't see the point because you can pick up
                           the phone and find out if you want anyway so
Clarence (PS065)           [3061] Yeah.
                           [3062] Yeah.

Nina (PS066)               [3068] Er it doesn't say.
                           [3069] I don't think so.
                           [3070] Er the St Peter's Road one only had two
                           bedrooms didn't it?

                           handling agent cos that's not the photograph
Nina (PS066)               [3086] Well they won't change the bedrooms will
                           they?
                           [3087] One's got three and one's got two.
                           [3088] Can't be the same.

                           [3093] Unless it's a misprint.
Clarence (PS065)           [3094] Well ... misconstruction about the use of a

                           escapes there didn't we?
Nina (PS066)               [3246] We did!

                           outskirts of Prestatyn were quite nice.
                           [3261] Before you got actually into the town.

Clarence (PS065)           [3476] Well that I would have to fill of course,
                           obviously but

Nina (PS066)               [3481] Well what's the point?
                           [3482] It's a bad door isn't it?
Clarence (PS065)           [3483] Mm the rest of the door isn't too bad is it?
                           [3484] Okay.
                           [3485] Hm.

Clarence (PS065)           [3491] Variety of things.

Nina (PS066)               [3497] I doubt it.
Clarence (PS065)           [3498] I dunno.
Nina (PS066)               [3499] I'm just thinking of all the hacking about.
                           [3500] It seems rather extensive to me.
Clarence (PS065)           [3501] It may have gone too far, they may have
                           bashed away too much.
Nina (PS066)               [3502] I think they have. ...

Nina (PS066)               [3509] The the door jamb itself. ...
Clarence (PS065)           [3510] Oh well I've got to do something with that
                           anyway.

Clarence (PS065)           [3513] N no, no no.

                           casing which I'm not going to do ... yeah. ...

Clarence (PS065) [4526] And thirty something for that.
                 [4527] Thirty seven I think it was, something like that.
                 [4528] Could be wrong.
Nina (PS066)     [4529] Yes it is but I think this is the one ... erm this is

Nina (PS066)     [4536] [...] .
                 [4537] This, which?
                 [4538] This one?
Clarence (PS065) [4539] Yeah.
                 [4540] There wouldn't be room for the caravan to start with.
Nina (PS066)     [4541] I thought there would.
Clarence (PS065) [4542] No I don't think so, no.
                 [4543] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4544] I think you'd find there would.
Clarence (PS065) [4545] No.
                 [4546] I don't think there would be.
Nina (PS066)     [4547] That's ... well it looks like it to me.
Clarence (PS065) [4548] Mm.
                 [4549] Mm.
                 [4550] ... Full stop.
                 [4551] That'd be it.
Nina (PS066)     [4552] Just let's read what it says.
Clarence (PS065) [4553] Mm.
                 [4554] No room for a garage.
                 [4555] No ... parking a car is there?
                 [4556] ... From what I can see of it. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4557] Mm.
                 [4558] [...] style entrance door which opens
Clarence (PS065) [4559] Oh yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4560] to the entrance hall.
Clarence (PS065) [4561] It's erm ... important to remember by the way
Nina (PS066)     [4562] What?
Clarence (PS065) [4563] Well some estates, not many of course, but some estates
                 have got ... a no go area for caravans parked don't they?
                 [4564] ... Mm.
                 [4565] I don't think we're likely to meet it here to be honest
                 with you but yes you do get it.
Nina (PS066)     [4566] Ah well there's a caravan parked round the corner.
Clarence (PS065) [4567] Well I'm just saying [laughing] I just said that []
                 we're not likely to get it here.
Nina (PS066)     [4568] No.
Clarence (PS065) [4569] But erm ... it would be a damn sight safer down here
                 wouldn't it?
                 [4570] It wouldn't get vandalized, broken into ... scratched,
                 bashed or whatever. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4571] Grounds, here we are.
Clarence (PS065) [4572] Tell me, the
Nina (PS066)     [4573] Lawn, just a mo.
Clarence (PS065) [4574] Mm.
                 [4575] Go on.
Nina (PS066)     [4576] [reading] Property stands within established
                 principally lawned garden []
Clarence (PS065) [4577] Yeah I read it.
                 [4578] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4579] shrubs, trees
Clarence (PS065) [4580] Mm.
                 [4581] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [4582] Privacy from the roadway which is what she would like.
Clarence (PS065) [4583] Depends what you mean by privacy of course, but go on.
                 [4584] ... Privacy or privacy as they seem to say these days,
                 don't they, sometimes?
Nina (PS066)     [4585] Well I say privacy.
                 [4586] [laughing] I don't know [...] [] .
Clarence (PS065) [4587] [...] carry on saying it whether it's right or wrong.
                 [4588] Same with ... controversy and controversy.
Nina (PS066)     [4589] Controversy.
Clarence (PS065) [4590] I know, I still [...] .
                 [4591] It's a real controversy though.
Nina (PS066)     [4592] Yeah I [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4593] Controversy.
                 [4594] God, you've got me at it.
Nina (PS066)     [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [4595] You see?
Nina (PS066)     [4596] [laugh] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [4597] How easily you can change.
                 [4598] Good gracious me.
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4599] [...] Did you notice this morning on the box, the er
                 weather girl?
Nina (PS066)     [4600] No I didn't.
Clarence (PS065) [4601] She uses controversy and er
Nina (PS066)     [4602] Did she?
Clarence (PS065) [4603] Our friend ... what's his name, Mike is it?
Nina (PS066)     [4604] Yes [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4605] Yes.
                 [4606] He did the ... accidental I'm sure, controversy.
Nina (PS066)     [4607] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [4608] Mm.
                 [4609] And she [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4610] It's it's easier to say for some reason or other and
                 yet
Clarence (PS065) [4611] Well it is for us because we've always been saying it.
                 [4612] But I don't see any reason why it should be easier.
Nina (PS066)     [4613] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4614] Controversy, controversy.
                 [4615] It's just accent on the ...
Nina (PS066)     [4616] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4617] Mm.
                 [4618] ... Fed up with ... plaster up me nose and
Nina (PS066)     [4619] [laugh] I'm fed up with this stage altogether.
Clarence (PS065) [4620] Oh strewth, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4621] I'll be glad when we get it cleaned and we can start
                 the actual
Clarence (PS065) [4622] There's quite a lot of it to do yet.
Nina (PS066)     [4623] decorating bit.
Clarence (PS065) [4624] Well we're ... [...] it's ... it's the er ... first
                 principles, prepare your surfaces isn't it?
                 [4625] Which we're doing.
Nina (PS066)     [4626] Oh I know that.
Clarence (PS065) [4627] No.
                 [4628] But that's the ... mm.
                 [4629] Well we've finished the burning off ... in there.
                 [4630] ... Yeah so that's one pong gone.
                 [4631] [laughing] Very largely gone [] .
                 [4632] It still lingers on a bit though.
Nina (PS066)     [4633] Oh yes.
Clarence (PS065) [4634] There's not an awful lot more filling to do, but there
                 is a bit of course. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4635] Erm ... not plaster there's no more plastering is
                 there?
Clarence (PS065) [4636] I sincerely hope not.
                 [4637] No there's no more plastering.
                 [4638] No.
                 [4639] ... No.
                 [4640] ... Just filling now.
                 [4641] Imperfections you know?
                 [4642] Joints and [...] , stuff like that.
                 [4643] And that [...] , it's a pity about that [...] but ...
                 I'm leaving the damn thing [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4644] Oh, yes
Clarence (PS065) [4645] Fancy putting boss white?
Nina (PS066)     [4646] You know what they say?
                 [4647] Never trouble trouble.
Clarence (PS065) [4648] Oh I know.
                 [4649] If it works leave it alone, but
Nina (PS066)     [4650] [laughing] I'll say [] .
Clarence (PS065) [4651] erm ... on balance it's best left on and to just
Nina (PS066)     [4652] Well it is really
Clarence (PS065) [4653] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [4654] if we can get away with it.
Clarence (PS065) [4655] Oh yes.
                 [4656] I'd far sooner take it off and do a proper job but ...
                 well ...
Nina (PS066)     [4657] It er well it's easier isn't it, really?
                 [4658] But on the
Clarence (PS065) [4659] Well
Nina (PS066)     [4660] other hand, you might have problems with it leaking if
                 you take it off anyway, so
Clarence (PS065) [4661] Well that's a p yes exactly, yes.
                 [4662] Cos [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4663] No, if you've got to
Clarence (PS065) [4664] and I've got to scrape out all that horrible boss
                 white.
                 [4665] Cos it goes rock hard that stuff, over the years you
                 know?
Nina (PS066)     [4666] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4667] Boss white. [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4668] I wonder whether it was leaking in, when they ... put
                 it in in the first place?
Clarence (PS065) [4669] Do you mean that's why they used boss white?
                 [4670] Possibly.
                 [4671] Yeah.
                 [4672] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [4673] Well let's not erm ask for trouble because there's
                 [laughing] more than enough to do without having [...] [] .
Clarence (PS065) [4674] [laugh] Oh quite, yes.
                 [4675] Mm.
                 [4676] ... Have you noticed that by and large, not all the
                 time of course but ... I should say that eighty percent of the
                 time birds face that way?
Nina (PS066)     [4677] No I've never noticed which cos I'm
Clarence (PS065) [4678] Mm.
                 [4679] Cos see that pigeon is now.
Nina (PS066)     [4680] Oh yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [4681] In the tree, yeah.
                 [4682] ... [...] Mm.
                 [4683] By far the majority of the time.
Nina (PS066)     [4684] It looks like a picture doesn't it sometimes?
                 [4685] With those trees.
Clarence (PS065) [4686] Oh god, yes.
                 [4687] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [4688] I've never seen so many perch in one tree.
Clarence (PS065) [4689] Mm.
                 [4690] Facing basically west, aren't they?
Nina (PS066)     [4691] Mm.
                 [4692] That's true.
Clarence (PS065) [4693] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4694] [laugh] Look at that pigeon
Clarence (PS065) [4695] [...] pardon?
Nina (PS066)     [4696] sat there.
Clarence (PS065) [4697] Yes.
                 [4698] Yeah. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4699] The windows are filthy outside [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [4700] Mm.
                 [4701] You don't often get one pigeon though do you?
                 [4702] [...] There's usually at least two of them.
Nina (PS066)     [4703] Well you usually have two together don't you?
Clarence (PS065) [4704] Yeah, exactly.
                 [4705] Yeah. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4706] Ooh that door! [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [4707] Yes that was getting on my wick that door, yeah. [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4708] Shut up door!
Clarence (PS065) [4709] Mm.
                 [4710] ... I was bunged up before I started this.
                 [4711] [...] bunged up now. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4712] I wonder who ... I wonder who chopped and vandalized
                 all those daffodils round the corner? [...] ?
Clarence (PS065) [4713] Well ... and the fact that it was just their garden,
                 and as far as I can make out it was simply that garden, it
                 would suggest that she's fallen out with some kids or ...
                 something like that or somebody and ... yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4714] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4715] I mean why pick on one garden and systematically
Nina (PS066)     [4716] Well they probably thing, yes but cabbages?
                 [4717] Fancy taking cabbages!
Clarence (PS065) [4718] I don't think they'd been actually taken from what I
                 can gather.
Nina (PS066)     [4719] Well what did they do to them?
                 [4720] Oh just cut them?
Clarence (PS065) [4721] They slashed them about, yes.
                 [4722] Cut them all.
                 [4723] ... Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [4724] Peculiar thing to do.
Clarence (PS065) [4725] Oh according to Josie, I really don't know about all
                 the cabbages, it might consist of one or two.
                 [4726] Funny business, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4727] Oh it's a shame though isn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [4728] Mm.
                 [4729] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [4730] [laughing] All the time you spend waiting for the
                 blooming things to grow [] .
Clarence (PS065) [4731] That's Yvonne's mother isn't it?
                 [4732] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4733] That's right.
Clarence (PS065) [4734] Didn't Yvonne say she can be an awkward old devil?
Nina (PS066)     [4735] Oh I don't know.
Clarence (PS065) [4736] Mm.
                 [4737] So I sh
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4738] yes.
                 [4739] She's probably fallen out with some kid or other.
Nina (PS066)     [4740] You can't be sure of that.
Clarence (PS065) [4741] Oh no no no no no.
                 [4742] ... If there'd been a trail of destruction down the
                 road, then fair enough, but
Nina (PS066)     [4743] I couldn't er ... go and vandalize something, I mean a
                 thing like flowers.
Clarence (PS065) [4744] Mm.
                 [4745] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [4746] They're so nice that
Clarence (PS065) [4747] Well we think so.
                 [4748] Obviously there's others that don't think so, but ...
                 not everybody thinks so.
Nina (PS066)     [4749] Well a lot of people like, I mean most people like
                 flowers don't they?
Clarence (PS065) [4750] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [4751] Whether you grow them or not's a difference [...] but
                 most people
Clarence (PS065) [4752] Yeah, yeah.
                 [4753] Oh true, true.
                 [4754] They're not an ug ugly thing.
Nina (PS066)     [4755] like them.
Clarence (PS065) [4756] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4757] And I couldn't go and vandalize something that was
                 nice.
Clarence (PS065) [4758] No.
                 [4759] No.
Nina (PS066)     [4760] There's some peculiar minds some people have don't
                 they?
Clarence (PS065) [4761] Oh yeah it's very small beer really isn't it?
                 [4762] Compared to some of the dodges they get up to. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4763] It is really.
Clarence (PS065) [4764] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4765] Have you decided whereabouts you're going to put that
                 light at the front?
Clarence (PS065) [4766] Light?
                 [4767] Er well no the, well at the front.
                 [4768] Other than that, over the door area somewhere, I don't
                 know exactly.
                 [4769] ... I might stick it on a flying lead and wander around
                 with it for a bit ... and see where it's best.
Nina (PS066)     [4770] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4771] But I've got a rough idea where it'll go anyway.
Nina (PS066)     [4772] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4773] [...] of course is cable running to it ... providing it
                 with power.
                 [4774] I'll probably run it from the garage [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [4775] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4776] About the easiest source.
Nina (PS066)     [4777] On the corner I think would be perhaps a good idea, do
                 you think?
                 [4778] [...] ... Between the garage and the house. ...
Clarence (PS065) [4779] Do you mean the return?
                 [4780] If you come from the front of the house going towards
                 the garage, that little bit there?
                 [4781] There's two feet or something [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [4782] No.
                 [4783] I thought you were going to put it facing the front.
Clarence (PS065) [4784] I am, yes.
                 [4785] Well what do you mean then, the corner?
Nina (PS066)     [4786] On the co on the front of the house at the corner.
Clarence (PS065) [4787] Yes [...] , you mean literally on the corner?
                 [4788] The apex of two
Nina (PS066)     [4789] Yes.
Clarence (PS065) [4790] Well I'd have to make something to mount it on to go
                 right on the corner but
Nina (PS066)     [4791] Well I know that.
                 [4792] Well wherever you put it you're going to have to make
                 something to mount it on.
Clarence (PS065) [4793] No.
                 [4794] No.
                 [4795] No.
                 [4796] No.
Nina (PS066)     [4797] Why?
Clarence (PS065) [4798] It'll screw drive ... on to a flat surface.
                 [4799] Brickwork.
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4800] Yeah.
                 [4801] Certainly it will.
                 [4802] Yeah.
                 [4803] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4804] How high up are you thinking of putting it? ...
Clarence (PS065) [4805] [laughing] Above a vandal [] .
Nina (PS066)     [4806] How high [laugh] [...] .
                 [4807] How high is the one we've got at the back?
Clarence (PS065) [4808] Well so you've got to get up a ladder to get at it.
                 [4809] ... Er up a step ladder I mean, not a ...
Nina (PS066)     [4810] I think about, above the number.
Clarence (PS065) [4811] I'd thought roughly speaking in that area, yes but
Nina (PS066)     [4812] Er yes, well somewhere there.
Clarence (PS065) [4813] Ah well that would illuminate the er ... see if I put
                 it fairly close to the actual corner at the front side, going
                 down towards the garage.
                 [4814] Close to that corner, still lighting on the front face
                 but
Nina (PS066)     [4815] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4816] then a percentage of light will go round the corner.
                 [4817] Well [...] cos lights don't go round corners but
Nina (PS066)     [4818] What about on the garage above what about on the
                 garage?
Clarence (PS065) [4819] No.
Nina (PS066)     [4820] No?
Clarence (PS065) [4821] No that would throw the front door into shadow wouldn't
                 it?
Nina (PS066)     [4822] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4823] Mm. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4824] Well above the number then.
                 [4825] Cos you're nearly, you know, more or less on the corner
                 there anyway aren't you?
Clarence (PS065) [4826] Mm like I say that would be ... mm.
                 [4827] ... [...] ... Oh that way I can then get a decent cable
                 run I think to the garage.
                 [4828] For feed, you know?
Nina (PS066)     [4829] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4830] Mm.
                 [4831] Well that's the easiest bit, [...] .
                 [4832] To the [...] circuit, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4833] What's that then? [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [4834] That is [...] .
                 [4835] It will be helpful though, having a light there.
Nina (PS066)     [4836] Oh yes.
Clarence (PS065) [4837] Because at night, you get a percentage a a
Nina (PS066)     [4838] Yes you do.
Clarence (PS065) [4839] degree of light I should say from that ... street
                 lighting, but not an awful lot.
Nina (PS066)     [4840] Not the same, no. ...
Clarence (PS065) [4841] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [4842] No it is handy having the light.
Clarence (PS065) [4843] And for people coming in, going out for the step.
Nina (PS066)     [4844] Yeah.
Clarence (PS065) [4845] [...] whatever, you know?
                 [4846] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [...] ...
Clarence (PS065) [4847] It'll be a quite sufficient ... spread to, to cope with
                 the er ... entrance to the garage I mean, you know?
                 [4848] Mm.
                 [4849] ... I still think two rows of erm pavers ... stones
                 inbetween's the best bet for the front you know?
                 [4850] To put there.
                 [4851] There's only one problem
Nina (PS066)     [4852] You mean to the garage?
Clarence (PS065) [4853] Well the approach to the garage, yeah.
                 [4854] The drive.
Nina (PS066)     [4855] Like Mike's got at, in their [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4856] Er yes.
                 [4857] Yes.
                 [4858] Exactly.
                 [4859] Yeah.
                 [4860] The usual thing, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4861] Well you get a erm
Clarence (PS065) [4862] You get a what?
Nina (PS066)     [4863] You get a lot of weeds where the chippings are.
Clarence (PS065) [4864] No, not if you put sodium chlorate down.
                 [4865] Nothing'll grow then.
                 [4866] Good grief.
Nina (PS066)     [4867] The thing is if you ...
Clarence (PS065) [4868] If you what?
Nina (PS066)     [4869] erm ... I'm just thinking if, like when anybody comes
                 to stay
Clarence (PS065) [4870] Yeah.
                 [4871] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4872] and you run the car, or somebody runs the car ... the
                 other way
Clarence (PS065) [4873] Up the sides, yeah.
                 [4874] Yeah? [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4875] Well then you're going across, you're not staying st er
                 you're not on the pavers are you?
Clarence (PS065) [4876] No, well that doesn't really matter.
                 [4877] I mean the erm ... in fact, there's only one fairly
                 tight ... path you can follow to get the car in.
                 [4878] Into the side.
                 [4879] ... If you think about it.
Nina (PS066)     [4880] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4881] It'll be worth putting a couple of pavers on there just
                 to cope with the track of the pa er the wheels going in.
Nina (PS066)     [4882] Oh wouldn't that look a bit odd?
Clarence (PS065) [4883] Not necessarily, no.
                 [4884] No.
                 [4885] [laughing] I don't mean put down like bloody tramlines
                 [] .
Nina (PS066)     [4886] [laugh] What, like I have down the garden there?
                 [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [4887] A railway line in.
                 [4888] No no.
                 [4889] ... Actually it's quite attractive
Nina (PS066)     [4890] A walk you know walk
Clarence (PS065) [4891] that actually.
Nina (PS066)     [4892] Well it is but it [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [4893] I was looking at it again this morning.
                 [4894] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4895] I thought that. [laugh]
Clarence (PS065) [4896] Ooh [...] hark at her! [laugh]
Nina (PS066)     [4897] Yes.
                 [4898] Well I think some of the bricks could ... when you
                 decide wha which you're going to use and which you, mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4899] Well they want stabilizing a bit yeah and er
Nina (PS066)     [4900] I'll ... get some of those bricks up and put the stone
                 things down cos they look better.
Clarence (PS065) [4901] Mm.
                 [4902] Mm.
                 [4903] Mhm.
Nina (PS066)     [4904] As long as I can get, walk along and get to all the
                 plants there.
                 [4905] What do you think of that [...] ?
                 [4906] I'd definitely think about moving those other pavers at
                 the bottom.
                 [4907] There we were the steps are.
Clarence (PS065) [4908] Oh lifting them you mean? [yawning] [...] you mean?
                 [4909] Oh god [] .
Nina (PS066)     [4910] Yeah [...] .
                 [4911] That would make th give it a better erm
Clarence (PS065) [4912] Yes.
                 [4913] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4914] I don't see any reason for that, to be quite honest,
                 why they've done that?
Clarence (PS065) [4915] Well there was at the time obviously.
                 [4916] Cos do you remember there was that erm ... monstrous
                 ... creation I should say erection, [laughing] erection [] for
                 erm
Nina (PS066)     [4917] Oh I know that.
                 [4918] Well there's still some of those stones at, underneath
                 that [...] .
Clarence (PS065) [4919] The foundation, exactly.
                 [4920] I know, yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [4921] We've got to move those before we grow anything.
Clarence (PS065) [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4922] I've put some of the bricks over one side, so that'll
                 eliminate getting rid of one side of them.
Clarence (PS065) [4923] No, I'm not with you.
Nina (PS066)     [4924] Well where I've put me bricks ... they're
Clarence (PS065) [4925] Yes.
Nina (PS066)     [4926] on top of some of those ... stones that are underneath.
Clarence (PS065) [4927] I'm with you now.
                 [4928] ... It's fairly deep [...] eight inches down, the
                 bricks?
Nina (PS066)     [4929] I know.
Clarence (PS065) [4930] I know I went quite a way down.
Nina (PS066)     [4931] You did.
Clarence (PS065) [4932] I mean honestly you'd have thought they were building a
                 ruddy house there wouldn't you?
Nina (PS066)     [4933] I wonder what they did it for?
Clarence (PS065) [4934] That's only er I don't know.
                 [4935] It's the same with the ... greenhouse
Nina (PS066)     [4936] It was a right monstrosity that thing wasn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [4937] They'd have had a nine inch [laugh] thick
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4938] erm ... solid concrete ... path in the centre.
                 [4939] Who the hell
Nina (PS066)     [4940] I know!
Clarence (PS065) [4941] wants that?
                 [4942] In the middle of the co
Nina (PS066)     [4943] Stupid.
Clarence (PS065) [4944] er of the greenhouse.
Nina (PS066)     [4945] Talking about stones, we'll have to have a trip up to
                 the erm
Clarence (PS065) [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4946] that er ... yard to see if [...] .
                 [4947] You know when we went to see about the flagstones?
Clarence (PS065) [4948] Oh there?
                 [4949] Yes, yes.
Nina (PS066)     [4950] I've not seen any ... there's not been any more in erm
                 ... workmen in [...] .
                 [4951] It's a good idea that, going up there.
Clarence (PS065) [4952] Well ... [yawn] oh dear.
                 [4953] I've kept ... my eyes open [...] when we're going
                 through Harford
Nina (PS066)     [4954] No sign?
Clarence (PS065) [4955] and there's no signs of work.
                 [4956] Mark you ... it wasn't a brilliant day was it?
                 [4957] So
Nina (PS066)     [4958] No it wasn't.
                 [4959] ... Well we just have, must have just missed them.
Clarence (PS065) [4960] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [...]
Clarence (PS065) [4961] Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
                 [4962] ... Cos those were definitely new ones, ready for ...
                 placing in.
Nina (PS066)     [4963] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [4964] A, a pile of stones.
                 [4965] Oh yeah. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4966] So the old ones they'd have taken back to that yard
                 place wouldn't they?
Clarence (PS065) [4967] Well no.
                 [4968] No no, no.
Nina (PS066)     [4969] What do they do with them?
Clarence (PS065) [4970] No, straight to the tip.
Nina (PS066)     [4971] Well that's the place that
Clarence (PS065) [4972] That's not the tip.
Nina (PS066)     [4973] Where we went?
Clarence (PS065) [4974] Yeah.
                 [4975] That's not the tip.
Nina (PS066)     [4976] Well which was the tip?
Clarence (PS065) [4977] You've never been to the tip.
                 [4978] ... I don't think, no you've not.
Nina (PS066)     [4979] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [4980] It's erm ... Tearscross way.
                 [4981] You know the quarry?
                 [4982] Well ... the quarry area anyway, the same road.
Nina (PS066)     [4983] Oh so I've never
Clarence (PS065) [4984] You can approach it two ways.
                 [4985] From erm ...
Nina (PS066)     [4986] I thought it was there.
Clarence (PS065) [...]
Nina (PS066)     [4987] They had a lot of stones there
Clarence (PS065) [4988] No no no.
Nina (PS066)     [4989] didn't they?
Clarence (PS065) [4990] That's just bits they've had on various trucks.
                 [4991] Lorries and things.
Nina (PS066)     [4992] Oh.
Clarence (PS065) [4993] No, no. ...
Nina (PS066)     [4994] Oh I see.
Clarence (PS065) [4995] No no.
                 [4996] The tip is where I went.
                 [4997] The first time I went ... I followed the route
                 recommended by Peter?
                 [4998] Peter ... which on a map looks quicker but it isn't cos
                 it's a winding
Nina (PS066)     [4999] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [5000] country road ... single track in a lot of directions.
Nina (PS066)     [5001] Do they just heave the bricks?
                 [5002] They just heave them?
                 [5003] They don't
Clarence (PS065) [5004] Apparently yes.
Nina (PS066)     [5005] sell them off or anything?
Clarence (PS065) [5006] No.
                 [5007] No they don't they just ... they stick them on to
Nina (PS066)     [5008] Mm.
                 [5009] They'd serve our purpose very well there
Clarence (PS065) [5010] Mm.
                 [5011] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [5012] because there's such an awful lot to do.
Clarence (PS065) [5013] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [5014] We could bring them right ... well the two that are
                 down there could come [...]
Clarence (PS065) [5015] Yeah.
Nina (PS066)     [5016] It would save you a lot of cementing wouldn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [5017] On indeed it would, yes.
                 [5018] It would.
Nina (PS066)     [5019] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [5020] Mm.
                 [5021] ... I'll be giving that mixer a caning this year
                 though.
Nina (PS066)     [5022] Pardon?
Clarence (PS065) [5023] I hope to give the mixer a caning this year.
Nina (PS066)     [5024] I hope [laughing] you do too [] .
Clarence (PS065) [5025] [laughing] Yeah [] .
                 [5026] Mm.
Nina (PS066)     [5027] [...] wondering what to do next.
Clarence (PS065) [5028] Mm.
                 [5029] Oh yes, yes.
Nina (PS066)     [5030] When you come to think of it though it's s ... to me it
                 makes sense [laughing] to start at the top where we have done
                 [] and work your way down doesn't it?
Clarence (PS065) [5031] In some ways it is ... sensible, yes because you're
                 carrying muck down.
Nina (PS066)     [5032] Well of course you are.
Clarence (PS065) [5033] Yeah.
                 [5034] ... I mean down, when we've done down here we've pu god
                 ... been putting mats down and lord knows what to
Nina (PS066)     [5035] Mm.
Clarence (PS065) [5036] oh yeah.
                 [5037] ... Mm.
                 [5038] ... But the erm ... ceiling rose ... and preferably the
                 light switch ... could do with replacing [...] .
Nina (PS066)     [5039] Oh I know the ce oh the ceiling rose, they're horrible
                 those old things, aren't they?
Clarence (PS065) [5040] Mm.
                 [5041] Well the, the lighting switch isn't so clever either.
Nina (PS066)     [5042] No.
Clarence (PS065) [5043] And before ... I put too much back I want to have the
                 floorboards up to clear
