Looked so raw round his rear end.But she, she's restructured his insides.The muscle had wasted with the pressure of the double hernia.The muscle had sort of disintegrated almost.She's had to use what muscle she can to restructure his bowel.She's a marvellous surgeon.
*DIN:	It's   (        ) of money   (        ) isn't it?
*GIN:	Well the bill's nearly three hundred pound.
*DIN:	Oh oh!
*KEI:	Jesus!
*DIN:	Now that wouldn't be feasible in your case because  (        ) .So what we'd have to do is trade him in  (        ) 
*KEI:	Ooh ah.It's better my back.It's in my lower back.I think it's where it's been, been higher up I think it's more  (        ) 
*GIN:	Being what?
*KEI:	Well I've been holding it to save it.
*GIN:	Yes.That's why you should have aspirin to relax it.Cos it helps it mend.
*KEI:	Ooh. (.) I feel as if I want to   (.) it hurts and I feel as if I want to move it.
*GIN:	Yes.
*KEI:	He's told me be very bloody careful cos it can go out just like that.
*GIN:	But he did tell you to move?
*KEI:	Oh yes but very very gently.He said tell it you're going to move.Don't do anything sudden.Tell it you're gonna move.I like the way he puts it.

*GIN:	In Mrs  's surgery.There were two doggies in their pens still   (.) sparkers you know where they've had things
*KEI:	What'd do they do?Do they keep the doggie under sedation whilst he's healing up?How long has he been there?
*GIN:	Oh yes. (.) No, no Herbie's not under sedation.

*KEI:	How does he feel in himself?
*GIN:	Well he was   (.) he heard Audrey's voice in the waiting room 
*DIN:	 [laughing] Pretty bloody awful  [] .
*GIN:	and he was whining  ((whine)) .She said it's alright Herbie I'm here and he   (        ) for a minute.And I said he's gonna do damage if he's trying to get up at the door
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	the way a little Dachsie would you see?
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	So we talked to him but erm we didn't actually see Mrs  until about a quarter to eleven.And she said you know, on no account must he strain.Obviously he's got dissolving stitches in.On his insides.And she said there was so little muscle   (.) left.It had been so stretched and strained by  (        ) .But she had to do the best she could  (        ) .Peter will  (        ) . (.) And of course Audrey's not too quick on her feet you see since she broke her hip.So I was trying to   (.) help Audrey and that and help Herbie.So Herbie didn't try and jump in the car before I could lift him and trying to get Audrey in with her stiff leg. (.) And then get the rug across her  (        ) . (.) She didn't turn a hair when    (        )  (.) she said two hundred and ninety three pounds. (.) 
*DIN:	I suppose it's like anything.You get an estimate for it.
*GIN:	Well it's cheaper than   (        ) I suppose.
*DIN:	Parts and labour   (        ) .Parts and labour.
*KEI:	Eh?
*DIN:	Does it come with a three month guarantee?
*GIN:	Cheaper than princess   (.) princess Margaret or  (        ) .No Mrs  said she was very lucky.She'd been to three lectures  (        ) .One of the topmost veterinary surgeons in Europe.
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	And that's why Mrs  asked her to do it.She'd actually seen it done.Seen slides and been to lectures on it.I don't know it must be wonderful to be able to mend  (        ) .To rebuild his rear end. (.)  ((banging))
*KEI:	Hope he comes out of it.
*GIN:	Well as long as nothing breaks, nothing gets  (        ) .No, now way must he strain so she's, she's got some liquid paraffin to drop on his dinner. (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*GIN:	Quite a major operation.He's been ever so bright.Walking about quite well, he did turn to lick his   (.) under his tail but his little tail was wagging.And he was walking fine.He even stopped and had a tinkle.
*KEI:	See they don't know it's to hurt.
*GIN:	No   (.) no.No I think I think animals are fantastic they way they put up with pain.Because they can't tell you. (.) And after a major operation there he was wagging his tail and
*KEI:	You don't know the threshold of pain in animals do you? (.) Can't tell you.
*GIN:	Well no.
*KEI:	Very seldom you hear a dog or a   (        ) in pain.
*GIN:	Oh you do. (.)  (        ) 
*KEI:	Oh   (        ) 
*GIN:	What's the matter? (.) 
*KEI:	Odd.
*GIN:	What's odd? (.)

*KEI:	It wasn't!When I came up.It was late. (.) You were up getting dressed.
*GIN:	No.I brought you a hot water bottle   (        ) your aspirin.When I let the dog out.
*KEI:	Yeah but I didn't take it then.
*GIN:	You didn't take it then no  (        ) .You could have another one love.It would relax your muscles. (.)  (        ) ?
*KEI:	 (        ) 
*GIN:	No it's probably gone.Nature will usually tell you  (        ) . (.) What I always found with   (        ) with lumbar aches was erm   (.) putting the knee up sideways across your erm  (        ) . (.)
