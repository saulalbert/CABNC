Florence (PS09U)           [50] No
Fred (PS09T)               [51] I just think that, there weren't many small
                           villages in Northamptonshire that er well I didn't
                           hear of, if, you know, I didn't know of, even if I
                           hadn't visited them, but erm
Florence (PS09U)           [52] Wonder if she'll be staying in Wellingborough,

Fred (PS09T)               [57] No telling, how she's got to, we all obviously

Fred (PS09T)               [67] But there's one thing you've got to
Florence (PS09U)           [yawn]
Fred (PS09T)               [68] I've said to many years now about English
                           weather in a sense it's, it, it, it's got a
                           something of endearing quality, you don't like going
                           through the bad weather, but the fact is that we do
                           get generally good weather
Florence (PS09U)           [69] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [70] at times
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]

Florence (PS09U)           [72] Yes you know, you know what the weather's going
                           to be like
Fred (PS09T)               [73] Well you know what it's going to be like, it's
                           sort of a set piece each, each season
Florence (PS09U)           [74] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [75] but er, you can't say that er ... the British

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [83] you know I remember ever so clearly, when I

Florence (PS09U)           [88] it was nineteen forty nine
Fred (PS09T)               [89] and I remember one particular February, it will
                           always stand out in my mind because er, it's a
                           fairly long walk done to the factory from, from here
                           and every day after the midday meal, when I set out
                           to walk down there as quick as I could it had been
                           cloudy since, it was raining, every day without fail
                           I used to get to work soaked, first
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Florence (PS09U)           [90] What February used to be sort of reckoned for
                           rain didn't it?
Fred (PS09T)               [91] Yeah

Florence (PS09U)           [95] yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [96] when I got there, several times he used to

                           wasn't very happy about it to start, but they seem
                           to have settled down alright

Fred (PS09T)               [166] well we know I shall go through the fields,
                           but we can still take the short er cut through the

Fred (PS09T)               [176] top of the road, what road's that running off
                           from er High Street, South
Florence (PS09U)           [177] Mm, yeah

Florence (PS09U)           [183] yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [184] and that's the best way, it'll er, oh you'll
                           save ... ten minutes easy, it's a fair walk it, on
                           the main road
Florence (PS09U)           [185] I was hoping when they got that link road
                           through they might connect up, but I don't suppose
                           it, sort of roads gotta put parking towards the long
                           piece of
Fred (PS09T)               [186] Oh no, it won't be a

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...] ...
Fred (PS09T)               [189] no I'm afraid there'll be no footpath there,
                           in fact, it hurts me a bit that because they're
                           cutting straight, they're cutting along in line with
                           that pub public
Florence (PS09U)           [190] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [191] footpath
Florence (PS09U)           [192] One thing if they
Fred (PS09T)               [193] it's nothing wrong with
Florence (PS09U)           [194] if they put a cycle path along the edge of
                           each road when they build them
Fred (PS09T)               [195] No, they're not as sensible as they are you
                           ... remember in Prestley when we went there ... so
                           what er, perhaps, especially for solid places, solid
                           with the roads in Germany
Florence (PS09U)           [196] Oh in Germany yes there's

                           through Belgium and Holland just to get there, and

                           hire a bike I'm sure ... you know, but, I suppose
                           you're going along on the road, across the road I
                           ...
Fred (PS09T)               [207] [sniff] course that's, that's the beauty of er
                           biking it up the hill, that's some, there's so much
                           scope for not being on the road, you've got special

Florence (PS09U)           [208] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [209] the only one I want to know in this area is a,

                           it's incredible to me ... either ...
Florence (PS09U)           [217] Is it raining again?
Fred (PS09T)               [218] No it could do in a moment or two though it
                           er, it looks a bit ominous, you rub one or two er

Florence (PS09U)           [225] Oh it said in the, in the book when I read

                           the herb must have come from that
Florence (PS09U)           [228] No, er Jane spotted cos she said that's where

Fred (PS09T)               [384] Well, a lot of old folk er, I don't think
                           they're much bothered what they say, they know the
                           name of the candidates and they seemed to

                           them will be confused, but not enough for them to
                           have any problems I shouldn't have thought.

                           Labour because the truth is that even under the
                           Conservatives, all the years they've been in, and
                           all the years they've been reducing tax, taxes from
                           time to time, indirect taxation increased
David (PS09V)              [397] Oh I know, you only got to look at the VAT

                           many of them about these days
David (PS09V)              [402] Well it's just brought out a budget to paper
                           over a few cracks and make it look good because they
                           knew that, they've got no more chances this is it
                           innit?

David (PS09V)              [452] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [453] went for it, but

David (PS09V)              [454] well he apparently spoke to erm, he had quite
                           a lengthy conversation with Ron Atkinson apparently,
                           cos Atkinson used to be the manager of Tettron
                           didn't he?
                           [455] And he was telling them you know what a ... a
                           good club it could be, it's the ground
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
David (PS09V)              [456] they opened their own ground as well you see,

                           like Kettering, Kettering like the fourth division,
                           that would be brilliant ... be nearer to go wouldn't
                           it?
Fred (PS09T)               [459] Why they all have such a large ground

Fred (PS09T)               [466] near a ten, near the ground size of
                           Kettering's
David (PS09V)              [467] but they've got to, I remember when Rhys
                           played in that, the F A bars quarter final, two
                           seasons ago down here, they got well over a thousand
                           down there then, and you just couldn't move, that
                           were brilliant, all the way round the ground there
                           were about four of five people deep

David (PS09V)              [472] but they could win the league this, this
                           season and not go up
Fred (PS09T)               [473] That's right
David (PS09V)              [474] The Taylor reports got a lot to answer for

                           looked all round, couldn't see him, had to go right
                           back to Trafalgar Square and he was still looking at
                           the pigeons

                           and when they start shooting up, that's when, you've
                           got to keep them watered, and you've got to feed
                           them with that plant stuff do you know what I mean?

Florence (PS09U)           [3561] Does it?
Fred (PS09T)               [3562] Mm ... the water in my other pond is crystal
                           clear, see straight down to the bottom, and another

                           off my pond, if you let the sun on the pond it'll

Fred (PS09T)               [3566] see when the water comes back out the filter
                           it goes through this pipe right, a big unit type of
                           thing
Florence (PS09U)           [3567] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [3568] the water flows by, it's got an ultra violet
                           light in it and the ultra violet light rays kill off

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...] ...
Fred (PS09T)               [3585] They ain't very far apart ... they do grow
                           big you know
Florence (PS09U)           [3586] Yeah I know
Fred (PS09T)               [3587] There's this old girl at er the top of the
                           road you know, got them, she planted them half way
                           down her garden, right, when they'd grown to about
                           six foot high she said we could have the rest of
                           their garden, so we did, that's how come our
                           garden's so big cos people give our, give us the
                           garden
Florence (PS09U)           [3588] Mm ...
Fred (PS09T)               [3589] Council come round our house they'll say yeah
                           your garden looks big ...
Florence (PS09U)           [3590] If you can't plant them closer together,
                           instead of their roots going outwards they'll
                           probably go downwards ...
Fred (PS09T)               [3591] [laugh] Oh er
Florence (PS09U)           [3592] Yeah, might do, there must be a reason why
                           they say plant nineteen inches apart
Fred (PS09T)               [3593] Of all the hedges I've seen they've been
                           about eighteen two foot, about that far apart
Florence (PS09U)           [3594] I'll have a look see how far ours are apart
                           in the garden
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [3595] yes and they've put in there and they're
                           about two foot apart ...
Florence (PS09U)           [3596] Could be ages to grow like that, now it's
                           grown a real good hedge, in fact no it ain't a good
                           real hedge it's got massive great gaping holes in it

David (PS09V)              [3600] Who's got a summer house?
Fred (PS09T)               [3601] We were gonna have a summer house built in
                           our garden
David (PS09V)              [3602] Are you?
Fred (PS09T)               [3603] Yeah, that's, once the conifers are all
                           growing up, we're going to have a garden shed a
                           greenhouse and I'm gonna build a summer house up the
                           garden, that's by, by round where the pond is
David (PS09V)              [3604] What a proper greenhouse?
Fred (PS09T)               [3605] Yeah, but we want a proper greenhouse ...

Florence (PS09U)           [3606] No
Fred (PS09T)               [3607] One of those aluminium greenhouses
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Florence (PS09U)           [3608] they cost a lot of money they do
Fred (PS09T)               [3609] Mm, I know, that's why I was
Florence (PS09U)           [3610] cos it's made out of aluminium and you've got
                           to put the glass in, it's really expensive I tell
                           you
Fred (PS09T)               [3611] Mm ...
Florence (PS09U)           [3612] No, sheds are pretty expensive as well
                           they're a couple of hundred quid aren't they? ...
David (PS09V)              [3613] My mate used to fix sheds, the garden sheds,
                           had this little card with Chad on it said what no
                           shed [laugh] ...
Florence (PS09U)           [3614] I remember that record this morning, let's
                           think
David (PS09V)              [3615] Yeah, fine ... I'll bring it tomorrow ... I
                           even got it out
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...] ...
Florence (PS09U)           [3616] No I want the green, I want the garden chair,
                           I was thinking of getting a big garden chair and
                           stick it in one of those lean-to
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Florence (PS09U)           [3617] and lean it up against the garden shed, you
                           know what I mean?
Fred (PS09T)               [3618] Yeah ...
Florence (PS09U)           [3619] If a, bloody greenhouse on it's own, when
                           they
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [laugh]
Florence (PS09U)           [3620] seriously
Fred (PS09T)               [3621] When we had the gales a couple of years ago,
                           I was in the kitchen making a cup of tea and I could
                           hear all this glass smashing, and I went ooh what's
                           going on, and the wind whistled across the field,
                           it's all open field
Florence (PS09U)           [3622] Yeah
David (PS09V)              [3623] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [3624] it flies down their garden and in between the
                           two houses it acts like a wind
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [3625] and you get gale force winds blowing down
                           there and of course I opened the back door and there
                           were panes of glass flying past
David (PS09V)              [3626] No
Fred (PS09T)               [3627] Yeah, swinging around us, literally big panes
                           of glass and they were flying down and as soon as
                           they got away from the houses, it opened up again,
                           they were crashing down all over my drive and all
                           over the road out there
David (PS09V)              [laugh]
Florence (PS09U)           [3628] What were they from?
Fred (PS09T)               [3629] From the greenhouse
Florence (PS09U)           [3630] Oh
Fred (PS09T)               [3631] Something fell in greenhouse and broke the
                           pane to allow the wind to get into the greenhouse,
                           which is oh dear me, as soon as the wind got into
                           the greenhouse as I say blowing the other panes out
David (PS09V)              [3632] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [3633] and as soon as the panes been blown out, it
                           was such a force, it was blowing them between two
                           houses, smashing on the road, and in the end, once a
                           few more panes had gone that was it the whole
                           greenhouse, I sat there watching this greenhouse, it
                           just suddenly launched itself off the bit on it,
                           over our fence, it went, there was glass everywhere
                           for weeks afterwards, when I was cutting the lawn,
                           oh dear the

                           foot apart, there's only about that much between

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Florence (PS09U)           [4099] if they're two far apart, you get big gaps at
                           the bottom
Clive (PS09W)              [4100] Yeah, that's why you keep the tops chopped,
                           cos they actually comes out by themselves, they'll
                           come out

Clive (PS09W)              [4103] Yeah
Florence (PS09U)           [4104] so hopefully they should grow through the
                           fence, come out the other side and eventually the
                           fence will be hidden such as

David (PS09V)              [4117] B N P huh ...

Florence (PS09U)           [4118] British Nationalist Party ... mm that sounds
                           a good party to vote for ...
Clive (PS09W)              [4119] Have you had your leaflet through the door
                           yet?
Florence (PS09U)           [4120] No
Clive (PS09W)              [4121] You're obviously the last people to have them
                           then, I think everybody else has had them
David (PS09V)              [4122] I want the phone bill to lob into them as
                           well, but I ain't got one
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
David (PS09V)              [4123] all round the trees, like that woman did with
                           her husband ... cos she, she was a bit of a lunatic
                           and er
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
David (PS09V)              [4124] and er so one night she gave him, come in a
                           bit paralytic, wanted a drink, so she give him a
                           drink with a load of tranquillisers in
Clive (PS09W)              [4125] Mm, mm
David (PS09V)              [4126] he passed out that killed him and found him
                           in the garden, it took four years to find him
Florence (PS09U)           [4127] [laugh] really?
David (PS09V)              [4128] Whenever, anybody asked where he was, oh he
                           was abroad working abroad
Florence (PS09U)           [laugh]
Clive (PS09W)              [4129] Oh those trees will grow really quick anyway,
                           cos they're so many goodness in the ground in their
                           garden, it's bloody amazing never think to
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [4130] and I reckon what it is they spray the fields
                           with all this stuff
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [4131] and all that lot, yeah, and then when it,
                           when it rains you see cos it's a lot of clay
David (PS09V)              [4132] It can't be washed away so easy
Clive (PS09W)              [4133] Yeah it does, it all washes down into the
                           garden you see cos the garden's on a slope and the
                           field, the field slopes straight into the garden,
                           and when we have, when we really have lots and lots
                           of rain, you look out your back windows and there's
                           about that much lying there, cos it's running down
                           and it can't get past the houses, so it just builds
                           up and floods
David (PS09V)              [4134] Yeah, I shall make sure the er path between

                           the other side you see and then once the pond's all

Florence (PS09U)           [4222] All the rubbish goes
Fred (PS09T)               [4223] all the rubbish out of our garden is over
                           there, in the field
Clive (PS09W)              [4224] Yeah
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [4225] lots of all, lots of wire and bricks and
                           stones and old potatoes, you want to see potatoes
                           that grow in that field, there's never been potatoes
                           in that field before, but there is, we throw all the
                           dicey ones over the fence
Florence (PS09U)           [laugh]
David (PS09V)              [4226] Why don't you throw it in the dustbin?
Fred (PS09T)               [4227] The dustbin's round the other garden, the
                           field's nearer
David (PS09V)              [4228] I bet the farmer loves you.
Clive (PS09W)              [4229] It's alright growing potatoes in his field
Fred (PS09T)               [4230] Mm
Florence (PS09U)           [4231] It is when you've got another crop there
                           innit?
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [4232] We, we , we said it's about time they grew
                           potatoes in that field
Florence (PS09U)           [4233] So you could pinch them
Fred (PS09T)               [4234] Yeah, so we could, yeah, you know, it'll,
                           it'll be a lot better, I mean all they do is grow
                           either that grain or corn
Clive (PS09W)              [4235] Erm they wouldn't grow, they can't grow grain
                           or use two or three times in succession, but then
                           for that another seven years because it takes so
                           much goodness out the erm thing, there's so many
                           diseases and they got to change their crop after a
                           while
David (PS09V)              [4236] There's been corn
Clive (PS09W)              [4237] Yeah, grain's horrible because it's smells
                           terrible, it really gets to you.
Florence (PS09U)           [4238] They bale it all up through, when you go and
                           nick a load of bales
Clive (PS09W)              [4239] Like they use in the big railway days
Florence (PS09U)           [4240] No, no they've got a square
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [4245] round the top, so nobody will be able to get
                           into it, out the back anyway unless they're, unless
                           they climb through them, you can't climb through the
                           conifers when there
Florence (PS09U)           [4246] Yeah
Fred (PS09T)               [4247] you can't get through, no possible way

Florence (PS09U)           [4249] you will cos it wouldn't get through will it?
David (PS09V)              [4250] It will, they'll make a hole through it
Florence (PS09U)           [4251] They can't cos I've got that metal fence
                           through it
David (PS09V)              [4252] They'll go above the metal fence
Clive (PS09W)              [4253] That's right they will do, how high is the
                           metal fence?
                           [4254] Two or three feet?
Florence (PS09U)           [4255] Three feet, it jumped it at the moment, but

Marjorie (PS09X)           [4821] I reckons she's got blinking piles. [laugh]
Clive (PS09W)              [4822] We bought these two sloping chairs right ...
                           and Tony, where our seats were there was a big light
                           in the ceiling, a big round light there, and it
                           shone straight in the side of me eye [...] I said we
                           can't sit here.
                           [4823] How are you supposed to go to sleep with that
                           flipping light there?
                           [4824] I kept moaning.
                           [4825] So in the end I went upstairs, left Tony to
                           it ... and I came back down and I tried to go to
                           sleep again, I put me coat over me head and I
                           couldn't sleep so I moved.

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4834] I can't sleep with the light on.
Clive (PS09W)              [4835] No.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4836] [...] cos the, the gap between the chairs is
                           about six or eight inches [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [4837] And it hurts me eyes [...]
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4838] Well I don't you know, haven't got my hearing
                           aid on, I don't hear any noises in the night.
                           [4839] But if your dad switches the light on for
                           anything [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [4840] I always go to bed before Tony.
                           [4841] I'm ... I'm ... I'm terrible.
                           [4842] I'm sometimes in bed by half past nine.
                           [4843] And if he comes to bed and puts the light on.
                           [4844] He's got a lamp by the side of his bed
Fred (PS09T)               [4845] [laughing] And then you wake up and walk
                           sideways don't you [] ?
Clive (PS09W)              [4846] you can dim.
                           [4847] So I put it on the dim switch so as he can
                           see to get in the bedroom.
                           [4848] Now if he happens to knock it or he, he
                           lights it up or ... I always wake up.

Fred (PS09T)               [4850] [...] go and do some work.
Clive (PS09W)              [4851] If I don't put that light on and he comes in
                           and puts the light on, I wake up just like that.
David (PS09V)              [4852] What's the er [...] in the background.

                           like driving and the wheel's on the wrong side.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4898] Are you getting used to the opposite side of
                           the road now?
                           [4899] It's easy [...]

                           nothing to me now cos I, I live on my bike.

                           [4911] Very easy to simply turn into this lane
                           instead of going right the way over to the other
                           side.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4912] Yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [4913] You do it without thinking.

Gemma (PS09Y)              [4919] [...] why they don't change over in this
                           country because we're the odd one out and if they
                           make cars they've gotta make them ... with the
                           steering wheel one side or the other [...]
Florence (PS09U)           [4920] Well yeah but think of the chaos it would
                           cause, swapping over
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [4921] Yeah.
Florence (PS09U)           [4922] ooh think of the chaos it would cause [...]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4923] What you need, cos I remember reading about
                           when they changed over, I think it was in Denmark or
                           somewhere
Florence (PS09U)           [4924] Eh?
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4925] and at a certain time ... everything stopped.
                           [4926] All the traffic, it was all sort of er ...
                           arranged that at a certain time all the traffic
                           stopped [...] to the other side.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4927] To, to change this, the British road system
                           to the same as the continent would be easy.
                           [4928] You take away all the road [...]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4929] It would be easier for the car manufacturers
                           wouldn't it?
Fred (PS09T)               [4930] That's it yeah.
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [4931] Yeah.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4932] [...] have to make cars with the steering
                           wheel one side or the other.
Clive (PS09W)              [4933] Well I think it would be ideal
Florence (PS09U)           [4934] [...] take away the roundabouts.
Clive (PS09W)              [4935] I I think
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Florence (PS09U)           [4936] Roundabouts are better off [...]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4937] [...] congestion.
Clive (PS09W)              [4938] but I mean
Florence (PS09U)           [4939] No way.
                           [4940] No way.
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [4941] [...] I prefer them.
                           [4942] [...] traffic lights I do.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4943] No, they're no good.
Florence (PS09U)           [4944] Prefer them to traffic lights.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4945] Well [...] over there you see we don't get
                           many traffic lights.
Clive (PS09W)              [4946] You don't get many traffic lights or
                           roundabouts.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4947] Although in Germany [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [4948] [...] amazing roads.
                           [4949] You don't see any cars
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4950] three or four roundabouts.
Florence (PS09U)           [4951] Well you see i i ... yeah but it's a bigger
                           country and I mean it's so congested in England.
                           [4952] You've gotta have some sort of
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4953] Even in town you don't have roundabouts.
Florence (PS09U)           [4954] traffic control haven't you?
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4955] Well there's no roundabouts in the town.
Fred (PS09T)               [4956] It's all filtered innit? ...
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4957] It's all filtered on.
Fred (PS09T)               [4958] Mm.
Florence (PS09U)           [4959] Yeah but I mean I suppose it's what you're
                           used to.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4960] [...] got priority.

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4962] Well when [...] was there that fortnight and
                           it seemed ever so strange ... when we [...] car with
                           the driver sitting that side and all the traffic
                           coming by the other way, it seemed mad to me cos of
                           ... just those few weeks, I didn't get time to get
Florence (PS09U)           [4963] Ah ... no.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4964] acclimatized to it.
Clive (PS09W)              [4965] You'll have to come longer.
                           [4966] I told you you should come longer.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [4967] Mm?
Clive (PS09W)              [4968] You'll have to come longer. ...
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
David (PS09V)              [4969] It's, it's, it's a thing that could be done
                           in this country [...]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [4970] It needs it.
Florence (PS09U)           [4971] Yeah but when wh
David (PS09V)              [4972] But er it would cause chaos for a time
Clive (PS09W)              [4973] Yeah.
David (PS09V)              [4974] especially with pensioners [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [4975] Oh yeah, it would.

                           know what to call it and so Gemma said well I think
                           ... erm Eileen, Auntie Eileen ought to name it so
                           ... I, I was asked to name this duck.
                           [5001] So I said well I think Drucilla's a nice name
                           for a duck.
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [laugh]
Clive (PS09W)              [5002] And now they call it Drucilla the duck.

                           and the more he worries the, the, the worse he's
                           gonna get.

David (PS09V)              [5146] You've gotta [...] travel
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5147] That's the trouble.
David (PS09V)              [5148] all over the country and you can't do it
                           [...]

Marjorie (PS09X)           [5156] Yeah well
David (PS09V)              [5157] It's just a question of you coming and doing

David (PS09V)              [5160] You can't do any more.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5161] the other thing about coming over is it's
                           bloody expensive in England.
David (PS09V)              [5162] Yeah I know.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5163] You know?
                           [5164] And er ... w when I came over before and we
                           did Hull ... you know Warwickshire and ... [...] I
                           did twelve hundred miles ... in ten days.

David (PS09V)              [5166] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5167] you know?
                           [5168] I needed a rest when I got back. [laugh]
David (PS09V)              [5169] And it's a strain [...]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5170] It is, you know?
David (PS09V)              [5171] Especially these days on these roads.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5172] Yeah. ...
David (PS09V)              [5173] Well [...]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5174] Yeah.
David (PS09V)              [5175] And they er adopted a scheme ... last year
                           ... when they cut off part of the high street from
                           traffic.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5176] Mm.
David (PS09V)              [5177] And you went down the high street ... and you
                           turned sharp left ... and went along Dock Street ...
                           and circling [...] supermarket at the bottom end of
                           town
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5178] That's right yeah.
                           [5179] Yeah.
David (PS09V)              [5180] They've cut that out now.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5181] Oh.
David (PS09V)              [5182] You go straight down again.
                           [5183] And consequently the the high street ...
                           uncertain now
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [5184] Ooh
David (PS09V)              [...]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5185] Yeah.
David (PS09V)              [5186] And they're all doing their shopping [...] .
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5187] I'm er I'm a believer in ... er pedestrian
                           precincts ... you know?
                           [5188] Because if you want to do shopping or ...
                           just ... window shopping, you should park outside of
                           the town ... or on the outskirts of the town ... and
                           you can walk in or you can get the ... the bus
                           service [...]
David (PS09V)              [5189] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5190] It's just as easy.
David (PS09V)              [5191] But that's the problem, bus service
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5192] Well yeah
David (PS09V)              [5193] in this country today the ...
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5194] Well ... it isn't a bus service is it, you
                           know?
David (PS09V)              [5195] No. ...
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5196] Because you [...] feel obliged to them don't
                           you?
                           [5197] Providing a service.
David (PS09V)              [5198] [...] been destroyed.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5199] Yeah.
David (PS09V)              [5200] I think the best move they made in [...] in,
                           in recent years has been the introduction ... of
                           what they call the [...] ... and it travels all the
                           way in the town.
                           [5201] And forty pence you can get on and go up to
                           your home, they pull up outside our gate.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5202] Yeah.
David (PS09V)              [5203] And for forty pence
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5204] It's been a godsend for us to go down the
                           street shopping, if you've got a load of shopping
                           you just stop ... right outside the gate.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5205] Yeah.
                           [5206] They did that, they did that in er ... yeah

David (PS09V)              [5207] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5208] taxis.
                           [5209] You got [...] and you, you ... a taxi came
                           along [cough] and you paid him forty P or fifty P,
                           whatever
David (PS09V)              [5210] Mm.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5211] and you went anywhere on that route, yeah?
                           [5212] And if you said you wanted to be off the
                           route slightly, no problem he'd go around.
David (PS09V)              [5213] That's it.
                           [5214] Yeah.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5215] It has it's routes, it goes round and round
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5216] Yeah.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5217] and you can go on it ... anywhere as far as
                           you like for forty pence.
David (PS09V)              [5218] And you can do the lot for forty pence.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [...]
David (PS09V)              [5219] It even takes you over the hill into [...]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5220] We can get down on the high street any of
                           these times and it drops us back up here.
David (PS09V)              [5221] Yeah.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5222] It's a circular route all the time, it keeps
                           going back to ... the town centre
David (PS09V)              [5223] Yeah.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5224] but it's ever so useful.
David (PS09V)              [5225] Yeah.
                           [5226] I it's excellent.

David (PS09V)              [5229] for pensioners.
                           [5230] But a lot of youngsters use it too.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5231] Yeah but I, I think that youngsters ... can
                           abuse the system as well.
David (PS09V)              [5232] Well ... well so far it's it, I mean

Fred (PS09T)               [laughing] [...] []
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5617] That's why I didn't say anything before you

Marjorie (PS09X)           [5618] It acts as a mouthwash as well. [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [laugh]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5619] Is there any particular kind you do like? ...

                           and it doesn't even resemble it.

Gemma (PS09Y)              [5666] It's only like a little village isn't it?
                           [5667] It's not a, not a big town.
Clive (PS09W)              [5668] Oh it's, well it's three little villages
                           together.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5669] See there's no difference really from the

                           they were out you know with jumpers on and all
                           sorts.
                           [5678] They wear pyjamas at night ... and all sorts
                           they do.

                           [5725] They moved ever so quick [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [5726] Yeah these do.
                           [5727] Yeah.
                           [5728] This is Tony's cellar.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5729] Oh.
Clive (PS09W)              [5730] No it's, it's literally chopped out of rock.

Gemma (PS09Y)              [5732] Yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [5733] stone.
                           [5734] It's all chopped ... it's like a cave.
                           [5735] You go down and then ... you walk along here,
                           right to the end ... right round, sort of round the
                           bend there
Florence (PS09U)           [5736] Yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [5737] and there's a well.
                           [5738] He's got a well.
                           [5739] [cough] And this is really deep ain't it
                           Tone, this bit?
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5740] That's about forty foot down [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [5741] This is about forty foot down and then it
                           drops again
Gemma (PS09Y)              [5742] Oh.
Clive (PS09W)              [5743] into a well, where he gets his all, his fresh
                           water from it.
                           [5744] There's a li he puts a light on and it lights
                           it up down the [...] , a long way down.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [...]

                           [5746] You can draw water out, you can put water in,
                           and the level never ever changes.
                           [5747] Wonderful water.
                           [5748] It's really nice, ain't it Tone?
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5749] Yeah.
                           [5750] It's the only trouble though, they haven't
                           got any mains water.
Fred (PS09T)               [5751] Oh I see.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5752] Yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [5753] These are the same again.
                           [5754] These are over the rooftops. [...]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [5755] And anything that ... does come from the ...

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [5759] Lovely little villages though.

                           at the roads.
                           [5761] Ever such a job to get our car up there.
                           [5762] That's Philomena walking up the street.

                           days and then they put it into bottles.

Gemma (PS09Y)              [6501] Oh.
Clive (PS09W)              [6502] You see?
Gemma (PS09Y)              [laugh]
Clive (PS09W)              [6503] That's why it's famous.
Clive (PS09W)              [6504] Did you hear that Clive?

                           sorted them.

                           had his first campsite.

Unknown speaker (KC2PSUNK) [...]
Fred (PS09T)               [6514] Oh.

David (PS09V)              [6517] I didn't er realize that actually, yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [6518] Well where, where Tony lives there's that
                           village ... is over three thousand years old.
                           [6519] There's tunnels under the ground.
Fred (PS09T)               [6520] Yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [6521] [...] tunnels [...]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6522] Well you know the what was it, Romulus and
                           Remus?

Marjorie (PS09X)           [6524] With the wolf.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [6525] What's that then, hidden in the trees?
Fred (PS09T)               [6526] Mm?
Clive (PS09W)              [6527] Erm
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6528] Well apparently there's a, a golden wolf

Gemma (PS09Y)              [6530] Oh.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6531] buried in one of the caves.
Clive (PS09W)              [6532] I'm not too certain which cemetery but it's
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6533] And nobody's ever found it.
Fred (PS09T)               [6534] Oh. [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [6535] it's an important one.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6536] But it's, apparently it's supposed to be
                           there.
Fred (PS09T)               [6537] It's it's supposed to be there.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6538] But every day they're finding something new.
Fred (PS09T)               [6539] Are they?
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6540] Yeah.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [6541] [...] hills all round innit?
Fred (PS09T)               [6542] Are there still
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6543] Oh yeah they're still excavating it, yes.
Fred (PS09T)               [6544] archaeologists are still there doing it all
                           you know?
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6545] Yeah.
                           [6546] Oh aye yeah.

                           [6551] I, I liked the film of Hannibal, with Oliver
                           Reed.
                           [6552] Now that's quite good.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6553] Yeah.
Fred (PS09T)               [6554] Was it [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [6555] I've never seen the film.
Fred (PS09T)               [6556] It's very good, the film is.
Clive (PS09W)              [6557] But I mean round there it's absolutely
                           steeped in history.
                           [6558] I couldn't believe it.
Fred (PS09T)               [6559] Mm.
Clive (PS09W)              [6560] I mean ... er when they told ... the tales of
                           the ... of the seven winds and the ... was it seven
                           winds?
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6561] Yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [6562] The seven winds and Romu Romulus and Remus
                           and the, the, the wolf ... it all happened round
                           there.
                           [6563] And they reckon the golden wolf is still down

Gemma (PS09Y)              [6564] But [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [6565] there somewhere.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [6566] Rome is supposed to be built on seven hills
                           isn't it or something?
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6567] It is.
Clive (PS09W)              [6568] Yeah, seven hills.
                           [6569] Yeah we saw the seven hills as we drove past
                           Rome because you
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6570] Yeah
Clive (PS09W)              [6571] can see it.

Marjorie (PS09X)           [6573] Yeah.
Clive (PS09W)              [6574] Amazing place.
                           [6575] We didn't go into Rome, we went round it.
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6576] It spreads about twenty five mile [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [cough]
Fred (PS09T)               [...]
Gemma (PS09Y)              [6577] [...] for the time of the year it's gorgeous

Gemma (PS09Y)              [laugh]
Marjorie (PS09X)           [6584] Cos you're talking about thirty, forty mile.
Gemma (PS09Y)              [6585] I'm supposed to be trying to watch me weight
                           now.
Fred (PS09T)               [6586] Yeah?

                           [6591] Unless you've got two pictures of that same
                           street, no [...]
Clive (PS09W)              [6592] No, you're back to where you started.

                           rebuilt it.
                           [6607] In the same style as it was years ago, using
                           some of their old bricks and everything that they
                           could but ... it's been
