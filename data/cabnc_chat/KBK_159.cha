*DAV:	You can have a shot at red, you can do that, then I will do exactly what I did just now.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	Try and eh, I shall, probably get it even better, mind, most people would have a shot at those two I think
*CHR:	Yes, O K.
*DAV:	cos you're not giving very much away.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	The other alternative is just to go off in that corner over there.It's very negative.
*CHR:	Well, I yes, yes, I   ((laugh)) doesn't appeal to me at all. ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	 (        )
