@Comment:	conversation #47 (Tape 015403)
*BRE:	He said I thought I'd catch you out.Didn't think you'd be up.
*JEA:	Oh indeed.
*BRE:	Trying to get rid of his second run so that he can get home by eleven.
*JEA:	Oh yes.Yes.
*BRE:	Erm so he can go back on this   (.) late.Because he's been up, now he's used to it his body clock's telling him to get up.I mean that's what this morning happened.
*JEA:	Yes.Yes.
*BRE:	Quarter to one he said god is it time to get up Bren?
*JEA:	Ah!
*BRE:	I said no.Course he's been on it for six weeks.
*JEA:	Yes, quite.
*BRE:	Hates the blooming hours but
*JEA:	Quite.
*BRE:	course now they're putting them on at half past four   (.) you, your body clock's well out.
*JEA:	Yeah, yeah.
*BRE:	They said that, he's just phoned the firm.He's up in   (.) tut oh god where is it?It's up er Landsford Park
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	wherever that is.London I think.And he said that he'd phoned them and said could they change it and he'd finish at eleven then he can still start tomorrow night again at quarter to one .
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.
*BRE:	And he said if they can get someone else for the run they will.
*JEA:	Yeah.Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	But er   (.) mm what else was we saying?
*JEA:	Well we were talking about the general   (.) lack of faith in governments   (        ) 
*BRE:	 (        ) you was telling me about a suit.This guy fifteen grand turned up for Paul.
*JEA:	Oh yeah, yeah.Suit comes along   (.) and sits there sipping coffee.Takes about three quarters of an hour.I, I don't say that it was like being grilled by the K G B he was   (.) most polite and courteous.But he was going to find out where Paul  was.He was going to find out.
*BRE:	How did he get your address then?
*JEA:	Mm?
*BRE:	How did he get your address?
*JEA:	Well
*BRE:	When he worked in Safeways or something?
*JEA:	Yes er   (.) somehow they, they'd, they'd got it, or was it   (.) or did I have to fill in a   (.) a census form just at the time when Paul was with me?When he happened to be with me.
*BRE:	Right, yeah.
*JEA:	They knew anyway.They knew that he'd been here.Er and I mean Paul wasn't trying to dodge anything.
*BRE:	No.Well that's what they say if there's, even people that come over here for a holiday for three months   (.) have to pay it don't they?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	Sort of twice.
*JEA:	So   (.) er   (.) and god knows what it's costing them to collect.
*BRE:	Did Neil have to pay it?
*JEA:	Oh yes.Not, not the full amount.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	He pays the small amount and in fact I keep on meaning at the back of my brain   (.) to get hold of him and say has he been paying it.Cos when, when he was down at Andy's Aerials I think he used to go on foot to the post office every week.When he got his   (.) giro I think he used to pay   (.) then and there.It's only about a pound eighty a week or something for him.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	 ((cough)) He was paying it and I must make sure that he is paying it.
*BRE:	Yeah you'd better check it cos if, those one er pound eighty adds up don't they?
*JEA:	Oh yes if it, it will be moi who has to foot the bill.There's no question on that one.
*BRE:	No.No what about erm   (.) your other friends.What, what are they gonna do?The ones that have got their, Shirley and Terry that have got their house on the market?
*JEA:	They're not sure whether they're going to sell because er  (.) 
*BRE:	Can they afford to stay?
*JEA:	Marginally, now that Shirley has got a job.That   (        ) 
*BRE:	So they just sort of put it on the market to see if it would sell?
*JEA:	Well at the time they put it on the market we, we all three thought that it would be a good idea if, if both families   (.) sold up and moved into something smaller and perhaps moved   (.) near to each other 
*BRE:	each other.
*JEA:	in Stowmarket.But now I, I just don't think that's going to happen.I, I don't, I honestly Brenda I don't know whether I'm going to come back down here.Whether I'm going to move to Norwich.Whether I'm going to stay in Stowmarket.So to be truthful Brenda, I'm happier not thinking about it.
*BRE:	You've just gotta   (.) what mood, the mood sort of takes you.
*JEA:	Exactly.Er at the moment I'm, I mean I'm even thinking of, of redecorating   (.) my bedroom.
*BRE:	Dave even came up with an idea we was talking about the other day.And he said what, why doesn't Jean rent?Put your money in the capital, rent and live on the capital.Let the interest rent.
*JEA:	Well I have thought about that vaguely Brenda.It'll all depend on what the situation is when I sell.
*BRE:	He said that cos then, you know he said she she would have no upkeep of the house.
*JEA:	Mm.That's right.That's right.But I, I don't know whether Dave has, I mean   (.) you see   (.) my friend Pam  whose husband Steve is an airline pilot   (.) she knows quite a bit about this because   (.) Steve was an illegitimate child in London, in West Ham.His mother was an office cleaner   (.) and she conceived Steve by a married man.Erm a poor, working class man.No question of a divorce and marriage, she just had to get on with it.She was able to keep Steve because where she lived   (.) within the er there was a little coronet of little tatty houses that have since been pulled down   (.) and she was related to fifteen   (.) in fifteen out of the twenty two houses she had a relative.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	So she could always dump the baby on somebody.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	She'd got built-in babysitting facilities.And   (.) Steve knows a lot about being poor.And Pam said that Steve said to her that when he was at West Ham grammar school, boys grammar school   (.) everybody knew that the people who were best off were the council house people.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	If you were in private accommodation you were noth , you were nothing like so well off.You see I have lived in private rented accommodation   (.) with my mother in the late nineteen thirties.
*BRE:	I'll just open these doors cos it'll be too cold to go out there once we go out. (.) so cold with the glass
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and the trouble is if you don't have the    (.)  (        ) here
*JEA:	Yes  (        ) .
*BRE:	to circulate and
*JEA:	And the trouble is that the, the, the English landlord has a name for being greedy. (.) And it, it wasn't very nice Brenda because   (.) landlords are entitled to inspect where you live.Or they were.
*BRE:	Yeah but you wouldn't b I mean like Dave said because er 
*JEA:	Because it wasn't very comfortable.You can't do exactly what you want   (.) in, in a rented place.You can't go putting up shelves and things 
*BRE:	Yeah but in searching I mean   (.) Sorry?
*JEA:	You can't go putting up shelves. (.) If you put shelves on the wall in a rented house   (.) those those shelves immediately belong to the landlord.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	That was the law then.It may not be so now.
*BRE:	No I was gonna say yeah because   (.) I know Cheryl and Andy they, they had er erm   (.) th they rented a four bedroom detached house.And they even actually decorated.The landlord said to him you know   (.) she, she she sort of took a lease out for three years on it.
*JEA:	Yes.But until recently   (.) there hasn't been a lot of rented accommodation.And   (.) landlords have probably been quite pleased to get a decent tenant.When my Mary-Ann had her rented rooms in Herne Hill   (.) they had the top floor of a   (.) of a three floor house.And their landlord who was Polish was ever so delighted with them.And he said, you know he talked to them and he said you can do whatever you like   (.) because   (.) Mary-Ann and Mitch were superior people.They were going to keep the place clean.They were going to keep it warm.They weren't going to, to have wild parties.
*BRE:	Mm.But, but her place she had   (.) erm it was unfurnished erm   (.) but it was fantastic.
*JEA:	Dave has got a point.And the thought has crossed my mind.And thank him very much for his idea and I will
*BRE:	He makes me laugh cos he often says some , when I, it's when I've spoken to you on the phone
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	and I'll come back and he'll say   (.) has Jean thought about renting Bren?I said she don't wanna rent and he said why?He said if she then sold her house he said   (.) put the capital he said   (.) alright he said she   (.) with not buying a you know, another house now   (.) you know the fact is he said alright   (.) if she got one in her area or wherever.He said then she can put her capital he says and the interest on the capital
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	that can pay the rent.
*JEA:	Mm.But you see
*BRE:	And I said yeah but then she's got no house   (.) to lead to a
*JEA:	Mm.And you're at the mercy of the landlord putting the rent up Brenda.I mean I know that people have been hit by the mortgage rise and of course in my lifetime   (.) I've never known anything like this.Nobody has.
*BRE:	Well like I mean I said to him I don't think, you know I mean   (.) it was just ideas I think he said I'm not saying do it.
*JEA:	Yes.And I'm glad of people's ideas because
*BRE:	But I said I don't think it's a good idea.And   (.) and I said he's got, you know she'd have nothing to leave.And he said yeah but both her children are 
*JEA:	Well my children are not worried about that.
*BRE:	That's what he said.He said they're both   (.) you know 
*JEA:	No they're not.They're not.
*BRE:	he said   (.) he said not knowing her children he said but knowing what he sort of picked up about your kids
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	he said.You know to them he said it wouldn't be matter if there was nothing.
*JEA:	No it wouldn't.
*BRE:	Because they're both sort of comfortable and
*JEA:	Very.
*BRE:	you know and
*JEA:	Very.
*BRE:	their more concerned Jean's getting on with her life herself now
*JEA:	Yes.Yes.Yes.
*BRE:	than worrying about her   (.) you know sort of on, on the doorstep saying oh you've got to look after me.Here's the money.
*JEA:	Quite.Quite.
*BRE:	Look after me.
*JEA:	They don't want that.They do not, no 
*BRE:	You know they don't want it.Erm   (.) different if you was really ill.
*JEA:	Oh yes.
*BRE:	But I mean, you know as it stands I mean you wouldn't want it and they wouldn't want it.
*JEA:	Mm.No.No.
*BRE:	They, they're quite happy you letting them get on with their life.
*JEA:	Yes.Yes.
*BRE:	Erm   (.) but then you haven't got the security of renting I don't think.Like you say you're at the mercy.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	I mean the fact you can do things and, alright you haven't got the upkeep if repairs need doing   (.) but I think that keeps you going.You've got your house.
*JEA:	Yes it does.It it gives me an interest you know?
*BRE:	I, I agree you don't need that great big house.
*JEA:	No I don't.I'd be glad to get rid of the great ox   (.) but I can't so there's an end of it.And
*BRE:	Yeah but eventually you will.I mean 
*JEA:	It will s , it will sell .
*BRE:	you   (.) leave it on the market and I mean.
*JEA:	I mean it's not as though I've bought a house which has got anything   (.) wrong with it.It's not on top of a nuclear plant, it it's not next door to a pub.It it hasn't got
*BRE:	Oh it's a very sellable house in the right 
*JEA:	It's a very sellable house yes.
*BRE:	but I mean, it's just ridiculous at the moment.Because you know you would think near Lacydere the houses are sellable.But I mean they're not.
*JEA:	No.No.
*BRE:	You know and   (.) in this area, that's what the guy was saying   (.) houses over a hundred thousand are not selling.
*JEA:	No.We're both 
*BRE:	Ninety five.
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	But people want more the sixty   (.) seventy thousand.
*JEA:	Yeah.Yeah.
*BRE:	There's no way.You know I mean, you know people have got these beautiful big houses like Lacydere Well this is worth two hundred you know   (.) hundred and eighty five it's gotta be. (        ) say no.
*JEA:	A house a house is only worth er what people will give for it.I read many years ago that houses are part of the   (.) really the last true free market
*BRE:	Well
*JEA:	where a willing buyer meets a willing seller.It's on a house is only worth what somebody will give.
*BRE:	But there was an , it's it's like Sylvie was telling me that, you know who works for the mortgage   (        ) she was saying, it was erm   (.) for an incident   (.) there was a house, you know The Grove, those great big Victorian houses?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Now I don't know what they were worth and she was saying   (.) they must have been worth quite a bit cos they're big detached solid houses aren't they?
*JEA:	The Grove is a mixture.Some are semi's.
*BRE:	Yeah well this one was one of those big, four storeys.I mean enormous it might have even been fi  (.) but it, it had bedrooms and bathrooms and
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and it had a big basement and everything on it.And that she said was repossessed and it went for seventy five thousand.And then she said on the, she said I looked at houses like this she said
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and they were about a hundred and twenty five
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	in a state.
*JEA:	Yeah.Yeah.I could   (.) I could buy at the moment
*BRE:	In Guildford I mean you can buy houses at Guildford at sixty   (.) fifty five, from fifty five to seventy five.And there was no way you could have done that three years ago.
*JEA:	No.Erm erm I'm keeping, I'm keeping my   (.) mind flexible.The first   (.) the first firm offer I get   (.) now and let's put it like this.I've put the, the estate agent has put a number on the house.As far as he and I are concerned it's just a number.And that is a hundred and two.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	If somebody comes along and offers me   (.) ninety   (.) I shall say well what about ninety two?And they might say   (.) alright.Because people are being encouraged to offer you silly prices.
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	But I shall say   (.) what about, I shall say to the estate agent   (.) how determined are these people to move?What's the man's situation?Has he got to move because of his job or
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	whatever? (.) Having got a.
