*CHR:	Well that's what counts isn't it?
*DAV:	Yes.
*CHR:	So I'm now going straight for the black?
*DAV:	Oh no.You can move the yellow, can't you?
*CHR:	Oh yes.Yes I see.
*DAV:	What I would do, because you haven't got a blue   (        ) hard enough is to push yellow off somewhere to the left of black
*CHR:	Yes?
*DAV:	so you can only push it across to three and get near the yellow, near the black.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	You must you must get at least a ball a pioneer ball near your next two
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	to stand a chance.
*CHR:	Okay.Fine.
