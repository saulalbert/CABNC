Evelyn (PS03T)             [167] Where you going to put it that's the ...
                           important thing.

Arthur (PS03S)             [173] This?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [174] Yes.
Arthur (PS03S)             [175] Well I ain't bothered about that yet!
                           [176] We got other things to do haven't we?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [177] Well if you wanted it, if you, now you've
                           bought it you want to decide where you're going to

                           [181] But I was just wondering where you was gonna
                           put it.
Arthur (PS03S)             [182] And I thought it'd be extra
Evelyn (PS03T)             [183] Can't over the radiator.
Arthur (PS03S)             [184] Well she'll want it in the house and all that!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [185] I know.

Arthur (PS03S)             [192] Then he can come and look any time.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [193] Yeah.

Arthur (PS03S)             [195] I like it very much don't you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [196] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [197] It's unusual to say the least.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [198] I think it's er
Arthur (PS03S)             [199] I shall ask how, when it was taken.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [200] Last summer.
                           [201] After that building at the back was finished.

Arthur (PS03S)             [203] Yes, cos it's there.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [210] Yeah.
                           [211] But you didn't prune it until about ...
                           October did you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [212] No.

                           garden.
Arthur (PS03S)             [215] So er, it's

                           that?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [218] Well it couldn't be recently could it ...
                           because the flowers are out?
Arthur (PS03S)             [219] Well that's another point.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [220] You can tell which flowers are in bloom.
Arthur (PS03S)             [221] Do you think they will like it?
                           [222] You know, to buy one?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [223] What next door?

                           soon.
                           [244] Tom doesn't like going out.

                           [547] I've not seen him.
Arthur (PS03S)             [548] Well didn't you wave to him through the
                           window?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [549] No, not today.
Arthur (PS03S)             [550] Oh.

                           stopped, he was doing his shopping and ... in the
                           afternoon.
                           [552] And he ... and we didn't really ... I only
                           just saw him fleetingly.

Arthur (PS03S)             [554] Well ho , how old would he be?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [555] He's a year younger than me.
Arthur (PS03S)             [556] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [557] And she's not as old as me either.
                           [558] Yet I could I give her quite a few couldn't
Arthur (PS03S)             [559] Mm.

                           [566] ... And er ... should we leave the heat on all
                           night?
Arthur (PS03S)             [567] I could do I suppose.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [568] If it's going to be cold.
                           [569] Mm?
                           [570] We don't want any freeze ups do we?
                           [571] Or should we leave it on ... pretty late, turn
                           it off later?
                           [572] ... You can do as you want.
Arthur (PS03S)             [573] Wouldn't hurt to leave it on will it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [574] No.
                           [575] You might get a hot in the night.
                           [576] Well, you do and yet ... we want heat in the,
                           in the pipes.

                           [579] If you wanna hear Any Questions at eight fifty
                           five.
Arthur (PS03S)             [580] You can always have certain procedures.
                           [581] I suppose I haven't got to keep within in that
                           parameter.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [582] What do you mean?
                           [583] ... It's about time you you ... switched ...
                           the heating and learnt how to do it.
                           [584] And bothered yourself with it, you know how to
                           do it but you don't ... can't be bothered to do it.
Arthur (PS03S)             [585] Ha!
                           [586] It's not that.
                           [587] I don't like mundane jobs.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [588] Mm, that's not
Arthur (PS03S)             [589] It's women's work.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [590] No it isn't.
                           [591] ... Do you want any more cake?
Arthur (PS03S)             [592] No thank you.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [593] Well don't drink that too quickly!

                           [602] ... Will you want any coffee later?
Arthur (PS03S)             [603] No.
                           [604] There's no rush.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [605] Suppose I better put some on, I've used it all
                           up.
Arthur (PS03S)             [606] Finish with engines.

                           was but ... I don't think I'll get it again.

                           which you haven't?

                           [667] Life doesn't change much does it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [668] Well!

Evelyn (PS03T)             [1224] Especially on a sunny day.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [1236] Are you not bothered?
Arthur (PS03S)             [1237] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1238] I thought you wanted a beer?
Arthur (PS03S)             [1239] Well I wouldn't mind one but ... just have to
                           walk

Evelyn (PS03T)             [1271] Change your butcher!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1272] He might object.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1273] Who might?
Arthur (PS03S)             [1274] The butcher.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1275] He didn't even know did he?
Arthur (PS03S)             [1276] He would if you was having to pay ... on your

Arthur (PS03S)             [1279] The bread's stodge!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1280] Not, not wholemeal bread's not.
                           [1281] Got to eat it.
                           [1282] ... Have you seen my honeycomb?
                           [1283] Oh aye!

Arthur (PS03S)             [1289] it, well er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1290] It's a Ford.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1291] different then.
                           [1292] It seems longer than the one he had.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1293] Don't think so.
                           [1294] I didn't think it was as big.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1295] Mm.
                           [1296] Looks so to me.
                           [1297] ... They seem to use them a lot, buses, don't
                           they?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1298] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1299] That's one thing, this weather'll keep the
                           skateboarders ... at bay wouldn't it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1300] I'm not so sure if it's sunny.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1301] How parents can spend all that money ... for
                           them to run down on the chest ... paddling with
                           their hands on the dirty pavement!
                           [1302] And then they have to carry them all the way
                           back up the hill!
                           [1303] Seems pointless to me!
                           [1304] ... I were making models when I were their
                           age.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1305] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1306] I don't suppose they wash when they go in do
                           they?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1307] Course they do!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1308] No.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1309] More than when you were a kid I expect!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1310] Teachers used to look at our hands.
                           [1311] You have to turn them, see and look
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1312] I know.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1313] says turn the palm of your hands
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1314] Yes!
                           [1315] I know!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1316] and inspects it if you've washed them.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1317] I mean mo most kids have two showers a day
                           these days!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1318] Well th , we used to fool them though we had,
                           we had ... celluloid collars we used to spit on and
                           then rub your sleeve to ... and er ... you know your
                           boots, you had black boots?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1319] Oh yeah!
                           [1320] And rub on the back of your sock!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1321] We used to,ru [laughing] on the back of your
                           , back of your socks [] !
                           [1322] ... I wonder if they do that now?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1323] Course they don't, because they have trainers
                           and they're always mucky!
                           [1324] ... I think they're horrible they are!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1325] Well they look mucky in the shops!
                           [1326] And that's
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1327] Well no they don't, not originally.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1328] Well they don't look like there's, the boots
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1329] Well they're damn clean!
                           [1330] Now, nip all that up and eat it.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1331] They don't look like the boot and shoes we
                           used to swe , wear.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1332] I know that!
                           [1333] ... Eat all that up.
                           [1334] All that
Arthur (PS03S)             [1335] It's in
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1336] bread.
                           [1337] And don't save it for the birds.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1338] It's indelicate to , indelicate to mop your
                           plate with a piece of bread, you know that!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1339] It's not.
                           [1340] French do it all the time!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1341] Well we're not French.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1342] Ah!
                           [1343] You want to eat more bread you do!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1344] What's it supposed to do for you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1345] Well ... fibre.
                           [1346] Keep you in good health.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1347] Your cooking does that.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1348] Mm!
                           [1349] Flatterer!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1350] Was your father a good eater?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1351] No.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1352] For breakfast?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1353] I don't think he e , he eat much breakfast.
                           [1354] He used to cook ours.
                           [1355] But, I don't ever remember seeing him sit
                           down to have any.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1356] Yes.
                           [1357] You used to see my ... my father's eyes
                           sparkle when he had his first pint of the day!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1358] Ha!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1359] Mm?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1360] What?

Arthur (PS03S)             [1823] Just read it out.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1824] No!
Arthur (PS03S)             [1825] I will.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [1826] I can't read that little bit.
Arthur (PS03S)             [1827] [reading] One of the last jobs of Leicester
                           [...] serviceman Taffy ... he retires shortly ...
                           has involved working on a machine of the type he
                           first handled fifty years ago when he joined the B
                           U.
                           [1828] The machine, an original Boston Tacker from
                           the early nineteen hundreds was prepared by Taffy
                           for showing at the exhibition this month at
                           Wellingborough branch.
                           [1829] The organizers of the exhibition wanted a
                           Boston Tacker to stand in the foyer to tie in with
                           the theme of the seventy fifth anniversary of the B
                           U ... locating ... however, locating the complete
                           model has proved something of a headache like the
                           Model T Ford, the Boston Tacker was always very
                           common but is now something of a rarity ... and the
                           branch had finally settled for head to be borrowed
                           from C and J Clarke, shoe machi , museum in Street,
                           Somerset.
                           [1830] Luckily, Taffy returning from his annual
                           holiday remembered that there was a complete Tacker
                           in the factory of a local manufacturer ... still
                           being operated.
                           [1831] The directors of the firm kindly gave B U
                           permission to borrow a Tacker for the exhibition and
                           after Le Leicester branch arranged a temporary
                           replacement, Taffy began working, cleaning up the
                           machine to showroom condition.
                           [1832] Taffy spent five days cleaning, polishing,
                           painting ... he copied the motives which were
                           missing from and old nineteen hundred and eight B U
                           machinery catalogue ... which he examined with a
                           watchmaker's glass.
                           [1833] Taffy spent the ... majority of his time at B
                           U ... as a serviceman at Risden and Leicester
                           branches, but had an eighteen month period during
                           world war two assembling jet engines at Powerjets,

Arthur (PS03S)             [2183] Well no y she couldn't put the B side in cos
                           she s you've got to put the A in.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2184] Yes.

Arthur (PS03S)             [2186] The only way you can get it
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2187] A
Arthur (PS03S)             [2188] right would be putting the B side in but
                           you've gotta start with A.
                           [2189] ... It's rather curious that.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2190] Well you, you always do on yours when you're
                           recording on our er set don't you?

Evelyn (PS03T)             [2194] Leave alone and I'll sort them out.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2195] Well [...] that's what I'm saying.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2196] Well [...] ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [2197] Ah, there, that's it.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2198] That's it.
                           [2199] Now do you want any cake with that second cup
                           of tea?
Arthur (PS03S)             [2200] Yes I'll have a slice.

                           you?

                           got to go in the kitchen and get it.
Arthur (PS03S)             [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2207] No!
                           [2208] It won't matter for a minute or two.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2209] [singing] On my daughter's wedding day ten
                           thousand pounds I'll give away.
                           [2210] On second thoughts I think it best to put it
                           back in the old oak chest [] . ...
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2211] [shouting] How big [] ?
Arthur (PS03S)             [2212] Normal.

                           sing jazz, some sing like sawing wood, I sing like
                           that.
                           [2214] But when the dickie birds sing in the trees I
                           think we ought to try and sing like these.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2215] Well what's all that in aid of?
Arthur (PS03S)             [2216] Let's all sing like the birds can sing
                           [laugh]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2217] You needn't sing on it.
                           [2218] Shut up!

                           better?
                           [2224] This is Madge's cake.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2225] Ooh I think I like yours the best, this is a
                           bit heavy.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2226] It's not heavy! ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [2227] It looks like rain or snow. ...
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2228] I think it's too cold to snow.
                           [2229] ... That mark's gone off my arm, I think that
                           erm ... bandage was too tight.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2230] Well you'd better leave it off then for now.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2231] Well I don't know, it's
Arthur (PS03S)             [2232] Well if it's better for you I should.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2233] I don't know that it is.
                           [2234] ... It gave me a bit of support but
Arthur (PS03S)             [2235] Not much, I wouldn't have thought much, it's
                           elastic.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2236] I know but ... I should have thought by now
                           it 'd 've been ... better. ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [2237] Look in the doctors' book, it might tell you
                           how long ... you have to suffer.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2238] Well I think as you get older you take longer
                           to heal.
                           [2239] ... If it's, if there's not any frost we
                           could go to Sainsburys in the morning.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2240] Mm. ...
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2241] And do some shopping.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2242] A bit of shopping, yeah.
                           [2243] ... Unless we go on the bus.

                           the bus.

                           ... about every hour. ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [2246] Do they go on a Sunday still?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2247] Not very often.
                           [2248] ... Well I'm alright for everything till
                           about Tuesday.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2249] Mm.
                           [2250] ... How, you know the last time you saw the
                           doctor, how long did he say you'd got before it
                           completely
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2251] He didn't say.
                           [2252] ... [...] ... Mm eat all that cake, you're
                           not giving that to the birds.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2253] Mm [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2254] They've not ate, ate half the potatoes and
                           bread that's there now.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2255] You're not supposed to speak with your mouth
                           full.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2256] Hmm.
                           [2257] There goes the marzipan, all on the floor.

                           birds for?
                           [2260] I told you not to.
Arthur (PS03S)             [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2261] What are you giving that to the birds for?
                           [...] ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [2262] Is this your handkerchief on the floor?
                           [2263] ... Is this your handkerchief on the floor
                           here?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2264] I think so, that's mine.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2265] Mm. ...
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2266] Now finish that cake.

                           [2273] Everything you say now records on there.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [laugh]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2274] What I'm saying now is, is on there, all what
                           I'm saying.

                           different to y her voice.

                           weekend or it's I can't get the time off
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2478] Yeah there'd be a lot there then.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2479] but you know I'd like to go, you know, say a
                           couple of days. [...]

Evelyn (PS03T)             [2482] Yeah.
Tom (PS03U)                [2483] It's, it was, it was er er sheer coincidence
                           that Beverley had been to Crete the year before and
                           I said to Jackie we've been to Yugoslavia four
                           years, do you want, do you want a change or do you
                           wanna go back to Yugoslavia, she said well I'll,
                           I'll have a look, I said how about, how about going
                           to the Greek islands for a change
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2484] Yeah.
Tom (PS03U)                [2485] she said alright, and we changed and
                           Yugoslavia came out like that.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2486] Yes and you 'd 've had to have cancelled
                           anyway wouldn't you?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2487] One of our friends that we'd met were there,
                           they'd been there a couple of weeks
Tom (PS03U)                [2488] And they had to come back.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2489] a week before the July fortnight and they had
                           to come back.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2490] I always wanted to go but when Tito died I

                           coming right over what we call the roundabout so I
                           decided to have a go at it.
                           [2536] Well ... I got some foot long ... pruners but
                           the branches were hitting our thing and I were doing

Jackie (PS03V)             [2540] Yeah.
Tom (PS03U)                [2541] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2542] And that, getting back to Bush, he's doing
                           the same thing isn't it?

                           footballing [...]

Arthur (PS03S)             [2550] [...] Tom [...] .
                           [2551] It's a bit odd isn't it, to say the least.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2552] [...] because it's her er daughter's ...
                           birthday and I usually give a present to take round

                           asked him, you know, how come they took it?
                           [2556] What was the reason for it.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2557] Is that the one that was poorly over
                           Christmas?
Arthur (PS03S)             [2558] Yeah.
Tom (PS03U)                [2559] Because it's not very high up.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2560] No that was [...] young sister.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2561] No it can't be can it?
                           [2562] No, no.
Tom (PS03U)                [2563] It's not very high up at all.
                           [2564] Unless he's got a er

                           mean you know [] so he wouldn't be able
Evelyn (PS03T)             [...]
Tom (PS03U)                [2568] Well planes are always coming over cos
                           there's an airport just over there, that's right,
                           [...] airport.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2569] It's the aerodrome [...] yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2570] Yes but why did he say why's my grass greener
                           than everybody else's?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2571] Yeah well that was just a comment, silly.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2572] Ah I don't know.
Tom (PS03U)                [2573] I don't think they could say anything, as I
                           say there was no hosepipe ban then anyway so [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2574] You say just a comment comment, what about
                           that letter we had [...] ?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2575] Yeah well [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2576] It seems to be a pain in the neck me cleaning
                           the ... sometimes there's a lot of dog dirt, on
                           yours as well as mine, and I, I [...] and they were
                           quite er happy to do that, yet it seems to irritate
                           somebody over there.
                           [2577] ... Still.

                           [2637] And now he's, they've got one and I think it
                           was about five hundred pounds, they bought this one
                           s but they managed to sell the other one for about a
                           hundred and fifty they say.
Tom (PS03U)                [2638] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2639] Now he's got that, he says he wants a
                           wordprocessor.
Tom (PS03U)                [2640] Mm.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2641] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2642] And they're expensive aren't they?
Tom (PS03U)                [2643] Er yes they are.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2644] Ooh he, he's m mind you he, he reckons that's
                           what he wants to do when he's older but ... I mean
                           the life, or the career of anybody in computers is
                           not very long is it?
                           [2645] Because they're changing so rapidly.
Tom (PS03U)                [2646] Yes, yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2647] I mean my, one of my friend's ... sons, he
                           was a computer man, he was working on his own but
                           he's in his ... I should think he's getting on for
                           about forty six ... and he was doing freelance but
                           this recession ... the people who er the firms who
                           were employing him are using their own staff ... and
                           they're not calling on him now and er ... he's not
                           done any computing for twelve months.
Tom (PS03U)                [2648] Mm mm.
                           [2649] The building n next to us, where we are, you

                           [2655] And that was all, that was all computers, all
                           computers.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2656] Yes we kept going there when [...] yeah.

                           going to do the work for all the region, so
                           therefore they've gotta go
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2660] They're, yeah.
Tom (PS03U)                [2661] So all those computer people are out

                           gonna keep so
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2672] Oh

                           know, it's quite worrying really but er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2674] Oh it is really isn't it?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2675] Well you see he thought the Gas Board was
                           here forever you know?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2676] Well you do don't you?
                           [2677] But
Tom (PS03U)                [2678] Well since they've gone private
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2679] And especially these computers where they
                           change every ...
Tom (PS03U)                [2680] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2681] every few years don't they?
Tom (PS03U)                [2682] It's, it's er
Arthur (PS03S)             [2683] [...] they employed
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2684] Yes [laugh]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2685] they employed six thousand people and when
                           the [...] came they all went to Law Street adjacent
                           to the factory so they could walk across to the job
                           and er look at it now, they've smashed it all down,
                           it's gonna be an Asian big store.
                           [2686] It's all been levelled now and taken away and
                           they employed
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2687] No they're not, it's supposed to be being
                           used [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2688] six thousand people.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2689] I don't know whether you go down Valmer Road
                           do you?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2690] Not very often no.
Tom (PS03U)                [2691] I went, I went there about two years ago to
                           Walkers Crisps and, that's just next door to er
                           [...] .
                           [2692] I went by but yeah a lot of it's all down,
                           there's still, still a part being kept though isn't
                           there?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2693] Mm.
                           [2694] Oh they've still got a small part there.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2695] Ah that's, that's the American section.
Tom (PS03U)                [2696] That's right.
                           [2697] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2698] American United.
Tom (PS03U)                [2699] That's the [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2700] We w we was ... partnerships you see well ...
                           when our place collapsed they carried on ... just
                           carried on a bit because they were connected with
                           Japan.
                           [2701] In fact er just before I retired they were
                           saying, you know, my job's obsolete and that, and
                           then [...] and says oh we're opening up a big depot
                           in Japan.
                           [2702] So you see it's gone there you see.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2703] So you [laughing] just retired in [] retired
                           just about the right ... time.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2704] Mm. ...
Tom (PS03U)                [2705] [...] you know, it's gonna be difficult to
                           get another job now, so
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2706] You're in the drawing office?
Tom (PS03U)                [2707] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2708] Cos I've been silly in the past, I've told
                           Evelyn lots of times and ... we had a new machine, a
                           rapid na nailer, it er ... nailed er army sho er
                           soles onto the [...] at five hun it used to do three
                           hundred and fifty nails a minute and we m made one
                           just for ... I er went out on the road, er to five
                           hundred a minute you see, and er we were building
                           the first half a dozen and er ... er there's two
                           pawls at the back of the machine
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2709] Ooh we don't want to know.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2710] Ah but th th th there's a rack and w one goes
                           on and holds the horn post up to the boot while it's
                           driven, then it comes out ... and there's two, one's
                           half a tooth, so it ensures one or the other's in,
                           and they work like that.
                           [2711] So I was spinning the cam round, it hadn't
                           got pinned to the shaft, just spinning it round on
                           the shaft and these pawls were doing this ... and
                           Les , the top one, he went to Kettering and then
                           Don, the next top one, he went to er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2712] We don't want to know all this.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2713] r er Northampton and then finally I went to
                           Rushden, and er this top one,, and his mate come out
                           of the toilet, been for a smoke, and er walking by I
                           said hey Les, look at this, and I spun the cam round
                           and it went bang and stopped dead.
                           [2714] He said well you've got no bloody springs on
                           the pawls, I says ... so I picked a tin of springs
                           up, we kept it for anybody who wanted a spring for
                           their bike, any spring where, you know the hooks on
                           each end?
Tom (PS03U)                [2715] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2716] Well they broke off in wear and when you was
                           overhauling a machine you'd throw these springs in
                           the tin in case you ever wanted one.
                           [2717] And he said er ... oh he says er er there's
                           no, your spring's broke.
                           [2718] I s so I showed him this tin full, I says
                           well look they do break don't they?
                           [2719] Anyway, do you know the easiest, er and at
                           that time five pound were five pound, if I 'd 've
                           gone to the foreman and then the er [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2720] Drawing office.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2721] drawing office, I 'd 've got five pound on a
                           suggestion.
                           [2722] Anyway in the fullness of time er went to er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2723] You said that.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2724] near Kettering, Don went to er Northampton
                           and then finally I went to Rushden ... and er I'd
                           been there about a year and all of a sudden there
                           was a call in for Shorteners at [...] so I went down
                           on the bike and er ... what er the one over me who,
                           who was elderly, well wasn't over me but he was er
                           ... he was on my job but the senior man on it ... he
                           come in, the boss had sent him in to have a look cos
                           the er Shorteners were complaining, and er then they
                           rang up for one of us, he said well I'm not leaving
                           till I've solved this problem so I had to go.
                           [2725] But er ... all he did was, you know the two
                           pawls that go in and out?
                           [2726] He made a bit of eight inch wire, like er a U
                           piece, and the bar at, bottom bar of the U held the
                           tail so if the springs broke the tails didn't duck
                           under and smash the cam.
                           [2727] It'd smashed the cam and, and the lever and
                           bent the shaft ... colossal expense at that time.
Tom (PS03U)                [2728] Mm expensive [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2729] Now him and his mate says ooh ... er you,
                           your spring's broke.
                           [2730] Now I were bloody daft, If I 'd 've gone to
                           the foreman and wanted to put a suggestion in, I, I,
                           I 'd 've beat ... sure they were crowing abou when
                           he got [...] ... but I was first really wasn't I?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2731] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2732] I, I'd seen it before it happened
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2733] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2734] you see, and three more went like that
                           eventually but er he got the dough and that was it.
Tom (PS03U)                [2735] That was it, mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2736] And Evelyn always says I'm too diffident to
                           push my plate up and
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2737] Well, he used to come home and say that and
                           I'd say put a suggestion in but
Tom (PS03U)                [2738] Mm.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2739] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2740] if he did I [laughing] had to write to out
                           for him [] .
Jackie (PS03V)             [2741] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2742] Still we didn't do too badly.
                           [2743] Anyway how long have you got to go before you
                           retire?
Tom (PS03U)                [2744] Ooh eleven years officially.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2745] Ooh.
Tom (PS03U)                [2746] [...] if it was up to me I'm

                           not going on to sixty five
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2750] Not staying longer.
Tom (PS03U)                [2751] and it might end up [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2752] No, no.
Tom (PS03U)                [2753] There's certain rumours that there's no [...]

Evelyn (PS03T)             [2754] Still you might get a a big redundancy ...
                           pay out if you do.
Tom (PS03U)                [2755] Well ... talking about a year's salary [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2756] Is that [...]
Tom (PS03U)                [2757] You get a pension of course but it depends
                           how many years
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2758] Yes you get a pension.
Tom (PS03U)                [2759] you've been there and I've only been there
                           thirteen years so
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2760] Oh.
Tom (PS03U)                [2761] that's not
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2762] Not as good.
Tom (PS03U)                [2763] they said about a quarter of my salary didn't
                           they?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2764] Mind you how many years were you in your
                           pension?
                           [2765] Not all that many.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2766] From the beginning weren't it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2767] No you weren't
Arthur (PS03S)             [2768] No?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2769] the B U didn't have a pension scheme till
                           after the war.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2770] No, no.
                           [2771] ... But talking about pensions i
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2772] Do you get a pension in yours?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2773] Only my own what I put in, no.

                           seventy four.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2775] Yes, it's a good idea isn't it?
Tom (PS03U)                [2776] Yeah.
                           [2777] The sad thing is [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2778] Well my friend never paid
Arthur (PS03S)             [2779] Tal talking about pensions Tom, the chap er
                           cha [...] with the office girls and that and, and
                           checking our expense sheets, he, he er they put a

                           into it ... and I were looking at notice and he says
                           ooh he says it's no good for you, he says er ... w
                           well I told you about it didn't I?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2780] Yes.
                           [2781] And I said ooh
Arthur (PS03S)             [2782] He said ooh he says you won't get no more if
                           you retire.
                           [2783] So I mentioned it to Evelyn and, being an
                           office-wallah, you know, and any, any e extra money

                           been
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2784] Which was a lot in those days.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2785] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2786] Well you had a rise as well.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2787] we've been glad we've been glad now haven't
                           we er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2788] So he anted his up.

Arthur (PS03S)             [2792] Yes but we're glad [laughing] now [] .
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2793] Oh yes because now ... mind you the B U
                           pension's quite good because every year we, we get a
                           p a percentage increase
Tom (PS03U)                [2794] Mm.
                           [2795] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2796] but I mean ours doesn't, mine doesn't, I mean
                           mine's only a small one because I haven't done many
                           years there.
Tom (PS03U)                [2797] Ours goes [...] cost of living it says.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2798] But er, oh that's alright if it does but the
                           B U is, is, you know, a really good one.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2799] Mm.
Tom (PS03U)                [2800] But you've got to get some years in to get a
                           really good pension, but I've got thirteen and ...
                           the maximum you can get is forty years but you get,
                           then get two thirds of the salary you would have
                           got,
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2801] Mm.
Tom (PS03U)                [2802] your own salary, so that's pretty good for a
                           pension isn't it?
                           [2803] You know.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2804] Still perhaps you get the earnings ... thing
                           don't you?
                           [2805] Earnings related as well sort of thing.
Tom (PS03U)                [2806] That's being stopped though [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2807] Has it?
Tom (PS03U)                [2808] It's gonna be in the year two thousand
                           they're gonna wipe it out.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2809] Oh, oh [laugh]
Tom (PS03U)                [2810] So that's it.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2811] Oh dear I'm not [...] au fait with those
                           things now.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2812] No well this is why w you know like my girls
                           have got just to take their own [...] now.
Tom (PS03U)                [2813] Take their own private ones see, [...]
Jackie (PS03V)             [2814] Yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2815] Yeah my nieces are doing that, Audrey and er
                           well her husband's self employed so er
Tom (PS03U)                [2816] See all the firms I've been to up till the
                           Gas Board just gave you your money back for your
                           pension.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2817] Yes they did.
Tom (PS03U)                [2818] If they could have said to you would you keep
                           it and, or transfer it t I would've said yes please.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2819] Well they can do now, in those days they
                           didn't.
Tom (PS03U)                [2820] But they, they could but they they didn't in
                           my day, they just
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2821] No.
Tom (PS03U)                [2822] gave it to you back and you got no choice in
                           the matter, that was it.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2823] No they didn't, no, we didn't in our place.
Tom (PS03U)                [2824] So that was a shame really as far as I'm
                           concerned.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2825] Do you reckon the er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2826] Mm.
                           [2827] Although Peter my friend's ... he, he did
                           that but er it didn't come to much, they 'd 've
                           saved it or something, one job, cos he was made
                           redundant about three times [...] and er ... one,
                           one place he was at ... they're supposed to have
                           kept it and paying him it now but I don't know how
                           they came about that bu because actually they we
                           played him a dirty trick, they persuaded him to
                           leave his job ... and then about nine years or
                           probably less than that later ... you know and he
                           was out again, redundant ... and, you know, I think
                           they felt a bit guilty but he only gets about five
                           pounds a week from, off that one, which is [...]
Jackie (PS03V)             [2828] Nothing is it?
                           [2829] No.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2830] Er er do you reckon we ought to have had, you
                           kn you know we went over to gas, I toyed with the
                           idea of fetching that [...] ... do you know, you
                           know when this house were built we went looking at a
                           depot where they've got all these grates and I took
                           th funnily enough I took the measurements of the
                           breast ... [laughing] and er [] the only one we
                           found was just that ... dead on look, right across
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2831] Is that recorder still on?
Tom (PS03U)                [2832] Oh yeah [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2833] Oh ye yes, yes it's still going.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2834] Oh that's alright, finish one tape.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2835] Tape and

Arthur (PS03S)             [2837] well we shan't finish that lot shall
                           [laughing] we at this rate [] ?
Unknown speaker (KBBPSUNK) [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2838] Well if you, if you finish three we're
                           [laugh]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2839] You can't very well go in a pub [laughing]
                           can you [] ?
Tom (PS03U)                [2840] No not really.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2841] You've not seen Jackie's new lounge
Arthur (PS03S)             [2842] I er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2843] have you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [2844] No.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2845] It's beautiful int it?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2846] Well it will be when it's finished, the
                           curtains are
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2847] Have you finished?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2848] Well they came and fetched the curtains on
                           Thursday, they've got to go back.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2849] Why, what's the matter with those?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2850] Not level, the dining room one was two inches
                           shorter one side than the other, the tie-backs
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2851] Really?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2852] were all creased, and the lounge
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2853] Ooh [...]
Jackie (PS03V)             [2854] is like this!
                           [2855] They weren't level at all.
                           [2856] They came back
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2857] Ooh!
Jackie (PS03V)             [2858] back and they were disgusted so they've taken
                           them down and gonna make me a complete new set.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2859] Oh, oh I didn't know that, mm.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2860] Yeah.
                           [2861] And he suggested tie-back is, cos it's, the
                           pink is the thinner material, they're gonna pipe it
                           instead of what they've tried.
                           [2862] Oh the machining was dreadful.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2863] Mm.
                           [2864] Who, who was who was the

Evelyn (PS03T)             [2866] Ooh!
Jackie (PS03V)             [2867] workshop
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2868] Oh I see, Maples.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2869] But
Jackie (PS03V)             [2870] Cos they should be good there shouldn't they?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2871] Well this is it, the man was disgusted, he
                           said oh dear.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2872] Yeah.
Tom (PS03U)                [2873] They are very good though, they come when
                           they say and they, they d they do something about it

Jackie (PS03V)             [2874] Oh they've been very good, oh yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2875] Mm.
                           [2876] Yes.
Tom (PS03U)                [2877] they don't just leave it, they'll go and do
                           it, you know?
                           [2878] They've very good [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2879] Mm.
                           [2880] Cos we had Linekars, course they've gone out
                           of business, but when he came, when the boss came to
                           this one ... he reckoned one of these was ... a bit
                           out didn't he?
Arthur (PS03S)             [2881] Mm.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2882] But this, I mean they measured, in fact he
                           even measured the track to see the, make sure the
                           track wasn't level, you know, and
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2883] Yes.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2884] Cos the windowsill is about an eighth of an
                           inch out, well in one place
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2885] Mm.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2886] but he still, the curtain was supposed to be
                           something like sixty one and a half inches ... one
                           was about a sixty one and the other was about a
                           sixty three one end, you know? [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2887] Tt oh that's sad.
                           [2888] Oh what a shame.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2889] As he said it was Christmas rush I think, you
                           know?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2890] Yeah oh of course it was just before
                           Christmas.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2891] But er you know they've just not done the

Evelyn (PS03T)             [2894] Cos I've not seen it with the curtains [...]

Arthur (PS03S)             [2899] Go on.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [2901] You pour it out Arthur, I can't get that cork
                           off very easily.

                           [2910] I thought Tom might have a whisky if he's got
                           a [...]

Evelyn (PS03T)             [2920] Yes it was a Sierra

Arthur (PS03S)             [2927] Well there's been no end, there's been no end
                           to it.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2928] Well except for third party, how long

Tom (PS03U)                [2949] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2950] you know?
Jackie (PS03V)             [2951] [...] during the day cos our cars are not
                           there.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2952] No well that's what I said i er ... and
                           probably perhaps when you were on holiday.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2953] The road intrigues me Tom
Jackie (PS03V)             [2954] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2955] how clean it looks and the, you know the
                           marks, those black marks, they're the joints of the
                           concrete where they
Tom (PS03U)                [2956] That's right, [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2957] You know they kept [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2958] It looks very clean doesn't it?
Tom (PS03U)                [2959] Can you see the paving stones?
                           [2960] They're white [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2961] Yeah, mm, that's what, yeah.
Tom (PS03U)                [2962] I've never noticed those before.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2963] Mm.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2964] Well that's the new bit they did, you know,
                           the little
Tom (PS03U)                [2965] Do you know y y you, it's a different aspect,
                           you go out here and all you see everything at ground
                           level and you can't really see on top of everything
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2966] Yes, mm,s see low, no.
Tom (PS03U)                [2967] But on there see you can see all the details
                           can't you, [...] at all.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2968] Mm.
Jackie (PS03V)             [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2969] But I was struck, I was struck by the frame.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2970] I think that frame's worth it these days, I
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2971] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2972] I, [...] but ... I reckon you've got a bit of
                           money in the fra in the frame.
                           [2973] Cos I was
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2974] Oh that lady who came with this, she said er
                           ... Arthur happened to say he'd just bought it, and
                           she said how much did they charge you, twenty five
                           pounds or thirty pounds?
Tom (PS03U)                [2975] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2976] So I said no, only twenty.
                           [2977] So apparently ... she said ooh he probably
                           charges, perhaps if he's not very [laughing] he
                           reduces the price [] but ... funny she said twenty
                           five pounds.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2978] She seemed to know about it.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2979] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2980] And it's funny they came together and she,
                           she pushed
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2981] She knew, not quite together.
Arthur (PS03S)             [2982] in while I were [laughing] with the other
                           chap [] .
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2983] No it was a minute afterwards because I
                           thought
Arthur (PS03S)             [2984] Well
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2985] oh he's come back ... for the, this, to show
                           to you.
Jackie (PS03V)             [2986] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2987] I thought perhaps he'd been to you and ...
                           sort of were you interested and he he'd come back.
                           [2988] But it was only a second
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2989] No. [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2990] after er sort of I'd more or less half a
                           second [...] and I thought oh he's come back again
                           [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [2991] But, but I had more to do with her than
                           Evelyn but er from what little bits I've gleaned,
                           you know, er I'm a bit into everything like, and I
                           seem to think, I've got a f strange feeling that
                           she's something to do with education and they're
                           worried about children not speaking properly eventu
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2992] No!
Arthur (PS03S)             [2993] Le let me finish.
                           [2994] Er eventually they won't speak real English,
                           with all this Asian kids in ... now al all the Asian
                           children have gotta go in any school haven't they
                           and th everything, well sooner or later er this
                           mixture of languages is gonna spoil the English
                           language isn't it?
                           [2995] Bound to.
Tom (PS03U)                [2996] Yes it's bound to.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [2997] No what the they'll do, they'll put all the
                           words that are used into a computer er from all
                           these things won't they?
                           [2998] And then they'll see how many ... are sort of
                           used a lot and ... percentage and that's what
                           they'll do.
Tom (PS03U)                [2999] Mm.
                           [3000] But as Arthur says though perhaps some of the
                           Asian words will start being used by the English
                           people.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3001] Oh, oh yes yes.
                           [3002] Well it says on the, on the thing we have to
                           fill in ... er ... if any of the speakers is of non
Arthur (PS03S)             [3003] Non ra er non English, yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3004] English or something a different race if you
                           like, you're to [laughing] put it down [] .
                           [3005] Because you only have to identify them by a
                           name not ... not a
Arthur (PS03S)             [3006] Do you look at er C Cilla?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3007] not, not the surname, just J John or whoever

Jackie (PS03V)             [3009] Mm
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3010] and, but if any of them are of ... not U K
                           origin
Tom (PS03U)                [3011] Yes.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3012] you've got to put it down and say which one
                           it is.
Arthur (PS03S)             [3013] Do you ever look at this Cilla er Blind Date?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3014] Oh did you see that tonight?
Tom (PS03U)                [3015] Yes [...]

                           blackie with that lovely ... lovely young girl,
                           pretty as a picture, and he were doing this round
                           her and leaning back, and his great big lips ... ooh
                           ooh!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3017] [laughing] Oh I hate it when [] [...] white

                           daughter Jackie what would you have thought?
Jackie (PS03V)             [3019] I know, well I ha didn't see it last week but

Jackie (PS03V)             [3021] she liked coloured people or something
Tom (PS03U)                [3022] Something like that, yeah.
Jackie (PS03V)             [3023] when they were talking to her.
                           [3024] I was, where was I?
                           [3025] I don't know [...]

                           something else on?
Jackie (PS03V)             [3027] But Tom said she was saying something about,
                           you know, she liked coloured men or [...]
Tom (PS03U)                [3028] Well she liked one of the coloured film
                           stars, I don't know which one it was though [...]

                           doesn't go very well.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [3048] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [3049] Well he'd got a seven year old girl copying

Arthur (PS03S)             [3108] I, I look at these science things where, you

               pigeons will be conspicuous by their absence.
Evelyn (PS03T) [3111] Well perhaps it'll be a good thing in some ways, we're
               getting too many.
               [3112] You'll have no seed left before you're able to get to the
               shops to buy more.
Arthur (PS03S) [3113] You know what Glen said on the moon.
Evelyn (PS03T) [3114] Oh well.
Arthur (PS03S) [3115] They asked him ... what he missed the most, he said the
               birds.
Evelyn (PS03T) [3116] Well we're not likely to miss those are we?
               [3117] We get too many. ...
Arthur (PS03S) [3118] Well you'll miss them if they go away.
Evelyn (PS03T) [3119] I shouldn't miss the pigeons all that much, I don't mind
               the blackbird and the thrush and the robin but ... and a few
               starlings but I don't like ... many pigeons about the garden.
               [3120] They're too dirty.
Arthur (PS03S) [3121] They're not.
Evelyn (PS03T) [3122] Yes they are.

Evelyn (PS03T) [3130] Not in this fog.

               box.

               be cold.

Arthur (PS03S) [3141] Quite cold is the phrase. ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [3142] What did you say?
Arthur (PS03S) [3143] I said quite cold is the phrase, not ever so cold.
Evelyn (PS03T) [3144] Is it?
               [3145] Oh I stand corrected.
Arthur (PS03S) [3146] You'll have to go back to the nursery.
Evelyn (PS03T) [3147] You, you'd like to go back to school.

                           first went ... I wouldn't have ordered it.
                           [4131] That's where they fobbed us.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4132] Now drink this coffee!
Arthur (PS03S)             [4133] And we, I think we did take some with us

                           could I do about it?
                           [4142] Couldn't say, ooh I'm not having it now could
                           you?

Arthur (PS03S)             [4146] It was another shop I went to.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4147] Where you bought your canvas?
                           [4148] Didn't you buy a sheet there?
                           [4149] You said would cut into two, where's that?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4150] No I didn't.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4151] You did!
                           [4152] We saw that card, when, when I bought you
                           that canvas
Arthur (PS03S)             [4153] But that's, that's all the ... all what we
                           got is in there.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4154] Yeah, well you look in there!

                           [4159] ... I definitely remember buying some.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4160] This, this is er, inch and half too short or

                           place.

Arthur (PS03S)             [4190] Yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4191] I think it came out a bit more expensive that
                           order, still if it's what you want you've got to
                           have it haven't you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4192] Well jus er you see ... already cut it,

                           had it cut.

Arthur (PS03S)             [4196] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4197] Perhaps you didn't buy one, perhaps we just
                           looked at it.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4198] Just looked at it, cos we got that this time.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [4565] Don't know whether the others have died, but
                           they a there only seems to be one.

Arthur (PS03S)             [4600] Yes, but we've had several frosty weeks ain't
                           we?

                           sill, I take them off at night.
                           [4602] Should be alright.
                           [4603] Well they are alright.
                           [4604] But, the old ones that Tom gave me originally
                           ... they've not flowered now for about ... three
                           months ... yet they're not dead.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4605] I've been figuring out S, A and B,wha why ...
                           you ha , you have to start, you know, then I realise
                           it's ... but you gotta put it in the way it's ready
                           to er ... record haven't
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4606] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4607] you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4608] Is it opposite to the one we've got
Arthur (PS03S)             [4609] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4610] there?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4611] It's not, it's not on the
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4612] Oh well that's what I said, it was no use,
                           bothering
Arthur (PS03S)             [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4613] there's no use bothering to ... how ours
                           worked ... you've got to sort of know how this one
                           works.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4614] Well it's nothing to do with the working
                           really,ma , it's the fact that they ... with A
                           facing you ... the spool is ready to run.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4615] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4616] And then, put it the other way i if there
                           were nothing that side you'd have to put it on B
                           because that's ready to run.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4617] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4618] It depends on which side you start you see.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4619] Well they say always start on A don't they?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4620] Oh!
                           [4621] Well I mean it's nothing to do with the
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4622] I mean you are now [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [4623] mechanism of it, so
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4624] No.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4625] the fact whether, one side is full, the spool
                           you're going to wind on is right for recording.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4626] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4627] Ah, and like
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4628] Well we always do ours on A for a start don't
                           we?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4629] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4630] You do don't you?
                           [4631] I don't know, I never do ours.
                           [4632] ... Anyway, are you very hungry?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4633] Mm.
                           [4634] Not hungry at all really, I
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4635] Well you should be!
Arthur (PS03S)             [4636] such a big breakfast.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4637] You didn't have a big breakfast today!
                           [4638] You only had a boiled egg and ... flakes.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4639] Well, you know what my landlady said ... if
                           you want something substantial I'll boil you and
                           egg.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4640] [laughing] Oh well [] !
                           [4641] This was about forty years ago!

                           ... in the town.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4643] Times were hard then.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4644] Yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4645] And pe , people did take in lodgers didn't
                           they?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4646] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4647] To make ends meet.
                           [4648] Keeps everybody [...] together.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4649] That's, that's that's what Kath thought.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4650] No!
Arthur (PS03S)             [4651] We were having to make ends meet.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4652] What have you got to worry about?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4653] Well I'm saying what Kath's
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4654] Yeah.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4655] worrying about, not what I'm worrying about!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4656] Kath's not worrying about us, she knows we've
                           got plenty.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4657] Well
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4658] Or efficient.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4659] Why did she say that?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4660] It was a joke!
Arthur (PS03S)             [4661] Oh.

Arthur (PS03S)             [4665] Yes, but Kath's jokes have a sharp cutting
                           edge
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4666] No they haven't
Arthur (PS03S)             [4667] to them.

                           [4681] Course he were right weren't he!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4682] Why?
                           [4683] How had he got two jobs?
Arthur (PS03S)             [4684] Well they wanted to know why ... as he was
                           just running a cafe, a cute; why he was selling
                           jams.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [4685] Oh I see.
Arthur (PS03S)             [4686] Of course, where did he get the jam from?

Evelyn (PS03T)             [4712] I know that!

                           [5106] Unless you ask.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5107] Well, it's only polite to say whether ... if
                           you

                           [5112] Well probably not, with not, having the flu.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5113] Well I'd tell you [...] .
                           [5114] Did she have the flu then?
                           [5115] Mm?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5116] Well, she wasn't well, I don't know whether
                           it was flu or
Arthur (PS03S)             [5117] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5118] Don't you remember she spent Boxing Day in
                           bed!
Arthur (PS03S)             [5119] Oh yeah!

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5121] And the children didn't come so
Arthur (PS03S)             [5122] Madge did.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5126] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5127] Dashing about.

                           constant, neither better nor worse?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5129] Well, I think some days she's better than ...
                           others, but ... on the whole she's not making much
                           progress.
                           [5130] I don't think she will.
                           [5131] ... I mean
Arthur (PS03S)             [5132] But
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5133] it's always been
Arthur (PS03S)             [5134] in other words Peter's sort of ... stuck with
                           it isn't he?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5135] Landed!
                           [5136] I mean, she's always been ... that way ...
                           nervous and
Arthur (PS03S)             [5137] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5138] right from ... when she was first married.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5139] Well, I was always the nervous type.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5140] You're still neurotic in some things!
Arthur (PS03S)             [5141] Being a nervous type.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5142] Ooh!
                           [5143] I wouldn't say nervous type.
                           [5144] Just a bit
Arthur (PS03S)             [5145] What would you say?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5146] Neurotic ... over certain things.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5147] Why wouldn't you say I was a nervous type?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5148] Well, not normally.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5149] Er , what conclusion has it come from?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5150] Well, not in the same way Joan is.
                           [5151] ... But you get het up over ... silly things!
Arthur (PS03S)             [5152] What do I do with the big things?
                           [5153] Deal with them as they come up?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5154] [laughing] I don't know [] !
Arthur (PS03S)             [5155] Deal with it as it comes on.
                           [5156] ... How's Muriel then?
                           [5157] What's she
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5158] Well, she's just coping, just dragging her
                           arms int she?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5159] Can't see what she sees in her cousins though
                           can you?
                           [5160] All [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5161] Well they always did!
                           [5162] I mean, I can remember when she worked with
                           me, every Christmas ... they changed ... one time
                           they came to Leicester
Arthur (PS03S)             [5163] Mhm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5164] and the next year they went to Loughborough
                           ... with their cousins.
                           [5165] And so, I suppose, they're keeping it up now.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5166] I wouldn't know my cousins fir christian
                           names ... now!

                           she?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5177] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5178] Well then!
Arthur (PS03S)             [5179] The eldest.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5180] Oh!
Arthur (PS03S)             [5181] It's a rum do life int it?
                           [5182] You're born, you suffer, and you die!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5183] You suffer?
                           [5184] I don't, not notice you suffering much in
                           life!
                           [5185] ... It's a piece of cake for you!
                           [5186] Somebody to wait on you!
                           [5187] Hand and foot.
                           [5188] And by the way, you've got your old trousers
                           on did you know?

                           [5191] Oh!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5192] Yes you have!
                           [5193] ... Have you got rid of the cod liver oil
                           taste yet?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5194] Oh that goes immediately.
                           [5195] [...] with that.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5196] Ooh!
                           [5197] Don't know how you could drink it!
Arthur (PS03S)             [5198] It's yo , well if you hold your breath ...
                           you ... you sort of don't ... I found out you don't
                           ... get the fla ,yo fla , you can't taste it, you
                           sort of clench yourself and you don't taste.
                           [5199] That's quite easy to perform.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5200] Shall I get you another bottle?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5201] Might as well.
                           [5202] It might do something for me.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5203] Try the capsules.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5204] No.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5205] I can't take many.
                           [5206] I'll have some in the [...] then stop.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5207] Oh, I could take them.
                           [5208] We used to take handful at Powerjets but they
                           said
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5209] You used to repeat [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [5210] it used to be known as it was a ... war do ,
                           war factory but ... you cut them open it were nearly
                           all casing.
                           [5211] They were ... er little
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5212] Well I suppose it was concentrated.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5213] Yeah.
                           [5214] But ca ,pe , I drink it out the bottle and
                           that's the best.
                           [5215] Pour it in a glass and look at it, or a spoon
                           but ... pour it out the bottle, hold your breath and
                           Bob's your uncle!
                           [5216] It's gone down!
                           [5217] ... People talk about they can't take it,
                           that's poppycock!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5218] Well I couldn't.
                           [5219] Can't even take the capsules.
                           [5220] Th , they stick on me half way down.
                           [5221] ... Oh it's drying up.
                           [5222] I think it must be turning cold.
                           [5223] Do, you feel cold don't you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5224] I did do in the front, er, yes.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5225] Yeah , but you got the radiator on and the
                           gas fire!
                           [5226] Yo , well you've still the gas fire as well
                           in here!
                           [5227] ... Hadn't you better ... sit in your chair
                           for ten minutes before clear up the lunch.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5228] Well it's still winter isn't it? [...]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5229] Got worse if anything.
                           [5230] February's always the worst month. [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [5231] You reckon?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5232] Oh it is!
                           [5233] Everybody always says that.
                           [5234] Now sit in that chair
Arthur (PS03S)             [5235] Finish?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5236] No.
                           [5237] Leave it for a minute or two.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5238] I'm just taking them out into
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5239] Leave
Arthur (PS03S)             [5240] don't you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5241] No.
                           [5242] Leave the pots and ... everything.
                           [5243] Arthur I'm hot in here!
                           [5244] I'll wash these green mats.
                           [5245] These, the other green mats.
                           [5246] So, don't go looking for them because ...
                           they're in the wash.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5247] How do you feel after last night?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5248] What, the late night?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5249] Yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5250] I'm alright.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5251] I wonder what possessed you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5252] I've not had my bandage on today.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5253] I say, I wonder what possessed you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5254] Oh!
                           [5255] I know!
Arthur (PS03S)             [5256] That's a bug.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5257] It's
Arthur (PS03S)             [5258] I never went though did you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5259] No.
                           [5260] No, I was dreaming, I told you earlier I
Arthur (PS03S)             [5261] Oh!
                           [5262] Well it's what you want with your arm int it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5263] Course not.
                           [5264] It's still
Arthur (PS03S)             [5265] Rest and more rest.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5266] No!
                           [5267] I've got to use it they say.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5268] Oh!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5269] Or try to use it, but it's still
Arthur (PS03S)             [5270] You won't be able to
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5271] I still can't
Arthur (PS03S)             [5272] you won't be able to keep hurting it though,
                           eh?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5273] No.
                           [5274] I still can't carry ... anything heavy in it.
                           [5275] ... But still
Arthur (PS03S)             [5276] Will it be always like that then?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5277] Oh no!
                           [5278] It should go back.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5279] Does Marge ever say
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5280] No, she said she gets arthritis in hers ...
                           and I expect that's what it is with mine.
                           [5281] Cos I got a bit before when
Arthur (PS03S)             [5282] More like it's the aftermath of the break.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5283] It probably has [...] it.
                           [5284] It's the only thing I can say ... and I think

Arthur (PS03S)             [5285] Well it's the
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5286] I think
Arthur (PS03S)             [5287] the silliest
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5288] my thumb
Arthur (PS03S)             [5289] silliest thing to happen isn't it, really?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5290] Well it's happening every day!
                           [5291] ... I bet after on Friday
Arthur (PS03S)             [5292] Well I re , I noticed you the other ... er,

Arthur (PS03S)             [5497] well the one in there is
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5498] well they, they specialize in
Arthur (PS03S)             [5499] nick knacks
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5500] no, in certain things either
Arthur (PS03S)             [5501] well as far as that stoat didn't offer them
                           any thing because they, a chap about forty he
                           reached it

                           up there?, and he said ten shillings, I said a
                           little bit dear in't it?, cos ten shilling then was
                           ten shilling
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5503] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5504] and he says su its a good buy even for that
                           says, it, you know, its a hundred years old, oh well
                           he says it was continental, but er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5505] well it perhaps wasn't just what he was
                           looking for
Arthur (PS03S)             [5506] no ... well he knew what he were looking for,
                           something worth when you think

                           [5512] I think it was er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5513] I think it were a lot of money
Arthur (PS03S)             [5514] some painting of some homes in er a desert at
                           night, it had been missing for er nearly a century

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5517] so we'll have to see
Arthur (PS03S)             [5518] best of it is he hadn't taken it out of the
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5519] roll

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5521] well he put it in, probably didn't put it,
                           must of taken it out to of looked at it surely ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [5522] it'd look like that might of been looking in
                           the markets and that

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5537] no they didn't, they fetched seventy
Arthur (PS03S)             [5538] seventy was it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5539] remember you said that thirty five of that
                           would of been ours any way
Arthur (PS03S)             [5540] be, yeah yeah

Arthur (PS03S)             [5542] they, they also there a dangerously
                           expendable on that corner of

                           up, I put the packet there ready to open. ...

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5776] Co-Op the other week were horrible
Arthur (PS03S)             [5777] how many have you got, another day?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5778] I've got about enough for about two days,
                           might be three
Arthur (PS03S)             [5779] that's alright then
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5780] I should think the weather will change before
                           then
Arthur (PS03S)             [5781] mm, er, got a bit of revert back to the nice
                           ...
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5782] I've not heard the forecast today have you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5783] that's
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5784] no I doubt it, its
Arthur (PS03S)             [5785] well I've had, had a little of
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5786] oh I had to switch it off it was no good, it
                           was all political wasn't it?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5787] mm , give it time I mean its talk, talk,
                           Churchill said jaw, jaw, but you can have too much
                           jaw, jaw, can't ya?
                           [5788] ... Did you read that er a bit about him?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5789] the documentary that their going to put
Arthur (PS03S)             [5790] yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5791] which will, it'll be interesting you see,
                           listen
Arthur (PS03S)             [5792] says you won't like and then
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5793] well he was a bit of a slave driver I mean
                           every body
Arthur (PS03S)             [5794] yes, yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5795] knew that ... he was a bit bombastic
Arthur (PS03S)             [5796] mm and he didn't do so well in his college
                           days did he?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5797] ooh he wasn't very bright
Arthur (PS03S)             [5798] yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5799] or he didn't try, well he didn't have a very
                           happy childhood did he?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5800] no ... in those days
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5801] well you didn't try when you were at school,
                           you told me yourself
Arthur (PS03S)             [5802] no, I didn't bother ... and next to me
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5803] I mean a lot of it depends on, or perhaps his
                           par well if his parents didn't really bother about
                           him
Arthur (PS03S)             [5804] mm
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5805] he said his mother didn't and then I don't
                           suppose
Arthur (PS03S)             [5806] well my mother were out working and my dad
                           was non existent
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5807] and then I suppose er in those cases like
                           yours ... children don't er, unless their sort of
                           erm pushed a bit ... or the parents show an interest
                           in them
Arthur (PS03S)             [5808] oh you know the Meccano things?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5809] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5810] try to that there was a clip on it, but
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5811] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5812] he bought me one for me Christmas, he came
                           at,lo you know, loader with er, what's that in the
                           bar, loader with erm
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5813] I don't
Arthur (PS03S)             [5814] when Jesus were born?, any way, this thing
                           clicked on and er, it, I, showed me how to do it and
                           I ain't got the strength, of course the war was on
                           and there was er people were borrowing cups of sugar
                           and er, probably, any way I couldn't clip it, he
                           says oh he said to er mum, oh he says they clip on
                           easily, but I couldn't
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5815] well your finger isn't
Arthur (PS03S)             [5816] the next then we moved from Archlin Lane to
                           Founder Lane, where next Christmas I had Meccano
                           that could screw with screws
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5817] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5818] mm I told you about Bill wanting it
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5819] yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [5820] and then after Christmas dinner I built this
                           windmill and mother and I liked it and he said well
                           its only screwed together, I nearly said well you
                           wanted it any way, see, he wanted it and yet cos I
                           got it, it were, any body could have it
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5821] any body could do it you mean
Arthur (PS03S)             [5822] well that's the same thing in't it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5823] what time is it?, is it time to put that
                           radio on?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5824] what that, three, four minutes ... oh you can
                           put it on if you like
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5825] well just try it and I'll tell you what, I
                           don't know [...] him
Arthur (PS03S)             [5826] er, rather throw suspicion that
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5827] it won't be the same
Arthur (PS03S)             [5828] its the same thing
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5829] it won't be the same songs, radio two
Arthur (PS03S)             [5830] what, what I could do I shall put these on
                           and see what it at, starts and quickly put
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5831] no, its, its, Palm Court, we want to see
                           Those Were The Days at four thirty
Arthur (PS03S)             [5832] mm
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5833] just try this Palm Court see if its worth
                           recording
Arthur (PS03S)             [5834] well its
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5835] its not on until about two minutes past
Arthur (PS03S)             [5836] well I can get it ready now
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5837] two minutes past, because they have two
                           minutes of news I think
Arthur (PS03S)             [5838] they we are
*** 27 (Tape 049404) ***
Unknown speaker (KBBPSUNK) [5839] Those Were The Days was quite good this week
Arthur (PS03S)             [5840] Yes very good, is it working?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5841] Yes I think so, didn't you like it today?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5842] yes
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5843] didn't know about that fish, did you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5844] well I've read, I seem to remember something
                           about it
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5845] I mean you've gotta remember all those years
                           back all those things can you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5846] mind you for yea , when old Charles's said we
                           crawled out the sea
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5847] yes ... but it seemed a bit far fetched, if
                           they said that
Arthur (PS03S)             [5848] but any then look at it like this
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5849] if that's been caught now why hasn't that ...
                           changed
Arthur (PS03S)             [5850] well it's the stoppage in evolution
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5851] well in sixty nine or whatever
Arthur (PS03S)             [5852] but, er, you look at it like this then, if we
                           didn't crawl out of the sea and er evolve then did
                           we just appear like a flash of lighting
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5853] no, no I'm not saying that we did, we did
                           evolve
Arthur (PS03S)             [5854] oh
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5855] but
Arthur (PS03S)             [5856] we must evolved somehow
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5857] why hasn't that fish that they caught
                           recently evolved?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5858] yes, well I used to read a lot of story
                           books, travel avidly and I think I forget all about
                           the author and the story, but I remember one portion
                           where they discovered a depression in the middle of
                           a continent where it was in excess of and they'd
                           grown quite a different specie
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5859] of what men?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5860] the human , human's, you know I know it's
                           only a story
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5861] I know several stages I know that
Arthur (PS03S)             [5862] eh?, but er
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5863] I mean there were several stages before they
                           got to present day man, but
Arthur (PS03S)             [5864] yes, but they do know,le let's go back a bit
                           further, but they do know at the beginning of the
                           world most of it is water
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5865] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [5866] so it's quite feasible
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5867] oh it is
Arthur (PS03S)             [5868] if, if, if it was three quarters water er
                           human's must of been in the water to start with
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5869] well not human's, but
Arthur (PS03S)             [5870] well whatever we comes
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5871] antecedence of humans, mm ... I don't know
Arthur (PS03S)             [5872] I mean we've still got a barren at the back,
                           somebody kicks you at the back on that barren and er
                           in the skeleton that's exactly like the barren in a
                           monkey's tail
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5873] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5874] so at one time the theory is we our, we did
                           have a tail
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5875] mm yes, but we didn't have a tail in the sea
                           then did you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5876] and then another thing you got
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5877] fish don't have
Arthur (PS03S)             [5878] fin finger nails, well surely millions of
                           years ago they were claws
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5879] possibly
Arthur (PS03S)             [5880] then you've got your two prominent teeth,
                           they could of been the tiger's two teeth ...
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5881] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5882] and then there's another theory with your
                           feet, you know that bit of skin between your toes,
                           they claim that was web at one time
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5883] well isn't, you don't know much of
Arthur (PS03S)             [5884] not know, of course there's a, wears away
                           with lack of use, but when you're in the water you
                           want web feet because there
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5885] yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [5886] the water I'll go through your fingers
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5887] mm, mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5888] this, this skin here
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5889] yeah I know that
Arthur (PS03S)             [5890] it's not pronounced in mine , but, some er
                           they say that with where it's gone away, you know,
                           there's all sorts of things that can prove it ... I
                           mean the obvious thing is we came from somewhere
                           didn't we?, we didn't just drop here with a flash of
                           light ... and er they've studied plants and other
                           animals and they evolved.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5891] Yes, but plants evolved with men's, man's
Arthur (PS03S)             [5892] I hope that they, they had had on their own
                           for
Unknown speaker (KBBPSUNK) [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [5893] a million years, the plants did
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5894] I don't know, probably several hundred
                           million years ... mm, can't really understand them
                           ... can you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5895] well, you'd go mad if you tried wouldn't ya?,
                           like that man said the other week, er, you, human's
                           invented god, well they did didn't they?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5896] mm, did you take that tape out in the other
                           room?
Arthur (PS03S)             [5897] yeah, to cut, cut a in that
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5898] oh did you know
Arthur (PS03S)             [5899] and the other thing
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5900] do you know where it is because it in't in
                           this
Arthur (PS03S)             [5901] yes I left it there to call off
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5902] oh I see
Arthur (PS03S)             [5903] well if I've left it there to call off I'm
                           not gonna put it in the case and shove it away
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5904] well I know, well you want to label it so you
                           know what's on it ... just reminding you, you say,
                           oh you'll say you didn't remind me to write it down
Arthur (PS03S)             [5905] yes cos you always right, you remind me at
                           the wrong time and the wrong thing
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5906] no I don't
Arthur (PS03S)             [5907] yes you do ... oh I was gonna say something,
                           you put me off now
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5908] mm, I'm always putting you off, I put myself
                           off ... you don't concentrate.
Arthur (PS03S)             [5909] well you're alr the, point it's greater the
                           things they find it, that er three quarter of the
                           world were water once
Evelyn (PS03T)             [5910] yes I know, you said that, you going to have

                           don't think

                           religion weren't they?

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5954] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [5955] the vicar used to come and sit at the back

Evelyn (PS03T)             [5958] well I expect if it was a church school they

                           say well that should go that way and that should go
                           that way and to me that's immaterial if you just see
                           it going, see it, if its working that's it, know

                           whistler he kept instead of her, couldn't he? ...

                           cups on there
Arthur (PS03S)             [6185] but er, any thing that's put in the spare

Evelyn (PS03T)             [6426] well, they wouldn't be making curtains, I

                           two packets
Arthur (PS03S)             [6440] mm
Evelyn (PS03T)             [6441] that's a gimmick isn't it?
Arthur (PS03S)             [6442] mm
Evelyn (PS03T)             [6443] five in a packet
Arthur (PS03S)             [6444] yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [6445] of screws and, and odd screws no good, so,
                           mostly is it, so you have to buy two packets
Arthur (PS03S)             [6446] still its always handy to have one or two as
                           spares
Evelyn (PS03T)             [6447] I don't know, you've got a great big tin full

Evelyn (PS03T)             [6453] oh is that it? ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [6454] you take a lot of convincing
Evelyn (PS03T)             [6455] no, but one side, one sides not
Arthur (PS03S)             [6456] sometimes
Evelyn (PS03T)             [6457] cos it was coming up when Tom fetched it
                           down, not closed up

                           dust glass, image that why should you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [6471] well you should wipe the outside of the frame

               minus to minus, you can't mix them up.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6702] Well I know you can't.
               [6703] ... Do you want any more soup with that erm potato, those

               satisfied.
               [6714] ... You were going with the picture on the outside, well

               with things.
               [6742] Just get on with it. ...
Arthur (PS03S) [6743] There's nothing like forward planning.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6744] [laughing] Ooh [] ... you're the least planner ... I've
               ever known.
               [6745] ... Or organizer should I say, you're the worst organizer

               you emptying the first bag.

               [6758] ... And I haven't got any stashed away.
Arthur (PS03S) [6759] Well we shall have to get some then if, when it's
               propitious.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6760] You don't want to go this afternoon do you?
Arthur (PS03S) [6761] Not particularly.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6762] Anyway you can't go in the car cos you've had some drink.
               [6763] ... Go first thing in the morning.

Arthur (PS03S) [6786] No not really a cheese man.
               [6787] I don't mind a bit on a biscuit on occasion but
Evelyn (PS03T) [6788] Oh I thought you used to love cheese.

Arthur (PS03S) [6800] Well you see they've been brainwashed to that sort of
               music so they're bound to, bound to like it.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6801] I know but it's not all that sort it's erm ... I mean you

Arthur (PS03S) [6805] They've bound to go for it aren't they at that age.
               [6806] They only like to listen to rubbish. [sniff]
Evelyn (PS03T) [6807] No they don't.
Arthur (PS03S) [6808] Why people spend good money to go and listen to that sort
               of stuff I'll never know.

Arthur (PS03S) [6818] Well and what do you reckon those are, now all those,
               would they have [...] pop music?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6819] Well times were different weren't they.

Arthur (PS03S) [6823] I have a quiet feeling that this no reading and no a add
               up and all that stuff co co stems from the music they're always
               listening to. ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [6824] No it's not, it's the teachers.
Arthur (PS03S) [6825] They walk by with headphones on don't they?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6826] I know.
               [6827] No a lot of it's these young teachers.
               [6828] And probably the training colleges.
Arthur (PS03S) [6829] [...] yes but teachers are like them aren't they?

Evelyn (PS03T) [6831] Well that's what I, that's what I mean.

Arthur (PS03S) [6838] No thanks.
               [6839] And a severe
Evelyn (PS03T) [6840] I'm going to have to clear up and go in the other room.
Arthur (PS03S) [6841] a severe expression and it wasn't put on.
               [6842] ... It was built in.
               [6843] ... We had screens on wheels in latter years at, last few
               years at school and er ... he used to go down to the tea room
               for a cup of tea half way down the stairs, the teachers' room
               and perhaps go toilet as well, and er ... the one at the back
               was a foot out from the screen and every now and then he'd have
               a look to see if he was coming and er we, what had [...] had a
               big case with birds in and the lads who were doing it looked in
               this, saw the reflection and shh he's coming.
               [6844] So er er after a bit you see he changed them round, he,
               he guessed somebody were ... and of course I got the job ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [6845] I'm glad I'm getting rid of all the Christmas remnants.
               [6846] I've only got one round case and about two vol au vents
Arthur (PS03S) [6847] I forgot about that.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6848] so

Arthur (PS03S) [6862] with all this ... you arguing and telling me I'm wrong
               when I'm right and right when I'm wrong.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6863] No I'm not!
               [6864] ... In fact I felt tired and when I went to change I er
Arthur (PS03S) [6865] Went on the bed.

Arthur (PS03S) [6867] Oh if you'd shouted down I'd've g come with you.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6868] Oh no you wouldn't.
               [6869] No I didn't but I just changed and came down here and put
               my feet up here. ...
Arthur (PS03S) [6870] Yeah we're getting on now so
Evelyn (PS03T) [6871] I keep going cold.
Arthur (PS03S) [6872] Somebody said in the paper shop that ... looking for the
               papers er I thought, I couldn't see any, I was starting to walk
               out I said have you finished with the papers, said no there they
               are in that cabinet
Evelyn (PS03T) [6873] Oh they're always changing the position.

               at eighty two, she said you're never eighty two I said I am, she
               said well you look well on it.
               [6875] ... I said yes I can rise to the occasion as well.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6876] Well that's a silly remark to make.
Arthur (PS03S) [6877] [laugh] ... Well I can rise to any occasion
Evelyn (PS03T) [6878] Pardon?
Arthur (PS03S) [6879] woodwork, windows, anything. ...

               dustbin.

Evelyn (PS03T) [6888] And I didn't cut, you know I didn't cut it up, I just
               left it.
Arthur (PS03S) [6889] About another three weeks we should be out of the real
               winter shan't we?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6890] Should be.
               [6891] Although March can be ... pretty cold.
Arthur (PS03S) [6892] [...] February.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6893] February's usually the worst.
Arthur (PS03S) [6894] February you get wet snow and rain.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6895] Mm. ...
Arthur (PS03S) [6896] Mind you don't burn that ch table.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6897] Well you pushed the table nearer the fire.
               [6898] It was, you left the back door open that's what's made
               it, the room cold. ...

Evelyn (PS03T) [6909] Keeps your brain active.
Arthur (PS03S) [6910] Yeah well ... use it on there then.
Evelyn (PS03T) [laugh]
Arthur (PS03S) [6911] By the way is it er
Evelyn (PS03T) [6912] It's still recording I think.
               [6913] ... Might as well use this tape up and ... [...]
Arthur (PS03S) [6914] Do you think I ought to finish the ship first of all or
               do the oil painting? ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [6915] Well if you've got to go in the garage, it's too cold to
               go in there to finish the ship off so you'd better paint in the
               house hadn't you? ...
Arthur (PS03S) [6916] Well if I want to turn something [...] I've gotta keep
               walking in and out and I don't wanna do that.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6917] Well then leave that till warmer weather.
               [6918] ... It's not ready for rigging yet is it?
Arthur (PS03S) [6919] Will you take that to Tom's or not?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6920] Who?
Arthur (PS03S) [6921] Your Tom. ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [6922] If we go tomorrow, yes.
               [6923] We might as well use a tape up.
Arthur (PS03S) [6924] Do a pennorth do a pennorth of it can't you?
Evelyn (PS03T) [laugh]
Arthur (PS03S) [6925] Perhaps Maggie's got some bright ideas of
Evelyn (PS03T) [6926] I doubt it.
Arthur (PS03S) [6927] Cath I know who could fill it up, Cath.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6928] [laughing] Cath [] .
               [6929] Well we've got to go round there if we're out to [...]
               because erm we've still got Penny's [...]
Arthur (PS03S) [6930] Well it'd show willing if we did get a bit of all on
               wouldn't it?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6931] A few more. ...
Arthur (PS03S) [6932] I mean if, if they had,ha had nursery rhymes.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6933] [laughing] No don't be silly [] they just want
               vocabulary, they don't want things like that, they want to know
               ... a person's vocabulary a to cer you know, at a certain age.
               [6934] ... I think the ... not doing very well with some sixteen
               year olds.
Arthur (PS03S) [...]
Evelyn (PS03T) [6935] No!
               [6936] Tim's got that lady friend.
Arthur (PS03S) [6937] I know he w she were on about a room weren't she?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6938] No!
               [6939] Why would Tim want to come and live here?
Arthur (PS03S) [6940] I didn't say he would but Cath might want him to.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6941] No course she wouldn't!
               [6942] ... Anyway Tim's paying a lot towards that house.
Arthur (PS03S) [6943] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6944] You know he paid for it to be [...]
Arthur (PS03S) [6945] Well that [...] very much when you live there does it?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6946] Well
Arthur (PS03S) [6947] Look what we pay [...]
Evelyn (PS03T) [...]
Arthur (PS03S) [6948] Look what we
Evelyn (PS03T) [6949] And then the double glazing cost over a thousand.
Arthur (PS03S) [6950] Mm.
               [6951] Glad we didn't have it then.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6952] Well it is about, about a thousand for one bay window so
               she's had the whole house done ... so it's probably nearer
               three.
Arthur (PS03S) [6953] But can you honestly say you've been cold in this house?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6954] No. ...
Arthur (PS03S) [6955] I've been in digs
Evelyn (PS03T) [6956] Well where lots of people [...]
Arthur (PS03S) [6957] I've been in digs where you went to bed and you've had to
               put your top coat on the bed.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6958] Mm.
               [6959] There are lots of people let the windows go and it was a
               case of either having new wood windows
Arthur (PS03S) [6960] [cough] Yeah or get glazed.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6961] or, or paying the bit extra and have it double glazed.
Arthur (PS03S) [6962] Yes but you can't open your windows in the summer.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6963] Well you can with double glazing, some [...]
Arthur (PS03S) [cough]
Evelyn (PS03T) [6964] but you can have vents.
               [6965] ... But while our wood frames are in condition
Arthur (PS03S) [6966] Yeah what sort of problem is it when you, say a kid broke
               the window like they broke ours, what sort of problem is it as
               opposed to these?
Evelyn (PS03T) [6967] Well you get it done on the insurance, your insurance
               covers that.
Arthur (PS03S) [6968] I don't mean that I mean it w is it a bigger job or s
Evelyn (PS03T) [6969] Well of course it would be.
Arthur (PS03S) [6970] Well then.
               [6971] That, you take that into consideration an'all.
Evelyn (PS03T) [6972] If you get it done on the insurance I don't suppose
               people worry.
Arthur (PS03S) [6973] There's always a debit side.

               creams
Evelyn (PS03T) [7027] Mm

Evelyn (PS03T) [7043] clipped them off and the wind's blown the flowers from
               the corner.
               [7044] Wh when I went to shut the gate after that man had left
               it open I er I went round and dead-headed them all.
Arthur (PS03S) [7045] I can't understand tradesmen, they come hoping for
               business
Evelyn (PS03T) [7046] [laughing] And leave your gate open [] .
Arthur (PS03S) [7047] and leave your gate wide open for the dogs to come in
               and, and tear your ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [7048] Plants.
Arthur (PS03S) [7049] plants up.
Evelyn (PS03T) [7050] Hmm.
Arthur (PS03S) [7051] But I mean i it's beyond belief innit?
               [7052] If I wanted somebody to ... buy what I'd got I'd be
               scrupulous about that, wouldn't you?
Evelyn (PS03T) [7053] Well it's the people they employ, probably, not the
               people who are ... who er ...
Arthur (PS03S) [7054] Do you, do you think
Evelyn (PS03T) [7055] want the business.

               they leave their own father's gate open like
Evelyn (PS03T) [7057] They probably haven't got any.
               [7058] ... I mean really when you look round here most people
               have taken the gates off haven't they?
Arthur (PS03S) [7059] Yes.
               [7060] Oh w oh w er have to, up the top, you know those two ...
               she said why don't you take your gates off like us, I said why
               should I?
               [7061] I said what do you have gates for if not to close them?
               [7062] ... No point having a gate is there if you don't close
               it? ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [7063] Well they do it because they're lazy.

Arthur (PS03S) [7065] No
Evelyn (PS03T) [7066] straight in with their cars.
Arthur (PS03S) [7067] it's deeper than that, they don't like what they see.
               [7068] If they don't like what they see they spoil it.
               [7069] ... Watch the children today.
               [7070] ... And they'll get worse. ...
Evelyn (PS03T) [7071] Is that somebody's alarm ringing?
               [7072] ... It's a bit wet isn't it?

               but one the alarm went, go to the front door.
               [7088] It's not the fire.
Arthur (PS03S) [7089] Yeah but listen.
               [7090] ... Can hear it somewhere but, still it don't make a
               difference does it?

Evelyn (PS03T) [7093] Unless there's a van there
Arthur (PS03S) [7094] The birds are all gone.

               standing in the gangway.

               ... you wouldn't wait for a corporation, I said wait, wait for
               the big bus.

               invariably they're a bit over into the gangway ... well if a
               chap kept pushing against us as the car went round corners ...
               it wouldn't be very nice would it?
               [7133] Some might like it, some might object.
Evelyn (PS03T) [7134] Well they wouldn't get on again if they objected would
               they?

                           but erm ... it wasn't perhaps, perhaps I didn't cook

                           and do a ... do a curry, rice ... or spaghetti

Arthur (PS03S)             [7872] it's thicker than hack saw blade, perhaps a
                           bit heavier
Evelyn (PS03T)             [7873] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [7874] straight across and then put a cross on the

Les (PS0YX)                [7912] yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [7913] I the, the disturbed at the way the English
                           lads are speaking
Les (PS0YX)                [7914] ooh without a doubt
Arthur (PS03S)             [7915] in a way they find out
Evelyn (PS03T)             [7916] no I think that it's to get the vocabulary
                           various classes of people and varies age group
Arthur (PS03S)             [7917] yeah, but as Les says there's more in it than
                           that
Les (PS0YX)                [7918] there's a, there's of course the entire
                           speaking
Unknown speaker (KBBPSUNK) [...]

Les (PS0YX)                [8037] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8038] they won't burn ya
Les (PS0YX)                [8039] no ... yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8040] I mean they're like er ha hard plastic
Les (PS0YX)                [8041] it is in't it, yes it's like it
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8042] what are ours?
Arthur (PS03S)             [8043] er well metal you see there look
Les (PS0YX)                [8044] yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8045] well you don't, you don't have to make it in
                           plastic do you?
Arthur (PS03S)             [8046] well it does it, its method is to shove them
                           on
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8047] oh
Arthur (PS03S)             [8048] er in or out according to where he wants them
                           to flicker, well you see, as it, as the wearing get
                           hot, that plastic expands and become loose and he's
                           got a, a split, see that steel thing
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8049] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [8050] ours is like that solid, well his is split,
                           the idea that is you opened it like that, so when
                           you push your others on, it has to compress it and
                           it holds, but over the years it's er ... the body
Les (PS0YX)                [8051] weaked
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8052] the body
Les (PS0YX)                [8053] yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8054] yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [8055] er, er, I can make you one in plastic
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8056] what [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [8057] but er

                           two bars
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8065] mm
Les (PS0YX)                [8066] yeah, they're very good and er, funny that,

Les (PS0YX)                [8112] yes
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8113] er, it's still not very strong

Evelyn (PS03T)             [8115] no
Les (PS0YX)                [8116] mm [sniff]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8117] but the swellings gone down mostly I've got

                           while

Les (PS0YX)                [8120] Christmas, yes yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8121] so ...
Les (PS0YX)                [8122] yes ...
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8123] I think I'll go
Arthur (PS03S)             [8124] you can't draw it in yellow cos it don't er
                           take on this so I'm going
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8125] you don't have to draw it in yellow
Les (PS0YX)                [8126] no, no I'll be alright now
Arthur (PS03S)             [8127] if you do them both white it looks all wrong
Les (PS0YX)                [8128] yeah
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8129] but you've got different colour pencils
Arthur (PS03S)             [8130] now this green is your, your yellow
Les (PS0YX)                [8131] yes ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [8132] er there's a slit there ain't there like
                           that?, keep this still
Les (PS0YX)                [8133] yes, that's right, it's open, yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [8134] well
Les (PS0YX)                [8135] oh that's how, how it works
Arthur (PS03S)             [8136] now that's, that's the wall of your yellows
Les (PS0YX)                [8137] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8138] broken
Les (PS0YX)                [8139] that's right
Arthur (PS03S)             [8140] and that's the other wall which you need to
                           go
Les (PS0YX)                [8141] yes, as far as I can see with the other one's

Arthur (PS03S)             [8142] yeah
Les (PS0YX)                [8143] still on yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8144] yeah , they now, looking at end ways, it's
                           like this ... in't it?
Les (PS0YX)                [8145] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8146] that's your, your yellow plastic
Les (PS0YX)                [8147] that's right it's just on the end
Arthur (PS03S)             [8148] that's it now here's your steel bit that's
                           split
Les (PS0YX)                [8149] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8150] like that
Les (PS0YX)                [8151] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8152] so if you open that er steel bit
Les (PS0YX)                [8153] yes ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [8154] wide like that
Les (PS0YX)                [8155] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8156] wider than what it is
Les (PS0YX)                [8157] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8158] it grips when you push it on
Les (PS0YX)                [8159] that's right
Arthur (PS03S)             [8160] and the idea that is, is I see it
Les (PS0YX)                [8161] yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [8162] is you want
Les (PS0YX)                [8163] so they will slot it won't they?
Arthur (PS03S)             [8164] yeah as I, no, no not the yellow, the, the
                           metals slot in
Les (PS0YX)                [8165] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8166] and the idea is so you, you push it down to
                           earth, you want it down to there
Les (PS0YX)                [8167] in other words you can move it up and down
                           aargh
Arthur (PS03S)             [8168] and I reckon that's it, that's broke on your
                           movement you see
Les (PS0YX)                [8169] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8170] it's, these walls have broken off there
Les (PS0YX)                [8171] mm ...
Arthur (PS03S)             [8172] see those two walls
Les (PS0YX)                [8173] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8174] and that's the bottom bit, and that, that
                           there's your steel inside
Les (PS0YX)                [8175] yes that's right
Arthur (PS03S)             [8176] but these have broken off and of course it's
                           dropped off
Les (PS0YX)                [8177] I
Arthur (PS03S)             [8178] so what I'll shall have to make you is a, you
                           can either have it in metal, or in plastic
Les (PS0YX)                [8179] whatever is, is, is easiest for you Arthur
                           you're doing
Arthur (PS03S)             [8180] well I think it's both easy, but er
Les (PS0YX)                [8181] yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [8182] there, it's done with plastic so it don't get
                           red hot when you, when you adjust it
Les (PS0YX)                [8183] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8184] but then again you'd be a bit daft
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8185] don't suppose you adjust it very often do ya?
Arthur (PS03S)             [8186] no, but you'll be a bit
Les (PS0YX)                [8187] never touched it I haven't
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8188] no
Arthur (PS03S)             [8189] you'll be a bit daft to adjust it when it was
                           hot wouldn't ya?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8190] mm, yeah
Les (PS0YX)                [8191] yes, but I've never touched them er
Unknown speaker (KBBPSUNK) [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [8192] if it was mine I'd er, I'd er
Les (PS0YX)                [8193] I've took these off to, to put the bulbs in
Evelyn (PS03T)             [8194] mm
Arthur (PS03S)             [8195] for my money I'd have it with all metal
Les (PS0YX)                [8196] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8197] but that's the i you see the idea of it now
                           can't ya?
Les (PS0YX)                [8198] yes, yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8199] your yellow bits slides along here to where
                           they were, here's your, here's your point
Les (PS0YX)                [8200] yeah
Arthur (PS03S)             [8201] you can have it there, you can have it there,
                           you can have it there
Les (PS0YX)                [8202] ah, ah
Arthur (PS03S)             [8203] by pushing it up and down
Les (PS0YX)                [8204] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8205] and this gets very hot, well fairly hot
Les (PS0YX)                [8206] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8207] and the plastic soft and broke
Les (PS0YX)                [8208] yes I think what I can see of er of what's on
                           the other one on each fire

Les (PS0YX)                [8259] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8260] you'd have this effect, see ... there's your
                           wall ... and the, that ... then you pin up the
                           middle like that
Les (PS0YX)                [8261] ah, yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8262] you see, but now that, if that were metal and

Les (PS0YX)                [8263] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8264] you know, what you say that's split
Les (PS0YX)                [8265] yes, where it's gotta go on
Arthur (PS03S)             [8266] yeah, gotta go on like that in't it?
Les (PS0YX)                [8267] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8268] now, for my money now if that were loose I'd
                           open these
Les (PS0YX)                [8269] shall
Arthur (PS03S)             [8270] no
Evelyn (PS03T)             [cough]
Arthur (PS03S)             [8271] strip, straight them open so that, they're

Les (PS0YX)                [8274] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8275] and then if you did that it would tighten on
                           to your walls
Les (PS0YX)                [8276] yes
Arthur (PS03S)             [8277] and you could make, adjust it and it'd stay

Les (PS0YX)                [8278] ah
Arthur (PS03S)             [8279] but over the years it's got loose and you've
                           probably fiddled and it did broken
Les (PS0YX)                [8280] ah

                           you see ... the other side ... would be a rubbish

                           [9117] But then
Evelyn (PS03T)             [9118] They probably wouldn't take it.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [9120] I know , but

Arthur (PS03S)             [10501] What's he say?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [10502] He says he's feeling a lot better and he's
                           back on the road.
Arthur (PS03S)             [10503] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [10504] So I shouldn't think he's been driving for
                           some time and
Arthur (PS03S)             [10505] No.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [10506] he's back from Catherine's.
Arthur (PS03S)             [10507] Is he coming?

                           arrangements much in advance because I never know
                           how ... I'm feeling.
Arthur (PS03S)             [10512] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [10513] He seems to me, a bit like Joan doesn't it?
Arthur (PS03S)             [10514] Yeah it probably is with the trauma of
                           losing his wife.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [10515] So ... er ... anyway

                           arrange something.

Arthur (PS03S)             [10523] Did you, so you didn't tell him I'd like him

Arthur (PS03S)             [10984] I know, but you might fall over them, drop

                           [11002] They don't seem to be scratched do they?
Arthur (PS03S)             [11003] Well do don't look as if they've been used
                           does it?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11004] Well she said they only have them on er

Evelyn (PS03T)             [11054] You sit in there.
                           [11055] Don't sit on there.

Arthur (PS03S)             [11062] I can do, I think, stop it.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11063] How many more have you got left from the
                           Christmas box tapes?
Arthur (PS03S)             [11064] Two, four ... two or four I should think.
                           [11065] This one here, I think that's been play ,
                           that's been played on.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11066] I told you to keep the new ones separate.
                           [11067] You'll get them all mixed up!
Arthur (PS03S)             [11068] See how it goes.
                           [11069] They are.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11070] Oh.

Arthur (PS03S)             [11073] What's that?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11074] Nothing.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11075] Baker Conway, he's is a ... we wanted one
                           ... of his things.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11076] Yes.
                           [11077] And you got him now for nothing.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11078] I think he went on a liner.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11079] Well he did!
Arthur (PS03S)             [11080] And then
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11081] Well all of his [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [11082] and erm one of them lost th use of his
                           fingers.
                           [11083] It wasn't when they
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11084] I think that was him.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11085] Probably was.
                           [11086] ... I wish I'd have carried on with piano
                           lessons.
                           [11087] But then we used to se
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11088] Your mum must have read that little finger.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11089] Then we used to sniff, you know, and ... Mrs
                           come and knocked on the front door ... says er, our
                           house is asleep do you mind not playing, you know.
                           [11090] Cos er ... there were only four and a half
                           inch divide in brick walls.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11091] Mm.
                           [11092] Yeah!
                           [11093] Mm.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11094] So I mean ... not double.
                           [11095] These er, these mi might be the same, but
                           ... you can't expect to have to stop sound going
                           through a four and a half inch wall can you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11096] We had a piano but ... nobody
Arthur (PS03S)             [11097] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11098] ever complained about us practising.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11099] Well, you got good neighbours then, that's
                           all I can say.
                           [11100] ... She came and knocked on the door and
                           then we went back and I, I said what you stopped
                           for?
                           [11101] I says er, so I said, started playing ...
                           ten minutes, she couldn't have got up the stairs and
                           were back again!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11102] Mm!
Arthur (PS03S)             [11103] Asking us to stop.
                           [11104] So that was it.
                           [11105] That ended the first on my piano.
                           [11106] I mean, you can't practise piano if people
                           next door complain can you?
                           [11107] ... Can you?

                           they'd do it all out the front doors like this a and
                           ... fresh, fresh people trying to get in.
                           [11114] And th the pianos were going full blast!

                           a drum set for Christmas.
                           [11120] He was about seventeen or eighteen then.
                           [11121] ... I thought you said

                           [11125] It's about finished now.
                           [11126] This is.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [11352] Erm
Arthur (PS03S)             [11353] Used to be a tearjerker.
                           [11354] Then it was the boy stood on the burning
                           decks.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11355] Oh!
                           [11356] Shut up!
Arthur (PS03S)             [11357] That was another one.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11358] Now tomorrow , all I've got to get is meat.

                           [11368] For the birds, more like.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11369] There were two cock blackbirds this morning.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11370] No, will you have, you're not very keen on
                           fish.
                           [11371] So I'll get a bit of fish for myself.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11372] I think that's putting it mildly!
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11373] What?
Arthur (PS03S)             [11374] You remember in France, the er ... they made

Evelyn (PS03T)             [11380] I don't like the bouillabaisse.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11381] Well that's ... no.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11382] Although, at that place ... it was alright
                           but
Arthur (PS03S)             [11383] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11384] it's not one of my favourite ones.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11385] What was your favourite?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11386] What is my favourite?
Arthur (PS03S)             [11387] Mm.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11388] I don't know.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11389] It still is then, I suppose, by that.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11390] Well it [...]
Arthur (PS03S)             [11391] What was, means the past but ... is, means
                           the present.

                           [laugh]
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11396] Well you needn't put it on there
Arthur (PS03S)             [11397] You don't, you don't hear that now do you?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11398] Well don't put it on there!
                           [11399] You do in some parts of Leicester.

                           [11410] They're shooting through.
                           [11411] ... This side's not as good as the other one
                           is it?

                           [11415] ... I think that Welsh dresser looks better
                           without that teapot on it now.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11416] Well i i li

                           rest of the things.
Arthur (PS03S)             [11422] Well no, well he said that but
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11423] Yes.

Evelyn (PS03T)             [11429] We don't know a Bill.

                           Tina doesn't he?
Arthur (PS03S)             [11435] That's not much of an allotment now is it
                           though?
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11436] No, but he

Evelyn (PS03T)             [11438] Yeah.

Arthur (PS03S)             [11447] Yeah.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11448] And then the next time, a few years later
                           ... he'd got it back
Arthur (PS03S)             [11449] Mm.

Arthur (PS03S)             [11458] He didn't bother.
Evelyn (PS03T)             [11459] let it go.
