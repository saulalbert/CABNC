*PS00A:	Now so much more time has been released for us to be the church but at the same time we have nowhere to hide and nothing to blame It has meant that churches need to be bold and be young or a threat to what we belong to as the edges between church and and community have blurred we are now much more vulnerable Somebody said like a tortoise without a shell And we need a greater trust in God It has also meant a greater love for one another as we can share our faith and come face to face with who we are .  1130105_1177205
*KB0PSUN:	I 'm glad that Pat used the word exciting but all the story you 've heard this morning are exciting But it does Pat does n't it also danger It also means fear it also means pain I do n't know no any more what church is I do n't know any more and I 'm supposed to come this morning and help to discover what unity is It blurred so much and in the blurring we have discovered our own vulnerabilities And having raised our banners of church proudly a change is all what changes should have been I see now narrow mindedness I see the deathedness I see suspicion of other communities I see jealousies However I am discovering that the church probably not the community but more a communion and that 's perhaps an answer to what Nanette Or within the communion of our Lord Jesus Christ in word and sacrament and that living out of his love is his body and finding community Communion actually the Holy Communion has become so much more important to us and so much more exciting to us because we 're not just celebrating the living Christ we 're also celebrating the crucified Christ and we 're simply meeting our pain and our joys together in communion with him I once watched a film on the telly it was a pretty crap film really It was American no sorry it 's not .  1180105_1277417

*KB0PSUN:	See yes the thing about community It was a simple story and I would of forgotten it er about a woman struggling to bring up a family in a depression The story was that her husband in the deep south was killed by some young hoodlums who were black She was left to bring up a family she had to go the banks for money the banks were all and they refused her money to keep the farm going She took on a black lad and because she did that she was ostracised from the rest of the community He eventually was driven off the farm but the respectable white people who went to church The story of course was a happy ending that she struggled on and she did it But for some strange reason and I do n't know whether they direct it to Christian the last shot of the film almost unnoticeable because the credits were going up she went back into church and it was a communion service and all you saw was her receiving the bread and passing the plate and the plate was to the young black lad on the farm and you thought he 's come back But then no he passed the plate then to the woman 's husband who had been killed And then the plate was passed from him to his murderer and it was passed round until it was passed to the bank manager who would n't give her the money and then back to her And somehow but I ca n't explain it in that moment that what community 's about it 's about the not yet as well your About the journey being on and the reconciliation o of them And that 's where we are and this morning Thank you .  1278477_1405157
