*MAR:	Oh I thought it was me making all that noise.I was breathing and I could hear sort of I was thinking first of all it was coming from, you know   (.) somewhere outside like somebody
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	sawing a tree or something. (.) Widening the road here or something.
*TER:	Yes, just widening it and straightening out some of the bends.
*MAR:	 (        ) cos that was a bend there wasn't it, obviously.
*TER:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	Gosh the valley goes really far down there.
*TER:	Yeah it is deep down isn't it? (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) one or two houses, you know, when I caught sight of it first   (.) I don't see them now. (.)  ((cough)) He must have been fishing.
*TER:	Looks like it doesn't it?
*MAR:	 ((cough)) He's got a big keeper net there. (.) Was the disabled toilet alright?
*TER:	 [laughing] Yeah   []  (.) 
*MAR:	Nice little waterfall things.
*TER:	Yes, a weir. (.) 
*MAR:	It's good to have those on the ground, you know, for people who are    (.)  (        ) gosh   (.) who are you know incapacitated.But sometimes people think well they're only for disabled but   (.) I don't believe that's so
*TER:	No I don't think it is either.
*MAR:	because I think to myself well   (.) you know   (.) if there are no disabled people about, and more often than not   (.) there are not   (.) why shouldn't anybody use them?
*TER:	That's it.
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	we're going past. (.)  (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*TER:	Mm
*MAR:	big erm tree   (        ) 
*TER:	tree that's making it fall down yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	The thing is beginning to look   (.) you know   (        ) light comes 
*TER:	They're gonna get, yes 
*MAR:	through it.
*TER:	that's right. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        )  (.)  (        ) had to take a sort of erm    (.)  (        ) south to   (.) erm   (.) not    (        )  (.) just thought of both the names    (.)  (        ) and the other one   (.) but they would be nearer to Exeter   (.) but it wouldn't be sort of in Exeter itself   (.) I was thinking, you know, probably get erm   (.) you know, see if there's any new houses being built there and   (.) what sort of price and what have you.
*TER:	Yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*TER:	I'm not quite sure where you mean.
*MAR:	Well it's sort of on its way to Exeter. (.) Chudleigh
*TER:	Chudleigh  (.) 
*MAR:	Mm we haven't been through this way for a long time have we?
*TER:	No we haven't. (.) I could certainly do with a drink.
*MAR:	Could you?
*TER:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	Well I suppose it's not far to go home for a   (.) well it'd be nice if we saw somewhere that was nice. (.) Or do you know somewhere?
*TER:	No I don't know anywhere, no. (.) 
*MAR:	The    (        )  (.) The Olde Lion, don't think we'll go there. (.)  (        ) open for lunch and dinner. (.) The Coach
*TER:	The Coach House 
*MAR:	House   (.) Funnily enough I was   [laughing] going to say to you   [] when we were out at erm Dartington instead of buying that ice cream, we should of had a cup of tea   (.) probably would of been about the same price, and so  [] 
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	 ((laugh))  (.) Probably the tea would of been better for us. (.) Small development, that must, that must be down there somewhere.But you see practically anywhere here would be within Christopher's  (.) 
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	erm   (.) you know, distance into   (.) Exeter.I mean he was saying that er     (.)  (        )  (.) erm what do you call him? (        ) 
*TER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Yeah   (.) he lives in erm   (.) in, in   (        )  (.) 
*TER:	No it's warehouse units going up there, I thought it was gonna be housing, more houses.
*MAR:	Oh there i there is new housing, you know, there's more 
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	development er back there, that's what made me think of it. (.) They wouldn't want to be near warehousing units of course but erm   (.) there's a lot of new building going on and with so much competition   (.) Thinking of Imelda for a job, I mean   (.) there's, there's loads of places here as well for her     (.)  (        )  (.) Exeter Hospital    (        )  (.) you know the    (        )  (.) Torbay. (.) Somebody mind you was   (        ) on about Torbay this morning on the   (.) radio I think it was   (.) saying that there were so many complaints and nurses are under such great stress. (.) And     [laughing]  (        )  [] I was very naughty I, I   (.) felt like saying well some of their, they, them aren't   (.) er do you remember the very last time we were up in the hospital at the waiting area, there was those two nurses that walked up and down 
*TER:	Mm mm 
*MAR:	about five times doing nothing. (.) 
*TER:	That's right.
*MAR:	 ((cough))  (.) So really and truly I mean it's not all nurses that are so stressed.I'm sure there are some who are   (.) you know, are in a bad way and they're having to do other things that they shouldn't be doing.But this is the trouble with everybody these days isn't it?
*TER:	Yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	Everybody just wants to do what they should be doing whereas   (        ) with my job it never even thought about it did we?
*TER:	No, no. (.) 
*MAR:	Tell you what erm when we get into   (        ) you can just drop me down to   (.) the greengrocer near the church because I'm out of erm   (.) spring onions and if I wanted to   (.) add up to that bit of salad that we've got
*TER:	Right.
*MAR:	tonight, if you're gonna have that, oh I can have a bit some other night then
*TER:	Mhm
*MAR:	But this week is the last   (.) that we can go to the erm Beefeater and get that   (        ) 
*TER:	Oh ha have you got that voucher still?
*MAR:	yeah
*TER:	Oh.
*MAR:	off the cost of a meal.And then you get half of a bottle of wine as well or something. (.)  (        )  (.)  (        )  (.) Got double lines coming up   (.) that's funny   (.) stuck there like that  (.) 
*TER:	Well I didn't sort of notice what it was.
*MAR:	Oh it was just two
*TER:	Oh I see, well some signpost, yeah 
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	poles for a signpost 
*MAR:	 (        ) see them?
*TER:	Yeah I can just see them in the rear mirror. (.) 
*MAR:	Oh could be for a signpost, yes it could indeed. (.)  (        ) red car's coming, coming as well. (.) And another one as well coming. (.)  (        ) 
*TER:	Oh he was far too close you see, he was far 
*MAR:	He's going to tr she, he or she is going to try and go now.
*TER:	he was far too close to it and he didn't see what was happening you see.The other car did. (.) 
*MAR:	He is telling it to go now look, you see he's put on his lights. (.) Yeah   (.) Wonder why the police car put its lights on at that moment.
*TER:	I don't know but erm
*MAR:	Oh you were quite legit
*TER:	Oh I was legit, yes, nothing wrong with me. (.) I was well clear.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) 
*TER:	The other one's not in sight, the whole of that straight.
*MAR:	It never came did it?
*TER:	No. (.) 
*MAR:	But I think the, the tractor driver put on his lights
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	to say it was clear. (.) I was thinking when Daniel was down here   (.) that erm   (.) Paul   (.) you know and all his girlfriends, various girlfriends, for a long time now   (.) and I said something to Daniel well you know are you sort of courting yet?
*TER:	No no, he says no, no 
*MAR:	No. ((laugh))  (.) And I don't think Tim is very interested. (.) I think there's many more women driving now aren't there?If you look.
*TER:	Yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) going round anyway so   (.) she's going round as well 
*TER:	Well I think I'll go round actually cos they're queuing up, (        ) we want to go to the grocers so er if we go up The Avenue   (.) we shall just come past the front of it. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) Colin something or other?I forgot in that second what it was  (        ) 
*TER:	 [laughing] Yeah   [] always happens to me.
*MAR:	It was Colin somebody. (.) 
*TER:	It is well worth going down  (.) 
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) I should think in this day and age they could   (        ) 
*TER:	Now there look at that lot as well.I mean it's amazing isn't it?All on to one post.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) 
*TER:	I think this building is   (.) dreadful for the poor people living in those houses just behind it.
*MAR:	Mm. (.) Oh but this is the erm council office as well isn't it?
*TER:	 (        ) well there's in gonna be income tax isn't there amongst other things. (        ) their light and their view and everything, I think it's dreadful.And it would, I mean they, they wouldn't of even had expensive houses anyway but they must have taken their value away tremendously. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) at the back of the houses there but erm   (.) There's that and then there's the new doctor's surgery.
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	That's been pulled to bits in the erm press.
*TER:	Yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	I've not seen a lot of it actually, so far. (.) 
*TER:	I mean I must say it looks a bit bitty   (.) but erm   (.) er   (.) now you see up there they've got the same, similar sort of style really to those houses. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) Did you ever get in touch with the erm
*TER:	No I didn't, no.
*MAR:	It's not A T S
*TER:	Er well I mean I want to find from A T S or someone like that how much their cars would cost
*MAR:	Well what was the one that erm Maurice gave you?It wasn't A T S was it?No.
*TER:	That was, no that was that was Byrite and that, but I w I would go there but I'd like to go there   (.) with some idea what the price elsewhere is.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.)  (        )  (.) 
*TER:	Oh.
*MAR:	 (        ) round the corner.You'll be in the car. (.)
