@Comment:	conversation #1 (Tape 037901)
*MAR:	He might try and come down again •427925_486625•
*RIC:	What before  •494725_498625•
*MAR:	before then, but you know it depends •498625_523425•
*RIC:	Yeah •523425_524025•
*MAR:	cos he's, this Friday he's taking a group erm youngsters to Paris •525625_576825•
*RIC:	Is he? •578125_583425•
*MAR:	That had been booked you see before •592325_609925•
*RIC:	Yeah •611725_612325•
*MAR:	in fact he was also booked at Easter to go to the erm to Florence •613525_666125•
*RIC:	But he couldn't •669825_673025•
*MAR:	again, but he's had to cancel that •673025_688025•
*RIC:	Yeah, someone else has got to obviously in his place •688025_708525•
*MAR:	Either that or I'd imagine  •709225_729625•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	the people that went before have to sort of do it, but as I say he wasn't er, er •729625_796525•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	we went up at dinner time on the next day and, because he went back after he •796525_845025•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	the morning again, and we took Daniel up to the er, cos there was a station, Christopher picked him up there and off they went you see so erm haven't heard anything I presume  he got back  alright but as I say  •846925_964725•
*RIC:	How's Carris taken all this anyway now? •971825_985925•
*MAR:	Mm? •990825_993725•
*RIC:	How's Carris taken all this now? •995625_100752•
*MAR:	Well seemingly she's erm •101002_102462•
*RIC:	A bit resigned to it now? •103212_103892•
*MAR:	a bit more resigned, there's another, there's another sort of erm possibility, I mean if they sold their house quickly of course then, you know they'd come down here obviously and they'd try and look for something, but it's not likely that they'd sell their house that quickly •104342_122792•
*RIC:	No •124052_124172•
*MAR:	but if they did and •124172_125562•
*RIC:	They sell it •125562_125862•
*MAR:	you know they'd all come down, but if they don't, erm •126162_130112•
*RIC:	Christopher would travel •130112_130692•
*MAR:	possibility is that Marilyn would stay up there for another year with Carris you know in their house and Timothy of course and erm, then sort of move down here •130692_143072•
*RIC:	What after Carris has done her er GCSEs? •143472_145282•
*MAR:	I imagine so, is she due to do them next year? •146182_148002•
*RIC:	No she's not  •148002_148542•
*TER:	No she's not you see she's  •148542_149442•
*RIC:	no  •149442_149502•
*TER:	got another year after that  •149592_150512•
*MAR:	after that oh I thought she was  •150512_151462•
*RIC:	I would of thought I would of thought is she, if they're gonna move this year is the year she's gotta do it  •151462_155642•
*MAR:	Yeah well Christopher knows that •155702_157032•
*RIC:	Yeah •157052_157312•
*MAR:	but erm, if everything else being equal obviously that would be the thing to do •157312_162362•
*TER:	Yes, that'd be me •162362_163672•
*MAR:	but if they can't well  •163672_164902•
*TER:	they won't want to be separated for •164902_167312•
*MAR:	well he  •167312_167582•
*RIC:	twelve months  •167582_167922•
*TER:	twelve months or so •167922_168532•
*MAR:	He's going to be going up erm each weekend if this happens •168532_172332•
*RIC:	Oh yeah I mean that's that's the  •172742_174202•
*MAR:	and erm Marilyn will come down of course when she's at, she's worried as well about whether she's going to get a job, cos er, I mean they need to have erm a second income I should think •174202_187532•
*RIC:	Well yeah, but I don't think the job's erm, I mean that's not the problem for her because she can always go on the agency you see and she can do general midwifery •188552_197902•
*MAR:	Oh on the agency can you? •198452_199582•
*RIC:	Oh yeah, I mean, I mean she can like •199582_202312•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	she used to go to an old person's home of a night time you know •202312_204982•
*MAR:	Yeah •205242_205432•
*RIC:	or, or days, you can pick actually just when you want to do it •205432_208402•
*TER:	Oh yeah that's what she'll get something  •208402_209522•
*RIC:	she'll get paid , she'll get paid travelling and everything for that so that er I don't see that that's erm •209522_213442•
*MAR:	No well that's probably erm  •213442_214302•
*RIC:	no I don't think that's a problem •214302_215232•
*MAR:	no that's not a great consideration  •215232_216282•
*RIC:	I I don't see that as a •216282_217052•
*MAR:	Well I think it's just  •217052_217952•
*RIC:	I mean that could be a short term until she could get herself you know a full time regular post •217952_221872•
*MAR:	It's erm, you know, mostly Carris of course  •222122_224632•
*RIC:	Yeah •225172_225232•
*TER:	I mean I think if they can  •225582_227032•
*MAR:	but she means if they sell their house they'll come down more every year then  •227032_230422•
*TER:	Yes because in the summer I mean you, some time in the, in this next term would be the ideal thing really because that, if she can stay on for the summer term  •230422_236662•
*RIC:	Before September that's right  •236662_238062•
*TER:	erm well most of it I mean she'll be take and erm •238062_240332•

*TER:	Timothy will take his O levels you see during the summer term, well I mean by the end of June he'd of finished those so that  •241822_247142•
*RIC:	September would be the ideal time for erm, you know, to be starting down  •248232_250902•
*TER:	Well July, August I mean any •250902_252142•
*RIC:	Well yeah •252142_252472•

*RIC:	I mean I have gone to the trouble, I have been in to see the planning officer that's dealing with it, erm I've written to every single member of the planning committee, I've written to the Environmental Health who have written back to me saying they offer no objections and there because the smell won't be a problem so I've written them back another stinking letter and saying well erm •764782_784272•
*TER:	Come and live next door •784272_785122•
*RIC:	I, I completely disagree with your thoughts on the fact that there won't be a smell, so much so that the slightest smell if the, if the er proposal gets the go ahead and I shall be on to your office and asking to speak to you personally, to come and  smell  this erm  •785122_801302•
*MAR:	And the rubbish, I mean the, the environmental people  •801302_803822•
*RIC:	Oh they, they say it's all controllable so that I've, I've answered, I haven't just let the Environmental Health wash over me I've actually written back to them again, er I'll be interested to see whether I get a letter back from them, but I phoned up the Council this morning and they're rejecting on two grounds, one is to do with the highway and the sort of the traffic situation coming in there, although the, the authority, the Highway Department aren't objecting to it and the other one is erm, on local environmental issues I think you know that is, is unsuitably, unsuitable environmentally to the area  well I can only say that I'm grateful to the planning, to the planning offices for they're going out on a limb if you like because I think they're on thin ice  erm  and so long as the committee will, will back them up I mean I don't know of what else I could of done as a person •803822_853752•
*TER:	No nothing, I don't think you could of done any more, you got it to committee and, and there's nothing more than you can do than that •853992_858962•
*RIC:	erm, so that if, if they then go to an appeal er, I was talking to this planning officer and I was saying that I think I'll consult them, he said I don't think you'll need to he said, and of what you've done so far is pretty good and I can get access to all the letters that have been written in, in objecting into the into the homes  •859872_877792•
*MAR:	Have a lot of other people written in and objecting? •877792_879132•
*RIC:	I think there's I think there's quite a few and I think this is what swayed it, the fact that they have had erm, I know of at least ten  say ten, there's one, two, three on the other side of the road which is good because Bob  which is another one, so that's four, there's  which is the other side of the shop, is five, there's us, six, Jean seven, the  eight, erm the guy the other side of the  which is nine, there is Ginny  over the and the erm old persons' home, that's ten that I know of for certain about, er and then I've heard of other people were gonna be writing in, now whether they actually did or not I don't know •879132_924262•

*TER:	We would of done the same sort of thing and could of gone in to see the planning officer but I just, I just assumed you know that, that life was fair but of course there's no justice in this life  •935772_942492•
*RIC:	But er, the only, the only, yes, no the only other thing I would of said that you could of perhaps done would be go to to a Local Authority ombudsman •942492_949502•
*TER:	Well I, we went there afterwards •949502_950902•
*RIC:	Did you and what did he say? •950902_952002•
