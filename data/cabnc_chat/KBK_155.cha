*DAV:	You know probably make it a bit easier, but it's not.  (  ) if you watch them people over there. 
*CHR:	 (  ) 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Really, well what'll you call this croquet? 
*DAV:	Croquet Association. 
*CHR:	Association. 
*DAV:	Eh, I don't think  (  ) . 
*CHR:	And they've got two matches going on together have they, they're, they've  different colour balls? 
*DAV:	  (  )  
*CHR:	Oh I see. 
*DAV:	She can't even get the hang of it.  (  ) arrangements. 
*CHR:	Ah. 
*DAV:	Oh well, let's have a game. 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 Let's see how we get on. 
*CHR:	 Yes please. 
*DAV:	 (  ) . You got to have, got to to keep  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes  (  ) . 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	That has been caught  (  ) . 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	Taking the  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yeah, sorry, I was miles away, I'd lost anyway mentally, I mentally I lost. 
*DAV:	Did you? 
*CHR:	Yes, yes. 
*DAV:	 Now I  had the choice of going first, (  ) , so if I choose to go first then you can choose the colours. (  ) . 
*CHR:	 Right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Occasionally you're forced into the other  then you'll, then you'll, down aren't you? 
*DAV:	 Of course you are, you'll just  (  ) .  Erm, as of one, I think   (  ) first. 
*CHR:	Good. 
*DAV:	Erm.  (  ) . During this first hit it's important to get the speed of the lawn, try and judge  where you want the ball to end up to. 
*CHR:	 Right  , right, (  ) . 
*DAV:	 (  ) . That's what I was trying to do, I don't mind if it goes off 
*CHR:	You, oh, right. 
*DAV:	cos I don't think, (  ) . 
*CHR:	Right, right, that was your object to get it as far away from the competition as possible really. 
*DAV:	Well, yeah, (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	Erm, try and get it stop near the  (  ) . 
*CHR:	I see, I see what you mean, yes, yes, yes, yes, yep got you. 
*DAV:	Eh, you can start a game anywhere on this foot   (.) foot-line which is called the   (  ) line, (  ) . One up there. 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	So you, you would normally start here. 
*CHR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	Which  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Right, yep, O K. Rather over muscled, control it better yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) joining up at my thumb. 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	Erm   (  ) quite some distance. 
*CHR:	Quite. 
*DAV:	Cos I wrote, you know that I  (  ) , be very lucky to make it. 
*CHR:	Absolutely, yes. 
*DAV:	Especially at the beginning of the game. 
*CHR:	Yep. 
*DAV:	 (  ) and eh, (  )  (10.0) Ball goes  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) can't see, can't remember what the are balls behind or wha   (.) where they are. 
*CHR:	Yes, fine. 
*DAV:	So   (6.0) just be a touching ball. 
*CHR:	Yes it is. 
*DAV:	Move over to the blue. 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	And you  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) . Yes, you can see when the ball goes off, then   (  ) you'll end up in the far corner. 
*CHR:	Right, right. 
*DAV:	Oh hold on, you've got, you've got a  (  ) , you could have a shot at those  (  ) , but I think at this stage of the game, it'll be best if you did have a shot at the yellow. 
*CHR:	Right. So it, would, would give me some aggression then would it? 
*DAV:	If you hit it, yes. 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) yes, a very good point   (6.0)  ((hits ball)), ah. 
*DAV:	Not bad, I mean   (  ) like that. You need to watch where that goes off, almost certainly  (  )  
*CHR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	comes up a yard  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Right.
