*** 1 (Tape 073801) ***
Jane (PS19L) [1] I think the Labour Party's heart is in the right place, they
             want to take a positive approach and do what they can to help
             industry, to train, to put more money into training youngsters for
             industry then we have a skill work force, not a cheap, not a cheap
             unskilled labour force, er, you know, which is what we, what's
             happening now, because we've just not been trained, they're
             cutting the training, but it's all the same, anyway you know, I,
             I, I don't know, you say what can I do for ya, well er in the
             short run not much except to help the, the people who are on lower
             income and the children through the budget er which will be
             introduced, it'll be that why er through er child benefits and
             through er high, high benefits and through er, er lower taxes for
             the, everybody up to er twenty odd, twenty five thousand year or
             something, so, erm I mean that's in the short run and little that
             can be done, it's not as much as anybody would like, you put more
             and more into, into er, into training, er more money into industry
             to help them to invest, er you know you can have a sort of
             regional development banks to help industry to invest these in, in
             each of the regions, but I mean the, these are the positive plans
             and not like this one who's just letting things go.
John (PS19M) [2] If, if under, if and I hope that your crowd get in, see, I
             think
Jane (PS19L) [3] Yeah
John (PS19M) [4] as I say I'm just fed up with this lot, what is the outlook on
             er income tax?
Jane (PS19L) [5] Well
John (PS19M) [6] Cos I mean we know it's going up whoever gets in they're gonna
             put it up
Jane (PS19L) [7] well you know, John Smith laid out his budget for the next,
             study for the, to cover the next two years and there, I mean
             there's no intention to, to change it in the foreseeable future, I
             mean they've laid it out for two years so that the basic rate
             stays the same, that the personal allowances are being increased
             so that this will take a lot of lower paid people out of tax and
             that coupled with the child benefit will make everybody up to
             about twenty two thousand a year better off, and then from there
             they'll be a, a, a range of people who to it won't make much
             difference
John (PS19M) [8] No
Jane (PS19L) [9] overall certainly if they've got children, but if we get above
             thirty, forty thousand a year, it'll take more the other people
             who've gained so much
John (PS19M) [10] Yeah
Jane (PS19L) [11] out of the last ten years
Jane (PS19L) [12] Yeah, yeah it's not, it's not been fair
John (PS19M) [13] Ooh aye it's not, it's not fair, I agree
Jane (PS19L) [14] and not, not only on income tax but on poll tax local tax
John (PS19M) [15] Yeah, yeah
Jane (PS19L) [16] That's right
John (PS19M) [17] cos I mean that, that's just a joke that
Jane (PS19L) [18] do you think Labour would alter the poll tax and put it back
             to its sort of original sort of rating system?
Jane (PS19L) [19] We're going back to a kind of rating system with the
             different assessment on valuations
Jane (PS19L) [20] Yeah, it's fair int it?
             [21] The bigger the house the more money you should pay.
Jane (PS19L) [22] the Tories are gonna introduce their alternative, but they're
             still going to ... through this banding system, the whole
             objective of that is to, is to make sure that the better off
             people don't pay their full whack
John (PS19M) [23] Mm
Jane (PS19L) [24] instead of paying er, you know, three or four times in a, for
             a big house to, to a very modern poor house
John (PS19M) [25] Yeah
Jane (PS19L) [26] er they only pay sort of one and a half or twice that's the,
             that's the purpose of the Tories
John (PS19M) [27] Well what el what's the other alternative for this VAT? cos I
             mean it was the Tories who brought this VAT system into operation,
             I mean it's wrong
Jane (PS19L) [28] Well
John (PS19M) [29] when you think about it, it's wrong you're paying tax on your
             wages at source and then you go to the shops and you've got to pay
             tax on your goods again
Jane (PS19L) [30] Well I hope that
Jane (PS19L) [31] That's right
John (PS19M) [32] it's totally wrong
Jane (PS19L) [33] when we got a
*** 2 (Tape 073802) ***
Jane (PS19L)                         [34] A taxation system in place which
                                     would be fair, which means that the people
                                     in the big houses pay more, then we can do
                                     something about, maybe making the local
                                     people er pay more and reducing central
                                     taxes, reducing the VAT, it's not gonna be
                                     quick but
John (PS19M)                         [35] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [36] there's, there's no commitment to
                                     reduce VAT in the, in the Labour
                                     manifesto, but I mean er that will be the
                                     spirit of what we wanna do to make the
                                     people
John (PS19M)                         [37] I hope you can, I hope you can do
                                     something with it, because being truthful
                                     I just, it's just
Jane (PS19L)                         [38] I'm just warming my hands, it's cold
                                     outside

John (PS19M)                         [40] it's just
Jane (PS19L)                         [41] anyway I'd better press on
John (PS19M)                         [42] it's just a joke what they do
Jane (PS19L)                         [43] He'll have you here all night [laugh]

Jane (PS19L)                         [243] He's not been too bad but I tried to

                                     having to bring him downstairs, give him
                                     his lunch first and then I put him to
                                     sleep in his pram ... this is all since

John (PS19M)                         [247] Did he get you up last night?
Jane (PS19L)                         [248] Er ... what time was it?

                                     sleep again, it was about ten to eight
                                     before I finally got up.
John (PS19M)                         [252] And then the kids have gotta get up.

                                     that came in and set him off ... she
                                     should've just left him on to it instead

Unknown speaker (KCGPSUNK) [420] Shall I tell ya?
Jane (PS19L)               [421] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KCGPSUNK) [422] Because we forgot to do, we forgot to do the
                           spelling test last Friday, so we had to do it on
                           Monday so we didn't get any spelling this week, so
                           right now we didn't have a spelling test, this is
                           brilliant, guess what we do now?
Jane (PS19L)               [423] What?
Unknown speaker (KCGPSUNK) [424] Table test.
Jane (PS19L)               [425] That's probably why you haven't got a spelling
                           test.
Unknown speaker (KCGPSUNK) [426] No it isn't we, we have, on Monday we had a
                           spelling test and a table test, but the table was
                           quite easy.
Jane (PS19L)               [427] Have you been practising?
Unknown speaker (KCGPSUNK) [428] We don't need to we've already done them.
Jane (PS19L)               [429] You know them that well you can be cocky about
                           it?
Unknown speaker (KCGPSUNK) [430] No not cocky, but I know them.
Jane (PS19L)               [431] So you know them

                           right?

                           twenty in, with twenty in each one

                           it'd have two Os wouldn't it?
                           [445] Hoop, has it got two Os?

                                     you saying it's quite a biggish house, I
                                     said erm, does she need it like so she
                                     said yeah because the two kids are in one
                                     bedroom.
Madge (PS19R)                        [565] Who's this, our Glen?
Margaret (PS19S)                     [566] Mm ... well she's having another
                                     bedroom which make it four bedrooms.
Madge (PS19R)                        [567] Yeah.
Margaret (PS19S)                     [568] Oh it looks lovely, you know the,
                                     how the architect has done it from
Madge (PS19R)                        [569] Yeah.
Margaret (PS19S)                     [570] the front, the side and the back ...

Madge (PS19R)                        [571] It'll be very nice Margaret when
                                     it's done.
Margaret (PS19S)                     [572] it was only with your mum saying it
                                     was quite a biggish house anyway
Madge (PS19R)                        [573] Well it is, I think she's just, she
                                     wanted to, to do a bigger third bedroom
Margaret (PS19S)                     [574] Mm
Madge (PS19R)                        [575] and she's had this bloke round and I
                                     think he's
Margaret (PS19S)                     [576] and they've taught her
Madge (PS19R)                        [577] he's recommended to her that instead
                                     of making the third bedroom bigger, to
                                     make four bedrooms because it would
                                     increase the value of the house more.
Chris (PS19P)                        [578] The house
Margaret (PS19S)                     [579] I mean anybody else would of made do
                                     with a little bedroom, I mean it's big
                                     enough to get a bed and a dressing table
                                     and what in, and it's bigger, it's a lot
                                     bigger than mine
Madge (PS19R)                        [580] What I suppose she thinks is if she
                                     can afford to do it, do it.
Chris (PS19P)                        [581] Who's this?
Madge (PS19R)                        [582] Pam,
Margaret (PS19S)                     [583] Pam.
Madge (PS19R)                        [584] she's had all her plans done for her

Chris (PS19P)                        [585] Has she?
Madge (PS19R)                        [586] extension, this bloke come round ...

Margaret (PS19S)                     [587] Come on pop what you doing, where's
                                     your [...] ?
Chris (PS19P)                        [588] This is for the son's bedroom?
Madge (PS19R)                        [589] Well it, when he, she originally
                                     wanted him to do plans to make the third
                                     bedroom bigger which would of been like an
                                     L shaped bedroom
Chris (PS19P)                        [590] Mm.
Madge (PS19R)                        [591] but he recommended to her to
                                     actually make it into a fourth bedroom
                                     because it would increase the value of the
                                     house
Chris (PS19P)                        [592] Yeah.
Madge (PS19R)                        [593] and also
Chris (PS19P)                        [594] So where they gonna put the, the
                                     other bedroom?
Margaret (PS19S)                     [595] At the side.
Madge (PS19R)                        [596] At the side, so, but she's not
                                     having a garage or anything at the side,
                                     she's having a side extension down below,
                                     but the front bit she's having made into a
                                     shower room and then the back bit it's
                                     gonna be like a morning room to the
                                     kitchen
Chris (PS19P)                        [597] Oh right.
Madge (PS19R)                        [598] like where you go in the kitchen you
                                     turn right, like that one of mine over
                                     there, the sink's there on the right hand
                                     side
Chris (PS19P)                        [599] Yeah.
Madge (PS19R)                        [600] well she's gonna have that knocked
                                     into an archway through to a dining room
Chris (PS19P)                        [601] Oh right, lovely.
Madge (PS19R)                        [602] so it'll be lovely
Chris (PS19P)                        [603] Mm.
Madge (PS19R)                        [604] but erm, she just get
Jane (PS19L)                         [605] So the third bedroom would go right
                                     across that extension then?
Madge (PS19R)                        [606] Yeah well that'll be their bedroom
Jane (PS19L)                         [607] That'll be the fourth fourth
                                     bedroom?
Madge (PS19R)                        [608] Well it'll be such a big room, she
                                     said it'll be, oh I don't know what she
                                     said about sixteen by twelve or summat
                                     like that
Jane (PS19L)                         [609] Yeah be lovely.
Madge (PS19R)                        [610] so her and Ma Malcolm are gonna have
                                     that and Emma will have the front bedroom
Chris (PS19P)                        [611] Come on Michael, come on.
Madge (PS19R)                        [612] and then there be the third little
                                     bedroom in the middle which Pam has as a
                                     sewing room
Jane (PS19L)                         [613] Yeah.

                                     don't she?
Group of unknown speakers (KCGPSUGP) [...]
Jane (PS19L)                         [615] A good idea to have a toy room like
                                     that.
Madge (PS19R)                        [616] It is really.
Jane (PS19L)                         [617] Yeah, it's great if you've got the
                                     room on the side to do it.
Group of unknown speakers (KCGPSUGP) [...]
Madge (PS19R)                        [618] with her being in a corner Jane

                                     and the house here, it's been extended on
                                     the side, but it won't bring it anywhere
                                     near Pam's extension
Jane (PS19L)                         [621] No.
Madge (PS19R)                        [622] because it's in the corner

                                     it's bloody massive.

Madge (PS19R)                        [638] Ordinary rateable value
Chris (PS19P)                        [639] Yeah sort of more or less

                                     he said do you think it was an error of
                                     judgment and he was trying to get Kinnock
                                     to say yes and he said yes it was an error
                                     of judgment the way he, he'd sort of said
                                     I think he must of said in the mid
                                     seventies, that if he got in power he'd
                                     get rid of all nuclear weapons

                                     had to then mess about and try and get him
                                     to sleep, which apparently she did
Madge (PS19R)                        [837] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [838] but he must of been all worked up
                                     and since then I've had a right struggle,
                                     most nights
Madge (PS19R)                        [839] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [840] I've had to go back up in to him,
                                     yeah, but I don't know what happened last
                                     night, I don't know whether he was not
                                     quite tired enough, erm, he must of got up
                                     as soon as I put him down and started sort
                                     of moaning then I went into the girls and
                                     I sorted them out he started screaming he
                                     did, so I had to go to him in and lay him
                                     down and making him lay down
Madge (PS19R)                        [841] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [842] and he was starting sobbing and he
                                     got that upset, in the end
Madge (PS19R)                        [843] He started screaming.
Jane (PS19L)                         [844] you know real, I've never heard him
                                     do that before.
Margaret (PS19S)                     [845] Aye, they can do that sobbing.
Madge (PS19R)                        [846] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [847] So erm, anyway I went back in to
                                     him, I kept going up and down, I left him
                                     for a while, but he doesn't normally cry
                                     like that

Jane (PS19L)                         [851] eventually I went up and I tried to
                                     get him to go down to sleep again, and he
                                     was shutting his eyes and on his dummy,
                                     but he was [laugh]
Madge (PS19R)                        [852] If they get that worked up, they
                                     can't calm down can they?

Jane (PS19L)                         [855] so I thought I couldn't, I couldn't
                                     let him go to
Madge (PS19R)                        [856] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [857] sleep while he was like that so I
                                     picked him up and took him back downstairs
                                     again,

                                     well that it's a bit lighter Jane, cos I

Jane (PS19L)                         [862] Yeah I don't
Chris (PS19P)                        [863] you know she moans, somebody
                                     suggested if you've got a curtain and
                                     you've got like you, a liner behind it
Jane (PS19L)                         [864] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [865] to fasten a black bin bag
Jane (PS19L)                         [866] Oh yeah, yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [867] between the curtain and the liner
Jane (PS19L)                         [868] Yeah I put a [...] over his
Chris (PS19P)                        [869] and it completely blacks over it was
                                     dark
Jane (PS19L)                         [870] when it was dark
Chris (PS19P)                        [871] but no, you know it does start
                                     getting lighter and you're gonna have
                                     problems then, you might try that cos you
                                     could, you've got liners on them curtains
                                     haven't ya?
Jane (PS19L)                         [872] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [873] Open up er, er a, a bin liner and
                                     pin it in between the two
Jane (PS19L)                         [874] In between the two.
Madge (PS19R)                        [875] Oh that's a good idea.
Chris (PS19P)                        [876] so it's completely black.
Jane (PS19L)                         [877] Blacks it out.
Chris (PS19P)                        [878] Blacks it out.
Jane (PS19L)                         [879] It is a good idea.
Chris (PS19P)                        [880] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [881] I didn't, it was so cold yesterday,
                                     we'd been out in the morning and I decided
                                     to put him in his cot, on the odd occasion
                                     I do, do, he's gone to sleep without any
                                     problems
Chris (PS19P)                        [882] Mm.
Jane (PS19L)                         [883] but yesterday morn he was, yesterday
                                     morning he started crying didn't he, I
                                     didn't leave him for any length of time
Chris (PS19P)                        [884] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [885] I brought him downstairs give him
                                     his dinner and then I put him to sleep in
                                     his pram in the front room, but I think
                                     that'd also er
Chris (PS19P)                        [886] Yeah, yeah.
Madge (PS19R)                        [887] Upset him.
Jane (PS19L)                         [888] so I just hope, it's so annoying
                                     though, you'd just give him a cuddle, lay
                                     him down and that was it, that was all
Madge (PS19R)                        [889] I know, so I mean the thing is that
                                     we've always said haven't ya as long as
                                     you can sort of get 'em down
Jane (PS19L)                         [890] Mm.

Margaret (PS19S)                     [893] at least you've got some free time.
Madge (PS19R)                        [894] on your own, you can cope with
                                     waking up in the night can't ya?
Jane (PS19L)                         [895] Ten o'clock before I put him
                                     upstairs.
Madge (PS19R)                        [896] Yeah.
Margaret (PS19S)                     [897] Cos you lose your patience.
Madge (PS19R)                        [898] What was wrong with ya?
Chris (PS19P)                        [899] Oh she's so calm.
Jane (PS19L)                         [900] No I'm not too bad really.

Chris (PS19P)                        [902] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [903] cos he's throwing a wobbly at the
                                     cot, he's thrown all his dummies out and
                                     Stacey comes out the door, I just wanted
                                     to leave him cos he's just, before he was
                                     ready and that
Margaret (PS19S)                     [904] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [905] I was up there, stood on the landing
                                     where he couldn't hear me and couldn't see
                                     me I was
Margaret (PS19S)                     [906] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [907] sort of just waiting to see what he
                                     was gonna do and then Stacey comes out, I
                                     can't sleep and I said get back in

                                     works in Woolworths?
Jane (PS19L)                         [911] Yeah, yeah.
Madge (PS19R)                        [912] They've had him from the Wednesday,
                                     was it the Wed er, no from the Saturday to
                                     the Wednesday cos she was working and they
                                     took him on to seaside somewhere and when
                                     come home, he's having stitches in his
                                     head where he'd fell, he hit it on the
                                     stone or summat and I said oh did he enjoy
                                     it apart from that, she said he was a
                                     swine last night, he was screaming and
                                     hitting me and she called her husband down
                                     from work, she couldn't control him, said
                                     she should of smacked his arse and put him
                                     in the cot.
Chris (PS19P)                        [913] Mind you I've heard them shouting at
                                     him.
Margaret (PS19S)                     [914] Oh it's awful.
Jane (PS19L)                         [915] How old is he?
Madge (PS19R)                        [916] He was two last Christmas, he's
                                     lovely an'all, but you see it doesn't take
                                     much to get out of a routine.
Jane (PS19L)                         [917] It does come nice after Christmas,
                                     Christmas it got him all out of plonk
Margaret (PS19S)                     [918] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [919] cos you know he was that shattered
                                     he was falling asleep downstairs before I
                                     put him in his cot, so it was a case then
                                     of putting him to sleep in his cot
Margaret (PS19S)                     [920] Mm.
Jane (PS19L)                         [921] and even in the middle of the night

                                     disturbed a bit, I just used to shout to
                                     him
Margaret (PS19S)                     [922] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [923] lay down and go back to sleep and,
                                     sometimes he would.

                                     gone into detail about it, I think it
                                     might be actually because it's er you,
                                     you've got two things
Margaret (PS19S)                     [990] When you open the front door

Margaret (PS19S)                     [993] Now, if you go through the door
                                     you've got so many seconds to get to the
                                     box to turn it off.
Madge (PS19R)                        [994] That's right, yeah.

                                     about half an hour before Mike rang up, so
                                     he said I've got to get me secretary to

Chris (PS19P)                        [1250] Well he said Mike must have said,
                                     what has been holding it up if I, we were
                                     under the impression that when she left
                                     London, she was finished with her property

Jane (PS19L)                         [1251] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1252] cos it was put in the hands of

Chris (PS19P)                        [1256] well seemingly it must be as simple
                                     as that
Jane (PS19L)                         [1257] No.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1258] so she's been dealing with her
                                     Manchester solicitors and a London
                                     solicitor

Chris (PS19P)                        [1260] so this is what's been holding
                                     everything up.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1261] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1262] So Mike must, said to him well, the

Chris (PS19P)                        [1264] so he said you don't have to move
                                     on a Friday cos Mike said well do we have
                                     to move Friday?
                                     [1265] So he said oh no you can choose any
                                     day of the week.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1266] That's right, yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1267] I suppose it's mutual agreement?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1268] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1269] I mean we'll move any day, but it's
                                     whether Miss will you see
Jane (PS19L)                         [1270] Yeah, the only reason most people
                                     choose a Friday is because they get you
                                     over the weekend
Chris (PS19P)                        [1271] They get you over the weekend yeah,
                                     so erm, we'll just have to see what
                                     happens and have, just have the contracts
                                     out.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1272] Yeah, it should be a week then,
                                     shouldn't it?
Chris (PS19P)                        [1273] Hopefully, er what did you say five
                                     working days?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1274] It's normally five working days,
                                     yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1275] Mm, mm, you see, cos even if we
                                     sort of made it for like the middle of
                                     next week, er, no not next week, the week
                                     after
Jane (PS19L)                         [1276] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1277] would bring us like the Wednesday,
                                     that would be my birthday actually the
                                     Wednesday
Jane (PS19L)                         [1278] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1279] but it'll make it Easter weekend
Jane (PS19L)                         [1280] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1281] we'll, we wouldn't mind, I wouldn't
                                     mind doing that
Jane (PS19L)                         [1282] No.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1283] because it'd give Mike an extra few
                                     days anyway, could actually have
Jane (PS19L)                         [1284] Get settled.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1285] the Wednesday off ... and all the
                                     following week
Jane (PS19L)                         [1286] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1287] which would give him a good break
                                     really to get a few things done.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1288] Yeah.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1289] Well it'll all be
Chris (PS19P)                        [1290] I'm not doing any, I'm, I'm, all
                                     this bloody panicking about getting a
                                     flaming gas fire sorted out and getting a
                                     carpet done, I'm not, not bothering, we'll
                                     just have to rough it for a while.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1291] Let 'em rough it for a week.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1292] Mm, we'll rough it for a while,
                                     because I know the downers, the only thing
                                     that Mike wants to do is put the fence and
                                     the gate up the side
Jane (PS19L)                         [1293] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1294] which Don said we could do
Jane (PS19L)                         [1295] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1296] to sort the dog out really
Jane (PS19L)                         [1297] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1298] but everything else we can sort,
                                     getting there, it's not as if we're gonna
                                     need a bloody fire is it Jane?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1299] Not really.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1300] I mean do you find you, you use
                                     your fire more?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1301] We have been doing over the past
                                     few nights
Chris (PS19P)                        [1302] Have ya?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1303] because I've been turning the
                                     heating, it's the
Chris (PS19P)                        [1304] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1305] I don't know, from tea time it
                                     seems to warm up the house
Chris (PS19P)                        [1306] Mm.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1307] and it's boiling hot
Chris (PS19P)                        [1308] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1309] from sort of eight o'clock so I
                                     could
Chris (PS19P)                        [1310] Then it cools off
Jane (PS19L)                         [1311] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1312] don't it?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1313] So I just put it on just to tick
Chris (PS19P)                        [1314] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1315] the room over really ... but I mean
                                     if you can keep your heating on for that
                                     little bit of length of time
Chris (PS19P)                        [1316] Mm, that's what I'll do I don't
                                     think we'll use the fire that much, I mean
                                     we, I, did I put it on?
                                     [1317] No I didn't put it on last night,
                                     but I did leave me heating on, it clicks
                                     off at nine o'clock, but the house was
                                     warm
Jane (PS19L)                         [1318] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1319] and we went to bed anyway
Jane (PS19L)                         [1320] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1321] just gone ten.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1322] That's what, I mean we used to turn
                                     ours off of about nine, half nine and like
                                     you say it just used to tick
Chris (PS19P)                        [1323] Mm.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1324] over till about eleven, you could
                                     just feel it cooling down
Chris (PS19P)                        [1325] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1326] but, because I've been knocking it
                                     off that bit earlier
Chris (PS19P)                        [1327] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1328] sort of five minutes
Chris (PS19P)                        [1329] And how have you fi I think we're
                                     gonna end up like with a fire like yours
                                     to be honest, because we don't want to
                                     alter that fireplace if we can help it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1330] No, it's ever so nice.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1331] because we do like it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1332] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1333] and we thought well one night, I
                                     mean it's a bloody big radiator in that
                                     room
Jane (PS19L)                         [1334] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1335] which I think would be enough
Jane (PS19L)                         [1336] You wouldn't you'd probably find
                                     that you would use it half a dozen times
                                     through the year.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1337] Yeah, yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1338] No I won't get rid of mine.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1339] Have you sort of not, I suppose you
                                     haven't found out money- wise what it's
                                     costing ya?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1340] No, not really I should imagine
                                     it's not, I don't know you see, we don't,
                                     we'd of had the heating on anyway
Chris (PS19P)                        [1341] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1342] so I don't suppose it's cost us any
                                     more
Chris (PS19P)                        [1343] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1344] because we've hardly had it on.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1345] Mm.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1346] Still you
Chris (PS19P)                        [1347] You do find it warm don't ya?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1348] I do, yeah,
Chris (PS19P)                        [1349] Have you got a couple of settings
                                     on yours is it a high and a low?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1350] Well I've just got high and low
                                     that's all.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1351] But I mean it'll give you er a
                                     wattage er, whatever it is
Jane (PS19L)                         [1352] Yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [1353] it pumps out anyway?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1354] well I suppose so, I don't know
                                     what we've got.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1355] The
Group of unknown speakers (KCGPSUGP) [...]
Chris (PS19P)                        [1356] yeah, because as I say something
                                     like what Jane's got would fit in that
                                     fireplace, just right
Jane (PS19L)                         [1357] Mm.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1358] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1359] which like I say saw one up at erm
                                     ... I told you that fireplace shop on the
                                     corner, mind you I think we'll get Edwards
                                     in, he had some in about a hundred and
                                     sixty quid or so
Jane (PS19L)                         [1360] You should start looking round.
Group of unknown speakers (KCGPSUGP) [...]
Chris (PS19P)                        [1361] erm I mean really ideally Mike
                                     would like one of those that actually fits
                                     perfectly
Jane (PS19L)                         [1362] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1363] in, in the fireplace
Jane (PS19L)                         [1364] I know what you mean.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1365] and it's got a back to it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1366] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1367] and it sort of throws the heat out
                                     into the room.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1368] Yeah, yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1369] Well I could, it could, it wouldn't
                                     justify it.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1370] But Chris I can't see them I can't
                                     see them making a fire like that that your
                                     heat's gonna go all up the chimney, no
                                     way.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1371] No, but what I'm saying is
Jane (PS19L)                         [1372] Josh come on
Chris (PS19P)                        [1373] if there wasn't
Jane (PS19L)                         [1374] come on Josh, Josh
Chris (PS19P)                        [1375] if there wasn't a good amount of
                                     radiator in that room
Jane (PS19L)                         [1376] Josh
Chris (PS19P)                        [1377] it would justify having a fire like
                                     that
Madge (PS19R)                        [1378] Come on
Jane (PS19L)                         [1379] Yeah, yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1380] but because it's got such a good
Madge (PS19R)                        [1381] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1382] Radiator.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1383] you know cos I told you Mike
                                     actually fancies one of these that
                                     actually fits right in the fireplace
Jane (PS19L)                         [1384] I know what you mean next door
Chris (PS19P)                        [1385] and there's a backing to it and it
                                     pumps it out into the room, they're dead
                                     hot
Jane (PS19L)                         [1386] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1387] but I don't think this room needs
                                     it Jane.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1388] No.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1389] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1390] I think it'll be a waste, and I
                                     don't want to go to the expense of
Jane (PS19L)                         [1391] Well they are bloody expensive.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1392] because
Madge (PS19R)                        [1393] It slipped [laugh]
Chris (PS19P)                        [1394] I think the fires are about three
                                     hundred quid
Jane (PS19L)                         [1395] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1396] but it's not that, you'd have to
                                     have a lot of the fireplace ripped up.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1397] Mm you would
Chris (PS19P)                        [1398] Yeah.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1399] it's only a little square.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1400] Yeah, we'd have to have the pillars
                                     taken off
Jane (PS19L)                         [1401] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1402] and everything like that, so all
                                     that would have to be redecorated.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1403] Whereas like that one of ours, it'd
                                     be ideal wouldn't it?
Chris (PS19P)                        [1404] It be it just work right
Jane (PS19L)                         [1405] Must have your chimney swept.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1406] That's what I want to get that
                                     number off you for that as well because I
                                     some [...] would suggest anyway
Jane (PS19L)                         [1407] I got it somewhere yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1408] wouldn't he?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1409] I got it somewhere, I'll root it
                                     out for ya and I forgot to see Hilda about
                                     that
Madge (PS19R)                        [1410] Michael shout Mike
Chris (PS19P)                        [1411] There's no rush for it.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1412] Michael shout louder
Jane (PS19L)                         [1413] she's gone on holiday now.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1414] you know, some time
Jane (PS19L)                         [1415] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1416] if you think about it.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1417] Mike
Jane (PS19L)                         [1418] Funny enough I saw her yesterday
Madge (PS19R)                        [1419] in a minute or two
Group of unknown speakers (KCGPSUGP) [...]
Jane (PS19L)                         [1420] and she started talking about
                                     putting the freezer in the back garden
Bill (PS19T)                         [1421] Is it worth my taking a coat on?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1422] and that
Chris (PS19P)                        [1423] Oh.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1424] and it just slipped my mind.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1425] Well just any time, we won't be
                                     doing nothing until the end of May anyway.
Madge (PS19R)                        [1426] Michael, Michael shout Mike
Jane (PS19L)                         [1427] As soon as she comes back I promise
                                     I'll ask her
Madge (PS19R)                        [1428] Mike, shout Mike, Mike
Chris (PS19P)                        [1429] But what would you, see Edward said

Madge (PS19R)                        [1430] shout Chris
Chris (PS19P)                        [1431] when we decided we want something
                                     he'll come down and
Jane (PS19L)                         [1432] Be careful
Chris (PS19P)                        [1433] sort it all out.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1434] sort it out
Madge (PS19R)                        [1435] shout Chris
Chris (PS19P)                        [1436] Hopefully we can get away with that
                                     room Jane with just maybe having to
                                     emulsion it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1437] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1438] because I mean once you've taken
                                     all the pictures down, I think it did need
                                     it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1439] She's a smoker int she?
                                     [1440] That's
Chris (PS19P)                        [1441] very much.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1442] Yeah that'll be your main thing
                                     then.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1443] Rather than decorate I think we'll
                                     just
Jane (PS19L)                         [1444] Paint it.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1445] er emulsion over it and maybe put a
                                     border around the picture frames.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1446] This is in the back room?
Chris (PS19P)                        [1447] Front room.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1448] Mm.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1449] Yeah, leave the front room, we'll
                                     have to, first week or so we'll have to
                                     live in that back room
Jane (PS19L)                         [1450] Yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [1451] until we've got [...]
Madge (PS19R)                        [laugh] ...

                                     [1567] Instead of letting John's mum do
                                     it, consequently he got dead upset so
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1568] Oh

                                     say night-night and that was it
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1571] So why did it disturb him with
                                     Deana?

Lynn (PS19U)                         [1582] Last night I got really upset, I
                                     did in bed and erm ... he kept saying
                                     what's the matter?
                                     [1583] What's the matter?

                                     housing [...] with the car and everything.
Jane (PS19L)                         [1588] Is it, is he, is that right, is
                                     somebody coming down to value the house?
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1589] No, just coming back home to show
                                     me the flaming car, and that's what sa I
                                     didn't [...] but I feel dead awful really,
                                     but I didn't jump up and down
Jane (PS19L)                         [1590] I'm not surprised, I'd have done me
                                     fruit, if I was going around with somebody
                                     that, that say they're gonna put the house

                                     in cuckoo land, I mean when are you ever
                                     gonna feel secure with somebody like that?
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1595] Never
Jane (PS19L)                         [1596] You can't can ya? ...

Jane (PS19L)                         [1598] Yeah there might be ...
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1599] Well thanks that was beautiful tea,
                                     [...] sort of ready for it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1600] I'm not surprised with all that
                                     dashing around, he asks such a lot of you
                                     Lynn and I can't understand why he's like
                                     that when he says he loves you and
                                     everything, and he wants
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1601] I know [...] I don't know why I'm

                                     and then
Jane (PS19L)                         [1602] I don't know he's gonna come a
                                     right bloody cropper
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1603] I keep burning [...] , I bet I
                                     didn't, I thought, pardon me, positive ...
                                     mm I popped round, I went in yesterday
                                     [...] I'm going to say something [...] and
                                     then he's going on about well I've sold me
                                     car to pay the mortgage and
Jane (PS19L)                         [1604] And then all he tells you is a pack
                                     of bloody lies
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1605] I know
Jane (PS19L)                         [1606] if he can lie that bloody easily
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1607] well he, he said he, he wanted it
                                     as a surprise well it's not a surprise for
                                     me is it?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1608] Yeah, but he knew you wasn't
Lynn (PS19U)                         [laugh]
Jane (PS19L)                         [1609] you wasn't keen on the idea anyway
                                     didn't he?
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1610] Well that's right, yeah, cos then
                                     he asked me ages ago did I think he was
                                     being selfish, I said yes
Jane (PS19L)                         [1611] Mm
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1612] I said, but like you tell me it's
                                     your life, mm

                                     [1615] Not, you know, and I said okay?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1616] It's going to be his baby when it's

                                     and everything and it was a sunny day and
                                     I went outside with me bucket and me felt
                                     and me scrubbing brush
Jane (PS19L)                         [1637] Yeah
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1638] and I just, I threw buckets of
                                     water on it to rinse it, and it dried
                                     because it was really warm and it came up
                                     like new
Jane (PS19L)                         [1639] Came up like new
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1640] cos you can have a real good go at
                                     the wheels that way outside
Jane (PS19L)                         [1641] Yeah, outside, it's like my pram, I
                                     mean, I was, Stacey was going in hospital
                                     last year to have her adeno adenoids out
                                     and Sue was having him and I thought well,
                                     he was too big for his carrycot, but take
                                     the pram down and he's got nothing to
                                     sleep in ... and er, I put him in it, it
                                     been six months since it was do well since
                                     he started using it, so I give that a good
                                     going over and the pram wheels come up
                                     lovely
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1642] I know

                                     not been done since, so when the next good
                                     bit of weather, I've got to get the
                                     pushchair out and give that a good going
                                     over
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1646] And do that
Jane (PS19L)                         [1647] and me pram as well
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1648] I know, I fancied a big pram, but
                                     there you go ...
Jane (PS19L)                         [1649] Well it's, whether you've really
                                     got somewhere to put it really that's the
                                     top and bottom of it
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1650] Well there's nowhere to walk to
                                     now, is there, you know [...]
Jane (PS19L)                         [1651] Well where would you, mind you I
                                     suppose like in the olden days you could
                                     only get big prams, they just had them in
                                     the living room didn't they?
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1652] Yeah, well it'd just have to go in
                                     the hall, but, no, this will be better,

                                     because I said the bedding had been lo in
                                     the loft

                                     they might have gone funny, but I doubt it
                                     ... they've not been up there that long
                                     really only about two

                                     kid to be honest
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1714] They do another sort and that's

                                     similar texture, but it's a different
                                     taste, it's got walnuts on the, bit on the
                                     top

Lynn (PS19U)                         [1729] It's like looking at another planet
                                     to a man
Jane (PS19L)                         [1730] that's right ... what's that?

Jane (PS19L)                         [1733] Yes it is, I'll have to dig that
                                     [...]
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1734] Ah

                                     I don't mind these erm almond slices, I
                                     quite like them, but I think it must be
                                     the texture of the marzipan
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1736] Mm, I love it, they do erm, German
                                     erm marzipan bar, chocolate bar

Lynn (PS19U)                         [1740] I did it in the sixth form, it's
                                     really hard, it takes ages
Jane (PS19L)                         [1741] Does it?
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1742] That's why I would think, it's
                                     ground almonds they're expensive
Jane (PS19L)                         [1743] That's right, yeah
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1744] it, and it doesn't taste anything
                                     like, I mean this'll be probably be home,
                                     nearest to homemade, but that
Jane (PS19L)                         [1745] Mm
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1746] bright yellow stuff it doesn't
                                     taste like that at all
Jane (PS19L)                         [1747] No
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1748] it's, sort of very more of
Jane (PS19L)                         [1749] Here
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1750] a subtle taste, you know it [...]
                                     need loads of ground almonds
Jane (PS19L)                         [1751] Mm
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1752] just to make a small ... oh ...
Jane (PS19L)                         [1753] That come off rather easily, would
                                     you like my marzipan?
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1754] Hmm, well leave it there and I'll
                                     see how I go, cos I've had one carrot and
                                     I, sort of like, I had your carrot and I'm
                                     putting mine [...] ... quite rich though
                                     that's the thing, I quite like that bit
                                     there cos that's like brown sugar ... erm
Jane (PS19L)                         [1755] It's lovely
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1756] Carl started me on this, he was
                                     into carrot cake for years and
Jane (PS19L)                         [1757] Yeah?
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1758] mm ... and it's similar to a cake
                                     we used to have when he used to love erm
                                     [...] when we were engaged he introduced
                                     [...]
Jane (PS19L)                         [1759] That's another name for it int it
                                     apparently
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1760] Oh is it oh it was the same, but it
                                     was taller, and that sort of buttery cream
                                     that was all on top and that had nuts and
                                     things
Jane (PS19L)                         [1761] Mm
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1762] rather than
Jane (PS19L)                         [1763] we had, I told you, at this meal we
                                     went to, on Saturday they had erm carrot
                                     cake, but that was completely covered in
                                     like this cream cheese
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1764] Mm sounds nice, mm
Jane (PS19L)                         [1765] it was gorgeous but Chris was
                                     saying that Tescos do one, but they call
                                     it passion cake which is the same thing
Lynn (PS19U)                         [1766] Oh the same, mm ...

                                     [1862] Cos you can only use them up to
                                     about four I would think cos other, other
                                     than that they get a bit too big for them
                                     don't they? ... [clears throat] he could
                                     do with a little slide in the garden ...
Group of unknown speakers (KCGPSUGP) [...]

Jane (PS19L)                         [1864] I'd like to get it sorted out a bit
                                     for him really before the summer starts
Mary (PS19V)                         [1865] It'll be ideal
Jane (PS19L)                         [1866] Mm
Mary (PS19V)                         [1867] if you can just fasten him in the
                                     back it'll be smashing won't it?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1868] Well there's the gate, he can only
                                     go so far with the gate anyway, so it
                                     won't really matter ... yeah [clears
                                     throat] yeah ... you ought to see all the
                                     pegs at the back of me fridge ...
Mary (PS19V)                         [1869] Go and watch daddy [...] bring the
                                     tree down?
                                     [1870] Watch it Michael, it's coming ...
                                     yeah, oh you have got hiccups?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1871] He's had them quite a bit these
                                     last few days [...] , they seem to come
                                     like that don't they?
Mary (PS19V)                         [1872] Mm
Jane (PS19L)                         [1873] Then he'll go a month probably
                                     [...]
Mary (PS19V)                         [1874] there we are it's down
Jane (PS19L)                         [1875] Oh, fence nearly came with it
                                     [laugh] ...
Mary (PS19V)                         [1876] it'll seem funny won't it to see
                                     that tree down?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1877] I do think it's lightened this room
                                     up though when you think it [...] gone
Mary (PS19V)                         [1878] Yeah I mean it's better when you
                                     took that one from down there wasn't it?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1879] Oh yeah
Mary (PS19V)                         [1880] Yeah ...
Jane (PS19L)                         [1881] yeah ... the only thing about
                                     having those others of course you can see
                                     through the windows, but there's not a lot
                                     you can do about that.
                                     [1882] ... John had a word with the bloke
                                     across the back there
Mary (PS19V)                         [1883] Oh did he?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1884] about, you know the garage?
Mary (PS19V)                         [1885] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [1886] So he said he'd got no objections
                                     to John moving it back
Mary (PS19V)                         [1887] Oh well ... mm
Jane (PS19L)                         [1888] we'll probably end up doing a bit
                                     to the garden this year as opposed to er
                                     ... you know going to, we were gonna go
                                     down to Somerset in June weren't we?
Mary (PS19V)                         [1889] Mm
Jane (PS19L)                         [1890] But that, with things as they are
                                     we might as well just hang fire
Mary (PS19V)                         [1891] Well, it's no use spending money
                                     you haven't got is it?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1892] No, well the thing is I mean you're
                                     talking of five or six hundred pounds
Mary (PS19V)                         [1893] This is it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1894] and if you can't replace it ... I
                                     mean we've booked, we've booked through,
                                     erm,Au August anyway, we're definitely
                                     going in August to Southport
Mary (PS19V)                         [1895] and it might be a little bit
                                     cheaper for yourself than going all that
                                     way, it certainly won't, it certainly
                                     won't cost you as much to get there anyway

Jane (PS19L)                         [1896] No, well that's it int it? ... so
                                     ... [clears throat] ... er if things are
                                     reasonable we might just go away for a
                                     long weekend or something, go find us a
                                     place in Southport for a weekend
Mary (PS19V)                         [1897] Yeah ...
Jane (PS19L)                         [1898] but really I mean you need the odd
                                     week at home don't you really to sort of
                                     do bits to it, you can't work and do it
Mary (PS19V)                         [1899] Well I mean I'm not going away this
                                     year, but it's not really bothered me an
                                     awful lot
Jane (PS19L)                         [1900] No no
Mary (PS19V)                         [1901] so
Jane (PS19L)                         [1902] you can't
Mary (PS19V)                         [1903] [...] gone to erm, oh I think I
                                     told you didn't I?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1904] Yeah
Mary (PS19V)                         [1905] Gone to Windsor today
Jane (PS19L)                         [1906] that's right
Mary (PS19V)                         [1907] and a day Eastbourne tomorrow, now
                                     that's a nice little break
Jane (PS19L)                         [1908] Mm
Mary (PS19V)                         [1909] just, just a few hours like that
Jane (PS19L)                         [1910] yeah ...
Mary (PS19V)                         [1911] [...] see some places you see go
                                     from Friday to Monday don't they?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1912] That's alright, I think that's
                                     ideal
Mary (PS19V)                         [1913] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [1914] I think it's a good time to spend
                                     in the garden to be honest, I mean you
                                     can't, you can't, it's not really long
                                     enough to try and do it at weekends, not
                                     if he wants to move that garage back,
                                     it'll probably take the best part of the
                                     week to sort that out
Mary (PS19V)                         [1915] Oh it will yeah, cos you've got to
                                     empty it and
Jane (PS19L)                         [1916] That's right
Mary (PS19V)                         [1917] move your swing haven't ya and
Jane (PS19L)                         [1918] yeah
Mary (PS19V)                         [1919] everything, yeah and prepare the
                                     ground
Jane (PS19L)                         [1920] Yeah I don't know whether that
                                     swing will end up going to the tip if it
                                     comes down, it's a bit rusty int it?
                                     [1921] ... Seen better days
Mary (PS19V)                         [1922] Just depends if the frame's strong
Jane (PS19L)                         [1923] Yeah
Mary (PS19V)                         [1924] you know you could always put a bit
                                     of paint on it
Jane (PS19L)                         [1925] mm
Mary (PS19V)                         [1926] to stop the rust, it just depends
                                     if it's strong enough to hold them, the
                                     frame
Jane (PS19L)                         [1927] mm, it's done well though, I mean
Mary (PS19V)                         [1928] You might, you might get a little
                                     something out of it for Michael
Jane (PS19L)                         [1929] Mm, we haven't got a seat on it
Mary (PS19V)                         [1930] Oh dear
Jane (PS19L)                         [1931] I don't know what happened to that
                                     one that granddad made Deana ... I know
Group of unknown speakers (KCGPSUGP) [...]
Mary (PS19V)                         [1932] is John going to the tip with all
                                     this tree?

                                     come off it, you know that brown one that
                                     you bought me?
Mary (PS19V)                         [1938] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [1939] I mean I've had it since, I
                                     remember getting, washing me nappies and
                                     putting them on there
Mary (PS19V)                         [1940] Oh I bought that one when Deana was
                                     a baby
Jane (PS19L)                         [1941] Yeah, it was before Deana was born
Mary (PS19V)                         [1942] was it before Deana was born?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1943] Yeah cos I remember, I was doing
                                     [...] hang all me nappies out

Jane (PS19L)                         [1944] before she was born, so I washed
                                     them all and put them on [...]
Mary (PS19V)                         [1945] Did ya?

Mary (PS19V)                         [1947] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [1948] And it's been used constantly, so
                                     it's not done bad, it's the way, the leg's
                                     been wiggly for a while, it just broke off
                                     the other day, so, I don't know whether
                                     John can mend it, he couldn't seem to
                                     think he can
Mary (PS19V)                         [1949] No they're not er, I've got one
                                     that's got a rivet come out
Jane (PS19L)                         [1950] Mm
Mary (PS19V)                         [1951] on this side, you know where the
                                     little piece that, that bend, that you
                                     uncatch it to fold it up
Jane (PS19L)                         [1952] I know what you mean yeah
Mary (PS19V)                         [1953] the rivet's come out
Jane (PS19L)                         [1954] Yeah
Mary (PS19V)                         [1955] and that, I find that very awkward,
                                     I've got a rubber band round it at the
                                     moment
Jane (PS19L)                         [1956] yeah
Mary (PS19V)                         [1957] but you see that only lasts so long
                                     they, they perish
Jane (PS19L)                         [1958] yeah, done well, I might re come
                                     winter I'll probably replace it, I won't
                                     bother now it's not worth it with summer
                                     ... says she having a nice summer
Mary (PS19V)                         [1959] Yes, well, we're bound to have
                                     something aren't we?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1960] Well I should think so
Mary (PS19V)                         [1961] We're bound to have something
Jane (PS19L)                         [1962] We live in hope don't we?
Mary (PS19V)                         [1963] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [1964] [laugh] ... What are you doing?
                                     [1965] Mind you don't [...] your tongue
                                     with that ... I tell you what they had in
                                     er Woolies market as well, I don't know
                                     whether you've seen them and I don't, I've
                                     not got you know an old Argos catalogue to
                                     compare prices, cos they've not got it in
                                     the summer one, but they have them in the
                                     winter ones, it's like a, a tool box, but
                                     it's on wheels and you make it up, you,
                                     you know all the screws and the wheels
                                     come out and you're not, it's all plastic,
                                     I think it must be from age three, because
                                     of the little bits, and it's like erm,
                                     I've seen it somewhere, where I've been,
                                     it has little figures sat in this erm,
                                     what would you, it's like erm, a bit like
                                     a truck, yeah, and it's got the, the
                                     figures in it
Mary (PS19V)                         [1966] I haven't I haven't actually seen
                                     one, but I once saw a lady on the bus with
                                     one
Jane (PS19L)                         [1967] if it, on the bus you can see
Mary (PS19V)                         [1968] it's quite a big thing isn't it?
Jane (PS19L)                         [1969] Yeah, yes
Mary (PS19V)                         [1970] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [1971] on the box you can see it made up
                                     and then with all the bits and pieces
                                     separate
Mary (PS19V)                         [1972] Mm
Jane (PS19L)                         [1973] and I think it was something like,
                                     say twenty pound, it was on the market,
                                     but I have a feeling it was something like
                                     thirty odd
*** 11 (Tape 073904) ***

John (PS19M)                         [2014] and let him sit and listen to me
Jane (PS19L)                         [2015] mm
John (PS19M)                         [2016] he might turn round and say I'm
                                     sorry Mr you're not suitable, alright,
                                     I've not lost nothing
Jane (PS19L)                         [2017] mm
John (PS19M)                         [2018] you just had, you've just had a
                                     bloody, you've had a [...] off work [...]

                                     round and just say to them well they're
                                     messing about with all the hours we've put
                                     it down to the erm
John (PS19M)                         [2020] Recession.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2021] recession, but it's just the, I
                                     think it's just a bloody good excuse to
                                     streamline a company that's
John (PS19M)                         [2022] Oh it is
Jane (PS19L)                         [2023] you know I mean they, they do don't
                                     they, they overstaff and then they've got
                                     to cut back.
John (PS19M)                         [2024] Look at look at Llandudno
Jane (PS19L)                         [2025] Mm.
John (PS19M)                         [2026] one of the factories, they're
                                     shutting it
Jane (PS19L)                         [2027] Yeah but
John (PS19M)                         [2028] and where're they moving it?
                                     [2029] It's going
Jane (PS19L)                         [2030] yeah, but when
John (PS19M)                         [2031] to Creda.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2032] when was it built all them
                                     factories it was built in the seventies
                                     when the boom was in
John (PS19M)                         [2033] I agree, I agree, yes I agree, that
                                     factory's old, it's out of date, it wants
                                     a lot of modifying
Jane (PS19L)                         [2034] so now there's
John (PS19M)                         [2035] so they've got
Jane (PS19L)                         [2036] it's just a good excuse to
                                     streamline
John (PS19M)                         [2037] yes
Jane (PS19L)                         [2038] all the staff.
John (PS19M)                         [2039] yeah, you see Creda now at [...]
                                     are already making some of the washer
                                     driers, that Llandudno used to make.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2040] Mm, what gets me is how Creda
                                     they're gonna, they're, they're coming up

John (PS19M)                         [2043] Yeah, but having saying that
Jane (PS19L)                         [2044] Hotpoint take over Creda
John (PS19M)                         [2045] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2046] where are all Hotpoint's drivers?

Jane (PS19L)                         [2148] Int he trained up as a welder now?
John (PS19M)                         [2149] He's not a fully fledged welder

John (PS19M)                         [2157] but he's not
Jane (PS19L)                         [2158] So what was he wel was he welding
                                     at Cartwrights?
John (PS19M)                         [2159] He was making er legs for the [...]

Jane (PS19L)                         [2160] Mm
John (PS19M)                         [2161] what they do, they're like a leg
                                     and
Jane (PS19L)                         [2162] and you have to weld them in
John (PS19M)                         [2163] no, this leg it's, it folds under
Jane (PS19L)                         [2164] Oh
John (PS19M)                         [2165] and what it is the box is stood
                                     there and then you back the motor under it
                                     and then you drop it onto the body and it
                                     folds
Jane (PS19L)                         [2166] Why didn't he like it?
John (PS19M)                         [2167] He said it was repetitive
Jane (PS19L)                         [2168] Boring?
John (PS19M)                         [2169] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2170] But the money was there
John (PS19M)                         [2171] This is it, take your bed there,
                                     Saturdays and Sundays and as many nights
                                     as you want ... now personally me, I'd
                                     have stuck that
Jane (PS19L)                         [2172] Yeah, for the money
John (PS19M)                         [2173] for the easy job, you set your
                                     stall out, you make a jig to sort it all
                                     out, you can slide it in, zip, zip, zip,
                                     done ... you could probably say what,
                                     three an hour out, if you're lucky, two
                                     and a half, three an hour ...

John (PS19M)                         [2175] now I could put up with that, but
                                     obviously Colin couldn't, but having
                                     saying that I feel, I, I think I learnt a
                                     lot from being [...] bonus there
Jane (PS19L)                         [2176] Mm

Jane (PS19L)                         [2178] Was there, was it piecework then?
John (PS19M)                         [2179] Yeah to a degree, but not, not that
                                     bad if you know what I mean
Jane (PS19L)                         [2180] Let me go and see where Michael is,

             not in the top ten

John (PS19M) [2265] Heart of Stone ...
Jane (PS19L) [2266] I've only ever seen one and the one that, the recent one is
             called just Cher and that's got all the last, the last few top ten
             hits on it.

             it's got her latest stuff on it, I'm not really keen on anything
             else, it's got those last, you know the sort of her last few
             records of it, on it I should say ... I didn't know there was any
             others around, when I told you I wanted the Cher one, it was the
             one that was out now not the old ones.
John (PS19M) [2271] [shouting] This one's out now [] . ...
Jane (PS19L) [2272] No, what I mean is er the new one sort of thing, the new
             Cher, it's in the top thirty, it was about number three a month
             about a month or so ago ... I didn't know there was anything else
John (PS19M) [2273] Well have this one and see what else develops ... listen to
             it, you might like it.

             of chocolates, that was all, finish.
John (PS19M) [2288] Shut up ... and since when did you ever listen to me? ...
Jane (PS19L) [2289] It's not that I was worried about, it was just the money,
             it's a lot of money for something that, was an idea a couple of
             months ago. ...
John (PS19M) [2290] You really know how to cheer people up don't ya?

             was the tough steak has turned out to be the, the one that's not
             ... I cut the steaks about a bit, one was a bit fattier than the
             other ... the one that I had I thought would be dead tough, is
             tender ... it's [...] int it? [...] they look more like a sirloin
             steak to me than a rump, even though it went under the name of
             rump ... it looked like [...] you can only tell the shape of it
             can't, oh God

             said I come home last night and he said I couldn't park me bloody
             car up cos there were cars everywhere, and they were all theirs.

             bit of a taste of his own medicine.

                                     she said oh I've been thinking Michael'll

Chris (PS19P)                        [2369] so she said what I'll do she said
                                     is I'll leave the key to the garage under
                                     two bricks at the side of the garage
Jane (PS19L)                         [2370] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2371] she said and then he can use the
                                     power in there
Jane (PS19L)                         [2372] mm, mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2373] so as long as we've got a date by
                                     Saturday he can go and do it, if we still
                                     haven't got a date he won't be able to go
                                     and do it
Jane (PS19L)                         [2374] you can't do anything
Chris (PS19P)                        [2375] we've got the fencing well no, no
                                     you can't Jane because you're not insured
                                     you see until
Jane (PS19L)                         [2376] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2377] you actually exchange, as soon as
                                     you've exchanged contracts we've got to
                                     get insured you see ... but erm ... I mean
                                     on the letter we got from the solicitor on
                                     Saturday it said, it, it looks as though
                                     your purchaser's ready to exchange
                                     contracts in the forthcoming week
Jane (PS19L)                         [2378] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2379] so we've just wait and see.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2380] she's doing everything by the book
                                     I think, so
Chris (PS19P)                        [2381] Oh I've never even seen anything of
                                     her Jane
Jane (PS19L)                         [2382] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2383] I really thought I would see her
                                     round Sale, I've never seen anything of
                                     her
Jane (PS19L)                         [2384] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2385] but, erm ... it might of taken
                                     longer than what she thought as regards
                                     her London ends you see
Jane (PS19L)                         [2386] start again
Chris (PS19P)                        [2387] really, that's what it is
Jane (PS19L)                         [2388] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2389] well I think Dawn is quite happy
                                     now, I mean I think she felt as though
                                     she'd been rushed at first, but I mean
Jane (PS19L)                         [2390] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2391] that was her choice really
Jane (PS19L)                         [2392] that's right
Chris (PS19P)                        [2393] I mean she said to me on Monday
                                     something about, I mean it's her that
                                     wanted to be in, in, by the middle of
                                     March, now I never said the woman wanted
                                     to be in by March
Jane (PS19L)                         [2394] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2395] we were just discussing it
Jane (PS19L)                         [2396] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2397] but, I, Miss never actually said
                                     well I
Jane (PS19L)                         [2398] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2399] want to be in by the end of March
Jane (PS19L)                         [2400] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2401] I think she just assumed because
                                     she was coming down here with her job
Jane (PS19L)                         [2402] she was ready to move in
Chris (PS19P)                        [2403] that she'll be ready to move in you
                                     see
Jane (PS19L)                         [2404] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2405] but I said well at least you've got
                                     it all done, you don't have to rush around
                                     at the last minute.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2406] that's right.
                                     [2407] How much money did she make in the
                                     end on er garage thing?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2408] She didn't say and I, I never
                                     thought to ask her, no she didn't say ...
                                     so we're just, that's why really as I say
                                     I don't, I think at first she was quite
                                     happy for us to go in and maybe take stuff
                                     in, but I don't think she was happy about
                                     us doing structural things on it
Jane (PS19L)                         [2409] Mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2410] cos I think her solicitor must of
                                     said something to her you see
Jane (PS19L)                         [2411] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2412] but I mean even, even if we, if we
                                     get a date for next week Jane, we can't
                                     get in, cos I'm not going to get a key and
                                     go in when she's not there
Jane (PS19L)                         [2413] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2414] if it'd happened a couple of weeks
                                     ago when she was about I would of kept
                                     going over like she said I could do
Jane (PS19L)                         [2415] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2416] but we'll just leave it now
Jane (PS19L)                         [2417] yeah

                                     think oh I want it, to get it all sorted
                                     before I go and move, it'll just have to
                                     be in a tip for a while.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2421] yeah, you can't though can ya?
                                     [2422] I mean you've got, it takes you so
                                     long to place things and
Chris (PS19P)                        [2423] No you don't this is it, we'll just
                                     dump everything, I said to Mark we'll just
                                     dump everything in the back room and we'll
                                     stay in the back room till we've sorted
                                     the front room

Jane (PS19L)                         [2435] have you thought of any that you
                                     like?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2436] Oh we do like that one in the

Jane (PS19L)                         [2439] that particular colour or a
                                     different colour?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2440] yeah it looks lovely in the square,
                                     yeah because I thought it was quite light,
                                     but it isn't actually
Jane (PS19L)                         [2441] It's the pinky one int it there
Chris (PS19P)                        [2442] it's erm, you shut up, no I went
                                     in, I've never been in Weeks, to go in and
                                     have a look and everything, it was Hamish

                                     right laugh with him, he's the one that
                                     came and sorted the hall and stairs
Jane (PS19L)                         [2443] Oh
Chris (PS19P)                        [2444] out for me and erm, when he went in
                                     on Monday, erm it was the other one the
                                     lad that actually owns it, so I was in
                                     there for about bloody half an hour and we
                                     came home with some samples and one that I
                                     quite liked it was up on the wall and he
                                     said that is my best selling Axminster
                                     that I had, and it was like, it was maybe
                                     it was a bit too busy, it was, it was
                                     greyey and it was all different other
                                     colours in it, but it was a lot of flowers
                                     on it, it wasn't a traditional Axminster
                                     you see Mike loves these traditional
                                     Axminsters and he doesn't really, he won't
                                     really entertain anything else, erm,
                                     anyway I brought that sample home ... and
                                     what else?
                                     [2445] Oh yeah that's the only one I
                                     brought home, on Tuesday it was, well as
                                     soon as he saw, I brought it in and me dad
                                     looked at it and he goes yeah it's
                                     alright, I knew he didn't like it and then
                                     when Mike got in, he said oh I don't like
                                     that, so I said why?
                                     [2446] Well you take it back I said and
                                     you pick the carpet
Jane (PS19L)                         [2447] Mm where's this for then?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2448] so, this is the front room
Jane (PS19L)                         [2449] The front room
Chris (PS19P)                        [2450] so er, he goes off and he comes
                                     back with three samples then, well one of
                                     them, it has been in the window as well,
                                     but it's a very definite diamondy shape
Jane (PS19L)                         [2451] More
Chris (PS19P)                        [2452] no quite big shaped diamond but
                                     it's in like pastel pink and pastel blue
                                     and it's very, very pastely colours ...
Jane (PS19L)                         [2453] Can't remember those
Chris (PS19P)                        [2454] but I would imagine down on a floor
                                     it would look very, the diamonds would be
                                     too much if you
Jane (PS19L)                         [2455] hit ya mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2456] know wha what I mean, he brought
                                     that one home and he brought another quite
                                     nice traditional one, but it tended to be
                                     quite browny, and then another one and, er
Jane (PS19L)                         [2457] You're not ripping that up?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2458] and then you know the one that was
                                     in the window?
Jane (PS19L)                         [2459] Yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2460] He didn't bring a sample home of
                                     that cos he, he brought the same design
                                     but in a different colour, but it was more
                                     greeny
Jane (PS19L)                         [2461] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2462] so, anyway, I just, we've got it
                                     down on the floor and I says if we had a
                                     brown suite

Chris (PS19P)                        [2464] that would be ideal
Jane (PS19L)                         [2465] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2466] even though there was a bit of grey
                                     in it, it was the, really the brown that
                                     predominated it, I said it, it, the grey
                                     suite wouldn't go with it
Jane (PS19L)                         [2467] so you're gonna have the front room
                                     with your grey suite in it?

                                     any colours for your back room?
                                     [2471] No, this is, you're thinking this

Chris (PS19P)                        [2472] Yeah, er, well, so I brought the
                                     sample of that one home
Jane (PS19L)                         [2473] Mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2474] the one that's in the window
Jane (PS19L)                         [2475] right it's the pink squares
Chris (PS19P)                        [2476] and it's the and, yeah, me and
                                     Joanne weren't very keen on any of the
                                     carpets either and as soon as she saw that
                                     she said oh that's lovely

Chris (PS19P)                        [2478] she said now I do like that, cos it
                                     looks nice and warm cos there's loads of
                                     colours in it, there's pink, there's
                                     burgundy, there's blue, green, every

                                     thought it looked a bit too light, but I
                                     think what makes it look like that is
                                     they've got the light shining
Jane (PS19L)                         [2485] Yeah

Chris (PS19P)                        [2488] when you actually see it on the
                                     floor, it looks totally different
Jane (PS19L)                         [2489] Glenys has got it, very, very sim
                                     very, very similar, there's very, there's
                                     not a lot in it, I'll take those magazines
                                     off
Chris (PS19P)                        [2490] you see, oh Christ, erm ...
Jane (PS19L)                         [2491] but she got it in the greens
Chris (PS19P)                        [2492] yeah, well I, Mike says I brought
                                     that one home when we were looking for a
                                     hall instead, but I said no I said it was
                                     one very similar, but he said we couldn't
                                     have it because erm
Jane (PS19L)                         [2493] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2494] with them being the squares you'd
                                     lose a hell of a lot coming down the
                                     stairs
Jane (PS19L)                         [2495] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2496] you know on the turn and everything

Jane (PS19L)                         [2497] it would spoil it I mean
Chris (PS19P)                        [2498] it would, you've got to have a big
                                     spread really haven't ya?
Jane (PS19L)                         [2499] yeah, yeah I mean I'd thought about
                                     it for ours
Chris (PS19P)                        [2500] But
Jane (PS19L)                         [2501] but I remember what you said about
                                     the squares
Chris (PS19P)                        [2502] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2503] I'd like it in here
Chris (PS19P)                        [2504] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2505] I really would
Chris (PS19P)                        [2506] it would go lovely with this
Jane (PS19L)                         [2507] I know
Chris (PS19P)                        [2508] because even though
Jane (PS19L)                         [2509] it's got all the colours hasn't it?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2510] even though this is erm not a
                                     plain, it's not dead busy is it?
Jane (PS19L)                         [2511] No
Chris (PS19P)                        [2512] If you know what I mean.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2513] but that, it's not, it doesn't, I
                                     don't see that carpet as being a
                                     particularly patterned car I know it has
                                     got a pattern
Chris (PS19P)                        [2514] It is it's a definite square, it's
                                     definite true, what your colours
Jane (PS19L)                         [2515] but to me I look at the, I call
                                     patterned carpets all the flowers and
Chris (PS19P)                        [2516] mm
Jane (PS19L)                         [2517] rounded patterns
Chris (PS19P)                        [2518] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2519] d'ya know what I mean but
Chris (PS19P)                        [2520] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2521] to me this is, a square doesn't
                                     look the same as the round
Chris (PS19P)                        [2522] no
Jane (PS19L)                         [2523] you know
Chris (PS19P)                        [2524] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2525] I know it sounds stupid, but I like
Chris (PS19P)                        [2526] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2527] I don't like the round
Chris (PS19P)                        [2528] no
Jane (PS19L)                         [2529] flowery carpets
Chris (PS19P)                        [2530] no
Jane (PS19L)                         [2531] er or the ones that have got leaves
                                     going into
Chris (PS19P)                        [2532] mm
Jane (PS19L)                         [2533] you know that sort you have
Chris (PS19P)                        [2534] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2535] to me that's patterned
Chris (PS19P)                        [2536] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2537] but that carpet that you're talking
                                     about to me is a plain
Chris (PS19P)                        [2538] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2539] but it's a plain square.
Chris (PS19P)                        [2540] yeah, as I say Mike says, reckons I

Jane (PS19L)                         [2541] Liked it
Chris (PS19P)                        [2542] brought the green one home cos I
                                     brought the three samples home, the one
                                     that we've got down and another one ...
                                     and another one for the hall and stair,
                                     but I said I'm sure it wasn't the same as
                                     that, but it might have been, but I have
                                     to say he always said we would [...]
Jane (PS19L)                         [2543] Mike said [...]
Chris (PS19P)                        [2544] but you see the fortunate thing
                                     about it Jane, with that one, most of the
                                     carpets are only twelve foot wide
Jane (PS19L)                         [2545] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2546] which would mean, cos the room's
                                     thirteen foot wide
Jane (PS19L)                         [2547] oh is it?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2548] we would of had to
Jane (PS19L)                         [2549] Have another piece
Chris (PS19P)                        [2550] buy an extra five square yards
Jane (PS19L)                         [2551] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2552] cos it was only twelve foot wide,
                                     anyway, they do that one in fifteen foot
                                     wide
Jane (PS19L)                         [2553] Oh do they?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2554] so it, we've got to have twenty one
                                     something square yards, I think he worked
                                     it out at
Jane (PS19L)                         [2555] Is it thirteen foot wide then the
                                     room?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2556] Yeah into the alcove
Jane (PS19L)                         [2557] Yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2558] the back room isn't, the back
Jane (PS19L)                         [2559] no
Chris (PS19P)                        [2560] room's only about eleven and a
                                     half, because you get the back room, the
                                     front room and then it goes in a bit
Jane (PS19L)                         [2561] right
Chris (PS19P)                        [2562] to the back room
Jane (PS19L)                         [2563] to the kitchen
Chris (PS19P)                        [2564] to the kitchen you see
Jane (PS19L)                         [2565] yeah.
Chris (PS19P)                        [2566] where it's
Jane (PS19L)                         [2567] So what's the length of the front
                                     room?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2568] Er fourteen ten, by
Jane (PS19L)                         [2569] It's bigger than what it looks
                                     really
Chris (PS19P)                        [2570] though it's bigger than what you
                                     think really
Jane (PS19L)                         [2571] I think it's deceiving because it's
                                     got such high ceilings
Chris (PS19P)                        [2572] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2573] the high ceilings sort of seems to
                                     take it off with
Chris (PS19P)                        [2574] yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2575] I know it sounds silly, but perhaps
                                     if the ceilings was lower it would look
                                     big
Chris (PS19P)                        [2576] yeah, yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2577] higher that
Chris (PS19P)                        [2578] I think it's just maybe er how you
                                     have it as well
Jane (PS19L)                         [2579] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2580] I mean if you look at it now
                                     without the dining table
Jane (PS19L)                         [2581] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2582] it looks totally different
Jane (PS19L)                         [2583] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2584] I mean, Mike really likes that as a
                                     front room, he keeps saying that's gonna
                                     be our room, you know
Jane (PS19L)                         [2585] mm I like a front room
Chris (PS19P)                        [2586] he's, he's funny he does like a
                                     front room, so I thought well sod it, I
                                     hate picking carpets Jane, so I thought
                                     sod it he can pick
Jane (PS19L)                         [2587] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2588] the carpet and if it's not right he

Chris (PS19P)                        [2590] No, it is nice
Jane (PS19L)                         [2591] thinking of pink and grey in there
Chris (PS19P)                        [2592] yeah, and he wants to, he came home
                                     this morning and he said, he must of been
                                     thinking about it, and he said well we
                                     could emulsion the walls, he said erm, why
                                     don't we do an apricot white, I says well
                                     that's peach, I said the
Jane (PS19L)                         [2593] Yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2594] the carpet's pink
Jane (PS19L)                         [2595] yeah and, the suite
Chris (PS19P)                        [2596] it wouldn't, it wouldn't look
                                     right, I mean we have got apricot white on
                                     the walls in the back room now, but I
                                     said, he, I think he feels as though, a
                                     definite pink is not the right colour for
                                     a room, do you know what I mean?
Jane (PS19L)                         [2597] Mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2598] And yet it, I was quite happy with
                                     it to be honest
Jane (PS19L)                         [2599] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2600] Jane because I think it looks quite
                                     warm
Jane (PS19L)                         [2601] yeah, you can only put another
                                     colour into your curtains and bring it out
                                     with your carpet
Chris (PS19P)                        [2602] Yeah, well what I think he, I think
                                     he will emulsion over it cos I mean the
                                     ceiling's a bit, as you say she'd been a
                                     smoker
Jane (PS19L)                         [2603] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2604] and the ceiling in that front room
                                     is a very deep, deep pink I think, if I
                                     can remember rightly, I think we'll go
                                     over, we'll probably will go over it and
Jane (PS19L)                         [2605] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2606] erm we're not gonna go mad knocking
                                     picture frames down in that room, it's too
                                     much of a big job
Jane (PS19L)                         [2607] Yes it is, innit?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2608] I'm just gonna put a border round
                                     it
Jane (PS19L)                         [2609] Mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2610] seen like a border in perhaps like
                                     a bit of pink and bit of grey on it and
                                     it's like sort of scalloped edging
Jane (PS19L)                         [2611] Mm that'll look nice
Chris (PS19P)                        [2612] so put that over
Jane (PS19L)                         [2613] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2614] at the top of the erm
Jane (PS19L)                         [2615] in
Chris (PS19P)                        [2616] of the picture frame
Jane (PS19L)                         [2617] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2618] it sort of brings the ceiling down
                                     a little bit as well
Jane (PS19L)                         [2619] yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2620] cos to be honest, the more Mike
                                     goes over there, the more he keeps saying
                                     he doesn't really want to pull the picture
                                     frames down
Jane (PS19L)                         [2621] no well with them being such a tall
                                     ceilings, they're probably
Chris (PS19P)                        [2622] I don't know why, yeah and I think
                                     he feels as though you, he says well if
                                     you decorate it right you can blend it in
                                     with the wallpaper
Jane (PS19L)                         [2623] mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2624] anyway you know, so
Jane (PS19L)                         [2625] of course you will.
Chris (PS19P)                        [2626] I don't know I see I think we'll
Jane (PS19L)                         [2627] So what will you paint the picture
                                     rails white?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2628] Same colour as the walls
Jane (PS19L)                         [2629] Yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2630] I think, so it just blends in with
                                     the border round
Jane (PS19L)                         [2631] yeah, it'll look nice
Chris (PS19P)                        [2632] and then it'll just, it'll just be
                                     titivated up really, so we can live in it
                                     and then the back room can just be done at
                                     our own time.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2633] I, I'll definitely have those
                                     curtains for you this weekend, I'm gonna
                                     get them done.
Chris (PS19P)                        [2634] Well as I say Jane
Jane (PS19L)                         [2635] Well then you can put them straight
                                     up then can't you?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2636] well no she's already got them up.
Jane (PS19L)                         [2637] Mm, well what are they like?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2638] Well they're not very nice, but I
                                     mean er I'll leave them up till I come to
                                     actually er get everything done
Jane (PS19L)                         [2639] Mm, no I meant when you've dec once

Chris (PS19P)                        [2640] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2641] the grey curtains would go with
                                     your suite wouldn't they?
Chris (PS19P)                        [2642] Oh they would match up with it
                                     yeah, yeah well I, okay then if you want
                                     [...]

Chris (PS19P)                        [2646] you've gotta get up in the mood
                                     Jane, I did Saturday morning
Jane (PS19L)                         [2647] Mm
Chris (PS19P)                        [2648] it was fine, I thought right get up
                                     and get them bloody curtains washed, I had
                                     'em on the line, but do you think our Mike
                                     noticed them, well when he came home from
                                     work, because I thought of having to put
                                     'em back up again, I just
Jane (PS19L)                         [2649] Yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2650] got straight in from work
Jane (PS19L)                         [2651] oh
Chris (PS19P)                        [2652] and I had Mike ironing them while I
                                     was putting 'em up, I said right stand
                                     here and watch me hang this curtain, so
                                     I'm showing him how to iron it, so while
                                     I'm upstairs putting 'em up he's ironing
Jane (PS19L)                         [2653] He's ironing
Chris (PS19P)                        [2654] 'em, so I had 'em put back up again
                                     for quarter to six,
Jane (PS19L)                         [2655] That's alright that, I must have
                                     done six loads of washing, for some reason
                                     I just didn't seem to have enough to do me
                                     loads
Chris (PS19P)                        [2656] Yeah
Jane (PS19L)                         [2657] but then come Saturday morning
Chris (PS19P)                        [2658] it's all accumulated
Jane (PS19L)                         [2659] I had to, I was doing two what I
                                     call mid washes, this sort of colour

                                     colours and I'd
Chris (PS19P)                        [2662] yeah

Jane (PS19L)                         [2667] Yeah
Chris (PS19P)                        [2668] and then you'll regret it the next
                                     day
Jane (PS19L)                         [2669] I know
Chris (PS19P)                        [2670] cos the bloody basket's full to the
                                     brim
Jane (PS19L)                         [2671] I'm determining to keep it, I'm
                                     just putting bits in now
