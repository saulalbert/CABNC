*FRA:	Mm. •140932_141172•
*BRI:	Well they're taking all the power lines down in the village, or down through that part of the village which, fair enough, gets rid of the eyesore  but they're gonna put now a bloody big transformer,thing about seven, eight foot bloody tall in, in the field  right on the Copper Dollar •141252_156062•
*FRA:	Right. •156632_156842•
*BRI:	and originally they were gonna er mount it on the wall up against his lawn area where  •156842_163282•
*FRA:	Mm  •163282_163342•
*BRI:	people and all sit out erm  the landlord turned round and said no way hos, I'm not having it there sort of thing. •163342_170582•
        Of course then they change their attitude SWET said well alright we'll put it right down there in the corner. •170732_174252•
        Now right down in the corner, bearing in mind my parents' garden shall we say is there and the field height is there •174732_181752•
*FRA:	Mm •181752_181922•
*BRI:	so the thing's gonna tower above their blooming  •181922_183812•
*FRA:	Yeah  •183812_183982•
*BRI:	wall for a start, plus the hum  you get from these bloody things, in other words basically, as my parents spend a lot of time up in their top garden in the summer time, in the sunshine and all, you get the continual hum from that bloody  •183982_195102•
*FRA:	Yeah. •195132_195332•
*BRI:	thing  and I had a blazing row with them on the telephone  •196482_197962•
