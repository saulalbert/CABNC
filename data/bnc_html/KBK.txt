*** 1 (Tape 002001) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [1] It's the best thing of course so ... It's a very weird
                thing to be doing really isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [2] [...] You can leave it there if you want even though it's
                the ladies [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3] Yeah.
                [4] Thank you
Norrine (PS101) [5] [...] club house just to the left.
Chris (PS05X)   [6] Right.
                [7] There's certainly a fancy er club house there isn't it?
                [8] What's what's this fancy building here David?
Chris (PS05X)   [9] Squash.
Norrine (PS101) [10] Oh!
                [11] Is it?
                [12] Right.
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [13] Ah ha.
Chris (PS05X)   [14] [...] ... why we can't get on there, on the door
Chris (PS05X)   [15] Yes ... fine.
Norrine (PS101) [16] Yes there's quite a ... lay out in the main building.
Chris (PS05X)   [17] Right
Norrine (PS101) [18] Croquet and squash.
                [19] Bowls down the side
Chris (PS05X)   [20] Oh yes.
Norrine (PS101) [21] It used to be about the best bowling green in the in this
                part of the country.
Chris (PS05X)   [22] Did it really?
                [23] Yes.
                [24] Only the one tennis court?
Norrine (PS101) [25] No there's one there there's one here.
Chris (PS05X)   [26] Oh yes.
Norrine (PS101) [27] Over there that's ... behind me that's ...
Chris (PS05X)   [28] Oh yes, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [29] I am not sure whether it's those certainly where you can
                see the right players [...] .
                [30] Eileen's husband is the leading light in the bowls.
Chris (PS05X)   [31] Oh is he?
                [32] Really?
                [33] And is that ah er another cricket team altogether or what?
                [34] Club altogether?
Norrine (PS101) [35] That's another club.
                [36] Yes.
                [37] This is the [...] club [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [38] Right.
                [39] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [40] I think he he had a heart attack recently.
                [41] [...] I think he is off of it now but I think he must be
                quite a leading light
Chris (PS05X)   [42] Yes yes.
Norrine (PS101) [43] [...] speak to David Brian.
Chris (PS05X)   [44] Oh was he?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [45] [laugh] Yes.
                [46] Oh!
                [47] Oh!
                [48] Yes yes indeed.
                [49] Now, now I'm there and there aren't I?
Norrine (PS101) [50] Now if you were using this this is what we would do.
                [51] It's probably [...] erm, yeah I think you'd probably have
                a shot at your yellow.
                [52] Doesn't matter if you go off because you could come up
                behind it.
Chris (PS05X)   [53] Mm.
                [54] Mm
Chris (PS05X)   [55] And [...] it once
Norrine (PS101) [56] Yes yes.
                [57] Fine.
*** 2 (Tape 002002) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [58] Lynda wasn't here yesterday when er ... [...] out.
                [59] Sorry?
Norrine (PS101) [60] You'll have to warn her about it.
Chris (PS05X)   [61] Well I don't think it actually needs warning about.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [62] Well I believe it does.
                [63] I think it inhibits some people but ... she will explain.
                [64] You saw the sheet didn't you?
Norrine (PS101) [65] Well I didn't really look.
Chris (PS05X)   [66] It's irritating cos the clip won't go on the shirt.
Norrine (PS101) [67] Which clip's that [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [68] Well this microphone clip [...] shirt.
Norrine (PS101) [69] Is that the kind they wear on the television?
Chris (PS05X)   [70] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [71] Why do you [...] , why doesn't it work then?
Chris (PS05X)   [72] Well it's, the shirt just seems to be too fine for it.
Norrine (PS101) [73] Wear a tough shirt [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [74] Yes.
                [75] Playing a tough game tomorrow.
Norrine (PS101) [76] What are you playing tomorrow?
Chris (PS05X)   [77] Croquet.
Norrine (PS101) [78] Oh that's Saturday not Sunday is it?
Chris (PS05X)   [79] Yes.
                [80] Very irritating because er ... if only I'd approached
                David earlier as I'd intended to.
                [81] Previous weekend they had an open day at er Dulwich
                Croquet Club.
                [82] ... So all were invited to go along.
Norrine (PS101) [83] You were busy last [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [84] Of course I was on Sunday, yes indeed.
                [85] Indeed indeed indeed.
                [86] ... Yes I couldn't fit in much croquet then could I?
                [87] ... The implication was that it was going to be a bit
                warmer today wasn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [88] I think the sun might come out a little later, I don't
                know about warmer but
Chris (PS05X)   [89] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [90] it's certainly going to be overcast now. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [91] [...] have breakfast?
                [92] ... Thank you.
                [93] ... David and [...] were agreeing last night how much they
                like the road.
Norrine (PS101) [94] Made up you mean?
Chris (PS05X)   [95] Yes.
                [96] Yes.
                [97] But er
Norrine (PS101) [98] I must say I don't think twice now about opening that
                window whereas before I only did it ... reluctantly because of
                all the dust [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [99] Because of the dust flying in .
                [100] Yes, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [101] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X)   [102] She too was saying that she had an urge to go down with
                her broom and sweep up the [...] these building works.
                [103] ... Right.
                [104] ... I'm gonna have some breakfast, aren't you?
Norrine (PS101) [105] That's an idea.
                [106] They started off on grapefruit down there.
Chris (PS05X)   [107] Eating it, or
Norrine (PS101) [108] No no, preparing.
Chris (PS05X)   [109] Oh, right.
                [110] Shall I finish it?
Norrine (PS101) [111] Yes please.
Chris (PS05X)   [112] Oh, god bless our daughter.
                [113] [crockery noise] Hello dear.
*** 3 (Tape 002003) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [114] I've never seen such dry grapefruit.
Norrine (PS101) [115] I ought to complain really.
                [116] It's such, such a time wasting procedure when you've got
                to ... take things back.
Chris (PS05X)   [117] Where did they come from?
Norrine (PS101) [118] Sainsbury's.
Chris (PS05X)   [119] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [120] It's the same sort we had before that have been so good.
                [121] And the last couple of weeks I bought the cheaper ones.
Chris (PS05X)   [122] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [123] And that was forty eight pence for one grapefruit because
                it was pink.
Chris (PS05X)   [124] Doesn't even look pink, does it?
Norrine (PS101) [125] No.
Chris (PS05X)   [126] Well I think you complain.
                [127] I don't think you have to take it back, I didn't take
                that chicken back to Safeway's if you remember.
Norrine (PS101) [128] What chicken was that?
Chris (PS05X)   [129] The one that smelt. ...
Norrine (PS101) [130] Did you complain?
Chris (PS05X)   [131] Yes.
                [132] Don't you remember that?
Norrine (PS101) [133] I remember the chicken.
                [134] But I don't remember
Chris (PS05X)   [135] Some months ago.
                [136] I took the label back.
                [137] Didn't take, didn't bother with the chicken.
                [138] And she didn't, she scarcely even looked at the label.
                [139] She took my word for it.
                [140] Unfortunately because it, it was a special sell today job
                with a reduction off others I didn't get much money back.
                [141] And then went and bought another fresh chicken [...] had
                to pay even more money for it.
                [142] ... . Ah.
                [143] Well it's incredible how little mail, and there's nothing
                on fax or telex either.
Norrine (PS101) [144] They're all on holiday perhaps [...] half term.
Chris (PS05X)   [145] This is not nice.
Norrine (PS101) [146] Looks revolting.
Chris (PS05X)   [147] Mm.
                [148] Well.
Norrine (PS101) [149] Well don't bother, we'll take it back. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [150] Really not good.
                [151] Extraordinary.
                [152] ... Will you have toast?
                [153] ... Cake?
                [154] ... Sorry, will you have some toast?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
*** 4 (Tape 002004) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [155] Did you see that erm letter in the paper the other day
                about ... the, the introduction of sliced bread because there's
                been a bit of a correspondence about it?
Norrine (PS101) [156] Yes [...] sixty years ago or something.
Chris (PS05X)   [157] Yes.
                [158] And it's five sixteenths of an inch thick by ... ordinary
                buttering and half an inch thick for toast.
                [159] And [...] about nineteen twenty eight or something wasn't
                it?

                my mind if I should or I shouldn't but it has got those little
                ...
Chris (PS05X)   [161] Unfortunately it's got a sort of ... general grubbiness
                to it as well, hasn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [162] Well.
                [163] ... But that is because it doesn't come white any more
                when you wash it.
Chris (PS05X)   [164] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [165] You can't wash the white [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [166] No, no you can't.
*** 6 (Tape 002006) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [167] Thank you for getting this tomato juice specially from
                Safeway's. ...
Norrine (PS101) [168] When I go on half term I ought to [...] all things.
                [169] Actually has been rather [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [170] What?
                [171] Just not enough, [...] happening?
Norrine (PS101) [172] Break.
Chris (PS05X)   [173] Enough break yes.
                [174] That's right.
Norrine (PS101) [175] [...] organized.
                [176] Not enough change in your rate. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [177] Yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [178] I feel clearer in my mind about [...] which is a help.
                [179] And I don't feel clear of things to do which is very
                miserable [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [180] Well you're not doing your reports till after that time
                are you?
Norrine (PS101) [181] No they have to be in by the twenty sixth of June.
                [182] And the ten days after open day are going to be ... mad.
Chris (PS05X)   [183] Twenty six days, yes, ten days.
                [184] You've got sixteen days to do them in in theory.
Norrine (PS101) [185] Well I won't have really will I if [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [186] Is that the earlier day you all complained about?
Norrine (PS101) [187] [...] three days on.
                [188] And we asked for an extra ... ten days.
                [189] At the moment we've got three.
Chris (PS05X)   [190] Did you get any explanations why it was all required in
                earlier?
Norrine (PS101) [191] No.
                [192] She just feels she wanted the time to do it in her time.
                [193] [...] calling the tune.
                [194] As long as you don't do it too often.
                [195] Don't do it too often just call the tune without
                justifying it.
                [196] People get a bit resentful.
Chris (PS05X)   [197] Yes.
                [198] ... Do you think that in all schools the head always
                looked at all the reports?
Norrine (PS101) [199] ... When I was at school they hadn't signed them.
                [200] [...] every school [...] signed them.
                [201] ... I suspect Mrs feels she ought to be signing them not
                the [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [202] [...] .
                [203] That pot's finished now.
                [204] ... What a funny idea this queue down [...] parks isn't
                it?
Norrine (PS101) [205] Some people obviously overdo it.
Chris (PS05X)   [206] Mm.
                [207] ... Did you see that ... [...] thing on television last
                night?
Norrine (PS101) [208] [...] got their hats back. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [209] I'm interested there were women mixed in with them.
                [210] Just the same uniform.
Norrine (PS101) [211] I didn't notice that.
Chris (PS05X)   [212] Look at this lovely picture of this High Commissioner in
                Sri Lanka who's been booted out in his Morris Minor.
                [213] Somebody is about to set up
Norrine (PS101) [214] Who pays?
Chris (PS05X)   [215] [...] convertible by the look of it, still.
                [216] Mm about to set up a factory in Sri Lanka to make Morris
                Minor parts.
                [217] To rebuild them. ...
Norrine (PS101) [218] Will they find him another job now?
                [219] What do they do then then?
Chris (PS05X)   [220] Well he's employed by the Foreign Office.
Norrine (PS101) [221] Mm.
                [222] So will they send him somewhere else?
Chris (PS05X)   [223] Probably.
                [224] Or they'll keep him in London.
                [225] Sri Lankan desk or something.
Norrine (PS101) [226] Wonder what happened to [...] .
                [227] ... after Washington.
Chris (PS05X)   [228] He'll ... probably merge back into the Department of
                Transport.
                [229] Might do something else in the environment.
Norrine (PS101) [230] Oh there was some talk of ... going somewhere else.
Chris (PS05X)   [231] Oh was there?
Norrine (PS101) [232] Mm.
                [233] Well I mean, not an offer but

                [235] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [236] I don't know if [...] , but it's on the cards that one
                could.
Chris (PS05X)   [237] Oh.
                [238] Roy's idea was that er might get some highly paid job in
                industry.
                [239] Aviation or something. ...
Norrine (PS101) [240] Are you making more toast?
Chris (PS05X)   [241] Oh yes, yes I shall.
                [242] Gosh I'm not thinking straight.

Norrine (PS101) [244] [...] bit addictive with this at times.
                [245] That's why I try [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [246] It's, it's sitting down that's addictive is it?
                [247] Not having breakfast.
Norrine (PS101) [248] Having breakfast when you're sitting down.
                [249] You don't actually
Chris (PS05X)   [250] You mean you might get into a good habit? ...
Norrine (PS101) [251] [...] late to school.
Chris (PS05X)   [252] I must say I like it. ...
Norrine (PS101) [253] I'll tell you what.
                [254] ... Erm ... go without lunch to make up for it.
Chris (PS05X)   [255] To make up for what?
                [256] My having my normal breakfast?
Norrine (PS101) [257] Oh it's just me that's got to give up lunch is it?
Chris (PS05X)   [258] Well you could actually have two meals today, for a
                change.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [259] [...] .
                [260] That, that special orange and something honey marmalade.
Norrine (PS101) [261] Oh, the gift one.
                [262] Sweet orange marmalade with cider in.
                [263] It was sweet wasn't it?
Chris (PS05X)   [264] It was sweet, but it was pleasant.
Norrine (PS101) [265] Couldn't taste the cider could you?
Chris (PS05X)   [266] No.
                [267] You rarely can can you?
Norrine (PS101) [268] My home-made of three years ago.
Chris (PS05X)   [269] Oh yes.
                [270] Good, good and solid.
Norrine (PS101) [271] Thick, thick marmalade.
Chris (PS05X)   [272] Nice.
Norrine (PS101) [273] A bit thick.
Chris (PS05X)   [274] I like it, like that.
                [275] I think Lizzie's marmalade was particularly addictive.
Norrine (PS101) [276] Oh I did, mm, I liked that.
                [277] Nice bitter flavour.
                [278] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [279] We haven't tried Jack's have we?
Norrine (PS101) [280] [...] Jack?
Chris (PS05X)   [281] Well he's never given us a pot ... mean devil.
Norrine (PS101) [282] Oh I see, I thought.
Chris (PS05X)   [283] It's about the one thing a year he does do and crows
                about.
Norrine (PS101) [284] Well I expect his family dispose of it nicely for him.
                [285] I'm sure Andrew
Chris (PS05X)   [286] Oh yes, yes I do believe he's given Andrew a pot to take
                home.
                [287] He's still as daft about Andrew as ever isn't he?
Norrine (PS101) [288] Yes.
                [289] It shows a little bit, not in Jack, I don't mean in Jack
                I mean in Andrew.
                [290] Although Andrew's twenty eight.
Chris (PS05X)   [291] It shows in both of them.
                [292] I mean Jack was so solicitous that
Norrine (PS101) [293] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X)   [294] weekend towards Andrew.
                [295] And he and I had ... oops ... er ... had earlier talked
                about people, no that's fine, that's fine I like the crust, erm
                parking on verges and I was decrying it.
                [296] Of course when we came back and discovered Andrew and co
                had arrived, he'd parked on the verge and I ... had a dig at
                Andrew about it.
                [297] Jack was terribly defensive of him.
                [298] You know totally changed his tune from earlier [laugh] .
                [299] Andrew can do no wrong.
Norrine (PS101) [300] Well it's better that way round than the other.
Chris (PS05X)   [301] Oh you mean the way I treat Snoopy?
Norrine (PS101) [302] That's not what I mean at all.
                [303] ... [...] . No but it's better to have er parents who
                think highly of their kids even if slightly mistakenly
Chris (PS05X)   [304] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [305] than decry them.
                [306] Run them down.
Chris (PS05X)   [307] Mm. ...
Norrine (PS101) [308] The lupin's coming out.
Chris (PS05X)   [309] Oh yes so it is.

                healthy. ... [...]

                college to [...] ?
                [321] They're having it at the co , at the university because
                David's mother has some connection.
                [322] Which was how she knew about it.
Chris (PS05X)   [323] Right.
Norrine (PS101) [324] And the desserts ... I think the college does a very good
                array or selection or standard or something of desserts.
                [325] So they're going to actually ... buy the desserts from
                the college.
Chris (PS05X)   [326] Right.

Lynda (PS102)
Chris (PS05X)   [426] He lives there.
                [427] I had a chat with him last night.
                [428] And er he sort of admitted that he lives absolutely on
                the fringe of the no go area.
                [429] Mm look at it, I mean the name of his house Wit's End.
                [430] He's a very odd character.
Lynda (PS102)   [431] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [432] Out of interest, how much do you charge for your do?
Lynda (PS102)   [433] Erm ... no I didn't, Plum actually did the organizing.
                [434] I think, I think it was about two hundred and forty
                pounds
Chris (PS05X)   [435] Right.
Lynda (PS102)   [436] but don't quote me on it.
                [437] It might have been more it might have been
Norrine (PS101) [438] Somebody mentioned the figure of three hundred pounds.
Chris (PS05X)   [439] For a jazz [...]
Norrine (PS101) [440] Mm.
                [441] Does that sound right?
Lynda (PS102)   [442] It sounds a bit of a [...]
Norrine (PS101) [443] I don't know but that, that price, somebody in
                conversation mentioned it.
Lynda (PS102)   [444] Yes.
                [445] But they, of course they may be now cos we booked them
                back in Feb
Norrine (PS101) [446] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [447] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [448] and.
                [449] But they were only relatively cheap because at the time I
                made that [...] change [...] musician [...] union.
                [450] So they weren't charging union rates and we got them
                relatively cheap.
Norrine (PS101) [451] Maybe whoever was telling me was making a [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [452] Well when you look at how busy a programme they've got.
                [453] You can't, it's difficult to believe why they don't
                charge full whack.
                [454] I mean it was very interesting in the Crown last night
                because apparently they, they normally have some rhythm and
                blues and soul and things like that on a Thursday.
                [455] And erm ... the youngsters weren't objecting to their
                music.
                [456] I mean there were no real teeny boppers.
                [457] Erm but the the old grey hairs like me were leaping
                around and [phone rings] .
                [458] Yes alright.
                [459] Good morning Mr [...] .
*** 9 (Tape 002009) ***
Norrine (PS101) [460] Health food shop.
Lynda (PS102)   [461] And it's
Norrine (PS101) [462] Calming nerves sort of tension yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [463] Yes.
                [464] Well that, it [...] speak the truth they were given to me
                by June, who's very into that sort of thing and prescribed them
                for Simon and in fact has had to give him a few more now
                because he's had his driving test cancelled.
                [465] And and he happened to give me [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [466] But my sister said exactly the same thing when she began
                a lot of those new remedies.
                [467] And when I was talking to her she said, oh well you
                should give her something, but not to send her to sleep and
                make her drowsy.
Lynda (PS102)   [468] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [469] Not those kind of relaxants but something just to relieve
                the tension and make her feel calmer.
                [470] So she approaches it in a better frame of mind.
Lynda (PS102)   [471] I, my feeling is that it's a bit of a placebo.
                [472] But if it works it doesn't matter.
                [473] I put, Marie Ann gave her daughter a Valium before she
                took her driving test.
Norrine (PS101) [474] Did she fall asleep over the wheel?
Lynda (PS102)   [475] She didn't fall over the wheel and she did pass her test.
                [476] And Marie Ann [...]
Norrine (PS101) [477] Was she very nervous?
Lynda (PS102)   [478] She, she was very nervous.
                [479] And er [...] [banging] .
                [480] And I told Marie Ann about that and she said right.
                [481] That will not happen to Victoria.
                [482] And erm she did another very sensible thing which was to
                send Victoria out the day before with Patricia [...]
Norrine (PS101) [483] Someone new and different.
Lynda (PS102)   [484] Someone she, Victoria didn't know.
                [485] And he just sat there doing and saying absolutely
                nothing.
                [486] And erm Marie Ann [...] thinks she got over her worst
                nerves at that time.
Norrine (PS101) [487] That was a good idea.
Lynda (PS102)   [488] Was a good idea.
                [489] She offered to do it for Simon and he thought it was a
                good idea but er he never quite got around to doing it.
                [490] Maybe I'll get her to do it next week because his next
                test is next Friday.
                [491] He's hardly been in the car.
                [492] I shouldn't think his car will start.
                [493] So erm you know I'm glad it's only that but I suspect
                when the day comes his car will ... but he took these erm
                homeopathic tranquillisers of course thinking his test was
                going to be a couple of weeks ago.
                [494] And you have to take three the day before
Norrine (PS101) [495] Yes they're not very strong, you have to build it up
                gradually.
Lynda (PS102)   [496] and then, they're not drugs of course.
                [497] And then er one I think an hour before whichever event
                you're dreading particularly.
                [498] And he, of course he'd taken them [...] the day before.
                [499] And by the evening said oh I feel awful, I don't know.
                [500] And I reported that to June and she said that's a load of
                nonsense because there's nothing in it to make you feel
                lightheaded or anything else, and if he, if he felt a bit tired
                you know.
                [501] And of course on the morning it was difficult to tell
                because before he took the first test he appeared to be fine
                until really the, the very last minute.
Norrine (PS101) [502] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [503] And we didn't get that far.
                [504] [...] I can't say with my heart on my heart they work.
                [505] I myself put my faith in diazepam I've got [...] gram
                diazepam which is very slight, very small dose and is enough
                just to ... stop you caring so much about whatever it is that's
                really bugging you.
Norrine (PS101) [506] I mean I honestly think she's not going to pass even
                though she's going to have another go.
Lynda (PS102)   [507] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [508] Because as you know if you fail twice you're sure to fail
                the third time.
                [509] I mean you, how am I going to suddenly be better at it.
Lynda (PS102)   [510] How's it going to be different.
Norrine (PS101) [511] So I said well a lot of it's an attitude.
Lynda (PS102)   [512] Exactly that's the only thing you can really change.
                [513] Also I mean
*** 10 (Tape 002010) ***
Lynda (PS102)   [514] Doesn't it make you feel funny to have [...]
Norrine (PS101) [515] Erm therefore it doesn't really [...] .
                [516] I mean therefore she doesn't pass.
                [517] So there is some judgement and skill involved.
                [518] And I think her judgement is impaired by the fact she
                feels nervous.
                [519] And is anxious not to overdo it and [...] cos that's
                another where you fail again.
Lynda (PS102)   [520] Yes, unless somebody [...]
Norrine (PS101) [521] [...] bad enough.
                [522] But he wouldn't be letting you use your time if you were
                that poor at it because they do build you up very slowly.
                [523] [...] over two years she's been doing it.
Chris (PS05X)   [524] Well.
Lynda (PS102)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [525] Well hopefully, she's got another class on Monday.
                [526] She likes her tutor. [...]
Lynda (PS102)   [527] Well I'd be happy to give you the name of the particular
                one but I don't know whether it applies to the young.
                [528] [...] they usually want to know the colour of your eyes
                and that sort of thing [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [529] Well I only, I've bought odd things in the past and never
                actually been asked anything specific.
Lynda (PS102)   [530] I'll ask June.
                [531] It may not apply to anything but I know in the past when
                she's ... given me those things to try [...] erm she's got a
                book at home and it'll say ... erm particular ...
Lynda (PS102)   [532] [...] a decent homeopathic shop they prescribe [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Lynda (PS102)   [533] She, she uses homeopathic treatment [...] .
                [534] She went to the er ... College of Veterinary Surgeons
                yest Wednesday ... with her latest dog because she's not
                jumping.
                [535] You know she just got [...] bigger dog.
                [536] And she's had it some time now but the whole purpose was
                to ... so that she could train this one because ... the first
                one now is too old, the second one has [...] and can't.
                [537] And the second was a sort of [...] .
                [538] The third one has hip displacement.
                [539] The fourth one [...] and Jim wanted one [...] .
                [540] And she's had hip displacement.
Norrine (PS101) [541] Again?
Lynda (PS102)   [542] Yes.
                [543] So she can't, so she has five dogs she can't train.
Chris (PS05X)   [544] Good god.
Lynda (PS102)   [545] And she [...] tablet [...] today.
                [546] But that will be a bit of a [...]
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [547] I hope it means she doesn't buy any more dogs [...] .
                [548] I I fear the opposite.
Lynda (PS102)   [549] Well the one thing she can't do now is breed from her.
                [550] So she has to have her spayed.
                [551] I didn't know she planned to breed from her but er ...
                she must [...] .
                [552] But it means she has five dogs to look after and
Norrine (PS101) [553] Has she not passed dogs on or?
                [554] ... They're more like children than dogs [...] .
Lynda (PS102)   [555] Oh yes.
                [556] Yes, more like, more like children than children to her
                actually.
                [557] Erm the only thing that occurred to me I just wondered if
                she knew somebody who had a dearly loved dog that, didn't want
                to train it but you know she could perhaps just take along ...
                for the joy of running it and training it but I think part of
                the pleasure is the reflected glory you know it's my dog
Norrine (PS101) [558] Well it's [...]
Lynda (PS102)   [559] Yes.
                [560] So I don't [...]
Norrine (PS101) [561] Our erm department head at school has a beautiful collie.
                [562] And they felt he was bored at home because they're out
                quite a lot
Lynda (PS102)   [563] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [564] and although he's well trained and they ... exercise him.
                [565] They felt he was bored so they took him to training
                classes and Tricia said he's an absolute natural.
                [566] He goes up through the hoops along the narrow, she said
                the first day when all the others were standing there shaking
                at the narrow bath he was just over it and down and ... she
                said you've never seen him [...]
Lynda (PS102)   [567] I mean they do it and thoroughly enjoy it.
                [568] All of them do that er
Norrine (PS101) [569] They're not showing theirs or using it for any other
                purpose just for the dog's benefit.
Lynda (PS102)   [570] Yes.
                [571] For enjoyment [...]
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Lynda (PS102)   [572] She doesn't show them as such it's all agility and er
                obediency and so on.
                [573] And the dogs do, they wouldn't do it otherwise I suppose.
                [phone rings]
Chris (PS05X)   [574] Good afternoon, good morning I mean ...
Chris (PS05X)   [575] Pretty [...] order.
                [576] Phone call from Singapore.
                [577] ... Do you want to keep that list of the jazz
Lynda (PS102)   [578] Yes [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [579] because I've got the similar, similar thing in small
                format here. ...
Lynda (PS102)   [580] I was just trying to remember whether they did Joan's do
                at the [...] last year.
                [581] [...] . But I've got a feeling they didn't.
                [582] No they, they didn't because the ... that's right because
                it was cancelled last year it was the year before she did [...]
                .
                [583] But I thought they were perfectly acceptable and
                surprised in a way that so many people commented adversely on
                them.
                [584] Because they don't make a bad noise.
Chris (PS05X)   [585] I think it's people who don't like trad jazz Lynda.
Lynda (PS102)   [586] That's right.
Chris (PS05X)   [587] I think that's all, all you can say.
Lynda (PS102)   [588] Erm we are, there should be another order from Descar
                ready today.
Chris (PS05X)   [589] Oh.
Lynda (PS102)   [590] Mm.
                [591] One.
Chris (PS05X)   [592] Are you going to ring [...] ?
Lynda (PS102)   [593] I just [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [594] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [595] Erm.
                [596] The other thing I'm wondering whether I should do the
                Petroline order which in fact flew on its first leg to Rome
                yesterday.
Chris (PS05X)   [597] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [598] It's only worth about a hundred pounds.
                [599] We haven't insured it at all yet erm [...] arrange that
                anyway.
Chris (PS05X)   [600] Mm.
Lynda (PS102)   [601] But [...] might not be the best thing because ... if for
                any reason ... the buyer says that they didn't [...] they're
                not going to pay [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [602] I I I think we've got to accept that that on that
                business we have, we have, do not have secure terms period.
Lynda (PS102)   [603] Right but should we insure it fully?
Chris (PS05X)   [604] Not fully.
                [605] But contingency.
Lynda (PS102)   [606] Contingency is, I thought was just sort of between here
                and the airport
Chris (PS05X)   [607] Oh no.
Lynda (PS102)   [608] until it left the country.
Chris (PS05X)   [609] No.
                [610] No no no
Lynda (PS102)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [611] That is what it is for.
                [612] That is what it is.
                [613] Contingency is if the customer having, the buyer having
                said he will cover the insurance, doesn't
Lynda (PS102)   [614] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [615] and then ... doesn't get his money, doesn't pay us
Lynda (PS102)   [616] Right.
Chris (PS05X)   [617] we can claim.
Lynda (PS102)   [618] But if it was lost we could still claim?
                [619] We could claim, he couldn't but we could.
Chris (PS05X)   [620] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [621] Fine, O K.
Chris (PS05X)   [622] Yes.
                [623] We will probably have to prove that we have not been paid
                for the consignment.
Lynda (PS102)   [624] Interesting.
Chris (PS05X)   [625] Interesting possibility.
                [626] But it, it, it's not covering from factory to airport or
                anything of that sort.
                [627] It is definitely covering
Lynda (PS102)   [628] Right covering part of the risk.
Chris (PS05X)   [629] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [630] But not the [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [631] Yes.
                [632] Because we we can only take it on their word when they
                say we shall insure.
                [633] I mean we should be doing it for shouldn't we?
Lynda (PS102)   [634] I do do it for .
Chris (PS05X)   [635] Do you?
                [636] Right.
                [637] O K.
                [638] ... Ah. ...
Lynda (PS102)   [639] [...] contingency only [...] . ...
Chris (PS05X)   [640] I suppose it ... it doesn't matter very much one way or
                the other does it?
Lynda (PS102)   [641] What to them [...] cheaper?
Chris (PS05X)   [642] Cheaper to us, erm the trouble with it is of course we
                never actually add it in.
                [643] Do we?
Lynda (PS102)   [644] Yes [...] costs I do.
Chris (PS05X)   [645] Do you?
Lynda (PS102)   [646] Oh yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [647] You you bung it across to the customer?
Lynda (PS102)   [648] Ah.
                [649] I do if it's a C I N contract when I'm
Chris (PS05X)   [650] Well if it's a C I N contract you aren't you're not
                contingency.
Lynda (PS102)   [651] No.
                [652] If it's contingency, no I don't.
Chris (PS05X)   [653] No.
Lynda (PS102)   [654] But it's usually [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [655] It is a small sum yes that's quite true.
                [656] Great.
Lynda (PS102)   [657] I do add it into the costs if it's [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [658] Ah.
                [659] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [660] [...] don't know do they?
Chris (PS05X)   [661] No that's true.
                [662] That's quite true.
                [663] Now er Richard rang me at five o'clock yesterday.
Lynda (PS102)   [664] That's an old fashioned half an hour.
Chris (PS05X)   [665] Yes.
                [666] He did say that he'd tried to ring before I got back from
                lunch but I'm not one hundred percent certain.
                [667] Erm but it wasn't, it was twenty past two when I got back
                from lunch.
                [668] Erm and the erm ... I saw John at lunchtime and I
                mentioned it to him because he, he said that, it hadn't even
                occurred to me till then, because he said I'm concentrating on
                the surveying side and I thought ha ha ha to you my friend.
                [669] Would you like Richard's work telephone number?
Lynda (PS102)   [670] [...] why not.
                [671] Did you discover what company he works for?
Chris (PS05X)   [672] No I didn't I'm afraid.
Lynda (PS102)   [673] Oh.
Chris (PS05X)   [674] No I didn't erm ... I didn't ask.
                [675] But he said er, and I said that I gather you're seeing
                Lynda the weekend if you do find anything perhaps you could
                pass it on to her.
                [676] And John said oh it will give me something to do.
                [677] [laugh] It is a bit desperate isn't it?
Lynda (PS102)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [678] I think Lewisham have got themselves into a ludicrous
                state over people er ... .
                [679] Erm ... being pushed sideways into jobs that don't match
                and being paid full price.
                [680] I don't want [...] .
                [681] Erm being paid their full salary.
                [682] Yeah we don't want you any more so go and, go and twiddle
                your thumbs in this corner but they're still paying them twenty
                thousand a year.
                [683] Absolute farce.
                [684] Absolutely farcical.
Lynda (PS102)   [685] But I thought John had been put into a job that in fact
                he was born to and getting his teeth into [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [686] Absolutely.
                [687] Absolutely but he's up against the fact that nobody wants
                to know what he's doing.
                [688] Quality control, I mean er ... client satisfaction,
                things of that sort I'm not quite sure what he's into.
                [689] But er being a local authority they're saying oh come on.
                [690] Why make the effort.
Lynda (PS102)   [691] I mean sadly that really was in a sense what making local
                authorities answerable was supposed to stamp out.
Chris (PS05X)   [692] Yes.
                [693] And of course local government is the most wonderful
                procrastinator in the world isn't it?
Lynda (PS102)   [694] Yes but if they truly were answerable for their own
                budgets
Chris (PS05X)   [695] Oh sure.
Lynda (PS102)   [696] which they're still not
Chris (PS05X)   [697] No.
Lynda (PS102)   [698] and you know never will be now
Chris (PS05X)   [699] That's right.
                [700] That's absolutely right.
Lynda (PS102)   [701] er that things go on like that.
Chris (PS05X)   [702] That's right.
                [703] And that's going to be
Lynda (PS102)   [704] But who does it benefit?
                [705] It doesn't benefit.
                [706] I was quite convinced that ... ninety nine percent of
                people do not actually enjoy sitting doing nothing.
                [707] You like to feel useful.
Chris (PS05X)   [708] Oh absolutely.
Lynda (PS102)   [709] But who does that benefit apart from the fact they're
                getting a salary at the end of the day?
Chris (PS05X)   [710] Nobody.
                [711] Nobody.
                [712] Nobody.
                [713] But but ... when initially presented to you, here's
                twenty thousand a year for doing nothing my friend.
                [714] It's, it has an element of appeal doesn't it?
Lynda (PS102)   [715] Well clearly you'd rather being doing that than doing
Chris (PS05X)   [716] Getting nothing for doing nothing [laugh] .
Lynda (PS102)   [717] [...] .
                [718] Yes.
                [719] Yes.
                [720] But why can't they get their act together and ...
Chris (PS05X)   [721] Yes.
                [722] Yes I agree.
Lynda (PS102)   [723] I suppose at the end of the day ... yes you're right.
                [724] He's as well sit pushing papers around pretending to be
                busy but drawing the salary than being made redundant which is
                what ought to be happening.
Chris (PS05X)   [725] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [726] But they could possibly, they surely must be able to do
                it through natural wastage to some extent.
Chris (PS05X)   [727] I would have thought so.
Lynda (PS102)   [728] I mean all the time [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [729] This Guys er business incidentally.
                [730] They're now saying four hundred jobs will go but less
                than a hundred will be made redundant.
                [731] The other three hundred will go through natural wastage.
Lynda (PS102)   [732] [...] .
                [733] They said six [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [734] They said six hundred originally apparently but then and
                now they're talking four hundred.
                [735] There was some rather naff comments about the union
                people [whispers] COHSE I mean what a shower.
                [736] Erm.
                [737] On television last night there was some waffling about
                nothing and complaining they hadn't been told [laugh] .
Lynda (PS102)   [738] I don't, I honestly don't know what the answer is with
                the National Health but it's going to take years and years and
                years.
                [739] But probably we'll always [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [740] I think the Guys situation is a very interesting ...
                experiment.
                [741] It's a shame it's going on under a microscope, spotlight
                or whatever but erm.
                [742] Spotlight I mean don't [...] a microscope.
                [743] Erm ... but even so it's er ... it's, it's interesting.
                [744] And Guys needs it for goodness sake.
                [745] Guys definitely needs it.
Lynda (PS102)   [746] If you look at all the nationalized industries that have
                been privatized, they're all making thumping great profits now.
                [747] I wouldn't say it was, like the Gas Board, like B T.
                [748] And I wouldn't say that we were being fleeced, I mean I,
                I think we've always been fleeced up to a certain point but
                they were always making a loss in the past and [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [749] Well their, their accounting was cock-eyed in commercial
                terms Lynda.
                [750] It, it really was different accounting which is hardly
                comparable.
                [751] Erm and I see nothing wrong with making decent profits as
                long as you're not actually ripping people off as a monopoly.
Lynda (PS102)   [752] Yes.
                [753] I think it's a bit dubious what they do with the profits
                after.
Chris (PS05X)   [754] Well.
                [755] Oh that, that's a different matter.
                [756] That is a ... surely
Lynda (PS102)   [757] I mean with something like British Gas erm to make the
                enormous profit they've made surely it must be possible to
                reduce the price to the consumer.
Chris (PS05X)   [758] I would have thought so, yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [759] And they can give you all sorts of reasons why [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [760] Erm I I I must say I haven't read or heard anything about
                the British Gas thing.
Lynda (PS102)   [761] [...] billion [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [762] Oh yes.
                [763] I knew they'd made a lot of money.
                [764] But erm what they were going to do I don't know.
Lynda (PS102)   [765] [...] justify why they're not going to reduce the price.
Chris (PS05X)   [766] But the South West Water Authority or whatever they're
                called erm also made a big ... profit didn't they?
                [767] But the guy said well ninety percent of this has got to
                be spent on a small proportion of the works which we are
                required to do over the next decade.
Lynda (PS102)   [768] Well that's fine.
                [769] You know if British Gas [...] training themselves more
                efficient or whatever else it is, fine.
Chris (PS05X)   [770] Yes.
                [771] Yes.
                [772] Yes it's when you see British Telecom repainting all
                their vans with this silly new logo that you get a bit twitchy
                don't you?
Lynda (PS102)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [773] Mm. ...
Lynda (PS102)   [774] I think the health [...] length of waiting lists for
                operations and ... the furore about the fact that you've got to
                ring up and find where the shortest list is and all that [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [775] Mm.
Lynda (PS102)   [776] which is a sensible thing to do in a way.
                [777] Lots of people say well I don't mind waiting or whatever.
Chris (PS05X)   [778] Well.
                [779] Norman on his wall has a a a list of er ... theoretical
                waitings for the different specialists at Orpington hospital
                and presumably he's got one beside it for Queen Mary's as well.
Lynda (PS102)   [780] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [781] So he can actually look at and say oh well ... Queen
                Mary's is the place for you to go my friend.
Lynda (PS102)   [782] And some people might say oh I don't want to go there I'd
                rather wait [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [783] That's right.
                [784] Absolutely.
Lynda (PS102)   [785] You know it's going to work out [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [786] So it, it's happening already.
Lynda (PS102)   [787] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [788] To some degree.
Lynda (PS102)   [789] But er ... they're never going to, I don't think they're
                ever going to get on top of the waiting lists because they're
                introducing so many new operations.
Chris (PS05X)   [790] That's right.
                [791] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [792] So.
                [793] And there are people living longer and needing them.
                [794] But it's always going to [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [795] You, you have got to have a waiting list to use the
                facilities reasonably fully.
Lynda (PS102)   [796] Yes, otherwise you'd have [...] sort of hanging around
                and asking
Chris (PS05X)   [797] That's right.
Lynda (PS102)   [798] how is that hip?
Chris (PS05X)   [799] Yeah.
Lynda (PS102)   [800] Shall we do it now?
                [801] [laugh] ... Right.
                [802] I'll ring ... [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [803] There's your jazz band leader.
Lynda (PS102)   [804] Jeffrey Jeffrey!
                [805] Is that really? [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [806] That's his full time job. [...]
Lynda (PS102)   [807] [...] when does [...] ... And he lives in ?
Chris (PS05X)   [808] He admits that it's a [...] area [...] .
                [809] He's a bit of an odd boy himself though you know.
Lynda (PS102)   [810] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [811] And I think it was his wife there last night too.
                [812] Erm and she, she's a, a curious lady.
                [813] ... I think it was his wife anyway she went round with a
                pot at the end. ...
Lynda (PS102)   [814] And he, I mean that's such an anomaly.
                [815] He's effectively a surveyor.
Chris (PS05X)   [816] Yes.
                [817] He's a building surveyor.
Lynda (PS102)   [818] I mean, you know building surveyors don't wear clothes
                like that.
                [819] [...] pants.
Chris (PS05X)   [820] Dressed all in black dear.
Lynda (PS102)   [821] I was just gobsmacked [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [822] Yes, yes.
                [823] Incredible isn't it.?
                [824] Brave fellow I'd say.
Lynda (PS102)   [825] Yes.
                [826] I love the ... humorous name though [laugh] .
Chris (PS05X)   [827] Yes it fits him rather well doesn't it?
Lynda (PS102)   [828] Like the little terrace house called Bedlam at the end of
                [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [829] [laugh] Talking of which there's a house down lower
                Camden which has the Chislehurst station sign.
                [830] Great big thing.
                [831] Stuck in their driveway.
                [832] It's been there for ages and ages and ages.
Lynda (PS102)   [833] [laugh] .
                [834] Not a very clever thief really.
Chris (PS05X)   [835] No I wouldn't have thought so either.
                [836] Enormous great thing.
Lynda (PS102)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [837] By the way ...
Lynda (PS102)   [838] I heard it on erm Capital Radio.
                [839] Now how does it actually work?
Chris (PS05X)   [840] You just say please may I have my Argos card.
                [841] You take the card back next time and they put it in a
                machine and add more points to it.
                [842] Recorded electronically.
Lynda (PS102)   [843] And, and where do you, how do you know how many points
                you've got?
Chris (PS05X)   [844] You, you don't.
                [845] The machine will no doubt tell you but erm ... and for
                every fifty pounds of petrol you get one pound for Argos.
Lynda (PS102)   [846] Oh well that's not bad.
Chris (PS05X)   [847] Well considering I put thirty quid in to fill the tank
                yesterday.
                [848] You, you get there quite quickly.
Lynda (PS102)   [849] Yes.
                [850] Mine takes thirteen pounds worth at a time [...] .
                [851] [...] such a nuisance.
Chris (PS05X)   [852] And then you can just shove in your pass and erm
Lynda (PS102)   [853] So they ... they put this through the machine.
Chris (PS05X)   [854] They just put it in the machine and tag it and, price
Lynda (PS102)   [855] And then when you go to Argos they put this through their
                machine.
Chris (PS05X)   [856] That's right and read it off.
Lynda (PS102)   [857] Right.
                [858] So anyone can use it.
Chris (PS05X)   [859] And it's a long term promotion.
                [860] It's going till the end of next year or, or August next
                year.
Lynda (PS102)   [861] Is it just?
Chris (PS05X)   [862] Yes.
                [863] So you you you have a chance to actually build up
                something worthwhile.
Lynda (PS102)   [864] Yes.
                [865] I think that's ... I think that's the first sensible
                thing they've done.
                [866] [...] worth a pound off so they give you ... [...] ten
                points do they every [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [867] Well, my thirty pounds seventy gave me sixty, thirty
                pence or something.
                [868] ... What, what did I say, fifty, fifty
Lynda (PS102)   [869] You said fifty pounds [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [870] Fifty pounds worth of petrol gives you one pound off. ...

Lynda (PS102)   [871] Next, up to.
                [872] ... Which is five pounds off.
                [873] So presumably you have to do it ...
Chris (PS05X)   [874] Do what?
Lynda (PS102)   [875] Well, it says you can collect up to twenty five hundred
                premium points on your collecting card.
Chris (PS05X)   [876] Then you get another card.
Lynda (PS102)   [877] Then you get another card.
Chris (PS05X)   [878] You've got stacks of cards there. ...
Lynda (PS102)   [879] I think that's a jolly good idea.
Chris (PS05X)   [880] Yes I think it's fair.
Lynda (PS102)   [881] And what I really need is another card for my purse!
                [882] [laugh] . When I was in Sainsbury's yesterday you know
                [...] credit card [...] pay by cheque.
                [883] And erm I mean I've got [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [884] Membership etcetera?
Lynda (PS102)   [885] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [886] National Trust I see there.
                [887] Which you never use.
Lynda (PS102)   [888] I've never used.
                [889] Peugeot warrantee [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [890] Oh fancy putting that on a plastic card.
Lynda (PS102)   [891] Well that's, no it's a breakdown service.
Chris (PS05X)   [892] Oh is it?
Lynda (PS102)   [893] Mm.
                [894] ... Erm my library ticket.
                [895] Er picture of Kate.
                [896] Two [...] tickets for the thirteenth of June.
                [897] And erm [...] stamps worth fifteen pence each which [...]

Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Lynda (PS102)   [898] [...] which I can't live without.
                [899] But these are my credit cards. [laugh]
Chris (PS05X)   [900] Oh my god.
Lynda (PS102)   [901] What I really need is another credit card.
                [902] I mean yesterday I can never find my Visa card quickly
                you know what it's like [...] .
                [903] And I found my Mastercard ... first
Chris (PS05X)   [904] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [905] and went to put it back and I thought oh ... doesn't
                matter does it you know [...] credit cards.
                [906] Gave it to the girl and she went ... oh ... erm ...
                what's the credit limit on this?
                [907] I said I haven't a clue, I've never used it.
                [908] She said oh I've got to write down a credit limit. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [909] So.
                [910] Oh what's the credit limit on your Barclaycard?
Lynda (PS102)   [911] I think fifty pounds you know before they have to ... no
                it isn't my credit limit ...
Chris (PS05X)   [912] Well yeah well they mean that credit limit
Lynda (PS102)   [913] It's a thousand pounds.
Chris (PS05X)   [914] Do you mean as a cheque ... backing card?
Lynda (PS102)   [915] She said what is your credit limit on this.
                [916] I don't know.
Chris (PS05X)   [917] Were you paying by cheque?
Lynda (PS102)   [918] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [919] Well it's not a cheque guarantee card anyway.
                [920] That's not a cheque guarantee card.
                [921] Is it?
Lynda (PS102)   [922] Neither is Barclaycard.
Chris (PS05X)   [923] It is with Barclays, but I mean the, there's got to be a
                standard figure for the Barclaycard.
                [924] Any any anybody else's, my bank card has a figure on it.
                [925] It actually has fifty quid on it or something of that
                sort.
Lynda (PS102)   [926] I think it's fifty pounds for everything.
Chris (PS05X)   [927] Yes. ...
Lynda (PS102)   [928] Yes anyway.
                [929] So that had to go back and I had to find my Visa card
                much to the annoyance of people queuing behind me.
*** 11 (Tape 002011) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [930] Have you tried them on already?
Norrine (PS101) [931] Not yet. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [932] I like the look of it very much. ...
Norrine (PS101) [933] Oh. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [934] [...] or something.
Norrine (PS101) [935] No [...] . ... [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [936] Fits nicer than that one.
                [937] Do you like it?
Norrine (PS101) [938] Well I'm asking you.
Chris (PS05X)   [939] Yes I like it.
                [940] I like it.
Norrine (PS101) [941] Well you think it fits alright?
Chris (PS05X)   [942] It seems to me to fit perfectly.
Norrine (PS101) [943] And the colour's not too drab?
Chris (PS05X)   [944] I don't think the colour's drab at all.
                [945] I think the colour's fab.
Norrine (PS101) [946] Right.
Chris (PS05X)   [947] Looks just fine to me.
Norrine (PS101) [948] Yes.
                [949] Mm.
                [950] I'll just slip on another one.
Chris (PS05X)   [951] I like it.
Norrine (PS101) [952] It wasn't too expensive.
                [953] Thirty pounds, twenty-nine ninety five or something.
Chris (PS05X)   [954] Good.
Norrine (PS101) [955] Which isn't a bad price.
Chris (PS05X)   [956] Did you try, do you try any of them on in Marks?
Norrine (PS101) [957] No.
Chris (PS05X)   [958] What's the material like?
Norrine (PS101) [959] I don't know.
                [960] [...] . Now this one ... I've realized now ... is
                actually meant for wearing ... outside because it's got a bit
                of shaping here, see?
Chris (PS05X)   [961] Oh I see what you mean, yes, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [962] Erm but whether that ... couldn't wear it outside with
                this
Chris (PS05X)   [963] Out out out or in presumably [...] ?
Norrine (PS101) [964] Presumably. [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [965] What do you mean?
Norrine (PS101) [966] The collar ends in a point at the bottom in the styling.
Chris (PS05X)   [967] Oh I see.
                [968] Oh yes yes yes yes I do see what you mean, yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [969] I will say it's cut shorter at the back. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [970] [...] sort of waistcoaty in fact.
Norrine (PS101) [971] [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [972] Well it looks fine tucked in like that.
Norrine (PS101) [973] I mean there's not much of it to tuck in.
                [974] ... You know sort of
Chris (PS05X)   [975] Well that looks very smart as it is.
Norrine (PS101) [976] But you couldn't wear it out on this particular blouse
Chris (PS05X)   [977] Well ca w
Norrine (PS101) [978] because of the belt.
                [979] If you wore the erm
Chris (PS05X)   [980] Well try it.
Norrine (PS101) [981] If you.
                [982] I will.
                [983] You think that the colours go and
Chris (PS05X)   [984] I think the colours go very well indeed.
                [985] I mean it doesn't pick up precisely the same colour but
                that in there
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [986] Yes it is.
                [987] Yes it is.
                [988] Yes.
                [989] But it clashes very well indeed.
                [990] Why can't you wear it out like that?
Norrine (PS101) [991] Because you destroy the blouse, the the way that the belt
                [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [992] Well that doesn't matter if you've got your, if you've
                got your jack your jackety effect then haven't you?
Norrine (PS101) [993] I suppose you could, if you were going to wear it like
                that, you could take the belt right off.
Chris (PS05X)   [994] Well you don't have to.
Norrine (PS101) [995] Well no but you, it, it, it's quite a heavy belt and if
                it, if it's holding, if it's giving point to it.
Chris (PS05X)   [996] Yes.
                [997] And that would make it a, an even cooler outfit wouldn't
                it?
Norrine (PS101) [998] Yes.
                [999] Because I have got this ... [...] ... this ... this
                creamy shirt.
                [1000] Erm ... which I saw again in Marks this year ... which
                you could wear tucked in with a belt.
Chris (PS05X)   [1001] Yes.
                [1002] Yes.
                [1003] But that one is, is genuinely versatile.
                [1004] Looks just as good tucked in as
Norrine (PS101) [1005] Yes.
                [1006] As I say the problem with the tucking in on that one is
                there's not quite such a lot of length.
                [1007] So when you do this you might come out.
Chris (PS05X)   [1008] It'd start pulling out, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1009] Erm and I don't think it looks good hanging out because
                it's, you, you paying in the skirt and the belt and that.
                [1010] And it's a bit silly to wear er a permanent arrangement.
                [1011] But this shirt could be worn with the skirt, couldn't
                it?
Chris (PS05X)   [1012] Definitely.
Norrine (PS101) [1013] I mean the colour's just as, it's not quite as strong.
Chris (PS05X)   [1014] [...] the colour's pretty neutral isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [1015] But I mean it does pick up.
Chris (PS05X)   [1016] Yes.
                [1017] Yes I think the skirt's gonna be very useful actually.
Norrine (PS101) [1018] Er [...] good skirt whether [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1019] Well I hope you will.
                [1020] I like it.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1021] It's the wrong green I think.
                [1022] The actual skirt, the skirt's a blueyer green.
                [1023] But you've got two blouses to wear with it, that's
                alright.
                [1024] You've got this other white one as well.
Norrine (PS101) [1025] [...] white one.
                [1026] That's a short, that's your shirt.
Chris (PS05X)   [1027] That's mine is it?
                [1028] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [1029] They're very good, that's the white one.
Chris (PS05X)   [1030] Yes.
                [1031] I would have thought
Norrine (PS101) [1032] This white one might [...] the cream one.
Chris (PS05X)   [1033] Well so you've got four blouses [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [1034] Which is the fourth?
Chris (PS05X)   [1035] Well the one you just said is a bit old now.
Norrine (PS101) [1036] Oh yeah but that's white again isn't it?
Chris (PS05X)   [1037] Yes.
                [1038] No I think they're all worth [...] and I think that's an
                attractive top as well.
                [1039] I think you should have that.
Norrine (PS101) [1040] Well erm.
                [1041] What else [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1042] I don't know [...] .
                [1043] It's it's it's a possible winter or cooler
Norrine (PS101) [1044] No it's not.
Chris (PS05X)   [1045] weather skirt.
                [1046] With a jumper or cardigan.
Norrine (PS101) [1047] No it's not.
                [1048] [...] cooler, warmer weather and it's got short sleeves
                you know.
                [1049] I don't really erm [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [1050] That's wrong for that.
                [1051] This has got a stain on it.
Chris (PS05X)   [1052] That's a nuisance.
                [1053] It would be perfectly acceptable otherwise.
Norrine (PS101) [1054] Yes and we've got big crease marks on there.
Chris (PS05X)   [1055] Let's have a look.
Norrine (PS101) [1056] There.
                [1057] ... I know it's there.
                [1058] I know it was last year I was really annoyed.
Chris (PS05X)   [1059] Put the light on.
                [1060] ... . Well if we can't see it, it doesn't matter even if
                it is there.
                [1061] N'est pas?
Norrine (PS101) [1062] Well you certainly can't see it.
                [1063] Which is [...] cos there was this big round grease mark.
                [1064] It was very [...] but maybe I got it out.
                [1065] But I suppose that ... might erm
Chris (PS05X)   [1066] Don't you think they go well together?
Norrine (PS101) [1067] work.
                [1068] Those colours are not too dark are they?
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [1069] They're not perfect but they would do [...] .
                [1070] Oh what about this?
                [1071] ... Mind you this skirt is only casual.
                [1072] And that's a rather sort of formal blouse.
                [1073] No that's wrong.
                [1074] [...] wrong.
Chris (PS05X)   [1075] Oddly enough I mean it's so far away from the yellow I
                would say it isn't wrong.
Norrine (PS101) [1076] Oh it is wrong.
                [1077] It's not, it's not the same as this at all.
                [1078] That's sort of brilliant
Chris (PS05X)   [1079] That, that's a hot pattern and colour isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [1080] That's a brilliant yellow, yes.
                [1081] And this one's erm a sort of golder.
                [1082] And that wouldn't do.
                [1083] But that's colours go with that [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1084] Mhm.
Norrine (PS101) [1085] Those are the only [...] .
                [1086] And I'll keep this blue skirt [...] stain, quite smart.
Chris (PS05X)   [1087] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1088] [...] .
                [1089] And I'll keep the dress.
                [1090] And I'll think about the shirt.
                [1091] I like it with the skirt.
                [1092] What I might do is go back to Marks.
                [1093] If they have one thing in that colour they may have
                another one.
Chris (PS05X)   [1094] In what colour?
                [1095] We were chatting.
Norrine (PS101) [1096] The gold [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1097] Are you, are you thinking of that because it's a bit too
                formal or something?
Norrine (PS101) [1098] No just because it hasn't got the length for tucking in.
Chris (PS05X)   [1099] Oh, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1100] And I don't like these that pull out when you [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1101] Well at least if it pulls out it looks alright.
                [1102] ... It was interesting in the pub last night.
                [1103] There were quite a lot of enthusiastic er ... audience
                but er they were mostly grey beards like me.
                [1104] Yes.
                [1105] Oh yes well apparently they normally have a sort of
                rhythm and blues or something on a, on a Thursday.
                [1106] Er or soul or something of that sort, which er ... you
                know there were loads of youngsters in the pub.
                [1107] Not under age youngsters I was pleased to see.
                [1108] But er ... there were a goodly proportion of people who
                were really enjoying the er, the track.
Norrine (PS101) [1109] I'm sorry I didn't feel up to going.
Chris (PS05X)   [1110] Yeah.
                [1111] Well we've got plenty of other, I've got the list.
                [1112] [...] opportunities to go and hear them again.
                [1113] He's a funny character though.
Norrine (PS101) [1114] Who?
                [1115] Who's a funny character?
Chris (PS05X)   [1116] , who runs it.
Norrine (PS101) [1117] [...] .
                [1118] ... He seems to have a very popular pub there.
Chris (PS05X)   [1119] Oh, who runs the band sorry, runs the band.
Norrine (PS101) [1120] Oh, who runs the band.
Chris (PS05X)   [1121] Yeah, it, it's a new interim landlord at the Crown. ...
Norrine (PS101) [1122] What happened to the old one?
Chris (PS05X)   [1123] Oh, they move on.
                [1124] Erm you know he found another pub.
                [1125] Sometimes they move from being managers to being
                licence, erm erm tenants, I mean
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1126] when they're running their own business.
Norrine (PS101) [1127] A bigger pub?
Chris (PS05X)   [1128] Perhaps but I mean the Crown is quite a big pub.
Norrine (PS101) [1129] [...] more opportunities.
Chris (PS05X)   [1130] Quite a big pub.
                [1131] It's a, with its own kitchens and what have you.
                [1132] I should think you could make a good living there if you
                wanted to.
                [1133] And there have been long term er landlords there.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1134] Sorry?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1135] Mm.
                [1136] Well I'll go and shower now.
                [1137] ... Snoopy was off in a rush wasn't she?
Norrine (PS101) [1138] Well she was going on the train.
Chris (PS05X)   [1139] Didn't realize she was going quite so early but I
                suppose it's hardly early anyway now.
Norrine (PS101) [1140] What time does Lynda come in these days?
Chris (PS05X)   [1141] Half past nineish.
Norrine (PS101) [1142] I wonder if she'll change her time because of half term
                and she won't have to be ... taking her daughter to nursery
                school today, half past one.
Chris (PS05X)   [1143] She may be.
                [1144] Yes, yes she may be.
                [1145] Yep.
Norrine (PS101) [1146] [...] isn't it? [...] bridesmaid's dress.
                [1147] There's nothing the right colour at all.
Chris (PS05X)   [1148] Oh how annoying.
Norrine (PS101) [1149] I'll have to go into that little ... Auntie Pat's
                Textiles or whatever it's called in the afternoon.
Chris (PS05X)   [1150] You don't want to leave it to Veronica?
Norrine (PS101) [1151] Veronica doesn't want, want to do the shopping bit of
                it.
Chris (PS05X)   [1152] No.
Norrine (PS101) [1153] I don't blame her either.
Chris (PS05X)   [1154] [laugh] yes, it's certainly improving a bit
Norrine (PS101) [1155] I know she hasn't left all her customers.
Chris (PS05X)   [1156] Oh quite, quite.
                [1157] Does she have any other suggestions of shops for the
                linings?
Norrine (PS101) [1158] [...] .
                [1159] Well John Lewis probably will have it but that means ...
                burdening Suzannah with it.
                [1160] At a time when she's busy with her exams.
                [1161] It also means sorting out the cash.
Chris (PS05X)   [1162] How interested is she in the preparation of this dress?
Norrine (PS101) [1163] Oh she's interested alright. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [1164] Interested enough to be enthusiastic and do the right
                thing?
Norrine (PS101) [1165] Well she, she also [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1166] Did she?
Norrine (PS101) [1167] but she is ... preoccupied at the moment with her exams
                and in a way I'm glad.
                [1168] I didn't want to ... send her material hunting if she
                could be doing something useful at college.
Chris (PS05X)   [1169] Yes, yes fair enough.
                [1170] Anyway, O K
Norrine (PS101) [1171] Karen's given her an extra job from ... [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1172] Is she?
Norrine (PS101) [1173] [...] going in on Monday when she doesn't normally.
Chris (PS05X)   [1174] Half past ten, right.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1175] Well given that then, in that case she still can't ring
                the bank to find out what, how much she's now got in the
                account.
Norrine (PS101) [1176] Can't she?
                [1177] Why not?
Chris (PS05X)   [1178] Well she can do, but she can't do it from home.
                [1179] That's all.
                [1180] She won't be home.
                [1181] [...] will she?
Norrine (PS101) [1182] Banks open at nine don't they?
                [1183] I mean, not to the public but the office is.
Chris (PS05X)   [1184] Yes.
                [1185] Anyway she's the one who 's [...] find out
Norrine (PS101) [1186] I mean anyway she'll be home again.
Chris (PS05X)   [1187] Will she?
Norrine (PS101) [1188] She's only going for one class.
Chris (PS05X)   [1189] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [1190] I mean she'll be home [...] after lunch I imagine.
Chris (PS05X)   [1191] Yes.
                [1192] ... Did you do anything about those tranquillisers?
Norrine (PS101) [1193] What [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [1194] Lynda's got some, for Simon.
                [1195] For his driving test.
Norrine (PS101) [1196] I mentioned it to [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1197] Homeopathic ones.
Norrine (PS101) [1198] Well that's the kind I was after.
                [1199] Erm, I mentioned it to Suzannah.
                [1200] And she wasn't averse to the idea.
                [1201] But she said she doesn't need them for Monday because
                it's only when she takes the tests she gets in a panic not when
                she's ... she said she can do it in the practice classes.
Chris (PS05X)   [1202] Right.
Norrine (PS101) [1203] What she needs, lots of practice with different, not all
                on one man like before
Chris (PS05X)   [1204] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1205] but a new person each time [...] skill
Chris (PS05X)   [1206] I, I doubt whether she's been properly taught on the
                subject quite frankly.
Norrine (PS101) [1207] I mean other girls have passed.
Chris (PS05X)   [1208] Yes, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1209] And she likes Karen.
                [1210] Very much.
Chris (PS05X)   [1211] Her teacher for [...] ?
Norrine (PS101) [1212] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [1213] Oh, I
Norrine (PS101) [1214] She's a young girl.
Chris (PS05X)   [1215] Really?
Norrine (PS101) [1216] And she likes her very much and erm ... I told you she
                [...] by chance [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1217] Yes, indeed.
Norrine (PS101) [1218] And she spoke very highly of Suzannah.
Chris (PS05X)   [1219] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [1220] And said what a nice girl she was and what a good
                student and ... Suzannah said oh that's cos I won that make up
                competition.
Chris (PS05X)   [1221] [laugh] Right, I should get on.
*** 12 (Tape 002012) ***
Chris (PS05X) [1222] I was rather irritated yesterday because I had a phone
              call from ...
Lynda (PS102) [1223] Yes?
Chris (PS05X) [1224] And he called Gary saying we don't have the P elevens.
              [1225] And I ... I said oh well that's fair enough so I dug them
              out and sent them to him.
              [1226] And after I'd stamped and sealed the envelopes ... he rang
              back he said I haven't got the copy VAT certs either.
              [1227] I was not pleased at that!
              [1228] And I, wouldn't have occurred to me to send the P elevens.
Lynda (PS102) [1229] Actually that's not true either because I sent the P
              elevens to Steve and Matthew ... for his approval before we sent
              them off.
Chris (PS05X) [1230] And he sent them back again?
Lynda (PS102) [1231] Erm.
              [1232] ... I don't know whether he sent them back.
              [1233] I sent [...] , I didn't send him the originals I sent a
              copy.
Chris (PS05X) [1234] Oh right.
Lynda (PS102) [1235] I doubt that he sent them back.
Chris (PS05X) [1236] Oh well, I I've sent the ones from the drawer
Lynda (PS102) [1237] Fine.
Chris (PS05X) [1238] off and said I want them back!
Lynda (PS102) [1239] Oh right.
Chris (PS05X) [1240] And he said fine.
Lynda (PS102) [1241] We haven't got copies of them [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [1242] No.
              [1243] That that, well ... you know if there's a query in the
              next fortnight we know where they are don't we?
              [1244] But I was annoyed and I thought well that's fair enough
              because I wasn't aware that those particular documents were
              required by the accountants to sort things out, but
Lynda (PS102) [1245] Why were they required?
Chris (PS05X) [1246] I don't know.
              [1247] I didn't ask him but he said he required them.
              [1248] But I know that copy VAT certs, the VAT certs, VAT payment
              return, returns that's what they're called aren't they, are
              required.
              [1249] And so we hadn't sent them. ...
Lynda (PS102) [1250] Oh.
Chris (PS05X) [1251] Down to our [...] that is.
Lynda (PS102) [1252] Well where were they?
Chris (PS05X) [1253] Well they're here in the ... drawer where they're kept.
              [1254] There's there's a VAT file in there and that's where they
              get put.
              [1255] ... Bit silly isn't it?
              [1256] ... This is a unhelpful [...] because ... it's winding
              that way yet it looks as if it's winding that way, doesn't it?
Lynda (PS102) [1257] What onto the spool here?
Chris (PS05X) [1258] It looks as if it's reeling on to that spool.
Lynda (PS102) [1259] Yes.
              [1260] But it's reeling onto that one?
Chris (PS05X) [1261] It's not it's reeling through there.
              [1262] Very confusing and the fact that they've stuck that label
              on there doesn't help very much either.
Lynda (PS102) [1263] No, so, when it's full you have to put another tape in,
              does it
Chris (PS05X) [1264] Yes.
Lynda (PS102) [1265] click or does it?
Chris (PS05X) [1266] I don't know.
              [1267] I thought it would actually reversed on the first side.
              [1268] Erm
Lynda (PS102) [1269] And do the other side.
Chris (PS05X) [1270] Yes and I thought it was mucking it up so I just swapped
              it over the way it was.
              [1271] Erm we shall see.
              [1272] We shall see.
Lynda (PS102) [1273] It doesn't tell you [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [1274] Well it it tells you quite a lot, but it doesn't actually
              mention that bit [...] .
              [1275] I've got, I have got oodles of instructions here.
*** 13 (Tape 002013) ***
Chris (PS05X) [1276] It appears that on that erm walk the erm ... sort of
              pilgrimage walk.
              [1277] The B B C Songs of Praise television team were involved on
              all four days.
Lynda (PS102) [1278] Oh.
Chris (PS05X) [1279] Erm ... they were at the start they were at the finish and
              ... both days in between.
              [1280] Erm what's his name Alan Titchmarsh was doing the
              interviewing.
              [1281] And you might just see me in the background of one of the
              shots.
Lynda (PS102) [1282] Right.
              [1283] When's that being broadcast?
Chris (PS05X) [1284] I believe it's a special Songs of Praise in the summer to
              do with pilgrimages.
              [1285] ... Peter was saying what er a good do it was how it had
              all gone well.
Lynda (PS102) [1286] How much did it make?
Chris (PS05X) [1287] He doesn't know, he said we've certainly broken even but
              beyond that he's he's not [...] .
Lynda (PS102) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1288] Well I hope so too but it wasn't the whole object of the
              exercise.
              [1289] Publicity for homelessness was part of the business and I
              know one lad ... said he'd only got two pounds of sponsorship and
              er I thought well you've [...] you've done rather well to get two
              quid [laugh] .
              [1290] There was some fairly erm basic types on that walk.
              [1291] You know you could you could well understand that they
              were homeless.
Lynda (PS102) [1292] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [1293] Hi Susan how are you?
Susan (PS103) [1294] Hi Chris.
              [1295] Fine thank you.
Chris (PS05X) [1296] Good good good.
              [1297] Geared up for the hols?
Susan (PS103) [1298] Look like you've got your ... speaker on?
Chris (PS05X) [1299] I have.
Susan (PS103) [1300] Ah.
Chris (PS05X) [1301] I have.
Susan (PS103) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1302] Yes, yes yes.
              [1303] Yes.
              [1304] Are you ready to go, next week?
              [1305] Next Friday you go?
Susan (PS103) [1306] Yes, that's right, yes.
Lynda (PS102) [1307] It's a week away she got [...] washing at the moment.
Susan (PS103) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1308] [laugh] .
Lynda (PS102) [1309] I'm going to wear it all again before Friday.
Susan (PS103) [1310] Well I know [...] .
              [1311] Can I borrow your photocopier please?
Chris (PS05X) [1312] With great pleasure, yes.
              [1313] How many would you like?
Susan (PS103) [1314] Just one off that please.
Chris (PS05X) [1315] Right.
              [1316] Pleasure.
*** 14 (Tape 002014) ***
Chris (PS05X) [1317] N ah, we've still got a few marks on here haven't we
              Lynda?
Lynda (PS102) [1318] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [1319] Not many but er there are a few.
              [1320] Trouble is this, this is a spotty original too.
              [1321] ... There you are Susan.
Susan (PS103) [1322] Thank you.
              [1323] Don't worry too much it's only [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [1324] It's er, these these these these spots are on your
              original.
Susan (PS103) [1325] Yes.
              [1326] That's O K cos that's a copy too.
Chris (PS05X) [1327] But we've added a few you see and we're concerned about
              the spots.
Susan (PS103) [1328] It's only ... it's very rough [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1329] It's what you need anyway isn't it?
Susan (PS103) [1330] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [...] ...
Lynda (PS102) [1331] [...] Just wondering what she sent to Barry cos the copies
              of [...] are here.
Chris (PS05X) [1332] I sent him the originals.
              [1333] P elevens not P eleven D's.
              [1334] Your records ...
Lynda (PS102) [1335] Oh.
Chris (PS05X) [1336] your double fold two, two tone blue and white ...
              thingies.
Lynda (PS102) [1337] Oh the erm
Chris (PS05X) [1338] Cards.
Lynda (PS102) [1339] Deductions working sheets, those things?
Chris (PS05X) [1340] If that's what they're called, yes.
              [1341] Are they called P elevens?
Lynda (PS102) [1342] Yeah they are.
              [1343] You knew that. [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1344] Well they're a full record of all the ... deductions and
              so on and so forth aren't they?
              [1345] May be there's no other full record.
              [1346] But I I don't know, he didn't say and I wasn't going to
              argue with him on it.
Lynda (PS102) [1347] I though it was the eleven D's you were talking about.
Chris (PS05X) [1348] No no.
Lynda (PS102) [1349] Oh in that case oh yeah I had those.
Chris (PS05X) [1350] Yeah.
Lynda (PS102) [1351] They've never ever had those.
              [1352] They have never had them.
Chris (PS05X) [1353] They they seem to come up with something new every year
              don't they?
Lynda (PS102) [1354] Exactly.
              [1355] I mean I've been doing that for ever since we've been on
              [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [1356] Yes quite.
Lynda (PS102) [1357] How peculiar.
              [1358] ... Ah well.
              [1359] ... Oh yes they'd have been paid [...] wouldn't they?
Chris (PS05X) [1360] Yes they would they certainly would.
*** 15 (Tape 002016) ***
Norrine (PS101) [1361] [...] pay the cleaners.
                [1362] Anything else?
Chris (PS05X)   [1363] I'm sorry.
                [1364] You're going where?
Norrine (PS101) [1365] [...] anything else?
                [1366] I'm going to Eltham to get some material I hope.
Chris (PS05X)   [1367] No there's nothing else I need thank you.
Norrine (PS101) [1368] [...] bring you anything Lynda?
Lynda (PS102)   [1369] No thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [1370] She could use a Mars Bar you could [laugh] .
                [1371] You could just sort of tuck it in here under her
                waistband.
                [1372] ... Save her swallowing it.
Norrine (PS101) [1373] [...] Dorothy was saying on the radio there was a
                programme about teeth.
                [1374] And they said within fifty years false teeth will be a
                thing of the past.
                [1375] Nobody will need to wear them any more.
                [1376] Dentists are doing such wonderful
Chris (PS05X)   [1377] We probably won't need teeth we'll all be eating gruel
                all day.
Norrine (PS101) [1378] things to people's teeth and people's teeth today are so
                much better than ... the past.
Chris (PS05X)   [1379] Yes.
                [1380] Interesting.
Lynda (PS102)   [1381] Well it's too late for me.
Norrine (PS101) [1382] Ah shame.
Chris (PS05X)   [1383] You haven't got false teeth.
Lynda (PS102)   [1384] Pardon?
Chris (PS05X)   [1385] You haven't got any false teeth.
Lynda (PS102)   [1386] Not yet, no.
                [1387] But I might do in the next fifty years [...] any of
                them.
Chris (PS05X)   [1388] Oh we'll feed you on gruel dear don't worry.
Norrine (PS101) [1389] You might be needing your own [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1390] What flavour gruel would you like?
Lynda (PS102)   [1391] I don't think I'll mind really.
Norrine (PS101) [1392] Strawberry.
Chris (PS05X)   [1393] No I prefer, I prefer original.
                [1394] Salt and vinegar.
                [1395] ... Yes alright whisky flavour wheat.
                [1396] With salt and vinegar lumps.
                [1397] ... Oh that green looks really gorgeous with your

Lynda (PS102) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1410] Oh it's business is it?
Lynda (PS102) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1411] Amazing.
              [1412] Amazing.

Lynda (PS102) [1414] [...] good [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1415] Of course they are.
              [1416] Yes.
              [1417] I mean it it's really quite fascinating that isn't it?
              [1418] They are making the bank a lot of money.
Lynda (PS102) [1419] Yes.
              [1420] [...] playing golf this morning having a posh lunch and
              then playing golf this afternoon then having a buffet supper with
              prize giving.

*** 17 (Tape 002018) ***
Lynda (PS102) [1422] Yes.
              [1423] He looks like Sean Connery.
              [1424] I offered to carry, pleaded [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1425] Oh Lynda!
              [1426] Yes, well you'd be cramping his style wouldn't you?
              [1427] Yes.
Lynda (PS102) [1428] [laugh] And er ... he had a partner, an equal partner who
              I don't know if he'd ever met him, I think he had.
              [1429] Well he was out playing golf ... fairly recently he just
              dropped dead.
              [1430] Forty eight.
              [1431] ... keeled over and died.
              [1432] So I'm amazed this guy's
Chris (PS05X) [1433] I hope it wasn't on the green.
Lynda (PS102) [1434] So do I.
Chris (PS05X) [1435] Dent, dent the turf.
              [1436] Gosh.
              [1437] I hope he didn't bleed or anything like that.
Lynda (PS102) [1438] I think he, you know, quite clean corpse.
              [1439] From what I gather.
              [1440] I would have thought it would have put his partner off
              playing golf for life.
Chris (PS05X) [1441] Yes.
              [1442] You'd have thought so wouldn't you?
              [1443] Still I imagine many men would say what a way to go.
Lynda (PS102) [1444] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [1445] I wouldn't.
              [1446] Far better way to go than that but ...
Lynda (PS102) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1447] Who knows I might even get a chance to try one of these
              days.
Lynda (PS102) [1448] As long as you don't die with bells on your ankles. [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1449] [laugh] .
              [1450] Well then at least I'm [...] they'd bury me with bells on
              my ankles then.
Lynda (PS102) [1451] [...] bills have my name, it's obviously hiding. [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1452] Now erm ... you did bring a ... a very good point there

              [1458] But I'll see if I can find ... [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [1459] I would have thought that he would have been down slightly
              more ... less
Lynda (PS102) [1460] Illegible [...]
Chris (PS05X) [1461] [...] proportions, yes.

Lynda (PS102) [1462] He's quite a nice old dear really.
Chris (PS05X) [1463] Yes, his not a bad old stick, but erm, he's so very
              difficult to actually fathom isn't he?
Lynda (PS102) [1464] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [1465] Erm, I don't think his as thick as he cames across to me
              sometimes .
Lynda (PS102) [1466] Did he say his name's not William?
Chris (PS05X) [1467] Oh he said he prefers to be called Liam or something [...]
              .
Lynda (PS102) [1468] Oh what, without the wit [laugh] .
              [1469] His initial is W.
Chris (PS05X) [1470] Yes, yes, he is William, erm,the there are sixteen of the
              item outstanding on this order, eight required on this order and
              he says they haven't quite tested eight yet.
              [1471] Some of the have passed test but they haven't quite got to
              eight yet, so erm.
Lynda (PS102) [1472] [...] .
              [1473] That's the one that was due today.
Chris (PS05X) [1474] Yes, yes, erm, he said they may well have done sufficient
              of them by Monday.
Lynda (PS102) [1475] But it sounds as though everything [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [1476] He said the rest of it's on schedule.
Lynda (PS102) [1477] Ah right .
Chris (PS05X) [1478] Yes , his looked at it in the last couple of days, so he
              said within within another week or so he's having the whole done
              [...] with them.
Lynda (PS102) [1479] Good.
Chris (PS05X) [1480] Goody goody goody woof woof woof ... I can see exactly
              what this guy's means [...] about eh, huh, anything, anything in
              laboratories because the, the range of stuff in these magazines
              is phenomenal.
Lynda (PS102) [1481] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [1482] Absolutely incredible.
              [1483] So I think what'll do is contact one or two of British
              companies with probably way out stuff and just see if there set
              up in Japan.

                got three yards and I needed four and a half.

                got a frill and no sleeves, and the little ones got puff
                sleeves and high neck.
Lynda (PS102)   [1547] Hm.

                bridesmaid's and have these dresses and Anna thought the colour
                was so pretty, cos she went into Laura Ashley and got one in

                colour of the net, I suspect, that when
Norrine (PS101) [1560] Trouble with it?
Chris (PS05X)   [1561] when it's a single thickness strong the colour won't be
                as strong as that anyway .

Chris (PS05X)   [1563] No.
Norrine (PS101) [1564] The underneath.

Norrine (PS101) [1566] Veronica said if you can't get anything the right
                colour, get white, but white got a very starkly difference.

                natural teaching ability or merely a wish to try it?
Chris (PS05X)   [1923] Maybe eighteen is not the right age to be recruiting
                teachers.
Norrine (PS101) [1924] [...] recruit [...] .
                [1925] Well how do you know you're going to be a doctor, or
                anything when you're eighteen then, you know, you can't, you're
                teaching [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1926] No, I accept it.
                [1927] Accept that.
Norrine (PS101) [1928] I mean it is a longer training now, what it used to be.
                [1929] [...] standard is required.
                [1930] I think you need a lot of knowledge, especially nowadays
                when they're insisting on all this national curriculum, you've
                got to have a very broad ability.
                [1931] And then of course you need and you're going to avoid
                chance like this and [...] or whoever you [...] .
                [1932] You've got to be educated in child development and child
                psychology and the emotional development of children as well as
                their physical and educational intellectual
Chris (PS05X)   [1933] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [1934] You've got to have all that side of it, and if you're in
                teaching it's a bit ridiculous to be in any job if you don't
                know something about the history of it.
                [1935] I mean no one 's suggesting doctors sit and learn all
                the theory of and the history of the development of medicine,
                but I'm sure that it's important to have some knowledge of your
                area.
Chris (PS05X)   [1936] Mm.
                [1937] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1938] So you wouldn't just push it all out, and how do you
                discuss new educational reforms if you haven't any idea about
                the original ... previous ...
Chris (PS05X)   [1939] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1940] reformat I mean you've got to be you, knowledgable about
                your, the area in which you work, so I don't think you can just
                wipe out the history of education that's irrelevant.
Chris (PS05X)   [1941] No.
Norrine (PS101) [1942] In fact there's a great argument teaching teachers a lot
                more about the legal areas these days as a [...] teaching.
                [1943] Instead of just relying on your union, [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1944] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1945] Knowing your responsibilities and your rights.
                [1946] [...] there's a four year [...] , you think they'd [...]
                fit quite a lot into that, cos a lot of it is holiday.
Chris (PS05X)   [1947] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [1948] [...] and a lot of it erm, teaching [...] .
                [1949] Teaching [...] , terribly important, but I suppose
                teaching [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1950] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1951] Not just [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1952] Yes indeed.
Norrine (PS101) [1953] You know, you need to be really helpful when your
                teachers, your class you're put in to.
                [1954] [...] responsibility as well as the next college
                lecturers, that'll help you.
Chris (PS05X)   [1955] Yes indeed.
Norrine (PS101) [1956] Which isn't [...] .
                [1957] Would you like coffee and biscuits or would you like
                some fruit or a piece of bread and jam or what do you fancy?
Chris (PS05X)   [1958] I'll have some fruit first please.
                [1959] It's quite a lurid apple isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1960] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1961] I didn't get round to ringing Christine last night.
Norrine (PS101) [1962] I couldn't get through to [...] yes her number's still
                engaged, unless it's been reported.
Chris (PS05X)   [1963] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [1964] She might have just had it off the hook yesterday.
Chris (PS05X)   [1965] Come on [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [1966] Students with O A level passes for ninety three percent
                of training teachers [...] ... Eight out of ten graduates have
                a good second class honours degree.
                [1967] It's not such a high percentage in maths as it is [...]
                ... Twelve and a half thousand early retirements in eighty
                nine.
Chris (PS05X)   [1968] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [1969] Four thousand retirements through ill health, doubles
                the number to eighty seven.
Chris (PS05X)   [1970] Aha.
Norrine (PS101) [1971] A good honours graduate now has a starting salary of
                eleven thousand five hundred, why should good honours graduate
                teachers earn fifty percent [...] medical, medical
                practitioner, seventy five percent less than new accountants or
                eighty percent less than new civil engineers?
Chris (PS05X)   [1972] Yes, it's not, they've turned it into a total university
                trained job erm, people haven't given [...] award.
Norrine (PS101) [1973] Well apparently used to be [...] trained [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [1974] No, [...] taken them, they're taken to be professionals
                though aren't they?
Norrine (PS101) [1975] That would be the theory.
Chris (PS05X)   [1976] Professionally speaking.
                [1977] I've never had taken that.
Norrine (PS101) [1978] [...] Educational is not seen as a vital part of
                national right, that must be somebody [...] ... The wages
                earned by unskilled workers in Germany are twice as high as
                those earned by teachers here ...
Chris (PS05X)   [1979] [...] likely don't it? ...
Norrine (PS101) [1980] [...] across the board [...] trouble is when you get
                these differential [...] spend all the interpretation on them,
                not that you're rewarding the good teachers but that some
                teachers are not worth rewarding.
                [1981] Now if you really are a weak teacher ...
Chris (PS05X)   [1982] [...] out.
Norrine (PS101) [1983] Then your ... then your feelings perhaps don't matter in
                the overall picture of the education, but bearing in, looking
                at the teachers in our school, we, we really don't have a weak
                teacher except perhaps Mr , who's obviously not been well these
                last three years, erm
Chris (PS05X)   [1984] He is weak on discipline.
Norrine (PS101) [1985] He is very high in his guild his musical know, gets a
                lot of work from the children and the children really like his
                classes.
Chris (PS05X)   [1986] So does that mean that he is a good teacher of music,
                he's just not a good disciplinarian?
Norrine (PS101) [1987] To be a teacher you've got to have control of your
                children and you can't [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [1988] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [1989] possible, however good you are at your subject.
Chris (PS05X)   [1990] Right, right.
Norrine (PS101) [1991] You must have control of your class, sometimes if you
                don't, under, when I say he's a weak teacher I don't mean he's
                a bad teacher.
                [1992] I wouldn't single him out, I would just say he's not a
                strong teacher for the reason that he's only got part of it
                under his belt properly yet.
Chris (PS05X)   [1993] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [1994] But, you know, you can't, you might say well this
                teacher doesn't have such good displays on her wall, but then
                she might be ever so good at another area, I mean is not a
                display lady, she doesn't have artistic creative sort of flair
                like say Polly did
Chris (PS05X)   [1995] [...] Yep.
Norrine (PS101) [1996] but ...
Chris (PS05X)   [1997] Well there's nobody in this school has it like Polly
                did.
Norrine (PS101) [1998] Well ... Ms 's pretty good.
Chris (PS05X)   [1999] Is she?
Norrine (PS101) [2000] And Vicky is very good.
Chris (PS05X)   [2001] Mm, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2002] And Polly always used to say how good Lynn was, reckoned
                she could make a good career in designer living.
Chris (PS05X)   [2003] Oh yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [2004] Erm [sniff] but Jan is one of the best organizers [...]
                that I know.
Chris (PS05X)   [2005] Is she?
Norrine (PS101) [2006] She covers [...] .
                [2007] She's terribly thorough.
Chris (PS05X)   [2008] Mhm.
Norrine (PS101) [2009] And her children are very, very well grounded.
Chris (PS05X)   [2010] Are they?
                [2011] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2012] You know, they, they really are.
                [2013] And that's a greatest skill in itself.
Chris (PS05X)   [2014] Mm ... Yes, [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [2015] Everybody's got their [...] , erm what's her name, Jill
                from New Zealand, is quite young, but she has all the potential
                of being an excellent teacher, she's, she's very enthusiastic,
                very straightforward, she's ...
Chris (PS05X)   [2016] What'll her experience that she had in New Zealand?
Norrine (PS101) [2017] I think it was [...] Hong Kong, she had it.
Chris (PS05X)   [2018] Oh really.
Norrine (PS101) [2019] She had been teaching [...] New Zealand, erm, not quite
                such a long training so she's had three or four years'
                experience.
Chris (PS05X)   [2020] Mhm.
Norrine (PS101) [2021] She was teaching in a private school in this country
                before she came to us.
Chris (PS05X)   [2022] Was she now.
                [2023] Oh she's not still learning then?
Norrine (PS101) [2024] No, but she is young all the same.
Chris (PS05X)   [2025] Is she erm
Norrine (PS101) [2026] But she's a very good, keen teacher.
Chris (PS05X)   [2027] Yep.
Norrine (PS101) [2028] But you wouldn't expect her to be as experienced as
                Maureen.
Chris (PS05X)   [2029] No, of course not.
Norrine (PS101) [2030] But in, on her level she's a very good teacher.
Chris (PS05X)   [2031] Yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [2032] And brings a different quality to her class.
Chris (PS05X)   [2033] Yes ...
Norrine (PS101) [2034] And Vicky's very good, Vicky's somewhat disorganised
                really.
Chris (PS05X)   [2035] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [2036] Work in something of a muddle, but Vicky has a great eye
                for detail.
Chris (PS05X)   [2037] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [2038] With enormous patience as well as huge fund of knowledge
                and skill, she's a very talented girl.
Chris (PS05X)   [2039] Mhm.
Norrine (PS101) [2040] For herself ... Tanya's good [...] talented as well.
Chris (PS05X)   [2041] Is she?
Norrine (PS101) [2042] She plays the flute and her guitar very nicely, singing
                in several choir [...] .

                [2044] Being cold, you know, you can give merit two of your
                teachers who meant to deserve it.
Chris (PS05X)   [2045] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2046] Well what [...] .

Chris (PS05X)   [2057] They are already being rewarded.
Norrine (PS101) [2058] No, it's a bit of a ... it's a bit of a strange thing

Chris (PS05X)   [2075] Good grief.
                [2076] Where was that? ...
Norrine (PS101) [2077] Exeter.
Chris (PS05X)   [2078] Don't get ill in Exeter.
Norrine (PS101) [2079] [cough] ... There's a comment on the [...] saying that,

                but they wanted to know whether they would have equal rights as
                parents
Chris (PS05X)   [2083] Aha.
Norrine (PS101) [2084] could they draw up a contract, saying that they would
                share?
Chris (PS05X)   [2085] Mm mm.
Norrine (PS101) [2086] And he said yes you can, but it would do you no good at
                all, cos if the point came when you split up the judge wouldn't
                look at your contract, he would only consider the rights of the
                child.
Chris (PS05X)   [2087] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [2088] That explains why Brian didn't get a look in.

Chris (PS05X)   [2131] In Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, drivers will
                have to use dipped headlights in daylight from nineteen ninety
                two.
Norrine (PS101) [2132] Where in Luxembourg did you say?
Chris (PS05X)   [2133] [...] Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg.
Norrine (PS101) [2134] Head ... headlights in daylight.
Chris (PS05X)   [2135] In daylight.
                [2136] It's, it's very normal in Scandinavia, most drivers
                there use their dipped headlights in daylight.
Norrine (PS101) [2137] Well yes, we all know they live in the land of the
                midnight sun when it's dark all the time.
Chris (PS05X)   [2138] No, they, they're not talking about that , not talking
                about that.
Norrine (PS101) [2139] Oh you'll be happy darling.
Chris (PS05X)   [2140] Sure.
                [2141] Mind you anybody would think that I sold headlights.
Norrine (PS101) [2142] Probably do that's why.

                it.

Chris (PS05X)   [2144] A quarter of drivers leave their cars unlocked, I think
                it's rather more than that in the summer.
Norrine (PS101) [2145] I lock mine even in the drive here.
Chris (PS05X)   [2146] Mm, try to.
Norrine (PS101) [2147] What do you mean, I try to?
Chris (PS05X)   [2148] Can't get the key in the lock sometimes.
Norrine (PS101) [2149] You mean in your lock, why what's the problem?
                [2150] Shaky hand or ...
Chris (PS05X)   [2151] Room against the fence.
Norrine (PS101) [2152] How do you manage to get out?
Chris (PS05X)   [2153] Don't know, just slippery as an eel.

Norrine (PS101) [2173] Probably a lot of standing about.

Chris (PS05X)   [2175] I don't think the two of you will find it particularly

Chris (PS05X) [2372] They ...
Lynda (PS102) [2373] Out of the blue?
Chris (PS05X) [2374] Well hardly out of the blue, they asked for it a week ago.
              [laugh]
Lynda (PS102) [2375] I see.
Chris (PS05X) [2376] [...] though that again is questionable.
              [2377] The implication has been all along that they're using the
              same United States manufacturing source but in fact there are one
              or two discrepancies here, erm, because the value is so high, I'm
              actually sort of going through and looking at everything ...
              pretty closely, and they've changed the basis so wow, [...] .
              [2378] Cos we're talking of the same product, one, one, quotes
              ninety six dollars and the other quotes a hundred and thirty
              seven dollars.
Lynda (PS102) [2379] That's a [...] different.
Chris (PS05X) [2380] That's quite enough to want to treble check isn't it?

Lynda (PS102) [2384] [...] what have they said about the offer they've had
              already?
Chris (PS05X) [2385] Erm, yes they have,for ... forgive me, I'll just finish
              this if you don't mind, I'm, I'm almost there, one O ten point
              three eight.

              Associates and I and ...
Lynda (PS102) [2387] Is there a deadline on it?
Chris (PS05X) [2388] Not as such so they're pressing for an answer, the
              factory, but erm, he came back and said we'd need firm prices,
              per kilo price, lump sum price not acceptable, customer offer of
              sixteen Deutschmark per kilo from [...] , for twelve to fourteen

              and elsie transfers on opening and presentation.
              [2391] I wrote back saying, get on with it, and incidentally we
              overestimated the shipment cost, brought it down to about half,
              got to be awfully careful there, because some of these bits are
              so big, they [...] , and today he said, customer will make
              decision only after ten days, since final size of assortment is
              under preparation, meantime with your offered price and revised
              delivery time, it looks very difficult to book this order.
              [2392] Price of electrodes is, seems alright, however plate
              prices are very high.
              [2393] Please offer per piece or kilo.
              [2394] Now have changed it from per kilo to per piece.
Lynda (PS102) [2395] How had you offered [...] ?

Lynda (PS102) [2413] Wasn't what you were expecting was it?
Chris (PS05X) [2414] No, I think that might be because it doesn't include the

Lynda (PS102) [2434] What would you do re-offer the whole thing?
Chris (PS05X) [2435] Yes I'm going to.

Chris (PS05X)   [2461] Quite deliberately, because, that, I mean, his part of

              amazing amount of labour saving gear, like electric hedge shears
              trimmers, and erm
Lynda (PS102) [2719] Graham's got that.
Chris (PS05X) [2720] He ... he ... he's got erm a pump for the erm, hosepipe,
              so that when he hoses the front or the car he's really got a
              spurt, yes, yes, he actually put's the hose in one side and goes
              sh shoots it out again.
Lynda (PS102) [2721] [...] [...] long enough.
Chris (PS05X) [2722] Well if you're gonna get the bottom of the garden where

              and doing as he was watering the new grass on the front he ... he
              I mean yes he is below it it's the bottom of your storage tank in

              thing so that we don't get the kitchen sink, which is also off

              why mine isn't as good as it could be, yes you're right [...] .
Lynda (PS102) [2728] [...] actually quite strong, and I use the hose to rinse,

Lynda (PS102) [2742] Yeah, I came to the conclusion I couldn't afford any of
              it.
Chris (PS05X) [2743] Ah, I thought perhaps you, you anticipated a husband
              without an arm or something.
Lynda (PS102) [2744] No that [...] consideration, I think, you know if he
              didn't kill himself with a chainsaw he'd probably be alright with
              the [laugh] shredder.
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
Lynda (PS102) [2745] I really thought we was going to end with erm, [...] , cos

                was behind the other, but I saw the plan last time and, and,
                and it didn't look quite bad.

Norrine (PS101) [2878] What, only in the last couple of days?
Chris (PS05X)   [2879] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2880] That's nothing.
Chris (PS05X)   [2881] Er we're going to [...] Mottingham's centre aren't we?
                [2882] Gardening centre.
Norrine (PS101) [2883] No, it's not a gardening centre, it's a shop [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [2884] Oh whereabouts?
Norrine (PS101) [2885] In the shopping parade, I'll show you where it is.
Chris (PS05X)   [2886] Oh I see, right oh.
                [2887] Yes
Norrine (PS101) [2888] They have place that Rosemary mentioned, it's only
                opened on Saturdays.
Chris (PS05X)   [2889] Yes.
*** 83 (Tape 002317) ***
Norrine (PS101) [2890] But erm, Liz is getting hassle from her insurance
                company about her claim on her new door.
Chris (PS05X)   [2891] Oh yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2892] No what happened?
Chris (PS05X)   [2893] No I don't remember your telling me.
Norrine (PS101) [2894] When Suzannah went down there, [...] from last, she was
                strap strapping Layla into the back seat
Chris (PS05X)   [2895] Mhm.
Norrine (PS101) [2896] for Liz, while Liz went into the house to get something,
                and someone came down Hurst Road, misjudged it, and scrapped
                the car door, bashed Lizzie's side and scraped along side of
                her car, as she drove past [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [2897] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2898] And it meant a respray on her car and a new door for
                Lizzie's car, sit down.
Chris (PS05X)   [2899] Right.
Norrine (PS101) [2900] And Jim said she was going far too fast, took up all
                three car lengths, parked cars to stop.
Chris (PS05X)   [2901] Phew.
Norrine (PS101) [2902] And, and obviously she was going to [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [2903] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2904] And [...] happened, opened the door any wider, cos she
                was still strapping the child in.
                [2905] Of which she had been doing as Liz left the car.
Chris (PS05X)   [2906] Yes.
                [2907] Was Suzannah hurt?
Norrine (PS101) [2908] No, she wasn't, only the car door.
Chris (PS05X)   [2909] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2910] But now Lizzie's insurance company have said they'll do
                what they can for her, but as she had opened the door into the
                oncoming traffic, probably was her fault.
Chris (PS05X)   [2911] And this took place in Hurst Road?
                [2912] I mean ...
Norrine (PS101) [2913] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [2914] tha ... that's a bit of a nonsense to my mind.
Norrine (PS101) [2915] Well exactly, I mean there's double parking in a single
                line and the lady [...] weary.
Chris (PS05X)   [2916] You can't move at more than about fifteen miles an hour
                maximum down Hurst Road anyway can you?
Norrine (PS101) [2917] [...] Anyway, Liz is a bit annoyed because she doesn't
                want to lose her no claims bonus.
Chris (PS05X)   [2918] Absolutely.
                [2919] Absolutely right, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2920] And I feel in a way slightly responsible that it was
                Suzannah.
Chris (PS05X)   [2921] Well I don't suppose Suzannah was doing anything she
                shouldn't have been.
Norrine (PS101) [2922] No she wasn't, but even so, you know, I said that to
                Liz, Liz said oh it's not, it's nothing to do with your
                responsibility.
                [2923] E ... even so she has to pay the first something or
                other you, as one does in a claim
Chris (PS05X)   [2924] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2925] towards the new door.
Chris (PS05X)   [2926] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [2927] She said I've paid that, that's not a hassle or, anyway
                she's paid it, she's said that's not a hassle, but er, I
                thought well maybe I [...] some money, I don't know, what do
                you normally pay on these things, twenty five, twenty six?
Chris (PS05X)   [2928] Oh its variable.
Norrine (PS101) [2929] But it does, so, she said she hasn't got an up to date
                highway code knows anything about it about taking repair in
                narrow street [...] .
                [2930] Well I found a couple of possible useful quotes of the
                highway code.
Chris (PS05X)   [2931] Mm.
                [2932] Good.
Norrine (PS101) [2933] I, I'm going to [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [2934] [...] if you like.
Norrine (PS101) [2935] Well she, I gave her the ... the clause number thing.
Chris (PS05X)   [2936] Right ...
Norrine (PS101) [2937] [...] should be fighting for her on this not giving way
                [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [2938] Well I mean, who's her broker?
Norrine (PS101) [2939] She doesn't have one you see.
Chris (PS05X)   [2940] Oh, she should use Jeffrey hasn't she?
Norrine (PS101) [2941] No, she didn't say.
                [2942] She feels that they're not really interested as long as,
                you know
Chris (PS05X)   [2943] Well I wouldn't, I, I would recommend that you tell her
                to contact Jeffrey, say will you take this on for me please,
                and ca ... carry my car insurance for me in future.

Norrine (PS101) [3058] What a good dog.
Chris (PS05X)   [3059] They're really going to town on these pavements aren't

Chris (PS05X)   [3062] Mm.

Chris (PS05X)   [3079] Good.
Norrine (PS101) [3080] Just six weeks till the end of term because I've got my

Norrine (PS101) [3090] That all my reports will be done.

Chris (PS05X)   [3095] Did I tell you, I mentioned to er Ray about Phil and he
                remembered him.
Norrine (PS101) [3096] Yes I think you did.
Chris (PS05X)   [3097] Some conference in Eastbourne, or whatever.
Norrine (PS101) [3098] You ought to remember him from Becksley, surely [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3099] Well they didn't teach in the same place, so why should
                they?
Norrine (PS101) [3100] True.
Chris (PS05X)   [3101] Erm, I mean, they, they met occasionally, but er, no
                particular reason to remember.
                [3102] I had quite a good chat with Ray the other day, yes, eh.
Norrine (PS101) [3103] Paul looks better, I seen him rushing down the road at
                great speed to catch the train, not looking as white as he was
                a few months ago.
Chris (PS05X)   [3104] Really?
Norrine (PS101) [3105] In fact he's getting over his illness. [clock ticking]

Chris (PS05X)   [3114] Yes.

Norrine (PS101) [3116] Do, have you [...] somewhere.
Chris (PS05X)   [3117] Well, the green chain walk went up in through, into the

                [3124] Too fast.
Norrine (PS101) [3125] Does she find it busy?
Chris (PS05X)   [3126] Perhaps she can sell them a few sleeping policeman, I
                can't remember her saying so as such.
                [3127] I spoke to Tony today.
Norrine (PS101) [3128] Oh yeah, on what?
Chris (PS05X)   [3129] Oh, scientific instrumentation.

Chris (PS05X)   [3145] Well John was saying to me, that eh, Bill is such a

                will ensure that every single corner of that house will be
                immaculate and exactly the way he wants it, but it'll take him
                three or four years to do it.
Norrine (PS101) [3146] Oh, I think it took us about seven years to get every
                room in our house [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3147] Well, that, that was just to take down one reel of wall
                paper on.

Norrine (PS101) [3214] Whenever I planted it, I used to cut it right down.
Chris (PS05X)   [3215] Well I must say I much prefer it like that cos it covers
                up the ugly fence.
Norrine (PS101) [...]

Susan (PS103) [3315] Sorry.
Chris (PS05X) [3316] incidently it's not a good idea to leave the double

Norrine (PS101) [3343] Should've made them [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [3344] They were nice.

Susan (PS103)   [3346] No, different.
Chris (PS05X)   [3347] Different.
                [3348] What was the difference?
Susan (PS103)   [3349] Got prawns and garlic.
Chris (PS05X)   [3350] What the flavour in the prawns you mean?

Susan (PS103)   [3356] It's lovely.
Chris (PS05X)   [3357] Do you think I'm environmental?
Susan (PS103)   [3358] Why did they choose you to tape?
Chris (PS05X)   [3359] Ha, there was a knock at the door.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3360] Nah
Norrine (PS101) [3361] Nah or no?
Chris (PS05X)   [3362] I'm to explain roughly what they're up to, so I invited
                them in, they then explained exactly what they were up to ,
                [...] fine I'll do it.
Susan (PS103)   [3363] I'll be pleased.
Norrine (PS101) [3364] You can turn the radio off darling, we're not listening
                to it.
Susan (PS103)   [3365] They say you could borrow the Walkman?
Chris (PS05X)   [3366] They gave me, the equipment, and the tapes and the
                batteries and eh, the recorded paper and all the rest of it,
                cos that's part, essential part of the whole thing.
Norrine (PS101) [3367] You hang, handed back didn't you?
Chris (PS05X)   [3368] Oh yes, yes.
Susan (PS103)   [3369] How many people are they taking then?
Chris (PS05X)   [3370] I've no idea, I didn't ask.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3371] [...] what work they use, in general conversation these
                days.
Chris (PS05X)   [3372] Oh, accents, things like that.
                [3373] Spoken, spoken English as opposed to record of written
                English, that's the essence of it.
Susan (PS103)   [3374] If I'd taken it, the language [...] would be different.
Norrine (PS101) [3375] Of course, but I think they'll have a wide
Chris (PS05X)   [3376] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3377] variety of people, otherwise their research isn't valid,
                is it?
Chris (PS05X)   [3378] Yes, the, the lady in question was saying what, she had
                to have, I think, I think what she was saying was, that for
                every person over forty five she had to have somebody under
                forty five.
Norrine (PS101) [3379] Presumably the same number of men as women and
Chris (PS05X)   [3380] Yeah, probably.
Susan (PS103)   [3381] What, do you have to stand there when you walk down the
                street, and when you go to [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3382] Only when you're having a conversation.
Chris (PS05X)   [3383] When I answer the telephone, I switch it off.
                [3384] I done that numerous times today ... but I'm trying to
                do it right by keeping it going all the time when I'm likely to
                be in conversation, so there are occasional blank spaces on the
                tapes.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3385] It was quite funny yesterday, because, he, when I went
                out in the garden there was a football nestling in the rose
                bushes, I heaved it back over the fence, thirty seconds later
                the two boys came roaring out of the house, and about thirty
                seconds after that
Susan (PS103)   [3386] It's back over again.
Chris (PS05X)   [3387] it, no, it's up in the app ... top of the apple tree,
                and they were chucking sticks at it, trying to get it down
                again.
Susan (PS103)   [3388] Why don't you just open the back gate so that they can
                come and collect their stuff when they want it?
Chris (PS05X)   [3389] Well I've said it actually, if you do it frequently you
                can't be bothered I suppose.
Norrine (PS101) [3390] Probably their dad said you mustn't go in there too
                often.
Chris (PS05X)   [3391] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3392] It takes [...] snob ...
Susan (PS103)   [3393] You'll be pleased to know dad, that I am going to go to
                the [...] tomorrow night.
Norrine (PS101) [3394] Oh
Chris (PS05X)   [3395] Oh no

Susan (PS103)   [3399] Going [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3400] Does she go there from time to time?
Susan (PS103)   [3401] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3402] Has she said there's much the same people there or
                different crowd?
Susan (PS103)   [3403] Same people really.
Norrine (PS101) [3404] Does she still see Judith?
Susan (PS103)   [3405] Judith [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3406] I find that hard to believe, how she [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3407] Pardon?
Susan (PS103)   [3408] Exactly.
Chris (PS05X)   [3409] So Sam doesn't like her either.
Susan (PS103)   [3410] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3411] It's not so much not liking, it's not really trusting
                people, like us.
Chris (PS05X)   [3412] I think not liking must come into it partly.
Susan (PS103)   [3413] Mm
Chris (PS05X)   [3414] Mean to say , that, that's the honest [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3415] It doesn't mean , it doesn't endear you to people does
                it?
Chris (PS05X)   [3416] No exactly, not likely my dear.
Susan (PS103)   [3417] No I don't dislike Judith.
Norrine (PS101) [3418] No, quite.
Chris (PS05X)   [3419] No.
Susan (PS103)   [3420] I just wouldn't, if she rang up and says [...] I'd say
                no thanks.
Chris (PS05X)   [3421] Yes quite.
Norrine (PS101) [3422] Thanks very much.
Chris (PS05X)   [3423] You don't like her.
Susan (PS103)   [3424] No.
Chris (PS05X)   [3425] You've no reason to like her.
Susan (PS103)   [3426] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [3427] Okay.
Norrine (PS101) [3428] Why somebody lets me down like that [...] .
                [3429] You're not, you don't trust them, you're not going to
                put yourself on the line [...] are you, suppose [...] .
                [3430] There's plenty of other people in the world.
                [3431] [...] you might think of some.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3432] She's not really very with it, is she?
                [3433] Not very intelligent.

                written down [...] .
                [3501] We've made some water bridges in a clay [...] which I
                have to put in the kiln on Monday, [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3502] Will your monster germ be part of the big show?
Norrine (PS101) [3503] Yes, he, I've got a lot of germ poems
Chris (PS05X)   [3504] Oh charming. [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [3505] and I've mounted them on green germ, but I'm going to
                put them on a table, and then hang the germs from the ceiling
                or something, round, cos I haven't got a board for that.
Chris (PS05X)   [3506] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3507] We were going to do a lot more work
Susan (PS103)   [3508] Hard luck.
Norrine (PS101) [3509] on germs and diseases and cuts and first aid things,
                after the St. John's Ambulance [...] , but since it never
                happened
Chris (PS05X)   [3510] No.
Norrine (PS101) [3511] Oh don't.
Chris (PS05X)   [3512] No, I shall, yes, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [3513] we didn't, we didn't carry on with it.
Chris (PS05X)   [3514] That was bad, Mrs should be taken to task for that.
Norrine (PS101) [3515] She misjudged it, she should of rung on the Friday.
Chris (PS05X)   [3516] She should have rung immediately and said there was a
                question mark.
Norrine (PS101) [3517] Well when she did it, well that was the Friday , when
                she did it
Chris (PS05X)   [3518] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [3519] and said what had happened, and I also spoken to Cathy.
                [3520] Cathy would have come
Chris (PS05X)   [3521] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [3522] or sent someone else.
Chris (PS05X)   [3523] Oh indeed she would, and Cathy would have been sensitive
                enough to appreciated the need of teeny weenies.
Norrine (PS101) [3524] Oh yes, [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3525] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3526] Another thing she couldn't step in, and do it over the
                head with someone who was supposed to be doing on that March.
Chris (PS05X)   [3527] No, no no, no.
Norrine (PS101) [3528] But having left till the morning when she was due, I
                couldn't even let Cathy know because it puts her in an awkward
                position, suddenly turn up on the day.
                [3529] But it was Friday she did it, and Thursday we were
                expecting her, so there would have been time when she had [...]
                .
                [3530] I mean she hadn't even let me know the night before.
Chris (PS05X)   [3531] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3532] It was only a chance that I rang her.
Chris (PS05X)   [3533] Yes, the, the night before.
Norrine (PS101) [3534] I rang her the night before to say what visual aid do
                you want, do you want the overhead projector, or the video or
                what would you like
Chris (PS05X)   [3535] [...] yes.
                [3536] Yes .
                [3537] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3538] cos she said she'd need something, but she hadn't
                specified it.
                [3539] I don't know what was in mind, then she told me, what
                the problem was.
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3540] Said I was going to get, ring you tomorrow morning if I
                couldn't come.
Chris (PS05X)   [3541] Very unprofessional, very unsuitable.
Norrine (PS101) [3542] But I was hoping I would be , be better.
                [3543] Now I don't know what to do, I was going to write to
                Cathy after [...] and thank her
Chris (PS05X)   [3544] Yes, quite.
Norrine (PS101) [3545] but now I don't know whether to pretend, just to leave
                it, or to say anything, don't want Cathy to think I was
                ungrateful.
Chris (PS05X)   [3546] I still haven't got my first aid certificate.
                [3547] I think perhaps, I shall contact Cyril, and say how
                about that drink we we've agreed to, we, we've enjoyed
                together?
Norrine (PS101) [3548] I should [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3549] Couple of months , well couple of months ago we said,
                you know, we live close enough for goodness sake let's get
                together one night.
Norrine (PS101) [3550] Yes.
                [3551] And you'll have a chat with him.
Chris (PS05X)   [3552] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [3553] Mention it.
Chris (PS05X)   [3554] Mentioned it, and then, [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3555] [...] quite embarrassed , cos she think [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3556] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [3557] Ring Cathy and mentioned it, but she was grateful for
                having interest.
Chris (PS05X)   [3558] Yep.
Norrine (PS101) [3559] I might be more inclined if [...] mentioned it and [...]
                hadn't said.
Chris (PS05X)   [cough]
Norrine (PS101) [3560] But Cathy has been coping with leukaemia.
Chris (PS05X)   [3561] So which I was told.
Norrine (PS101) [3562] Which I didn't know.
Susan (PS103)   [3563] Cathy who?
Chris (PS05X)   [3564] No nobody knows.
Norrine (PS101) [3565] , one of the old Greenwich [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [3566] She got leukaemia?
Norrine (PS101) [3567] Well she may be better now, I don't know anything about
                it except dad heard that she had had it, or was being treated
                for it.
Chris (PS05X)   [3568] Yes, yes.
Susan (PS103)   [3569] What's for pudding?
Norrine (PS101) [3570] Fruit.
                [3571] So I didn't want to burden her by being awkward about
                it, make her feel bad about it, equally I haven't really
                thanked her.
Chris (PS05X)   [3572] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3573] The only second phone call I had was to say what is
                happening.
Chris (PS05X)   [3574] Yes .
                [3575] Yes, well.
Norrine (PS101) [3576] She had contacted this Mrs , would you like to do some
                planting?
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3577] Well maybe nobody wants to.
Chris (PS05X)   [3578] Snoopy that's not the way you pass things round, it is?
                [3579] You pick up the dish and [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [3580] Well what do you want?
                [3581] You don't like these apple [...] now you're going to
                have an orange.
Chris (PS05X)   [3582] Very sweet of you to choose for me dear.
Norrine (PS101) [3583] I don't mind thank you.
                [3584] What can I do for you, an apple, nothing?
                [3585] Can you have half of one of these?
Chris (PS05X)   [3586] No thanks, I had that at lunch time didn't I?
                [3587] [laugh] I try to have two pieces of fruit a day, one
                being an orange the other an apple, or an alternative pear
                [...] [cough]
Susan (PS103)   [3588] Oh she doesn't have an apple.
Norrine (PS101) [3589] You had an apple today, you had that.
Chris (PS05X)   [3590] I had that extraordinary [...] cox yes.
Norrine (PS101) [3591] And did you have an orange too?
                [3592] No, I was the one that had the orange you didn't.
Chris (PS05X)   [3593] Oh [...] .
                [3594] Oh goody goody, I shall have an orange.
Norrine (PS101) [3595] You are allowed two a day.
Chris (PS05X)   [3596] I'll have that one. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3597] That's right.
Norrine (PS101) [3598] Where did you eat your lunch today?
Susan (PS103)   [3599] At [...] at college.
Norrine (PS101) [3600] Are you allowed to eat your own sandwiches in there?
Susan (PS103)   [3601] Yeah [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3602] Well I don't know, I'm [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3603] Lying in the park at the back I would have thought.
Susan (PS103)   [3604] Chilly it would be.
Chris (PS05X)   [3605] You're young enough not to notice.
Susan (PS103)   [3606] You [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3607] How many of your erm, friends actually bring sandwiches
                to
Susan (PS103)   [3608] They come, there's two of us Anita
Norrine (PS101) [3609] Sarah doesn't [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [3610] Yeah.
                [3611] [...] can't afford [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3612] Ha, sort of your situation isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [3613] Why don't you stay for school lunch instead of
                sandwiches?
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3614] Is there still a boycott at the canteen?
Susan (PS103)   [3615] No. [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3616] Is that because they've got fed up or because things
                have improved?
Susan (PS103)   [3617] Probably got fed up.
Chris (PS05X)   [3618] Nothing's improved [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3619] How can you [...] at college, I mean I know there's your
                course, but I didn't know about that until you enrolled for it.
                [3620] I've only heard of it at the fashion college.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3621] Hairdressing.
Susan (PS103)   [3622] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3623] Fashion.
Susan (PS103)   [3624] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3625] Beauty.
Susan (PS103)   [3626] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3627] Yeah, theatrical make-up.
Chris (PS05X)   [3628] Theatrical make-up, really?
Susan (PS103)   [3629] [...] .
                [3630] Theatrical [...] , erm, period costumes, [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3631] Millenary had a lovely old fashion rings.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3632] Do you only see the girls on model [...] ?
Susan (PS103)   [3633] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3634] What, has she finished her [...] ?
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3635] Good for her ...
Susan (PS103)   [3636] We, do you know what our canteen did?
                [3637] We paid for all these dodgy old ladies
Norrine (PS101) [huff]
Susan (PS103)   [3638] They did, they come in and they [...] us and then they
                go home again.
Norrine (PS101) [3639] Who are they?
Susan (PS103)   [3640] Nobody knows.
Chris (PS05X)   [3641] I think you should do a survey, approach them with a
                clipper board as they come in and say
Norrine (PS101) [3642] Which course you on?
Chris (PS05X)   [3643] delighted to see you, [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3644] Well it's a joke , because, they take up all the seats,
                like they're in two [...] seats of four, and a, there is no way
                you can [...] , half the students [...] , these silly old
                people come in and they take up four seats and eat our lunch.
Norrine (PS101) [3645] You [...] for everybody [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [3646] Yeah, but at times they're expensive.
Norrine (PS101) [3647] Shouldn't be, the more people that eat it, the cheaper
                it, the, should help keep the prices down.
Susan (PS103)   [3648] Yeah, but they do [...] though. [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3649] Certainly
Norrine (PS101) [3650] Perhaps it's the college's bit of charity.
Chris (PS05X)   [3651] Even the canteen staff don't know who they are.
Susan (PS103)   [3652] Bet they do.
Norrine (PS101) [3653] Ladies from the street, with poor with poor pensions .
Susan (PS103)   [3654] Yeah they're regulars, they come in every day.
Norrine (PS101) [3655] Mm .
Chris (PS05X)   [3656] [cough] I don't think, eh, [...] college of fashion
                should be supporting the ladies of the streets dear.
Susan (PS103)   [3657] I [...] like it though.
Norrine (PS101) [3658] Maybe they're the cleaners.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3659] You mean bag ladies or street ladies?
Susan (PS103)   [3660] Bag ladies.
Chris (PS05X)   [3661] Aha.
Susan (PS103)   [3662] I know they're definitely not cleaners.
Norrine (PS101) [3663] Do you [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [3664] No.
                [3665] Right, one woman she comes in, with an ice cream tub,
                and fills up with food and goes home, in an ice cream tub.
Norrine (PS101) [3666] She must be very poor.
Susan (PS103)   [3667] Erm you don't know you know because the more our college
                prices keep going up and up, B H S [...] on it, they are
                cheaper than our corned beef.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3668] Yeah, well, [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3669] Why do a, er, an old lady come in and fill up an ice
                cream tub, do you mean an old ice cream tub?
Susan (PS103)   [3670] Yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [3671] She brings one with her?
Susan (PS103)   [3672] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X)   [3673] So where she fill it up from?
Susan (PS103)   [3674] The canteen.
                [3675] The people fill it up for her.
Chris (PS05X)   [3676] Do you give her a little bit of they're [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3677] It's hers, put a [...]
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3678] Ice cream tub.
Chris (PS05X)   [3679] Does she pay for it?
Susan (PS103)   [3680] I don't think so.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3681] Strange business.
Susan (PS103)   [3682] Yeah, but [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3683] Maybe not.
Susan (PS103)   [3684] But then again the students' bar is ridiculously cheap.
Chris (PS05X)   [3685] Do they go into the bar?
Susan (PS103)   [3686] No.
                [3687] [...] thirty P for a coke.
                [3688] Fifty P for a Cinzano and lemonade, or whatever.
Chris (PS05X)   [3689] Mm, mm.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3690] What's a pint of bitter?
Susan (PS103)   [3691] Don't know [...] .
                [3692] You know, how come the bar managers
Norrine (PS101) [3693] Oh sorry Ella.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3694] erm, how come the bar meals used to be so cheap when the
                canteen's [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3695] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [3696] Of course, [cough] , there's a big profit. [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3697] It seems to me this student bar, does have to make a
                vast profit.
                [3698] Anyway it's probably run by students.
Susan (PS103)   [3699] [...] .
                [3700] Yeah it is.
Chris (PS05X)   [3701] Is there [...] bar [...] students?
                [3702] Is there a steward?
Norrine (PS101) [3703] Might be a man in charge, but they probably don't have
                to pay lots of wages.
Susan (PS103)   [3704] There is there No.
Norrine (PS101) [3705] And make lots of profit.
Susan (PS103)   [3706] [...] But, I don't think it makes any profit, but, you
                know, [...] profit.
Susan (PS103)   [3707] That's why it's cheap.
Chris (PS05X)   [3708] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [3709] Whereas pubs are different, they are out, they have to
                pay a lot of people and their rent and everything else and they
                are ours to make a profit.
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3710] [...] .
                [3711] Except for a small diversion and nibble some bits of
                lamb when I was cutting up the meat lunchtime, and to try and
                [...] serving of it.
Chris (PS05X)   [3712] When we were out front earlier today, Rocket tried to
                take a short cut across the front garden, Candy saw her off,
                like a [...] .
Susan (PS103)   [3713] Who's Rocket?
Chris (PS05X)   [3714] Petrol pussy cat.
Susan (PS103)   [3715] Don't say it like that, I've never met any of the
                labouring animals.
Norrine (PS101) [3716] Oh, it's a nice little young black and white cat, very
                white [...] Stray cat.
Susan (PS103)   [3717] [...] .
                [3718] Ah yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [3719] But Ella or Candy are not at all friendly.
Susan (PS103)   [3720] Tut.
                [3721] We know that though.
                [3722] Who's that [...] she used to beat poor [...] and
Norrine (PS101) [3723] No. [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3724] Really.
                [3725] Ha, ha, ha.
Susan (PS103)   [3726] It doesn't matter does it?
Chris (PS05X)   [3727] No.
Norrine (PS101) [3728] As long as we, she goes on being [...] . [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3729] At least we know where she drinks.
                [3730] What do you have to say to that?
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Susan (PS103)   [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3731] Any booked?
Susan (PS103)   [3732] Yeah [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3733] Mm. [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3734] Going to the library [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3735] as a library employee, does she get a benefit?
Susan (PS103)   [3736] What benefit do you get from a library?
Chris (PS05X)   [3737] No, I meant, I meant from booking the cinema.
Norrine (PS101) [3738] I shouldn't think so for a minute darling.
Susan (PS103)   [3739] Yes, what's the library got to do with the cinema?
Chris (PS05X)   [3740] Not a lot, but there's a leisure point which tells you
                everything that's happening in Bromley, inside the library, did
                occur to you
Susan (PS103)   [3741] No, no I got it out, I got it out of the papers last
                night.
Chris (PS05X)   [3742] But you didn't book the tickets out of the papers last

Chris (PS05X)   [3774] Super.

Chris (PS05X)   [3792] What does it actually prove, osmosis or diffusion?
Norrine (PS101) [3793] Osmosis.
Chris (PS05X)   [3794] Pardon?
Norrine (PS101) [3795] I think it's osmosis.
Chris (PS05X)   [3796] Ah, that's the passing of a [whistling] , erm, er, erm,
                something, no it can't be osmosis, cos it's a part of membrane.
                [3797] Passing of a liquid
Norrine (PS101) [3798] No diffusion.
Chris (PS05X)   [3799] liquid, no diffusion can anywhere, doesn't have to pass
                membrane at all.
                [3800] Passing of a liquid through a membrane leaving part of
                it's substance behind.
Susan (PS103)   [3801] It's something to [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3802] It's absolutely nothing [...]
Susan (PS103)   [3803] Osmosis is the passing of water from a place of high
                water density to place of low water density.
Chris (PS05X)   [3804] Boom, boom, super.
Norrine (PS101) [3805] Is that right [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [3806] Yes what does that mean in practice Snoopy?
Susan (PS103)   [3807] Don't know.
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [3808] Where does osmosis occur dad means?
Susan (PS103)   [3809] It's anywhere.
Norrine (PS101) [3810] Like, such as?
Susan (PS103)   [3811] Body.
Chris (PS05X)   [3812] Does it?
Norrine (PS101) [3813] From where to where in the body?
Chris (PS05X)   [3814] Kidneys or something like that.
Susan (PS103)   [3815] I don't know.
Norrine (PS101) [3816] Why do we need to know about osmosis?
Susan (PS103)   [3817] We don't, I'm just telling dad, cos he [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3818] How come you know about it?
Susan (PS103)   [3819] [...] college.
Norrine (PS101) [3820] Yes, but I mean, how?
Susan (PS103)   [3821] I can't remember.
Norrine (PS101) [3822] Ah, well [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [3823] There's er no practical application as far as you know.
Norrine (PS101) [3824] There must be.
Susan (PS103)   [3825] Yeah, things [...] in the body and I can't [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [3826] Well really, what I'm trying to tell the children is
                that plants need water, it drinks up water in order to live.
Susan (PS103)   [3827] Yeah, [...]
Norrine (PS101) [3828] Drink, you can't see it if you put them in water, you
                just know the water's gone but it might of evaporated.
                [3829] I just make them see the colour going up the stem of a
                plant.
                [3830] You can do it with a turn the carnation pink or you know
                it's white, that sort of thing.
                [3831] I was just having a little experiment to see how it
                takes and how strong it is and I know what I'm doing.
Chris (PS05X)   [3832] Well I can't see that that would actually prevent [...]
                action.
Norrine (PS101) [3833] Well that's all it is.
Chris (PS05X)   [3834] Is it?
                [3835] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [3836] Try to prove anything is so the water travels up the
                plant, I can't think of anything [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [3837] You haven't got a plant there have you?
Norrine (PS101) [3838] A theory is a plant, what else does it do?
Chris (PS05X)   [3839] No not when it's chopped off top and bottom like a stick
                from the fridge dear, it's not a plant.
Norrine (PS101) [3840] It is a plant.
Chris (PS05X)   [3841] Oh.

Norrine (PS101) [3996] [...] to look for something else then?
*** 132 (Tape 002601) ***
Norrine (PS101) [3997] It's alright, we don't have to do anything
Chris (PS05X)   [3998] Really, aha.
Norrine (PS101) [3999] for a minute.
Chris (PS05X)   [4000] [...] ready to cook.
Norrine (PS101) [...]

Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4003] Sorry, you're going to freeze it?
Norrine (PS101) [4004] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [4005] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4006] Oh well done.

                [4009] Five minutes to go.
                [4010] Would you like me to try Veronica later or deliver that?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
*** 133 (Tape 002602) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [4011] Good dog, good dog.
                [4012] Hello girls.
Chris (PS05X)   [4013] Would you like your car washing?
Norrine (PS101) [4014] Would you like your car washing?
Chris (PS05X)   [4015] What a lovely idea, I don't think so though, thank you
                very much, you're very well equipped, I'm very impressed.
                [4016] [laugh] No thanks very much indeed though.
Chris (PS05X)   [4017] Alright then.
Norrine (PS101) [4018] O K thanks.
Chris (PS05X)   [4019] Did, did get a swirl earlier this week, thank you very
                much.
                [4020] Bye.
Chris (PS05X)   [4021] Bye.
Norrine (PS101) [4022] Bye.
*** 134 (Tape 002603) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [4023] We've just had half an hour in Jubilee park, extremely
                brisk walk, I feel ext ... jolly toasty now.
                [4024] How was your outing?
Norrine (PS101) [4025] Oh.
Chris (PS05X)   [4026] Good looking buds on there aren't they?
Norrine (PS101) [4027] I do miss [...] that pole sticking up there [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4028] Don't worry about it.
Norrine (PS101) [4029] [...] not quite right, but if I go [...] it'll break
                back off. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4030] A well exercised beast there I think.
*** 135 (Tape 002604) ***
Norrine (PS101) [4031] I'm going to cook this Chris, right now.
Chris (PS05X)   [4032] Good.
Norrine (PS101) [4033] I just fancy it.
                [4034] What [...] is horrible, [...] the taste.
Chris (PS05X)   [4035] How you going to do it, microwave?
Norrine (PS101) [4036] No.
Chris (PS05X)   [4037] Cook it.
                [4038] Roasting, place in a baking tray, gas mark five for
                thirty five minutes.
                [4039] So it's on is it?
Norrine (PS101) [4040] So it's thirty five minutes.
                [4041] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [4042] Good.
                [4043] Cooking time will need to be extended when cooking more
                than one product at a time.
Norrine (PS101) [4044] I'm only cooking that.
Chris (PS05X)   [4045] Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
                [4046] It is straightforward, thirty five minutes, shall I set
                thirty five?
Norrine (PS101) [4047] Phorr, sticky out there isn't it?
Chris (PS05X)   [4048] It's not very agreeable at all, is it?
Norrine (PS101) [4049] I forgot to take those rotten grapefruits back to
                Sainsbury's.
Chris (PS05X)   [4050] Oh did you tell them?
Norrine (PS101) [4051] No, what, what would that do.
Chris (PS05X)   [4052] Well I mean that, they don't expect necessarily to see
                the evidence do they?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
*** 136 (Tape 002605) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [4053] Not a lot of people in the park.
                [4054] Where'd they go?
Norrine (PS101) [4055] I'm not surprised.
                [4056] [...] in the park.
Chris (PS05X)   [4057] Whoops, bad luck, your toe?
Norrine (PS101) [4058] Oh [...] dear, [...] hurt me.
Chris (PS05X)   [4059] Why won't you go to the chiropodist.
Norrine (PS101) [4060] Because I keep bumping them it's got nothing to do with
                the chiropodist.
Chris (PS05X)   [4061] I can get you some army boots.
Norrine (PS101) [4062] Bumped my toe this morning. [...] .
*** 137 (Tape 002606) ***
Norrine (PS101) [4063] Those green things are for Susannah's picnic.
Chris (PS05X)   [4064] Oh when she having a picnic?
Norrine (PS101) [4065] Well she has one every day.
Chris (PS05X)   [4066] Oh I see, yes, I see.
                [4067] What have we here?
                [4068] The pond, pond weed, water weed.
Norrine (PS101) [4069] [...] don't touch that.
Chris (PS05X)   [4070] Oh, got the beasties in too has it?
Norrine (PS101) [4071] I'm going next door.
Chris (PS05X)   [4072] Right.
Norrine (PS101) [4073] I think I will have a drink.
Chris (PS05X)   [4074] Yes, what would you like cider?
Norrine (PS101) [4075] No, a sherry.
Chris (PS05X)   [4076] Sherry right.
Norrine (PS101) [4077] [...] What you did was press, if it was water like [...]
                ... [milk bottles fall over] [...] Just plenty of water and
                then put that in.
Chris (PS05X)   [4078] Yes, the water temperature's well ...
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4079] Right.
Norrine (PS101) [4080] I'll put the [...] cos there won't be enough on.
Chris (PS05X)   [4081] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [4082] It's cold air isn't it [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [4083] Oh really.
Norrine (PS101) [4084] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X)   [4085] Oh brown one and a gold one.
Norrine (PS101) [4086] Well actually when it's in the sun one looks a silvery
                gold.
Chris (PS05X)   [4087] Oh yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4088] One transparent [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4089] Here, have a sherry dear.
Norrine (PS101) [4090] I will.
                [4091] [...] . God I need a time and motion expert in this
                cupboard. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4092] Well it's multi purpose cupboard dear.
Norrine (PS101) [4093] [...] put that [...] .
*** 138 (Tape 002607) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [4094] [cough] Meet anyone when you were out?

                [4096] Not really, no [...] .
                [4097] I'll put that over there, [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4098] I a, I only saw half a dozen people in the park, past a
                party of riders, lady who approved of my litter picking.
Norrine (PS101) [4099] [...] I funny [...] staring back at the car park, the
                [...] car park, and the
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [4100] [...] O K?
Chris (PS05X)   [4101] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4102] Mm, where's the [...] ?
                [4103] I saw [...] park, [...] full of [...] traffic down the
                high street.
                [4104] [...] in front of me and throw out carton into the road,
                winds his window up again.
                [4105] Then as he was passing a bit nearer and I came to him,
                he stopped again in the queue, I walked in and [...] and I
                said, I knocked on his window and he put it down and I said,
                that wasn't a very nice thing to do.
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4106] He said to me I'm not a very nice person.
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4107] So I said well I hope you're working on it
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4108] and I walked on a couple, two or three [...] and picked
                up this bloody carton out of the road and I was right next to
                Linda's car
Chris (PS05X)   [4109] Oh really?
Norrine (PS101) [4110] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [4111] Did she see what you was doing?
Norrine (PS101) [4112] I don't know, but she, I, she waved to me and I waved to
                her and I picked it up and I said do you want this?
Chris (PS05X)   [4113] [laugh] at the fellow, or at
Norrine (PS101) [4114] No, there's these girls with a fellow with several cars
                that way though and I just put it in the bin that was there.
Chris (PS05X)   [4115] Yeah
Norrine (PS101) [4116] But, I did think he was cheeky, I mean it was so
                blatant.
Chris (PS05X)   [4117] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4118] And [...] people walking on the pavement [...] all it
                totally and I thought what a cheek.
Chris (PS05X)   [4119] Ha [laugh] Well done dear, you've done your bit for
                humanity today.
Norrine (PS101) [4120] Well I
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4121] That's that, [...] ... You can't freeze that one, I'll
                have to make the sandwiches with these because if I freeze the
                bread
Chris (PS05X)   [4122] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4123] I then can't freeze it for sandwiches.
Chris (PS05X)   [4124] It's not capable of being frozen again you mean or what?
Norrine (PS101) [4125] Yes, you mustn't re-freeze things, so I try to make the
                sandwiches
Chris (PS05X)   [4126] You have a sandwich making sesh do you?
Norrine (PS101) [4127] and then put them in, it's so much to ease my mind in
                the morning, is all I've got to do is take them out and they're
                pretty, they're fresh, they'll defrost by lunchtime and
Chris (PS05X)   [4128] Yep.
Norrine (PS101) [4129] they're as fresh as they can be.
Chris (PS05X)   [4130] Yep.
                [4131] [sniff] Pardon me.
Norrine (PS101) [4132] The only thing is I can't really put much salad in them
                there, because salad doesn't freeze awfully well
Chris (PS05X)   [4133] Yes, goes rather soggy doesn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [4134] but, Susannah doesn't particularly care for erm
Chris (PS05X)   [4135] You just hoik a packet out of the freezer every day and
                put it in the fridge for her do you?
Norrine (PS101) [4136] Yes, erm, that's right, or put them on the [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [noseblow]
Norrine (PS101) [4137] Coke thing, and the drink and the [...] and er pieces of
                fruit.
Chris (PS05X)   [4138] [noseblow] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [4139] Well I can't always find the biscuit, I always buy
                enough.
Chris (PS05X)   [4140] Some glorious first of June my goodness, isn't it?
                [4141] I was wearing my coat and my gloves at the park.
Norrine (PS101) [4142] [...] I also take my gloves ... [...] dog. [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4143] Was it a cigarette carton the fellow chucked?
Norrine (PS101) [4144] No it was a juice carton with a straw in it.
Chris (PS05X)   [4145] Oh yes, yes oh, all this instant disposal stuff really
                is a pain.
Norrine (PS101) [4146] Peop ... peop ... people get [...] don't they?
                [4147] [...] In their car before they get home.
Chris (PS05X)   [4148] No course they don't.
                [4149] Yes.
                [4150] Yes, that's one of the blessing of people not parking so
                much down the road now, they don't empty out their ashtrays and
                their junk from time to time.
                [4151] Kids walking up and down still drop their sweet packets
                though.
Norrine (PS101) [4152] I know, look at that.
Chris (PS05X)   [4153] Terrible getting old.
Norrine (PS101) [4154] Blame it on puberty.
Chris (PS05X)   [4155] All ... all it's doing is staying on the outside dear.
Norrine (PS101) [4156] No it's not, look, if you look where the yellow is, it's
                not, just to the rim of the water is it?
Chris (PS05X)   [4157] No, but it could be simply for being shaken around.
                [4158] Well I mean there's a yellow streak all the same, all
                the way up there look.
Norrine (PS101) [4159] It's [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4160] Is it coming up, perhaps it's pouring out of the top
                dear.
                [4161] It's all yellow at the top.
Norrine (PS101) [4162] Anyway
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4163] I think I can throw it away cos I've proved it to myself
                that it work, the three of them.
Chris (PS05X)   [4164] Well you eat that piece dear.
                [4165] As it's gloriously golden. [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4166] [...] ... [...] usually look forward to half term to my
                feet to recover because the children walk all over me.
Chris (PS05X)   [4167] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4168] And they're nasty little, little feet chair [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4169] Would you like me to buy you a foot bath?
Norrine (PS101) [4170] No. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4171] Massages your feet , with water, warm water jets each
                night when you come in.
Norrine (PS101) [4172] No thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [4173] Why not?
                [4174] It would do them ever so much good.
                [4175] I'm thinking of getting an ozone
Norrine (PS101) [4176] Come on.
Chris (PS05X)   [4177] generator or
Norrine (PS101) [4178] I know we're going to be an ozone clean the air are we?
Chris (PS05X)   [4179] An ozone clean the air. [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4180] An ozone [...] are we?
Chris (PS05X)   [4181] A nuclear guaranteed zone.
                [4182] [laugh] Oh [...]
Norrine (PS101) [4183] [...] an ioniser, is that what you mean?
Chris (PS05X)   [4184] An ioniser that's what I mean dear, yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [4185] Where are you going to put it?
Chris (PS05X)   [4186] In the office dear, where it needn't concern, your hair
                looks very nice.
Norrine (PS101) [4187] Why should it not concern me?
Chris (PS05X)   [4188] Well, give, you did sound a little scathing to there of
                my darling.
Norrine (PS101) [4189] I [...] don't you mean one in every room to benefit?
Chris (PS05X)   [4190] I want, I need to be fresh in the office I don't want to
                be fresh in front of the television, I want to go to sleep.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4191] Perhaps one can have a personal ioniser that clips on
                the lapel or the belt.
Norrine (PS101) [4192] [...] I think.
Chris (PS05X)   [4193] Yes, yes, I would be quite glad when this lot's over.
Norrine (PS101) [4194] Yes, and I shall be quite bad.
Chris (PS05X)   [4195] [laugh] Are you being inhibited or exhibitionist or
                what?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4196] Being inhibited, oh I haven't noticed it.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4197] [laugh] well I'll switch off if I'm being [...]
                something rather good, so don't ... I feel a bit sorry for
                those goldfish.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4198] Well, I reckon that plastic bag squashed them all, get
                away blossom.
Norrine (PS101) [4199] Well they're getting to the right temperature he said
                [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4200] I don't think they're allowed to move, haven't got any
                room to move round in there have they?
Norrine (PS101) [4201] Oh yes they have.
Chris (PS05X)   [4202] Have they?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4203] [laugh] Ah yes, [...] you're absolutely right, they're
                your little toys, look at that tail. [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4204] I wouldn't trust her an inch.
Chris (PS05X)   [4205] No quite right.
Norrine (PS101) [4206] Not an inch.
Chris (PS05X)   [4207] Quite right, except soon as your back's turned dear ...
Norrine (PS101) [4208] Guess how much they cost?
Chris (PS05X)   [4209] A shilling each.
Norrine (PS101) [4210] You're living in the past.
Chris (PS05X)   [4211] Yeah I know, fifty pence each.
Norrine (PS101) [4212] Yes.
                [4213] No seventy five.
Chris (PS05X)   [4214] Seventy five oh that's a rip off dear.
Norrine (PS101) [4215] I thought so too, [...] it said fifty on the tank
Chris (PS05X)   [4216] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [4217] and I said to him, I thought they er were fifty pence
                and he said I've picked you out the biggest and the best.
Chris (PS05X)   [4218] Cheeky devil.
Norrine (PS101) [4219] Now what could I say?
Chris (PS05X)   [4220] Cheeky devil, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4221] He said, if they, anything goes wrong, come back.
Chris (PS05X)   [4222] Those are the benefits of doing ... shopping in
                Chislehurst High Street are they?
Norrine (PS101) [4223] They've got a new tank and new [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4224] Have they?
Norrine (PS101) [4225] Oh, it's all opened up [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4226] It's a much cleaner, brighter place now isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [4227] You wouldn't recognize it.
Chris (PS05X)   [4228] Yes, certainly was a pretty sordid effort before.
Norrine (PS101) [4229] A minor bird in there and a chinchilla, who looks so
                miserable.
Chris (PS05X)   [4230] What is that?
                [4231] A little furry beast.
Norrine (PS101) [4232] Yes, I thought a chinchilla was a kind of rabbit, but it
                isn't, it's got a tail.
Chris (PS05X)   [4233] Oh.

Norrine (PS101) [4241] with a hole in the top and that, and when I went in it
                was in its box, facing the back of the box and its tail
                sticking out.
Chris (PS05X)   [4242] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [4243] When I came back, cos I went in on the way to the
                hairdresser's, to find out about it, and I thought I'd buy him
                on the way back, when I went back it was still sitting in the
                same place with its tail hanging out of the back.
                [4244] Look at this cat, ah look at pussy Emma.
Chris (PS05X)   [4245] That's a saucy pose isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [4246] She wants her tummy tickled.

Chris (PS05X)   [4253] No.
Norrine (PS101) [4254] A good thing
Chris (PS05X)   [4255] I hope not.
Norrine (PS101) [4256] It's a good thing I'm not going to go because you might
                end up [...] oh look at that?
Chris (PS05X)   [4257] Oh that looks good, yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4258] Both playing croquet, and fighting each other I just get
                [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4259] Well I said to David, is there, I understand this is a
                game where people get very seedy with each other and he said no
                not at all not at all [...] .
                [4260] David is such a mild mannered fellow that er he wouldn't
                know how to.
                [4261] [laugh] He said and he said it's a game of great tactics
                and erm

                [4264] Everybody says how nice you are, how lucky I am.
Chris (PS05X)   [4265] What, what has niceness got to do with confidence for
                goodness sake.
Norrine (PS101) [4266] Well if you're a nice person, then you will [...] , like

Chris (PS05X)   [4267] No, you can't keep all these food dishes can you?
*** 140 (Tape 002609) ***
Norrine (PS101) [4268] So what's been Anthony's problem?
Chris (PS05X)   [4269] Apparently before some time in December, he was
                diagnosed as having an ulcer and almost immediately afterwards
                had a slight stroke.
Norrine (PS101) [4270] Oh dear.
Chris (PS05X)   [4271] And he's only relatively recently gone back to work.
                [4272] And he's been under somebody or other at Charing Cross
                Hospital I, who has a rather different approach to the whole
                thing, many other people's involve rest and doing nothing and
                so on and so forth.
Norrine (PS101) [4273] Has it left him with any impairments?
Chris (PS05X)   [4274] [...] say.
                [4275] Say at all, I didn't ask.
                [4276] Erm, but it's obviously been a very trying time for
                them.
Norrine (PS101) [4277] I'm sure, yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [4278] And one daughter is taking A levels and the other is on
                her way, I'm not sure if she's actually taking O er GCSEs or
Norrine (PS101) [4279] Yes Mark and Deborah are two years behind [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4280] Two years behind is she?
                [4281] Yep, and the older one fancies medicine, but erm, might
                know, her ... her projections are great, but any, inadequate
                for that, so erm, bio-chemistry is a possibility, but erm,
                [...] with just got to wait and see.
Norrine (PS101) [4282] Yeah.
                [4283] Where would she hope to go?
Chris (PS05X)   [4284] Hasn't mentioned at all.
                [4285] [...] ... Yes Geraldine certainly implied that it had
                been a jolly hard time.
Norrine (PS101) [4286] I'm sure it would be, [...] if the kids doing exams.
Chris (PS05X)   [4287] Yes.

                Florence for four days.
                [4291] For, to a conference to do with his job.
Chris (PS05X)   [4292] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [4293] His bosses thought it was time he got back into
Chris (PS05X)   [4294] Yes, to Florence eh.
                [4295] Wonderful place for a conference.
Norrine (PS101) [4296] But she said they spent an enormous amount of money.
Chris (PS05X)   [4297] Oh dear, [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4298] They probably won't be going away this summer.
Chris (PS05X)   [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [4299] And also, their, their children wanted to hang around
                and get their results and [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4300] [...] As long as Anthony has a break or something,Gerald
                ... Geraldine is not working?

                year or two ago.
Norrine (PS101) [4303] Did it dried up?
Chris (PS05X)   [4304] Yeah, and she tried it, the personal experience was
                wonderful. [...] ...

                than a bedroom before

                [4308] They're still in the same place are they?
Norrine (PS101) [4309] Aha.

                [4314] [...] and Anthony's about to try and work from home.
Chris (PS05X)   [4315] Oh really, what leaving his firm?
Norrine (PS101) [4316] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [4317] My goodness.
Norrine (PS101) [4318] Change his job and work as a consultant for a German

                [4320] Day to day he'll work from home.
Chris (PS05X)   [4321] How intriguing ...

Norrine (PS101) [4329] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [4330] The four of us were going out somewhere Anthony said,
                hang on, hang on, I'm not ready yet, got out your ironing board
                and your iron and ironed himself a hanky.
Norrine (PS101) [4331] No, I don't remember that.
Chris (PS05X)   [4332] [laugh] Incredible.
                [4333] All three of us.
Norrine (PS101) [4334] I really don't remember that.

Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4360] No, I envisaged when I bought those superb places that

Norrine (PS101) [4362] Mm. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [4363] It's very graceful about one of those oscillating
                sprinklers, you know.
Norrine (PS101) [4364] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [4365] Great fanning waves to and fro.
Norrine (PS101) [4366] Going on the small lawn is he, when they re-turfed?

Chris (PS05X)   [4383] Chili and grapes, they're cool enough.
Norrine (PS101) [4384] The lavatera has to be put in a sunny spot, I think
                it'll have to go
Chris (PS05X)   [4385] [...] [sigh] Sorry not over there.
Norrine (PS101) [4386] Next to that bush, [...] .

                [4390] They grow six feet tall.
Chris (PS05X)   [4391] Well, it needs a darn big space then, doesn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [4392] I wouldn't be able to see it in the [...] .
Chris (PS05X)   [4393] Well I would recommend
Norrine (PS101) [4394] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [4395] that you put it behind a save bush, chop that azalea
                bush, stick it back there, that'll keep the broom coming in.
Norrine (PS101) [4396] You could put it along side that erm, if you put it
                stuck like that, it'll need staking, put it on the wall on the
                fence.
Chris (PS05X)   [4397] It doesn't need staking surely.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4398] I don't think so.
                [4399] Hasn't got a stake in there has it?
Norrine (PS101) [4400] Yeah at the bottom.
Chris (PS05X)   [4401] Oh in the pot I mean, now.
Norrine (PS101) [4402] It's not very big yet.

Norrine (PS101) [4406] Why?
Chris (PS05X)   [4407] I suppose they'll be alright when the iris disappear.
                [4408] Actually it's red and pink ones [...] that's rather
                nice.
                [4409] Very pleased at those original gerania
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4410] Not too sure.
                [4411] Used to come up purple as well as pink.
                [4412] This is a lovely colour of iris just here isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [4413] Mm. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4414] Why not have the lavatera in there, instead of the tree?
Norrine (PS101) [4415] No, no, no, no, no, no, too untidy.
Chris (PS05X)   [4416] Mm ... Have you enjoyed the wallflowers this year?
Norrine (PS101) [4417] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [4418] Mm.

Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4420] Yeah.

Chris (PS05X)   [4460] Well it's where, next to the place I bought the tiles
                from.

Chris (PS05X)   [4473] I see.
Norrine (PS101) [4474] And then when I get to school, I do, I have to pour all
                the water into the tank, and leave it for a couple of hours and
                at break time put the fish into the ... into the mix water
Chris (PS05X)   [4475] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4476] so that they get them [...] And I'll get the children to
                collect some rocks up and wash them.
Chris (PS05X)   [4477] Why?
                [4478] Oh right.
                [4479] Why are you doing this?
                [4480] What's the object?
Norrine (PS101) [4481] Cos we're doing a project on water
Chris (PS05X)   [4482] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [4483] and, the children have done that tie dying, and after
                open day, when most of their dollies will be finished soon
Chris (PS05X)   [4484] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [4485] I thought they could stick [...] fish and weed on to
                their bits of tie dying, use the tie dying as a [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4486] Oh yes.
                [4487] I'm surprised, [...] .
                [4488] I'll have a small cafe with you.
*** 144 (Tape 002614) ***
Norrine (PS101) [4489] Is he there?
Chris (PS05X)   [4490] Yep. [...]
Norrine (PS101) [4491] Seen my glasses [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [4492] Thank you.
Norrine (PS101) [4493] How would you like your coffee love?
Chris (PS05X)   [4494] [...] thank you.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [4495] On whose behalf should I arrears?
Norrine (PS101) [4496] Interest.
Chris (PS05X)   [4497] Oh, really?
Norrine (PS101) [4498] [...] I don't need it anyhow.
Chris (PS05X)   [4499] Actually an interesting article is it?
Norrine (PS101) [4500] Yes actually an interesting article.
Chris (PS05X)   [4501] Mm ... Go and put a jumper on I think.
Norrine (PS101) [4502] Jo who does my hair is off too, on Thursday, to the
                Caribbeans to be married.
Chris (PS05X)   [4503] Golly, very exotic.
*** 145 (Tape 002615) ***
Chris (PS05X) [4504] They are, getting lots and lots of people to do it
David (PS107) [4505] Mm.
Chris (PS05X) [4506] and it's going to be a record, simply a record of erm,
              English as it's spoken in nineteen ninety one, I've got a little
              blurb on it which I'll show you.
David (PS107) [4507] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4508] Having put a jumper on I don't know where to clip the
              blinking microphone now.
David (PS107) [4509] It's an interesting idea, isn't it? [...]
Chris (PS05X) [4510] Oh yes .
              [4511] Yes and they ... they provided me with boxes of tapes and
              batteries and eh Walkman and so on and so forth and eh, I'm
              trying to be conscientious. [laugh]
David (PS107) [4512] Well I'm sure, I don't know whether it's sort of easy to
              wear when you're playing croquet or I suppose [...]
Chris (PS05X) [4513] Ah well, if, if it isn't I switch it off.
David (PS107) [4514] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4515] Dispose of it, it's eh, somebody's having a fete or
              something.
              [4516] Oh it's a funny old day today isn't it?
David (PS107) [4517] Mm, it's not cold is it?
              [4518] I [...]
Chris (PS05X) [4519] Well I thought it was when I went out and exercised the
              dog before lunch, I went up to Jubilee Park and eh, I had a very
              brisk walk indeed and I was absolutely lathered by the time I got
              back to the car, after half an hour.
David (PS107) [4520] Yeah.
              [4521] It's always perceptive on days like this, because it's
              overcast and eh
Chris (PS05X) [4522] Yes.
David (PS107) [4523] you tend to thinking not very warm.
Chris (PS05X) [4524] Yes .
              [4525] Absolutely, absolutely.
              [4526] Your son had better things to do had he?
David (PS107) [4527] He's gone into Bromley with my eldest.
Chris (PS05X) [4528] Aha.
David (PS107) [4529] Jeremy does play croquet, but very infrequently.
Chris (PS05X) [4530] Yes.
David (PS107) [4531] [...] .
              [4532] Just broken away from his girlfriend.
Chris (PS05X) [4533] Oh has he, ah.
              [4534] He seemed happy enough when I called.
David (PS107) [4535] Well it was his doing so I suppose
Chris (PS05X) [4536] I see.
David (PS107) [4537] Probably not be unhappy with it, she is.
Chris (PS05X) [4538] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha yes , yes indeed, ha, ha, ha.
David (PS107) [4539] Smart brake lights aren't they [...] car [...]
Chris (PS05X) [4540] I was just thinking what an intriguing colour they were.
David (PS107) [4541] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4542] Fuchsia, would you call it?
David (PS107) [4543] Yes, wonder why you'd want two double exhaust do you, I
              mean it's not a very big engine surely on those, Volkswagen is
              there?
Chris (PS05X) [4544] Yeah, yeah , it's all a bit of pizzazz I suppose.
David (PS107) [4545] Mm probably only one of them is actually effective.
Chris (PS05X) [4546] Yes.
              [4547] Or ... or probably neither of them are connected. [laugh]
David (PS107) [laugh]
Chris (PS05X) [4548] Still a noisy little engine though, isn't it, my goodness.
David (PS107) [4549] Well they always were, weren't they?
              [4550] But the
Chris (PS05X) [4551] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [4552] I mean I, my sister used to have one and she said you
              could take it on the motorway and it'll just keep up a, a very
              good speed still with a noisy engines and then it just kept going
              and going and going.
Chris (PS05X) [4553] Yes , yes.
David (PS107) [4554] They're like a Morris Minor aren't they?
              [4555] I mean that's an incredible engine.
Chris (PS05X) [4556] Oh yes, yes .
              [4557] Did you see that the British High Commissioner of Sri
              Lanka has been chucked out of Sri Lanka?
David (PS107) [4558] No.
Chris (PS05X) [4559] Er, he, there was a pic ... there was a picture of him on
              the report in the paper and he was sitting in his convertible
              Morris Minor.
David (PS107) [4560] Oh [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4561] And they are, they are very popular vehicles in Sri Lanka,
              and somebody's about to set up a factory there to make the bulk
              of the parts
David (PS107) [4562] Yes.
              [4563] That's right , yes I think I
Chris (PS05X) [4564] Rather oddly there are two or possibly even three Morris
              Minor centres who [...] parts, that's in Bath, they're, they've
              seemed to have concentrated in Bath rather, rather oddly.
              [4565] And I get erm, one of my customers in Trinidad runs a
              Morris Minor still.
David (PS107) [4566] Really?
Chris (PS05X) [4567] And eh, he occasionally asks me to get bits and pieces
David (PS107) [4568] Well they do so, I mean, I know, I know the body shape is
              expensive to make because of the number of different panels
Chris (PS05X) [4569] Yes.
David (PS107) [4570] by comparison with modern cars.
Chris (PS05X) [4571] Surely.
David (PS107) [4572] They just pick same extent [...] the Mini doesn't it?
Chris (PS05X) [4573] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [4574] That's why it is expensive compared to eh, other cars,
              but, [cough] they, they seemed to go on for ever those cars, I
              mean they're quite incredible aren't they?
Chris (PS05X) [4575] Yes, they, they
David (PS107) [4576] They've certainly the engine of it.
Chris (PS05X) [4577] Tough, tough little beasts aren't they?
David (PS107) [4578] Yeah, yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4579] And of course they've actually made eh, the bodies with er
              metal not tissue paper in those days didn't they?
David (PS107) [4580] Yes.
              [4581] But they don't seem to have some of these sort of inherent
              problems that other cars have had since, with eh, sections of the
              body that tend to rust.
Chris (PS05X) [4582] Really, yes, yes.
David (PS107) [4583] Whereas I think cars now, because they give these
              guarantees on rust, they've certainly given it a lot of thought,
              but, I mean there was certainly models that were riddled with
              problems weren't there?
Chris (PS05X) [4584] Yes there were.
              [4585] Only the Mini when it first came out was a shocker wasn't
              it?
David (PS107) [4586] Mm, yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4587] Absolute shocker.
David (PS107) [4588] Today I was listening to the talk on the radio coming
              home, it last night, and the, there was a, representative from
              one of the largest eh, firms that transport new cars in this
              country
Chris (PS05X) [4589] Yes.
David (PS107) [4590] together with a representative of British Rail, and he was
              saying that, I, forget how many car transporters they've got that
              erm, they built, bought specially to go on British Rail, he said,
              but they said he just had to give them up for many reasons and
              one of them was the problems that they have with new cars when
              they take them on British Rail and the brake dust from the trains
              apparently causes immediate rust.
Chris (PS05X) [4591] Oh.
David (PS107) [4592] So that you can put a brand new car on at eh, A and by the
              time it gets to the other end it's literally got rust problems.
Chris (PS05X) [4593] How curious.
David (PS107) [4594] It seemed to me incredible.
Chris (PS05X) [4595] Yes, absolutely amazing.
David (PS107) [4596] Apart from the vandalism problems they've had, where whole
              trainload of cars have been stripped of the radios.
Chris (PS05X) [4597] Oh dear.
David (PS107) [4598] Cos when they pulled into a slow section on the railway,
              the vandals have got on and just gone through the whole lot and
              taken the radios out.
Chris (PS05X) [4599] Yes, yes, British Rail have got big problems in that way,
              haven't they?
David (PS107) [4600] Oh [...] yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4601] And rail ... railways really ought to be far better
              developed than they are in this country, eh.
David (PS107) [4602] Well it seems the obvious means of transport.
Chris (PS05X) [4603] Absolutely, absolutely, but I mean, I ... I ship goods out
              of this country into the continent and further afield, erm, rail
              is just not an option that I can consider.
David (PS107) [4604] No.
Chris (PS05X) [4605] It's er it's not feasible.
David (PS107) [4606] That's what the representative said from the erm, the car
              transporter company, was that they ... they just couldn't any
              longer use British Rail because it, he said although British Rail
              are willing to compensate, it's delay of deliveries.
Chris (PS05X) [4607] It's not the point is it?
David (PS107) [4608] They can't deliver to their customers on time.
Chris (PS05X) [4609] Mm.
              [4610] Surely, surely, yes, and thirty, forty, fifty years ago,
              rail was an acknowledged method of shipping things into from
              Europe.
David (PS107) [4611] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4612] And then there were people who specialized in it, I don't
              suppose from a moment there are now.
David (PS107) [4613] Yes.
              [4614] No.
Chris (PS05X) [4615] They just
David (PS107) [4616] Eh, [...] , I mean there's a [...] idea the money that's
              been spent on the railways instead of on motorways we'd be a lot
              better off, and I think [...] and Partners subscribed to that
              because I think that erm, had more money being spent on the
              railways that we would have been much better off, oh I'd much
              rather go on a train journey than on a motor bridge journey.
Chris (PS05X) [4617] Yes.
              [4618] Yes.
              [4619] Absolutely.
David (PS107) [4620] Sitting comfortably get up and walk about, go and have
              your cup of tea or coffee.
Chris (PS05X) [4621] Surely, surely, it makes much more sense, you can read a
              book and
David (PS107) [4622] There's still something [...] about railways even though
              they're not steaming.
Chris (PS05X) [4623] Yes , yes I agree.
              [4624] All clear on the left ...
David (PS107) [4625] Busy road isn't it this?
Chris (PS05X) [4626] Far too busy, yes.
David (PS107) [4627] Perhaps I should have, you can pulled into this refuge in
              the middle there [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4628] Yes, yes, it's, otherwise it's very neat here, you know in
              this, these little spaces are really incredibly small.
David (PS107) [4629] Yes, yes, just stop and get some petrol.
Chris (PS05X) [4630] Aha.
*** 146 (Tape 002616) ***
Chris (PS05X) [4631] In the States they have particularly small apertures to
              the petrol tanks for unleaded, do they here?
David (PS107) [4632] Mm, Yes , yes, the [...] different size.
Chris (PS05X) [4633] Are right, yes.
David (PS107) [4634] I don't know, a car like this you could pick either of
              them.
Chris (PS05X) [4635] Sure.
David (PS107) [4636] [...] , cheaper, where the one gets quite [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4637] No, no, quite performance is not what counts is it?
David (PS107) [4638] No.
Chris (PS05X) [...]
*** 147 (Tape 002617) ***
David (PS107) [4639] That shows you how long our tank is, it's the other side.
Chris (PS05X) [4640] [laugh] ... Don't you think it would reach?
David (PS107) [4641] Well it probably would, but I got to [...] anyway.
Chris (PS05X) [4642] Yes ... What's that?
              [4643] That's an unleaded only pump I think.
David (PS107) [4644] Oh it's premium, it's premium unleaded.
Chris (PS05X) [4645] Yes.
David (PS107) [4646] Mind you they talk about premium don't they?
Chris (PS05X) [4647] You save a few more coppers don't you?
David (PS107) [4648] Yes, you do.
Chris (PS05X) [4649] Forty five point four, I'll, I'll sort this out in a
              minute, I don't normally have this trouble at the station.
              [4650] Ah, I can't see what [...]
David (PS107) [4651] It's the same price as the other one, so, presumably it's
              the same stuff.
Chris (PS05X) [4652] Ah well.
David (PS107) [4653] Yes, yep, [...] .
              [4654] It's the B S seventy seven premium, it's very small
              letters, I don't think it's anything different.
*** 148 (Tape 002618) ***
Chris (PS05X) [4655] And erm, they've got some new system of a little plastic
              card, which they stick into the machine each time.
David (PS107) [4656] [...] so they give you a credit.
Chris (PS05X) [4657] It, well it notches up points for Argos.
David (PS107) [4658] Well I bet you [...] .
              [4659] Argos [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4660] Oh are they?
David (PS107) [4661] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4662] Oh I see.
David (PS107) [4663] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4664] Yes.
David (PS107) [4665] When you've saved up a card, I don't know how many there
              are in it you got a pound worth of gifts at
Chris (PS05X) [4666] It ... it's all rather ironic when you think that Argos
              grew out of Green Shield.
David (PS107) [4667] Yes, yes, that's right.
Chris (PS05X) [4668] It's, it's the same system [...] eventually isn't it?
David (PS107) [4669] It is yes.
              [4670] With Green Shield Stamps it's amazing how quickly they
              went out just like that, didn't they?
Chris (PS05X) [4671] Yes, I believe what did it was Tesco's [...] them out.
David (PS107) [4672] Ah.
Chris (PS05X) [4673] Tesco were the grocery chain and the Green Shield Stamps
              and it was the kiss of death for Green Shield when they did that.
David (PS107) [4674] Did they pull out?
Chris (PS05X) [4675] They staggered on for a year or two after that, but
              Tesco's had a big, big change of policy they were no longer high
              and kick them out cheap, they decided to promote a quality in
              which stamps did not go for [...] and erm
David (PS107) [4676] You can get Green Shield Stamps again in some garages
              can't you?
Chris (PS05X) [4677] I don't know.
David (PS107) [4678] I'm sure, I thought the one down the bottom did Green
              Shield, or is that something else they do?
Chris (PS05X) [4679] I, I don't, that's ahead of us you mean?
David (PS107) [4680] No, just here.
              [4681] There it is.
Chris (PS05X) [4682] Yeah, oh really, [...] .
David (PS107) [4683] You'll have that recorded on your er
Chris (PS05X) [4684] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [4685] Any noise.
Chris (PS05X) [4686] I, I pity the poor typist has to transcribe this as and
              when if it happens, ha, ha she's going to get some very strange
              noises, including me having a pee and flushing the loo before
              lunch, what have you, I forgot to switch it off. [laugh]
David (PS107) [4687] So you obviously can't edit it can you, or you shouldn't
              it'll be pointless
Chris (PS05X) [4688] Well I , I can, I mean if, if somebody erm, objects to the
              fact that being recorded and let's say erm private business
              meeting or something in that sense
David (PS107) [4689] Oh, that, that switches off completely?
Chris (PS05X) [4690] That's right.
David (PS107) [4691] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4692] That's right.
David (PS107) [4693] Presumably.
Chris (PS05X) [4694] But if somebody, and they say to you, try, try not to tell
              people in advance because it inhibits them, I, I'm not at all
              certain about that, but still, erm
David (PS107) [4695] Some people might object to it.
Chris (PS05X) [4696] But if people object when you tell them afterwards, you're
              at liberty to erase and, so
David (PS107) [4697] Yes
Chris (PS05X) [4698] on and so forth, so,
David (PS107) [4699] you tend to tell them first?
Chris (PS05X) [4700] Well, not necessarily, sometimes I don't tell them at all
              or they comment on it and I explain, it's a, but it's only been
              yesterday and today you see really.
David (PS107) [4701] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4702] They, they asked that it be done on a Friday and a
              Saturday and that they appeared on Thursday with it, erm, I'm
              getting on with it.
              [4703] [laugh] It was quite entertaining yesterday, today's
              becoming a bit of a bore because the tapes only last forty five
              minutes, so you've got to
David (PS107) [4704] Course, yes .
Chris (PS05X) [4705] change, change over and change the tapes and all that sort
              of thing and erm they give you packets of batteries and your
              supposed to change the batteries every two to three tapes, every
              four sides in other words.
              [4706] So you're fiddling around with it and that.
David (PS107) [4707] Yes, yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4708] It's a proper Sony Walkman.
David (PS107) [4709] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4710] It's certainly good quality recording.
David (PS107) [4711] Mm.
              [4712] I've just got it hooked on the mouth here you see.
Chris (PS05X) [4713] Oh it is, yes [...] .
              [4714] Make the exercise worthwhile.
David (PS107) [4715] Mm.
              [4716] Cos language does change doesn't it?
              [4717] I mean
Chris (PS05X) [4718] Very much so, yes.
David (PS107) [4719] words certainly do go out, you forget, when you go to use
              a word that hasn't been in use sometime and the younger person
              says to you what does that mean?
Chris (PS05X) [4720] [laugh] Yes indeed. [laugh]
David (PS107) [4721] Words , with the old coinage have completely gon well not
              completely gone, but they don't have the same meaning do they
              [...] ?
Chris (PS05X) [4722] I can remember several years ago bringing in a seventeen
              year old baby sitter to sit with Susannah, and I heard thirty
              bob.
David (PS107) [4723] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4724] And she said, well what's is it?
              [4725] She had not a clue.
David (PS107) [4726] No.
Chris (PS05X) [4727] Not a clue.
David (PS107) [4728] Well I suppose [...] like that it's not worth tuppence
              really.
Chris (PS05X) [4729] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [4730] But they will say two pence these days won't they?
              [4731] Not tuppence.
David (PS107) [4732] Yeah, not tuppence .
              [4733] No.
Chris (PS05X) [4734] And, and look at you as if you're an old fogey if you say
              tuppence I expect.
              [4735] And do you remember as a child, people used to talk of
              four and twenty and five and twenty past?
David (PS107) [4736] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4737] That's totally disappeared hasn't it?
David (PS107) [4738] Yes, I, I mean, they talk about twenty past the hour,
              twenty to four.
Chris (PS05X) [4739] Yes, but instead of twenty five past, they've said five
              and twenty past
David (PS107) [4740] They did
Chris (PS05X) [4741] quite often.
David (PS107) [4742] yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4743] And eh, curious twist that.
David (PS107) [4744] Yes, I, I think really that's why it's a lot easier to
              read the time on an analogue display than it is on a digital
              display.
              [4745] You virtually have to read that and register it.
Chris (PS05X) [4746] That's right and the point really is with time, you're not
              interested that it's two twenty four.
David (PS107) [4747] No.
Chris (PS05X) [4748] You, are, are, am I early ,
David (PS107) [4749] but
Chris (PS05X) [4750] am I on time, am I late ,
David (PS107) [4751] yes
Chris (PS05X) [4752] have I to, how long is it till I'm due, whatever.
David (PS107) [4753] [...] , you glance at your watch and discover that it's
              not half past isn't it?
Chris (PS05X) [4754] That, that's right, you've still got time or you'd better
              get a move on, it's that sort of reaction that your brain makes
              isn't it?
David (PS107) [4755] You're not really worried about the time to the last
              minute, I mean
Chris (PS05X) [4756] No.
David (PS107) [4757] twenty five past is nearer.
Chris (PS05X) [4758] That's right, that's right, I, I tend to keep my watch to
              the minute if I possibly can, but that's bad habit or really
              habit from the days when I was catching trains every day, and I'd
              never caught a train with any time to spare, erm
David (PS107) [4759] Well with [...] watch they don't [...] .
              [4760] They don't very much anyway do they?
              [4761] Or yours do?
Chris (PS05X) [4762] Mine's a good old fashioned proper mechanical wind up job
              yes.
David (PS107) [4763] Wind up, yes .
Chris (PS05X) [4764] My father gave it to me for my seventeenth birthday.
David (PS107) [4765] Oh really and you still wear it daily?
Chris (PS05X) [4766] I do indeed, yes, yes, it's the only watch I own, and it's
              the only watch I've ever had, no, no, that's true, er not true I
              should say I've got a half hunter.
David (PS107) [4767] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4768] Which eh, if I put this in for cleaning, or [...] .
David (PS107) [4769] That's unusual isn't it, because I always think, I mean I,
              this is really only about the second watch I've ever had [...]
              good one.
              [4770] First good watch I had was for my twenty first, I've still
              got, it still goes
Chris (PS05X) [4771] Yes
David (PS107) [4772] quite well.
Chris (PS05X) [4773] yes.
              [4774] Well my father was a commercial traveller in jewellery,
              silver ware
David (PS107) [4775] Oh was he?
Chris (PS05X) [4776] watches , and this is actually one of his samples.
David (PS107) [4777] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4778] And this is a Sotino which is a quality brand in those
              days, I, I, don't know if it still is, I assume it is, erm, which
              was not advertised at all, and although the Rolex's and so on in
              this world have been heavily advertised as they came on the
              market, Sotino's never really was, so my father had a [...]
              struggle I suspect selling. [laugh]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [4779] Yeah.
David (PS107) [4780] Where do you take it when it needs erm, there aren't that
              many places are there?
Chris (PS05X) [4781] No there aren't , I had it done last year at erm, oh
              what's it called, [...] , Sidcup.
David (PS107) [4782] Oh I know.
Chris (PS05X) [4783] Do you know the ?
David (PS107) [4784] Yes, little tiny place
Chris (PS05X) [4785] Beyond the station
David (PS107) [4786] yes ...
Chris (PS05X) [4787] yes tiny little place, and it was, it wasn't totally
              satisfactory initially in that they erm, they left it with some
              sort of erm cock up, I couldn't wind it up, there was something
              wrong with the crown click, or something of the sort, when I got
              it back, so I had to take it back again, but otherwise they
              seemed to be people who are well aware of watches in the best
              sense and eh, he said this is a ... an excellent movement and eh
              far better than the ones I normally see.
David (PS107) [4788] Mm.
Chris (PS05X) [4789] Erm, but, I mean it doesn't look very special does it?
              [4790] But absolutely everything of course other than the
              movement changed since I was seventeen.
David (PS107) [4791] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4792] New case, new dial, new hands, new everything.
David (PS107) [4793] Really?
Chris (PS05X) [4794] And, and I suspect that'll be jolly difficult to get that
              sort of thing done these days.
David (PS107) [4795] I think a new face would be very expensive [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4796] Mm, mm.
              [4797] Oh yes, but I, I think as I recall I got it without too,
              without too much trouble.
              [4798] But I mean, going back to the fact it's my one and only
              watch, I should think Susannah has had eight or ten watches [...]
              .
David (PS107) [4799] I, I think people must do because the number of them that
              are sold [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4800] She, she, looks upon them as a thoroughly disposable
              commodity.
David (PS107) [4801] Yes, yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4802] Five or ten pounds is the price that has to be paid for
              them and they last six months and they move on to the next,
              extraordinary approach.
David (PS107) [4803] They use Swatch watches don't you.
Chris (PS05X) [4804] Yes, yes, she's, she's had, she's had one of those and I
              haven't seen that for a long time.
              [4805] She's got some stupid thing at the moment with, with a
              flip top of Thomas the Tank Engine.
David (PS107) [laugh]
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
David (PS107) [4806] When Stephanie's mother died we found in the bungalow a
              watch, it must of been given I would of thought to her father
              probably for his twenty first and I took it to a jewellers in
              Elton, well that's all he does is watches actually apart from
              jewellery .
Chris (PS05X) [4807] Yes , yes.
David (PS107) [4808] And eh, he seemed very knowledgeable, I mean we got a job
              to find him, he hasn't actually got a shop, he's just got a
              premises.
Chris (PS05X) [4809] Oh yeah.
David (PS107) [4810] It's the place, that if you take your watch into the
              average shop they take it to him I think.
Chris (PS05X) [4811] I see, yes, yes, oh next time I need one I shall ask you
              then.
David (PS107) [4812] Yes, he was very knowledgeable, very helpful.
Chris (PS05X) [4813] Mm, Mm.
David (PS107) [4814] Eh ...
Chris (PS05X) [4815] Yes in somewhere like that it's not a place you leave your

David (PS107) [4816] Oh
Chris (PS05X) [4817] watch in confidence is it?
David (PS107) [4818] gosh, no, I mean all they do now these days is sell them,
              they don't repair them.
Chris (PS05X) [4819] That's right, that's right, yes ...
David (PS107) [4820] that's a slight, mistake to call them jewellers, cos
              they're not really, that at all are they?
Chris (PS05X) [4821] Yes, yes, I know [...] even, even Ratner himself called
              them tat or
David (PS107) [4822] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4823] crap or something didn't he?
David (PS107) [4824] He did that to get publicity, cos in fact they found that
              it wasn't eh, rubbish he was selling in there.
Chris (PS05X) [4825] Well it, it, at least it's gold, I mean, I, I, I was in
              the jewellery trade when I first left school, between school and
              national service I worked at a manufacturing jewellers in
              Birmingham and I've never really gone along with the idea that
              nine carat is actually gold.
              [4826] If something is only three eights
David (PS107) [4827] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4828] gold, how can you call it gold?
David (PS107) [4829] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4830] The essence of [...] is copper alloy, it's got more than
              fifty percent copper in it.
David (PS107) [4831] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4832] That's the way I always thought, and if it's only got
              thirty seven and a half percent of gold in it, how on earth can
              you call it gold?
David (PS107) [4833] So nine carat is only
Chris (PS05X) [4834] It's nine twenty fourths.
              [4835] Pure gold is twenty four carat.
David (PS107) [4836] Ah, yes of course it is.
Chris (PS05X) [4837] So you get nine carat which is thirty seven and a half,
              eighteen carat which is seventy five percent and twenty two which
              is, ha, ha, ha, whatever it is.
David (PS107) [4838] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4839] A little over ninety per cent I suppose, and erm, I'm not
              sure if you got fourteen or fifteen carat, so fourteen I think is
              used with the continental standard and the lowest continental
              standard now are fifteen used to be our inbetween standard, very
              rarely used.
David (PS107) [4840] But nine and eighteen are the most common in this country?
Chris (PS05X) [4841] Yes, they are, yes, definitely.
David (PS107) [4842] The trouble is the more you get, the more, is the softer
              is the jewellery.
Chris (PS05X) [4843] That's, that's true, eh, I mean the alloy in the other
              ones have to be quite crafty when you get up to twenty two carat
              for example and eh, very eh, eh, large chunk of gold in it, and
              it can indeed be very soft, but then you see that's an eighteen
              carat ring that I've had for, worn, all the time for twenty four
              years
David (PS107) [4844] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4845] and it really was pretty much like that when I had it, so
              eh, it's probably a bit more rounded than it was.
David (PS107) [4846] Yes, yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4847] So they, they do last.
David (PS107) [4848] Yeah.
              [4849] Oh, yes, because rings come in to quite a bit of wear
              don't they?
Chris (PS05X) [4850] Yes, oh yes, yes, yes, no with doubt.
              [4851] I had one repaired for Susannah, it had been left to her
              by an aunt and she had managed to smash it against a [...] post
              or something and broke the shank and knocked out one of the erm,
              stones, so on and so forth, and eh, together with some repairs on
              a charm bracelet I had to pay thirty seven pounds for the whole
              jolly lot. [laugh]
David (PS107) [4852] Did you really, yes, yes.
              [4853] But it's, I think when you look at the cost of labour
              [...] these days, it's not surprising any sort of repairs are
              expensive.
Chris (PS05X) [4854] It's very true.
David (PS107) [4855] They've got to pay for the premises
Chris (PS05X) [4856] Yes
David (PS107) [4857] and eh
Chris (PS05X) [4858] yes, absolutely.
David (PS107) [4859] It's a fairly, well it is a skilled trade isn't it?
Chris (PS05X) [4860] And I took it to the people up on Royal Parade, who are
              constantly having burglaries, no, that's that's true, they have
              had several quite chunky burglaries
David (PS107) [4861] Mm.
Chris (PS05X) [4862] and erm, eh, they have [...] must be absolutely horrific,
              you have to pay for all that sort of thing don't you?
David (PS107) [4863] Yes of course you do, yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4864] It doesn't work on Saturdays eh?
David (PS107) [4865] It doesn't work at all at the moment.
Chris (PS05X) [4866] Oh really.
David (PS107) [4867] [...] I don't think.
Chris (PS05X) [4868] I see, yes, it's not the most stimulating job in the world
              is it?
David (PS107) [4869] No.
              [4870] [laugh] Stretch your money in small amounts like that.
              [4871] [...] prepared to do it, there's quite a few cars [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4872] Yes.
David (PS107) [4873] I suspect that more people use it cos you don't have to
              pay.
              [4874] It's not paying it's the hold up isn't it?
Chris (PS05X) [4875] That's right, that's right, the irritated.
David (PS107) [4876] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4877] Gets on with it.
              [4878] Yes that's quite something isn't it, did you see that in
              the gate of the college, a security man?
David (PS107) [4879] Yes, yes.
*** 149 (Tape 002619) ***
Chris (PS05X) [4880] There's something I must do over here is go Govidge
              Gallery.
              [4881] I have never set foot in it.
David (PS107) [4882] No I haven't, no.
Chris (PS05X) [4883] And it, it's supposed to have some splendid pictures, a
              very fine collection indeed.
David (PS107) [4884] It is, yes, yes .
              [4885] We ... we played poker games in Dulwich College last year.
Chris (PS05X) [4886] Oh yes.
David (PS107) [4887] Erm, well it was a match actually eh, that the, Bromley
              organised, she said she was keen on [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4888] Are we in, Bromley still here?
David (PS107) [4889] No this is Dulwich.
Chris (PS05X) [4890] Dulwich which is Suffolk or
David (PS107) [4891] Yes, it must be.
Chris (PS05X) [4892] Suffolk own a big place Bell, Bell something or other in
              the next road here don't they?
David (PS107) [4893] Do they?
Chris (PS05X) [4894] A great big old country house.
David (PS107) [4895] Oh.
Chris (PS05X) [4896] And it's, it's a big garden [...] .
David (PS107) [4897] No, we, we, played in Bromley itself.
Chris (PS05X) [4898] Did you?
David (PS107) [4899] Yes
Chris (PS05X) [4900] Yes
David (PS107) [4901] I think the only reason they all, they, well it was her
              team against us, eh they
Chris (PS05X) [4902] Oh I see.
David (PS107) [4903] I think the only people which sides with masters from
              Dulwich College
Chris (PS05X) [4904] I see, yes.
David (PS107) [4905] cos they play croquet there.
Chris (PS05X) [4906] They have their own.
David (PS107) [4907] They have their own pitch.
Chris (PS05X) [4908] Pitch, is pitch the right word?
David (PS107) [4909] Er lawn.
Chris (PS05X) [4910] Lawn, right.
David (PS107) [4911] Needless to say that neither of them
Chris (PS05X) [4912] Good. [laugh]
David (PS107) [4913] But she's very nice [...] I think she goes through till
              about June.
Chris (PS05X) [4914] Oh yes, it's not Doreen still is it?
              [4915] The, the [...] lady.
David (PS107) [4916] No, no, I can't remember her name,rath ... rather an
              attractive lady I thought, very pleasant.
Chris (PS05X) [4917] Yes I'm certain this is the road that Carlos used to live
              in.
David (PS107) [4918] It's a very nice road, I mean some very nice houses.
Chris (PS05X) [4919] Very pleasant road, yes .
              [4920] Yes.
David (PS107) [4921] I think it's [...] club just here somewhere.
              [4922] Steven .
Chris (PS05X) [4923] Which club, sorry?
David (PS107) [4924] The croquet club.
Chris (PS05X) [4925] Oh right ...
David (PS107) [4926] I don't know whether there'll be any [...] playing there.
Chris (PS05X) [4927] People might get down later, really.
David (PS107) [4928] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4929] Do you tend to book the lawn or eh
David (PS107) [4930] No, never.
Chris (PS05X) [4931] just turn up, whatever, see what happens?
David (PS107) [4932] Well he needs to know when there's a match on, otherwise
              you wouldn't get a game.
Chris (PS05X) [4933] Quite.
David (PS107) [4934] Just hope there's not one on today, but I'm pretty sure
              there isn't.
Chris (PS05X) [4935] Mm, mm ...
David (PS107) [4936] This is Dulwich Sports Club.
Chris (PS05X) [4937] I see ...
David (PS107) [4938] It's not that far.
Chris (PS05X) [4939] No, no.
David (PS107) [4940] It's about twenty minutes.
Chris (PS05X) [4941] Surely, yes.
David (PS107) [4942] Very convenient for me in the evenings, if I want to stop
              off, have a [...]
Chris (PS05X) [4943] Very pleasant way to unwind , I would think.
David (PS107) [4944] Oh it is, yes.
Chris (PS05X) [4945] How long does a game take, as a general rule David?
David (PS107) [4946] Ah, maybe it's about three hours.
Chris (PS05X) [4947] Gosh, [laugh] , oh, it's a kind of golf then isn't it?
David (PS107) [4948] Er, yes, very much so, I think that, to some extent,
              depending on the standard of the players.
Chris (PS05X) [4949] Yes.
David (PS107) [4950] And how well one can play.
Chris (PS05X) [4951] Yes, fair enough.
*** 150 (Tape 002620) ***
Chris (PS05X) [4952] Friend of mine, I had a beer with in the week, showed me
              his new car, and he said the big irritation is it doesn't
              centrally lock [laugh] , having been used to it.
David (PS107) [4953] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [4954] He eh, [...] .
              [4955] Don't have [...] .
David (PS107) [4956] No that's erm, [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4957] Oh yes.
David (PS107) [4958] [...] used to make bowls off, because they got too
              expensive.
Chris (PS05X) [4959] Oh yes, aha.
David (PS107) [4960] [...] , those dents [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4961] Yes, [...] .
David (PS107) [4962] The ideal weight for [...] is about three pounds.
Chris (PS05X) [4963] Oh I see, yes, yes and what's the facing on it?
David (PS107) [4964] Well I've had to have it faced with nine on, because in
              the end, it, even with [...] it gets erm, damaged.
Chris (PS05X) [4965] Aha, yes.
David (PS107) [4966] We've got two lawns, that, that, this one's a bit smaller,
              but it's about [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [4967] That's about the right size.
David (PS107) [4968] Yes, yes, eh, I just see, come with me.
Chris (PS05X) [4969] Thank you.
              [4970] I'll get it right.
*** 151 (Tape 002621) ***
Unknown speaker (KBKPSUNK) [4971] Hello, hello.
David (PS107)              [4972] Hello, how are you?
                           [4973] Hello, Chris has come down to see what
                           croquet is all about.
Unknown speaker (KBKPSUNK) [4974] Oh really, hello, hello.
Chris (PS05X)              [4975] Hello.
Unknown speaker (KBKPSUNK) [4976] Somebody who pretends to like it.
Chris (PS05X)              [4977] Yes, so I've gathered yes, yes. [...] .
Unknown speaker (KBKPSUNK) [4978] Playing at it, playing at it, [laugh] we're
                           [...] struggling.
Chris (PS05X)              [laugh]
David (PS107)              [4979] Is there erm, a club manager in there [...] ?
Unknown speaker (KBKPSUNK) [4980] No.
Chris (PS05X)              [4981] [...] buildings David.
                           [4982] [laugh] wonderful.
                           [4983] How splendid.
David (PS107)              [4984] Two, two colours ball, that's primary
                           coloured.
Chris (PS05X)              [4985] Right.
David (PS107)              [4986] [...] colours, that means you can double bank
                           on the lawn, you can have two games going on at
                           once.
Chris (PS05X)              [4987] Oh I see, that's crafty, yes, yes ...
David (PS107)              [4988] I'll take the best one.
Chris (PS05X)              [4989] What's the significance of the black tip?
David (PS107)              [4990] Just to put the clips on them.
Chris (PS05X)              [4991] Oh I see, yes, yeah.
David (PS107)              [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)              [4992] Members leave their mallets here as often as
                           not do they?
David (PS107)              [4993] Yes, they do.
                           [4994] I don't tend to.
                           [4995] [...] because I might want to play somewhere
                           else anyway get caught, I just tend to leave it in
                           the car.
Chris (PS05X)              [4996] Absolutely, yes.
David (PS107)              [...]
Chris (PS05X)              [4997] Oh thank you.
David (PS107)              [...]
Chris (PS05X)              [4998] Yes.
                           [4999] Oh yes, there's a good weight in that head
                           isn't there?
David (PS107)              [5000] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X)              [5001] Sorry what [...] say about three pounds?
David (PS107)              [5002] Three pounds is [...] goes all weekend.
Chris (PS05X)              [5003] Right.
*** 152 (Tape 002622) ***
David (PS107) [5004] What I'll do to pick it up [...] play a game, probably
              play a game later [...] .
              [5005] Get used to those shots, right.
Chris (PS05X) [5006] Oh.
David (PS107) [5007] Problem is when you're demonstrating is you tend to do
              things wrong [...] [laugh]
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
David (PS107) [5008] I mean, you should be able to [...] have an awful lot of
              gap.
Chris (PS05X) [5009] They don't do they, no.
David (PS107) [5010] [...] about an eighth in size.
              [5011] Yes, this standard is alright, but the championship would
              be about a sixteen.
              [5012] Though what you should do is, is, just walk up to the
              ball, that line through there.
Chris (PS05X) [5013] Oh right.
David (PS107) [5014] It enables you to line that up.
Chris (PS05X) [5015] It's, it's a sight.
              [5016] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5017] It's fairly important that as, when you walk up to the
              ball you're body is in line with, where you want to be.
Chris (PS05X) [5018] Right, right.
David (PS107) [5019] And then, as you walk up, you really should sort of almost
              end in the ideal place and then having lined up the shot, put it
              through like that.
Chris (PS05X) [5020] Right and it's anticipated that you will strike the erm,
              the hoop in the process.
David (PS107) [5021] Yes, yes, there's no harm in that, I mean it would be nice
              to go through cleanly, but
Chris (PS05X) [5022] Right , yes.
David (PS107) [5023] How you hold the mallet is really up to you, eh there are
              many different ways, you can hold it like that, you can hold it
              down there, up there
Chris (PS05X) [5024] Oh.
David (PS107) [5025] like that, just a, however you feel comfortable.
Chris (PS05X) [5026] It's, it's a question of control and movement.
David (PS107) [5027] You'll find it [...] , the better [...] I don't rank much
              but, tend, tend, to, to, just do that and it'll go through.
Chris (PS05X) [5028] Yes, yes.
              [5029] You tend to let the mallet do the work rather than
David (PS107) [5030] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5031] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5032] [...] quite the height.
Chris (PS05X) [5033] Right.
David (PS107) [5034] [...] same sort of height as me, and surely [...] .
              [5035] Anyway just, just try that.
Chris (PS05X) [5036] Yes.
David (PS107) [5037] [...] .
              [5038] Obviously taking a bit harder.
Chris (PS05X) [5039] Right, yes.
David (PS107) [5040] Can you see, that ball weighs about a pound, so gotta be
              able to
Chris (PS05X) [5041] Yeah, right, right.
David (PS107) [5042] You take a bit of force.
Chris (PS05X) [5043] Yes, yes, quite.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5044] Yes, yes, I, yes I take your point.
David (PS107) [5045] [...] .
              [5046] If you're going to approach the [...] that's the striker's
              move.
Chris (PS05X) [5047] I see.
David (PS107) [5048] That [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5049] Right.
David (PS107) [5050] So you'll try and just get the back a little, lean perhaps
              a little bit over towards there, like that, erm, [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5051] Right.
David (PS107) [5052] Then if you want blue to go the other side of the hoop and
              black to go here say, to [...] the black won't go quite so far
              and the blue will [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5053] Right, so that you'll do a clean run through.
David (PS107) [5054] Then you can [...] that ball again.
Chris (PS05X) [5055] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5056] Right.
              [5057] Then you've got a continuation shot.
David (PS107) [5058] Having run [...] you've got another continuation shot.
Chris (PS05X) [5059] Right.
David (PS107) [5060] You then take [...] , that's how you would progress
              through the hoop.
Chris (PS05X) [5061] Right, right, and you'll use an opponent's ball normally
              or any ball?
David (PS107) [5062] When you're [...] , until you're in danger of breaking
              down, I mean breaking down would be when you'd approach the hoop
              like that and you realize you can't run it.
Chris (PS05X) [5063] Yes.
David (PS107) [5064] And you've got your opponent's ball the other side of the
              hoop, and the blue ball's over there somewhere, so you obviously
              wouldn't try and run the hoop, you'll just join back up with your
              partner's ball.
Chris (PS05X) [5065] To scupper the opposition.
David (PS107) [5066] Well he, he [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5067] To give him nothing to play with.
              [5068] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5069] Erm, no, I mean, ideally you'll make the break if you have
              another ball [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5070] Right.
David (PS107) [5071] Having made the two, comes through to there, you just
              having clear of the metal work, you put, this is a three foot
              [...] , just not in it at the moment [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5072] Right.
David (PS107) [5073] You'd want to put that yellow ball up on your next hoop
              and [...] and get black somewhere near the blue, so then you can
              run that [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5074] I see, yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5075] Something like that, it's not very good. [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5076] Yes, oh yes.
David (PS107) [5077] [...] .
              [5078] The trouble is with demonstrating is talking as well as.
Chris (PS05X) [5079] No, no, no problem.
David (PS107) [5080] [...] .
              [5081] I need to get that, just that little bit further this time
Chris (PS05X) [5082] Right, right.
David (PS107) [5083] round the hoop, well that [...] should come back up.
              [5084] [...] , like to come back up onto the yard line.
Chris (PS05X) [5085] I see, now what about the red?
David (PS107) [5086] Well.
Chris (PS05X) [5087] We ignore that as we're not actually playing.
David (PS107) [5088] [...] .
              [5089] Ideally that would be in the middle there somewhere as a
              pivot.
Chris (PS05X) [5090] Right.
David (PS107) [5091] To, you've gone through the hoop, so [...] , you've pushed
              so [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5092] Oh so it's not a straightforward round the outside, and up
              the middle [...] ?
David (PS107) [5093] Oh you have to got there in a minute.
Chris (PS05X) [5094] Yes, I see.
David (PS107) [5095] We're putting red, we're putting blue on the [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5096] Oh I see, I see, yes.
David (PS107) [5097] I'm just going up near red ourselves.
Chris (PS05X) [5098] Yes.
David (PS107) [5099] That's a bit better.
Chris (PS05X) [5100] Yes, smashing.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5101] Right, so long as we then strike yellow, we can put it in.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5102] Move forward onto the hoop.
David (PS107) [5103] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5104] Right.
David (PS107) [5105] Doesn't matter if yellow goes off.
              [5106] Doesn't matter if the ball goes off in the [...] , or when
              you're running a hoop, it just comes back up.
Chris (PS05X) [5107] Right.
David (PS107) [5108] But at any other time it's the end of your turn.
Chris (PS05X) [5109] Right.
David (PS107) [5110] Now we've got, this is a roll shot, [...] , and we want
              the yellow to go beyond and the black to stop just in front of of
              the hoop.
Chris (PS05X) [5111] Right.
David (PS107) [5112] Oh.
Chris (PS05X) [5113] Does that matter?
David (PS107) [5114] [...] .
              [5115] Should be able to get through there.
              [5116] Secret here is to miss that.
Chris (PS05X) [5117] Yes.
David (PS107) [5118] If you miss that, it's got to go through.
Chris (PS05X) [5119] Yep.
David (PS107) [5120] Well, if you put a, just hit it down a little bit, I got,
              probably won't get through, but if you hit it down a little bit
              to give it a bit of spin it might carry it through.
              [5121] very nearly didn't it?
Chris (PS05X) [5122] Mm.
David (PS107) [5123] You see it?
Chris (PS05X) [5124] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5125] If it had been spinning a bit more, it would of kept on.
Chris (PS05X) [5126] Yep, yep.
David (PS107) [5127] Let's just assume that we've hit that, erm that would have
              been
Chris (PS05X) [5128] That would have
David (PS107) [5129] that would have been the end of my turn.
Chris (PS05X) [5130] Oh would it?
              [5131] No, it's got, it's got to be cleanly through, right, fine.
David (PS107) [5132] This side.
Chris (PS05X) [5133] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5134] So what you see people doing is this, oh no, you shouldn't
              do that.
Chris (PS05X) [5135] Aha.
David (PS107) [5136] I say to you, well I mean I say to you it's not through,
              that's accepted.
Chris (PS05X) [5137] Yes.
David (PS107) [5138] If I say to you do you think that's through
Chris (PS05X) [5139] Yes, yes, very questionable, well it's, it's
David (PS107) [5140] [...] they say to me, yes that's through, it's O K, so
              that's it you don't have to
Chris (PS05X) [5141] Right, right.
David (PS107) [5142] I think really if you're doing that, you should ask
              somebody else to come and
Chris (PS05X) [5143] Yes.
David (PS107) [5144] But once you do that, soon as you put your mallet against
              the hoop, you push the hoop if it's loose forward anyway
Chris (PS05X) [5145] Yes, indeed you have, yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5146] and eh, you've obviously dislodged the situation where
              somebody else should argue perhaps, [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5147] Yes yes, yes, that's right yes.
David (PS107) [5148] But if, if I say to you no I'm sorry Chris that's through
Chris (PS05X) [5149] Mm, mm.
David (PS107) [5150] then you would have to accept it, cos it's really the
              person who's in play who's the referee.
Chris (PS05X) [5151] Yes right , I see.
David (PS107) [5152] In a certain and friendly way.
Chris (PS05X) [5153] Yes , yes indeed, yes, fine.
David (PS107) [5154] I mean, I, I would say, almost certain that's not true is
              it?
Chris (PS05X) [5155] I, I can just see a touch of the black.
David (PS107) [5156] That's right, it's not through, I mean we both agree it's
              not through
Chris (PS05X) [5157] Mm quite, quite, yes.
David (PS107) [5158] but you'll see players who, I mean, I mean, did it the
              other day when I was playing and she did this, oh yes, she [...]
              I said you've moved it, I thoroughly accepted it wasn't through,
              you shouldn't do that.
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
David (PS107) [5159] How can, how can you possibly put that ball back where it
              was ?
Chris (PS05X) [5160] Yes, absolutely , yes.
David (PS107) [5161] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [5162] Yes.
David (PS107) [5163] You can see it wasn't through, we both agreed it.
Chris (PS05X) [5164] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5165] [...] .
              [5166] Erm, push that yellow down, [...] , erm, so let push it
              down there, ah, not hard enough, because the black should have
              gone nearer to the red.
Chris (PS05X) [5167] Yes.
David (PS107) [5168] And then [...] red down to blue [...] all the way round.
Chris (PS05X) [5169] I see, yes.
David (PS107) [5170] Very [laugh]
*** 153 (Tape 002701) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5171] So long as you ke ... keep me on the straight and narrow
              at the same time really.
David (PS107) [5172] Oh, oh, I'll tell you when you [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5173] Yeah, thank you.
              [5174] Why do you actually need the white sticks to a mark up
David (PS107) [5175] [...] , out there when you take a free shot, [...] .
              [5176] A nine. [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5177] I see, yeah, yeah.
David (PS107) [5178] Mm [...] .
              [5179] Yes, problem with, a problem really is they don't [...] .
              [5180] Probably win anyway.
Chris (PS05X) [5181] Right.
David (PS107) [5182] It's not prospective, but eh
Chris (PS05X) [5183] No, no.
David (PS107) [5184] You don't, you don't break out so many times.
Chris (PS05X) [5185] I really haven't got a clue yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5186] But I've got [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5187] Make a guess, I, I, got the message.
              [5188] Yes, right.
*** 154 (Tape 002702) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5189] Yes, that's the, that's the sort of problem I'm in for
              isn't it?
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5190] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
*** 155 (Tape 002703) ***
David (PS107) [5191] You know probably make it a bit easier, but it's not.
              [5192] [...] if you watch them people over there.
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5193] Really, well what'll you call this croquet?
David (PS107) [5194] Croquet Association.
Chris (PS05X) [5195] Association.
David (PS107) [5196] Eh, I don't think [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5197] And they've got two matches going on together have they,
              they're, they've different colour balls?
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5198] Oh I see.
David (PS107) [5199] She can't even get the hang of it.
              [5200] [...] arrangements.
Chris (PS05X) [5201] Ah.
David (PS107) [5202] Oh well, let's have a game.
Chris (PS05X) [5203] Yes.
David (PS107) [5204] Let's see how we get on.
Chris (PS05X) [5205] Yes please.
David (PS107) [5206] [...] .
              [5207] You got to have, got to to keep [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5208] Yes [...] .
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5209] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
David (PS107) [5210] That has been caught [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
David (PS107) [5211] Taking the [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5212] Yeah, sorry, I was miles away, I'd lost anyway mentally, I
              mentally I lost.
David (PS107) [5213] Did you?
Chris (PS05X) [5214] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5215] Now I had the choice of going first, [...] , so if I
              choose to go first then you can choose the colours. [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5216] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5217] Occasionally you're forced into the other then you'll,
              then you'll, down aren't you?
David (PS107) [5218] Of course you are, you'll just [...] .
              [5219] Erm, as of one, I think [...] first.
Chris (PS05X) [5220] Good.
David (PS107) [5221] Erm.
              [5222] [...] . During this first hit it's important to get the
              speed of the lawn, try and judge where you want the ball to end
              up to.
Chris (PS05X) [5223] Right , right, [...] .
David (PS107) [5224] [...] .
              [5225] That's what I was trying to do, I don't mind if it goes
              off
Chris (PS05X) [5226] You, oh, right.
David (PS107) [5227] cos I don't think, [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5228] Right, right, that was your object to get it as far away
              from the competition as possible really.
David (PS107) [5229] Well, yeah, [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5230] Yes.
David (PS107) [5231] Erm, try and get it stop near the [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5232] I see, I see what you mean, yes, yes, yes, yes, yep got
              you.
David (PS107) [5233] Eh, you can start a game anywhere on this foot ... foot-
              line which is called the [...] line, [...] .
              [5234] One up there.
Chris (PS05X) [5235] Right.
David (PS107) [5236] So you, you would normally start here.
Chris (PS05X) [5237] Yeah.
David (PS107) [5238] Which [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5239] Yeah.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5240] Right, yep, O K.
              [5241] Rather over muscled, control it better yes.
David (PS107) [5242] [...] joining up at my thumb.
Chris (PS05X) [5243] Right.
David (PS107) [5244] Erm [...] quite some distance.
Chris (PS05X) [5245] Quite.
David (PS107) [5246] Cos I wrote, you know that I [...] , be very lucky to make
              it.
Chris (PS05X) [5247] Absolutely, yes.
David (PS107) [5248] Especially at the beginning of the game.
Chris (PS05X) [5249] Yep.
David (PS107) [5250] [...] and eh, [...] ... Ball goes [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5251] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5252] Yeah.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5253] Right.
David (PS107) [5254] [...] can't see, can't remember what the are balls behind
              or wha ... where they are.
Chris (PS05X) [5255] Yes, fine.
David (PS107) [5256] So ... just be a touching ball.
Chris (PS05X) [5257] Yes it is.
David (PS107) [5258] Move over to the blue.
Chris (PS05X) [5259] Yes.
David (PS107) [5260] And you [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5261] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5262] Yes.
David (PS107) [5263] [...] .
              [5264] Yes, you can see when the ball goes off, then [...] you'll
              end up in the far corner.
Chris (PS05X) [5265] Right, right.
David (PS107) [5266] Oh hold on, you've got, you've got a [...] , you could
              have a shot at those [...] , but I think at this stage of the
              game, it'll be best if you did have a shot at the yellow.
Chris (PS05X) [5267] Right.
              [5268] So it, would, would give me some aggression then would it?
David (PS107) [5269] If you hit it, yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5270] [laugh] yes, a very good point ... [hits ball] , ah.
David (PS107) [5271] Not bad, I mean [...] like that.
              [5272] You need to watch where that goes off, almost certainly
              [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5273] Yeah.
David (PS107) [5274] comes up a yard [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5275] Right.
*** 156 (Tape 002704) ***
David (PS107) [5276] Your balls are well separated, [...] I mean, the best I
              can do is [...] take off the yellow, then I can make the [...] .
              [5277] Put it on the one we're going to go through, or the one
              we've been through?
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5278] Oh I see, normally [...] .
              [5279] Right.
*** 157 (Tape 002705) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5280] I see right.
David (PS107) [5281] [...] .
              [5282] When you start is to do a thing, put that mallet down like
              that and then line up the which you need to go.
Chris (PS05X) [5283] I see.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5284] Yes.
David (PS107) [5285] The other ball contact, must be a contact there.
Chris (PS05X) [5286] Yes.
David (PS107) [5287] Just about enough [...] the red from [...] .
              [5288] Now that yellow, that blue ball must move
Chris (PS05X) [5289] Right.
David (PS107) [5290] otherwise it's fault.
              [5291] Now where that centre of that V is [...] where the black
              ball will go.
Chris (PS05X) [5292] Right.
              [5293] Got you.
David (PS107) [5294] I, I don't tend to do it like that at all, I do [hits
              ball] [...] it very nearly go, it's on the wrong side
              unfortunately. [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5295] Yes, yes, it, it did curl with the grass didn't it?
David (PS107) [5296] Yes. [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5297] Right.
              [5298] What you didn't want to do in that case, no
David (PS107) [5299] No . [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5300] Yes indeed.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5301] Right.
David (PS107) [5302] You can [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5303] Yes, I see.
David (PS107) [5304] So it doesn't matter if this ball goes off.
              [5305] [hits ball] Moving slightly the wrong way.
Chris (PS05X) [5306] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5307] Yes.
David (PS107) [5308] [...] , where, where you want the ball to come back.
Chris (PS05X) [5309] I understand, yes, yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5310] Right.
David (PS107) [5311] And there's no benefit of having a row [...] as you had
              before.
Chris (PS05X) [5312] Right.
David (PS107) [5313] [...] .
              [5314] The black would of come up about there.
Chris (PS05X) [5315] Yes.
David (PS107) [5316] Which would've enabled me to rush, [...] up there, but I
              didn't.
Chris (PS05X) [5317] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5318] Right.
              [5319] O K
David (PS107) [5320] Right now you come out [...] or go up to red.
              [5321] I think I would just go up to red
Chris (PS05X) [5322] Yes.
David (PS107) [5323] till you've got the feel of it, I [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5324] Right, fine.
David (PS107) [5325] And the object is to hit red.
Chris (PS05X) [5326] Yes, quite, quite, it's, it's intriguing because it's so
              un ... so different to what I had in mind.
              [5327] [laugh] [hits ball] Eh that was strange stuff ...
*** 158 (Tape 002706) ***
David (PS107) [5328] If I can get it up
Chris (PS05X) [5329] Right.
              [5330] Would it have been better if it had not been a corner
              ball?
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5331] The other side, aha.
David (PS107) [5332] What goes [...] one, two, three, [...] three would be very
              nice.
Chris (PS05X) [5333] Fine.
David (PS107) [5334] Oh, I've got a [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5335] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5336] Yep.
David (PS107) [5337] In great danger when you do it with a [...] cos the other
              ball [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
David (PS107) [5338] You're not aiming a [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5339] Yes. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [5340] That's quite nice [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5341] Yeah, yeah.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5342] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5343] Yes you have.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5344] Oh I see, you can start in that hoop as well can you?
David (PS107) [5345] No, I want to go down there.
Chris (PS05X) [5346] No, no, you still want to get back down there.
David (PS107) [5347] Oh yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [5348] Even though you start from that corner, you can't go
              through that hoop.
David (PS107) [5349] Oh no [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5350] The hoop on the opposite side first time, right, I see.
*** 159 (Tape 002707) ***
David (PS107) [5351] That's not bad.
Chris (PS05X) [5352] No, that's pretty good.
David (PS107) [5353] It doesn't matter where [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5354] No, I need blue at this stage, yellow you need now.
David (PS107) [5355] Or indeed, one, even if, even if the yellow goes off [...]
              .
Chris (PS05X) [5356] O K.
David (PS107) [5357] [...] . [hits ball]
Chris (PS05X) [5358] Smashing.
David (PS107) [5359] Well, [...] a bit better [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5360] Yes.
David (PS107) [5361] The rest was [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5362] No, no, [sniff] the red's not terribly helpful to you at
              the moment.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5363] Yes, yes, yes. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5364] Right. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [5365] [...] curled round [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5366] Yes.
David (PS107) [5367] Erm
Chris (PS05X) [5368] That was erm
David (PS107) [5369] You've got to move this ball
Chris (PS05X) [5370] O K.
David (PS107) [5371] cos if you don't, I shall just [...] your black to a take
              on
Chris (PS05X) [5372] Yes.
David (PS107) [5373] and I've got a ball in my hoop.
Chris (PS05X) [5374] I see.
David (PS107) [5375] That's the ball you've got to [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5376] Yes, fine.
David (PS107) [5377] You can have a shot at red, you can do that, then I will
              do exactly what I did just now.
Chris (PS05X) [5378] Yes.
David (PS107) [5379] Try and eh, I shall, probably get it even better, mind,
              most people would have a shot at those two I think
Chris (PS05X) [5380] Yes, O K.
David (PS107) [5381] cos you're not giving very much away.
Chris (PS05X) [5382] Right.
David (PS107) [5383] The other alternative is just to go off in that corner
              over there.
              [5384] It's very negative.
Chris (PS05X) [5385] Well, I yes, yes, I [laugh] doesn't appeal to me at all.
              [laugh]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5386] Yes, right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5387] Move, move, move it out, right.
              [5388] Right I shall go for the blue, well actually, [...] black,
              black is better cos blue went squiffy.
David (PS107) [5389] Well [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5390] Yes that's true.
              [5391] Ah.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5392] Right, right yes.
*** 160 (Tape 002708) ***
David (PS107) [5393] Eh, you can see where the [...] was there.
Chris (PS05X) [5394] Yep.
David (PS107) [5395] Probably somewhere round here, must be.
Chris (PS05X) [5396] Other side? [...] .
David (PS107) [5397] Got to be this side.
Chris (PS05X) [5398] Right.
              [5399] Fine.
David (PS107) [5400] Not a very accurate [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5401] No.
David (PS107) [5402] [...] .
              [5403] One of the problems was really was [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5404] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5405] Yep.
David (PS107) [5406] I've already [...] so I've had it.
Chris (PS05X) [5407] Oh bad luck.
David (PS107) [5408] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5409] Yes.
David (PS107) [5410] So I've [...] , well what I can do is go down there.
              [5411] Unfortunately that's right in the way.
              [5412] [hits ball] I've got a continuation shot, well what I
              shall do is just try and line them up for a rush down to [...] ,
              which is not bad.
Chris (PS05X) [5413] No.
              [5414] Fine.
David (PS107) [5415] O K.
Chris (PS05X) [5416] O K.
David (PS107) [5417] I think probably that red
Chris (PS05X) [5418] Yes, back down here again?
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5419] Yes I have, yes.
David (PS107) [5420] Erm, take [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5421] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5422] But it's still best to remove the temptation here.
David (PS107) [5423] Yeah, it would.
Chris (PS05X) [5424] Right, right.
David (PS107) [5425] [...] down here. [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5426] Right, O K.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5427] Right.
David (PS107) [5428] So what, what most people do, is when they bring the
              mallets back, they tend to twist them.
Chris (PS05X) [5429] Aha.
              [5430] Yes.
David (PS107) [5431] It's easy when you're pushing forward to keep it straight,
              it's when you bring it back it tends to twist.
Chris (PS05X) [5432] Surely.
David (PS107) [5433] So try and concentrate on bringing it back and then,
              bring, I mean, you can bring it back fairly slowly.
Chris (PS05X) [5434] Alright, oh fine, yes. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [5435] Very good, it's nice to see you hitting a ball like that.
Chris (PS05X) [5436] Yes, it felt good too.
David (PS107) [5437] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5438] You could actually feel it working well.
David (PS107) [5439] Yes, you brought the mallet back nice and slowly.
Chris (PS05X) [5440] And I was aiming between them to be honest. [laugh]
David (PS107) [5441] You obviously could of got [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5442] O K, I should, yes.
David (PS107) [5443] Erm, you can always stop and ask.
Chris (PS05X) [5444] Yes.
David (PS107) [5445] The trouble is you can make, there's a lot of people, it's
              very easy when you're concentrating on what you're going to do
              next, you forget the colour you're playing.
Chris (PS05X) [5446] Yes.
David (PS107) [5447] Especially when you're making a break, so having made the
              [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5448] Right.
David (PS107) [5449] So you know you're playing with red.
Chris (PS05X) [5450] I see, yes.
David (PS107) [5451] Cos don't forget you're playing with two balls.
Chris (PS05X) [5452] Quite.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5453] Right.
David (PS107) [5454] Eh, the danger is, if you don't, then, break down, if you
              leave my blue near the er black break down then I'm just going to
              get back in.
Chris (PS05X) [5455] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5456] So, with, if a very difficult shot, what what I'll do is
              just [...] .
              [5457] Let's just do a [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5458] To, to, not necessarily to hit the black, but to
David (PS107) [5459] No not necessarily.
Chris (PS05X) [5460] Right, O K, [...] .
*** 161 (Tape 002709) ***
David (PS107) [5461] Just a little tap, that's all, you need .
Chris (PS05X) [5462] Yes , fine, O K.
David (PS107) [5463] [...] .
              [5464] That's lovely, yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5465] Good.
David (PS107) [5466] Now, what you can do is try and cut it towards the middle
              of your line of aim [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5467] Yes.
David (PS107) [5468] On that side.
Chris (PS05X) [5469] Fine.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5470] No, the red, yes.
David (PS107) [5471] The black.
Chris (PS05X) [5472] The black, the black.
David (PS107) [5473] Doesn't matter about the red.
Chris (PS05X) [5474] O K, fine.
              [5475] I'm aiming left to the black, yes?
David (PS107) [5476] Yes, that's right, slightly off, [...] to the left.
Chris (PS05X) [5477] Right, fine.
*** 162 (Tape 002710) ***
David (PS107) [5478] Slightly off centre [...] .
              [5479] Because of the danger of that ball jumping, you hit over
              the top like that, it'll jump.
Chris (PS05X) [5480] Yes.
David (PS107) [5481] You, you take up the normal [...] I don't tend to do this,
              but this is really the best way to do the shot.
Chris (PS05X) [5482] Yes.
David (PS107) [5483] Take up your normal start and then just tap the back a
              little bit cos you're hitting that ball on the upward swing then
              and there's no danger that you're gonna jump over it.
              [5484] See if you'll try and get it to jump if you [hits ball]
              [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5485] Yes , yes, yep.
David (PS107) [5486] Very, very easy to get the finger on the
Chris (PS05X) [5487] Fine.
David (PS107) [5488] Erm, bumpy lawns, jump that over ball.
Chris (PS05X) [5489] Right.
              [5490] So step back and hit ... hit it on the up stroke.
David (PS107) [5491] Yeah, and try and ground the mallet a little bit, cos then
              the black ball will go quite nicely down there.
Chris (PS05X) [5492] Oh right, fine.
*** 163 (Tape 002711) ***
David (PS107) [5493] The difficulty of this shot is trying to, trying [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5494] You've got to get it to absolutely
David (PS107) [5495] You, I would normally if you're my opponent, I would say,
              Chris would you like to come and watch this shot?
Chris (PS05X) [5496] I see, yes.
David (PS107) [5497] So that you could, if you're sitting over there, and I
              take the shot it's not fair on you cos you don't know.
Chris (PS05X) [5498] Yes.
David (PS107) [5499] So what I've got to do is to try and get down to that, but
              do I actually stop the mallet dead when it, as it hits the blue,
              because if, I don't wanna move the blue ball, but, if, if I was
              to play it like that it would be an obvious crush [...] the ball
              into the mallet.
Chris (PS05X) [5500] Yes , yes.
David (PS107) [5501] I mean, there again, you're seeing these players doing it,
              when you say [...] , oh what [...] , and you know they don't call
              somebody over to have a look at [...] .
              [5502] Don't have to say
Chris (PS05X) [5503] Yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5504] would you like to come and putt the shot [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5505] Right, right.
David (PS107) [5506] Erm, you can usually tell by the [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5507] No.
David (PS107) [5508] It's only the one [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5509] Indeed, indeed, yes.
David (PS107) [5510] That's why I told you the difference, you can't really
Chris (PS05X) [5511] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5512] Shall I put my clip on there?
David (PS107) [5513] Yes you should.
Chris (PS05X) [5514] Right.
*** 164 (Tape 002712) ***
David (PS107) [5515] Assume I'm not here.
Chris (PS05X) [5516] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5517] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5518] Yep.
              [5519] Right.
              [5520] Presumably kicking the opponent's ball, it's, it's not
              acceptable.
David (PS107) [5521] [...] , it's not a fault, the only time it's a fault is
              when you're erm, I don't know the words really, when you're
              actually in play, so if you were to take a, if you were actually
              doing this
Chris (PS05X) [5522] Is that right?
              [5523] Yes.
David (PS107) [5524] then, that's a fault.
Chris (PS05X) [5525] Oh, yes .
David (PS107) [5526] It's actually taken.
Chris (PS05X) [5527] I understand, yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5528] Yes.
David (PS107) [5529] [...] , I'm still in play as it were, and I do that then
              it's [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5530] Right, right, I see.
David (PS107) [5531] But it's not a fault if you, erm, sort of walk up to that
              ball and erm, do this, it's not a fault.
Chris (PS05X) [5532] No, I see.
David (PS107) [5533] O K?
Chris (PS05X) [5534] Yes, good, O K.
*** 165 (Tape 002713) ***
David (PS107) [5535] What you really want to do is to get together through to
              there don't you?
Chris (PS05X) [5536] Yes.
David (PS107) [5537] Or there, so you can rush, [...] across to there.
Chris (PS05X) [5538] Fine ... Oh twit, [laugh]
David (PS107) [5539] Put it back where it was and then [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5540] Yes, quite, quite, out, I think I thought it was going to
              shudder against the post and the hoop and
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5541] Yes. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [5542] Lovely, great [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5543] Right, yep.
*** 166 (Tape 002714) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5544] Putting the red, thank you, erm somewhere here.
David (PS107) [5545] That's it, isn't it [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5546] Yes, right, right, yep. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [5547] You've got to get [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5548] Yes.
David (PS107) [5549] cos the red goes straight line always, doesn't matter
              whether you hit it like that, that, that, that, that red ball
              will always [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5550] It'll move away on all through the line of contact, right.
David (PS107) [5551] O K?
Chris (PS05X) [5552] Yes.
David (PS107) [5553] The one that does take reflection [...] , but I think
              you've got to aim really for that wire.
Chris (PS05X) [5554] Yes, yes, good.
*** 167 (Tape 002715) ***
David (PS107) [5555] That's the trouble having got this far
Chris (PS05X) [5556] I mean, you having stood there, I was deliberately aiming
              to, to strike that one.
David (PS107) [5557] [...] , got straight through it.
Chris (PS05X) [5558] Going straight through anyway, right, fine.
              [5559] I'm not capable of these weeny deflections anyway, so I
              don't know why the heck I'm bothering. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [5560] Always try to be behind the other ball when you come
              through the hoop, because you're going that way, you see?
Chris (PS05X) [5561] Yes.
David (PS107) [5562] Erm, but erm, what I really wanted to do was to cover
              about [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5563] Oh [...] , oh sorry, it's ... it's the next one we're
              aiming at, the one we're aiming at isn't it yes.
David (PS107) [5564] Yes, so to cut red, [...] down, near that black ball is,
              lovely.
Chris (PS05X) [5565] Yes.
David (PS107) [5566] There is a danger of [...] red ball, you have a cut [...]
              .
Chris (PS05X) [5567] Right, O K.
David (PS107) [5568] Hit it on the right, [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5569] Yep.
*** 168 (Tape 002716) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5570] Right.
David (PS107) [5571] To the right, yes.
              [5572] To ... to the right?
Chris (PS05X) [5573] Yellow ball [...] .
David (PS107) [5574] Of course I'm sorry, for some strange reason I thought we
              were going that way, I've got to go through the other way haven't
              I?
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [5575] It, it's always from the out outside in, yes?
Chris (PS05X) [5576] Well, except for on the way back.
David (PS107) [5577] Ah.
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [5578] Right.
*** 169 (Tape 002717) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5579] You've got to really get to the right of that red, so
              [...] can rush it down to the, left of that hoop with the red
              paint on it.
David (PS107) [5580] Right, so
Chris (PS05X) [5581] Erm, what, the nice shot is to get back up to, there and
              get over to the yellow.
              [5582] I don't know whether you're going to do it.
David (PS107) [5583] Right, so black down there, yellow over there, O K.
Chris (PS05X) [5584] [...] .
              [5585] [...] show you, then you [...]
David (PS107) [5586] Yes please.
Chris (PS05X) [5587] [...] .
              [5588] I'm going to get the line in [...] two balls where the
              black [...] . [...] .
David (PS107) [5589] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5590] Then eh, [...] on the ball's [...] .
David (PS107) [5591] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [5592] Yes, yes.
*** 170 (Tape 002718) ***
David (PS107) [5593] I've got to get up to that next [...] .
              [5594] [hits ball] I put the yellow up onto hoop three, [...]
              [hits ball] Gone the wrong side.
Chris (PS05X) [5595] [...] .
              [5596] Yellow's nice, yeah, ah.
David (PS107) [5597] I don't think I'll have a chance [...] .
Chris (PS05X) [5598] Yes.
              [5599] Can you change your own ball during a go?
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5600] Right. [hits ball]
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5601] Right, right.
*** 171 (Tape 002719) ***
David (PS107) [5602] I think you've got to move the yellow near one of my
              hoops.
Chris (PS05X) [5603] Right.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5604] Now that's your next hoop isn't it?
David (PS107) [5605] Yes. [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5606] I am, I am indeed, yes, yes, I ... I've got to deal with
              it some way, somehow.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5607] Move yellow onto red.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5608] Yes, yes, O K.
*** 172 (Tape 002720) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5609] What would've happened if the red ball had gone through?
David (PS107) [5610] Nothing.
Chris (PS05X) [5611] Nothing.
David (PS107) [5612] If it had been your hoop, it would've count.
Chris (PS05X) [5613] [laugh] , yes, yes, you ... you would of [...] .
              [5614] Yep, good.
David (PS107) [...]
*** 173 (Tape 002721) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5615] The ball, I've got a ball near my next two anyway
David (PS107) [5616] Mm mm.
Chris (PS05X) [5617] and I've got to [hits ball] , another out of, in play,
              which is always useful.
              [5618] [hits ball] Right [...] .
David (PS107) [5619] Right.
*** 174 (Tape 002722) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5620] Presumably when you do land in a position like that even
              though as you say you're getting near the end of the game for the
              blue ball, you wouldn't deliberately not go through the hoop, if
              you'll put in that, if you put yourself in that position?
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5621] You, [...] , no, you ... you'd of played away.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5622] Yes.
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5623] Right, right.
David (PS107) [5624] Now, I've really got to start thinking about where I want
              the ball to be.
Chris (PS05X) [5625] Mm.
David (PS107) [5626] When a [...] , it would be nice to have yellow, that
              yellow's fairly near the hoop [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5627] Yes.
David (PS107) [5628] so if I can get that.
Chris (PS05X) [5629] Yes.
David (PS107) [5630] Mm.
Chris (PS05X) [5631] Shall I go and get the tea? [hits ball]

              so on and so forth, I mean it's

Chris (PS05X) [5695] And you take part in most of these competitions?
*** 178 (Tape 002801) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5696] It's the best thing of course so ... It's a very weird
              thing to be doing really isn't it?
David (PS107) [5697] [...] You can leave it there if you want even though it's
              the ladies [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5698] Yeah.
              [5699] Thank you
David (PS107) [5700] [...] club house just to the left.
Chris (PS05X) [5701] Right.
              [5702] There's certainly a fancy er club house there isn't it?
              [5703] What's what's this fancy building here David?
Chris (PS05X) [5704] Squash.
David (PS107) [5705] Oh!
              [5706] Is it?
              [5707] Right.
Chris (PS05X) [...]
David (PS107) [5708] Aha.
Chris (PS05X) [5709] [...] ... why we can't get on there, on the door
Chris (PS05X) [5710] Yes ... fine.
David (PS107) [5711] Yes there's quite a ... lay out in the main building.
Chris (PS05X) [5712] Right
David (PS107) [5713] Croquet and squash.
              [5714] Bowls down the side [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5715] Oh yes.
David (PS107) [5716] It used to be about the best bowling green in the in this
              part of the country.
Chris (PS05X) [5717] Did it really?
              [5718] Yes.
              [5719] Only the one tennis court?
David (PS107) [5720] No there's one there there's one here.
Chris (PS05X) [5721] Oh yes.
David (PS107) [5722] Over there that's ... behind me that's ...
Chris (PS05X) [5723] Oh yes, yes.
David (PS107) [5724] I am not sure whether it's those certainly where you can
              see the right players [...] .
              [5725] Eileen's husband is the leading light in the bowls.
Chris (PS05X) [5726] Oh is he?
              [5727] Really?
              [5728] And is that ah er another cricket team altogether or what?
              [5729] Club altogether?
David (PS107) [5730] That's another club.
              [5731] Yes.
              [5732] This is the [...] club [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5733] Right.
              [5734] Yes.
David (PS107) [5735] I think he he had a heart attack recently.
              [5736] [...] I think he is off of it now but I think he must be
              quite a leading light
Chris (PS05X) [5737] Yes yes.
David (PS107) [5738] [...] speak to David .
Chris (PS05X) [5739] Oh was he?
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5740] [laugh] Yes.
              [5741] Oh!
              [5742] Oh!
              [5743] Yes yes indeed now, now I'm there and there aren't I?
David (PS107) [5744] Now if you were using this this is what we would do.
              [5745] It's probably [...] erm, yeah I think you'd probably have
              a shot at your yellow.
              [5746] Doesn't matter if you go off because you could come up
              behind it
Chris (PS05X) [5747] Mmm mmm
Chris (PS05X) [5748] and [...] it once
David (PS107) [5749] Yes yes.
              [5750] Fine.
*** 179 (Tape 002802) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5751] Right.
              [5752] I could actually feel that in in my wrists yes
David (PS107) [5753] Soon as you think you're going to tense up too much you
              try the swing of the mallet.
Chris (PS05X) [5754] Right.
              [5755] Right so that's
David (PS107) [5756] Well I think what you do is push the yellow somewhere
              towards the peg in the middle.
              [5757] Probably just the right [...] you know, run.
Chris (PS05X) [5758] Yes
David (PS107) [5759] Get the yellow to the right of the peg.
Chris (PS05X) [5760] Fine.
David (PS107) [5761] Doesn't matter if you don't.
*** 180 (Tape 002803) ***
David (PS107) [5762] If you kind of drop down behind the blue if you use the
              blue first and the bat's up there you gotta go sort of near to it
              to get behind you're going to rush down to your hoop.
              [5763] Now you've got a much easier shot haven't you?
Chris (PS05X) [5764] Yes
David (PS107) [5765] You can just push blue back over there and and, or if you
              are not happy about that just a little take up.
              [5766] Bearing in mind that a take up is always a much more
              accurate shot, specially for beginners.
              [5767] It's just a little tiny tap and you're gonna ...
Chris (PS05X) [5768] That's it
David (PS107) [5769] get right about there aren't you?
Chris (PS05X) [5770] Yep.
              [5771] Fine.
*** 181 (Tape 002804) ***
Chris (PS05X) [laugh]
David (PS107) [5772] Jolly good direction, but ...
Chris (PS05X) [5773] [laugh] Too jolly heavy.
David (PS107) [5774] Very good.
              [5775] That's lovely ...
Chris (PS05X) [5776] Gosh!
              [5777] Fourth time at last
David (PS107) [5778] No, you've got the wave right I mean you know
Chris (PS05X) [5779] Yes.
              [5780] Yes.
David (PS107) [5781] I mean you know loads of people like this don't always get
              it right.
Chris (PS05X) [5782] Really.
              [5783] Yes.
David (PS107) [5784] You want a nice little bit of lawn there.
              [5785] That's another thing that should be looked at because ...
Chris (PS05X) [5786] Yes.
              [5787] Yes
David (PS107) [5788] you could be on a rough patch or bumpy patch whatever yes
              yes
Chris (PS05X) [5789] Weedy patch yes, yes fine.
David (PS107) [5790] So you can rush that blue down to the one now
Chris (PS05X) [5791] Down beyond of the hoop ideally.
              [5792] Yes.
*** 182 (Tape 002805) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5793] That was probably ...
David (PS107) [5794] I rather overdid the angle too didn't I, the cut?
Chris (PS05X) [5795] Yeah, I think it's about, isn't it surely?
              [5796] That's a I'm very lucky I don't really have problems with
              the angles
David (PS107) [5797] Good.
Chris (PS05X) [5798] ... at all but it's just [...] .
              [5799] Yes it's much better.
David (PS107) [5800] Right.
Chris (PS05X) [5801] Try a try a shot with a [...] which would be a roll won't
              it?
*** 183 (Tape 002806) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5802] Most most people play this er with a fairly conventional
              croquet stroke because the black ball's the blue ball's gonna go
              twice the distance of the red.
              [5803] Isn't it?
David (PS107) [5804] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5805] Roughly.
David (PS107) [5806] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5807] So really just I I always have problems, I I always tend
              to play it down like that, I don't know why.
              [5808] But most, you should really stand up and play it with
              fairly, [...] play together.
              [5809] You can't for real you can't really move blue ball you can
              move the red ball as much as you like but not ... What you have
              to do is to ... so just try a normally conventional ... just
              sling straight through here
David (PS107) [5810] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X) [5811] You're doing what I was always doing [...] the red, the
              yellow, but try it again.
David (PS107) [5812] Yeah it was the red near the yellow you mean.
              [5813] Yes.
Lynda (PS102) [5814] Ivan Ivan! [...]
Susan (PS103) [5815] Okay.
Chris (PS05X) [5816] You can go now.
David (PS107) [5817] Right.
Chris (PS05X) [5818] Hang on a bit.
              [5819] Try and step it forward [...]
David (PS107) [5820] Right [...] Yep.
              [5821] I was pushing wasn't I?
Chris (PS05X) [5822] [...] If I still was going down I'd do it like that
David (PS107) [5823] Lovely!
              [5824] Yes
Chris (PS05X) [5825] or the blue I mean the red's gone all right.
              [5826] But that's what we're trying to do, trying [...]
David (PS107) [5827] Right.
              [5828] Okay.
Chris (PS05X) [5829] [...] ... play the shot like that way, but I think
              whatever works for you.
*** 184 (Tape 002807) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5830] Well that's what counts isn't it?
David (PS107) [5831] Yes.
Chris (PS05X) [5832] So I'm now going straight for the black?
David (PS107) [5833] Oh no.
              [5834] You can move the yellow, can't you?
Chris (PS05X) [5835] Oh yes.
              [5836] Yes I see.
David (PS107) [5837] What I would do, because you haven't got a blue [...] hard
              enough is to push yellow off somewhere to the left of black
Chris (PS05X) [5838] Yes?
David (PS107) [5839] so you can only push it across to three and get near the
              yellow, near the black.
Chris (PS05X) [5840] Right.
David (PS107) [5841] You must you must get at least a ball a pioneer ball near
              your next two
Chris (PS05X) [5842] Right.
David (PS107) [5843] to stand a chance.
Chris (PS05X) [5844] Okay.
              [5845] Fine.
*** 185 (Tape 002808) ***
David (PS107) [5846] So you come up behind it so that your body and the
              striker's ball, that being your red ball and the other ball, the
              object ball are always the same straight line I mean it doesn't
              matter whether you come in from the side you're walking up to it
              in a straight line put your mallet down, swing it through.
Chris (PS05X) [5847] Yes.
              [5848] Lovely.
              [5849] Yes it all looks so darned easy when you do it David
              [laugh] .
              [5850] Yes.
David (PS107) [5851] [...] I don't think it would be worth playing if it's
              easy.
Chris (PS05X) [5852] No.
              [5853] Absolutely.
              [5854] Absolutely and the that's why the
David (PS107) [5855] You can't expect to get anything out of practice ...
Chris (PS05X) [5856] ... unless you concentrate on it Yes.
              [5857] Yes.
              [5858] Yes.
David (PS107) [5859] That's it.
              [5860] Now that was a nice hit.
              [5861] That's not quite [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5862] Not hard enough
David (PS107) [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5863] Yes.
David (PS107) [5864] Put the other way it was a good stroke.
              [5865] You can get over to over to bat.
              [5866] You don't need to be very near bat, do you?
              [5867] So you know again I tend to hit it downwards you see, but
              a lot of players don't even er lot of players play their rolls
              like that.
              [5868] I tend to.. you know a lot of players don't play any side
              shots they play all their shots like that.
Chris (PS05X) [5869] Do they? yes.
              [5870] Yes.
David (PS107) [5871] I tend to think it's easier to play at the side, because
              you can actually do that if you want.
Chris (PS05X) [5872] Yes
David (PS107) [5873] You can, you know I can [...] I can get two balls to
              almost roll from corner to corner by doing
Chris (PS05X) [5874] Yes yes yes
David (PS107) [5875] So try it like that and swing your mallet too so you won't
              be able to go above hoop three and [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5876] Right.
David (PS107) [5877] Right.
Chris (PS05X) [5878] Okay.
David (PS107) [5879] You've got to stand forward a little bit more, haven't
              you?
              [5880] You've got to play down on to the ball.
Chris (PS05X) [5881] Right.
              [5882] Right.
David (PS107) [5883] So bring your feet forward a little
Chris (PS05X) [5884] You mean further forward.
              [5885] Right.
David (PS107) [5886] Lovely.
              [5887] Yes lovely.
              [5888] Very good.
              [5889] Now that's pretty well perfect, isn't it?
Chris (PS05X) [5890] Smashing yes.
              [5891] Yes.
              [5892] That's good.
              [5893] Yes.
              [5894] Yes.
David (PS107) [5895] You can still cut back over to the to about there.
Chris (PS05X) [5896] No no I wanting to get ...
David (PS107) [5897] You want to hit croquet plan?
Chris (PS05X) [5898] Yes.
              [5899] To to get to there.
David (PS107) [5900] You can then do a nice little shot to get closer on the
              hoop with red
Chris (PS05X) [5901] Right.
David (PS107) [5902] Put black over there somewhere.
Chris (PS05X) [5903] Right.
David (PS107) [5904] Put your mallet on the floor.
Chris (PS05X) [5905] Right yes yes good point ... yeah just right.
David (PS107) [5906] Right that's a nice approach [...] should be able to get
              the red somewhere
Chris (PS05X) [5907] Yes
David (PS107) [5908] [...] there it is a little roll shot.
Chris (PS05X) [5909] Right.
David (PS107) [5910] If you do you're gonna play it by [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5911] Do you prefer this would you?
David (PS107) [5912] Well I think you should do what you feel comfortable at
              most most you you ... there again if you saw Vincent playing, he
              just plays it standing up.
              [5913] Well yes pretty good
Chris (PS05X) [5914] Is it?
David (PS107) [5915] except you've got a slight problem, haven't you?
              [5916] Cos you can't really get that red through without crushing
              it.
Chris (PS05X) [5917] Ah ah I really didn't understand the crushing bit, sorry.
David (PS107) [5918] Well, if I do that, that's a crush cos my mallet's in
              contact whilst the ball's in contact with the hoop.
Chris (PS05X) [5919] Right.
David (PS107) [5920] I'm crushing the ball against the hoop.
              [5921] Your problem is that you because the line of that ball is
              overhanging the wire
Chris (PS05X) [5922] Yes
David (PS107) [5923] even if you played it like that it's still a crush.
Chris (PS05X) [5924] Yes Yes
David (PS107) [5925] [...] mallet you're play [...] really you've got no choice
              but to come back.
Chris (PS05X) [5926] Right right.
David (PS107) [5927] I don't know.
              [5928] It's a very difficult one I think in a game that probably
              they'd just let you do that.
Chris (PS05X) [5929] Aha
David (PS107) [5930] It did sound to me like a crush, because you've really got
              to play away from the mallet haven't you?
Chris (PS05X) [5931] The the that's the the the correct procedure is it, to
              play away rather than a
David (PS107) [5932] I think most people would consider I mean if you can
              picture the [...] course of the ball, it's gonna do that, isn't
              it?
Chris (PS05X) [5933] Mm
David (PS107) [5934] Your mallet is going to be is gotta be in contact with the
              mallet the ball whilst the ball is in contact with the wire
Chris (PS05X) [5935] Yes yes yes
David (PS107) [5936] you can't
*** 186 (Tape 002809) ***
Chris (PS05X) [5937] No I didn't.
              [5938] No!
              [5939] I was just thinking should
David (PS107) [5940] Join up?
Chris (PS05X) [5941] Should I be? ...
David (PS107) [5942] Well I think you should join up because something's put in
              the middle but depends ... in a game [...] If I was playing
              against a level player you might just have a very hard crack
              together, but just to join up gently in the middle.
Chris (PS05X) [5943] Right right fine.
David (PS107) [5944] If you miss , you're still playing [...]
Chris (PS05X) [5945] Yes
*** 187 (Tape 002810) ***
Chris (PS05X)  [5946] I didn't show you this David.
               [5947] That's that's what it's about.
David (PS107)  [5948] The Longman Treasury of Spoken English
Chris (PS05X)  [5949] And they're simply recording an awful lot of people in
               conversation.
David (PS107)  [5950] Oh yes.
Chris (PS05X)  [5951] Erm and they will keep them in the archives and I suppose
               transcribe them or something of the sort.
David (PS107)  [5952] Yes interesting.
Chris (PS05X)  [5953] Yes, yes it is rather intriguing.
               [5954] They just knocked at the door and said how would you care
               to take part?
Evelyn (PS108) [5955] [...] just [...] stroke.
David (PS107)  [...] [laugh]
Chris (PS05X)  [5956] Oh yes, and of course when you have it for two days you
               can't actually guard your language all the time [laugh]
David (PS107)  [5957] I don't suppose they really want you to, do they?
Chris (PS05X)  [5958] No I'm certain they don't.
               [5959] That's the last thing they want.
Evelyn (PS108) [5960] Hardly ever.
               [5961] What never.
               [5962] Well hardly ever.
               [5963] I'm always criticizing on the B B C and I T V.
David (PS107)  [5964] About the English?
Chris (PS05X)  [5965] Oh yes.
               [5966] There's certainly plenty to criticize there, isn't there?
Evelyn (PS108) [5967] I've got a bee in my bonnet about it.
Chris (PS05X)  [5968] Isn't it a good job we're perfect, eh? [laugh]
Evelyn (PS108) [5969] [...] And there's the controversy, which I don't approve
               of controversy and they [...] rather roll their tongues around
               and in and out of words and ... [laugh]
Chris (PS05X)  [5970] Don't you think that's one of the beauties of English
               though?
David (PS107)  [5971] The problem is slightly in that
Evelyn (PS108) [5972] Formidable isn't she.
               [5973] Formidable.
Chris (PS05X)  [5974] Yes formidable I agree.
David (PS107)  [5975] But word word pronunciations gets changed just by common
               usage don't they?
Chris (PS05X)  [5976] Yes they do.
               [5977] They do indeed.
               [5978] Yes. [laugh]
Evelyn (PS108) [5979] Peculiar day for the first of June, isn't it?
David (PS107)  [...]
David (PS107)  [5980] It's National Croquet Day did you remember that?
Evelyn (PS108) [5981] National Croquet Day?
David (PS107)  [5982] Mmm.
Evelyn (PS108) [5983] Is it?
David (PS107)  [5984] Yes.
Evelyn (PS108) [5985] Who told you that?
David (PS107)  [5986] Er I think I learnt that when I went to the meeting of
               the South East Croquet Federation earlier in the year.
Evelyn (PS108) [5987] Oh yes, when I was [...]
Chris (PS05X)  [5988] Yes you said David that in fact it was arranged a little
               late and some clubs didn't manage to fit it into their
               programme.
David (PS107)  [5989] Well no.
Chris (PS05X)  [5990] Yes.
David (PS107)  [5991] We we had an open day last Sunday, or Sunday before, I
               forget.
Chris (PS05X)  [5992] Yes yes fair enough but
David (PS107)  [5993] We could have held it today if we thought
Chris (PS05X)  [5994] Right.
Evelyn (PS108) [5995] When was it held?
David (PS107)  [5996] The open day?
               [5997] You you [...]
Evelyn (PS108) [5998] No I don't mean how [...]
David (PS107)  [5999] Oh no.
               [6000] Do you mean the ...
Evelyn (PS108) [6001] You said you went on the ticket ...
David (PS107)  [6002] Oh South East Croquet Federation Committee Meeting.
               [6003] Yes.
               [6004] That was in Steven's house I think that was
David (PS107)  [6005] The other one Caterham the other one
Evelyn (PS108) [6006] Was that the A G M or
David (PS107)  [6007] Er ... no that was [...] A G M.
               [6008] Where David used to live
Evelyn (PS108) [6009] Oh really?
David (PS107)  [6010] who founded the South East Croquet Federation.
               [6011] Yes he moved to France.
Chris (PS05X)  [6012] Is that David the designer?
David (PS107)  [6013] No.
Chris (PS05X)  [6014] No.
Evelyn (PS108) [...]
David (PS107)  [6015] Northern France.
               [6016] But I can't remember the name of the
Evelyn (PS108) [...]
David (PS107)  [6017] Oh yes.
Evelyn (PS108) [...]
David (PS107)  [6018] He still is involved with croquet because you see he
               organizes this week at erm [...] later in the year.
Evelyn (PS108) [6019] Oh yes [...]
David (PS107)  [6020] Yes, that's right yes.
Evelyn (PS108) [6021] [...] ... navigation.
David (PS107)  [6022] Who?
Evelyn (PS108) [6023] My daughter.
David (PS107)  [6024] Oh is she?
Evelyn (PS108) [6025] Oh yes.
               [6026] I'm going down in about a month's time. [...]
Bill (PS104)   [6027] Italian coast ... [...] .
David (PS107)  [6028] Yes.
Evelyn (PS108) [6029] ... David [...] not as far as St Tropez where [...]
David (PS107)  [6030] Horrible aren't they those oil slicks they're dreadful.
               [6031] Have you always lived in this area, Evelyn?
Evelyn (PS108) [6032] Yes, [...] ... home town. [...] ...
David (PS107)  [6033] Sorry which is your home town?
Evelyn (PS108) [6034] Bournemouth.
David (PS107)  [6035] Oh lovely yes I like Bournemouth
Evelyn (PS108) [6036] [...] ... thank you so much very kind of you.
David (PS107)  [6037] Pleasure.
Evelyn (PS108) [6038] Thanks awfully.
Chris (PS05X)  [6039] Nice to meet you Evelyn.
Evelyn (PS108) [6040] [...] ... Thank you very much.
Chris (PS05X)  [6041] Ah.
               [6042] Well you may see me again you never know [laugh] I shall
               look forward to it.
               [6043] Cheerio.
David (PS107)  [6044] Funny old thing.
Chris (PS05X)  [6045] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6046] Not a clue I don't think ...
Chris (PS05X)  [6047] Really?
David (PS107)  [6048] Ah [laugh] what she gets out of it I just don't know.
               [6049] Companionship I suppose.
Chris (PS05X)  [6050] Yes yes.
David (PS107)  [6051] Shame.
               [6052] Oh well I suppose it's something isn't it?
               [6053] If she gets that out of it.
Chris (PS05X)  [6054] Yes yes and it's fresh air gentle exercise, isn't it?
David (PS107)  [6055] Yes yes and it means she does get out and does see other
               people.
Chris (PS05X)  [6056] Yes yes indeed.
               [6057] Does she tend to walk down when she goes?
David (PS107)  [...]
Chris (PS05X)  [6058] Oh does she?
David (PS107)  [6059] She did drive until last year but I would imagine that
               she's probably no longer safe driving.
Chris (PS05X)  [6060] Sure
David (PS107)  [6061] She's had two or three accidents in [...] .
               [6062] She's a goodly age, you know.
Chris (PS05X)  [6063] Yes.
               [6064] Well I really enjoyed that David.
David (PS107)  [6065] Did you?
               [6066] Good!
Chris (PS05X)  [6067] Yes, yes.
               [6068] It's a ...
David (PS107)  [6069] Do you want to come again? [...] think about it
Chris (PS05X)  [6070] Yes yes.
David (PS107)  [6071] You'll need come a good few times and give it three four
               six months.
Chris (PS05X)  [6072] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6073] I think the books recommend really most players eighteen
               months to two years before you can come.
Chris (PS05X)  [6074] Before you can call yourself a player?
David (PS107)  [6075] Well before you can start setting up a break.
Chris (PS05X)  [6076] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6077] I mean that does vary enormously.
               [6078] ... When you come down from twenty to eight or nine in a
               season, you know
Chris (PS05X)  [6079] Golly!
David (PS107)  [6080] [...] I know.
               [6081] I mean he plays a lot of croquet.
               [6082] He only works three days a week anyway because of lot of
               tournaments [...]
Chris (PS05X)  [6083] Yes yes
David (PS107)  [6084] I mean he started at roughly about the same time as me.
               [6085] I think he's about five and a half five something like
               that.
Chris (PS05X)  [6086] My goodness!
               [6087] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6088] He's probably even less.
               [6089] He's an amazing player to watch, bordering on breaking
               down all the time.
Chris (PS05X)  [laugh]
David (PS107)  [6090] Some of the shots he pulls off are fantastic.
Chris (PS05X)  [6091] Really?
               [6092] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6093] Rather excitable that's the only problem.
Chris (PS05X)  [6094] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6095] Comes from Barnsley.
Chris (PS05X)  [6096] Oh yes.
               [6097] What is his name?
David (PS107)  [6098] Edward .
Chris (PS05X)  [6099] Ah yes.
               [6100] So how do you think the Eden Park problem is going to be
               resolved?
David (PS107)  [6101] What we really need to do is to find some land to play
               on.
               [6102] I've almost given up on the London Borough of Bromley
               because the land, the areas that they've offered us have been
               quite impractical and although we've got, you know, croquet is a
               cheap sport.
               [6103] No clubs have very much money.
               [6104] I mean we've got something like five or six hundred
               pounds
Chris (PS05X)  [6105] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6106] sitting doing nothing.
Chris (PS05X)  [6107] But that doesn't go very far, does it?
David (PS107)  [6108] No.
               [6109] No it doesn't.
               [6110] I did go to [...] Park Manor.
               [6111] I might go back there again.
Chris (PS05X)  [6112] That a good idea.
David (PS107)  [6113] Because they've got the land, but I just didn't get on.
               [6114] What about the Bromley Cricket Club, Tennis Club, Hockey
               Club complex?
Chris (PS05X)  [6115] I honestly don't know David.
               [6116] I genuinely do not know.
David (PS107)  [6117] I really feel in a borough as big as Bromley, which is
               the biggest [...]
Chris (PS05X)  [6118] Yes
David (PS107)  [6119] they must have somewhere where we can play, but erm
               perhaps I ought to ... trouble is that you get fobbed off you
               know.
               [6120] The Mayor, Mayoress said to me well we'll find you
               something but
Chris (PS05X)  [6121] Yes
David (PS107)  [6122] So you you bandy her name about.
               [6123] People jump about for a bit but then having offered you
Chris (PS05X)  [6124] Yes yep.
               [6125] They've done what they feel they should be doing
David (PS107)  [6126] They say well we've offered you three blocks and you've
               turned them all down and you say well yes but you've offered us
               blocks not not
Chris (PS05X)  [6127] Not suitable for the purpose.
               [6128] Yes yes
David (PS107)  [6129] It's not just the erm the fact the area round you need
               it's also the location that's involved
Chris (PS05X)  [6130] Yes indeed.
David (PS107)  [6131] That was part of the problem.
               [6132] We could have gone back to the [...] where we started and
               then we only paid a couple of hundred pounds a year for the land
               that they used to keep the grass cut and everything but the
               problem was really the area.
               [6133] We'd never have been able to build a club up.
Chris (PS05X)  [6134] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6135] And we we really decided that we would be much better not
               having all the hassle and just all joining [...] or joining
               another club.
Chris (PS05X)  [6136] Yes quite quite.
David (PS107)  [6137] It's much easier just belonging to a club and not having
               [...]
Chris (PS05X)  [6138] Yes absolutely yes absolutely.
David (PS107)  [6139] Go there when you want and play and ...
Chris (PS05X)  [6140] It was very nice being there this afternoon and being
               able to walk straight on to the lawn.
David (PS107)  [6141] Yes yes well I think you will find that with most croquet
               clubs
Chris (PS05X)  [6142] Really yes yes
David (PS107)  [6143] I think perhaps the top clubs like [...] I don't I've
               never been there.
               [6144] They are supposed to have the best lawns in the country.
Chris (PS05X)  [6145] Are they?
               [6146] Yes
David (PS107)  [6147] Very good membership.
               [6148] They spend a lot of money. [...]
Bill (PS104)   [6149] In terms of lawns it's the biggest club in the world.
Chris (PS05X)  [6150] Is it?
               [6151] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6152] They've got twelve thirteen lawns there.
Chris (PS05X)  [6153] Gosh!
David (PS107)  [6154] They haven't got the membership.
Chris (PS05X)  [6155] Shame.
David (PS107)  [6156] And of course the upkeep these days is quite high.
Chris (PS05X)  [6157] Yes indeed.
               [6158] There's a sort of general Dulwich Sports Club ground
               keeping facility I assume
David (PS107)  [6159] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)  [6160] for that ground?
               [6161] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6162] I think that perhaps, that croquet is a poor relation,
               but erm to the club itself, I don't know.
               [6163] But I would have thought probably the squash or the bowls
               strictly probably generate more money
Chris (PS05X)  [6164] And the ground is more intensively used perhaps for that?
David (PS107)  [6165] Well that's yes.
               [6166] I think that that that perhaps again one of the problems
               with croquet.
               [6167] It uses up quite an area doesn't it for er mm
Chris (PS05X)  [6168] Well is it any more than a tennis court?
David (PS107)  [6169] Well I suppose a game of tennis doesn't last as long
Chris (PS05X)  [6170] No it doesn't.
               [6171] You can get several games in [...]
David (PS107)  [6172] It is possibly no worse than the cricket ...
Chris (PS05X)  [6173] Sure.
David (PS107)  [6174] area because they have twenty two players, haven't they?
Chris (PS05X)  [6175] Yes [...]
David (PS107)  [6176] Though they are only eleven twelve or thirteen on at any
               one time.
Chris (PS05X)  [6177] Yes.
               [6178] Yes I mean if it is possible to provide that huge acreage
               I mean the space per player or whatever is [laugh] rather less
               for croquet than for cricket, isn't it?
David (PS107)  [6179] Yes, except you need a more perfect lawn that's more
               perfect area
Chris (PS05X)  [6180] Well there are there are green keepers aren't there?
               [6181] I know a guy who bowls at the Bromley Bowling Club in
               [...] exactly and he told me that they have professional green
               keepers who look after lots of different greens and they come
               into them once a week or whatever.
David (PS107)  [6182] Do they?
               [6183] Well that's interesting because we were wondering who we
               could get to have a look at our lawns and tell what's wrong with
               it because they are not very good are they?
Chris (PS05X)  [6184] No no that one we were playing on certainly wasn't the
               greenest and grassiest
David (PS107)  [6185] It's a problem.
               [6186] You will find with a lot of croquet lawns
Chris (PS05X)  [6187] Is it?
               [6188] Yes yes.
David (PS107)  [6189] Well you know somewhere like Bromley Bowling Club would
               have a very good membership.
               [6190] So there's a lot of money coming in they could they could
               afford to have somebody like that
Chris (PS05X)  [6191] Absolutely.
David (PS107)  [6192] looking after their lawns.
Chris (PS05X)  [6193] Absolutely yes.
David (PS107)  [6194] And London Borough of Bromley have got a spare bowling
               green in ... I forget the name of the road but it's in the
               Beckenham area which unless they're doing work to any of the
               main bowling greens just lies fallow through the summer.
Chris (PS05X)  [6195] Right.
David (PS107)  [6196] They obviously keep it cut and keep it up to scratch.
Chris (PS05X)  [6197] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6198] But they were willing to let us play on it because
               croquet wouldn't have done any real harm.
               [6199] The money they wanted for us to use it even just a
               weekend was absolutely ridiculous which to me seems in
               opposition to the whole idea of the borough.
Chris (PS05X)  [6200] Quite.
David (PS107)  [6201] The borough's providing spaces for people to enjoy
               themselves.
Chris (PS05X)  [6202] Yes exactly, exactly.
David (PS107)  [6203] But the problem being now of course that I think in line
               with most London boroughs there is club which tennis club which
               has tennis courts on Local Authority land.
               [6204] They actually enter into a lease or tennis agreement with
               the London Borough ...
Chris (PS05X)  [6205] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6206] for a period of five or ten years and lease it off them
               and then have to maintain it.
               [6207] And of course if you want to use somewhere like the
               bowling green for bowls or croquet then you've got to pay the
               going rate.
Chris (PS05X)  [6208] Yes indeed yes.
David (PS107)  [6209] But I did feel that perhaps they could have bent the
               rules a little.
Chris (PS05X)  [6210] Yes and there are different going rates for different
               things as there are with property, aren't there?
David (PS107)  [6211] I would have thought so.
               [6212] But I suppose as a bowling green then you ... but he said
               that we've already cut the [...] ... stick their neck out will
               they?
Chris (PS05X)  [6213] No no no no no.
               [6214] They are far too liable to have it chopped off.
               [6215] Or they think they are.
David (PS107)  [...]
Chris (PS05X)  [6216] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6217] I must admit that I got fed up with pursuing it and I
               think it's like banging your head against a brick wall in the
               end.
Chris (PS05X)  [6218] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6219] Didn't really have the energy to pursue it.
Chris (PS05X)  [6220] Yeah.
               [6221] No I don't blame you.
               [6222] If it did say locate to the Bickley area or something
               like that would you change the name?
David (PS107)  [6223] Probably.
               [6224] If they did locate then I could get quite a good
               membership
Chris (PS05X)  [6225] Yes.
               [6226] Oh yes.
David (PS107)  [6227] ith croquet you know where the croquet players are and
               where they live.
Chris (PS05X)  [6228] Yes.
               [6229] Yes.
David (PS107)  [6230] And even in quite a wide area ... not perhaps the garden
               croquet players you wouldn't know about the people who play in
               the back garden but you know the people who play in tournaments.
               [6231] Or people who belong to other clubs.
Chris (PS05X)  [6232] Yes indeed.
               [6233] Yes ... Yes.
David (PS107)  [6234] It's odd I suppose because I mean I could be much happier
               to play a lot more if there was a subscription towards croquet.
               [6235] It didn't particularly bother me.
Chris (PS05X)  [6236] Aha.
David (PS107)  [6237] I would think one gets a lot out [...] membership [...]
Chris (PS05X)  [6238] Yes yes.

Susan (PS103)   [6244] How [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6245] Are you having second thoughts about having it, dear?
Norrine (PS101) [6246] I'm not so hundred percent certain it's not one of those
                things that I think ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6247] Right.
                [6248] Well I what I think Suzannah and I are both genuinely in
                favour.
Norrine (PS101) [6249] Definitely that's what I want.
Chris (PS05X)   [6250] No.
                [6251] I think Suzannah and I are genuinely in favour.
Susan (PS103)   [6252] What would you wear as an exit?
Norrine (PS101) [6253] Does it need to be a high neck sort of thing?
Chris (PS05X)   [6254] Well not necessarily it could have some loopy beads or
                something couldn't you?
Norrine (PS101) [6255] What colour?
Chris (PS05X)   [6256] Brown blue yellow red.
Norrine (PS101) [6257] Any of those colours [...]

Norrine (PS101) [6261] But I like to wear a little jewellery.
Chris (PS05X)   [6262] Yes and the children like to see it.
                [6263] I mean a little elephant brooch or something.
                [6264] Have you still got that other elephant belt that tan
                one?

                sold on any of it.
Lynda (PS102)   [6269] Oh I'm sorry about that.

Norrine (PS101) [...]
Lynda (PS102)   [6271] That's correct.
Chris (PS05X)   [6272] May I look at that please?
Chris (PS05X)   [6273] With the pads in I feel square on the top.
                [6274] If I could take them out.
Lynda (PS102)   [6275] Just a moment, may I?
                [6276] They don't look harsh.
Chris (PS05X)   [6277] To me they are too wide.
Lynda (PS102)   [6278] Alright to me they don't look harsh.

Norrine (PS101) [6337] How many [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6338] I don't think they've said that.
                [6339] They've given me twenty or twenty four
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6340] twenty tapes.
                [6341] I've done just over fifty percent of them so far.
                [6342] No.
                [6343] I've done about fifty percent I think.
                [6344] I've just put in tape ten so we're nearly half way
                there.
                [6345] There's no obligation to fill all the tapes.

                isn't it?
                [6350] You either turn left to go to one side of Petswood or
                right to go to the other side of Petswood.
                [6351] It's a ... the railway provides quite a split.

Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6353] Mmm.
                [6354] Teenagers probably.

Norrine (PS101) [6356] Nice green [...] view.
Chris (PS05X)   [6357] Good.

Chris (PS05X)   [6367] David is looking for somewhere to put his croquet club.
Norrine (PS101) [6368] What do you mean by that?
Chris (PS05X)   [6369] Well he's got a croquet club without a ground.
Norrine (PS101) [6370] Oh you mean a club?
                [6371] A number of people not a club stick?
                [6372] It's not called like a golf club that you hit the ball
                with?
Chris (PS05X)   [6373] Ah!
                [6374] Correct.
                [6375] He's looking for ground land.
Norrine (PS101) [6376] [...] Not looking much of a hurry
Chris (PS05X)   [6377] What's that thing out there hydrants or something?
Norrine (PS101) [6378] On which to play croquet?
Chris (PS05X)   [6379] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6380] He [...] occasionally he gets by the club.
Norrine (PS101) [6381] Uncomfortable next to the Tigers.
Chris (PS05X)   [6382] [yawn] Excuse me.
Norrine (PS101) [6383] Erm.
                [6384] Yes he was he is the Secretary of Eden Park Croquet Club
                which was an offshoot of Eden Park Cricket Club.
Chris (PS05X)   [6385] Where is Eden Park?
Norrine (PS101) [6386] It's between Beckenham and Croydon.
                [6387] And
Chris (PS05X)   [6388] They don't have anywhere to play?
Norrine (PS101) [6389] at the moment they don't have anywhere to play.
Chris (PS05X)   [6390] What do you need for a croquet club?
Norrine (PS101) [6391] Well you need ideally some space for about four or five
                tennis courts to run
Chris (PS05X)   [6392] Quite a lot
Norrine (PS101) [6393] Well that would run you three lawns ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6394] How big is a lawn?
Norrine (PS101) [6395] which would be ideal.
Chris (PS05X)   [6396] As big as a tennis court?
Norrine (PS101) [6397] I believe it's twenty four by sixteen ideally.
Chris (PS05X)   [6398] Is that bigger than a tennis court?
Norrine (PS101) [6399] It's about the size of a double tennis court apparently.
Chris (PS05X)   [6400] Double tennis court?
Norrine (PS101) [6401] Mhm.
Chris (PS05X)   [6402] Gosh!
Norrine (PS101) [6403] With the surrounds.
Chris (PS05X)   [6404] [...] Presumably you can't use it for anything else
                because it needs to be very smooth and perfect.
                [6405] Is there cold air blowing in this car?
Norrine (PS101) [6406] It's hot air blowing in.
Chris (PS05X)   [6407] I know [...] any air but something's blowing.
                [6408] You can erm ... you can't use it for anything else but
                croquet?
Norrine (PS101) [6409] No.
                [6410] But then it's not a very big area.
                [6411] You know as you can't use a tennis court for anything
                else or bowling green for anything else.
Chris (PS05X)   [6412] No.
                [6413] But it does sound quite a big area to me if you haven't
                got the land in the first place.
                [6414] It would mean somebody's got to give up something.
Norrine (PS101) [6415] You could fit it on a bowling green.
Chris (PS05X)   [6416] But then who wants to give up a bowling green?
Norrine (PS101) [6417] Well I'm talking of space.
                [6418] The area you need.
Chris (PS05X)   [6419] You've got the area.
                [6420] That's fine but you haven't got any land at all.
Norrine (PS101) [6421] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [6422] It's quite a lot of land to find.
Norrine (PS101) [6423] Absolutely true.
Chris (PS05X)   [6424] It's not like somebody's back garden.
Norrine (PS101) [6425] Yep.
Chris (PS05X)   [6426] So where were they playing today?
Norrine (PS101) [6427] They went to Dulwich.
Chris (PS05X)   [6428] Is there a croquet club there?
Norrine (PS101) [6429] Yes.
                [6430] Burbidge Road.
                [6431] Which is where Carlos used to live.
Chris (PS05X)   [6432] How many croquet clubs are there around here?
Norrine (PS101) [6433] Very few.
                [6434] Sydenham is possible.
                [6435] [...] ran an evening class affair.
Chris (PS05X)   [6436] Not one in Bromley?
Norrine (PS101) [6437] No.
                [6438] There's nothing in Bromley.
                [6439] Apparently the Mayor last year or the Mayoress er was
                rather keen and organized a match between the Dulwich Club and
                her team nominally which turned out to be made up of masters
                from Dulwich College [laugh] .
                [6440] Well apparently they have a lawn and they play it.
Chris (PS05X)   [6441] Well yes [...] people who play.
Norrine (PS101) [6442] Oh you need people who know the game anyway.
                [6443] Then
Chris (PS05X)   [6444] Oh no.
                [6445] You need to know how to play.
Norrine (PS101) [6446] Oh indeed you do.
                [6447] Mighty complicated it is too.
Chris (PS05X)   [6448] Well I was reading that article in the Sunday Times with
                you and the chap who's the champion said he liked it because
                it's like chess and bridge.
Norrine (PS101) [6449] Mm.
                [6450] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [6451] A game of strategy.
Norrine (PS101) [6452] Or I mean David was saying you can do this you can do
                that you can do the other you can do this.
                [6453] I I my mind was absolutely blown by the end.
                [6454] It it was almost impossible to erm ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6455] If you were ...
Norrine (PS101) [6456] latch on to everything.
Chris (PS05X)   [6457] starting out out.
                [6458] Doing it from scratch.
                [6459] If somebody was used to teaching croquet they wouldn't
                tell you everything all at once.
                [6460] And you can gradually build up.
Norrine (PS101) [6461] Well he was coaching me and he was very good.
Chris (PS05X)   [6462] Oh good.
Norrine (PS101) [6463] Very good.
                [6464] I can understand why he has been invited to coach.
                [6465] Very good.

                perfectly.
                [6468] Right into the space and I was pleased with myself.

Lynda (PS102)   [6492] This one, or this one I think this one is nice.

Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6505] Yes I'm sure they were Singapore noodles.
Norrine (PS101) [6506] We'll have noodles not rice certainly.
                [6507] Where are these stuffed mushrooms?
                [6508] I can't see them.
Chris (PS05X)   [6509] Can't remember what they were stuffed with can you?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6510] And bean bean sprouts [...] we had too.
Norrine (PS101) [6511] [...] and stuffed mushrooms [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6512] Oh yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6513] Don't let's have bean sprouts.
Chris (PS05X)   [6514] Alright we won't have bean sprouts.
                [6515] How about we have Chinese mushrooms with bamboo shoots?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6516] Seasonal Chinese vegetable with prawns.
                [6517] How about that?
Norrine (PS101) [6518] [...] prawns with stuffed mushrooms.
                [6519] Would you like something first?
Chris (PS05X)   [6520] Not first but what will ... you'll have a lager?
Norrine (PS101) [6521] I'll have a lager.
Chris (PS05X)   [6522] May we have two lagers please?
                [6523] So we shall have lemon chicken, stuffed mushrooms, we
                had something else didn't we last time?
Norrine (PS101) [6524] We may have had bean sprouts with noodles.
Chris (PS05X)   [6525] We had bean sprouts last time yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6526] Yes but I don't like bean sprouts.
Chris (PS05X)   [6527] Right.
                [6528] But you enjoyed the noodles.
Norrine (PS101) [6529] Yes. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6530] But there was something else that we had.
Norrine (PS101) [6531] What we had something more than just the bean sprouts?
Chris (PS05X)   [6532] We had we certainly had lemon chicken stuffed mushrooms,
Norrine (PS101) [6533] And noodles.
Chris (PS05X)   [6534] and noodles.
Norrine (PS101) [6535] We had something like bean sprouts last time ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6536] Yes I think we did but we also had something else.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6537] Yes we did.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6538] What would you like to have start with?
Norrine (PS101) [6539] What do you want?
Chris (PS05X)   [6540] Wan Ton soup.
Norrine (PS101) [6541] What with vegetables, I suppose. [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6542] Oh we won't have either of them then.
                [6543] Have some Wan Ton soup [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [6544] What is Wan Ton soup?
Chris (PS05X)   [6545] All sorts of bits in it.
Norrine (PS101) [6546] What do you mean by that?
Chris (PS05X)   [6547] Or do you fancy [...] I can't remember.
                [6548] It's a long long time since I had it.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6549] We'd have mixed appetites [...] if you'd given it any
                thought.
                [6550] How about having ...
Norrine (PS101) [6551] Are we thinking about how romantic [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6552] Or why not a Dim Sum?
                [6553] Which is a classic Chinese.
Norrine (PS101) [6554] But we've never had that here.
Chris (PS05X)   [6555] You had that let's start with Dim Sum.
                [6556] Now over here we are short of one
Norrine (PS101) [6557] Or have some vegetables.
Chris (PS05X)   [6558] Alright.
                [6559] Alright.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6560] No.
*** 198 (Tape 002906) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [6561] I was thinking of the seasons Chinese vegetables were
                born.
Norrine (PS101) [6562] They were not born in the mushrooms. [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6563] Mushrooms [...] right.
Norrine (PS101) [6564] Right.
                [6565] We weren't going to put mushrooms with prawns.
Chris (PS05X)   [6566] Yes we are.
                [6567] I think we are.
                [6568] We'll both have Dim Sum, lemon chicken erm Chinese
                vegetables with prawns.
                [6569] Stuffed mushrooms.
                [6570] And some noodles.
Lynda (PS102)   [6571] Special noodles?
Chris (PS05X)   [6572] Singapore noodles.
                [6573] What is the difference between Singapore noodles and
                special noodles?
Lynda (PS102)   [6574] Singapore noodles have hot spices.
                [6575] But the others ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6576] Is not?
                [6577] Special noodles are not so spicy?
Lynda (PS102)   [6578] No.
Chris (PS05X)   [6579] We'll have special noodles.
*** 199 (Tape 002907) ***
Norrine (PS101) [6580] I see this restaurant allows smoking.
Chris (PS05X)   [6581] What sorry?
Norrine (PS101) [6582] This restaurant allows smoking.
Chris (PS05X)   [6583] Restaurants local restaurants can't afford not to dear.
                [6584] I think if you're talking about a very exclusive one up
                in town they might well say no smoking.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6585] Oh we have to share a finger bowl.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6586] [...] isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
*** 200 (Tape 002908) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [6587] Golly it'd be interesting to know what they'd make of
                this tape for the next couple of hours.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6588] Yes indeed.
Norrine (PS101) [6589] Was it at work [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6590] Where it works?
Norrine (PS101) [6591] David find it [...] being there?
Chris (PS05X)   [6592] No.
                [6593] No he said he forgot about it quite quickly.
Norrine (PS101) [6594] Are you going to play it back or listen to it?
Chris (PS05X)   [6595] I beg your pardon?
Norrine (PS101) [6596] Are you going to play it back or listen to it?
Chris (PS05X)   [6597] Which one?
Norrine (PS101) [6598] The tapes.
Chris (PS05X)   [6599] All of them?
                [6600] I haven't got a player for two full days in which to do
                it.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6601] No.
                [6602] [...] ... I must tape number ten no it takes an hour and
                a half on tape number ten.
                [6603] That's fifteen hours.
Norrine (PS101) [6604] Play it at work.
Chris (PS05X)   [6605] Well you can if you'd like to but I'm not going to.
Norrine (PS101) [6606] I remember [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6607] Thank you.
                [6608] May we have the bill?
*** 201 (Tape 002909) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [6609] They're busy little bees in here [...]
Norrine (PS101) [6610] The restaurant's nice.
Chris (PS05X)   [6611] It is indeed.
                [6612] When you've had a day in the open air you have a sort of
Norrine (PS101) [6613] Glow.
Chris (PS05X)   [6614] glow. [...] ...
Norrine (PS101) [6615] [...] it really was chilly by the time I [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6616] Well I mean you can relax on that score because you had
                a very good half hour run with me.
                [6617] She wasn't in frantic form but she was zipping hither
                and dither.
Norrine (PS101) [6618] She insisted on coming
Chris (PS05X)   [6619] Galloped around the outside.
                [6620] I was absolutely steaming by the time I got back to the
                car.
Norrine (PS101) [6621] It was very hot.
                [6622] And the very erm [...] she was very anxious to come with
                me when I went out into the park.
                [6623] To get me into the car so I let her come.
Chris (PS05X)   [6624] Good.
                [6625] To get the what?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6626] Oh yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6627] And she had to come in the car while I [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6628] There's a take away here.
                [6629] [...] a bag for somebody.
Norrine (PS101) [6630] A doggy bag.
Chris (PS05X)   [6631] No.
                [6632] A great big carrier bag you can't see it it's just
                outside.
Norrine (PS101) [6633] It all seems rather a shame really you know to do a take
                away [...] .
                [6634] I mean that rather a nice Chinese restaurant in the high
                street does take away.
Chris (PS05X)   [6635] We had one last week.
Norrine (PS101) [6636] [...] but if you're going to pay a lot of money for your
                take away
Chris (PS05X)   [6637] I wonder if they charge the same prices for their take
                away as for sitting at the table.
Norrine (PS101) [6638] I think they really must.
                [6639] My mother
Chris (PS05X)   [6640] I know I know in the past I have er [...] ten percent or
                something.
                [6641] But I may be going back far too long for the evening.
Norrine (PS101) [6642] Well you'd think they could because you are not paying
                for the service are you?
Chris (PS05X)   [6643] That's right.
                [6644] Yes I think I could become really absorbed in croquet.
                [6645] I don't know if I'd become good at it but I think
Norrine (PS101) [6646] Why not?
Chris (PS05X)   [6647] but I think it'd be a game that one could become
                absorbed in.
                [6648] It's not physically demanding other than in stamina
                concentration terms.
                [6649] It's hardly physically demanding is it?
                [6650] And the course that David went on before he was asked to
                coach on it was for advanced people anyway [...] .
                [6651] And he said ah er I misunderstood this and er and I said
                well you know when is it?
                [6652] Who knows may be I could baah aah aah.
                [6653] And he said, er er.
                [6654] Just possible that you [...] standard because he
                obviously seemed to think that I was that I had some great
                possible qualities but
Norrine (PS101) [6655] But?
Chris (PS05X)   [6656] Well I would I, he would say you know you know you don't
                croquet that and it's a short bom bom and it's
Norrine (PS101) [6657] It's the first time you've done it.
Chris (PS05X)   [6658] Oh! [...] what does he mean by that?
                [6659] And so on and so forth.
Norrine (PS101) [6660] But he must be quite good unusual to start by playing a
                whole game?
Chris (PS05X)   [6661] Well I mean he showed me how er er he showed me how the
                mallet is operated.
                [6662] There's no standard grip you
Lynda (PS102)   [6663] Alright?
Norrine (PS101) [6664] I have mine.
Lynda (PS102)   [6665] Thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [6666] I notice that you do takeaways here?
Lynda (PS102)   [6667] Yes we do.
Chris (PS05X)   [6668] Do you charge the same prices as in the restaurant?
Lynda (PS102)   [6669] Oh no.
                [6670] It's cheaper than the restaurant.
                [6671] Yes yes
Chris (PS05X)   [6672] Ah!
                [6673] I'm I'm pleased to hear that.
                [6674] That's interesting we were
Lynda (PS102)   [6675] One moment.
                [6676] I give you our menu you know.
Chris (PS05X)   [6677] Yes thank you.
                [6678] I would be interested.
Lynda (PS102)   [6679] [...] except V A T.
Chris (PS05X)   [6680] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [6681] You can charge more [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6682] Well they're not receiving [gasp] excuse me the service
                and the pleasure of the table and the atmosphere.
Lynda (PS102)   [6683] You see when you want to get home I charge more.
                [6684] The people why they want here they can have cheaper
                right here.
Chris (PS05X)   [6685] Yes.
                [6686] Yes.
                [6687] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [6688] I give you one menu, okay?
Chris (PS05X)   [6689] Thank you.
                [6690] [laugh] And it always smells good here doesn't it?
                [6691] It always smells super.
                [6692] [cough] Who is the tall thin chap sitting next to Diane?
Norrine (PS101) [6693] I don't know darling.
                [6694] Probably their family or something [...] I don't know.
Norrine (PS101) [6695] Do you remember being here with [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [6696] Yes I do.
                [6697] We sat there.
Norrine (PS101) [6698] Ham and Eve
Chris (PS05X)   [6699] Ham and Eve!
                [6700] [...] And they enjoyed it didn't they?
Norrine (PS101) [6701] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [6702] Unfortunately you chose the ginger beetle, the toffee
                beetle or something of the sort it had a gingery look to it.
Norrine (PS101) [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6703] Oh is that what it's called?
                [6704] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6705] It was very feathery.
                [6706] Not gingery feathery.
                [6707] Did you notice in the front of the back [...] so you
                must remember to take back.
                [6708] Somebody has started a boat on the river.
                [6709] The article on the front page.
Chris (PS05X)   [6710] I haven't seen it no.
Norrine (PS101) [6711] The cook from the Spread Eagle.
Chris (PS05X)   [6712] Oh yeah.
Norrine (PS101) [6713] Chef who is no longer there?
Chris (PS05X)   [6714] Chefette yes?
Norrine (PS101) [6715] He has acquired a boat.
                [6716] [...] or somewhere.
Chris (PS05X)   [6717] Yes.
                [6718] Yes.
                [6719] Yes.
                [6720] Which he uses for parties rather than as a restaurant.
Norrine (PS101) [6721] And you can hire it out.
Chris (PS05X)   [6722] Somebody had a super birthday party for their husband.
Norrine (PS101) [6723] [...] And the cheapest menu was thirteen pounds.
Chris (PS05X)   [6724] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6725] Based on O'Hagen sausage.
Chris (PS05X)   [6726] Yes.
                [6727] Yes.
                [6728] Yes I thought that was rather good.
Norrine (PS101) [6729] Sounded rather fun.
Chris (PS05X)   [6730] Yes it did.
Norrine (PS101) [6731] Quite pricey actually
Chris (PS05X)   [6732] Yes well it was pricey.
                [6733] But then you're paying for the use of the boat as well
                aren't you?
Norrine (PS101) [6734] Yes but then when I came here with you.
                [6735] The meal was thirteen pounds ten
Chris (PS05X)   [6736] Right.
Norrine (PS101) [6737] plus the wine.
Chris (PS05X)   [6738] But that was, a year ago two years ago.
Norrine (PS101) [6739] A year and half ago anyway.
                [6740] Nearly two years ago.
                [6741] Erm she said [...] six months ahead.
Chris (PS05X)   [6742] Oh really?
Norrine (PS101) [6743] She said when you came and I rang to confirm it all she
                said you're very lucky because he agreed thirteen pounds and we
                don't do it for under fifteen pounds now.
Chris (PS05X)   [6744] Really?
Norrine (PS101) [6745] And I said oh dear!
                [6746] I hope you're not going to be feeling mean about it you
                know because
Chris (PS05X)   [6747] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6748] because they weren't, were they?
Chris (PS05X)   [6749] No.
                [6750] No.
                [6751] No they were not.
                [6752] They were not they were honest.
                [6753] They were honest and straightforward and jolly good
                stuff.
Norrine (PS101) [6754] It was really thanks to Linda and Graham because I never
                would have done it otherwise.
Chris (PS05X)   [6755] No.

                had been before have any other common
Chris (PS05X)   [6758] Quite probably.

Chris (PS05X)   [6760] Is that our Dim Sum.

Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [6766] Little dumplings.
Chris (PS05X)   [6767] Little dumplings such as you've never come across other
                than in a Chinese Restaurant.

Chris (PS05X)   [6768] Her birthday's the fourteenth.
                [6769] Do you know which day of the week that is?
Norrine (PS101) [6770] I know the first is a Monday.
Chris (PS05X)   [6771] So the fifteenth will be a Monday.
                [6772] So the fourteenth will be a Sunday.
Norrine (PS101) [6773] How long have you been working on that?
Chris (PS05X)   [6774] Saturday.
                [6775] She finishes in August did you say?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6776] Right.

Chris (PS05X)   [6787] My birthday's on Monday obviously at this rate.

Chris (PS05X)   [6790] Wednesday.
Norrine (PS101) [6791] Wednesday.

                expect.
Chris (PS05X)   [6793] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6794] But I could just about fit in going.
                [6795] I mean I should be finished in time for that weekend.
Chris (PS05X)   [6796] Yes good.

                then.
Chris (PS05X)   [6800] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [6801] Only if she gets her [...] thing and finishes.
                [6802] That Monday will be okay.
                [6803] For presentations
Chris (PS05X)   [6804] That's the Monday before you finish?
                [6805] Will you be under huge pressures or will you be winding
                down a bit by then?
Norrine (PS101) [6806] Well hopefully I'll be winding down.
Chris (PS05X)   [6807] You'll probably be rehearsing a part for a silly end of
                year staff entertainment or something.
Norrine (PS101) [6808] I haven't heard anything about that.
                [6809] I don't think we do that in the summer term.
Chris (PS05X)   [6810] Oh really.
*** 205 (Tape 002913) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [6811] That's what you had in mind wasn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [6812] No that's what you suggested.
Chris (PS05X)   [6813] Or what had you in mind?
Norrine (PS101) [6814] Nothing [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6815] No.
Norrine (PS101) [6816] Certainly don't want your pretty rotten [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6817] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6818] Sure.
Norrine (PS101) [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6819] Mm.
                [6820] Can you smell that?
                [6821] Whatever it is.
                [6822] Wonderful!
Norrine (PS101) [6823] Slightly slightly burned.
Chris (PS05X)   [6824] Yes but caramelly burned, isn't it?
                [6825] Quality burned.
                [6826] Do you think Christine and Colin would enjoy a meal
                here?
Norrine (PS101) [6827] Sure.
Chris (PS05X)   [6828] [...] stuffed mushrooms.
Norrine (PS101) [6829] Lovely.
                [6830] Thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [6831] Splendid.
Norrine (PS101) [6832] It's probably what smelled.
Chris (PS05X)   [6833] Sizzling and sizzling.
                [6834] Yes.
                [6835] Wonderful.
Norrine (PS101) [6836] When he comes from erm ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6837] Yes?
Norrine (PS101) [6838] I'd like a glass of water.
Chris (PS05X)   [6839] Good.
Norrine (PS101) [6840] There's no hurry.
Chris (PS05X)   [6841] Madam!
                [6842] Madam!
                [6843] May we have two glasses of water please?
                [6844] Thank you.
Norrine (PS101) [6845] Thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [6846] Is that the mixed vegetables and stuff?
Lynda (PS102)   [6847] [...] special noodles or Chinese vegetables.
Norrine (PS101) [6848] No we had mushrooms and noodles.
                [6849] Didn't we ask for mushrooms and noodles before?
Chris (PS05X)   [6850] Can't remember.
                [6851] Doesn't look like that to me.
                [6852] [...] dreadful.
Norrine (PS101) [6853] Well we didn't ask for that.
                [6854] [...] mushrooms and [...] .
                [6855] Oh no you said mixed Chinese vegetables in beef I don't
                know
Chris (PS05X)   [6856] Oh I'm sorry I've got beef.
Norrine (PS101) [6857] anyway.
Chris (PS05X)   [6858] Tell me what we've got here will you?
Lynda (PS102)   [6859] Okay yes sir.
                [6860] Stuffed mushrooms.
Chris (PS05X)   [6861] Yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [6862] Special noodles.
Norrine (PS101) [6863] Ah!
Lynda (PS102)   [6864] Special noodles.
Norrine (PS101) [6865] Special noodles.
                [6866] Yes

Norrine (PS101) [6868] Lovely!
                [6869] Thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [6870] Thank you.
Norrine (PS101) [6871] We didn't recognise that.
                [6872] It's very special.
                [6873] Very special.
Lynda (PS102)   [6874] [...] It not [...] noodles [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [6875] Thank you very much.
Chris (PS05X)   [6876] Thank you.
                [6877] Right.
                [6878] Careful the spoons on the plates are hot.
                [6879] More sauce?
Norrine (PS101) [6880] Very special.
                [6881] Prawns in it and all sorts.
Chris (PS05X)   [6882] I don't think it is the same ones we had the last time.
                [6883] I think we probably did have Singapore noodles last
                time.
                [6884] Super!
                [6885] Thank you.
Norrine (PS101) [6886] [...] your noodles.
Chris (PS05X)   [6887] I think for the moment I'll just enjoy these two dishes
                if that's okay.
                [6888] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [6889] I'm glad you don't use chopsticks either.
Chris (PS05X)   [6890] I don't suppose we'll need to, fiddle around dear.
Norrine (PS101) [6891] So difficult to pick up.
Chris (PS05X)   [6892] Mm.
                [6893] Absolutely.
                [6894] We got here in the nick of time or we would have had the
                rotten table otherwise.
Norrine (PS101) [6895] Mm.
                [6896] It's a bit nearer nine now.
Chris (PS05X)   [6897] Mm.
                [6898] Where did those prawns come from?
                [6899] From that dish or from that dish?
                [6900] The noodle dish.
                [6901] Well.
                [6902] Well.
Norrine (PS101) [6903] Special noodles have everything.
Chris (PS05X)   [6904] Yes lovely.
Norrine (PS101) [6905] You didn't get in any of vegetables.
Chris (PS05X)   [6906] No.
                [6907] Well they're very similar looking dishes aren't they?
                [6908] Lovely crunchy vegetables aren't they?
                [6909] Super.
Lynda (PS102)   [6910] Alright?
Norrine (PS101) [6911] Lovely.
                [6912] Thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [6913] Thank you very much.
Norrine (PS101) [6914] Did you ever hear what the Palmer children girls had for
                for their twenty first birthday celebration?
Chris (PS05X)   [6915] Were they not the ones who had the fancy dress party the
                Victorian dress party at the [...] hotel?
Norrine (PS101) [6916] It wasn't Victorian is was the twentieth
Chris (PS05X)   [6917] Right.
                [6918] Am I right though?
Norrine (PS101) [6919] Yes.
                [6920] That's right.
                [6921] I thought that was a lovely idea.
Chris (PS05X)   [6922] Yes.
                [6923] Absolutely super.
                [6924] I'm awfully sorry we weren't involved.
Norrine (PS101) [6925] We don't really know them well enough do we?
Chris (PS05X)   [6926] That's right. [...]
Norrine (PS101) [6927] I can't say
Chris (PS05X)   [6928] Towering temples and things.
                [6929] Look at the beast they've got over there on that table.
                [6930] Do you see him?
                [6931] With his ears?
Norrine (PS101) [6932] Such a [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6933] Or something like that.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6934] No I don't think so.
                [6935] I think it's a dish you choose.
*** 206 (Tape 002914) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [6936] Where's Snoopy getting the money from to go to the
                Tiger's Head tonight?
Norrine (PS101) [6937] [...] credit cards in use.
                [6938] She can go where she likes.
                [6939] I only gave her fifteen.
                [6940] So I said I was tired of waiting for the money for my
                things and she can collect it from the students and have it
                when it came.
Chris (PS05X)   [6941] Well done.
                [6942] That was a fiver was it?
Norrine (PS101) [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6943] Yes.
                [6944] Presumably they've all got their films.
                [6945] So they should jolly well be stumping up.
Norrine (PS101) [6946] If she's not bothered to collect them
Chris (PS05X)   [6947] Yep yep suffer.
                [6948] Yep.
*** 207 (Tape 002915) ***
Norrine (PS101) [6949] No no don't push any more on me!
Chris (PS05X)   [6950] Sorry.
Norrine (PS101) [6951] Thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [6952] Hang on hang on.
Norrine (PS101) [6953] It's alright.
                [6954] Move it up to the edge of your tray.
Chris (PS05X)   [6955] Oh bad luck.
Norrine (PS101) [6956] Do you want some more chicken?
Chris (PS05X)   [6957] Thank you.
                [6958] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6959] I was holding it in such an awkward way that fingers
                eventually protested.
*** 208 (Tape 002916) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [6960] What did you get to put in the middle of the erm lobelia
                in that other pot?
Norrine (PS101) [6961] Erm geraniums and er petunias, busy lizzy.
Lynda (PS102)   [6962] Okay?
Chris (PS05X)   [6963] Ya.
                [6964] Where did you get them in the end?
Norrine (PS101) [6965] All different places.
Chris (PS05X)   [6966] Oh right.
                [6967] Were they better value than previously or ...
Norrine (PS101) [6968] Well ...
Chris (PS05X)   [6969] similar or what?
Norrine (PS101) [6970] Thomsons' geraniums on the whole were very good value.
                [6971] One twenty five [...] one ninety.
Chris (PS05X)   [6972] Goodness!
                [6973] Extraordinary!
Norrine (PS101) [6974] There were some cheaper geraniums around but they were
                the trailing kind.
                [6975] To have in hanging baskets.
*** 209 (Tape 002917) ***

Chris (PS05X)   [6979] Oddly I would have thought. [...] ...
Norrine (PS101) [6980] It's false.
Chris (PS05X)   [6981] Really?
Norrine (PS101) [6982] [...] quickly.

                [6986] Well.
                [6987] Interesting idea.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [6988] One side said yes the other side says no.
                [6989] Ha?
Norrine (PS101) [6990] That's what they said.
                [6991] Yeah.
*** 210 (Tape 002918) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [6992] I heard somewhere that John's living in [...] now.
                [6993] He is a long way away.
Norrine (PS101) [6994] Who told you that?
Chris (PS05X)   [6995] I've no idea.
                [6996] Absolutely no idea.
                [6997] But he was a sailing man.
Norrine (PS101) [6998] I always might have known that.
Chris (PS05X)   [6999] [...] Christine?
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7000] I've no idea.
Norrine (PS101) [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [7001] Probably not.
                [7002] Probably not.
Norrine (PS101) [7003] You did say in her that you heard from Sally I didn't
                get my usual Christmas letter.
                [7004] I told her Sally hadn't [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [7005] Good.
                [7006] Really there's nothing to stop me from giving Sally a
                ring is there this week end?
Norrine (PS101) [7007] Hopefully it's not terribly expensive.
*** 211 (Tape 002920) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [7015] Do you think the world will ever get get the balance
                right feeding the starving?
Norrine (PS101) [7016] No never.
                [7017] One apple and one banana, toffee apple if you've got no
                banana.
                [7018] One of each please
Lynda (PS102)   [7019] Yes.
                [7020] Yes.
                [7021] You want coffee afterwards?
Norrine (PS101) [7022] Yes please.
Lynda (PS102)   [7023] Two coffees
Norrine (PS101) [7024] Strange little creature.
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [7025] Well it's always been an awful lot worse than it is now.
Chris (PS05X)   [7026] Why is it [...]
Norrine (PS101) [7027] No it is communication that tells us that it is so awful
                now.
                [7028] I don't think it's any worse now, it's just that we've
                written no about it.
Chris (PS05X)   [7029] Well, I don't know if that's true or not.
Norrine (PS101) [7030] But it's nonsense flying in food to Ethiopia Bangladesh
                and all the rest of it
Chris (PS05X)   [7031] Isn't it better to do nothing?
Norrine (PS101) [7032] Let them die.
Chris (PS05X)   [7033] Why why is that better?
Norrine (PS101) [7034] Because that is the way of the world, they're living in
                very very marginal areas that do not sustain life.
                [7035] You will never ever stop sending food to areas like
                that.
                [7036] They're areas that people should not be living.
Chris (PS05X)   [7037] Is that a bad thing?
                [7038] I mean if if presumably people go on being born there
                surely we should leave them.
                [7039] It doesn't really matter to human beings [...] as long
                as they have [...] nourishment.
                [7040] If you worked in this country and for some reason and
                were starving you wouldn't care if they fed you.
Norrine (PS101) [7041] The individual of course wants feeding needs feeding but
                should all resources of this area that area be rife to that
                particular point, every two to three years?
Chris (PS05X)   [7042] Well why should they not?
Norrine (PS101) [7043] Because that's what happened to Bangladesh.
Chris (PS05X)   [7044] Why should they not?
Norrine (PS101) [7045] Because they don't have any genuine effect.
                [7046] It happens over and over and over again.
                [7047] Nobody ever learns anything
Chris (PS05X)   [7048] Maybe we should be [...] when your budget [...] for all
                nations have plenty of food and plenty of resources should
                automatically make this sort of money and food available to
                nations without it.
                [7049] Maybe that's the answer.
Norrine (PS101) [7050] Maybe it is.
Chris (PS05X)   [7051] Maybe it should be an emergency aid [...] ... those that
                have given and those that have not.
                [7052] I mean if that's the only way that people were kept in
                reasonable health.
                [7053] [...] the money comes from [...] ...
Norrine (PS101) [7054] I don't think we are talking about kept in reasonable
                health dear I think it is a question of living in an
                environment which does not genuinely support over any sensible
                period of time normal human life.
Lynda (PS102)   [7055] Have you order?
Norrine (PS101) [7056] We have thank you yes.
Lynda (PS102)   [7057] Have you order coffee as well?
Norrine (PS101) [7058] As well.
Lynda (PS102)   [7059] Yes.
                [7060] You like coffee now or later?
Norrine (PS101) [7061] Later please.
Lynda (PS102)   [7062] You want coffee now?
Norrine (PS101) [7063] No later later.
Chris (PS05X)   [7064] Yes they've always been like that and they always will
                be like that.
                [7065] They're the same, let them die.
                [7066] That's not normal.
                [7067] Because there'll just be more people.
                [7068] Otherwise they would have died out long ago.
Norrine (PS101) [7069] Well I mean may be there's there's there's an argument
                on teaching contraception measures.
Chris (PS05X)   [7070] I'm sure there is as well.
                [7071] That never the full answer because pushing people into
                that [...] is one thing they should have.
Norrine (PS101) [7072] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [7073] I mean six to one is you know that. [...] ...
Norrine (PS101) [7074] Sure.
Chris (PS05X)   [7075] People with no money and no home always seem to end up
                having children.
                [7076] Whereas if you and I didn't have a roof over our head
Norrine (PS101) [7077] Mm
Chris (PS05X)   [7078] I mean the last thing we'd think about is excluding
                children.
Norrine (PS101) [7079] But they do.
                [7080] Yes.
                [7081] How right you are.
Chris (PS05X)   [7082] It would be a good idea if you do teach them the ways of
                contraception available it's never going to stop people having
                babies.
                [7083] I mean in China they [...] families [...] and what have
                they got?
                [7084] They've not denied the situation at all have they?
Norrine (PS101) [7085] No.
                [7086] No.
Chris (PS05X)   [7087] Or families where they kill a child
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7088] for being the wrong sex.
Norrine (PS101) [7089] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [7090] Only children growing up in the lap of luxury [...] ...
Norrine (PS101) [7091] Yes.
Chris (PS05X)   [7092] And mothers are supposed to sink all their hopes
                ambitions [...] in the one child.
                [7093] Watching their education.
Norrine (PS101) [7094] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [7095] Strange thing they'll have two and three.
Norrine (PS101) [7096] They're a nation of super brats.
Chris (PS05X)   [7097] Whereas mothers at home aren't their usual selves
                because they've their children to look after.
                [7098] I mean [...] but interesting but not the ideal answer.
*** 212 (Tape 002921) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [7099] Does that mean that Anna has actually slept in that
                [...] too?
Norrine (PS101) [7100] She had a good long night with no disturbance.
Chris (PS05X)   [7101] Good.
                [7102] I noticed on your card she called him Daniel David and
                then behold he's going to be just Daniel.
Norrine (PS101) [7103] Well David is his second name.
Chris (PS05X)   [7104] I know
Norrine (PS101) [7105] [...] what his second name was.
Chris (PS05X)   [7106] Oh really.
Norrine (PS101) [7107] Lena is Lena Rachael.
Chris (PS05X)   [7108] Ha?
                [7109] Real Toffee isn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [7110] Mm. [...]

                [7112] Hot stuff.
Norrine (PS101) [7113] Presumably they're awfully [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7114] Yes.
                [7115] Hubbling bubbling oil.
Norrine (PS101) [7116] Whenever we come here we see somebody we know don't we?
Chris (PS05X)   [7117] Do we?
Norrine (PS101) [7118] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [7119] Who did we see the last time we were here?
Norrine (PS101) [7120] We saw Gill ?
Chris (PS05X)   [7121] Did we?
                [7122] Who's she?
Norrine (PS101) [7123] She used to live in [...] Close.
                [7124] Their younger daughter was the same age as Suzannah and
                went to [...] and went to the same national school.
Chris (PS05X)   [7125] Oh really?
Norrine (PS101) [7126] Their elder daughter was in my guides.
                [7127] They went to Bromley High.
                [7128] Catherine was actually a year lower than Suzannah.
                [7129] They moved into Petts Wood into Birchwood Avenue.
                [7130] Then her husband left her.
Chris (PS05X)   [7131] Oh gosh!
Norrine (PS101) [7132] They were divorced.
                [7133] We saw her here.
                [7134] [...] is still working in Sainsbury's.
Chris (PS05X)   [7135] Does she?
Norrine (PS101) [7136] Saturday job.
                [7137] She works in the bakery.
Chris (PS05X)   [7138] Oh.
                [7139] As opposed to an accountant.
                [7140] Where did she do her study or work or whatever?
Norrine (PS101) [7141] I think she did it in Orpington Tech.
Norrine (PS101) [7142] Aha.
                [7143] I bet Lynda's in for a lark for the next year.
                [7144] She's [...] round the corner when Raymond [...] .
                [7145] And then she'll come home some days and discover the
                place chockablock with students or three birds in bed with him
                or something.
Norrine (PS101) [7146] That's unlikely.
                [7147] I agree they are [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [7148] Sorry?
Norrine (PS101) [7149] [...] school again already.
*** 214 (Tape 002923) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [7150] Erm
Norrine (PS101) [7151] Why did you go on a choir outing?
Chris (PS05X)   [7152] There are caves which seem to ... We went into the
                caverns and erm saw the petrified caves where they, the water
                drip on objects and however many years they build up a stone
                coating.
Norrine (PS101) [7153] Do they have stalagmites?
Chris (PS05X)   [7154] And stalactites.
                [7155] What are they called where they meet in the middle?
                [7156] Columns I suppose or pillars.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7157] Don't know.
*** 215 (Tape 002924) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [7158] I'd be intrigued to know what those other two couples
                who were not informed about the cancelled christening feels.
Norrine (PS101) [7159] Yes [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7160] Or not unless they join in wholeheartedly with the other
                lot.
Norrine (PS101) [7161] Perhaps they turned up outside, looked in and saw nobody
                they knew and went away again.
                [7162] I can ask Mary when I see [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7163] Mhm.
                [7164] Has it been said that they hope to repeat the experience
                or ... ?
Norrine (PS101) [7165] I think they're more concerned that the baby has an
                operation now.
Chris (PS05X)   [7166] What what is the situation there?
Norrine (PS101) [7167] Some time in June.
                [7168] I expect they are waiting to called.
Lynda (PS102)   [7169] You like some more coffee?
Chris (PS05X)   [7170] Yes please.

Norrine (PS101) [7171] The young lady is talking as if she's a member of the

Norrine (PS101) [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [7174] Oh really?
Norrine (PS101) [7175] Because he looks so like [...] .

Chris (PS05X)   [7177] Is she John's daughter or the other guy's?
Norrine (PS101) [7178] I don't know for sure really.
                [7179] I think he must be because of sounds like it.
Chris (PS05X)   [7180] The mother the blond or the midway?
Norrine (PS101) [7181] I only saw Robin [...] ...

Chris (PS05X)   [7185] Sorry?
Norrine (PS101) [7186] It's fine.

                [7188] Ella's about to do work experience.
                [7189] Residential primary school [...] ...
Chris (PS05X)   [7190] Sounds if the girl plans to become a teacher.
Norrine (PS101) [7191] [...] work experience [...] if you remember.
Chris (PS05X)   [7192] Didn't know what hit him did he?
Norrine (PS101) [7193] No I don't think he's planning to become a teacher.
Chris (PS05X)   [7194] He certainly had himself a good varied he and his pal a
                good varied work experience, didn't he?
Norrine (PS101) [7195] What in our school?
Chris (PS05X)   [7196] Mhm.
                [7197] [...] and tennis coaching and don't know what else he
                did do.

                ... [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7212] Well you did speak to her again and make the suggestion.

Norrine (PS101) [7215] Yes please ... [...] I think I will ask her ... or
                suggest we meet or something.
Chris (PS05X)   [7216] Yeah, by all means ... by all means.
Norrine (PS101) [7217] [...] I just wonder if ... she and Cathy might like to

Norrine (PS101) [7219] Yes , she so do you think Cathy would mind if I rang her
                ... and I said no I'm sure she wouldn't.

                like it because I'm sure she won't mind ... well it would be
                nice for us to find out who's been through the same thing

Chris (PS05X)   [7221] Mm.

Chris (PS05X)   [7225] Oh they were ho hoarded.
Norrine (PS101) [7226] Were they?
Chris (PS05X)   [7227] She had them in a big glass jar and if you were very
                good [...] and special occasions.
Norrine (PS101) [7228] Good.
Chris (PS05X)   [7229] Only hers were ... all colours.

                soup.

Norrine (PS101) [7233] It's got dumplings in it.

Norrine (PS101) [7237] Ah.

Chris (PS05X)   [7239] Well as it's used in other muckier places I tend not to
                use it over cleaning table white cloths ... aah
Norrine (PS101) [7240] I'm very well fed.
Chris (PS05X)   [7241] I'm very well fed too, I think I shall ask them for the

Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7242] Yes I did.
                [7243] [...] to clobber in Black Heath village ... I notice it
                didn't say that the premises are now called the age centre.
Norrine (PS101) [7244] No ... today you see a lot of people wearing large
                earrings don't you?
Chris (PS05X)   [7245] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [7246] Is that why you wear such small ones?
Chris (PS05X)   [7247] As so claims ... that was a rather naff comment
                actually, I can't imagine that, well I can imagine other people
                wearing big earrings because they're super confident.
Norrine (PS101) [7248] Then you obviously had a ... you did say [...] ... such
                a lot of [...] in the Radio Times somewhere I was reading today
                about er colours you wear.
Chris (PS05X)   [7249] Oh yes.
Norrine (PS101) [7250] And how people who wear red ... go in in business
                situations go in to assert power ... you know I mean
Chris (PS05X)   [7251] You do mean women in red suits presumably not men in red
                ties!
Norrine (PS101) [7252] No, men in red ties as well.
Chris (PS05X)   [7253] Oh really?
Norrine (PS101) [7254] Yes ... When I put on red one day, I mean I don't think
                I have anything in red do I, but when I put on my clothes in
                the morning
Lynda (PS102)   [7255] Would you like some more coffee?
Chris (PS05X)   [7256] No thank yo would you like some more coffee?
Norrine (PS101) [7257] No thank you.
Chris (PS05X)   [7258] Could we have the bill please?
Lynda (PS102)   [7259] Yes.
Norrine (PS101) [7260] Erm ... I'm influenced by all kinds of things ... but
                I'm sure I'm not influenced by wishing for certain power or
                not.
Chris (PS05X)   [7261] You don't need to.
Norrine (PS101) [7262] No, but I mean there are other such reasons ... I mean
                there may be [...] initially choosing clothes or something like
                that, but when I put them on in the morning ... I usually put
                them on to suit the weather ... and what's clean and what I've
                got tights to match.
Chris (PS05X)   [7263] Yes. [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [7264] Which shoes are comfortable today.

                also practical things like that.

                gathering when we're fifty five of all the people who were at

Norrine (PS101) [7282] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X)   [7283] There would have to be some people w we wouldn't invite
                ... as well as the people who are no longer here.
Norrine (PS101) [7284] Yeah.
Chris (PS05X)   [7285] I mean we'd invite Helen and some friends like, I don't
                know [...] .
Norrine (PS101) [7286] Yes, the old folk.
Chris (PS05X)   [7287] Mrs , Hilda and people like that but erm

Norrine (PS101) [7292] Mm ... historical references aye.
Chris (PS05X)   [7293] and cards, and telegrams.
Norrine (PS101) [7294] Wonderful, where do you keep them?
Chris (PS05X)   [7295] In a box on top of the shelf.
Norrine (PS101) [7296] Most impressive!
Chris (PS05X)   [7297] We'll have to get them out and have a look at them.
Norrine (PS101) [7298] Mm ...
Chris (PS05X)   [7299] [...] washing.
Norrine (PS101) [7300] Yes, when I spoke to Jack I said how's progress on
                fixing it?
                [7301] And he said it wa I reckon if they don't fix this
                weekend it's going to be next year, early next year.
Chris (PS05X)   [7302] Early next year would be
Norrine (PS101) [7303] I made no comment.
Chris (PS05X)   [7304] Yes, so there's nothing we can say we're not we don't
                want want to make them feel awkward about it I mean they have
                planned what they can plan.
Norrine (PS101) [7305] No good making them feel awkward, they just do what
                they're going to do and that's it.
Chris (PS05X)   [7306] Yes quite ... well that's fair enough isn't it?
                [7307] They can't consider everybody ... or they could never
                make a decision.
Lynda (PS102)   [7308] Thank you, right ... So you enjoy your [...] ?
Chris (PS05X)   [7309] We always do when we come here, thank you.
Lynda (PS102)   [7310] Yes.
                [7311] It's always very nice ... I wish we could come more
                often.
Lynda (PS102)   [7312] Yeah [laugh] ... well maybe you're missing the Chinese
                food. [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [7313] That's right.
Lynda (PS102)   [7314] Yeah [laugh] thank you.
Norrine (PS101) [7315] Many thanks.
Lynda (PS102)   [7316] Bye.
Norrine (PS101) [7317] Bye. ...
Chris (PS05X)   [7318] A lovely treat, thank you darling.
Norrine (PS101) [7319] I enjoyed it ... glad you did.
Chris (PS05X)   [7320] You chose very well, I used to get really nervous when I
                came to Chinese restaurants, I never knew what to choose.
Norrine (PS101) [7321] Really?
Chris (PS05X)   [7322] But gradually over the years you get the hang of it.
                [7323] Some people get the hang of these things more quickly
                than I do.
Norrine (PS101) [7324] We didn't go often enough dear, that's the other thing.
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [7325] Right, shall we make tracks?
Chris (PS05X)   [7326] Yes.
*** 221 (Tape 003005) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [7327] Yes,Po Petts Wood was eh an inbetween the wars, trendy
                suburban development wasn't it?
Norrine (PS101) [7328] Well it's still
Chris (PS05X)   [7329] Commuter land.
Norrine (PS101) [7330] it's still commuter land.
Chris (PS05X)   [7331] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [7332] It's not unpleasant at all, these I mean
Chris (PS05X)   [7333] No I'm not saying it's unpleasant I'm saying it was
                trendy in those days.
Norrine (PS101) [7334] Trendy, yeah.
Chris (PS05X)   [7335] But there is an awful lot of sameyness about it
                unfortunately.
Norrine (PS101) [7336] Well, especially in a long road like this.
Chris (PS05X)   [7337] Mm.
Norrine (PS101) [7338] Some of the other roads have more individual houses in
                don't they?
Chris (PS05X)   [7339] Well they have bigger ... detached houses I'm not ...
                sure how individual they actually are.
Norrine (PS101) [7340] But even these aren't all the same.
Chris (PS05X)   [7341] Are they not?
Norrine (PS101) [7342] No ... they are all semi-detached but er ... there are
                two or three different styles and they are alternated.
*** 222 (Tape 003006) ***
Norrine (PS101) [7343] Have you had the accounts from John?
                [7344] ... From the office.
Chris (PS05X)   [7345] No not yet, it was started on Tuesday this week ... they
                have the books for ten days or something before they started on
                them.
Norrine (PS101) [7346] How long do they take to do them?
Chris (PS05X)   [7347] Oh well I've had certain queries already and
Norrine (PS101) [7348] so they're working on them?
Chris (PS05X)   [7349] and the basis, basics would have been by the end of next
                week but certain, assuming that they are not interrupted and
                sort of dragged onto something more lucrative ... the bad news
                will have been quantified by then.
Norrine (PS101) [7350] Well we can't have a bad year presumably it means you
                don't pay tax.
Chris (PS05X)   [7351] Mhm that's right.
Norrine (PS101) [7352] Which can't be a bad thing.
Chris (PS05X)   [7353] Sure.
Norrine (PS101) [7354] Or are you paying for a year in a in arrears?
Chris (PS05X)   [7355] Oh you, in in in essence you do but even so it's a ...
                you
Norrine (PS101) [7356] As long as you're pa not paying in your bad for your
                good year.
Chris (PS05X)   [7357] Oh that, oh that happens too.
Norrine (PS101) [7358] Is that likely to happen this year then ... paying for
                last year?
Chris (PS05X)   [7359] That's right.
Norrine (PS101) [7360] And the year before so you will have to pay tax.
Chris (PS05X)   [7361] Something like that yes.
Norrine (PS101) [7362] Or or for bad year.
Chris (PS05X)   [7363] That's right yes.
Norrine (PS101) [7364] But do you offset it, I mean can you?
Chris (PS05X)   [7365] You what s normally happens is that the following year
                when you make profit you say ah but last year ... I made er you
                know I made a loss of ten thousand pound set that off against
                the profit of ten thousand pound I made this year so that tax
                pay ... losses can be carried forward ... there are other more
                complex ways of doing it too but that's the standard sort of
                way, I think.
Norrine (PS101) [7366] But it's the year that you haven't, but yo the year
                before that you haven't yet paid for ... you have to pay for it
                in the year that it you don't make any profit.
Chris (PS05X)   [7367] Yes ... you normally pay for it in the following year.
Norrine (PS101) [7368] Yeah, so that's a bit of a disadvantage.
Chris (PS05X)   [7369] Because yet pulled together the figures for last year.
Norrine (PS101) [7370] Sure.
Chris (PS05X)   [7371] Sure, I I had fork out corporation tax a few months ago
                for the previous good year.
Norrine (PS101) [7372] Yes. [car indicator]
Chris (PS05X)   [7373] John got a bit shirty about the ten pound or something,
                he reckoned his wife had didn't he? [laugh]
Norrine (PS101) [7374] [...] to pay his bill, no doubt.
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [7375] I don't think she'll be very pleased would she?
Chris (PS05X)   [...]
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7376] That's not the point!
Norrine (PS101) [7377] She's enjoying herself, we met her at John's house [...]
                ... I felt nervous this morning for sleeping home late although
                in fact I have been awake quite a lot in between, but
Chris (PS05X)   [7378] Mm
Norrine (PS101) [7379] it was only ten to eight and I got up because I thought
                I was getting late for work and I'd better get moving.
Chris (PS05X)   [7380] Was she walking in?
Norrine (PS101) [7381] No, they went on the bus this morning.
Chris (PS05X)   [7382] Ah.
Norrine (PS101) [7383] She caught the twenty to nine bus.
Chris (PS05X)   [7384] She might just about made it then ... because she
                certainly seemed to be a bit late on the move.
Norrine (PS101) [7385] She was alright, I made her something to eat.
Chris (PS05X)   [7386] Mm, [...]
Norrine (PS101) [7387] she said she wanted her jeans ironed and I er pressed
                them and then when I she came downstairs in her black trousers
                and [...]
*** 223 (Tape 003007) ***
Chris (PS05X)   [7388] Ah the ramblers must do a roaring trade.
Norrine (PS101) [7389] Yes ... we've never done anything about inviting [...]
                ... [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7390] I've been trying to get hold of him
Norrine (PS101) [7391] Really?
Chris (PS05X)   [7392] to organize meat for the barbecue. ...
Norrine (PS101) [7393] When is the barbecue, the twentieth?
                [7394] ... Something of June
Chris (PS05X)   [7395] Thirtieth.
Norrine (PS101) [7396] A Sunday.
Chris (PS05X)   [7397] Sunday.
Norrine (PS101) [7398] Mm.
Chris (PS05X)   [7399] Why?
Norrine (PS101) [7400] Becau Because I forgot ... That was the day I was
                thinking of having a proper lunch party but I won't do it if
                you're going out.
Chris (PS05X)   [7401] Try the twenty-third.
Norrine (PS101) [7402] No, I haven't I won't have finished my reports then.
Chris (PS05X)   [7403] Aha.
Norrine (PS101) [7404] [...] two weekends away I shall be up my to ears in it
                ... mustn't plan anything for that weekend [...] .

Chris (PS05X)   [7405] Blowing awfully quickly, that's the second out of the
                sixth that you bought yesterday.
Norrine (PS101) [7406] Yes ... I bought them in Sainsbury's they are
                Sainsbury's bulbs aren't they?
Chris (PS05X)   [7407] Philip's bulbs.
Norrine (PS101) [7408] I mean that was a new bulb, well that's the second one
                you've used.
Chris (PS05X)   [7409] Second one I've used.
Norrine (PS101) [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7410] No, not yet ... What's on television?
Norrine (PS101) [7411] Well there's only look like two that are anything [...]
                discussing that film about the lambs ... whatever it's called
                with Jodie Foster, the rest didn't look very interesting but
                you may feel differently.
Chris (PS05X)   [7412] Yes, a bit forgettable isn't it?
                [7413] ... I put my specs outside.
Norrine (PS101) [7414] They're in [...]
Norrine (PS101) [7415] Oh here they are

Chris (PS05X)   [7416] That's a very funny business isn't it?
                [7417] ... Effective exercise.
Norrine (PS101) [7418] Pardon?
Chris (PS05X)   [7419] This bit about obesity.
Norrine (PS101) [7420] How about this ... No Smoking Please stickers have been
                sent out to London cabbies but unfortunately they will not
                arrive before next week.

Norrine (PS101) [7422] Marvellous [...] skull of a Viking here.
Chris (PS05X)   [7423] Really, what was that then?
Norrine (PS101) [7424] This eight hundred year old ... skull of a Viking found
                off the northern coast of Scotland [...]
Chris (PS05X)   [7425] Oh.
Norrine (PS101) [7426] and old other bones and possessions including shield,
                [...] comb, brooch ... last weekend it was found.
Chris (PS05X)   [7427] Mhm.
