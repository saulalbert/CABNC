*LOR:	Masters again, yeah.
*CHE:	What do you mean masters?
*LOR:	Mastered to get into the race.Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and initiative and you're in!
*CHE:	I bet, I bet   (.) he's scared 
*LOR:	I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's   (        ) for security guards.You cannot walk past them if   (.) you're going in that way.So we had to go   (.) past this little shed which is right up   (.) right up this stupid grass earthy bank   (.) right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in.Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great   (.) hole in the gate   (.) massive!Walked through there and got to the simulator   (.) took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in   (.) walked straight past and we were right on site!We wasn't aware it was there.Well I thought, saved us twenty quid!
*CHE:	So all   (.)  (        ) ?
*LOR:	We were going , we were in!We're in!We're in!Pretty good!
*CHE:	So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really?Eh?All that 
*LOR:	And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so
*CHE:	Have you got to pass for the stage then?
*LOR:	Yeah.I used an 
*CHE:	What 
*LOR:	old one.So   (.) those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine   (.) turned mine round she saw it and went   (.) she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't   (.) thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't   (.) just turned it round on her.
*CHE:	I bet your   (.) friends a will be   (.) sick then, won't they?
*LOR:	I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one!And there must have been about ten thousand there last time.They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in   (.) and you can spin round.
*CHE:	Oh yeah!
*LOR:	They had one of those in there   (.) but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on!Those lasers   (.) lasers that    (        )  (.) the  (        ) .
*CHE:	Velcro walls?
*LOR:	No, they didn't have that there.A huge octopus, (        ) octopus   (.) -ish, had these massive   (.) tentacles that's going right the way across the ceiling! (        )  (.) Video screens. (.) Very good!They're all gonna be pissed on Friday cos we got in for nothing!
*CHE:	Why is your voice so quiet?
*LOR:	Cos   (.) the washing machine out there   (.) it's  (        ) .
*CHE:	What sort of smoke   (.) from the machine?
*LOR:	Hiss!Oh it's  (        ) ?
*CHE:	 [laughing] No  [] !What hissing?
*LOR:	Proper smoke machine.
*CHE:	Oh!
*LOR:	Mum!I've got to write to Bicksons.
*CHE:	Mm.
*LOR:	Ask them to write me a reference so I got form to fill in   (.) to send off for something but I've gotta write something.And I've gotta to, I've gotta say something to them.
*CHE:	Yeah, well?
*LOR:	And I dunno who I'm writing to either.
*CHE:	Well, put the   (.) Principal.
*LOR:	What should I say?What do you think I should say?Ask  to write me a   (.) ah I know who I'll ask, alright. (        ) .
*CHE:	 (        ) 
*LOR:	Well cos  said that    (.) this guy said that  's the guy in   (        ) so I could
*CHE:	Well then you
*LOR:	I can
*CHE:	have to send him a stamped   (.) envelope with the address of the guy and putting    (.)  (        ) on it.He'll be more inclined to   (.) do it then won't he?
*LOR:	Oh what , what inside in the 
*CHE:	Inside the   (.) letter that you're   (.) writing to him.I think that that would probably be quite a good idea wouldn't it, really? (.) Yes?You must be exhausted?Why don't you go to sleep?
*LOR:	 (        ) this stuff haven't I?I've got things to do.
*CHE:	I suppose we could   (.) just ignore it.
*LOR:	It's a waste of a day isn't it, really?I'd rather be   (.) extremely tired. (.) Saw Zac last night.

*LOR:	That's why, I said I, I said I'd heard about you in the papers and the   (.) just said oh yeah!
*CHE:	Was he embarrassed?
*LOR:	No.
*CHE:	Wouldn't you be?
*LOR:	A bit, yeah.
*CHE:	I'd be very embarrassed!
*LOR:	See you've got that thing going whilst my voice is going.
*CHE:	It's alright.I took it down to the Spar shop as well.
*LOR:	Did you?
*CHE:	And erm   (.) I took it   (.) to the   (.) park with Jack   (.) and he kept pulling and I said bloody dog!And   (.) and then er   (.) I took it to the station   (.) as well, but   (.) I couldn't get many other voices, they were a bit garbled but   (.) it works really well!It is such a good machine that!The mike on that is so good! ((dog barking)) (.) What's he barking about?Where is he?Jack!Shut up!He's got his hackles up!Look!
