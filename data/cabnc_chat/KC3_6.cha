*HEI:	Which wasn't too bad. (.) 
*VIC:	I'll save you a bit 
*HEI:	I thought she might have said something last year cos I was leaving.
*VIC:	Well perhaps she thought you might change your mind. (.) 
*JOA:	Perhaps she thought you wouldn't really leave.
*HEI:	She was wrong then. (.) 
*FRE:	Well are you making a guest appearance then?
*HEI:	Yeah.Cos she'd been wanting to do Aladdin for a couple of years but it was on at The Playhouse
*VIC:	And then it was on at the Theatre Royal.

*HEI:	and then last year we did Peter Pan and I said right I'm leaving   (.) but she's always wanted
*JOA:	To do it.
*HEI:	to do Aladdin so when she thought she'd do it this year she wanted me for Aladdin.

*HEI:	I was singing it in, not in my feet I was going    (        )  ((singing very low))I was me going to do all the words 
*VIC:	We'll see if we can get some music from the library, see if our library's got
*HEI:	 (        ) went down   (        ) into town
*VIC:	Yes but you, you have to buy the whole album and they hadn't got that in, they'd just sold out.
