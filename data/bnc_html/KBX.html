               [2] But there are all sorts of reasons why we don't get that news, one guy said well if we wanted to do it I know if we wanted to make the news that, according to the level of human suffering we'd start off with Ethiopia then we'd have the Kurdish problem and you know just made a living of disaster areas around the world, he said we might of finished up with a light hearted discussion on the poll tax, you know as the, as the light, the lightener at the end of the news if you like, and our, what news we receive here depends on our perception of the world, but mainly it's the other way round our perception of the world is, is what, you know what it, or rather the news that we get actually manufactures our perception of the world.<br>
               [3] You can find out about world events if you read a good newspaper, somebody said to me yesterday in class well we don't get the news about these places, you do, you just don't get it on the T V, it's there in the Guardian every day, it's there in the Independent every day, quite a lot of it gets reported in the Telegraph, but it's no good if you're reading the Mirror, you won't get it in there, you won't get it in the Mail or any other of those newspapers, the tabloids, but these things are happening, why would we be interested?<br>
               [4] Why would we be interested in finding out these things?<br>
               [5]  ... Do you read the international section of papers then any of you?<br>

               [670] You'd recognize this if you are a driver and especially a driver who maybe has the opportunity of travelling long distance, now years ago when I was younger and perhaps some of you in the audience when you were younger, you could go from here to the South of England with no trouble, without a break and you'd head on down the motorway and you, you'd be alert and alive and er ready to meet up with all sorts of emergencies and you'd drive quite well all the way down, non stop down the South of England, but if you're like me now, when I get to Stafford on the motorway   [laugh] you're beginning to feel as if you've had enough and it's difficult to try and keep your concentration as you used to years ago, and that's how it can be in the truth sometimes, when we've been with it a long time   ... that, we grow older   ... not only physically, but spiritually too we become very experienced in the truth and we become very sort of fat spiritually, we can live off of that fat can't we?<br>
               [671] And er we can get by on lots of things and when an emergency does come, sometimes we can cope with it if it's not too big a one, but other times it can catch up with us, simply because we are only sort of half awake   ... so the purpose of the talk today is to try and help us all to see various ways in which we can stay awake in the truth physic er, er spiritually speaking.<br>

               [674] But as we said earlier that some of us who have been in the truth for a long time we were like that years ago, but somewhere along the line we've become drowsy and a little sort of halfhearted and maybe dozing a little bit as we go down that sort of motorway er of spirituality and that, that the longer you go it can become more difficult because other things come along don't they?<br>

               [676] doesn't it?<br>
               [677] It, do it now while you're young, while you've got your strength, because there will come days when you look around and you think well I just wish I could do that again, and that's the way we're made, and that's the way it will always be in this system of things, but there's lots of little things that we, you and I, can work on to help us to stay spiritually alert, vigilant and awake.<br>
               [678] Now in the scriptures, we're gonna have a look at a few because the scriptures counsel us time and again, er that we are living in difficult times, we know that and it can become difficult to stay spiritually alert and awake and that's why constantly throughout the scriptures you'll find that we're er counselled and encouraged to stay awake, stay awake and as we sang stand firm and, and grow mighty spirits, the first one is in Romans chapter thirteen.<br>
               [679]  ... Most of the scriptures we'll be looking at today is very familiar with us   ... we know them and some of them we may be able to recite without even looking at the words, but er, if we can try and get you to think a little bit about them, then we've achieved something, if we can get you to think that, you know, well am I dozing or am I really awake as I should be, then we'll achieve more, in verse eleven it speaks there about er, you people knowing the season, well what people are we talking about?<br>

               [681] It's within the congregation, Paulo was writing, not to those outside but to those dedicated baptized brothers and sisters in the trees, said   [reading] you know the season that it is already the hour for you to awake   [] so he was speaking to spiritual people, spiritually minded people and yet here he is telling them to be awake, awake from sleep or slumbers, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became the leavers, and that's true with us all if you came into the truth yesterday, the time that much nearer now isn't it?<br>
               [682] Because you can never go back to yesterday, if you came in last year or five years ago, ten years ago or longer, some of you have been in the truth for many, many years   ... and it is nearer now than it ever was when you first came along and joined Jehovah's people and as it says   [reading] the night is well along   [] and if any of us have ever worked on the night shift, I think we're all well aware aren't we that when the night is well along and<br></td>

               [683] you're coming near to the end of your shift   ... you're not waking up because it's getting near morning whereas everybody else is, you're finding it much more difficult to carry on because you've gone through the whole night working, the night is well along and it becomes increasingly more difficult to stay awake so physically, spiritually, whatever way you look at it, it is certainly very difficult to stay awake in the truth today, but it isn't that difficult and it isn't er a hurdle that none of us can overcome, Jehovah says that his load is light, Jesus echoed that didn't he and it is true that if we do Jehovah's   ... will, Jehovah's way, then it will be made light for us, he will help us to stay awake, but he's not going to allow us to slumber and drift off into obscurity, but it all comes back in hinges upon us and that's why the counsel is in verse thirteen   [reading] as a day, as in a day time look, let us walk decently   [] so we have to do something don't we?<br>
               [684] Walking means exercise, walking means effort, you and I have to do something to keep ourselves spiritually awake, going back to our illustration again about the car driver on the motorway, you find yourself after so many miles just dozing off because the road is so straight, not much traffic around, not much to think about apart from the countryside that goes by and you're there foot on the accelerator, no braking, no gear changing, nothing at all and you get to the point where you're driving one-handed by the thing, that's the time when you get so relaxed isn't it?<br>
               [685] That you can easily lose your concentration and go off to sleep   ... and so it is in the truth, so we need to stay awake, stand firm for almighty, be vigilant and again in the scriptures we could look up half a dozen scriptures in the Christian Greek scriptures to show that we need to keep spiritually awake and it uses different terminology   ... you've heard me use some already, remember the one in verse Peter four, verse seven?<br>
               [686] It tells us there to be vigilant, vigilant with a view to prayers, isn't that staying awake?<br>
               [687] Anyone who's vigilant knows what's going on and they're aware of what's happening, so again it, it shows that we must do something as they said on that motorway, the thing to do when you feel yourself going into drow drowsiness is, is stop the car perhaps, get out and have a walk round, do something, I know I, er in the past when I've felt myself going off to sleep in those situations, I've been pinching myself and, and really making yourself do something rather than just sitting there doing nothing, cos that's the way we just go off and get lowered into sleep and our lives are involved in this, we've read and heard about people that have gone to sleep on motorways haven't they?<br>
               [688] Where have they finished up?<br>
               [689] Crashing the car, taking someone else's life with them, terrible situations, terrible tragedies can come about because a person physically goes to sleep   ... so it can be in a spiritual sense that we can nod off to sleep and not only our lives are involved, but our fellow brothers' and sisters' too,<br></td>

               [690] especially if we have a, a responsible position within the congregation, because if we nod off, those of us who are elders, than others lives can be   ... terrifically involved can't they?<br>
               [691] Because we are not doing what we should be doing, we'll hear a little bit more about that later, another one in Matthew twenty six and verse forty one, keep on the watch and pray continually, notice our New Year's text is all about prayer isn't it?<br>
               [692] Rejoice in the hope I had, that's lovely isn't it?<br>
               [693] Thinking about the, the, the hope ahead but what have we got to do?<br>
               [694] We've got to persevere in prayer, which means effort doesn't it?<br>
               [695] So in everything that we do and staying spiritually awake, we have to do something, it all comes back to you and I at the end of the day, no one else can do it for us   ... we sometimes think well, well, so and so can help, I mean this is true to a degree, but at the end of the day it all comes back to us doesn't it?<br>
               [696] We're the ones that have said to Jehovah I am dedicating my life to you, I am going to do this, do that and the other and it's up to us as to whether we do it, so it requires effort, first  [...] , five, six, also says   [reading] let us stay awake, keep our senses   [] first Peter, five, eight   [reading] keep your senses, be watchful   [] and then first Corinthians, ten, twelve which I think the song was based on   [reading] let him think that he is standing, beware, beware, beware that he does not fall  [] , if you think things are going along nicely and you're in a comfortable little corner, a little niche in the truth, and it's just how you like it, and it's just the way you want it to be and there's the time we need to be aware because there's an opening for Satan to get into to make us fall.<br>
               [697] Now going back into the Hebrew scriptures, you'll find there that this sort of staying awake counsel, an idea was there long before the days of Jesus and the Apostles and people's lives were involved in its state, even in those days, let's just let us have a look at one, Isaiah forty two   ... eighteen to twenty   ... now this terms it slightly different, but when you look at it and analyze it, you realize he's talking about exactly the same thing, it's regarding the nation of Israel who turned away from Jehovah, they weren't doing what they should be doing, or should've been doing as he's pleading with them look there, that look here, here you deaf ones, well we know the nation of Israel weren't all physically deaf, they were like we are, perhaps had a few deaf individuals amongst them, but<br></td>

               [698] generally speaking the nation had good ears, they knew what was what and they listened quite well, hear you deaf ones he's describing them and look forth to see you blind once   ... verse twenty it was a case of seeing many things, but you did not cheat watching and Daniel, verse twenty five, look it says there a little phrase near, half way through that he took no note, the nation took no note of what was happening at that time, but we know what happened to them, many of them, thousands, a million of them lost their lives didn't they?<br>
               [699] Because they were overthrown and the others were taken off into captivity into battle life, and what a life they had, the one of slavery, so at that time because they took no note, because they were destiny instructions to Jehovah for his word and again want to see, they had eyes, but they just didn't want to see it   ... they knew, all the whys and wherefores and what the responsibilities were, but they didn't measure up to them and because of that many of them lost their lives, and if they didn't they were taken into captivity, Jeremiah four, in verse twenty two, again another prophecy sent to them exactly over the same message, the same reasons   ... describes to them as being a, er people that is foolish and of me they have taken no notice Jeremiah four and verse twenty two.<br>
               [700] In Noah's day, if you go back to Noah's day it was exactly the same now, isn't that what Jesus said justice in the days of Noah, so it will be in there somewhere, they were eating and drinking and marrying and doing all the things that you, you know, you and I do today isn't it?<br>
               [701] And what is it, they took no note and the flood came and swept them all away.<br>
               [702] So it's been no different dying through time, the counsel has been there because Jehovah knows that we're all of falling flesh aren't we?<br>
               [703] We're all prone to do that, were all prone to take the line of least resistance and you find this not just in the truth but in any sort of community in life, in any area of life that wish to go, you, you may find this at work or at school, you youngsters, there's always a little Johnny at the back isn't it, that, that will fit in the back row and think if I'm back here teacher won't notice you see, were act were actually tuck himself up in the corner and er think well if I'm, if I'm up here nobody will notice me and see the day goes by and er we don't have so much to do, those are the type of people that in, in, in a physical life er sort of going to sleep aren't they, they don't want to accept responsibility and we, we find even in the truth, you'll always find it in congregations like we have here in our congregation, we're not different, we're all the same aren't we, we're all flesh and we're all imperfect and we're all prone to doing or wanting to do the things that are different or   [laugh] you know than, than what Jehovah wants us to do and we all want to tuck ourselves up a little corner sometimes and yet we shouldn't be like that and this is what the scriptures tell us and warn us about to put ourselves headlong into the truth, be whole sole, be awake, be alert, be vigilant to the things that are going on and there's a lot going on in the truth at this particular time, things are changing, the scriptures tell us that the scene of the world is changing and that's true isn't it?<br>
               [704] It changes so fast and here's we have a job to keep up with it.<br>
               [705] Did you know Jehovah's organizations always changes, not with it, but to combat it   ... that way it comes to work, it keeps us alive, it keeps us on our toes, and so we could go on and on in saying well look keep away, stay awake and do everything that we should and, and we can stand here for the rest of the talk saying well do it, do it, do it   [laugh] but that's easy for me to do that isn't it?<br>
               [706] To tell you what to do   ... but it's also knowing how to do it, because sometimes especially if we knew in the truth, we don't always know what to do and if we're very young you see, we're, it's, it's one<br></td>

[reading] do not quibble about assignments and arrangements   [] I think we're all guilty of that at some time aren't we?<br>
               [710]  [reading] Perform well whatever assignments you have, trust God's angels to remove and replace where necessary   [] when things aren't being done in a congregation as you think that they might be or should be done, or you might think well the, why don't the elders do something about this, we'll leave it, leave it to Jehovah and the angels, if there's anything wrong, they'll sort it out and they'll make the elves sort it out as well, they have ways and means, again coming back to this new text here   [reading] persistence in prayer shows you are awake the spirituals   [] so there's another way Jesus was outstanding in its constantly regarding prayers   [reading] keep awake by field ministry   [] and here's a rare one in any public talk   [reading] financial contributions   [] financial, we don't hear that very often in public talks, we, we always say that there's, er people come to the meetings, there's no collection, no mention of money, the seats are free, you're<br></td>

               [731] It's us and people out there, there is still people out there sighing and crying and groaning under the detestable things that are going on in this world, I've no doubt you've met many, but, when they say I don't know what the world's coming to, well if you know what's in your magazines and then your literature   ... and the reasoning book, all these lovely provisions, because you've devoured it, you've eaten it like that scroll that John was given, it was sweet to him wasn't it?<br>
               [732] And it's sweet to others as well who want to receive it, but it's also bitter to those who don't, but what a wonderful provision that is from Jehovah, so are we conscious of our spiritual needs, no question we could just ask in passing, you notice the kingdom ministry is changed?<br>

               [736] We also mentioned   ... don't quibble about assignments and arrangements, now in Romans chapter twelve, which this text is taken from, if you just go to the previous verses, this is from verse twelve isn't it?<br>
               [737] Erm   ... Romans verse   ... and verse four   ... you notice this text is taken from verse twelve, rejoice in the hope and then persevering prayer, but if you go into verse four, what it's speaking about there, but just as we have in one body many, members, but the members do not all have the same function and then in six to eight he goes on to describe that we all have gifts don't we differing according to the undeserved kindness given to us, whether   [...] er so forth and so faith, ministry, erm teaching, exhorting, all these different gifts, though sometimes if a particular brother or sister doesn't have a particular gift and we think well you know that's a bit hard going I can't seem to listen to them, that's an area perhaps where we could erm be quivering couldn't we, or complaining, especially about assignments, you might get speakers that come here from other congregations, and some are better than others aren't they?<br>
               [738] And you think when, when you get one that's not as good, you think well why do they   ... why is it that that speaker can't give such a good talk, why is he giving a talk?<br>
               [739] Well should we quibble about that, not as individuals should we?<br>

               [766] And er some of us seemed to be more awkward than others, I mean some people's feet when you look at them and, and areas like that, that, you think well why did Jehovah make them like that, they're so ugly   [laugh] and yet without them where would we be?<br>
               [767] And isn't that how the congregation is?<br>
