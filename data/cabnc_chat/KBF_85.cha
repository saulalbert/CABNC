*DAV:	If I say so myself that weren't bad.I must have used up four different bags of potatoes in the   (        ) down there. (.) Ain't got a spud left in the house. (.) Not one in the whole house. (.)

*DAV:	We're getting no frosts or anything.That's what, that's what   (        ) some really bad hard frosts.
*BRE:	That's the trouble.And half of it why everybody's got coughs and colds.
*DAV:	Not killing the germs are they?
*BRE:	That's it.Because it's, it's so mild. (.) I mean I can't remember when we last had a frost.
*DAV:	That's what we want innit?A good week of really good hard frosts.
*BRE:	That's like what the decorator said really   (.) knocking it out they're on erm    (.)  (        ) 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	Pete, well Pete can't see why it's taking so long   (.) the hall.So he's put them back on instead of hourly, (        ) work.
*DAV:	Well it has it's    (.)  [laughing] it's the only way to deal with that lot  [] . (.) 
*BRE:	But they said like   (.) they will get his room done.They've given him a price just for painting the walls.No putting a   (        ) up and all the extras he wants.Because it's like you say   (        ) in the hallway. ((cough)) 
*CAR:	 [shouting]  (        )  [] 
*DAV:	 (        )

*LEE:	Yeah. (.) 
*DAV:	Thank you.
*BRE:	You don't hear them though, do you?
*DAV:	 (        ) I was putting the spuds on, I dunno   (.) twenty past two I think.I was sat on the couch   (.) and when I woke up, ten to three.Fuck me they'll be burnt. ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	Well I thought today at work   (.) thought there's no way he's gonna last out.I thought I bet he's fighting it.It's alright if you keep busy but it's   (.) when you stop and stand innit?
*DAV:	Yeah I know.That's what I mean, when I go to bed I should in theory   (.)  (        ) .But I say I   (.) went all day without nothing to eat    (.)  (        ) bloody starved.I got in there and I thought   (.) cos I wanted bacon and eggs   (        ) but I thought if I have breakfast I'm gonna think well   (.)  (        ) .So I went in, I just had an egg on toast   (        ) really nice.
*BRE:	And that's when you bought your meat pies?
*DAV:	Yeah I thought well he's sitting home I can't  (        ) . (        ) I said to the girl give us two meat pies wrapped up.
*BRE:	She probably thought blinking pig!
*DAV:	 ((laugh))  (.) come in he was like a little big kid.I said come on get your breakfast.He said what you got then?I said   (.) it's in my coat.He said   (.)  (        ) . ((laugh)) I said do you want it I said, get out here I said fucking get it.He got out here, when he unwraps it he   (.) beaming like a little ki  ((laugh)) . (        ) 
*BRE:	Did he put them in the microwave?
*DAV:	No he went off.
*BRE:	What stuck, just from Tesco  (        ) ?
*DAV:	Yeah.They was wrapped up.I shoved them in me coat and  (        ) .He was sitting there eating pie sandwiches  ((laugh)) .Like a great big baby.I thought you  (        ) .
*BRE:	 (        ) twenty past eight.
*DAV:	Yeah.Well when he, I said where do you get that from?He said oh I been  (        ) .I thought well, you must have rode him up there thinking   (.) you know, get him something to watch.I thought you'd gone up there and got it.I didn't realize he'd gone up and got it himself. (.) 
*BRE:	 (        ) ten past nine  (        ) . (.) That tree   (        ) budding there  (        ) .
*DAV:	Yeah.That's   (.) middle  (        ) , that's coming up innit?
*BRE:	It's growing up nice.This first one's not doing much is it?I think it was suffocated by those others.
*DAV:	Yeah.That's like that little one over there, that's   (        ) 
*BRE:	Or unless it's   (.) that's the height.
*DAV:	No  (        ) .
*BRE:	Your trees are growing now aren't they?
*DAV:	Yeah.They've shot up actually.This time next year you you'll have a good   (.) you'll have a nice little hedge there then.That'll be up    (.)  (        ) be up at least another s ooh foot probably. (.) Probably be a   (.) a lot higher than the sticks but they won't have bushed out. (.) 
*BRE:	Don't you have to   (.) do you   (.) no cos if you trim them at the top to bush out
*DAV:	Yeah you do.
*BRE:	Oh you do.When it's finished 
*DAV:	Not   (.) not until you get to the height that you want.
*BRE:	You want.
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	Where you gonna go?Just like er  (.) 
*DAV:	That's   (.) just about the same height as the fence you see.Not the   (.) pointed bit but the   (.) gutter level.
*BRE:	I shall be glad when that privet hedge g  (.) privet hedge grows.And hides his bit of shed. (.) Dunno where Mike and Barbara's gone  (        ) .
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	 (        ) .They're going away Saturday for a week or something.
*DAV:	Oh are they?
*BRE:	She does that   (        ) shift doesn't she?Twelve weeks on eight weeks off.She's semi-retired.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	 (        ) would you? ((cough)) 
*DAV:	That's what I mean. (        ) Why don't she have decent car.Travel round Britain   (.) Scotland and that.Have a nice bed and breakfast. (.) There's so many places they haven't seen or haven't been.They just don't   (        ) 
*BRE:	They're gonna buy a new car aren't they?
*DAV:	Eh?
*BRE:	They're gonna buy a new car at Christmas, after Christmas.
*DAV:	Who?
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	 (        ) !
*BRE:	Yeah.I remember he said when you, mum got that money.
*DAV:	No.I dunno he said he's got this one fixed now. (        ) . (.) 
*BRE:	He's got it fixed?
*DAV:	 (        ) fixed it didn't he?
*BRE:	What's the matter with him?
*DAV:	They wanna get themselves something like a one point eight hatchback, so it's got a little, nice sized engine
*BRE:	Automatic.
*DAV:	Yeah. (.) Get like they are, semi-retired and why they're putting that great lump on the end of their house I just don't know.But that's up to them.Beats me.Cos there's never more than about two of them   (        ) is there?
*BRE:	And then he goes out doesn't he?Occasionally.
*DAV:	That's what I mean.They're gonna have a great big lump stuck on the house.I mean that ten grand, that's their car.They could keep their house.Use it as a base   (.) and travel. (.) They could shoot off on a Tuesday or something.Take their time going up to Scotland. (.) You could have a week up   (.) two weeks up there.You could come back, do a bit more work. (        ) . By the time they pack up work they'll be so decrepit they won't be able to do anything. (.) 
*BRE:	I think your mum'll probably retire when your dad does won't she?
*DAV:	 (        ) aren't they? (.) I dunno. (.) Mind you, (        ) criticize and say should buy this should buy that.You don't really know what sort of money they have got do you?Haven't got a clue.
*BRE:	Must have a fair bit thought mustn't they?
*DAV:	I mean I I  (        ) .
*BRE:	When you think they're earn both earning a full wage.No mortgage. (.) Haven't got no rates.They've got the poll tax   (.) and their gas and electric   (.) and the phone bill.That's all that comes out.
*DAV:	They probably   (        ) about twelve hundred, thirteen hundred  (        ) .
*BRE:	 (        ) got a lot of money.
*DAV:	Oh I don't know.
*BRE:	Well she gets, how much does she get from her pension a week?
*DAV:	Oh   (.) that's without the pensions.That's just their wages.So they get about   (.) twelve   (        ) thirteen hundred.And probably picking up another   (.) hundred pound   (.) hundred and twenty pound between them a week.We'll say another five.No they're probably   (.) they're probably clearing every month about seventeen hundred quid. (        ) 
*BRE:	And what have they got to pay out?
*DAV:	Poll tax.Food. (.) That's basically it really. (.) 
*BRE:	Think, they've got no mortgage.And the bills aren't that high are they? (.) Think they've actually bought the T V now haven't they? (.) 
*DAV:	Oh yeah.
*BRE:	T V and the video. (.) 
*DAV:	Mind you when you think of it like that when you   (.) when you say that you've got no mortgage and your kids grow up they don't need your money and that   (.) and if you're both in good jobs   (.) it is   (.) you do tend to think to yourself well at least lot   (.) lot longer than. (.) Sort of, you've got your health   (        ) knock out   (        ) sixty seventy, right we can do it for another year.I mean   (        ) got no mortgage to pay out you can   (.) you can bank eight hundred pound of that   (.) every month.
*BRE:	Well they probably do but   (.) I mean   (.) right they can go and   (.) I mean what do they spend their money on?
*DAV:	Presumably perhaps they're just saving it up until they get to a certain   (.) certain age and they're gonna say right that's it let's   (.) just go. [laughing] But I can't see it either  [] .
*BRE:	 (        ) no sort of well they don't do anything do they?I reckon she must be, by the time they get home from work she don't wanna do a lot. (.)  ((cough)) I thought she   (.) but I'm trying to think what she phoned me up for. (.) Yeah, she phoned me up to ask me   (.) what she should do about Beryl.
*DAV:	What she should do  (        ) ?
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	What do you mean what she should do about Beryl?
*BRE:	For Christmas presents.
*DAV:	 (        ) .See if   (        ) makes contact with her   (.) your mum'll start on her then.
*BRE:	Well I said to her   (.) er your mum asked me last night.She said   (.) I, will I get a bottle of wine and that?And I said well   (.) And she, well to be honest Bren she said, she hasn't really done anything to me and Sid has she? (.) I said well no, you know
*DAV:	 (        ) I told her I said as soon as you receive gifts like that   (.) I said she knows you're a soft touch mate.She'll be   (.) she'll be 
*BRE:	Yeah but she does it   (.) like she said though   (.) I mean if I was your mum, I said to her if I was, I would just give it to her.I said because the fact is
*DAV:	How's she gonna see her anyway?
*BRE:	Well she'll just give it to Ellie to give her. (.) And send it up there and she said, and I mean all she, she buys Linda a tin of biscuits, Jane a tin of biscuits and Ellie. (.) And she said well thing is if I don't do it Bren I don't want, you know she's bound to sort of say. (.) I said well no cos she probably do  (.) expects you not to bother.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*BRE:	I said just do it and I said thing is if she just ignores you   (.) I said you know not to bother next year.I said just get her a bottle of   (.) you know
*DAV:	Table wine.
*BRE:	One ninety nine Sainsbury's wine.I said just get something cheap, and a card.And she said well you know I thought we'd better.But she said obviously you and Dave asked me, us not to we won't.I said well it's nothing to do with me Pam.
*DAV:	Oh s .
*BRE:	I just couldn't go into it and I said you know   (.) it'll only, I mean the fact is she's, was buying Ellie and Jane   (.) Ellie and Linda.And should she leave Jane out?And I said well she   (.) Jane hasn't done nothing to you really Pam to be honest.I said the argument's between me not you.Well this is what me and Sid said. (.) 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	No.He's at work.
*DAV:	She's starting the old   (        ) ain't she?Can you imagine that?Oh god!
*BRE:	She's having a   (.) I told you she's having a Christmas party now   (.) Sunday straight after Christmas.I said we've got the pantomime on the Saturday.She said well the following Sunday Lee's away so
*DAV:	Does that mean we've gotta go down there?
*BRE:	Well she's having her party so Christmas day is the Wednesday   (.) boxing day is the Thursday   (.) and she   (        ) and she having her party on the Saturday, Sunday.

*BRE:	Are you?Why's that then?
*DAV:	So they might, they might work us.Well they might, it depends how busy they are obviously.So we might be able to swing something that we can work Saturday and Sunday. (.)  (        )  (.) 
*BRE:	Cos there won't be no overtime after Christmas will there?
*DAV:	 (        ) Saturdays.We'll be back to what we usually are won't we?

*DAV:	If I want to but I won't cos I'll be on a hundred and fifty a month anyway. (.)  (        ) 
*BRE:	Cos you've got, what will you have then, two fifty at the moment?
