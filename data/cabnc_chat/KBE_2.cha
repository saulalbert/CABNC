*JUL:	And yet the stores is covered for any erm one who pinches and that. (        ) But then erm they haven't got the guts to   (        ) things. (        )

*JUL:	Although I wouldn't I wouldn't
*WEN:	If my kids was over here I'd have to flog something

*SAL:	Oh I am.
*UNK:	Doing two to ten Friday.
*JUL:	That's tomorrow.

*SAL:	I mean there's seven days in the week isn't there?
*WEN:	I mean I mean how can people afford to do it Bet?I mean  (        ) .I mean to my mind if they're opening on a Sunday they should bring their prices down   (.) because they're opening that extra day they're going to be taking extra revenue.
*BET:	Yeah of course they are.
*MAG:	So they should be made to bring their prices down.That is why they put that freeze on
*BET:	That is why that man said you will not get any more special offers on a Fri Saturday night because they can't sell it on a Sunday so you used to see them selling things off on a Saturday five o'clock.No more.
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAG:	Because they're opening on a Sunday and hoping that you'll go in
*BET:	That's it.
*UNK:	Mm
*MAG:	and buy.
*BET:	So you won't be able to find out nothing  (        ) 
*BET:	You won't forget that.And I reckon they'll carry on down to Christmas.
