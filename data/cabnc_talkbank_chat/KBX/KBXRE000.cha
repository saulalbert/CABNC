*KBXPS00:	Vegetables oranges you get oranges from Israel and Spain you get pasta from Italy you get lentils from Ethiopia did you know that Lentils coming from Ethiopia you get wheat from the States rice from the States ap apples from France tea from India coffee from Brazil and Columbia sugar from the Windward Islands bananas from all over the place you know those are the things that keep us alive no you know whether we one think they are or not but I mean them things are what keeps the economy alive for one it 's also what keeps us personally alive if you do n't know why we take an interest in Third World issues I would say that it 's that we 're dependent on these countries we could produce enough foods for our own needs but we would n't have oranges coffee tea sugar you know cos we ca n't grow them in this country we we really depend on those things to stay alive and for that reason alone we should have some kind of interest if you went to Kenya for example they would be staggered at how little you know about their country given how much they know about yours they know a lot about this country a lot of it is a bit loopy but then what you know about their country is probably a bit off centre as well and you know I hope that this is something that we 're reversing in this section our perceptions of the Third World or the south or whatever we choose to call it colour a lot of the things that we think and do and say and it increases the amount of racism that there is around us all all those kind of things erm and I think that it is really important to look at what a perception is you know for example what 's your perception of this What is it .  2122493_2620353

*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*KBXPS00:	exactly yeah and we can do that with everything we can do that with everything this is my perception and that 's your perception of this thing that I 'm holding in my hand everything that we 've seen have that ability you know we 've got the ability to do that with everything what we need to do sometimes is walk around the issue if you like and look at it from another perspective and and this is what we 're doing with Ethiopia now erm the good section again was looking at images and particularly the fact that a lot of images are very negative and throwing an alternative view the second section we 're looking at news coverage which is very sketchy erm it does n't provide a complete picture at all and this third section well you saw what that 's about there .  2687043_2810023
