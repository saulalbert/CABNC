@Comment:	conversation #180 (Tape 002803)
*DAV:	If you kind of drop down behind the blue if you use the blue first and the bat's up there you gotta go sort of near to it to get behind you're going to rush down to your hoop. •316692_328192•
        Now you've got a much easier shot haven't you? •328462_330422•
*CHR:	Yes •330422_330752•
*DAV:	You can just push blue back over there and and, or if you are not happy about that just a little take up. •331032_339172•
        Bearing in mind that a take up is always a much more accurate shot, specially for beginners. •340482_344652•
        It's just a little tiny tap and you're gonna  •345512_347302•
*CHR:	That's it •347582_347872•
*DAV:	get right about there aren't you? •348012_349092•
*CHR:	Yep. •349092_349232•
        Fine. •349572_349852•
