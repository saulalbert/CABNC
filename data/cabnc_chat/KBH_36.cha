*CAR:	Mhm. •238010_238025•
*CAR:	Though watch the beat there, then we'll be fine, good, let's go on. •238049_238393•
*CAR:	. •_•
*CAR:	Yeah, now, are you going to put an F  you put a four on that, so if you're doing it there, do a four also. •238812_240540•
*CAR:	What on the A you mean? •240540_240955•
*CAR:	, yes on the A. •240955_241051•

*CAR:	, just try it. •243180_243655•
*CAR:	 ((piano music)) ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Then a four. •243655_243856•
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	Good. •243877_244045•
        Yes, now I wouldn't slur those quite so much as I would make that all legato. •244169_245084•
        You try putting a thumb on the A, no do, do this slowly, making the whole thing legato. •245084_246267•
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	The thumb da, da, yes, but, if you're in  it's a cord of G, you'll put a two on the B, final note, and then go up to a five on a G, not a one, it's better  to do that, see if you can try. •246288_248868•
*CAR:	 ((playing piano))
*CAR:	That's it, do you find that difficult? •248868_249483•
*CAR:	No, just awkward. •249483_249630•
*CAR:	If, if, if you can't , if you prefer to put a one there cross it out with a vengeance. •249630_250625•

*CAR:	Take a rubber to it. •250728_250813•
*CAR:	I try to . •250839_251014•
*CAR:	And, it's, it's better roll than keep on using the thumb to get you out of the keyboard  but, if, I don't want it to spoil •251014_251850•
*CAR:	Well I see, if it, if it. •251862_252065•
