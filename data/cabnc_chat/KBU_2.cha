*NON:	Shall I tell you what it is, sometimes 
*DEN:	from everything.
*NON:	I go back from  (        ) , I'm driving over to Brenda's and I'm thinking, (        ) , and I really am, I'm driving along, you know like wha when you're in the car by yourself and everything's turning over in your head

*DEN:	Do you feel like that when you run?
*NON:	Well, well   (.) it must be the same.

*NON:	It was good.Right.Am I telling you 
*DEN:	 ((sigh)) 
*NON:	about this?
*DEN:	Yeah.Sorry.
*NON:	 ((clears throat))  (.) Have I made much sense so far?
*NON:	Yeah.Yeah, but I   (.) the man 
*NON:	Can I 
*NON:	the patient looks   (.) outside in   (.) and carer   (.) looks inside out.
*DEN:	Inside out.
*NON:	Right.And here's, here's his journey right.G P appointment, outpatient appointment, tests, admission, medical treatment, nursing care, (        ) planning and follow-up.
*NON:	And that's the patient from his journey out?
*NON:	That's his journey right?Here, he's looking in   (.) how he came, where is it?
*DEN:	Route.
*NON:	Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
*NON:	But is it the round window, the square window, or the arched window?
*NON:	There's one.Da, da, dee dee dee.Right, it says here, [reading book] quality can only be asse assured  [] ,pa beg your pardon, [reading] if both patient's view, he's looking 
*UNK:	 (        ) in there.
*NON:	Right.
*NON:	in, and the care-givers view looking out are in agreement  [] .Right.
*DEN:	What if they're not?
*NON:	What 
*NON:	To a 
*NON:	is the one that we're actually doing?
*UNK:	Yeah.
*NON:	That's right.
*NON:	 [reading] To achieve this   (.) quality assurance should mean, that when the patient feels his care is not good   (.) he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized, and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately  [] .And that's these things here.There's patient questionnaires, complaints, da da, er   (.) ba la   (.) visitor inspections, complaints, patient questionnaire, there's a   (.) basically all the same kind of thing, or relative survey.Patient questionnaire.So, basically, what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain.My criticism of that being is
*NON:	But what if it's not carried out?
*NON:	it's, it's al the quality's not there to start with.How can you
*NON:	He da he won't know what, what quality of care is though.
*NON:	Well er, the patient has his views about what
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	he expects, good nursing care 
*NON:	But his views aren't really gonna be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know 
*NON:	No, everybody's individual.And to get, what it says here, to get quality assurance, the patient's views, and the care-giver's views have to be in agreement.What, say you're the care-giver and I'm the 
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	patient   (.) what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care.
*NON:	But what you know is not gonna be the same.
*NON:	It has to be the same for quality assurance.
*NON:	But it's not gonna be the same.
*NON:	But that will 
*NON:	Yeah cos you 
*NON:	I tell you what I think
*DEN:	It says on our research thing 
*NON:	say that, say that erm     (.)  [laughing]  (        )  [] .
*UNK:	 ((raspberry)) 
*DEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	Say that  (        ) 
*NON:	Er, say yes to that one.
*DEN:	 ((laugh))  (.) I shan't ask anything.
*NON:	But will it tell me the truth?
*NON:	Well, see, for one is she's not erm   (.) as bad as that.You know, some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them, but it's not.If, you're taking all   (        ) 
*NON:	Yeah.
*DEN:	Mm.
*DEN:	And when he goes into 
*NON:	Plus they also say that a nurse is always 
*NON:	 (        ) 
*NON:	busy   (.) and they're angels, and they're, that and the other, that they won't complain.
*NON:	Well that's the only way that this can be   (.) assessed, is by, so that the patient   (.) blah blah la     (.)  [reading hospital form] when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry  [] .But complaining, I mean, if he's gotta complain it means that   (.) quality assurance isn't there.
*NON:	But
*NON:	This is only thing if they've got something to complain about.
*NON:	if you were the patient   (        ) nurse 
*NON:	So there's nothing to actually say 
*NON:	In a positive sense?
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	The only thing that 
*NON:	So if it 
*NON:	says
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	erm    (.)  [reading] meaning ha blah blah   (.) and action taken  [] .It should also mean that when Mr , that's it, says the nurses were marvellous, the nurses are able to say in all evidence, and with evidence to support their opinion, yes 
*DEN:	We were crap!
*NON:	we are really doing a pretty good job.
*DEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	That's all it says in a positi from a positive angle.
*NON:	Yeah but
*UNK:	A pretty good job.
*NON:	 [laughing] So what do you think  [] ?
*NON:	 ((laugh)) 
*DEN:	But like, if you take like 
*DEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*DEN:	like er,le let me, if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse   (.) like, you wouldn't have a clue   (.) whether it was er
*NON:	Exactly.
*DEN:	good or not, because as long as it was pretty clean.
*NON:	Let's have a look what examples they're using.
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*NON:	Well that's what I was trying to say, because all the patient doesn't know what to expect anyway.
*NON:	I mean, the patient wouldn't know whether it was like clean   (        ) 
*NON:	Well these are the criteria leaves for tests and investigations for tests and investigations, for example good facilities, up-to-date working equipment, nice staff, competent qualified staff
*NON:	Well I'm not nice.
*NON:	written and verbal information, appropriate tests, no complications  [] .But not necessarily the procedure itself.If you, if you were the patient you might say it's wrong because erm   (.) she doesn't look like she knows what she's doing or   (.) there's a mistake or   (.) something gets missed.
*DEN:	Yeah.
*NON:	You know.
*NON:	But I mean, on that, well I think it's   (        ) 
*DEN:	Well I think the whole point of it is 
*NON:	erm, the patient's not gonna know that I'm, first of all, not gonna know anything about nurses, (        )  (        ) 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*NON:	Because he didn't, he stayed cos they class him as an A person.
*NON:	And he might take a personal dislike to one of nurses.
*NON:	Yeah.
*DEN:	They can only evaluate the care that they've had 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DEN:	can't they?At the end of their stay.Whether they, they feel, they feel better and whether that's because the nurses have done a good job or not.
*UNK:	So ideally, er
*DEN:	Nurses can, they can only   (.) they can only   (.) say evaluate a certain proportion of the erm
*NON:	Yeah.
*DEN:	things in question.
*NON:	Well it says for the nurses to   (        ) is to be able to evaluate. [reading hospital form] Waiting list monitoring, outpatient department review, observation, visits   (.) erm   (.) nursing audit, medical audit, care review, qualifications check  [] .
*NON:	Well you see the bit about the waiting 
*NON:	You know it's all very 
*NON:	list right?
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	That's one thing here, will get them in and out, but I've spoken to patients who say they don't get the care here   (.) and, on the surface it looks a brilliant hospital, it gets them in and out, you know, it does everything, it's got all the facilities   (.) but it doesn't give them the care.
*NON:	Mm.I think the biggest 
*DEN:	 (        ) 
*NON:	bogey is, is where 
*NON:	That's right.
*NON:	it says, [reading] quality can only be assured if both patient's view and care-giver's view are in agreement   [] cos that's gonna be really hard to achieve isn't it?
*UNK:	Yeah.
*NON:	Where's it say that?Make sure I've written it down.
*DEN:	Yes, but quality doesn't just co erm, take into account the care that's given, it takes into   (.) erm, what equipment you've got on, whether th er, the equipment's used properly.
*NON:	I mean, but that   (.) that is what I was pointing out   (        ) and we have some, say you have somebody qualified to go and visit each patient 
*DEN:	What the hell's a  (        ) ?
*NON:	 (        ) even just to like   (        ) I feel we're doing the research do you know what I mean?
*UNK:	Mhm.
*NON:	 (        ) 
*NON:	Mm.
*DEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	Yeah.I will say that.
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*NON:	What about yours Neil?
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*NON:	Come on Neily.
*DEN:	Hang on, I've lost my, my work.
*NON:	 (        )  (.) back too soon.
*DEN:	That's wishful thinking.
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DEN:	Wears my out.
*DEN:	I've got my husband's on. ((laugh)) 
*NON:	What?
*DEN:	 [laughing] Socks  [] .
*NON:	Not the same ones as yesterday?
*DEN:	No, I've got about five, no   (.) I've got about four pairs the same.Two pairs of blue and two pairs of red.
*NON:	You mean your husband's got four pairs?
*DEN:	Well   (.) Mm.
*DEN:	Right.My art 
*DEN:	Thirteen centre.
*DEN:	My
*DEN:	Sorry.
*DEN:	my article's about   (.) raising the standards of health care in the hospitals.It's all the same really.And it, it looks upon nurses feel about   (.) their own standard of care   (.) and, the article then goes on about
*DEN:	Standard they provide?
*DEN:	standard they provide for 
*DEN:	Mm.
*DEN:	the patients.And then the it goes on about setting up   (.) the single but dynamic standards   (.) a setting system it's called, divided into   (.) local level groups like a tier system, you get the Managing Director on the top   (.) and the ones at the bottom.And they're called quality assurance, or standard setting teams   (.) made up of volunteers
*DEN:	 ((clears throat)) 
*DEN:	from the local wards.The main base made up of volunteers from the local wards like nurses and   (.) well I mean   (.) nurses and auxiliaries   (.) like that.But it's   (.) bring, it says things about care   (.) and assessing that quality care's being met on their ward and   (.) the hospital itself   (.) and   (.) about once every six months to meet up with
*DEN:	 ((clears throat)) 
*DEN:	other hos members of other hospitals in the area and discuss   (.) different aspects of   (.) raising the standards   (.) of care.
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*DEN:	And the introduction about   (.) about care is passed up the three tiers, like a triangular system's 
*NON:	Mm.
*DEN:	passed up a three tier system.And if the ideas are good   (.) then er incorporated   (.) into the care, they're incorporated into the   (.) hospital's   (.) manifesto if you want, if you like.But there's one   (.) one fault really it takes approximately fifteen to eighteen months for them to pass   (.) anything like that   (.) and that could be one
*DEN:	Downfall.
*DEN:	downfall, one criticism   (.) about
*NON:	Yeah, cos this one says it's immediate.
*DEN:	Yeah.Well this one takes fifteen to eighteen months and that's   (.) to me that's just   (.) ridiculous really.
*DEN:	And then, it would take another   (.) however to implement any changes that they decided upon.
*NON:	Basically they, they just provide the ideas which get passed 
*DEN:	They provide the er 
*NON:	to the top of the ladder
*DEN:	That's it.
*NON:	and then 
*DEN:	And they're the ones in the situation so they get pa they're the ones who are actually on the ward at the bottom and then pass it up.It's like 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*DEN:	being in parliament really, you have to pass everything up.
*DEN:	Well the thing is though people at the top don't necessarily see the problems that you see as problems 
*DEN:	No they don't, no.
*DEN:	as being problems do they?
*DEN:	That's probably why it takes fifteen to eighteen months to get a a result.
*NON:	To get there.
*NON:	It's not gonna help the patient like, at the time, like, at the time if your patient complains, something will be done.
*NON:	What happens there and then?
*NON:	If your patient complained, like, I dunno
*DEN:	Probably be dead by the time
*UNK:	Gone out the window!
*DEN:	Yeah!
*DEN:	What if you've got a loved one?
*NON:	And, and we   (.) sort of no yours doesn't necessarily apply to some people to say, they might just think, oh it'll be 
*DEN:	I know.
*NON:	good idea to
*DEN:	Just   (        ) what you think.
*GRO:	 ((laugh)) 
*DEN:	Yes, by the time it comes to getting round to your complaint you've moved on.
*NON:	Mm mm.
*NON:	It's unbelievable how many they  (        ) .
*DEN:	So is that it basically?
*DEN:	If you want to call an issue but   (.) I was on about setting up these committees   (.) to assess the standard of care.
*NON:	I've got a bit like that, and says the   (.) erm   (.) quality assurance systems will have to be different in each health district, with like being variations.But it says, it has identified key elements, and one of those elements is a Director of Quality Assurance should 
*DEN:	Yeah.
*NON:	be appointed with responsibility for setting up the district-wide programme.She would receive minutes of all meetings and have the right to attend these meetings to provide a quality assurance input.So that's the same
*DEN:	And like I must have got the   (.) er the review board should be   (.) er   (.) six   (.) six requirements for these groups.
*NON:	Mm mm.
*DEN:	They must voluntary to the whole  (        ) .
*NON:	Right.
*DEN:	Erm, there must be more than six people.There must be a meeting once every three or four weeks for one and a half hours.And the meeting should be held in a place where it is possible to work in our situation.And a leader should be appointed.
*NON:	Yeah.
*DEN:	Yeah, but even with all those things in their favour it still takes fifteen months?
*DEN:	It still takes fifteen to eighteen months to deliver   (.) to pass
*DEN:	But the leaders are nearly always someone   (.) like a Director of Nursing or somebody like that, who has no   (.) ward   (.) experience
*NON:	But you need somebody higher up 
*DEN:	on a day to day 
*NON:	to be able to pass these bills doesn't it?To be able to pass the
*NON:	 (        ) , yeah, try to get them to pass it.
*NON:	Right.
*NON:	It cannot be   (        ) get background.
*NON:	Mhm.
*DEN:	Mm.
*NON:	So, the major criticism for that is higher 
*NON:	Is up 
*DEN:	Fifteen 
*NON:	up.
*NON:	high.
*DEN:	to eighteen months.
*UNK:	Lyndsey.
*DEN:	Fifteen months minimum.
*NON:	I think I had it once before.
*UNK:	What?
*NON:	I just   (.) you know, I'm not sure.
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*NON:	I know.
*DEN:	I think so.
*NON:	Well, when you've got five minutes come and knock   (        ) 's door    [laughing]  (        )  [] .
*NON:	Well as long as you know about yours and then when she does direct the question at you   (.) about that particular 
*NON:	Shall I tell you what mine's about?
*DEN:	Well I've told you what mine's about.
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*NON:	Shut up!You're gonna get this too.
*DEN:	Mm mm.
*NON:	It's about a two different   (.) tools.

*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	Whatever you like.
*GRO:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	One's called the monitor   (.) and one's called   (.) called   (.) the system  (        ) .There you are.
*DEN:	That's all we need to know is it?Right.
*NON:	Well you could even call it a system.Somewhere.
*DEN:	Can we go home now?We may as well get cracking with research mightn't we?
*NON:	Well, we're waiting for these lot.
*NON:	Ah!
*NON:	Can we start when the others come back?
*NON:	Sure can.
*DEN:	Can we start now?
*GRO:	 (        )  (        )
