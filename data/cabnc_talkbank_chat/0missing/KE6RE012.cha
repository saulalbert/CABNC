*PS0XD:	Oh the first payments are due But we started late last year did n't we . 
*PS0X8:	Thought we started in June but I got one more to pay So I got I got Friday to pay and that 's ten months . 
*PS0XD:	I of that and I said to to him is that the last one He said well I ai n't heard nothing but . 
*PS0X8:	Well it is for me Definitely I 've got one more . 
*PS0XD:	That 's February 's payment . 
*PS0X8:	That 'll be February 's payment yeah No . 
*PS0XD:	the month so you 'll have to . 
*PS0X8:	No . 
*PS0XD:	March . 
*PS0X8:	It would be March because we started late did n't we Do you remember . 
*PS0XD:	Cos normally normally you finish in February . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah well normally I would of been finished would n't I . 
*PS0XD:	and we used to have March . 
*PS0X8:	I pay it at the end of the previous month so it 's due on the twenty eighth twenty ninth . 
*PS0XD:	We used to start paying the rates in May . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah we did but I had a feeling we were late last year . 
*PS0XD:	So I should think that 's but I reckon we must cos the government changed it it knocked hundred and forty quid off did n't they . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah No I I but I 'm sure I 've got one more to pay but it 'll be the fifteenth of March that 'll be due .

*PS0XD:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	and that 'll be for the next month . 
*PS0XD:	But I said to I said well you might get a free month but I said or you in March and then Ap supposedly April starts again . 
*PS0X8:	Well that depends when they start again dun n it . 
*PS0XD:	Unless they do it less the banker 's orders go start . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0XD:	in May . 
*PS0X8:	Do n't know Sandra But I 'm . 
*PS0XD:	It was just a bit in The Echo cos they 're all about here and . 
*PS0X8:	sure I 've got one more to pay . 
*PS0XD:	Eastleigh is quite high again That 's nearly three hundred . 
*PS0X8:	So 's Welwyn in n it . 
*PS0XD:	Welwyn 's over three hundred . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah I saw that on the well proposed . 
*PS0XD:	Yeah Cos Annette paid a lot when she was then at Chandler 's Ford . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0XD:	very high one . 
*PS0X8:	Ah . 
*PS0XD:	Thanks Gloria . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0XD:	Mind you Marguerite 's was over the three hundred last year when she . 
*PS0X8:	And where was that . 
*PS0XD:	Er it 's funny up round there cos there 's about three different councils well although her address is Hampshire . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0XD:	the postcode is Guildford and you 've got Aldershot or there 's and there 's another one that is three different cou another one . 
*PS0X8:	Mm . 
*PS0XD:	But it was one one of them anyway and hers was over three hundred so save a bit . 
*PS0X8:	Mm . 
*PS0XD:	But once again they have n't worked hers out I mean she told them she was down here in January and she still has n't had a bill yet for the end of this year . 
*PS0X8:	Well all you can do is tell them I mean you 're within the law then it 's up to them in n it You know . 
*PS0XD:	twenty one days do n't you when you move to no she notified the one she 'd left She said I 'm not paying any more up there I 'm moving . 
*PS0X8:	0 . 
*PS0XD:	and notified . 
*PS0XE:	I mean they all ought to be geared up for all this for Christ 's sake . 
*PS0X8:	Mm . 
*PS0XE:	It must be happening every day of the damned week . 
*PS0XD:	Yeah They take so long to sort it . 
*PS0X8:	But I mean it 's like Hugh they said he had n't registered or something was n't it That 's what they said But said to me one day erm . 
*PS0XD:	Yeah but he was n't paying it before was he . 
*PS0X8:	He had n't registered that 's what I was told . 
*PS0XD:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	So when the bit of paper came they just ignore it . 
*PS0XD:	They said he . 
*PS0XE:	Well . 
*PS0XD:	you you have n't paid when he was out at cos you have to notify them that you 're moving . 
*PS0X8:	Mm . 
*PS0XD:	so one council 's got a bit of paper and it ties up with the other one when you come here but if you do n't if you have n't paid before you could n't tell them you were leaving . 
*PS0X8:	0 . 
*PS0XD:	or if he suddenly says here I 'm here . 
*PS0X8:	Mm . 
*PS0XD:	well then the next question is where have you come from . 
*PS0XE:	Mm that 's that 's right yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah but he had n't registered that 's what cos I said to well I do n't really know this sort of thing I said said here that 's first I knew I said now there 's three more of us that know that he 's not paying poll tax . 
*PS0XE:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	then she said yeah he told me all about it she said he had n't registered And I said well if if you 're gon na do this sort of thing you keep your bloody gob shut Do n't you . 
*PS0XE:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	Cos there 's all of us that know now she knows . 
*PS0XE:	Good job he did n't tell me Not that I could do anything but I would n't . 
*PS0XD:	But he did n't register . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0XD:	When they move into that new house though cos I mean the council are aware that the new . 
*PS0XE:	Yeah Well you would think so Sandra . 
*PS0XD:	and services to be connected . 
*PS0XE:	but I mean when you have a erm . 
*PS0XD:	You know the builders might even say we 've sold these two . 
*PS0XE:	when they do n't have erm when you have your election form and that and you send it in do do n't they come round if you have n't sent it back or do they just they used to did n't they . 
*PS0XD:	No They do n't check up . 
*PS0XE:	Well I I know something I erm what was it then what Perhaps it was the erm . 
*PS0XD:	sign those papers because they thought there was a tie-up . 
*PS0XE:	perhaps it was when we had the census paper . 
*PS0XD:	Loads of people . 
*PS0XE:	then was it . 
*PS0XD:	Census paper had to be . 
*PS0XE:	Oh . 
*PS0XD:	done yeah . 
*PS0XE:	Cos they came round then Why ca n't if they do n't get things back why do n't they come round . 
*PS0X8:	They ca n't cos I do n't think there 's enough . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	in this country What I said if it was like . 
*KE6PSUN:	enough people . 
*PS0X8:	No If it was like Germany where everything is is regimented whatever word you wan na use whether you agree with this or whether you do n't everybody in Germany pays everything that they should . 
*KE6PSUN:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	Now if you agree . 
*PS0XE:	Well I suppose that is it you see in this they do n't believe in believe more in freedom do n't they . 
*PS0X8:	Oh yeah . 
*KE6PSUN:	Hiya . 
*PS0XD:	They 've blocked the idea of I D cards have n't they cos . 
*PS0X8:	Mm Yeah Well you see . 
*PS0XE:	Like we had in the war we had an . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0XE:	identity card . 
*PS0X8:	But you see you can say it 's the big brother and all this rubbish but the fact remains that we three are paying the poll tax and he is not . 
*PS0XD:	Mm This is it . 
*PS0X8:	This is how it ends up I mean everything is is well regimented I ca n't think of a better word . 
*PS0XD:	Germany they do it with T V licences . 
*PS0XE:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0XD:	when he went in to hire or buy a television they . 
*PS0X8:	Yes they do Yeah . 
*PS0XD:	had to notify the authorities that so and so has signed up for one So perhaps the house . 
*PS0X8:	Mm . 
*PS0XD:	Well I do n't know but but if they up there . 
*PS0XE:	0 . 
*PS0XD:	and bought a house well then the next question is well where have you come from . 
*PS0X8:	Well of course and this is do n't you feel whether it 's . 
*PS0XD:	So I mean . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah So you and I and Doreen . 
*PS0XE:	let everybody come here do n't we I mean to say law in other countries but they 're always pleased to come here and take all our what 's it are n't they . 
*PS0X8:	This is it immigration to stop . 
*PS0XE:	I mean all the Scottish and the Welsh I always remember when when erm when the first houses when we lived when I lived with me mother and in that house we lived in was a big estate erm near us and erm ever such a lot of Welsh people lived there and I do n't know who it was somebody wanted a place could n't get anywhere and my mother went up there with you let all the Welsh people come here he s she said they run us down and that was years and years ago she said nearly everybody on that estate 's Welsh ourselves . 
*PS0X8:	with Dennis and Marge we 'd been out with Dennis and Marge you know a while back and they 're both Scottish and they run this country down to the . 
*PS0XD:	I know . 
*PS0X8:	and he 's he 's working in there .

*PS0XE:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	and . 
*PS0XE:	And he always seemed to slip into it I expect . 
*PS0X8:	He did Now he 's staying here . 
*PS0XE:	They do do n't they Scottish people . 
*PS0X8:	because of the state of the country or the state of the employment but we 've been out actually out with those two and they put this country down .
