*CHA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Oh isn't it? •619942_620922•
*CHA:	No, it says here, the story of a young wolf. •620922_622842•

        She's gonna, perm the top so she can grow it out. •651372_653622•
        I told you, didn't I say, as soon as she gets it cut she'll be growing it out. •653622_657212•
        Where are you going to get it done? •666932_669032•
*CHA:	Er in  •669032_669152•
*PAU:	they normally cut it well. •669232_671142•
        Bit expensive though. •671142_673112•
*CAR:	Twenty one pounds forty five. •673112_674812•
*PAU:	Just to have it cut and blow dried? •674902_678462•
*CAR:	Regardless of whether it's a restyle or trim. •678462_683392•
*PAU:	Bit expensive. •684332_684842•
*CAR:	That is. •684842_684992•
*PAU:	Mind you, my hair was a lot better when I was having it done . •684992_692352•
*CAR:	I must admit though it looked lovely, I'll say that. •692462_695902•
*PAU:	I only had a trim, but the blow dry made it sort of Do you remember when I got that, my hair cut really short? •695902_702102•
        They did that, and that was, that was really nice. •702102_704342•
        When I look back at the photographs I think  And even when it was long I had, there was one hairdresser there called Paul, whom I'd go and see regularly . •704342_713522•
        I'd go and see him regularly because he did it really well, once he left  •713902_718292•
*CAR:	Well I had one like that, you know when we used to go to that gym up in Chelsea? •718582_725082•
*PAU:	Mind you my regular's back and she charges three pounds. •725282_729812•
*CAR:	six weeks. •731872_732112•
*PAU:	I haven't been since, what  isn't it? •732742_736022•
        Trouble is now, cos I know a hairdresser  the shop, if I go somewhere else, it looks a bit you know and yet I'm not very satisfied with the way he cuts it, he's done it cheap. •736722_751772•
        Mind you, he did Mandy's  at Mandy's, I thought that was quite nice. •751772_766592•
        Have you got a hiccup? •766732_769612•
*CAR:	Caught it off Amy. •774602_776252•
*PAU:	She's gone to sleep now? •776582_779402•
*CAR:	They are aren't they? •779682_782742•
        But he phoned up to order it and said oh my wife likes these soppy things, he bought it, I didn't. •783462_789792•
        It had nothing to do with me. •789792_791432•
        Then he wants me to tape it so he can have it in the car cos it's on C D.  •791432_795292•
*PAU:	Hold your breath. •795292_795852•
        drink some water, concentrate  •800392_811262•
*CAR:	Well, if you want to get rid of hiccups, drink •815982_817992•

*CAR:	stand on your head. •825162_827222•
        Run round the block or something. •827222_833862•
*CHA:	Why can I, er I can't have hiccup? •833942_838472•
*CAR:	Because you don't like them. •838472_840822•
        You keep complaining every time you get hiccups, you say oh I don't like them. •841922_849902•
        I'm trying to help get rid of them, sorry. •850122_853862•
*PAU:	Supposed to work isn't it? •853862_854582•
*CAR:	Once she's gone, once she's gone she's gone. •855052_860412•
        Oh dear, oh we've come to the end. •860532_865502•
        Oy, psst, you are a little fidget. •872642_884182•
*CHA:	Where is Adam and Brian? •884182_885162•
*CAR:	Mm? •886272_886792•
*CHA:	Where is Adam and Brian? •886962_888012•
*CAR:	They're not having a cigar, they're walking round the block. •888012_890632•
        They're not having a cigar. •891632_892762•
        So they keep telling me. •893092_893852•
*PAU:	They've gone out for a walk to have a cigar but as far we're concerned they're not having a cigar. •894842_899442•
*CAR:	They think we're stupid and we don't realize  •900752_903772•
*PAU:	Well, I'm not supposed to tell you but he was smoking on the station when we just caught sight of him. •903802_907512•
*CAR:	Well I'm sure he was. •907512_908542•
*PAU:	I said how am I not supposed to say anything, I said I don't approve why should I keep this quiet? •908652_914512•
        Cos it's not good for you. •915322_916462•
        It's not on. •919572_923682•
*CHA:	 (        ) 
*PAU:	Brian is, because we've been out a couple of times and he does, I mean if we go out he'll smoke then and then he just normally stops. •924662_931112•
*CAR:	Yes, he had one to celebrate, but he didn't just buy one he bought a box. •931722_937862•
        So of course he had to keep smoking them until he'd finished •937992_940402•
*PAU:	Until they'd gone, yes. •940692_943302•
*CAR:	And he told me, well quite soon  quite soon after she came along. •943352_947452•
        I think he actually went for a walk with Brian. •948382_950032•
*PAU:	Oh, I assume he brought  •950232_951092•
*CAR:	No, no, this was the last one. •951122_954142•
        I said, you had the last one two days ago. •954142_956562•
        So the last one of packet number I don't know what. •959082_961162•
*PAU:	Well Brian can stop  terrible now, he's really snoring, god . •961162_966022•
        I've got to the point now, I kick him and tell him to turn over, he turns it over and it's just as bad as before. •967502_975912•
*CAR:	Yeah, yeah. •975912_976722•
*CHA:	I don't want to be married. •976722_979122•
*PAU:	No, don't bother  •979442_979992•
*CAR:	Well at least have separate rooms. •980592_983642•
*PAU:	I wouldn't mind, but it's normally me that goes and sleeps on the settee and I don't see why I should. •983802_990432•
        Well, no the other day he said if I'm really that bad you just tell me and I'll go down and sleep on the sofa. •990432_998152•
        And I went  berserk about two nights later and said for god's sake you're driving me bonkers, go away and sleep on the sofa. •998152_100444•
        He's turned over and started snoring. •100450_100570•
*CAR:	Well he can be lying there sometimes and I'll say, will you roll over please. •100589_100988•
        Mm. •101062_101075•
        Go on then. •101218_101263•
        Mm. •101319_101326•
        Will you please roll over! •101334_101510•
        Or some of the time I've been sitting there in the bed feeding the baby, you know •101530_102301•
*PAU:	Mm. •102373_102387•
*CAR:	and  go shut up! •102387_102561•
        Shut up! •102561_102662•
        It's awful. •102699_102786•
*PAU:	Well, I've found now I do a combination of  what's that stuff, erm,orbathol that seems to help a bit. •102902_103554•
        I don't think it helps him, it helps me calm down and go to sleep. •103577_104023•
*CAR:	Knock out drops. •104083_104196•
*PAU:	put that all over, I keep forgetting to take those herbal tablets, they seem to help with colds or whatever but I haven't got those upstairs at the moment which doesn't help. •104256_105403•
        And then last night I just took my stuff and knocked myself out instead. •105448_105730•
        I don't see why I should have to knock myself out  •105773_105985•
*CAR:	have to be a man unfortunately. •106033_106346•
*PAU:	Trouble is I go into such a deep sleep I can't wake up in the morning if I do, you know, take the herbal stuff, I , I'm flat out in the morning, can't wake up. •106346_107197•
        I think I got up about half past eight this morning. •107232_107484•
*CAR:	Goodness me. •107490_107520•
*PAU:	I had to go to work about nine. •107520_107648•
*CAR:	Oh what are you doing? •107742_108471•
        Oh shut up. •108493_108689•
        Go away. •108702_108718•
*PAU:	And he gets hiccups. •108718_108905•
        He eats too much too quickly. •108905_109484•
        He gets really violent hiccups though, you know, really  , they sound  very, very painful. •109584_110393•
*CAR:	My baby's ones do. •110464_110579•
*PAU:	Mm. •110579_110603•
        You know when it, you can just hear everything going ckkk ooh. •110603_111599•
        Is she awake? •111608_111655•
*CAR:	No. •111655_111662•
        I'll have to put you down some time. •111738_111956•
*PAU:	I felt so sorry for Christine. •111966_112483•
        Do you know she's now, she was quite cuddly, she was fat in the pregnancy when I saw her last time. •112567_113196•
        And in the space of three weeks I think the baby's used up all her  fat because she's now just really, really pregnant. •113251_113859•
        But, not so much her face, but all the top part of her looks slim, almost, you know I mean, she's got no fat left there, on her arms it's all gone. •113921_114772•
        Just a bit left on her legs so the baby must have used up all if the baby carries on like this she'll be anaemic I think. •114885_115683•
*CAR:	When's she due? •115683_115723•
        Did you say? •115802_115866•
*PAU:	Eleventh, so she's got another, almost two, well  two weeks, ten days. •115866_116923•
*CAR:	Mm. •116979_116991•
*PAU:	She said she can't sit down, can't stand up. •117106_117270•
        I was just sitting there for about five minutes then she got up, then she, ooh, sat down, then she got up. •117292_117836•
        I don't think it can be too long. •117839_118493•
*CAR:	Now what about that then? •118493_119069•
        I can't believe how quickly the time's gone. •119098_120397•
*PAU:	Mm. •120397_120403•
*CHA:	Do you want to sit down ? •121323_122540•
*PAU:	broke today. •124411_124442•
*CAR:	Ooh broke? •124442_124473•
*PAU:	I mean I was, one minute I was walking round, I hadn't touched anything another minute it was catching my finger. •124473_125318•
        I looked down to see what was kind of stinging my finger and the ring had snapped and was pinching where it caught my finger. •125318_126388•
*CAR:	I can't get mine off. •126518_126602•
*PAU:	Well I can't wear a wedding ring now, it, just cos it's so wide, it's a really wide one. •126602_127154•
        And if I wear  where I had the eternity ring on and the engagement ring and the wedding ring   •127154_127824•
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*PAU:	it just felt like arthritis, it used to get really painful. •127934_128277•
        So I said oh blow this that's coming off. •128284_128783•
        I suppose I'll have to get another wedding ring. •128819_129530•
        It's fashionable to have a kind of  reason  •129678_129882•
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*PAU:	I don't think so. •130105_130382•
        So I'm feeling less and less married the more rings I keep breaking. •130382_130764•
*CAR:	I can't get my wedding ring off. •130795_130957•
*PAU:	No. •130957_130964•
        Well, my fingers get swelling as well, so I thought it wouldn't do any harm. •130995_131644•
*CHA:	Well I have finished  •132067_132151•
*CAR:	Well they're all up there. •132394_132656•

*CAR:	Well, yeah, if you look, ooh, I can't think where. •133178_133411•
        I think there's a book-rack up there and I think some of them, the patterns are out of the magazine and they're just, in a rack, I think. •133522_134372•
        If you go up there just leave them as they are don't leave them all over the place. •134390_135093•
        put them back. •135176_135487•
*PAU:	Are you making something? •135487_135769•

*CAR:	You want like, like that, floaty? •137876_138453•
*CHA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Like, like these, or, more like jogging pants? •138552_138903•
*CHA:	No, like these. •138913_139061•
*CAR:	Well if you want them to stay pretty as opposed to going baggy then you'll need to have a bit of lycra in the fabric. •139187_140008•
        Keeps the shape better. •140038_140449•
*PAU:	Mandy loves her top. •140644_140865•
*CAR:	Oh, the body? •140865_140915•
        The body? •140915_140950•
*PAU:	Yeah, she was wearing it flat out when she was  •140950_141248•
*CAR:	So you didn't get a look in then? •141365_141491•
*PAU:	Oh no, I was wrestling it off to wash it in the end. •141491_141735•
        She kind of wore it with everything she could think of I think that would go. •141735_142172•
        Mind you, I don't think it's come out of the washing at the moment, I think it's getting water . •142172_142577•
        I haven't seen it recently. •142606_142867•
*CAR:	Quite versatile really. •143038_143147•
*PAU:	Yeah, yes she wore it with a lot of you know trousers and skirts and  The big thing at the moment is a new polo neck that we got from . •143147_144104•
        It's actually ever such a good one. •144104_144370•
        An X Together one, you know Together the label ? •144370_144783•
*CAR:	So  •144794_144807•
*PAU:	Yeah. •144810_144816•
        But you also buy it in, er, Alders, they've got them. •144820_145293•
        . So it's normally quite expensive  and it's, it's lovely material and it comes down to about here. •145293_145961•
        We got it for four pound fifty. •146140_146435•
        Ever so cheap. •146571_146579•
*CAR:	That's  •146647_146700•
*PAU:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Oh, right, yes I've seen it, I've seen it. •146701_147380•
*PAU:	Well ever so often what they do they get the ex catalogue stuff. •147421_147655•
        You know you can get some quite good buys like end of the season. •147692_148133•
*CAR:	Who are they? •148133_148154•
*PAU:	You get the end of season and it's  if you look at the labels and go for the decent labels then you don't get sort of, quite reasonable quality. •148154_149008•
*CAR:	Mm. •149008_149048•
*PAU:	I got quite a few things in there. •149126_149278•
        I'll probably have a stroll round there just to get a tracksuit for, when Michael was   •149321_149614•
*CAR:	childrens' tracksuit. •149627_149891•
*PAU:	I used to, I bought loads and loads in there. •149891_150156•
*CAR:	Joelle? •150158_150200•
        Could you just take the carrycot up and put it on the floor? •150256_150500•
        Just so that it's upstairs, for me. •150591_150718•
*CHA:	On the floor?bedroom floor? •150718_150856•
*CAR:	Well I haven't cleared the cot out, so  •150961_151117•
*CHA:	O K. •151117_151126•
*PAU:	it's funny cos I just  I thought ooh, I'll buy it for her cos  you know she doesn't   •151317_152234•
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*PAU:	four pound fifty I didn't mind. •152246_152413•
        . But it actually really suits her, it's a kind of almost  maroony red, burgundy type red, not quite and er  it's a really good colour. •152442_153335•
        Christine got a load of her pregnancy stuff there. •153625_154927•
        Cos she said I'm not paying a fortune for  stuff that I won't wear afterwards. •154927_155664•
        So she bought   •155664_155703•
*CAR:	Is there maternity clothes then? •155703_155883•
*PAU:	Well, if you look, yeah. •155887_155938•
        Well she got a kind of raincoat, that, I don't think it's supposed to be maternity I think it's just supposed to be  •155938_156615•
*CAR:	Oh yes, cos that was the fashion wasn't it? •156615_156760•
*PAU:	Yeah, yeah. •156777_156835•
        So she's, she's got one there. •156840_156966•
        I think she paid  eight pound for it, and it, it looks  raincoat . •157003_157600•
        And it still fits, it still fits over the hump. •157721_158285•
        But she's huge. •158292_158448•
*CAR:	I really got away with it, you know. •158448_158576•
        I, didn't have a coat right the way through. •158672_158890•
*PAU:	Mm. •158946_158980•
        when it rains, that's all. •158980_159053•
*CAR:	Really lucky. •159053_159178•
*PAU:	she hasn't got a car, or anything. •159178_159312•
        She's •159313_159332•
*CAR:	Oh, dear. •159332_159378•
*PAU:	So she has to walk round  well, Chris sold his car didn't he cos they want to save up and get a house. •159378_160538•
*CAR:	Even through the snow I survived. •160538_160791•
        Very lucky. •160791_160867•
        Cos I refused to go out and buy a coat. •161025_161279•
*PAU:	I used to wear one  •161279_161428•
*CAR:	I had a jumper that my mum knitted that went wrong and ended up twice the size it should have been. •161428_162089•
        But that came in useful. •162089_162221•
*PAU:	Yeah. •162440_162451•
        Well, when Mandy was  when I was pregnant with Mandy I used to wear this old, you know those rabbit skin coats  coney coat what they're called? •162451_163674•
        Fur coat thing. •163674_163700•
*CAR:	Mm. •163700_163710•
*PAU:	Well it was a kind of fur coat but it was rabbit I think, it was. •163710_164132•
        I got one, ooh, well it was really fashionable then so it was quite beautiful sixteen years ago. •164132_164575•
*CAR:	I'd probably know what you mean if I saw it. •164576_164745•
*PAU:	It's just a little jacket kind of thing. •164746_164958•
        So when I was pregnant that would be, that was fine cos it just  •164958_165301•
*CAR:	Sat on top? •165307_165373•
*PAU:	Yeah, sat on top really. •165373_165559•
        And er with Michael I'd gone out in Richard's and bought , ever such a full raincoat when it was in fashion. •165559_166220•
        I still had it in the wardrobe so I just used to . •166352_166558•
        But I still had more room than I needed in that so that was quite useful. •166558_167372•
        Actually Christine  normal size twelve dress that happened to be a full dress. •167461_167840•
*CAR:	Oh, a baggy one. •167871_167998•
*PAU:	And she's, she's quite  it's a kind of cottony, stretchy, you know those ones that you have a V and then they're quite full, like this is full from there? •167999_168732•
*CAR:	Oh, I know, yeah. •168732_168789•
*PAU:	This is like a V. •168789_168919•
        Well the V's just kind of gone up. •168919_169146•
        It actually looked quite nice on her. •169146_169264•
        She didn't look too bad considering. •169304_169463•
*CAR:	I hardly wore any dresses. •169463_169996•
*PAU:	Well she's got, she said she just wears the three, I don't think she likes  like the trousers. •169996_170417•
*CAR:	Oh it's boring, isn't it, being pregnant? •170417_170693•
        Because you don't want to go and buy as many clothes as you would have in your wardrobe normally. •170693_171252•
*PAU:	The killer is when you've got to go out to a special occasion isn't it? •171252_171587•
*CAR:	Yes. •171587_171620•
*PAU:	And you know you've got to   •171627_171711•
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*PAU:	Yeah. •171711_171725•
        I bought this really expensive one, you know I was  can't remember  a wedding or something so I had to buy something. •171876_173220•

*ADA:	I'm keen on trout if it's got a sauce. •178919_179165•
*CAR:	Mm. •179165_179184•
*ADA:	But to be honest I shouldn't be eating that sort of thing anyway, so •179252_179548•
*PAU:	I like it best with almonds, flaked almonds on the top. •179677_180278•
*ADA:	Mm. •180278_180289•
*PAU:	And that's not on my diet either. •180291_180446•

*PAU:	I haven't really lost, in weight I haven't lost any more but it's coming, my body's •182996_183352•
*ADA:	It's shaping you up? •183353_183439•

*ADA:	You look a bit thinner in the face and neck. •183740_183896•
*PAU:	Yeah. •183896_183910•
        I think it's  maybe it's turned to muscle, I don't know. •183910_184336•
*CAR:	Redistributing •184336_184342•
*PAU:	Yeah, yeah. •184342_184440•
        I don't know how to describe it. •184440_184590•
        Cos I'm not actually losing weight, but my clothes all feel, you know I can get into clothes I haven't worn for ages. •184590_185093•
*ADA:	Mm. •185102_185118•
*CAR:	Well Suzy's going to Weightwatchers again. •185126_185311•
*PAU:	Is she? •185340_185461•
*CAR:	She doesn't look like she needs to really. •185461_185771•
*PAU:	She's put on a little bit of weight. •185771_186029•
*CAR:	She has put on a bit, but  •186029_186089•
*ADA:	I tell you what Suzy, Suzy's problem is her rump and her  her •186089_186468•
*PAU:	Yeah her legs. •186468_186519•
*ADA:	and her thighs. •186519_186602•
        That's where she •186602_186748•
*CAR:	Because if you look at the top of her, you you wouldn't think •186748_187098•
*ADA:	No, you wouldn't think she was overweight. •187168_187282•
        Take a picture of her head and shoulders. •187282_187629•
*CAR:	Mm. •187629_187670•
        You'd think she was skinny. •187782_188114•
*ADA:	Mm. •188114_188134•
*CAR:	Well, she went right down to a size ten when she lost all that weight before. •188134_188723•
*ADA:	What is she now? •188749_188874•
*CAR:	Fourteen. •188874_188897•
*ADA:	Blimey. •188911_188933•
*PAU:	Mm. •189188_189216•
        So she has got a problem then. •189216_189563•
*CAR:	It's all round the bottom. •189563_189620•
        Mind you, cycling should help that. •189645_190043•
        She's out cycling here and getting the train in the morning. •190323_190530•
        Keeps her bike in the garage and pops on the train. •190530_190925•
*ADA:	So you don't need a lot of   •190925_191019•
*PAU:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	in the garage. •191019_191150•
*PAU:	No that's right. •191150_191756•
*ADA:	jacket. •192142_192153•
        Mind you, isn't there some restrictions on what you can do with fridges? •192158_192410•
*PAU:	I think you can ask the council to take it away or something or take it to the dump  •192420_192723•
*UNK:	you can take it down the tip, •192723_192872•
*CAR:	They recycle CFC's don't they? •192920_193061•
*PAU:	That's right, yeah. •193061_193176•
*ADA:	Really goes against the grain to see . •193212_193938•
*PAU:	Mm. •193938_193954•
        Well we don't really need another one. •194112_194488•
        We've got a fridge in the  at work, there's one in the kitchen  •194568_194852•
*CAR:	Can't you find   •194852_194901•
*ADA:	Can't you find what? •194901_195037•
*CAR:	or something? •195037_195059•
*PAU:	Well it's difficult, isn't it really? •195071_195366•
        Because it's, it's er under, under worktop   •195366_195581•
*CAR:	Well, if, if they enquire they're only enquiring . •195581_195907•
*PAU:	That's true. •195925_196013•
        Just ask for a fiver. •196013_196089•
        Cos if you say nothing they probably  think there's something wrong  •196104_197796•
*CAR:	not working so they don't want to take it. •197802_198193•
        have to get somebody to take it away. •198193_198347•
*ADA:	Well I think it's going to be a case of phone the council and ask them to  •198347_199453•
*PAU:	Do they take them? •199540_199658•
*ADA:	I don't think I'll get it in the car anyway. •199671_200287•
*PAU:	Who's asleep proper now? •200287_201480•
*CAR:	now isn't she? •201765_202483•
        Pardon? •202487_202498•
*ADA:	She gone? •202498_202524•
*CAR:	I'm not sure. •202558_202751•
*PAU:	Well how much does it cost to get in the cinema ? •202751_203894•
*ADA:	About four quid isn't it. •203894_204005•
*CAR:	Is it? •204005_204030•
        I'll have to buy the tickets occasionally. •204030_204413•
*ADA:	I think it's about three, three seventy five. •204413_204653•
        Something like that. •204653_204701•
*PAU:	Oh, cos Joelle was trying to, trying to work out if she can afford to have her hair done and go to the cinema. •204798_205424•

*UNK:	Fantasia. •206637_206649•
*CAR:	What'd you say? •206906_207047•
*PAU:	We want to go and see that  •207047_207287•
*ADA:	Fantasia's coming out  •207287_207372•
*CAR:	It's a last, last ditch attempt to get some money out of it, is it? •207372_207631•
*ADA:	And what was the other one? •207631_207981•
*UNK:	I was told, wasn't I? •207997_208501•
        Fantasia and  •208501_208525•
*CAR:	It wasn't one we wanted •208565_208700•
*PAU:	Hundred and One Dalmatians? •208700_208772•
*CAR:	No, no, we would have wanted that. •208772_209145•
*UNK:	 (        )

        Yes it was, yeah •209471_209559•
*ADA:	latest one, it made a massive, massive loss apparently. •209559_210003•
*PAU:	I shouldn't bother about it . •210083_210188•
        It's so boring. •210188_210231•
*CAR:	I'd like Fantasia. •210231_210273•
        I'd probably be sad and disappointed. •210273_210654•
        My memory of it would probably be . •210654_210945•
*UNK:	Yeah, of course you saw it as a kid, didn't you? •210945_211360•
*CAR:	fifteen I think. •211365_211402•
