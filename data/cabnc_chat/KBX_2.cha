        For the first time dictionary writers and language researchers will be able to show how words are used in ordinary every day conversation. •29235_37055•

        These will then be transcribed and computered and built into a database which will contain several million words. •51575_59035•
        The case and conversation details will all be completely anonymous, so no one will know who has used the words or whose voice it is on the tape, but together they will provide a permanent record of how the English language was spoken in the nineteen nineties. •59915_77025•
