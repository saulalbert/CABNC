*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	How odd that I should be nine  cents adrift   
*LYN:	 I know. 
*CHR:	in that. 
*LYN:	I know. 
*CHR:	That is really odd isn't it? I agree. 
*LYN:	It's worse being nine thousand out  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Oh absolutely, yes, yes, I been coun   (.) can you be nine cents out, I mean,tha   (.) tha   (.) there's nine of nothing there. ((laugh))  
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Mm. 
*LYN:	 (  ) so I think it's being a good idea to put the   (  ) don't you? 
*CHR:	And, and I suggest total eh C I F C two of above is a  (  ) . 
*LYN:	Well if I put it und   (.) at the end twenty five, four one end B item two four, you know, in other words   (  ) just there. 
*CHR:	Yes. Fine. I   (.) I suggest again you say, dollars, C I F C two   (  )   
*LYN:	 Total, ah, oh yes I will do.  Total of above. 
*CHR:	Total of the above yes, yes that's great. 
*LYN:	 (  ) twenty five items. 
*CHR:	Yes the twenty five items above, yes, good idea. 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*LYN:	where I mucked the whole thing up trying to get the    ((laugh))   
*CHR:	  ((laugh))  And we thought that was a frightfully clever machine when it  first arrived. 
*LYN:	 Yeah.  Who's got a posh H reg B M W? 
*CHR:	Bill, next door, he's d   (.) company d   (.) boss of a plastics company. Yes I agree. He had a perfectly good Audi when he moved here last year, so why in the heck does he need a monster B M W like that then? 
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) Simon actually counting up the cars next door, on the drive, getting  (  ) , by that   (  ) knowledge   (  ) wanted to keep it. 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	And eh, Simon got all the mud all   (  ) and he said you know when I was young, we were ahead of the  (  ) , but now we're well behind    ((laugh))   
*CHR:	  ((laugh))  It   (.) it's up to you son. 
*LYN:	It's because of it that we bought  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yeah. Up to you sonny boy. I know two or three lads of the next generation beyond us who are doing in their twenties rather better than their fathers   ((laugh)) in  their fifties. 
*LYN:	 Yes. 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	 (  ) it's where they put the energy don't they? 
*CHR:	Most of them in banking or accountancy. The thing that   (  ) about Bill is, he does have an amazing amount of labour saving gear, like electric hedge shears trimmers, and erm 
*LYN:	Graham's got that. 
*CHR:	He   (.) he   (.) he's got erm a pump for the erm, hosepipe, so that when he hoses the front or the car he's really got a spurt, yes, yes, he actually  put's the hose in one side and goes sh  shoots it out again. 
*LYN:	  (  )   (  ) long enough. 
*CHR:	Well if you're gonna get the bottom of the garden where you're downhill it's not too bad but when you're coming up here and doing as he was watering the new grass on the front he   (.) he I mean yes he is below it it's the bottom of your storage tank in c   (.) in the attic which counts. 
*LYN:	Doesn't your outside tap come off of me? Cos I'm  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes, oh, you may be right there Lynda  you may be right. 
*LYN:	 I thought   (  ) . 
*CHR:	Now we don't have huge, we   (.) we.. we've turned down our thing so that we don't get the kitchen sink, which is also off the mains, brrrr splattering everywhere, so that could explain why mine isn't as good as it could be, yes you're right  (  ) . 
*LYN:	 (  ) actually quite strong, and I use the hose to rinse, I hose my car on Monday. 
*CHR:	 Yes yes  . I  (.)  
*LYN:	 (  ) I've never done that before and I got drowned. 
*CHR:	I assume you're right Lynda, but quite frankly I don't know. 
*LYN:	I think Graham's got a lot, things like that, we've got electric hedge trimmer, those electric erm chainsaw and rotavator 
*CHR:	Mhm. 
*LYN:	and all things like that for the garden, we've got a lot of, I think the only thing that we really   (  ) is a crunch-you-upper 
*CHR:	Oh really. 
*LYN:	whatever they're called. 
*CHR:	Yes, yes, treader. 
*LYN:	I think he would actually  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Did you come to any conclusion, you looked at the Which Board on that didn't you? 
*LYN:	Yeah, I came to the conclusion I couldn't afford any of it. 
*CHR:	Ah, I thought perhaps you, you anticipated a husband without an arm or something. 
*LYN:	No that   (  ) consideration, I think, you know if he didn't kill himself with a chainsaw he'd probably be alright with the   ((laugh)) shredder. 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	I really thought we was going to end with erm, (  ) , cos he was   (  ) sitting right at the top branch, you know sawing merrily through   (  ) . 
*CHR:	  ((sigh))  With, with an electric, mains electric. 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Oh my god. 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Ooh. 
*LYN:	And we've got a circuit breaker   (  ) touch and go. 
*CHR:	Yes, yes. 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Thank god he's got a circuit breaker. 
*LYN:	And I quite expected to erm, to one of the branches to bend, quite a height. 
*CHR:	Mm. 
*LYN:	And the chainsaw's very heavy. 
*CHR:	Yes.
