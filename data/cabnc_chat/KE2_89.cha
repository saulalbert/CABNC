*TER:	Yes but you're never gonna get that, I mean that's  (.)

*TER:	Fifty, sixty
*MAR:	I've got sixty.
*TER:	So there's no, that's no point.
*MAR:	No point.
*TER:	It's really only a question of whether you get the extra one page or, or leave it as it is.
*MAR:	I'll leave it as it is I think because
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	the teabags don't mean anything to us
*TER:	No.
*MAR:	and   (.) and I have got
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	I mean it would be just as well to buy another   (.) thing of coffee because at the moment you get that extra little erm
*TER:	One anyway.
*MAR:	jar for any, any, free anyway.
*TER:	Yeah.Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	So   (.) well we could go out there anyway    (.)  (        ) to see whether they've got any er   (.) you see if they carried it on for another month
*TER:	That would be different.
*MAR:	but it was only for February.
