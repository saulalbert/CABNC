*BRE:	and that's it. •156699_156814•
*JEA:	I think I've done a quarter of it •156828_157008•
*BRE:	I  •157008_157015•
*JEA:	I'd dithered, and I'd got tired and I'd gone off and been  •157015_157421•
*BRE:	Think oh well I come back I can't  . •157522_157832•
*JEA:	That's right do it again, oh I have another go at it. •157840_158034•
        Oh I could have spent the whole week, I just, I just, I could of spent five afternoons in Ipswich, would of done or Norwich  •158034_158813•
*BRE:	Mm, I think I would of done cos I, I work at the, cos a couple of weeks ago I thought I'd go, I'll make an effort, I thought •158813_159354•
*JEA:	I think it makes a very big difference knowing that the  •159391_159595•
*BRE:	Yeah   •159629_159646•
*JEA:	without having to think too hard. •159749_159897•
*BRE:	and you still you make sure you, I mean, you know, all, that what I've spent •159897_160624•
*JEA:	Oh it was well   •160624_160765•
*BRE:	It's got everybody. •160773_160861•
*JEA:	Yeah, its within your budget and you've done well, I went over budget, but then I expected I would, because for one thing I was buying for more. •160879_161601•
*BRE:	Yeah, cos you had, you, I mean none of us realised you had thirty to odd to buy  •161711_162022•
*JEA:	No . •162022_162033•
*BRE:	I don't think you really realised really did you? •162033_162232•
*JEA:	I didn't, but I remember when you said that, that last year when I counted up  •162232_162552•
*BRE:	Its fifty odd , I think fifty three  •162552_162768•
*JEA:	With the er , erm, was it  years before that I've had something like forty or thirty five  •162832_163230•
*BRE:	Yep  •163232_163241•
*JEA:	in, what you might call quite years  •163317_163475•
*BRE:	But those, some of those calendars in Smith with two pounds off were lovely •163475_164180•
*JEA:	Mm. •164199_164205•
*BRE:	and the ones we saw at Marks and all that, were nothing were they? •164205_164562•
*JEA:	Well it pays to tramp around  you see the problem with Jackie and Len has always been that they cannot believe that you can get things in a place like W H Smith that will, that will do very nicely as a Christmas present, they tend to go  •164562_166054•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	always to the top of the •166065_166192•
*BRE:	Well it doesn't pay just,queue up doing anything  •166318_166540•
*JEA:	You know, they, they  yes, yes  they go to the Madechie shops and Athena or whatever and there looking at the best, and you can't afford it   See Maryann and Richard are given up on erm buying Christmas presents because she says  your buying things for people they don't really want, everybody , therefore I think tokeny things are the best, and that's what I've bought this year. •166540_170199•
*BRE:	And is that what you  •170209_170275•
*JEA:	Tokeny things  •170275_170315•
*BRE:	is that what she's doing? •170315_170402•
*JEA:	there buying disposable presents, like giving theatre vouchers and erm I don't know what else, but she said disposable's things that people can have some fun with  •170402_171266•
*BRE:	Good idea isn't it ? •171289_171959•
*JEA:	Mm  and what I'm giving is just something nice in the spirit of Christmas, but it hasn't broken my bank or my back  •172162_172844•
*BRE:	Thing is the  how these people go week after week after week looking  for a bargain, I mean,, I mean we picked up some bargains today, but how you can go week, I mean its ok, yes, why your  but when your Christmas shopping you can't   •172852_174784•
*JEA:	No , no you can't  •174806_174922•
*BRE:	Because its just so, I mean that C & A it was the same as the  it was  •174922_175258•
*JEA:	Mm, mm, mm  •175258_175277•
*BRE:	it so claustrophobic •175277_175373•
*JEA:	yeah  •175373_175402•
*BRE:	look at this traffic coming in now   I think the way we did it, we marked down the three shops we wanted to do •175402_176968•
*JEA:	Mm •177006_177015•
*BRE:	and you make, we just do those three shops  •177015_177231•
*JEA:	Yes , yes  I don't think that on our next buy, what with the  next year I would be a bit better off in the sense that I should have sold my house, bought something cheaper and have some capital invested so I have a little extra monthly income, I should be living in somewhere that's cheaper to run •177231_183554•
*BRE:	You don't know, you might end up with this  chap your with. •183648_184048•
*JEA:	Oh I wouldn't marry him , I wouldn't marry anybody Brenda  •184048_184279•
*BRE:	No, but you might live with him  •184307_184403•
*JEA:	Don't know  •184432_184701•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	don't know  don't know  •184701_184776•
*BRE:	and then yes you can buy a smaller house even more so then. •184776_185287•
*JEA:	Well I would I, I mean I kept to keep my own  •185287_185519•
*BRE:	But  •185691_185700•
*JEA:	whatever your , your  in it, and look after it, yes, erm  well I don't think I'll ever again buy expensive Christmas presents in the way that I did in the past. •185717_186987•
*BRE:	No. •187097_187103•
*JEA:	Spending forty and fifty pounds ahead on  •187112_187307•

*JEA:	Yes , no I can't erm, I can't think of myself as doing that again. •187504_187696•
*BRE:	I agree, its, its like those  their lovely little things, don't think of buying, it's not very fair cos I mean,, I mean I'd be over the moon if someone bought me one of those bags. •187696_188576•
*JEA:	Yeah. •188594_188604•
*BRE:	You know, but, people don't, they think oh know there only one twenty five and they can't buy someone that •188612_189094•
*JEA:	Mm. •189094_189100•

*JEA:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	Doesn't listen to a word I say, like, the women's no good   cos I told  some things about  which would really made yet more of his hair fall of the top of his bald head, I said  I said look, a working women needs a working man to help support herself and her children, I said, er no, nobody is going to be able these days, a woman not going to be able to support herself on twenty hours a week, which is what Karen does, putting out bread in the Asda. •219570_222670•
*BRE:	Is she the original one then? •222681_222873•
*JEA:	She's the original one •222874_222997•
*BRE:	She's not the one that was coming round with the baby? •222998_223210•
*JEA:	no, it was Michelle that was coming round with the baby •223210_223450•
*BRE:	right •223450_223457•
*JEA:	and I found two pairs of Michelle's knickers after that, I didn't know what  , now I don't know how they manage this year  because, she was coming round in the day with little Donna with her and I was around, there you are, you see, these, they, they will love and find a way, anyway, erm, I said dear look, a woman needs a man to support her I said  mark my words when the chap that she's got at the moment is taken her out to disco's and things, she'll find that he doesn't really want to kick in and help to support her. •223457_226959•
        I said she, she might well come back to you I said she's tried to keep you on a string  just in case she didn't land the next dish  he looked horrified, you know, as far as he's concerned its all love and glamour. •226959_228485•
*BRE:	How come she took him back then, they didn't want ? •228653_229039•
*JEA:	Well I think that she was trying to keep him dangling so that she had somebody to fall back on if she didn't land another man. •229039_229809•
*BRE:	He wasn't  •229879_229908•
*JEA:	Why she's landed  •229908_229964•
*BRE:	was she playing around with another man   •229964_230126•
*JEA:	She is now , she is now yes, she's now carrying on. •230126_230557•
*BRE:	What did he do? •230557_230720•
*JEA:	Erm his sleeping  she's told him that she's got this other man •230740_231138•
*BRE:	Cos I can remember him saying before he used to drive round to spy •231138_231472•
*JEA:	Yes, well there is another man and she's told Paul frankly she's lapping up the attention, he's taking her out for meals and their having a good time together you know, why its great, but as soon as he's paid for, for the goods and got, got the goods, the chaps going to go off looking for another. •231472_233365•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	yes, he doesn't want to stay with her, but I've told Paul that if he goes back to Karen and  take some of his things out, then he takes all of his things out and himself and he never comes back •233365_234578•
*BRE:	Just er, he can't keep on  •234578_234641•
*JEA:	I've had this twice and each time its been, its been other people, because his got a lot of goods  people's belongings out of one cupboard into another and the second time round there's been purgatory because he brought Karen's house, her hoover and the saucepans and everything that was his, everything that belonged to him  but he said that before, I said why was Michelle able to jumped in between him and Karen, he said well Karen had been getting moody, and he said Karen was getting bored, Paul is boring, she's told Paul that his boring   boring. •234642_239420•
*BRE:	No, cos I could imagine Paul sort of being quite a homely chap •239420_240062•
*JEA:	He is. •240062_240095•
*BRE:	if he gets the right sort of  •240095_240291•
*JEA:	he is  •240291_240319•
*BRE:	if someone that could put up with his sort of quite reservation •240319_240689•

*BRE:	he is, that's it •241153_241223•
*JEA:	yes, but he is not erm a playboy, he's not going to spend money on  like Pete  was forever buying Pam  cheap jewellery from Ratners and rubbish from that nature. •241305_242916•
*BRE:	Did he ever get back with her? •242916_243216•
*JEA:	Well, she tells me that she is going to throw Shaun out because Shaun is boring, er, Don put her, Shaun she has no respect for she says because he hasn't got a job, he won't get a job, he won't work, and she said to Lee what did I think of the idea of taking Pete back, once they were properly divorced take Pete back just as a lover and I said that sounds to me to be a very good idea, I said then your not at his mercy because anybody who's at Pete's mercy will suffer, his got a very nasty streak, his got a nasty snide way of putting things. •243216_247125•
*BRE:	Has he? •247125_247192•
*JEA:	Oh yes, nasty. •247202_247313•
*BRE:	But his, he, is he, he's quite fond of her isn't he? •247313_247631•
*JEA:	Oh he adores her, oh yes he wants her back, and I said, she said, I, you see, I know him, I said there's a lot to be said for a chap that you know inside , know his ways and know how to cope with them, but I said never ever put yourself at his mercy, I'm marrying him, and the house will be hers, you see, when there properly divorced it'll be in her name so if he starts coming the old soldier, she can bung him out. •247631_250483•
*BRE:	Did she bail herself out in the end with over her money situation? •250483_250826•
*JEA:	Well I, I went guarantor for that. •250832_251001•
*BRE:	Oh you hate, did you have to pay the money, cos you had •251001_251192•
*JEA:	No, no she managed, I told her on pain of death not to tell Pete that I was backing •251192_251727•
*BRE:	Mm •251736_251757•
*JEA:	erm cos otherwise he would of sat back and said oh Jean  can pay that. •251772_252090•
*BRE:	that's right. •252091_252223•
*JEA:	But she knew that in the last resort if he did  I would do it, but he's, he's paid off now  as soon as he'd paid off he went on the dole again  •252223_253384•
*BRE:	I don't think quite  •253648_253809•
