*MAR:	Oh I thought it was me making all that noise. •552592_553852•
        I was breathing and I could hear sort of I was thinking first of all it was coming from, you know  somewhere outside like somebody •553852_564592•
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	sawing a tree or something. •565132_566412•
        Widening the road here or something. •588772_604692•
*TER:	Yes, just widening it and straightening out some of the bends. •604952_607832•
*MAR:	cos that was a bend there wasn't it, obviously. •607862_639152•
*TER:	Mm. •639152_639212•
*MAR:	Gosh the valley goes really far down there. •639262_654502•
*TER:	Yeah it is deep down isn't it? •654502_655862•
*MAR:	one or two houses, you know, when I caught sight of it first  I don't see them now. •663742_676292•
        He must have been fishing. •684742_705412•
*TER:	Looks like it doesn't it? •706282_707242•
*MAR:	He's got a big keeper net there. •709172_714982•
        Was the disabled toilet alright? •753022_754862•
*TER:	Yeah   •755242_755552•
*MAR:	Nice little waterfall things. •759692_764882•
*TER:	Yes, a weir. •764992_765982•
*MAR:	It's good to have those on the ground, you know, for people who are   gosh  who are you know incapacitated. •765982_790932•
        But sometimes people think well they're only for disabled but  I don't believe that's so •792122_797152•
*TER:	No I don't think it is either. •797152_798492•
*MAR:	because I think to myself well  you know  if there are no disabled people about, and more often than not  there are not  why shouldn't anybody use them? •798722_816082•
*TER:	That's it. •816322_818182•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Yeah •819742_819982•

*MAR:	through it. •918282_918602•
*TER:	that's right. •918602_919062•
*MAR:	had to take a sort of erm   south to  erm  not   just thought of both the names   and the other one  but they would be nearer to Exeter  but it wouldn't be sort of in Exeter itself  I was thinking, you know, probably get erm  you know, see if there's any new houses being built there and  what sort of price and what have you. •949272_995832•
*TER:	Yeah. •996092_996272•
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*TER:	I'm not quite sure where you mean. •100016_100268•
*MAR:	Well it's sort of on its way to Exeter. •100374_100573•
        Chudleigh •100583_100608•
*TER:	Chudleigh  •100873_100917•
*MAR:	Mm we haven't been through this way for a long time have we? •100917_105521•
*TER:	No we haven't. •105525_105616•
        I could certainly do with a drink. •105860_106483•
*MAR:	Could you? •106547_106577•
*TER:	Mm. •106577_106583•
*MAR:	Well I suppose it's not far to go home for a  well it'd be nice if we saw somewhere that was nice. •106606_107579•
        Or do you know somewhere? •108112_108201•
*TER:	No I don't know anywhere, no. •108201_108316•
*MAR:	The   The Olde Lion, don't think we'll go there. •108590_112678•
        open for lunch and dinner. •112681_112788•
        The Coach •113658_113681•
*TER:	The Coach House  •113681_113755•
*MAR:	House  Funnily enough I was  going to say to you  when we were out at erm Dartington instead of buying that ice cream, we should of had a cup of tea  probably would of been about the same price, and so  •114604_117281•
*TER:	Yeah. •117348_117358•
*MAR:	Probably the tea would of been better for us. •117690_117891•
        Small development, that must, that must be down there somewhere. •118725_118956•
        But you see practically anywhere here would be within Christopher's  •119010_119417•
*TER:	Yeah •119548_119579•
*MAR:	erm  you know, distance into  Exeter. •119613_120151•

*TER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Yeah  he lives in erm  in, in   •120812_121166•
*TER:	No it's warehouse units going up there, I thought it was gonna be housing, more houses. •121337_121992•
*MAR:	Oh there there is new housing, you know, there's more  •122028_122267•
*TER:	Mm. •122288_122294•
*MAR:	development er back there, that's what made me think of it. •122294_122542•
        They wouldn't want to be near warehousing units of course but erm  there's a lot of new building going on and with so much competition  Thinking of Imelda for a job, I mean  there's, there's loads of places here as well for her    Exeter Hospital   you know the   Torbay. •122878_128918•
        Somebody mind you was  on about Torbay this morning on the  radio I think it was  saying that there were so many complaints and nurses are under such great stress. •128918_130243•
        And    I was very naughty I, I  felt like saying well some of their, they, them aren't  er do you remember the very last time we were up in the hospital at the waiting area, there was those two nurses that walked up and down  •130243_131420•

*MAR:	about five times doing nothing. •131432_131605•
*TER:	That's right. •131757_131800•
*MAR:	So really and truly I mean it's not all nurses that are so stressed. •132048_132916•
        I'm sure there are some who are  you know, are in a bad way and they're having to do other things that they shouldn't be doing. •133073_134085•
        But this is the trouble with everybody these days isn't it? •134236_134559•
*TER:	Yeah. •134559_134575•
*MAR:	Everybody just wants to do what they should be doing whereas  with my job it never even thought about it did we? •134928_135603•
*TER:	No, no. •135603_135663•
*MAR:	Tell you what erm when we get into  you can just drop me down to  the greengrocer near the church because I'm out of erm  spring onions and if I wanted to  add up to that bit of salad that we've got •135663_140020•

        Got double lines coming up  that's funny  stuck there like that  •146692_147969•
*TER:	Well I didn't sort of notice what it was. •148395_148575•
