*PS096:	erm I think it ca n't be bad for you because you do quite a lot of the same exercise as you 'd do in proper aerobics . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS096:	but you 're in the water the whole time . 
*PS090:	I do n't even know what proper aerobics are anyhow . 
*PS096:	Oh you just keep moving the whole time Running on the spot and waving your arms about . 
*PS090:	Just seem to keep moving all the time without even running on the spot . 
*PS096:	Yeah well this is this is you know it 's very difficult to run in the water . 
*PS090:	I know it is . 
*PS096:	cos it keeps getting round your feet and sort of . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS096:	making you drop over . 
*PS090:	Yeah . 
*PS096:	And I suppose developing the muscles that keep you from dropping over it 's pro ca n't be ca n't be a bad thing . 
*PS090:	I suppose it ca n't no I . 
*PS096:	And then you do other exercises like lying on your back putting your feet your from the knees downwards over the edge of the pool and then trying to do sit ups . 
*PS090:	Good heavens . 
*PS096:	0 . 
*PS090:	I 'm too old for any of that . 
*PS08Y:	But Noel is n't exercise against resistance is supposed to have some special benefit is n't it . 
*PS090:	Well I 'm doing that all the time I 'm doing it with you my love . 
*PS096:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	Oh come off it . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS096:	Erm I do n't know I I I I I just feel that this is that sort of exercise where er . 
*PS08Y:	Ooh sorry . 
*PS096:	it only lasts an hour it 's not going to do any harm . 
*PS08Y:	No I 'm sure it is n't . 
*PS096:	it 's erm a good thing to be doing . 
*PS08Y:	Because swimming 's . 
*PS090:	I think something that does do harm is jogging . 
*PS096:	Yeah well . 
*PS08Y:	Well yes that 's a beast . 
*PS096:	I I did a little jog this morning with the dogs cos it was too cold to walk . 
*PS090:	Oh . 
*PS08Y:	Ah yes . 
*PS096:	And I 've got another one this afternoon I think . 
*PS090:	Have you ever been in the sauna at er Woodbridge . 
*PS096:	No I have n't . 
*PS090:	Er er no I have n't either Er I one went into one at Iceland that was it was lovely . 
*PS096:	I 've been in a sauna in London I belong to a health club there . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	I used to play squash . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	That 's a violent one is n't it squash . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	I I ca n't think that really violent exercise is a good thing generally is it Something that 's more measured . 
*PS096:	Oh I do n't think I do n't think it hurts when you 're young I think when you 're older you should only do it if you 've done warming up first . 
*PS08Y:	I think so too probably and you 've been used to it That let's us off is n't it nice . 
*PS096:	I think the warming up exercises in themselves are a good thing though . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	even if you do n't do anything after . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	after warming up . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS096:	The class I go to on Monday evenings erm we do warming up exercises and I 'd be quite happy if they just stayed warming up exercises for the whole hour . 
*PS08Y:	Yes Have you got someone properly qualified taking them . 
*PS096:	Yes she 's very good . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS090:	I went to a sauna in Iceland . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS090:	and then was able to straight in in the hotel it was . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS090:	straight up in the lift to my bedroom and it was lovely you know yeah in the hot in the swimming pa pool . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS090:	or through the shower then in the swimming pool then back again and when I 'd finished with it I went straight upstairs to my room and I went to sleep straight away it was lovely . 
*PS08Y:	I was waiting for him to say he went out and rolled in the snow because that 's the proper end is n't it . 
*PS096:	Mm and you should beat yourself with twigs as well . 
*KC0PSUG:	0 . 
*PS090:	I 'm not I do n't know really about that . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS090:	Oh you should definitely do that I mean . 
*PS08Y:	That borders on the nasty I think . 
*PS090:	They had a there was a sort of electric burner in the place as a whole . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS090:	where they kept on throwing on . 
*PS096:	Water to . 
*PS090:	water with some erm sort of fir smelling in it . 
*PS096:	Oh yes it made steam . 
*PS090:	Mm Fine mm . 
*PS08Y:	That 's it I should apologize for canned soup but I spent so long talking to Stanley this morning . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	you know sometimes you can just tell he wants you to talk to him and erm so I er could n't make a proper soup sorry but this is . 
*PS096:	I think . 
*PS08Y:	good actually I think . 
*PS096:	Yes which is it Is it Heinz . 
*PS08Y:	Heinz tomato . 
*PS096:	I I made some stock the other day . 
*PS090:	Mhm . 
*PS096:	and I put some of it in the freezer . 
*PS08Y:	Yes ideal . 
*PS096:	in erm sort of bowls . 
*PS08Y:	What did you use for your stock . 
*PS096:	Some bones . 
*PS08Y:	And . 
*PS096:	Oh some onions and . 
*PS08Y:	Carrot . 
*PS096:	carrot yes . 
*PS08Y:	Celery That gives a lovely flavour . 
*PS096:	I do n't think I had any celery I had I had put in whatever I had in the house and sort of various herbs and spices and things . 
*PS090:	Did you put the bones in the stock before or after the dogs had had them . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS096:	During . 
*KC0PSUG:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	During . 
*PS096:	The dogs went into it instead . 
*PS08Y:	Think what a luscious stock the dogs would make . 
*PS096:	No they would n't . 
*PS08Y:	Mhm . 
*PS096:	Erm . 
*PS08Y:	All that hair Yuk . 
*PS096:	erm no what happened was that he gave me some bones that were far too big for the dogs So I made stock out of those . 
*PS08Y:	Where they gorgeous marrow bones That . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	Oh yes they make wonderful stock do n't they . 
*PS096:	Mm Well normally when he gives marrow bones I ask him to chop them up a bit smaller . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	but he gave them to me practically . 
*PS090:	Mm He 's an obliging chap is n't he . 
*PS08Y:	Mm I always feel that when he 's giving because he gives them to one does n't charge for any . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	er anything for the bones one can hardly say erm give that another whack across the knuckle because . 
*PS090:	He would n't . 
*PS08Y:	the big knuckle has so much locked inside . 
*PS090:	He would n't mind . 
*PS08Y:	it does n't it . 
*PS096:	I do . 
*PS08Y:	Do you . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	I should really . 
*PS090:	He would n't mind . 
*PS08Y:	I ought to have courage . 
*PS096:	He charges high enough prices for his other things . 
*PS08Y:	Yes he you 're right mhm . 
*PS096:	Erm when you do your stock do you first of all roast the bone . 
*PS08Y:	No but that is erm er a counsel of perfection or something is n't it It it 's a method anyway . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Erm do you . 
*PS096:	No Well I did n't because I just could n't be bothered to put the oven on to get as hot as that for such short period of time . 
*PS08Y:	What in fact does it do . 
*PS096:	Oh I should think it erm melts out the marrow and does all sorts of quite good things for it It probably gives it a good colour too . 
*PS08Y:	It gives it colour erm I 'm sure because of the of the fact that they 're roasted There 's one thing that erm I sometimes do to give it colour is once I 've taken off the outside skin of the onion the very outside . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	I put the next one in . 
*PS096:	Mm Does that that gives it colour does it . 
*PS08Y:	I read that somewhere mm . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	But roasting them I would n't like to get them with any sort of burnt taste . 
*PS096:	Well I do n't think it would give a burnt taste but I think I think it probably could do quite a lot of good for it . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	Er I just read it in er I was reading Delia . 
*PS08Y:	Mm yes Oh yes she 's good And she tells you to do that does she . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	It 's the matter of the moment really you just fling them into a roasting tin do n't you and put it in the oven And that 's alright if you 've got a Rayburn but otherwise you have to start . 
*PS096:	Yes start from scratch . 
*PS08Y:	heating it up mm . 
*PS096:	Now when I was away staying with my cousins . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	he is a G P in High Wycombe and he 's a fundholder . 
*PS08Y:	Oh good tell me about it . 
*PS096:	Well he 's also been on hundreds of committees because they were sort of one of the early ones to be done . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	and they have a battery of sort of board members drawn from here there and everywhere including a fair quantity of redundanted service people . 
*PS08Y:	Oh . 
*PS096:	They had an S A S officer running running them . 
*PS08Y:	Is that to get you ri to get rid of the patients he did n't want . 
*PS096:	No it was to get rid of the Health Service He he he said that at one point this chap had used the phrase that well that they were going for controlled destabilization from the Health Service . 
*PS090:	Controlled what . 
*PS096:	Destabilization . 
*PS090:	Oh . 
*PS08Y:	The S A S man was . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Why . 
*PS096:	That 's what the aim of the people doing it was . 
*PS08Y:	You mean the official government line . 
*PS096:	Mm or that 's what they er or maybe that was his interpretation of it anyway this was a phrase that came out in in the actual meetings And then he told me a hilarious story about the way in which the chairman of the committee I 'm not sure quite what particular branch in the world he 'd come from but he was looking at the figures I suppose it was an accountant looking at the the figures saying now why is it that the amount spent on district nurses has gone up So he was told petrol has gone up He said yes but you now have your health centre and the district nurses work from there So erm they all looked at him you know the district nurses so John said to this man what there are some of our patients who are housebound . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS096:	and some of them as well as being housebound maybe are n't very well and are bedbound . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	and the district nurses visit them in their homes He had to explain it to this man . 
*PS090:	Good god . 
*PS08Y:	Where did he fund this committee from one has to ask immediately . 
*PS096:	he 's not given his committee it 's wished on him The local authority . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS096:	the local authority creates the committee . 
*PS08Y:	But I I had no idea that he then had to be that being given his own funding he then had to be organized by a committee Oh that 's outrageous . 
*PS090:	Local council . 
*PS096:	I think it must have been some sort of . 
*PS090:	Yeah . 
*PS096:	thing like that I do n't know . 
*PS08Y:	Well it does n't seem sensible I thought it was the G Ps getting control I mean this is what 's going to happen to the detriment of the health service right through . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	administration by people who do n't know what it 's all about . 
*PS096:	That 's right . 
*PS090:	what has happened to a lot of these hospitals has n't it . 
*PS096:	Well it seems to be still going on What do you make of this idea of building a new hospital at Norwich with fewer beds I ca n't understand it because if they 've got fewer beds why do n't they they just hide a few of the beds they 've got already . 
*PS090:	Absolutely . 
*PS096:	Mm why do they have to have a green field site and start again . 
*PS08Y:	Is it because they 're going to incorporate a lot of high tech treatments . 
*PS096:	I think so yes . 
*PS08Y:	Mm and you see erm it is a fact that they need fewer hospital beds nowadays because . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	the the hospital stays are dramatically shorter than they were . 
*PS096:	Mm yes but we 're coming up to a time when er the quantity of old people is going to be rather high than before because we 're all healthier . 
*PS090:	Mm Mm . 
*PS08Y:	They 'll have something special for them like concentration camps . 
*PS096:	I know Th they 've got those in Ipswich already have n't they That 's what they 've made the old Anglesey Road hospital into . 
*PS08Y:	Is that so . 
*PS096:	Mm something like that . 
*PS08Y:	I wonder how it really goes I wonder . 
*PS096:	I do n't know Erm well it 's . 
*PS08Y:	Oh this is disappointing because I thought that with G P who 'll knows what he requires and what his patients require was going to have erm a pretty er erm . 
*PS096:	Well you ca n't leave a G P to spend the money like he likes you 've got to have a committee for it You think about it . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	You you know . 
*PS090:	Ah . 
*PS08Y:	Ah . 
*PS096:	Yes anyway have you heard about how they do the costing Will was telling me about it how how how they . 
*PS08Y:	Oh do tell me because I . 
*PS096:	how they cost erm something like a tonsillectomy . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	And how do they . 
*PS096:	Well apparently they count the procedures that are involved in doing it . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	erm they have a price per procedure . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS096:	and they tot it up . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	But they have n't got it quantified to such a point where they can actually distinguish a tonsillectomy which might have a lot of procedures but actually takes about half a minute with er other things that are you know much much more complicated and the cost of tonsillectomies is unreasonably high compared with erm you know with . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	Really . 
*PS096:	Mm They have n't they have n't got the pricing right And I can understand them not having the pricing right I do n't think they 've spent long enough working out what the prices of things are . 
*PS08Y:	They 've dearly gone on for years not knowing let alone tonsillectomies what . 
*PS096:	Yes they did n't . 
*PS08Y:	these wretched erm . 
*PS096:	they did n't know . 
*PS08Y:	transplants costs . 
*PS096:	they did n't know what they cost but equally being asked to budget against not knowing what things cost . 
*PS090:	Mm mm . 
*PS096:	is er equally stupid . 
*PS08Y:	Yes it is Because er er ya absol . 
*PS096:	But then but then the er the whole thing gets knocked for six anyway because of general unpredictableness of of of illness . 
*PS08Y:	Well it does I suppose It does . 
*PS096:	You can you can apply statistics to it a bit but it 's very unlikely the statis st statistics and what really happens will always add up in fact They they 've suddenly had a few outbreaks of polio have n't they . 
*PS08Y:	Oh have they . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	I did n't hear that I say . 
*PS096:	Mhm Yep They 've had the odd child who has n't been erm whatnotted and some various . 
*PS08Y:	Ah . 
*PS096:	various men seem to have caught it from changing their nappies . 
*PS08Y:	Yes I did hear of that I 'm sorry I was n't relating it to erm to polio . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Erm . 
*PS096:	Well you know you 've only got to get maybe smallpox back again and that will knock all their predictions for six . 
*PS08Y:	Erm . 
*PS096:	They say they 've wiped smallpox off the face of the earth . 
*PS08Y:	Yes they do you see That 's the doubtful one is n't it because it 's gone It 's supposed to be completely gone . 
*PS096:	Yeah but do they do they inoculate children against it at all . 
*PS08Y:	No I do n't think no I do n't think we have smallpox inoculation er of of children do we . 
*PS096:	Do n't know we I mean we used to . 
*PS08Y:	Because they say it 's it 's it 's gone completely Erm sorry love we need a fork for that Perhaps the meat fork from the shop would do nicely No er er erm it 's all in the cutting of course it is very no that 's pork and Noel dare n't touch it so I 've got two slices so that you and I could have one . 
*PS096:	That 's very nice thank you . 
*PS08Y:	And Noel will have the other Erm . 
*PS096:	I have n't had any pork for ages . 
*PS08Y:	it 's so new to them that they 're bothering to cost it but how did we go on in the older days I 'm trying to think Did we know anything about what our operations were costing I ca n't remember . 
*PS096:	Well if y you if if you go to a bupa hospital you go pa you pay a sort of erm you know related type of . 
*PS08Y:	Yes a figure that 's been around that anyway yes . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Ya . 
*PS096:	But I do n't know . 
*PS08Y:	I 'm just having that to start with I think . 
*PS096:	erm I do I do n't I mean I do n't know how accurate it is or whether it 's sort of you know a set of figures they decided to put on . 
*PS08Y:	It would n't relate to what it costs . 
*PS096:	to keep to keep to keep their profits going . 
*PS08Y:	Yes that 's right . 
*PS096:	Well it probably does relate . 
*PS08Y:	That 's what it that 'll be it . 
*PS096:	it probably does relate pretty well . 
*PS08Y:	I bet it does n't relate to an actual operation in a general hospital because you 've got so many people wanting their rake off in a private one surely I mean have n't you . 
*PS096:	Yes Yes . 
*PS08Y:	That erm . 
*PS096:	Yes their profit . 
*PS08Y:	Ya that 's right . 
*PS090:	rather tired bit fed up with private medicine at the moment . 
*PS08Y:	Oh because of Richard I 'm convinced that . 
*PS090:	Richard . 
*PS08Y:	you know Richard er er . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Had he gone to a National Health hospital . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	with the request to have that back thing done for him . 
*PS096:	Mhm . 
*PS08Y:	I 'm convinced that at the age of seventy eight people do they would have said do n't bother . 
*PS096:	Yes I 'm sure they would have done . 
*PS08Y:	Ya And er would have erm perceived that he was n't greatly hampered by it but once you 've got a surgeon who is going to get a fat fee he did say to him are you sure you want this done . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	but Richard was sure he wanted it done and nothing came between him and that intention And you see he 's it 's going to finish him He 's not going to get better . 
*PS096:	No Erm but did he tol tell you that the surgeon asked him if he really wanted it done . 
*PS08Y:	Oh yes it 's known that he did . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	He said er you 're sure because it was quite a thought for a man his age . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	But I think a surgeon in a National Health would have said look here I do not recommend this . 
*PS096:	Yeah but then the first thing he would have done would have been got up and gone off and got it done privately . 
*PS08Y:	That is the danger He would So er the end was I suppose always connectable . 
*PS096:	Ya If that 's if that 's what private will do for you . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	I mean I think I had n't realized that they would make different decisions on medical grounds . 
*PS08Y:	Mm they will it 's more permissive if you 're in the private sector I 'm sure of that It does n't come so hea heavily loaded with advice against things . 
*PS096:	What because it 's all too good for the moneybags . 
*PS08Y:	Yes it 's it 's I suppose human nature to want to pursue your craft wherever you can . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	But erm but it 's been a very bad thing for him . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	But you see they 've had computers in hospitals now for years . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	and are are employing and paying people to work them but they do n't ever seem to come to any let's say reportable conclusion about the cost of operations I think if we knew what those heart and lung transplants cost people would be up in arms that the National Health Service is being expected to fund that . 
*PS096:	Mm Well y they 're a little bit like nuclear electricity in terms of erm the expensive end are n't they . 
*PS090:	Mm Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Yes I suppose that 's so I wish the government could really tellingly er do down these dreadful lies and scandal erm scaremongering things that the Labour opposition is putting forward I mean they do n't honestly care two hoots about people if they can talk about the dreadful state the the care of old people is in and all the rest of it and that it 's going to get worse frightening old people That 's not caring for the community at all That 's just erm politicking is n't it . 
*PS096:	Yes I can think of nothing worse than Kinnock coming into power . 
*PS08Y:	Oh Imagine how people like erm erm Helmut Kohl and . 
*PS090:	Cook . 
*PS08Y:	Not Cook . 
*PS090:	Oh . 
*PS08Y:	because he 's in his own party I mean Cook yes well he 's a snidey little thing I 'm talking about the erm ambassadors and the politicians the ministers who would be . 
*PS090:	Oh yes oh lord yes . 
*PS08Y:	you know opposing him . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	They 'd just they 'd just run over him absolutely whilst he was grinning One ca n't see him in an ambassadorial role at all can one . 
*PS096:	No . 
*PS08Y:	It may not come to it . 
*PS096:	But this recession is quite a problem . 
*PS08Y:	Oh it must be . 
*PS090:	It 's a worldwide thing though . 
*PS096:	Mm Yes but the trouble about it is that the English are so insular that lots of them do n't do n't realize it or wo n't believe it . 
*PS090:	No . 
*PS08Y:	That 's true They they regard that as an excuse . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Have some more chutney it was given to us by our German daughter-in-law . 
*PS096:	Oh . 
*PS08Y:	So it will be perfect . 
*PS096:	Did she make it herself . 
*PS08Y:	She did . 
*PS096:	Goodness . 
*PS08Y:	It was our Christmas present was n't it . 
*PS090:	I forget what it was was it her present . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Well has it been nice not having to go to France . 
*PS096:	Mm Except of having to go to London instead . 
*PS08Y:	Mm I could n't tell how many people would agree with you about that one that London could be at least a bit preferable to Paris . 
*PS096:	Well Helen 's a bit like you she she sort of perks up when she starts to smell the petrol fumes . 
*PS090:	Mm Ya . 
*PS096:	And she said she had a lovely time She went to an exhibition she went for a browsing sort of shop She said the shops were empty . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Shopping is much more comfortable now .

*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS090:	Why is it you do n't buy it then . 
*PS08Y:	Well because it 's darkish in colour and I 'd rather promised myself that if I have anything new now it 'll be of a brighter colour . 
*PS090:	Oh well go and buy the thing before somebody else does go up this afternoon . 
*PS08Y:	Dearest I 'm saying it 's a dark colour . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS096:	Yeah but you could wear it with you could wear bright things with it . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	Shush do n't . 
*PS090:	0 .

*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	It 's got your name written on it . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS090:	Why do n't you go up and buy the thing . 
*PS08Y:	No I 'll phone her and ask her if she 's got it in red . 
*PS096:	0 . 
*PS090:	You can pinch a bit more of my er . 
*PS096:	Like the telephone woman . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	Like the telephone woman . 
*PS08Y:	Oh er is n't she oh is n't she super . 
*PS096:	I do n't like the advertisements they 're doing for the telephone now though . 
*PS08Y:	Which are they . 
*PS096:	Oh they have this silly man who picks up the telephone in a he 's er got a chef 's hat on and he says Giovanni 's and then it was it turns out to be one of his old friends so he lapses into sort of Glaswegian . 
*PS08Y:	Oh no . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	I have n't heard that one Oh but Maureen erm er what 's she called Maureen Lipman yes . 
*PS090:	Lipman Lipman . 
*PS08Y:	is very good on those is n't she . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	She 's the right sort Erm the thing that I feel I could n't go to see her in is erm Hello Joyce . 
*PS096:	Yes that Joyce Grenfell thing . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	A bit of it was on the television . 
*PS08Y:	Yes I saw that bit and it was n't good . 
*PS096:	No . 
*PS08Y:	because sh Joyce Grenfell was such a lady it came through And and wh and er Maureen Lipman is much more earthy . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	and that came through and it was no good If you 've seen Joyce Grenfell you you could n't . 
*PS090:	Funny thing to put . 
*PS096:	No . 
*PS090:	a Jewess to to try to represent Joyce Grenfell anyhow is n't it . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	Yes in a way except she well you could do it could be done Did you feel that about her on television . 
*PS096:	Well I felt I just did n't know what it was but it lacked the sort of charm that it had before . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Completely Almost thought when she when it was when it was erm er mentioned in the first place that she was going to do it . 
*PS096:	Mhm . 
*PS08Y:	I almost thought ooh you know I 'd love to write and say oh do n't do n't Joyce Grenfell was such a lady You could n't say that to her cos she did n't it would be insulting but in fact that 's the big difference . 
*PS096:	Mm Talking of things like this you know er some people have postcards with their name on in black across the top . 
*PS08Y:	Oh yes they do Yes that 's right they do . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	Well er all sorts of funny people like have them like erm Iris has has them . 
*PS08Y:	Oh does she . 
*PS090:	And does Jane . 
*PS096:	Yes Yes she has them . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	my aunt has them my father used to have them . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	and so I 've always associated them with sort of erm you know what people had before all those sticky labels came . 
*PS08Y:	Mm yes People who did things properly . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	Well when I was in the London office one chap who is an east end Jew made good his name is Ralph erm suddenly gasped and said gosh is n't this wonderful So I sort of was called to look at it and I said oh yes all the people I know who have got those are over seventy . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	And was it one of his own . 
*PS096:	No no someone had sent it to him . 
*PS08Y:	Somebody had sent to him . 
*PS096:	And he he thought that it was such a touch of class about it . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	And I expect he 's gone away to get them printed now . 
*PS08Y:	Oh probably . 
*PS096:	because I s I said I said . 
*PS08Y:	How funny . 
*PS096:	I said well they 're just what people had before the sticky labels . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS096:	And he dragged out his sticky labels which which had got blue stripes on them . 
*PS08Y:	No . 
*PS096:	Yes I thought . 
*PS08Y:	No . 
*PS096:	that was n't terribly elegant but anyway his blue labels had got these little sticky labels had got blue stripes on them . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS096:	top and bottom . 
*PS08Y:	Oh how funny . 
*PS096:	Erm and so I guess he 's gone away to get some made . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	And I said and of course to do it really properly you also have envelopes so that if you want to you can stick stick the card in an envelope that will . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS096:	fit it Cos that 's what we used to have . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Oh yes it would n't go naked through the post would it . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS096:	Well you can yes you ca n't . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	you know you could use it for quick notes . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	to drop on people 's doorsteps . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS096:	or or . 
*PS08Y:	Which is useful . 
*PS096:	Yes Or if you just want to sort of signify a a quick thank you to someone . 
*PS08Y:	Mm yes . 
*PS096:	Or a quick come . 
*PS08Y:	Yes I had n't thought about that . 
*PS090:	Mm mm . 
*PS096:	they 're they are very useful I 've often thought of having some made . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	because in fact every time I get one from someone else I always think why have n't I gone and got some of those yet . 
*PS08Y:	I know why because you 're not seventy . 
*PS096:	That 's right give me another twenty years . 
*PS090:	We had those envelopes er and the cards for our concerts . 
*PS08Y:	Well they were probably erm invitation to a concert . 
*PS090:	Yeah but they were all fixed up to go into the same envelope sort of thing . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	Oh yes you ca n't ca n't use them though . 
*PS090:	No . 
*PS08Y:	Got too much detail of where we lived and erm you know that it was a concert . 
*PS096:	But but these you know you had your telephone number and you know just had a whole statement of everything about you . 
*PS08Y:	Mm mm . 
*PS096:	And . 
*PS08Y:	And all you needed was the brief message that you had to send . 
*PS096:	Yes And it saved you hav it saved you having to do the preliminary thing of saying dear whoever you are . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	Of course that 's right That 's right . 
*PS096:	which was sometimes quite a difficult thing to do . 
*PS08Y:	Well on a personal card you 're not supposed to put dear anybody are you so . 
*PS096:	I know but . 
*PS08Y:	that does make it difficult . 
*PS096:	No it made it very easy You know especially when perhaps you were having a mixed sort of meeting . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	wh I remember that when I was at home it was a mixed sort of meeting in which some of the people from the village were coming who you did n't really know but they had to be asked . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Mm Yes . 
*PS096:	well you I mean you you could cover er cover the whole thing could n't you . 
*PS090:	Mm mm . 
*PS08Y:	Without saying dear so and so . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS096:	And without really having to sign it You could just put your initial in the corner . 
*PS08Y:	Of course 0 . 
*PS090:	Mm that 's right it . 
*PS08Y:	Are they called gentle . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	cards . 
*PS096:	Something like that yes . 
*PS08Y:	safe distance cards . 
*PS096:	I must go and get some made . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	indeed . 
*PS096:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	Oh gosh Have you used any of these erm things called Post It . 
*PS096:	Oh yes they they use them a lot at work . 
*PS08Y:	Th but they 're useful . 
*PS090:	What are they . 
*PS08Y:	Well er they 're er like your autumn leaves that you used to leave on everybody 's benches . 
*PS090:	Oh did I . 
*PS08Y:	erm but they 've got a sticky bit on them . 
*PS090:	Oh I know yes . 
*PS08Y:	and so you you 'd have stuck it on the bench you see erm and it comes off anything without making a mark on . 
*PS090:	Oh yes we 've got a little pack of them in London I think on the by the telephone . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	That 's right some teeny weeny ones . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Folly gave them to you . 
*PS090:	They they they used to call them my autumn leaves er . 
*PS08Y:	erm Patsy and more . 
*PS090:	Oh have some more . 
*PS08Y:	an another piece of ham do . 
*PS090:	have some more ham or you 're getting some nice cheese in a minute . 
*PS08Y:	Oh cheese . 
*PS096:	are we having some cheese . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS096:	Well I think I 'll wait for some cheese . 
*PS090:	Mm Ye yes I used to leave notes . 
*PS096:	I 'm I 'm tr I 'm tr I 'm trying not to overeat you see . 
*PS090:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	Right Please yourself . 
*PS096:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS090:	I 'm trying to avoid being noticed if I overeat . 
*PS08Y:	You 're trying to you 're trying to avoid being starved all the time are n't you darling . 
*PS096:	You 're allowed to have some water are n't you . 
*PS090:	No no no no no . 
*PS08Y:	It 's difficult for you but he 's trying to avoid being starved Will that plate do . 
*PS096:	It 'll be fine . 
*PS08Y:	dish you out a larger one . 
*PS096:	No no it will be absolutely fine thank you . 
*PS08Y:	Okay Well help yourself I can recommend cheese . 
*PS090:	Well autumn leave is the best way out of of of er communicating If I were to turn to a man on a bench . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS090:	and say to him so and so and so and so he 'd always answer back and say I want to do it this way . 
*PS096:	Mhm . 
*PS090:	and er the time was wasted but you give an autumn leaf a little note saying what it what you what you wanted done there was n't much chance he could argue . 
*PS096:	Yes I heard a very interesting conversation on the way down here in that programme Just a Minute . 
*PS08Y:	Oh . 
*PS096:	you know the one I mean . 
*PS08Y:	I hate it but I 'll tell you why in a minute . 
*PS096:	Mm mm . 
*PS08Y:	Go on . 
*PS096:	Well I do n't like it very much but it has this very interesting discussion as to whether a fax was cheaper or more expensive than the telephone . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	and the biggest pro for a fax that I can think of is that you can send the message and that 's that there 's no risk of it dribbling on into into doubt . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	As it would on the telephone yes . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	How right Mm . 
*PS096:	So I thought that was quite interesting to think . 
*PS090:	Mm and they ca n't argue with a fax . 
*PS096:	think about . 
*PS08Y:	I hate that programme because I like I tend to come and listen to the content of what they 're saying . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	and they 're only saying it for the sake of keeping going . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	And then er so it 's never it 's never worth serious attention is it . 
*PS096:	Well just occasionally it is Sometimes you do get something interesting And and and and then . 
*PS08Y:	0 . 
*PS096:	and then they get interrupted and you wish you know you wish they had n't . 
*PS08Y:	That 's it you see that 's full of frustration . 
*PS096:	Yes it 's . 
*PS08Y:	for me . 
*PS096:	I do n't like it I I prefer things like the news quiz . 
*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	or even that one about that game with Mornington Crescent in it . 
*PS08Y:	Mornington Crescent . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	I 've heard that phrase used but I do n't know what it 's for . 
*PS096:	Oh well it 's it 's where they say say a sequence of underground station names or or locations . 
*PS08Y:	Oh . 
*PS096:	in London in in a sort of clever way that makes it sound as though there 's some terrific good reasoning for it . 
*PS08Y:	Oh . 
*PS096:	and they just say it totally randomly and the last one just the first pers person who says Mornington Crescent is the winner but they 've made a great big sort of fiction as to how why when it is suitable to say Mornington Crescent . 
*PS08Y:	You have to come to it . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	I yes I see . 
*PS096:	Th there 's no logic to it at all but they play it on . 
*PS08Y:	How extraordinary I 've not heard that one Mhm . 
*PS096:	It 's a programme where they also sing the songs of one tune wh to another tune . 
*PS08Y:	Oh you mean the programme where they do that . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Erm well that 's not that 's not My Music is it . 
*PS096:	No . 
*PS08Y:	No Erm . 
*PS096:	That 's erm . 
*PS08Y:	ca n't remember what it 's called . 
*PS096:	Mm it 's Jazz With Humphrey Littleton . 
*PS08Y:	Oh I I 'm I 'm not with you on that one because erm I 'm sure I 'm vaguely at the back of my mind I think I know what it is I have heard of it I mean . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	or heard it . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	but I ca n't bring it to mind it wo n't come to the front as it were . 
*PS096:	Well I ca n't remember what it 's called . 
*PS08Y:	Erm yes apart from My Music I ca n't think of one I heard a very amusing thing on the radio this morning . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	came in half way through it at least half way erm but it was so obviously the voice of erm Freud Clement Freud . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	talking and he was telling about a visit he had paid to China for a whole week . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	and how he 'd seen prison and er they 'd said they had n't any prisons but he found one and erm hospitals and all that sort of thing and at the end of the week 's visit erm one of the very high ups whom he named and I 've forgotten the name of him I think I 'll just use that thank you erm sent for h he he was brought before him as it were and the man said to him are there any questions er at the end of your week that you want to ask and he said well perhaps there is one he said erm Winston Churchill was here erm a month or two a few months ago . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	and he also he like me stayed in the and he named the hotel in . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	Peking he said can you tell me why his room was larger than mine . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	and his room had three windows erm and I mine only had two . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	he said in spite of the fact that I 've been in parliament for longer than he has which surprised me cos I would n't have thought so this is the young Winston Churchill of course so the Chinese man said to him erm oh well the reason for that was that he had a famous grandfather . 
*PS096:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	and so Clement Freud said not to him but now on this programme this morning that 's the first time I 've ever been de-grandfathered . 
*KC0PSUG:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	That was rather nice was n't it . 
*PS096:	Presumably his grandfather was Sigmund Freud was it . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	The Chinese did n't know . 
*PS096:	No I should n't think the Chinese have got much time for that sort of approach to life . 
*PS08Y:	I do n't think they have either I do n't think they 'd have been impressed even if he 'd told them . 
*PS096:	No Erm did you see that th they 're they 're going to look for some sort of gene called the Churchill factor . 
*PS08Y:	No . 
*PS096:	Well they want to find out why it is that someone who smoked so much and drank so much . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS090:	0 . 
*PS096:	had to live so long . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS096:	Well it 's obvious It 's the same sort of factor that allows anybody who smokes a lot to not get cancer and not get bronchitis and live also live a long time There are plenty of them . 
*PS08Y:	Well that 's true . 
*PS096:	I it 's just a question of you know something in your make-up that is inoculating you and other people have a weakness . 
*PS08Y:	Well that 's right Other people go down with it You ca n't really I should think find a gene surely that 's . 
*PS096:	There must be something though Enid . 
*PS08Y:	Mm there must be . 
*PS090:	His father was a very weak man was n't he . 
*PS096:	Yes . 
*PS090:	His mother was a character but . 
*PS08Y:	She was not nice . 
*PS090:	Not nice but she had a strong character . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS090:	But his . 
*PS08Y:	This reminds me . 
*PS096:	Mm . 
*PS08Y:	might I just say this darling cos I 've just remembered I 'll forget senile you see Erm we have a video of the last programme of the Churchill series . 
*PS096:	Mm .

*PS096:	0 . 
*PS08Y:	was working .

*PS08Y:	I was going I 'm getting round to that you see are n't I . 
*PS096:	Mhm . 
*PS08Y:	Erm we feel rather badly about not returning it to this person who made it for us .

*PS090:	Mm . 
*PS096:	Well come and see it on mine .
