*PS0V5:	Yeah .  2039313_2039413
*PS0V4:	And they it was a bit frightening because we were in a group of seventeen and see what I mean when I mean how it starts is like if were starting with me I have to say I 'm Tony right and then you would say I 'm Jackie and this is Tony and then Christine would say I 'm Christine this is Jackie this is Tony I was at the end of a group of seventeen and I had heard it sort of you hear it it builds up round the room .  2041683_2079673

*PS0V6:	Daddy .  2100663_2100883
*PS0V4:	And so I had to sort of go round the room and say I 'm Tony and this is and go all round and I got round the room .  2101803_2110443
*PS0V5:	0 . 
*PS0V4:	Yeah .  2112193_2112563
*PS0V5:	So you did quite well .  2112793_2114493
*PS0V4:	But I was surprised that I got round the room cos I 'm awful at remembering names I think I 'm gon na have to try and .  2115153_2130083
*PS0V6:	Dad do we have to we have to come up with a name .  2130083_2136753

*PS0V4:	Mm .  2155763_2156033
*PS0V6:	0 . 
*PS0V4:	Erm but we had a that was that was quite good but I must there 's a trick to remembering names and that is that you use it all the time so any time if you want to remember somebodys name every time you see them you say hello and there name .  2157783_2178533
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  2178873_2179023
