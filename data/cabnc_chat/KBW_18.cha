*TIM:	That's  (        ) !

*DOR:	Good   (.) and then you went fe , worse again in the afternoon didn't you?
*TIM:	It's not in the guitar   (.) oh! (.)  (        )  (.) over here.
*DOR:	I think we'll just have a nice quiet day today   (.) erm   (.) there's a little bit of a snag because I don't quite know what we're going to do about all these children that like to go to the library. (.) We usually have them all in the car. ((playing guitar))
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TIM:	Where's my plectrum now?
*DOR:	I don't know where your plectrum is, I expect it's on the floor somewhere waiting for my hoover to get it!
*TIM:	No! (.) I want it for my guitar!
*DOR:	Well it's alright I'll keep my eyes open and if I see it I'll pick it up.
*TIM:	No, I want to spin it. (.) Have to remind me cos

*TIM:	And   (.) I haven't.
*DOR:	You haven't, right well go and do yours then, then we'll know it's done.
*TIM:	He   (.) he hasn't.
*DOR:	Yes he has, he's just been up there to do them cos he thought he might be going to school   (.) now he's decided he's not so we'll put the school clothes away again. (.) It's all very tricky to know isn't it?Whether to go or not. (.) It's   (.) and it's a bit of a   (.) an exhausting day if you don't feel too well.
*CHR:	Mum why did you   (.) bring some more clothes?
*DOR:	I didn't 
*TIM:	Whoops!
