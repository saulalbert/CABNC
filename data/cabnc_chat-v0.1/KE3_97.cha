*TON:	Yeah. •262472_262652•
*JAC:	You can have too much of a good thing. •262982_265862•
*TON:	Or a bad thing as the case may be. •267182_268712•
*JAC:	Yeah. •269252_269342•
        I've been listening to it  for a while. •270392_276742•
*TON:	Mhm. •276902_277262•

*TON:	Yeah okay. •297372_297592•
*JAC:	So •299052_299132•

*JAC:	I'm not that brokenhearted and I'm, no I'm annoyed. •300372_302422•
        Does the standing order form say what day of the month it's to be taken out on? •305402_310942•
        Do you have to fill that in? •311922_313702•
        On the such and such day of the month innit? •313952_316722•
*TON:	Don't think it does. •316822_321242•
        Cos I filled it all out and I don't remember having to  if there had been anything like that I'd have asked you about it. •322882_330372•
*JAC:	No I'm fed up with them. •330372_331332•
        This is twice now they've done this to us. •332112_335812•
*TON:	Yeah. •335972_336052•
*JAC:	You know. •336052_336202•

        Well I'll go in and see them and sort it out. •337012_340002•

*JAC:	we can write an extra cheque. •351382_352622•
*TON:	Yeah. •353112_353402•
*JAC:	You know? •354232_354632•
*TON:	That's right. •356272_356832•
*JAC:	But I'd rather if you didn't mind that you did go in and sort it out cos she said  well put a cheque in the envelope with the standing order form but I mean •357722_365772•
*TON:	No. •365772_365972•
*JAC:	That's just  they've already  putting it frankly cocked it up once. •367772_371342•
*TON:	Yeah. •371762_372042•
*JAC:	Another opportunity for them to do it again. •372092_374012•
*TON:	That's right. •374392_374882•
*JAC:	What cheque! •376882_377752•
*TON:	Yeah. •379512_379792•
        I didn't see a cheque! •381942_383302•
*JAC:	There wasn't a , just a standing order form, that's all we got. •384072_387012•
        You know? •387722_388092•
*TON:	Yeah. •388262_388462•
*JAC:	Cheque number blah blah blah  written on •388752_391722•
*TON:	Yeah. •391862_391982•
*JAC:	It doesn't make any difference, it's just  you know  hassle. •392442_397532•
*TON:	Yeah. •397532_397592•
*JAC:	This skirt is horrible. •399532_405272•
        I was keeping it for cleaning the car. •406432_416432•
        And I'm having to resort to •416432_418692•
*TON:	Oh. •418762_418792•
*JAC:	some paint splashes . •420022_431582•
        I'm looking forward to our tour round the chocolate factory next Wednesday. •454442_457722•
*TON:	Yeah it'll be nice. •458232_459022•
*JAC:	Be interesting. •459022_460062•
*TON:	Next Wednesday? •460212_461012•
*JAC:	Yeah. •461172_461272•
        Erm  •461272_461332•
*TON:	Right. •462442_462782•
*JAC:	We'll go out and see Auntie Bettie before then. •463592_465412•
        So •466132_466192•
*TON:	Mm. •467492_467552•
        I'm not in class next Wednesday. •467552_469102•
*JAC:	Oh great. •469102_469482•
        The only fly in the ointment is if it starts at seven, it's going to be a bit of a rush. •471192_475532•
        Cos you don't usually get home until ten to six. •476252_477772•
*TON:	No. •478982_479162•
*JAC:	And after all the fuss that's been going on in work I don't really like to ask to go early. •480372_485022•
*TON:	No. •485162_485382•
*JAC:	If you see what I mean. •485742_487862•
*TON:	Mhm. •487972_488302•
*JAC:	But. •497842_497952•
*TON:	I got two Helens in the group. •505182_511572•
*JAC:	Oh that's nice. •512542_513152•
        Helen, yes yes . •513462_514402•
*TON:	Luckily they've sat themselves on opposite sides of the room. •516842_519252•
*JAC:	Oh that's good. •519922_520562•
        So you look at one. •520592_521532•
*TON:	Yeah. •521942_522212•
        So I can look at one and say Helen? •522472_523792•
*JAC:	When they sit together you've got problems. •526672_528272•
*TON:	Yeah! •528272_528612•
        Fine. •530982_531212•
*JAC:	Er. •531962_532352•
