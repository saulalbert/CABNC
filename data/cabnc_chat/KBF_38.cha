*DAV:	And he's going to have a chat with erm  one of the blokes tomorrow and he's   tomorrow afternoon  but he's  he's cured the water. •127662_128822•
*BRE:	The blockage? •128965_129009•
*DAV:	Well he's he  there's a couple of a little boxes up there, little electronic boxes •129091_129419•
*BRE:	Mm. •129465_129471•
*DAV:	and they do it  electrically  or you can do it manually and he's turned them round manually  and now the water's coming out normal  put them back to how they were •129471_130365•
*BRE:	Mm. •130388_130395•
*DAV:	so he said perhaps that it there was a fault in there  it's cured itself. •130411_130807•
*BRE:	Mm. •130807_130813•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •130883_130899•
*BRE:	You  •130899_130910•
*DAV:	He was  •130910_130930•
*BRE:	would never have known that would you? •130945_131077•
*DAV:	No  but he's said  •131077_131149•
*JEA:	No. •131149_131158•
*DAV:	those er  he said, there's something going down the pipes, I said no  cos that pipe there, you can put your finger where that pipe is now and the water's flying out. •131158_132004•
*BRE:	Is it? •132004_132016•
*DAV:	So  it weren't nothing blocking that up. •132016_132186•
*JEA:	Mm. •132304_132319•
*BRE:	But what so  it does he think something from the cos it keep coming on and off? •132319_132711•
*DAV:	Well he don't know cos he don't know how those, figure out how they work. •132800_133016•
*BRE:	It's always coming on and off though innit? •133017_133324•
*DAV:	Well I don't know, I never stood and listened to it. •133324_133512•
*BRE:	Yeah it's always  yet if you run a tap now  turn the hot tap on that'll come on  •133518_134030•
*DAV:	You haven't got  •134030_134077•
*BRE:	again? •134077_134085•
*DAV:	you haven't got any hot water at the moment that's why I said  that should  well I would have thought he did it  but you got no hot water then that should keep going until the water stops. •134085_134901•
*BRE:	No it doesn't  you run the top tap now  in the kitchen, turn it off  that will ignite and come on  go and try it. •134901_135936•
*DAV:	Yeah but you  the thermostat on your tank is telling  should be telling that that you've got a cold tank  that's what thermostat's for. •135936_136696•
*BRE:	Well no because it'll  it doesn't work like that it takes about  cos it's cold it's gonna take about an hour  to warm up  and that won't come on  that'll just keep coming on and off all the time  till it's hottened up. •136696_137876•
*DAV:	Will it? •138031_138046•
*BRE:	Yeah it won't  I mean, that won't stay on for an hour  I mean I've literally had a hot bath  put  the water on, you know,it goes off at nine o'clock in the morning  put that radiator, put that button on to reset the hot water  for five minutes it's boilers  lit up  ten minutes and then it's gone off •138046_139974•
*DAV:	Mm. •140084_140090•
*BRE:	and I think  but you couldn't go and have a bath cos the water will be stone cold. •140090_140367•
*JEA:	Mm. •140469_140475•
*DAV:	No, there's something wrong. •140580_140832•
*BRE:	No it's always been like that. •140832_141078•
*DAV:	Well I would never have thought of that. •141078_141297•
*BRE:	Yes because if you've used all your hot water  you can't have that boiler going  for an hour or two can you? •141297_142006•
*DAV:	Why? •142195_142206•
*BRE:	Cos it'll be so hot  it gets so hot that boiler  •142206_142439•
*DAV:	Well it's it's like you trying to say you're gonna boil a pan of potatoes  and you've gotta keep turning it off every two minutes, cos it'll be getting too hot! •142439_143213•
*BRE:	Well no because there's a pan of potatoes is a bit different to •143219_143530•
*DAV:	It's not no you using a  you put a boiler in for a purpose, is to heat your water up   innit? •143555_144351•
*BRE:	Yeah I suppose so. •144357_144408•
*DAV:	Yeah, do you like me  like this? •144408_144509•
