*GIN:	Yes,
*KEI:	The paper, (        ) have the paper already with a couple of  (        ) .
*GIN:	yes. (        ) , I haven't heard of   (        ) for ages.
*KEI:	No, no, (        ) you talk to Mary, you know, (        )  (.) 
*GIN:	Do you ever hear from her?
*KEI:	She does, but she doesn't know   (.) how   (        ) from what I can make out, she doesn't know how long, much longer   (        ) is going to stick at Reading or she's going to do her usual, stick at something for two, two months  (        ) .
*GIN:	Reading?
*KEI:	Reading, she's, she got herself, I told you she got herself a place in Reading College, to do her, an English A Level, (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh, Reading you see, I think of Reading, Berkshire.
*KEI:	Yeah, that's right, Reading, Berkshire.
*GIN:	Oh no, you didn't tell me.
*KEI:	Didn't I?
*GIN:	No.
*KEI:	Oh, well she did .
*GIN:	No, that would of stuck in my mind.
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	She moved down to Reading?
*KEI:	She got herself a job in Reading college, she got somebody to take her down there and   (        ) a place to get an English A Level, and Mary said it's a thing with her she wants to get this English A Level cos her father had one and she feels that is she could get and English A Level it would impress him, he, she spends her life trying to impress her father who doesn't really takes much notice of her, (        ) .
*GIN:	Yeah.
*KEI:	And she started off quite well there, she was a little bit erm lonely and missed her   (        ) and everything but she gave the appearance sticking it out until I spoke to Mary last time when she said oh  (        ) .
*GIN:	She must of got a grant.
*KEI:	She, she's there on Social Security which means she can only do part time education because if you're on the Social Security you have to   (        ) available to do a job
*GIN:	Yes.
*KEI:	so that 
*GIN:	Which is reasonable isn't it?
*KEI:	yes, so, so, that you can only do education part time.So Mary said she, she came back up to the, a little while ago she said she didn't get   (        ) do something
*GIN:	Mm, mm.
*KEI:	and even an English A Level's not much good to her, yet she   (        ) .
*GIN:	She should do what Dinda done, I mean Dinda went to evening school for her computer
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	A Level while she was working during the day
*KEI:	Mm.This is, this is it.
*GIN:	Paid for her to help  (        ) .
*KEI:	 (        ) .Erm, living there because all   (        ) can do at the moment, is work in a shop or a restaurant or something like that and she doesn't get paid as much as she'll get on Social Security so it's not worth it,
*GIN:	It's terrible.
*KEI:	it's terrible, (        ) awful   (        ) showing her sense of responsibility and doing what she says she's going to do.
*GIN:	Wouldn't she of done better to take erm a six month's course in secretarial skills?
*KEI:	Well Mary said if I thought for a minute that she would stick at it, I would pay for her   (        ) but 
*GIN:	Yes, yes .
*KEI:	she won't, she's, she's just on the, oh I don't want to work in a boring office   (        ) we've, we've tried to say   (        ) not, you don't have to work, it's an in, it's an in to what you want 
*GIN:	Exactly ,
*KEI:	to do, you, you get into the boring office and sort of, yeah, yeah .
*GIN:	it opens the door, it opens the door , that's why both my younger girls, I mean Diane's a different policy any way cos she wants to be a  (        ) , but with the other two, who worked   (        ) interest in computers and   (        ) when they left college I gave them crash course in, in typing not in shorthand because they don't they don't need shorthand nowadays ,
*KEI:	Really don't need that now, no .
*GIN:	but I find it useful.
*KEI:	Well yes, but I mean, it, now they do audio typing and computing don't they, doesn't   (        ) computing   (        ) .
*GIN:	Yes, yes, that's right, they use , yeah  (        ) , but I insisted that it were open doors for you as jobs were so hard to get, I said it were open doors for you   (        ) and it did it helped them both.
*KEI:	Yeah, (        ) .
*GIN:	Once you're keyboard,
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	keyboard something
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	you've got a keyboard skill and they, they can teach you 
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	these word processors and  (.) 
*KEI:	 (        ) they were talking  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh yeah, oh you talk to him?
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	 ((cough)) I think I  (        ) .
*KEI:	Anyway it, it doesn't alter the fact that if she wanted to do something, erm, (        ) really   (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) Last I heard she was living with her for  (        ) .
*KEI:	 (        ) well she wasn't, she was according to her she, she was allowed to use   (        ) pity, because she, she could, I said to Derek could have been so nice you and her, a little firm together working for the good of the two of you
*GIN:	That's it.
*KEI:	now all, all that's Mary  (        ) 
*GIN:	But I mean, a lot of people don't   (        ) glorify on the jobs they do, I mean Dinda she said you know, it's awful being the one who's getting all the   (        ) all day long, kind of explained   (        ) and help them with their problems, sympathise with, with something that doesn't work    (        )  (.) she'd much rather be outdoors than being a   (        ) or looking after  (        ) , but she said you know, it's, it's a secure job and these days I think well I'm not    (        )  (.) I run my own car and they don't really think that   (        )  (.) 
*KEI:	Well then, somehow other people seemed to be  (        ) .
*GIN:	Think   (        ) she's absolutely, (        ) recession on, so many people
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	all day long I'm getting phone call from  (        ) .
*KEI:	Mm
*GIN:	Erm.
*KEI:	People who, (        ) camcorder or a camera or a video, video camera,
*UNK:	they do say that, that one
*KEI:	microwave
*UNK:	people don't seemed to have cut
*GIN:	No.
*KEI:	microwave a new vacuum cleaner or whatever, I mean all the things they make, music centre   (.) that is a luxury really.
*UNK:	Most people are buying those sort of things   (        )  (.) 
*GIN:	I know it's   (        ) one of the last things I'd would  (        ) 
*KEI:	Vacuum cleaner, yes.
*GIN:	Mm.Having been through the spate of using a clapped out vacuum cleaner that didn't do its job, and how different it is now 
*KEI:	Yes ,

*GIN:	 [laughing]  (        )  [] 
*KEI:	It was the only thing they had, they'd got nothing except  (        ) , I think it was  (        ) .
*GIN:	I didn't get a vacuum cleaner.
*KEI:	 (        ) , we, we got our washing machine   (        ) washing machine, remember it, we used to bolt it to the floors
*GIN:	Yes, yes.
*KEI:	we, we weren't allowed to have that one, until we could pay for it outright.
*GIN:	Yes.
*KEI:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Didn't have a fridge.
*KEI:	No, no.
*GIN:	Not until after we 
*KEI:	 (        ) no ,
*GIN:	moved to Maidenhead.
*KEI:	not until you could pay for it  (        ) , you didn't do, go  (        ) .
*GIN:	Remember my washing machine where I used to turn the handle at the top, heat it up with gas 
*KEI:	Yeah, (        ) , yeah, yeah .
*GIN:	and if I'd got something big and heavy you used to say to me bring it down and put it in my big machine.
*KEI:	Mm  (.) 
*GIN:	I used to bring down quilts and    (        )  (.) my machine wasn't big enough and in any case I couldn't possibly lift them once they were 
*KEI:	No, no ,
*GIN:	full of water.
*KEI:	no, but nowadays the, the machines don't take  (        ) , mind you because it was   (        ) take a lot of water, waste  (        ) .
*GIN:	Mm.
*KEI:	Nowadays it's
*GIN:	Don't they, don't they have  (        ) 
*KEI:	I know, I know if I've got a towel in mine or a big thing and, and it's all happens to be on one side 
*GIN:	One side ,
*KEI:	of the, the drum and it starts to erm   (.) spin
*GIN:	yeah
*KEI:	the whole thing goes woof and it all seems 
*GIN:	Really .
*KEI:	to move to one side, yeah, cos it's standing in an area and it isn't flat against  (        ) .
*GIN:	That seems rather   (        ) something heavy.
*KEI:	Mm, mm, (        ) 
*GIN:	Yes.
*KEI:	 ((laugh)) .
*GIN:	But I often look back and think well if was the girls who insisted that it's time mum had a proper automatic washing machine
*KEI:	Yeah.
*GIN:	and then only had it four years, but I used to   (        ) it was, it's such a waste that washing machine, I think maybe I've done a few shirts   (        ) hand washing and all the   (        ) water, whereas in the twin tub I'd of done the light weights, heated the water up done the shirts and  (        ) , erm, got the   (        ) put in, maybe towels and then I'd put, re-heat the water if, if it wasn't really soiled and I could do either all the dogs stuff or, or my dusters 
*KEI:	Yeah, mm.
*GIN:	and then after that you've got all the water left and it cleaned the sink as you as the pump pumped it out, you could go quickly with a brush round the sink and suds cleaned all the sink for you, or you could with your   (        ) pail.
*KEI:	Yeah, or, or even with the garden  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh yes, I used to save it for the garden too. (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*GIN:	Now, now, with it, the one thing in that's it, and all the water's wasted, you can't re-use it for anything.
*KEI:	No.
*GIN:	I suppose I could if I could pull the machine out and were, were the pipe goes over into the waste   (.) I mean people do that in the Isle of Wight aren't they, were they've got to, need to
*KEI:	Mm.
*GIN:	they unhook their washing machine

*GIN:	 (        ) and they put it into a, a an old bath or anything
