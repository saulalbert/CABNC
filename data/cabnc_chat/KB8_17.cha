*ANN:	The one facing onto the bridge? •887646_888936•
*JAM:	Yes. •889166_889726•
        That er  Tess  bought  and they did it all up. •889996_896709•
        When they told me at work she'd bought that, I was, cos they lived up at Green Lane  I thought my God he'd have  they've picked a  a bad spot there cos there's no flood protection at all there. •898709_911669•
        And in fact, when the river rises they  it drops down onto that house, and the house next door. •912729_919299•
        Anyway, I saw that everything was up, the doors, the back door was open, the front door was open  there was everything up from downstairs and  must be awful. •922819_934329•
*ANN:	Well I saw the curtains were down  erm  when I took  the triplets •934429_946519•

*JAM:	There was. •956959_957359•
        Well there's, it was er  there was a table. •957429_959969•
        And a house further along  in  Abbey View there  cos and it was four houses actually in the  •959969_968359•
*ANN:	The one on ? •968629_969209•

        Well that one, I I, I delivered there. •973319_974549•
        But, no, about three houses on from that  they were decorating. •974779_979279•
        Now, it looked as if they were newly decorating so whether the water got into there or not, but it didn't look  as if they were in the process of decorating so  I hope it didn't for their sake. •979449_990009•
*ANN:	Well, that one on the the first one •990379_992289•
*JAM:	Aye. •992469_992509•
        That's the one that appears on television . •992879_994209•

*JAM:	They've got erm  sort of walls in front of the houses, right next to the, the bay windows with erm  with the slot, where they, they slot in these steel erm, plates. •100357_101900•
*ANN:	Have they? •101999_102034•
*JAM:	Yes. •102057_102098•
        Oh yes. •102098_102146•
        About two or three of them, they have, at that end. •102152_102350•
*ANN:	I never noticed that. •102363_102635•
*JAM:	Yep. •102655_102672•
        With erm  and they had sand, they all had sandbags along there, but they had these sort of  er  walls built up. •102672_103489•
        But I mean they're decorative walls, they've got plants growing in the top and this sort of thing, built up to the, about the level of the window •103575_104439•
*ANN:	Mhm. •104531_104546•
*JAM:	and er  then they have  the gap for the path and they have a, erm  a steel plate. •104546_104947•

*JAM:	the  •105877_105883•
*ANN:	that themselves? •105883_105964•
*JAM:	I think so, yes. •105989_106287•
        I think so. •106287_106312•
        Yes, cos they're not the same. •106312_106468•
        I mean each  each house is different but er  there's  not all of them have them, there's only two or three had done that. •106474_106994•

*ANN:	I don't think anything's the twelfth of July. •201393_201613•
*JAM:	No. •201613_201646•
        It's the fourteenth of July is Bastille Day. •201668_201943•
        But, anyway •201943_201972•
*ANN:	And what are you that day? •201972_202095•
*JAM:	I'm on early. •202189_202385•

*ANN:	Ordinary early? •202439_202494•
        Quarter past three early? •202597_202662•
*JAM:	Oh, well, I say I'm on early but  I will be, I could be an early or a late. •202662_203249•
        So that's •203249_203298•
*ANN:	So if you took them that day you'd be going while you were on duty? •203298_203660•
*JAM:	Well, for most of it  or part of it. •203742_204026•
        But I could organize that. •204161_204392•
        And, if  what they call it? •204392_204742•
*ANN:	Is that a Sunday at Easter? •204742_204821•
*JAM:	It's a Sunday. •204936_205049•
        If they can actually let me know  whether that bus is available or not •205049_205526•
*ANN:	You're not gonna drive that bus are you? •205526_205849•
*JAM:	I didn't say I was. •205849_206164•
        But, Mr  has got a P S V licence. •206164_206226•
        I don't know if I can drive  •206226_206329•
*ANN:	Oh! •206329_206356•
*JAM:	the bus or not, it depends  we'll have to see. •206356_206730•
*ANN:	And does he, does he drive the buses? •206730_206983•
        Er, the hospital bus like  •206986_207064•
*JAM:	No. •207093_207100•
*ANN:	that? •207101_207102•
*JAM:	No. •207107_207121•
        No. •207132_207147•
        He's never driven. •207165_207219•
        He's not down as a  as a driver for the minibus now. •207225_207634•
        But he's got a P S V licence which is a different thing altogether. •207634_208035•
*ANN:	Yes, but, if he was willing to drive in his spare time, he would have his name down surely? •208035_208424•
        Wouldn't he? •208480_208535•
*JAM:	Well one would have thought so, but I said to er Mrs  you see, about the minibus, no not the minibus, the M S bus being available  and, I said the problem was  or maybe  that we'd have to have drivers who have had a P S V licence, or what they call it? •208550_210299•
        It isn't a P S V license now, it's  very different type of licence. •210299_210620•
*ANN:	Well whatever it's called. •210620_210677•
*JAM:	But it's the same thing. •210677_210922•
*ANN:	Yeah. •210932_210952•
*JAM:	And she said, oh my husband's just renewed his. •210952_211363•
        So he could drive and so there'd be no problem she says. •211363_211758•
        But he's never ever, as far as I know  offered to drive the minibus. •211758_212595•
*ANN:	Does he work? •212651_212723•
*JAM:	Well •212723_212762•
*ANN:	It sounds, it sounds odd saying, oh my husband's just renewed his, it makes it sound as if he hasn't had a P S V  erm  licence for a while. •212762_213904•
*JAM:	I don't know. •213904_213971•
*ANN:	Cos if he was working, and driving  he it, surely he would have automatically renewed it? •213971_214593•
*JAM:	I don't know. •214666_214725•
*ANN:	So it sounds as if he's just renewed it after a while. •214725_214857•
*JAM:	They used to have some sort of test on that . •214857_215052•
*ANN:	So maybe that's why he's never volunteered before. •215052_215324•
        If he didn't have the licence, he couldn't. •215324_215499•
*JAM:	Well yes, of course. •215512_215555•
*ANN:	Except, he could have for the minibus of course. •215582_216055•
        Where's my knitting gone? •216117_216320•
*JAM:	I think he had a pet shop. •216320_216876•
*ANN:	Well he wouldn't need a P S V licence for a pet shop. •216878_217255•
*JAM:	But, I don't know that he does now. •217261_217383•
*ANN:	Unless you were a Pet Shop Boy  and were a roadie. •217383_218187•
*JAM:	Mm mm. •218188_218504•
*ANN:	I can't remember what line I was doing. •218504_219206•
*JAM:	Well  because she  periodically brings the bird seed for the  the bird on the ward. •219206_219731•
        I'm sure he never . •219731_220060•
        Whether the business was successful or not. •220060_220206•
        I had a vague recollection  somebody said he had this pet shop at Blagden or not Blagden er  •220206_220761•
*ANN:	Blagden? •220785_220810•
        There are no shops  •220810_220934•

*ANN:	Oh. •222287_222296•
*JAM:	 ((sniff)) 
*ANN:	Mhm. •222296_222315•
*JAM:	But we could still take the minibus and just take  three or four. •222315_222959•
*ANN:	Yeah. •222959_222965•
*JAM:	Well that's an alternative. •222986_223392•
        But that will be a good day to go out on. •223392_224949•
*ANN:	Mm mm. •224957_224975•
*JAM:	But we could take my mother on the other one. •224975_225161•
*ANN:	Yeah. •225169_225180•
*JAM:	Or we could take  them periodically. •225180_225307•
        Could go out, well the next  then there's a queue a mile long. •225314_225607•
        I said no. •225618_225666•
        I said mark the ones on that thing. •225666_226042•
        you want to go to. •226042_226454•
        That's when I   •226500_226546•

        There was certainly no  indication of it anywhere in the village. •232330_232753•
        There wasn't even anybody to ask! •232753_233137•
*JAM:	Nope. •233137_233163•

        And then, in those days there was a bus service that way. •236653_236958•
        I don't think there's a bus service running that way now. •236958_237173•

*JAM:	while the death is being investigated. •241861_242448•
        And she  she went into the R E I, with a query  stroke. •242448_242970•
*ANN:	I know. •242970_243148•
        I remember that. •243164_243282•
*JAM:	A query  I think she had a query lump on her breast or something, er lump or something. •243282_244322•
        And  they transferred her to the, the Cottage  and she did quite well, and she was home. •244322_244707•
        And whatever lump it was  they said wasn't anything to worry about. •244707_245477•
        But then  it was virtually  er  clear again, she was saying  but she has a brain tumour. •245479_247052•
        And whether they can operate . •247052_247393•
*ANN:	Mm. •247393_247409•

*ANN:	Yeah. •249644_249676•
*JAM:	And er  the dampness and the  tramping all over the  rough ground and what have you, wasn't good for his knees. •249676_250518•
*ANN:	Mm. •250541_250558•
*JAM:	He   came from all over  Macaw or somewhere down there  he came from. •250558_251264•

*JAM:	And when he came out of the army  you know, after the war  er  he didn't want to go. •251393_251911•
        Well, I think, I don't know if they went back to the pits and sort of left, but he didn't want to stay there and  and got this job as a gamekeeper . •251915_254131•
        . He had a stroke. •254145_254250•
        They say that if you, if it wasn't for the shooting  we wouldn't have any grouse or pheasants cos they wouldn't be preserved. •254250_255266•
        they  they'd be  on a farm if he wants. •255269_255797•
        The grouse apparently it would. •255955_256026•
*ANN:	I nearly stood on a grouse once, when we were walking up  I wasn't walking with you, it was when we were with the Footpath Society. •256026_256776•

*ANN:	I couldn't believe it! •258421_258776•

*JAM:	Well we nearly  when I was up with the children at the when I was  •259433_259898•

        Anyway, it was a good job we did because these  erm  these grouse and these chickens, I mean, they were so blended in with the  the, the  roadside you could hardly see them, and then they moved. •261412_262633•
        As we were coming down so slowly, and I think  we stopped suddenly  cos then they walked across the path. •262633_263124•
