*JEA:	Yes •125694_125712•
*BRE:	It's the fact, that's how I see it. •125713_125913•
*JEA:	I'm seriously  •125914_126050•
*BRE:	the fact  •126050_126130•
*JEA:	thinking •126162_126189•

*BRE:	and I was in Surrey. •126316_126416•
*JEA:	That's right. •126417_126460•
        A lot depends  on  what point I sell my house  if I  •126696_127349•
*BRE:	What price you get. •127349_127430•

*BRE:	She  •128833_128840•
*JEA:	they haven't to sold the house  they had a visit from a Bank Manager  her preferential mortgage treatment  as part of their  immonuments  they always have had •128840_130386•
*BRE:	That's right. •130387_130532•
*JEA:	the bank seems to pay the  a cripplingly low salary  demand that everybody dresses in  in Saville Row, but  you could buy a house on a something like two and half percent mortgage  well it's not like that now, but it's still  still get a preferential mortgage  and this banking person  man was looking around only three or four weeks ago, but    you see a lot depends on your luck as to whether  you pick up a  a very good buyer. •130532_133964•
*BRE:	Is your  friends have they had anybody look at theirs yet? •133969_134222•
*JEA:	They had a couple of people round, but no  no nibbles, or I think, yes, I think somebody a  silly offer because of course all the  property pages and places like that, Daily Telegraph are urging everybody, go on  put in an offer for a house, put in a silly offer! •134284_135766•
*BRE:	Yeah. •136000_136020•

*BRE:	That's right. •136317_136395•

*JEA:	yeah, I'm going to go back into my bedroom  and Neil can still use the ensuite shower cos he's got the tip of the idea that he's got to come in  clothed  and knock on the door  cos last time I was in my bedroom he asked if he could use the shower,situation   he'd  you know, and I'd let him  after all, it's not as though my , there's a door between my bedroom and the •139482_141925•

*BRE:	handyman or something like Neil, I mean  •170687_170880•

*BRE:	you could make the money up. •172006_172107•
*JEA:	Of course you can  well I knew of a girl who married  I wouldn't say she'd married well  when she started out but her husband  was enterprising  eventually got himself quite a good job at the  at people who print the bank notes so so that they  they started off in a  prefab  and they ended up with a new four bedroom  bungalow with central heating  at  Athorpe Roding . •172159_175453•
        And er I lost touch with her after that but Joyce was very nice, very, very  a down to earth cockney girl from Hockston  and she said er  she'd tell her sister  she said I do admire my sister she said they'll never have anything other than a council house, I don't suppose  but she said  my brother-in-law  mends people's motorcycles  as a side line  and the money that he gets from that  he gives her most of it  and she buys things on hire purchase, this was the days when hire purchase wasn't  fearsomely expensive •175779_179493•
*BRE:	Mm. •179532_179590•
*JEA:	and she said my sister spends  I mean, we're now talking about  nineteen seventy  my sister spends twelve and six a week  on  things from  for the house  on the hire purchase  if she ever  truly runs into debt she'll save  part of the cost of the thing, you know  and then she knows that she's always going to have to put twelve and six a week aside  but she does that and buys things for the house  and you see if you've got  if you've got that little bit of extra coming in it's quite  well it's like my lodgers, Brenda  if I couldn't if I couldn't get  what I need from my lodgers  well Neil pays me  Neil's house rent which thirty pound a week •179590_184611•
*BRE:	And that's not very  •184633_184745•
*JEA:	No  I stop  •184745_184968•
*BRE:	No  •184968_184976•

*BRE:	Oh I see. •185459_185517•
*JEA:	But at the moment I get thirty pounds a week •185574_185721•
*BRE:	I see so if he gets  •185721_185841•
*JEA:	and if he gets  •185841_185879•
*BRE:	some money coming in •185879_185942•
*JEA:	that's right, and he gets some unemployment money and I take  ten pounds a week off him, for his food, I mean, it's not enough but it'll do, you know  and then in dribs and drabs begrudgingly from that forty  over the week  once he starts to run out of money  cos he's paid once a fortnight  I begin to give him  his karate money  and  here's two pounds fifty to go to the pub with Neil, you know, little bits  •185942_188247•
*BRE:	Mm. •188259_188281•
*JEA:	little bits, little bits  and I'll buy you your tobacco Neil  nothing much but  little bits of something  now if he were  working and could give me the full sixty that is thirty for his room and thirty for his  food  so that I didn't have to worry about actually paying for him  but he was paying me  Paul is going to pay me fifty  that's thirty pounds in, I made a rule to Paul that he is going to eat thirty pounds worth of food  and there are only twenty pounds in my profit  and then the other rule, a man called Alan  this window cleaner  he wants the room  that I'm in at the moment •188292_192320•
*BRE:	Oh dear. •192336_192373•
*JEA:	because he doesn't want the ensuite, he can't afford it, he can't pay forty pounds a week •192386_192886•
*BRE:	Yeah. •192898_192901•
*JEA:	or thirty five, he wants to pay as little as possible. •192949_193225•

*BRE:	Two eighty a month. •208396_208577•

*BRE:	So what does it  did Philip pay up on time? •208952_209233•

*BRE:	That's it! •213143_213217•
*JEA:	that's it, I'm having no more of it! •213255_213429•
        I've had two lots of terrible upheavals. •213429_213656•
*BRE:	Mm  he can't, you know, he's  •213656_213911•

        I mean I  I went in there  yesterday, I think it was, or this morning  erm  he put wet shirts into the wardrobe admittedly with the doors open  but that bedroom is not a bedroom that I like to get any dampness in at all, Brenda. •216027_218583•
*BRE:	Why does he just hang it  you know  put in the tumble dryer or hang it in the garage? •218613_219011•

*BRE:	Has Tony taken all his stuff out? •219309_219915•
*JEA:	Yes, he has at last. •219932_219996•
*BRE:	Is he in his house yet or is he still in that  •220090_220369•
*JEA:	Yes and he's very, very difficult to  feed himself, to get the food in  because, you know, he liked to come in a half past ten and bully me to cook things for him  that's why sometimes I used to run up to bed and pretend I was  asleep . •220369_221841•
*BRE:	Asleep . •221841_221855•
        So what er  so how does he cope now then? •221855_222264•
*JEA:	Cos I thought that was a with utmost difficulty  and he has to get his little daughter on Sunday to help him to clean the place. •222269_222825•
*BRE:	She'll soon get fed up with that. •222836_223183•
*JEA:	Well  tough he's not getting my, he's not getting the ensuite room, I can tell you  If I if I have got three lodgers and I'm getting on with them and they're  they're paying me regularly  for the sake of an extra  twenty pounds or whatever  and the annoyance from Tony  coming in  at ten  or there abouts  and then sitting there like a stuffed frock  waiting for me to leap about and put food on a plate and microwave it  not doing it, Brenda! •223183_226140•
*BRE:	No  you shouldn't, I mean you •226307_226398•
*JEA:	I mean I when I was dropping dead with exhaustion one evening I said to him  look Tony,there's I've cooked a chicken, there's a big chicken cooling on the table  and there there were  red sauce, potatoes, gravy, I said, stick the lot on a plate a and, you know, film it over, microwave it  oh well I shan't bother to eat anything  now of course he was paying me for his food •226398_228800•
*BRE:	Mm. •228863_228872•
*JEA:	and he was jolly well seeing whether  •228872_229108•
*BRE:	But if you'd said  oh well I'll prepare, what about if I prepare , oh yes well I'll have that  probably if you'd got  done it  he'd have it because he had to help himself. •229108_229992•
*JEA:	Oh well I I then said oh well  I'll alright I'll fling it together for you  oh good  can you bring it into the sitting room? •230010_230744•

*BRE:	I tell you really, I mean, I used to have one and went to look  •233863_234245•

*BRE:	I mean they probably are quite expensive  but I mean  I I'm sure A and N or somewhere, Debenhams or somewhere would have them •236824_237775•
*JEA:	Debenhams probably, but the John Lewis's were excellent, and some  some of them were tin and I do wonder if you're eating on your lap  a tin tray might be rather cold  but on the other hand, you let the heat from the plate through to your poor little legs. •237775_239178•
*BRE:	I never noticed that! •239183_239245•
