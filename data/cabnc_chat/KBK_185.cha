*DAV:	So you come up behind it so that your body and the striker's ball, that being your red ball and the other ball, the object ball are always the same straight line I mean it doesn't matter whether you come in from the side you're walking up to it in a straight line put your mallet down, swing it through.
*CHR:	Yes.Lovely.Yes it all looks so darned easy when you do it David  ((laugh)) .Yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) I don't think it would be worth playing if it's easy.
*CHR:	No.Absolutely.Absolutely and the that's why the
*DAV:	You can't expect to get anything out of practice  (.) 
*CHR:	 (.) unless you concentrate on it Yes.Yes.Yes.
*DAV:	That's it.Now that was a nice hit.That's not quite  (        ) 
*CHR:	Not hard enough
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	Put the other way it was a good stroke.You can get over to over to bat.You don't need to be very near bat, do you?So you know again I tend to hit it downwards you see, but a lot of players don't even er lot of players play their rolls like that.I tend to.. you know a lot of players don't play any side shots they play all their shots like that.
*CHR:	Do they? yes.Yes.
*DAV:	I tend to think it's easier to play at the side, because you can actually do that if you want.
*CHR:	Yes
*DAV:	You can, you know I can   (        ) I can get two balls to almost roll from corner to corner by doing
*CHR:	Yes yes yes
*DAV:	So try it like that and swing your mallet too so you won't be able to go above hoop three and  (        ) 
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Right.
*CHR:	Okay.
*DAV:	You've got to stand forward a little bit more, haven't you?You've got to play down on to the ball.
*CHR:	Right.Right.
*DAV:	So bring your feet forward a little 
*CHR:	You mean further forward.Right.
*DAV:	Lovely.Yes lovely.Very good.Now that's pretty well perfect, isn't it?
*CHR:	Smashing yes.Yes.That's good.Yes.Yes.
*DAV:	You can still cut back over to the to about there.
*CHR:	No no I wanting to get  (.) 
*DAV:	You want to hit croquet plan?
*CHR:	Yes.To to get to there.
*DAV:	You can then do a nice little shot to get closer on the hoop with red
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Put black over there somewhere.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Put your mallet on the floor.
*CHR:	Right yes yes good point   (.) yeah just right.
*DAV:	Right that's a nice approach   (        ) should be able to get the red somewhere
*CHR:	Yes
*DAV:	 (        ) there it is a little roll shot.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	If you do you're gonna play it by  (        ) 
*CHR:	Do you prefer this would you?
*DAV:	Well I think you should do what you feel comfortable at most most you you   (.) there again if you saw Vincent playing, he just plays it standing up.Well yes pretty good
*CHR:	Is it?
*DAV:	except you've got a slight problem, haven't you?Cos you can't really get that red through without crushing it.
*CHR:	Ah ah I really didn't understand the crushing bit, sorry.
*DAV:	Well, if I do that, that's a crush cos my mallet's in contact whilst the ball's in contact with the hoop.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	I'm crushing the ball against the hoop.Your problem is that you because the line of that ball is overhanging the wire
*CHR:	Yes
*DAV:	even if you played it like that it's still a crush.
*CHR:	Yes Yes
*DAV:	 (        ) mallet you're play   (        ) really you've got no choice but to come back.
*CHR:	Right right.
*DAV:	I don't know.It's a very difficult one I think in a game that probably they'd just let you do that.
*CHR:	Aha
*DAV:	It did sound to me like a crush, because you've really got to play away from the mallet haven't you?
*CHR:	The the that's the the the correct procedure is it, to play away rather than a
*DAV:	I think most people would consider I mean if you can picture the   (        ) course of the ball, it's gonna do that, isn't it?
*CHR:	Mm
*DAV:	Your mallet is going to be is gotta be in contact with the mallet the ball whilst the ball is in contact with the wire
*CHR:	Yes yes yes
*DAV:	you can't
