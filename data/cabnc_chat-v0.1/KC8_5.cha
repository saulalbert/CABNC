*GIL:	She thinks she's going  •869595_870335•
*UNK:	No, Charlotte  •870335_870725•
*GIL:	Oh erm  let me slow down this bit, erm  no it's , oh it is twenty six ninety nine anywhere else, I've seen it but in Argos,, well William looked in the catalogue on Tuesday for me, but he said it was nineteen ninety nine in Argos •871445_890125•
*UNK:	Yeah. •892065_892255•
*GIL:	but erm, had a little  with the children's Christmas presents  •892255_897645•
*UNK:	Who? •898615_898755•
*GIL:	Was it Monday, no it was yesterday, I was in the loo and I could hear this paper being ripped and I thought oh they've got one of my club catalogues, I didn't think any more of it and then I could hear Joseph going weee,I thought what the devil's he got, so went out, Joseph has got the flying circus bus that was meant for Charlotte and him and, Brenda and Charlotte was sharing the, the, garage thing that I've brought  so I thought well now it's out, well they're not going to keep all that till  I said to him whatever is Father Christmas going to say, I said he's supposed to be taking these away to bring I said er, what's Father Christmas gonna say?, no Ben   forget, so I thought while they're out I could see Joseph's playing a lot, way with this bus thing, he was having a whale of a time, he thought that was great, so I said to Charlotte I said do you like that bus? •898755_955895•
        Cos that was meant for her you see, she said no, I want the house, she meant the garage, so I said don't you like the bus then Charlotte, no, bus for Joseph, bus for the baby, so I thought well that's decided it then now I, she, she better have Mr Toot and •956135_973675•
*UNK:	Don't make a lot of difference really does it? •973685_975695•
*GIL:	You see all  •975695_976125•
*UNK:	when it's  •976165_976805•
*GIL:	all the figures all erm sit er all the same  •976805_979015•
*UNK:	yeah  •979475_979815•
*GIL:	things you see, so erm, I thought right well that's it Ben can have the garage, I'll go and buy her the flying circus, Joseph can have the bus and call it a day. •979815_990335•
*UNK:	Mm. •991155_991255•
*GIL:	You know, I mean they've still got a couple of books each and I've bought three  •991395_995415•
*UNK:	Swing  •995915_996035•
*GIL:	the swing and I've bought them a couple of wooden puzzles where you pick the bits up  so, I thought well then I'll call it a day there, and that'll be that  •996165_100592•
*UNK:	Well this is this is it Gilly cos I mean •100592_100875•
*GIL:	Oh you can keep going though  totally over the top  I thought well Joseph's was twelve ninety nine and Ben's was fourteen nineteen ninety nine and that's just tough that I've got you know, I can't get Charlotte's any cheaper than that, but, I mean they're not gonna know how much I've, they're not gonna say well you've got five pound more than what I have cos they're not of that age so, that's how I've left it, that's what I'm gonna do, I'll get her the circus and then they can swap them over and Joseph will be happy that he got something on wheels •100875_104618•
*UNK:	Yeah •104618_104621•
*GIL:	I said to Robert  •104621_104698•
*UNK:	He has got something on wheels from us •104698_104905•
*GIL:	yeah, I said to Rob you can't keep buying them learning toys, they've gotta •104905_105348•
*UNK:	Yeah  •105348_105367•
*GIL:	play as well haven't they? •105367_105492•
*UNK:	well that helps them as much really don't it? •105492_105672•
*GIL:	Yeah , so erm cos then I had the argument about putting them back in the box. •105879_106286•
*UNK:	Tell you what I've got, I keep getting, I, I shall think I'll have another one tonight, is a great big egg box •106286_106975•
*GIL:	Mm, well you see, these, these are big boxes on their own there, putting them in another one  •106975_107529•
*UNK:	Yes, but I should you'd get one of those boxes in the end  •107529_107895•
*GIL:	Do you think so? •107931_108106•
*UNK:	Well, those size of those boxes  •108106_108266•
*GIL:	Yeah, yeah  •108266_108292•
*UNK:	I've, I've got three of them now •108293_108472•
*GIL:	well I could do with, I could actually do with one cos little bits and pieces, but erm, course then when I've  them in •108481_109170•
*UNK:	I do  rather use the  one, like me I'd like two, cos I've got one full of bits and pieces  and the odds, odds and ends I keep  •109170_109957•
*GIL:	Oh   I've got, the one that I've emptied this morning . •110040_110887•
        I think I found  just the tiny   •110887_111528•
*UNK:	Yeah  •112635_112641•
*GIL:	So this   •112656_112727•
*UNK:	I  come up to that cow upstairs alright,alright •112735_113019•
*GIL:	Mm. •113082_113093•
*UNK:	you know er, I think I've got to get me eyes tested, cos this can make  •113093_113531•
*GIL:	Well you said that months ago •113531_113651•
*UNK:	this, well this can make you feel, can't it? •113665_113902•
*GIL:	Mm, mm, I mean, its probably got to the  •114084_114242•
*UNK:	Sometimes I look  •114263_114284•
*GIL:	its probably got to the stage where you want glasses all the time now, just you know erm  •114284_114802•
*UNK:	Yeah  •114993_115008•
*GIL:	I mean that doesn't help as well, I know  Sainsbury's or Tesco's and you have to keep taking them off and putting them on •115008_115703•
*UNK:	Yes. •115703_115712•
*GIL:	that doesn't help cos your eyes are not having time to adjust erm without the glasses before you put them back on again . •115712_116271•
*UNK:	And I can't cope walking around in my reading glasses but I've got to •116271_116585•
*GIL:	Mm. •116636_116663•
*UNK:	when I want to look at prices. •116663_116883•
*GIL:	Pair of bi-focals or something. •116883_117037•
*UNK:	Oh my god. •117042_117080•
*GIL:	No, I meant the ones with the half moons in •117095_117268•
*UNK:	Yeah. •117268_117278•
*GIL:	or where they change half way down, so you haven't got to keep taking your glasses on and off  •117369_117883•
*UNK:	Yeah, they are got •117943_118168•
*GIL:	Are they? •118168_118208•
        I think bi-focals with the half brim bits  •118246_120279•
*UNK:	So erm  Which I thought well where's that all  about the cake, other day, that three pound one, and then two of us went •120310_120943•
*GIL:	Oh god  •120950_121029•
*UNK:	there must be a reason  you know, they, they went well so I've got sixty of them, they take them with me tonight and they said would there be any cakes available for Saturday and I, I think and I nearly said to erm, well last year you reckon you couldn't sell cakes, but anyway I helped her •121029_122914•
*UNK:	Nan, nan, nan   •122914_123033•
*UNK:	so, and er I said do you sell  butterfly ones, and she said I was going to have a go at making them, but she said I can't make them like you, •123033_123829•
*GIL:	Aha •123841_123856•
*UNK:	I thought well I ain't   •124057_124134•
*GIL:	It involves , it involves too much work, that's why she can't do them like you. •124135_124501•
*UNK:	Christmas fillers you see, so I, she, cos I've, I'm going to make a couple of fruit cakes, I said well I was going to bring in a couple of fruit cakes and said if you need them not, if not I said I'll take them back I thought no way is Sue  gonna eat them, eat cakes like she did last year, or year before •124501_126116•
*GIL:	Yeah. •126278_126312•
*UNK:	she only had the bloody cheek to charge us last year for a turkey wrong, but I mean I did get that sorted out afterwards. •126422_127161•
*GIL:	So are you helping with the catering side or are you running a cake stall? •127366_127707•
*UNK:	I can't run a cake stall Gilly cos when I got a book a someone erm wants to  •127707_128264•
*GIL:	Oh yeah •128264_128289•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	That's right, oh  •128289_128407•
*UNK:	say ya, nay, or  and er, so I •128433_128932•
*GIL:	Well as you said last year they really wanted something for nothing, for it  •128932_129265•

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	er pie, chips and peas, hot actually, bread roll and butter, for one ninety nine, I wasn't half pleased, well that just suit us cos it, we would have gone somewhere else and had coffee and a cake it would of cost you, one fifty each  •136475_137902•
