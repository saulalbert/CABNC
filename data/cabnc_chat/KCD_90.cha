*NON:	Yeah.
*HEL:	You know they were much quieter, it didn't go with a swing that Amy's.
*NON:	How old is Clare, she's a bit older?
*HEL:	She's six.She has it six, seven and eight.
*NON:	Yeah.
*HEL:	Cos she said she thought, you know, they needed to be a bit older.
*NON:	Yeah.
*HEL:	I mean she's talking about it and I said well I thought at five they were probably a bit young.
*NON:	Hm.
*HEL:	We haven't, we didn't have it till they were six.Deborah apparently wasn't pleased.
