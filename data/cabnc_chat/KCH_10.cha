@Comment:	conversation #10 (Tape 076303)
*PHI:	Right. •142230_142262•
        Now you said you were gonna tell me what's happened on the news so far. •142272_142559•
*DAV:	Three people have er been killed in a railway accident after their  their car  ran into the side of a train. •142627_143560•
*PHI:	Oh dear! •143586_143632•
*DAV:	which is about er  which  is about er  open  er  the day after tomorrow. •143661_144601•
*PHI:	What's open  the day after tomorrow? •144836_144995•
*DAV:	The level crossing. •145014_145088•
*PHI:	Oh it's closed now is it? •145150_145277•
*DAV:	No, they're going to open it. •145468_145587•
        It's new. •145716_145780•
*PHI:	Aha. •145823_145859•
        What else has been happening? •146025_146127•
*DAV:	And dad? •146162_146281•
*PHI:	Yes. •146281_146298•
*DAV:	You know that many level crossings are one barrier? •146298_146519•
*PHI:	Yes. •146573_146604•
*DAV:	Well that  they showed us er  a thing about  the speed about  about the traffic approaching lights when they're  starting flashing. •146876_148410•
        It showed you a car go over that, going over,a lorry going over crossing and the lights were starting to flash. •148410_148996•
*PHI:	Well a lot of people do that. •149047_149160•
        It's very dangerous. •149160_149268•
*DAV:	But I was supposed to stop. •149270_149414•
*PHI:	They as soon as the lights flash supposed to stop. •149422_149579•
        Be  •149670_149683•
*DAV:	What the running of the railway line? •149683_149820•
*PHI:	No, they're supposed to stop before the lights. •149863_150058•
        Silly! •150080_150116•
*DAV:	Yeah. •150181_150192•
*PHI:	Because, on a lot of those the train •150234_150470•
*DAV:	Yes. •150552_150567•
*PHI:	activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing. •150670_151030•
*DAV:	Yes cos most,most of that one barrier, it said on the news that they're automatic. •151083_151595•
*PHI:	That's right. •151727_151771•
        So  •151891_151900•
*DAV:	They have er special cameras which  they take the line of the trains both sides. •151900_152439•
*PHI:	Mhm. •152508_152540•
        And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers  the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you. •152683_153738•
        So it's a very silly thing to do. •153804_153930•
*DAV:	Yes. •153930_153946•
        Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going across. •154152_154668•
*PHI:	Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across. •154668_155089•
        But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come  •155121_155366•
*DAV:	If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway  er ah  there's only way you can escape. •155366_156333•
        Go round by the barrier pole. •156462_156611•
*PHI:	Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield. •156736_156959•
*DAV:	Yes. •157017_157027•
        The barriers  •157027_157154•
*PHI:	Er  •157154_157157•
*DAV:	. •_•
*PHI:	they've got full barriers you see. •157179_157321•
*DAV:	Full barriers. •157359_157399•
        Double are safe. •157506_157590•
*PHI:	Well, they're different because they have them  they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're  •157671_158236•
*DAV:	Yes they are controlled. •158236_158294•
*PHI:	controlled by a television. •158294_158414•
        Er  •158471_158474•
*DAV:	If they're controlled  well dad, everyone knows that one the Tackleby's controlled by a man. •158507_159076•
*PHI:	Oh yes. •159175_159210•
        That was good wasn't it? •159210_159295•
*DAV:	Yes. •159295_159305•
*PHI:	Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box didn't you? •159509_159768•
*DAV:	Oh yes. •160060_160085•
        But  though it was rather dangerous. •160092_160360•
        After all in my, you know my er  people working on the rails book? •160380_160742•
        The one  •160745_160877•
*PHI:	Yes. •160877_160907•
*DAV:	. •_•
        It says, you must never try to steer steer round a barrier poles. •160914_161594•
*PHI:	That's right. •161794_161885•
*DAV:	And they're trying to take away as many er  possible erm, mainly one barrier er  railway gates as possible. •161885_162567•
*PHI:	Well I didn't know they were trying to get rid of those. •162767_162935•
*DAV:	Especially on busy main roads. •162935_163037•
*PHI:	But some of the crossings around this area didn't have any barriers at all  •163093_163479•
*DAV:	Ah ah. •163572_163588•
*PHI:	and  they just had the flashing lights. •163633_163825•
*DAV:	Well it's like ones at Meading Meadow Road. •163825_163950•
*PHI:	That's right. •164059_164112•
*DAV:	They're only wooden ones. •164128_164283•
*PHI:	Ah well no Meadow Road's got the old gates but  at Natherton there were some that didn't have any  barriers at all, they were just flashing lights. •164283_164981•
        Now, do you remember  now let's think whether you were born. •165009_165309•
        When the Lockington railway disaster happened  that was just a few miles from here. •165318_165906•
*DAV:	At Manchester? •165916_166030•
*PHI:	No, Lockington. •166030_166159•
*DAV:	Ah. •166159_166227•
*PHI:	And that was where er, a train came off the railways when it hit a van  on  •166247_166667•
*DAV:	Oh. •166667_166679•
*PHI:	on the crossing er and killed a lot of people. •166751_166961•
*DAV:	Oh. •166973_167009•
        I, I, I know, I'd, I have never heard  never heard. •167009_167319•
*PHI:	Oh! •167472_167483•
        That's surprise cos I was on the way to Hull  oh yes! •167483_167746•
        You were around because I was going to take you and Chrissy to Hull to a train fair •167850_168383•
*DAV:	Ah yes! •168395_168510•
        And mum and Chrissy slept in the car. •168510_168718•
*PHI:	and and that's they were, they, mum was gonna stay at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train •168718_169276•
*DAV:	Yeah. •169417_169423•
*PHI:	and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car. •169423_169719•
        And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash. •169776_170070•
*DAV:	Yes. •170070_170079•
        Thank goodness we didn't. •170083_170261•
*PHI:	Well it was one of those things wasn't it? •170329_170518•
*DAV:	Well it's a good job mum came. •170724_170931•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •171070_171096•
*DAV:	I hope, I hope . •171116_171224•
*PHI:	Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we weren't sure what it was. •171456_171996•
        It happened just after we went past the, just before. •171996_172267•
        You could see  er  a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards  •172320_172869•
*DAV:	I  •172869_172872•
*PHI:	the crossing. •172872_172925•
*DAV:	And and they would be police ones if they'd got blue lights and  •172966_173267•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •173337_173359•
*DAV:	did you, could you hear the sirens? •173371_173514•
*PHI:	No I couldn't. •173589_173654•
        But erm  when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened  and we went to the toy fair and then we came back  and there was er  you could see all the ambulances and everything still there. •173732_175083•
        And the train was there leaning over. •175166_175338•
*DAV:	But half of it was still on the rails. •175338_175680•
*PHI:	Yes it was the front coaches went off. •175754_175945•
*DAV:	Front coaches? •175990_176050•
*PHI:	Onto the side I think. •176050_176150•
*DAV:	Well what sort of express? •176156_176301•
*PHI:	It was erm  well what do you think it would be? •176380_176612•
*DAV:	Er  I think it must have been a multiple unit. •177023_177288•
*PHI:	That's right. •177319_177353•
        It was a diesel multiple unit. •177353_177496•
        And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters. •177496_177919•
*DAV:	Yes. •177991_178003•
        Thank goodness for that! •178097_178277•
        I wouldn't want one of those, one of the pacers or sprinters or metros spoilt. •178277_178688•
*PHI:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	But dad! •178695_178865•
        They're all multiple units  at sometimes. •178865_179173•
*PHI:	Yes, of course they are, but we, I was talking about the old sort of diesel multiple unit. •179205_179599•
*DAV:	Yes. •179604_179613•
