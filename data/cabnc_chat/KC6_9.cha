*UNK:	Hello mate. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        there's no interest! •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        Oh I phoned the er  the Sun, Today, Telegraph  the Standards  and there wasn't any interest. •_•
        They all wanted to forget Crufts they said. •_•
        So  that was nice, you know. •_•
        What else can I do? •_•
        If they don't want it  they don't want it do they? •_•
        You going up? •_•
*UNK:	Yeah. •_•
*GAV:	I suppose you got your car edition this morning did you? •_•
        Did you get  edition this morning. •_•
*UNK:	No. •_•
*GAV:	Oh! •_•

        Oh that's alright. •_•
        Oh well it's  yeah. •_•
        Well it's always gonna be your best move weren't it, I mean, you know. •_•
        He said he's sending someone up there, when they're gonna provide a series, it's gonna be too late to make anyway. •_•
        Oh well! •_•
        No, there's no, no interest at all. •_•
        I think, probably if it had been a cuter dog  the   but it's a vile dog to photograph! •_•
        Well it is innit? •_•
        You know, it doesn't exactly look cute! •_•
        Looks as if it needs a good smack! •_•
        No. •_•
        Yeah, mate, I've just got in myself  change stations but er  Richard's just talking about some kid who died from meningitis but it doesn't mean a lot these days does it? •_•
        Not unless they died under strange circumstances or   hospital or something. •_•
        Oh yes, well I'll remind him in a minute. •_•
        Is he? •_•
        Alright mate. •_•
        I'll catch you later. •_•
        Bye-bye! •_•
