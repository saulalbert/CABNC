*BRE:	Oh yeah.
*DAV:	You can have the heating on   (.) I'll   (.) I'll check it about   (.) ten minutes   (.) but if the hot water gets really, really hot   (.) then it's the thermostat   (.) and 
*BRE:	Mm.

*DAV:	And he's going to have a chat with erm   (.) one of the blokes tomorrow and he's    (.)  (        ) tomorrow afternoon   (.) but he's   (.) he's cured the water.
*BRE:	The blockage?
*DAV:	Well he's he   (.) there's a couple of a little boxes up there, little ele electronic boxes
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	and they do it   (.) electrically   (.) or you can do it manually and he's turned them round manually   (.) and now the water's coming out normal   (.) put them back to how they were
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	so he said perhaps that it there was a fault in there   (.) it's cured itself.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	Mm mm.
*BRE:	You 
*DAV:	He was go 
*BRE:	would never have known that would you?
*DAV:	No   (.) but he's said 
*JEA:	No.
*DAV:	those er   (.) he said, there's something going down the pipes, I said no   (.) cos that pipe there, you can put your finger where that pipe is now and the water's flying out.
*BRE:	Is it?
*DAV:	So   (.) it weren't nothing blocking that up.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	But what so   (.) i it does he think something from the ga cos it keep coming on and off?
*DAV:	Well he don't know cos he don't know how those, figure out how they work.
*BRE:	It's always coming on and off though innit?
*DAV:	Well I don't know, I never s stood and listened to it.
*BRE:	Yeah it's always   (.) yet if you run a tap now   (.) turn the hot tap on that'll come on 
*DAV:	You haven't got 
*BRE:	again?
*DAV:	you haven't got any hot water at the moment that's why I said   (.) that should   (.) well I would have thought he did it   (.) but you got no hot water then that should keep going until the water stops.
*BRE:	No it doesn't   (.) you run the top tap now   (.) in the kitchen, turn it off   (.) that will ignite and come on   (.) go and try it.
*DAV:	Yeah but you   (.) the thermostat on your tank is telling   (.) should be telling that that you've got a cold tank   (.) that's what thermostat's for.
*BRE:	Well no because it'll   (.) tha it doesn't work like that it takes about   (.) cos it's cold it's gonna take about an hour   (.) to warm up   (.) and that won't come on   (.) that'll just cu keep coming on and off all the time   (.) till it's hottened up.
*DAV:	Will it?
*BRE:	Yeah it won't   (.) I mean, that won't stay on for an hour   (.) I mean I've literally had a hot bath   (.) put   (.) the water on, you know,af it goes off at nine o'clock in the morning   (.) put that radiator, put that button on to reset the hot water   (.) for five minutes it's bo boilers   (.) lit up   (.) ten minutes and then it's gone off
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	and I think   (.) a but you couldn't go and have a bath cos the water will be stone cold.
*JEA:	Mm.
*DAV:	No, there's something wrong.
*BRE:	No it's always been like that.
*DAV:	Well I would never have thought of that.
*BRE:	Yes because y if you've used all your hot water   (.) you can't have that boiler going   (.) for an hour or two can you?
*DAV:	Why?
*BRE:	Cos it'll be so hot   (.) it gets so hot that boiler 
*DAV:	Well it's it's like you trying to say you're gonna boil a pan of potatoes   (.) and you've gotta keep turning it off every two minutes, cos it'll be getting too hot!
*BRE:	Well no because there's a ba pa  (.) pan of potatoes is a bit different to
*DAV:	It's not no y you using a   (.) you put a boiler in for a purpose, is to heat your water up    (.)  (        ) innit?
