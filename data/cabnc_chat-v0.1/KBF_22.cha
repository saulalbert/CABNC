        I dunno  •50555_51105•
*JEA:	Yes. •51105_51235•
*BRE:	you know I always said  wouldn't it be lovely to be thin and I said thank God  •51875_55605•
*JEA:	No! •55605_55665•
*BRE:	for a bit of fat on you! •55665_56595•
*JEA:	Oh absolutely! •56705_57695•
*BRE:	I said because •57835_58495•
*JEA:	Well I remember Jackie  telling me, she came back from  she came up to meet me in London one day and she came up with  the woman, a German woman, who at that time was  a buyer for Army and Navy  er  women's fashions  and this woman said that  the model girls  who are so thin  she said  they're always bursting into tears and crying because they're under such stress to keep their weight down  and  their boyfriends don't like it because  the girls are are lovely to have on their arms to take out, you know everybody sort of goggles, you know, lovely slim girl with yellow half way down her back etc.  but, in fact, these girls get very, very ratty! •58495_101296•
*BRE:	Mm  have you seen Jackie  lately? •101866_105446•
*JEA:	She phoned me a couple of days ago and said, you know, that life was really quite on top of them  her  mother-in-law died and they've had all the problems of putting the old man into a home  the main problem  •105446_116026•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	being of course, is first of all find your home  and while he wasn't in a home he was driving the neighbours mad because he's beginning to get confused and wander about and  maintain that he hasn't had his dinner when two people  have already taken him in lunch , you know  and the other problem is erm  er er having found him a very nice home, he didn't want to go! •116026_137706•
*BRE:	He didn't want to go? •137706_138916•
*JEA:	No  not likely! •138916_139286•
        He wanted to stay in his own place  but Jackie and Neville were nearly driven mad  running up and down to Letchworth when all that they had to do, Jackie's full time teaching and Nev is trying to build as many kitchens or build as many doors  for millionaires as he possibly can. •139286_156296•
*BRE:	So how's erm  young Neil? •156386_161186•
*JEA:	Neil  poor boy  he had a driving lesson yesterday  came home and said I don't want to do any more! •162066_173996•
*BRE:	What driving? •173996_174256•
*JEA:	Mm  so  he was going to go up to. •174256_178046•
*BRE:	I bet! •178196_178756•
*JEA:	Neil, bring cup of tea in here and we'll talk about it  and I didn't really want to spare the time because you could imagine that I wanted to get ready to come away  but I I made myself sit and really give him time •178936_192656•
*BRE:	Mm. •193396_193476•
*JEA:	and he said  he lacks, he totally lacks confidence. •193556_199716•
*BRE:	This is what he said? •199716_202296•
*JEA:	Yep  and  and he doesn't seem to be able to concentrate  and I said, but Neil you can drive, when you go out with me  you drive beautifully  yes but yours is an automatic car, I said, it's not that I said  you've got road sense  you know what you're doing, I said your good. •202446_223616•
        No I'm not I'm awful! •223616_225326•
        I said look Neil  you can drive, but let's not  let's not take it that I'm saying that you must drive  let's go into the question of why you're making a mess of it at this time  and we, oh honestly  Brenda if I've got black circles under my eyes do not be surprised because, of course, this all goes back to his absolutely, appallingly, stupid mother! •225336_246526•
*BRE:	He's really on a downer, isn't he? •246526_250456•
*JEA:	He is, he said  my mother said she could have been a forensic scientist if it if I hadn't been born! •250456_256306•
        Well Brenda  you can tell, I hit the roof ! •256586_259096•
        I mean normally I never criticize the woman because after  •259096_262676•
*BRE:	No! •262706_263346•
*JEA:	all mothers are sacred  but I just had to put the boot in on her, I'm afraid, I said  stuff! •263346_267976•
        I said she could have taken a degree in her spare time in she's only she's not yet forty  I said that's absolute rubbish I said the world is full of these damn women going around saying, if only I hadn't had children I could have been Lord Chief Justice of England, I said, it isn't true! •267986_284826•
        I said er I said do you think that I wasn't a career woman, I said I gave it all up for er to have to look after my young babies  and then when the babies were no longer young, when I  got through that phase of my life I went back and combined  looking after a home very adequately, thank you! •285216_300236•
        With quite a difficult job, I said this is a  I said your mother is living in a fantasy world, of course, I see the stupid bitch prancing around Stowmarket with her silly nose in the air! •300666_312576•
        She's a very conceited woman, Pete  the adulterous told me she was a very conceited woman  and  er Neil says I I I'd have to talk to him to him about this, she couldn't discuss anything with him  she would lay down the law, that was how it had to be  and I said no  I said Gerry and I, I had no hesitation, as I said, in putting the boot in  and Brenda and Dave  take the same the attitude to children  that  you let them  first of all when they're small, you have to tell them no  like you do not  •312576_344084•
*BRE:	That's right. •344154_345004•
*JEA:	put your handy  in the fire, dear! •345004_345744•
*BRE:	Mm. •345744_346254•
*JEA:	And then when they get bigger  you give them more and more freedom  to do just what they want to do and all you do is watch carefully and make sure they're not doing anything  obviously, outrageously daft  but you let them find themselves  and if there are problems they bring their problems to you and you sit down and you quietly talk about it, there's not shouting, no  I say you've got to do this because I am your parent! •346444_371714•
*BRE:	That's obviously her, that was her answer. •371714_375774•
*JEA:	that's her answer  yes. •375814_377474•
*BRE:	You just sort of you know, argue it  •378024_379634•
*JEA:	I know. •380154_380684•
        and and he says too  he had to admit that he's lazy. •380684_385584•
*BRE:	Who Neil? •385584_386164•
*JEA:	Neil  yeah  and he said my mother is a lazy cow! •386164_390314•
*BRE:	Yeah but don't you think he he finds, I mean if  alright you're not always exactly like your parents but if you've , if he's brought up, his mother's lazy •390314_400474•
*JEA:	Yeah. •401574_401724•
*BRE:	so I mean  you know, that's part of his life isn't it? •401844_405394•
*JEA:	Yes. •405394_405574•
*BRE:	I mean it's he won't know better. •405574_407004•
*JEA:	This is what I said to him  this is what I said to him  but he said I I see you with all your get up and go  so I didn't make any reply to that. •407004_415394•
*BRE:	No. •415414_415604•
*JEA:	I thought, well  let it sink in. •415604_417614•
*BRE:	That's right. •417614_418554•
*JEA:	And I came in one day  a few days ago and running around like a  bee on heat  with erm  cries of oh  I've got so much to do and no time left in which to do it and I went  ha  I said yes, if you  got up early, you know ! •418554_435484•
*BRE:	That's right  he cos he is very bad on timing isn't he? •435674_439084•
*JEA:	Shocking! •439084_439204•
*BRE:	I mean, like you say, you ought  you know  you ought to buy her a talking alarm clock for Christmas. •439204_445014•
*JEA:	Oh yes, he's got to  have an alarm clock. •445014_448484•
*BRE:	Or a radio one  •448804_449464•
*JEA:	Yes. •450334_450514•
*BRE:	so that would actually •452294_453064•
*JEA:	Yes. •453384_453514•
*BRE:	the noise. •453514_454064•
*JEA:	Of course, I've I've left him in the charge of  of not  I haven't asked Paul to take him  under his wing over the weekend, but I've left Neil a list of things that I would like done. •454664_464804•
*BRE:	Mm. •464804_464894•
*JEA:	Like get back the dustbins which  took them out  but she didn't bring them back at the end of the drive  erm  and I hope that Paul  tells him off! •464894_475364•
*BRE:	And make him do it, do it. •475464_480084•
*JEA:	and you know, says, look Neil you've got to get your ideas together  because that's what Neil has lacked, he's lacked  masculine influence. •480084_486424•
*BRE:	Mm    •486804_486964•
*JEA:	It's no good  •486974_488764•
*BRE:	now, I mean  you've been very to Neil  over the last year or so  and I mean now it's time to get his act together. •488764_496754•
*JEA:	Oh yes. •496754_497044•
*BRE:	She can't keep on •497044_498144•
*JEA:	No. •498144_498224•
*BRE:	I mean •498284_498564•
*JEA:	I mean I've stopped  I've  I I don't any longer get up and get anybody's breakfast for them. •498744_502644•
*BRE:	Nope  but if you get, you know  •502984_504384•
*JEA:	I get out  I get out of bed at eight o' clock when the  last of the lodgers has gone  well the last of the  two lodgers  •504384_511494•

*JEA:	er of being unemployed the Neil is the third lodger, of course who  get's out of the pit  at about eleven o' clock in the morning ! •517194_524674•
*BRE:	Mm. •525394_525454•
*JEA:	But er that's  from now on Neil has got to carry the responsibility for his own actions. •525574_532954•
*BRE:	That's right. •533054_533724•
*JEA:	I'm not going to bail him out by jumping into the car. •533724_536374•
*BRE:	And really he's got to, I mean, you know, alright with work wise  I mean he's got to take  even if, I mean  the kids these days, I mean, even at Neil's age, I mean  you know, I've come the conclusion now  these kids  they think the world owes them something! •536374_554134•
*JEA:	Yes they do. •554204_554934•
*BRE:	They're not like in our day •554934_556364•

*JEA:	No. •587994_588224•
*BRE:	I said you're the general dogsbody! •588224_589614•
*JEA:	Quite  quite. •589614_590144•
*BRE:	He said oh God! •590224_591644•

*JEA:	That's the way life goes  •592904_593684•
*BRE:	you know I said that is life! •593684_594784•
*JEA:	Yeah  mm. •594784_595144•
*BRE:	He said, God, he said  I didn't realize it's like that, I said, no you didn't! •595364_598524•
*JEA:	Do you do you think they get a false idea from the television or something,what is it? •598584_602694•
*BRE:	Well I dunno I I think the teachers to be honest, Jean, no you  •603064_605654•
*JEA:	Ah! •605984_606214•
*BRE:	know  the teachers in this  I mean  you know I don't know, I mean  some of the teachers have got  got really weird ideas! •606214_613204•
*JEA:	Have they? •613754_614464•
*BRE:	I mean, you know,it's unbelievable! •614464_617104•
        But •617494_617714•
*JEA:	Ooh I'd like to know what their weird ideas are. •617724_621004•
*BRE:	Well it's just erm  ah I don't know, I mean  there's there's certain things  I mean,it's like this maths   I mean, I I spoke to her  erm  and she said yes Lee had come on and everything in his maths  and I said the thing is, I said, knowing Lee has difficulty  in in in the high level maths, yes you don't want to drop him, but  surely  I said I'm willing to help  in my spare time, Lee's willing to do it and I said  can't you show Lee  I said I'm not  I wasn't trying to tell her •621004_654484•
*JEA:	No. •654944_655014•
*BRE:	you know, that what you were told  •655014_656284•
*JEA:	No, no, no, no  no  •656284_656764•
*BRE:	and I think   •656764_657244•
*JEA:	Yes well I think I told him a wrong, you see, there were two  there there are two ways of tackling it and I don't think the way I told him is what they want for the examination purposes, at all! •657304_665624•
*BRE:	Oh I don't know  he , when  you that told he understood it a lot more  than when she said it  and she sort of went all  •666484_675694•
*JEA:	She's probably trying to explain them in a very complicated way of doing maths. •675844_678984•
*BRE:	No she answered me, she said well I haven't got time to sit down, explain it to them, they just gotta, if they're in a high level they should be able to grasp it and I  •678984_685834•
*JEA:	Frankly I think that's very bad  •685834_686874•
*BRE:	that's no attitude! •686884_687584•
*JEA:	you know, that is no attitude! •687594_689704•
        That's bad! •689914_690334•
*BRE:	You know the fact is they've got to  erm  be explained. •690334_692084•
*JEA:	Yes. •692084_692244•
*BRE:	Erm  I mean, Carla I can't fault her teachers. •692244_696484•
*JEA:	No, no  •696544_696954•
*BRE:	at that church one  she has learnt so much  erm  I mean this  to speak French, now she speaking it in three weeks! •696954_704234•
*JEA:	She's excellent isn't she  yes. •704674_706284•
*BRE:	You know, it's  •706294_707244•
*JEA:	Three weeks! •707394_707534•
*BRE:	three weeks, that's all she's been doing it. •707574_709154•
*JEA:	That's marvellous. •709174_709624•
*BRE:	You know, I mean  but this teacher won't stand no nonsense  and I said to Lee  you were at it three years before you could speak like Carla speaks it! •709634_717934•
        You know she has learnt so much! •718154_720874•
        Erm in this school, I mean  •720874_724024•
*JEA:	Yes. •724474_724554•
*BRE:	they're very strict  I mean  •724554_725884•
*JEA:	Yes. •725884_725924•
*BRE:	you know  but I think half of Lee's it  there's no discipline •725924_728924•
*JEA:	No ha •729184_729804•
*BRE:	but then •731434_731904•
*JEA:	and when you try in the past when I tried to find some way  of imposing discipline, there is no way because  quite rightly, you're not allowed to strike children, I never wanted to and I  I hardly ever did  at one school where  there was a marvellous spirit of give and take  I used to whip off my little black velvet slipper occasionally and whack some of the larger boys about the top of the thigh. •731904_757234•
        just for fun, you know  but I'm not a believer in using your fists, you ought to be using your brain to teach with  but  there were no  there are no sanctions, if you say  you must stay behind after school, you have to send a letter home  and half the parents will write back and say my son or daughter is not staying after school and that is that! •757294_777454•
*BRE:	Mm. •777454_777674•
*JEA:	And that's their right  and so  you think of something else you're not allowed to take them out of a favourite lesson, you're not allowed to say  you are going to miss your football or a P E  P E teachers and the football teachers, quite rightly, say  if you can't keep discipline in your class why   why should we be penalized ? •777674_796364•
*BRE:	Mm  that's right. •796624_797824•
*JEA:	And er  you're pretty helpless really. •797834_800594•
*BRE:	You are. •800594_801414•
*JEA:	You see the only way that you can really discipline them  is when you have a school where  the rules have been very, very strict from the moment that they went into that school  and they have had their noses held to the grindstone  with work up to their brows  and they just don't think of being tiresome  and anybody who is tiresome is pulled out and put in a special room on their own, called a sin bin  which is rather boring  and made to work even  harder! •801464_827364•
*BRE:	Mm  but no what I'm  sort of, getting back, I mean, you know, I don't  I think it's the kids  I mean, I dunno why? •827674_835884•
        Whether they have too much or what they have  but, I mean  they're just  they just think everybody owes them something, and it's like Neil, I mean, to me  I mean  I can't see why he can't get off his backside  and go and work in a supermarket  but it's not the job they want, the same answer I said to  •835884_852834•

*BRE:	Mm. •867104_867604•
*JEA:	and he isn't  in my opinion  really considering half the other jobs, but he has said that he wants that  and by the mercy of providence  this business of Lee being flung out by Andy  and being  put back onto the  into the job centre coincides with my being  very tight on money. •867704_887804•
*BRE:	Mm. •888004_888204•
*JEA:	You'll notice that I've said to you  we're going to run the . •888204_891864•

        Yes if I need the money. •967614_968884•
*JEA:	The  the only job which I told Neil I do not expect him to take  is working for  waste disposal  because he did that, this time last year  and before he started he was full of big talk about you make a lot of money and you get a lot of tips at Christmas  he found that  you do not make a lot of money  and you do not get generous tips at Christmas •969274_991194•
*BRE:	Mm. •991194_991514•
*JEA:	and he used to come home  looking as white as a sheet  sick to the teeth  and he used to just go to bed and collapse in a heap, he isn't strong enough to do it and it's pointless for him to try  but other than that he can do anything he fancies. •991514_100563•

*JEA:	Mm. •113335_113343•
*BRE:	this isn't fair, I mean life's not fair. •113345_113528•

*BRE:	Yeah  probably  yeah that does •113781_113938•
