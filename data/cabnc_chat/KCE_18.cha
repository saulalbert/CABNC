@Comment:	conversation #18 (Tape 029702)
*DAV:	They came in today to give us this talk about kind of er, kind of erm, money we're gonna get, whatever today, you know, like they said about the Poll Tax 
*SCO:	You want one on , you want one on
*HEL:	Eh?
*DAV:	said here about the Poll Tax
*SCO:	What it say?
*DAV:	Well it was with every community charge benefits and everything
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	said, said that at the moment we're paying   (.) twenty per cent, twenty per cent er Poll Tax   (.) erm   (.) we're on about thirty five pound a week, the full grant, that's how much we get you know if you level it out you know
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	get the full grant
*DAV:	Yeah, well, like you know, the full the grant is two thousand whatever
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	two thousand whatever, not you're saying that parents subsidize that, you know
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	whatever you, whatever your grant is whether it's eight hundred pounds, parents subsidize that up to the two thousand whatever
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	erm, up to the grant status, and then everybody should be on two, er thirty er thirty six pound a week out of that's got to come everything you've got, everything you've got to pay for to drink, whatever
*HEL:	Mm  (.) 
*DAV:	and erm   (.) like I said up to about, up to about two years ago you could claim housing benefit with which you could pay your rent, and that was a great help to students you know, but now that's been stopped, but you don't get anything like that, so you've got thirty five pound a week to pay for food, rent, community charge, everything
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	right, you should of seen the look on everybody's face
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	like you just, they just went, oh and but I think it's finally, I mean I was in the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	about how much it's, you know what a struggle it is, yeah 
*HEL:	Well you knew, cos we told you 
*DAV:	I knew what it was 
*HEL:	what you get 
*DAV:	but everybody thinks that it's gonna be easy
*HEL:	Yeah because they think they're going to get more, don't they?Or they thought they were   (.) and the only people they're going to get any more from is the parents, nowhere else, nobody else is going to give them anything   (.) I've got no illusions about it, I don't expect you to get anything from anywhere else, and I know that you, you wouldn't get anything from anywhere else   (.) because they, they've cut it, they've cut it to the bone and the only people that can afford to go now and to live in   (.) anything like
*DAV:	A decent
*HEL:	Yeah, is people who have got rich parents.
*DAV:	It's like Jane her, her mum and dad, her, her dad's rich, they're er is rich is oh er
*HEL:	Lives at Bromsground?
*DAV:	Yeah
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	he's oh, oh
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	and Claire said to me oh well Labour if Labour get in we'll get, we'll get a, you know, we'll be much better off, we'll get a much better grant, er Jane goes but oh we'll get, we'll get every erm, my mum and dad will get loads of other things er dad, I won't be able to pay for it, I goes well no because you probably get, you get the housing benefit back
*SCO:	You won't get better grants, you won't though, cos it won't have time to work through
*HEL:	No it might, it might 
*DAV:	But you will do 
*HEL:	be the year after
*DAV:	Yeah
*SCO:	Yeah, well for the last year 
*DAV:	but I think 
*HEL:	I think, I think actually, I think they will try to do something actually because if they, if they do away with the loans thing
*SCO:	Yeah
*HEL:	they'll have to try do something won't they?
*SCO:	I know the way, I know, but 
*HEL:	To be honest
*SCO:	you don't, it's not going to be you
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SCO:	just because you vote for Labour 
*HEL:	oh no, no it's not no
*DAV:	No I mean of course not 
*SCO:	and then they can't say alright, oh students give them hundred pound a week, he give them none, give them none 
*HEL:	no, they can't do that because of the state of the economy 
*SCO:	and then if 
*DAV:	I know that, but 
*SCO:	You've got to be realistic like ain't you?
*DAV:	but surely, but surely   (.) I mean surely they'll be able to restore the housing benefit
*HEL:	Well hopefully they'll be able to do something
*DAV:	Well it says in that, in that thing I've got they're gonna restore a fair system of grants
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	of grants, that's, that's the thing I looked at, it didn't say a fair grant
*HEL:	No
*DAV:	it said grants
*SHE:	Yeah
*DAV:	so   (.) I mean even if they don't bring in, oh the housing benefit
*HEL:	But I mean
*DAV:	they'll bring in something a housing grant 
*HEL:	you know, I mean, on 
*SCO:	to, to my, to my mind, when 
*HEL:	on April the tenth they're not going to be able to go
*SHE:	No when they hear it all day 
*HEL:	oh, you know, that's, that's it because for thirteen years they have dismantled the social system, that's what they've done in thirteen years, so they can't say overnight, we'll put it all back because there isn't, there, there isn't the finance there because they've spent it all to have done what they've done
*SHE:	Yeah
*HEL:	because they've sold everything off like gas and electricity and everything and all the resources they've got for it they've spent, to supplement everything else, so the money won't be there, and, and the income from the electricity and that isn't going to the Government it's going to private enterprise
*DAV:	Yeah
*HEL:	so, so it's not gonna be there, and unfortunately it's going to take a while, because we're in such a deep recession and recession is bad, and it's not getting any better
*DAV:	Yeah it won't
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	any more
*SCO:	What
*HEL:	It, it'll take a long time before it starts to buck up.
*SCO:	Why, why do they say, that for the election it will take them three or four years to put, whatever they promise into operation?
*HEL:	Yeah, to put it right, to start to put it right 
*DAV:	Well they're they're education promises are, we'll do this within two years, we'll do this within 
*SCO:	Yeah 
*DAV:	three years
*HEL:	yeah well I mean they'll want to and they've got 
*SCO:	within three years you're leaving 
*HEL:	Yeah, but they've got
*SHE:	They've got to help people like me but I don't know 
*HEL:	they've got to try and show 
*SCO:	what, you shouldn't think 
*HEL:	that they are doing something 
*DAV:	You should just you this is what I'm trying to tell 
*SCO:	you shouldn't think what's it going to do to me 
*DAV:	this is what I'm trying to tell everybody at school, you shouldn't be thinking oh, how's it gonna effect me, what I'll do if 
*SCO:	No 
*HEL:	No because you should help, think of a society as whole 
*DAV:	because, that, this is, the , I said to this kid the other day, he goes oh, like Ian was arguing with them when I went in
*SCO:	Yeah
*DAV:	and he was going oh all what the Tories haven't done for you, and he goes and what are Labour gonna do for us?I goes well they'll improve the grant to start off with, he goes well it won't be in time to benefit us, I goes well you shouldn't just be thinking about yourself
*HEL:	No 
*SCO:	No that's the trouble with people
*HEL:	Yeah
*DAV:	They're just, they're just bothered about, about themselves 
*SHE:	Everyone, everyone thinks of themselves, it's like on their, all them people who are under that certain amount, they're all gonna be going oh well in here
*SCO:	Yeah
*SHE:	we'll vote for them, then
*SCO:	Yeah
*SHE:	and people do that don't they?
*DAV:	Well it's like , it's like Richard  today, he goes well what, well what are Labour gonna do for us?So I goes well, they'll probably, they'll probably erm   (.) er give better grants and restore erm, er housing benefit of sorts, whatever happens 
*HEL:	Well is he going to university?
*DAV:	Yeah
*HEL:	What doing?
*DAV:	Dunno  ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	or something, and, he goes
*HEL:	But the only, I think the only course he'll pass is mucking about course, let's see who can muck about for the next three years the most.
*SHE:	I can't understand it, they've got to have a decent grade to go to university, but they seem to think that they can get in on D's and E's, if he gets D's and E's, he's not going anywhere, except to work 
*DAV:	No, I, I wouldn't I wouldn't expect it, I reckon 
*SHE:	because I mean, because
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SCO:	come on
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*SHE:	He ain't, because to me you, you not got, you're wasting your time 
*HEL:	Stupid innit?If you haven't got, if you haven't got enough discipline to get a good grade in your O levels
*SHE:	in school then you're not 
*HEL:	then you no way gonna have enough discipline to get any sort of grade at university 
*SHE:	because you live in 
*SCO:	That's for the testing innit?
*SHE:	Yeah, because, I mean you're living at home when your doing A levels, you, you haven't even got 
*HEL:	And you got 
*SHE:	the discipline of your parents to say get up there and do something have you?
*SCO:	No
*DAV:	But some people don't, Adeleine got that, his parents don't tell him to get on with it, half, half the people at school they got that  (.) 
*SHE:	Well if I didn't, I mean I don't think, you do enough either of you do enough, but in, you know I mean 
*HEL:	Do you know what I was talking to Nicola
*SHE:	I don't care what other people do I'm saying I don't think you 
*DAV:	So, so what kind 
*SHE:	do enough either of you 
*DAV:	so what kind of time have I got at the moment?
*SCO:	No, you ain't got
*SHE:	Well I know you're doing that, but you still got 
*DAV:	Yeah, but 
*SHE:	to find time to do your work because your exams are still going to be on the same day aren't they?
*DAV:	I know , I'm doing my work at school, I've, but
*SCO:	I know you ain't got a lot of time now, it's, I mean they, when, it's important to, that's just important to do what you're doing now actually, because there's, yeah 
*SHE:	Well yes I know it is, but the exams are still on the same day 
*SCO:	breaks
*SHE:	so you've got to find time to do the 
*SCO:	How?
