@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 002006)
*CHR:	Thank you for getting this tomato juice specially from Safeway's. (.)  
*NOR:	When I go on half term I ought to   (  ) all things. Actually has been rather  (  )  
*CHR:	What? Just not enough, (  ) happening? 
*NOR:	Break. 
*CHR:	Enough break yes. That's right. 
*NOR:	 (  ) organized. Not enough change in your rate. (  )  
*CHR:	Yeah. 
*NOR:	I feel clearer in my mind about   (  ) which is a help. And I don't feel clear of things to do which is very miserable  (  )  
*CHR:	Well you're not doing your reports till after that time are you? 
*NOR:	No they have to be in by the twenty sixth of June. And the ten days after open day are going to be   (.) mad. 
*CHR:	Twenty six days, yes, ten days. You've got sixteen days to do them in in theory. 
*NOR:	Well I won't have really will I if  (  )  
*CHR:	Is that the earlier day you all complained about? 
*NOR:	 (  ) three days on. And we asked for an extra   (.) ten days. At the moment we've got three. 
*CHR:	Did you get any explanations why it was all required in earlier? 
*NOR:	No. She just feels she wanted the time to do it in her time.  (  ) calling the tune. As long as you don't do it too often. Don't do it too often just call the tune without justifying it. People get a bit resentful. 
*CHR:	Yes.  (.) Do you think that in all schools the head always looked at all the reports? 
*NOR:	 (10.0) When I was at school they hadn't signed them.  (  ) every school   (  ) signed them.  (10.0) I suspect Mrs   feels she ought to be signing them not the  (  )  
*CHR:	 (  ) . That pot's finished now.  (.) What a funny idea this queue down   (  ) parks isn't it? 
*NOR:	Some people obviously overdo it. 
*CHR:	Mm.  (.) Did you see that    (.)  (  ) thing on television last night? 
*NOR:	 (  ) got their hats back. (.)  
*CHR:	I'm interested there were women mixed in with them. Just the same uniform. 
*NOR:	I didn't notice that. 
*CHR:	Look at this lovely picture of this High Commissioner in Sri Lanka who's been booted out in his Morris Minor. Somebody is about to set up 
*NOR:	Who pays? 
*CHR:	 (  ) convertible by the look of it, still. Mm about to set up a factory in Sri Lanka to make Morris Minor parts. To rebuild them. (.)  
*NOR:	Will they find him another job now? What do they do then then? 
*CHR:	Well he's employed by the Foreign Office. 
*NOR:	Mm. So will they send him somewhere else? 
*CHR:	Probably. Or they'll keep him in London. Sri Lankan desk or something. 
*NOR:	Wonder what happened to  (  ) .  (.) after Washington. 
*CHR:	He'll   (.) probably merge back into the Department of Transport. Might do something else in the environment. 
*NOR:	Oh there was some talk of   (.) going somewhere else. 
*CHR:	Oh was there? 
*NOR:	Mm. Well I mean, not an offer but 
*CHR:	They would like to. Mm. 
*NOR:	I don't know if  (  ) , but it's on the cards that one could. 
*CHR:	Oh. Roy's idea was that er might get some highly paid job in industry. Aviation or something. (.)  
*NOR:	Are you making more toast? 
*CHR:	Oh yes, yes I shall. Gosh I'm not thinking straight. I'll make some more. 
*NOR:	 (  ) bit addictive with this at times. That's why I try  (  ) . 
*CHR:	It's, it's sitting down that's addictive is it? Not having breakfast. 
*NOR:	Having breakfast when you're sitting down. You don't actually 
*CHR:	You mean you might get into a good habit? (.)  
*NOR:	 (  ) late to school. 
*CHR:	I must say I like it. (10.0)  
*NOR:	I'll tell you what.  (.) Erm   (.) go without lunch to make up for it. 
*CHR:	To make up for what? My having my normal breakfast? 
*NOR:	Oh it's just me that's got to give up lunch is it? 
*CHR:	Well you could actually have two meals today, for a change. 
*NOR:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	 (  ) . That, that special orange and something honey marmalade. 
*NOR:	Oh, the gift one. Sweet orange marmalade with cider in. It was sweet wasn't it? 
*CHR:	It was sweet, but it was pleasant. 
*NOR:	Couldn't taste the cider could you? 
*CHR:	No. You rarely can can you? 
*NOR:	My home-made of three years ago. 
*CHR:	Oh yes. Good, good and solid. 
*NOR:	Thick, thick marmalade. 
*CHR:	Nice. 
*NOR:	A bit thick. 
*CHR:	I like it, like that. I think Lizzie's marmalade was particularly addictive. 
*NOR:	Oh I did, mm, I liked that. Nice bitter flavour. Mm. 
*CHR:	We haven't tried Jack's have we? 
*NOR:	 (  ) Jack? 
*CHR:	Well he's never given us a pot   (.) mean devil. 
*NOR:	Oh I see, I thought. 
*CHR:	It's about the one thing a year he does do and crows about. 
*NOR:	Well I expect his family dispose of it nicely for him. I'm sure Andrew 
*CHR:	Oh yes, yes I do believe he's given Andrew a pot to take home. He's still as daft about Andrew as ever isn't he? 
*NOR:	Yes. It shows a little bit, not in Jack, I don't mean in Jack I mean in Andrew. Although Andrew's twenty eight. 
*CHR:	It shows in both of them. I mean Jack was so solicitous that 
*NOR:	Yeah. 
*CHR:	weekend towards Andrew. And he and I had   (.) oops   (.) er   (.) had earlier talked about people, no that's fine, that's fine I like the crust, erm parking on verges and I was decrying it. Of course when we came back and discovered Andrew and co had arrived, he'd parked on the verge and I   (.) had a dig at Andrew about it. Jack was terribly defensive of him. You know totally changed his tune from earlier  ((laugh)) . Andrew can do no wrong. 
*NOR:	Well it's better that way round than the other. 
*CHR:	Oh you mean the way I treat Snoopy? 
*NOR:	That's not what I mean at all.  (.)  (  ) . No but it's better to have er parents who think highly of their kids even if slightly mistakenly 
*CHR:	Mm. 
*NOR:	than decry them. Run them down. 
*CHR:	Mm. (30.0)  
*NOR:	The lupin's coming out. 
*CHR:	Oh yes so it is. We've got two more down there, which are looking very healthy. (8.0)  (  )
