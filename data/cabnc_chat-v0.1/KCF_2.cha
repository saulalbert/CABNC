@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 028002)
*ALI:	Yeah but I'm saying they're not paying  they haven't gotta pay for that machine. •572042_578132•
*HER:	Who hasn't gotta pay for the machine? •578132_579322•
*ALI:	Well if they're doing, somebody by hand's doing it, they haven't got that  of paying for that machine. •579322_589152•
*HER:	Yeah but  the machine could do what a hundred people could do in a day, can't it? •589622_595132•
        The machine doesn't get tired like people do. •595362_597862•
*ALI:	Yeah but I mean •597942_599782•
*HER:	The the machine only goes off bad if somebody hasn't been maintaining it. •599902_604742•
        And all you've gotta do is, with machine is put petrol or diesel or whatever it is to make  and check all the oil  •606242_612142•
*ALI:	And   •613362_613492•
*HER:	I know  but  that offsets  the labour is the, labour is the thing that costs a fortune. •613492_627552•
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	Yeah. •628242_628392•
*ALI:	Well why don't you do it all before  and   •628392_633122•
*HER:	Well they do. •633122_634352•
        and they've got it in but  it wants it at different times doesn't it? •634352_638272•
        So you can't give it fertiliser. •638272_640222•
*ALI:	Well I still think that  well say you have a big massive thing and, and say it'd take  a hundred people  mm er I suppose the bigger it is the more economical it is. •640222_652272•
        But if you only had a small place it'd be more economical to have labour than it would to buy  paying out thousands of pounds for machines and  •652272_667042•
*HER:	No you don't buy the, they come round and do it for you don't they? •667042_669322•
*ALI:	Well alright then   •669462_672292•
*HER:	You hire it for a day  or whatever it is. •672292_675322•
        It costs  just say for instance two hundred pounds for the tractor and, and his sprayer  and er the chemicals on top. •675362_684972•
        That's done your whole field  big field. •684982_688852•
        Now that two hundred pound will only pay one man for a  for a week  to do the same thing. •690552_700882•
        And he's gotta do it a few times, so then the cost becomes  and, and you  like let's be fair, we've had summers where it's  the weeds er the weeds haven't grown, but you get a wet summer  and the weather warms and the wet and the weeds go peooow up like that. •700882_723072•
        So that's, and then it doesn't  stops  •723072_725502•
*ALI:	Well alright then, why can't he put bark on it ? •728592_736812•
*HER:	Well that, it costs. •742282_742752•
*ALI:	from everywhere. •745662_748972•
        Do it that way. •749042_750142•
*HER:	But it's still costs isn't it? •751162_751842•
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	Well then if you put a lot of bark on it  and with vegetables, so they want  fertilizer  •751912_760622•
*ALI:	Well   •762172_762262•
*HER:	 (        )
