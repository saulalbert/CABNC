*PS0E8:	Well I do n't know whether you go home from boarding school you probably just have a day off I do n't know I have n't been to boarding school Right were do we get sharp words The spider affair as it was called went all over the school before the day was out it caused a great deal of laughter When mother Mams Arougeaye heard of it she sneered To think that a French woman should be so foolish she said though I did n't like spiders or earwigs or moths or even snakes Mams Audyponch should be ashamed to make her exhibition of herself The first form talked about it more than any one else of course they squealed with laughter when they saw the poor Mary Lou Manselle and Gwendoline all falling victims to the same spider jolly clever spider said Irene it means the only three people in the form that it that would be scared of it I take my hat off to that spider ca n't think why it chose my desk said Mary Lou no that was a shame said Gwendoline poor Mary Lou it must of been an awful shock for you when you saw it I wonder who put it there There was a silence for the first time it occurred to first form that the spider might of been put there on purpose they looked at one another It was a dirty trick to put it into to poor Mary Lou 's desk said Jean she ca n't help being scared of things I suppose she almost jumped out of her skin when she saw it I should of thought any joker in our form would of been decent enough to popped it into say Alicia 's desk not if it happened to be Alicia who popped it in said a sly voice you do so love playing tricks do n't you Alicia You and Daryl where in the first form room before afternoon school and I 'm sure we 'll all remember you saying you 'd like to put a spider down Mary Lou 's neck It was Gwendoline speaking Alicia glanced at her well I did n't do it she says nor did Daryl sorry to disappoint you darling Gwendoline Mary but we just did n't if it was any one I should think it was you Mary Lou 's my friend said Gwendoline I would n't do that to her Well if you 've almost drowned her one week I should think you could quite well bring yourself to put a spider in her desk the next week said Daryl It 's pretty funny that you and Alicia were the only ones in the classroom before afternoon school persisted Gwendoline angry that no one seemed to agree with her suggestion Shut up said Catherine shortly we know it was n't Daryl or Alicia because they say so The spider must of got in there by accident and that 's that Well I think began Gwendoline that the class took at once Be quite Gwendoline Gwendoline shut up shut up Gwendoline Gwendoline shut up There was nothing to do but to shut up Gwendoline was sulking exasperated It had been such a good idea and all that had resulted from it was a double punishment for her and a complete failure to make anyone believe to Alicia or Daryl had played the trick True the first formers had had to go to bed an hour earlier but they all voted it was worth it Gwendoline felt vicious about the whole affair she 'd determining not to be put off by her first day there .  1774213_1948563
*PS0E9:	What erm hours early .  1949393_1951243
*PS0E8:	She did She determine not to be put off by her first failure but to go on doing things to Mary Lou so that in the end the class would have to put the tricks down to Alicia and Daryl She thought she would also hint to Miss Potts that Alicia and Daryl were at the bottom of things but she did n't get very far with this she had to go and see Miss Potts about some returned homework She stood very neatly beside her in the little room that Miss Potts shared with Mams Audiponde at North Tower Miss Potts I was awfully sorry about that spider affair the other day she began of course Alicia and Daryl were in the classroom before hand I 'm sure they know something about it I heard Alicia say Miss Potts looked up are you trying to sneak she said or in more polite language to tell tales because if so do n't try it on me At the boarding school I went to Gwendoline we had a very good punishment for sneaks all the girls in the sneak dormy gave her one good spank with the back of a hair brush You may have a lot of interesting things to tell me but it 's no use expecting me to listen I wonder if the girls here out the same punishment for sneaks I must ask them Gwendoline went flaming red as sneaks fancy Miss Potts daring to call her that Gwendoline Mary Lacy a sneak all because she just wanted to drop a kindly hint Gwendoline did n't no what to say she felt as if she 'd like to burst into tears but Miss Potts always got very impatient with girls who did that She went out of the room longing to slam the door as she often did at home but she did n't dare to here She felt very sorry for herself if her mother new what an awful school she 'd come to she would take her away at once Miss Winter too would be horrified But Gwendoline was n't quite so sure about her father he can say things at times very like Miss Potts said The week went by it was a very pleasant week hot with a cool breeze that made games and swimming even more pleasant than usual Alicia and Betty were practising hard for the school sport both were excellent swimmers and divers .  1951243_2058723
