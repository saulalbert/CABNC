*DON:	There could be no doubt in the mind of John that Jesus had been sent by God. •37725_88825•
*DON:	So what happened when Jesus was thirty years old? •112525_145125•
*DON:	Erm  he erm, he he went to John the Baptist to baptize, to ask him to be baptized  •152025_239025•
*DON:	Yeah that's right, very good, so nine,by pouring out this holy spirit and Jesus, Jehovah was er knighting him or appointing him to be the king of this coming kingdom, thing thus have anointed with the spirit, Jesus became the Messiah , which words in the Hebrew and Greek languages mean appoint, a anointed, therefore he became in fact Jesus Christ or Jesus the United, so, so it was Apostle Peter spoke of Jesus who was from Nazareth, Nazareth, how about anointed them, but all the spirit and power, also by his baptism and water, Jesus was presenting himself to God, to carry out the work that God had sent him to earth to do, what was that important work? •245825_869125•
        So mine asks when did Jesus in fact become Christ? •869125_917525•
        And why then? •918025_957025•

*DON:	That's right as you say  •118782_120282•
*DON:	Yeah  •120282_120342•
*DON:	So  when a person gets baptized then, what, what, they're dedicating themselves to do God's will aren't they? •121862_129172•
*DON:	Yes, to carry out God's work, yes •129172_131222•
*DON:	Were you, have, have you been baptized? •131252_133722•
