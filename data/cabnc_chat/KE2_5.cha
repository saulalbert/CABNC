*LUC:	 ((reading book))Elizabeth had won the essay competition and was just about to stand up when Jessica got up   (.) and she walked   (.) up to Mr    (.) and she asked   (.) and he asked her what magazine she wanted for the year   (.) and she said Rock Seventeen   (.) Jessica knew what magazine Elizabeth wanted and she just said Rock Seventeen.Then she had to stay behind and got Jessica's detention   (.) and was late for her next lesson   (.) and got another   (.) detention   (.) for running in the main building.But the trouble was they were both at the same time after school where she was meant to be decorating the hall for the disco after school that night.Then, she got Jessica's C for her cooking class instead of the A Jessica got off hers.But, after school she went to her detention with Mr    (.) and course, the note said   (.) going to the dentist, sudden toothache.So she went to   (.) her other detention and there was another note saying, had to pick up my child from school.So, she went to decorate the hall and got sent out with people saying   (.) she was Jessica. (        )  (.) Elizabeth slammed the kitchen door and dropped her   (.) bag.What's wrong said Jessica?So Elizabeth told her everything that had happened today   (.) and after half an hour they decided to tell everyone what the  (.) they had done at the disco that night.So that night, at the disco   (.) they told them and at last they believed them   (.) and sorted out the magazine thing and changed the magazine to   (.) Mysteries from Around the World.And then, they changed the cookery marks.And Jessica said, I'll race to the cake   (.) and the twins were back to normal  [] .
*TER:	Mm!Now   (.) right!Well I am going to have to look at them both.And see if I, I like them both.There's, there's a lot of work gone into those  (        ) .Erm   (.) i if I'm honest I think I found   (.) Holly's easier to understand   (.) on a first reading   (.) but that may be because I think perhaps read it.Perhaps, in a slightly more clearer way than you did.That doesn't mean that yours isn't as good.So I, what I want to do now, and I have do eve  (.) take time to do it, I can't do it just now when you're here.But I want to look at them both   (.) and I will go through them as well and mark them for spelling and for   (.) for your punctuation and everything else.But, really you both put a tremendous amount of work in!They're great!
*LUC:	Can I just say something?
*TER:	Yeah.
*LUC:	Cos, didn't gonna say   (.) know when Jessica   (.) got up   (.) cos I've got pretend   (.) erm got up   (.) for the erm 
*TER:	So what's it?What is it?It's April Fool.
*LUC:	Yeah, it's April Fool's 
*TER:	Yeah.
*LUC:	day.Er, what they do, every year they switch identities e , Jessica pretends to be Elizabeth, and Elizabeth pretends to be Jessica   (.) but, this year they don't do that cos tha all their friends like know   (.) and, this year cos their teachers and things still think that they're erm   (.) so , they swapped identities they like, give detention and things to the wrong people and   (.) stuff like that.And, when Jessica gets up to do   (.) get the magazine it's cos Mr  told her but course she thought it was Je , erm Elizabeth but she wa wasn't   (.) so
*TER:	What's D T?
*LUC:	That's detention.
*TER:	She went to her detention, I see!Right.
*LUC:	So we just sort of say   (        ) essay, D T to show what I mean.
*TER:	Yeah.Well   (.) well yes we used to get   (.) used to get detention, yes, but erm   (.) the thing we used to get more than anything else   (.) was pink paper.
*HOL:	Mm?
*LUC:	Did you have to take it home to your parents?
*TER:	Pink paper
*LUC:	To show that you've 
*TER:	was 
*LUC:	been naughty?
*TER:	Pink paper was a foolscap sheet of paper like   (        ) like that
*HOL:	Mm.
*TER:	but it was pink!
*LUC:	Pink!
*TER:	And if you had to do   (.) if you had, say, three sheets of pink paper because you've been naughty and done something wrong, you had to fill three sides of pink foolscap paper with writing.You might have to write an essay or you do copy writing on the pa , do three sheets of pink paper, you had to three sheets of writing!And it was pink paper   (.) and at the top it had space for your parent's signature so that when you've done the work your parents had to 
*HOL:	Mm.
*TER:	sign it so they'd know if you'd had pink paper.
*LUC:	What erm 
*TER:	That was the, that was the worst, that was the pink paper, and then 
*LUC:	what we normally have to do.
*TER:	you got   (.) yo would have to take and hour or take two hours, or take three hours and if you take up to three hours   (.) or if you got three separate hours   (.) that was detention   (.) and if we were in our in the junior part of the school   (.) in the first three forms   (.) erm, you then had to go into school on Saturday morning.In the senior school we had to go into school Saturday morning anyway!
*HOL:	And you had Wednesday 
*TER:	We we 
*HOL:	afternoon off.
*TER:	No, we didn't!We we worked   (.) Monday to Saturday 
*HOL:	Our when my 
*TER:	morning.
*HOL:	When my 
*TER:	We had games on Wednesday afternoon but we had, in the senior school 
*HOL:	When my
*TER:	we had school on Saturday morning as well as the rest of the week!
*HOL:	My erm   (.) my dad's mum, they used to go to school Monday, Tuesday   (.) Wednesday morning, have Wednesday afternoon off, all day Thursday, all day Friday and Saturday morning!But they would have Wednesday afternoon off.
*LUC:	Oh!
*TER:	Right.
*HOL:	 [laughing] For some reason  [] !
*TER:	Okay.So we've got a little time left.Erm   (.) let's   (.) have a look at your   (.) English   (.) these English progress papers.
*HOL:	Okay.
*TER:	Because, I want to do a little bit of that   (.) erm   (.) we are going 
*LUC:	Ah!
*TER:	what page are we on now? (        ) 
*HOL:	We started something last week. (        ) , I mean I've finished that.
*TER:	Yes, what paper was that?
*LUC:	The Locuses.
*HOL:	About the Locusts.
*TER:	What page was that?
*HOL:	I don't know.
*LUC:	I don't know.
*HOL:	 ((laugh)) 
*LUC:	Here it is!Here's the page.
*TER:	Page twenty eight.Page twenty eight.That's right.Now, how far did we get with that?
*LUC:	Erm, we finished the bit about the locusts.
*TER:	Right.So 
*HOL:	Ten to five.
*TER:	Okay.
*LUC:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Number eight   (.) we've got to do.I think.
*LUC:	Look, look!Look!
*TER:	Yes.Number eight.
*HOL:	I think you hold it right at the end.
*LUC:	Do you?
*HOL:	Do this don't you?
*LUC:	Oh you do don't you?
*TER:	Did we mark it?
*LUC:	No.
*HOL:	The 
*TER:	Did we not mark it?
*HOL:	They're all ma they're alright though.Cos we didn't   (        ) 
*TER:	Cos we but we didn't the last one?So right!Okay.So we'll go on to page   (.) that page twenty eight, number eight.If you'd like to do it now and then we'll mark it.
*LUC:	Number eight?
*TER:	Number eight.
*HOL:	Paper over 
*LUC:	Oh!
*HOL:	there.
*LUC:	Yes!
*HOL:	Underline the correct answer in the brackets.
*TER:	So write it down, don't underline it.Just write the, write the sentence down.
*HOL:	How do you write it though?
*TER:	You gotta choose the correct one.
*LUC:	Mm.
*TER:	This should be very apt from what you've just been doing.
*HOL:	Mm!
*LUC:	My, am I, am I an author now?
*TER:	I don't know.
*LUC:	Mm?
*TER:	That might well be mightn't it?
*LUC:	 (        ) 
*TER:	I know I'm, no I'm just coming to sort you out because   (.) as you say you did that with Mrs .So, you haven't done this yet?
*HOL:	I've done that   (.) Terry.
*TER:	Right.Wait for Lucy to do it   (.) and then we'll read it out.
*LUC:	Oh!Ooh ooh ooh!
*HOL:	Don't think, the spelling's wrong.
*LUC:	Yes I have!Cos I   (.) I'm usually a good speller!One of these.Over to dad and Becky.
*HOL:	Oh, she's terrible!
*LUC:	Mm.Doesn't know how to spell scene!
*TER:	Does she not?
*HOL:	No, she 
*LUC:	No.
*HOL:	i , when we have like, something like scene one she puts S double E N!
*LUC:	Mm.
*TER:	Oh!
*HOL:	She doesn't know how to spell having.She goes, she puts erm, A, hey, no H, H A V E I N G!She's useless at spelling!
*TER:	Right , so what have you got there?
*HOL:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Well now, it should a be a person who writes books is
*LUC:	An.
*TER:	An.
*LUC:	An!
*HOL:	Oh!
*TER:	An author.
*HOL:	Mm.
*TER:	An author.Why do you put an instead of a?
*HOL:	Because it's got a vowel!
*TER:	Because author 
*LUC:	A vowel.
*TER:	comme , starts with an A, right, a vowel.Right, number nine.So do number nine.
*HOL:	Mhm! (.) Oh!
*TER:	So what have you got?
*LUC:	It's a journalist.
*HOL:	Journalist.
*TER:	A person who writes articles for a newspaper is a journalist.
*LUC:	For a newspaper is a journalist .
*HOL:	Journalist!
*TER:	Good!Right!Number ten then.
*LUC:	When he breaks    (.)  [laughing] Oh sorry I didn't mean to  [] 
*TER:	It's when 
*HOL:	 (        ) 
*TER:	we break into a house to steal   (.) is called a
*LUC:	It's called   (.) it's called a prisoner!
*HOL:	 [laughing] Mm mm  [] . (.) Do you know the story   (.) o , first of all I was gonna write about fairground   (.) about a erm   (.) ghost 
*LUC:	Ghost 
*HOL:	train   (.) then I thought, no, I wouldn't write that.Then I was gonna write about   (.) a hotel   (.) you know, erm Heartbreak Hotel   (.) thought no, wouldn't write about that.Want something exciting, so I thought a murder  (        ) !
*LUC:	 ((laugh)) 
*TER:	Yes.So it's a burglar, right?B U R G L A R. 
*HOL:	A murder.
*TER:	E actually yours made me think of a story that I was told many years ago on a coach trip over Dartmoor
*HOL:	Mm.
*TER:	when a lady who lived on Dartmoor for many, many years   (.) erm   (.) was telling   (.) stories of things that had actually happened
*LUC:	True?
*TER:	to her.Well, for instance, that she lived in a in an old vicarage, cos her husband had been a   (.) a, no a tri , priest in the Church of England and er   (.) we her house was haunted   (.) and she was telling us stories and sh she quite often saw the ghost, she was never worried, she never   (.) cos it never frightened her it wasn't vicious or anything like that and she often saw it   (.) quite matter of fact .As a matter of fact, she often saw this ghost.But, she was telling the story of a man who was travelling over the moor   (.) and it was many years ago    (.)  (        ) on horseback   (.) and er he   (.) was completely lost and wan , it was getting dark and he wanted to   (.) stay somewhere for the night   (.) and he sort of travelled and couldn't see anywhere and eventually down a long drive he saw a house wi , blazing with lights   (.) so he went down this house   (.) and er, all the windows were alight, you know   (.) were lit up   (.) and he knocked at the door and knocked at the door, and knocked at the door and couldn't get any answer, no one ever came to the door   (.) so in desperation he thought well this is no good!So he went back up onto the main road and very little further on, in fact, he in fact found a village   (.) and spent the night at the hostelry   (.) and he said to the man in the hostelry   (.) you know,he that he'd been lost and that a   (.) a little bit back on the road he'd seen this big house all alight and he had erm, you know, gone in the drive and tried to get   (.) get a room there but   (.) couldn't make anybody hear   (.) and the erm   (.) the inn keeper said, no he said er   (.) you wouldn't make anyone hear there, he said and if you go back there tomorrow   (.) the house won't be there!And he went back   (.) and it wasn't! ((laugh)) 
*HOL:	Weird!
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*LUC:	Why not?
*TER:	It had gone!
*HOL:	What a ghost made it?
*TER:	Yeah. ((laugh)) 
*LUC:	I like, I love 
*TER:	Told a lot of ghost stories, yes!
*LUC:	I love listening 
*TER:	in my   (        ) 
*LUC:	to ghost stories in Dartmoor.
*HOL:	Oh I know this really   (        ) story!
*LUC:	Go on then.
*HOL:	Right, it's about this erm   (.) lady, I'll make it that she lived on Dartmoor with her erm grandson   (.) erm   (.) and her   (.) moth and he sa daughter and she is a gran , she was a grandlady   (.) a grandmother.
*LUC:	 [laughing] A grandlady  [] !
*HOL:	 ((laugh))  (.) And erm, they lived in this little cottage and erm   (.) every night erm   (.) the moth , she would always stay up really late and the mother and erm her son would go to bed   (.) and she would always go out of this erm   (.) go out of the house   (.) every night and she would go, cos she had these three fingers which were blades
*LUC:	Oh!
*HOL:	you know like Freddy Kruger   (.) three fingers that looked like blades   (.) and every night she would go to erm   (.) the fields   (.) and erm   (.) she would go into sheep fields and cow fields and she would kill three sheep and a cow every night   (.) except for a Sunday night!Every morning farmers would come and they would see this claw mark   (.) on the neck of these   (.) of their sheep and their cows and they were, they were quite worried cos all their sheep and cows were like dying every night!They were quite worried about it.And so they went to report to the, to the police   (.) but and th I mean they didn't believe them, they thought it was just like birds.And erm   (.) and   (.) she kept doing this for ages   (.) and erm   (.) she was, she was sta starting to get worried because people might believe, find out that it was her   (.) and so after she killed a cow, she took out all of i , all it's insides and hid in it and no one ever found her!
*TER:	Oh dear!Terrible!
*HOL:	And then, she 
*TER:	Ooh!
*LUC:	Ooh!
*HOL:	she was
*LUC:	It's horrible isn't it?
*HOL:	And then she hid inside this cow!
*TER:	Mm!
*HOL:	And she killed it! (        ) 
*LUC:	 (        ) ?
*TER:	Right!I think   (.) we'd 
*LUC:	Ha.
*TER:	better leave it at that hadn't we?Will you   (.) before you come to me next time
*HOL:	Mhm.
*TER:	finish down to   (.) number twenty eight? (.) And learn those spellings?Right?So that's going to be page twenty eight and twenty nine. (.) Okay, learn your spellings!Now, I'll have to talk to your mums but it may well be   (.) that   (.) I shan't be here in a fortnight's time so we may 
*HOL:	Oh!
*TER:	have to put things back a week.
*HOL:	Okay.
*TER:	But we'll   (.) we'll think about that   (.) nearer the time.Alright?
*LUC:	Okay.
*TER:	Okey-doke And you'll leave your compositions with me and I will look up, and if I can get the marks before then as I probably will   (.) I'll let you have them back.Okay?
*LUC:	Okay.
*TER:	Right! (.) So, one more week to go and then you've got a holiday.
*LUC:	 [sighing] Yes  [] !
*TER:	Ha hum!
*HOL:	At last!
*TER:	Yeah, that's right.Right?Bye bye girls!
*LUC:	Bye bye!Ballet now.
*TER:	Cor you got ballet now have you?
*HOL:	Yes we
*TER:	Hello Adrian!Alright?
*ADR:	Yes thanks.
*TER:	So   (.) all set for a break tomorrow?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Thank you.Have I got to give your mummy change this time?
*ADR:	Er   (.) yeah.
*TER:	It looks like it 
*ADR:	Oh yeah.
*TER:	doesn't it?
*ADR:	I'll go and get some.
*TER:	I know, right.That's alright. (.) That's fine. (.) Erm   (.) right!What book are we on?Four A.
*ADR:	It's alright, this is erm, yours.
*TER:	Yeah, I know I was looking for the erm   (.) oops!Now   (.) right!So how have we got on with that?
*ADR:	Er ah, I did some at home but we haven't done any booklet work this week.
*TER:	You haven't done any booklet work?Okay.
*ADR:	Because we've been doing Pythagoras theorem.
*TER:	Oh have you?
*ADR:	Yeah.I'll just show you what we've been doing.
*TER:	Yeah.Show us what you've been doing.You understand it?
*ADR:	Yeah   (.) well sort of! ((laugh))  (.) We're erm   (.) that's the booklet I'm on at the moment.
*TER:	What's this one? (.) I haven't seen this one.Oh!
*ADR:	It's   (.) it's er   (        ) 
*TER:	 (        ) ?
*ADR:	Yeah.Did that yu , yesterday.Not all that.
*TER:	Is that from here?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Yeah.
*ADR:	Work from that.And an an the the sheets.And now   (.) I've just started   (.) this.I'm gonna finish the end of C six for homework, and I'm on C six A.And that's what we've been doing, all about it.
*TER:	Right.
*ADR:	Okay?
*TER:	Yeah.So do you wanna finish that now?
*ADR:	Yeah please.
*TER:	Right, okay.
*ADR:	I I knew that erm   (.) I uns , I sa understand some of it but some of it I find a bit hard to understand   (.) like   (.) this bit, it says   (.) be careful, sometimes the unknown side is   (.) is the longest side and sometimes it is not.But I thi , I I can't, I know that you have to take it away.
*TER:	Yes but   (.) the thing is this   (.) in a right angle triangle
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	the longest side is called what?Cos it 
*ADR:	The hypotenuse.
*TER:	The hypotenuse, right!So the longer side is always the hypotenuse.
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Right?Now, what is the formula   (.) for your Pythagoras theorem?
*ADR:	The sum of the erm I do I don't, I know, my dad's taught me a different one to Miss , she   (.) she taught me that erm   (.) i the, oh hang on!It's back here. (        ) I got a new book today so   (.) but   (.) she taught that is was   (.) ha!Erm, if I can find it! (.) The right angle triangle.The areas and squares on the   (.) two short sides   (.) add together to equal the area on the square of the hypotenuse.
*TER:	Right!The square on the hypotenuse
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	The square on the hypotenuse   (.) equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
*ADR:	Okay.
*TER:	Alright?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	And the squ hypotenuse is always the longest side.It's the side opposite the right angle.
*ADR:	Mhm.
*TER:	So   (.) there's your right angle   (.) that is the hypotenuse and the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares, that's the su , the area of that square and the area of that square add together the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
*ADR:	Okay.
*TER:	Alright?The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.So   (.) what they're saying is this   (.) that   (.) the square on that side
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	is thirty six, so what's the length of that side?
*ADR:	Erm   (.) that must be   (.) nine.
*TER:	No!
*ADR:	Sorry!Aha.What then?
*TER:	The square root of thirty six.What two numbers amount to   (        ) 
*ADR:	Six.
*TER:	That's right.So the   (.) that side must be six centimetres
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	The square is six times six which is thirty six.That is four square centimetres.
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	It's four centimetres and the square is sixteen   (.) so, what must be the area of that square?
*ADR:	Twenty.
*TER:	Twenty.Right!So you've got to find what number multiplied together makes twenty.
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	So it's going to, the length of that side is going to be the 
*ADR:	So you square the root of twenty.Find the square root of twenty   (.) don't you?
*TER:	You find the square root of twenty.That's right.And how do you find the square root of twenty?
*ADR:	Just   (.) use that.
*TER:	 ((laugh))  (.) You'll use that yes!
*ADR:	Mm mm.
*TER:	Aren't you lucky?
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	Because I   (.) we never had sa we never had erm   (.) calculators.
*ADR:	Wha what did you have to do then?
*TER:	So you had to find the square root of by   (.) ar  (.) either   (.) arithmetic   (.) by 
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	doing in an arithmetic way or you had to use a sca , a log table.You had to use log tables.You had to use this sort of thing   (.) like find it    (.)  (        ) up in a mess hasn't it?Erm   (.) I had to go to a table like that   (.) which said square roots   (.) and I had to look up   (.) twenty
*ADR:	It's got on the back actually.Back of this book.
*TER:	Square roots   (.) twe 
*ADR:	Oh yeah.
*TER:	square root is twenty   (.) and it's four point four seven two one.
*ADR:	Yeah, square root.
*TER:	That's right.But, as you say you can use this
*ADR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TER:	Which one do you push now?
*ADR:	That one.
*TER:	That's right.Four point four seven two.
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	So, you know, that's   (.) well the way you do it.So th that's how you find that.So now when you got these   (.) three here
*ADR:	I've done these.
*TER:	You've done those have you?
*ADR:	Yeah, look.Here are.
*TER:	Well let's see that you got them right shall we?
*ADR:	Six five A.
*TER:	So, this one   (.) you've got twenty five   (.) equals   (.) nine   (.) plus some number.Right?
*ADR:	Mhm.
*TER:	So, that is going to be   (.) sixteen isn't it?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	No it isn't.
*ADR:	Yes it is!
*TER:	Yes it is, sixteen.So, what's that gonna be?
*ADR:	Sixteen to erm, square root of sixteen 
*TER:	Sixteen 
*ADR:	is four.
*TER:	Four.So that's 
*ADR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	gonna be four.So, C five A, have you got four?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Yes you have.Right.Now, B   (.) again, that   (.) the square root of that   (.) is going to equal the square root of that   (.) plus the square root of that.So you've got sixteen
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	Or rather, sixty four   (.) e  (.) eighty one   (.) equals   (.) sixty four   (.) plus some number.So, sixty four from eighty one
*ADR:	Gives you   (.) six which is erm, seventeen so it's 
*TER:	Gives you 
*ADR:	er seventeen.
*TER:	Gives you seventeen.So now, for the answer to that one 
*ADR:	The square root of seventeen.
*TER:	you want the square root of seventeen   (.) which is four point one two.Right!
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	So C   (.) again, you've got eleven elevens, what are eleven elevens?
*ADR:	Er   (.) a hundred and twenty one.
*TER:	A hundred and twenty one   (.) equals thirty six, plus some number.
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	So what is a hundred and twenty one less thirty six?
*ADR:	Erm   (.) er   (.) is it   (.) six erm   (.) erm si 
*TER:	Eighty five.
*ADR:	eighty five, sorry.
*TER:	Have you got eighty five?The square root of eighty five?Yes, you have!Er, the square root of eighty five, that sounds reasonable so I would assume that's right.D   (.) you've got sixty four   (.) equals 
*ADR:	Mhm.
*TER:	twenty five plus some number, so what's that?Thirty nine?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	The square root of thirty nine which is   (.) obviously reasonable so that's alright.Right!So how's 
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	C six?And you can't do C six?
*ADR:	So that, those are alright?

*ADR:	Okay.
*TER:	Cos I
*ADR:	Is that the hypotenuse? (.) Yes?
*TER:	Which is the hypotenuse?
*ADR:	That one?
*TER:	Which one?
*ADR:	The opposite one to the right angle.
*TER:	Right.
*ADR:	So it's that one.
*TER:	Right!
*ADR:	So, so it must be   (.) it is   (.) erm can I write it down on here?
*TER:	I'll tell you what   (.) write it down on paper and then you can copy it into your book when you know you've got it right.How about that?
*ADR:	Hang on a sec ! (.) Five point three nine.
*TER:	Right!I'll settle for that.
*ADR:	Is that right, the way I've done it?By the way, I I did that so I did   (.) area of square along the side.
*TER:	Well I mean you've got the right answer so erm
*ADR:	Shall I just write   (.) shall I copy it in?
*TER:	Yes, what have you done?
*ADR:	Erm   (.) five   (.) equals twenty five   (.) mm?
*TER:	Five doesn't equal twenty five.
*ADR:	Five fives are twenty five!

*TER:	Be very precise.But you shouldn't ever write five equals twenty five cos it doesn't!
*ADR:	Okay then.
*TER:	You mean five squared, you mean five times five equals twenty five   (.) you're looking for five squared, so that's the right thing to write!Alright?
*ADR:	Okay. (.) That is the hypotenuse isn't it?That there?
*TER:	Yes.Mhm.
*ADR:	C   (.) Do you do ninety nine take twenty five?
*TER:	Which one are we doing?
*ADR:	B.Erm   (.) I'm gonna do
