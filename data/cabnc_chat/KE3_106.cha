*JAC:	I must admit I like to see that, because  so many people, if a dog had to lose a leg they'd say put it to sleep, put it to sleep. •_•
*TON:	Mm. •_•
        Yeah  •_•
*JAC:	And  why? •_•
        If you lost a leg they'd stick a false one on you or give you a set of wheels. •_•
*TON:	Mm. •_•
        Right. •_•
*JAC:	So why kill it why kill a dog because it's gonna lose a leg. •_•
*TON:	Mm. •_•
*JAC:	It's got  well you've only got two. •_•
        You lose yours, one of yours and it's a disaster. •_•
*TON:	Mm. •_•
*JAC:	If a dog loses one, well it's still got three to get on with, you know? •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAC:	It's hardly a handicap at all to a dog. •_•
*CHR:	It's happened to one dog and he learned to walk like a human   •_•
*JAC:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	He walked like a human. •_•
        . And he spun right round and he  like that. •_•
        And they said get up. •_•
        And he rolls over and then he sort of put his legs up. •_•
        I can't remember  no he sort of I can't do it. •_•
*JAC:	But to lose a leg for a dog is hardly a handicap at all. •_•
*TON:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	Cos they've got three others. •_•
        They just lose their balance occasionally. •_•
*JAC:	Well that's why a dog that limps slightly  very often there's practically nothing wrong with it. •_•
*TON:	Yeah. •_•
*JAC:	If it thinks it's gonna hurt it will limp. •_•
*TON:	Yeah  •_•
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*JAC:	Whereas people, if you've got a painful leg you've got to walk on it. •_•
        Whereas a dog might have a slightly painful leg and it will limp like hell. •_•
*TON:	Mm. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*JAC:	Cos it doesn't have to use it. •_•
*CHR:	Oh no we've got some really hard numbers    french if I had a dictionary I could look it up but I haven't. •_•
