*BRE:	Tesco's as you see it's got the er er   (.) the go ahead to er   (.) open Sunday's hasn't it?
*JEA:	Yes   (.) yes 
*BRE:	Now , is a big thing.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	We co we were horrified with erm   (.) we got thing through the door like erm   (.) this one was like a survey thing   (.) saying they wanted to, you know   (.) er   (        ) the cricket   (.) amongst others   (.) they wanna put a Tesco's superstore there.
*JEA:	Oh no!
*BRE:	And anyway it's in the paper   (.) in the paper this week   (.) and they've been saying that er   (.) the outrage   (        ) the residents!
*JEA:	Yeah   (.) yeah.
*BRE:	I mean, like Dave said, I mean, alright we could perhaps do with a superstore, but not the   (        )  (        ) .
*JEA:	Not there   (.) no, no   (.) no.
*BRE:	I mean that's a bit daft really!
*JEA:	You know who it is that wants to make money on that? (.) That's that dreadful man,! (.) Councillor    (.) he's had his greedy little eyes on that area for years.
*BRE:	Has he?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Yes because I know, do you remember we were gonna buy a house down there
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	but then when we went into it they said   (.) erm   (.) obviously look at the development plans and it would go ahead   (.) eventually for something there, they didn't state what.
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	I mean it might be   (.) whatever year
*JEA:	Well I went to a   (.) a big meeting round about nineteen eighty five
*BRE:	Yeah I remember you said 
*JEA:	and they he wanted   (.) to   (.) where Marge  lived   (.) remember The Grove 
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	They wanted to
*BRE:	That whole bit?
*JEA:	raise that and have that developed as a road, the other one, would   (.) be closed
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	and developed    (.) would be   (.) destroyed   (.) and another,an an another big road put in it's place and   (.) he they they were after Horsell Moor   (.) which is where they're going to put the Tesco's.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	That area's called Horsell Moor
*BRE:	I don't think they made it 
*JEA:	I bet 
*BRE:	though, do you?
*JEA:	Well I hope not!
*BRE:	We do need one.
*JEA:	Yes, we do we do need another store in Woking of that kind.
*BRE:	But they're are not 
*JEA:	Not there!
*BRE:	how long has Anthony  been there, twenty 
*JEA:	Ah 
*BRE:	thirty years?
*JEA:	Thirty years, easily, I mean it wa , it was already established when we arrived in nineteen fifty nine.
*BRE:	But Dave said Tesco's can't do, what they did they did it at Weybridge, they said let us buy your sight   (.) you say where you wanna sight and then they and we will build what you 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	want on that sight 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	for you.
*JEA:	Mm, mm   (.) yes.
*BRE:	But as John still got a lot of work on, and Mary Ann?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	Is it getting  (        ) ?
*JEA:	No, but Mary Ann's a 
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	public servant and they're   (.) pretty well prot protected   (.) erm John's firm is simply doing extremely well in spite of the recession.
*BRE:	Yes right.
*JEA:	I mean they're very pleased with him because he's the front man   (.) having appeared on the Anneka Rice thing and being kissed by Anneka Rice in the full view of millions   [laughing] I mean John can do no wrong   [] by r by Johnathan    (.) I doubt it.
*BRE:	Did he manage to see get it did he video it?
*JEA:	Yes Mary Ann's done it.
*BRE:	Oh Mary Ann did it, he'll be able to see it.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	What did he think of Anneka Rice?
*JEA:	Oh   (.) you know   (.) she is what she is what she'll be.
*BRE:	Is that's right.
*JEA:	Vital, lively, attractive.
*BRE:	Yes.
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	Did you see you with that gas that advert she did with that   (.) poor woman!
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	Yes.
*JEA:	I don't blame the woman for doing as much as possible on television   (.) with in those advertisements because I think that woman   (.) have got only a short   (.) life in those ads because she'd get bored with them  (        ) .
*BRE:	Wonder why  (        ) ?
*JEA:	Well she she's   (.) she gets up and does things doesn't she.
*BRE:	Yeah that's what I mean, they say ooh can't stand this woman sh  (.) but I mean, I don't know why.
*JEA:	Jealousy I think.
*BRE:	Probably.
*JEA:	Hell of a lot of 
*BRE:	I mean 
*JEA:	jealousy.
*BRE:	she's got a lot of get and go   (        ) 
*JEA:	That she has   (.) she has.
*BRE:	 (        )  (.) this is taping now   (.) so what was erm   (.) Libertys did they have it? (.) Re remind me tomorrow   (.) I must take those   (.) twenty   (        ) vouchers
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	to erm   (.) Debs
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and Jenny was saying she went to   (.) Debenhams yesterday they had a twelve day spectacular at eight thirty to eight thirty at night     (.)  (        )  (.) there was   (        ) clothes they were half price   (.) plus you got a third of ten per cent off.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	But I think a all the sales will be off before Christmas.
*JEA:	I   (.) I looked at the fabrics in the Libertys
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	and   (.) if I can't get want I want at the Famlingham Textile Centre which is   (.) excellent   (.) when I next need fabrics I shall come up, I will come up to London and I'll go to Libertys, but I will have measured first of all to within an inch as to what I want because
*BRE:	It is expensive.
*JEA:	Well some of the stuff is eighteen pounds a meter   (.) but if you think of the cost of a   (.) a well fitting jacket for somebody like myself, it's astronomical!
*BRE:	You know what you should have done while you was up there this time   (.) you should have took asked for some samples.
*JEA:	Yes, my dear, I I did not feel well enough just 
*BRE:	No do you think that they will?
*JEA:	I didn't even think about, yes they will, they'll give you a little cutting, I suppose.
*BRE:	Yeah, but not only that, I mean, they will now   (.) all these shops are doing like a mail order
*JEA:	That's interesting.
*BRE:	and they would actually send   (.) and I know why because erm   (.) John Lewis in London   (.) erm   (.) Jackie wanted some fabric   (.) and she'd seen it up there and Harrods   (.) and erm   (.) she found out she didn't have her card with her, just her Barclaycard   (.) said would you post this we wou  (.) we'll have to charge you, like, two pound 
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	fifty packaging, but that's fine she said 
*JEA:	Well yes it's very good.
*BRE:	well I couldn't get up there because she know   (        ) 
*JEA:	Quite.
*BRE:	park
*JEA:	Quite.
*BRE:	and   (.) she wanted sort of so many meters of each 
*JEA:	Mm   (.) yeah 
*BRE:	and the the they sent it to her.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	And I suppose you could treat 
*JEA:	Worth going.
*BRE:	people this year, if they'd done all their Christmas shopping mail order.
*JEA:	Oh yes   (.) yes.
*BRE:	Rather than, sort of go round themselves   (.) I reckon we'll take that with us.
*JEA:	Good idea!
*BRE:	Might want them for a cup of tea  (        ) .
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	I think we should have got away with a small Coke, shouldn't we?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	That's nice of them.
*JEA:	It's so big!
*BRE:	We've been   (.) thrilled with this work experience   (.) cos was Dave originally   (.) had these five days off   (        ) taping   (.) and he said no, he said, you know you're so tired, have a little rest   (.) we'll go up I'll go up on the train   (.) only to get to the Selhurst Park he's got four or five train journeys   (        ) 
*JEA:	Yeah   (.) mm
*BRE:	and he has to get, like   (.) Woking to Surbiton   (.) Surbiton to Clapham Junction
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	Clapham Junction to S S erm   (.) Thornton Heath   (.) and he has Thornton Heath to Selhurst Park.
*JEA:	Mm   (.) yes.
*BRE:	So it's five trips
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	there's no easier 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	way
*JEA:	No   (.) no 
*BRE:	round it   (.) and like Dave said   (.) it would've cost him, sort of, seven or eight pound a day in petrol
*JEA:	Mm   (.) quite 
*BRE:	and he managed to get a ticket for a week  (        ) 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	for fifteen 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	pounds.
*JEA:	Yes, yes quite
*BRE:	You know it 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	but erm I bought   (        ) 
*JEA:	 ((cough)) 
*BRE:	sort of, quarter past seven he's had to leave in the morning   (.) to get there   (.) and then not getting home to, sort of , seven o'clock   (.) Dave picks up from the station   (.) and I think 
*JEA:	Part of life.
*BRE:	and I, sort of, said to him it's he's enjoyed it, he hasn't, sort of , moaned.
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	He he just moans about the fact of making tea!
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	That just made us laugh because 
*JEA:	Mm   (.) quite
*BRE:	I said to Dave, they've got no idea the youngsters, have they? (.) They don't
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	no idea what so ever   (.) because erm   (.) he starts on this   (        ) on Monday.
*JEA:	Oh God!
*BRE:	He's got three er   (.) he's got the  (        ) , two languages   (.) the three sciences, biology, chemistry an  (.) erm   (.) what's the other one? (.) Science.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	there and   (.) the maths  (        ) .
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	So   (.) but I think with this   (.) I mean this homework, that's the only thing I don't believe in because   (.) they've gotta revise it   (.) which is brilliant, I mean, (        ) at the moment   (.) but they also give them three hours homework a night!
*JEA:	They're not thinking what they're doing, are they, they're 
*BRE:	No I can't talk 
*JEA:	overloading 
*BRE:	I mean Jim was saying that Winston   (.) has given them two weeks off so 
*JEA:	Yes   (.) yes.
*BRE:	alright I don't   (.) two weeks is too long I think 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	because obviously like   (.) Kim very soon after revising she's going out.
*JEA:	Yes, yes.
*BRE:	Erm   (.) but, I mean, you know, I think they need to s they should say, no homework   (.) for this week, because they've already 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	got a lot
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	just go through   (.) revision
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	you know, two weeks before 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	or something, no time 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	off school,
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	but total revision   (.) an I mean, the other night he sat in, he came home at four o'clock   (.) and he was up till nine thirty   (.) just doing homework.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	He's hardly got time to revise much cos he's so tired!
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And erm   (.) he he said it's stupid, he said they were given all this and it's the homework   (.) it's nothing to do   (.) with the revision you've got to do in his the exams!
*JEA:	Yeah, ha   (.) ha ha.
*BRE:	You know, it's sort of, totally different.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Are we fit or?
*JEA:	Just about.
*BRE:	Do you want or would like 
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	another cigarette?
*JEA:	You have another cigarette   (.) yeah.
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEA:	I'm shattered!
*BRE:	You'll be alright, when you get 
*JEA:	I'll be fine once   (.) once I've had another   (.) five minutes.
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	Ooh!
*BRE:	Well you'll sleep well now   (        ) always do.
*JEA:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] .
*BRE:	Did you still put stilton cheese in that roll or   (.) did you want that?
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	Oh! (.) Is that   (        ) it all or   (.) or did you try it?
*JEA:	I Haven't needed try, Brenda, I can't I mean at one time I'd have devoured that.
*BRE:	Yeah and me look how much I've eaten.
*JEA:	No, no I can't I just can't eat   (.) so I'm not forcing myself to eat, what I'm trying to do is only to eat the right things   (.) and I must start vitamin supplements   (.) I think I've got the age when I probably   (.) need that, I mean, this cold   (.) is a warning to me that my immune system is not as strong as it ought to be, I shouldn't have had another cold   (.) so soon after getting rid of one!
*BRE:	Crikey, cos the last time you were down you had that stinker didn't you?
*JEA:	Yes yes   (.) and this one isn't as bad, but   (.) I shouldn't be having this one at all!
*BRE:	At all, no   (.) you need either a multi-vitamin or vitamin c.
*JEA:	Probably a bit of both.
*BRE:	Do you not take any   (.) any at all?
*JEA:	No, no I don't   (.) the time has come I think! (.) Ah but tell me   (.) what happened about your   (.) fracas with Peter?
*BRE:	Oh yeah, well I won't tape.
