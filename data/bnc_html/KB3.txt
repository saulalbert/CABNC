                                     [264] ... Sunday night []
Bob (PS149)                          [265] Come on, Grant.
Grant (PS148)                        [266] [reading] It was Sunday night and
                                     Scott was watching Space Man on
                                     television.
                                     [267] Scott had watched him get into the
                                     rocket many times and he dreamed about
                                     going with Space Man.
                                     [268] It would be fun if I could get into
                                     the, that rocket too, thought Scott.
                                     [269] It would be fun to go far out into
                                     space.
                                     [270] That was the one thing
Alison (PS147)                       [271] Full stop.
Grant (PS148)                        [272] Scott thought about.
                                     [273] He was fast asleep before Space Man
                                     had finished his trip.
                                     [274] Scott began to dream.
Alison (PS147)                       [275] Good.
Grant (PS148)                        [276] The time had come for Space Man
                                     Scott to go to the moon!
                                     [277] He would be the first boy to land on
                                     the moon.
                                     [278] Scott walked outside and looked up
                                     at the rocket.
                                     [279] The rocket was as tall as seven
                                     houses.
                                     [280] It was as tall as seven houses.
                                     [281] This rocket was, this ... Scott said
                                     that that would take him to the moon.
                                     [282] Scott climbed inside the rocket.
                                     [283] The men were getting ready for blast
                                     off.
                                     [284] [shouting] Ten, nine, eight, seven,
                                     six, five, four, three, two, one!
                                     [285] Blast off [] !
                                     [286] Space Man Scott be began ... has
Bob (PS149)                          [287] His.
Grant (PS148)                        [288] his trip to the moon.
                                     [289] On and on into space went Scott
                                     Seven.
                                     [290] Then a part of the rocket fell away.
                                     [291] When Scott looked out, he could see
                                     the stars and many flashing lights.
                                     [292] Part of the time Scott talked on the
                                     rocket's radio.
                                     [293] Part of the time he just looked out
                                     into space.
                                     [294] The rocket came to a stop at Space
                                     Station.
                                     [295] Some works at the station
Bob (PS149)                          [296] Some workers.
Grant (PS148)                        [297] some workers at the station took
                                     Scott inside.
Alison (PS147)                       [298] New line.
Grant (PS148)                        [299] They asked him
Alison (PS147)                       [...]
Grant (PS148)                        [300] they asked him to remember all the
                                     things he could about the trip from earth.
                                     [301] Then the men talked about other
                                     rocket
Bob (PS149)                          [302] About the other.
Grant (PS148)                        [303] about the other rocket would take
                                     him
Bob (PS149)                          [304] That would take him.
Grant (PS148)                        [305] on to the moon.
                                     [306] They helped Scott get ready.
                                     [307] In the morning, Scott, three other
                                     men got into the moon rocket.
                                     [308] Again he were ready to go.
                                     [309] [shouting] Ten, nine, eight, seven,
                                     six, five, four, three, two, one!
                                     [310] Blast off [] !
                                     [311] Away went the rocket with Scott and
                                     his friends inside.
                                     [312] Away it went on its long trip to the
                                     moon.
                                     [313] As last
Bob (PS149)                          [314] At.
Grant (PS148)                        [315] it, at last they landed on the moon.
                                     [316] Scott and the men got out and looked
                                     around.
                                     [317] What a strange place it was.
                                     [318] Look here, look here Scott, said one
                                     men
Bob (PS149)                          [319] Man.
Grant (PS148)                        [320] one ma one, said one man.
                                     [321] Do you see that big brown thing that
                                     looks a boat?
                                     [322] You live on that boat.
                                     [323] That's the earth.
                                     [324] That's what your home looks like
                                     from up here on the moon.
                                     [325] How strange it was fro for Scott to
                                     see.
                                     [326] That ...
Bob (PS149)                          [327] His.
Grant (PS148)                        [328] his home was a round planet far out
                                     in space.
                                     [329] One man had a shovel.
                                     [330] He wanted to take some things from
                                     the moon back to earth with him.
                                     [331] The other men looked around and
                                     talked on the radio.

                                     [340] ... The dream was over and so was
                                     Scott's trip to the moon.
                                     [341] Well, said his mother, what are you
                                     doing down there on the floor?
                                     [342] Scott laughed I just fell off the
                                     moon.

                                     started her off.
                                     [358] [...] I mean I was appalled because
                                     she kept making such a lot of mistakes.
Bob (PS149)                          [359] You haven't looked for it?
Alison (PS147)                       [360] I was mortified [laughing] mortified

                                     mummy could hardly stop laughing because
                                     you could go through [...] and she's older
                                     than you, but Aileen thinks you're
                                     wonderful.
                                     [362] I think you can read beautifully.
                                     [363] You've done really so well.

Bob (PS149)                          [466] [...] because the day, the week

Alison (PS147)                       [467] But they will leave on the
                                     fourteenth?
Bob (PS149)                          [468] Yeah the week after that week I
                                     shouldn't have a day off
Alison (PS147)                       [469] Mm mm

                                     [471] So it suits me to work all next week
                                     and take that day off on the Friday.
Alison (PS147)                       [472] Mm mm
Bob (PS149)                          [473] Okay, I will

                                     we've got left.
                                     [524] So it's two, three and four
                                     Dinosaurs in Space
Bob (PS149)                          [525] There's no more?
                                     [526] Just those, there's four in the
                                     series?
Alison (PS147)                       [527] Seems to be four.
Bob (PS149)                          [528] Does it tell you anywhere?
Alison (PS147)                       [529] No, I thought it might've said at

Alison (PS147)                       [531] It was Littlewoods actually.
Bob (PS149)                          [532] Littlewoods.
Alison (PS147)                       [533] Life after the Dinosaurs and the End
                                     of the Dinosaurs.
                                     [534] I think [...] Littlewoods.
Bob (PS149)                          [535] I'll have to try and get number one
                                     as well.
Alison (PS147)                       [536] And I went out to Frasers.

Bob (PS149)                          [540] He's going to be an expert on
                                     dinosaurs.
Alison (PS147)                       [541] Oh I think so.
                                     [542] I think so and his dinosaur models

Bob (PS149)                          [546] I always knew them as dinosaurs but

Alison (PS147)                       [559] Oh no, sorry that's my fault!
                                     [560] The tyrannosaurus has got teeny
                                     weeny front legs and big back legs.
                                     [561] Sorry.
                                     [562] The stegosaurus is the one
Bob (PS149)                          [563] That
Alison (PS147)                       [564] that's got the big

                                     [567] It's little and dumpy.

                                     [571] I think that's like the model one
                                     you bought in Edinburgh.
Bob (PS149)                          [572] This is that?

Alison (PS147)                       [816] when Sheila was here last week and
                                     Linda, and Linda's little boy Christopher
                                     and he's only about a month younger than
                                     Annabel and erm she feels the bits would
                                     be too tiny for him.
                                     [817] He would eat them.
                                     [818] Cos one day we found him and he was
                                     choking to death practically and erm er
                                     Tam, Linda's husband turned him upside
                                     down and smacked his back, he'd eaten a
                                     one pound coin.
Bob (PS149)                          [819] Blimey!
Alison (PS147)                       [820] Now he could've choked and died!
Bob (PS149)                          [821] Hey, you're damaging that, Annabel.
Alison (PS147)                       [822] So ... the last time, remember
Bob (PS149)                          [823] Don't do that to it!
Alison (PS147)                       [824] remember the last time Linda was
                                     here she came on her own and her father
Bob (PS149)                          [825] Okay, okay
Alison (PS147)                       [826] dropped her and then her husband
                                     picked her up and the Reverend
Bob (PS149)                          [cough]
Alison (PS147)                       [827] the Reverend Peter came that day?
Bob (PS149)                          [828] Yeah
Alison (PS147)                       [829] And erm well he came to the door and
                                     Linda and the little, the little boy
                                     Christopher they were upstairs.
                                     [830] But previous to that Linda had said
                                     that she was terrified ... to get Lego for
                                     the little boy.
                                     [831] She was terrified when him and
                                     Annabel was playing it.
                                     [832] I said she's okay and she can handle
                                     it beautifully, and she's never eaten any
                                     little parts yet and some of the arms,
                                     Bobby, are tiny!
                                     [833] So she thought, well she saw Annabel
                                     handle it so beautifully she thought she
                                     might get some for Christopher for his
                                     Christmas.
                                     [834] But obviously she hasn't got them
                                     because erm she would have said when she
                                     was here last week.
                                     [835] She [...] last week.
                                     [836] But [...]

Bob (PS149)                          [839] It's good for them.

Alison (PS147)                       [843] I think they were about twelve
                                     pounds just for a, just some little things
                                     that you can use just like a little
                                     seaside pail but the totem pails, totem
                                     poles, it was totem pails
Bob (PS149)                          [844] Your turn to phone them up? [cough]
Alison (PS147)                       [845] Erm it's my turn actually erm
Bob (PS149)                          [846] So you'd do it at the weekend?
Alison (PS147)                       [847] That was last week, no I phoned her
                                     on Sunday.
Annabel (PS14A)                      [848] Mamma!

Bob (PS149)                          [850] You phoned Mamma?
Alison (PS147)                       [851] I did phone through the week
                                     because, yes it was somebody [...]
Bob (PS149)                          [852] [...] to phone you.
Alison (PS147)                       [853] because she wanted to watch that
                                     programme
Annabel (PS14A)                      [854] Mummy!
Alison (PS147)                       [855] and she insisted it was on at

                                     [858] Erm the one of David Jason's [...]
Bob (PS149)                          [859] Sorry I'm still not clear.

                                     turn to
Alison (PS147)                       [861] It'll be her turn to phone, I think
                                     she'll phone me next weekend, this coming
                                     weekend.
                                     [862] So I'll get Oliver booked in at
                                     kennels ... and erm
Bob (PS149)                          [863] Oh blast!
                                     [864] I'd forgot all that.
Alison (PS147)                       [865] he's beautifully groomed erm Sheila
                                     thought he was lovely last week.
                                     [866] I think it's the first time she'd
                                     actually seen Oliver look clean.
                                     [867] But, but I think, Bobby, he's got a
                                     severe chill.
Bob (PS149)                          [868] Is Sheila [...] this weekend?
Alison (PS147)                       [869] [...] winter time, did you [...]
Bob (PS149)                          [...]
Alison (PS147)                       [870] You could've taken Oliver
Bob (PS149)                          [871] taken Oliver and left him there.
Alison (PS147)                       [872] Are you off next week?
                                     [873] Are you off next week?
Bob (PS149)                          [874] I'm gonna take him up, yeah.
                                     [875] ... Oh, I suppose there's er
Alison (PS147)                       [876] Did you want to or
Bob (PS149)                          [877] I was thinking I haven't seen my dad
                                     since what, Christmas?
Alison (PS147)                       [878] Christmas time.
Bob (PS149)                          [879] And it's not gonna be before April.
                                     [...]
Alison (PS147)                       [880] It is Iris's turn to call us.
Bob (PS149)                          [881] Mm
Alison (PS147)                       [882] It's Iris's turn to call us really
                                     but, but I, I did think about Iris earlier
                                     and [...] I should really phone just to
                                     see how your dad is, Bobby because it's
                                     really up to her just to see about the
                                     weekend and much times that I've phoned
                                     the hospital recently.
Bob (PS149)                          [883] Yeah.
Alison (PS147)                       [884] Erm I'm just wondering if he ever
                                     gets the messages ... to say I've phoned.
                                     [885] They're always so busy.
Bob (PS149)                          [886] Well, I don't know, maybe
Alison (PS147)                       [887] But they are busy.
Bob (PS149)                          [888] I don't know!
Alison (PS147)                       [889] You must miss him terribly, Bobby?
                                     [890] But I think he's quite settled in
                                     hospital.
                                     [891] I think he's quite settled and
Bob (PS149)                          [892] Oop!
                                     [893] Pardon me, excuse me.
Alison (PS147)                       [894] quite happy I think.
Annabel (PS14A)                      [895] Pardon!
Bob (PS149)                          [896] Pardon!
Alison (PS147)                       [897] Although it is a worry, Bobby.
                                     [898] Erm but dad visits him quite a lot.
                                     [899] Well [...] ... the ladies who wait
                                     ... [...] ... ladies
Bob (PS149)                          [900] [...] oh no, I can't go the next

Alison (PS147)                       [901] Why?
Bob (PS149)                          [902] Because I'll still be covering for
                                     John
Alison (PS147)                       [903] Oh

                                     about
Alison (PS147)                       [905] Yes?
Bob (PS149)                          [906] it is the Royal Garden Party.
Alison (PS147)                       [907] Is it?
Bob (PS149)                          [908] Yeah.
Alison (PS147)                       [909] Yes.
Bob (PS149)                          [910] I thought it was something to do
                                     with something else but, you know a bit of
                                     a
Alison (PS147)                       [911] I thought it might've been to a
                                     Royal Garden Party
Bob (PS149)                          [912] I don't think
Alison (PS147)                       [913] cos that's [...]
Bob (PS149)                          [914] Yes, May I've got to do, it's May's
                                     stuff.
                                     [915] [cough] ... So, just have to wait
                                     and see whether ... we get an invitation
                                     or not.
Alison (PS147)                       [916] Oh, that'll be nice.
Bob (PS149)                          [917] Don't know when I'll find out.
Alison (PS147)                       [918] I've really enjoyed this.
Bob (PS149)                          [919] I didn't realize it was that.
Alison (PS147)                       [920] I told him it must've been about the
                                     Royal Garden Party.
Bob (PS149)                          [921] So that'll be alright.
Alison (PS147)                       [922] It's probably [...]
Bob (PS149)                          [...]
Alison (PS147)                       [923] [...] Queen [...] I think it's got a

Bob (PS149)                          [924] I'm not sure he'll be there but
Alison (PS147)                       [925] Mm?
Bob (PS149)                          [926] I'm not sure whether [...]
Alison (PS147)                       [927] Oh I should imagine
Bob (PS149)                          [928] suppose it will.
Alison (PS147)                       [929] it will be.
Bob (PS149)                          [930] Mm
Alison (PS147)                       [931] It'll be the Queen, won't it?
Bob (PS149)                          [932] Well, let's keep your fingers
                                     crossed.
                                     [933] ... Well Grant should have tape
                                     loaded by now so I suppose I'd better go
                                     and see how he's getting on.
Alison (PS147)                       [934] Want to check it?
Bob (PS149)                          [935] So, yeah I'll go, I'll go and check.
Alison (PS147)                       [936] Now darling, let's get you to bed.

Bob (PS149)     [...]
Alison (PS147)  [1280] Of course.
Grant (PS148)   [1281] How much have we gotta pay?
Bob (PS149)     [1282] Is he paying more than us for apparatus cos ... I think
                they've bought one phone but the other one [...]
Alison (PS147)  [1283] But we are we own our phones.
Bob (PS149)     [1284] Yeah, but they've ... but they don't, they own one.
Alison (PS147)  [1285] Mm mm
Grant (PS148)   [1286] Look, Dad!
Bob (PS149)     [1287] They must rent the other one so that's what he's
                complaining about the charges.
                [1288] He says [...]
Grant (PS148)   [...]
Bob (PS149)     [1289] [...] and save all these charges.
Grant (PS148)   [1290] Dad, can you come upstairs and
Bob (PS149)     [1291] But I think he's thinking of buying another phone.
Grant (PS148)   [1292] and [...]

Alison (PS147)  [1300] it's still ridiculous because erm

Grant (PS148)   [1306] I'm playing cowboys and indians and
Bob (PS149)     [1307] No, you're supposed to be in prison.
Alison (PS147)  [1308] Grant, the people could come back in a few minutes
Bob (PS149)     [1309] So you have to go through them.
Grant (PS148)   [1310] Who?
Alison (PS147)  [1311] to tell daddy they've repaired the car.
                [1312] Daddy has to leave it at the garage.
Bob (PS149)     [...]
Alison (PS147)  [1313] They've got to repair daddy's car because it could be
                dangerous, Grant.
Grant (PS148)   [1314] There's not horse traffic wardens.
Alison (PS147)  [1315] I mentioned to Mrs Bobby, was it last week when we went
                to Glasgow?
                [1316] Yes, last week.
                [1317] And I said we just come out of the drive went across the
                road and there was just a bus behind us and erm ... I said the
                car almost came to a halt.
                [1318] I said and when we got to Glasgow I said there were
                people in a van blasting their horn they were absolutely
                mortified because
Bob (PS149)     [1319] Mortified!
Alison (PS147)  [1320] it came, it did it almost came to a halt again and it
                could've been dangerous as well you, children in the back, two
                children in the back!
Bob (PS149)     [1321] Yes, it's stuttery.
Alison (PS147)  [1322] Oh it was unpleasant!
Bob (PS149)     [1323] [...] fixed it now.
                [1324] [...] fixed it [...] reasonable.
Alison (PS147)  [1325] I also said every morning you went to work you were
                terrified, Bobby.
                [1326] You'd sit at the gate for ages in, in the hope that the
                road would be clear as well.
Bob (PS149)     [1327] Yes, you're never sure [...]
Alison (PS147)  [1328] You're never sure his car would stop, Grant and there
                was going to be somebody behind daddy coming up Alexander
                Street very, very fast and then jumped into daddy's back!
                [1329] It could've!

Bob (PS149)     [1334] I've gotta, gotta go and see if Stuart's back.
Grant (PS148)   [1335] and I've been playing with my computer.
Alison (PS147)  [1336] That seems a bit silly to take five minutes to load up
                and
Grant (PS148)   [1337] I've watched, I've been watching my cartoons
Alison (PS147)  [1338] and you've gotta wait
Grant (PS148)   [1339] on T V.
Alison (PS147)  [1340] He can handle that computer scrabble beautifully, Bobby

Alison (PS147)  [1354] the scrabble board and then Grant
Grant (PS148)   [1355] [shouting] It's not cheating [] !
Alison (PS147)  [1356] Grant decided
Grant (PS148)   [1357] It's not cheating.

Alison (PS147)  [1368] Mm mm.

Bob (PS149)     [1370] [...] Annabel she's too young.
Alison (PS147)  [1371] Mummy was in the kitchen here and the computer played
                me.
Grant (PS148)   [1372] Then you need [...]
Alison (PS147)  [1373] It's wonderful but I do like the educational games
                preferably to the fun games
Grant (PS148)   [1374] and then you need a [...] and it was so slow!
Alison (PS147)  [1375] Was slow when?
Grant (PS148)   [1376] It was, it's slow when you don't have the computer just
                doing it on its own.
                [1377] It's really slow.

Alison (PS147)  [1514] St Lucia St Lucia.
Bob (PS149)     [1515] Yeah.
Alison (PS147)  [1516] When Raymond came and did the windows last week, he said
                he'd booked up ... I [...]
Grant (PS148)   [1517] I've got
Alison (PS147)  [1518] [...] the same time as we go to Cyprus and he hasn't
                actually booked a flight yet but he's got the villa cos Aily a
                few doors along, remember she's got a villa in erm
Bob (PS149)     [1519] Aye, [...]
Alison (PS147)  [1520] it's near, it's near Orlando.
                [1521] What?
Bob (PS149)     [1522] Is it her villa he cleans her windows?
Grant (PS148)   [1523] My horse!
Alison (PS147)  [1524] Yes, he cleans her windows as well.
                [1525] Her name's Ann
Grant (PS148)   [1526] Dad!
Alison (PS147)  [1527] because he mentioned and I said is that the lady that
                lives in America?
Grant (PS148)   [1528] My horse ran away!
Bob (PS149)     [1529] Mummy's speaking [...]
Grant (PS148)   [1530] My horse ran away so I got away.
Alison (PS147)  [1531] Remember last year when they went to America [...]
Bob (PS149)     [1532] So the [...] again last year, were they?
Alison (PS147)  [1533] Slightly younger than me erm, no, but he'd mentioned
                that and he said erm
Bob (PS149)     [...]
Alison (PS147)  [1534] if he wanted to book again that she could let her, his,
                her villa.
                [1535] So it's free for October, the complete month of October
                and erm he hasn't booked a flight yet because the fares are so
                expensive.
Bob (PS149)     [1536] [...] ... Did he tell you how much they charge?
Alison (PS147)  [1537] Yes.
                [1538] The last time you saw Raymond, remember he said it was
                erm, how much further.
                [1539] I think there's gonna be six this time.
                [1540] There's Raymond and his wife and his wife Sherry's I
                think brother and his wife and little baby and then somebody
                else.
                [1541] So there'll be six people.
                [1542] So they've got to book the flight but they might book it
                nearer the time when hopefully they'll get a cheaper flight.
                [1543] He's tried direct flights and so on but he thought four
                hundred pounds, four hundred and fifty was a bit much although

                times we've been at the station, Bobby
