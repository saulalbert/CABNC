*ENA:	Oh you won't need sixteen megabytes even if you decide to  improve the  let's unpack that  thing and then we'll see how much space we're talking about  how much of that's padding and how of that is  real thing,. •473772_487542•
        I was taught that  when I worked in the grocery warehouse. •490292_501002•

        Right! •576942_577082•
        Before I realised I've got mine. •577082_577912•
        Okay ! •577912_578002•
*ALA:	It is slightly bigger than the other one isn't it? •578002_581702•

        Oh the screen  mm, about the same size. •585452_587862•
*ENA:	It's a little bit bigger  I think you'll find  if you put the tape measure on it you'll find it's a little bit bigger. •587932_609482•
        Right. •609552_609692•
        Right. •609692_609822•
*ALA:	Presumably this is the power supply for it? •609992_622232•
*ENA:	Yeah. •622232_622412•
        Woops! •622412_622472•

        How many spare points you got? •627302_643142•
*ALA:	Erm  one at the moment, but I can pull out the radio without any problem. •644192_648072•
*ENA:	Oh fine. •648072_648412•
        It's a  •649672_651232•
*ALA:	No, one of these spools    •651232_654322•

*ALA:	No, I just, thinking it's easier if I take it down this way. •668732_671552•
*ENA:	Oh alright. •673812_674152•
*ALA:	Then I pull it  . •675302_676482•
*ENA:	Now,. •676962_677022•
        Ultimately  er  they might change the lead on the end of that monitor. •686802_692342•
        What's the matter? •692342_695552•
*ALA:	I was wondering  where the socket is. •695552_699182•
        Oh I see where it's gone! •699182_700252•
*ENA:	Right! •701942_702132•

*ENA:	Oh yes. •709862_710062•
*ALA:	Right. •710772_710872•
*ENA:	Now if I'd have been sensible •710872_722382•
*ALA:	Yes. •722502_722902•
*ENA:	which I really am  I'd have brought over  my •723252_730672•
*ALA:	Oh! •732472_733042•
*ENA:	what's his name? •734062_738072•
        My monitor. •738072_739142•
*ALA:	Why? •739142_739572•
*ENA:	Well  if I'd swapped monitors with you can and I don't suppose you'll wanna get rid of your Amstrad today •741772_748722•
*ALA:	No. •749262_749662•
*ENA:	and you'll probably want to keep it for a little while? •749962_752172•
*ALA:	Yes. •752172_752522•
*ENA:	Oh hang on, moving leads and things  don't stand up! •752732_755542•
        Not just yet anyway. •755542_756742•

*ENA:	Erm  I could of taken the black and white one •759482_763402•
*ALA:	Mm. •763402_763552•

*ALA:	Yes. •816462_816802•
*ENA:	we could actually drive the monitor off the box and you'd only need one socket. •817222_820922•
*ALA:	Well it doesn't really matter because I got  and unused socket here. •820922_825732•
*ENA:	Yeah but I mean  if you in some ways it's easier  cos then when you turn it off, you turn everything off. •825732_831702•

        At the back somewhere usually. •853002_856382•
        Then  we can turn it on and see if it all works. •857132_861362•

*ENA:	Before we lose any of it! •111820_112175•

        Fine, that's alright. •128902_128943•
        I'll just add it to the end, that's all I was thinking. •128944_129170•
        Sometimes the  they make a fuss if you put them in the wrong place. •129170_129393•
        No  not at the moment. •129393_129827•
        Yeah. •129827_129836•

        But I suppose you've got more complicated setups than me? •134011_134251•
        What? •134251_134307•

        Now let's find out something! •135383_135944•
        Just check that that boots properly. •136156_136445•
        Control alt  it's deleted  segment but we don't really  need that. •136445_137618•
        We'll let it just  setup isn't really that erm  you can do fancy things! •137643_138060•
        Er  that's a  I think what we'll do is we'll get used to it. •138391_138875•
*ALA:	Mm. •138876_138877•
*ENA:	So I'll just  put that there. •138877_138986•
        Would you be turning that round there ? •138987_139696•
*ALA:	I can do that sometimes but I don't •139696_140264•
*ENA:	Erm  no, soon as you get an ordinary chip dot bat  file •140264_140548•
*ALA:	Mm. •140548_140581•
*ENA:	erm  it will  it reads the clock   automatically. •140581_141241•
        We'll just have to set it once but it hasn't done it. •141903_142311•
        It's no good setting now because if there's no alt  dot bat •142311_142548•
*ALA:	it won't keep it? •142549_142670•
*ENA:	Yeah. •142750_142767•

*ALA:	Mm. •198534_198543•
*ENA:	Now let's   boot it and see what happens. •198543_199356•

*ALA:	These two •213618_213639•
*ENA:	doesn't care! •213656_213722•
*ALA:	You see those two are right at the end, and those  I don't know whether those ought to be together  before XX. •213722_214422•
*ENA:	Well it, they're  •214422_214517•
*ALA:	So  •214546_214573•
*ENA:	all in one directory. •214573_214608•
*ALA:	It doesn't matter? •214608_214680•
*ENA:	It doesn't care! •214687_214842•
*ALA:	I see! •214851_214889•
*ENA:	It's called Bible isn't it? •214889_214961•
*ALA:	Yes. •214961_215021•

        Well you could leave those  couldn't you? •236439_236731•
*ENA:	No, it's alright! •237140_237334•
        I like to check that it all works  you know? •237337_237638•
        Get a few things on it and check that it works . •237638_238707•
        It won't take long. •238707_238844•
*ALA:	Right you are! •238872_239017•
*ENA:	How many discs did you say this was? •239017_239154•

*ALA:	I've  just put the kettle on. •240995_241108•
*ENA:	Oh! •241108_241114•
*ALA:	I thought you might be ready for one. •241114_241894•
*ENA:	Actually they spend more time  changing discs probably than the •242220_242599•
*ALA:	Than the actual copying, yes. •243034_243129•
        Well you can't help it when you copy  •244948_245737•
*ENA:	Well look at the speed it takes a disc onto the hard disc! •245746_246226•
        Watch! •246226_246238•
*ALA:	Now is that a file? •246238_246286•
*ENA:	That's a whole file! •246286_246362•
*ALA:	Oh yes, it takes , spends longer reading than it is  ! •246362_246876•
*ENA:	Oh yeah! •246891_246932•
        Much longer! •246986_247002•
*ALA:	Yeah. •247002_247005•
*ENA:	Well it's longer, it's about ten times as long! •247005_247566•
*ALA:	Ha! •247566_247572•
        Oh because that's the er •247572_247746•
*ENA:	That's a slow floppy innit? •247809_248015•
*ALA:	Mm. •248022_248035•
*ENA:	Floppies are, that is terrible! •248155_248240•
        I'm up to book fourteen . •248240_248380•
*ALA:	You what? •248391_248478•
*ENA:	I'm up to book fifteen! •248486_253697•
*ALA:	Oh! •254969_254976•
*ENA:	Oh I'm more than half way through! •255068_259877•
        Only nine left. •259885_260120•
*ALA:	Good! •260120_260124•
        Suppose I could of put this  out there  ? •260125_260873•
*ENA:	What are doing? •260874_260896•
        It should be going down. •260896_261074•
        Fortunately this'll be the biggest job of all! •261074_265270•
        I suppose actually loading Wordperfect will be the slowest job of all. •265270_270172•
        Always takes a bit longer  doesn't it? •270172_270318•
*ALA:	Mm. •270318_270347•
        It's er  there's not so many discs to load though. •270347_270843•
*ENA:	No? •270862_270871•
*ALA:	There's not so many discs. •270883_271319•
*ENA:	No, but er  I can't just do this with it! •271320_271926•
*ALA:	No. •271926_271934•
        Where are you going? •272004_272096•
*ENA:	Just wanna look at those. •272096_272392•
        .I mean Autoroute's only about three files. •272392_272764•
        Only got  •272764_273443•
*ALA:	Yeah. •273443_273456•
*ENA:	three discs so that won't take very long. •273456_276485•
        D-base is what? •276485_276571•
        Five at the moment. •276571_276724•
        You know it says book forty, do you have to know which books you want to go into? •276724_277036•
*ALA:	Yes  erm  er, it's on a file somewhere. •277059_277873•
*ENA:	Oh! •277873_277883•
        No, is it? •277889_277930•
        It's not the easiest thing to •277936_278168•
*ALA:	No, that's one of the  •278177_278595•
*ENA:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	reasons why I've made little use of it. •278595_279054•
        Erm •279054_279067•
*ENA:	Never mind! •279067_279111•
*ALA:	I could probably re-name them? •279125_279290•
*ENA:	To make it easier to remember, except it  maybe it refers to it, maybe it uses book something to refer to them. •279290_280237•
        You might have to write the whole programme again to do that. •280242_280561•
*ALA:	Oh well, maybe I'd better not try then! •280561_280823•
        There's some coffee here. •280823_280893•
*ENA:	Sorry, I've nearly finished this. •280893_281021•
        I'd like to get it done before I •281042_281207•
