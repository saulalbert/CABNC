*KEI:	Now all I can think of doing is pushing it, you can push the turner things into chips then you've only got to chop them one way if you see what I mean, like erm, well is it worth these doing anything else?
*GIN:	But why , (        ) chop.
*VIC:	I mean, what else would you use it for?Do you use it to slice? or to grate? or to erm
*GIN:	No.
*VIC:	use the grate   (        ) like things like  (        ) .
*GIN:	Aha.
*VIC:	 (        ) .

*GIN:	I was a bit disappointed.
*VIC:	Well, yes, I must admit still I still chop  (        ) 
*VIC:	But there's nothing in there to say it's from   (        ) there's nothing on the box to say it's.
*GIN:	Well   (        )  (        ) 
*VIC:	Could you be bothered getting that out unless you're prepared   (        ) wash all, all the bits afterwards.
*GIN:	 (        )  (.) 
*VIC:	 ((laugh))  (        ) , I'm sure it's   (        ) somebody else  (        ) .
*GIN:	Yes.
*VIC:	I do because  (        ) 
*GIN:	Yeah, somebody else  (        ) .
*VIC:	Well
*GIN:	What did you say  (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah, you, you, get a, a thing on, ah there you are.
*GIN:	I thought, I thought it's  (        ) .
*VIC:	Usually they give you a, a thing to return it, you know, a thing that you don't want it  (        ) , (        ) girls let you take the orders down   (        ) the ware house, oh, (        ) put the   (        ) return it too cos the, cos there's nothing in there.I, (        ) .You can buy those things that you push down on the top like that, and you
*UNK:	I thought that you can have one of those   (        ) that you roll side by side
*VIC:	 (        ) .It's like a knife but it's curved and it's got a  (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Yes, you just rock it backwards and forwards.
*UNK:	Oh  (        ) 
*GIN:	 (        ) , ((laugh)) .
*VIC:	I don't know, you  (        ) .
*UNK:	Ah, again, it might, it might  (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	I've, I've got a little knife, I don't know where I got it from, on it, on it, it says   (        ) steel and it's all broken the blade because, you know, it's been used so much and it's sharper for even being broken than any thing else I've got.
*GIN:	Great.
*VIC:	Yeah, I don't know where I got it from ,
*GIN:	 (        ) ,
*VIC:	no, heaven knows what will happen to me when I've, when I got it any more, I use it all the time.
