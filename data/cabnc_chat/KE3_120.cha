*TON:	Oh Brian annoyed me on my lesson   (.) I pulled up to the Kingsway   (.) right? ((cough))  (.) And I was wanting to turn left
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	going along the Kingsway coming back from the driv the driving test centre
*JAC:	Oh I know.
*TON:	yeah?
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	And there's a filter light   (.) and he said oh you'll be waiting here ages put it in neutral   (.) just as 
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*TON:	just as I did it the bloody filter light came on
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) he's silly 
*TON:	and you oh 
*JAC:	I don't know why he makes you do that   (.) I mean it's   (.) if that was something the  (.) I mean all Tony used to ever say when we were at traffic lights were   (.) if you want to   (.) you can put the handbrake on at this set of traffic lights   (.) if they were downhill
*TON:	Mhm.
*JAC:	because erm   (.) there will be   (.) oh what was I it's alright I was concentrating   (.) said you can put the handbrake on these set of traffic lights if you like   (.) because you might be sat here a while and your foot will ache   (.) you know?
*TON:	Good grief   (.) wha I always have to put the handbrake on at traffic lights.
*JAC:	No   (.) he says it's a   (.) Tony used to say to me it's entirely up to you   (.) hi traffic lights coming up hill yes   (.) but down hill   (.) no it's   (.) you needn't you can sit there wi ready with the foot brake.
*TON:	Mm   (.) yeah Brian's argument to that is   (.) that er if you've got   (.) if you were hit   (.) in the back
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	you would tend to raise your foot off the brake   (.) sort of jump and take your foot off the brake and you'd go forward and hit the car in front.
*JAC:	Well the handbrake is only a parking brake the handbrake only o operates on two wheels in any case
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	not four   (.) so the handbr I mean the fact that you can drive with the handbrake on
*TON:	yeah.
*JAC:	if you're insistent about it   (.) you know?
*TON:	 ((laugh))  (.) yeah.
*JAC:	Erm tells you a lot it wouldn't erm   (.) if somebody hit you in the back you'd still move if you had the handbrake on.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	In fact probably you'd move more   (.) cos he says yo your instinct is take your feet off   (.) I think your instinct would be to jump on it all the harder.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Cos the instinct would be to stop the car from moving.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	If you see what I mean.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	No then I might be wrong I don't know   (.) but all this   (.) putting the car in neutral   (.) goodness knows what!
*TON:	It only makes you slower away.
*JAC:	It does it just makes you slower getting away
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	and one of the things is that's important is   (.) hesitancy
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	or la and lack of it   (.)  (        ) .
*TON:	But ha I remember I was on my test and I pulled round   (.) er it was very, very busy and there were two rows of cars   (.) and I pulled up   (.) and I thought right there's a gap down there and I want to go straight on and all these others were turning le  (.) turning right so I squeezed down through the gap   (.) and then I thought right I'm gonna be here a little while shall I put it in neutral, blow no I won't.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	So gi given the   (.) unless somebody's out   (.) unless you're if he'd actually tells me to do it   (.) I will say   (.) I was sort of oh alright and do it.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Yeah but   (.) mm.
*JAC:	No he he makes you do an awful lot of things that are really unnecessary.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Well I mean   (.) I passed my test an I weren't made to do any of that.
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	I would have thought how stupid it was   (.) if I'd been made do it.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	That's why I think I've said to you on occasions oh   (.) you know 
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	what are you doing that for sort of thing.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I bet your Mum's thinking we're not coming.
*TON:	 (        ) .
