@Comment:	conversation #20 (Tape 040907)
*FRA:	Well I think that's a bit prettier. (.) 
*STE:	Oh that's a bit livelier innit? (.) It's more solid innit? (.) I'll get you the hand set   (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Mm    (        )  (.) should   (        ) back. (.) Perhaps it wasn't   (        ) anyway. (.) 
*STE:	Think it goes by itself alright.
*FRA:	When you get past   (        ) it's not too bad. ((laugh))  (.) That should er do it. (.) Oh that's still a bit high innit?Got the width there. (.) 
*STE:	Quite good these fast text ones   (        ) aren't they?
*FRA:	Yes excellent.
*STE:	Well you wouldn't have known   (        ) fast text without the right hand set would you?
*FRA:	No you wouldn't.
*STE:	 (        ) said fast text on it. (.) Do you want your picture back so you can see  (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah I'll put it on mix.
*STE:	Mix er   (.) I'm not sure what mix is on this one.
*FRA:	That's it. (.) Mm typical dark screen at the top. (.)  (        ) I don't know, you can't tell can you?No. (.) Let's got back to another station shall we? (.) Looks like it's alright. (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) ?
*FRA:	Yeah, that looks alright. (.) Yeah that's alright.
*STE:	Yep.It's a   (        ) innit  (        ) ? (        ) it's just the edge of the screen innit?Or is it?Oh yes it's the black edge of the    (.)  (        ) reflecting on it innit?
*FRA:	Yeah, that's alright.
*STE:	Yeah.Yeah super. (        ) 
*FRA:	Brilliant.It's not brilliant but it's a lot better.
*STE:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Had to laugh yesterday towards the end of er our round, it was really tipping down, misty, fog, couldn't see a hundred yards   (.) I had this almighty s I said well I'll let the six iron, I did this almighty swing   (.) the ball went one way and the club went right up the top of a tree.It must've been fifteen foot at least up in the air   (.) teetering on a top branch.
*STE:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	I thought oh my god, lost me six iron, all of a sudden crash, it came down.
*STE:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Old Louis he didn't know which way anything had gone.He said well I couldn't see any of that   (.) didn't even see the club go up the tree. (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) different hand set works the black stripe.
*FRA:	Does it? (.) What one of Alistair's?
*STE:	Yeah, does it work everything though?Doesn't work that does it?No, it works the text   (.) doesn't work the   (.) colour   (        ) the on screen display, one of them, innit? (.) and one of them   (.) and that   (.) er and that. (.) That one didn't work either    (        )  (.) gonna try and   (.) there's no on screen display on these is there?So   (        ) 
*FRA:	Shouldn't think s 
*STE:	won't work will it?This type.So these are the only ones we can't put them with.
*FRA:	Oh right.
*STE:	All the later ones we can   (.) but I've got a couple more of these ones that work this one coming anyway so  (.) 
*FRA:	But it changes channel dunnit?And   (.) does it give you volume or not?
*STE:	Changes channel and does volume I think   (        ) 
*FRA:	And   (        ) and everything.
*STE:	Erm   (.) yeah that one does   (        ) 
*FRA:	So I mean it'll do everything barring    (.)  (        ) 
*STE:	No that other one doesn't
*FRA:	No.
*STE:	the one we got as a   (.) a master text one doesn't
*FRA:	No.
*STE:	but one of these would.That one would.
*FRA:	Right. (.) 
*STE:	So if we want some of these as well well we ain't gonna get cheaper to go with these whatever happens we know that.
*FRA:	Yeah.
*STE:	 (        ) albeit the wrong one.They have got manual settings on there haven't they?
*FRA:	That's right, that's what I thought.I mean it's
*STE:	Yeah.
*FRA:	you don't, how, how often do you use the brightness control on the
*STE:	Yeah yeah
*FRA:	telly?
*STE:	Channel change, text   (.) 0 one   (.) four 0 one   (        ) oh
*FRA:	 (        ) 
*STE:	 (        ) just gives hold dunnit    (        )  (.) yeah. (        ) don't work on that one then.I'll try one of these others. (.)  (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	 (        ) well we haven't got the right one for those then. (.) 
*STE:	Still  (.) 
*FRA:	Don't see so many of those now erm  (.) 
*STE:	I should think this is the same as the non-stereo one, for hand set-wise innit?
*FRA:	Yeah.
*STE:	Try that last one.Well it won't text will it?No. (.) 
*FRA:	 (        ) come in the bags do they, that lot?
*STE:	Yeah.
*FRA:	Mm.
*STE:	Yeah   (        ) bags. (        ) know what they go with but
*FRA:	 (        ) 
*STE:	just give the bags. (.) Nice little  (        ) 
*FRA:	Yes. (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Mm  (.) 
*STE:	This one doesn't even text. (.)  (        )  (.) No well that's alright.We've got the two most important ones.
*FRA:	I suppose there isn't a little knob on it that would just happen to work zeros? (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) er    (        )  (.) no   (.) text   (.) well  (.) 
*FRA:	Very nice, (        ) 
*STE:	So we've got one two three four five six   (.) seven eight   (.) nine   (.) timer    (.)  (        ) You'd of thought it would erase that time on time off thing innit  (        ) ?
*FRA:	Yes.Yeah. (        ) hit again usually.
*STE:	 (        )  (.) Dunno.Maybe    (        )  (.) no  (.) 
*FRA:	I suppose it's cos it's the wrong   (        ) unit is it?
*STE:	Could be I suppose. (.) 
*FRA:	 (        ) couldn't it?
*STE:	Yeah. (.) 
*FRA:	Right. (.) Has Jim been in yet?No. (.) 
*STE:	No. (.) 
*FRA:	Oh   (        ) put that back into store now. (.) So when erm   (.) Robert comes in we've got one   (.) two  (.) 
*STE:	There's three there I think.
*FRA:	Oh yeah that grey one. (.) 
*STE:	Erm   (        ) still got   (        ) for Sanyos.
*FRA:	Do they?Mm that's interesting. (.) 
*STE:	Is that Fidelity   (.) have we ordered bits for that or is that er  (.) 
*FRA:	Yeah we did. (.) Well we tried to order a manual didn't we?
*STE:	Somebody wanted to buy it as a non-worker but I said well I said we'd ordered a part for it so  (.) 
*FRA:	Er now did we?I'm trying to think.
*STE:	That's right, we ordered a    (.)  (        ) manual   (        ) they couldn't get   (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Oh yeah they've got one forty R on there but, I mean you look at the set and it says er   (.) where did I get the number? (.) Fourteen 0 four R.  (.)
