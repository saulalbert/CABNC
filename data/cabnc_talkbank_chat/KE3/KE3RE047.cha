*PS0V6:	I 'll get you 'll have to go just go right to the back just at the back otherwise you 're gon na be flipping through millions of pages .  1274163_1285913
*PS0V5:	Okay Can I do it on there .  1285913_1287143
*PS0V6:	Yes yes okay .  1287433_1288353
*PS0V5:	Look you start off and you 've got your trunk okay .  1290503_1295093
*PS0V6:	Yeah .  1295093_1295213
*PS0V5:	What have n't you got you got two or three perhaps two big ones .  1296443_1303193
*PS0V4:	Can you turn that up .  1303283_1304243
*PS0V5:	coming off at the trunk see like that .  1304683_1309493
*PS0V6:	Mm .  1309493_1309633
*PS0V5:	and you .  1309633_1309873
*PS0V6:	Oh I see what you mean now .  1309873_1310643
*PS0V5:	another one like that and then what happens is you 've got smaller branches lots of smaller branches coming off of piece .  1310643_1318653
*PS0V6:	Yeah and then it joins up together does n't it .  1319013_1321843
*PS0V5:	and then you 've got smaller branches coming off of the smaller branches .  1322053_1325343
*PS0V6:	Mm .  1325343_1325773
*PS0V5:	and it makes twigs .  1325933_1327603
*PS0V6:	Yeah .  1327603_1327813
*PS0V5:	So you 've got an this this branch will keep going perhaps until it gets really tiny .  1328013_1340573
*PS0V6:	It 's incredible cos all the little bits join together I mean what 's that .  1341003_1345373
*PS0V4:	No they do n't they cross over and they tangle up but once a branch starts off it does n't join on to another one .  1345373_1357123
*PS0V6:	I did n't mean that I meant when you look at a tree it 's sort of got .  1357123_1367123
*PS0V4:	A cris-cross .  1367243_1368323
*PS0V6:	yeah sometimes you get a tree like with a little bit coming off the side .  1368323_1373923
*PS0V4:	Mm .  1373923_1374113
*PS0V6:	and then it 's sort of joined together onto another branch and then there 's a branch there .  1374113_1378473
*PS0V4:	No I don' know what you mean .  1378473_1380103
*PS0V6:	Er it 's hard to explain I ca n't explain that .  1380103_1383213
*PS0V8:	As Daddy says once they come out they do n't join onto another .  1383213_1387233
*PS0V4:	You see that one would sort of .  1387233_1388983
*PS0V6:	Mhm .  1389173_1389393
*PS0V4:	carry on going and that one would go up behind it .  1389393_1392633
*PS0V5:	Look Christine if I draw it .  1392633_1394913
*PS0V6:	Yeah .  1394913_1395073
*PS0V5:	as a diagram rather than as a tree Right you 've got one branch .  1395073_1397623
*PS0V6:	Yeah .  1397623_1397843
*PS0V5:	you start off with one branch like that .  1397843_1400303
*PS0V6:	Mm .  1400493_1400623
*PS0V5:	now that branch will divide into to two or you 'll get one one bit coming off the side you might get another one up here .  1402523_1413733
*PS0V6:	Mm .  1413733_1413833
*PS0V5:	right So they 're going to go see then you get other branches coming off of that one .  1413963_1419603
*PS0V6:	Mm .  1419653_1419793
*PS0V5:	the same and other branches coming off of that one and other branches coming off of that one it 's sort of gets smaller and smaller and is gets .  1419793_1431603
*PS0V6:	Mm .  1431653_1431823
*PS0V5:	so you you 've got perhaps two off of there and then another one off of the side of there and as you go it gets it gets sl slightly smaller each time see what I mean .  1431823_1454073
*PS0V6:	Yes and it comes to just to to the .  1454193_1457863
*PS0V5:	to the .  1458233_1458673
*PS0V6:	light one then you stop do n't you .  1458673_1460573
*PS0V5:	Yeah that 's right see see what I mean .  1460673_1467103
*PS0V6:	Yeah .  1467773_1468053
*PS0V5:	It ge it you just sort of keep going until it stops .  1468143_1477923
*PS0V6:	Right I 'll clean that up and start again this is brilliant .  1478043_1495373
*PS0V4:	Mhm .  1495373_1495743
*PS0V6:	Have you seen that .  1495743_1498233

*PS0V8:	Did it work then did it .  1528963_1531203
*PS0V5:	Yeah it literally it 's like sticking a sticking plaster on your legs and pulling it off .  1531203_1535753
*PS0V8:	and tearing it off urgh .  1535753_1536673
*PS0V5:	Only it holds onto the hairs so much that it rips them out so that you end up with legs with no hairs on it but ah It 's best done very quickly .  1536823_1546023
*PS0V8:	My legs have never been hairy .  1546323_1548873
