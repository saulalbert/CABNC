*CAR:	It needs   (        ) practice.
*CAR:	Yes.
*CAR:	Well, because it's, it's rather a case of the blind leading the   (.) the blind, erm
*CAR:	I think they're both   (        ) separately, but they
*CAR:	Yes, now you, you played stuff just as difficult as this, and   (        ) there's no, no problem, don't do it too quickly though, and, I don't mind if it's not finished next week, or the week after, it's the quality we want, so, so, don't, don't rush it.Just, if I were you I'd just do a little on it, every time you practised, and then put it away.

*CAR:	Oh yes, ((laugh)) , then   (        ) except miracles.
*CAR:	No I, no, I mean you really respond very well, that Tchaikovsky was lovely, I understand at the present you can't do as much and admirable as you're still doing.
*CAR:	Well I have to have something to do by myself.
*CAR:	Yes, well yes surely make that or otherwise you, if you give up everything.
*CAR:	Yeah, even if it's only ten minutes a day, at least it's something.
*CAR:	Oh yes, yes, I think we all need, even, even if, plain, life is full of playing games and the game can help you get through the day sometimes.
*CAR:	That's right.
*CAR:	So, right let's hear the right hand.
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	Yeah, just erm, that was fine, fingering here, erm, why do you put a, put a four on that, I, I would of thought that, that is more sensible, you put   (        ) into the next note down, let's try that, er mm 
*CAR:	 ((laugh))
