*ADA:	Yeah. •121427_121440•

*CAR:	Yeah. •123376_123387•
        Clever. •123415_123445•
*ADA:	It's a small enough tape innit? •123519_123663•
*CAR:	It is really . •123663_123785•
        Let's go and do a bit of spying. •123822_123905•

*CAR:	Mm. •130803_130839•
*ADA:	so •130998_131012•
*CAR:	concerts and things, but you can, you can tell, with just, just by listening that it's not just any old body tinkling on the piano, it's wonderful, it makes you sick. •131014_132251•
*ADA:	Is Charlotte going to learn to play it? •132286_132594•
*CAR:	Well I hope she'll be interested enough to, but, not really before she's six, cos I asked him last couple of times ago, he said, what sort of age, cos obviously the size of the hands comes into it, they can't do too much, but he said he wouldn't consider before six and you ought'a have to take the parents into consideration, of a child that age you gotta have a parent who's prepared to sit there and make sure the child does what he's set them to do, because , oh Amy, you not getting any  out of that. •132604_137227•
        Have you finished it? •137303_137605•
        Ha, you big lump. •137625_137678•

*ADA:	Eh, oh, O K, I'll find out tonight. •140586_141137•
*CAR:	Oh of course, Wednesday. •141149_141275•
*ADA:	The way in to work, cycled there last week. •141275_141601•
*CAR:	Oh my. •141696_141725•
*ADA:	I had to, Richard had taken the car , he takes it in the morning, but •141740_142155•
*CAR:	Oh my goodness,. •142155_142228•
*ADA:	Well he  he takes the car to school, but, and it, sorry takes the car to work and before he's bringing the car home and then he's been going to school on his bike. •142228_143467•
*CAR:	Oh right. •143467_143541•
*ADA:	So of course the bike, the car's for me to use in the evening, but last •143541_144027•
*CAR:	You cycle home from here and then ? •144027_144161•
*ADA:	from you, then you get changed and then go, but, last week he took the car, cos when I got home, first I was late last Wednesday, well I say late, I didn't get back here, erm, until seven, so by the time I got home it was quarter past seven and I have to make sure I get to Weightwatchers between seven and eight. •144161_146202•
*CAR:	Oh, for the weigh in? •146239_146404•
*ADA:	Mm, so I had to go, quickly get changed, and cos it, it, I normally I just wear a pair, a pair of sandals and light weight clothing, but •146404_147666•
*CAR:	Oh dear. •147727_147801•
*ADA:	so, I couldn't go in sandals, well obviously I can't cycle in a pair of sandals on •147858_148285•
*CAR:	Can't really cycle with a floating skirt on either, can you? •148285_148633•
*ADA:	The last  with me leggings on and this top on. •148639_148988•
        Well, I looked a bit of a sight, but I thought well, well, you know, what else can I do, I mean I couldn't take clothing to get changed in to. •149006_149930•
*CAR:	Well, they wouldn't expect you to would they? •149930_150178•
*ADA:	I've, I'd got a few stares from some of the women there, I mean, there are some women there that are huge, and maybe they looked at me and thought oh I hope I can wear leggings like that one day , I mean I don't think I look too bad in the leggings, I mean I would never have done it when I used to go to Weightwatchers when I was thirteen and a half stone, I would never of gone in leggings, no way, but it doesn't •150178_152700•
*CAR:	Well you don't, you don't really look as if you need to lose weight cos it's probably why you got a few stares, it's like all the diet books that have sylphlike people on the front. •152701_153756•
*ADA:	Well . •153762_153780•
        I mean I spoke to Jane the other Sunday and I, I said to her you know, just be honest, I said I don't care what you said, but just be honest and tell me how much you think I weigh, cos she doesn't know how much I weigh and she thought I weighed about ten stone, I said well stick thirteen pounds on top of that , then you'll be right, she couldn't believe that I, that I weighed that much, so obviously it doesn't look that bad and people at work, well they've noticed that I've lost weight, but they don't say how much they think I weigh, so I don't want  come to them to sort of, have a, have a have a guess of my weight. •153800_158339•
*CAR:	Guess the weight of a Suzie. •158345_158411•
*ADA:	Yeah, but they have noticed which is something I suppose. •158411_158791•
        There's somebody came in today, a guy came in today who used to work with us who usually comes in occasionally and I would see him, but for a few weeks now, so he noticed it. •158809_160194•
        It's nice that people say it to you unprompted. •160202_160557•
*CAR:	Oh yes, you say I'm on a diet, they say oh well you have lost a lot of weight then. •160557_161096•
*ADA:	Yeah. •161096_161132•
*CAR:	Adam's mum's like that. •161186_161372•
*ADA:	Oh is she? •161435_161462•
*CAR:	She knows you're dieting, every time she sees you, ooh you've lost a lot of weight. •161462_161817•
*ADA:	Even when you haven't, yeah, but erm, no I mean, there is a guy at work, I mean there is a guy at work that's constantly saying to me, oh it's really noticing, it's really started, he says this every day, and he, after a while, I mean it's nice to be told it, once in a while, but not every day. •161928_164000•
*CAR:	But not every day, it loses value doesn't it? •164000_164171•
*ADA:	Oh it does, and he said to me, erm this afternoon, he said eh, oh he said eh, your weight loss is really, really noticing this week, and I thought well, even if I had lost weight this week it's only going to be a couple of pounds, and a couple of pounds would not notice. •164171_165588•
*CAR:	Plus the different clothes you wear. •165588_165739•
*ADA:	It doesn't matter who you are, two pounds won't make any difference to your appearance, I mean, yeah I suppose clotheswise •165739_166255•
*CAR:	Well as you, as you get smaller, two pounds does notice, it's when you're  •166255_166774•
*ADA:	Maybe it does. •166775_166797•
*CAR:	when you're bigger, and you've got a real lot to lose, and two pounds is nothing. •166797_167274•
