        And it's only a quid to get in and it's a pound, pound a pint. •_•
*HUG:	Two quid and, and a drink, yeah. •_•
*BAR:	But on the other hand they're making a little bit at a pound a pint. •_•
*HUG:	Well they're making five or six hundred, they're bound  •_•
*BAR:	 ((clears throat))

*BAR:	That's right. •_•
        That's getting in the  •_•
*HUG:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	I don't think they've got a lot of staff on. •_•
        I wouldn't have thought they'd bother with a  •_•
*HUG:	No. •_•
*BAR:	student night, having a lot of staff on, it's pointless having  ah, I mean, the bouncers  in that situation. •_•
*HUG:	Well you'd only need one. •_•
        But we don't need a bouncer on  •_•
*BAR:	Except, mind you, the, the rough, the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er, a rough  seeing to. •_•
*HUG:	What band? •_•

*TER:	Mm. •_•
*HUG:	Does the Sugar House get that many people in? •_•
*BAR:	No. •_•
        No. •_•
        The Sugar House only opens er  Thursday, Friday, Saturday. •_•
        Or, or,we always have done. •_•
        I mean, we  we opened originally, first year, every night of the bloody week and it was pointless, absolutely pointless. •_•

*HUG:	Well it's on, it's on a Thursday, yeah. •_•
*BAR:	it's  it's legally bigger than the Empire but the Empire can get more people in cos he's got upstairs and  •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
*BAR:	that  •_•
*HUG:	Mm. •_•
*BAR:	see. •_•
        But, of course, erm for licensing they don't take that  particularly into consideration up there. •_•
*HUG:	Well they half upstairs  straight away. •_•
*BAR:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*HUG:	So er  •_•
*BAR:	I mean, I think, I, I think the Empire legally is  well I thought it was nine hundred •_•
*HUG:	Seven fifty I think. •_•
*BAR:	I can't think er   I don't know. •_•
        I think it's nine hundred. •_•
        I mean you could you could  •_•
*HUG:	Well I thought it was seven fifty. •_•
*BAR:	certainly get seventeen, eighteen hundred in there. •_•
*HUG:	Well yeah. •_•

*BAR:	Didn't they? •_•
        I mean the Sugar House, his capacity's  •_•
*HUG:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	just been  upped to eleven hundred I think. •_•
        Erm  I mean, it was always nine hundred, but it's been upped to eleven hundred last year I think. •_•
        Well we used to put, I mean, I put twelve, thirteen hundred in the Sugar House. •_•
        But but you  it's full at that, you know. •_•
*HUG:	Mm. •_•
*BAR:	Whereas the, the, the, you, you could  you could, you could fit sixteen, seventeen hundred. •_•
*HUG:	No, I reckon,there was,they reckon between a, a thousand and eleven hundred for a   night, you know. •_•
        But you couldn't fucking move at that. •_•
*BAR:	Yeah, but it was a, it was also a it was a bit of a celebrity, I mean it was  people, people were crushed around, bloody hell I mean  •_•

*HUG:	I had to leave. •_•
*BAR:	You'd fled us! •_•
        And gone to work for the opposition. •_•
*HUG:	Were you well I didn't reckon you were opposition. •_•
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*HUG:	But I did go out or something. •_•
