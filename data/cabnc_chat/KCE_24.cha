*HEL:	Yeah •122577_122610•
*SHE:	if you passed, if you failed the eleven plus and if you were clever enough, you could take an exam, like an entry exam to go, it's sort of if you improve from eleven to fifteen you could take an entry exam to go into grammar school then, so that you could take your G C E's  •122610_124204•
*HEL:	Like erm, but, like Miss  says some of the stuff on it was so rubbish, I mean like, there was somebody she knew, who their son failed the eleven plus twice and now they've got their P H D •124204_125832•

*SHE:	Mm, mm •126559_126609•
*HEL:	you know, it's so stupid innit? •126609_126849•
*SHE:	It's too young an age which to, erm •126849_127243•
*HEL:	Assess like that  •127243_127436•
*SHE:	judge , judge people and, and, and, split them like that •127476_127854•
*HEL:	Mm •127854_127872•
*SHE:	Too young. •127906_127952•
*HEL:	I mean it might be alright for the more intelligent people or whatever, cos they get the best teachers then don't they? •127952_128618•
        But I mean for the other people it's just, it's just rejection innit, you're not good enough  •128618_129152•

*HEL:	Yeah  •133734_133738•
*SHE:	it then for that lesson, but after that I couldn't remember again how to do it  •133738_133983•
*HEL:	That's, that's just like me that is, if I get into a rhythm and someone gives er, I can do it then, but if I just sit on a page, I think oh how do you do that? •133983_134810•
*SHE:	Mm, I can never remember the formulas, like your dad said formula for such and such a thing is so and so and that, but I could never remember them  so I was no good then, because I couldn't remember it  •134810_136011•

*HEL:	It's not, it's no bigger than our school •159661_159876•
*SHE:	Isn't it? •159876_159949•
*HEL:	No •159949_159960•
*SHE:	It's not got the same discipline  •159961_160091•
*HEL:	It's about the , well it's might, just a little bit bigger than our school, about another hundred or something, but that's, that's a drop in the ocean when you've got seven hundred there  that's like one in each class or something you know, extra •160098_161758•
*SHE:	Still there's no discipline  •161821_162426•

*HEL:	but I mean, but like I said, I said, I mean, I went, I went to the  like I changed then, I mean to be quite honest I didn't like it, I didn't like it •166223_167281•
*SHE:	What the same people in school? •167282_167415•
*HEL:	no I didn't , I never liked it, whether that was because I knew we weren't gonna be there, or, you know, I just, I was only there six months •167415_168393•
*SHE:	Mm  you would of done eventually, you would of got in alright, once you were settled and that •168393_169078•
*HEL:	I, you know, I just  I would of been alright if it was a bit more organised I don't  •169078_169765•
*SHE:	I think  •169765_169790•
*HEL:	know it never seemed quite very organised •169791_169895•
*SHE:	they sent it back, I think, I thought the twelve was, was quite good actually, I thought the twelve when they went up at twelve, but then when they changed it back to the junior and infants it was the , the eleven and it was a bit, I think it, you know eleven might be perhaps too young, I think twelve is a reasonable •169895_171788•
*HEL:	Mm •171806_171809•
*SHE:	age. •171814_171856•

*SHE:	How many was thinking of going on? •237890_238059•
*HEL:	Ninety five per cent  •238059_238116•

*HEL:	and er, like she said aren't you Vicky and she goes no miss, mm, you can't be a nurse till your eighteen •240913_241780•
*SHE:	No, no you can't go into student, student •241780_242001•
*HEL:	so like, you know, she's gonna stay on, do A levels and then go into it •242001_243085•
*SHE:	Mm •243085_243105•
*HEL:	because she might as well have some A levels just in case or whatever, but erm  you know I, you know she's, you know, I can understand that actually, she's being quiet sensible about it she said there's nothing else I want to do and I might as well do something that I enjoy, you know, you've only got one life haven't you when it comes down to it? •243105_245265•
*SHE:	Well if that's what she wants to do, that's what she wants to do, innit? •245265_245574•
*HEL:	Mm, like, her dad says to her why don't you be a doctor  and she, but she don't want to, you know, she wants to be in a hospital and that, she don't want to end up in general practice •245574_246886•
*SHE:	Well she doesn't necessarily end up in general practice does she? •246886_247291•
*HEL:	No, but  •247291_247347•
*SHE:	But I mean for the first year she won't be in, if she goes into student, she'll be in college •247368_248494•
*HEL:	I know, but it won't take as long for her to get there as it would if she becomes a doctor •248495_249393•
*SHE:	Oh no, three years ain't it a student? •249403_249925•
*HEL:	Mm •249926_249927•
*SHE:	But then you get on hand experience right  hands on I should say, not on hand  •249932_251219•
*HEL:	but erm •251219_251260•
*SHE:	learning how to clean pot , er bed pans and make beds and things like that •251260_252159•
*HEL:	Clear up sick, that's a favourite job isn't it? •252205_252773•
*SHE:	Mm  •252773_252803•
*HEL:	Yeah, I thought of being that once but  I wouldn't mind it in the wards, but I wouldn't want to be in the operating theatre, I don't know why, the blood don't put me off or anything, but •252803_255233•
*SHE:	You do have to go into the theatre for so long I think •255233_255661•
*HEL:	Mm •255694_255701•
*SHE:	but then you can, you can specialize you see, I mean some nurses go into the theatre all the time once they've qualified •255716_256403•
*HEL:	Yeah •256403_256419•
*SHE:	I think they do have to go in, you have to go into each area •256423_256803•
*HEL:	But like, I mean I don't mind the blood or whatever, and if they were doing little things, I could handle it, but like, like on that , operation that woman was having the other day and they cut her open and they just pulled •256803_258395•
*SHE:	Well they do •258424_258463•
*HEL:	and that, that, that's the thing that makes me retch, not the cutting, it's when they just pull it apart •258468_259067•
*SHE:	Well I know  •259067_259116•
*HEL:	when it rips ooh, they could of cut it •259116_259409•
*SHE:	Well they do cut it •259409_259635•
*HEL:	No they cut the skin and then they just pulled it apart  •259635_259993•
*SHE:	Yes because it's not the like that underneath, if they didn't pull it apart they, they cut down, if they cut down with a knife they could cut into something couldn't they? •259993_260854•
*HEL:	Oh, er •260854_260928•
*SHE:	It could be dangerous so you, you open up the top and then the other parts  the lining •260929_261631•
*HEL:	Ah •261631_261658•
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	Yeah but what they ripped was all fat, all her fat, ooh •261673_262789•
*SHE:	Yeah, but you see, you've got the, you got all the other things in, down, down, underneath, well I mean if you started going in with a knife and you started cutting them I mean you could cut an artery or anything couldn't you? •262829_264026•
        Which could be a bit nasty, you know   and then she'd say buy a little bag for me, a chick, a chick, a chick, a chickita  •264085_266913•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SHE:	who's turn is it tonight? •266913_267222•
