*KE2PSUN:	And then we got a table tester to help them refresh their memories it 's like a disc and then you got the slots and then it tells you your eight times and that 's good as well but I mean he 's got them off by heart which is brilliant .  110763_121533
*PS0W2:	Well it it saves so much time as well you see because and you get on so much quicker with everything .  121613_126103

*PS0W2:	Well this is really for anybody learning the tables But primarily it 's it 's it 's you know top end of the primary school .  158473_163763
*KE2PSUN:	Oh it sounds good .  163763_164173

*KE2PSUN:	What computer is that then .  168533_169683
*PS0W2:	Oh it 's er it 's erm .  169683_170403

*KE2PSUN:	Oh .  175783_176103

*KE2PSUN:	Ah That 's a good idea .  177743_178293
*PS0W2:	But how old is your .  178883_179583

*PS0W2:	Da ta for it .  201703_202353
*KE2PSUN:	Yes But that 's I think that 's a brilliant idea actually Because where he goes is a smaller school where they go and erm I think something like that is nice for them to actually .  202653_212453
*PS0W2:	Where does he go .  212453_213193
*KE2PSUN:	He goes to a school in the Tene Valley it 's a teacher that he used to go to Exeter school and the teacher 's opened her own school and only for lo a small time and then she 's opening up actually in Exeter but this is an in between and she 's a very good teacher .  213193_224873

*KE2PSUN:	mean you pay for it course you do but then .  233173_234713
*PS0W2:	That 's right .  234713_234973
*KE2PSUN:	on the ar we well you know we 've paid for his education since he was seven because he was n't doing anything at primary school Half the teachers le left them doing nothing .  235003_241743
*PS0W2:	It 's a shame really .  242223_243363
*KE2PSUN:	Yeah Yeah But er you know and it would have been such a waste cos he 's bright But that he was always naughty They used to write back and they said he was always being sent out and I said that 's because he 's bored He could n't be bothered you see And how many more children slip through the net that way .  243363_257623
