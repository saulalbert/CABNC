*** 1 (Tape 058001) ***
None (KBXPS001)            [1] And in terrible conditions, erm, another country
                           is Zaire where there is currently, I mean I'd think
                           there was a military coup or something there in the
                           last few weeks, but these things are colonies which
                           weren't connected to Britain, hoping I'm being, I
                           think it's a French colony, they use a Belgian
                           colony or is an ex Belgian colony, maybe in Belgium
                           and France you would get more news about those two
                           countries, but here we don't, because they, we
                           haven't got that colonial connection that makes us
                           interested perhaps ... erm and, and when we do find
                           out about South Africa because it used to be a
                           colony, we do find out about, I mean Ethiopia I
                           think we found out about because of the disaster
                           that's happening there in several of the countries
                           all around it, used to be British colonies.
                           [2] But there are all sorts of reasons why we don't
                           get that news, one guy said well if we wanted to do
                           it I know if we wanted to make the news that,
                           according to the level of human suffering we'd start
                           off with Ethiopia then we'd have the Kurdish problem
                           and you know just made a living of disaster areas
                           around the world, he said we might of finished up
                           with a light hearted discussion on the poll tax, you
                           know as the, as the light, the lightener at the end
                           of the news if you like, and our, what news we
                           receive here depends on our perception of the world,
                           but mainly it's the other way round our perception
                           of the world is, is what, you know what it, or
                           rather the news that we get actually manufactures
                           our perception of the world.
                           [3] You can find out about world events if you read
                           a good newspaper, somebody said to me yesterday in
                           class well we don't get the news about these places,
                           you do, you just don't get it on the T V, it's there
                           in the Guardian every day, it's there in the
                           Independent every day, quite a lot of it gets
                           reported in the Telegraph, but it's no good if
                           you're reading the Mirror, you won't get it in
                           there, you won't get it in the Mail or any other of
                           those newspapers, the tabloids, but these things are
                           happening, why would we be interested?
                           [4] Why would we be interested in finding out these
                           things?
                           [5] ... Do you read the international section of
                           papers then any of you?
                           [6] Why not?

                           newspapers?
                           [12] ... What do you read?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [13] mm, mm and do you ever read the international
                           section?
                           [14] Yes, you find that you pick certain countries
                           that you're interested in?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [15] okay ... what do you
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]

                           international section?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [18] Yeah
None (KBXPS001)            [19] Yeah
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [20] no, no, that's right, don't you pick on
                           particular issues or particular countries that
                           you're interested in?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [21] Sometimes I do, yeah, especially
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [22] yeah, yeah

Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [24] yeah
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [25] and things like that ...
None (KBXPS001)            [26] Why do you think that most of the people in
                           this room don't read newspapers?
                           [27] Do you do general studies?
                           [28] Who does general studies?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [29] you should be reading newspapers
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [30] mm, okay, you know that you can get the
                           Guardian cheap don't you?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [31] mm, mm
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [32] okay, you also know about the editorial control
                           of newspapers do you?
                           [33] Were there any left newspapers in this country?
                           [34] Is there anything other than the Tory Party
                           line?
                           [35] ... Don't know
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [36] Yes I do
None (KBXPS001)            [37] Pardon?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [38] I think it's, well the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [39] yeah
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [40] well it's Today the Mail and the Guardian are
                           the only ones that put anything other than the Party
                           line
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [41] Mm
None (KBXPS001)            [42] well, the Party being the Tory party, no matter
                           which party's in power ... because they're all owned
                           by Tories basically, erm ... I hope nobody reads the
                           Sun, but I
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [43] I'm not gonna ask who reads the Sun, if you do
                           I hope you're critical of it, especially page three
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [laugh]
None (KBXPS001)            [44] erm, okay, but this information is there for
                           you to find out about, the reason why I would say
                           it's important to find out about those things, well
                           one, you tell me
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [45] why do you need that?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [46] okay, anybody got any other reasons why they
                           think that maybe we ought to know what's going on in
                           other countries, why, why would we be interested in
                           the roots in Kenya, India, why would we be
                           interested in those countries?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [47] which do what for us?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [48] yeah
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [49] yeah
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [50] okay, can anybody think of anything that you
                           eat, that comes from somewhere else?
                           [51] To eat or drink, got coffee, tea
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [52] Maize
None (KBXPS001)            [53] Maize
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [54] Vegetables
None (KBXPS001)            [55] Vegetables, oranges, you get oranges from
                           Israel and Spain, you get pasta from Italy you get
                           lentils from Ethiopia, did you know that?
                           [56] Lentils coming from Ethiopia, you get wheat
                           from the States, rice from the States,ap apples from
                           France, tea from India, coffee from Brazil and
                           Columbia, sugar from the Windward Islands, bananas
                           from all over the place, you know ... those are the
                           things that keep us alive, no, you know, whether we
                           one think they are or not, but I mean them things
                           are what keeps the economy alive for one, it's also
                           what keeps us personally alive ... if you don't know
                           why we take an interest in Third World issues, I
                           would say that it's that, we're dependent on these
                           countries, we could produce enough foods for our own
                           needs, but we wouldn't have oranges, coffee, tea,
                           sugar, you know cos we can't grow them in this
                           country ... we, we really depend on those things to
                           stay alive, and for that reason alone we should have
                           some kind of interest, if you went to Kenya for
                           example they would be staggered at how little you
                           know about their country given how much they know
                           about yours ... they know a lot about this country,
                           a lot of it is a bit loopy, but then what you know
                           about their country is probably a bit off centre as
                           well, and you know I hope that this is something
                           that we're reversing in this section, our
                           perceptions of the Third World or the south or
                           whatever we choose to call it, colour a lot of the
                           things that we think and do and say and it increases
                           the amount of racism that there is around us all,
                           all those kind of things, erm and I think that it is
                           really important to look at what a perception is,
                           you know, for example what's your perception of
                           this?
                           [57] ... What is it?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [58] Just a piece of paper with writing
None (KBXPS001)            [59] Just a piece of paper with some writing on it,
                           just one piece of paper?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [60] A few
None (KBXPS001)            [61] A few bits of paper with some writing on it,
                           what colour is it?
                           [62] John
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [63] well okay, my perception of this is a yellow
                           piece of paper with a map on it
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [64] exactly, yeah and we can do that with
                           everything, we can do that with everything, this is
                           my perception and that's your perception of this
                           thing that I'm holding in my hand, everything that
                           we've seen ... have that ability ... you know, we've
                           got the ability to do that with everything, what we
                           need to do sometimes is walk around the issue if you
                           like and look at it from another perspective and,
                           and this is what we're doing with Ethiopia, now,
                           erm, the good section again was looking at images
                           and particularly the fact that a lot of images are
                           very negative and throwing an alternative view, the
                           second section we're looking at news coverage which
                           is very sketchy, erm, it doesn't provide a complete
                           picture at all, and this third section well you saw
                           what that's about there
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS001)            [65] now, can you make sure you are somewhere where
                           you can see this please.
*** 2 (Tape 058501) ***
Donald (PS1DW)             [66] I'll tell you the reason why I like to record
                           what we say, somebody came to our house Thursday,
                           did I mention it to you on the phone?
Anna (PS1DX)               [67] Yeah yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [68] And er they're doing some market research, this
                           is what it's about, the national treasury of spoken
                           English, a group of reading dictionary publishers
                           and universities are participating in a government
                           funded research project to compile a national
                           treasury of the English language.
                           [69] For the first time dictionary writers and
                           language researchers will be able to show how words
                           are used in ordinary every day conversation.
                           [70] The British Market Research Bureau, an
                           independent market research agency, are asking a
                           large cross section of people around the country to
                           help with this task of, by recording their
                           conversations.
                           [71] These will then be transcribed and computered
                           and built into a database which will contain several
                           million words.
                           [72] The case and conversation details will all be
                           completely anonymous, so no one will know who has
                           used the words or whose voice it is on the tape, but
                           together they will provide a permanent record of how
                           the English language was spoken in the nineteen
                           nineties.
                           [73] So we can talk about what we want and you know
                           what we're interested in, in the most

                           language and accordingly Jehovah scattered them from
                           there over all the surface of the earth [] so, and
                           that was God's purpose for them to be er spread out
                           all over the earth cos God knew that city life would
                           only break down and all these centuries have passed
                           since then and there's urgent proof throughout the
                           year, the cities, the cities don't work so God had
                           his own way, give it, the one, his way is the only
                           one that works and thus when we pray for this king

Mary (PS1DY)               [233] Mm
Anna (PS1DX)               [234] Very, very confusing this is, the world is
                           going upside down and he don't know what's going to
                           happen next you see, for instance looking a year
                           ago, two years ago the wall, the Berlin Wall was
                           standing and the Russian empire was feared, all over
                           the world, and now this day, it just fell on its
                           face
Donald (PS1DW)             [235] That's just two years ago
Anna (PS1DX)               [236] Yeah
Mary (PS1DY)               [237] Yeah
Anna (PS1DX)               [238] it just fell on its face and it's such a shame
                           that the land like that er, er rich in everything,
                           neglected themselves to that state that they're
                           begging for food
Donald (PS1DW)             [239] Yes
Anna (PS1DX)               [240] it's, it's unbelievable, unbelievable
Donald (PS1DW)             [241] Yes
Anna (PS1DX)               [242] but yet when you look in Book of Daniel which,
                           where tau he talks about er the north king and the
                           south king
Donald (PS1DW)             [243] Yes it does
Anna (PS1DX)               [244] there, there, there be fighting and shoving
                           and pushing for the power and then it says there
                           that it will look as though the, the north king will
                           take all over, all over the what, what spread all
                           over the earth and then it says gradually he will go
                           right back to his ho go home, gradually will be
                           stepping back, right back to his home and there's
                           going to be no helper for him
Donald (PS1DW)             [245] Yes
Anna (PS1DX)               [246] look what happened the communist just fell,
                           fell on his face without a one shot
Donald (PS1DW)             [247] It's amazing that is Anna isn't it?
                           [248] It really is amazing, that was, what you said,
                           how long ago was it those?
Anna (PS1DX)               [249] Two years and
Donald (PS1DW)             [250] No
Mary (PS1DY)               [251] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [252] with
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Mary (PS1DY)               [253] the, the, Daniel was living, you know, you
                           know better than I do how many years, how many
                           centuries Daniel was living before Jesus' birth
                           then?
Donald (PS1DW)             [254] He were, it was way before Jesus wasn't he?
Anna (PS1DX)               [255] Mm
Mary (PS1DY)               [256] That's it
Donald (PS1DW)             [257] Way before Jesus then
Mary (PS1DY)               [258] So it was , the prophecy was written then by
                           Daniel for our, for our time and it just happened in
                           our, because you know er, when he was er, when he
                           finished the book write written and he said I have
                           seen the, the, the erm visions and I've heard the
                           voice, but I, and I've written down what I was told
                           to do, but I do not understand and then the voice
                           said to him well close that down, that book is not
                           for you to understand, the generations that it's
                           written for, it's written for the end of the times,
                           they will come to understand it, and you see we
                           actually witnessing what's happening
Anna (PS1DX)               [259] Yeah
Mary (PS1DY)               [260] the, what Daniel wrote there it's happening in
                           our time
Donald (PS1DW)             [261] [cough] Yes, but when you, when you say it's
                           the end of time it's, you get some people saying yes
                           it's always the end, for some country it's always er
                           collapses or what me have you, it's always then for
                           some government or country
Mary (PS1DY)               [262] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [263] but now this is the end for worldwide isn't
                           it?
Mary (PS1DY)               [264] Yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [265] Like, the old
Mary (PS1DY)               [266] listen this is the end for the er political
                           system, you see the half of it is collapsed already
                           the, the north king so you see what's happening in
                           the, in the, er ... south king [laugh]
Donald (PS1DW)             [267] Oh yes
Mary (PS1DY)               [268] hmm
Donald (PS1DW)             [269] I mean erm, was it nineteen eighty seven?
                           [270] When the stockmarket flopped
Mary (PS1DY)               [271] Yeah
Anna (PS1DX)               [272] Yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [273] and I did hear, somebody told me like that the
                           reason erm house prices shot up, you went three
                           times as a a as high in value in what a matter of
                           moments
Mary (PS1DY)               [274] Yes
Donald (PS1DW)             [275] and somebody said it was because since the
                           stockmarket flopped people drew out and put the
                           money in building societies, building societies were
                           bursting at the seams, didn't want to, and banks as
                           well, didn't know what to do with all this money,
                           so, somebody went in for a loan and asked for fifty
                           thousand and come out with a hundred thousand, they
                           couldn't get it out, give it to people, a lot, a lot
                           of people that really er ... weren't safe gambles
Mary (PS1DY)               [276] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [277] and now the er, they're not paying back, and
                           the houses have come down and so what people are
                           doing, or some people that have bought these houses,
                           they're just giving the keys back and repossessing
                           the house
Mary (PS1DY)               [278] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [279] cos if they decide to sell it now they
                           couldn't
Mary (PS1DY)               [280] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [281] and that was that the, it's probably thirty
                           thousand less in price
Mary (PS1DY)               [282] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [283] and he probably hadn't paid that much anyway
                           so he has to go out the house
Mary (PS1DY)               [284] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [285] probably hadn't paid that much, so these peo
                           the ones that lent the money out, in really they er,
                           and they really have suffered just, they probably
                           thought that if we don't lend them the money
                           somebody else will and get the interest and they'll
                           grow bigger and much overtake us, you know, to, to
                           take over our business, so er, so the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [286] agreed that they've lent this money out, but
                           it's bounced back you see, it's bouncing back on
                           them, and this, everything's bouncing back on
                           everybody now, but it seems
Mary (PS1DY)               [287] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [288] to be that way doesn't it?
                           [289] Everything seems to be failing.
                           [290] Erm, I remember years ago, well, well, say
                           months ago, erm, one of the local estate agents were
                           writing in one of the property news I think it was
                           or the Advertiser, saying now is the time to buy,
                           erm, whereas twelve months ago, now's the time to
                           buy because they
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [291] gonna start going up again, well since they've
                           had that, that wrote in the paper, they've come down
                           even more
Mary (PS1DY)               [292] Oh
Donald (PS1DW)             [293] so these local experts, you can't believe what
                           they say ... the only way really is to, the
                           scriptures don't they say give us an accurate er
                           description of what's
Mary (PS1DY)               [294] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [295] happening in our time ... but, but and you
                           think of what it says in Two Timothy with the
Mary (PS1DY)               [296] Mm, mm ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [297] that's typical of our days isn't it?
Mary (PS1DY)               [298] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [299] Too typical, typical of us now.
Mary (PS1DY)               [300] Love is of money, love is of pleasure and love
                           is of everything about God [laughing] in command,
                           yeah []

                           attitude

                           doors and you were inside the house and you couldn't
                           get out
Donald (PS1DW)             [353] Yes
Mary (PS1DY)               [354] unless somebody comes and gets you out and
                           there's, there's nothing like it now
Anna (PS1DX)               [355] They have insist operation now
Donald (PS1DW)             [356] It's exciting though when you get deep snow

                           go through and not stay there
Donald (PS1DW)             [362] You'd freeze to death wouldn't you?
Mary (PS1DY)               [363] [laugh] Oh no you don't freeze when you're in
                           the snow, you don't freeze because it's colder in
                           the snow than it is, er it's, warmer in inside the

Mary (PS1DY)               [514] Mm
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Mary (PS1DY)               [515] I know when we've er sold the house, when our
                           children all went and left us, the house was for
                           three bedrooms, right, and I, I said to my husband I
                           don't want to stay here because they built the
                           school outside behind our er, erm back yard, and
                           every, all the rubbish that kids throw threw over
                           and I said to him I don't want to stay now kids,
                           kids gone, children gone leave, left home, got
                           married and went to off, I said I don't want to live
                           here, I don't want to retire to, to stay at home and
                           listen to the kids at school all day long and have
                           the rubbish thrown over the hedge
Donald (PS1DW)             [cough]
Mary (PS1DY)               [516] so we started to look for something and I
                           wanted a bungalow, I didn't want to house again,
                           just the two bedrooms I thought would be nice, so
                           what we did we found this bu er this bungalow in er
                           out of Crewe in Haslington and er we put up our
                           house for sale, it cost seventeen thousand, five
                           hundred and this bungalow we bought seventeen
                           thousand, six hundred and fifty, so all I had to add
                           was one hundred and sixty pounds, to sell the house,
                           but the house needed change all the windows to put
                           all the windows and the doors because they were all
                           rotting in, you know, because the houses built er
                           before the second world war ... and er what we did
                           we put up the and in three months' time, it in three
                           months' time my house went and we were moved, in
                           September we started to sell, in January we'd been
                           living in the, in the new bungalow and then about
                           three years later they built a row of bungalows on
                           the other side where there should, should of been,
                           they kept the land, it should of been shops, but
                           then they changed their minds, they did, they didn't
                           build the shops, but they built all these bungalows
                           again on the other side, you've been to my home,
                           yeah, so the road that, over the road these
                           bungalows were about three years later than ours and
                           they were going down for thirty two thousand pound,
                           and I bought mine for [laughing] seventeen thousand
                           [] seven sixty at six fifty, yeah

Mary (PS1DY)               [540] She's not, she's not old
Donald (PS1DW)             [541] If if thought
Mary (PS1DY)               [542] she, she was baptised at the same time as I
                           was, you know, er, the same day, Manchester
                           assembly, that was nineteen seventy four ... seventy

Donald (PS1DW)             [544] You're not, you, I, what I was gonna say is,
                           are you interested in a caravan at Rudyard?
                           [545] Bought it, I don't know one for sale now, you
                           know, but for the price they are and for the rent
                           it's very reasonable.
                           [546] The one I'm in, I get paid four hundred pound
                           for it
Mary (PS1DY)               [547] Yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [548] and the rent, when I, I'm going back six years
                           now, the rent to leave it there for twelve months
                           was only seventy pound a year
Mary (PS1DY)               [549] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [550] so that was an extraordinary low price, it's
                           gone up now, two hundred and fifty four
Mary (PS1DY)               [551] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [552] but that's only three pound a week and it's

Barry (PS1E0)              [668] simply because we want you to stay awake,
                           physically and this will help you spiritually.
                           [669] But staying awake sometimes is very, very
                           difficult to do isn't it?
                           [670] You'd recognize this if you are a driver and
                           especially a driver who maybe has the opportunity of
                           travelling long distance, now years ago when I was
                           younger and perhaps some of you in the audience when
                           you were younger, you could go from here to the
                           South of England with no trouble, without a break
                           and you'd head on down the motorway and you, you'd
                           be alert and alive and er ready to meet up with all
                           sorts of emergencies and you'd drive quite well all
                           the way down, non stop down the South of England,
                           but if you're like me now, when I get to Stafford on
                           the motorway [laugh] you're beginning to feel as if
                           you've had enough and it's difficult to try and keep
                           your concentration as you used to years ago, and
                           that's how it can be in the truth sometimes, when
                           we've been with it a long time ... that, we grow
                           older ... not only physically, but spiritually too
                           we become very experienced in the truth and we
                           become very sort of fat spiritually, we can live off
                           of that fat can't we?
                           [671] And er we can get by on lots of things and
                           when an emergency does come, sometimes we can cope
                           with it if it's not too big a one, but other times
                           it can catch up with us, simply because we are only
                           sort of half awake ... so the purpose of the talk
                           today is to try and help us all to see various ways
                           in which we can stay awake in the truth physic er,
                           er spiritually speaking.
                           [672] We say don't we that, that the new ones that
                           come along and then they really say to the truth,
                           they're alive aren't they?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [673] They are spiritually awake and they sometimes
                           put us to shame because they seem to make strides so
                           fast that we have a job to keep up with them, they
                           want to do this, they want to do that, they get
                           baptized they want to auxiliary pioneer and before
                           you know where the, where you are they're in the
                           regular pioneer ranks, and that's lovely to see
                           isn't it?
                           [674] But as we said earlier that some of us who
                           have been in the truth for a long time we were like
                           that years ago, but somewhere along the line we've
                           become drowsy and a little sort of halfhearted and
                           maybe dozing a little bit as we go down that sort of
                           motorway er of spirituality and that, that the
                           longer you go it can become more difficult because
                           other things come along don't they?
                           [675] Like physical ailments and er our, our, our
                           physical body doesn't work like it used to, and as
                           you do get older there is a tendency to more to, to
                           need more rest, we can't do what the young ones er
                           do, and we would love to do that and that goes along
                           with what the council and the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [676] doesn't it?
                           [677] It, do it now while you're young, while you've
                           got your strength, because there will come days when
                           you look around and you think well I just wish I
                           could do that again, and that's the way we're made,
                           and that's the way it will always be in this system
                           of things, but there's lots of little things that
                           we, you and I, can work on to help us to stay
                           spiritually alert, vigilant and awake.
                           [678] Now in the scriptures, we're gonna have a look
                           at a few because the scriptures counsel us time and
                           again, er that we are living in difficult times, we
                           know that and it can become difficult to stay
                           spiritually alert and awake and that's why
                           constantly throughout the scriptures you'll find
                           that we're er counselled and encouraged to stay
                           awake, stay awake and as we sang stand firm and, and
                           grow mighty spirits, the first one is in Romans
                           chapter thirteen.
                           [679] ... Most of the scriptures we'll be looking at
                           today is very familiar with us ... we know them and
                           some of them we may be able to recite without even
                           looking at the words, but er, if we can try and get
                           you to think a little bit about them, then we've
                           achieved something, if we can get you to think that,
                           you know, well am I dozing or am I really awake as I
                           should be, then we'll achieve more, in verse eleven
                           it speaks there about er, you people knowing the
                           season, well what people are we talking about?
                           [680] Us isn't it?
                           [681] It's within the congregation, Paulo was
                           writing, not to those outside but to those dedicated
                           baptized brothers and sisters in the trees, said
                           [reading] you know the season that it is already the
                           hour for you to awake [] so he was speaking to
                           spiritual people, spiritually minded people and yet
                           here he is telling them to be awake, awake from
                           sleep or slumbers, for now our salvation is nearer
                           than at the time when we became the leavers, and
                           that's true with us all if you came into the truth
                           yesterday, the time that much nearer now isn't it?
                           [682] Because you can never go back to yesterday, if
                           you came in last year or five years ago, ten years
                           ago or longer, some of you have been in the truth
                           for many, many years ... and it is nearer now than
                           it ever was when you first came along and joined
                           Jehovah's people and as it says [reading] the night
                           is well along [] and if any of us have ever worked
                           on the night shift, I think we're all well aware
                           aren't we that when the night is well along and
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [683] you're coming near to the end of your shift
                           ... you're not waking up because it's getting near
                           morning whereas everybody else is, you're finding it
                           much more difficult to carry on because you've gone
                           through the whole night working, the night is well
                           along and it becomes increasingly more difficult to
                           stay awake so physically, spiritually, whatever way
                           you look at it, it is certainly very difficult to
                           stay awake in the truth today, but it isn't that
                           difficult and it isn't er a hurdle that none of us
                           can overcome, Jehovah says that his load is light,
                           Jesus echoed that didn't he and it is true that if
                           we do Jehovah's ... will, Jehovah's way, then it
                           will be made light for us, he will help us to stay
                           awake, but he's not going to allow us to slumber and
                           drift off into obscurity, but it all comes back in
                           hinges upon us and that's why the counsel is in
                           verse thirteen [reading] as a day, as in a day time
                           look, let us walk decently [] so we have to do
                           something don't we?
                           [684] Walking means exercise, walking means effort,
                           you and I have to do something to keep ourselves
                           spiritually awake, going back to our illustration
                           again about the car driver on the motorway, you find
                           yourself after so many miles just dozing off because
                           the road is so straight, not much traffic around,
                           not much to think about apart from the countryside
                           that goes by and you're there foot on the
                           accelerator, no braking, no gear changing, nothing
                           at all and you get to the point where you're driving
                           one-handed by the thing, that's the time when you
                           get so relaxed isn't it?
                           [685] That you can easily lose your concentration
                           and go off to sleep ... and so it is in the truth,
                           so we need to stay awake, stand firm for almighty,
                           be vigilant and again in the scriptures we could
                           look up half a dozen scriptures in the Christian
                           Greek scriptures to show that we need to keep
                           spiritually awake and it uses different terminology
                           ... you've heard me use some already, remember the
                           one in verse Peter four, verse seven?
                           [686] It tells us there to be vigilant, vigilant
                           with a view to prayers, isn't that staying awake?
                           [687] Anyone who's vigilant knows what's going on
                           and they're aware of what's happening, so again it,
                           it shows that we must do something as they said on
                           that motorway, the thing to do when you feel
                           yourself going into drow drowsiness is, is stop the
                           car perhaps, get out and have a walk round, do
                           something, I know I, er in the past when I've felt
                           myself going off to sleep in those situations, I've
                           been pinching myself and, and really making yourself
                           do something rather than just sitting there doing
                           nothing, cos that's the way we just go off and get
                           lowered into sleep and our lives are involved in
                           this, we've read and heard about people that have
                           gone to sleep on motorways haven't they?
                           [688] Where have they finished up?
                           [689] Crashing the car, taking someone else's life
                           with them, terrible situations, terrible tragedies
                           can come about because a person physically goes to
                           sleep ... so it can be in a spiritual sense that we
                           can nod off to sleep and not only our lives are
                           involved, but our fellow brothers' and sisters' too,
Donald (PS1DW)             [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [690] especially if we have a, a responsible
                           position within the congregation, because if we nod
                           off, those of us who are elders, than others lives
                           can be ... terrifically involved can't they?
                           [691] Because we are not doing what we should be
                           doing, we'll hear a little bit more about that
                           later, another one in Matthew twenty six and verse
                           forty one, keep on the watch and pray continually,
                           notice our New Year's text is all about prayer isn't

                           [692] Rejoice in the hope I had, that's lovely isn't
                           it?
                           [693] Thinking about the, the, the hope ahead but
                           what have we got to do?
                           [694] We've got to persevere in prayer, which means
                           effort doesn't it?
                           [695] So in everything that we do and staying
                           spiritually awake, we have to do something, it all
                           comes back to you and I at the end of the day, no
                           one else can do it for us ... we sometimes think
                           well, well, so and so can help, I mean this is true
                           to a degree, but at the end of the day it all comes
                           back to us doesn't it?
                           [696] We're the ones that have said to Jehovah I am
                           dedicating my life to you, I am going to do this, do
                           that and the other and it's up to us as to whether
                           we do it, so it requires effort, first [...] , five,
                           six, also says [reading] let us stay awake, keep our
                           senses [] first Peter, five, eight [reading] keep
                           your senses, be watchful [] and then first
                           Corinthians, ten, twelve which I think the song was
                           based on [reading] let him think that he is
                           standing, beware, beware, beware that he does not
                           fall [] , if you think things are going along nicely
                           and you're in a comfortable little corner, a little
                           niche in the truth, and it's just how you like it,
                           and it's just the way you want it to be and there's
                           the time we need to be aware because there's an
                           opening for Satan to get into to make us fall.
                           [697] Now going back into the Hebrew scriptures,
                           you'll find there that this sort of staying awake
                           counsel, an idea was there long before the days of
                           Jesus and the Apostles and people's lives were
                           involved in its state, even in those days, let's
                           just let us have a look at one, Isaiah forty two ...
                           eighteen to twenty ... now this terms it slightly
                           different, but when you look at it and analyze it,
                           you realize he's talking about exactly the same
                           thing, it's regarding the nation of Israel who
                           turned away from Jehovah, they weren't doing what
                           they should be doing, or should've been doing as
                           he's pleading with them look there, that look here,
                           here you deaf ones, well we know the nation of
                           Israel weren't all physically deaf, they were like
                           we are, perhaps had a few deaf individuals amongst
                           them, but
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [698] generally speaking the nation had good ears,
                           they knew what was what and they listened quite
                           well, hear you deaf ones he's describing them and
                           look forth to see you blind once ... verse twenty it
                           was a case of seeing many things, but you did not
                           cheat watching and Daniel, verse twenty five, look
                           it says there a little phrase near, half way through
                           that he took no note, the nation took no note of
                           what was happening at that time, but we know what
                           happened to them, many of them, thousands, a million
                           of them lost their lives didn't they?
                           [699] Because they were overthrown and the others
                           were taken off into captivity into battle life, and
                           what a life they had, the one of slavery, so at that
                           time because they took no note, because they were
                           destiny instructions to Jehovah for his word and
                           again want to see, they had eyes, but they just
                           didn't want to see it ... they knew, all the whys
                           and wherefores and what the responsibilities were,
                           but they didn't measure up to them and because of
                           that many of them lost their lives, and if they
                           didn't they were taken into captivity, Jeremiah
                           four, in verse twenty two, again another prophecy
                           sent to them exactly over the same message, the same
                           reasons ... describes to them as being a, er people
                           that is foolish and of me they have taken no notice
                           Jeremiah four and verse twenty two.
                           [700] In Noah's day, if you go back to Noah's day it
                           was exactly the same now, isn't that what Jesus said
                           justice in the days of Noah, so it will be in there
                           somewhere, they were eating and drinking and
                           marrying and doing all the things that you, you
                           know, you and I do today isn't it?
                           [701] And what is it, they took no note and the
                           flood came and swept them all away.
                           [702] So it's been no different dying through time,
                           the counsel has been there because Jehovah knows
                           that we're all of falling flesh aren't we?
                           [703] We're all prone to do that, were all prone to
                           take the line of least resistance and you find this
                           not just in the truth but in any sort of community
                           in life, in any area of life that wish to go, you,
                           you may find this at work or at school, you
                           youngsters, there's always a little Johnny at the
                           back isn't it, that, that will fit in the back row
                           and think if I'm back here teacher won't notice you
                           see, were act were actually tuck himself up in the
                           corner and er think well if I'm, if I'm up here
                           nobody will notice me and see the day goes by and er
                           we don't have so much to do, those are the type of
                           people that in, in, in a physical life er sort of
                           going to sleep aren't they, they don't want to
                           accept responsibility and we, we find even in the
                           truth, you'll always find it in congregations like
                           we have here in our congregation, we're not
                           different, we're all the same aren't we, we're all
                           flesh and we're all imperfect and we're all prone to
                           doing or wanting to do the things that are different
                           or [laugh] you know than, than what Jehovah wants us
                           to do and we all want to tuck ourselves up a little
                           corner sometimes and yet we shouldn't be like that
                           and this is what the scriptures tell us and warn us
                           about to put ourselves headlong into the truth, be
                           whole sole, be awake, be alert, be vigilant to the
                           things that are going on and there's a lot going on
                           in the truth at this particular time, things are
                           changing, the scriptures tell us that the scene of
                           the world is changing and that's true isn't it?
                           [704] It changes so fast and here's we have a job to
                           keep up with it.
                           [705] Did you know Jehovah's organizations always
                           changes, not with it, but to combat it ... that way
                           it comes to work, it keeps us alive, it keeps us on
                           our toes, and so we could go on and on in saying
                           well look keep away, stay awake and do everything
                           that we should and, and we can stand here for the
                           rest of the talk saying well do it, do it, do it
                           [laugh] but that's easy for me to do that isn't it?
                           [706] To tell you what to do ... but it's also
                           knowing how to do it, because sometimes especially
                           if we knew in the truth, we don't always know what
                           to do and if we're very young you see, we're, it's,
                           it's one
Donald (PS1DW)             [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [707] thing being told isn't it?
                           [708] But another thing to be shown how to do it and
                           that's what, really what we want to try and do for
                           the rest of the talk is to not just keep preaching
                           at you and telling you what to do, but to show you
                           how, so that's the purpose of the talk from now on,
                           now in this outline there are, I've got about
                           fourteen different points here and it'll highlight
                           ways in which we can er stay awake, what I'm going
                           to do is to read straight through them and then
                           we'll go back and pick a couple out, because it's
                           impossible to concentrate on the entire er amount,
                           so we'll do that, it's er a number of things we can
                           do to keep virtually awake [reading] keep up with
                           the food at the proper time from Jehovah's
                           organizations [] that's studying and things like
                           that isn't it?
                           [709] They come up to meetings which erm, this goes
                           on to say [reading] determine not to miss a single
                           spiritual meal [] both private study, meeting
                           attendance are urgent for all, there's nothing new
                           here brothers it's all things that we've heard
                           before and this is why sometimes we can sort of nod
                           off because we, we sort of think well I've heard all
                           this before, [reading] follow theocratic ways,
                           procedures and policies [] not always easy to do,
                           but it can be done, [reading] recognizing the
                           organization that Jehovah is using ... keep awake by
                           finding your place in God's arrangement [] that
                           isn't that little corner up there, by the way, we're
                           not talking about that one, but finding our place
                           where we can work for Jehovah wholeheartedly ...
                           [reading] do not quibble about assignments and
                           arrangements [] I think we're all guilty of that at
                           some time aren't we?
                           [710] [reading] Perform well whatever assignments
                           you have, trust God's angels to remove and replace
                           where necessary [] when things aren't being done in
                           a congregation as you think that they might be or
                           should be done, or you might think well the, why
                           don't the elders do something about this, we'll
                           leave it, leave it to Jehovah and the angels, if
                           there's anything wrong, they'll sort it out and
                           they'll make the elves sort it out as well, they
                           have ways and means, again coming back to this new
                           text here [reading] persistence in prayer shows you
                           are awake the spirituals [] so there's another way
                           Jesus was outstanding in its constantly regarding
                           prayers [reading] keep awake by field ministry []
                           and here's a rare one in any public talk [reading]
                           financial contributions [] financial, we don't hear
                           that very often in public talks, we, we always say
                           that there's, er people come to the meetings,
                           there's no collection, no mention of money, the
                           seats are free, you're
Donald (PS1DW)             [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [711] free to come and go and er there is a
                           contribution that's held at the back, but here in,
                           in the talk it's highlighting their various ways,
                           this is one of them that we can keep spiritually
                           awake is by being aware of the need for financial
                           contributions, Jehovah has done much for us through
                           his organization and we can show love for him by
                           full support with our time and finances and then
                           another one look [reading] stay awake by showing
                           love to you and act loyal [] sometimes it's easier
                           to show love to some in the congregation than
                           others, we naturally have an affinity for one
                           another and certain types of personalities seemed to
                           gel with others don't they?
                           [712] And it's easier to get along with brother so
                           and so and sister so and so, but for goodness me I
                           find, I find it ever so difficult to talk to sister
                           so and so and there's an area perhaps that we can er
                           think about, [reading] stay awake by being
                           respectful and obedient [] and that's something that
                           is very important because it's completely opposite
                           in the world today, respect for all authority and
                           obedience to it is absolutely gone by the ways I
                           find [reading] refrain from criticism and careless
                           talk [] ... so there are the main points, but as we
                           say we can't go into them all, well, so what we're
                           going to do is to try and just highlight one or two
                           little areas which we could er enlarge on or put the
                           magnifying glass on, so shall we do that?
                           [713] We mentioned about determining not to miss a
                           single spiritual meal, Matthew chapter five and
                           verse three well known to us all I think ... it's in

                           those conscious of the spiritual needs since the

                           encouraged to do that aren't we?
                           [716] What does it mean to be conscious of our
                           spiritual need?
                           [717] Well if you have the footnote bible like I've
                           got here, you look down the bottom and speaks about
                           those who are beggars, beggars for the spirit and
                           just at the bottom of our road where we live er
                           there's a little area there which quite busy and er
                           there's a man who parades up and down there daily,
                           he's there nonstop every day of the week, you can go
                           by there any time, any day and he's there begging
                           and he has no shame at all, and if you refuse him
                           once he'll catch you another day and he'll ask you
                           again, and you'll see him there backwards and
                           forwards and he'll even ... when the traffic lights

                           of the cars and if they've got their window open and
                           just er say can you give me, have you got ten P for
                           me?
                           [719] I, I need it to help me to get to Hanley or
                           something like that and, and he does this all the
                           time, and I look at him and I think well you know
                           fancy being like that, surely we're in a welfare
                           state, there's no need for that, I don't know what
                           his circumstances are, he may be homeless, I don't
                           know where he comes from and he just appears there
                           and he carries on as if he loves the job, and that's
                           only in this country, but if you go abroad, many of
                           you have been abroad haven't you?
                           [720] And they go even further than that don't they?
                           [721] People do all sorts to their bodies don't
                           they?
                           [722] To, to make people feel sorry for them and
                           they have no shame at all in breaking limbs and
                           distorting their features and all so that kind to
                           make themselves look as pitiful as they possible can
                           because they're going to live a life of a beggar and
                           they tell us it's very profitable being a beggar in
                           some lands, people can make in this country they
                           reckon up to in places like London a hundred pounds
                           a day being a beggar [laugh] that's more than you
                           earn a day isn't it?
                           [723] Most of you ... simply because they have no
                           shame, now bringing it round to a spiritual thing,
                           how can we show that we, where it describes there
                           beggars for the spirit, it really means having no
                           shame whatsoever in the truth, never hold back in
                           demanding really, what your requirements are in the
                           way of spiritual things and a good mirror to this is
                           analyze yourself and ask yourself what am I like, am
                           I really a beggar in spirit, what am I like when the

                           says that we have new magazines tonight brothers and
                           he may hold them up and said you know, that they're
                           this and that and lovely, beautiful magazines
                           Jehovah doing so well now through his organization
                           and he's presenting us with, with erm marvellous erm
                           appealing literature, he holds them up and says
                           we're, we're, we're able to get your magazines
                           tonight and er we would like you to get them
                           straight out at me, and they're still there two or
                           three weeks later, your magazines, this is a way we
                           can stay spiritually awake, is by going and getting
                           them straight away, not for the benefit of the
                           brothers, poor old brother who is on the job and
                           he's wondering why, are they gonna come and fetch my
                           magazines or not, but because we need to devour that
                           spiritual feeling, we need to keep up to date with
                           everything that Jehovah's providing us with.
                           [726] Really if we, if we're not on top of these
                           things, then what we're saying is that Jehovah is
                           like saying to a high squad who lays out a beautiful
                           meal for us and saying well there you are, it's
                           yours for the taking and you saying well I don't
                           feel like that today ... I'll just have some chips
                           down the road.
                           [727] ... These are little signs and areas that show
                           up as to whether or not we're really conscious of
                           our spiritual need, alright you go and get them, you
                           say alright I'll go and get them, as soon as they
                           come on there, the first one there, but what do you

Barry (PS1E0)              [729] that's no good at all, we need to read them
                           and digest them and know what's in them, simply to
                           show not only that we're conscious of our spiritual
                           need, but to encourage others to become conscious of
                           their spiritual needs, so can you see what we said
                           earlier about our lives being involved in other
                           people's too?
                           [730] Not just elders and brothers in the
                           congregation is it?
                           [731] It's us and people out there, there is still
                           people out there sighing and crying and groaning
                           under the detestable things that are going on in
                           this world, I've no doubt you've met many, but, when
                           they say I don't know what the world's coming to,
                           well if you know what's in your magazines and then
                           your literature ... and the reasoning book, all
                           these lovely provisions, because you've devoured it,
                           you've eaten it like that scroll that John was
                           given, it was sweet to him wasn't it?
                           [732] And it's sweet to others as well who want to
                           receive it, but it's also bitter to those who don't,
                           but what a wonderful provision that is from Jehovah,
                           so are we conscious of our spiritual needs, no
                           question we could just ask in passing, you notice
                           the kingdom ministry is changed?
                           [733] Did you notice that?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [734] Mm
Barry (PS1E0)              [735] Some of you are nodding, if you're thinking
                           what is he talking about, what does he mean, then
                           I'd advise you to go and have a look, because you
                           might be dozing off spiritually if you're not aware
                           of what's happening in kingdom ministry at this
                           moment in time.
                           [736] We also mentioned ... don't quibble about
                           assignments and arrangements, now in Romans chapter
                           twelve, which this text is taken from, if you just
                           go to the previous verses, this is from verse twelve
                           isn't it?
                           [737] Erm ... Romans verse ... and verse four ...
                           you notice this text is taken from verse twelve,
                           rejoice in the hope and then persevering prayer, but
                           if you go into verse four, what it's speaking about
                           there, but just as we have in one body many,
                           members, but the members do not all have the same
                           function and then in six to eight he goes on to
                           describe that we all have gifts don't we differing
                           according to the undeserved kindness given to us,
                           whether [...] er so forth and so faith, ministry,
                           erm teaching, exhorting, all these different gifts,
                           though sometimes if a particular brother or sister
                           doesn't have a particular gift and we think well you
                           know that's a bit hard going I can't seem to listen
                           to them, that's an area perhaps where we could erm
                           be quivering couldn't we, or complaining, especially
                           about assignments, you might get speakers that come
                           here from other congregations, and some are better
                           than others aren't they?
                           [738] And you think when, when you get one that's
                           not as good, you think well why do they ... why is
                           it that that speaker can't give such a good talk,
                           why is he giving a talk?
                           [739] Well should we quibble about that, not as
                           individuals should we?
                           [740] The elders in the congregation will take
                           careful note of what's happening in the circuit with
                           regards to these figures and the standard of er
                           talks and so forth and the standard of teaching,
                           well it's not for us to quibble about it is it?
                           [741] And what about those assignments you see that
                           erm, we get from the theocratic ministry school
                           overseer, you've all had them haven't we?

                           whatever has he given me this one for?
                           [744] And so you go back and you say to your brother
                           I just cannot give this, it's impossible you see,
                           well should we be like that?
                           [745] I'm sure very, very few brothers ever do that,
                           sometimes if a mistake is made you might get an
                           assignment like that, which is dealing with er maybe
                           er marital problems or, or certain areas er with,
                           within that sphere, where it's given to youngsters
                           then, then that would be wrong wouldn't it?
                           [746] Er sometimes that has been known and it would
                           be right to, for a youngster to sort of through
                           their mother and father to take it back and say well
                           look er can we have another one, but that would only
                           be on a rare occasion, but if we're given an

                           looked at and said well there's an area that they
                           need to learn about, that need to understand a
                           little more, they know nothing about that particular

                           them to have, we'll make sure they get that, that
                           way they're going to learn, so if ever we always get
                           the easy ones, the ones we know, the ones we've done
                           before, we think I can handle this, you never learn
                           anything do we?
                           [748] So isn't it good for us rather than quibbling,
                           rather than criticizing, and recognizing that we've
                           all got different abilities and perhaps if you
                           hadn't got one of those abilities there, the, the
                           body that it speaks about, you see every part plays
                           a part doesn't it on our physical body and so we are
                           in accommodation, we all have a part to play, and
                           that's the way we, we grow you see and we mature and
                           we become better, able, equipped to go out and tell
                           others, gives us confidence as well if we know what
                           we're talking about, that way we can learn, so never
                           quibble about assignments and arrangements, never
                           criticize brothers and sisters in the congregation.
                           [749] If you've got something to say about anybody,
                           make sure it's good, there's nothing wrong with
                           gossip as long as it's healthy innit?
                           [750] Rather than degrading, why not upgrade
                           brothers and sisters for a change.
                           [751] Perform well whatever assignments you have,
                           have you noticed the Watchtower that were studying
                           today, we've all got it with you I think, just turn
                           to page twenty six ... turn to page twenty two,
                           you'll see what it's about, it's about a brother Roy
                           , who has always advocated ... sticking close to
                           Jehovah's organization, guide to organization, give
                           you a life story, and it's quite interesting
                           reading, and again it's a test of your alertness,
                           your vigilance, whether or not your spirits be awake
                           or not, is this the first time you've seen that
                           article?
                           [752] [laugh] If it is then you need to think
                           carefully about what we're talking about today, and
                           I hope everyone here has read it already cos that
                           shows your spirit alone.
                           [753] Under the heading on page twenty six the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [754] service, look ... you've applied to be a
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [755] and he also applied to be a servant at the
                           headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses in New York in
                           battle, and then nineteen thirty five he was invited
                           to go along to
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [756] and er he went in an old car a model A Ford,
                           there's a model T Ford on that one
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS1E0)              [757] another one he had during his work and he says
                           straight away look I was put to work splitting wood,
                           do you see that in the, paragraph on the right hand
                           side, the next day I was told to report to the dairy
                           barns to help milk cows, then he worked in the
                           garden, he also took care of the bees, harvested
                           honey for the family, then in nineteen fifty three I
                           was transferred to the cheese making farm, now
                           here's a spiritual brother thinking he's going into
                           the battle to do all sorts of spiritual things, and
                           yet these were his assignments, there's a lesson
                           here for you and I.
                           [758] Down the bottom there in, number page twenty
                           six it speaks about another modest man who became a
                           role model for me who's name's John now a member of
                           the governing body of Jehovah Witnesses and he's
                           been quoted over the years as saying it's not so
                           much where you serve, but who you serve that is
                           truly important, can you see that?
                           [759] And then you've got him on the right hand side
                           look making cheese, this is brother again, that's
                           not brother .
                           [760] In nineteen eighty three from nineteen fifty
                           three after thirty years of making cheese, they
                           changed his job, I think many of you are ahead of me
                           already, he said I was given a job change and I
                           began working in landscaping, how nice ... while
                           being interviewed some time ago I was asked what I
                           thought about being giving a job change after thirty
                           years of making cheese and he said well it didn't
                           bother me, I noted, frankly because I didn't like
                           making cheese anyway
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [laugh]
Barry (PS1E0)              [761] so can you see the point of that brothers?
                           [762] If we're given an assignment, whatever it is,
                           perform it well, don't think that I would make a
                           better magazine servant than that brother over there
                           and I don't like it on the accounts, why do they
                           always use me as a hall servant?
                           [763] Why am I always given the responsibility of
                           looking after the microphones, I've done this for
                           years ... well think about this brother here, he
                           made cheese for years and he didn't like the job one
                           bit, now isn't that strange, do you know why?
                           [764] Because he had the right attitude, he didn't
                           quibble, he didn't moan ... he didn't criticize, he
                           just got on with the job, and isn't that a little
                           area that we can all work on somewhere, it comes
                           down to that little bit of territory even, doesn't
                           it, if we're given in the ministry and we say oh not
                           there again, I worked that last time, I know that
                           person in that house they're all working, called on
                           them and when they, I just don't get, I just don't
                           get on with them, they're not me at all, you see,
                           we, we can go on and on in ... all kinds of areas
                           can't we in the truth, but what an attitude to have
                           and I thought this was a lovely expression here,
                           look, erm, on page twenty seven, just about a third
                           of the way down on the right hand side, he says
                           [reading] as I have opportunity, I encourage new
                           ones at that, that would take advantage of all
                           privileged service, they're given, and to learn to
                           be content, and happy with it [] and just in the
                           next paragraph at the end he says [reading] be happy
                           and content in your present circumstances and
                           blossom in a spiritual way in the soil where you are
                           planted [] isn't that a lo a lovely expression,
                           doesn't that show a man who is spiritually alive and
                           alert and awake, and isn't that how we should be,
                           wouldn't the congregation flow and move along
                           forward, so much better and more unitedly if we all
                           have that lovely attitude that Jehovah service, no
                           matter what it is, we can't all be public speakers,
                           we can't all be giving a public talk at the district
                           assembly can we?
                           [765] It's only one that can do it at a time ... we
                           all have a role to play, we're all part of that body
                           aren't we that we've looked at in some, what a
                           lovely description it is, and some of us don't look
                           quite as good as the other part do we?
                           [766] And er some of us seemed to be more awkward
                           than others, I mean some people's feet when you look
                           at them and, and areas like that, that, you think
                           well why did Jehovah make them like that, they're so
                           ugly [laugh] and yet without them where would we be?
                           [767] And isn't that how the congregation is?
                           [768] Some of us seemed to be awkward and the truth,
                           new and the truth, inexperienced, others seemed to
                           be so polished don't they?
                           [769] And they're, they could cope with any
                           situation, but isn't that a little part we all have
                           to play?
                           [770] That's how Jehovah wants things isn't it?
                           [771] And that's how his whole organization
                           worldwide is moving ahead, that's why awake,
                           Jehovah's organization is moving and Christendom's
                           lagging behind, in fact they're, they're falling
                           apart aren't they?
                           [772] Because they are spiritually deaf ... the
                           brother ... Rutherford I think it was years ago
                           described then as dumb dog, what does that
*** 4 (Tape 058602) ***
Barry (PS1E0) [773] You think to yourself now what am I giving, what am I
              giving in the contribution box now as compared to one, two,
              three, four, five, years ago, it may be the same and it may be as
              much as you can afford, well if that's so, then that's grand
              isn't it?
              [774] It's like the widows might, but when you think of the way

Donald (PS1DW)             [777] Oh dear
Anna (PS1DX)               [778] It's when I, when I went to Poland it's not
                           two or three years, it was nineteen seventy three
                           and I was, I was just coming in into the church and
                           the one Witness was with me and we were going in er
                           big town like Cracow, you know, we were going one
                           way and there was a couple coming erm to meet us
                           like you know in, in, in, on the road, and he was
                           just wearing erm jeans and no shirt, but erm a big,
                           big wooden cross on his chest just reaching really
                           across his chest a wooden cross and then erm a
                           safety pin in his nose and three safety pins
                           attached to [laughing] one another through his ears
                           [] and this Witness with me walking down, she says
                           just look at this couple and the girl was, wore the
                           same dress she, she had the top on, you know, but
                           again all sort of queer looking and she, this
                           Witness with me, with me so, she said just look at
                           [laughing] the two [] that's er coming aga to meet
                           us and I said yes and I looked and I said look at
                           the cross and she says yes, it used to be, they used
                           to hang the criminals on the crosses and now the
                           crosses hang on the criminals [laugh] [laughing]
                           isn't that lovely [] , and now the cross is er all
                           the criminals instead of the cross [] , oh yes ...

Donald (PS1DW)             [811] Yes, how nice
Mary (PS1DY)               [812] we used to have a boat as well and then when
                           er, when his erm mind er, well brain self started,
                           you know he had that Alzheimer's disease
Donald (PS1DW)             [813] Oh
Mary (PS1DY)               [814] he couldn't manage to think and I've never
                           learnt how to manage to, that erm, the engine, so we
                           got rid of the boat and then our son he's got a big
                           boat, he's got a real speedboat, a real big one and
                           Julian he's got a smaller speedboat, so both of the
                           boys go there, when we go camping we always have a
                           good time because it's all a family affair like, you
                           know, always get together and erm go on, on a boat,
                           fishing, having fresh mackerels come back and clean
                           them up and fry them straight fresh from the sea,

Donald (PS1DW)             [918] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [919] where it says [reading] where as the sons of
                           the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness
                           outside, this is where the luck we thing the lashing
                           of the teeth will be [] see, which sons of the
                           kingdom is that referring to?
                           [920] It can't be referring to the ones [reading]
                           the sons of the kingdom that are inheriting it [] is
                           it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [921] No, no
None (KBXPS000)            [922] So which sons of the kingdom is he talking
                           about?
Donald (PS1DW)             [923] That's a good question, erm, what, what,
                           scripture is it Mark?
None (KBXPS000)            [924] Erm, Matthew chapter eight, verses twelve ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [925] Let's have a look what's er surrounding er
                           verses say
None (KBXPS000)            [926] Mm it's after the army officer, the army
                           officer is asking him to treat his manservants for
                           some
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [927] yes
None (KBXPS000)            [928] and then I hear him back, he says that he's
                           got great faith to believe ... the truth, know the
                           truth, mhm, mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [929] Oh, I can see you're getting me baffled this
                           morning
None (KBXPS000)            [930] Mhm ... it must be talking erm some other
                           kingdom, that's all I can suggest, maybe
Donald (PS1DW)             [931] Erm ... it says here [reading] whereas [] I'll
                           read from eleven shall I?
None (KBXPS000)            [932] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [933] [reading] Many from eastern parts and western
                           parts will come and decline at the table with
                           Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the
                           heavens [] and erm as regards to these ones,
                           Abraham, Isaac and Jacob erm, at the kingdom of the
                           heavens, while these ones were born before Jesus
                           weren't they?
None (KBXPS000)            [934] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [935] So we know from previous studies that these
                           ones when they die haven't gone to heaven
None (KBXPS000)            [936] Not initially no
Donald (PS1DW)             [937] No
None (KBXPS000)            [938] they must of done
Donald (PS1DW)             [939] so, so so, yes, so they will, so the kingdom
                           of heaven of the heavens it mentions well, thy
                           kingdom come on earth doesn't it on
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [940] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [941] so, bearing that in mind let's see what it
                           says at verse twelve [reading] whereas the sons of
                           the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness [] well
                           there will be some of the sons of the kingdom thrown
                           into the darkness outside, because this, this proved
                           futile, they, they haven't er ... lived in faith
                           have they?
                           [942] Some of them gone away from the kitchen
None (KBXPS000)            [943] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [944] er [reading] refrained outside, where, there
                           is where they're weeping and [...] []
None (KBXPS000)            [945] Er another scripture here to suggest whether
                           this, this is on the same sort of er apart from
                           that's it, chapter thirteen and Luke
Donald (PS1DW)             [946] Hold on just a sec
None (KBXPS000)            [947] chapter thirteen ... have you got the volume
                           too high there?
Donald (PS1DW)             [948] I think perhaps I have haven't I?
None (KBXPS000)            [949] Mm you've got the volume too high, yeah, you
                           won't get, you'll get your feedback, that means
                           you've got the volume too high, where's the volume?
Donald (PS1DW)             [950] Yeah it's on eight now, shall I put it on
None (KBXPS000)            [951] Oh you've got it miles too high, yeah you've
                           got it miles too high, that's why you're getting
                           feedback, turn it right down, right down to about
                           number two or three or something like that
Donald (PS1DW)             [952] Oh we won't be able to hear
None (KBXPS000)            [953] Well you don't want to hear what you
Donald (PS1DW)             [954] Yeah read some of that then eh?
None (KBXPS000)            [955] you don't want to hear too much of what you're
                           recording anyway do you? ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [956] Erm
None (KBXPS000)            [957] Yeah this is in Luke chapter thirteen ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [958] Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, Luke ... Luke
                           thirteen yes
None (KBXPS000)            [959] and probably if you go from about twenty five
                           or somewhere round there, you'll get the context of
                           it
Donald (PS1DW)             [960] Yeah, twenty five says [reading] when once the
                           householder has got up and locked the door and you
                           start to stand outside and knock at the door saying
                           sir open to us, but in answer he will say to you, I
                           do not know where you are from, then you will start
                           saying we ate and drank in front of you and we've
                           taught in our broad ways, but he will speak and say
                           to you, I do not know where you are from, get away
                           from me you are workers of unrighteousness []
None (KBXPS000)            [961] Mm, this one now [reading] there is, where
                           you'll []
Donald (PS1DW)             [962] [reading] there is where your whipping and the
                           gnashing of your teeth will be when you see Abraham,
                           Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom
                           of God []
None (KBXPS000)            [963] [reading] in the kingdom of God [] , but your
                           half of it's thrown outside
Donald (PS1DW)             [964] Yes, but you'll also be going outside, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [965] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [966] erm
None (KBXPS000)            [967] that mentions Abraham, Isaac and Jacob there
                           again doesn't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [968] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [969] I'm just wondering if there that's related to
                           that scripture that I've just showed you
Donald (PS1DW)             [970] Oh yes
None (KBXPS000)            [971] It seems to be on the same lines don't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [972] Yes, because Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were
                           all witnesses of Jes Jesus' ministry on the earth
                           weren't they?
None (KBXPS000)            [973] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [974] And erm, they recorded different things, but
                           Mat but also they recorded the same things as well
None (KBXPS000)            [975] Mm, see the relation is also the sons of the
                           kingdom will be the ones where the gnashing of the
                           teeth er, er will be
Donald (PS1DW)             [976] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [977] outside the kingdom then
Donald (PS1DW)             [978] yes, yes, that's why it tells us in verse
                           twenty four of Luke thirteen ... [reading] ex exert
                           yourself vigorously to get in through the narrow
                           door
None (KBXPS000)            [979] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [980] because many I tell you will seek to get in,
                           but will not be able []
None (KBXPS000)            [981] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [982] So
None (KBXPS000)            [983] going back to the, the other chapter
Donald (PS1DW)             [984] See we, if I can just say Mark now, you and I
                           know this truth,pe pe people in the world generally
                           don't know what you and I know do they?
                           [985] That's why the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [986] of the kingdom must go from door to door, from
                           city to city from village to village, they don't
                           know about it, but once we do know about it then
                           we're sort of accountable aren't we?
None (KBXPS000)            [987] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [988] That's right, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [989] responsible, yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [990] we don't want to be like these ones that erm
                           ... got to know and it, and er that have done away,
                           it says erm that's where the gnashing and at the
                           tooth will be thrown outside
None (KBXPS000)            [991] You see this one in chapter, page of Matthew,
                           and verse twelve as I mentioned, I was just
                           wondering if some, if that's got something to do
                           with the faith of the army officers or something
                           like, cos
Donald (PS1DW)             [992] Oh yes I think erm
None (KBXPS000)            [993] whether it's related to that particular thing
Donald (PS1DW)             [994] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [995] you know
Donald (PS1DW)             [996] well it, well it would be, but it's a set
                           pattern for us as we are today
None (KBXPS000)            [997] Mm ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [998] Yes ... the army officers, shall we just read
                           a bit more of that bit?
None (KBXPS000)            [999] Mm a bit further back probably
Donald (PS1DW)             [1000] Yeah, just to get the picture of it
None (KBXPS000)            [1001] Mm, cos it's got in relation to that ain't
                           it?
                           [1002] Somehow or other
Donald (PS1DW)             [1003] Yes, that's
None (KBXPS000)            [1004] it's sort of in relation to it, there must of
                           been some reason why he said that to take them to,
                           hear more to other people
Donald (PS1DW)             [1005] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1006] must of had a bearing on him saying that
Donald (PS1DW)             [1007] Oh yes, I think the story is that, Matthew
                           heard this voice, shall we just read from there?
None (KBXPS000)            [1008] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1009] Because then Jesus said to him, who was he
                           talking to, let's, let's start off on the verse one
                           [reading] after er after he had come down from the
                           mountains, great crowds followed him [] that's Jesus
                           isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1010] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1011] [reading] and with a leprous man came over
                           and began doing a [...] to him saying, Lord if you
                           just want to you can make me clean, and so
                           stretching out his hand he touched him saying, I
                           want to be made clean and immediately his leprosy
                           was, vanished away, then Jesus said to him, see that
                           you tell no one, but go and show yourself to the
                           priest and offer the gift that Moses appointed for
                           the purpose of a witness to them ... when he entered
                           into Calpurnia that's the other two, that the other
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1012] isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1013] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1014] [reading] When he entered into Calpurnia an
                           army officer came to him and tricking him and
                           saying, sir, my manservant is laid up in the house
                           with paralysis being terribly tormented, he said to
                           him when I get there I will cure her ... in reply
                           the army officer said sir, I am not a fit man for
                           you to enter under my roof, but just say the word
                           and my manservant will be healed []
None (KBXPS000)            [1015] That's the old faith int it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1016] Exactly, Jesus was saying to this officer
                           that I'll cure your master when I get there
None (KBXPS000)            [1017] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1018] but what, but what marvellous faith he must
                           of had
None (KBXPS000)            [1019] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1020] Yes, you say they were they
None (KBXPS000)            [1021] Mm, yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1022] hadn't got to be there and he could be cured
None (KBXPS000)            [1023] Mm, yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1024] that's right Mark, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1025] He had the faith that's the main thing int
                           it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1026] Yes ... er it goes on to say, erm ...
                           [reading] for I too am a man placed under authority,
                           having soldiers under me [] see Jesus was a man of
                           authority the other officer was saying the same
None (KBXPS000)            [1027] Mm, the bribery, yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1028] Mm, that's right, and [reading] I say to this
                           one be on your way and he's on his way and to
                           another come and he comes and to my slave dither and
                           he does it.
                           [1029] Hearing that Jesus became amazed and said to
                           those following him, I tell you the truth but no one
                           in Israel have I faced to a greater face [] so
                           that's quite some statement that Jesus has made
None (KBXPS000)            [1030] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1031] now we don't learn a lot about, we don't know
                           much about this army officer except what we've just
                           read, and even though the, we, we know of quite a
                           few people in the bible, he says in Israel there's
                           no one with greater faith than this army officer, so
                           he's quite some man isn't he?
None (KBXPS000)            [1032] Mm ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1033] Yes ... very good
None (KBXPS000)            [1034] but we haven't erm ... gone to, to explain
                           why he's mentioned that particular point in chapter
                           twelve
Donald (PS1DW)             [1035] Erm in
None (KBXPS000)            [1036] In what relation is that, you know tie in to
                           that particular great faith that he had
Donald (PS1DW)             [1037] I, I'll go on reading then from eleven shall
                           I?
                           [1038] [reading] But I tell you that many from
                           eastern parts and western parts would come and
                           recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
                           and the kingdom of the heavens, whereas the sons of
                           the kingdom will be thrown into darkness ...
                           outside, that, there is where the weaken and the
                           nation of the two []
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1039] so what's that got to do with that particular
                           that
Donald (PS1DW)             [1040] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1041] faith which he had?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1042] Yeah, well
None (KBXPS000)            [1043] There must of been some particular reason
                           why, why, why he mentioned that, which maybe might
                           be difficult to try and realize
Donald (PS1DW)             [1044] Yes I can see your point Mark I see
None (KBXPS000)            [1045] you know in other words it might take a bit
                           of time to work it out, there is some reason why he
                           must of said that mustn't didn't he?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1046] Yes why did he go on to speak about this
None (KBXPS000)            [1047] Mm, in other words why did, why did he
                           continue in chapter eleven go on about there will be
                           many in eastern parts will come and required at the
                           table or in other words in the kingdom
Donald (PS1DW)             [1048] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1049] there must of been some relation problem with
                           each other, the earlier ... erm thing
Donald (PS1DW)             [1050] When it's asked, when it says I tell you
                           mainly from the eastern parts and western parts,
                           well we're from the western parts aren't we?
None (KBXPS000)            [1051] Mm, mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1052] In other words it's, it's sticking from east
                           to west, people will know of all the thing, it's er
                           tell you that many from eastern parts and western
                           parts were called and reclined at the table, in
                           other words this, well this good news that Jesus was
                           sticking on this
None (KBXPS000)            [1053] Ah, I think I know why he mentioned that then
Donald (PS1DW)             [1054] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1055] because that required faith at the same sort
                           as the army officer had
Donald (PS1DW)             [1056] Yes and the
None (KBXPS000)            [1057] and the ones that had been cast out would be
                           without that thing, so that's why it's gone in
                           relation to that it's because those that didn't have
                           the faith that the army officer had would be cast
                           out as the sons, of the sons of the kingdom, that's
                           why he mentioned it in likeness
Donald (PS1DW)             [1058] The, the type
None (KBXPS000)            [1059] there
Donald (PS1DW)             [1060] of faith
None (KBXPS000)            [1061] That's right, you
Donald (PS1DW)             [1062] but
None (KBXPS000)            [1063] needed that same type of faith as he had,
                           that's why he said that er, those without that faith
                           would be cast into darkness
Donald (PS1DW)             [1064] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1065] that's why he said related to it somehow
Donald (PS1DW)             [1066] Yes not that you've all had that same faith
                           as the other officer had
None (KBXPS000)            [1067] Mm, cos there , that chapter thirteen
Donald (PS1DW)             [1068] but not to that degree degree, yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1069] Mm, it carries on of the same account there
                           then he said to the army officer you see
Donald (PS1DW)             [1070] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1071] [reading] go just as it has been your faith
Donald (PS1DW)             [1072] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1073] so let it come to pass for you and the
                           manservant were yield [] so that particular was all
                           about faith, so
Donald (PS1DW)             [1074] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1075] those without the faith in the certain sons
                           of the kingdom will be cast out
Donald (PS1DW)             [1076] Yes, now that kingdom is, is in the Lord's
                           prayer as we mentioned is gone into the air and
None (KBXPS000)            [1077] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1078] and everybody will have an opportunity of
                           learning about that kingdom
None (KBXPS000)            [1079] Mm, you see at the end of the day one has to
                           work out if this is gonna be an earthly er point
                           towards the kingdom, that's the different between
                           ... this faith and any other faith isn't it?
                           [1080] Any other faith doesn't believe there's gonna
                           be an earth left does, do they?
                           [1081] They be
Donald (PS1DW)             [1082] Has a, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1083] they believe it's all going to be in a story
                           don't they?
                           [1084] Basically
Donald (PS1DW)             [1085] Yes a lot of people will read that yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1086] but you see unless the day was cut short no
                           flesh would be saved anyway, so it proves in Matthew
                           that there is gonna be some flesh left
Donald (PS1DW)             [1087] Yes, that's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1088] and as we've learnt in first Corinthians
                           chapter fifteen that all different animals have
                           different sorts of flesh, we've got different flesh
                           than, than different animals haven't we
Donald (PS1DW)             [1089] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1090] than than dogs and fish have got different
                           flesh
Donald (PS1DW)             [1091] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1092] so that the new flesh that we require will be
                           a different sort of flesh than we've got now
                           probably in the new order or whatever it is, you
                           know, we might require a different sort of flesh
                           mightn't we?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1093] Well if we
None (KBXPS000)            [1094] Which is more, but let's face it at the
                           moment wears out as it grows older doesn't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1095] Aye, do you know why that is don't you?
None (KBXPS000)            [1096] Cos it's, cos of the sin obviously
Donald (PS1DW)             [1097] The sin of element passed
None (KBXPS000)            [1098] that been broken yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1099] passed down towards us, that's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1100] Yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1101] but, and this kingdom takes over, Jesus was a
                           ransom sacrifice, he brought, bought people back,
                           that's, those that have faith, so in the new, when
                           this new system comes round, when the king comes
                           round the earth we'll start to grow young again, and
                           then that way we'll have a sort of a different flesh
                           won't we?
None (KBXPS000)            [1102] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1103] When we grow young again
None (KBXPS000)            [1104] Mhm ... it'll be, you see, you are, if you, I
                           think if you believe in, in God which is the main
                           point of the thing, then you can believe who's
                           capable of anything
Donald (PS1DW)             [1105] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1106] I mean, you've got to bear in mind that God
                           created the, the heavens and, and the earth and any
                           human that's er in God's memory who's is deceased
                           out the way, if you've got enough faith, you can
                           believe that you can bring anything back
Donald (PS1DW)             [1107] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1108] if you've got the faith, if you believe in
                           God in other words, you've got the faith
Donald (PS1DW)             [1109] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1110] you've got to believe in God first before you
                           can get the faith
Donald (PS1DW)             [1111] Exactly
None (KBXPS000)            [1112] you know what I mean
Donald (PS1DW)             [1113] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1114] so if you do believe then well, then you can
                           believe that anything's possible
Donald (PS1DW)             [1115] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1116] with God
Donald (PS1DW)             [1117] Well you've only got to go back to what we've
                           been discussing and Jesus
None (KBXPS000)            [1118] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1119] when he was on the earth, he cured that
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1120] didn't he?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1121] Mhm
None (KBXPS000)            [1122] For somebody to doubt there will be urge of
                           people on in paradise, it's doubting God's power
                           isn't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1123] Exactly
None (KBXPS000)            [1124] Mm, so people that just believe that you're
                           going to heaven haven't quite got the faith to
                           believe that there'll be people on earth as well
Donald (PS1DW)             [1125] Exactly, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1126] well anything's possible with God cos he
                           created everything, if he's created the stars and
                           the moon and, and the heavens, then [laughing] he
                           can [] create whatever he wants to
Donald (PS1DW)             [1127] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1128] it's up to him isn't it in a way
Donald (PS1DW)             [1129] Yes, that's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1130] that ultimate thing
Donald (PS1DW)             [1131] Yes indeed, being as he's a God as well
None (KBXPS000)            [1132] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1133] he's only got erm, well I mean provisions and
                           store for those whose artist complete towards them
None (KBXPS000)            [1134] Mm, and that, and that, at the end of the day
                           I suppose there has to be a point for the kingdom
                           ... and it wasn't easy to get into that because all
                           the, the, the accounts are all about how big a
                           struggle it is, to get into the kingdom
Donald (PS1DW)             [1135] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1136] which proves that it wouldn't be easy to get
                           in there anyway, so
Donald (PS1DW)             [1137] No
None (KBXPS000)            [1138] it isn't granted automatically, it's
                           something that has to be worked out because it's not
                           easy to get there it's a narrow gate
Donald (PS1DW)             [1139] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1140] so did the automatic thing which proves that
                           it takes a bit of time and patience before you've
                           achieved this
Donald (PS1DW)             [1141] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1142] it isn't like an immortal soul which is sort
                           of given automatically
Donald (PS1DW)             [1143] That's right, yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1144] you have to have faith don't you?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1145] Yes ... yes ... mm and with all the different
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1146] about God that they are on the earth today
None (KBXPS000)            [1147] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1148] which are literally thousands of them
None (KBXPS000)            [1149] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1150] they contradict each other, they fight each
                           other , they kill each other
None (KBXPS000)            [1151] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1152] all in the name of God, and the very thing
                           that God has said don't do
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1153] mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1154] [clears throat] So if, religion really is the
                           biggest conflict that's ever been devised
None (KBXPS000)            [1155] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1156] to, to, there's people plenty serving God,
                           well actually they're serving the devil
None (KBXPS000)            [1157] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1158] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1159] Mm, and a lot of er the religions believe in
                           things that er aren't true like Santa Claus
Donald (PS1DW)             [1160] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1161] and things like that, that is a lie
Donald (PS1DW)             [1162] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1163] it's not truth is it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1164] It isn't
None (KBXPS000)            [1165] So a lot of, a lot of them tell like fairy
                           tales, a lot of people tell fairy tales for young,
                           at young children, it's all aimed at young children
                           when they're not old enough to understand what's
                           truth and what isn't [laughing] they're not [] old,
                           they're not in their own understanding yet when
                           they're children so they sort of, not in their
                           conscious sense anyway
Donald (PS1DW)             [1166] What
None (KBXPS000)            [1167] but you
Donald (PS1DW)             [1168] what did the Catholic policeman say, give me
                           a boy until he's seven and I'll give you the man
None (KBXPS000)            [1169] Mhm ... it's all, it's all ... you see at the
                           end of the day it'll be the ones that, that are in
                           charge of erm
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1170] got to get the worse judgement, because they
                           are more responsible
Donald (PS1DW)             [1171] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1172] got to be the ones that are in charge, in
                           other words the ones that have been mislead, God
                           might overlook because they didn't know that they
                           were probably being mislead
Donald (PS1DW)             [1173] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1174] you see what I mean?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1175] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1176] In other words they weren't in the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1177] explained
Donald (PS1DW)             [1178] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1179] because
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1180] says to him, but we're not blind also are we?
                           [1181] And then he replied that well just because
                           you think you're not blind, then you must be
Donald (PS1DW)             [1182] Mm
None (KBXPS000)            [1183] [laughing] you know [] like it's reversed
                           [laugh] they thought they, they, the words, so they
                           must of been if that's how it is
Donald (PS1DW)             [1184] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1185] just when you, you, you think you're not
                           lying you probably are
Donald (PS1DW)             [1186] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1187] and when you think you are, you're probably
                           not
Donald (PS1DW)             [1188] Yes [laugh]
None (KBXPS000)            [1189] [laugh] it's like
Donald (PS1DW)             [1190] So
None (KBXPS000)            [1191] a two way thing, you know
Donald (PS1DW)             [1192] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1193] one after the
Donald (PS1DW)             [1194] but it, if everybody has the opportunities
                           listening to the good news of the kingdom, in the,
                           in the old world [clears throat] well then people
                           have a chance, that means a, everybody's having a
                           chance doesn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1195] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1196] If you mention like, if people don't hear
                           this how will they, well it says in Romans doesn't
                           it?
                           [1197] Romans, just have a look at Romans, ten ...
                           Romans chapter ten
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [1198] Excuse me Mark
None (KBXPS000)            [1199] Mm
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1200] a bit later, yeah
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [1201] Yes, alright, sorry for interrupting you
None (KBXPS000)            [1202] No it's alright, keep talking
Donald (PS1DW)             [1203] Yeah it says, Romans ten, verse thirteen,
                           [reading] for every everyone who calls on the name
                           of Jehovah, will be saved, however, how will they
                           call on him if in him they'd not put faith, how in
                           turn will they put faith in him, if him they've not
                           heard, how in turn will they hear without someone to
                           preach, how in turn will they preach unless they've
                           been sent forth [] , just as it is written,
                           [reading] how come we are at the feet of those who
                           declare good news of good things [] well that's more
                           or less what we were saying isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1204] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1205] People have, have got to have this
                           opportunity to listen to the good news erm
None (KBXPS000)            [1206] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1207] if, if they refuse, well that's, that's a
                           choice they have isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1208] Mm, see one of the dangers of just reading
                           the bible is that you have to be careful you don't
                           fall into the pitfall of just reading it ... when if
                           you do then it'll all look as if it's pointing
                           towards the only way out is heaven
Donald (PS1DW)             [1209] Yes and you've got the time
None (KBXPS000)            [1210] because all the scriptures in the first
                           gospel are all pushing in how to get to that place
Donald (PS1DW)             [1211] That's right, cos these first ones, sorry for
                           interrupting Mark, go on
None (KBXPS000)            [1212] Mm , yeah, the, all the scriptures from then
                           on even are all pointed out to achieve this heavenly
                           thing
Donald (PS1DW)             [1213] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1214] but er at the end of the day there has to be
                           a purpose for it ... so unless you, you, you put it
                           into action, then you, if you just read, then you're
                           in danger of having a bigger judgment than somebody
                           that was ignorant
Donald (PS1DW)             [1215] Mm
None (KBXPS000)            [1216] you know of not knowing, so that the
                           responsibility becomes higher the more you learn
Donald (PS1DW)             [1217] Yes, more have came to me that's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1218] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1219] and erm ... in erm, speaking about it however
                           and in mentioning about the scriptures which
                           referring about them
None (KBXPS000)            [1220] Mm, most of them do don't they?
                           [1221] Most of the scriptures are all out, out to
                           achieve that because they had to acha achieve
                           perfection at the end of the day didn't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1222] But, what, which ones are going to heaven?
                           [1223] Everybody?
None (KBXPS000)            [1224] Well, the scriptures really mention how a man
                           drives for the kingdom of God, so mainly it's the
                           man, I don't know whether women go to the, the
                           heavenly ground, it doesn't actually mention that
                           does it anywhere?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1225] Well the amended ones
None (KBXPS000)            [1226] Mm, are they men or, or are they known to all
                           women?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1227] Both aren't they?
None (KBXPS000)            [1228] I don't know er sort of
Donald (PS1DW)             [1229] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1230] question that I meant to, meant to ask, which
                           I don't know whether there are women there, cos
                           mainly the scriptures mentioned about, it's the man
                           that's got the lead isn't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1231] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1232] You very rarely talk about women going to
                           heaven
Donald (PS1DW)             [1233] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1234] do they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1235] Well, it, the reason, you know the reason why
                           some are going to heaven, when you think of a
                           kingdom
None (KBXPS000)            [1236] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1237] and you think of our country here in England
None (KBXPS000)            [1238] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1239] you've got, there's the queen she's the head
                           of the country
None (KBXPS000)            [1240] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1241] and she, to help her to run the country she's
                           got a parliament
None (KBXPS000)            [1242] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1243] now in heaven, Jesus is the king and Jesus
                           will, will have a certain number with him in heaven
                           to rule over the earth, a
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1244] with him
None (KBXPS000)            [1245] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1246] and these ones will be made up, er faithful
                           ones from, taken from Jesus'
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1247] they'll be made up of faithful ones, that er
                           will, will have to die, they'll have to shove their
                           flesh with
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1248] to go to heaven to be part of this kingdom,
                           but for the rest of mankind which are obedient,
                           which do accept er the truth, they will live in
                           paradise on the earth.
None (KBXPS000)            [1249] Mm, you see, a lot of the er the English
                           scriptures talk about the, the paradise in, in its
                           right context, you can just examine the, the, the
                           Christian script which you might get confused
                           because there's a lot of er things that can take
                           them both ways
Donald (PS1DW)             [1250] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1251] like for instance chapter ten of John, verse
                           sixteen which talks about other sheep which are not
                           of this fold, you, you might think that er that's
                           talking about, what er, the logical sense of that
                           scripture is that the dividing line with sheep ...
                           and you get different sort of folds don't you?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1252] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1253] So at that time that could of been taken into
                           the context of, or one anyway, going to the same
                           place
Donald (PS1DW)             [1254] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1255] which only in future years that er, it's
                           added up to er significant point
Donald (PS1DW)             [1256] That's right and then er, those ones, those
                           sheep which you've just mentioned er are a myth
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1257] oh ... mm cos one thing really gave the key
                           away was in the, the sermon on the mount where Jesus
                           said that the meek ought, ought to inherit the earth
Donald (PS1DW)             [1258] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1259] which proves that er, that it's a separate
                           class
Donald (PS1DW)             [1260] For those who are going to heaven
None (KBXPS000)            [1261] well, mm this is the point at the end of the
                           day to prove the truth, you've gotta prove in your
                           mind that there is gonna be a separate sort of clasp
                           between the what, there, there is a scripture, I
                           think
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [1262] Come on [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1263] it's in first Corinthians, it talks about
                           for, I think I'm in a vision of the third heaven,
                           which was actually a vision, it wasn't a reality
                           it's like a revelation was a vision, I don't think
                           it was the reality of heaven was it?
                           [1264] It was vision
Donald (PS1DW)             [1265] I can't comment without just looking
                           [laughing] at it Mark er I'm afraid []
None (KBXPS000)            [1266] [laugh] No there was a vision and I think
                           the, the Apostle had was of the third heaven
Donald (PS1DW)             [1267] Yes, yes you may be right, but I'm, I'm just
                           about erm in the dark a bit
None (KBXPS000)            [1268] the third heaven I thought it I think, I've,
                           I've looked in the re the aid book, what does the
                           third heaven, it was er ... it was more of a, a
                           dream, more of a sym symbolic dream ... more than
                           natural reality of vision of heaven do you know what
                           I mean?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1269] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1270] You see a lot of the er, a lot of the vision
                           that they had
Donald (PS1DW)             [1271] Something typifying
None (KBXPS000)            [1272] Mm, the visions that they had were not as
                           reality they were only like visions they had
Donald (PS1DW)             [1273] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1274] they weren't actually real heaven or real
                           there's basic weren't the
Donald (PS1DW)             [1275] Oh yes, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1276] colourful visions
Donald (PS1DW)             [1277] oh lots of visions were, were had by
None (KBXPS000)            [1278] Mm, see that's that's the difference which
                           have to click in your mind
Donald (PS1DW)             [1279] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1280] that even in, in, in the revelation, the very
                           beginning chapters to of had one to about chapter
                           seven were very easy to understand, once you
                           understand what they're saying, because they're all
                           letters to each congregation at that time weren't
                           they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1281] Yes they were, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1282] They, they were er, the, the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1283] to the congregation of, of wherever send this
                           letter and John has to send these letters, but the
                           letters were the spirits talking
Donald (PS1DW)             [1284] That's right yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1285] they're all the spirits talking to them
Donald (PS1DW)             [1286] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1287] giving them information
Donald (PS1DW)             [1288] Yes, that's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1289] that's basically the sort of revelation isn't
                           it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1290] That's right, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1291] And the angel whose congregation the let
                           letters were sent to
Donald (PS1DW)             [1292] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1293] one logical thing is ... that erm, if erm
                           letters were sent to er, to angels, which I don't
                           know whether that the judges believe that, then you
                           wouldn't actually need to send the literal letters
                           to, er angels [laughing] who, it because [] they'd
                           be far advanced in, in whatever they've got
Donald (PS1DW)             [1294] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1295] so you know the, these one thing you'll have
                           to work out in a logical side of revelation
Donald (PS1DW)             [1296] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1297] in other words if you read it without any
                           experience you might start thinking that it's giving
                           you a vision of the real heaven [laughing] where []
                           as it's just symbolic
Donald (PS1DW)             [1298] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1299] it's all symbolism, and this is one of the
                           things you have to work out, to, to find out whether
                           there is er
Donald (PS1DW)             [1300] You know, can I just ask you something?
                           [1301] Talk about angels you know, these are
                           heavenly erm spirits aren't they?
None (KBXPS000)            [1302] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1303] Erm, now can you remember in the book of
                           Genesis where it says sons of the true God?
                           [1304] ... Er they took on flesh and the you
None (KBXPS000)            [1305] Oh the ones that were disobedient?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1306] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1307] Yeah, yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1308] an angels that turn bad, just like a lot of
                           mankind turn bad ... er they put on flesh then for
                           the purpose of marrying the goodlooking daughters of
                           men
None (KBXPS000)            [1309] Mm

                           these fallen angels have they died?
                           [1311] Or are they still about today?
                           [1312] Or what?
                           [1313] What do you know about them?
None (KBXPS000)            [1314] Mm, well obviously they've been casting bonds
                           ... and tell judgment
Donald (PS1DW)             [1315] Can, well, can they influence us today?
None (KBXPS000)            [1316] The de if they're demons, yeah they can yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1317] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1318] they do exist
Donald (PS1DW)             [1319] Then, then the demons are these proper angels
                           at one time
None (KBXPS000)            [1320] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1321] weren't they?
                           [1322] Fallen
None (KBXPS000)            [1323] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1324] angels
None (KBXPS000)            [1325] Er to, to work the truth out of things, one
                           has to think what Adam, Adam had lost in the
                           beginning, what Jesus had to gain back, cos
                           according to the Corinthian's letter that erm Jesus
                           came back to buy back what Adam had lost and if you
                           can work out what Adam had lost in the, in the first
                           place, then you can see the point why you're put on
                           the earth and you can see that it, that he, he was
                           given a commandment not to take off the, the tree of
                           kno knowledge written by weren't he?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1326] That's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1327] If he can work out that er, what would of
                           happened if he probably wouldn't of taken that ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1328] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1329] and what was taken away when, when he did
                           break the rule, then you can work out what Jesus
                           brought back
Donald (PS1DW)             [1330] Yes, that's right then you can work that out
None (KBXPS000)            [1331] which was God's spirit in some way
Donald (PS1DW)             [1332] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1333] what, he must of lost God's spirit mustn't he
                           Adam?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1334] Oh yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1335] On his way
Donald (PS1DW)             [1336] yes, to a large degree
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1337] mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1338] that spirit
None (KBXPS000)            [1339] and that's
Donald (PS1DW)             [1340] he broke, he broke the ageing process on the
                           human race
None (KBXPS000)            [1341] Mm, cos that's what Jesus came to buy back
                           God's spirit
Donald (PS1DW)             [1342] That's it, because he was a perfect man Jesus
None (KBXPS000)            [1343] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1344] not, not like erm ... any descendants that
                           would go on from Adam [clears throat] were born
                           imperfect weren't they?
None (KBXPS000)            [1345] Mm, it's alright I've just seen a, a woman er
                           passing a three wheeler on the pavement here, wheel
                           chair and she was doing quite a bit of a speed, I
                           was just gonna get my, my [laugh] my speed checker
                           [laugh]
Donald (PS1DW)             [laugh]
None (KBXPS000)            [1346] know of her, see if she was speeding on the
                           pavement [laugh]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1347] [laugh] ... Well getting back to these fallen
                           angels in what way must try and lead mankind today?
                           ...
None (KBXPS000)            [1348] One of the big ways is, is spiritualism and
                           things that are not real, things that are sort of er
                           blind in the mind of the unbeliever as it were, in
                           other words material things probably and things that
                           have under revelation ...
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1349] according towards the under revelation he
                           talks about how these, these dumb idols and these
                           pieces of gold have got nothing in them and that'd
                           be way in which the, the [...] ones would be caught
                           out, because of these gold or whatever have got
                           nothing in them you see.
Donald (PS1DW)             [1350] What, what about Ouija boards?
None (KBXPS000)            [1351] Well this is another method isn't it?
                           [1352] Er
Donald (PS1DW)             [cough]
None (KBXPS000)            [1353] of tricking people into believing sort of
                           things that aren't true, which they're saying that
                           er they're talking to deceased people like people
                           said they talked to er Elvis Presley [laugh]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1354] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1355] has been er one woman that claims to
                           continuously talk to him from where he, where he,
                           where he is, where, you know
Donald (PS1DW)             [1356] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1357] so obviously she's assuming that she's
                           talking to Elvis, but er, she can't prove it
Donald (PS1DW)             [1358] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1359] obviously beyond that, that sort of thing
                           can't prove anyway, but she's claiming to, to talk
                           to this particular singer, whatever, you know.
Donald (PS1DW)             [1360] Lots, lots of people claim, in fact ever such
                           a lot of people claim that they've got communication
                           with the dead, for instance that, as you know I've
                           got a caravan ain't I at Rudyard Lake?
None (KBXPS000)            [1361] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1362] And there's a lady there, and er, got a
                           caravan and her husband had died and she wanted me
                           to swap caravans, her's was actually a better
                           condition caravan than mine
None (KBXPS000)            [1363] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1364] where it, she said it was too big for her and
                           er she wanted something smaller, with a swap, well I
                           didn't swap for the reason mine was overlooking the
                           lake, it was in a better position, and er, then she
                           told me the reason she wanted to swap cos er, she
                           said it was too big cos her husband had died, I
                           started to speak to her about when God's kingdom
                           comes on the earth, these dead ones will come back,
                           these loved ones
None (KBXPS000)            [1365] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1366] oh he's already with me now she says
None (KBXPS000)            [1367] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1368] he's already with me
None (KBXPS000)            [1369] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1370] and she, she was absolutely sure, and there's
                           lots of people that
None (KBXPS000)            [1371] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1372] say things like that
None (KBXPS000)            [1373] Mm, well actually when, when somebody passes
                           away lots of people say that when they pass away
                           they've received their spirit
Donald (PS1DW)             [1374] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1375] that's came to them
Donald (PS1DW)             [1376] Yes, so what act, so do you know Mark what it
                           is that makes these people think those things?
None (KBXPS000)            [1377] Well there must be another force that makes
                           them see them things mustn't there?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1378] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1379] Er, it isn't actually controlled by them
Donald (PS1DW)             [1380] No
None (KBXPS000)            [1381] it is actually some other thing
Donald (PS1DW)             [1382] and
None (KBXPS000)            [1383] you know
Donald (PS1DW)             [1384] and this other force is the fallen angels,
                           the demons, if they, they can have, oh this women
                           used to say oh he's with me, he, he's in bed with me
                           at night
None (KBXPS000)            [1385] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1386] so these demons, these fallen angels have
                           got, you see, you've got to serve them and, and
                           those of the bible, but once you're dead, you go to
                           the grave you see and that's it, you're not
                           conscious of anything at all it says
None (KBXPS000)            [1387] Mm, what, the
Donald (PS1DW)             [1388] but, but these things
None (KBXPS000)            [1389] You've got to bear in mind though that, that,
                           that the scriptures which you can use in the Hebrew
                           context were before the resurrection was possible,
                           so you had to be careful that er, that you don't
                           bounce because when Jesus came to the earth he
                           changed that though didn't he?
                           [1390] ... He, he made possible for, for a
                           resurrection
Donald (PS1DW)             [1391] Oh that's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1392] you know what I mean?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1393] Yes, but only for a, for a, for a, a few
                           isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1394] Well obviously
Donald (PS1DW)             [1395] Relatively few and compared those that are
                           going in the end going to another year
None (KBXPS000)            [1396] Well the scriptures do say that, that er
                           there are those that'll be lost
Donald (PS1DW)             [1397] Yes well in
None (KBXPS000)            [1398] so there's gotta be some hope for those that
                           have, have gone lost or whatever hasn't there?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1399] Erm ... in the past?
None (KBXPS000)            [1400] Mm, no, well ... there isn't much hope for
                           those that rejected Jesus in his time
Donald (PS1DW)             [1401] No I'm
None (KBXPS000)            [1402] cos he mentioned that those were liable
                           further to start him as a
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1403] because he was actually there at the present,
                           if they, if they couldn't believe that when he was
                           around then they've got a big problem [laughing]
                           haven't they [] ?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1404] That's right yes, if they coul God's son on
                           the earth during these
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1405] and if they couldn't accept him then
None (KBXPS000)            [1406] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1407] then they're not gonna accept him any time
                           are they?
None (KBXPS000)            [1408] That's right so they, they weren't liable
                           anyway
Donald (PS1DW)             [1409] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1410] a complete destruction
Donald (PS1DW)             [1411] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1412] like er according to the, the, the scripture,
                           the son of destruction which, I don't know whether
                           it points towards Judas Iscariot of being one of
                           the, the sons of destruction.
Donald (PS1DW)             [1413] Yeah, I think what you meaning before like,
                           before Jesus' time, in
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1414] that's the description isn't it?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1415] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1416] And it says the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1417] conscious that they will die
None (KBXPS000)            [1418] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1419] but as for the dead they have conscious of
                           nothing at all
None (KBXPS000)            [1420] Mm, you've got to bear in mind that it is
                           actually erm ... it isn't something you can take for
                           granted, it is something that is a given thing and
                           that er, it can be taken away, that's the main
                           thing, but
Donald (PS1DW)             [1421] This knowledge that be true
None (KBXPS000)            [1422] but mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1423] you can lose it but you can't guess
None (KBXPS000)            [1424] Can't guess , yeah that's true
Donald (PS1DW)             [1425] That's right, so as we mentioned it exert
                           yourselves vigorously
None (KBXPS000)            [1426] Mm, in other words it isn't an automatic
                           immortal soul that you've got
Donald (PS1DW)             [1427] No
None (KBXPS000)            [1428] it's still taken it, it's something that's
                           external
Donald (PS1DW)             [1429] n naturally yes, that's er, that's er kitchen
                           of maturity isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1430] Because you see
Donald (PS1DW)             [1431] I mean the soul, what is the soul?
None (KBXPS000)            [1432] the soul is the whole inside into us mainly
Donald (PS1DW)             [1433] The man himself
None (KBXPS000)            [1434] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1435] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1436] you couldn't actually have separate parts
Donald (PS1DW)             [1437] No, that's right, it's no shadowy thing that
                           leaves, leaves er body there
None (KBXPS000)            [1438] Besides
Donald (PS1DW)             [1439] does it?
                           [1440] Soul is the man
None (KBXPS000)            [1441] the only thing that makes you conscious of
                           what's going on is your brain and that anyway
Donald (PS1DW)             [1442] Mm
None (KBXPS000)            [1443] is your faculties that know, if there was
                           something that went out it wouldn't be conscious
                           would it, it'd be unconscious, so you wouldn't
                           actually be conscious, you're conscious is your
                           brain working with your body, working with your mind
                           and everything, it's, that's why you're conscious,
                           when you're
Donald (PS1DW)             [1444] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1445] unconscious there might be something that
                           goes out some breath
Donald (PS1DW)             [1446] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1447] but that won't be conscious, you'll be
                           unconscious
Donald (PS1DW)             [1448] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1449] so that won't be conscious of anything, you
                           need eyes to see and to be conscious
Donald (PS1DW)             [1450] That's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1451] with your eyes closed you can't see
Donald (PS1DW)             [1452] Yes you, you need
None (KBXPS000)            [1453] so your breath
Donald (PS1DW)             [1454] your senses don't we?
None (KBXPS000)            [1455] That's right, your breath can't see in other
                           words
Donald (PS1DW)             [1456] No
None (KBXPS000)            [1457] your spirit can't actually see, it's blind
                           isn't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1458] That's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1459] If you're unconscious and you can't actually
                           physically see
Donald (PS1DW)             [1460] Yes that's right
None (KBXPS000)            [1461] so if there was something that went out you
                           wouldn't actually to be able to physically see where
                           [laugh] where you're going
Donald (PS1DW)             [1462] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1463] What they're getting mixed up with is the
                           mortal soul with it, is that when they're using
                           their imagination
Donald (PS1DW)             [1464] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1465] when you use your imagination you can imagine
                           that you're somewhere else can't you?
                           [1466] And they believe that's another eye as it
                           were, towards their spirit which they think's, you
                           know it's a middle eye of, of
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1467] knowledge that they be
Donald (PS1DW)             [1468] That's right, yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1469] at the end of the day once your eyes are shut
                           like that you've only, you've only got your
                           imagination haven't you left?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1470] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1471] And they think because they've got that
                           imagination while they're living it will still be
                           there when, when we got, this is man's thinking
                           again ain't it?
                           [1472] It, this is
Donald (PS1DW)             [1473] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1474] where they got their beliefs from, from them
                           thinking, you know, they've mixed men's thinking
                           with, with biologies and things ain't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1475] Yeah
None (KBXPS000)            [1476] Philosophy and things
Donald (PS1DW)             [1477] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1478] mm, erm the immortal soul belief is not a
                           physical belief, it's something that's being had
                           from, from guesswork from them
Donald (PS1DW)             [1479] Well they
None (KBXPS000)            [1480] made a guess haven't you?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1481] well for it's, it's a
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1482] isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1483] You've guessed in a way haven't you?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1484] Mm
None (KBXPS000)            [1485] So it's not a bit er, it's not something
                           that's automatic?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1486] No ...
None (KBXPS000)            [1487] To tell a child that he was automatically
                           going to heaven, would not be biblical
Donald (PS1DW)             [1488] No of course not
None (KBXPS000)            [1489] because it's not the way ... that er it was
                           designed for it, it was designed for something in
                           which men pressed forward to
Donald (PS1DW)             [1490] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1491] wasn't it?
                           [1492] It wasn't something that the child
                           automatically got
Donald (PS1DW)             [1493] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1494] those that haven't, are less fortunate than
                           that, there must be something either for them or
                           that they were going to heaven wasn't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1495] That's right, yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1496] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1497] yes some will make it the earth, but then
                           again some will vanish
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1498] altogether
None (KBXPS000)            [1499] Mhm that's right, yeah they will be
Donald (PS1DW)             [1500] All those who call on the name of Jehovah
                           will be saved
None (KBXPS000)            [1501] It's a matter of having that faith, that
                           should be Jehovah in Romans chapter ten, verse
                           thirteen, it's a matter of working out ... to, for
                           logic of the original verse which it came from, cos
                           that's been quoted hasn't it?
                           [1502] The apostle there that wrote that letter has
                           quoted a verse from somewhere out of the Hebrew
                           hasn't he?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1503] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1504] He must of done, cos that's what they were
                           using, they were using the Hebrew scriptures to, to
                           quote on weren't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1505] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1506] So if you can go back to the original Hebrew
                           of that particular verse then you'll find out how
                           it's meant to be said, because a normal bible vision
                           wouldn't read God's in there, it would read equals
                           and the name of the Lord, will be saved you see
Donald (PS1DW)             [1507] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1508] that's the way most bible verse is today,
                           really want it
Donald (PS1DW)             [1509] Yes, that's it
None (KBXPS000)            [1510] if they would be very difficult to get
                           through to somebody the truth
Donald (PS1DW)             [1511] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1512] and that's the, that's come from the Hebrew
                           that particular thing
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1513] er yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1514] Mm, that's erm quoted from [...] won't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1515] erm?
None (KBXPS000)            [1516] two is it?
                           [1517] I don't know where that particular one
Donald (PS1DW)             [1518] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1519] It was, I think on the cross reference where
                           it's er quoted from yes it's yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1520] Mm
None (KBXPS000)            [1521] , two thirty two ... that's where that cross
                           reference comes from you see
Donald (PS1DW)             [1522] mm
None (KBXPS000)            [1523] cos if you think about it, the apostle source
                           was the Hebrew scripture'=s that was their source
                           wasn't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1524] That's right and then yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1525] What do you , so you've got to really refer
                           to the Hebrew to find the truth haven't you?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1526] Yes, I, and then I mean when the
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1527] apostles, erm, then Jesus came on the scene,
                           but, he was their source as well as the scriptures
                           there
None (KBXPS000)            [1528] Mm, that's right, yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1529] Mm ...
None (KBXPS000)            [1530] It's like a combination isn't it?
                           [1531] In fact the what, they found out the sacred
                           secret, that's enlightened them to the Hebrew though
Donald (PS1DW)             [1532] Mm ...
None (KBXPS000)            [1533] Sorry watch that [laugh]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1534] Forty five minutes left on here, mm
None (KBXPS000)            [1535] [laugh] Yeah but, like you say that the ...
                           to find, to find out the real truth you have to
                           refer to Hebrew anyway because they found out the
                           sacred secret of God didn't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1536] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1537] But also the, the being inferred to, that
                           enlightened them on the Hebrew didn't it?
                           [1538] It must of enlightened them on what the
                           scriptures meant, by the sacred secret, cos before
                           it must of been some kind of weird mystery to them
Donald (PS1DW)             [1539] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1540] all of it must, but all of a sudden Jesus
                           came along and then enlightened their minds to the
                           scriptures so they are inspired again to write the
                           Christian
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1541] scriptures then aren't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1542] Oh, that they knew er something of the Hebrew
                           scriptures because they were expecting the Messiah
                           weren't they?
None (KBXPS000)            [1543] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1544] They were look they were waiting for him,
                           they were looking for him ... they were expecting
                           him
None (KBXPS000)            [1545] Mm, one er scripture which I always find very
                           interesting is Hebrews chapter twelve, verse twenty
                           two ... look at that one ...
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1546] twenty two?
None (KBXPS000)            [1547] Mm, what he's talking about is the old
                           covenant was to do with the mountain wasn't it?
                           [1548] ... And it was fearsome
Donald (PS1DW)             [1549] Yes

Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1551] then it says to the, [reading] the apostles
                           that they'd approached a Mount Zion and a city of a

None (KBXPS000)            [1552] and millions of angels and also a general

                           have been enrolled in the heavens and also go with

                           who have been made perfect [] , now, see most bible
                           versions don't use that spiritual there, [reading]
                           they render it as spirit lives the brightest ones
                           who have been made perfect [] , now is that verse
                           they're talking about the apostles then ... reaching

                           heaven, in other words, the, the, you know that the
                           understanding which I have it from this bible is er
                           that seems to be suggesting that er that's talking
                           about apos the apostles' lives before they died,

None (KBXPS000)            [1555] in other words I'm trying to work out why
                           this is spiritual lives and not spiritual lives you
                           know there must be some reason why
Donald (PS1DW)             [1556] Well a person can be, ever, these are the
                           difference between a spirit

Donald (PS1DW)             [1558] person or a spirit being shall we say, not a
                           person, a spirit being and a spiritual being, see,
                           you can have a human being which is, who is
                           spiritual can't you?
None (KBXPS000)            [1559] Mhm see that's what I'm trying to get at
                           whether that's
Donald (PS1DW)             [1560] Spiritual lives, we can have spiritual lives
None (KBXPS000)            [1561] Mm , mm we could, but if, but if that ends
                           there, referring to the people on the earth or the
                           people on the heaven ... or the
Donald (PS1DW)             [1562] Nah
None (KBXPS000)            [1563] spirits in the heaven, you know what I mean,
                           you know what I'm trying to say?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1564] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1565] Is that verse there referring to the ones
                           that have spiritual lives on the earth or the ones
                           that already in, in the, the heaven with the spirit
                           lives in there, you know what I mean?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1566] Yes, oh and speaking entrentically about the
                           congregation of the firstborn
None (KBXPS000)            [1567] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1568] will
None (KBXPS000)            [1569] we haven't enrolled in the heavens you see
Donald (PS1DW)             [1570] Yes so, the bit, it'll be part of the
                           heavenly kingdom
None (KBXPS000)            [1571] Mm, see they, they'd actually approached all
                           this, they've approached it haven't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1572] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1573] Some bibles say that, that they've come to
                           this, at the end of the day, they hadn't quite, had
                           it at that point anyway, cos they'd approached it
                           cos they were still alive weren't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1574] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1575] So the correct
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
None (KBXPS000)            [1576] is to approach that
Donald (PS1DW)             [1577] Yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1578] you know what I mean, they haven't actually
                           got that yet because they were still alive at this
                           point here weren't they?
                           [1579] So he's explained that this is what they've
                           approached the heavenly Jerusalem
Donald (PS1DW)             [1580] But yes
None (KBXPS000)            [1581] you know
Donald (PS1DW)             [1582] but er, you know these united ones on the
                           earth today, righteousness
None (KBXPS000)            [1583] Mm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1584] has [...] before they go to heaven,account
None (KBXPS000)            [1585] Mhm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1586] already accounted to them isn't it?
None (KBXPS000)            [1587] Mm, see this is a very difficult one to
                           understand, it takes a lot of er working out, you
                           see ... then he's also applied, approached the city
                           you see which is called the same thing isn't it?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1588] Mhm
None (KBXPS000)            [1589] Also it's called another thing, heavenly
                           Jerusalem with millions of angels in general
                           assembly and the congregation of the first one which
                           is the first fruits aren't they?
*** 8 (Tape 058703) ***
Donald (PS1DW)             [1590] There could be no doubt in the mind of John
                           that Jesus had been sent by God. ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1591] So what happened when Jesus was thirty years
                           old?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1592] Erm ... he erm, he ha he went to John the
                           Baptist to baptize, to ask him to be baptized ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1593] Yeah that's right, very good, so nine,
                           [reading] by pouring out this holy spirit and Jesus,
                           Jehovah was er knighting him or appointing him to be
                           the king of this coming kingdom, thing thus have
                           anointed with the spirit, Jesus became the Messiah
                           [] , which words in the Hebrew and Greek languages
                           mean appoint, a anointed, therefore he became in
                           fact Jesus Christ or Jesus the United, so, so it was
                           Apostle Peter spoke of Jesus who was from Nazareth,
                           Nazareth, how about anointed them, but all the
                           spirit and power, also by his baptism and water,
                           Jesus was presenting himself to God, to carry out
                           the work that God had sent him to earth to do, what
                           was that important work?
                           [1594] So mine asks when did Jesus in fact become
                           Christ?
                           [1595] And why then? ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1596] Er, when he was baptized ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1597] And Peter says by his baptism what was Jesus
                           presented himself to do?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1598] To do er ... God's will, erm ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1599] Yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1600] with read it here, hmm
Donald (PS1DW)             [1601] That's right as you say
Donald (PS1DW)             [1602] Yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1603] So [clears throat] when a person gets
                           baptized then, what, what, they're dedicating
                           themselves to do God's will aren't they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1604] Yes, to carry out God's work, yes
Donald (PS1DW)             [1605] Were you, have, have you been baptized?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1606] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [1607] When you was a baby?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1608] Oh when I was a baby yes of course, yes
Donald (PS1DW)             [1609] So when you were a little baby [clears
                           throat] did you dedicate yourself to do God's will
                           then?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1610] No you're not capable are you?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1611] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [1612] Er
Donald (PS1DW)             [1613] [clears throat] So just for us you don't even
                           know what God's will is do you?
                           [1614] When
Donald (PS1DW)             [1615] No er
Donald (PS1DW)             [1616] you're a baby
Donald (PS1DW)             [1617] That's right
Donald (PS1DW)             [1618] and er
Donald (PS1DW)             [1619] There's something as well, er, er in baptism
                           isn't there really?
                           [1620] Godparents, these state that you should keep
                           them on the straight and narrow
Donald (PS1DW)             [laugh]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1621] I mean you can't guarantee that
Donald (PS1DW)             [1622] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [1623] can they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1624] and then again ... did Jesus have godparents?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1625] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [1626] No, I mean if the parents can't keep children
                           under straight and narrow
Donald (PS1DW)             [1627] That's right, yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1628] and don't and particularly these days they
                           don't go, seem to have all that much interest in
                           doing so do they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1629] No no, not at all
Donald (PS1DW)             [1630] So grandparents are probably even less
                           interested, you know
Donald (PS1DW)             [1631] Yeah
Donald (PS1DW)             [1632] so
Donald (PS1DW)             [1633] All the same as in my case, I mean [laugh] I
                           erm, er my aunt, my aunt travelled to, to
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1634] like to look after my mother, er she was one,
                           and she died now erm she died two years ago, I think
                           she was one of the first to go and er, the other one
                           they fetched him out of the street the chap ... then
                           they corresponded with him up to the war [laugh]
                           but, but after that, they, I don't know whether they
                           stopped writing because of the war, I don't know,
                           but they never, never got in touch with them never
                           again so
Donald (PS1DW)             [1635] So that's when you were born?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1636] Yes when, when I was baptized
Donald (PS1DW)             [1637] How old where you when you were baptized?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1638] yeah, when I was baptized , she probably
                           stayed there till I was baptized, cos she would of
                           been Yorkie
Donald (PS1DW)             [1639] Somebody they just fetched out of the street?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1640] and they fetched somebody out of the street,
                           this was, this was in er Worcester this was
Donald (PS1DW)             [1641] To be er, godparents?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1642] To be er to, yeah to be me godparents,
                           checking
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1643] how, how serious do you think this chap would
                           take that duty, you know ...
Donald (PS1DW)             [1644] Well
Donald (PS1DW)             [1645] just just grabbed out of the street
Donald (PS1DW)             [1646] I think when they lived there they used to
                           meet regularly, cos erm, I suppose Worcester,
                           Worcester in November
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1647] Aye, people were more serious in them days
                           than they are now aren't they?
                           [1648] Take things more serious
Donald (PS1DW)             [1649] Er, yes, yes this was like nineteen twenty
                           eight years old
Donald (PS1DW)             [1650] Yes
Donald (PS1DW)             [1651] Yeah, they would be er erm, I think they
                           would, would be more like er, see of course when we
                           came back here to Stoke [laugh] er I mean that
                           severed relations with them so to speak apart from
                           like say letters, they did use, used to write I
                           remember getting letters and we'd send letters,
                           perhaps only twice a year, but I can remember them
                           mentioning.
Donald (PS1DW)             [1652] So regards to your upbringing they wouldn't,
                           they discuss [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1653] No, my, my aunt was in York, we used to see
                           her once a year, Christmas, she used to come
Donald (PS1DW)             [1654] Very good that, so, the next
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1655] why he came to earth?
                           [1656] Er before we go into er, this next summary,
                           have you any ideas yourself why Jesus came to the
                           earth?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1657] Well I think probably it was such a bad
                           place, putting, come to try and show a little light,
                           proper way to live and

Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1684] says [reading] explaining why he had come to
                           earth Jesus told the Roman governor Pontius Pilate,
                           will thus I've been born and for this purpose I have
                           come out of the world that I should bear witness to
                           the truth, but what particular truth was Jesus sent
                           to earth to make no man, first just about his
                           heavenly father, he taught his followers to pray
                           that his father name be hallowed or hell holy and he
                           prayed, I have made your name manifest to the man
                           you gave me [] , also he said [reading] I must
                           declare the good news with the kingdom of God,
                           because for this I was sent forth [] , so what
                           truths did Jesus come to er, to tell?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1685] Er, truth about his heavenly father, erm ...
                           taught his followers to, his father's name be heard
                           how holy
Donald (PS1DW)             [1686] What did he [...] [dog barking]
*** 9 (Tape 058704) ***
Donald (PS1DW)             [1687] How important could you from this work of
                           making known this father's name and kingdom, he said
                           to his disciples [reading] my food is for me to do
                           the will of him that sent me and to finish his work
                           [] why did Jesus consider God's work to be as
                           important as school?
                           [1688] It was because the kingdom there's the means
                           by which God will fulfil his wonderful purposes for
                           mankind, for humankind, it is this kingdom that will
                           destroy all wickedness and will clear Jehovah's name
                           of the reproach that has been brought upon it.
                           [1689] So Jesus never held back for making known
                           God's name and kingdom.
                           [1690] He always spoke the truth whether it was
                           popular or not, he lo loves provided an example and
                           we should follow if we want to please God.
Donald (PS1DW)             [1691] Why did Jesus consider his work so important?
                           [1692] ... My food is
Donald (PS1DW)             [1693] My food is for me to do the will of him that
                           sent me
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1694] yes, without little food nobody can live can
                           they?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1695] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [1696] And yet Jesus felt that it was ju equally
                           important as having food
Donald (PS1DW)             [1697] Yes
Donald (PS1DW)             [1698] think about this kingdom and to finish his
                           work, do not, you will, while eat a lot you know
                           what he meant by finishes his work
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1699] so erm, we ask, what did Jesus never hold
                           back on doing?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1700] and so what should we do?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1701] Well er, you never hold er, you always
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1702] the truth ... erm, oh you never, never hold
                           back and make be known in God's name the kingdom, he
                           always told the truth whether it was popular or not,
                           that's really, so erm ... come on you, are you going
                           out with Clare, come on, hey, come on, come on Pip,
                           go on, go on
Donald (PS1DW)             [1703] We've just got this one paragraph, before we
                           go to the next sub-heading erm, then we'll close
                           there shall we?
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1704] yes make it possible first to gain
                           everlasting life under the rule of God's kingdom,
                           Jesus had to pour out his
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1705] as two apostles of Jesus said [reading] we've
                           been declared righteous now by his word, the boy of
                           Jesus God's son []
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [1706] Come here then
Donald (PS1DW)             [1707] so an important reason why Jesus came to
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [1708] Pip
Donald (PS1DW)             [1709] was to die for us, he said as soon as man
                           came not to be ministered to, but to minister and to
                           give his soul for life, as a ransom in exchange for
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1710] but what does it mean that Jesus Christ stake
                           his life for a ransom, why was pulling out
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1711] was necessary for our salvation but the
                           question asks what, [reading] for what, what other
                           important reasons did Jesus come to earth []
Donald (PS1DW)             [1712] Erm ... oh er, to clear us all of sin
Donald (PS1DW)             [1713] Yeah ... how, how would he do that?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1714] Oh erm, by blood, by the blood in Jesus
Donald (PS1DW)             [1715] In other words
Donald (PS1DW)             [1716] God's son, all our sons the same
Donald (PS1DW)             [1717] And what would Jesus have to do for that?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1718] Die
Donald (PS1DW)             [1719] Er can explain er why, you know, why would he
                           have to die?
                           [1720] To cleanse us from sin, what type of sins in
                           particular in the, would he be cleansing as at?
                           [1721] ... Would you
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1722] the paragraph?
Donald (PS1DW)             [1723] Erm, no, erm definitely erm I'll go with
                           salvation
Donald (PS1DW)             [1724] Yes
Donald (PS1DW)             [1725] erm, when we've done wrong repent and
Donald (PS1DW)             [1726] Erm well if yes erm ... yes, but er there's
                           another reason as well, there's another reason, we
                           can't save the souls can we?
                           [1727] By any means
Donald (PS1DW)             [1728] Oh no no
Donald (PS1DW)             [1729] so how, how was it that Jesus saves us and
                           had he, he'd got to die for us, what, couldn't he
                           save us without dying because his death was, wasn't
                           very nice by any means
Donald (PS1DW)             [1730] No
Donald (PS1DW)             [1731] so why did he have to die? ...
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1732] who, who was it that brought down the human
                           race? ...

Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [1786] To be perfectly honest Don I think you, you
                           should retain the television, but you should
                           restrict too with the regard to your use of it
Donald (PS1DW)             [1787] Well, yeah that would be probably the best,
                           yes ... you know, I know what it
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1788] like, I might make a determined effort, but I

                           come to any harm not having it, and erm I've just
                           got to get rid of this because it's, I'd do a lot
                           more Eric if it weren't for the television, I know
                           I'll miss it when I get rid of it you see, it has
                           been described as a plug-in drug

Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1792] all well and good, but for twenty year, we
                           shouldn't be talking about this, when I was in
                           Ireland ... a couple of years ago the skew over
                           overseer said he had to get rid of his television
                           for the same reason, he er couldn't turn it up

Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1797] a television
Unknown speaker (KBXPSUNK) [...]
Donald (PS1DW)             [1798] you see with me living on my own for such a
                           long time now, erm ... it seems er ... it seemed to
