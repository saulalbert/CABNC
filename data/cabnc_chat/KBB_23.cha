*ART:	Will it be always like that then?
*EVE:	Oh no!It should go back.
*ART:	Does Marge ever say
*EVE:	No, she said she gets arthritis in hers   (.) and I expect that's what it is with mine.Cos I got a bit before when
*ART:	More like it's the aftermath of the break.
*EVE:	It probably has   (        ) it.It's the only thing I can say   (.) and I think

*ART:	Oh!Never bothered to do it, there's plenty of other clocks to look at.
*EVE:	I know, but   (.) cos I, I think our bedroom and bathroom clocks are    (.)  (        ) 
*ART:	Tell me what this one is compared to Madge's?I could tell you.
*EVE:	This is   (.) one thirty four.
*ART:	This is one   (.) about wo , er one thirty three in the  (        ) .That clock's right then.
*EVE:	Oh what about that then!Yeah. (.) You must have altered it.
*ART:	I know most things obtrusively.
*EVE:	Ooh!
*ART:	Which you never give me credit for. (.) Have to do all the scenery 
*EVE:	Well done!
*ART:	but I never pushed in and stood on the stage, look I've done all this!
