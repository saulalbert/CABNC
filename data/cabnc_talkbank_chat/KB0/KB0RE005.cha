*PS009:	Knowing Martin what John has just told me about him if I did n't know him I do n't think it would me anything Brief details like that are meaningless I trust the Ministerial Committee to make decisions and bring recommendations On the other hand I would like to meet the candidates to see what they look like But that does n't apa but what they look like is not going to affect whether I support the Ministerial Committee or not .  1021355_1051435

*PS009:	at the time Shall we remember and these three friends in life Lord we thank you for the ways in which you challenge and call people to all forms of ministry within the light of your church And especially we thank you today for the call of Martin and Ian and Richard to the Ministry of Word and Sacrament within the light of your church We pray for them and their families We pray for them in their studies In their pilgrimage to discover more of your presence in their lives As they begin a particular stage of the ministry we also pray for those who are coming towards the end of that particular stage of the ministry Remember especially Bob and Roy and we pray that you will enable them to find fulfilment and enjoyment and enrichment in their lives as they step forward in faith and confidence in Lord in your mercy .  1288744_1370060
*KB0PSUN:	Amen .  1371150_1371440
*PS009:	Amen Reports are not always about revolutions and that 's important And you will see that we now have a good erm Well over to Noel to relax with each other thoughts questions comments about the life of the ministry of the church And happens some people have prepared particular presentations you will see after one is on and one of political insubordination one on the process of learning together Five districts have erm prepared some of vision in order to share that vision or that example of what is happening in the districts relating to the ministry erm with the and those who have come to us as well And one church has prepared a little presentation or mind-stretching heart-stretching thought of church and community So we 're we 're here now to relax To talk about the Ministry of Office I think in starting this off I would like to encourage as many people to take place in conversation if possible And I will include in that those who are younger than most of us here Er to talk about what you think about the ministry of the church as well We 're talking about this partly because of the document passed in the ministry in which everybody has avidly read and erm has been talked about after the seventeenth er in York in July But I think the more important reason for talking about the Ministry of the New Church or the Ministry of the Church is because of the erm developing needs and the developing thoughts and ideas which are actually additions which are the the crucial area where ministry takes place First of all I think it would be useful if we were clear that with the new ministry was a waste Too often we are limited in thinking of ministry as those who either do or do not work where are thought of And we might call those Ministers if you like with a big M Erm but we 'll be talking about the Ministry of the Church We 're actually talking about I mean if you remember this we 're talking about the absinity of the body of Christ That is the Ministry of the Church But each one that 's here however old or however young are a part an active part an essential part a crucial part of the Ministry of the Body of Christ We are these And how we relate within the church and how we relate outside the church although in essence there is nothing outside the church there is nothing that that position Okay As you look into your shaving mirror in the morning you shall say hello Minister how are you Or as you look into your drawer in the morning to find out what you need to put into your hand bag in the day you say hello Minister how are you Okay That 's We 're also talking in terms of a ministry which what you expect is very often what you get you 're trained to be somebody okay And one of the things that these trainings help you is that if you expect something of a child then you 're much more likely to get it That way it 's positive If you expect that child is going to do a fantastic job on that painting then that encouragement and confidence is coming across It also works negatively If you do n't expect much from little Tommy then little Tommy is less and less likely to give you anything much So we 're talking about ministry We 're talking about something which is bound by our expectations We need to be aware of our expectations because our expectations can be limiting and can be stretching and inspiring We also are exercising the Ministry of the Church within a context We 've learnt something about the church and One of the contexts in which we are exercising ministry is that we have for the last fifty years well I have n't personally But for the last fifty years or so for most of us the experience of the church has been declined and closer and reducing number of people with dog collars Okay There have been negative interference We need to be aware of how those can actually triple the numbers We need to be aware of how we are subconsciously taught A Geographer knows that and the whole environment importance A Geographer also knows that in order to use maps you need to know where you are You ca n't get anywhere without knowing where we are Half of our exercise in listening to each other is to know where we are In order that we can begin to recognise the movements and the visions and the views of where we can be Knowing where we are in terms of the way in which we are tricked into having bad Knowing where we are in the way in which we are tricked into believing that erm our churches now are weaker than when they were founded and probably most of you many of you have heard my children 's prayer .  1371440_1812720
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS009:	the children are the difference between churches now and churches in the past Especially at church anniversaries And nine times out of ten when I ask the congregation whether your church is bigger now than it was when it was founded nine times out of ten the congregation say it is smaller now than when it was founded And nine point nine times out of ten they are wrong We 've got a wrong false image of the And that is harmful And it 's parallel Those visions come from within ourselves Come from the way in which we do n't necessarily take on board what we are learning They come also from orgasmic enters or whatever such programmes there are go around these days .  1812730_1871990

*PS009:	There 's also the whole of notion of what we are saying by our ministry together Okay What we are what we are saying by our buildings .  1896230_1904790
*KB0PSUN:	sort of ended in a little .  1905490_1906700
*PS009:	What we are saying by our notice boards Many of which are still in action What we are saying by our commitment or our attitude What we are saying by the way in which we share what we are saying by our commitment to justice and peace All of these are involved and a part of our ministry And that again might be me but many of you when you 've heard me say it in a service I 've ended up with my asking at the end of a sermon asking the congregation to smile Now you know that 's how many of you I have I done that to .  1906770_1949790
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS009:	Well that that may be a reflection on me okay But what are we saying by our expressions both within worship and outside And of course our discussion of ministry ie the activity of the people of God is not just a domestic thing about the urc I mean we we get bound up with with all sorts of domestic things and will I expect later today But it 's also erm about discovering the completeness of the ministry of the people of God as we enter through the various commitments that we have to our sister churches in Wales and in Britain and in the world whether it 's routine or a particular relationship of members or All that 's part of the context of the ways in which we 're talking about and sharing with each other with God Please smile .  1950980_2017670

*PS009:	There is a list here three major 's presentations on communion on political insubordination and on the pilgrimage of learning together I think what we 'll do is hear each of those three presentations and then I will allow a time for comment especially discussion after each I will limit that to make sure we get time for all so that 's that 's the way we 're going to do it .  2017850_2054390
*KB0PSUN:	Thank you .  2054390_2054770

*PS004:	Nannette the Minister of the United Reform Church in Merthyr also sharing the ministry with the Presbyterian Church of Wales in Merthyr and Merthyr Vale Thank you John for that introduction I remember John coming to Merthyr and asking the young people to find see if there was anybody who was over a hundred in the congregation .  2072675_2094835

*PS004:	In preparing ours for today and the whole question of thinking of being main precedency of communion rests in our understanding erm of ordination which I know later we we will have time to discuss But may I ask yo of you a question not for answers but will erm perhaps come later in the debate and that is what does the service of Holy Communion mean to you Our answers will get crushed But one thing that I would share with you and it 's this is that whenever the friends of Jesus eat and drink together they remember him his sacrificial love for them and the wonderful gift of freedom that he has made possible I 'll say at the outset that Holy Communion is not something that we play about with Our communion service is part of the rich tradition which has been passed down to us from Jesus Christ But having sa said that I have to share with you the a key element er in the life of the church has been the ordained Ministry of Word and Sacrament and pastoral care And there is no intention to dispense with this kind of service But concern is expressed in the number of jobs that the perfect minister is expected to do I stand here I am not a perfect minister because I am over forty I 've got children that are not too awkward but erm could be awkward and I have n't a spouse ah and ah I stand here saying that I 'm not good at everything I 'm good with young people I 'm not o only good with old people I try to do my best We know the picture of a perfect minister but we there is a challenge to relief ministers to do the work that they are called to do This will lead to a long deba debate But it is it seems from this report that is in front of us that it is now appropriate for the urc to take a new step with regard to the local ministry of elders Already this morning the question has been asked about providing elders And it is that each local church of whatever sign should be invited to nominate from amongst their elder division those elders who district council might consider and recognise as dividing elders for a stated period of years with authority to do provide them all services of worship and meetings of that local church as the need arises And this has been suggested the same thing the understanding that we have now of special authorization which obviously does n't work The reasons for looking at this change and I quote the reports the the ways the district council interpret the existing clause about provi precedency is the district council ah interpret in very different ways A second thing is that a co is it right that a company of people should be deprived of a sacrament because an ordained minister is not available Remembering the words of Jesus that where two or three are gathered together The third thing that the re the report says is that there is no magical element about sacraments But sacrament has everything to do with the grace of God and the faith of the church And this proposal is seen lastly as developing local leadership The proposal is that presiding elders and whether proposal is the right word but the suggestion that presiding elders be appointed following our conviction that every local church should have regular sacramental worship with presiding with people presiding being allowed Can I close by saying that every time Christians share the Lord 's supper they are publicly declaring their needs to be fed with the living bread and wine What does the holy communion what the Lord 's supper mean to you .  2111375_2444325
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS009:	and our visitors from other churches are also welcome to join in in any discussion or comments And any more for those who feel like it there 's provision for .  2444325_2457545

*PS009:	Anyone who 's visiting from other churches And we lack provisions that allows for a presidency in the absence of a minister is a good one as long as it is monitored closely by district council And be that there no magical erm like you which I agree there is a mystical Like it is n't you know that the Eucharist er the the the communion is very central to our worship and having had ten years working at the Navy that was an eye opener and deepening of my own spiritual awareness in the as in the sanctity that I got the sacrament and how other churches see it and er helped to create a very affirm at the very centre of my own if you like pilgrimage What had abhorred me in the past and sometimes er perhaps arrive and been to the church and say oh by the way it 's communion And have that sprung on me I I I I I feel terrible because the communion service i is is something I have to prepare for in myself and obviously shape the whole se se service around it And I think we need to heighten sharpen our awareness of erm what I understand by communion and er er also to er to remember that the injunction of Paul as he was you know that I have received of the Lord at which I deliver unto you Those words of execution as we continue to read them There 's a severe warning against those who ca n't do it in a spirit of of of lardiness and and not discerning to the body and and and the will of Christ Perhaps that needs to be reminded about them But they sho er er er it 's good to have and sharing it but I but I but I I personally feel as long as it 's well monitored within the within the district council in the event of a minister not being able to be there then er a reco er som a recognised person to .  2457655_2578605

*PS004:	Yep .  2610215_2610435
*KB0PSUN:	Erm oh yes my next question was er what is holy communion I 'd like to re-phrase the question what is holy in communion .  2610525_2624175
*KB0PSUN:	Okay well I mean .  2624175_2624725
*KB0PSUN:	do we say what is holy in communion we then recognise that it 's not what but who who is holy in communion okay The holy as in communion to me is a who not a what Okay And I think that debate er between the the tradition and and the the and and er Roman Catholic traditions you know i er this business of elevating the host and and substantiation so the elements themselves that that it become holy alright And then it 's a kind of a what you know It 's the body of a what and the blood as a what .  2624725_2664155
*KB0PSUN:	Have you read .  2664155_2665635
*KB0PSUN:	But that 's not it And that 's not what Paul meant when he said the body of a what He meant who That is holy And who is holy Jesus Christ Alright You wanted it and that 's it When two or three are doubted they 're wrong So what 's the who That 's the holy to me And the other who of holy is the Saint I 'm making this point because I think that we can get really to verify .  2665645_2693395
*KB0PSUN:	You 're always going on about .  2693395_2695865
*KB0PSUN:	You know this whole of idea of things and ritual being the holy and that things in the ritual there yes there are sacred symbols and they need to be handled in that that that sense of sacredness but the that which makes them sacred is the person our Lord and us in communion with him and with each other and it seems to me that wherever that happens there is sacrament Wherever that happens there is holy communion Even if the elements are n't even present Okay But I think I think those elements are important otherwise Jesus would n't have made a point of it .  2696365_2741255
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS003:	David East Wales Can I clarify please what exactly we are talking about here Because the do document Patterns of Ministry does not talk about lay presidency It talks about the presidency of ordained people Elders who are ordained Now I rather wish it was talking about lay presidency and I would go along with Nannette on the question of a lay person presiding in communion Ecumenical dynamite I know But I think we need to be clear whether we are talking about ordained or lay people and further on in the discussion whether we can indeed justify that division .  2741255_2798235
*KB0PSUN:	How can try and allow an elder as an ordained minister of the free people Can I say that need holy communion as a group thing in a way of our communion and as a church we are going to be Roman Catholic It is the community as a an affirmation of the community and to say that we need to have an outsider in to do that because there is not an ordained minister there to me is a little like the situation in some Anglican Parishes where there 's a woman sitting .
