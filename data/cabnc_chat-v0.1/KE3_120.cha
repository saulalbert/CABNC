*TON:	Oh Brian annoyed me on my lesson  I pulled up to the Kingsway  right? •221073_221527•
        And I was wanting to turn left •221886_222102•
*JAC:	Yeah. •222297_222314•
*TON:	going along the Kingsway coming back from the the driving test centre •222333_222773•
*JAC:	Oh I know. •222783_222865•
*TON:	yeah? •222928_222934•
*JAC:	Yeah. •222934_222940•
*TON:	And there's a filter light  and he said oh you'll be waiting here ages put it in neutral  just as  •222940_223710•
*JAC:	. •_•
*TON:	just as I did it the bloody filter light came on •223710_224043•
*JAC:	Yeah  he's silly  •224050_224157•
*TON:	and you oh  •224157_224254•
*JAC:	I don't know why he makes you do that  I mean it's  if that was something I mean all Tony used to ever say when we were at traffic lights were  if you want to  you can put the handbrake on at this set of traffic lights  if they were downhill •224254_226187•
*TON:	Mhm. •226384_226404•
*JAC:	because erm  there will be  oh what was I it's alright I was concentrating  said you can put the handbrake on these set of traffic lights if you like  because you might be sat here a while and your foot will ache  you know? •226412_228263•
*TON:	Good grief  I always have to put the handbrake on at traffic lights. •228265_228588•
*JAC:	No  he says it's a  Tony used to say to me it's entirely up to you  traffic lights coming up hill yes  but down hill  no it's  you needn't you can sit there ready with the foot brake. •228709_230058•
*TON:	Mm  yeah Brian's argument to that is  that er if you've got  if you were hit  in the back •230345_231322•
*JAC:	Yeah. •231379_231399•
*TON:	you would tend to raise your foot off the brake  sort of jump and take your foot off the brake and you'd go forward and hit the car in front. •231399_232341•
*JAC:	Well the handbrake is only a parking brake the handbrake only operates on two wheels in any case •232341_232812•
*TON:	Mm. •232911_232927•
*JAC:	not four  so the I mean the fact that you can drive with the handbrake on •232943_233345•
*TON:	yeah. •233471_233478•
*JAC:	if you're insistent about it  you know? •233485_233792•
*TON:	yeah. •233818_233840•
*JAC:	Erm tells you a lot it wouldn't erm  if somebody hit you in the back you'd still move if you had the handbrake on. •233932_234717•
*TON:	Yeah. •234756_234767•
*JAC:	In fact probably you'd move more  cos he says your instinct is take your feet off  I think your instinct would be to jump on it all the harder. •234772_235648•
*TON:	Mm. •236785_236810•
*JAC:	Cos the instinct would be to stop the car from moving. •236810_237205•
*TON:	Mm. •237400_237413•
*JAC:	If you see what I mean. •237418_237579•
*TON:	Yeah. •237661_237681•
*JAC:	No then I might be wrong I don't know  but all this  putting the car in neutral  goodness knows what! •237923_238497•
*TON:	It only makes you slower away. •238657_238836•
*JAC:	It does it just makes you slower getting away •238842_239026•
*TON:	Mm. •239026_239038•
*JAC:	and one of the things is that's important is  hesitancy •239038_239531•
*TON:	Mm. •239531_239537•
*JAC:	or and lack of it  . •239537_239711•
*TON:	But ha I remember I was on my test and I pulled round  er it was very, very busy and there were two rows of cars  and I pulled up  and I thought right there's a gap down there and I want to go straight on and all these others were turning turning right so I squeezed down through the gap  and then I thought right I'm gonna be here a little while shall I put it in neutral, blow no I won't. •240243_242984•
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	So given the  unless somebody's out  unless you're if he'd actually tells me to do it  I will say  I was sort of oh alright and do it. •243144_244065•
*JAC:	Yeah. •244216_244241•
*TON:	Yeah but  mm. •244658_245397•
*JAC:	No he he makes you do an awful lot of things that are really unnecessary. •245397_245781•
*TON:	Mm. •245781_245802•
*JAC:	Well I mean  I passed my test I weren't made to do any of that. •245903_246263•
*TON:	No. •246443_246453•
*JAC:	I would have thought how stupid it was  if I'd been made do it. •246453_246829•
*TON:	Mm. •246846_246864•
*JAC:	That's why I think I've said to you on occasions oh  you know  •246865_247155•
*TON:	Mm. •247256_247286•
*JAC:	what are you doing that for sort of thing. •247291_247526•
*TON:	Yeah. •247638_247642•
*JAC:	I bet your Mum's thinking we're not coming. •247653_248736•
*TON:	. •_•
*CHR:	Can Grandma sit at the back with me? •248828_249215•
*TON:	No I'll sit at the back. •249215_249541•
*JAC:	Well no let her sit at the front  now Christine  don't be  •249550_250957•
