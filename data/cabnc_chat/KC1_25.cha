@Comment:	conversation #25 (Tape 041005)
*FRA:	Yeah, the front just   (.) hinges off at the top.
*STE:	It's not at the back of the   (        ) here is it?
*FRA:	It mi , it may do, why?Have you spotted something?
*STE:	Dunno if it's the second one   (.) down that way or not, but there's a crack across there.Or is i is it a crack or a scratch? (.) This is the right one.
*FRA:	Yeah, that's the right one.Oh I'll get my   (.) magnifier. (.) Thing is, you're actually using, your eyes are not too good!
*STE:	Well I go  (.) get the magnifier to read the bloody   (.) magazine sometimes!It's ridiculous!I'm going back to the   (.) opticians with the , the new glasses I got are still flipping worse than these!
*FRA:	No, it's just a scratch I think. (.) Mm, somebody's been   (.) working on this though haven't they?The sound chip's in the wrong place.
*STE:	Crikey!Well this   (        ) is high enough!
*FRA:	Yeah, it's probably worth changing the control innit, to see what happens? (.) They've evidently looked   (.) you can see where they've scratched to get a screwdriver through there   (.) to try and get the sound   (.) the sound out.
*STE:	Couldn't you tell with the meter er   (.) th th th the control whether it's worth it or not?
*FRA:	Yeah, you should be able to.
*STE:	Yeah, but I don't think the   (.) it'll do what you want  (        ) .
*FRA:	Yeah, you'll have to.Mm!
*STE:	Want a se , want a screwdriver there?
*FRA:	I got one there, yeah.
*STE:	 (        ) ?
*FRA:	Yeah, I got one, yes.
*STE:	Gonna turn it as well?
*FRA:	Yeah.If you can   (.) oh, let's put it on.
*STE:	 (        ) around from one end to the other that is.
*FRA:	Yeah!Right!
*STE:	Right now   (.) one end to the other.
*FRA:	Is it?Oh!Go that way.
*STE:	No.
*FRA:	Well that's  (        ) .I'll get there eventually!That's not reading through anything that one.
*STE:	That won't read through  (        ) ?
*FRA:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] , I think so. (.) Now, one end is joined   (.) so   (.) a bit.Okay? (.) Nothing!
*STE:	No.
*FRA:	So it was circuit then.Just try the one above cos I think they're   (.) oh wait a minute!I'm not looking at 
*STE:	You don't want to go there.
*FRA:	I'm not    (.)  [whispering] silly sod  [] !Right!
*STE:	Right, that moves. (.) Not much there.
*FRA:	It should go right   (.) across at one end.
*STE:	No!No that's
*FRA:	Oh it is open circuit then.
*STE:	Yeah, it's trying to go that 
*FRA:	Yeah.
*STE:	way.
*FRA:	See if I reflected to this one I'll show you what the affect is.
*STE:	Tu turn 
*FRA:	Tu 
*STE:	that  (        ) ?
*FRA:	Yeah, turn that one, yep!Even the  (        ) .Remember where you can get it back to that's the only thing.
*STE:	Oh!Oh it's back where it was. (        ) at one end.
*FRA:	What are you doing this?
*STE:	Ah ha, let me just twiddle it.Hang on th  (.) check this up and twiddling time.
*FRA:	Yeah, see this is the wiper this should   (.) well assure itself back to that one.
*STE:	Goes when you touch it there.
*FRA:	Yeah, just touching the ends together.
*STE:	Oh!
*FRA:	Mm!I'll try the other one   (.) cos I've got that in bits. (.) If you can   (.) twiddle that one I'll er 
*STE:	Yep!
*FRA:	second one down.It   (.) reads totally different.That's it!Up one end   (.) down the other.
*STE:	More positive that one as well.
*FRA:	Yeah.That's 
*STE:	Yeah.
*FRA:	what it should read like.So it's definitely on the circuit.
*STE:	So it's down to the chip   (.) and we haven't had the chance of being  (        ) .
*FRA:	We might have to, we might be able to get away without having to take the board out, if I   (.) if I use the old de- solderer   (.) might be able to just hook it out and put the next one in. (.) Yeah but yo , that's what they did change, you looking for the fault?
*STE:	Yeah. (.)  [singing] Mm mm mm mm mm mm    []  (.) Ah ah! (.) What was that in the  (        ) ?I fo forgot now!
*FRA:	Oh Feverack 
*STE:	Oh yeah!
*FRA:	Oh!
*STE:	Oh don't!
*FRA:	Oh my good God!
*STE:	I've done the old   (        ) all been done in the packing!
*FRA:	Oh yeah?Do you know this bloody thing's jammed in the works somewhere, this control, it's fallen over!It won't come out!Swine!
*STE:	What a duff!
*FRA:	Oi! [sighing] Oh  [] !
*STE:	Oh I thought it was crack, it was only a hair anyway! ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	Oh is it?
*STE:	Brushed it off. (        ) have to come off with it.
*FRA:	Mm.
*STE:	Oh that's probably what's wrong is it, oh?
*FRA:	Don't e  (        ) too much!Just   (.) Got the control out anyway!
