*CHR:	Well that's what counts isn't it? •789952_791582•
*DAV:	Yes. •791742_791882•
*CHR:	So I'm now going straight for the black? •792222_796082•
*DAV:	Oh no. •796852_797552•
        You can move the yellow, can't you? •797652_799052•
*CHR:	Oh yes. •799072_799262•
        Yes I see. •799312_799622•
*DAV:	What I would do, because you haven't got a blue  hard enough is to push yellow off somewhere to the left of black •801172_809192•
*CHR:	Yes? •809472_809842•
*DAV:	so you can only push it across to three and get near the yellow, near the black. •810232_814972•
*CHR:	Right. •815442_815672•
*DAV:	You must you must get at least a ball a pioneer ball near your next two •815672_819492•
*CHR:	Right. •819772_819952•
*DAV:	to stand a chance. •819952_820912•
*CHR:	Okay. •821132_821422•
        Fine. •821562_821762•
