*GIN:	Hello, hello, hello,. •56735_57645•
*JAC:	. •_•
*GIN:	She had, she had so many warnings •60515_67735•
*JAC:	And I thought oh god •74915_78345•
*GIN:	But he looks bright. •79435_84645•
*JAC:	He went yesterday, I was gonna come up this afternoon and tell you when Peter came home, can't leave him, he was so naughty yesterday, he licked , •84945_100615•
*GIN:	, •101015_•
*JAC:	he licked that, although  •101315_102975•
*GIN:	yeah , •102975_103205•
*JAC:	she said he mustn't lick it. •103205_104695•
*GIN:	yes he'll have to have a collar on . •104695_105805•
*JAC:	I only went upstairs to get sort of washed and dressed, after the weekend, you have nobody around and er, oh eh, it started bleeding. •105805_114105•
*GIN:	But it's natural for them to lick a wound. •115165_117115•
*JAC:	It is, but it opens it up •117115_118975•
*GIN:	Yes. •118975_119185•
*JAC:	You see as it's quite nasty. •119185_121045•
*GIN:	Cos normally they aren't stitched, they have to heal by nature •121045_123525•
*JAC:	Yeah. •123525_123615•
*GIN:	I suppose. •123615_124455•
*JAC:	He erm •124595_125035•
*GIN:	What a good boy aren't you? •125035_126055•
*JAC:	and I thought oh what she gonna say, because he went yesterday afternoon •126055_129525•
*GIN:	Yes. •129785_129905•
*JAC:	and she said, I told you he had been licking, she said oh, even with the licking, that's excellent I'm very pleased. •129905_136165•
*GIN:	Oh really has healed nice  . •136515_138255•
*JAC:	And she said he's not out of the woods yet, but, I'll give you a collar, if he's naughty, very crafty,and then I looked through the crack in the door and his looking . •138255_152385•
*GIN:	But how can he reach it with the collar on? •152385_154595•
*JAC:	Well I •154595_154905•
*GIN:	You've got the collar on back to front. •154915_156385•
*JAC:	I know, because he can still reach it the other way round. •156385_159605•
*GIN:	Oh, it should be . •159605_161025•
*JAC:	Yes, I did, I put it on that way •161025_162465•
*GIN:	And he could reach?. •162465_163395•
*JAC:	And he could, see he's got a little . •163395_164385•
*GIN:	It's so long isn't it?. •164395_165545•
*JAC:	Yes, this is it, you see, I don't think she thought of •165545_167435•
*GIN:	Cos it's a . •167435_167865•
*JAC:	Yeah, and even if, even •168025_169845•
*GIN:	Got long under carriage, haven't you darling. •169845_171765•
*JAC:	mummy he's still licking,I thought what am I gonna do? •171765_177805•
        So, I put it on the other way round this morning and he hates it, I've only just done it •177805_182145•
*GIN:	Oh they do hate it. •182145_182925•
*JAC:	and he, he can't get round there  . •182925_185195•
*GIN:	At least he can see , I mean Roxanna  •185475_187365•
*JAC:	Yeah , •187365_187505•
*GIN:	had to have one for a short while, she was quite young and I, we'd only just moved here and I took her to the vet the used to be in Sandhurst, they said it was a bee sting, they put purple stuff on it •187505_197675•
*JAC:	oh. •197675_197735•
*GIN:	It didn't get any better and somebody told me about  and I took her down there, oh Mrs  she's picked up mange, I said mange, I know she said you feel just like when your child's got nits in their hair •197735_207788•
*JAC:	Yeah •207898_208288•
*GIN:	don't worry, it's, it's in the grass and she's just picked it up in the heat wave. •208298_212328•
        So to stop it  cos she always used to clear the foxes from the top garden, but er, because she worried it, it was about there on her patch •212328_220808•
*JAC:	Oh yes, a niggle . •220808_221588•
*GIN:	a bald patch , yes, so she had wear, actually we had to cut down a plastic bucket cos she was a big dog •221588_226178•
*JAC:	Oh yeah. •226568_227308•
*GIN:	cut down a plastic bucket and fixed that, it was great she had a bucket round her, round her •227308_231828•
*JAC:	Oh she'd only do that when  •231828_233148•
*GIN:	thing . •233148_233308•
*JAC:	I sort of popping upstairs, when I'm here, I'll take it off him, but just now he, he was walking along like  •233468_240668•
*GIN:	Let him get used to it. •240668_241718•
*JAC:	as though he could walk, but when you came to the door, here . •242028_244398•
*GIN:	Yeah, yeah, he'd forgot all about it, didn't he, he was putting it on you see. •244608_247438•
*JAC:	, yeah, yeah, this is it. •247658_248428•
*GIN:	They don't half get you at it, don't they? •248428_249628•
*JAC:	They do, they, they could wear you out. •249628_252378•
        But he's eating well going to the loo alright. •252378_255308•
*GIN:	Good, I, I thought of you following him around watching what he was going to do. •256258_259598•
*JAC:	Oh my dear I was, it, you sort of feel exhausted with the worry of it don't you? •259598_264468•
*GIN:	Yes and the •264468_264978•
*JAC:	And the strain. •264978_265638•
*GIN:	Of course you must of emptied his lower bowel, when she did the operation •265998_269038•
*JAC:	Yes. •269228_269288•
*GIN:	so there would of been nothing there for him to go for, you must of been ever so worried following him around watching him . •269288_273778•
*JAC:	I was , because I, I felt oh, if it all comes to pieces it's all gonna bleed •273778_278008•
*GIN:	Yes. •278218_278408•
*JAC:	but he was alright and he didn't strain cos he couldn't go •278408_282208•
*GIN:	Mm. •283278_283388•
*JAC:	. •_•
*GIN:	Was there any way he •283388_284058•
*JAC:	And he's eating it alright. •284058_285328•
*GIN:	Oh good. •285518_286418•
*JAC:	I, I just put it on his dinner, cos there's no way that I squirt it in his mouth, I'd probably choke him. •286468_291128•
*GIN:	Yeah, yeah. •292428_292548•
*JAC:	I just put it on his dinner and he, he's licking all his bowls clean •292548_295728•
*GIN:	Oh good. •295868_296428•
*JAC:	so, that it's working. •296508_298118•
*GIN:	So he's not off his food, that's a good sign. •298118_300118•
*JAC:	No. •300488_300778•
*GIN:	He's certainly alert, that's why I didn't want to ring the bell , •300788_303348•
*JAC:	Yeah , •303348_303518•
*GIN:	so that he wouldn't upset himself by barking, that's why I tapped on the window when I saw you. •303748_309018•
*JAC:	. •_•
        There Herbie. •309018_310498•
*GIN:	What a good boy. •310498_311538•
*JAC:	Yeah, you're still not having  he says , •311538_313208•
*GIN:	What a good boy , •313208_313608•
*JAC:	but he's quite bright eyed . •313608_314858•
*GIN:	he's aged , he's aged round he's eyes. •314868_318018•
*JAC:	Yeah, ten and a half years old. •318018_320628•
        Your . •320688_320758•
*GIN:	It doesn't seem that long since you had him as a puppy  •320758_322968•
*JAC:	I know . •322968_323178•
*GIN:	use to keep •323178_323838•
*JAC:	This is the thing. •323838_324638•
*GIN:	keep Lancer company. •324638_326698•
*JAC:	Yeah, you did you perked Lancer up a treat didn't you? •327528_330758•
*GIN:	Is there any way she can tell what's going on inside, where she did all the reconstruction. •330758_335908•
*JAC:	I suppose is the only way if, if he started bleeding or if he felt loose, cos she said he's still swollen from the operation •335908_343488•
*GIN:	Yes. •343488_343878•
*JAC:	obviously, but he's, he's gone down, I, I can see he's gone down a little bit •343878_348968•
*GIN:	Yes. •349718_349748•
*JAC:	I mean before he was all loose and baggy •349748_353008•
*GIN:	That's right, he was. •353018_353558•

*GIN:	And then of course he hasn't, he hasn't got testicles any more. •354358_357278•
*JAC:	No. •358568_358678•
*GIN:	But she's, so it's difficult to judge isn't it? •358678_360758•
*JAC:	Yes, yes. •360758_361878•
*GIN:	Cos you don't know how much she took away when she took the testicles out. •361878_364608•
*JAC:	No, he I mean he, he still got the little  •364678_365558•
*GIN:	They're partly inside, they're partly outside  •365568_367528•
*JAC:	a little bag, but there's nothing in them . •367528_369698•

*JAC:	Yeah, he has had a bonio, he likes a bonio, he did eat one last night, •402108_405678•
*GIN:	Well that's only •405678_406028•
*JAC:	he usually has a bonio after he's dinner  •406028_406998•
*GIN:	a food supplement isn't it?. •406998_408218•
*JAC:	this is it, but that's his sort of   •408268_410468•
