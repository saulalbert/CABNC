*PS0AB:	to have these er four numbers a chance to win about twenty thousand I keep sending them back but I have n't got the twenty thousand yet Ah I did win s it was before before Tasha and John got married it was er one of these catalogues that came through you see anyway I sent the thing back and I got the catalogue and they wanted some things out and you get twenty five pounds off whatever you ordered the first order so quite alright but I did win something out of that draw twenty five P .  108735_156345
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AB:	they sent me a cheque for twenty five P and I was going to tear it up I thought well no I might as well put it in the in the bank twenty five P And I waited till I 'd got a few bit more money to put in and sort of hid it amongst all these others mm Yeah twenty five P I won on that one What have you got your nose there for But talk about a hassle they wanted they well they picked the be the pr you know the present that you c you claim erm a deep fryer and I think it was in March time and by July it still had n't come in spite of ringing and writing and everything else .  156475_213405
*PS0A8:	Really .  214435_214825
*PS0AB:	and then they informed me that it was out of stock so I wrote them rather a a polite letter saying that it took them a long to realize it was out of stock when it had been ordered in March and erm I thought their communi communicative system in their office was er non existent Anyway they said what else would they like and they had some a set of luggage well it 's only this nylon stuff but it was very useful for them to take away with them it did a bit of good the and I I put in this letter I shall no longer order I shall what was it I shall be very wary of having any contact with your firm again They 're still pestering me sending me letters and we have n't heard from you recently .  217165_287025
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AB:	what would you like from the catalogue sort of thing and I only had this catalogue to Cos I pa you know I paid for it what di did they have Oh I think an electric drill it was in the sixties so with the twenty five pounds off it brought it down a bit and I I paid for it with one cheque so I was n't having it on the weekly er er it worked out I think Vicki gave some of it towards it But I thought if that 's how they run a business So then when they they moved house I realized they were using an ordinary saucepan to do their chips in and I had visions of fat boiling over and cos it 's gas so I bought them one a very nice deep fryer as a housewarming present It came in very useful because they were quite a while before the gas was connected But you 've only got if you w if you put chips in a basket in a chip pan if it the fat boils up you can at least lift the chips out straight away but if you 're putting them straight into the pan there 's no hope of stopping it coming over .  287025_403995
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  405375_405445
