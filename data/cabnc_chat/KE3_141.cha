*TON:	Next week I'm at Kingswood on Tuesday and Bishop's Grove on Thursday.
*JAC:	I'm afraid you're gonna have to find your own way to Bishop's Grove.
*TON:	Yep.
*JAC:	After all this I've had with being late   (.) you know?
*TON:	Yeah   (.) If I'd passed my test I wouldn't have driven there anyway.
*JAC:	You wouldn't?
*TON:	No   (.) don't know the way.
*JAC:	Oh.
