Steven (PS1BP)             [1443] Have you ever been to church at night?
David (PS1BN)              [1444] No

Chris (PS1BL)              [1466] Baptist
Steven (PS1BP)             [1467] Baptist, what's that mean?
                           [1468] I don't understand all these differences
David (PS1BN)              [1469] Just pay your money [...] and you put it in
                           the tray
Chris (PS1BL)              [1470] It's just you believe in baptizing
Steven (PS1BP)             [1471] Were you baptized?
David (PS1BN)              [1472] No
Steven (PS1BP)             [1473] [laugh] That makes sense
Chris (PS1BL)              [1474] Baptize you ... why not?
Steven (PS1BP)             [1475] Why weren't you baptized?
David (PS1BN)              [1476] You make such a decision you make when you,
                           when
Steven (PS1BP)             [1477] The decision you make when you
David (PS1BN)              [1478] Yeah
Steven (PS1BP)             [1479] Right aargh
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]
Steven (PS1BP)             [1480] you don't christened at a baptist church
David (PS1BN)              [1481] Of course you can get baptized when ya, er at
                           any age can't ya?
Steven (PS1BP)             [1482] It's not baptizing, christening is different
David (PS1BN)              [1483] You can get baptized any time can't ya?
Steven (PS1BP)             [1484] Yeah
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]
David (PS1BN)              [1485] when you're baptized
Steven (PS1BP)             [1486] it's your own decision
David (PS1BN)              [1487] when you're baptized it's like a pool of
                           water ...
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1488] Three or four of us start, er three or four
                           of us talking yesterday, day before yesterday, erm,
                           about ... the attitude generally of erm students in
                           the, the sixth form, years twelve and thirteen, and
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1489] and erm, it struck us that erm possibly in
                           this year's lower sixth erm there, there are one or
                           two people, boys and er lads and girls, erm who are
                           not aware
Chris (PS1BL)              [1490] Boys and lads and girls
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1491] of what sixth form courses entails, now, erm,
                           three or four of us thought it might be worth our
                           while, or your while if you just briefly said what
                           I'm going to say now, that erm, the, the
Chris (PS1BL)              [1492] It's a bit vague innit?
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1493] work you do up to G C S E is very difficult,
                           that it should be very different from erm, when
                           you're in the sixth form
Chris (PS1BL)              [1494] Why?
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1495] Because until G C S E you are fed, the school
                           is fed, in that you are told fairly quickly what you
                           have to do and although I know that a number of you
                           spends the right amount of time or a lot of time on
                           homework, you are told usually, er you have erm a
                           night or two nights in which to do this particular
                           piece of work ... now once you get into the sixth
                           form
Chris (PS1BL)              [1496] I can tell I'm not gonna like this
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1497] you are given very much more freedom or
                           independence would be a better word, and erm
Chris (PS1BL)              [1498] Shit
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1499] you'd be expected to, to do a lot of work by
                           yourself, and that's reflecting the fact that erm
                           you'll probably have four or five lessons in each of
                           your three subjects, but most people would choose
                           three subjects for A level, and that means that er,
                           when you're not having lessons, you've got a lot of
                           time that is not accountable for, you will have
                           been, or going to a general studies period and stuff
                           like that, but there will be a fair number of
                           private study periods, erm, there are some people I
                           think who, who go overboard, and you've got such a
                           different approach erm from er the lower sixth,
                           people don't use the time that they have, erm, what
                           I'm really saying is that if you go into the sixth
                           form ... and you spend less school time in the sixth
                           form you don't need to be prepared
Chris (PS1BL)              [1500] Well what's [...]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1501] to, to make wise use of your non-teaching
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1502] time, erm presumably going into a library
                           quite a lot.
                           [1503] You would also be expected to for example to
                           prepare for
Chris (PS1BL)              [1504] Eh I'm not going into a library, fuck that
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1505] for certain lessons, I just give you an
                           example with literature it would work with erm
                           science and er other things as well, you might be
                           told in the next lesson we are going to discuss, for
                           example the first act of a particular play, or we're
                           going to discuss which particular scientific
                           experiment or the cause of whatever it is
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1506] you will be expected to have done some
                           research, done some preparation before coming along
                           to the lesson, if you go along to the lesson not
                           having done that, you will be able to play back
                           certain tips from what the other people say, but you
                           will not er, you will find that [...]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1507] anywhere near [...] as if you were prepared,
                           because if you were prepared there are bound to be
                           one or two things that you would want to ask for,
                           own by the standard of interpretation of whatever it
                           is, or a particular word if it's a language and so
                           on, erm and that is something that er I think people
                           erm come across as [...]
Chris (PS1BL)              [1508] Oh yeah, sure
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1509] and the other, the other, the other thing, I
                           don't want to make this sound a lecture or anything
                           like that, but the other thing is that erm erm you
                           have
Chris (PS1BL)              [1510] You can stuff your lecture
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1511] twenty one months in the sixth form, please
                           don't think that everybody has two years, erm and
                           those, those
Chris (PS1BL)              [1512] Oh okay
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1513] short two years may make a big difference at
                           this stage now, erm
Chris (PS1BL)              [sigh]
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1514] A levels [...] only happen when the most, a
                           month, more from school and then they have study
                           leave as you are, now erm ... when you consider the,
                           the year since September has gone very, very
                           quickly, those who have done very little work in
                           that first year, year twelve, will find that [...]
                           been packed in there and that first year in the
                           sixth is just like your year ten ought to have been,
                           perhaps, one or two of you are are realizing
Chris (PS1BL)              [1515] Oh oh
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1516] that you could have done a bit more last year
Chris (PS1BL)              [1517] That's likely
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1518] and it's even more noticeable once you go
                           into the, the year twelve, that first twelve months
                           is crucial, if you just kick your heels and do
                           nothing, you'll find it very very difficult to work
                           to pull up [...]
Chris (PS1BL)              [1519] Is he finished this?
                           [1520] Finished this?
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1521] but whichever work you study
Chris (PS1BL)              [1522] Yeah, all of it?
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1523] you know that is the, erm two or three things
                           there, you're working by yourself in your, your
                           personal preparation [...] prepa preparation are
                           crucial parts, erm, if any of the people were
                           thinking of going to erm, erm, a college, erm, the
                           same sort of thing will arise and I suppose the big
                           difference for [...] if you don't have lessons then
                           I think I'm right in saying you don't necessarily
                           have to go in, I don't know whether that still
                           applies, erm, you would be expected of course to
                           erm, erm, to turn up at school here, erm, now there
                           are advantages and disadvantages, you may feel that
                           you prefer, knowing on your own what you're like,
                           you'll prefer erm some fairly rigid rules, erm,
                           because if there weren't rules you might think you'd
                           take advantage of us
Chris (PS1BL)              [1524] You got rules here
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1525] erm, only that sort of rules, probably a big
                           advantage I think of staying in er sixth form is
                           that erm you know the staff, you know the system and
                           it and they know you, erm if you go to [...]
Chris (PS1BL)              [1526] A big problem man
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [1527] you will take you a matter of months of
                           course for you to settle in, and those first few
                           months are crucial, again, I maybe just mention this
                           that you are aware of [...] okay so that's [...] ...

Chris (PS1BL)              [1528] Okay, let's go ...

                           money this morning so I didn't bother going to the
                           building society
Chris (PS1BL)              [1667] So you owe me fifty five quid, what's that
                           got to do with it?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1668] I said, I can't give it to you today though
Chris (PS1BL)              [1669] Why not?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1670] I just told you why not, I didn't go and get
                           it
Chris (PS1BL)              [1671] Why?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1672] Cos you didn't give me your money to put in
Chris (PS1BL)              [1673] So why didn't you go ... and get some out?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1674] I was only going to get out what I was gonna
                           give to you to put it, you said you were putting it
                           in
Chris (PS1BL)              [1675] I didn't, I never said I was putting it in,
                           you said that for me
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1676] Oh alright shut up, don't spend, don't save
                           any ... you're going to be in a mess in the summer
                           when you want, want lots of money to spend ...
Chris (PS1BL)              [1677] Why I'm gonna want some money to spend on?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1678] Well you're talking about that concert and
                           what are you and Rhiannon going to do for the whole
                           of the summer when you finish in June?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1679] No idea

Chris (PS1BL)              [1681] Well we're going on holiday for two weeks,

                           on holiday?

Chris (PS1BL)              [1683] Do you think so?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1684] No, it doesn't seem very positive, I don't
                           know
Chris (PS1BL)              [1685] When, never is, is it?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1686] No, we'll see I don't know if I want to spend
                           the money this year
Chris (PS1BL)              [1687] Has he bothered last year?

                           half tricky, we'll be more busy, I don't like it
                           when it's busy
Chris (PS1BL)              [1693] Not at all, in the middle of bloody June
                           there'll be no one there

                           fair then, that's erm, that's taking four people and
                           not giving back, that's ungrateful
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1713] That's right then
Chris (PS1BL)              [1714] Why not? ...
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1715] I'll see, no

                           why not?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1718] There's no, it doesn't matter why if she
                           can't
Chris (PS1BL)              [1719] No, go on, I want the reason, she might be
                           able to if her mum and dad pay for her ... go on
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1720] I don't know, I'm not taking responsibility
                           for you both

Lynne (PS1BM)              [1722] don't er, have to share one room perhaps, she
                           might not like it
Chris (PS1BL)              [1723] Share a one room with who?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1724] All of us, if we got er one room
Chris (PS1BL)              [1725] Oh
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1726] like we did in Ibiza there was only one room
Chris (PS1BL)              [1727] oh a stu a studio
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1728] Mm, some of, a lot of them are like that
Chris (PS1BL)              [1729] Well you don't have to have a studio, you
                           have a choice when you book it
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1730] Yeah, but they're more money aren't they?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1731] No [...]
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1732] That was only meant for three, you couldn't
                           have got four in it
Chris (PS1BL)              [1733] not that bad for four
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1734] Well where would of the other bed have gone?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1735] Stand the other side, move, would of moved
                           those drawers and stuff on there I think

Chris (PS1BL)              [1744] but you didn't, you won't take
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1745] shut up about it
Chris (PS1BL)              [1746] responsibility for her before she's sixteen,
                           take responsibility for ourselves
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1747] Then you can go on your own
Chris (PS1BL)              [1748] Oh you, you wouldn't let me would you, you
                           would
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1749] Yeah, get yourself a job, get yourself a job
Chris (PS1BL)              [1750] you wouldn't let me go on me own
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1751] If you were paying for it I couldn't stop you
                           now you're sixteen
Chris (PS1BL)              [1752] You'd just give us dirty looks probably
                           wouldn't go
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1753] Mm, go and get yourself a job and go
Chris (PS1BL)              [1754] So you wouldn't mind?

Chris (PS1BL)              [1757] you've gotta be eighteen before you ... you
                           stop me doing other things
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1758] Such as?
Chris (PS1BL)              [...]
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1759] Oh don't start that one again, I'm bored with
                           that
Chris (PS1BL)              [1760] Can, can I stay with [...]
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1761] I'll see, but I'm not promising Chris, it
                           also depends what your dad says ...
Chris (PS1BL)              [1762] He's never here anyway, it don't matter
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1763] No we've got a separate, spare room
Chris (PS1BL)              [1764] When's dad coming back?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1765] I don't know yet, I should think it'll be by
                           the end of the month
Chris (PS1BL)              [1766] Why he ask you?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1767] He hasn't, got to wait for the things to come
                           the, the bed and the car and er they haven't ordered
                           a carpet yet
Chris (PS1BL)              [1768] She, got to wait till they order a carpet?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1769] Well there's no use moving in till they've
                           got a lounge carpet cos if they go in they'd just
                           have to move everything to get it in
Chris (PS1BL)              [1770] Sodding hell [...]
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1771] they haven't got a bed anyway, we don't know
                           when that's coming
Chris (PS1BL)              [1772] Why?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1773] They can't sleep on the floor can they?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1774] They can if I can, hmm, er when's the bed
                           going to get there?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1775] We don't know
Chris (PS1BL)              [1776] Well when, did they order it?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1777] Mm
Chris (PS1BL)              [1778] From where?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1779] Oh one of those catalogues
Chris (PS1BL)              [1780] That's a rip off isn't it?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1781] No they're not, they got a ... was it thirty
                           percent discount, first
Chris (PS1BL)              [1782] Five
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1783] time buyer or something
Chris (PS1BL)              [1784] Oh thirty
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1785] I think it was thirty
Chris (PS1BL)              [1786] How much was the bed?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1787] Oh I think they said they were paying a
                           hundred and ninety nine
Chris (PS1BL)              [1788] Where they get all their money from?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1789] They're not getting it, it's all on credit
Chris (PS1BL)              [1790] Oh that's bad news innit?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1791] Not if they can afford to pay it and they
                           don't get too much, it's interest free credit on
                           fridge freezer
Chris (PS1BL)              [1792] Well I know, it's still bad news cos they've
                           got their mortgage and everything
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1793] Well they're both working, they've got a
                           good, good income every month now
Chris (PS1BL)              [1794] How much?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1795] I dunno, I think they should clear eleven
                           hundred a month between them
Chris (PS1BL)              [1796] No in years [...]
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1797] I don't know how much they're getting
Chris (PS1BL)              [1798] clear eleven what d'ya mean clear?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1799] Well after you've had your tax and insurance
                           taken off, that's how much they should have between
                           them
Chris (PS1BL)              [1800] What between them, that
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1801] at the end of the month
Chris (PS1BL)              [1802] that's only twelve thousand, thirteen
                           thousand a year, that's crap, that's what Gerrard
                           gets just on his own
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1803] Oh it must be more then I don't know then
Chris (PS1BL)              [1804] it's double that innit?
                           [1805] Lesley gets more than Gerrard doesn't she?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1806] She does now, she's got this new job
Chris (PS1BL)              [1807] Oh, it's about twice that
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1808] [...] what's Gerrard on ten thousand?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1809] More than that, twelve innit?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1810] Oh I don't think it's
Chris (PS1BL)              [1811] Twelve, thirteen, yeah cos he used to be on
                           ten at the old place and he gets about two thousand
                           more
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1812] Oh was then ten?
                           [1813] Oh yeah, well after you've taken tax and
                           insurance back you see, you've lost about three
                           hundred, three fifty
Chris (PS1BL)              [1814] Yeah, under the Conservatives that, if you'd
                           been under Labour you would of lost about four
                           hundred ... didn't think of that though did you,
                           didn't think your own son
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1815] But they, the Conservatives are cutting down
                           on the health service and everything else and the
                           schools
Chris (PS1BL)              [1816] So?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1817] What are we going to do when there's no, no
                           health service?
                           [1818] They're going to get rid of it you know
                           eventually
Chris (PS1BL)              [1819] No
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1820] They are
Chris (PS1BL)              [1821] No they're, they'll still be
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1822] that's the way it's going
Chris (PS1BL)              [1823] they'll still be a health service, but peo
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1824] No
Chris (PS1BL)              [1825] but people who can afford to pay for it will
                           be, will be made to at the time
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1826] Well that just
Chris (PS1BL)              [1827] which I think is right, if you can afford to
                           pay for it then you should be made, made to
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1828] But where do they draw the line at those who
                           can afford to pay for it?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1829] I don't know, that's up to them
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1830] No so I draw the pay, a set amount each month
                           and have peace of mind thank you very much
Chris (PS1BL)              [1831] Aargh
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1832] even if I've never had to use it much
Chris (PS1BL)              [1833] Never even paid national insurance in your
                           life have you mum?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1834] Your dad pays his share for me, comes out of
                           his wages ... if I paid, it's just extra on top of
                           all that, if I was paying any
Chris (PS1BL)              [1835] Well that, oh, it's no point in arguing
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1836] Why?
                           [1837] You ask me so I told ya ... no point in
                           arguing, you won't make a very good politician, shut
                           up, sod off
Chris (PS1BL)              [1838] [laugh] Don't use that language
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1839] I can't win this argument so shut up
Chris (PS1BL)              [1840] [laugh] I shall bloody win
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1841] Pardon?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1842] I shall bloody win
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1843] That's enough
Chris (PS1BL)              [1844] Why shouldn't, why shouldn't we be made to
                           pay for a health service?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1845] Because it's, it's a service for everyone, as
                           long as everybody gets the same [...]
Chris (PS1BL)              [1846] The only good thing, the only good thing
                           about La the only good thing about Labour is that
                           they would have brought back student grants so if I
                           ever, if I ever do go to university then I'll get
                           lots of money.
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1847] And if Labour'd got in they'd of er, your dad
                           said he'd er probably got a rise
Chris (PS1BL)              [1848] Would he? ...
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1849] Mm, I think he
Chris (PS1BL)              [1850] Rubbish how much?
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1851] Don't know, Labour'd be more ... give more to
                           the public sector don't they than the Conservatives?
Chris (PS1BL)              [1852] Why he got a rise by the
Lynne (PS1BM)              [1853] He might of done he said, he probably would
                           of done in the la the unions would of put in a big
                           one for ... Mr Major wouldn't give one, still
                           wouldn't have affected
Unknown speaker (KBMPSUNK) [...]

                           [1855] Aha, do you want him to have more money? ...

Chris (PS1BL) [1951] Yeah, miles better, for the good of the country they're
              not good for you, women shouldn't have the vote you know [laugh]
              women shouldn't get the vote, I think they should bring back,
              bring back just men having vote, women don't get a say as far as
              I'm concerned that's a good idea don't you think? [laugh]
Lynne (PS1BM) [1952] Oh we go to our place for, now women stage for [...]
Chris (PS1BL) [1953] [laugh] stage, that's my, that's my whole life [laughing]
              it's my whole [] I've had that erm, have my views, so why do you
              think I should vote Labour?
Lynne (PS1BM) [1954] Er
Chris (PS1BL) [1955] Come on why?
Lynne (PS1BM) [1956] because they'll put more into education and schools
Chris (PS1BL) [1957] Yeah and it'll take a
Lynne (PS1BM) [1958] and the health service
Chris (PS1BL) [1959] Yeah, but they haven't got enough money
Lynne (PS1BM) [1960] Take it off the rich
Chris (PS1BL) [1961] they haven't got enough money to do that.
Lynne (PS1BM) [1962] well take it off the rich.
Chris (PS1BL) [1963] They have not, they have not got enough
Lynne (PS1BM) [1964] Well they will do
Chris (PS1BL) [1965] they haven't, did you not read the article in the er
              Telegraph?
              [1966] They said, they said
Lynne (PS1BM) [1967] Yeah, I'm sorry I don't need [...]
Chris (PS1BL) [1968] the actual, actually nine point four billion pounds behind

Lynne (PS1BM) [1969] Short
Chris (PS1BL) [1970] short
Lynne (PS1BM) [1971] Mm
Chris (PS1BL) [1972] yes because they, they fo forgot to take out the money
              which they could have, which erm, which would of come from
              privatization, which they had no intention of doing so they took
              that out.
              [1973] Are you not for privatization? ...
Lynne (PS1BM) [1974] Er ye yes, if it gives a better service at the end of the
              day
Chris (PS1BL) [1975] So you think it's better?
Lynne (PS1BM) [1976] Yeah
Chris (PS1BL) [1977] Well why don't Labour then?
Lynne (PS1BM) [1978] I just said because of the health service and schools
Chris (PS1BL) [1979] Well the health service could be privatized
Lynne (PS1BM) [1980] and they're more likely to give more money to us
Chris (PS1BL) [1981] and why shouldn't the health service be privatized?
Lynne (PS1BM) [1982] Because some people need a lot more treatment than others
              and it's something you cannot, you cannot forecast
Chris (PS1BL) [1983] I know but the actual, the actual peo the actual people
              that have to pay for us, such it could be more that erm, the
              government would actually pay for it and then hospitals would erm
              fight for the, for the actual er thing
Lynne (PS1BM) [1984] Yes, but what if they don't?
Chris (PS1BL) [1985] What if they don't want?
Lynne (PS1BM) [1986] If they just make it totally private where everybody has
              to pay
Chris (PS1BL) [1987] I don't know they'd never do that, they'd never do that
Lynne (PS1BM) [1988] those poor unfortunate people, I don't know would they
              not?
Chris (PS1BL) [1989] No
Lynne (PS1BM) [1990] That's a right step in the right direction, no
Chris (PS1BL) [1991] Do you not think British Rail would have, have
Lynne (PS1BM) [1992] I've no idea, I'm sure it will now
Chris (PS1BL) [1993] You do care
Lynne (PS1BM) [1994] [laughing] no I don't care, why should I care [] ?
Chris (PS1BL) [1995] Don't know
Lynne (PS1BM) [1996] Won't make any difference to my life ... these are cold
              ...
Chris (PS1BL) [1997] Why not, why didn't you vote Liberal Democrat?
Lynne (PS1BM) [1998] Because I don't think they had a chance of getting in to
              vote [...]
Chris (PS1BL) [1999] What getting into our seat?
Lynne (PS1BM) [2000] No, well, and to the country as a whole
Chris (PS1BL) [2001] What does it matter about the country, the seat is what's
              important
Lynne (PS1BM) [2002] Well yes
Chris (PS1BL) [2003] did you actually find out about the figures for the seat?
Lynne (PS1BM) [2004] No I didn't
Chris (PS1BL) [2005] If you found out
Lynne (PS1BM) [2006] but they come second
Chris (PS1BL) [2007] if you found out then you might have found out that they
              weren't very far behind, so they could of caught up and they
              could of gained a seat and they could of gained a say in the
              government
Lynne (PS1BM) [2008] Mm, mm
Chris (PS1BL) [2009] so it's not wasted at all
Lynne (PS1BM) [2010] No
Chris (PS1BL) [2011] is it?
Lynne (PS1BM) [2012] No
Chris (PS1BL) [2013] Pathetic, pathetic
Lynne (PS1BM) [2014] You asked
Chris (PS1BL) [2015] it's, you just, you just don't believe [...] and they went
              back up
Lynne (PS1BM) [2016] I'm the same as everybody else who's got views
Chris (PS1BL) [2017] a Labour person
Lynne (PS1BM) [2018] What's the difference?
Chris (PS1BL) [2019] a Labour person will never actually buy shares truly
              wouldn't
Lynne (PS1BM) [2020] Well I wouldn't, it's you and your dad who've bought the
              shares, I wouldn't
Chris (PS1BL) [2021] You did
Lynne (PS1BM) [2022] I put, yes only because your dad wanted some yes, I
              wouldn't dream of it otherwise, I'd stick my money in the
              building society

Lynne (PS1BM) [2024] you [...] just to save, we have a

              I am, I've got lots of money to spend
Chris (PS1BL) [2027] Compared to other people maybe, yes mum ... you're not
              grateful for what you've got
Lynne (PS1BM) [2028] I haven't got much of anything yet
Chris (PS1BL) [2029] Compared to a lot of other people you've got a lot more
Lynne (PS1BM) [2030] Yeah, well compared to a lot more I've got a lot less ...
Chris (PS1BL) [2031] Yeah, well you don't look at it like that

Chris (PS1BL) [2035] you, you want to be the best and no one
Lynne (PS1BM) [2036] I don't want to be the best, I just want a reasonable
              amount
Chris (PS1BL) [2037] You've got a reasonable amount haven't ya?
Lynne (PS1BM) [2038] I haven't, it depends what you, what way you look at it

              Marks and Spencers don't ask for a receipt you see, it actually
              happened, they used to take things from upstairs, bring them
              downstairs and said they bought it and got the money for it.

                           the line, wait for a safe gap in the traffic before
                           you move.
                           [2258] When crossing the dual carriageway or turning
                           right into the road, treat each half as a separate
                           road, wait
David (PS1BN)              [2259] do you know what it means by that?
Chris (PS1BL)              [2260] in the cen central driving, dividing strip []

David (PS1BN)              [2261] do you know what that means
Chris (PS1BL)              [2262] until there is a safe gap
David (PS1BN)              [2263] do you know what
Chris (PS1BL)              [2264] it means you come to turn right on [...]
                           road, and each
David (PS1BN)              [2265] it's er
Chris (PS1BL)              [2266] lanes a separate road doesn't it?
David (PS1BN)              [2267] you know when you come, you know when you and
                           nanny drop us off at ours
Chris (PS1BL)              [2268] aha
David (PS1BN)              [2269] and there's a slip road you've gotta come on
                           to, there's a slip road you go down ain't there?
Chris (PS1BL)              [2270] aha
David (PS1BN)              [2271] you slowly make your way out, don't got by,
                           you look over your right shoulder
Chris (PS1BL)              [2272] aha
David (PS1BN)              [2273] that's erm, that's a slip road what you, and
                           then, your next lane you stay in that lane, only use
                           a right and then if you want to overtake you go into
                           right and then back into right
Chris (PS1BL)              [2274] oh
David (PS1BN)              [2275] I mean never stay in the right hand lane
Chris (PS1BL)              [2276] why?
David (PS1BN)              [2277] because you overtake is speeding there, the
                           left hand lane isn't, the right hand lane is for
                           overtaking
Chris (PS1BL)              [2278] what happens at our speed?
David (PS1BN)              [2279] well you stick on the right hand lane when no
                           one overtaking ... that's not causing trouble for us
                           is it? ...
Chris (PS1BL)              [2280] [reading] Where a junction has a mini
                           roundabout, it will have a sign placed before the
                           give way.
                           [2281] Boxed junctions have criss cross yellow lines
                           painted on the road.
                           [2282] ... You must not enter the box []
David (PS1BN)              [2283] you stay behind it
Chris (PS1BL)              [2284] [reading] if your exit road or lane from,
                           from is not clear, but you may enter the box when
                           you want to turn right and are prevented from doing
                           so.
                           [2285] Junctions controlled by police or a traffic
                           warden, when all traffic is held up by police
                           officer or traffic warden you must not go left or
                           right until you are signalled to do so.
                           [2286] Junctions controlled by traffic lights ... do
                           not go forward when the traffic lights are green
                           unless there is room for you to clear the junction
                           safely, never go forward when the red, amber lights
                           are shown together, when traffic lights have a green
                           arrow filter signal, do not get into the lane when
                           filtering is allowed unless you [...] .
                           [2287] ... Well, before you turn right use your
                           mirror to make sure you know the position on
                           movement of the traffic behind you.
                           [2288] When it is safe, give a right turn signal and
                           as soon as you can do so take safely, take up
                           position just left of the middle of the road or in
                           the space marked by right turned vehicles, if you
                           can leave room for other vehicles to pass on the
                           left, wait until there is a safe gap between you and
                           any oncoming vehicle, looking, look out of sight for
                           motor cyclists and pedestrians, then make a turn,
                           but do not cut the corner as people like pedestrians
                           crossing the road in which you are turning.
                           [2289] Remember mirror, signal, manoeuvre.
                           [2290] When approaching a roundabout [] ... I'm not
                           testing you any more
David (PS1BN)              [2291] I was laughing at her, that fake thing she's
