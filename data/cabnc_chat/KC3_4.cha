*HEI:	Only  it's only cos it hasn't got the extra   
*JOA:	 The viewing area   
*HEI:	round the side, yeah, I know.

*HEI:	It's just cos you haven't got the extra round the, round the side, but it just looks small. 
*JOA:	You have the controls  (.)  
*HEI:	Underneath. 
*JOA:	underneath which aren't really so easy to see 
*HEI:	But you didn't have any controls on yours anyway.

*VIC:	Buy the latest  new set. 
*FRE:	 I er I  think erm   (.) it's silly not to have it er when you're going in for a new  set. 
*VIC:	 Mm. 
*HEI:	Yeah. (  )   
*JOA:	 I really didn't erm   (.)  
*VIC:	You really didn't want it did you? 
*JOA:	No I, I just wondered what use it would be to me. (.)  
*VIC:	It's as good as watching a video watching your holiday programmes and  everything else.

*HEI:	Hadn't even read the book either but I've fiddled with Natasha's. 
*JOA:	I just fiddled with the controls till    (  )   
*FRE:	 The thing that you  you have to remember, which you tend not to at the beginning    (.)  ((cough)) is that Ceefax is B B C for instance, so on one and two   ((sigh)) now if you change channel   (.) if you're on teletext and you want to go onto Oracle which is on three 
*JOA:	Three. 
*FRE:	you've got to go back to T V 
*JOA:	To change. 
*FRE:	to get to three and then back on to teletext 
*JOA:	Oh. 
*FRE:	you can't go direct. And that's er something that you tend to forget er initially, even, I mean I still sometimes still do. 
*VIC:	Mm. 
*JOA:	I was reading my instructions though and it said before you start pressing knobs 
*HEI:	Mm. 
*VIC:	Please read the  instructions.

*JOA:	 No. 
*VIC:	Oh. (.)  
*HEI:	  (  )
