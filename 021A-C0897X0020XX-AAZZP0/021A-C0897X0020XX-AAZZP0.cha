*CHR:	Well it looks fine tucked in like that.
*NOR:	I mean there's not much of it to tuck in.... You know sort of
*CHR:	Well that looks very smart as it is.
*NOR:	But you couldn't wear it out on this particular blouse
*CHR:	Well ca w
*NOR:	because of the belt.If you wore the erm
*CHR:	Well try it.
*NOR:	If you.I will.You think that the colours go and
*CHR:	I think the colours go very well indeed.I mean it doesn't pick up precisely the same colour but that in there
*NOR: ...]
*CHR:	Yes it is.Yes it is.Yes.But it clashes very well indeed.Why can't you wear it out like that?
*NOR:	Because you destroy the blouse, the the way that the belt ...]
*CHR:	Well that doesn't matter if you've got your, if you've got your jack your jackety effect then haven't you?
*NOR:	I suppose you could, if you were going to wear it like that, you could take the belt right off.
*CHR:	Well you don't have to.
*NOR:	Well no but you, it, it, it's quite a heavy belt and if it, if it's holding, if it's giving point to it.
*CHR:	Yes.And that would make it a, an even cooler outfit wouldn't it?
*NOR:	Yes.Because I have got this ... ...] ... this ... this creamy shirt.Erm ... which I saw again in Marks this year ... which you could wear tucked in with a belt.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes.But that one is, is genuinely versatile.Looks just as good tucked in as
*NOR:	Yes.As I say the problem with the tucking in on that one is there's not quite such a lot of length.So when you do this you might come out.
*CHR:	It'd start pulling out, yes.
*NOR:	Erm and I don't think it looks good hanging out because it's, you, you paying in the skirt and the belt and that.And it's a bit silly to wear er a permanent arrangement.But this shirt could be worn with the skirt, couldn't it?
*CHR:	Definitely.
*NOR:	I mean the colour's just as, it's not quite as strong.
*CHR:	...] the colour's pretty neutral isn't it?
*NOR:	But I mean it does pick up.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes I think the skirt's gonna be very useful actually.
*NOR:	Er ...] good skirt whether ...] .
*CHR:	Well I hope you will.I like it.
*NOR: ...]
*CHR:	It's the wrong green I think.The actual skirt, the skirt's a blueyer green.But you've got two blouses to wear with it, that's alright.You've got this other white one as well.
*NOR:	...] white one.That's a short, that's your shirt.
*CHR:	That's mine is it?Mm.
*NOR:	They're very good, that's the white one.
*CHR:	Yes.I would have thought
*NOR:	This white one might ...] the cream one.
*CHR:	Well so you've got four blouses ...] .
*NOR:	Which is the fourth?
*CHR:	Well the one you just said is a bit old now.
*NOR:	Oh yeah but that's white again isn't it?
*CHR:	Yes.No I think they're all worth ...] and I think that's an attractive top as well.I think you should have that.
*NOR:	Well erm.What else ...] .
*CHR:	I don't know ...] .It's it's it's a possible winter or cooler
*NOR:	No it's not.
*CHR:	weather skirt.With a jumper or cardigan.
*NOR:	No it's not....] cooler, warmer weather and it's got short sleeves you know.I don't really erm ...] .
*CHR:	 laugh]
*NOR:	That's wrong for that.This has got a stain on it.
*CHR:	That's a nuisance.It would be perfectly acceptable otherwise.
*NOR:	Yes and we've got big crease marks on there.
*CHR:	Let's have a look.
*NOR:	There.... I know it's there.I know it was last year I was really annoyed.
*CHR:	Put the light on.... . Well if we can't see it, it doesn't matter even if it is there.N'est pas?
*NOR:	Well you certainly can't see it.Which is ...] cos there was this big round grease mark.It was very ...] but maybe I got it out.But I suppose that ... might erm
*CHR:	Don't you think they go well together?
*NOR:	work.Those colours are not too dark are they?
*CHR:	 ...]
*NOR:	They're not perfect but they would do ...] .Oh what about this?... Mind you this skirt is only casual.And that's a rather sort of formal blouse.No that's wrong....] wrong.
*CHR:	Oddly enough I mean it's so far away from the yellow I would say it isn't wrong.
*NOR:	Oh it is wrong.It's not, it's not the same as this at all.That's sort of brilliant
*CHR:	That, that's a hot pattern and colour isn't it?
*NOR:	That's a brilliant yellow, yes.And this one's erm a sort of golder.And that wouldn't do.But that's colours go with that ...] .
*CHR:	Mhm.
*NOR:	Those are the only ...] .And I'll keep this blue skirt ...] stain, quite smart.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	...] .And I'll keep the dress.And I'll think about the shirt.I like it with the skirt.What I might do is go back to Marks.If they have one thing in that colour they may have another one.
*CHR:	In what colour?We were chatting.
*NOR:	The gold ...]
*CHR:	Are you, are you thinking of that because it's a bit too formal or something?
*NOR:	No just because it hasn't got the length for tucking in.
*CHR:	Oh, yes.
*NOR:	And I don't like these that pull out when you ...]
*CHR:	Well at least if it pulls out it looks alright.... It was interesting in the pub last night.There were quite a lot of enthusiastic er ... audience but er they were mostly grey beards like me.Yes.Oh yes well apparently they normally have a sort of rhythm and blues or something on a, on a Thursday.Er or soul or something of that sort, which er ... you know there were loads of youngsters in the pub.Not under age youngsters I was pleased to see.But er ... there were a goodly proportion of people who were really enjoying the er, the track.
*NOR:	I'm sorry I didn't feel up to going.
*CHR:	Yeah.Well we've got plenty of other, I've got the list....] opportunities to go and hear them again.He's a funny character though.
*NOR:	Who?Who's a funny character?
*CHR:	, who runs it.
*NOR:	...] .... He seems to have a very popular pub there.
*CHR:	Oh, who runs the band sorry, runs the band.
*NOR:	Oh, who runs the band.
*CHR:	Yeah, it, it's a new interim landlord at the Crown. ...
*NOR:	What happened to the old one?
*CHR:	Oh, they move on.Erm you know he found another pub.Sometimes they move from being managers to being licence, erm erm tenants, I mean
*NOR: ...]
*CHR:	when they're running their own business.
*NOR:	A bigger pub?
*CHR:	Perhaps but I mean the Crown is quite a big pub.
*NOR:	...] more opportunities.
*CHR:	Quite a big pub.It's a, with its own kitchens and what have you.I should think you could make a good living there if you wanted to.And there have been long term er landlords there.
*NOR: ...]
*CHR:	Sorry?
*NOR: ...]
*CHR:	Mm.Well I'll go and shower now.... Snoopy was off in a rush wasn't she?
*NOR:	Well she was going on the train.
*CHR:	Didn't realize she was going quite so early but I suppose it's hardly early anyway now.
*NOR:	What time does Lynda come in these days?
*CHR:	Half past nineish.
*NOR:	I wonder if she'll change her time because of half term and she won't have to be ... taking her daughter to nursery school today, half past one.

*CHR:	You don't want to leave it to Veronica?
*NOR:	Veronica doesn't want, want to do the shopping bit of it.
*CHR:	No.
*NOR:	I don't blame her either.
*CHR:	laugh] yes, it's certainly improving a bit
*NOR:	I know she hasn't left all her customers.
*CHR:	Oh quite, quite.Does she have any other suggestions of shops for the linings?
*NOR:	...] .Well John Lewis probably will have it but that means ... burdening Suzannah with it.At a time when she's busy with her exams.It also means sorting out the cash.
*CHR:	How interested is she in the preparation of this dress?
*NOR:	Oh she's interested alright. ...
*CHR:	Interested enough to be enthusiastic and do the right thing?
*NOR:	Well she, she also ...]
*CHR:	Did she?
*NOR:	but she is ... preoccupied at the moment with her exams and in a way I'm glad.I didn't want to ... send her material hunting if she could be doing something useful at college.
*CHR:	Yes, yes fair enough.Anyway, O K
*NOR:	Karen's given her an extra job from ... ...]
*CHR:	Is she?
*NOR:	...] going in on Monday when she doesn't normally.
*CHR:	Half past ten, right.

*CHR:	Well given that then, in that case she still can't ring the bank to find out what, how much she's now got in the account.
*NOR:	Can't she?Why not?
*CHR:	Well she can do, but she can't do it from home.That's all.She won't be home....] will she?

*CHR:	Homeopathic ones.
*NOR:	Well that's the kind I was after.Erm, I mentioned it to Suzannah.And she wasn't averse to the idea.But she said she doesn't need them for Monday because it's only when she takes the tests she gets in a panic not when she's ... she said she can do it in the practice classes.
*CHR:	Right.
