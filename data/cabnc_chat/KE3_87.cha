        I find that using an electric shaver makes your face sore cause you're rubbing your face all the time. •200939_201479•
        Whereas •201479_201515•
*MUM:	But I mean with a blade it's only one •201515_201875•

*TON:	which doesn't dry the skin dry the skin out or anything and erm it's just like washing your face with water. •202331_203271•
        I mean it doesn't  I used to hate it when I was doing plays there and you have er grease paint on and you'd be you'd try and you'd have to cream on your face to get the grease grease paint off . •203271_206046•
*MUM:	Get it off . •206046_206105•
*TON:	And so you'd be putting lots and lots of grease and much on your skin and then you get spots. •206137_206645•

        That they were putting on or was it the actual make up or? •207794_208162•
*TON:	Well it's just it's not the the grease the make up or the cream it's the fact that you're you're putting so much muck on your skin all the time and it clogs up pores and causes spots. •208162_209596•
        Cause you have to put a lot of cream on your face to get the make up off  and you do that especially if you're doing two performances a day  it's an awful lot mess and much you're putting on your face and you can't get it all off  •209596_212356•
