*DOR:	we didn't go to school after all, isn't it? •_•
*CHR:	What? •_•
*DOR:	Good job we didn't go to school after all, cos you'd of run round in the playground, you'd of been shattered!oops, too late! •_•
*CHR:	What's that bin? •_•
*DOR:	I don't know  it's a bin! •_•
*TIM:	Well why is the bin over there? •_•
*DOR:	I don't know, it looks as if it's got some grit in it for when it gets icy  I suppose you have to put he grit down there. •_•
*CHR:	But there's only one plate mum   in the ground. •_•
*TIM:	But Teddy's still  •_•
*DOR:	Mm. •_•
*TIM:	sad! •_•

*DOR:	What was that? •_•
        A funny one this time, or a scary one? •_•
*TIM:	It was a dream that Mrs  was there again. •_•
*DOR:	Mrs  ! •_•
*TIM:	Mm. •_•
*DOR:	Well what did Mrs  say ? •_•

        Was it a nice day? •_•
        Everything go funny? •_•
*TIM:	What? •_•
*DOR:	Sometimes in dreams everything goes most peculiar doesn't it? •_•
*TIM:	But it wasn't very sad. •_•
*DOR:	No, it was a pleasant dream. •_•
        Sometimes dreams are quite pleasant, you think, ooh I like that dream, I'd like that one again. •_•
        It never quite works out like that. •_•
*CHR:	No because you forget it in the end  •_•
*DOR:	Oh yeah  •_•
*CHR:	lots of dreams like that. •_•
*DOR:	that's right . •_•
*CHR:	Because when you remember it, it might come again. •_•
*DOR:	Yeah ! •_•
*CHR:	Then you remember it and it  starts to come a bit true doesn't it? •_•
*DOR:	Mm mm. •_•
*TIM:	 [singing]  (        )  [] 
*DOR:	Well  I don't think they come true really  it just sort of feels real. •_•
*TIM:	 [singing]  (        )  [] 
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*TIM:	 [singing]  (        )  [] 
*DOR:	Sometimes you can wake up and you think, ooh that was very real and then when you think about it •_•

*CHR:	But mummy    that  I sort of thought Adele would act  . •_•
*DOR:	But really you were in bed. •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*DOR:	Mm mm. •_•

        You were very frightened, we had to get you up  read you a story  have a cuddle  put the light on. •_•
*CHR:	I couldn't remember when, I don't think. •_•
*DOR:	It was something like half past two in the morning! •_•

*CHR:	No  because then, I just looked  over all those things that  I went  and  . •_•

*UNK:	What is that? •_•
*DOR:	Oh yes, attached to it, and you've just had yourself taped by the way. •_•
*UNK:	Have we? •_•

*UNK:	Oh I see. •_•
*DOR:	and the dictionary people   so I have to tape myself conversing with people  •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	for a week . •_•
        Which is all very entertaining! •_•
*UNK:	Yes. •_•
*DOR:	And sometimes I, sort of  •_•
*UNK:	! •_•
*DOR:	things like that, but I'm sure they'll sort it out. •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	I presume that's why it's for a week, you know? •_•
*UNK:	Yeah. •_•
*DOR:	Out of twenty tapes surely they'll be one that •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	wouldn't   will  ! •_•

        We'll make our way down to the post box first, and then we'll come back and  get bits and pieces on the way Christopher. •_•
        Goes through phases of being quite  quite boisterous •_•
*UNK:	Yes. •_•
*DOR:	and then other times of being •_•
*UNK:	Mm. •_•
*DOR:	pathetic! •_•
        But that's probably due to  •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	yesterday. •_•
