Barry (PS03W)                        [860] what do they do a bus shuttle?
Mark (PS042)                         [861] Er, I think they have, I think
                                     they'd have, I think they have two buses
                                     on er er ... a week so ... and then they
                                     go back if there's any more.
Barry (PS03W)                        [862] It's a long haul that innit though?
Mark (PS042)                         [863] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [864] Here.
                                     [865] I mean, how many students are from
                                     Morecambe nowadays?
                                     [866] Er, d'ya know?
Mark (PS042)                         [867] I've no idea.
Barry (PS03W)                        [868] Must be a fair number.
Mark (PS042)                         [869] I've no idea to be honest.
                                     [870] There's not as many as there used to
                                     be.
Barry (PS03W)                        [871] No.
                                     [872] No, no, no.
                                     [873] I mean we ... when I ... when I came
                                     here ... it was virtually, virtually half,
                                     half the population of that.
                                     [874] And then there was ... maybe a
                                     thousand people out of out of Morecambe.
Mark (PS042)                         [875] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [876] That's it.
                                     [877] And the Uni was then only about two
                                     thousand eight hundred strong.
Mark (PS042)                         [878] Mm.
                                     [879] But there's quite a lot of erm ...
                                     development in Lancaster now.
                                     [880] They're doing loads of ... erm,
                                     flats and there's all those, all that
                                     stuff round [...] ... Highcross area.
Barry (PS03W)                        [881] Yeah.
Mark (PS042)                         [882] But ... [...] .
Barry (PS03W)                        [883] Is it?
Mark (PS042)                         [884] I think so, but ... well that's part
                                     of St. Martin's College really, isn't it
                                     that er
Barry (PS03W)                        [885] Some of it is.
                                     [886] I thought some of it was the Uni.
                                     [887] But, you know, I mean, if the Uni
                                     goes to ten thousand in ... what ... what
                                     is it, it's getting up for about ninety
                                     five, ninety six?
                                     [888] It's quite quick.
Mark (PS042)                         [889] Something like that.
Barry (PS03W)                        [890] It's
Mark (PS042)                         [891] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)                        [892] very quick ... really.
                                     [893] Yeah, I mean that, well it's only fo
                                     well it's four, five thousand now?
                                     [894] But I mean you're talking
Mark (PS042)                         [895] Six.
Barry (PS03W)                        [896] It's five.
                                     [897] Well, whatever.
Mark (PS042)                         [898] Six.

Barry (PS03W)                        [903] That's going some!
Mark (PS042)                         [904] Well then I'll have to get an
                                     extension.
Alan (PS040)                         [905] [laugh] ... It's like sardines now
                                     in there.

                                     [907] ... I know, it's unpleasant innit?
Hugh (PS03Y)                         [908] It's always been popular along with
                                     students ain't it?
Barry (PS03W)                        [909] Aye.
Alan (PS040)                         [910] Like the only pub that is.
Mark (PS042)                         [911] Well Barry's doing alright now.
Barry (PS03W)                        [912] Is he?
Mark (PS042)                         [913] He's sort of got students in there
                                     ... new landlord and all that so [...] I
                                     think.
                                     [914] It's always packed out with students
                                     these days.
Barry (PS03W)                        [915] Must have got some student [...]
                                     then?
Mark (PS042)                         [916] That's right.
Hugh (PS03Y)                         [917] It's er
Barry (PS03W)                        [918] Mind you, it's convenient for the

Mark (PS042)                         [919] Yeah.

                                     thought The Tramway ... The Yorkshire, and
                                     [...] were always gonna do quite well out
                                     the Sugar House
Mark (PS042)                         [921] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [922] but in actual fact ... it, it was
                                     only really The Yorkshire House did
                                     anything ... direct
Mark (PS042)                         [923] Yeah.

                                     [932] Yeah, but it should have done
                                     alright.
Barry (PS03W)                        [933] Yeah.

Ken (PS043)                          [1352] not worth it.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1353] The trouble is it's a bit of a
                                     catch twenty two because ... [sigh] ... if
                                     you don't put a bus on, will you get the

                                     [1361] Nobody's said it yet.
                                     [1362] When they
Barry (PS03W)                        [1363] Mm mm.

Ken (PS043)                          [1368] Mm.

                                     stands [...] .

Barry (PS03W)                        [1379] I mean

                                     [1383] And they brought a big following
                                     down didn't they?
Barry (PS03W)                        [1384] They brought a big following.
                                     [1385] Yeah, that's right.

                                     [1391] If you make it known that there's
                                     stuff like that going on, if you get a
                                     band like that you can always just

                                     it
Alan (PS040)                         [1710] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1711] and snap and this, this would go
                                     off and you'd be sat there going right
                                     then, you actually
Alan (PS040)                         [1712] Well presumably
Barry (PS03W)                        [1713] see it take it, you know
Alan (PS040)                         [1714] the camera eye would be adjustable
                                     would it?
                                     [1715] Or
Barry (PS03W)                        [1716] I presume so, yes.
                                     [1717] I mean they was talking about
                                     getting a really small for erm
Alan (PS040)                         [1718] Oh right.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1719] you know, to be, to be used in ...
                                     in sort of coarse fishing and that.
Alan (PS040)                         [1720] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1721] But, of course, the other thing of
                                     course ,i it takes out the, the one that
                                     got away cos you actually see the one
                                     [laughing] that got away
Alan (PS040)                         [1722] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1723] you know [] ?
Alan (PS040)                         [1724] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1725] There'd ... be some story then.
                                     [laugh]
Alan (PS040)                         [1726] You know what'll happen is ... your
                                     camera would
Barry (PS03W)                        [...]
Alan (PS040)                         [1727] the cameras'll magnify it anyway
                                     won't it?
Barry (PS03W)                        [1728] Yeah it will.
                                     [1729] It will do.
                                     [1730] Yeah.
                                     [1731] Yeah.
                                     [1732] But it was really, I mean it, it
                                     meant of course that ... the other people
                                     on the boat could have some enjoyment as
                                     well, cos I mean, there's nothing worse i
                                     if you ... if there's only one rod out, or
                                     two rods out th those boats there's only
                                     like a couple of rods out int there on, on

Alan (PS040)                         [1733] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1734] those ... for the marlin and the
                                     ... and the sharks and that, fishing?
Alan (PS040)                         [1735] And you don't get many.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1736] Yeah.
                                     [1737] And it's not like, sort of
Alan (PS040)                         [1738] Three ... there'll be
Barry (PS03W)                        [1739] twelve
Alan (PS040)                         [1740] three or four maximum
Barry (PS03W)                        [1741] twelve rods out, yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1742] something like that.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1743] Yeah.
                                     [1744] So any anybody else that's going on
                                     board is bored out their brains basically!
                                     [1745] But at least
Alan (PS040)                         [1746] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1747] if you got T V monitors you can
                                     watch what's going
Alan (PS040)                         [1748] Watch it.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1749] on.
Alan (PS040)                         [1750] That's really good.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1751] So now, now I mean ... now with all
                                     the radar and ... whatever else we're
                                     using, I mean ... you should really be
                                     able to find fish.
Alan (PS040)                         [1752] Well that, that boat from Evesham
                                     that we went out on a couple a years ago
                                     it had a fish finder on it.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1753] Mm.
Alan (PS040)                         [1754] So ... it er, [...] fish finder on
                                     it.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1755] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1756] You throw your line out, you don't
                                     get a few just biting.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1757] No.
                                     [1758] No, that's right.
                                     [1759] That's right.
                                     [1760] They've done ... most of them are
                                     ... I mean the wo certainly the ones on
                                     the little ... little boat trips and that,
                                     I mean, they have ... all it does is that
                                     ... it'll tell you there's some fish
                                     about, I mean, it doesn't
Alan (PS040)                         [1761] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1762] tell you where to fish or
Alan (PS040)                         [1763] Oh no.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1764] depths or anything like that does
                                     it?
                                     [1765] What they're doing is ... there's
                                     some fish down there somewhere.
Alan (PS040)                         [1766] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1767] Cos that's the most frustrating
                                     thing about fishing is when you're like
                                     ... you know, you could be wasting that,
                                     you, you think to yourself like I could be
                                     wasting a whole, there's not a fish
                                     anywhere round here!
                                     [1768] [laughing] You know, you could be
                                     sat here like an idiot today
Alan (PS040)                         [1769] Well that's it I've I've sat on
Barry (PS03W)                        [1770] for hours on end [] .
Alan (PS040)                         [1771] Jay hours on end in middle of night
                                     freezing
Barry (PS03W)                        [1772] Mm.
Alan (PS040)                         [1773] you know like [...] ... and I've
                                     caught nothing.
                                     [1774] And you've
Barry (PS03W)                        [1775] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1776] thought well ... there's plenty of
                                     crabs ... in
Barry (PS03W)                        [1777] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1778] summer, take your bait
Barry (PS03W)                        [1779] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1780] but every time you throw out ...
                                     there's a crab on end of it.
                                     [1781] You know
Barry (PS03W)                        [1782] Yeah.
                                     [1783] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1784] you think, why does that crab
                                     always have to come my line.
Barry (PS03W)                        [laugh]
Alan (PS040)                         [1785] And all this sea yet it has to get
                                     my worm.
                                     [1786] And same, like no fish, you think
                                     well there must be fish out there.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1787] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1788] Well it's, it's luck innit?
                                     [1789] I don't know.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1790] I don't know what's going on.
                                     [1791] I don't ... we got about three,
                                     three thirty in the morning, both of them
                                     went out to er ... canal somewhere up ...
                                     Dulgate, past Dulgate ... we set up and
                                     we'd ... we'd been fishing for about two
                                     and half hours it's aba ... about six
                                     thirty in the morning this old farmer
                                     comes up says er ... aye, aye lads, he
                                     said er ... I wouldn't bother it, they
                                     drained this area of the canal a few
                                     [laughing] months ago!
                                     [1792] And we said, oh [] !
Alan (PS040)                         [1793] Yeah. [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)                        [1794] [laugh] ... [laughing] Sat there
                                     watching our floats for hours [] !
                                     [1795] I mean
Alan (PS040)                         [1796] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1797] I mean luckily you, you know, you'd
                                     gone on a car, with a car so it's a matter
                                     of throwing everything in the back and
                                     just going
Alan (PS040)                         [1798] That's it.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1799] somewhere else so ... could have
                                     sat there all bleeding day!
                                     [1800] And not have known anything about
                                     it.
Alan (PS040)                         [1801] Aye.
                                     [1802] I've had some lonely nights.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1803] Yeah.
                                     [1804] Do you catch many eels, eels or
                                     anything, many eels?
Alan (PS040)                         [1805] No.
Barry (PS03W)                        [...]
Alan (PS040)                         [1806] Didn't catch as many this year ...
                                     as what I have done.
                                     [1807] ... Phworgh!
                                     [1808] The slimy things that they are.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1809] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1810] You get one of the lads that works
                                     with me, if he catches three of them he
                                     says well ... I'll have them for my
                                     dinner.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1811] Yeah.
                                     [1812] I know.
                                     [1813] I know.
Alan (PS040)                         [1814] They look horrible!
Barry (PS03W)                        [1815] A delicacy.
                                     [1816] Mind you, I ate conga.
                                     [1817] I, I erm, I was off the west co er
                                     ... on a holiday to the west coast of
                                     Ireland and we erm ... we're driving down
                                     the west coast and there was like some
                                     rocks and everything about, so we stopped
                                     and, you know, I looked [...] by a rock
                                     pools or something, and there's this ...
                                     and the rock pool is like mini-swimming
                                     baths, they were, you know, probably
Alan (PS040)                         [1818] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1819] twelve foot long and about six or
                                     seven foot wide and about
Alan (PS040)                         [1820] Mm mm.
Barry (PS03W)                        [1821] six or seven foot deep and they're
                                     crystal clear.
                                     [1822] And there was this old guy dragging
                                     this bloody rope with a massive ... hook
                                     on the end ... like after ... after, you
                                     know, I presume it was cod or mackerel
                                     something along the ... and I said, what
                                     the hell are you fishing?
                                     [1823] You know cos ... the woman I was
                                     with wanted to go for a swim and I said no
                                     you can't this guy [...] , so I went up to
                                     him, I said what, what on earth are you
                                     fishing for?
                                     [1824] He said, oh there's three congas
                                     live in this pool.
                                     [1825] It was like ... a four foot one, a

                                     in the centre, there's a rock in the
                                     centre of it
Alan (PS040)                         [1826] Oh right.

                                     look over there.
                                     [1828] I said bloody hell!
                                     [1829] You know, and I said to her you

                                     [1830] He said ooh, he said ... there was
                                     some American students here last week and
                                     they were all swimming in there and the
                                     ... man came along with this thing and
                                     they bo they were all sat on the middle lo
                                     middle of there with their feet dangling
                                     in the water splashing away, he said ... I
                                     was dragging this down and this six footer
                                     came out, [laughing] I said, and then they
                                     were ... he said, you've never seen
                                     anybody run so fast in your life like they
                                     go
Alan (PS040)                         [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)                        [1831] they were dangling their toes at
                                     the end of this thing [] .
                                     [1832] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)                         [1833] Yeah.

Barry (PS03W)                        [1835] And then, the next day I went along
                                     and he actually caught ... the five foot
                                     one ... and ki and killed it and he gave
                                     us a load of steaks off it that I sort of

Barry (PS03W)              [1926] I like shark.
                           [1927] Have you eaten shark?
Alan (PS040)               [1928] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [1929] Oh I like shark, it's really nice cos it ...
                           it's really meaty, I mean, it's like eating meat.
Alan (PS040)               [1930] Like steak though innit?
Barry (PS03W)              [1931] Yeah.

Alan (PS040)               [1934] It's nice and ju tender I believe.
Barry (PS03W)              [1935] Yeah.
                           [1936] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)               [1937] But
Barry (PS03W)              [1938] But it's sort of thick and chewy it's not,
                           you know ... it's not flaky like ... fish, it's like
                           a ... almost like a meat.
                           [1939] It's really good.

                           Mississippi ... New Orleans
Alan (PS040)               [1962] Aha.
Barry (PS03W)              [1963] New Orleans [...] .
                           [1964] Er ... but I've had it just grilled, you know
                           ... and always done in butter.
Alan (PS040)               [1965] In butter?
Barry (PS03W)              [1966] Yeah.
                           [1967] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)               [1968] But I like trying all these things now and
                           again.
Barry (PS03W)              [1969] Mhm.
Alan (PS040)               [1970] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [1971] You ca I mean you occasionally see it in the
                           fish markets.
Alan (PS040)               [1972] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [1973] And er ... I mean, things like squid and that
                           I ca I quite like, but I'd never think of get buying
                           it, I wouldn't ... buy it and cook it myself or
                           anything.
                           [1974] I just
Alan (PS040)               [1975] Oh no.
Barry (PS03W)              [1976] the trouble is, once you actually
Alan (PS040)               [1977] Tried that
Barry (PS03W)              [1978] so what sorry?
                           [1979] I remember once, you know, getting and
                           cutting ... a rabbit and things, by the time you'd
                           actually cut the thi damn thing
Alan (PS040)               [1980] You've gone off it.
Barry (PS03W)              [1981] you'd gone off it cos you'd been ... heading,
                           and gutting it, and [laughing] whatever else [] !
                           [1982] And you know, you're sat there and you think
Alan (PS040)               [1983] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [1984] I don't [laughing] really wanna eat this, you
                           know [] !
                           [1985] It's alright if it comes to you in a ca in a,
                           in a, as a, as a meal
Alan (PS040)               [1986] Comes up ready-made.
Barry (PS03W)              [1987] Yeah.
                           [1988] But er, when you actually see what you're
                           doing to it, you know.
Alan (PS040)               [1989] I had this octopus once in Germany ... and
                           it, we'd gone out for a meal and ... I was gonna
                           have steak and mushrooms and
Barry (PS03W)              [1990] Mm.
Alan (PS040)               [1991] er, the lads said what are we having the
                           starters like?
                           [1992] I said, oh ... I'll have what you're
                           ordering.
                           [1993] Well they ordered soup of the day you see ...
                           and they brought this, I tasted it ... had a real
                           funny, a weird taste
Barry (PS03W)              [1994] Mm.
Alan (PS040)               [1995] anyway, and I sort of said to the waitress,
                           why what was it?
                           [1996] She said octopus.
                           [1997] Urgh!
Barry (PS03W)              [1998] [laugh] ... You wouldn't have had it if you'd
                           have known?
Alan (PS040)               [1999] No.
                           [2000] I don't think I would.
Barry (PS03W)              [2001] No.
Alan (PS040)               [2002] It's not something
Barry (PS03W)              [2003] No.
Alan (PS040)               [2004] I would have picked.
Barry (PS03W)              [2005] No.
                           [2006] I wouldn't.
                           [2007] I certainly
Alan (PS040)               [2008] Well
Barry (PS03W)              [2009] wouldn't.
Alan (PS040)               [2010] it was ... it were
Barry (PS03W)              [2011] I mean I like fish but I wouldn't, I wouldn't
                           choose it.
Alan (PS040)               [2012] Had a funny taste but it was quite nice.
Barry (PS03W)              [2013] Yeah.
                           [2014] What was it, a sort of fishy ta I mean was it
                           a sort of fishy soup?
Alan (PS040)               [2015] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [2016] No?
Alan (PS040)               [2017] It didn't have a fishy taste, it we like beef
                           ... but ... I presume it's the way they've cooked
                           it.
Barry (PS03W)              [2018] Mm.
Alan (PS040)               [2019] Cos they all put spices in and everything.
                           [2020] But er ... I definitely wouldn't have ordered
                           it.
Barry (PS03W)              [2021] No.
Alan (PS040)               [2022] No.
                           [2023] Like now, I don't think I would order it
                           again.
Barry (PS03W)              [2024] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)               [2025] But ... then I had steak and mushrooms to
                           follow.
                           [2026] ... Quite nice.
Barry (PS03W)              [2027] So if you don't eat what you catch ... why
                           choose
Alan (PS040)               [2028] Why do I wanna
Barry (PS03W)              [2029] sea fishing?
                           [2030] No, I mean I, cos I, you know I,i I ... spend
                           a long time coarse fishing so I understand actual
                           fishing ... for pleasure as opposed to
Alan (PS040)               [2031] Yeah, yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [2032] like to eat, you know, there's not much you
                           can catch coarse fishing that you can eat anyway ...
                           erm but ... most people who go sea fishing do it ...
                           to eat what they catch.
                           [2033] Or to sell what they catch or whatever, I
                           mean
Alan (PS040)               [2034] Aha.
                           [2035] Mm.
                           [2036] I, I do it ... I like, I like
Barry (PS03W)              [2037] But why sea fi why, why does sea fishing
                           interest you and not coarse fishing sort of thing?
Alan (PS040)               [2038] Because you ... there's more opportunity for
                           big ones
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)              [2039] Mm.
Alan (PS040)               [2040] if anything.
Barry (PS03W)              [2041] Mm.
Alan (PS040)               [2042] Like, you go canal fishing, you know, you're
                           only getting
Barry (PS03W)              [2043] Yeah, that's right.
Alan (PS040)               [2044] like you get the odd four and half pound
Barry (PS03W)              [2045] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)               [2046] pike or chub
Barry (PS03W)              [2047] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)               [2048] whatever
Barry (PS03W)              [2049] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)               [2050] but you know, you, you come to the fairly
                           big'uns out there.
                           [2051] So
Barry (PS03W)              [2052] Mm.
Alan (PS040)               [2053] so I suppose that's why I do it.
Barry (PS03W)              [2054] Mm.
                           [2055] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)               [2056] To see if I can get a big one.
Barry (PS03W)              [2057] Mm.
None (PS044)               [2058] Can you get
Alan (PS040)               [2059] You going home?

              hundred.

              [2460] And it's only a quid to get in and it's a pound, pound a
              pint.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2461] Two quid and, and a drink, yeah.

              pound a pint.

              [2466] That's getting in the

Barry (PS03W) [2467] I don't think they've got a lot of staff on.
              [2468] ... I wouldn't have thought they'd bother with a
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2469] No.
Barry (PS03W) [2470] student night, having a lot of staff on, it's pointless
              having ... ah, I mean, the bouncers ... in that situation.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2471] Well you'd only need one.
              [2472] ... But we don't need a bouncer on
Barry (PS03W) [2473] Except, mind you, the, the rough, the erm rugby club gave
              the band a bit of er, a rough ... seeing to.

Terri (PS03X) [2496] Mm.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2497] Does the Sugar House get that many people in?
Barry (PS03W) [2498] No.
              [2499] No.
              [2500] The Sugar House only opens er ... Thursday, Friday,
              Saturday.
              [2501] Or, or,o we always have done.
              [2502] I mean, we ... we opened originally, first year, every
              night of the bloody week and it was pointless, absolutely
              pointless.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2503] Is that bigger than the Empire?
              [2504] I've never been in it?
Barry (PS03W) [2505] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [2506] No!

Hugh (PS03Y)  [2511] Well it's on, it's on a Thursday, yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [2512] it's ... it's legally bigger than the Empire but the
              Empire can get more people in cos he's got upstairs and
Terri (PS03X) [2513] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [2514] that
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2515] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [2516] see.
              [2517] But, of course, erm for licensing they don't take that ...
              particularly into consideration up there.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2518] Well they half upstairs [...] straight away.
Barry (PS03W) [2519] Yeah.
              [2520] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2521] So er
Barry (PS03W) [2522] I mean, I think, I, I think the Empire legally is ... well
              I thought it was nine hundred
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2523] Seven fifty I think.
Barry (PS03W) [2524] [whispering] I can't think er [] ... I don't know.
              [2525] I think it's nine hundred.
              [2526] I mean you could cer you could
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2527] Well I thought it was seven fifty.
Barry (PS03W) [2528] certainly get seventeen, eighteen hundred in there.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2529] Well yeah.
              [2530] Even that Bob Monkhouse opened up ... quite
Barry (PS03W) [2531] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2532] quite nice.
Barry (PS03W) [2533] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2534] Well, they'll have the [...] Garden won't they?
Barry (PS03W) [2535] Oh yeah.
              [2536] Mind you
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2537] Probably, fucking tell by, cos there was ... I thought
Barry (PS03W) [2538] They we
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2539] there was too many.
Barry (PS03W) [2540] Yeah.
              [2541] But I mean they were banging ... they were banging fifteen
              hundred in for that disco for the first
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2542] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [2543] few months weren't they?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2544] No, twelve, twelve or thirteen.
              [2545] They never had fifteen.
Barry (PS03W) [2546] Didn't they?
              [2547] ... I mean the Sugar House, his capacity's
Hugh (PS03Y)  [...]
Barry (PS03W) [2548] just been ... upped to eleven hundred I think.
              [2549] Erm ... I mean, it was always nine hundred, but it's been
              upped to eleven hundred last year I think.
              [2550] Well we used to put, I mean, I put twelve, thirteen
              hundred in the Sugar House.
              [2551] But tha but you ... it's full at that, you know.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [2552] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [2553] Whereas the, the, the, you, you could ... you could, you
              could fit sixteen, seventeen hundred.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [2898] and you take as you improve the business.
                           [2899] It's whether, you know, what we've got to
                           look at really is what, what, basis we can use that
                           fifteen thou for.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [2904] You know.
Barry (PS03W)              [2905] The biggest thing is a case of refurbishment
                           to, is that, that's what we want.

                           [3048] We actually set up ... buffet in there
Barry (PS03W)              [3049] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3050] which worked ... reasonably well.
Barry (PS03W)              [3051] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3052] I think one did it, you know what I mean

Barry (PS03W)              [3055] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3056] Erm, and what else worked well ... erm ...
                           for a while, we were doing the women's darts.
                           [3057] And we had ... about three boards in here and
                           we had a board in there.
                           [3058] I mean, there must be about seven boards in
                           all.
Barry (PS03W)              [3059] Right.
Barry (PS03W)              [3060] Was that a competition was it?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3061] No, it was a weekly ... thing.
                           [3062] Because, what they were doing, they were
                           going to individual pubs
Barry (PS03W)              [3063] Oh yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3064] Which couldn't cope
Barry (PS03W)              [3065] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3066] with it, and th wha on their knock-outs and
                           their cups and everything they
Barry (PS03W)              [3067] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3068] wanted them all in one place.

Barry (PS03W)              [3070] Aha
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3071] but erm ... there was a bit of jealousy in
                           the la licensees started getting a bit er ... er
Barry (PS03W)              [3072] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3073] because we're taking the trade away from
                           them, you know ... they would have obviously had
Barry (PS03W)              [3074] They were all the other pubs and the darts
                           [...] ?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3075] Yeah.
                           [3076] They'd have had a lot [...] .
Barry (PS03W)              [3077] A bit of competition from other place.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3078] Well, at that stage we were talking to ...
                           the men's darts secretary came along and was saying,
                           he'd be quite interested in, in ... knocking up, you
                           know, one of the Lancashire matches or something
Barry (PS03W)              [3079] Oh!
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3080] like that.
                           [3081] It's a
Barry (PS03W)              [3082] Well it's the stage for it int it?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3083] Th thing is, you can put it on there, put it
                           on sta you can er film it, and bang it on the big
                           screen over there.
Barry (PS03W)              [3084] Mhm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3085] which is what I, I, in the [...] I had Eric
                           Bristow and Maureen one night, and, I mean, it was
                           just little dart board in the corner, but what I did
                           was, I had a big screen like that ... and I just got
                           ... student television service just to film it live
                           and just throw it straight back up onto the big
Barry (PS03W)              [3086] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3087] onto the thing, so ... you know, it was like
                           ... well it's better than being at the telly.
                           [3088] I mean, it's better
Barry (PS03W)              [3089] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3090] than
Barry (PS03W)              [3091] Watching that.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3092] because th on the telly they haven't got
                           those.
                           [3093] I mean, I'm
Barry (PS03W)              [3094] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3095] amazed at the, on the world championships,
                           they've only got those ... lighting up boards
Barry (PS03W)              [3096] That's right.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3097] haven't they?
Barry (PS03W)              [3098] That's right, yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3099] You know, and, I, instead of having ... I
                           mean
Barry (PS03W)              [3100] Screen up.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3101] why they don't just put a screen up
Barry (PS03W)              [3102] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3103] that beats me, you know.
                           [3104] They do other sport etcetera.
                           [3105] See what I mean?
Barry (PS03W)              [3106] Mm.
                           [3107] Yeah.

                           need to sort, with Johnny's entertainment out with a
                           roof.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3112] little leaks.
                           [3113] What it is is, the ventilation ... on the
                           roof, ventilation shafts ... when the wind's driven
                           ... it drives under and leaks through.
                           [3114] And we get it in two or three places, the
                           toilets are, are the key one.

                           [3220] I mean,tha that's the problem we got at the
                           moment.
Barry (PS03W)              [3221] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3222] On Mary's do, what we did, I put [...] soul
                           machine over here where the screen was
Barry (PS03W)              [3223] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3224] so people could dance on the er ... on the
                           actual dance floor if they wanted.
                           [3225] Erm ... I mean, it's not ideal but it really,
                           it worked.
                           [3226] It wor even, providing you haven't got a lot
                           of ... if you've only got about a hundred people
                           it's not too bad that cos it, it ... also creates a
                           bit more atmosphere.
                           [3227] But, it's a better ... i it's not a ... bad
                           designed place in a sense that, that ... I mean,
                           it's a reasonable size room
Barry (PS03W)              [3228] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3229] and you ca and three hundred people er, you
                           can take three hundred quite
Barry (PS03W)              [3230] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3231] easily ... I mean, you know, we've had four,
                           fives ... hundred in.
Barry (PS03W)              [3232] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3233] You can take three hundred quite easily.
                           [3234] But ... the erm ... the other thing about it
                           is if you have a hundred people in ... it can be so
                           also be a good atmosphere, you know?
Barry (PS03W)              [3235] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3236] Yet,i it's not one of those rooms where, if
Barry (PS03W)              [3237] No.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3238] you only get a hu yo you're struggling if
                           you've only a got a hundred.
Barry (PS03W)              [3239] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3240] Erm, what I'm, I've just arranged somebody to
                           redo our speaker syste our original system with
                           tannoys, we blew our tannoys ... speakers, and ... I
                           didn't bother getting them replaced because we were
                           going for a rock crowd ... so we just used Bernie
                           and Nigel
Barry (PS03W)              [3241] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3242] P A there.
Barry (PS03W)              [3243] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3244] What I've got, is I've got four of these
                           directional speakers, there's two up and two on here
                           ... and then two big bass ones which sit on a floor
                           back there.
                           [3245] And, so it's very loud on the dance floor but
                           you can actually talk out, out here.
Barry (PS03W)              [3246] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3247] Which I thought we need to redo if we're
                           gonna get private bookings.
Barry (PS03W)              [3248] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3249] Cos the one thing you always get when you've
                           got a mixture of people, I mean, all thi this needs
                           recovering basically as well.
Barry (PS03W)              [3250] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3251] But I mean, that's not a big job it's just
Barry (PS03W)              [3252] No.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3253] re relinoing it basically.
Barry (PS03W)              [3254] Oh yeah. [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3255] Oh yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3256] [...] ... Filling the smoke
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3257] Smoke machine
Barry (PS03W)              [3258] up.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3259] Yeah, you got a smoke machine ... we, we, we
                           would set in little, in a hole in the back.
Barry (PS03W)              [3260] And all of these air conditioning valves are
                           on?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3261] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3262] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3263] Actually I'm having the,a th I mean I can
                           get, I'm getting our system back in operation.
                           [3264] It, it was gonna cost me a thousand but I've
                           done a deal with a guy who'd got stuck with some in
                           Manchester so it's gonna cost me five hundred which
                           I'm getting done this Friday.
                           [3265] Erm ... to put a satellite ... system, to put
                           a satellite in would be three hundred quid in total.
Barry (PS03W)              [3266] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3267] So ... I mean it's ... that's only one ...
                           that's only one good'un, good night using it innit,
                           a year?
                           [3268] Pays for that.
Barry (PS03W)              [3269] Yo you're light, the er ceiling ... could you
                           not get away with covering the, get the lights a
                           colour blue?
                           [3270] And er ... and ... you know, tidying up
                           ceiling obviously [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3271] Right.
Barry (PS03W)              [3272] I mean, there's lots of bits and pieces you
                           need for ... a
Barry (PS03W)              [3273] I mean, if you just ... cover all the areas
                           that were really
Barry (PS03W)              [3274] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3275] bad, er ... I reckon, I says, well what do
                           you think ... yourself in, in, in
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3276] Well the, the big ... the single biggest cost
                           is, is what we do with this ... a carpet area.
Barry (PS03W)              [3277] Mm. [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3278] That's our single biggest cost, cos ... as I
                           say, I had three quotes in total, and they were all
                           sort of between thirteen and twenty three.
Barry (PS03W)              [3279] Yeah.
                           [3280] Thousand.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3281] Yeah.
                           [3282] But that's, having said that, that's to
                           carpet all this area
Barry (PS03W)              [3283] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3284] that back area I've just taken you through,
                           that, the staircase, and the corridors out there.
                           [3285] I mean, that's the carpet ev I just said like
                           ... I wanted a quote to carpet
Barry (PS03W)              [3286] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3287] everywhere.
                           [3288] Erm ... what we were doing is,i what it was
                           for, was for, for prospective buyers, they wanted
                           erm ... a justification for
Barry (PS03W)              [3289] Yeah.
                           [3290] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3291] the money they were gonna spend.
                           [3292] I mean, they wouldn't have spent that money.
                           [3293] But, they wanted ... written quotes for ... a
                           justification more or less.
Barry (PS03W)              [3294] Do you think it's better being like this?
                           [3295] Looking there, or is it better sort of,
                           clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space
                           and
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3296] Well it's quite, it's a reasonable size
Barry (PS03W)              [3297] I know it's a fair size, but [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3298] It's a fair size dancing
Barry (PS03W)              [3299] you know
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3300] space actually, I mean, you get about a
                           hundred people on here, it's, it's, it's alright.
                           [3301] In fact the, in fact it's,i at times it's too
                           big.
                           [3302] That's, my one, I don't know how you'd ever
                           get over it, but that's my one ... criticism of the
                           thing is that sometimes when you walk in ... it's
                           the first thing that hits you and unless people are
                           dancing ... it creates a cold atmosphere.
Barry (PS03W)              [3303] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3304] Erm
Barry (PS03W)              [3305] I mean, if you've got your group on ...
                           there's nothing better than having your floor there
                           and are dancing on ... the floor at, at, in front of
                           the group kind of thing like
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3306] Yeah, but I mean a a if you have any
Barry (PS03W)              [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3307] anything like a, a, a group takes all of
                           this.
Barry (PS03W)              [3308] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3309] If you have a
Barry (PS03W)              [3310] That's right.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3311] a main group up, you know
Barry (PS03W)              [3312] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3313] you're struggling to get
Barry (PS03W)              [3314] But then if you did this floor space like
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3315] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3316] we said
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3317] Oh yeah.
                           [3318] Yeah.
                           [3319] I mean, I, I actually don't think you need
                           carpet on ... I mean I, I don't
Barry (PS03W)              [3320] Oh no.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3321] think, I don't think you need any of this
                           carpet, to be honest.
Barry (PS03W)              [3322] [...] black [...] , would that look nice?
                           [3323] Black [...] carpet.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3324] I dunno.
Barry (PS03W)              [3325] Ah, cos Peter was saying, I dunno, I dunno
                           ... what the ... black [...] .
Barry (PS03W)              [3326] Don't have to be black [...] , you just want,
                           you want something that er ... I don't know really,
                           you'd have to think about it wouldn't you?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3327] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [3328] Yeah.
                           [3329] Oh yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3330] Could do with probably somebody who knows
                           what they're doing on it.
Barry (PS03W)              [3331] You want the carpet area full of seating
Barry (PS03W)              [3332] Actually one thing Barry
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3333] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3334] don't you?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3335] That's right.
Barry (PS03W)              [3336] Give it a bit of warmth when they're sitting
                           right
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3337] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3338] down.
                           [3339] [...] the area.
Barry (PS03W)              [3340] That's one thing Ben said though, which was
                           quite useful, he said get some people down ... pick
                           their brains.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3341] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [3342] You know, let them come down and give a quote

Barry (PS03W)              [3343] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [3344] for whatever you're looking at
Barry (PS03W)              [3345] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [3346] and pick what they thought, was the best
                           thing you could do, and then don't, don't tell you
                           but ... get them made.
Barry (PS03W)              [3347] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3348] You know, and like
Barry (PS03W)              [3349] That's right.
Barry (PS03W)              [3350] I say it, these guys are working on this all
                           the time.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3351] I mean, on a normal night ... it's, the
                           raised areas fill up with people ... seated.
Barry (PS03W)              [3352] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3353] This area's er, everybody's stood around.

Barry (PS03W)              [3356] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3357] down cos you're in the middle of ... the
                           thoroughfare.
                           [3358] You know,i i you need to be full to fill up
                           that area because ... well, you know yourself,
                           people like to stand around the bar don't they?
Barry (PS03W)              [3359] Mm.

                           ... and this has been down ... well it's, obviously
                           it's been down since it opened, now I can't remember
                           when Brewer actually opened
Barry (PS03W)              [3363] Mm.

Barry (PS03W)              [3372] I wonder
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3373] year.

                           other one out.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)              [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)              [3382] I wonder how much it would cost the town,
                           like?
                           [3383] I know it sounds silly, but I say, the silly
                           things like that are the ones that sometimes ... are
                           the

Barry (PS03W)              [3385] ones that are took seriously.

                           there?

                           and a little bit of adjustment and
Barry (PS03W)              [3479] Yeah.

Barry (PS03W)              [3484] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3485] They keep getting damaged and collapsing, and
                           of course, it's part of the fire protection as well
                           , so

                           want.
Barry (PS03W)              [3588] This is, it is not the similar stuff like
                           we've got in the kitchen upstairs?
Barry (PS03W)              [3589] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [3590] No.

                           [3597] Same
Barry (PS03W)              [3598] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [3599] sort of thing.
Barry (PS03W)              [3600] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [3601] Maybe that's the type of thing you want on
                           the floor.
Barry (PS03W)              [3602] I reckon that is.
                           [3603] That is it.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3604] In there.
                           [3605] ... Make, do some more er ... extend the er
                           er er er parquet flooring area to give you more
                           dance room.
                           [3606] An and, and round the ... other areas which

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3608] and keep the carpet on the high ... seating
                           areas.

                           [3611] I think it's better up there.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3612] Oh yeah.
                           [3613] Aye, but it wouldn't cost very much to carpet
                           those two areas.
Barry (PS03W)              [3614] No.

                           look at, oh! what a pretty carpet you've got.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3623] No.

                           year, and just comes and let us in.
                           [3776] I mean
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3777] What so, so ba ... as la as towards five
                           o'clock as, as possible.

Barry (PS03W)              [3782] Well if you come down to us so
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3783] Cos then Mike ought to see your operation as
Barry (PS03W)              [3784] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3785] well you see, so
Barry (PS03W)              [3786] If you bring him down about
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3787] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3788] you know, half four to five
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3789] Half four.
Barry (PS03W)              [3790] we'll be
Barry (PS03W)              [3791] You'll get the idea
Barry (PS03W)              [3792] we'll be getting on top
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3793] Alright.
Barry (PS03W)              [3794] then, you know.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3795] Okay.
Barry (PS03W)              [3796] We're usually done by five, you know, so
                           there's
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3797] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3798] no problem

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3800] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3801] o'clock.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3802] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3803] Five o'clock.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3804] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3805] I think the biggest thing really is just like
                           they say, is how much you can get that done for
                           [...] ... and, get the roofing done, that's gotta be
                           done.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3806] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3807] Er
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3808] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3809] some paper ... them toilets ... cos er, I'm,
                           you know, I say, from our ... our, both side is ...
                           something that's er ... I mean, everybody's looking
                           purely from [...] and return sales.
                           [3810] All you're looking at is for an income [...]
                           , an income from it ... and er ... I reckon ... can
                           do very well.
Barry (PS03W)              [3811] What do you, what you think of that bar area
                           Barry?
                           [3812] Do you think it could be inclined to be
Barry (PS03W)              [3813] Er, the top one?
Barry (PS03W)              [3814] as a drinking area
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3815] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3816] U yeah, I mean I
Barry (PS03W)              [3817] during the day?
Barry (PS03W)              [3818] yeah, well it was ... it was what I wanted
                           to, it was what I wanted to, it was wanted to do
                           initially, I mean, but then you have like ... so
                           many ideas ... that
Barry (PS03W)              [3819] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3820] you know, you can't do them all in that
                           sense, but if you had somebody ... somebody like
                           Colin might be able to
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3821] Cos you only need, you only need ... him to
                           drag ... sort of ... fifteen, twenty people in
                           initially
Barry (PS03W)              [3822] And five, ten of them
Barry (PS03W)              [3823] And they'll all, they'll all be drinkers.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3824] Yeah.
                           [3825] But I mean ... sa ta so there's an at little
                           atmosphere there anyway
Barry (PS03W)              [3826] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3827] erm ... and then you can, I mean, well it
                           gives you the opportunity to, you know ... bang in a
                           bloody jazz band or whatever you wanna do in there
                           somewhere
Barry (PS03W)              [3828] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3829] and, and build it up like that.
Barry (PS03W)              [3830] As you said, they haven't actually, you know,
                           it'd be ... if you could get some sort of portable
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3831] Screening.
Barry (PS03W)              [3832] screen that'd just shut it off.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3833] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [3834] So people don't feel as though they're sat in
                           a wide ai wide open
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3835] No, I know, yeah.
                           [3836] Yeah, that's right.
Barry (PS03W)              [3837] you know.
                           [3838] Erm
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3839] Well you ca you ca you can get that.
Barry (PS03W)              [3840] You can get, you can do something
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3841] But, yeah
Barry (PS03W)              [3842] can't you?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3843] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3844] Like you say, if you get your satellite T V
                           in there
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3845] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3846] you know, you can
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3847] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3848] just make it a cosy little bar where you can
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3849] Yeah.
                           [3850] That's right.
Barry (PS03W)              [3851] It won't cost any to give it a go would it?
Barry (PS03W)              [3852] No.
                           [3853] If Colin's ... if Colin's up for it, it
                           wouldn't at all.
                           [3854] I mean, it needs to perhaps ... perhaps they
                           can do something for the first couple
Barry (PS03W)              [3855] Oh yeah, need some sort of er
Barry (PS03W)              [3856] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3857] idea to get it going and get it off the
                           ground even if you ... you put your beer on at, well
                           I just thought of couple [...] Boddingtons put their
                           ... they're ... they're gonna put their, they're
                           gonna put there's at a pound a pint.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3858] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [3859] You know, just to attract some people, you
                           know, approach the brewery, say look what about a
                           few keg?
                           [3860] And if you get ... two or three keg ... put
                           that money into free stock you know.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3861] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3862] Say you [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3863] Cleaner's not, the cleaner's not done behind
                           here yet.
Barry (PS03W)              [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)              [3864] If you open it up, if you do get it open, and
                           advertise it at Boddingtons a pound a pint, get them
                           straight ... to come in.
                           [3865] You're not making a fortune at first, but
                           once you get it going
Barry (PS03W)              [3866] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3867] You said about traditional

Barry (PS03W)              [3875] [...] ... the fire exit [...]
Barry (PS03W)              [3876] You could put it behind, you could feed it
                           through the wall behind to where that
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3877] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3878] spacious room is where all your chairs are

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3879] Yeah.
                           [3880] We probably could, yeah.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3888] It's fucking ridiculous!
Barry (PS03W)              [3889] Erm ... cos you'd tell the brewery wouldn't
                           you?
Barry (PS03W)              [...]
Barry (PS03W)              [3890] The only other thing to do is, is do what er
                           ... er, we did at one time and just get a ... bright
                           beer and open it up and ... er, and then pull it.
                           [3891] And have it.

Barry (PS03W)              [3892] I know.

Barry (PS03W)              [3895] But would you?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3896] Depends tha I don't know what sort of draw
                           you can put on that pump here.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3950] I don't know if I've got them here.
Barry (PS03W)              [3951] How much is that for?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3952] Well it was er ... it was about
Barry (PS03W)              [3953] Twenty two.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3954] here we are, that's it er ... it's rent which
                           we we're gonna clear
Barry (PS03W)              [3955] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3956] there's twelve for rates, and the twelve and,
                           other two's ours which we're ... we
Barry (PS03W)              [3957] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3958] can, we can stand on that.
Barry (PS03W)              [3959] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3960] You've got, you've got like ... water rate,
                           twelve hundred, er, rates, twelve ... but er, what
                           we could try to do is approach them and see if we
                           can lump it in with this year and that, obviously
                           have to pay higher
Barry (PS03W)              [3961] I mean, some of it is ... is the next two
                           month anyway ... erm
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3962] Yeah.
                           [3963] But we we'd usually have ... no
Barry (PS03W)              [3964] but
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3965] rents, er we've no er ... we've lease to pay
                           back have we or owt like that?
Barry (PS03W)              [3966] Oh and the other ... the other thing is, is,
                           is by asking Fred for
Barry (PS03W)              [3967] To pay.
Barry (PS03W)              [3968] That's right.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3969] But even so, then ask Fred on the long term
                           would be ideal.
                           [3970] Er, the biggest thing is for us is ... is
                           making payable for you.
Barry (PS03W)              [3971] Yeah.
                           [3972] I mean
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3973] At first
Barry (PS03W)              [3974] we've not gone any further with this Fre with
                           Fred because
Barry (PS03W)              [3975] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [3976] we're just leaving it ... so we sort
                           ourselves out first on, on how
Barry (PS03W)              [3977] Yes.
Barry (PS03W)              [3978] we feel happy with it and
Barry (PS03W)              [3979] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [3980] and whe how, how, whether you want ... Fred
                           involved in, in what way.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3981] Well it's really that's needed be here, you
                           know, if we ca
Barry (PS03W)              [3982] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3983] if we can
Barry (PS03W)              [3984] And
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3985] if we can resolve it ... with ... cos then
                           you're getting summat on a different style of
                           thinking to that, you know, I know Fred doesn't
                           wanna be involved but then you've always got
                           somebody, well we'll have to go and see Fred first.
Barry (PS03W)              [3986] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3987] And, and I don't know.
Barry (PS03W)              [3988] Yeah, you could work it
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3989] Go see Fred and he's probably got a few more
                           pounds ready available than
Barry (PS03W)              [3990] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3991] than we have.
Barry (PS03W)              [3992] Oh yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3993] You know, that's the er
Barry (PS03W)              [3994] That's right.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3995] bit difficult.
Barry (PS03W)              [3996] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3997] And that's your er, cos er personally
Barry (PS03W)              [3998] Oh, I've got the
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [3999] I'll say that it's not.
Barry (PS03W)              [4000] accounts in various ... off-shore [laughing]
                           islands and, and
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4001] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4002] black bin liners in his back garden [] .
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4003] If we can sort him out with rates and, I
                           don't know.
Barry (PS03W)              [4004] If he can o if we can offset, if we can use
                           all, if he'll [...] out time type of thing
Barry (PS03W)              [4005] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4006] with that
Barry (PS03W)              [4007] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4008] erm ... the oh er
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4009] You've gotta put an offer in and pay it so
                           much a month haven't you or something and, and, and
                           get it paid off over a period of time?
Barry (PS03W)              [4010] And then you can do it without Fred and,
                           really, with Fred is, is at the end of day you could
                           pro ... proof pay load could go back to yourself and
                           I, I E ... and ourselves, but by having him that
                           other cut ... you're gonna be saying well ... it's
                           all a bit more than ... your share.
                           [4011] I mean, from my point of view ... I don't
                           think he's ever
Barry (PS03W)              [4012] I don't think Fred'd be looking for anything
                           as a return.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4013] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [4014] Not in the shor
Barry (PS03W)              [4015] I'd be quite happy to come
Barry (PS03W)              [4016] not in the short term.
                           [4017] Not in the short term.
Barry (PS03W)              [4018] you get tucked into it, and obviously there
                           we'll keep it ... sort of low profile.
                           [4019] But giving it a good clean out ... and
                           getting
Barry (PS03W)              [4020] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4021] it dus painted behind the things whatever,
                           come on Sunday or whatever ... and just say that you
                           might
Barry (PS03W)              [4022] In return, yeah.
                           [4023] Just take a
Barry (PS03W)              [4024] quite keen just to sort of get
Barry (PS03W)              [4025] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4026] mucked into it
Barry (PS03W)              [4027] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4028] just to save money
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4029] See if you can get
Barry (PS03W)              [4030] but as long as, I say, the biggest thing from
                           my point er ... is ... not to so lose money if you
                           can do from where we're going.
Barry (PS03W)              [4031] No.
Barry (PS03W)              [4032] And use the fifteen grand to its best ...
                           image in the way that you feel then you can turn
                           round and run a club ... so it can get people in.
Barry (PS03W)              [4033] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4034] And we can get the lighting in.
                           [4035] Because that's what your best thing is
Barry (PS03W)              [4036] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4037] you've got the ideas ... and th the motions.
Barry (PS03W)              [4038] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4039] And for yourself, and what we don't wanna do
                           is like I say, is spend money that ... is just gonna
                           disappear and say shit!
                           [4040] We haven't really improved the pub's ...
                           barrelage ... if goes away.
Barry (PS03W)              [4041] No.
                           [4042] I mean,th the other aspect of the, of the fif
                           ... the other aspect of the, the brewery and me that
                           I was ... talking about, er I'm thinking about is
                           that we we could do with ... you know, okay those,th
                           those figures are ... I mean, unless they're really
                           realistic it's gonna be ... you know, six months or
                           so
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4043] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4044] before we start getting up to the kind of
                           figures where we can actually see a ... you know
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4045] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4046] a profit each week
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4047] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4048] a a, a, reasonably substantial profit, I mean

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4049] That's right, yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4050] so, with the best will in the world it's
                           going to be six months so let's ... so we need a
                           little of breathing space
Barry (PS03W)              [4051] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4052] on that six months.
                           [4053] Now ... er, er obviously if, if we can, if we
                           can get the money off the brewery cos ... you know,
                           if we can get a little bit more
Barry (PS03W)              [4054] That's right, yes.
Barry (PS03W)              [4055] than we actually need to spend that ... that
Barry (PS03W)              [4056] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4057] enables us to ... you know, have that
                           breathing space ... erm ... so we can start
Barry (PS03W)              [4058] Well what, what we can, you know I say, he's
                           offering us this fifteen unsecured if we can, mind
                           you
Barry (PS03W)              [4059] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4060] I don't know if we can squeeze any more or
                           what
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4061] I reckon
Barry (PS03W)              [4062] but, but, you know if say well look, you
                           know, we could do with twenty five and he turns
                           round and [...] he might say well ... you know,yo he
                           might say no
Barry (PS03W)              [4063] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4064] but we know we've got fifteen just to get us

                           [4405] I'm just thinking of that exit there.
                           [4406] This, this is good.
                           [4407] I mean if you put that
Barry (PS03W)              [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4408] the nearest one
Barry (PS03W)              [4409] You mean, it's a fire exit so that's the
                           problem so you're not gonna be able to leave
                           anything in it ... that would obstruct.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4410] But ... ah, so this, it's the actual fire
                           exit for here int

Barry (PS03W)              [4416] Yeah.
                           [4417] It goes out next to the cellar.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4418] I suppose like you say at nine thirty once
                           the music starts no one 's gonna want to
Barry (PS03W)              [4419] Oh er, if you put, if you put ... if you put
                           wrought iron gates [...] gates decorated type of

Barry (PS03W)              [4423] And, and wrought iron it, yeah, you know.
Barry (PS03W)              [4424] Well wrought iron'd look ... it'd look quite
                           good for the functions trade as well cos you can get

Barry (PS03W)              [4425] Yeah.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4438] I mean close that area down.
Barry (PS03W)              [4439] And that, that would do double job cos that
                           would do the job of your blinds as well wouldn't it?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4440] Yeah.

                           and, and just give it that
Barry (PS03W)              [4469] As you say, if somebody's been in there from
                           bloody five o'clock and wants to stay till eleven
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4470] Well that's it.
Barry (PS03W)              [4471] or twelve, then fine, let them.

Barry (PS03W)              [4474] you know, I mean
Barry (PS03W)              [4475] So you could either come in half eight, half
                           nine or [...]
Barry (PS03W)              [4476] That's right.

                           ... you know ... cheaper than saving theirselves two

Barry (PS03W)              [4494] We're getting complicated aren't we?
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4495] Why can't we do it, to me, cost effective.
Barry (PS03W)              [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)              [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4496] Torture.
Barry (PS03W)              [4497] Complicating issues.
Barry (PS03W)              [4498] I remember ... at the Uni when we used to
                           give ... we used to put stamps on people, you know,
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4499] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4500] for pass outs and that or anything

                           end I've, what we ought to do is ... lop some part
                           of their anatomy off, like a little digit or
                           something then we can prove they've been in
Barry (PS03W)              [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)              [4503] eventually, after about two years when you
                           get this sort of ... armless, legless cor
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4504] Oh oh! [laugh]

Barry (PS03W)              [4508] Well it's like, like a ... all you want to do
                           is [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [laugh]
Barry (PS03W)              [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4509] That's what you get, [...] ... you just gotta
                           stand or you went downstairs to another bar
Barry (PS03W)              [4510] Yeah,th the trouble is you're
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4511] and got a stamp
Barry (PS03W)              [4512] you
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4513] and they would
Barry (PS03W)              [4514] you, you're doing it in the same ... room
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4515] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4516] aren't you?
                           [4517] That's the [...] .
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4518] That is as well.
Barry (PS03W)              [4519] But I ... I dunno, I ... see it's not ...
                           once you're u actually up here, looking ... I think
                           it's different when you're up here looking back as
                           when you're over there looking up here.
Barry (PS03W)              [4520] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4521] It's not quite as cold and empty as
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4522] If it got going you'd probably use mo ...
                           another, another half of area, you know
Barry (PS03W)              [4523] Yeah, yeah, you want
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4524] you don't wanna close it off.
                           [4525] But, like you say maybe just ... just a bit
                           of wrought
Barry (PS03W)              [4526] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4527] ironwork
Barry (PS03W)              [4528] Yeah.
                           [4529] I think so.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4530] to just
Barry (PS03W)              [4531] I think you do I think that would look good
                           anyway ... and
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4532] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4533] and it would also enable you to ... quickly
                           and easily do something on the erm ... on the, on
                           the private functions night to make it look ...
                           different.
Barry (PS03W)              [4534] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4535] I mean, I wouldn't suggest putting
Barry (PS03W)              [...]
Barry (PS03W)              [4536] plants up and everything ... for our normal
                           ... you know, rock nights, I mean we just ... have
                           the wrought iron up and whatever, but
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4537] I mean, with them sort of then
Barry (PS03W)              [4538] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4539] once you got erm tied into these you can
Barry (PS03W)              [4540] Oh yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4541] do whatever to the thing.
Barry (PS03W)              [4542] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4543] But it would give you affect.
Barry (PS03W)              [4544] That's right.
                           [4545] I mean, those are just ... we just went out
                           and chucked a few fucking trees down.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4546] They're not real then Barry?
Barry (PS03W)              [4547] No, the trees are ... the er ... things tied
                           on to them aren't.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4548] Oh.
Barry (PS03W)              [4549] But er
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4550] Yeah.
                           [4551] ... I think, it's quite actually, it needs a
                           bit of character.
Barry (PS03W)              [4552] I mean, that'll cover
Barry (PS03W)              [4553] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4554] if you did that in quite a few places
Barry (PS03W)              [4555] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4556] throughout the room it would cover your
                           cracks and your holes
Barry (PS03W)              [4557] Ye
Barry (PS03W)              [4558] and your, your [...] .
Barry (PS03W)              [4559] I mean, what we initially wanted to do with
                           all this was cover this whole area in, in greenery
                           and have this as a sort of restaurant ta type.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4560] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4561] I mean, again, it's ideas when you're sat
Barry (PS03W)              [4562] It's ideas.
Barry (PS03W)              [4563] planning, before you've actually moved in and
                           get
Barry (PS03W)              [4564] It is.
                           [4565] Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Barry (PS03W)              [4566] and get ... and then, then you start
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS03W)              [4567] that's, that's the other thing when there's
                           only two of you involved ... and you, we were
                           opening for that first sort of eighteen months ...
                           five, six days a week ... just keeping on top of a
                           day to day business doesn't allow you to sit back
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4568] No, I know that.
Barry (PS03W)              [4569] and expand it, and whereas, you know, that,
                           that's one area that'd be great with having yo your
                           involvement
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4570] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4571] that you go in and say well ... you know
Barry (PS03W)              [4572] It sounds like this sort of thing
Barry (PS03W)              [4573] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [...]
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4574] When did you paint all this green?
Barry (PS03W)              [4575] It was when I was working for Walt Disney, so
                           it'll be ... two years ago.
                           [4576] Two years
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4577] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4578] ago.
                           [4579] I was over in Belfast and I came back and it
                           were green.
                           [4580] It was alri it's, it's actually lasted
                           reasonably well considering it hadn't been
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4581] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4582] for two years.

                           something that you can say well ... you know, that'd
                           be one of our objectives

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4770] [...] ... He paid it.

Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4773] Lucky.
Barry (PS03W)              [4774] lucky.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4775] Yeah I know.
Barry (PS03W)              [4776] He didn't half go for a lot again.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4777] Yes we did seem to be quite lucky to keep

Barry (PS03W)              [4778] Yeah.
                           [4779] But I, I, I'm amazed that breweries keep
                           lending him money!
Barry (PS03W)              [4780] I know.
Barry (PS03W)              [4781] I mean, it's unbelievable, you know th er,
                           he's done so many breweries and yet why they don't
                           talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one
                           another.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4782] Because you get people like Ben who's giving
                           his money he doesn't really give a toss!
Barry (PS03W)              [4783] He don't give a toss.
Barry (PS03W)              [4784] Mm.
Barry (PS03W)              [4785] As long as he's got an installation going in
                           and if it
Barry (PS03W)              [4786] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W)              [4787] if it gets written off or
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [4788] Gets bigger.

                           has to take a big lot off.
Unknown speaker (KBDPSUNK) [...]
Barry (PS03W)              [4790] It's par for the course really.
Barry (PS03W)              [4791] Mm.

              they've now found it's gone further in [...] seven years ... she,
              you know, she was
Hugh (PS03Y)  [whistling]
Terri (PS03X) [4903] forgotten all about it, anyway ... she found a little dent
              ... apparently our Laura said that's just as bad as finding
              lumps.
              [4904] She just went and said I've got this ... you know, check
              up, cos she knew she was going to Christies for her final check
              up ... and, they've whizzed her in.
              [4905] Got to ... do another operation and remove all the glands
              from under her arm.
              [4906] So ... it's not as though they're gonna get anyone to come
              [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [4907] No.
Terri (PS03X) [4908] I mean I ... I obviously hadn't said that to her.
Barry (PS03W) [4909] Oh no!

Terri (PS03X) [4911] But er ... she said she'd been feeling a bit rough
              recently.
              [4912] But she never suspecting it was, you know, when they'd
              been alright for seven years you
Hugh (PS03Y)  [whistling]
Terri (PS03X) [4913] you think you're alright don't you?
              [4914] So she's, going in ... today.
              [4915] Erm ... so I'm gonna go in this afternoon to see her.
              [4916] See if they've taken any ... [...] .

Barry (PS03W) [4928] You know like you being all pathetic.
Terri (PS03X) [4929] No.
              [4930] Well, a bit I intend carrying on as the ... parliamentary
              candidate ... and somebody had obviously asked Dave why it is
              something has nothing whatsoever to do with the constituency.
              [4931] That was last time's agent.
              [4932] And he said, oh well it's probably being discussed at the
              next meeting.
              [4933] Well he's under a lot [...] or else he won't.
              [4934] Still ... he won't come if he thinks there's any ...
              messing about.
              [4935] I mean,i it would be ... zilch for the Labour Party to try
              and swap candidates now.
              [4936] You know ... it would be just stupid wouldn't it?
Barry (PS03W) [4937] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [4938] Mm.

              [4941] I mean I don't know Dave 's just not ... That's stupid!
              [4942] Why make any comment whatsoever?
Terri (PS03X) [4943] Yeah.
              [4944] Why not just keep quiet?
              [4945] So, you know ... cos it just says all candidates receiving
              [...] .
Hugh (PS03Y)  [whistling]
Terri (PS03X) [4946] I mean Labour can't win either way.
              [4947] They've got to hope that it'll be resolved before then.
              [4948] If they put another candidate in ... it's ... doesn't do
              Labour's name any good does it?
Barry (PS03W) [4949] Mm.
              [4950] Well it's a
Terri (PS03X) [4951] It's a waste
Barry (PS03W) [4952] enough of these ad pamphlets.
              [4953] Guilt?
Terri (PS03X) [4954] Well it's, it's been looking as though you're ... you're
              guilty

              conference.

              stay at the Claremont you see.
Barry (PS03W) [5143] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5144] She said I've got, only got three twin rooms left in the

              [5152] It's Jean here.
              [5153] I ... yes, I've just had my massive little row with The
              Savoy ... about the prices and they just wanted to charge us the
              normal price!
              [5154] So I've said they can get stood on.
              [5155] And I booked at the Claremont ... which is, twenty eight
              pounds.
              [5156] Well, I'm not being prepared to be held to ransom by them.
              [5157] And I'm, I'm faxing ... erm ... I'm sorry, I'm not gonna
              fax it, I'm just going to send a letter to national office ...
              about The Savoy in First Leisure.
              [5158] Because they can't do this to delegates!
              [5159] Cos they did it with you last year didn't they?
              [5160] Mm.
              [5161] ... Yeah.
              [5162] Yeah.
              [5163] Well, I think we should tell national office that this is,
              you know, this is happening and it's not on!
              [5164] ... I've got ... I'll tell you what I've got, I've got for

              to book!
              [5165] You know, cos I'd got it at a P P C as well, for national
              conference.
              [5166] So I've actually two you see.
              [5167] So ... erm ... I'm sending one back to national office
              saying, these hotels are sending confirmation at the full price
              for local government conference.
              [5168] Now ... I, I've rung the Claremont and they've said, oh
              yes, it's the conference erm ... you know ... amount ... and
              we're very,appar we were, I was very lucky cos we got the last
              three rooms.
              [5169] And she said, we're absolutely booked up!
              [5170] But, you see Bob told me about it, he said, well he, you
              know ... booked at the Claremont because he'd had problems
              getting prices out of the others.
              [5171] But, our union always stay at the Claremont and we've
              always found it, you know, okay.
              [5172] But I'm, I'm not paying sixty five quid a night!
              [5173] It's just stupid Francis!
              [5174] Cos you're never in it.
              [5175] I mean, you always go to ... you know, somewhere else
              don't you?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [whistling]
Terri (PS03X) [5176] I didn't ask Francis, so just let me tell you ... erm ...
              they were when I went, it's A, B, D, E, and it's got all the
              letters next to them.
              [5177] You know, they say there's a full range of facilities ...
              and ... I'm just looking ... A is central, bedroom, I'll tell
              you, I'll, I'll, I'll, we'll whiz through them.

              just to go all through this, disabled facilities, L ... separate
              [...] ... M ... bedrooms available with private telephones in,
              it's N, number of bedrooms available with ... private bathroom
              and toilet or shower and toilet.
              [5179] And that's what it says.
              [5180] It was, was when I went Francis.
              [5181] Night porter, Q is lifts to all floor, and S is swimming
              pool ... and I know there's a swimming pool because ... not that
              I ever used it, but ... ma it, it was when I booked Francis.
              [5182] It's right on the prom on the corner on, on North Prom.
              [5183] It's not far from the Imperial Francis.
              [5184] So ... but it was erm ... just go on that bit of the prom,
              it's huge!
              [5185] It's a huge hotel on the corner.
              [5186] You can't miss it.
              [5187] I'll, I'll give you the o the address anyway.
              [5188] Erm, two hundred and seventy North Prom.
              [5189] ... Yeah.
              [5190] Two seventy North Prom.
              [5191] Erm, and you just say what ... yeah, two seventy North
              Prom.
              [5192] It's, it's pa just past, if you keep going past the
              Pembroke ... it's there.
              [5193] But erm ... that's right, going out.
              [5194] Yes.
              [5195] It's just past there.
              [5196] You can't lose it Francis, cos it's one of the major
              hotels.
              [5197] Yeah.
              [5198] They've got, they've got lots of bars, there's a bar in
              the basement and there's bars upstairs, and a dance floor and a
              swimming pool and ... I'm sure it will Francis.
              [5199] I mean ... yeah, well I don't blame him.
              [5200] But it says ... number of bedrooms available with private
              bathroom and toilet, or shower and toilet.
              [5201] There are very few hotels of this standard that don't have
              showers and toilets.
              [5202] So ... it's twenty eight Francis, which is, I think is ...
              yes.
              [5203] Yes.
              [5204] Well, it doesn't matter where we go to eat does it?
              [5205] And we, can go and eat wherever we want.
              [5206] Oh!
              [5207] But ... th you can have bed and breakfast and evening meal
              if you want.
              [5208] Erm, but generally,ye I mean cos Eileen and I go to a
              [...] ... we nearly always go somewhere like Carriages or ... you
              know, somewhere Italian ... which is, you know, it might, it all
              depends on what Jim's eating at the time.
              [5209] But, but ... you can't go wrong, there's plenty to eat in
              Blackpool can you?
              [5210] In fact, I'm trying to think of a place that erm ... we
              once went when we ... at regional conference, it was behind the
              Claremont somewhere.
              [5211] It was a ... it was a ... little Italian restaurant with
              about forty six ... and we went at regional conference and it was
              astounding!
              [5212] It was a really brilliant chef!
              [5213] I'll try and get Bob to find the ... the number of it.
              [5214] Cos that was really ... a really nice place.
              [5215] But, you wouldn't have expected to find it where you found
              it.
              [5216] No.
              [5217] You know the road behind the promenade?
              [5218] It was on that road.
              [5219] And we only found it by chance, you know how you go off to
              ... think oh I'll, I'll go and find a coffee or something, and we
              found this restaurant at lunch time and had a coffee there ...
              and we looked at the menu and, you know, we, we couldn't believe
              it!
              [5220] Yeah.
              [5221] Well I'll try, I'll try and get Bob to remember the name
              of it.
              [5222] Alright.
              [5223] And so I'll see you when we get there Francis.
              [5224] I said we'll a probably arrive early afternoon.
              [5225] So ... no ... doesn't ... well you know what he'll be
              like, he'll be messing about all day.

              [5232] That's alright.

              staying with us, and Eileen and I are staying.

              [5237] And I know that Bob and Sue have booked at the Claremont
              so there'll be quite a few of us there.
              [5238] So, I'll, I'll keep an eye on us.
              [5239] And I'll go and have a look at your room.

              before he gets there.

Terri (PS03X) [5249] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5250] Well they said, the number of rooms ... didn't it?
              [5251] Didn't say all rooms.
              [5252] And if you've got the last three I can't believe that the
              last three are en suite.
Terri (PS03X) [5253] I only need one en suite.
Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Terri (PS03X) [laugh]
Barry (PS03W) [5254] [laughing] That's what I thought [] !
Terri (PS03X) [5255] It'll be two rooms and a bath or a shower.
              [5256] ... Shall I ring back?
Barry (PS03W) [5257] I stayed at the Claremont when I was down doing [...] and

Barry (PS03W) [5262] moved a whole delegation if it weren't en suite.
Terri (PS03X) [5263] Yeah.

              crisis.

Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Terri (PS03X) [5299] [...] ... [phonecall starts] The answer is yes, they all
              are.
              [5300] Ah!
              [5301] Francis I had a little panic then, and I decided to ring
              [laughing] them back [] .
              [5302] But, no ... yeah ... yeah ... well, I thought, I thought
              I'd better ... be safe, yeah.
              [5303] I don't want a weekend with Jim where I, I'm in trouble
              [laughing] all weekend [] !
              [5304] Oh don't Francis!
              [5305] I mean er, I'd, I'd never have lived it down.
              [5306] ... Yeah.
              [5307] Well that's what he'd say to me, why didn't find out
              first?
              [5308] So, anyway, you're reduced from, [laugh] ... so it's en
              suite.
              [5309] Yeah.
              [5310] She said ... exactly Francis!
              [5311] Well we'll spend it on food and drink Francis.
              [5312] [laugh] ... But erm ... er, I feel a lot more comfortable
              cos I think sixty five pounds a night's outrageous!
              [5313] For just spending ... well, for us, when we're just,
              you're only there for ... your breakfast aren't you?
              [5314] You never go back again.
              [5315] So ... because we'll be able to have lunch at British Home
              Stores.
              [5316] [laugh] ... [laughing] We'll not be able to break with
              tradition [] .
              [5317] Geoff will insist that we go to British Home Stores for,
              well we'll, if, if we we're with Geoff and Louise, that's where
              we generally go to lunch, and ... it's really nice!
              [5318] It's a lovely ... self-service [laughing] in Blackpool []
              .
              [5319] But ... [laugh] ... you know the Labour Party is worse
              than the Conservatives for traditions aren't they?
              [5320] Mm.
              [5321] Anyway, look ... I'll find out from Bob about this
              restaurant and ... see if there's a possibility that it might be
              worth booking before I go.
              [5322] But I know that Jim's going to have to [...] .
              [5323] And I ... I don't want to spend all night chasing round
              Blackpool looking for ... for a place that serves ordinary food
              of a decent ... standard.
              [5324] Right Francis.
              [5325] I'll leave on that note.

Barry (PS03W) [5335] Fill it up.

Barry (PS03W) [5365] You can't, can't
Terri (PS03X) [5366] It
Barry (PS03W) [5367] remember what it's called?
Terri (PS03X) [5368] I know!
              [5369] I just can't.
              [5370] Bob'll know.
Barry (PS03W) [5371] Well you probably, I mean you, you as, you as well, so ...
              I mean, you probably won't
Terri (PS03X) [5372] No he's
Barry (PS03W) [5373] be able to get there till this evening and you probably
              won't be able to see him will you?
Terri (PS03X) [5374] No.
              [5375] Well a as long as he knows I'm looking for him.
              [5376] They erm ... wa when we to we, we were staying at the
              Claremont ... and ... I don't, oh, I think we just decided we'd
              find a cup of coffee.
              [5377] It was M S F thing, we were with Margaret about the ... M
              S F.
              [5378] And ... said, oh, let's go and find a cup of coffee ...
              but, have a bit of a walk and walk down to conference but we'll
              not walk down the prom
Barry (PS03W) [5379] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5380] we'll walk down the road at the back ... and we'd only
              just turned round the corner from the Claremont and we found this
              restaurant ... and it was, it was an absolutely brilliant chef,
              really nice restaurant, really high quality ... and it was ...
              was ... quite reasonable price, it wasn't cheap.
Barry (PS03W) [5381] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5382] So, when we found this we thought ooh, this is alright!
              [5383] You know, we'll ... so we've been quite a few times since,
              but I cannot think of the name of it.
              [5384] You see, Jim doesn't like, I mean, we'd go to Carriages
              probably ... cos it's a ... a proper Italian
Barry (PS03W) [5385] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5386] that absolutely reeks with garlic and ... all the rest of
              it.
              [5387] Well ... that means Jim will pull a face!
              [5388] Or he'll start going
Barry (PS03W) [5389] Oh, this big international financier!
Terri (PS03X) [5390] Oh!
              [5391] No!
              [5392] Not, I mean, is the, when it comes down to food ... wi
              he's a traditionalist.
              [5393] So we've always got to find somewhere to eat that's
Barry (PS03W) [5394] You're gonna be pushed getting, you know, roast beef and
              Yorkshire in Brussels aren't you?
Terri (PS03X) [5395] God knows!
Barry (PS03W) [5396] Steak and kidney pie!
Terri (PS03X) [5397] You're joking!
              [5398] Cos everybody sort of, just try to think, think of in
              Brussels.
              [5399] Why they go, they go to er ... a six course sort of have
              as much main course as you like.
              [5400] It's a ... a ... a re a really nice restaurant ... but you
              can pick all your food raw ... and they just, there's a chef
              cooking, and you just get one of these plates, you can have as
              many helpings as you want, they serve you a cold starter and a
              hot starter ... but there's ... a buffet that's about ... half
              the size of our club ... and one side of it it's all ... fish on
              a wet fish slab, and steak, and veal, and chicken and ... so
              there's every sort of meat you can think of, and you can pick a
              wooden platter full of it, so you go and give it the chef with
              this number that they give you ... and then they come serve you
              with whatever you want.
              [5401] And you can have as many helpings of whatever you want.
              [5402] And the salad stuff ... and fresh fruit and all that sort
              of thing, takes ... about the full length of our bar up ... you
              know, you, you couldn't think of a salad that isn't there.
              [5403] But you can't, and there's, then there's loads of hot veg.
Barry (PS03W) [5404] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5405] There's no vegetables you can't mention.
              [5406] I think it's about twenty quid a head, but you can
              actually have as many meals as you want, or as many puddings as
              you want.
Barry (PS03W) [5407] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5408] It's ... it really is ... really very, very good.
              [5409] The Labour Party came to ... to use that quite a lot.
              [5410] Because ... they've got ... big seating areas as well,
              where they put, sort of eight tables together and all your party
              can sit together.
Barry (PS03W) [5411] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5412] When we were there ... Stan was with us and he'd ... been
              a few times to Brussels ... to with the Labour Party and, and he
              said oh it's great!
              [5413] Because ... usually you go off to a restaurant and if
              there's twenty of you ... you can't sit together can you?
Barry (PS03W) [5414] No.
              [5415] No.
Terri (PS03X) [5416] But, he said, this restaurant makes a particular thing of
              ... seating big parties.
              [5417] It was a brilliant restaurant!
              [5418] Really ... really ... nice.
              [5419] So ... you know
Barry (PS03W) [5420] Sergio's going to erm ... erm ... one, some Cubs visit to
              London at er ... half term.
Terri (PS03X) [5421] Baden Powell House?
Barry (PS03W) [5422] Yeah, but the
Terri (PS03X) [5423] Mary took it.
              [5424] It's brilliant!
              [5425] Absolutely great!
Barry (PS03W) [5426] And er, so she said ... she, she wants to take the last
              couple of days away
Terri (PS03X) [5427] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [5428] so she's, her aunty's going to Dublin, so I got these
              things and they were really cheap actually.

              ferry, transfers to their hotel ... the best hotel in Dublin, The
              Burlington
Terri (PS03X) [5430] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [5431] is absolutely stupendous!
              [5432] Two nights bed and breakfast, full Irish breakfast, which
              means [laughing] you won't need to eat until the evening [] !
Terri (PS03X) [5433] You won't eat again.
              [5434] No.
Barry (PS03W) [5435] Erm ... train, free bus passes round Dublin, includes
              their bus fares and, and train on those sort of metro type thing
Terri (PS03X) [5436] Yeah.

Terri (PS03X) [5438] Eh?
Barry (PS03W) [5439] I know.
Terri (PS03X) [5440] Why?
Barry (PS03W) [5441] The only problem is, that the hotel that Mary's like, ah!
              [5442] This looks beautiful.
              [5443] Cos I, I, that second hotel, [...] hotel, the only thing,
              is the Burlington.
              [5444] And I daren't, I'm not gonna tell her, but I, I, I'm
              trying to say, well, it's a little bit out, it's in a park and
              er,th th but it looks gorgeous!
              [5445] I said, yeah I know.

Terri (PS03X) [laugh]
Barry (PS03W) [5447] So I'm going, oh no!

              it's absolutely gorgeous!
              [5451] And it was, it was about two hundred pounds a night and
              got it for ten pounds a night.
              [5452] [laugh] ... That was about, well, ten years ago, when ...
              well ... well it's really appropriate.
              [5453] So I think, well ... this is a, this is actually on
              O'Connell Street, that's right in the centre.
              [5454] But I mean, that's actually th th one, one of the, that
              was the, the, the other ones like four star hotels were on
              O'Connell Street which actually opens [...] ... only seventy
              seven quid.

              she doesn't erm ... she, we could refuse to adopt, but she's over
              there personally.
              [5620] Erm, I'm in two minds about what to do.
              [5621] I could ... name names and say ... because this is not a
              party decision, it's
Barry (PS03W) [5622] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5623] Dave , Steve , etcetera, and [...] .
              [5624] Now, who's Dave ?
              [5625] ... Senior employee of the City Council
Barry (PS03W) [5626] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5627] meeting with ... the leader of the Labour group who's ...
              supposedly doing all this to protect his wife.
              [5628] The reason he's married to her ... I mean, even [...] .
              [5629] I could, I could really throw the dirt at them ... by
              saying that I'll, you know, if there is a conspiracy ... there's,
              a person here who's been involved in a very iffy part of the
              budget, who all of a sudden after ten years of ... slagging off
              the town clerk, all of a sudden he's totally on the town clerk's
              side, together with ... Councillor .
              [5630] Why?
              [5631] The only person who's involved in both, allowing the town
              clerk to take these decisions, without any ... interference at
              all
Barry (PS03W) [5632] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5633] and now conspiring with a senior employee of the council,
              and of course, [...] .
              [5634] Just not so.
Barry (PS03W) [5635] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5636] All of a sudden this erm ... worry about this budget
              heading, is being swept under the carpets and everybody being
              told is all in been er ... cleared up.
              [5637] It's Dave [...] .
              [5638] I'd fire him.
Barry (PS03W) [5639] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5640] I could really make this into a very great conspiracy for
              [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [5641] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5642] Apart from which, this meeting that they're supposed to be
              going to have ... is totally out of order anyway.
              [5643] Cos nobody's been sent any notices for it or notified
              about it.
              [5644] So I mean, I, I could
Barry (PS03W) [5645] What the hell are they doing now!
Terri (PS03X) [5646] get the full meeting cance I mean, you get Ashdown
              yesterday, his party rally round him like
Barry (PS03W) [5647] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5648] royalty's going of fashion!
              [5649] You get, I mean, Dave and Steve , alright, they've never
              been my favourite people ... but ... all this pious goings-on
              with Dave , how much he hates the town clerk, and whatever
              opportunity he could get ... he would
Barry (PS03W) [5650] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5651] take.
Barry (PS03W) [5652] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5653] First opportunity, real opportunity he gets ... he's ...
              doing everything the town clerk wants him to do.
Barry (PS03W) [5654] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5655] I just, I, I, honestly Barry, I've got to the stage where
              I believe in this conspiracy [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [5656] Mm.
              [5657] ... Well certainly some people want ... some answers want
              to be given on this ... budget, er me as well, I mean, he can't
              just suddenly say
Terri (PS03X) [5658] Well
Barry (PS03W) [5659] it's all been sorted out, don't worry about it.
Terri (PS03X) [5660] Well ... I think it will be really stupid.
              [5661] [...] ... But I shall say ... Dave ...
Barry (PS03W) [5662] And how long [...] ?
              [5663] Well I park
Terri (PS03X) [5664] I'll put
Barry (PS03W) [5665] er
Terri (PS03X) [5666] I'll drop you off.
              [5667] Cos I want to go home and [...] , I've got to home cos
              I've ... I've a stack of paperwork on my table.
              [5668] I'm not gonna be able to set off much later on remember
              because
Barry (PS03W) [...]
Terri (PS03X) [5669] There's no point in me getting
Barry (PS03W) [5670] Nope.
Terri (PS03X) [5671] I'll have to go up to shop to get some shopping cos
              there's ... nothing to eat in the house.
              [5672] So I'll have to do something [...] .
              [5673] ... Alright Barry? [...]
Barry (PS03W) [5674] I just wonder what on earth they're, they're playing at
              with ... ha, cha cha cha cha cha cha.
              [5675] You know, I just don't understand what they're playing but
              th you know
Terri (PS03X) [5676] They
Barry (PS03W) [5677] they can only be doing ... damage to th to the election
              chances I mean
Terri (PS03X) [5678] Well they
Barry (PS03W) [5679] they can't be achieving anything else!
Terri (PS03X) [5680] I mean saying things like ... a successor has already been
              identified.
              [5681] I mean ... it's just stupid!
              [5682] Cos the general view in Morecambe isn't what they say it
              is.
Barry (PS03W) [5683] Yeah, but it gives the impression there's a split group
              innit?
Terri (PS03X) [5684] Well, you give the impression of a ... a faction in the
              party, now ... I could, I could serve this faction quite easily
              ... to ... Mike who'd give me a lot of say ... if I said, you
              know,th the ... the plot thickens, you know, here's a town
Barry (PS03W) [5685] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5686] hall employee
Barry (PS03W) [5687] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5688] always an opponent of the town clerk ... also now ... erm
              ... trying to cause problems.
Barry (PS03W) [5689] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5690] I mean, that really does make the plot thicken ... doesn't
              it?
Barry (PS03W) [5691] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5692] I mean, why was Dave being quoted for [...] , what has it
              got to with Dave ?
              [5693] He's not an officer of the constitut he isn't a treasurer,
              he isn't secretary, he's, he's nothing ... as far the
              constituency's concerned.
              [5694] They, if they want any quotes why don't they go and see
              chairman, who's Terry?
Barry (PS03W) [5695] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5696] I mean, this is them deliberately saying things to their
              friends ... and deliberately stirring it.
              [5697] They, oh!
              [5698] Because, I mean, I know where it's coming from, some of
              it's coming from Stanley , who, who thinks ... if I don't stand
              down it will damage Ruth's chances.
              [5699] That's not Ruth's own view of it.
              [5700] Well it, and I don't think with the News of the World
              round their necks they can afford to start playing silly people.
              [5701] Because I'm, you know, if they sa if they keep crossing me
              the way they are, quite frankly I'm ... you know, willing to make
              remarks myself.
              [5702] Although I don't want to do damaging things, but ... I
              don't see why I should be the person con cons constantly getting
              the flack from a group of people who were ... you know.
Barry (PS03W) [5703] Yeah.
Terri (PS03X) [5704] Who are genuinely trying to do damage to the party.
              [5705] ... So do you want me to call at the 's now?
Barry (PS03W) [5706] Yeah.
              [5707] There's, may as well.
              [5708] ... Well, don't know.
              [5709] Well it doesn't really matter, I'll, I'll be ... I mean,
              what, so ... I mean there's ... except for seeing Anne there's
              nothing more to do is there?
Terri (PS03X) [5710] Well except to start getting that rubbish cleared away.
Barry (PS03W) [5711] Well I can't put it away.
              [5712] Don't want a pile in the cellar when carpet delivery
              comes.
Terri (PS03X) [5713] No, but I pu put it next to the lift ... and as soon as
              Hughey comes ... put it outside and when I come back I'll take it
              away.
Barry (PS03W) [5714] No you won't cos I'm meeting Ellial at, at half three.
Terri (PS03X) [5715] Well I mean, I should be back for half past two.
              [5716] I mean, if you want to just put it in that dustbin place
              and we'll take it tomorrow.
Barry (PS03W) [5717] Mm.
Terri (PS03X) [5718] You know, the washing up machine and everything, all, all
              of that needs cleaning out, all behind the bar needs cleaning.
              [5719] We're giving people a very bad impression if we're opening
              tonight and ... nothing's been cleared up.
              [5720] I think I'll go for it Barry.
              [5721] I'll, I'll go and see where he is, and say, you know ...
              That washing up and everything wants doing before tonight so you,
              so if you're gonna say ... oh, we're open tonight and the place
              still looks like a pig stye!
              [5722] It ain't gonna give a very good impression.
Barry (PS03W) [5723] Well he's not gonna want to, he's not,sha I mean he's ...
              it's not a meeting to look around the place is it really?
Terri (PS03X) [5724] Well it is.
              [5725] That's what they're coming for.
              [5726] That's one of the things Richard is coming for, to look
              round.
              [5727] We'll come and have a good look round, I've never seen it.
              [5728] ... I mean, er, you know what that's to do with don't you?
              [5729] The repairs notice.
              [5730] Even if we only got all those old tickets and things into
              green bags and started cleaning that out it would ... it would
              look as though we're making some ... effort.
              [5731] Er, if I can get ... the and get him to come in ...
              reasonably soon, you know, I'll ring you and tell you whether
              he's in.
              [5732] If we could get him to come in reasonably quickly ... you
              could get all that stuff down and bagged up and we could get rid
              of it couldn't we?
Barry (PS03W) [5733] Which which tickets are you talking about?
Terri (PS03X) [5734] Well all the old tickets and stuff, I mean, alright

Hugh (PS03Y)  [5952] Oh right!
              [5953] Yeah, course.
Barry (PS03W) [5954] and then make it
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5955] Rhona's husband?
Barry (PS03W) [5956] Yeah.
              [5957] Ex-husband, yeah.
              [5958] Erm, and having a carpet tile ... because we can then do
              it red, white, and, not white, but red and blue ... you know.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5959] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5960] And, if you
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5961] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5962] damage a tile, then you're only replacing a tile.
              [5963] And just sort of carpet the two top areas, two raised
              areas, and have the other, the rest of it as a sort of lino ...
              floor.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5964] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [5965] So then, then it, allows to dance as well, and basically
              ... hardly anybody sits in that area until the club's full anyway
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5966] Mm mm.
Barry (PS03W) [5967] so that they all go in the [...] .
              [5968] Erm, going to somehow, at the moment we're thinking of ...
              well Jean'll wanna do it, but I'm ... I'm thinking of doing some
              kind of ... I mean, we're agreed on what we're gonna do, but it's
              how we do it, I want some ka er, some kind of grilling around the
              top, the cocktail bar area, so you can open it as a, as a bar,
              and it'll have a sort of atmosphere in itself, so we open that as
              a pub type of thing, you know.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5969] Oh right!
              [5970] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [...]
Barry (PS03W) [5971] Leave the big screen on and that and we can put ... erm
              ... and get, you know, as I say, if you
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5972] Do you
Barry (PS03W) [5973] you get, see if we can get hold of like, I mean you won't
              be able to get hold of a Wurlitzer because nowadays they're like
              gold dust, but you might be able to get hold of parts, you see.
              [5974] If you could just get hold of say, the rainbow
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5975] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5976] effect of a Wurli I mean, that's the beauty about it ...
              you, you'll never get hold of a Harley Davidson, but you might
              get hold of a petrol cap.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5977] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5978] You know, or things
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5979] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5980] like that, you know
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5981] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5982] and you just bang those around the place.
              [5983] Er, a few handlebars and whatever else and, but, but ...
              but don't do it like the British bikers, do it like an American
              ... bar, so it can be cleaned and
Hugh (PS03Y)  [...]
Barry (PS03W) [5984] I mean it can look nice and
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5985] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [5986] sparkling and fiftiesey, and ... lots of ... pictures and
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5987] Not the dirty bloody smell and greasy [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [5988] No, that's right, yeah.
              [5989] That's right.
              [5990] You see, and then if, if, if, if, if sort of people are,
              you know, holiday makers come in, and it's an American theme,
              they expect it.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5991] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [5992] As I say, they expect I've got music, it's not gonna come
              as a shock to them.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5993] They've got [...]
Barry (PS03W) [5994] You know, and it'll, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I
              think.
              [5995] And, and it won't cost a lot to do, cos all you do instead
              of green, you'll paint that red ... and you've got the white pick
              out anyway, and a blue, seated blue carpet.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5996] I wondered what those fucking [...] !
Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Hugh (PS03Y)  [5997] No, where am I gonna be able to get rid of this?
Barry (PS03W) [5998] I don't know.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [laugh]
Barry (PS03W) [5999] I think we'll have to, I think we've got to keep it cos I
              think it's part of the fixtures and fittings unfortunately.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [laugh] [cough]
Barry (PS03W) [6000] And I'm gonna do er, you know, lots of ... promotions and
              stuff ... promotions [...] on that
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6001] And then your promotions, yeah?
Barry (PS03W) [6002] Yeah.

              [6004] We well what I think I'm gonna do is next Thur not this
              Thursday, we'll just have to live through this Thursday, but next
              Thursday, erm ... I'm gonna get ... get Stella back on, and I'm
              just gonna sell it as cost, whatever it is, sixty P a pint or

Hugh (PS03Y)  [6005] [...] ?
Barry (PS03W) [6006] Yeah.
              [6007] I mean, cos at the end of the day if you've got the, if
              you've got, if you can get er sixty people
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6008] You'll [...]
Barry (PS03W) [6009] two fifty to come in, I don't mind if I'm giving the booze

Hugh (PS03Y)  [6011] As long as you're not losing on it.
              [6012] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6013] Well it doesn't matter does it?
              [6014] You know ... cos that's the only way we're gonna build
              Thursdays up.

Hugh (PS03Y)  [laugh]
Barry (PS03W) [6028] Er ... but, you know, I, I'd, as I say, I think er ... and
              then if we just, if we can just pick up like the odd ... I mean,
              I've, I've had a ... long chat with Anne, we've had a long, erm
              meeting with Anne yesterday about it, and she's gonna start
              pushing ... cos you know, she's really done the Royal upstairs,
              it's
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6029] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [6030] a really beautiful room, but it only holds about forty,
              fifty people, what she's gonna do is push the weddings, but she's
              gonna, and say look, you can use this place

              wedding to do a disco, he said well I can't it's a Saturday, and
              then he said well, you know, where are you having the reception,

*** 18 (Tape 064206) ***
Barry (PS03W) [6383] You know when we, we, when we first opened from a dead
              start ... right?
              [6384] The first fifty five weeks ... which is
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6385] Just over a year.
Barry (PS03W) [6386] a year ... we did na on the bar did ninety thousand quid.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6387] Jesus!
Barry (PS03W) [6388] The next five months ... less than half a year ... af the
              next five months after that right?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6389] When Jean stopped doing her silly things?
Barry (PS03W) [6390] Yeah.
              [6391] Well, yeah, when ... whe er er a after that first year the
              next five months ... seventy nine thousand!
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6392] Fucking hell!
Barry (PS03W) [6393] In five months.
              [6394] So if we'd have carried on at that
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6395] So you would have like, you would have well doubled that.
Barry (PS03W) [6396] Yeah.
              [6397] I mean tha th we, it, have been
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6398] Five months you would have equalled [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [6399] Well I think we'd have gone to ... two hundred thousand.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6400] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6401] But that, at the end of that period was when Volks
              recalled the loan.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6402] Aye.
              [6403] And
Barry (PS03W) [6404] And
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6405] you were buying seventy off them or something?
Barry (PS03W) [6406] Yeah.
              [6407] But er, but when
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6408] You were getting all your orders from them at that time?
Barry (PS03W) [6409] Yeah.
              [6410] But when Volks recalled the loan ... we sort of give up.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6411] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6412] I, we went two day week opening and not publicizing it,
              everything.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6413] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6414] So if we'd have just carried on the way that was going, I
              mean, that got it from ninety thousand in ... just over a year
              ... to, to seventy nine thousand in five months.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [6415] Jesus!
              [6416] It's amazing!
Barry (PS03W) [6417] Know what I mean, like we didn't want

              nothing [...] !

Hugh (PS03Y)  [6437] Well I'll leave it here.
Barry (PS03W) [6438] Er

              aren't they?
Alan (PS040)  [6645] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6646] Whatever!
              [6647] You know, I mean we just got them cheap ... erm ...
              lampshades from now on er cos it's not worth it cos th the
              expensive ones are just getting damaged all the time.
Alan (PS040)  [6648] We could shorten them anyway and just put lamps on them.
Barry (PS03W) [6649] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6650] Whatever.
              [6651] If you don't hang them on Gerry's ... thingy anyway.

              [6653] That's right.
              [6654] ... See, if you sort of somehow trellis that area, that
              side in you could actually have this mo more intimate if people
              just wanted to
Alan (PS040)  [6655] Snog!
Barry (PS03W) [6656] sit in here.
              [6657] Yeah.
              [6658] Yeah.
              [6659] If you got, you know, if you got a character behind the
              bar ... could er ... attract people ... by his own force of
              personality.
Alan (PS040)  [6660] I think erm ... you could ... but you know, really then
              you think when
Barry (PS03W) [6661] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6662] they come in we can start
Barry (PS03W) [6663] Oh yeah.
              [6664] Yeah.
              [6665] Yeah it is.
              [6666] ... Cos I wouldn't lo ... I mean I actually don't think
              you can do, if you're gonna do ... people are gonna eat I th I
              think you're gonna be pushed at ... more than about hundred and
              fifty to two hundred.
              [6667] ... You know, depends on how you retail it first but
Alan (PS040)  [6668] I think it depends which it, what you
Barry (PS03W) [6669] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6670] do.
Barry (PS03W) [6671] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6672] Erm
Barry (PS03W) [6673] I mean, it depends a as you say, er yeah I mean it does
              depend that.
              [6674] Cos if, if you, if you, if you wanted to you could always
              utilize all the dance floor area ... tables and things, you know.
              [6675] If you had that kind of function that you ... you know
Alan (PS040)  [6676] Mm.
              [6677] Makes it difficult to do a big functions though in here
              with that stage.
Barry (PS03W) [6678] Oh yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6679] You know, to set out
Barry (PS03W) [6680] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6681] you co there's no way
Barry (PS03W) [6682] Yeah it does.
Alan (PS040)  [6683] you can set out for two hundred.
Barry (PS03W) [6684] No.
              [6685] No.
              [6686] What we did do
Alan (PS040)  [6687] And so
Barry (PS03W) [6688] very well
Alan (PS040)  [6689] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6690] erm ... we were we some of the jazz stuff, I mean
Alan (PS040)  [6691] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6692] it ... it, it never worked in a sense that it wasn't
              commercially viable
Alan (PS040)  [6693] No.
Barry (PS03W) [6694] but ... things like Kenny Ball and that we'd had
Alan (PS040)  [6695] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6696] and we had like the ta ... trestle tables in all these
              alcoves and people came and actually booked a meal

Barry (PS03W) [6698] and, and, you had a meal and sat and watched ... the band
              and everything.
              [6699] It wor i I mean ... for those ... it did work
Alan (PS040)  [6700] Different [...] sort of like
Barry (PS03W) [6701] it did work.
Alan (PS040)  [6702] Yeah.
              [6703] Just
Barry (PS03W) [6704] But
Alan (PS040)  [6705] need the
Barry (PS03W) [6706] you can see everywhere.
              [6707] And it did
Alan (PS040)  [6708] Put hot food
Barry (PS03W) [6709] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6710] up at the back as well there.

Alan (PS040)  [6723] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6724] It actually looks bigger looking that way ... than it does
              when you're up there looking back, I think.
              [6725] Erm ... I'm thinking of atmosphere.
              [6726] ... But if we ... if we carpet the two raised areas in a
              sort of ... attract hardwearing linoey type affect on there cos

Barry (PS03W) [6745] No you can't, no.
Alan (PS040)  [6746] Oh.
              [6747] Right.

Alan (PS040)  [6749] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6750] sense.
              [6751] ... Er
Alan (PS040)  [6752] Right.

              back end ... here.
Alan (PS040)  [6768] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6769] But I mean we've always wanted to utilize this but we
              can't really ... we built that wall here ... and it's just a ...

              [6770] I mean ... al it's all, none of it's sort of
Alan (PS040)  [6771] Determined wall.
Barry (PS03W) [6772] determined walls, I mean, it's no ... no wall there at
              all.
              [6773] I mean we put this up just
Alan (PS040)  [6774] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6775] to break that
Alan (PS040)  [6776] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6777] [sneeze] ... because this is the console bar. [cough]

Barry (PS03W) [6781] Well it's not, I mean
Alan (PS040)  [6782] Should think they've had quite a few [...] .

Alan (PS040)  [6803] Right.
              [6804] So that's alright.
              [6805] I've enough afternoons [...] . [laugh]
Barry (PS03W) [6806] Well, you won't need to do that now.
              [6807] It's somewhere anyway, we've got
Alan (PS040)  [6808] Jesus wept!
Barry (PS03W) [6809] pizza oven.
Alan (PS040)  [6810] What is it?
Barry (PS03W) [6811] Ice making machine.
Alan (PS040)  [6812] What's that, a dishwasher?
Barry (PS03W) [6813] Glass washer, yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6814] Glass washer, I meant.
Barry (PS03W) [6815] We've got er
Alan (PS040)  [6816] Have you got one behind bar?
Barry (PS03W) [6817] No.
              [6818] There's not.
Alan (PS040)  [6819] There int one behind the bar?
Barry (PS03W) [6820] No.
Alan (PS040)  [6821] Oh out in garden.
              [6822] Oh right!
              [6823] I see.
Barry (PS03W) [6824] So basically they've gotta just tray it up
Alan (PS040)  [6825] What you want is
Barry (PS03W) [6826] tray it up here and then
Alan (PS040)  [6827] yeah, here and then
Barry (PS03W) [6828] bang it straight in.
              [6829] Erm
Alan (PS040)  [6830] Why's your bar so high?
              [6831] I can't reach your pump ... [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [6832] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6833] Have you?
Barry (PS03W) [6834] We like to keep the floor nice and sticky so the staff
              can't run away!
Alan (PS040)  [6835] Oh I see.
Barry (PS03W) [6836] Once they're behind here they're stuck all night.
Alan (PS040)  [6837] Think you got some cleaning, you just want ... that back
              in.
Barry (PS03W) [6838] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6839] You know what I mean, it's got ... [...] .
              [6840] ... And all that up there.
              [6841] Mm!
              [6842] Now then, so you'd ... carpet them two
Barry (PS03W) [6843] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6844] and then ... summat ... washed
Barry (PS03W) [6845] Well you see, hardly anybody ever sa ... they don't really
              sit in this area, all they do is er, I mean, they only sit
Alan (PS040)  [6846] Around the bar.
Barry (PS03W) [6847] right at the end of the, you know
Alan (PS040)  [6848] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6849] when it's full ... they'll sit on those two tables.
Alan (PS040)  [6850] You were going to clear that area anyway, don't they?
Barry (PS03W) [6851] Yeah.
              [6852] I mean, everybody round here just stands ... or sits on
              those bar stools.
Alan (PS040)  [6853] Mm.
              [6854] ... Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6855] When people first come in they go for the raised areas and
              sit down.
              [6856] O
Alan (PS040)  [6857] You have to see.
Barry (PS03W) [6858] or they stand at the bar.
              [6859] It's, and, and if you actually look on the actual area
              we're talking about, there's only one, two, three, four, there's
              only about ... half a dozen tables.
Alan (PS040)  [6860] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6861] Which is, you know, at maximum you're gonna get twenty
              four people sat around there anyway.
              [6862] So I think, in a way, it's erm ... a bit wasted carpeting
              it all.
              [6863] Cos it's a big area
Alan (PS040)  [6864] I do.
Barry (PS03W) [6865] to carpet.
Alan (PS040)  [6866] One, two, three
Barry (PS03W) [6867] I mean ... the quotes we had ranged from sort of
Alan (PS040)  [6868] Well you,wo did you look to change the carpet
Barry (PS03W) [6869] eighteen to twenty seven.
Alan (PS040)  [6870] ... because of the name on it?
Barry (PS03W) [6871] Well ... yeah, and
Alan (PS040)  [6872] You are?
Barry (PS03W) [6873] and it's getting past it to be honest.
              [6874] I mean, these metal strips are down there for the public
              entertainment license, they weren't gonna give us it because the
              carpet was lifting.
Alan (PS040)  [6875] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6876] So ... I mean, not, weren't gonna give us it, but we had
              to do it for
Alan (PS040)  [6877] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6878] you know, at the time.
Alan (PS040)  [6879] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6880] And you can see like ... like there ... can you see
              straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet, but
              there's er been a li a bit of a leak at some stage.
Alan (PS040)  [6881] Oh right, I see.
Barry (PS03W) [6882] There's one there.
              [6883] I mean
Alan (PS040)  [6884] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6885] if you've got it carpeted, once you got that you, you're
              ... you're stuck aren't you?
              [6886] You know
Alan (PS040)  [6887] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6888] you've either got ... I mean, we've either gotta put a
              [laughing] table on top of it or []
Alan (PS040)  [6889] Yeah, that's it, or sit on there or get
Barry (PS03W) [6890] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6891] somebody to stand with it
Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Alan (PS040)  [6892] you know.
              [6893] Yes.
Barry (PS03W) [6894] Erm ... or replace the whole damn carpet.
              [6895] I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune ... [...] !
Alan (PS040)  [6896] Bloody hell!
              [6897] It must, it must have been absolute ... arm and a leg.
Barry (PS03W) [6898] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6899] Absolute arm and a leg.
              [6900] ... [sighing] Er []
Barry (PS03W) [6901] But it ... it's not a bad size room in the sense that
Alan (PS040)  [6902] No it int, no, it's, it is
Barry (PS03W) [6903] in the sense that you can get three hundred in
Alan (PS040)  [6904] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [6905] well we often get four hundred in if you're ... you know,
              I mean, just have the right
Alan (PS040)  [6906] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [6907] party ... erm
Alan (PS040)  [6908] How many you licensed for?
Barry (PS03W) [6909] Three hundred.
Alan (PS040)  [6910] Three.
Barry (PS03W) [6911] But, you can get ... but a hundred people can have a
              decent atmosphere as well.
Alan (PS040)  [6912] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [6913] You know, it
Alan (PS040)  [6914] Well that, that's good you see
Barry (PS03W) [6915] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6916] cos I mean some places that are fairly big ... th the, if
              you've got hundred in they just, it looks empty don't it?
Barry (PS03W) [6917] No that's right.
              [6918] That's right.
              [6919] I mean
Alan (PS040)  [6920] Erm
Barry (PS03W) [6921] that's the Carlton's problem innit?
              [6922] You know, if it, unless it gets
Alan (PS040)  [6923] Ooh!
              [6924] God!
              [6925] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6926] unless he's got five hundred in yo yo you feel as if
              you're in a barn ... aircraft hanger.
Alan (PS040)  [6927] Well that's right.
Barry (PS03W) [6928] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6929] But the sort of chromea and all that sort of lends itself
              to one of them aircraft things doesn't
Barry (PS03W) [6930] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6931] it?
              [6932] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [6933] It does.
              [6934] It does, yeah.
              [6935] ... So you wouldn't have to spend a fortune on, on, on ...
              I mean it's only a matter of ... most of it's a matter of paint,
              and then hanging a few things up isn't it?
              [6936] Change the atmosphere.
Alan (PS040)  [6937] Well er, yeah well it is, but I think ... cos one, you've
              got to look at, oh a bit of a design as well a ... while you're
              at it you might as well just get one or two bits
Barry (PS03W) [6938] Oh yeah.
              [6939] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6940] you know
Barry (PS03W) [6941] Yeah, yeah.
              [6942] True.
Alan (PS040)  [6943] Erm ... oh yeah.
              [6944] One, two ... it's alright, I'm trying to ... think.
              [6945] [laugh] ... if you're gonna ... make all this into a dance
              floor and all the rest of it what's the be a er er er ... benefit
              of having a stage?
              [6946] ... If all this is virtually gonna be ... it's virtually
              gonna be dance floor int it really?
Alan (PS040)  [6947] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [6948] Well there is no benefit.
Alan (PS040)  [6949] Cos if you didn't have that it'd make this room more
              viable ... in as much as erm, the point of view of doing ...
              doing catering ... and, functions and all the rest of it.
              [6950] You can't, you couldn't ... say right we'll do a function
              for ... hundred and fifty and two hundred, and really to do,
              you've got to be looking to do a, a sit down function for two
              hundred
Barry (PS03W) [6951] Right.
Alan (PS040)  [6952] if you, because ... it's more than the Headway can do
Barry (PS03W) [6953] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6954] comfortably.
              [6955] And it's more than ... er, and you can certainly do a
              better job than the Carlton so ... I mean, you don't call, I
              mean, you don't call him any ... competition at all I don't ...
              but, you've got to look at being able to do functions for two
              hundred.
Barry (PS03W) [6956] Mm.
              [6957] Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it?
Alan (PS040)  [6958] Well it is, but having, yeah but with their
Barry (PS03W) [6959] Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms?
Alan (PS040)  [6960] I'm talking about the Carlton.
Barry (PS03W) [6961] Right.
Alan (PS040)  [6962] Not Chelstons.
Barry (PS03W) [6963] Not Chelstons, right.
Alan (PS040)  [6964] The Carlton up
Barry (PS03W) [6965] Right.
Alan (PS040)  [6966] here.
Barry (PS03W) [6967] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6968] It, really and truthfully, like the Headway do plenty of
              functions and the rest of it ... but ... you can do a better job
              than Headway.
Barry (PS03W) [6969] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6970] No two ways about,wi it ... in a min in a [...] .
              [6971] But if you can do, if, if you can do a two hundred thing
              for sit down ... you're gonna be in among the functions.
Barry (PS03W) [6972] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6973] Definitely.
              [6974] Plus the fact like you sa er like I say, if you're gonna
              have a dance floor in here there int any benefit about having the
              raised area is there?
Barry (PS03W) [6975] No, that's very true.
Alan (PS040)  [6976] And er, and it, it ... it makes a lot of difference
              actually.
              [6977] I would have thought so.
Barry (PS03W) [6978] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6979] I mean, cos the bands can still set up can't they?
Barry (PS03W) [6980] Oh yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6981] If they sit up ... here
Barry (PS03W) [6982] Well you can do what, yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [6983] Yeah.
              [6984] But they still sit up there and they can still see them.
Barry (PS03W) [6985] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6986] And it's makes it a ... it makes it a different space,
              totally different.
Barry (PS03W) [6987] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [6988] And like I say, if you're gonna carpet it ... er not
              carpet it, you're gonna cover it ... you might as well cover it
              ... totally.
Barry (PS03W) [6989] Oh yeah.
              [6990] Well
Alan (PS040)  [6991] I wonder what you'd use though?
Barry (PS03W) [6992] You ca you're gonna, you're gonna cover it, I mean we've
              got to re
Alan (PS040)  [6993] You've gotta cover that anyway.
Barry (PS03W) [6994] we've got to re-cover that
Alan (PS040)  [6995] That's what
Barry (PS03W) [6996] stage anyway.
Alan (PS040)  [6997] So you're not ... so all you're
Barry (PS03W) [6998] So
Alan (PS040)  [6999] doing is taking that out, but
Barry (PS03W) [7000] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7001] surely in a lot of ways it might ... makes all the
              difference Barry.
Barry (PS03W) [7002] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7003] Makes it ... and it makes in a way [...] so that it, it's
              not a
Barry (PS03W) [7004] Well you can create a dance floor area with tables and
              chairs.
Alan (PS040)  [7005] Yeah, course you can.
Barry (PS03W) [7006] All you do is just ... put them round there.
Alan (PS040)  [7007] Just put them round.
Barry (PS03W) [7008] I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House
Alan (PS040)  [7009] Well that's ... terrific!
Barry (PS03W) [7010] they've got er actual ... flat floors.
Alan (PS040)  [7011] Get rid of all that and you have got more table area
              because ... i they can sort of sit in th in the, the
Barry (PS03W) [7012] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7013] gangway
Barry (PS03W) [7014] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7015] you know, so I think, I think that would ... it's alright
              I just keep freezing up.
Barry (PS03W) [7016] Do you wanna sit in there rather than
Alan (PS040)  [7017] No my, I'm better stood here.
Barry (PS03W) [7018] Oh.
Alan (PS040)  [7019] No I'm better stood here.
              [7020] But I've got to ... I do this you know, I just sit and
              look.
Barry (PS03W) [7021] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7022] Oh no, I don't stand a lot.
Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Alan (PS040)  [7023] Well that's ... but I've, I've got to er, so I think
              definitely that wants to come out.
              [7024] Erm ... and er
Barry (PS03W) [7025] Because, I mean, if you ever got anything you really need
              a little, you could always bring a little stage in.
Alan (PS040)  [7026] Well [...] ... Yeah.
              [7027] Staging's no problem is
Barry (PS03W) [7028] No.
Alan (PS040)  [7029] it?
Barry (PS03W) [7030] No.
Alan (PS040)  [7031] You know
Barry (PS03W) [7032] I mean
Alan (PS040)  [7033] now we need erm ... alright we're gonna, we'll keep ...
              these mirrors and everything.
              [7034] Them mirror tiles and everything.
Barry (PS03W) [7035] I should think so.
              [7036] They cost us a fortune!

Barry (PS03W) [7184] Well nowadays, nowadays everybody wants two drinks anyway
              don't
Alan (PS040)  [7185] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7186] they?
              [7187] I mean it's not like
Alan (PS040)  [7188] No, but, but
Barry (PS03W) [7189] it used to be a
Alan (PS040)  [7190] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7191] everybody wanted warm [...]
Alan (PS040)  [7192] When you think about if you ... just ... serving two or
              three hundred [...] to keep opening and shutting bloody cupboard
              doors, erm, fridge doors, it's no good.
              [7193] Chill's best, I think anyway.

Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Alan (PS040)  [laugh]
Barry (PS03W) [7196] Yeah, I thi yeah I think you're right actually.
              [7197] You need to get rid of that and it's ... and create a
              dance floor
Alan (PS040)  [7198] Yeah, create
Barry (PS03W) [7199] what, and what I'd do is I'd put a few more spots in
Alan (PS040)  [7200] Yes.
Barry (PS03W) [7201] no, those spots around
Alan (PS040)  [7202] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7203] there shining on the
Alan (PS040)  [7204] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7205] floor, put some round the back so
Alan (PS040)  [7206] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7207] you actually just use
Alan (PS040)  [7208] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7209] see, but I er, I think creative use of spotlights is
              better ... than, than specialized lighting effects, which A, cost
              a fortune, but B
Alan (PS040)  [7210] And you get out of
Barry (PS03W) [7211] as soon as you've seen them they're out of date.
Alan (PS040)  [7212] Well that's it.
              [7213] That's right.
Barry (PS03W) [7214] Cos they're only effective one time, that's the first time
              you see them.
Alan (PS040)  [7215] [...] , yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7216] After that, it's
Alan (PS040)  [7217] And we don't want to fork, I mean, [...]
Barry (PS03W) [7218] No.
              [7219] No.
              [7220] So erm ... I mean you can just use coloured spots it in, I
              mean, those at the moment are just literally stage spots, all
              they are i are on, and on dim
Alan (PS040)  [7221] Oh right.
              [7222] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7223] then you can dim them up or whatever
Alan (PS040)  [7224] Yeah, I have them
Barry (PS03W) [7225] but they can't flash
Alan (PS040)  [7226] No.
Barry (PS03W) [7227] so what we need is a small unit in there and, and, I mean,
              it's only ... two or three hundred quid ... er, and a few erm
Alan (PS040)  [7228] Most places where erm, you know they've got them in that,
              where you go to
Barry (PS03W) [7229] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7230] you can pick stuff up for next to nowt.

Alan (PS040)  [7234] But I think er ... er ... yeah I think that's definite,
              take that out, it really, it really would make ... the difference
              to erm
Barry (PS03W) [7235] Yeah it would, actually, thinking about it.
Alan (PS040)  [7236] Would, it'd make it ... it'd make it ... well, it'd just
              transform it, I mean, just no two ways about it, I think.
              [7237] You've got that erm ... what time's that chap coming, half
              past three?
Barry (PS03W) [7238] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7239] Well I think er ... is this, alright if I look in here or
Barry (PS03W) [7240] Yeah, course.
Alan (PS040)  [7241] I'll just get my erm
Barry (PS03W) [7242] Yeah, I mean i it's ... keep on walking round till you get
              familiar with it.

Barry (PS03W) [7342] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7343] Right there's a ... so I mean ... say
Barry (PS03W) [7344] I mean at the moment all the food is ... is protecting the
              license cos you've got to do food, food up to two o'clock.
              [7345] You've got to have food available.
Alan (PS040)  [7346] Oh yeah, definitely.
              [7347] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7348] So I mean, we're just going through the motions at the
              moment, I mean, quite hone
Alan (PS040)  [7349] But you have food?
Barry (PS03W) [7350] Yeah.
              [7351] But I mean quite honestly we haven't ... [...]
Alan (PS040)  [7352] No, that's a, that's, right, but I mean that's ... neither
              here nor there is it?
Barry (PS03W) [7353] No.
Alan (PS040)  [7354] But you see, you've got the potential to do a big opera a
              bigger operation.
Barry (PS03W) [7355] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7356] You see, and er
Barry (PS03W) [7357] Well that's where, I mean, you can make money on the food
              sometimes can't you?
              [7358] And that's, that's where you've got
Alan (PS040)  [7359] Make the money, yeah.
              [7360] And this is why takes [...] to get all this down and get
              ... get a location ... better than the Carlton for the, I mean,
              alright, we aren't gonna be able to do the three or four hundred,
              but then we
Barry (PS03W) [7361] No, no.
Alan (PS040)  [7362] I can't imagine anything worse than doing a function for
              three or four ... because by the, by the laws of average how the
              hell are you gonna get it out to them all as it should be?
Barry (PS03W) [7363] I mean,de a I, I think he doesn't do a bad job on to be
              fair
Alan (PS040)  [7364] No, he doesn't.
Barry (PS03W) [7365] I mean he does the big functions and he doesn't do a bad
              job
Alan (PS040)  [7366] No he doesn't.
Barry (PS03W) [7367] he's better than he was a few years ago and
Alan (PS040)  [7368] Ah yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7369] and, and
Alan (PS040)  [7370] Oh yeah, definitely
Barry (PS03W) [7371] he's
Alan (PS040)  [7372] yeah.
              [7373] A he's ... I think Rob gets a bit ups a bit wound up
              because there's no
Barry (PS03W) [7374] I tell you what amazes me, Mary, he takes, he can take a
              conference, when they have a big do he puts them there for the,

Barry (PS03W) [7385] They've gotta imagine it, you ought to have like a ...
              pull
Alan (PS040)  [7386] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7387] a photograph and say oomph!

Barry (PS03W) [7391] Yeah.
              [7392] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7393] Erm ... but to do, but like I say, if you've got somewhere
              that could just er ... er ... you see, cos I mean what, the most
              we can do is fifty
Barry (PS03W) [7394] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7395] down there.

Alan (PS040)  [7397] Then er ... which is nice,i it ... forty's lovely!
              [7398] Forty's absolutely lovely to do.
              [7399] And that, and that's it, but I mean, to do, to have
              somewhere to do two hundred like this would be absolutely
              incredible!
              [7400] Could always do small weddings down there and, and then
              the big do
Barry (PS03W) [7401] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7402] at night up here.
              [7403] ... That'd make ... that just totally makes it different.
              [7404] I want to just go and have a look in them ... you see if
              you've ... well anyway [...] ... Well erm, I might get [...] to a
              certain extent.
              [7405] Cos you're nearly
Barry (PS03W) [7406] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7407] [...] aren't you?
Barry (PS03W) [7408] Mm.
              [7409] Again, this is look [knocking on the wall] ... it's the
              same as this.
              [7410] Shit!
Alan (PS040)  [7411] Well where's that go?
Barry (PS03W) [7412] That's the fire escape down to outside.
Alan (PS040)  [7413] Oh so you couldn't you'd have to leave them [...]
Barry (PS03W) [7414] No you can't, no you can't, no.
              [7415] But ... that's that area we were looking at.
              [7416] ... Either side of the disco console.
              [7417] That's the passageway we just walked down.
              [7418] And that's the area you were banging.
Alan (PS040)  [7419] Oh that's where I were banging on wall?
Barry (PS03W) [7420] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7421] Right.
Barry (PS03W) [7422] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7423] Well that'd be fine ... because then it means that you've
              got either ... you've got your back in
Barry (PS03W) [7424] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7425] and out, or whichever way
Barry (PS03W) [7426] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7427] round you
Barry (PS03W) [7428] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7429] want to do it.
              [7430] So that fine, all this comes down.
              [7431] And you can still sort of ma make it elevated up this
              really nice and
Barry (PS03W) [7432] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7433] whatever.
              [7434] [laugh] ... That's that wallpaper int it?
Barry (PS03W) [7435] [laughing] Yeah [] !
Alan (PS040)  [7436] Right, so this is
Barry (PS03W) [7437] It's actually you know, if you took the time you make a
              tremendous, it'd make a tremendous ... big area wouldn't it?
Alan (PS040)  [7438] Brilliant!
Barry (PS03W) [7439] No messing!
Alan (PS040)  [7440] Right, depends what the ... and quite honestly, if you
              bring these down ... and make them a bit more romantic
Barry (PS03W) [7441] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7442] you know.
Barry (PS03W) [7443] God knows what they'll get up to!
Alan (PS040)  [7444] Well I a don't give a bugger, me!
Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Alan (PS040)  [7445] I aren't bothered for them.
              [7446] ... Fifteen ... there's fifteen there and whatever they
              need here.
              [7447] ... Thirty seven.
              [7448] See you could seat fifty on here.
Barry (PS03W) [7449] Yeah.
              [7450] I, I think I ca I, once upon a time I did on the fixed
              seating for, for ... I think you could get about a hundred and
              twenty round
Alan (PS040)  [7451] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7452] there.
Alan (PS040)  [7453] O as it is?
Barry (PS03W) [7454] Yeah.
              [7455] As it is.
Alan (PS040)  [7456] Yeah.
              [7457] Packed out.
              [7458] ... [sighing] Er []
Barry (PS03W) [7459] But you see the other thing, the other thing that er
              that's worth, when you've had the smaller dos, you know
Alan (PS040)  [7460] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [7461] sort of even, even like sixty, eighty people ... you can
              lay one of these raised areas out as the big cold buffet area
Alan (PS040)  [7462] Oh the buffet, yeah.
              [7463] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7464] which kills a lot
Alan (PS040)  [7465] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7466] of space in the club.
Alan (PS040)  [7467] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7468] The only thing that worries me about taking that out is
              that you then create a massive ... empty space, if you have got
Alan (PS040)  [7469] No you don't.
Barry (PS03W) [7470] sixty, seventy people you have to then
Alan (PS040)  [7471] No you don't because what you do is, you do it down there.
Barry (PS03W) [7472] Well
Alan (PS040)  [7473] And this is off
Barry (PS03W) [7474] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7475] innit?
Barry (PS03W) [7476] Yeah.
              [7477] Then you go back and sit up there.
Alan (PS040)  [7478] That's it.
Barry (PS03W) [7479] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [7480] Yeah.
              [7481] You do it down there, and this is erm ... if you did it
              over there it would look absolutely dreadful!
              [7482] You do it down there, you set it up in the middle and you
              set it up really nice and cosy.
Barry (PS03W) [7483] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7484] And then er
Barry (PS03W) [7485] We got a lot, we got a, quite a lot of these little blue
              tables so you could actually
Alan (PS040)  [7486] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7487] surround the dance floors
Alan (PS040)  [7488] Oh yes.
              [7489] No, no
Barry (PS03W) [7490] but we
Alan (PS040)  [7491] messing.
Barry (PS03W) [7492] push, you know, push people into the dance floor so
              they're there anyway.
Alan (PS040)  [7493] Yeah, and you make a totally, you make a totally different
              erm ... it's, it ... in one sort of minor operation if you like,
              alright, minor to a
Barry (PS03W) [7494] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7495] certain extent, you've totally transformed it Barry.
Barry (PS03W) [7496] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7497] And it, it
Barry (PS03W) [7498] That's right.
Alan (PS040)  [7499] definitely looks so different.
              [7500] I mean, even if you didn't do anything else.
Barry (PS03W) [7501] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7502] But I think erm, you've just got to er, we've just got to
              er ... gerrit sorted.
              [7503] It, it, it int gonna take much sorting ... and get the ...
              you know
Barry (PS03W) [7504] Mm.
              [7505] We could use that chrome railing around
Alan (PS040)  [7506] Well you co
Barry (PS03W) [7507] area
Alan (PS040)  [7508] yeah you could use that chrome railing elsewhere, we could

Barry (PS03W) [7509] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7510] you know.
              [7511] I don't think you, you've, you've got to try in a way not
              to shut it off ... too much ... erm ... and yet it,i you've just
              got to sort of be able to ... not shut it off but sort of create
              different areas
Barry (PS03W) [7512] Mm.
Alan (PS040)  [7513] within one big area ... i i if you can and I think
              shutting things, I think putting trellising up to, not trellising
              but ... that sort of thing, to a certain extent at the minute ...
              we don't need and ... I think ... I'll have to come a time er too
              when it's open as well to get
Barry (PS03W) [7514] Now,wha what I was just thinking of
Alan (PS040)  [7515] Yes.
              [7516] But it could be just on a Saturday and Sun
Barry (PS03W) [7517] is it, if you, if you're using, if you're gonna use it as
              a pub as well
Alan (PS040)  [7518] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [7519] on a Saturday and a Sunday
Alan (PS040)  [7520] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [7521] which I think you can do with Amer certainly in the summer
              season ... if you Americanize it and all that and, and just, well
              I mean, we, we did
Alan (PS040)  [7522] You could have a glorious MacDonalds couldn't you?
Barry (PS03W) [7523] Yeah.
              [7524] That's right.
              [7525] Then, you know ... you wanna start from that and build
              back out bits
Alan (PS040)  [7526] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7527] you know
Alan (PS040)  [7528] Definitely
Barry (PS03W) [7529] cos I mean if they walked into here on stood on that bar
              hundred and twenty people
Alan (PS040)  [7530] Well actually you don't want them, you want them in here
              and bar's there.

Barry (PS03W) [7537] No we have that closed and
Alan (PS040)  [7538] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7539] and try and sort
Alan (PS040)  [7540] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7541] of shutter it off in some
Alan (PS040)  [7542] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [7543] way.
              [7544] I mean maybe
Alan (PS040)  [7545] Well I think
Barry (PS03W) [7546] maybe even getting ... literally shutters rather than
              those grills.
              [7547] And then you can

Alan (PS040)  [7649] But I, I tell you, really, you'd, you'd ... and something
              different because I mean like you go to the Headway and it's just

              mean most of the bands on the local level ... are used to playing
              in pubs so they just had to play on the floor anyway ... and the
              rest of it
Alan (PS040)  [7797] Well it's a bloody ego who needs the stage [...] .

              fuss with Jean stopped because that
Alan (PS040)  [7824] Yeah, but a thing like
Hugh (PS03Y)  [7825] Was it?
Alan (PS040)  [7826] that is, it's just that Mr who really didn't know anything
              from his [...] and needle and thread was stirring the shit!
Hugh (PS03Y)  [laugh] ... [...]
Alan (PS040)  [7827] No, she's been getting enough of that.
Barry (PS03W) [7828] But once he's, once he's resigned himself to that, he's
              then gotta look at that operation next door and he must be losing
              money hand over fist for the amount of space it is.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [7829] That's right.

Barry (PS03W) [8237] Great!
              [8238] ... I mean, the only way you could do that would be ... if
              you had a till at one end and people bought whatever they wanted
              and were given a voucher and you walked down the other end and
              exchanged
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8239] Mm.
Barry (PS03W) [8240] it for drink.
              [8241] That's the only way you could actually ... make that work
              at all.
Alan (PS040)  [8242] Yeah, but just think of how much messing about there is.
Barry (PS03W) [8243] Ah!
              [8244] It'd be unbelievable!
Alan (PS040)  [8245] I mean it'd be two thi forty we'd be round the bloody
              bend!
Barry (PS03W) [8246] Yeah, but it's somebody sitting in an office innit ...
              deciding this!
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8247] Yeah, but who, who do you ... you know why
Barry (PS03W) [8248] Sitting in a suit in a nice office saying, wo!
              [8249] This is a good idea.
              [8250] You know ... they don't serve behind the bar on a Saturday
              night.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8251] They want somebody here from the [...] for half an hour
              and them not being served first

              warming, doing it and then ... half leaving it and then
Barry (PS03W) [8262] Yeah.
Alan (PS040)  [8263] warming it up again that does the damage.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8264] Certainly does.
              [8265] Mm.

Hugh (PS03Y)  [8495] points and
Barry (PS03W) [8496] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8497] stopped, and then ... prefer to go like when they appealed
              because he'd ... knocked them again.
Barry (PS03W) [8498] I mean, you know, how long's he, when did he get the job,
              May or something, last year?

Hugh (PS03Y)  [8504] How the fuck can he do that?
Barry (PS03W) [8505] I know.

Hugh (PS03Y)  [8507] I know.
Barry (PS03W) [8508] Yeah.
              [8509] He er ... especially when the chairman says he's got every

Barry (PS03W) [8513] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8514] I fucking watched the programme on that ... Who Who's the
              Greatest?
              [8515] It was about fucking sportsmen of the week, and it was
              Keagan and George Best.
Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Hugh (PS03Y)  [laugh]
Barry (PS03W) [8516] Oh I, I remember that, I didn't watch it, I refused to
              watch it.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8517] I mean that's actually going in for Keagan!
Barry (PS03W) [laugh]
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8518] I think fucking Dennis Taylor was on ... singing his
              praises.
Barry (PS03W) [8519] Singing whose, Keagan's praises?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8520] Yeah.
              [8521] I think it was Dennis Taylor, Taylor.
Barry (PS03W) [8522] That's a ... that was difference yo you end up voting, you
              end up actually voting who's the nicest human being, not
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8523] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8524] really [...]
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8525] Exactly.
              [8526] That's why it was, [...] cos he's
Barry (PS03W) [8527] not the best footballer.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8528] you know, dedicated to his club and all this
Barry (PS03W) [8529] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8530] stuff.
Barry (PS03W) [8531] But I mean, he, he wasn't
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8532] He's a [...]
Barry (PS03W) [8533] particularly was he?
              [8534] I mean, he went to Liverpool, Liverpool made him
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8535] That's right.
              [8536] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8537] from Scunthorpe ... and then, I mean, he, he went after
              mega bucks in, in erm
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8538] Hamburg.
Barry (PS03W) [8539] Hamburg, then ... you know,so ... being a big fish in a
              small pond at Southampton ... and then
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8540] But
Barry (PS03W) [8541] last couple of years a quick ... I mean, his contract with
              Newcastle worth, worth a fortune wasn't it?
              [8542] Cos it was one of those first ones that was sponsored by
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8543] Who was
Barry (PS03W) [8544] the
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8545] it?
Barry (PS03W) [8546] the brewery

              sponsored Newcastle?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8552] No, no.
Barry (PS03W) [8553] But anyway, I mean, they er they ended up, instead of
              paying the club a sponsorship they ended up paying him, you know,
              like erm
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8554] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8555] like the car phone company did with
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8556] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8557] Ian Botham to go to Worcestershire.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8558] But he wasn't the fucking greatest, oh hardworking I'd
              say, he fucking
Barry (PS03W) [8559] Oh yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8560] grafted.
Barry (PS03W) [8561] Yeah.
              [8562] That's right.

Hugh (PS03Y)  [8564] He wasn't that [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [8565] he wasn't a very skilful player.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8566] No.
              [8567] He wasn't a natural at all.
              [8568] He worked hard though.

              [8570] He had a, he had a, he had a, a lot, he had a ... he was
              quite nippy ... and he had a good scu you know, good goal
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8571] Good goals.
Barry (PS03W) [8572] scoring sense
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8573] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8574] sometimes, but I mean ... that was all.
              [8575] He was a good player but ... I ... but I think he's always
              looked after himself, I mean he's ... he's
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8576] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8577] he's probably one of

              [8678] She's always on about Alison like, I'm sure she fucking
              doesn't charge them for drinks.
Barry (PS03W) [8679] Well, which one's Alison?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8680] She's er, she always comes looking for Terri.
              [8681] She's going with that little monster with the long hair.

              faster than her, which I do like, you know she still should o ...

              done what ... two, three and a half?
Barry (PS03W) [8689] Oh yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8690] At least, like.
              [8691] Well she, I mean, she might have done it.
              [8692] She should have done a bit more than that actually.
Barry (PS03W) [8693] Mm.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8694] She should have been doing three hundred.
              [8695] ... Still leaves me a hundred and fifty ahead of her like,
              you know.
              [8696] Like, you didn't serve any drinks did you Barry?

              [8699] Er
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8700] So all

              collector don't we?
              [8704] We need somebody on to collect glasses.

              quite, we, we, we did have quite a lot of glasses.
              [8706] Mind you, they would have gone and broke if we line them

Hugh (PS03Y)  [8725] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8726] somebody else, not just ourselves, you know.
              [8727] Okay, if we wa if we want to turn a blind eye to it then
              that's our business you know ... but er ... but when you're, when
              you're actually erm
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8728] Answerable to someone else.
Barry (PS03W) [8729] Yeah.
              [8730] Present accounts to somebody else you can't do it like
              that can you?
              [8731] You know water's looking disgusting!
              [8732] ... What other results were there last night?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8733] Er ... Forest
Barry (PS03W) [8734] The

Hugh (PS03Y)  [8740] I've seen it, seen that one ... I've seen that match ...
              they were lucky.
Barry (PS03W) [8741] Sunderland ... won, who were they playing?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8742] Sunderland won.
              [8743] Er ... Oxford I think.
              [8744] They were winning three nil ... three two at the end of
              it.
              [8745] Oxford scored one on the end [...]
Barry (PS03W) [8746] Not many first division teams left is there?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8747] Nine.
Barry (PS03W) [8748] About ... nine is there?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8749] Wrexham were unlucky against Blackburn.
Barry (PS03W) [8750] Oh!
              [8751] Weren't they?
              [8752] Didn't they play well?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8753] Yes!
              [8754] They've always been a
Barry (PS03W) [8755] I thought they played
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8756] good club side ... Wrexham.
Barry (PS03W) [8757] Yeah, they have but I mean, they got a lot of good skilful
              young lads haven't they?
              [8758] They're only like nineteen and twenty
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8759] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8760] and ... I mean that young fullback looked brilliant!
              [8761] That lef
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8762] Yeah.
              [8763] Mm mm.
              [8764] Quite good.
              [8765] Composed as well like.
              [8766] Talented.
Barry (PS03W) [8767] Yeah.
              [8768] ... It's a funny law that er ... clear chance at goal job
              innit?
              [8769] I mean it's a ... funny definition.
              [8770] ... I must admit I, I ... if you could stop that
              deliberate foul it's ... I mean it's better for the game if you
              can stop it.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8771] Send them off.
Barry (PS03W) [8772] Yeah.
              [8773] Yeah.
              [8774] That's right.
              [8775] I mean if you're gonna do it
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8776] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8777] do it, do it, do it
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8778] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8779] consistently.
              [8780] ... Cos, actually, the other thing about defenders hauling
              people down like that, you know, how many times when a forward's
              through one on one on a goal keeper does he score?
              [8781] It's not that often actually.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8782] No.
Barry (PS03W) [8783] I mean, okay, somebody like Besty
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8784] Thing you want
Barry (PS03W) [8785] you could bet on
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8786] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8787] nine times out of ten, but
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8788] But even, even against the goalkeeper they fucking lose
              fifty percent of the, like
Barry (PS03W) [8789] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8790] I was saying ... more than fifty percent of the playing
Barry (PS03W) [8791] Yeah, I would, yeah.
              [8792] Yeah.
              [8793] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8794] And that's all just ... one on one on the goalkeeper.
Barry (PS03W) [8795] Yeah.
              [8796] ... Well that's what I mean, I mean, you know,th th the
              player could let him, could let him go really without
              deliberately fouling him because ... it's, it's gonna
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8797] Half the
Barry (PS03W) [8798] be at least a fifty fifty
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8799] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8800] chance that the goalkeeper's gonna save it innit?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8801] It's fucking gotta be straight like that, I, I, I don't
              fucking ... taking off three points for a [...] ... [...] .
              [8802] At the start it seemed to improve the matches but it,
              they've just become too hectic now I think.
Barry (PS03W) [8803] Mm.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8804] You know, there's not as much skill involved as there was.
Barry (PS03W) [8805] No.
              [8806] No, that's right.
              [8807] It's
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8808] Like the
Barry (PS03W) [8809] incredibly passed.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8810] the first, the first season like the football did seem to
              improve but it's not
Barry (PS03W) [8811] That's right.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8812] gonna go back now I think.
Barry (PS03W) [8813] United have got a strange side at the moment though
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8814] Oh yes.
Barry (PS03W) [8815] I mean I don't think you can ... it's alright having all
              these players but if you ... he doesn't seem
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8816] They don't play.
Barry (PS03W) [8817] he doesn't seem to
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8818] They
Barry (PS03W) [8819] have an idea of what he wants.
              [8820] Cos I mean
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8821] No they don't.
Barry (PS03W) [8822] every week he's got a different sort of format.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8823] Well what's he supposed to do?
              [8824] [...] Giggs, Semen [...] .
Barry (PS03W) [8825] Well he had him
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8826] Well I think he's gotta look at, and the team should be in
              with you
Barry (PS03W) [8827] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8828] like.
Barry (PS03W) [8829] He had him playing yesterday, er, but they dropped Hughes.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8830] [laughing] Yeah I know [] .
              [8831] Well you don't drop Hughes for anybody!
Barry (PS03W) [8832] And his two subs, Hughes and Sharp, I mean it does rather
              hamstring
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8833] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8834] you if anything happens to a central defender dunnit?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8835] Yeah.
              [8836] Well I don't think Hughes should ever be sub like, he
              should be on the team.
Barry (PS03W) [8837] Well that's right, even if he's not scoring goals he's
              creating so much pressure and, and
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8838] Yeah, he always done like.
              [8839] Good in defence as well.
Barry (PS03W) [8840] Yeah.
              [8841] That's right.
              [8842] Well he's also summat, er I mean he's, he's one of the
              best ... at holding a ball ... you know
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8843] Fantastic shielding the ball
Barry (PS03W) [8844] on his own.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8845] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8846] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8847] Whitbreads are here.
              [8848] ... Arsenal
Barry (PS03W) [8849] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8850] played well.
Barry (PS03W) [8851] Yeah.
              [8852] ... The crowd were getting at them last night.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8853] Were they?
Barry (PS03W) [8854] The first goal was dreadful!
              [8855] My ... did you see it?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8856] They were winning three nil weren't they?
Barry (PS03W) [8857] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [...]
Barry (PS03W) [8858] Did you see this goal?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8859] No.
              [8860] I remember seeing, but I heard fucking result on News at
              Ten.
Barry (PS03W) [8861] It was a long
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8862] I know.
Barry (PS03W) [8863] it was a ... it was full pass inside to two fullbacks ...
              er, for the ... Southampton player that was running on ... this
              fullback shaded it away ... you know, guiding him out of it, he's
              running to the e ... sa Smeichel came out to the edge of the area
              ... but he was like right on the edge ... as the player was
              coming to him, so he just let it roll a little bit further, he
              stopped it with his foot, the guy came and tackled him off ...
              got it ... instead of just picking it up with his hand, I mean he
              was actually in the area but like ... he was right on the edge
              and he took a step back
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8864] Why the fuck didn't he [...]
Barry (PS03W) [8865] and stopped it with his foot.
              [8866] Yeah.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8867] wait for the ball coming in?
              [8868] ... I tell you Liverpool were really lucky cos er ...
              Bristol Rovers had got a penalty.
Barry (PS03W) [8869] Mm.
              [8870] ... As long they, as long as they win the league I do I
              don't mind.
              [8871] ... Been a long time.
              [8872] Mind you

              [8877] Oh every week they ... putting it together, scoring the
              goals.
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8878] I think they were about a hundred and fifty to one I'm
              standing see if they can win the league.
Barry (PS03W) [8879] Are they?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8880] Yeah.
Barry (PS03W) [8881] Yeah.
              [8882] ... Wouldn't be a bad that actually, cos if it did
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8883] Yeah, they played well the year before they held their own
              see they've got all the
Barry (PS03W) [8884] They played last year didn't they?
Hugh (PS03Y)  [8885] the best lads.

              like Dorego and things like that.
              [8892] Wallace ... not a bad buy.
