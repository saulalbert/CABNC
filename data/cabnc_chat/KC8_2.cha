@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 019603)
*GIL:	Do you want a tea or a coffee? (.)  
*ROB:	Sorry? 
*GIL:	Do you want a tea or a coffee? 
*ROB:	Cup of tea please. 
*GIL:	I've just been filling in my books and reading all about it.  (.) I rang mum up. 
*ROB:	Mm? 
*GIL:	And said to her about erm   (.) putting the kids to bed. 
*ROB:	Mm. 
*GIL:	And said we'll try and get something sorted out before you babysit on the   (.) nineteenth. I said we didn't do too bad. I said Ben was wet but I didn't, his bed wasn't, so   (.) god knows   (  )  (.)  
*ROB:	Is it a marketing exercise for the Sony Walkman really? 
*GIL:	Sorry? 
*ROB:	Is it a marketing exercise for this? 
*GIL:	I don't know. Oh I've just been listening to your conversation with Dennis and Iris. 
*ROB:	Yeah? Was it any good? 
*GIL:	Mm clank, click pheew clank click  ((laugh)) . I couldn't understand what you   (.) you were saying to Iris though. 
*ROB:	Couldn't you? 
*GIL:	No. 
*ROB:	Oh well  (  )  
*GIL:	Well you, all I heard was something about her sorting out some wool   (.) and 
*ROB:	She was doing a tapestry thing.  (.) I'm a little bit erm   (.) concerned with our Darrell. (.)  
*GIL:	Yeah oh I think he's just peed off with his   (.) father.  (.)  or   
*ROB:	 Yeah but it just st   strikes me he's losing perspective of who's doing what for who.  (.) I appreciate that the long term we gain as far as that property, yeah? 
*GIL:	Yeah. 
*ROB:	But the short term, he is not making us rich is he? (.)  
*GIL:	Not by doing it the speed he's doing it. 
*ROB:	If he'd have taken his time and he'd have got himself some more work   (.) yeah? 
*GIL:	Yeah.  (.) Well I think he, it's just Friday night and   (.) he's coming up here tomorrow morning. 
*ROB:	Is he, why? 
*GIL:	Oh, I just said do we see you over the weekend 
*ROB:	Mm. 
*GIL:	and he says he's coming up tomorrow morning and erm   (.) but he's got places to go and people, you know how he says it, places to go   (.) people to see   (.) tomorrow afternoon and Sunday. I asked him if he was going on his boat and he said no. 
*ROB:	No, he's put it in his winter mooring hasn't he? 
*GIL:	No idea. 
*ROB:	Fair weather sailor Jim. Despite all the rum bum baccy stuff. (.)  
*GIL:	I think it's just Friday night and he's   (.) yeah, basically.  (.) I don't think Billy's telling him enough   ((cough)) to be honest. 
*ROB:	Why? 
*GIL:	I just don't. 
*ROB:	 ((yawning)) What, he knows something's happened . But he doesn't know what it is. (.)  
*GIL:	He doesn't seem to be involved in that many   (.) discussions about the company does he?  ((yawning)) Or what's happening. I mean  he was moaning about erm or those trade accounts weren't he? 
*ROB:	Mm.  (.) well it's not for me to say. I don't know anything more about this business than he does. 
*GIL:	Oh no. 
*ROB:	 (  ) go as far as to say we probably know less about what's going on than he does. 
*GIL:	Do we? Oh. Such is life.  (.) I had a word with Steph on the phone. 
*ROB:	Oh? 
*GIL:	She's getting fat. (.)   (  )   
*ROB:	  (  )  
*GIL:	Yeah. She goes to hospital on Thursday. Eighteen week appointment. She's had another scan.  (.) Got to work on Sunday.  (.) They're gonna work from   (.) nine thirty till four thirty this Sunday. 
*ROB:	Mm. 
*GIL:	And then every Sunday up to Christmas. And if the   (.) trading's good enough they're gonna carry it on.  (.) So   (.) how that will go with the Sun  Sunday laws I don't know.  (.) I'm waiting for Tesco's to   (.) foreclose on what they said they were gonna do. 
*ROB:	And what's that then? 
*GIL:	Well they're supposed to be opening on Sundays but didn't Texas and all those get fined last year? 
*ROB:	Mhm. 
*GIL:	For opening on Sundays? 
*ROB:	Yeah but because there's a   (.) European Court   (.) ruling outstanding   (.) local authorities aren't gonna take them to court. 
*GIL:	Oh. (.)  
*ROB:	Because the   (.) shop can just put an injunction on them, stopping them taking it any further. Or they can sue them for loss of income. 
*GIL:	Uhuh. 
*ROB:	Yeah? Are you having this bath? 
*GIL:	Yeah. Are you happy about this car situation? 
*ROB:	Yeah. 
*GIL:	You sure? 
*ROB:	Yeah. It's work I'm   (.) concerned with. 
*GIL:	Why? 
*ROB:	 (  ) enough done. 
*GIL:	You've got Monday  haven't you? 
*ROB:	  (  )  
*GIL:	You've got Monday haven't you? 
*ROB:	Sorry? 
*GIL:	You've got all day Monday. 
*ROB:	Yeah but I need to do some typing. I'm trying to think how the fuck I'm gonna conduct this meeting   (.) with half the company round the table. 
*GIL:	Yeah. 
*ROB:	How I'm gonna run it. (.)  
*GIL:	Well how many's gonna be at this meeting? 
*ROB:	About twelve I think. 
*GIL:	Including Jeff? 
*ROB:	Jeff, Fred.  (.) Brian   who's their manager of operations. 
*GIL:	Jo? 
*ROB:	No. 
*GIL:	Oh!  (.) She's not getting a look in? 
*ROB:	Sorry? 
*GIL:	She's not getting a look in? 
*ROB:	Not so far. 
*GIL:	Ha ha, I bet she winkles her way in if there's a free lunch going. 
*ROB:	There isn't a free lunch on it, it's company internal software. 
*GIL:	Oh.  (7.0) Do you want mum to come to Argos with me tomorrow morning? 
*ROB:	Why? 
*GIL:	Well she isn't, I don't think she's doing anything tomorrow morning. 
*ROB:	Are you asking me? Why are you asking me? 
*GIL:	Cos you said you'd come to Argos with me. 
*ROB:	I said I'd stay here with the kids. 
*GIL:	Oh is that what's the plan of action? 
*ROB:	Yeah. 
*GIL:	Sorry. Right. Okay.  (20.0) Erm, I said I'd try and get over and see Steph one day next week. 
*ROB:	Sorry? 
*GIL:	I said I'd try and see Steph one day next week   (.) and take her some maternity clothes and erm   (.) I'll wash some of these baby things.  (.) If not I've only got to put them up in the attic   (.) and bring them down in   (.) three month's time. So I might as well take them over there and get rid of them. She said she don't mind having the stuff in the house.
