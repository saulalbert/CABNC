*** 1 (Tape 003901) ***
Adam (PS05D)               [1] The two companies concerned are trying to record
                           the spoken word.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [2] We don't want you on tape. ...
Adam (PS05D)               [3] So the thing, the thing to do is to sort of dot
                           around in the conversation things like pre
                           antidisestablishmentarianism.
                           [4] And hopefully [laugh] ...
Carole (PS05B)             [5] This will get modern usage of words.
                           [6] Of, one of the words that she was talking about,
                           people have started using wicked for [...] a normal
                           phrase.
                           [7] I mean, it doesn't mean what it says in the
                           dictionary any more.
Pauline (PS05F)            [8] That's a really wicked thing to say, he went, no
                           it's not it's bad, it's not wicked.
                           [9] He thinks of wicked as being good, he doesn't,
                           cause Mandy says wicked.
Carole (PS05B)             [10] Yeah.
                           [11] ... Well that's the idea anyway.
Pauline (PS05F)            [12] He goes round saying wicked, it's his favourite
                           word. ...
Carole (PS05B)             [13] Are you going to go to sleep, eh?
                           [14] Please [baby gurgling] ... That doesn't mean
                           much, does it?
Adam (PS05D)               [15] She's just looking over there to see which one
                           she wants to throw up on. ...
Carole (PS05B)             [16] Who do you want to go and gurgle at?
                           [17] Eh?
Pauline (PS05F)            [18] Oh not Uncle Brian, no no no. ...
Carole (PS05B)             [19] No?
                           [20] ... Have you had enough grub for a little
                           while?
                           [21] There you are, go and see somebody.
Pauline (PS05F)            [22] [...] she's got a ginormous one.
                           [23] She had it [...] .
                           [24] Well don't [...] to me I've only just you
Adam (PS05D)               [25] Come on, give Auntie Pauline a nice smile.
Carole (PS05B)             [26] Go on, you do lovely smiles. ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [baby talk] ...
Carole (PS05B)             [27] If she smiles it will be at your hairline.
                           [28] Pardon?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [29] She won't be able to see that far, will she?
Carole (PS05B)             [30] She might be able to see a blurred shape.
Pauline (PS05F)            [31] [...] she's just looked this way now.
                           [32] She kept looking over there.
                           [33] Don't know what she was looking at.
                           [34] What were you looking at?
Carole (PS05B)             [35] Well she definitely looks at her mobile.
Adam (PS05D)               [36] Yeah?
Carole (PS05B)             [37] I know it drives you mad, the music but er ...
Adam (PS05D)               [38] I wouldn't mind if those blasted [...] slightly
                           longer life in terms of the music they played.
                           [39] But unfortunately, you know, it's [singing] or
                           whatever.
                           [40] But it's [...] over again.
Carole (PS05B)             [41] Well, yes.
                           [42] Well I mean that's what's nice for them, isn't
                           it?
Pauline (PS05F)            [43] Yeah.
                           [44] You see they've got a short concentration.
Adam (PS05D)               [45] Do you think [...] music in the background
                           [...] sort of, do all the lyrics as well . [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)             [46] Oh of course Oh well done.
                           [47] [...] the last half hour.
Pauline (PS05F)            [48] [...] a little bit wasn't it?
Carole (PS05B)             [49] She's had a lot of that today.
Pauline (PS05F)            [50] Have you? ...
Carole (PS05B)             [51] Well don't put it on too loud, will you?
Pauline (PS05F)            [52] [...] why babies have a suck there.
                           [53] [laugh] You say they're having milk, he went,
                           what do you mean?
                           [54] Milk?
                           [55] What do you mean milk comes out there?
                           [56] [laugh] So I said well it's only when you've
                           just had a baby like, you know, like cows.
Carole (PS05B)             [57] Love him.

Carole (PS05B)    [61] You will speak to, I'm very relaxed.
                  [62] ... I wouldn't like to go for a week in silence. ...
Joelle (PS05C)    [63] You know, I can't stay for a week in silence.
Carole (PS05B)    [64] I didn't think you could. [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)      [65] Oh!
                  [66] Where'd you come from?
                  [67] Oh dear, I thought you were a [...] , there, oh there.

                  [78] Oh, that's what he wants to be isn't it?
Adam (PS05D)      [79] Bad news.
Carole (PS05B)    [80] It's bad news being busy?
                  [81] Why?
                  [82] He, who?
Adam (PS05D)      [83] His wife's laid up in bed
Carole (PS05B)    [84] Why, what's wrong?
Adam (PS05D)      [85] with back pain.
                  [86] She's not allowed to move
Carole (PS05B)    [87] Oh dear.

                  [92] Then he's got to go home at lunchtime and give her some
                  food.
Carole (PS05B)    [93] Aha.
                  [94] Now that kind of busy is ... not the right sort of busy
                  is it?

                  [114] ... I hate this in English.
                  [115] This, this video.
                  [116] ... Oh [laugh] it's the voices I can't stand. [video]
Charlotte (PS05E) [117] Bonk.
Carole (PS05B)    [118] Did it go bonk?
                  [119] [laugh] ... Listen, go away ... She doesn't say go away
                  very much now.
Charlotte (PS05E) [120] Go away.
Carole (PS05B)    [121] Does she?
                  [122] ... Well she's just heard it, that's why, but she
                  doesn't ... she doesn't say it very much does she?
                  [123] No?
                  [124] ... I've only heard it once or twice in the last few
                  ...
Joelle (PS05C)    [125] When I change her nappy?
Carole (PS05B)    [126] Well, that's normal.
                  [127] ... She doesn't want you to change her nappy does she?
                  [128] [laugh] ... Water please.
                  [129] ... Right, let's go and see if these chicken things are
                  ready.
                  [130] ... Right, right, would you like to sort of start
                  getting yourselves into the other room.
                  [131] ... Now the baby's waking up, dinner's ready.
Adam (PS05D)      [132] Is baby waking up?
Carole (PS05B)    [133] She keeps kicking her legs and going, ah, ah.
Adam (PS05D)      [134] Is the [...] ready [...] ?
Carole (PS05B)    [135] No, it's not.
                  [136] I said try and start thinking about getting in there
                  because ...
Adam (PS05D)      [137] How soon?
Carole (PS05B)    [138] About two minutes.
Adam (PS05D)      [139] Shall we start [...] ?
Carole (PS05B)    [140] After dinner, yeah.
Adam (PS05D)      [141] Yeah.
                  [142] [...] Brian and Pauline probably won't arrive till it's
                  virtually over.
Carole (PS05B)    [143] Probably not.
                  [144] ... Do you think Charlotte will eat a turkey steak with
                  garlic and herbs?
                  [145] ... What?
                  [146] I said do you think Charlotte will eat a turkey steak
                  with garlic and herbs?
Adam (PS05D)      [147] We'll see, won't we.
Carole (PS05B)    [148] You hungry?
                  [149] ... Miss?
                  [150] What's happening, ... water please, water, water.
                  [151] Ah, that's that done.
Adam (PS05D)      [152] Oh, it smells good.
Carole (PS05B)    [153] They do don't they?
                  [154] I thought we'd try them for a change.
Adam (PS05D)      [155] They look really nice.
Carole (PS05B)    [156] Like chicken Kiev without a load of sloppy butter.
                  [157] Bit smaller than normal ones.
                  [158] ... [crockery noise] There's a lot of banging and
                  crashing on this tape.
                  [159] ... What else do I need?
                  [160] A plate for Charlotte.
                  [161] ... Brian said, we'll make it tomorrow night, eight to
                  eight thirty.
                  [162] So, cos he had an early, erm, what do you call it,
                  early estimate.
Adam (PS05D)      [163] Oh Charlotte, look what [...] .
Carole (PS05B)    [164] Don't be naughty.
Adam (PS05D)      [165] Can you sort erm, madame out?
Carole (PS05B)    [166] Off you go Jess, go and be fed.
                  [167] ... Is that nice?
                  [168] ... Is that a nice cake?
Charlotte (PS05E) [169] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [170] Mm.
Charlotte (PS05E) [...]
Carole (PS05B)    [171] Pardon?
                  [172] ... Oh you're colouring Postman Pat.
                  [173] ... You've got a black crayon again.
Joelle (PS05C)    [174] It's Charlotte choosing.
Carole (PS05B)    [175] Pardon?
Joelle (PS05C)    [176] It's Charlotte choosing.
Carole (PS05B)    [177] Chose what?
Joelle (PS05C)    [178] The cake!
Carole (PS05B)    [179] Oh, right.
                  [180] ... Did you know what you were choosing?
                  [181] ... Did you walk around Tesco's?
                  [182] Did you walk, or did you sit in your pushchair? ...
Joelle (PS05C)    [183] Tell the truth.
                  [184] ... Did you walk, or did you walk in your pushchair?
Adam (PS05D)      [185] Sit in the pushchair.
Carole (PS05B)    [186] You went in a car didn't you?
                  [187] [...] Have you told Daddy what you did?
                  [188] ... Erm?
                  [189] Go on, you tell Daddy what you did in front of erm
Joelle (PS05C)    [190] We went, we went to Tesco
Adam (PS05D)      [191] Mhm
Joelle (PS05C)    [192] and after Tesco, just next to the door there's some
                  little car
Adam (PS05D)      [193] Oh yeah.
Joelle (PS05C)    [194] for you to go [mimics car]
Carole (PS05B)    [195] Yeah, one of these things you sit in, put twenty P in
                  or whatever it is, and ... have a ride for two minutes.
Joelle (PS05C)    [196] So she said, mm.
                  [197] So I said, you can go in there when we are, when we
                  done the shopping.
                  [198] So I said, if you are a good girl you can choose a
                  cake.
                  [199] So went to Tesco, and we walk around, the cake, erm,
                  cake thing
Carole (PS05B)    [200] Aisle?
Joelle (PS05C)    [201] and er, I said [...]
Carole (PS05B)    [202] Oh Charlotte, don't talk with your mouth full. [...]
Joelle (PS05C)    [203] We went to Tesco to buy some milk.
Adam (PS05D)      [204] To buy some milk?
Carole (PS05B)    [205] Because Sainsbury didn't have any yesterday.
Adam (PS05D)      [206] Did they have any today?
Carole (PS05B)    [207] I don't know, I didn't go today [laugh] .
                  [208] ... What did I do today?
                  [209] [...] I made beans, when I'd finished sorting out this
                  one I [...] .
                  [210] Charlotte don't play with that lovey.
                  [211] ... That's a good girl.
Joelle (PS05C)    [212] Then I went to the bank.
                  [213] Then I went to Tesco.
                  [214] That take me nearly all the er
Carole (PS05B)    [215] All morning.
Joelle (PS05C)    [216] And erm
Carole (PS05B)    [217] Then this afternoon we went to Croydon.
                  [218] Exciting.
Charlotte (PS05E) [219] I went to Tesco.
Carole (PS05B)    [220] You went to Tesco?
Joelle (PS05C)    [221] We are very tired.
Carole (PS05B)    [222] We are.
                  [223] ... Absolutely.
Adam (PS05D)      [224] Who's we?
Carole (PS05B)    [225] Me.
Joelle (PS05C)    [226] We.
Adam (PS05D)      [227] All of us?
Carole (PS05B)    [228] You're not tired.
Joelle (PS05C)    [229] Why not?
Carole (PS05B)    [230] You shouldn't be tired.
Charlotte (PS05E) [231] I'm happy.
Carole (PS05B)    [232] Oh I'm so glad you're happy.
                  [233] ... She's a poor old lady at the moment.
Adam (PS05D)      [234] Is she?
Carole (PS05B)    [235] Poor old lady.
                  [236] Charlotte please don't talk with your mouth full,
                  there's a good girl.
Adam (PS05D)      [237] Keep your mouth closed when you've got something in it
                  or we'll take something away.
Carole (PS05B)    [238] It's not, it's not very nice darling, to do that.
Adam (PS05D)      [239] It's not good manners.
                  [240] We want to bring up a nice girl, not a little pig.
                  [241] ... Alright?
Charlotte (PS05E) [242] [...] pig.
Adam (PS05D)      [243] No, nice girl, not a little pig.
Charlotte (PS05E) [244] [...] pig.
Adam (PS05D)      [245] Yes, nice girl.
                  [246] ... Are you a nice girl?
Charlotte (PS05E) [247] What?
Adam (PS05D)      [248] Not the way you stuff your cake in your mouth like
                  that.
Carole (PS05B)    [249] Dear oh dear.
                  [250] I wouldn't bounce at the same time [...]
Adam (PS05D)      [251] Don't bounce when you're eating please.
                  [252] ... And shut your mouth.
                  [253] ... Good girl.
Charlotte (PS05E) [254] [...] trampoline now.
Carole (PS05B)    [255] You're going on the trampoline.
                  [256] Well finish your mouthful first, please.
Joelle (PS05C)    [257] Or [...]
Carole (PS05B)    [258] Ah that wasn't her fault.
                  [259] ... Have you finished?
                  [260] Have you finished eating?
Charlotte (PS05E) [261] No.
Carole (PS05B)    [262] No?

Adam (PS05D)      [266] Right hand side.
Carole (PS05B)    [267] Oh right.
                  [268] I couldn't work out what you were talking about.
                  [269] It only takes one at a time.
Adam (PS05D)      [270] No it's not [...] now.
Carole (PS05B)    [271] It's bath time really.
Adam (PS05D)      [272] Be bath time in about fifteen minutes.
Carole (PS05B)    [273] I thought you'd finished your cake, haven't you
                  finished?
Joelle (PS05C)    [274] Catch it, one two three ... catch it, one two three.
                  [275] ... I said catch it, you didn't catch it, [...] .

Carole (PS05B)    [276] What? [music]
Joelle (PS05C)    [277] It's Top Of The Pops.
Carole (PS05B)    [278] Top Of The Pops, oh
*** 3 (Tape 003903) ***
Carole (PS05B)             [279] I haven't watched Top of the Pops.
                           [280] [...] will sit there cringing, said I can't
                           believe they put this rubbish on [...] terrible.
Pauline (PS05F)            [281] Who was on it?
Carole (PS05B)             [282] Don't know who was on it actually.
                           [283] Well she doesn't like M C Hammer, he was on,
                           and then there was one week with Germans on it and
                           it was, erm, it's a German group that used to be
                           popular and haven't done a song for ages.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [284] It wasn't the Robots was it?
Carole (PS05B)             [285] Yeah, the Robots.
                           [286] I mean, it was just ... the words they were
                           using, I mean oh ... It makes you cringe, oh and
                           then that er girl ... oh she's done quite a few
                           things recently.
                           [287] ... She sings much better than she talks.
Pauline (PS05F)            [288] [...] back to my diet today.
                           [289] ... Thank you very much, yes I will actually.
Carole (PS05B)             [290] No, it's not my day to diet, been, been
                           naughty today.
                           [291] [...] [baby crying] Oh dear.
Adam (PS05D)               [292] Pop him on the shoulder.

Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [294] Yeah.
*** 4 (Tape 003904) ***
Adam (PS05D)               [295] She was about to but she found a sticker on
                           book [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [296] She comes out well on tape doesn't she?
Carole (PS05B)             [297] Who Charlotte?
Pauline (PS05F)            [298] Mm.
                           [299] I didn't realise how clear her speech was
                           until I heard it on the tape.
                           [300] It's really quite good actually.
Adam (PS05D)               [301] Not bad. ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [302] Oh we'll do this one again. ...
Charlotte (PS05E)          [303] [...] drop off [laugh] ...
Adam (PS05D)               [304] Cos it's lights and things isn't it?
                           [305] She was looking at er lights in Sainsbury's
                           the other day.
                           [306] ... [laugh] It looked like that, didn't it?
Adam (PS05D)               [307] Carol was swaying at her.
Carole (PS05B)             [308] You missed that.
                           [309] I just swayed at her, and she [...] [laugh]
                           [music]
Charlotte (PS05E)          [310] It's Conway Twitty isn't it?
Adam (PS05D)               [311] Is it?
                           [312] Oh no.
                           [313] ... How far back does this go, I suppose early
                           fifties?
Adam (PS05D)               [314] Er nineteen fifty six.
                           [315] I remember Conway Twitty.
Carole (PS05B)             [316] Oh yes.
                           [317] You were in your cradle.
                           [318] [...] Elvis, didn't he? ...
Adam (PS05D)               [319] I don't think he ever recorded it, I think he
                           just used to sing it at his, er sort of cabaret.
Carole (PS05B)             [320] Well so many of these songs have been done by
                           so many people that you would be forgiven for
                           thinking that, that.
                           [321] Because there's one there, one on one of these
                           that er either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel or
                           someone, can't remember which one, probably Art
                           Garfunkel as Paul Simon does all his own doesn't he?
Adam (PS05D)               [322] Well he has done other people's.
Carole (PS05B)             [323] Well there's one on there, I can't remember
Adam (PS05D)               [324] Like for instance the, er, what do they call
                           those two?
                           [325] Oh ... the two brothers.
                           [326] In the
Carole (PS05B)             [327] Everley Brothers?
Adam (PS05D)               [328] The Everley Brothers, that's it.
                           [329] You know, Wake up Little Suzie?
Carole (PS05B)             [330] Oh yeah.
Adam (PS05D)               [331] Well Simon and Garfunkel did that [...]
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [332] Wicked ... far out.
                           [333] ... it's a groovy record this.
Carole (PS05B)             [334] Shut up. [laugh] [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [335] Can't remember which one it is but I'll
                           recognise it when I hear it.
Adam (PS05D)               [336] He's doing very well, isn't he.
Carole (PS05B)             [337] He is.
                           [338] Have to employ him full time.
                           [339] He's always quite good.
Pauline (PS05F)            [340] I just can't believe how daft he is.
Carole (PS05B)             [341] I suppose you like that film. [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [342] Yes. [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [343] Forget it.
Carole (PS05B)             [344] You're not having cake.
Pauline (PS05F)            [345] Does she like cake?
Carole (PS05B)             [346] Well she's looking at it. ...
Adam (PS05D)               [347] So how's things down at the [...] ?
Pauline (PS05F)            [348] Not too bad.
                           [349] Quite good actually. [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [350] Yeah?
Carole (PS05B)             [351] Keeping him busy out on estimates and
Pauline (PS05F)            [352] Yeah he's out ... all this week.
                           [353] Well, my dad won't pass them on to Terry.
                           [354] Me dad said he's had enough [...] Well, we
                           were debating whether to give it to you or not.
                           [355] But I thought, well if Terry notices he might
                           [...] .
                           [356] Well in fact two really big estimates [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [357] Who, Terry?
Pauline (PS05F)            [358] Yeah.
                           [359] And one wanted re-estimating, the other one
                           wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble
                           tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done.
                           [360] We give them a provisional kind of price and
                           not really gone into it in detail.
                           [361] So she had a list of about five things she
                           wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the
                           cheapest.
                           [362] But she's got about six different firms on the
                           computer and was comparing notes.
                           [363] So I worked out [...] and the other two were
                           really fitting and electrics and it was all down to
                           Terry to sort those out.
                           [364] And they're both, about two to three thousand
                           pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to
                           three thousand pounds worth of work.
Adam (PS05D)               [365] Well you can't afford to lose them, can you?
Pauline (PS05F)            [366] No.
Adam (PS05D)               [367] So what's going to happen then?
Pauline (PS05F)            [368] God knows.
                           [369] He said, I asked, asked, well I left a message
                           on Saturday for him to sort them out didn't I?
                           [370] He already knew about that.
                           [371] And then I asked my father on Tuesday to
                           remind him and he said, he'd already said he'd fetch
                           them in on Tuesday.
                           [372] And he, my father reminded him last night and
                           he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning.
                           [373] But he's [...] , he just really has to get in
                           touch with one of them [...] and tell them the
                           prices.
                           [374] So I don't know.
                           [375] [...] Well, I mean he'd done, he's done this
                           first estimate, these are all just polishing touches
                           cos people are obviously interested in, you know
                           they're well keen on our prices.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [376] [...] they can't pursue it till we come back
                           to them.
Pauline (PS05F)            [377] They're not pursuing it until we put these
                           things out.
                           [378] [...] My father just turned round [...] I've
                           had enough of it if Terry's not going to do the
                           estimate he passes them on to Brian.
                           [379] I said yeah then I get into trouble with them
                           for not passing estimates to Terry and then there's
                           an argument.
                           [380] If he, if he says anything to me I'll just
                           have to tell him.
                           [381] But he's not doing the estimates he's been
                           given and he can't afford to throw money away.
                           [382] It's cos he's working for him at the moment
                           [...] money.
                           [383] He always gets like that and then he forgets
                           after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for
                           him.
                           [384] He forgets how annoying he can be and you know
                           he swings the other way.
                           [385] ... I mean Brian's pulled in a lot of work.
                           [386] [...] lot of people kind of saying come back
                           again on Thursday ... So he's, he's [...] .
                           [387] If we got Terry to do that we'd be well away.
                           [388] They, they would love him I mean one of them
                           ... it was annoying really cos Terry's just not
                           pulling his weight. ...
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [389] I don't understand it, if I live to be a
                           hundred I won't understand it.
Pauline (PS05F)            [390] And also, it's cos that, you know after we had
                           that row about Terry, after Bank Holiday expecting
                           not to have to do a day in the shop, and er he's
                           already owing Brian a day?
                           [391] Guess who's doing the extra day? [...] got my
                           dad to cover a day.
                           [392] And then he takes a day off Bank Holidays.
                           [393] [...] and he can't do it because my dad [...]
                           .
                           [394] But then tomorrow he's actually doing his own
                           work.
                           [395] So he could easily have [...] .
                           [396] And on Monday
Adam (PS05D)               [397] So who's covering tomorrow?
Pauline (PS05F)            [398] Well my brother's covered practically all week
                           and Brian's doing tomorrow.
                           [399] ... [...] Terry phoned up asking what, Tuesday
                           morning about quarter past eight said who was
                           covering.
                           [400] And he said well my father is doing today I
                           can't do today I'll do it Friday and I shouted down
                           the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be
                           going in.
                           [401] ... I mean he hasn't been in the shop once
                           this week.
                           [402] ... Somebody's got to tell him to [...] ...
                           [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [403] So do Dave and Terry [...] in the shop [...] .
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [404] They have the records. [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [405] And it hasn't been sorted yet?
Pauline (PS05F)            [406] Oh no.
                           [407] He's got the gall to phone up on Tuesday and
                           say Eileen can't do a day, we're going to be short
                           of Eileen.
Adam (PS05D)               [408] So the answer is to just phone them.
Pauline (PS05F)            [409] I can't do it.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [410] I'm not doing it. [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [411] What's the point of carrying on like that?
Pauline (PS05F)            [412] Well he's going to carry on like that isn't
                           he?
                           [413] Not unless someone puts their foot down.
Adam (PS05D)               [414] And if your father is currently taking your
                           side of things [baby shouting] worth sounding him
                           out as to how far he'll take [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [415] Ah [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [416] whilst he's in the mood?
Pauline (PS05F)            [417] Yeah.
                           [418] He's not being that much [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [419] You sure?
Pauline (PS05F)            [420] Mmm.
                           [421] He's probably only in the mood cos he's
                           probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go
                           out in the evenings.
                           [422] On a Wednesday evening, don't they.
                           [423] Cos Terry
Adam (PS05D)               [424] I mean , wouldn't he rather have Terry as a
                           sort of permanent worker anyway?
Pauline (PS05F)            [425] It's not being fair [...]
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [426] [...] do any work.
Adam (PS05D)               [427] Oh what, your dad?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [428] Pauline's dad [...] er [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [429] [...] too expensive I think.
                           [430] Terry uses the shop to get extra money every
                           so often, uses my dad [...] ticking over running
                           when he [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [431] Why [...] .
                           [432] He does get the offer, I mean [...] [baby
                           shouting]
Pauline (PS05F)            [433] [...] two months and she phoned up and I kind
                           of made out it got lost in the post.
                           [434] I erm ... got, check you've got two days,
                           you've got give me the estimate, it's got to be on
                           because she's expecting it to be done straight away
                           on the computer and sent.
                           [435] And he actually got that one done.
                           [436] Do you know it was only five lines.
                           [437] I mean I could have made it up it was that
                           easy.
                           [438] So I sent that off.
                           [439] She was in first thing, I mean I sent it off
                           that evening she was in first thing the next morning
                           yes that's fine [...] .
                           [440] So he's got that job and another one [...] .
Carole (PS05B)             [441] She's trying isn't she? [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)               [442] I don't understand why it surprises you,
                           that's what gets me.
                           [443] I mean [...] ...
Carole (PS05B)             [444] It's normal behaviour [...] .
                           [445] ... [laugh] Charlotte's done it too. ...
Adam (PS05D)               [446] Can you pass me that er, sheet?
Carole (PS05B)             [447] This?
Pauline (PS05F)            [448] Is that your reading?
                           [449] That's not your regulations you have to read
                           is it?
Carole (PS05B)             [450] Oh no, that's a [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [451] I was going to say that doesn't seem very
                           thick [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [452] No, that's to do with this tape.
Adam (PS05D)               [453] Oh I tell you what is quite funny these, the
                           act.
Carole (PS05B)             [454] Mmm.
Adam (PS05D)               [455] Oh.
                           [456] [...] hereby enacted ... her gracious majesty,
                           you know, etcetera etcetera.
                           [457] What was it, the Lords temporal and spiritual,
                           that's what they call themselves.
Pauline (PS05F)            [458] Now that is, that's [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [459] Yes.
                           [460] Yeah I realise and I hope ... I don't come
                           into contact with too many acts of parliament. ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [461] Oh, we had someone round to see the house
                           yesterday.
Carole (PS05B)             [462] Oh yeah?
Pauline (PS05F)            [463] They came twenty minutes early, there's Brian
                           up in the shower, there's me stuffing things in the
                           cupboard under the stairs.
Carole (PS05B)             [464] [laugh] That's an old trick.
Pauline (PS05F)            [465] I said to Danny, don't open the door.
                           [466] Don't open the door!
                           [467] So as I'm still trying to stuff things away,
                           she opened the door and everything fell out.
                           [468] [...] look round the front room, then they
                           looked round the, the garden.
                           [469] While they were looking round the garden I
                           [...] you've got to get out the shower quick.
Adam (PS05D)               [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [470] I don't know.
                           [471] They'd come down from, they'd come down from,
                           ... erm, somewhere or other.
                           [472] They're just doing a kind of tour of loads and
                           loads of houses cos they keep moving with his job.
Carole (PS05B)             [473] Oh, right.
Pauline (PS05F)            [474] She quite, I think she liked the area, she was
                           saying about the schools and that.
                           [475] ... Mind you, she likes erm [...] and they're
                           all separate, all the best ones round here are [...]
                           .
                           [476] She said don't they have any details?
                           [477] So I said well, no it's not [...] now is it,
                           it's erm, oh it's that school that the [...] .
                           [478] Something and School of Arts now it's called
                           [...] well technical
Adam (PS05D)               [479] School of Arts round here?
Pauline (PS05F)            [480] No it's another, well technical, [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [481] [...] performing arts here.
Pauline (PS05F)            [482] [...] performing arts and that's the technical
Carole (PS05B)             [483] It's a monstrosity.
Pauline (PS05F)            [484] Oh you rotten old pig, you've been sick.
Carole (PS05B)             [485] Oh she hasn't?
                           [486] Oh.
Pauline (PS05F)            [487] Yeah, it's alright. ...
Carole (PS05B)             [488] [...] is it washable?
Pauline (PS05F)            [489] Yeah, I think so.
Adam (PS05D)               [490] You'll soon find out. [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [491] Yes.
                           [492] Do you feel better now?
                           [493] Obviously. ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [494] [...] I think she thinks she's got some milk
                           now.
*** 5 (Tape 003905) ***
Pauline (PS05F)            [495] I thought you said, one, you had to have
                           somebody involved who is?.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [496] No no no one person that's not right.
Pauline (PS05F)            [497] Oh, right .
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [498] There is no, statutory obligation for the
                           person organizing it
Adam (PS05D)               [499] Oh, I know.
Pauline (PS05F)            [500] Well not the organizer surely oh I know I
                           would have thought you'd have to, [...] shoot it
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [501] I'm sure that the social services require
                           psychiatric or
Pauline (PS05F)            [502] Mm, I would of thought so
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [503] obviously medical [...] what you're doing.
                           [504] Mhm but they're to be qualified people
                           involved.
                           [505] But I would have expected that the whole thing
                           would have to be operated by, somebody who was
                           qualified.
Pauline (PS05F)            [506] I don't know, because like, you know like the
                           doctors [...]
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [507] [...] I think it sort of depends how big that
                           you want to get involved in.
                           [508] If you're just somebody who's on the outside
                           providing services, to keep the smooth running of it
                           then you don't really have to know anything about
                           it.
Adam (PS05D)               [509] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [510] But if you're actually involved in it, and you
                           want to be involved in the people, then I think you
                           have to know something about it.
Pauline (PS05F)            [511] Well the other evening they were showing
                           something on T V, one of these doctors', doctors'
                           practices that are opting out or whatever.
                           [512] And they got a stockbroker, someone who used
                           to be a stockbroker, actually managing the whole
                           practice.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [513] Yeah.
Pauline (PS05F)            [514] I mean he's obviously not qualified as a
                           doctor.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [515] Mhm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [516] So I mean I suppose they'll look at it in the
                           same kind of way, somebody who's got managerial,
                           management qualities rather than I suppose people
                           who are interested in the other side of it, the
                           medical side of it, probably, really be geared up to
                           organizing the money side of it wouldn't they,
                           usually one or the other. ...
Adam (PS05D)               [517] So have you done any more calculations on it?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [518] There's nothing really more [...] I mean the
                           whole thing is a budget guesstimate.
                           [519] I've no idea yet, really what, I mean, you
                           know, for instance I don't know how much ratio staff
                           to patients they need, therefore you can't really,
                           you know, follow that up because you've no idea what
                           the costs themselves could be.
Carole (PS05B)             [520] Well you don't know, have you, have you found
                           the statutory requirement for space yet?
                           [521] Per person. ...
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [522] I think the thing is going to come unstuck ...
                           in the, I think the biggest thing is, I was
                           thinking, is the fact that you've got to get [...] I
                           wouldn't get a commitment from Social Services until
                           they see a property actually ready for occupation.
                           [523] Now I'm not gonna be prepared to go through
                           the whole business and then find them say oh sorry
                           you're wrong.
Adam (PS05D)               [524] Property is the biggest bugbear.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [525] Yeah.
                           [526] Because I don't think
Adam (PS05D)               [527] If you're actually sitting on [...]
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [528] I don't think the banks are gonna want to
                           invest.
                           [529] To be perfectly frank.
                           [530] ... You see the only way we can get equity out
                           and put money in ourselves is by selling this place.
Adam (PS05D)               [531] Yes.
Carole (PS05B)             [532] Therefore if we don't actually want to live in
                           the same place as the residents, which I certainly
                           wouldn't want to do, right.
                           [533] We'd have to buy two [...] adjoining.
                           [534] Yeah.
                           [535] So that either means providing it, or
                           something further down the scale [...] .
                           [536] I mean that's, huge.
                           [537] That to be honest is, is somebody who's like,
                           been doing this for ten years and has already got
                           themselves like half a million pounds of worth of
                           equity.
                           [538] You know it's a huge property.
Pauline (PS05F)            [539] But you would need a large property to do what
                           you want?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [540] I don't think so.
*** 6 (Tape 003906) ***
Adam (PS05D)               [541] It would be eleven bedrooms and five
                           receptions [...] .
                           [542] The point is, that ... you've got to count, if
                           [...] , you've got to count one bedroom [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [543] Yes, I've got [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [544] you count one bedroom for all the [...] .
                           [545] You may even have to count two.
                           [546] You certainly got to count one.
                           [547] So two bedrooms out of twelve are no longer
                           available.
Carole (PS05B)             [548] Sorry?
                           [549] Say that again in English.
Pauline (PS05F)            [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [550] They're coming to collect the stuff next
                           Thursday.
                           [551] But I don't have to do it every day all day.
                           [552] It's twenty tapes.
                           [553] So that's twenty times ninety minutes.
                           [554] [...] talking about his [...] estimates.
                           [555] Very exciting stuff and I've been telling her
                           not to speak so loudly.
                           [556] Have you had enough now?
Adam (PS05D)               [557] and then I'm talking about [...] right?
                           [558] It's gonna cost five and a half thousand [...]
                           mortgage.
                           [559] At this point [...] would cost about ... just,
                           just about half.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [560] Six bedrooms would pro , six bedrooms would
                           probably cost you two [...] to buy.
                           [561] [...] five and six bedroom houses and you
                           won't get anything under two hundred thousand
                           pounds.
Adam (PS05D)               [562] How much do you wanna to bet on that?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [563] Mm?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [564] Where?
Adam (PS05D)               [565] I've been waiting for [...] on one.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [566] Where?
Adam (PS05D)               [...]
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [567] You've got to spend as much or twice as much
                           there as you would there as you would anywhere else.
                           [568] Those other properties, there isn't half the
                           amount of work ... need doing there as [...] .
                           [569] [...] needs a lot of work.
                           [570] If we moved in then we'd have to spend fifty
                           thousand pound to get it up to scratch.
                           [571] That's just to live in.
Adam (PS05D)               [572] Alright, O K, let's say two hundred grand, O
                           K?
                           [573] It's still fifty per cent less than one of
                           those properties at Harrow Road, right?
                           [574] Fifty per cent less on the mortgage means erm
                           about three and a half thousand [...] .
                           [575] It's effectively eighteen thousand per annum
                           saved, right?
                           [576] The cost of ... and [...] gain four bedrooms
                           [...] ...
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [577] [...] the cheaper it should become.
Adam (PS05D)               [578] Oh yes it is, I don't doubt it ... but the
                           problem is [...] right?
                           [579] And you've got to be realistic.
                           [580] Because no bank is going to give you the money
                           against the costs of the value of the property
                           right?
                           [581] They're gonna give you the [...] against
                           equity [...] equity of some sort.
                           [582] But the only way you can get the equity,
                           right?
                           [583] The only way we could get the equity.
                           [584] We could do it.
                           [585] [...] [talk simultaneous] The only thing I
                           could do [...] I mean at the same time I'm saying O
                           K I'll go in to do it this way, would be to actually
                           say, sod this for a lark, instead of doing erm ...
                           totally private thing, gonna set up a private
                           limited company [...] to issue [...] cheques.
Joelle (PS05C)             [586] I really couldn't ... I would never get the
                           price I'd want for the alphabet.

Adam (PS05D)               [604] Excuse me, excuse me ladies.

                           washed.
Adam (PS05D)               [615] That is not for me to contribute to.
Carole (PS05B)             [616] [...] I haven't said anything about it.
                           [617] ... [baby noises] Amy .
                           [618] Let go of my neck.
                           [619] [baby noises] She's a major contributor to
                           these tapes, aren't you?
Adam (PS05D)               [...] [baby noises] ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [620] Shall we take her for a walk? [baby shouting]
Carole (PS05B)             [621] You really must think we're daft.
                           [622] He's sleeping down here tonight.
                           [623] It's bad enough being woken up by the baby
                           without going back to bed and then being woken up by
                           [...] .
Pauline (PS05F)            [624] I've been going to bed at half past one and I
                           was doing the T M A for two nights, then I've been
                           doing his V A T for two nights so I've got to bed
                           really really late and I just and, the thing is, the
                           T M A were all on about my [...] then I just start
                           to relax [...] [baby shouting] ... I had to resort
                           to herbal knockout drops.
Carole (PS05B)             [625] Oh that's very naughty.
Pauline (PS05F)            [626] Right.
                           [627] Definitely smoking [...] .
                           [628] Well, we were sitting there doing the V A T
                           and I thought, I don't know that's just not [...]
                           but ...
Charlotte (PS05E)          [629] How much is it when you want to go cinema?
Pauline (PS05F)            [630] Oh, [...] about two seventy five I think but
                           I'm not sure
Carole (PS05B)             [631] Is it as little as that?
Pauline (PS05F)            [632] it might be more but [...] .
                           [633] Well I'd either do it that way or pay, erm,
                           credit cards.
                           [634] I don't really take any notice.
                           [635] Terrible
Carole (PS05B)             [636] Naughty, isn't it?
Pauline (PS05F)            [637] I don't think it's terrible [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [638] White Fang.
Pauline (PS05F)            [639] Oh what on earth's that?
Carole (PS05B)             [640] It's the latest Disney extravaganza, and a
                           wolf cub in it, oh Kirsty [...] loves [...] .
Charlotte (PS05E)          [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [641] Oh isn't it?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [642] No, it says here, the story of a young wolf.
                           ...
Carole (PS05B)             [643] Oh, she'll probably like that [...]
Charlotte (PS05E)          [644] [...] tomorrow we'll go somewhere and spend my
                           money. [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [645] Yes I suppose by the time she's here [...]
                           look different.
Pauline (PS05F)            [646] Gonna have your hair done? [...] a perm.
Carole (PS05B)             [647] She hasn't got enough to have a perm, has she
                           now?
Pauline (PS05F)            [648] [...] I think she's gonna grow it out.
                           [649] She's gonna, perm the top so she can grow it
                           out.
                           [650] I told you, didn't I say, as soon as she gets
                           it cut she'll be growing it out.
                           [651] [...] Where are you going to get it done?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [652] Er in [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [653] [...] they normally cut it well.
                           [654] Bit expensive though.
Carole (PS05B)             [655] Twenty one pounds forty five. [laugh]
Pauline (PS05F)            [656] Just to have it cut and blow dried?
Carole (PS05B)             [657] Regardless of whether it's a restyle or trim.
Pauline (PS05F)            [658] Bit expensive.
Carole (PS05B)             [659] That is.
Pauline (PS05F)            [660] Mind you, my hair was a lot better when I was
                           having it done [...] .
Carole (PS05B)             [661] I must admit though it looked lovely, I'll say
                           that.
Pauline (PS05F)            [662] I only had a trim, but the blow dry made it
                           sort of Do you remember when I got that, my hair cut
                           really short?
                           [663] They did that, and that was, that was really
                           nice.
                           [664] When I look back at the photographs I think
                           ... And even when it was long I had, there was one
                           hairdresser there called Paul, whom I'd go and see
                           regularly [...] .
                           [665] I'd go and see him regularly because he did it
                           really well, once he left ...
Carole (PS05B)             [666] Well I had one like that, you know when we
                           used to go to that gym up in Chelsea?
Pauline (PS05F)            [667] Mind you my regular's back and she charges
                           three pounds.
Carole (PS05B)             [668] [...] six weeks.
Pauline (PS05F)            [669] [...] I haven't been since, what [...] isn't
                           it?
                           [670] [...] Trouble is now, cos I know a hairdresser
                           [...] the shop, if I go somewhere else, it looks a
                           bit you know and yet I'm not very satisfied with the
                           way he cuts it, he's done it cheap.
                           [671] ... Mind you, he did Mandy's [...] at Mandy's,
                           I thought that was quite nice.
                           [672] [...] ... Have you got a hiccup?
Carole (PS05B)             [673] Caught it off Amy.
Pauline (PS05F)            [674] She's gone to sleep now? ...
Carole (PS05B)             [675] They are aren't they?
                           [676] But he phoned up to order it and said oh my
                           wife likes these soppy things, he bought it, I
                           didn't.
                           [677] It had nothing to do with me.
                           [678] Then he wants me to tape it so he can have it
                           in the car cos it's on C D. [music]
Pauline (PS05F)            [679] Hold your breath.
                           [680] [...] drink some water, concentrate [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [681] Well, if you want to get rid of hiccups, drink
Pauline (PS05F)            [682] Hold your breath and [...] push [...] seems to
                           work on me.
Carole (PS05B)             [683] [...] stand on your head.
                           [684] Run round the block or something.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [685] Why can I, er I can't have hiccup?
Carole (PS05B)             [686] Because you don't like them.
                           [687] You keep complaining every time you get
                           hiccups, you say oh I don't like them.
                           [688] I'm trying to help get rid of them, sorry.
                           [loud bang]
Pauline (PS05F)            [689] Supposed to work isn't it? [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)             [690] Once she's gone, once she's gone she's gone.
                           [691] ... [cough] ... Oh dear, oh we've come to the
                           end.
                           [692] Oy, psst, you are a little fidget.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [693] Where is Adam and Brian?
Carole (PS05B)             [694] Mm?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [695] Where is Adam and Brian?
Carole (PS05B)             [696] They're not having a cigar, they're walking
                           round the block.
                           [697] They're not having a cigar.
                           [698] So they keep telling me.
Pauline (PS05F)            [699] They've gone out for a walk to have a cigar
                           but as far we're concerned they're not having a
                           cigar.
Carole (PS05B)             [700] They think we're stupid and we don't realize
                           [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [701] Well, I'm not supposed to tell you but he was
                           smoking on the station when we just caught sight of
                           him.
Carole (PS05B)             [702] Well I'm sure he was.
Pauline (PS05F)            [703] I said how am I not supposed to say anything,
                           I said I don't approve why should I keep this quiet?
                           [704] Cos it's not good for you.
                           [705] [laugh] It's not on.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [706] Brian is, because we've been out a couple of
                           times and he does, I mean if we go out he'll smoke
                           then and then he just normally stops.
Carole (PS05B)             [707] Yes, he had one to celebrate, but he didn't
                           just buy one he bought a box.
                           [708] So of course he had to keep smoking them until
                           he'd finished
Pauline (PS05F)            [709] Until they'd gone, yes.
Carole (PS05B)             [710] And he told me, well quite soon [baby shouts]
                           quite soon after she came along.
                           [711] I think he actually went for a walk with
                           Brian.
Pauline (PS05F)            [712] Oh, I assume he brought [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [713] No, no, this was the last one.
                           [714] I said, you had the last one two days ago.
                           [715] [laugh] So the last one of packet number I
                           don't know what.
Pauline (PS05F)            [716] Well Brian can stop [...] terrible now, he's
                           really snoring, god [...] .
                           [717] I've got to the point now, I kick him and tell
                           him to turn over, he turns it over and it's just as
                           bad as before.
Carole (PS05B)             [718] Yeah, yeah.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [719] I don't want to be married.
Pauline (PS05F)            [720] No, don't bother [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)             [721] Well at least have separate rooms.
Pauline (PS05F)            [722] I wouldn't mind, but it's normally me that
                           goes and sleeps on the settee and I don't see why I
                           should.
                           [723] ... Well, no the other day he said if I'm
                           really that bad you just tell me and I'll go down
                           and sleep on the sofa.
                           [724] And I went ... berserk about two nights later
                           and said for god's sake you're driving me bonkers,
                           go away and sleep on the sofa.
                           [725] He's turned over and started snoring. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)             [726] Well he can be lying there sometimes and I'll
                           say, will you roll over please.
                           [727] Mm.
                           [728] ... Go on then.
                           [729] Mm.
                           [730] Will you please roll over!
                           [731] Or some of the time I've been sitting there in
                           the bed feeding the baby, you know
Pauline (PS05F)            [732] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)             [733] and [...] go shut up!
                           [734] Shut up!
                           [735] It's awful.
Pauline (PS05F)            [736] Well, I've found now I do a combination of ...
                           what's that stuff, erm, orbathol that seems to help
                           a bit.
                           [737] I don't think it helps him, it helps me calm
                           down and go to sleep.
Carole (PS05B)             [738] [laugh] Knock out drops.
Pauline (PS05F)            [739] [...] put that all over, I keep forgetting to
                           take those herbal tablets, they seem to help with
                           colds or whatever but I haven't got those upstairs
                           at the moment which doesn't help.
                           [740] And then last night I just took my stuff and
                           knocked myself out instead.
                           [741] I don't see why I should have to knock myself
                           out [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [742] [...] have to be a man unfortunately.
Pauline (PS05F)            [743] Trouble is I go into such a deep sleep I can't
                           wake up in the morning if I do, you know, take the
                           herbal stuff, I [...] , I'm flat out in the morning,
                           can't wake up.
                           [744] I think I got up about half past eight this
                           morning.
Carole (PS05B)             [745] Goodness me.
Pauline (PS05F)            [746] I had to go to work about nine. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)             [747] Oh what are you doing?
                           [748] Oh shut up.
                           [749] Go away. ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [750] And he gets hiccups.
                           [751] He eats too much too quickly.
                           [752] He gets really violent hiccups though, you
                           know, really ... th , they sound ... very, very
                           painful.
Carole (PS05B)             [753] My baby's ones do.
Pauline (PS05F)            [754] Mm.
                           [755] You know when it, you can just hear everything
                           going ckkk ooh.
                           [756] ... Is she awake?
Carole (PS05B)             [757] No.
                           [758] [...] I'll have to put you down some time.
Pauline (PS05F)            [759] I felt so sorry for Christine.
                           [760] Do you know she's now, she was quite cuddly,
                           she was fat in the pregnancy when I saw her last
                           time.
                           [761] And in the space of three weeks I think the
                           baby's used up all her ... fat because she's now
                           just really, really pregnant.
                           [762] But, not so much her face, but all the top
                           part of her looks slim, almost, you know I mean,
                           she's got no fat left there, on her arms it's all
                           gone.
                           [763] Just a bit left on her legs so the baby must
                           have used up all if the baby carries on like this
                           she'll be anaemic I think.
Carole (PS05B)             [764] When's she due?
                           [765] Did you say?
Pauline (PS05F)            [766] Eleventh, so she's got another, almost two,
                           well [...] two weeks, ten days.
Carole (PS05B)             [767] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [768] She said she can't sit down, can't stand up.
                           [769] I was just sitting there for about five
                           minutes then she got up, then she, ooh, sat down,
                           then she got up.
                           [770] [laugh] I don't think it can be too long.
Carole (PS05B)             [771] Now what about that then?
                           [772] I can't believe how quickly the time's gone.
Pauline (PS05F)            [773] Mm.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [774] [...] ... Do you want to sit down [...] ? ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [775] [...] broke today.
Carole (PS05B)             [776] Ooh broke?
Pauline (PS05F)            [777] I mean I was, one minute I was walking round,
                           I hadn't touched anything another minute it was
                           catching my finger.
                           [778] I looked down to see what was kind of stinging
                           my finger and the ring had snapped and was pinching
                           where it caught my finger. [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [779] I can't get mine off.
Pauline (PS05F)            [780] Well I can't wear a wedding ring now, it, just
                           cos it's so wide, it's a really wide one.
                           [781] And if I wear [...] where I had the eternity
                           ring on and the engagement ring and the wedding ring
                           [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [782] it just felt like arthritis, it used to get
                           really painful.
                           [783] So I said oh blow this that's coming off.
                           [784] I suppose I'll have to get another wedding
                           ring.
                           [785] ... It's fashionable to have a kind of [...]
                           reason [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [786] I don't think so.
                           [787] ... So I'm feeling less and less married the
                           more rings I keep breaking.
Carole (PS05B)             [788] I can't get my wedding ring off.
Pauline (PS05F)            [789] No.
                           [790] Well, my fingers get swelling as well, so I
                           thought it wouldn't do any harm. [...]
Charlotte (PS05E)          [791] Well I have finished [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [792] Well they're all up there.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [793] O K.
                           [794] Well I could not ask you before.
Carole (PS05B)             [795] Well, yeah, if you look, ooh, I can't think
                           where.
                           [796] I think there's a book-rack up there and I
                           think some of them, the patterns are out of the
                           magazine and they're just, in a rack, I think.
                           [797] If you go up there just leave them as they are
                           don't leave them all over the place.
                           [798] [...] put them back.
Pauline (PS05F)            [799] Are you making something?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [800] [laugh] Depends how much time I've got.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [801] Yeah. [laugh]
Pauline (PS05F)            [802] What are you going to make?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [803] Some [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [804] Yeah?
Carole (PS05B)             [805] What the ski , lycra type one?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [806] Little?
Carole (PS05B)             [807] Lycra.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [808] Oh that one, no.
Carole (PS05B)             [809] [...] fabric [...] .
                           [810] Do you want the fitted or loose?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [811] You want like, like that, floaty?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [812] Like, like these, or, more like jogging pants?
Charlotte (PS05E)          [813] No, like these. ...
Carole (PS05B)             [814] Well if you want them to stay pretty as
                           opposed to going baggy then you'll need to have a
                           bit of lycra in the fabric.
                           [815] ... Keeps the shape better.
Pauline (PS05F)            [816] Mandy loves her top.
Carole (PS05B)             [817] Oh, the body?
                           [818] The body?
Pauline (PS05F)            [819] Yeah, she was wearing it flat out when she was
                           [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [820] So you didn't get a look in then?
Pauline (PS05F)            [821] Oh no, I was wrestling it off to wash it in
                           the end.
                           [822] She kind of wore it with everything she could
                           think of I think that would go.
                           [823] Mind you, I don't think it's come out of the
                           washing at the moment, I think it's getting water
                           [...] .
                           [824] I haven't seen it recently.
Carole (PS05B)             [825] Quite versatile really.
Pauline (PS05F)            [826] Yeah, yes she wore it with a lot of you know
                           trousers and skirts and ... The big thing at the
                           moment is a new polo neck that we got from [...] .
                           [827] It's actually ever such a good one.
                           [828] An X Together one, you know Together the label
                           [...] ?
Carole (PS05B)             [829] So [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [830] Yeah.
                           [831] But you also buy it in, er, Alders, they've
                           got them.
                           [832] [...] . So it's normally quite expensive ...
                           and it's, it's lovely material and it comes down to
                           about here.
                           [833] We got it for four pound fifty.
                           [834] Ever so cheap.
Carole (PS05B)             [835] That's [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [836] Oh, right, yes I've seen it, I've seen it.
Pauline (PS05F)            [837] Well ever so often what they do they get the
                           ex catalogue stuff.
                           [838] You know you can get some quite good buys like
                           end of the season.
Carole (PS05B)             [839] Who are they?
Pauline (PS05F)            [840] You get the end of season and it's ... if you
                           look at the labels and go for the decent labels then
                           you don't get sort of, quite reasonable quality.
Carole (PS05B)             [841] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [842] I got quite a few things in there.
                           [843] I'll probably have a stroll round there just
                           to get a tracksuit for, when Michael was [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [844] [...] childrens' tracksuit.
Pauline (PS05F)            [845] I used to, I bought loads and loads in there.
Carole (PS05B)             [846] Joelle?
                           [847] Could you just take the carrycot up and put it
                           on the floor?
                           [848] Just so that it's upstairs, for me.
Charlotte (PS05E)          [849] On the floor? [...] bedroom floor?
Carole (PS05B)             [850] Well I haven't cleared the cot out, so ...
Charlotte (PS05E)          [851] O K.
Pauline (PS05F)            [852] [...] it's funny cos I just ... I thought ooh,
                           I'll buy it for her cos ... you know she doesn't
                           [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [853] four pound fifty I didn't mind.
                           [854] [...] . But it actually really suits her, it's
                           a kind of sl almost ... maroony red, burgundy type
                           red, not quite and er ... it's a really good colour.
                           [855] [...] ... Christine got a load of her
                           pregnancy stuff there.
                           [856] Cos she said I'm not paying a fortune for ...
                           stuff that I won't wear afterwards.
                           [857] So she bought [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [858] Is there maternity clothes then?
Pauline (PS05F)            [859] Well, if you look, yeah.
                           [860] Well she got a kind of raincoat, that, I don't
                           think it's supposed to be maternity I think it's
                           just supposed to be [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [861] [...] Oh yes, cos that was the fashion wasn't
                           it?
Pauline (PS05F)            [862] Yeah, yeah.
                           [863] So she's, she's got one there.
                           [864] I think she paid [...] eight pound for it, and
                           it, it looks [...] raincoat [...] .
                           [865] And it still fits, it still fits over the
                           hump.
                           [866] But she's huge.
Carole (PS05B)             [867] I really got away with it, you know.
                           [868] I, didn't have a coat right the way through.
Pauline (PS05F)            [869] Mm.
                           [870] [...] when it rains, that's all.
Carole (PS05B)             [871] Really lucky. [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [872] [...] she hasn't got a car, or anything.
                           [873] She's
Carole (PS05B)             [874] Oh, dear.
Pauline (PS05F)            [875] So she has to walk round ... well, Chris sold
                           his car didn't he cos they want to save up and get a
                           house. ...
Carole (PS05B)             [876] Even through the snow I survived.
                           [877] Very lucky.
                           [878] Cos I refused to go out and buy a coat.
Pauline (PS05F)            [879] I used to wear one [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [880] I had a jumper that my mum knitted that went
                           wrong and ended up twice the size it should have
                           been.
                           [881] But that came in useful. [laugh]
Pauline (PS05F)            [882] Yeah.
                           [883] ... Well, when Mandy was ... when I was
                           pregnant with Mandy I used to wear this old, you
                           know those rabbit skin coats [...] coney coat what
                           they're called?
                           [884] Fur coat thing.
Carole (PS05B)             [885] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [886] Well it was a kind of fur coat but it was
                           rabbit I think, it was.
                           [887] I got one, ooh, well it was really fashionable
                           then so it was quite beautiful sixteen years ago.
Carole (PS05B)             [888] I'd probably know what you mean if I saw it.
Pauline (PS05F)            [889] It's just a little jacket kind of thing.
                           [890] So when I was pregnant that would be, that was
                           fine cos it just [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [891] Sat on top?
Pauline (PS05F)            [892] Yeah, sat on top really.
                           [893] And er with Michael I'd gone out in Richard's
                           and bought mys , ever such a full raincoat when it
                           was in fashion.
                           [894] I still had it in the wardrobe so I just used
                           to [...] .
                           [895] But I still had more room than I needed in
                           that so that was quite useful.
                           [896] ... Actually Christine [...] normal size
                           twelve dress that happened to be a full dress.
Carole (PS05B)             [897] Oh, a baggy one.
Pauline (PS05F)            [898] And she's, she's quite [...] it's a kind of
                           cottony, stretchy, you know those ones that you have
                           a V and then they're quite full, like this is full
                           from there?
Carole (PS05B)             [899] Oh, I know, yeah.
Pauline (PS05F)            [900] This is like a V.
                           [901] Well the V's just kind of gone up.
                           [902] [laugh] It actually looked quite nice on her.
                           [903] She didn't look too bad considering.
Carole (PS05B)             [904] I hardly wore any dresses.
Pauline (PS05F)            [905] Well she's got, she said she just wears the
                           three, I don't think she likes ... like the
                           trousers.
Carole (PS05B)             [906] Oh it's boring, isn't it, being pregnant?
                           [907] Because you don't want to go and buy as many
                           clothes as you would have in your wardrobe normally.
Pauline (PS05F)            [908] The killer is when you've got to go out to a
                           special occasion isn't it?
Carole (PS05B)             [909] Yes.
Pauline (PS05F)            [910] And you know you've got to [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [911] Yeah.
                           [912] I bought this really expensive one, you know I
                           was [...] can't remember [...] a wedding or
                           something so I had to buy something.
                           [913] Finished your discussion?
Carole (PS05B)             [914] You enjoyed your non-smoking did you?
Adam (PS05D)               [915] Sorry?
Carole (PS05B)             [916] You enjoyed your non-smoking did you? [laugh]
Pauline (PS05F)            [917] Is it cold out?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [918] No [...] mild.
                           [919] [...] . It's a bit, nippy round the gills.
Pauline (PS05F)            [920] Mm.
                           [921] ... Mm
Adam (PS05D)               [922] Well I'm going fishing on Saturday.
                           [923] Do you wanna dozen, a trout, if you, if I
Pauline (PS05F)            [924] Oh yes please.
Adam (PS05D)               [925] have any success?
Pauline (PS05F)            [926] Yes.
                           [927] Yes I enjoyed that trout last time.
Carole (PS05B)             [928] He doesn't even like it.
Pauline (PS05F)            [929] He doesn't like trout?
Carole (PS05B)             [930] Well he does, but he won't eat it.
Pauline (PS05F)            [931] Why won't you eat it?
Adam (PS05D)               [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [932] I suggest having trout for dinner, no.
                           [933] Don't fancy it.
Adam (PS05D)               [934] I like er
Carole (PS05B)             [935] [...] we've actually had trout in the freezer
                           for ages, and not used them [...] fresh the day I
                           got them [...] I'll use it and ...
Adam (PS05D)               [936] I'm keen on trout if it's got a sauce.
Carole (PS05B)             [937] Mm.
Adam (PS05D)               [938] But to be honest I shouldn't be eating that
                           sort of thing anyway, so
Pauline (PS05F)            [939] I like it best with almonds, flaked almonds on
                           the top.
Adam (PS05D)               [940] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [941] And that's not on my diet either. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)             [942] Actually onions and mushrooms in garlic butter
Adam (PS05D)               [943] How've you been doing?
Pauline (PS05F)            [944] Oh alright, yeah.
                           [945] Last, I broke it last night [...] didn't have
                           enough time cos I was, if I'm doing his books all
                           afternoon.
Adam (PS05D)               [946] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [947] And I didn't have time to cook so he went out,
                           cos I broke it last night [...] , well I was alright
                           up to lunchtime.
                           [948] It's dinner time again.
                           [949] I shall start again tomorrow.
                           [950] Other than that I don't usually break it.
Adam (PS05D)               [951] How much have you lost?
Pauline (PS05F)            [952] I haven't really lost, in weight I haven't
                           lost any more but it's coming, my body's
Adam (PS05D)               [953] It's shaping you up?
Pauline (PS05F)            [954] Yeah, yes.
                           [955] Cos, kind of, all my clothes [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [956] You look a bit thinner in the face and neck.
Pauline (PS05F)            [957] Yeah.
                           [958] I think it's ... maybe it's turned to muscle,
                           I don't know.
Carole (PS05B)             [959] Redistributing
Pauline (PS05F)            [960] Yeah, yeah.
                           [961] I don't know how to describe it.
                           [962] Cos I'm not actually losing weight, but my
                           clothes all feel, you know I can get into clothes I
                           haven't worn for ages.
Adam (PS05D)               [963] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)             [964] Well Suzy's going to Weightwatchers again.
Pauline (PS05F)            [965] Is she?
Carole (PS05B)             [966] She doesn't look like she needs to really.
Pauline (PS05F)            [967] She's put on a little bit of weight.
Carole (PS05B)             [968] She has put on a bit, but
Adam (PS05D)               [969] I tell you what Suzy, Suzy's problem is her
                           rump and her ... her
Pauline (PS05F)            [970] Yeah her legs.
Adam (PS05D)               [971] and her thighs.
                           [972] That's where she
Carole (PS05B)             [973] Because if you look at the top of her, you you
                           wouldn't think
Adam (PS05D)               [974] No, you wouldn't think she was overweight.
                           [975] Take a picture of her head and shoulders.
Carole (PS05B)             [976] Mm.
                           [977] You'd think she was skinny.
Adam (PS05D)               [978] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)             [979] Well, she went right down to a size ten when
                           she lost all that weight before.
Adam (PS05D)               [980] What is she now?
Carole (PS05B)             [981] Fourteen.
Adam (PS05D)               [982] Blimey.
Pauline (PS05F)            [983] Mm.
                           [984] So she has got a problem then.
Carole (PS05B)             [985] It's all round the bottom.
                           [986] Mind you, cycling should help that.
                           [987] She's out cycling here and getting the train
                           in the morning.
                           [988] Keeps her bike in the garage and pops on the
                           train.
Adam (PS05D)               [989] So you don't need a lot of [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [990] [...] in the garage.
Pauline (PS05F)            [991] No that's right.
Adam (PS05D)               [992] [...] jacket.
                           [993] Mind you, isn't there some restrictions on
                           what you can do with fridges?
Pauline (PS05F)            [994] I think you can ask the council to take it
                           away or something or take it to the dump
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [995] you can take it down the tip, [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [996] They recycle CFC's don't they?
Pauline (PS05F)            [997] That's right, yeah.
Adam (PS05D)               [998] Really goes against the grain to see [...] .
Pauline (PS05F)            [999] Mm.
                           [1000] Well we don't really need another one.
                           [1001] We've got a fridge in the [...] at work,
                           there's one in the kitchen
Carole (PS05B)             [1002] Can't you find [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [1003] Can't you find what?
Carole (PS05B)             [1004] [...] or something?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1005] Well it's difficult, isn't it really?
                           [1006] Because it's, it's er under, under worktop
                           ... [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [1007] Well, if, if they enquire they're only
                           enquiring [...] .
Pauline (PS05F)            [1008] That's true.
                           [1009] ... Just ask for a fiver.
                           [1010] Cos if you say nothing they probably ...
                           think there's something wrong
Carole (PS05B)             [1011] not working so they don't want to take it.
                           [1012] [...] have to get somebody to take it away.
                           ...
Adam (PS05D)               [1013] Well I think it's going to be a case of phone
                           the council and ask them to [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [1014] Do they take them? ...
Adam (PS05D)               [1015] I don't think I'll get it in the car anyway.
                           ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [1016] Who's asleep proper now?
Carole (PS05B)             [1017] [...] now isn't she?
                           [1018] Pardon?
Adam (PS05D)               [1019] She gone?
Carole (PS05B)             [1020] I'm not sure.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1021] Well how much does it cost to get in the
                           cinema [...] ?
Adam (PS05D)               [1022] About four quid isn't it.
Carole (PS05B)             [1023] Is it?
                           [1024] [laugh] I'll have to buy the tickets
                           occasionally.
Adam (PS05D)               [1025] I think it's about three, three seventy five.
                           [1026] Something like that.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1027] Oh, cos Joelle was trying to, trying to work
                           out if she can afford to have her hair done and go
                           to the cinema.
Adam (PS05D)               [1028] What does she wanna go and see?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1029] White Fang.
Adam (PS05D)               [1030] White what?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1031] It's the latest Walt Disney.
                           [1032] It's a story about a wolf.
Adam (PS05D)               [1033] Oh that one.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1034] [...] Fantasia.
Carole (PS05B)             [1035] What'd you say?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1036] We want to go and see that [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [1037] Fantasia's coming out [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [1038] It's a last, last ditch attempt to get some
                           money out of it, is it?
Adam (PS05D)               [1039] And what was the other one?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1040] I was told, wasn't I?
                           [1041] Fantasia and ...
Carole (PS05B)             [1042] It wasn't one we wanted
Pauline (PS05F)            [1043] Hundred and One Dalmatians?
Carole (PS05B)             [1044] No, no, we would have wanted that.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [1045] Oh yeah that's it.
                           [1046] Yes it was, yeah
Adam (PS05D)               [1047] [...] latest one, it made a massive, massive
                           loss apparently.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1048] I shouldn't bother about it [...] .
                           [1049] It's so boring.
Carole (PS05B)             [1050] I'd like Fantasia.
                           [1051] I'd probably be sad and disappointed.
                           [1052] My memory of it would probably be [...] .
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1053] Yeah, of course you saw it as a kid, didn't
                           you?
Carole (PS05B)             [1054] [...] fifteen I think.
                           [1055] Fifteen, sixteen.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1056] Oh no I saw it when I was about eight.
Carole (PS05B)             [1057] And I saw it before that, about, yeah about
                           eight as well.
                           [1058] But I still enjoyed it the second time.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1059] Well I don't think actually, I mean I can
                           remember [...] and I don't quite understand what's
                           going on here, keeps swapping and changing and I
                           don't understand it.
Carole (PS05B)             [1060] I remember I didn't like the orchestra bit.
                           [1061] [...] weird psychedelic bits.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1062] That's right, yeah.
Carole (PS05B)             [1063] The Nutcracker Suite's my favourite.
                           [1064] Hippos and things doing ballet dances. ...
Adam (PS05D)               [1065] [...] asleep.
Carole (PS05B)             [1066] No, she's not asleep.
Adam (PS05D)               [1067] I thought you said she was asleep.
Carole (PS05B)             [1068] She was.
                           [1069] She's just woken up.
                           [1070] ... Well.
                           [1071] ... What do you want to do?
                           [1072] Shall I put you in your chair?
                           [1073] Shall I?
                           [1074] ... [laugh] Oh you do make funny faces little
                           girl.
*** 8 (Tape 003908) ***
Pauline (PS05F)            [1075] Do you remember [...] provisional driving
                           licence?
                           [1076] Now how long has she left that sitting there?
                           [1077] Ages isn't it I thought I'd tidy up in his
                           desk and I was just going through the mound of
                           papers, and I said here you are here's your licence,
                           finish it off, fill it in, and I'll give you the
                           cheque.
                           [1078] Oh right, I'll ... and then she's moaning at
                           him cos she wants to go and post it and you were
                           mucking about with your C D thing or something and
                           you were saying wait for me I'll do this [...] then
                           [...] I'll miss the post.
                           [1079] It's been sitting there for about three
                           months.
                           [1080] On the desk and she hasn't bothered [...]
                           probably with the cheque.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1081] [...] [baby gurgling] How are you going to
                           afford a driving licence?
                           [1082] ... Totally ignored me.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1083] Oh, of course, ... expecting us to pay.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [...] [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)             [1084] Oh, that's a nice choccy. ...
Pauline (PS05F)            [1085] She sounded really cheesed off about [...] I
                           said how's your revision going, cos I knew she was
                           doing revision, she went cccckkk I try a maths paper
                           and I can't do that, and I [...] a chemistry paper
                           and I can't do that and I really [growl] .
                           [1086] I said I think you need a break.
                           [1087] [laugh] I think you need to go and do
                           something else for a little while ... I said cos if
                           you keep looking over thinking you can't do it, have
                           a break and go back to it afterwards you just get
                           really despondent
Carole (PS05B)             [1088] Yeah.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1089] and fed up and think you can't do it and you
                           go blank and then you can't touch anything you ...
                           and you know it's hard.
Carole (PS05B)             [1090] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1091] Yeah.
                           [1092] You know, you can see it ticking over [...] .
                           [1093] What am I doing.
                           [1094] She was fine tonight, wasn't she?
Carole (PS05B)             [1095] What was she doing?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1096] I dunno, I think she just, probably gone down
                           and played some records or something [...] .
                           [1097] She's got to do some trigs and she just
                           doesn't fancy trying, doesn't understand enough of
                           it to do it.
                           [1098] ... And the science paper she's only got the
                           ... the kind of practice one, it's a very basic one.
                           [1099] She's got no practice ones for the two, the
                           other two she's got to do which are obviously going
                           to be harder and she's got no idea, not, well she's
                           got the guidelines but no real paper to sit and look
                           at.
Carole (PS05B)             [1100] Mm.
Adam (PS05D)               [1101] This is for GCSEs isn't it?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1102] Yeah.
Adam (PS05D)               [1103] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1104] Well you'd think they'd let her, you know
                           have some old paper [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [1105] Does she have [...] or not?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1106] Yes, she erm
Carole (PS05B)             [1107] There aren't any old papers yet though are
                           there?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1108] Well yeah this is done in Croydon last year
                           and the year before so yeah there would be a couple
Carole (PS05B)             [1109] Oh right.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1110] cos this was Croydon ... I'm pretty sure it
                           ... yeah because otherwise she couldn't have the
                           basic from last year would she?
                           [1111] She's got last year's basic.
                           [1112] ... Yes she's done er, both, three?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1113] [...] four
Pauline (PS05F)            [1114] Well on Tuesday she goes in and goes, she's
                           got till Tuesday, one's about six and one's five.
Carole (PS05B)             [1115] Course Danielle's in the middle of it all
                           now, isn't she?
Adam (PS05D)               [1116] We probably know quite a lot of people who
                           are taking exams of one sort or another at the
                           moment.
                           [1117] ... Gabby's going through A levels.
Carole (PS05B)             [1118] Mm.
Adam (PS05D)               [1119] She's decided she's gonna to become a
                           milkwoman. [laugh]
Pauline (PS05F)            [1120] Bit easier, is it?
Adam (PS05D)               [1121] Yes.
Carole (PS05B)             [1122] Doesn't want to be a doctor any more.
Adam (PS05D)               [1123] She's wanted to be a doctor for six years now
                           she's decided
Pauline (PS05F)            [1124] One of Mandy's friends wants to be a doctor.
                           [1125] It's the one who's had cancer and she wants
                           to kind of, go on and study and help the people with
                           cancer.
                           [1126] Cos she doesn't want to be like depressing,
                           she said er no she doesn't feel like that because
                           she's already gone through the worst so she won't,
                           yeah she wants to help people who've got it.
                           [1127] Which I thought was quite nice.
Adam (PS05D)               [1128] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1129] Nice idea.
Adam (PS05D)               [1130] Mind you, that's what motivated my brother in
                           M S
Pauline (PS05F)            [1131] Mm.
Adam (PS05D)               [1132] cos he had a, he had it, had it as a ...
                           kiddy.
                           [1133] Went through so many operations he felt he
                           wanted to give something back to the Health Service.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1134] Well I think that's the kind of idea this
                           girl's got.
                           [1135] Cos, that's right we took, we took them all
                           skating when Mandy was twelve [...] .
                           [1136] Yeah when she was twelve.
                           [1137] And that's when, that week, well she already
                           knew she had something wrong [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [1138] Mm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1139] and about two weeks after that it was
                           diagnosed that she had cancer of the ovary.
                           [1140] ... Yeah.
Adam (PS05D)               [1141] Cos she had all her bits removed, presumably
                           did she?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1142] Yeah I presume so.
                           [1143] She had quite a bit of work done.
                           [1144] She had chemotherapy.
                           [1145] She lost all her hair.
Adam (PS05D)               [1146] Has it all come back?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1147] Oh yeah.
                           [1148] She's all fine now.
Adam (PS05D)               [1149] Is she fully ... full recovered?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1150] Yeah, I think so, yeah.
                           [1151] From what I can gather.
Adam (PS05D)               [1152] Very lucky.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1153] Mm.
                           [1154] Yeah because [...] it was pushing everything.
                           [1155] You know it was taking up so much space.
                           [1156] ... Wouldn't think there was the room in
                           there for, for women.
                           [1157] ... I was really worried at the time cos
                           Mandy, Mandy was very worried, wasn't she?
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1158] Mhm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1159] It really seemed to hit her hard.
                           [1160] ... Actually her friends have gone through a
                           lot.
                           [1161] I mean what with that girl and cancer, and
                           then another good friend, her father died.
                           [1162] Then, it's quite a lot to happen, isn't it?
                           [1163] Really makes her think.
                           [1164] Or worry. [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [1165] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1166] Whose father died then?
Pauline (PS05F)            [1167] Celestian's
Unknown speaker (KBHPSUNK) [1168] Oh Christ.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1169] He had, er, sickle cell, didn't he?
                           [1170] Oh that funny version of sickle cell, wasn't
                           very nice.
Carole (PS05B)             [1171] Didn't know there was two versions of [...] .
Adam (PS05D)               [1172] How's that, er, Phil getting on with bringing
                           up her, her baby?
Carole (PS05B)             [1173] We haven't heard anything for [...]
Pauline (PS05F)            [1174] I think she's alright yes.
                           [1175] I don't think she does anything, well I don't
                           really see her very much.
                           [1176] Well her best friend's [...]
Adam (PS05D)               [1177] Well it must be, nearly two by now.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1178] Yeah, she's walking and, she's slow at
                           walking though.
                           [1179] Yeah, she looks alright.
                           [1180] [...] says she's not very well, she's got a
                           thyroid infection, infection in her throat ... it's
                           affecting her stomach.
                           [1181] They took her down the hospital.
                           [1182] And, they diagnosed that, and said try and
                           keep, you know, give her fluids, but it's going
                           straight through.
                           [1183] And they've given her something low in
                           glucose and that you know to ... kind of try and
                           stabilize it a bit.
Adam (PS05D)               [1184] Mhm.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1185] But she's not too good by the sounds of it.
                           [1186] ... Mind you I saw her two day's ago and she
                           looked absolutely fit as a fiddle [laugh] so I said
                           I think it strikes quickly and
Adam (PS05D)               [1187] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)             [1188] You know she looks a lot more comfortable in
                           there than Charlotte did.
                           [1189] Charlotte always looked sort of
Adam (PS05D)               [1190] Scrunched up.
Pauline (PS05F)            [1191] She seems to like it [...]
Carole (PS05B)             [1192] It's the longest she's stayed in it.
                           [1193] I wonder what's [...] . ...

Pat (PS05J)       [1358] No they're done yet love.
Carole (PS05B)    [1359] Okay.
Pat (PS05J)       [1360] The tatties.

Ron (PS05H)       [1369] and as we're right up towards the end and now after
                  the bank holiday we've had lovely fine weather anyway, we got
                  off to the main road and turned ... at Fibwell traffic lights
                  onto the A twenty one and we got the to end of the dual
                  carriageway onto the tail end of the queue as it started into
                  the road works ... so I just went over the central
                  reservation and went back down the dual carriageway to the
                  traffic lights at
Ron (PS05H)       [1370] Fibwell and turned right went through Tyse
Ron (PS05H)       [1371] Tysehurst to Wothurst round the north side of
Ron (PS05H)       [1372] Bule reservoir to come out at Lamberhurst in the
                  village ... so I sort of circled it
Carole (PS05B)    [1373] Oh right.

Carole (PS05B)    [1375] Oh well ... you got here
Ron (PS05H)       [1376] but in the middle of all that of course there were
                  numerous little bits of temporary traffic lights at roadworks
                  which
Pat (PS05J)       [...]

                  that?
Carole (PS05B)    [2101] because of the price of the frame is quite expensive
                  in itself.
Pat (PS05J)       [2102] Yeah.
Charlotte (PS05E) [...]
Carole (PS05B)    [2103] But if that ... I mean it doesn't worry me if I don't
                  sell that cos it's quite pretty in poppy.
Charlotte (PS05E) [2104] Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

Carole (PS05B)    [2124] Twenty five per cent?
Pat (PS05J)       [2125] Or is it ten per cent?
Carole (PS05B)    [2126] That's a big commission? [laugh]
Pat (PS05J)       [2127] Erm ... I'm not sure now.
Carole (PS05B)    [2128] I'm going to have to up the price considerably then.
Pat (PS05J)       [2129] No , it wasn't I don't think it was ... can't be [...]
                  can't be twenty five per cent
Carole (PS05B)    [2130] Thank you darling.
Pat (PS05J)       [2131] it's more likely to be ten ... ten per cent.
Carole (PS05B)    [2132] Ten or fifteen.
Pat (PS05J)       [2133] Yeah, something like that.
Charlotte (PS05E) [2134] No more.

                  ... that price I mean they're [...]

Pat (PS05J)       [2146] then little dog may be ... erm won't go perhaps for
                  that much.
Carole (PS05B)    [2147] Well no there's no ... no mount or anything on that
                  one it's just ... as is ... that was a, the cheapest frame I
                  could do cos I didn't like it [laugh] when I finished it and
                  I begrudged the price of the frame.
Pat (PS05J)       [2148] Oh ... I think he's I think he's quite nice.
Carole (PS05B)    [2149] Oh well you can buy him if you want. [laugh]

                  nice I mean
Carole (PS05B)    [2151] He's alright but he's
Pat (PS05J)       [2152] there's no accounting for taste some people you know
                  buy funny things.
Carole (PS05B)    [2153] Yeah, I wouldn't buy it.
Pat (PS05J)       [2154] No.
Carole (PS05B)    [2155] I'll give it height but I wouldn't buy it.
Pat (PS05J)       [2156] So they're the only ones you want to get rid of or are
                  they the only ones you've got?

                  price I would want for the alphabet.
Pat (PS05J)       [2162] What would you want for that?
Carole (PS05B)    [2163] Well I'd want over a hundred for that.
Pat (PS05J)       [2164] Mm.
Charlotte (PS05E) [singing]

Carole (PS05B)  [2726] It's not.
Pat (PS05J)     [2727] but it's not is it ... it's easy [...]

Carole (PS05B)  [2732] I think you were just frightened off weren't you?
                [2733] ... At the thought
Pat (PS05J)     [2734] Well I don't know it ... the way you two do the work it
                looks so fine that I didn't think I could see it properly.
Carole (PS05B)  [2735] Well it is quite fine, I mean it do does make your eyes
                ache if you do it for too long.
Pat (PS05J)     [2736] Yeah, I ca I can't do too much at once no well I mean
                but er
Carole (PS05B)  [2737] Depends on the colours you're having to use really.
Pat (PS05J)     [2738] Well yes we've got light colours so
Carole (PS05B)  [2739] The the worst possible is working with black fabric,
                that's that's wicked that is.
Pat (PS05J)     [2740] Well yes it would be wouldn't it?
                [2741] ... It looks lovely though that one, doesn't it?
Carole (PS05B)  [2742] What th the flowers on the black?
Pat (PS05J)     [2743] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2744] Yes it is nice ... it's okay if you can do it in
                daylight, but artificial light is difficult ... and I used to
                sit in the car when Charlotte was asleep.
Pat (PS05J)     [2745] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2746] She was went to sleep in the car I used to sit in the
                car and do it ... cos the light was good out there.
Pat (PS05J)     [2747] Yeah, it was nice and bright, yeah ... Is that what
                Joanie bought her?
Carole (PS05B)  [2748] This?
                [2749] ... Yes.
Pat (PS05J)     [2750] Yeah ... Isn't it pretty?
Carole (PS05B)  [2751] It is pretty ...
Pat (PS05J)     [2752] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2753] It's just too long ... the trousers are too long, that's
                all.
Pat (PS05J)     [2754] Oh.
Carole (PS05B)  [2755] This is what I like ... this is my favourite at the
                moment and she looks wonderful in it ... the dungarees.
Pat (PS05J)     [2756] Oh yes she yes she had those on when you came [...]
                didn't she?
Carole (PS05B)  [2757] Did she, I don't remember.
Pat (PS05J)     [2758] Yeah, baggy ones aren't they?
Carole (PS05B)  [2759] They are baggy, yes.
Pat (PS05J)     [2760] Baggy dungeys.
Carole (PS05B)  [2761] Yeah, they're lovely.
Pat (PS05J)     [2762] Yeah she had those on.

Pat (PS05J)     [2764] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2765] Suits her ... It's the only thing I've bought from M
                &amp; S recently.
Pat (PS05J)     [2766] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2767] Cos, I haven't been impressed.
Pat (PS05J)     [2768] No [laugh] ... Is it time?
Carole (PS05B)  [2769] Mm mm.
Pat (PS05J)     [2770] Oh ... ooh half past three ... What time did she go off,
                half past one?
Carole (PS05B)  [2771] Oh, she'll she'll probably be asleep until five now.
Pat (PS05J)     [2772] Oh.
Carole (PS05B)  [2773] Once she goes, she goes.
Pat (PS05J)     [2774] Oh ... well cos she should really ... she should go four
                hours shouldn't she, she's got good jollop ... well she
Carole (PS05B)  [2775] Yes.
Pat (PS05J)     [2776] seemed to have [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)  [2777] Well yes, but I mean it's ... she seems to do the
                opposite thing to Charlotte, cos she used to sleep in the
                morning and fidget around in the afternoons ... and this one
                fidgets all morning and then sleeps in the afternoon.
Pat (PS05J)     [2778] Yes, well
Carole (PS05B)  [2779] Which is which is quite handy I suppose.
Pat (PS05J)     [2780] And then is she awake in the evening?
Carole (PS05B)  [2781] Yeah.
Pat (PS05J)     [2782] Yeah ... well that's not so bad as long as you can get
                her down at a reasonable hour and get to sleep.
Carole (PS05B)  [2783] Yeah ... well she ... she sleeps she goes down some time
                between eight thirty and eleven.
Pat (PS05J)     [2784] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2785] But sh I think what she does she confuses her early and
                late evening ... feeds
Pat (PS05J)     [2786] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2787] so they merge as as sort of one solid feed [laugh]
Pat (PS05J)     [2788] [laugh] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2789] all da evening ... but then like last night see if I
                know that she's been chomping on and off all night she'll go
                for four or five hours.
Pat (PS05J)     [2790] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2791] Or five or six hours
Pat (PS05J)     [2792] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2793] at night.
Pat (PS05J)     [2794] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2795] So ... and there you are.
Pat (PS05J)     [2796] Mm ... Makes you uncomfortable though, presumably does
                it or?
Carole (PS05B)  [2797] Ah no, it's a it just lets down every now and again
Pat (PS05J)     [2798] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2799] and it's sort of well it's not well they do get full
                that's if she suddenly does longer than
Pat (PS05J)     [2800] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2801] she's been doing.
Pat (PS05J)     [2802] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2803] [sniff] ... Then it's overflowing.
Pat (PS05J)     [2804] Oh is that why you got that out again. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)  [2805] That's right.
Pat (PS05J)     [2806] You got your pump out again.
Carole (PS05B)  [2807] Yes ... yeah ... well I've got two ounces in the
                freezer.
Pat (PS05J)     [2808] Oh have you, oh well it's something I suppose. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)  [2809] Yes, well if I can do a few two ounces worth I put them
                all together and then Adam can give her a little bit.
Pat (PS05J)     [2810] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2811] So I can make the dinner or do something useful. [laugh]

Pat (PS05J)     [2812] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2813] Cos I don't tend to get the opportunity.
Pat (PS05J)     [2814] No.
Carole (PS05B)  [2815] Cos she starts fidgeting ... go and hang this lot up I
                suppose ... Want to come upstairs?
Pat (PS05J)     [2816] Yes, I'll come upstairs ... [...] That's a nice bread
                then isn't it?
Carole (PS05B)  [2817] It is a bit big that's the only problem but the amount
                of bread we get through I need a big one.
Pat (PS05J)     [2818] Yes, you couldn't put it all in the at once could you
                [...]
Carole (PS05B)  [2819] Well ... no no plus the fact that the lid got broken so
                that
Pat (PS05J)     [2820] Oh ... that's a shame.
Carole (PS05B)  [2821] Yes dropped by a certain clumsy person around this house
                ... unfortunately we've had a lot of breakages.
Pat (PS05J)     [2822] Oh dear.
Carole (PS05B)  [2823] Yeah ... never mind ... So Adam said buy something that
                doesn't break.
Pat (PS05J)     [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)  [2824] We've lost loads of glasses.
Pat (PS05J)     [2825] Oh dear.
Carole (PS05B)  [2826] And the lid of the bread bin.
Pat (PS05J)     [2827] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2828] So ... and she ca I don't know whether you noticed or
                she can't make a cup of coffee without spilling it.
Pat (PS05J)     [2829] Yeah, she she spilt it when she put yours down.
Carole (PS05B)  [2830] Yeah.
Pat (PS05J)     [2831] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2832] She just can't ... she's incapable of doing that without
                spilling it. [laugh]
Pat (PS05J)     [2833] She's a bit of a Jamie isn't she?
Carole (PS05B)  [2834] She's a clumsy clogs that's why I won't let her walk
                around with the baby ... if she wants to cuddle her I tell her
                to sit down and I tell her not to move ... well she's always
                tripping over her feet.
Pat (PS05J)     [2835] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)  [2836] I'd rather not take the risk.
Pat (PS05J)     [2837] No ... that's right.
Carole (PS05B)  [2838] Don't want her to go flying do I?
Pat (PS05J)     [2839] No.
Carole (PS05B)  [2840] Charlotte's been playing hangers.
Pat (PS05J)     [2841] Yeah ... there's one with things on [laugh] ... Look at
                these hangers you've got.

                ... wo won't be long ... and the clothes she's wearing now are
                nought to three months.
Pat (PS05J)     [2847] Mm.

Pat (PS05J)     [2849] A bit small yeah.
Carole (PS05B)  [2850] Well I could undo the feet and put socks on her.
Pat (PS05J)     [2851] No ... you don't want to do that do you really?
                [2852] ... Or you can save some of these for Suzie. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)  [2853] It would save me a few pennies.
Pat (PS05J)     [2854] Mm ... yes it would save you a few pennies wouldn't it,
                yes?
Carole (PS05B)  [2855] Well we'll see how we go.

Carole (PS05B)  [2857] Yeah, we've got plenty really.
                [2858] ... She won't go unclothed that's for sure.

Carole (PS05B)    [3408] Well she we ... to start with she went I think it
                  might of been that cos we put Guy in it I think, that might
                  have upset her.
Pat (PS05J)       [3409] Oh.
Carole (PS05B)    [3410] Because when she first had it, she loved it.
Pat (PS05J)       [3411] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [3412] And we pushed her all round the pool ... but then we
                  bought her a ring, just a ring ... nice little one an ...
                  she's fine in that.
Pat (PS05J)       [3413] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [3414] But she took a dislike to it for some reason, she
                  wouldn't go in it.
Pat (PS05J)       [3415] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [3416] But then that holiday was a bit unusual because she
                  wasn't well all the time we were there really ... not
                  properly ... she had that virus that was ... mm

                  do it ... it's one of these silly valves that you have to
                  pinch to

Joelle (PS05C) [cough]
Carole (PS05B) [4002] Tis a funny girl.
Adam (PS05D)   [4003] Everything is it unless it's a person.
Carole (PS05B) [4004] And that's he or she.
Adam (PS05D)   [4005] Right?
Carole (PS05B) [4006] He for a boy and she for a girl ... and it for anything.
Joelle (PS05C) [4007] But I don't know ... I think
Adam (PS05D)   [4008] But you don't know where it is, you don't know where it
               is there's nothing you can do about it.
Carole (PS05B) [4009] Well look, you've lost the needle?
Toby (PS05K)   [4010] Yeah, be careful what you say.
Joelle (PS05C) [4011] Yes.
Carole (PS05B) [4012] When were you last using it ... for knitting or for your
               tapestry?
               [4013] ... It's probably ... it's probably stuck [tv in
               background]
Adam (PS05D)   [4014] Toby can you turn it off please?
Carole (PS05B) [4015] in a piece of er ... knitting.
Adam (PS05D)   [4016] Can you turn it off ... please ... Is this your question?
               [4017] ... Come here ... let's have a look.
Carole (PS05B) [4018] Do we need to have the sound on this?
Adam (PS05D)   [4019] Er ... it's complicated no [...] .
Joelle (PS05C) [4020] What do you want to know?
Carole (PS05B) [4021] Oh mince, I've got to get it out of the freezer ... Bye.
Joelle (PS05C) [4022] Can I listen?
Adam (PS05D)   [4023] Is this disturbing you?
               [4024] ... To the radio, of course, quiet.
*** 24 (Tape 004107) ***
Carole (PS05B) [4025] Is there a lot of difference between ... fishing a in the
               evening?
Adam (PS05D)   [4026] I don't know, I've not fished there in the evening, yet.
Carole (PS05B) [4027] That's true.
Adam (PS05D)   [4028] This'll be my first ... attempt ... I would imagine ...
               that it won't make a lot of difference ... I could be wrong.
Carole (PS05B) [4029] Have you now learnt how to do this tying or do you have
               to go and see Terry every time? [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)   [4030] [laugh] Erm ... I think I've learnt how to do it, it's
               ... fairly straightforward ... but er ... him having tied the
               leader on for me ... I won't have to ... go back to him anyway
               for quite some time.
Carole (PS05B) [4031] So you weren't concentrating when you were watching with
               him?
Adam (PS05D)   [4032] I don't think so,th the point is I'm not going to be
               called to tie a knot like this again ... for maybe three weeks
               and then by then I'll make things up ... it was really more for
               convenience than sitting down trying to work it out myself ...
               so you know [...] .
Carole (PS05B) [4033] Is there not a book of ... angling knots?
Toby (PS05K)   [4034] It means there must places doesn't it?
Adam (PS05D)   [4035] No he's just practising at the moment lovey ... he's
               practising his swing ... but I agree if he stood that distance
               he wouldn't be able to hit the ball would he would you. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [4036] It wouldn't reach it would it? [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)   [4037] He's right in the middle of the fairway though, it's a
               nice looking shot he's got to play isn't it?
Toby (PS05K)   [4038] Mm.
Adam (PS05D)   [4039] Oh this one isn't so nice ... with all this sand.
Carole (PS05B) [4040] Oh look at all that sand.

               his swing ... what's the matter with him now ... come on get on
               with it.
Toby (PS05K)   [4046] Come on get on with it, ooh.

               it.
Carole (PS05B) [4063] Ooh.

               the car when she wakes up ... cos that's too boring.

Carole (PS05B) [4952] Say what you like [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [4953] Oh thank you.
Carole (PS05B) [4954] Ah.
Carole (PS05B) [...]
Carole (PS05B) [4955] We have an addition.
Carole (PS05B) [4956] Mm. [...]
Carole (PS05B) [4957] Not really no.
Carole (PS05B) [4958] No.
Carole (PS05B) [4959] Might as well have some light on the matter.
               [4960] What, oh, perhaps cos I never [...] [laugh] We might just
               about be able to see.
Carole (PS05B) [4961] You haven't got [...] have you?
Carole (PS05B) [4962] [laugh] , I didn't know that one had gone, usually it's
               the bulb over there that had gone, but I find it so difficult to
               get at, you change it.
               [4963] I didn't know this.
Carole (PS05B) [4964] It seems to be gone for a long time.
Carole (PS05B) [4965] I don't know about this one, [...] .
Carole (PS05B) [4966] Oh, well, will, will shall, [...] know it all without
               music now don't you?
Carole (PS05B) [4967] Well of course.
Carole (PS05B) [4968] [laugh] Mm, shall we start with, with a Tchaikovsky, see
               how that is going?
Carole (PS05B) [4969] Mhm.
Carole (PS05B) [4970] It's coming on very well, isn't it?
Carole (PS05B) [4971] I'm afraid this last week hasn't been wonderful for, for
               practice.
Carole (PS05B) [...]
Carole (PS05B) [4972] For practice.
Carole (PS05B) [4973] I understand absolutely, I, I could say exactly the same
               so, don't [...] .
*** 32 (Tape 004205) ***
Carole (PS05B) [4974] Lovely, very, very, good indeed, that, that is there now,
               sounds very good, just, erm, a few little things, would you try
               to give me more on the fifth finger, the E, the E flat, there,
               think of a crescendo [piano music] , to that, want that come
               out, then, then it will, erm, I'm almost frightened to put a
               crescendo in because it wasn't the, a big one.
Carole (PS05B) [4975] No.
Carole (PS05B) [4976] If I put that in, to remind you to bring that up.
Carole (PS05B) [4977] Aha.
Carole (PS05B) [4978] I thought this was most impressive, very, very good
               indeed, it ... it was, it sounded really very convincing, it
               did, worked beautifully, now, where, the only error as such, is
               this bar, you're making these much too long, you're making them
               almost crotchet length.
Carole (PS05B) [4979] Mm.
Carole (PS05B) [4980] But, so erm, just think there for a moment, one, two,
               one, two, and one, and two, and, you're going one and two and
               one and
Carole (PS05B) [4981] And
Carole (PS05B) [4982] So you're halving the tempo, but, it needs a slight roe
               that means just lead into it, so, [piano music] , two and one,
               can do that, but you're doing [piano playing] , [laugh] , and
               it's instable for ever.
Carole (PS05B) [4983] [laugh] Right.
Carole (PS05B) [4984] And then, you know, it, it, makes that sound strange, so
               just watch that, that, erm, what if we just pick it up around
               here, just for me to hear that and get that right, we ought to
               be fine, any [...] .
Carole (PS05B) [cough] [piano music]
Carole (PS05B) [4985] And one and two, that's it, got it, erm, the, better we
               just do to check that it's correct and [...] to remind you for
               rhythm, is listen to those, because those are exactly the same
               as those.
Carole (PS05B) [4986] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B) [4987] Just once again this time [...] .
Carole (PS05B) [piano music]
Carole (PS05B) [4988] Two and one and two and one and, now there you just make
               the crotchet a bit too short, erm, try until you get it into
               your system, which you will, just counting that, in, inside
               yourself.
Carole (PS05B) [4989] Mhm.
Carole (PS05B) [4990] And you'll find then that, that, that will fit, can you
               just adjust your [...] ?
Carole (PS05B) [4991] This?
Carole (PS05B) [4992] Yes.
Carole (PS05B) [4993] Work out what fingers should be.
Carole (PS05B) [4994] [piano music] F sharp.
Carole (PS05B) [playing piano]
Carole (PS05B) [4995] And one, two and [...] and, you've got it, yeah, yeah, do
               it once again, and try, the other thing, is try not to hold down
               [pressed key on piano] that D, as you play the C, it's not
               important, but, it's better if you don't.
*** 33 (Tape 004206) ***
Carole (PS05B) [4996] Oh goodness me, can I go home? [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [4997] I want [...] to have a look at, at this first, or the,
               the other piece or would you like to
Carole (PS05B) [4998] Yeah, maybe.
Carole (PS05B) [4999] Yes, there, there hasn't been
Carole (PS05B) [5000] This, this happens from time to time doesn't it?
Carole (PS05B) [5001] Oh I know, erm, with all of us, I understand completely,
               whilst that you feel a beat in it, erm, no where your left hand
               has to play, left hand seemed to be er leading a mind of it's
               own, yes.
Carole (PS05B) [5002] All over the place. [...]
Carole (PS05B) [5003] Do it once again.
Carole (PS05B) [5004] Yes.
Carole (PS05B) [5005] [...] , do it a bit slower, one, two, three, feel it,
               [...] steady.
*** 34 (Tape 004207) ***
Carole (PS05B) [5006] Yes, that, that was almost that you have a complex about
               it.
Carole (PS05B) [5007] Still not right.
               [5008] Well I didn't have, [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [5009] [...] , but you do now.
Carole (PS05B) [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [5010] Erm, it's, it's fine, it's, they were little slips, are
               you practising your left hand on it's own?
Carole (PS05B) [5011] Eh, I haven't been this week.
Carole (PS05B) [5012] I would.
Carole (PS05B) [5013] I've just been doing it together.
Carole (PS05B) [5014] I think just a few times
Carole (PS05B) [5015] Mhm.
Carole (PS05B) [5016] would ... would help it, it's it's not quite secure
               enough, because it might have been before I arrived, but all the
               weaknesses show up
Carole (PS05B) [5017] Yes I know.
Carole (PS05B) [5018] you know, so erm, I, I think a little left hand practice
               would solve it, I noticed that you put a five on that, I think
               it's better if you put a four.
Carole (PS05B) [...]
Carole (PS05B) [5019] Yes.
Carole (PS05B) [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [5020] Whether you will or not is another matter, that, try it
               again, and no faster than that, very, very sturdy, very sturdy.
*** 35 (Tape 004208) ***
Carole (PS05B) [5021] It needs [...] practice.
Carole (PS05B) [5022] Yes.
Carole (PS05B) [5023] Well, because it's, it's rather a case of the blind
               leading the ... the blind, erm
Carole (PS05B) [5024] I think they're both [...] separately, but they
Carole (PS05B) [5025] Yes, now you, you played stuff just as difficult as this,
               and [...] there's no, no problem, don't do it too quickly
               though, and, I don't mind if it's not finished next week, or the
               week after, it's the quality we want, so, so, don't, don't rush
               it.
               [5026] Just, if I were you I'd just do a little on it, every
               time you practised, and then put it away.
Carole (PS05B) [5027] Mhm.
Carole (PS05B) [5028] But, what, insist on, on left hand especially the little
               finger being really firm, so I shall leave you with that, that
               piece
Carole (PS05B) [...]
Carole (PS05B) [5029] and wait excitedly, you know next week.
Carole (PS05B) [5030] Mm.
Carole (PS05B) [5031] How one pages the other six.
Carole (PS05B) [5032] That's it.
Carole (PS05B) [5033] Right.
Carole (PS05B) [cough]
Carole (PS05B) [5034] Done it separately.
Carole (PS05B) [5035] Oh yes, [laugh] , then [...] except miracles.
Carole (PS05B) [5036] No I, no, I mean you really respond very well, that
               Tchaikovsky was lovely, I understand at the present you can't do
               as much and admirable as you're still doing.
Carole (PS05B) [5037] Well I have to have something to do by myself.
Carole (PS05B) [5038] Yes, well yes surely make that or otherwise you, if you
               give up everything.
Carole (PS05B) [5039] Yeah, even if it's only ten minutes a day, at least it's
               something.
Carole (PS05B) [5040] Oh yes, yes, I think we all need, even, even if, plain,
               life is full of playing games and the game can help you get
               through the day sometimes.
Carole (PS05B) [5041] That's right.
Carole (PS05B) [5042] So, right let's hear the right hand.
Carole (PS05B) [piano music]
Carole (PS05B) [5043] Yeah, just erm, that was fine, fingering here, erm, why
               do you put a, put a four on that, I, I would of thought that,
               that is more sensible, you put [...] into the next note down,
               let's try that, er mm
Carole (PS05B) [laugh]
*** 36 (Tape 004209) ***
Carole (PS05B) [5044] Now do you know where two is in your mind?
Carole (PS05B) [5045] Mm.
Carole (PS05B) [5046] [...] , sorry the and, do you know where it comes in the
               troll?
Carole (PS05B) [5047] In the middle.
Carole (PS05B) [5048] Yes, on that F sharp, right.
Carole (PS05B) [piano music]
Carole (PS05B) [5049] Mm, one and two and, lovely, that's it, got it?
Carole (PS05B) [5050] Mhm.
Carole (PS05B) [5051] Though watch the beat there, then we'll be fine, good,
               let's go on.
Carole (PS05B) [5052] [piano music] .
Carole (PS05B) [5053] Yeah, now, are you going to put an F ... you put a four
               on that, so if you're doing it there, do a four also.
Carole (PS05B) [5054] What on the A you mean?
Carole (PS05B) [5055] [...] , yes on the A.
Carole (PS05B) [5056] Oh right.
Carole (PS05B) [5057] [...] the same.
Carole (PS05B) [5058] What was I doing?
Carole (PS05B) [5059] Put a five.
Carole (PS05B) [5060] Oh right.
Carole (PS05B) [5061] [...] making life difficult.
Carole (PS05B) [5062] Difficult.
Carole (PS05B) [5063] [laugh] , just try it.
Carole (PS05B) [piano music] [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [5064] Then a four.
Carole (PS05B) [piano music]
Carole (PS05B) [5065] Good.
               [5066] Yes, now I wouldn't slur those quite so much as I would
               make that all legato.
               [5067] You try putting a thumb on the A, no do, do this slowly,
               making the whole thing legato.
Carole (PS05B) [piano music]
Carole (PS05B) [5068] The thumb da, da, yes, but, if you're in [piano music]
               it's a cord of G, you'll put a two on the B, final note, and
               then go up to a five on a G, not a one, it's better [...] to do
               that, see if you can try.
Carole (PS05B) [playing piano]
Carole (PS05B) [5069] That's it, do you find that difficult?
Carole (PS05B) [5070] No, just awkward.
Carole (PS05B) [5071] If, if, if you can't [piano music] , if you prefer to put
               a one there cross it out with a vengeance.
Carole (PS05B) [5072] [...] Well I [...] .
Carole (PS05B) [5073] Take a rubber to it. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [5074] [laugh] I try to [...] .
Carole (PS05B) [5075] And, it's, it's better roll than keep on using the thumb
               to get you out of the keyboard [piano music] but, if, I don't
               want it to spoil
Carole (PS05B) [5076] Well I see, if it, if it.
Carole (PS05B) [5077] See how it goes, but that's, that's good, now let me just
               [...] .
Carole (PS05B) [piano music]
Carole (PS05B) [5078] Good, very good [...] .
*** 37 (Tape 004210) ***
Carole (PS05B) [5079] Yes, very good, and you're sure you haven't put a three
               on that aren't you?
Carole (PS05B) [5080] Of course.
Carole (PS05B) [5081] Good nothing wrong with that, nothing wrong at all, now I
               think rather than set you something new, it's better to, try to
               get another bar.
Carole (PS05B) [5082] Think so.
Carole (PS05B) [5083] So, concentrate on this and I'm, I'm, must get round to
               [...] , I'm sorry my life has been in turmoil because of the,
               the dog situation, Jean and I haven't been up to the West End,
               but erm, I, I know which book I want, I want to get you, erm,
               and yes, I want you to do this, so [...] and this actually it's
               very good, very difficult, good, do a bit of technic.
Carole (PS05B) [5084] Mm, shall we?
Carole (PS05B) [5085] Why not?
Carole (PS05B) [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [5086] Have you, have you been spending hours on the technic?
Carole (PS05B) [5087] Oh absolutely. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [5088] The [laugh]
Carole (PS05B) [...]
Carole (PS05B) [5089] Would you prefer not to?

Adam (PS05D)      [5963] [...] , in the picture it's really [...] , it looks
                  more like a jacket rather than a blouse.
Carole (PS05B)    [5964] Oh right.
Adam (PS05D)      [5965] But, erm, I mean all the fabric we went to get, they
                  just cotton and erm

                  just printed cotton, [...] .
Carole (PS05B)    [5972] Oh.
Adam (PS05D)      [5973] But I mean the style of it is obviously jacketed
                  person, blousey, cos it's [...] collar and she's got three
                  buttons at the front and it's fitted as a jacket as opposed
                  to a tuck in a blouse.
Carole (PS05B)    [5974] Oh right.
Adam (PS05D)      [5975] And it's got three quarter length sleeves.

Adam (PS05D)      [5980] As a jacket, yes , that's right, I think it'll look
                  quite smart, you know, with, perhaps a straight skirt.
Carole (PS05B)    [5981] With a plain, that goes in one of the colours.
Adam (PS05D)      [5982] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [5983] Oh well mum will enjoy herself won't she?
Adam (PS05D)      [5984] She always does.

                  [6029] Well, she ... her, her sleeping habits during the day
                  change to afternoons, and, well today she's been she had
                  about two hours this afternoon, so if we did our normal and
                  gave her tea at five o'clock, and send them up for a bath at
                  half past six, there's no way she'd be asleep.
Adam (PS05D)      [6030] No.
Carole (PS05B)    [6031] So we sort of switched all around now, so she eats
                  with us at half past six stroke seven, goes up for a bath at
                  seven thirty, [...] eight o'clock and she's in bed by nine,
                  then she, she's usually asleep by half past ten, but eh, it
                  seems to have cured the problem we had with her [cough] ,
                  wanting, wanting me all the time, after she's gone to bed.
Adam (PS05D)      [6032] Yeah.

                  she goes longer, but she's feeding all day today, [...] , I'm
                  at [...] every couple of hours, so with a bit of luck, I'll
                  finally put her to bed maybe half past nine ten o'clock, she
                  might go through till three or four, which isn't bad.
Adam (PS05D)      [6035] No.
Carole (PS05B)    [6036] It's usually half past nine till, I wasn't so good
                  last night, she went until two, but then she didn't wake up
                  again until seven.
                  [6037] Manages to do long stretches at night, which is nice.
Adam (PS05D)      [6038] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)    [6039] And then she went to sleep again until ten, on our
                  bed. [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)      [6040] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [6041] She's [...] reluctant to go back in her own bed, so I
                  just point her over me shoulder and lay and said get on with
                  it ... [...] an insult.

                  with it all written on, I'll show you, they're doing a piece
                  of research with a company that does dictionaries and a
                  university, to put together a load of modern usage.
Adam (PS05D)      [6116] Oh right.
Carole (PS05B)    [6117] Like, has a, like [...] the girl that came talked
                  about it, like for example, people are using wicked, good.
Adam (PS05D)      [6118] Oh yeah.
Carole (PS05B)    [6119] So there's, obviously lots of other pieces, English at

                  all the [...] .
Adam (PS05D)      [6124] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)    [6125] Brilliant little machine actually, well it's only a
                  Walkman, but the microphone is incredibly
Adam (PS05D)      [6126] Yeah is that the microphone there?
Carole (PS05B)    [6127] Yeah.
                  [6128] Clever.
Adam (PS05D)      [6129] It's a small enough tape innit?
Carole (PS05B)    [6130] It is really [laugh] .
                  [6131] Let's go and do a bit of spying. [laugh]

Carole (PS05B)    [6134] Oh yes, [laugh] , you could just quite, quite a lot in
                  it, quite vocal she is.
Adam (PS05D)      [6135] Who have you had taped?
Carole (PS05B)    [6136] Mm, mum and dad, Brian and Lynn, erm, no, no not Brian
                  and Lynn, Brian, Brian and Pauline, Bett [...] , my piano
                  lesson's on there [laugh] yesterday.
Adam (PS05D)      [6137] That'll be interesting. [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)    [6138] Mm, [...] , piano playing's not so beautiful, but, is
                  when he plays.
Adam (PS05D)      [6139] Does he play when he comes here?
Carole (PS05B)    [6140] If he's showing me something, or is, before, I start a
                  new piece, he'll always play it.
Adam (PS05D)      [6141] And yours sounds nothing like it?
Carole (PS05B)    [6142] No, well certainly not the first time I play, it, I
                  approach it when he thinks I've finished, but it's nowhere
                  near, I mean
Adam (PS05D)      [6143] Provisional, expect to sound as good
Carole (PS05B)    [6144] Mm.
Adam (PS05D)      [6145] so
Carole (PS05B)    [6146] [...] concerts and things, but you can, you can tell,
                  with just, just by listening that it's not just any old body
                  tinkling on the piano, it's wonderful, it makes you sick.
                  [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)      [6147] Is Charlotte going to learn to play it?
Carole (PS05B)    [6148] Well I hope she'll be interested enough to, but, not
                  really before she's six, cos I asked him last couple of times
                  ago, he said, what sort of age, cos obviously the size of the
                  hands comes into it, they can't do too much, but he said he
                  wouldn't consider before six and you ought'a have to take the
                  parents into consideration, of a child that age you gotta
                  have a parent who's prepared to sit there and make sure the
                  child does what he's set them to do, because [...] , oh Amy,
                  you not getting any [...] out of that.
                  [6149] [knocking] Have you finished it?
                  [6150] Ha, you big lump.
                  [6151] [knocking] [baby noise] No wonder she puts on half a
                  pound a week.
                  [6152] Mind you erm, I mean that's not, it's normal, I expect
                  you to put between six, six ounces and eight ounces [...] .
                  [6153] Oh dear, oh dear, it's a hard life isn't it?
Adam (PS05D)      [6154] [...] taken it off.
Carole (PS05B)    [6155] How you doing?
Adam (PS05D)      [6156] Eh, oh, O K, I'll find out tonight.
Carole (PS05B)    [6157] Oh of course, Wednesday.
Adam (PS05D)      [6158] The way in to work, cycled there last week.
Carole (PS05B)    [6159] Oh my.
Adam (PS05D)      [6160] I had to, Richard had taken the car [...] , he takes
                  it in the morning, but
Carole (PS05B)    [6161] Oh my goodness, [...] .
Adam (PS05D)      [6162] Well he ... he takes the car to school, but, and it,
                  sorry takes the car to work and before he's bringing the car
                  home and then he's been going to school on his bike.
Carole (PS05B)    [6163] Oh right.
Adam (PS05D)      [6164] So of course the bike, the car's for me to use in the
                  evening, but last
Carole (PS05B)    [6165] You cycle home from here and then [...] ?
Adam (PS05D)      [6166] [...] from you, then you get changed and then go, but,
                  last week he took the car, cos when I got home, first I was
                  late last Wednesday, well I say late, I didn't get back here,
                  erm, until seven, so by the time I got home it was quarter
                  past seven and I have to make sure I get to Weightwatchers
                  between seven and eight.
Carole (PS05B)    [6167] Oh, for the weigh in?
Adam (PS05D)      [6168] Mm, so I had to go, quickly get changed, and cos it,
                  it, I normally I just wear a pair, a pair of sandals and
                  light weight clothing, but
Carole (PS05B)    [6169] Oh dear.
Adam (PS05D)      [6170] so, I couldn't go in sandals, well obviously I can't
                  cycle in a pair of sandals on
Carole (PS05B)    [6171] Can't really cycle with a floating skirt on either,
                  can you?
Adam (PS05D)      [6172] The last [...] with me leggings on and this top on.
                  [6173] Well, I looked a bit of a sight, but I thought well,
                  well, you know, what else can I do, I mean I couldn't take
                  clothing to get changed in to.
Carole (PS05B)    [6174] Well, they wouldn't expect you to would they?
Adam (PS05D)      [6175] I've, I'd got a few stares from some of the women
                  there, I mean, there are some women there that are huge, and
                  maybe they looked at me and thought oh I hope I can wear
                  leggings like that one day [laugh] , I mean I don't think I
                  look too bad in the leggings, I mean I would never have done
                  it when I used to go to Weightwatchers when I was thirteen
                  and a half stone, I would never of gone in leggings, no way,
                  but it doesn't
Carole (PS05B)    [6176] Well you don't, you don't really look as if you need
                  to lose weight cos it's probably why you got a few stares,
                  it's like all the diet books that have sylphlike people on
                  the front.
Adam (PS05D)      [6177] Well [...] .
                  [6178] I mean I spoke to Jane the other Sunday and I, I said
                  to her you know, just be honest, I said I don't care what you
                  said, but just be honest and tell me how much you think I
                  weigh, cos she doesn't know how much I weigh and she thought
                  I weighed about ten stone, I said well stick thirteen pounds
                  on top of that [laugh] , then you'll be right, she couldn't
                  believe that I, that I weighed that much, so obviously it
                  doesn't look that bad and people at work, well they've
                  noticed that I've lost weight, but they don't say how much
                  they think I weigh, so I don't want [...] come to them to
                  sort of, have a, have a g ... have a guess of my weight.
Carole (PS05B)    [6179] Guess the weight of a Suzie.
Adam (PS05D)      [6180] Yeah, but they have noticed which is something I
                  suppose.
                  [6181] There's somebody came in today, a guy came in today
                  who used to work with us who usually comes in occasionally
                  and I would see him, but for a few weeks now, so he noticed
                  it.
                  [6182] It's nice that people say it to you unprompted.
                  [laugh]
Carole (PS05B)    [6183] Oh yes, you say I'm on a diet, they say oh well you
                  have lost a lot of weight then. [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)      [6184] Yeah.
Carole (PS05B)    [6185] Adam's mum's like that.
Adam (PS05D)      [6186] Oh is she?
Carole (PS05B)    [6187] She knows you're dieting, every time she sees you, ooh
                  you've lost a lot of weight.
Adam (PS05D)      [6188] Even when you haven't, yeah, but erm, no I mean, there
                  is a guy at work, I mean there is a guy at work that's
                  constantly saying to me, oh it's really noticing, it's really
                  started, he says this every day, and he, after a while, I
                  mean it's nice to be told it, once in a while, but not every
                  day.
Carole (PS05B)    [6189] But not every day, it loses value doesn't it?
Adam (PS05D)      [6190] Oh it does, and he said to me, erm this afternoon, he
                  said eh, oh he said eh, your weight loss is really, really
                  noticing this week, and I thought well, even if I had lost
                  weight this week it's only going to be a couple of pounds,
                  and a couple of pounds would not notice.
Carole (PS05B)    [6191] Plus the different clothes you wear.
Adam (PS05D)      [6192] It doesn't matter who you are, two pounds won't make
                  any difference to your appearance, I mean, yeah I suppose
                  clotheswise
Carole (PS05B)    [6193] Well as you, as you get smaller, two pounds does
                  notice, it's when you're
Adam (PS05D)      [6194] Maybe it does.
Carole (PS05B)    [6195] when you're bigger, and you've got a real lot to lose,
                  and two pounds is nothing.
Adam (PS05D)      [6196] Yeah, two pound is nothing , yes that's true.
Carole (PS05B)    [6197] Two pounds is actually quite a lot.
Adam (PS05D)      [6198] Yes it is.
Carole (PS05B)    [6199] Good evening.
                  [6200] My goodness me how many have you caught?
                  [6201] [laugh] Have you got a whopper in there?
Adam (PS05D)      [6202] Yes.
Adam (PS05D)      [6203] I's gonna say the bags [...] full.
Carole (PS05B)    [6204] Goodness.
                  [6205] So, so your new leader did the trick. [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)      [...]
Carole (PS05B)    [6206] God you need, my god.
Adam (PS05D)      [6207] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [6208] Ah.
Adam (PS05D)      [6209] In the chair Jessie.
Carole (PS05B)    [6210] Good grief, what's it weigh?
Adam (PS05D)      [6211] Three pounds, five and a half.
Carole (PS05B)    [6212] Wow.
                  [6213] Who shall we have over for dinner?
Adam (PS05D)      [6214] Not giving that away.
Adam (PS05D)      [6215] [laugh] That's a lot.
Carole (PS05B)    [6216] [laugh] That's amazing.
Adam (PS05D)      [6217] Alright, yeah.
Carole (PS05B)    [6218] Wow.
Adam (PS05D)      [6219] Well I'll tell you what
Adam (PS05D)      [6220] Excuse my ignorance.
Carole (PS05B)    [6221] It's a fish kettle job isn't it?
Adam (PS05D)      [6222] Excuse my ignorance, but what is it?
Adam (PS05D)      [6223] It's a trout.
Carole (PS05B)    [6224] It's a very unusual colouring.
Adam (PS05D)      [6225] Mm.
                  [6226] No I think it's just the [...] .
Charlotte (PS05E) [6227] Mum.
Carole (PS05B)    [6228] It's spotty it's spotty, ha.
Adam (PS05D)      [6229] No he lost some, lost some of his scales, that's all.
                  [6230] I was a, having a devil of a job bringing him in, cos
                  erm, he was in the top rank and he was, weave, he was weaving
                  in and out [...] .
Carole (PS05B)    [6231] Wow.
                  [6232] Oh well done you've got him.
                  [6233] No good talking to me about top and bottom length ,
                  cos I don't know what you're talking about. [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)      [6234] Mm, the top lake is like very flat water, is a lot of
                  weed and a lot of scum, right?
Carole (PS05B)    [6235] Oh right.
Adam (PS05D)      [6236] So bringing the thing in, hello darling, and erm, he
                  was just literally he was rushing around the weeds trying to
Carole (PS05B)    [6237] Trying to escape.
Adam (PS05D)      [6238] tangle it, just trying to tangle it up, cos the idea
                  being if he gets round a weed, often enough he go [noise]
                  that means, basically it gives him a lever, I mean they're
                  very clever you know, these fish, they're not, they don't
                  just sort of sit there and wait.
Carole (PS05B)    [6239] You mean someone [...] ?
Adam (PS05D)      [6240] They're not like coarse fish, Jo, perch, or roach or
                  whatever in the river, if you catch them, they just sort of,
                  lie down and wait for you.
Carole (PS05B)    [6241] Give up.
Adam (PS05D)      [6242] Yeah, yeah, [...] .
Charlotte (PS05E) [6243] Wow.
Carole (PS05B)    [6244] Oh, well done you did it.
Adam (PS05D)      [6245] Joelle.
Carole (PS05B)    [6246] [laugh] Poor Joelle she's got some work to do.
Charlotte (PS05E) [...]
Carole (PS05B)    [6247] What she, cos her mum's got a fish shop, she knows the
                  way of ... cleaning fish without you cutting them, [...] ,
                  pulling it all out from, through the gills.
Charlotte (PS05E) [6248] Ready, steady

Adam (PS05D)      [6301] Are they downstairs [...] ?
Carole (PS05B)    [6302] They're either in the, in the erm, little cupboard in
                  the downstairs loo or they're in the bathroom.

Adam (PS05D)      [6314] Mm.
Carole (PS05B)    [...]
Adam (PS05D)      [6315] Eh, concentrate, oh yeah leggings, erm so Jenny tried
                  them on, and they looked really nice on her, cos her legs,
                  you see, cos I've got this bit here, little bit there, erm,
                  and being cropped, just made the legs look a bit sort of
                  stumpy.
Carole (PS05B)    [6316] You haven't got stumpy legs.
Adam (PS05D)      [6317] Oh I have, have [...] well I've got high heels on,
                  [laugh] , but it's, it's, because I am
Carole (PS05B)    [6318] Yeah, I know what you mean.
Adam (PS05D)      [6319] Because I'm a bit patterny, flowers, with this little
                  bit here and being cropped there, just made my leg look a
                  bit, and I thought oh dear, and I wasn't convinced, Richard
                  couldn't stand them, he thought I looked absolutely gross in
                  them.
Carole (PS05B)    [...]
Adam (PS05D)      [6320] So I thought, well I said I like them, and he said you
                  can wear them as long as you're not out with me.
                  [6321] So I thought well there's not much point in me having
                  them, cos I would wear them
Carole (PS05B)    [6322] If you find something unacceptable there's not much
                  point.
Adam (PS05D)      [6323] Well I, I'd be wearing them at weekends, so, you know
                  just, just just slouching around in really, well you know,
                  perhaps, cycling yeah.
Carole (PS05B)    [6324] Not in front of the husband.
                  [6325] Cycling.
Adam (PS05D)      [6326] So I thought there's not much point in me keeping
                  them, if he really does, doesn't like them at all, he
Carole (PS05B)    [6327] Well done.
Adam (PS05D)      [6328] So erm
Carole (PS05B)    [6329] So she's got them.
Adam (PS05D)      [6330] [...] come inside, stay with mummy whilst I go and
                  find myself some pills, please don't do that Charlotte.
Carole (PS05B)    [6331] While you go find some what?
Adam (PS05D)      [6332] Oh, pills, think I might have some in the car
                  actually.
Carole (PS05B)    [6333] You got some in your, I was just going to say in your
                  handbag, in your briefcase?
Adam (PS05D)      [6334] Could be.
Adam (PS05D)      [6335] Erm, yes I'm going to try and buy some plain ones, you
                  know her, you know her navy blue ones ...
Carole (PS05B)    [6336] How many more? [laugh]
Adam (PS05D)      [6337] you know her navy blue leggings, but they're thicker
                  than [...] .
Carole (PS05B)    [6338] Yeah, yeah they're nice.
Adam (PS05D)      [6339] I thought I might get myself a pair of those.
Carole (PS05B)    [6340] She got those from M and S, didn't she?
Adam (PS05D)      [6341] Yes.
Carole (PS05B)    [6342] Cos they looked really nice with that jumper she
                  wears.
Adam (PS05D)      [6343] Yes, so I thought, I might erm, cos I bought a jumper,
                  I bought a pale blue jumper to go with the flowery leggings,
                  but, I've decided I'll take blue jumper back, cos, although
                  it would be alright with plain white trousers I thought
                  that's all I would wear it with, I wouldn't wear it with
                  anything else, so, I think I'll change that, if I get the
                  dark blue leggings like Jamie, then I'll get the striped
                  jumper the same.
Carole (PS05B)    [6344] Soon be twins.
Adam (PS05D)      [6345] Soon be twins.

                  eleven months or more.
Adam (PS05D)      [6356] Mm.
                  [6357] Is that all you're allowed?
Carole (PS05B)    [6358] Mm.
                  [6359] Well I mean, I don't know, I didn't ask any doctors,
                  cos, we normally have Nurofen, but I didn't ask any doctors
                  whether they were acceptable in pregnancy or not, I just
                  assumed they weren't, cos nurses said last time, [...] , that

*** 59 (Tape 004502) ***
Pat (PS05J)     [6507] Going back to the subject of their parents thinking
                about it.
                [6508] How did you find you know having someone living in your
                house and things like that?
Carole (PS05B)  [6509] Well I'm not the best in the world at having somebody
                else living in the house.
Pat (PS05J)     [6510] Did you find it difficult or are you finding it
Carole (PS05B)  [6511] It's easier to start with until you sort of get used to
                somebody
Pat (PS05J)     [6512] Till you get to know each other
Carole (PS05B)  [6513] overlap get annoying and things.
                [6514] But it's not as bad really.
Pat (PS05J)     [6515] How old is she?
Carole (PS05B)  [6516] She's only eighteen that's that's ...
Pat (PS05J)     [6517] Do you let her out I mean does she go out in the
                evening?
Carole (PS05B)  [6518] Let her out!
                [6519] Ha ha.
Pat (PS05J)     [6520] [laugh] How do you know like an eighteen year old is
                someone responsible
Carole (PS05B)  [6521] If she wants to go.
                [6522] No
Pat (PS05J)     [6523] Does she go out in the evenings or anything like that?
Carole (PS05B)  [6524] No no she's not that sort.
                [6525] She started she's that, she made friends with one or two
                of her colleagues so she goes to the cinema of an evening [...]

Pat (PS05J)     [6526] Yes yeah and she ... yes
Carole (PS05B)  [6527] It's impossible
Pat (PS05J)     [6528] Yes yes
Carole (PS05B)  [6529] She doesn't do it at home, she can easily go out
Pat (PS05J)     [6530] It must be difficult if you had someone who wanted to go
                out all the time or ... if they're sort of really living it up
                or something I mean
Carole (PS05B)  [6531] They are required [...]
Pat (PS05J)     [6532] but there are sort of rules and regulations
Carole (PS05B)  [6533] [...] they are required to do five hours work for you a
                day
Pat (PS05J)     [6534] Mm
Carole (PS05B)  [6535] Six days a week
Pat (PS05J)     [6536] Right
Carole (PS05B)  [6537] One free day off
Pat (PS05J)     [6538] Mm
Carole (PS05B)  [6539] And a reasonable amount of space
Pat (PS05J)     [6540] Right oh I see yeah
Carole (PS05B)  [6541] So obviously eating's generally theirs.
                [6542] Just sort of you could reasonable expect them to baby
                sit two or three times you know.
Pat (PS05J)     [6543] Yeah.
                [6544] That must be great having a baby sitter on tap
Carole (PS05B)  [6545] Yes it is
Pat (PS05J)     [6546] That must be really nice
Pauline (PS05F) [6547] A car a car
Carole (PS05B)  [6548] Uh uh yeah
Pauline (PS05F) [6549] A car
Carole (PS05B)  [6550] Actually for me it's probably the best thing [laugh]
Pat (PS05J)     [6551] Yes
Carole (PS05B)  [6552] Not having to have meals done if I'm busy
Pat (PS05J)     [6553] No
Carole (PS05B)  [6554] [...] I am.
Pat (PS05J)     [6555] but you don't touch because it's precious.
Carole (PS05B)  [6556] Taken care of
Pat (PS05J)     [6557] [...] Yeah
Carole (PS05B)  [6558] That's why I make sure I've got a couple of hours where
                I'm really with her almost exclusively overlap too easy
                otherwise.
                [6559] You know take her out and things like that.
Pat (PS05J)     [6560] Yes oh yeah overlap must be very convenient though
                specially like with another one then you know these
Carole (PS05B)  [6561] Or in this sort period before things actually settling
                down into a routine
Pat (PS05J)     [6562] Mm
Carole (PS05B)  [6563] Once she's in a routine a bit more then [...] but we are
                still trying to do as many [...]
Pat (PS05J)     [6564] Mm ... Yeah we've been found it really difficult finding
                a baby sitter really I'm surprised ever since we've had Lisa
                we've been really bad uh uh actually having baby sitters and
                you know actually making the effort to go out really.
Carole (PS05B)  [...]
Pat (PS05J)     [6565] We should shouldn't we go out more often really.
                [6566] But we just you know like Saturday night we really enjoy
                making a nice meal and having a nice bottle of wine or
                something and doing something ...
Carole (PS05B)  [6567] The circles in the groups that you've been going to
Carole (PS05B)  [6568] Ahm ... well I have had uh yeah I mean I have had people
                if I'd really wanted to but ... I mean we've had baby sitters
                and things like that.
                [6569] I mean I'd prefer really to find a teenager.
                [6570] An eighteen year old or something like that eighteen
                seventeen eighteen nineteen year old something like that who
                would like you know a fiver or tenner.
Carole (PS05B)  [6571] Have your neighbours got ... ?
Pat (PS05J)     [6572] Where we are now ahm there are all ahm either very young
                or very old.
                [6573] Natalie!
                [6574] They're either very young or very like young families or
                like about in their eighties [laugh] .
Carole (PS05B)  [6575] Oh right.
                [6576] wait isn't it [...]
Pat (PS05J)     [6577] I think ahm there's the N C T would erm at Woodmanston
                they just started about three weeks ago, three or four weeks
                ago.
Carole (PS05B)  [...]
Pat (PS05J)     [6578] So I haven't been to any of those coffee mornings ...
                I've met a few people from it.
                [6579] Ahm so I'm going to see if I could set up a baby sitting
                circle or something like that.
                [6580] So that would be quite useful.
                [6581] Another friend
Carole (PS05B)  [6582] Once you get to know people well it's nice isn't it?
Pat (PS05J)     [6583] Yeah hmm ... What have you got?
Carole (PS05B)  [6584] It all used to be quite lovely before we had [...]
Pat (PS05J)     [6585] Oh that's nice yeah
*** 60 (Tape 004503) ***
Carole (PS05B) [6586] And then they're being sponsored for Romanian Orphans
Pat (PS05J)    [6587] Oh that's
Carole (PS05B) [6588] to raise money to take the equipment out there so that
Pat (PS05J)    [6589] Oh that's good for Romania to decide oh that's good
Carole (PS05B) [6590] So that they can actually get out of their cot and have a
               move for five minutes but ...
Adam (PS05D)   [6591] [...] just gone to Romania ... uhm two weeks ago.
               [6592] She's she's a nurse so she's gone out there to work in an
               orphanage.
               [6593] overlap
Carole (PS05B) [6594] But it's not easy I mean you know I was reading an
               article ages ago a few months ago actually and saying you know
               if you think about it the sort of revolution was over a year ago
               and still the government hasn't done anything about it and I
               mean like a lot of provisions that have been brought into
               Romania sort of go in the front door and out of the back door
               and you know they sort of sent those of supplies like
               contraceptions and things like that for the women and [...]
               overlap
Pat (PS05J)    [6595] and the doctors was selling them to to to rich Romanians
               and things like that so there's such a lot of corruption in the
               country.
               [6596] It's also saying that you know ... the family it's only
               the family unit that helps itself out so if you're an orphan
Carole (PS05B) [6597] You haven't got a chance
Pat (PS05J)    [6598] You haven't got anyone to look after you because they
               just look after their own really.
*** 61 (Tape 004504) ***
Carole (PS05B)    [6599] They're currants

                  ones are sultanas ... the brown ones ... the bigger ones.
Joelle (PS05C)    [6605] Mm

                  of some of this flour [laugh]

                  itself?

                  the same it's the flour specially for the cake.
                  [6620] You know it was something in it.
Carole (PS05B)    [6621] There was something in it?
                  [6622] For raising?
                  [6623] You don't put something else in as well to make it ...

Joelle (PS05C)    [6624] No
Carole (PS05B)    [6625] Okay.
                  [6626] That's all right.
