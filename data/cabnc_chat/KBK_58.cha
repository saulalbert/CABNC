*LYN:	Is  associate . •632845_634955•
*CHR:	Yes, it's the  •638985_640515•
*LYN:	what have they said about the offer they've had already? •640665_647275•
*CHR:	Erm, yes they have,forgive me, I'll just finish this if you don't mind, I'm, I'm almost there, one O ten point three eight. •647275_653635•
        Well erm  he came back on the twenty fourth, no, never mind that  we  we've been to-ing and fro-ing have Asian Associates and I and  •657665_675445•
*LYN:	Is there a deadline on it? •675445_677385•
*CHR:	Not as such so they're pressing for an answer, the factory, but erm, he came back and said we'd need firm prices, per kilo price, lump sum price not acceptable, customer offer of sixteen Deutschmark per kilo from , for twelve to fourteen with delivery, your request for those credit verified five months not acceptable, you offer to deliver in eight weeks in which case and we'd get  till twelve weeks, please confirm. •677385_699115•
        U S factory is booked, bulk order, pushing delivery out to twelve weeks, Deutschmark sixteen kilos unlikely, could only break our offer down to price per piece or packet. •699115_708585•
        Five months were allowed for dispatch of last welding rods and elsie transfers on opening and presentation. •708955_714825•
        I wrote back saying, get on with it, and incidentally we overestimated the shipment cost, brought it down to about half, got to be awfully careful there, because some of these bits are so big, they , and today he said, customer will make decision only after ten days, since final size of assortment is under preparation, meantime with your offered price and revised delivery time, it looks very difficult to book this order. •714825_744255•
        Price of electrodes is, seems alright, however plate prices are very high. •744295_752365•
        Please offer per piece or kilo. •752365_755035•
        Now  have changed it from per kilo to per piece. •755105_759635•
*LYN:	How had you offered ? •759915_760805•
        Would you have the choice? •761335_766875•
*CHR:	I don't, you'd offer per kilo . •766875_768405•
