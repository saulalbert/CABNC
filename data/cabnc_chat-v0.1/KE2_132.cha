*TER:	Yes, erm  on the other hand there are some  •853575_855615•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TER:	there are some very good comprehensive schools! •855615_857335•
*UNK:	Oh yes! •857375_857855•
*TER:	I mean you can't, you can't erm •857855_859615•
*UNK:	Thank you. •859705_860125•
*UNK:	Thank you love. •860125_860455•
*TER:	There's some very bad grammar schools! •861425_862885•
*UNK:	Yeah, I agree with you. •863055_864155•
*TER:	You know, again as you said earlier on it all comes down in the end to the head! •864155_867685•
*UNK:	You see we've had some very good reports , I mean that went through a very bad patch but they've this new Doctor Colin   he's meant to be pretty switched on •867685_875895•
*TER:	Mm. •876175_876505•
*UNK:	and erm they say, you know it's it's  turning into a very good school! •876555_879365•
        So that's one possibility to look at. •879365_882495•
        But  I mean a a grammar doesn't suit every child does it? •882665_884855•
        Some kids  erm er , you know. •884955_886085•
*TER:	No it doesn't, you see. •886085_886985•
        I mean I , I would always say, you know if a child was borderline •887015_889955•
*UNK:	Mm. •891185_891245•
*TER:	If there was a doubt then he would be better not going to a grammar school •891405_894635•
*UNK:	Mm. •894635_894705•
*TER:	because he would be at the top end of the other school  •894905_896785•
*UNK:	That's right! •896785_897095•
        That is exactly that! •897095_898415•
*TER:	and then success breeds success! •898415_899315•
*UNK:	That's right! •899395_899655•
        That's right. •899675_900985•
*TER:	Erm  whereas  •900985_901335•
*UNK:	Right. •901335_901525•
*TER:	er the same child goes to the grammar school, he's in the C stream, he's at bottom  •901525_904305•
*UNK:	Yeah. •904305_904445•
*TER:	at the end and they perhaps don't bother quite so much  and •904445_906715•
*UNK:	Yeah. •906715_906785•
*TER:	he, he drops back, he gets  •906845_908085•
*UNK:	Yeah. •908085_908145•
*TER:	further and further and further behind. •908145_909535•
*UNK:	Yeah. •909535_909615•
        Now I found that, you see, cos I passed my eleven plus and I lived in Hampshire and the grammar school was Hampshire Grammar School for Girls, which was quite a long way away from where I lived and it would have entailed a bus and the train and I  and there was only me that passed and I, I didn't wanna do it. •909965_921845•
        So I went to a very good secondary school but I was in the A one stream  right the way through  and I was always within that top three of that A one stream and it gave me confidence and I really got on. •922465_931255•
        And I never regretted not going. •931255_932825•
*TER:	No. •932945_933005•
        That's right. •933005_933365•
*UNK:	You know a lot of people said to me oh how stupid! •933365_935335•
        To my mum, you know  she's passed, you're daft, but  there'd have been so much hassle for me to get there! •935445_939935•
*TER:	Yeah. •940045_940195•
*UNK:	And I didn't feel confident, and I wasn't happy within  •940195_942625•
*TER:	Yeah. •942625_942715•
*UNK:	myself and my mum said if you're not, then you don't  •942715_944415•
*TER:	That's right! •944475_944795•
*UNK:	wanna go. •944795_945155•
*TER:	That's right! •945155_945725•
*UNK:	And that's how I felt about  •946155_947145•
*TER:	Yeah. •947145_947205•
*UNK:	it, I didn't  and I felt I'd have no friends around where I lived and  you know, I'd always be alienated, I'd always be home later  and I said to my mum I don't think I can cope with it, so she said right then you don't go! •947205_956485•
        And I didn't. •957035_957365•
        And I never regretted it, I'll be quite honest with you. •957715_959505•
        And I think lots of children probably feel that way. •959505_961775•
*TER:	Yeah. •961775_961835•
*UNK:	And  •961855_961955•
*TER:	That's right! •962395_962685•
*UNK:	you know. •962685_962825•
        But it's  •963845_964345•
*TER:	Ha! •964345_964405•
*UNK:	nice talking to someone about education cos I talk to some people and they think I'm crackers cos I took my kid out of a state school! •964405_969795•
        You know? •969935_970065•
*TER:	Ya, I I, I'm only sorry that you felt you  •970085_972175•
*UNK:	Yeah that  •972175_972425•
*TER:	had to! •972425_972625•
        And I'm sorry  •972625_972975•
*UNK:	I am! •972975_973065•
*TER:	the fact that you had to! •973065_974045•
*UNK:	I am! •974045_974235•
*TER:	Erm but I, you know I think that's  that, that's an indictment of it you see because I  •974335_977795•
*UNK:	Oh it's cost us an arm and a leg! •977795_979065•
        It really has! •979065_979415•
*TER:	Yeah sure! •979415_979575•
*UNK:	and it's  what makes me so cross as I walk past that blinking school every day and you think my kid should be over there! •979575_983845•
*TER:	That's it! •984595_985265•
*UNK:	That's just  the way I feel   •985345_986095•
*TER:	Yeah I know it's sad isn't it? •986125_987275•
*UNK:	Do you know what I mean? •987275_987665•
*TER:	Yeah I do. •987665_988165•
        I do know what you  •988205_988895•
*UNK:	Yeah. •988895_988955•
*TER:	mean and I think it's, it's, it's a shame! •988955_990515•
        It's awful really! •991255_992095•
*UNK:	when I speak about it I get so upset that they've got three or four and they can't ! •992125_995225•
*TER:	And that's right! •995265_995585•
*UNK:	You see. •995785_996105•
*TER:	You can't! •996105_996615•
*UNK:	And there, lots of people and and lots of them actually they came from Abbotsbury and  that all their kids were doing so well and then this period of a year, nothing! •997395_100540•
