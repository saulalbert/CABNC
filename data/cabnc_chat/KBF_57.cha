*BRE:	Mm. •941232_941512•
*JEA:	You know, cos I'm, I'm spending money and time on him that really has those in theory I would be spending on my own grand children, however, I take the attitude that in modern times, people don't, people are not obliged •941862_957222•
*BRE:	The thing is today our  •957222_958072•
*JEA:	To feel , by duty as it were, that they ought to take notice of their immediate family, John and Maryann are capable of financially supporting themselves, so I don't worry about the money aspect and in every other way physiologically, emotionally, immorally they, they are able to look after themselves Neil isn't . •958072_975872•

*JEA:	No, no. •997032_998052•
*BRE:	But that's how relationships should be. •999252_100098•
*JEA:	Mm, mm  its one of the great arguments from the old fashioned sort of religion, that you could turn, you could definitely turn to people and say  why are you leaning on me so hard, for all this to fought, you ought to be reading your bible, saying your prayers, going to church and getting in touch with the boss  why I laughed when they were saying that Terry Waite would need counselling, I bet that Terry Waite was praying his head off and he'd memorised masses of the bible which he would be reciting to himself probably set himself two o'clock every afternoon, I remember what I can, book of  you know  I don't suppose he'd needed any counselling, he'd probably do better counselling other people. •100114_104771•
*BRE:	That's right, yeah, cos I mean he's, he's certainly sort of, even though he's been sort of prisoner, I mean, he's seen what's going on and, and he's had what five years of it? •104771_105690•
