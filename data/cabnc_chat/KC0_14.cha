@Comment:	conversation #14 (Tape 033505)
*ENI:	What we were talking about, or what I think is interesting is   (.) your experience from your early days in horse shoeing   (.) has stood you in good stead for the revival of interest in driving   (.) erm   (.) if you'd like to tell us a bit more about that I'd love to hear it cos I'm never tired of that.
*ANN:	Yeah well er   (.) the shoeing today is   (.) completely different to what it was when I started   (.) nearly sixty year ago.In them days   (.) horses were   (.) they were all working hors , driving horses   (.) you hardly ever see a riding horse.Er   (.) the ones they did ride were the ones they used to drive at erm ah, down the two jars  (.) but er   (.) and that was a completely different   (.) way of life then   (.) to what that is now.Er 
*ENI:	Mm.
*ANN:	er the horses that are shod today, you see they all   (.) riding horses, no   (.) very few working horses.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Er   (.) but now the 
*ENI:	It's, and that's your hobby isn't it?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Er   (.) where before that was   (.) the horse   (.) was equivalent for a motor today.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	So that was a living.
*JOH:	It did the 
*ANN:	Er 
*JOH:	job of a tractor, it did the 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	job a van   (.) a lorry
*ANN:	Lorry.
*JOH:	a car, everything!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Ah , every form of transport
*ANN:	Transport.
*JOH:	when you think about it.
*ENI:	Yes.Mhm.And is it 
*ANN:	But now 
*ENI:	different type of horse that makes it different for shodding 
*ANN:	Oh yes!
*ENI:	today?
*ANN:	Oh yeah!
*ENI:	Not the question of the same horses doing a different job.
*ANN:	No, that's a different type of horse er
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	er, the old fashioned working horses   (.) er   (.) practically extinct.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	And the shires are still there fairly strong, still   (.) er   (.) some of course has now gone onto the   (.) rare breeds.
*ENI:	Mm!
*ANN:	Er   (.) registered you see.Er   (.) Welsh colts   (.) and   (.) things of that nature are coming back a bit now, they are   (.) building up now   (.) er   (.) but 
*JOH:	But would I be right in saying that   (.) the everyday working horse, the sort of, general purpose working horse that people used years ago, people such as carriers, they would use horses which were crossbreeds wouldn't they?Not 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	not a purebred anything.
*ANN:	Not a pure , no!
*JOH:	They'd be good old heavy, honest, rough 
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah, yeah.
*JOH:	hard working horses.
*ANN:	That's right.
*JOH:	Not things of beauty really at all.
*ANN:	No.No, ooh no, no!
*JOH:	And you hardly ever see that type now do you?Gypsies 
*ANN:	No.
*JOH:	have them.You still 
*ENI:	They were 
*JOH:	see gypsies with that sort.
*ENI:	built for strength
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	for the 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	jobs.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	Work.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	Were they?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Purely for 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	work and hardiness.
*ANN:	And they're ornaments today, they aren't working horses.
*ENI:	That's right.
*ANN:	You put these horses into hard work today they'd be dead within three months!
*ENI:	Would they?
*ANN:	Ooh yes!Yeah!
*JOH:	Yes, the whole scene has altered.And er, as I say, observing this and watching Hector's work and how things have gone on over the years, er as you know, there's been a tremendous revival of interest in driving, so many people   (.) have er, restored carts or had new ones built   (.) and erm   (.) the young farriers who've never had the experience with driving horses, they have run into problems with erm, keeping them going soundly and overcoming problems which crop up when horses are driven on the road a lot.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Mm.
*JOH:	Would you like to tell us a bit more about that?
*ANN:	Well, yeah that is, I'm   (        ) I mean that's a completely different   (.) er er laxing of the, it's completely different.Er   (.) when you're riding a horse, you see the weight is all on the back   (.) er   (.) whichever tendency   (.) do and what we call the gait   (.) er 
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	is the hind legs in the front
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	they have a tendency to open them   (.) make them wider apart 
*ENI:	Oh yes!
*ANN:	by the backs.
*ENI:	G A I T.
*JOH:	That's right, that kind of gait.
*ANN:	By the back and swop them you see.Well   (.) er, with a driving horse that's completely opposite because yo  (.) your vehicle behind the horse   (.) is pushing   (.) against it
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	and have a tendency to   (.) punt the back
*ENI:	Really?
*ANN:	so that pushes the   (.) legs fo  (.) closer together, do you see?
*ENI:	Good heavens!
*JOH:	They're more likely to   (        ) 
*ANN:	And then they're more likely to hit, they're more likely to hit 
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	the   (.) front legs with the back legs
*ENI:	Really!
*ANN:	when they're going, especially going down hill.
*JOH:	And of course, there's a word in the trade for that isn't there?
*ANN:	Yeah.Forging.
*ENI:	What is it?
*JOH:	It's what, now there's a 
*ENI:	Forging?
*JOH:	completely 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	different use for the word forging.
*ENI:	Now, is it related to forging ahead   (.) in any way?Oh do , is that where forging ahead comes 
*JOH:	I 
*ENI:	from?When you're really pushing?
*ANN:	Yeah, yeah, pushing.
*JOH:	It might well be.It might 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	well be.I would say the term 
*ANN:	And, and then they can 
*JOH:	forging ahead has come from   (.) the use of that word in relation to horses.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JOH:	I would say, because that 
*ANN:	Yeah, probably.
*JOH:	dates back many, many years doesn't 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	it?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.Because they 
*ANN:	That's it.
*JOH:	do do it when they're pushing ahead 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	they, they hit the front foot with the hind one.
*ENI:	Good Lord!
*JOH:	Occasionally you 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	hear them do it
*ENI:	Oh!
*JOH:	when they're driving, it's quite a sharp 
*ANN:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*JOH:	crack you 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	hear.
*ENI:	It's amazing!
*ANN:	Mm.
*JOH:	Er   (.) so that's, that's completely different do you see?So the styling of shoeing   (.) is different.
*ENI:	Mm.
*ANN:	Completely different.
*JOH:	If they do it too much then the farrier's not doing a good job 
*ANN:	Job.
*JOH:	and his job
*ENI:	Really?
*JOH:	is to re-balance the shoe so that er, it just misses 
*ANN:	Miss.
*JOH:	the front foot as it comes forward.If the 
*ENI:	Right.
*JOH:	if the horse is travelling fast on the road he's at the trot, I mean it isn't 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road, they never ever should.
*ENI:	No.
*JOH:	Erm, but at the trot, when th the the legs are moving the diagonals are moving so of course the front and the hind foot come very close together 
*ENI:	Ah that's it!
*JOH:	at one point in the gait 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	and if the 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	shoe is slightly wrongly balanced, or the foot is slightly wrongly trimmed, then you get these troubles, you 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	also get what we call, brushing don't you?
*ANN:	Brushing.When they 
*JOH:	Tell Edith about that.
*ANN:	when they hit both legs together   (.) like the hind legs when they   (.) they'll hit each other they'll hit one hind leg 
*JOH:	They really, they 
*ANN:	with other one you see.
*JOH:	They really 
*ENI:	Ooh!
*JOH:	wear
*ANN:	They give it a  (        ) .
*JOH:	a a a sore place 
*ENI:	Ooh yes!
*JOH:	on the 
*ANN:	Yes.
*ENI:	Like us banging our ankles like that.
*ANN:	That's it.
*JOH:	Yes.Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	They do it on what we call the coronet
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	which is of course the little   (.) junction between the skin and the hair.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Ooh!
*JOH:	Very tender place.It's like the quick of our nail
*ENI:	Ooh yes!
*JOH:	where the
*ENI:	I can imagine!
*JOH:	tissue grows from.And they do 
*ANN:	And on the front 
*JOH:	damage their coronet.
*ANN:	On the front one they do it on the knee which is the   (.) er   (.) do you see, which is higher up.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	But the knee comes sort of out 
*ANN:	Out.
*ENI:	doesn't it?Er inside 
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ENI:	there's a
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	nobble
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	on the, yes.
*ANN:	Yeah, yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah so, and that's what they call cutting.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	Really?
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	You'd never dream!And so people who go and, usually into horses   (.) need to know all these or else they're going to be very unfair to the horse.
*ANN:	Well er 
*JOH:	They should know about it!
*ANN:	They should know it.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	They should know it.But er 
*JOH:	But it , mainly it's the farrier's job to know.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	But course, they don't er 
*JOH:	It's his responsibility.
*ANN:	they don't do enough work to really   (.) create any problems today, do you see what they're to do   (.) somebody will say ooh we'll go out for a ride
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	they're out, half an hour?
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Hey?We'll go out for a drive   (.) probably out an hour, whereas years ago the horse used to come out the stable at seven in the morning   (.) he wouldn't go back till probably five at night.
*ENI:	Course!
*ANN:	Probably later than that!
*ENI:	Mhm.
*ANN:	He'd go   (.) the driving horses, they'd probably go to Wickham market Monday   (.) do you see, the sale on the Monday   (.) they'd go to Ipswich on the Tuesday   (.) er   (.) Wednesday they'd go to Bury   (.) er   (.) and Ailsworth 
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	And they really earned their 
*ANN:	Then they'd go to Norwich.
*JOH:	keep!
*ENI:	Full time job!
*JOH:	Ooh they worked hard!
*ANN:	And then they'd go to Norwich on the Saturday.
*ENI:	Mm.
*ANN:	I mean they'd, they'd, they'd be doing probably   (.) anything up to forty mile a day weren't they?
*ENI:	Would be.Yeah.
*ANN:	Yes.And I mean, that was six days a week!
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	But now they do   (.) er   (.) twenty minutes they think they'd have done wonders!
*JOH:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	 [laughing] Or go from pub to pubs 
*ANN:	You know.
*JOH:	that's about it  [] !
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	And you think of these  (        ) , for instance Prince 
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Phillip, who is 
*JOH:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ENI:	presumably those horses don't do long spells of that sort 
*ANN:	No.
*ENI:	of driving?
*ANN:	No.No.
*ENI:	They'll be exercised in other ways I imagine will they?
*ANN:	Exercised, yeah, they're exercised, normal exercise during the week and then   (.) when they do these events do you see?But of course, if you go back far enough do you see   (.) on these four in hands were   (.) were going from town to town weren't they?I mean, they were   (.) they were mail originally weren't they?
*ENI:	On the stage coaches, yes.
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ANN:	Stage coaches 
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Er   (.) on the horses   (.) that's understandable, they can start off and probably don't knock theirself   (.) but there's a time they'd done twenty or thirty mile pulling a load.
*JOH:	They're tired, (        ) 
*ANN:	They're tired 
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ANN:	er, and then they start   (.) and that's when the trouble starts.
*ENI:	Just as we do, walking a bit less 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	carefully.
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.Yes, the same 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	thing applies.
*ENI:	Mm!
*JOH:	Exactly!
*ENI:	Mm!
*JOH:	And
*ENI:	What about   (.) er, in those days   (.) er, possibly a few still, when erm   (.) let's, you said gypsies didn't you?
*ANN:	Mm.
*ENI:	or let's say just erm   (.) odd tradesmen had   (.) a horse or a pony or whatever it was   (.) pulling a cart   (.) round the streets with vegetables or with, with er coal 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	or something   (.) what about the   (.) amount of   (.) care they would get from a farrier, those horses?
*ANN:	Well they   (.) they got reasonable care because, like I said, that was, that was the   (.) the owner knew that er   (.) that was his livelihood then
*ENI:	That's the thing I suppose, yes.
*ANN:	and he treated his horse   (.) well I mean a lot of these horseman, good horseman   (.) treated the horse better than they did the wife!
*ENI:	 [laughing] I wouldn't be surprised about that  [] !
*ANN:	Ooh yes!
*ENI:	Living in the East 
*ANN:	Yes.
*ENI:	End, I wouldn't be surprised 
*ANN:	Mm mm.
*ENI:	at that!
*ANN:	Oh yes!Er   (.) and they thought of, I mean they thought the world of their   (.) their animals and   (.) but 
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	er   (.) when   (.) you were in the trade like   (.) mine   (.) if you didn't do a good job   (.) the man never come back to you, there was a, there was a blacksmith farrier in every village!
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Some villages had two
*ENI:	Mhm.
*ANN:	And if you didn't do the job properly you didn't get the job and if you didn't get the job you went hungry!
*ENI:	Course!
*ANN:	So that er   (.) that made you do it properly!
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Yes, they were a 
*ANN:	And there was no   (.) there was no   (.) if you hadn't   (.) earned a shilling   (.) you'd got nothing to eat had you?
*ENI:	That's right.Necessity being a good driver.
*JOH:	Absolutely!
*ANN:	Well, yeah!Yeah.
*JOH:	Erm, Hector often quotes one particular instance which illustrates that very well   (.) er   (.) a as recently as your time, after you were er er shoeing 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	in your own business and everything, er people often say what did you used to charge?And it was six and eight pence for a set of shoes on a 
*ANN:	Six and eight pence, yes.
*JOH:	heavy horse, a land horse   (.) such as a Suffolk, as most of them were, erm   (.) but   (.) times were so tight that there was a farmer who used to send his horse with his horseman right past here and go another mile down the road to, to the next village to Kettleborough where there was ano , there were two farriers there
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	and one of them was doing them a halfpenny cheaper!
*ENI:	Ooh!
*JOH:	Six and seven pence halfpenny.
*ANN:	Halfpenny 
*JOH:	And the farmer thought that it would   (        ) 
*ANN:	 ((cough)) Payed him to do it.
*JOH:	to send them an extra mile each way and the extra 
*ENI:	Really!
*JOH:	time that took   (.) to get them shod a halfpenny cheaper!And things were as tight as that!
*ENI:	As tight as that?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	Mm.
*JOH:	So 
*ENI:	I suppose, now would, could that possibly be called a false economy?What was he using up 
*JOH:	It probably was.
*ENI:	 (        ) time?
*ANN:	Well if that was, I meant   (.) that would be today
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	but er   (.) in them days there was no such thing as   (.) false economy, I'd and I, economy didn't come into it 
*JOH:	No.
*ANN:	else he'd of   (.) I mean 
*JOH:	No.
*ANN:	er
*JOH:	People didn't set the same   (.) cost value on time as they 
*ANN:	Time.
*ENI:	I was going to say, time 
*JOH:	do now.
*ENI:	didn't count in the same
*ANN:	No and er 
*JOH:	It really didn't seem to
*ENI:	No.
*JOH:	it's very funny that!
*ENI:	Mm.
*ANN:	If you're   (.) if you hadn't earned the money well   (.) you didn't go into it in detail and   (.) get the time and motion study man 
*ENI:	No.
*ANN:	in to look at the job did you?Just thought 
*ENI:	That's right.
*ANN:	well   (.) we'd better pull ourselves together and see if we can put this right!
*ENI:	That's right.
*ANN:	Er   (.) you never really went into it to see where you had lost the money.
*ENI:	No.No.
*ANN:	Er   (.) but you just grabbed a little harder so that you made ends meet
*ENI:	That's right.By the result you 
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ENI:	would see that you had to work a bit 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	harder and   (        ) 
*ANN:	There was no   (.) no working out to see how you could do anything cheaper.
*ENI:	No.No.
*ANN:	No.
*ENI:	Aha.
*JOH:	But any economy that was made   (.) or in the early days of Hector's er   (.) business, I know, was always saving material rather than time.
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Erm   (.) and the instinct remains doesn't it?
*ANN:	Oh yeah!
*JOH:	Your your instinct is to save 
*ANN:	 (        ) a bit harder.
*JOH:	an odd bit of se steel or iron off a bar which the modern man would say well there's 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	no point in saving that because by the 
*ENI:	That's right.
*JOH:	time you've looked 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	for it and found it when you want it   (.) er, it would have paid you to cut a bit off a new bar.
*ENI:	That's it.Time costing as much 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	as it now does.
*JOH:	Time now 
*ANN:	Yeah, that's right.
*JOH:	is er, is the main driving thing but   (.) in your early days it was material every time.
*ANN:	Oh material every time!
*JOH:	Erm   (.) tell Edith 
*ANN:	Labour 
*JOH:	about some of the er er oh normal economies that were made, like, erm making odd links 
*ANN:	Well, oh well the horse 
*JOH:	into staples and all that sort of thing.
*ANN:	well the horse shoes you see, we used to   (.) we used to weld   (.) one and a half   (.) old horse shoes together in the fire   (.) to make one new one again.
*ENI:	Really?
*ANN:	Ooh yes!They weren't thrown 
*ENI:	One turned the other way on top 
*ANN:	We 
*ENI:	of the other?
*ANN:	used to   (.) get one shoe and a   (.) ta , in the middle so that, so that cut the   (.) half new one
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	turn it over on itself   (.) then the other one we used to half
*ENI:	Oh!
*ANN:	and put the other   (.) piece in between the two and make a sandwich
*ENI:	Golly yes!
*ANN:	so you'd got a piece that shape, half   (.) new one
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	and that was all welded together in the fire   (.) into a straight bar
*JOH:	And then you'd start all over again!
*ANN:	and then you'd start all over again!
*ENI:	Oh I see.You didn't use 
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	that as a shoe   (.) you then 
*JOH:	Re 
*ENI:	made it an a new 
*JOH:	Re-shape it.
*ENI:	piece of metal?
*ANN:	Yes.And then 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	yeah, and then re  (.) re-used it to shoe.
*ENI:	Mm.
*ANN:	Made another shoe out of a
*ENI:	That's right 
*ANN:	er 
*ENI:	yes.
*JOH:	And that was a genuine economy then.
*ANN:	Oh yeah!Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	Yes.Yes.
*ANN:	Er 
*JOH:	Erm
*ANN:	old cart tyres we used to split them up the middle and made shoes.
*ENI:	Did you?
*ANN:	Oh yes!Er
*ENI:	Because they were made of the right kind of iron?
*ANN:	Yeah.Er 
*JOH:	And erm 
*ANN:	 (        ) you see, we used to   (.) when old shoes do you see, you could only use them   (.) a certain number of times by   (.) welding them up
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	er   (.) after they got so you   (.) hadn't got no more life in them we used to   (.) weld short bits onto   (.)  (        ) .
*ENI:	Really?
*JOH:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Still all done in the fire.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Wired?
*ANN:	Old chains 
*JOH:	And 
*ANN:	when they wore thin on the end   (.) and we had to put a new link in   (.) we never threw the two halves of the link away, we pointed them and made them into staples.
*ENI:	Really?
*ANN:	Because the middle part of the link wasn't worn you see, that was still a good bit of metal in it.
*ENI:	Yes, course.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Isn't it   (.) tragic to think how far from that we've moved?
*JOH:	Yes , it is really.
*ANN:	Yeah, mm.
*JOH:	Yes, it's 
*ENI:	And it's so wasteful u 
*JOH:	it's all throw away 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	now isn't it?
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	It seems morally wrong.
*ENI:	It hurts us 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	who've known 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	the other thing doesn't it?
*JOH:	Yes it does!
*ANN:	Yeah, yeah.
*ENI:	Mm.
*JOH:	It goes against the grain terribly!
*ANN:	And I am   (.) if at five minutes to five, or five minutes to leaving off time   (.) whatever it was   (.) and you wouldn't say well   (.) we'll get ready to go home   (.) you had to pick a half a link up   (.) make it into a staple and throw it in the box.
*ENI:	Yes.That was ready for next time and you've saved 
*ANN:	That was ready for when   (.) Yeah.
*ENI:	that time.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	I forget what it was you used to make old horse rasps into because for
*ANN:	Ooh yes!
*JOH:	farrier has a, has a file   (.) with very, very coarse teeth on one side 
*ENI:	That's right.
*JOH:	and slightly less coarse on the other
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	is used for rasping the the hoof   (.) erm   (.) I can't remember what you used 
*ANN:	We used to use all sorts of things.
*JOH:	used the old ones for.
*ANN:	Hooks, flashers.
*JOH:	Because that's a special hard   (.) steel isn't it?
*ANN:	It's hard steel, now.
*JOH:	It's not ordinary iron is it?
*ANN:	They used to use, make them into flashers and hooks for hedge cutting and
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	hoes for chopping out sugar 
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	beet.
*ENI:	Yes, because of course you had all the equipment to shape it up anew
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	didn't you?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	You could make whatever sort of shape you wanted from it   [laughing] I should 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	imagine  [] .
*ANN:	Yep!
*JOH:	 (        ) 
*ENI:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	That's an i ,i interesting thing talking about the names of the tools too erm   (.) flashers and hooks, now in other parts 
*ANN:	Now you never hear that.
*JOH:	of the country you would probably hear them called a slasher and a   (.) what?
*ANN:	I mean, nearly all people   (.) think a hook is a hook don't do, for hanging 
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	things on?
*JOH:	Mm.Yes.
*ANN:	Well in Suffolk you see, a hook is a thing for cutting the hedge.
*ENI:	Yes 
*ANN:	A hooker.
*ENI:	a a curved scy a sickle type 
*ANN:	A   (        ) , yeah.
*ENI:	shaped thing.
*ANN:	Yes.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Or a chopper.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	I see.And you just call that a hook?
*ANN:	A hook, yeah.
*ENI:	So you di , did you call the thing you were doing hooking   (.) or not?
*ANN:	What er
*ENI:	Wi with hook, would you say 
*JOH:	When you were using it
*ENI:	that you were hooking 
*ANN:	No you'd be 
*ENI:	the hedge or not?
*ANN:	You'd be hedging.
*ENI:	You're hedging.
*ANN:	Yeah, hedging them.
*ENI:	Yes, I see.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah,
*ENI:	The tool was a separate name?
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ENI:	Really?Aha.
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ENI:	And did you have to repair things, well you probably did, er farm instruments, I don't mean the big implements but things like their scythes and what 
*ANN:	Oh yes!
*ENI:	have you?
*ANN:	We used to ma , we used to buy the scythe blade and 
*JOH:	Well that was the blacksmith's bread and butter, that kind of thing.
*ANN:	and do all the other   (.) iron work on it, you see, yes.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Oh yes!
*ENI:	Mhm.
*ANN:	Yeah.Hoes and   (.) things like that were all   (.) er   (.) hand made.
*ENI:	Ha!
*ANN:	Spuds, dock spuds   (.) thistle spuds.
*JOH:	Have you come across a spud?
*ENI:	Now how do you spell that, S P A D
*JOH:	It would be G D. 
*ENI:	G E. 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	I think it would be S P U D
*ANN:	D, yeah.
*JOH:	Yes?
*ENI:	Oh just a s 
*JOH:	Yes?
*ANN:	Spud.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	Sped?Spud.
*JOH:	I think so.I think so.
*ENI:	Really?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Th , it's a dialect word really.
*ENI:	Oh not erm, not a spadge Yo er
*ANN:	No.
*ENI:	I heard the name spadge when I was   (        ) 
*JOH:	No, it would be spud wouldn't it?
*ANN:	No, (        ) spud.
*ENI:	Really?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	It's probably in the dialect book, I haven't looked it up.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Yeah.
*ENI:	I'm rather 
*JOH:	And another good old word is the crome, now er that was one I came across for the first time when I came into Suffolk, the crome.I jolly soon learnt what a crome was, I didn't ask I waited to find out. ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	 ((laugh))  (.)  (        ) learn a foreign language 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	isn't it?
*JOH:	Yes.Yes.
*ENI:	What, what was that?
*ANN:	Well a a 
*JOH:	Mm mm.
*ANN:	crome is a
*JOH:	He couldn't believe I didn't know what a crome was!
*ANN:	that's ooh ah 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	well either two or four times   (.) er   (.) turned down on a long handle   (.) for pouring   (.) things   (.) er   (.) out of the, I mean like, when I used to
*JOH:	I know what it is now.
*ANN:	when they used to put er   (.) the muck on the fields   (.) they used to put so many loads of eight and so many heaps of the    (        )  (.) well, when they pulled it out of the   (        ) room   (.) they'd pulls out the crome.
*JOH:	Like a fork bent at right angles.
*ANN:	Angles.
*ENI:	Oh!
*JOH:	It's the ideal thing for that 
*ENI:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	job 
*ANN:	Yes.
*JOH:	you see.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JOH:	A fork , only   (.) bent over.
*ENI:	I see!
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ANN:	And the old
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	the real old   (.) gardeners   (.) and I mean well every house had one   (.) because they used to grow their own vegetables didn't they?
*ENI:	That's right.
*ANN:	Well when they dug the garden, after they'd dug it they always cromed it down with a crome before they planted anything.
*ENI:	Really?
*ANN:	Used the crome as the rake.
*JOH:	Aha.
*ENI:	Now could that be 
*JOH:	Mm mm.
*ENI:	the same sort of thing that Noel bought last year when he saw one of the men in the village, using it to pull out a lot of weed from undergrowth, really 
*ANN:	I expect so.
*JOH:	I expect so.
*ENI:	it's er,i and it's got three prongs   (.) like that, and there's, I think, an arrowhead shape on each prong.
*ANN:	Ah that'd be the modern ones.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	Yes, that would be 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	the modern
*ANN:	The modern one, but er 
*ENI:	adaptation.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	That'd be the modern one.
*JOH:	Similar principle.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Sim sim 
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	It is 
*JOH:	Yeah.
*ENI:	erm, for getting up   (.) a lot 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	of weed?
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	The old style crome would be a thing about as wide as that
*ANN:	Yeah, about ten 
*ENI:	What about 
*ANN:	ten inches wi and the 
*ENI:	Mhm.
*ANN:	 (        ) would be 
*JOH:	Yes and   (.) and the   (        ) would be parallel
*ANN:	Parallel.
*JOH:	four times, wouldn't they?
*ANN:	Four.
*JOH:	And e , equally distanced.
*ANN:	Fo for that work.
*ENI:	Ah yes!
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ANN:	But for   (.) pulling the muck out of the tumble   (.) they only have two.
*ENI:	Oh!
*ANN:	Two tines.
*ENI:	Did they?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	More like a pitch fork bent at right angles then?
*ANN:	But bent at right angles.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	That would be a muck crome?
*ANN:	That'd be a muck 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	crome.Yeah.
*ENI:	And was a lot of straw in with that?
*ANN:	Oh that was all straw, do you 
*ENI:	Ah!
*ANN:	see?
*ENI:	Because otherwise you couldn't have pulled 
*ANN:	No.
*ENI:	er, sort of muck without 
*ANN:	No no.
*JOH:	No.
*ENI:	straw could you?
*ANN:	No , no.
*JOH:	No.
*ENI:	But straw
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	of course.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ANN:	Yeah.And the tines on a muck crome are flat, whereas the ones on an ordinary one for   (.) all the work were either round or square.
*ENI:	I see.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	So I came across these things you see when we were first married because I used to write out all Hector's bills for him, by hand before we had a typewriter
*ENI:	Mhm.
*JOH:	and of , I'd come across these words you see, I'd think crome?Crome, what is that? [laughing] You know  [] !
*ENI:	Yes.Even to spell it 
*ANN:	And gradually the 
*ENI:	in the first place 
*JOH:	Yeah.
*ENI:	you needed 
*JOH:	So I had to 
*ENI:	to know.
*JOH:	yeah, so I did have to guess a great deal
*ENI:	Mm.
*JOH:	because no good looking in the dictionary for a lot of these things.
*ENI:	No.
*JOH:	No, no, no 
*ANN:	Mm.
*JOH:	no.
*ENI:	no.
*JOH:	No.I assumed that a crome was C R O M E, and I still do! ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Yes.
*JOH:	cos I've never come across anything else!
*ANN:	Well I mean all the, all the   (.) all the dialect words are
*JOH:	Phonetic really 
*ANN:	spelt 
*JOH:	aren't they?They have to be!
*ANN:	They're spelt as you say them.
*JOH:	They have to be!
*ENI:	They are , that's true.
*JOH:	Mm mm!They are phonetic.
*ANN:	They're spelt how you say them so they can be spelt   (.) er   (.) ten different ways in the same village!
*JOH:	And still be right!
*ENI:	That's right, I see.
*JOH:	Because there's no   (.) there's no dictionary spelling 
*ANN:	Cos I mean, I'd 
*JOH:	for a lot of them.
*ANN:	well I I spells how I say it.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Er   (.) somebody up the road   (.) er   (.) hundred yards   (.) would spells how he 
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	say it.
*JOH:	I I used to notice that 
*ANN:	And there's just that little bit of
*ENI:	It was phonetic spelling!
*JOH:	Yes!
*ANN:	Yeah!Yeah.
*JOH:	When the cards were, from the   (.) er, the workshop would come in   (.) which the lads had done their work, I mean, one of them, I know dear old Pete, in particular, he'd write for crome, C R double O M, because that's how he'd say it.
*ENI:	Croom.
*JOH:	Yes!
*ANN:	Yeah , croom.
*JOH:	Yes!
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	But it's still right.Yes!
*ENI:	And very often the O, in the Suffolk dialect goes to an ooh doesn't it?
*JOH:	Ooh yes!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes!
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ENI:	Home.
*JOH:	Eith either a long ooh, or a sort ooh, like er, like in 
*ANN:	It's as a 
*JOH:	room or   (        ) 
*ANN:	mostly a short one because 
*ENI:	Mm.
*ANN:	that's a   (.) lazy language the Suffolk dialect innit?
*JOH:	I suppose it is in a way.
*ENI:	I suppose a lot 
*ANN:	You cu 
*ENI:	of dialect is.
*ANN:	cut out this 
*JOH:	Yes   (.) it is isn't it?
*ANN:	cut everything short don't you?
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	Oh yeah.
*ENI:	Yes you do.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	But it's quite different from the unpleasantly lazy speech that you get now, for instance, Lancashire   (.) i it's 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	not true Lancashire that's spoken up there, it's a lazy   (.) you 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	know up the city  ((said without the t))
*JOH:	Yes 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	yes, yes, yes.
*ENI:	that sort of thing.Nothing like over 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	No.
*ENI:	here 
*ANN:	No.
*ENI:	dialect.
*JOH:	Yeah, same as the erm   (.) what you get from the outskirts of London, the home counties, I call 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	that ugly too!
*ENI:	It is!
*JOH:	True cockney is a treat to listen to.
*ENI:	That's right.
*JOH:	But there's a lot of adulterated cockney in the home counties, I used to hear it a lot in Hertfordshire.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Erm, especially in the war because the evacuees of course, would come along and of course 
*ANN:	Yes.
*JOH:	all the local children picked it up, of course they did! [laughing] And we'd all go home talking like them and our mothers complained  [] !
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Er, but it was interesting all the same.It was interesting to hear them.
*ENI:	Indeed!
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	But that a thousand   (        ) do you see a   (.) the dialects are going
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	and they'll soon be gone   (.) and one thing which annoyed me   (.) er   (.) a Scotsman   (.) or a Welshman   (.) or an Irishman   (.) can go on television   (.) they'll accept them   (.) and they can talk their
*JOH:	You mean as a newsreader or a a presenter of programme 
*ANN:	lingo, as a newsreader, as a presenter 
*JOH:	don't you?
*ENI:	Exactly!
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	and yet, if anybody go on there with a southern dialect they wouldn't   (.) well they wouldn't have them there!
*ENI:	That's true, isn't it?
*ANN:	Cos they aren't talking the queen's English!
*JOH:	It's taking a 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	long time for dialects to be accepted but I think   (.) I think that boundary is giving way
*ENI:	Well I hope 
*JOH:	frankly.
*ENI:	it will universally because 
*JOH:	Mm mm.
*ENI:	I feel the Scots make a tremendous fuss about their
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	speech and 
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	their traditions!
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	You never hear on the whole   (.) the Englishman saying   (.) but I'm English!
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	No.
*JOH:	No you don't.We're 
*ENI:	Do you?
*JOH:	We're too 
*ANN:	No, no.
*JOH:	self-effacing aren't we?
*ANN:	And yet they'll a 
*ENI:	But they 
*ANN:	they'll accept the big proposals
*JOH:	Mm.
*ANN:	of television and radio 
*JOH:	Yes!
*ENI:	Yes!
*ANN:	and that  (        ) .
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	That's right.
*ANN:	Top jobs for them!
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	But when you te 
*ANN:	And yet if you go for a top job   (.) in the city or anywhere   (.) an and start talking in the   (.) southern dialect they'll   (        ) you.
*JOH:	Yeah, you're, you're made a laugh of aren't you?
*ENI:	Absolutely!
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	That's very true!
*JOH:	It is extraordinary!
*ENI:	It's also true that up in 
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	Scotland   (.) they don't like to hear English accents on their television and news.
*JOH:	Well I never!
*ENI:	They much prefer to have their own people.
*JOH:	Ooh!
*ENI:	But how often do we listen to a Scottish accent?
*ANN:	Scot yeah!
*ENI:	And every time a trade unionist comes on.
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	I'm afraid 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	we've got a little phrase, another 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	bloody Scot we say!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yeah , yeah well you do!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	And then   (.) you've got them 
*JOH:	You do!
*ENI:	with the roughest of the 
*JOH:	Yes!
*ENI:	the trade 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	unionists!
*JOH:	Yes!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	 (        ) pretty well   (        ) Scot 
*ANN:	Yeah, that's always   (        ) 
*JOH:	They are!They are!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.Yes.
*ENI:	So we've been perhaps a little 
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ENI:	bit erm   (.) reticent 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	about our dialects.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JOH:	Er Yes, yes.I I 
*ANN:	But er 
*JOH:	think it's   (.) time they
*ANN:	But I'm not gonna change, if anybody don't, but if they can't accept me 
*JOH:	 [laughing] No, I don't really think so  [] !
*ANN:	well they must er    (.)  (        ) 
*JOH:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	Well er , you can't say that it's hard to understand because I'm a Londoner and 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	for a long time I have been
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	and you never say anything that I don't understand, unless you were to use a word like crome.
*JOH:	Well quite 
*ANN:	Oh yeah.
*JOH:	a word, an 
*ANN:	Yeah 
*JOH:	actual word 
*ENI:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	that you've never come across.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Mm.
*JOH:	But after all, once is enough, and once you know, you know don't you?
*ENI:	Exactly!
*JOH:	You don't forget.
*ENI:	No!
*ANN:	No.
*JOH:	Erm
*ENI:	You don't.
*JOH:	No.No I 
*ANN:	That's right.
*JOH:	I found coming into Suffolk from Hertfordshire I hadn't heard the, any East Anglian dialect before at all   (.) erm   (.) I didn't find it difficult, there were only two cases and I can remember thinking   (.) there were two people   (.) er, one of whom is still alive, er who I had great difficulty in understanding and I thought when I can   (.) follow both of them without any difficulty I shall know I really belong.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	And, it didn't take long with one of them, that was Dennis 
*ANN:	Mm, Dennis .
*JOH:	and the other one, I don't know whether you knew him, I think he lived in Earlsome for a time didn't he?
*ANN:	No, well Monksome 
*JOH:	Didn't he?Monksome 
*ANN:	Monksome 
*JOH:	Erm, a chap called Ben    (.) erm
*ANN:	No, I don't 
*ENI:	No.
*ANN:	I expect he was days before 
*JOH:	and my word he was difficult to follow!
*ENI:	Was he?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.Er   (.) he spoke fast, that was the problem, most 
*ENI:	Oh yes!
*JOH:	Suffolk people don't.
*ENI:	No, they don't.
*JOH:	They give you time to listen and time to think
*ENI:	They do.
*JOH:	but he spoke quickly   (.) with a very strong accent and that 
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	took me a lot of years before I could   (.) and I was so pleased when once I was able to say to you   (.) I've   (.) Ben  had been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	You and me and him and Joe , was another 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	one   (.) and we'd had a chat for a long, long time and I said to him afterwards, I was able to understand everything he said!
*ENI:	Wonderful!
*JOH:	 [laughing] I was so pleased  [] !
*ENI:	 [laughing] That's an achievement  [] !
*JOH:	 [laughing] Yes  [] !
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENI:	You know one thing that's striking me at this moment   (.) actually, when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you 
*JOH:	Mm mm.
*ENI:	met   (.) er, Hector and   (.) you told me once before you had no eyes for anyone else there.
*JOH:	That's right.Perfectly true!
*ENI:	Erm , in these days when   (.) er, so large a proportion of marriages breaks down
*JOH:	Mm.
*ENI:	erm   (.) it seems to me that   (.) the marriage that has an interest to your occupation, let's say, in the man's hands
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ENI:	if you like
*JOH:	Mhm.
*ENI:	er, although you've got your own artistic contribution which you also   (.) combine with
*JOH:	True, yes.
*ENI:	Hector's work
*JOH:	That has   (.) been a great 
*ENI:	erm 
*JOH:	strength to us.
*ENI:	Oh, I think that's a   (.) a tremendous 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	strength to a marriage!
*JOH:	Yes.Yes.
*ENI:	I feel the same with Noel
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	if there's something really interesting that you have 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	between the two 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	of you
*JOH:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	erm, you don't give up at the first little hurdle.
*JOH:	Course you don't!
*ANN:	No, No.No 
*JOH:	It makes an incredible bond   (.) doesn't it?
*ENI:	Doesn't it?
*JOH:	Absolutely!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*ENI:	I feel that.
*JOH:	Yes!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage.
*JOH:	Ooh yes!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	It really does!
*JOH:	And I th , I think about a great deal because   (.) it's a very strange, it's a very strange thing to talk about but   (.) when I came to Suffolk, I might have told you this before   (.) er, I had hardly been away from home at all, I was only seventeen when I first met him
*ENI:	Mm.
*JOH:	and I had a very sheltered life, I was an only child, I hadn't been around much, I hadn't stayed away from home   (.) erm   (.) and   (.) I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was working at Brandeston Hall   (.) and erm   (.) she at that time was expecting to get engaged to   (.) a chappy in the village here who was, and still is a friend of Hector's and ours, and   (.) they didn't marry in the finish   (.) but she at that time wanted me to come up to Suffolk to see her   (.) and to meet this chappy who she thought she was going to marry   (.) and erm   (.) so, it was   (.) holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well   (.) why not?I'll erm, I'll venture and, and my parents said yes, that would be alright and so er   (.) so I came along and erm   (.) of course, it happened that he was in the   (.) he was in the forge talking to Hector on the first evening I came   (.) and that was how we met.
*ENI:	Mm.
*JOH:	And erm,i it was an extraordinary thing!But   (.) added to that, I can well remember   (.) staying at Kettleborough Chequers  (.) erm   (.) and   (.) er   (.) walking along   (.) from Kettleborough to Brandeston erm   (.) th the very next morning after I'd come here   (.) and I think it was before   (.) I think it was quite likely before we had   (.) we had actually met, I don't know whether it was the first day or the second
*ANN:	Yeah, (        ) 
*JOH:	that we met in in the shop there 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	but   (.) the strong impression I had is walking over the hill from Kettleborough where the gun club now is   (.) walking down into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the village nestling in the hollow   (.) and I can remember feeling a   (.) extraordinarily strong sensation that   (.) I could easily live there
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	I could belong there
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt it since!
*ENI:	Isn't that wonderful!
*JOH:	But it, there was something that felt right.
*ENI:	I yes, I really believe in that 
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	feeling!A sense of belonging.
*JOH:	Most extraordinary!
*ENI:	I belong here.
*JOH:	Yes.
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	Because I hadn't been around much, I hadn't been away from home
*ENI:	Really?
*JOH:	and i it was quite forcible!
*ENI:	Yes.
*JOH:	And er
*ENI:	Marvellous!
