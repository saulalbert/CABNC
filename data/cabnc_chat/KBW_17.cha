*DOR:	Mm   (.) cos she'll see you there.
*UNK:	Cos   (.) we're having, not problems, but at school it really    (        )  (.) it's unfortunate because she was put in a third year, and she's only a third year now   (.) and she was on a third year class last year.
*DOR:	Who else is there with her in there? (.) They're all
*UNK:	Well we've actually chose the brownies now   (        ) her age.
*DOR:	 (        )

*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Mind you, she's like that, better get 
*UNK:	When you're feeling keen I said, you can do a lot and then   (        ) 
*UNK:	They're rather weed, I know my two even  (        ) .
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	erm   (.) rather than

*UNK:	Yeah, that's right!
*UNK:	they come home they've gotta snuggle up in bed with a book 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*UNK:	you know, or   (.) Patrick's into psalms  (        ) , she loves poetry    (.)  (        )

*UNK:	Yeah.
*UNK:	But as they do, it's gonna hit her cos it's not year that   (.) it doesn't help, see if she's in a third year class, she was always   (.) as she is now, in the top of that, but even 
*UNK:	That's right.
*UNK:	when she was only a second year    (        )  (.) therefore   (.) that means, she's not given enough work, but I mean  (        ) 
*UNK:	I know what you mean.
*UNK:	She's sort of got   (        ) with children then because this erm   (.) testing, they've got to   (.) a school work outside 
*UNK:	 (        ) curriculum.
*UNK:	they've go , that's it,the  (.) they do have to take them on to

*UNK:	They've got an extra  (        ) .
*DOR:	Yeah   (.) haven't got to worry.
*UNK:	 (        ) all of them   (.) so when   (.) her class came up, cos she'd been with the class   (.) right from nursery   (.) and   (.) when she put into this   (.) you know, with the double third year, cos they go upstairs for third and fourth year   (.) and they really do    (.)
