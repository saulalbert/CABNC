*WEN:	Over at Basingstoke and I had a look in the shoe shops, and that, they would be very handy for me erm lace up though •1565_13275•
*BEV:	Yeah •13275_13495•
*WEN:	but these were are all crumped and I don't want clumsy ones  cos you feel as though you've got Doctor Marten's or something on you know •13495_21935•
*BEV:	But they're not comfortable after a while  •21935_23825•
*WEN:	and they look it though, they look it, that you know, they really do •23825_26065•
*BEV:	All fuddy duddy •26065_26725•
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah and they're sort of grey, I'm not sure if she got them in a charity, I'm certainly sure it wasn't bought in a shoe shop, cos she goes round every charity, she won't go in, you know I told you about that, oh I don't know what it is, she said it's loaded out with stuff and we'll have to have a walk round there, erm, round by what was Kennedy's, erm •26935_49455•
*BEV:	Yeah •50195_50535•
*WEN:	by the bingo hall •50945_51905•
*BEV:	Yeah •51905_52155•
*WEN:	that was a fruit shop she said it's loaded out as a cheap shop she said and erm, she won't go in there because bloke's stood in there, she said she don't mind going in and paying fifty, because, well they don't do that do they? •52465_65725•
*BEV:	No •66595_66985•
*WEN:	you know, so erm •67075_68115•
*BEV:	Yeah, but he's only watching the •68865_70895•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	well he's probably got nowhere else to go, I mean it's  •70895_73395•
*BEV:	No  •73395_73465•
*WEN:	just aged off innit, there must be an out place, but you wouldn't er •73465_76695•
*BEV:	I wouldn't leave them •76865_78245•
*WEN:	No you wouldn't leave it, but she said it's a cheap shop so, but she said there's loads •78245_82415•
*BEV:	but I've got to go to job spot one time  •82415_83885•
*WEN:	Yeah  •83885_84175•
*BEV:	so when we walk round •84295_85665•
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah that's right, but I mean just go and have a look, and I actually said to her well you'd be better with somebody else, you know, not going in there on your own •85665_94365•
*BEV:	Yeah •94615_94935•
*WEN:	and erm, you know, she, she obviously needs somebody else with her to make it not so obvious for her •96075_104015•
*BEV:	Yeah •104015_104335•
*WEN:	not •104405_104735•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	but I think that, that with what it is you know, but then I say she's got that anyway, she's not as, as tough as what she makes out, but er it would be worth having a look you never know what's in there, and I say I must pick up a couple of paper towels •104815_122935•
*BEV:	Yeah •122935_122995•
*WEN:	I'm not, I'm not gonna pay any more than that •122995_125875•
