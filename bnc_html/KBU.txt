                                     attention back to me.
None (PS18K)                         [378] Mm.

None (PS18L)                         [395] But it's not real
None (PS18K)                         [396] But I don't, what if I don't know

None (PS18K)                         [405] Yeah.
None (PS18L)                         [406] someone said to me, I know not, not
                                     like an accident or death or anything, but

                                     sisters or something?
                                     [407] I would imagine, in my mind, that
                                     something's gonna happen to my sisters for
                                     her not to be able to see it.

None (PS18K)                         [410] my mum went to a fortune teller and,
                                     and I had [...] there like tears running

None (PS18L)                         [413] And did you?
None (PS18K)                         [414] My mum bottled out when we got

Denise (PS18E)                       [417] the thing, the thing that erm
                                     worries me is in case I go over is, that

Denise (PS18E)                       [423] Because someone told Tony's mum that
                                     Tony would be married twice and the second
                                     marriage would be very happy. [laugh]

None (PS18L)                         [779] I think that's really odd ... that

None (PS18L)                         [786] Mm.
                                     [787] I didn't realize her family didn't
                                     know mind.

                                     [791] ... The family likes to pretend that
                                     they do.
Denise (PS18E)                       [792] Because it's, it's easier, they
                                     don't like to ... to realize these things.
None (PS18L)                         [793] I think it's very romantic.

Denise (PS18E)                       [901] I keep suddenly thinking of the

                                     [902] And th the fact that I haven't

None (PS18L)                         [907] But I found when I looked at my

                                     thought, oh I know this, I know this, but

                                     [909] A week ago I didn't know what to
                                     learn and now there's so many things that

                                     theories of change.

None (PS18L)                         [1016] Theories of change.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1017] But we started with Fred and only
                                     got

Denise (PS18E)                       [1019] a third of a ye way through it.
None (PS18L)                         [1020] Change in the N H S.
                                     [1021] Change, do you know what change
                                     she's talking about?
                                     [1022] Freezing, something when er a
                                     liquid is freezing and it changes when it
                                     is ... you know changes in the physical
                                     sense of the

None (PS18L)                         [1024] word.
                                     [1025] That's what they learn about.
                                     [1026] I said oh that's what I've got
                                     then.
                                     [1027] Cos I'm talking about change in the
                                     N H S is all we can put down.
None (PS18K)                         [1028] Here's Anne.
None (PS18L)                         [1029] But then it's just how bad it.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1030] [whispering] Oh!
                                     [1031] I wish we'd just done that [] .
None (PS18L)                         [1032] It's so, simplified.
                                     [1033] So basic, so ... logic.
                                     [1034] I mean, what do we need about
                                     planning something?
                                     [1035] We don't need it.
None (PS18K)                         [1036] I mean, I didn't understand much to
                                     be honest anyway.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1037] I wasn't listening cos I was
                                     writing them down. [laugh]
None (PS18L)                         [1038] The thing is, with this ... I don't
                                     think half the people listen to [...]
                                     you're meant to know ... you're meant to,
                                     in these exams you're meant to have
                                     everything you should know and everything
                                     else ... [...]
Denise (PS18E)                       [1039] That's it.
                                     [1040] I'm sitting writing notes and I'm
                                     thinking ... am I ever gonna look at these
                                     again?
                                     [1041] Cos every time I have an exam it's
                                     a [...] exactly the same things.
None (PS18K)                         [1042] I have got revision cards coming

                                     [1043] And erm ... which I'll never look
                                     at again [...] at all.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1044] [sniff] ... We're all looking very
                                     sorry for ourselves.
None (PS18L)                         [1045] Well what relevance is it to me?
                                     [1046] Is not

None (PS18L)                         [1048] I'm not gonna be a nurse anyway.
None (PS18K)                         [1049] And I'm gonna go away next, next

Denise (PS18E)                       [1050] Tony said I need to do some
                                     exercise late at night.
                                     [1051] Cos I annoy him.
                                     [1052] Because as soon as I go upstairs
                                     ... I'm wide awake. [laugh]
None (PS18L)                         [1053] Mm mm.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1054] He says you should go, go jogging
                                     or something late at night.
                                     [1055] I said well if you got us a dog I'd
                                     have to take it for a late night walk
                                     wouldn't I? [laugh]
None (PS18L)                         [1056] Come jogging with me.
                                     [1057] Do you fancy coming jogging?
Denise (PS18E)                       [1058] What?
                                     [1059] Last thing at night?
None (PS18L)                         [1060] Yeah.
None (PS18L)                         [1061] You go first thing in the morning.

None (PS18L)                         [1064] What like eleven o'clock?
None (PS18L)                         [1065] I don't, I've never played it but
                                     I'd certainly like to but [...]

Denise (PS18E)                       [1069] He says it's very unusual, you
                                     never see me like this ... [...] .
                                     [1070] Ooh!
                                     [1071] I quite fancy doing that.
None (PS18H)                         [1072] We should have done.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1073] You know I was thinking today
None (PS18K)                         [...]
Denise (PS18E)                       [1074] I was thinking today ... erm ...

                                     the fields just coming out of Morpeth ...

                                     ... as I was on the bus like yesterday
                                     coming into Morpeth and this horse just
                                     shot out of nowhere and it was [laughing]
                                     really enjoying itself!
                                     [1078] It was like galloping along [] !
None (PS18L)                         [1079] as if it was racing.
                                     [1080] Yeah.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1081] Yeah!

Denise (PS18E)                       [1089] And I was looking, I was thinking,
                                     oh!

Denise (PS18E)                       [1092] And then today when I was passing
                                     it was just munching away in the corner,
                                     you know.
                                     [1093] And I was thinking, tt, it must

                                     level, it really is.
                                     [1107] And because you could, you could
                                     just like ride away and not come back
                                     ever.

                                     [1111] And it's a different kind of
                                     enjoyment, but, I mean I've never played

None (PS18K)                         [1114] Or like when I, if I we say maybe,

                                     except with horse riding, but I suppose

                                     journey out?
None (PS18L)                         [1362] That's his journey right?
                                     [1363] Here, he's looking in ... how he

None (PS18L)                         [1367] There's one.

None (PS18J)                         [1371] Right.
None (PS18L)                         [1372] in, and the care-givers view
                                     looking out are in agreement [] .
                                     [1373] Right.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1374] What if they're not?
None (PS18J)                         [1375] What
None (PS18L)                         [1376] To a
None (PS18J)                         [1377] is the one that we're actually
                                     doing?
Unknown speaker (KBUPSUNK)           [1378] Yeah.
None (PS18H)                         [1379] That's right.
None (PS18L)                         [1380] [reading] To achieve this ...
                                     quality assurance should mean, that when
                                     the patient feels his care is not good ...
                                     he should know how he can complain without
                                     any worry that he will be penalized, and
                                     in the certainty that action will be taken
                                     immediately [] .
                                     [1381] And that's these things here.
                                     [1382] There's patient questionnaires,
                                     complaints, da da, er ... ba la ...
                                     visitor inspections, complaints, patient
                                     questionnaire, there's a ... basically all
                                     the same kind of thing, or relative
                                     survey.
                                     [1383] Patient questionnaire.
                                     [1384] So, basically, what they're saying
                                     there's all these things that they'll
                                     provide at each stage of his journey so
                                     that if care isn't right he knows what
                                     channels to go through to complain.
                                     [1385] My criticism of that being is
None (PS18L)                         [1386] But what if it's not carried out?
None (PS18L)                         [1387] it's, it's al the quality's not
                                     there to start with.
                                     [1388] How can you
None (PS18J)                         [1389] He da he won't know what, what
                                     quality of care is though.
None (PS18L)                         [1390] Well er, the patient has his views
                                     about what
None (PS18J)                         [1391] Yeah.
None (PS18L)                         [1392] he expects, good nursing care
None (PS18J)                         [1393] But his views aren't really gonna
                                     be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot
                                     of people wouldn't know
None (PS18L)                         [1394] No, everybody's individual.
                                     [1395] And to get, what it says here, to
                                     get quality assurance, the patient's
                                     views, and the care-giver's views have to
                                     be in agreement.
                                     [1396] What, say you're the care-giver and
                                     I'm the
None (PS18J)                         [1397] Yeah.
None (PS18L)                         [1398] patient ... what I think is good
                                     nursing care might not be what you think
                                     is good nursing care.
None (PS18J)                         [1399] But what you know is not gonna be
                                     the same.
None (PS18L)                         [1400] It has to be the same for quality
                                     assurance.
None (PS18J)                         [1401] But it's not gonna be the same.
None (PS18M)                         [1402] But that will
None (PS18L)                         [1403] Yeah cos you
None (PS18M)                         [1404] I tell you what I think
Denise (PS18E)                       [1405] It says on our research thing
None (PS18M)                         [1406] say that, say that erm ...

None (PS18L)                         [1408] Er, say yes to that one.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1409] [laugh] ... I shan't ask anything.
None (PS18M)                         [1410] But will it tell me the truth?
None (PS18H)                         [1411] Well, see, for one is she's not erm
                                     ... as bad as that.
                                     [1412] You know, some patients I could
                                     think of seem to have the idea that
                                     everything should be done for them in
                                     hospital
None (PS18L)                         [1413] Mm.
None (PS18H)                         [1414] and that to them is good care if a
                                     nurse does everything for them, but it's
                                     not.
                                     [1415] If, you're taking all [...]
None (PS18L)                         [1416] Yeah.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1417] Mm.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1418] And when he goes into
None (PS18H)                         [1419] Plus they also say that a nurse is
                                     always
None (PS18L)                         [...]
None (PS18H)                         [1420] busy ... and they're angels, and
                                     they're, that and the other, that they
                                     won't complain.
None (PS18L)                         [1421] Well that's the only way that this
                                     can be ... assessed, is by, so that the
                                     patient ... blah blah la ... [reading
                                     hospital form] when a patient feels his
                                     care is not good he knows he can complain
                                     without any worry [] .
                                     [1422] But complaining, I mean, if he's
                                     gotta complain it means that ... quality
                                     assurance isn't there.
None (PS18J)                         [1423] But
None (PS18L)                         [1424] This is only thing if they've got
                                     something to complain about.
None (PS18J)                         [1425] if you were the patient [...] nurse

None (PS18H)                         [1426] So there's nothing to actually say
None (PS18L)                         [1427] In a positive sense?
None (PS18H)                         [1428] Yeah.
None (PS18J)                         [1429] Yeah.
None (PS18L)                         [1430] The only thing that
None (PS18H)                         [1431] So if it
None (PS18L)                         [1432] says
None (PS18H)                         [1433] Yeah.
None (PS18L)                         [1434] erm ... [reading] meaning ha blah
                                     blah ... and action taken [] .
                                     [1435] It should also mean that when Mr ,
                                     that's it, says the nurses were
                                     marvellous, the nurses are able to say in
                                     all evidence, and with evidence to support
                                     their opinion, yes
Denise (PS18E)                       [1436] We were crap!
None (PS18L)                         [1437] we are really doing a pretty good
                                     job.
Denise (PS18E)                       [laugh]
None (PS18L)                         [1438] That's all it says in a positi from
                                     a positive angle.
None (PS18H)                         [1439] Yeah but
Unknown speaker (KBUPSUNK)           [1440] A pretty good job.
None (PS18L)                         [1441] [laughing] So what do you think []
                                     ?
None (PS18L)                         [laugh]
Denise (PS18E)                       [1442] But like, if you take like
Denise (PS18E)                       [laugh]
Denise (PS18E)                       [1443] like er,le let me, if you were the
                                     patient and Lesley was the nurse ... like,
                                     you wouldn't have a clue ... whether it
                                     was er
None (PS18H)                         [1444] Exactly.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1445] good or not, because as long as it
                                     was pretty clean.
None (PS18L)                         [1446] Let's have a look what examples
                                     they're using.
Unknown speaker (KBUPSUNK)           [cough]
None (PS18H)                         [1447] Well that's what I was trying to
                                     say, because all the patient doesn't know
                                     what to expect anyway.
None (PS18L)                         [1448] I mean, the patient wouldn't know
                                     whether it was like clean [...]
None (PS18L)                         [1449] Well these are the criteria leaves

                                     investigations, for example good

                                     itself.
                                     [1453] If you, if you were the patient you
                                     might say it's wrong because erm ... she
                                     doesn't look like she knows what she's

None (PS18L)                         [1461] And he might take a personal

None (PS18L)                         [1462] Yeah.

Unknown speaker (KBUPSUNK)           [1467] So ideally, er

                                     patients who say they don't get the care
                                     here ... and, on the surface it looks a
                                     brilliant hospital, it gets them in and
                                     out, you know, it does everything, it's
                                     got all the facilities ... but it doesn't

None (PS18L)                         [1482] it says, [reading] quality can only
                                     be assured if both patient's view and
                                     care-giver's view are in agreement [] cos
                                     that's gonna be really hard to achieve

Denise (PS18E)                       [1486] Yes, but quality doesn't just co
                                     erm, take into account the care that's

                                     like a triangular system's
None (PS18L)                         [1527] Mm.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1528] passed up a three tier system.
                                     [1529] And if the ideas are good ... then
                                     er incorporated ... into the care, they're

                                     [1530] But there's one ... one fault
                                     really it takes approximately fifteen to
                                     eighteen months for them to pass ...
                                     anything like that ... and that could be
                                     one
Denise (PS18E)                       [1531] Downfall.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1532] downfall, one criticism ... about
None (PS18M)                         [1533] Yeah, cos this one says it's
                                     immediate.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1534] Yeah.
                                     [1535] Well this one takes fifteen to
                                     eighteen months and that's ... to me
                                     that's just ... ridiculous really.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1536] And then, it would take another ...
                                     however to implement any changes that they
                                     decided upon.
None (PS18L)                         [1537] Basically they, they just provide

                                     and then pass it up.
                                     [1543] It's like
Unknown speaker (KBUPSUNK)           [1544] Yeah.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1545] being in parliament really, you
                                     have to pass everything up.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1546] Well the thing is though people at
                                     the top don't necessarily see the problems
                                     that you see as problems
Denise (PS18E)                       [1547] No they don't, no.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1548] as being problems do they?
Denise (PS18E)                       [1549] That's probably why it takes
                                     fifteen to eighteen months to get a a
                                     result.
None (PS18L)                         [1550] To get there.
None (PS18L)                         [1551] It's not gonna help the patient
                                     like, at the time, like, at the time if
                                     your patient complains, something will be
                                     done.
None (PS18J)                         [1552] What happens there and then?
None (PS18L)                         [1553] If your patient complained, like, I
                                     dunno

Unknown speaker (KBUPSUNK)           [1555] Gone out the window!
Denise (PS18E)                       [1556] Yeah!
Denise (PS18E)                       [1557] What if you've got a loved one?
None (PS18L)                         [1558] And, and we ... sort of no yours
                                     doesn't necessarily apply to some people
                                     to say, they might just think, oh it'll be

Denise (PS18E)                       [1559] I know.
None (PS18L)                         [1560] good idea to
Denise (PS18E)                       [1561] Just [...] what you think.
Group of unknown speakers (KBUPSUGP) [laugh]
Denise (PS18E)                       [1562] Yes, by the time it comes to
                                     getting round to your complaint you've
                                     moved on.
None (PS18L)                         [1563] Mm mm.
None (PS18M)                         [1564] It's unbelievable how many they
                                     [...] .
Denise (PS18E)                       [1565] So is that it basically?
Denise (PS18E)                       [1566] If you want to call an issue but
                                     ... I was on about setting up these
                                     committees ... to assess the standard of
                                     care.
None (PS18L)                         [1567] I've got a bit like that, and says
                                     the ... erm ... quality assurance systems
                                     will have to be different in each health
                                     district, with like being variations.
                                     [1568] But it says, it has identified key
                                     elements, and one of those elements is a
                                     Director of Quality Assurance should
Denise (PS18E)                       [1569] Yeah.
None (PS18L)                         [1570] be appointed with responsibility
                                     for setting up the district-wide
                                     programme.
                                     [1571] She would receive minutes of all
                                     meetings and have the right to attend
                                     these meetings to provide a quality
                                     assurance input.
                                     [1572] So that's the same
Denise (PS18E)                       [1573] And like I must have got the ... er
                                     the review board should be ... er ... six
                                     ... six requirements for these groups.
None (PS18L)                         [1574] Mm mm.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1575] They must voluntary to the whole
                                     [...] .
None (PS18L)                         [1576] Right.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1577] Erm, there must be more than six
                                     people.
                                     [1578] There must be a meeting once every
                                     three or four weeks for one and a half
                                     hours.
                                     [1579] And the meeting should be held in a
                                     place where it is possible to work in our
                                     situation.
                                     [1580] And a leader should be appointed.
None (PS18L)                         [1581] Yeah.
Denise (PS18E)                       [1582] Yeah, but even with all those
                                     things in their favour it still takes
                                     fifteen months?
Denise (PS18E)                       [1583] It still takes fifteen to eighteen
                                     months to deliver ... to pass
Denise (PS18E)                       [1584] But the leaders are nearly always
                                     someone ... like a Director of Nursing or
                                     somebody like that, who has no ... ward
                                     ... experience
None (PS18M)                         [1585] But you need somebody higher up
Denise (PS18E)                       [1586] on a day to day
None (PS18M)                         [1587] to be able to pass these bills
                                     doesn't it?
                                     [1588] To be able to pass the
None (PS18J)                         [1589] [...] , yeah, try to get them to
                                     pass it.
None (PS18M)                         [1590] Right.
None (PS18J)                         [1591] It cannot be [...] get background.
None (PS18M)                         [1592] Mhm.

None (PS18J)                         [1594] So, the major criticism for that is
                                     higher
None (PS18L)                         [1595] Is up
