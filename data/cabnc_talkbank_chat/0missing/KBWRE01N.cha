*PS087:	So people like except the children you mean . 
*PS08A:	No For everybody The vast majority of dentists have threatened to . 
*PS087:	Well how come when we 're paying so much Do you want . 
*PS08A:	Well because you 'd have to pay even more if you did it privately . 
*PS088:	My throat hurts .

*PS089:	And at the dentists . 
*PS087:	Yeah Well you do n't take your shoes off at the dentists . 
*PS089:	0 . 
*PS087:	He does n't look at your feet he only looks at your teeth He 'll get a shock when he sees your teeth wo n't he Four of them have changed since you last came . 
*PS089:	Is it today Is it today . 
*PS087:	Mhm . 
*PS089:	Oh It feels funny when she you do it Mum .

*PS089:	Is it are you going to be checked . 
*PS087:	Yes Mummy and daddy and you two We 're all going family trip . 
*PS088:	And me . 
*PS087:	Mhm . 
*PS089:	At the bed time . 
*PS087:	Yes and you . 
*PS089:	At bed time . 
*PS087:	No four o'clock it is . 
*PS088:	I 'm gon na look at my teeth . 
*PS089:	0 . 
*PS087:	It 's a little it 's a little ploy to get daddy home early . 
*PS089:	What . 
*PS088:	gon na look at my teeth . 
*PS087:	Daddy 'll have to come home a bit early to have it done . 
*PS088:	gon na look at my teeth . 
*PS087:	Yes Will you let him Yes Will you sit on the chair open your mouth let him stick a mirror in Aah . 
*PS088:	0 . 
*PS089:	Stick a mirror in We do n't . 
*PS087:	I seem to remember last time you got two stickers did n't you cos you had super clean teeth I bet you only get one sticker this time . 
*PS089:	Why . 
*PS088:	You think I 'm gon na get two . 
*PS087:	0 . 
*PS089:	You 'd have to clean them out very did that . 
*PS087:	I think you were a bit lucky to get two stickers I would have thought one sticker would be sufficient really . 
*PS089:	It was when Mrs was there then was n't it mummy . 
*PS087:	Was it . 
*PS089:	Mrs was there . 
*PS087:	Mm probably Mm . 
*PS089:	It was . 
*PS087:	Oh you went to school did n't you There was a dentist came to school remember And we had a letter home saying something about you need to go to the local dentist or something for treatment Poss no possible treatment And I think it was cos of the wobbly front tooth when you bent it back when you fell over my foot . 
*PS089:	But next time it wo n't . 
*PS087:	So we did n't bother going because we were regularly going anyway . 
*PS089:	What . 
*PS087:	0 . 
*PS089:	You did n't bother going cos we . 
*PS087:	No . 
*PS089:	were regularly going . 
*PS087:	Yeah Well I did n't see much point . 
*PS089:	What does regularly mean . 
*PS087:	Regularly means that we go in anyway t every six months you go and have your teeth checked to see if they 're okay . 
*PS089:	Every six . 
*PS087:	So just when some some bod comes to school and opens your mouth and says ooh this looks interesting there 's not much point because our own dentist knows about it . 
*PS089:	So you do n't really need to be checked at school . 
*PS087:	No I would n't have thought so But some people do n't go to the dentist regularly so they need to be checked at school People like Michelle probably never set eyes on a dentist normally It 's probably a good thing for a dentist to have a look at her teeth and see what needs doing . 
*PS089:	Because her mum and her mum does n't . 
*PS087:	Mm probably . 
*PS089:	They 've never been . 
*PS087:	Probably not . 
*PS089:	Why . 
*PS088:	We have . 
*PS087:	I 'm just guessing We 've been yeah But not everybody does Well not everybody likes dentists and they think that something . 
*PS088:	Well well we . 
*PS087:	awful 's gon na happen to them They 're wrong . 
*PS089:	What . 
*PS087:	cos it 's nice is n't it at the dentist . 
*PS088:	Think everyone goes . 
*PS089:	To the dentist . 
*PS087:	Well everybody ought to go to the dentist if they want to keep their teeth nice and healthy But not everybody does cos some people get frightened of dentists and they think ooh I do n't want to go there But that 's silly cos there 's nothing to be frightened of is there It 's nice at the dentist . 
*PS088:	No no-one can get frightened . 
*PS087:	Mm . 
*PS089:	But they wo n't get stickers will they . 
*PS087:	True . 
*PS088:	They wo n't get stickers dad .
