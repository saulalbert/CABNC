*AMY:	 (  ) no one 's heard any thing about it. 
*CLA:	 Well, I'm pretty su-   (.)  . 
*AMY:	 Maybe she hasn't told her best friend  that she was leaving. 
*CLA:	I'm pretty sure that Matthew Paynes is still there. 
*HEL:	Oh yes, I think so. 
*CLA:	I've seen him, and I don't know why Michelle's moving, without his brother. 
*AMY:	Michelle's, oh right, it's a different Michelle, no.

*HEL:	 ((laugh)) . By the way, they won't be coming to school any more, when from next term. 
*CLA:	No tomorrow.  ((laugh)) . It was a couple of days notice and they weren't to pleased about it. 
*AMY:	And I'm sure that spoon   (10.0) What I want is a   (  ) me Catherine and  (  ) , (  ) keep away from Matthew   (  ) we don't like him, his a mossy old boots. 
*HEL:	His bossy, his. 
*CLA:	His a terrible, so we didn't go near him right through on the playing field, and then Katherine, I found to get, I sat, found a way to get them near Matthew   (  ) and then Katherine said   ((whispering))  (  ) , I tickled him on the back, and I'd kept on doing that. (  ) . 
*AMY:	I don't think we need to make any more buns yet. 
*CLA:	Hm. 
*HEL:	No, I think that'll last you a little while. 
*CLA:	We'll make a cake though, like we do on Sunday. 
*HEL:	Alright. 
*CLA:	Yeah. 
*HEL:	Ok. 
*CLA:	What kind of cake, chocolate? 
*HEL:	Hm, if you want. 
*CLA:	I would like normal. 
*AMY:	Oh we always have normal. 
*CLA:	Erm, then, coffee. Oh I don't like chocolate. 
*HEL:	Don't you? 
*CLA:	Not as much as a normal or coffee. 
*HEL:	I've brought some stuff to make a lemon cheesecake, cos lemon's were reduced. 
*CLA:	Hm, I'll make that for you then  (  ) . 
*AMY:	Yes. A lemon cheesecake. I won't eat it but, any way. 
*CLA:	Don't you like it? 
*AMY:	I don't like it. 
*CLA:	Simply adore that one, chocolate bun, strawberry moose. Haven't made one of those for ages. 
*AMY:	No, I love strawberry moose, that's delicious. 
*CLA:	Then it first it's strawberry moose, then it's erm lemon cheesecake, then it's chocolate biscuit cake. 
*AMY:	Oh, I don't know my order, I don't. 
*CLA:	What d'you like best mummy? 
*HEL:	Oh I don't know. 
*CLA:	I'm not sure what I like best, I seem to like quite a bit. 
*HEL:	 A lemon cheesecake  , bun, strawberry moose. 
*CLA:	Hm. 
*HEL:	The trouble with strawberry moose is, it takes ages to make  doesn't it? 
*CLA:	 I like strawberry moose's  . 
*HEL:	Beat it for ten minutes, that's it seems an awfully long time to just stand there and. 
*CLA:	Oh. Can't you beat it with the erm. 
*HEL:	Hm, for ten minutes. 
*CLA:	I'll do that. It's worth it strawberry moose. 
*HEL:	Over the gas. 
*CLA:	Over the gas? 
*HEL:	Hm, you have to beat it in a pan of boiling water. 
*CLA:	What, just beat? 
*HEL:	The egg yolks and the strawberries and the sugar. 
*CLA:	Oh, there lovely mixture, to watching boiling water. 
*HEL:	Hm, trouble is it tends to come over the top of the bowl. ((cough)) . 
*CLA:	Ah. 
*HEL:	 ((cough)) . 
*CLA:	I didn't know you put them, glass on   (.) gas. 
*HEL:	No you don't, you put the saucepan with some water in it, you boil that and put the bowl mixture in   (.) in the saucepan. 
*CLA:	Oh right. 
*HEL:	Your just boiling water round the outside. 
*AMY:	Hm, yeah. 
*CLA:	What d'ya mean by put water on for boiling water? 
*AMY:	You put your pan with some boiling water in and then you put the bowl with all the stuff in on top. 
*CLA:	I  just thought  it was grass. 
*HEL:	 In the pan  . No, glass. 
*CLA:	Oh glass, I thought you said grass, (  ) . 
*AMY:	What happens if you put boiling water on glass? 
*HEL:	Nothing, depends what sort of glass it is. If you pour boiling water on ordinary glass it will probably crack. 
*CLA:	What, what's on there the glass  (  ) . 
*HEL:	Yes. If you fill a milk bottle with boiling water I would think it would crack, might do. 
*CLA:	And a cup? 
*HEL:	Pyrex is alright. 
*CLA:	What's Pyrex? 
*HEL:	That's my bowls are made off. 
*CLA:	Is that real glass or is it? 
*HEL:	I don't know what they do to it, but it's a stand the temperature much better. 
*CLA:	Is it still glass? 
*HEL:	Pyrex. It's glass of a sort, but I don't know what, I don't know what they do to make it much more heat resistant, you can put it in the oven. 
*CLA:	Can you? 
*HEL:	Oh yeah, that casserole tops Pyrex. 
*CLA:	Is it? I thought that was plastic. 
*HEL:	If that was plastic it would melt. 
*CLA:	No. 
*HEL:	In the oven. 
*CLA:	Well what you  put in the oven  ? 
*HEL:	 You can't stick it in the oven  that's plastic. Nothing! 
*CLA:	The oven is made of plastic. 
*HEL:	No it's not, it's made of glass and metal. 
*CLA:	Oh. 
*HEL:	It's not made of plastic. 
*CLA:	Oh Clare. 
*CLA:	Oh Amy, what. 
*AMY:	Oh don't really   (  ) Gemma. 
*HEL:	Oh she's ever so slow tonight. 
*CLA:	I don't want to  (  ) .

*HEL:	Leave it alone, put it down. 
*AMY:	Put it down there, it's very naughty of you to lift it up. ((laugh)) . 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) . Well what have you done to it? 
*AMY:	Nothing.

*CLA:	No we are not, we've been to Pelgrin's Way. 
*AMY:	No we haven't. 
*CLA:	Yes we have. 
*AMY:	The other one, Tunbridge Wells, that one. 
*HEL:	I think a lot depends on what the days like. 
*CLA:	 It's going to be a nice day isn't it? 
*HEL:	 Depends on what daddies doing  .
