*LYN:	He's quite a nice old dear really. 
*CHR:	Yes, his not a bad old stick, but erm, he's so very difficult to actually fathom isn't he? 
*LYN:	Yeah. 
*CHR:	Erm, I don't think his as thick as he cames across to me  sometimes  . 
*LYN:	 Did he  say his name's not William? 
*CHR:	Oh he said he prefers to be called Liam or something  (  ) . 
*LYN:	Oh what, without the wit  ((laugh)) . His initial is W. 
*CHR:	Yes, yes, he is William, erm,the  there are sixteen of the item outstanding on this order, eight required on this order and he says they haven't quite tested eight yet.  Some of the  have passed test but they haven't quite got to eight yet, so erm. 
*LYN:	  (  )  . That's the one that was due today. 
*CHR:	Yes, yes, erm, he said they may well have done sufficient of them by Monday. 
*LYN:	But it sounds as though everything  (  ) . 
*CHR:	He said the rest of it's on schedule. 
*LYN:	Ah  right  . 
*CHR:	 Yes  , his looked at it in the last couple of days, so he said within within another week or so he's having the whole done   (  ) with them. 
*LYN:	Good. 
*CHR:	Goody goody goody woof woof woof   (5.0) I can see exactly what this guy's means   (  ) about eh, huh, anything, anything in laboratories because the, the range of stuff in these magazines is phenomenal. 
*LYN:	Yeah. 
*CHR:	Absolutely incredible. So I think what'll do is contact one or two of British companies with probably way out stuff and just see if there set up in Japan.
