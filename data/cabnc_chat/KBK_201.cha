@Comment:	conversation #201 (Tape 002909)
*CHR:	They're busy little bees in here  •130827_130914•
*NOR:	The restaurant's nice. •131287_131370•
*CHR:	It is indeed. •131370_131490•
        When you've had a day in the open air you have a sort of •131910_132786•
*NOR:	Glow. •132786_132802•
*CHR:	glow. •132901_132912•
*NOR:	it really was chilly by the time I  •133364_133523•
*CHR:	Well I mean you can relax on that score because you had a very good half hour run with me. •133632_134047•
        She wasn't in frantic form but she was zipping hither and dither. •134219_134645•
*NOR:	She insisted on coming •134752_134859•
*CHR:	Galloped around the outside. •134859_135096•
        I was absolutely steaming by the time I got back to the car. •135096_135415•
*NOR:	It was very hot. •135532_135613•
        And the very erm  she was very anxious to come with me when I went out into the park. •135631_136335•
        To get me into the car so I let her come. •136377_136868•
*CHR:	Good. •136868_136895•
        To get the what? •136909_137010•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Oh yes. •137026_137168•
*NOR:	And she had to come in the car while I  •137168_137918•
*CHR:	There's a take away here. •138116_138219•
        a bag for somebody. •138379_138486•
*NOR:	A doggy bag. •138555_138698•
*CHR:	No. •138727_138735•
        A great big carrier bag you can't see it it's just outside. •138735_139037•
*NOR:	It all seems rather a shame really you know to do a take away . •139271_139960•
        I mean that rather a nice Chinese restaurant in the high street does take away. •140081_140486•
*CHR:	We had one last week. •140536_140605•
*NOR:	but if you're going to pay a lot of money for your take away •140986_141416•
*CHR:	I wonder if they charge the same prices for their take away as for sitting at the table. •141416_141893•
*NOR:	I think they really must. •141893_142065•
        My mother •142100_142149•
*CHR:	I know I know in the past I have er  ten percent or something. •142192_142783•
        But I may be going back far too long for the evening. •142851_143058•
*NOR:	Well you'd think they could because you are not paying for the service are you? •143079_144661•
*CHR:	That's right. •144690_144738•
        Yes I think I could become really absorbed in croquet. •144993_145310•
        I don't know if I'd become good at it but I think •145310_145481•
*NOR:	Why not? •145481_145498•
*CHR:	but I think it'd be a game that one could become absorbed in. •145498_145742•
        It's not physically demanding other than in stamina concentration terms. •145801_146261•
        It's hardly physically demanding is it? •146290_146756•
        And the course that David went on before he was asked to coach on it was for advanced people anyway . •146876_147496•
        And he said ah er I misunderstood this and er and I said well you know when is it? •147857_148402•
        Who knows may be I could baah aah aah. •148416_148807•
        And he said, er er. •148807_148924•
        Just possible that you  standard because he obviously seemed to think that I was that I had some great possible qualities but •148924_149926•
*NOR:	But? •150170_150217•
*CHR:	Well I would I, he would say you know you know you don't croquet that and it's a short bom bom and it's •150258_150861•
*NOR:	It's the first time you've done it. •150861_150992•
*CHR:	Oh!what does he mean by that? •151013_151441•
        And so on and so forth. •151441_•
*NOR:	But he must be quite good unusual to start by playing a whole game? •151557_152136•
*CHR:	Well I mean he showed me how er er he showed me how the mallet is operated. •152136_152564•
        There's no standard grip you •152644_152780•
*LYN:	Alright? •152780_152795•

*CHR:	Ah! •154120_154132•

*CHR:	Yes thank you. •154808_154888•
        I would be interested. •154952_155184•
*LYN:	except V A T. •155216_155424•
*CHR:	Yes. •155467_155487•
*LYN:	You can charge more   •155777_155947•
*CHR:	Well they're not receiving  excuse me the service and the pleasure of the table and the atmosphere. •156055_156633•
*LYN:	You see when you want to get home I charge more. •156647_157068•

        It always smells super. •158329_158510•
        Who is the tall thin chap sitting next to Diane? •158605_159026•
*NOR:	I don't know darling. •159026_159124•
        Probably their family or something  I don't know. •159124_160108•
*NOR:	Do you remember being here with ? •160108_161071•

*NOR:	 (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	Oh is that what it's called? •162970_163071•

*NOR:	Quite pricey actually •170809_170884•
*CHR:	Yes well it was pricey. •170916_171073•
        But then you're paying for the use of the boat as well aren't you? •171073_171332•
*NOR:	Yes but then when I came here with you. •171332_171545•
        The meal was thirteen pounds ten •171560_171920•
*CHR:	Right. •171920_171932•
*NOR:	plus the wine. •171946_172085•

        Nearly two years ago. •172885_173080•
        Erm she said  six months ahead. •173080_173611•
*CHR:	Oh really? •173654_173673•
*NOR:	She said when you came and I rang to confirm it all she said you're very lucky because he agreed thirteen pounds and we don't do it for under fifteen pounds now. •173673_174754•
*CHR:	Really? •174792_174823•
*NOR:	And I said oh dear! •174957_175035•

*NOR:	because they weren't, were they? •175447_175668•
*CHR:	No. •175668_175684•
        No. •175684_175693•

        They were not they were honest. •175781_175956•
        They were honest and straightforward and jolly good stuff. •175965_176486•
*NOR:	It was really thanks to Linda and Graham because I never would have done it otherwise. •176486_177359•
*CHR:	No. •177366_177404•
        You learn about these things in different ways don't you? it's all very •177527_177875•
*NOR:	I think Linda and Graham were the only people there who had been before have any other common •177875_178557•
*CHR:	Quite probably. •178557_178622•
        The only local people in Essex probably. •178625_178800•
