*DOR:	It was when you were playing with it with your fingers, do you remember? Anyway it won't matter. We can use some pliers or something to   (.) bend it back. (.)

*DOR:	 For   (.) for the chilly days.  Well in the summer you won't need jumpers will you like this? 
*CHR:	No. 
*DOR:	Hopefully. If we have a good summer. Mind you in the evening, if it gets quite chilly in the evenings so it might be a good jumper to wear in the evenings when we go for our   (.) evening walks by the sea. Oh what a lovely thought daddy. 
*TIM:	 ((singing))  (  ) 
*DOR:	Next time we go to the sea.  (  ) Oh it's the clip. He's been playing with it, he's bent it out so it  (  ) . It's on at the moment though.  (.)  (  ) I tried doing it with my fingers but  (  )

*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Why? 
*CHR:	 ((whispering))  (  ) 
*DOR:	Oh I see. Oh right. 
*TIM:	Biscuits. 
*DOR:	No no. Nothing to do with biscuits. 
*AND:	Right.  We'll have to go   
*CHR:	 Nothing to do with biscuits. 
*AND:	do we need to go upstairs first? 
*DOR:	Er, I think we should. (.)  
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Come on. (.)  
*TIM:	 ((laugh)) Chips.

*AND:	Good. 
*GRO:	 (  )

*DOR:	Oh well I saw that on Friday. In fact yesterday we said I wonder if he's got a new car or   (.) whether he's got visitors.

*AND:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	It's J reg is it? 
*TIM:	 ((singing+shouting))  (  ) 
*DOR:	I I I I told you to. 
*TIM:	 ((singing+shouting))  (  ) 
*DOR:	Will it fit in the garage? (.)  
*AND:	It's a bit bigger than our   (  ) ford escort. 
*TIM:	It won't mummy. I don't think it will. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	If it doesn't mum   (.) anyway it wouldn't fit in the garage because there's another car in there. 
*DOR:	Oh that's a point. That's a bit tricky. Well we think that that might be a new car. 
*AND:	Yeah, we think it's    (  )   
*TIM:	  ((shouting))  (  )  .  (  ) cos we're nearly there. 
*DOR:	 ((laughing)) We're not nearly there. We haven't even started . (.)  
*TIM:	Nearly there.  (.) Got to  be quick. 
*AND:	  (  )  did you actually go to sleep mummy?

*AND:	Did you? (  )   
*DOR:	 I was  absolutely whacked out. 
*AND:	You've done very well  (  ) . 
*DOR:	Well I haven't. You've done all the meals. ((laugh))  
*CHR:	Dad, could you walk it to MacDonalds? 
*AND:	Well you could. It would be a little bit far for us. But we could if we needed to. 
*DOR:	Wouldn't be too bad cos you'd go down by the Jolly Farmer. 
*AND:	Yeah. 
*DOR:	You'd have to walk like Gemma walks to school wouldn't you? 
*CHR:	Mm. 
*AND:	Where does Gemma live? 
*DOR:	Gemma lives   (.) Oakenshaw  
*CHR:	Yeah, near MacDonalds. Near MacDonalds dad. She lives right near MacDonalds doesn't she? 
*DOR:	She does actually.  ((laugh)) Wonder if she goes to MacDonalds every night for her tea? 
*CHR:	No.  (.) But she could walk it from her house couldn't she? 
*DOR:	She could. (.)  
*CHR:	Because it's not far. Yeah all she has to do is go   (.) go round her bit   (.) round just a normal road, across the road   (.) down a little bit   (.) and she's there. 
*DOR:	Mm. 
*CHR:	It's not very far daddy, is it daddy? A teeny   (  ) bit. It's only round the corner   (.) from her isn't it mum?  (.) It's only  (  ) . (  )   
*TIM:	  ((cough))  I found it   (.) over here.

*DOR:	Oh it looks crowded. Perhaps there's a party. (.)  
*TIM:	It's not a party. (.)  
*CHR:	Perhaps there's only one person in each car at MacDonalds. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) That's true. I can't think that one person in a car on their own would want to go to MacDonalds too often. (.)  
*CHR:	Like a mum or a dad or   (  )  (.)  
*DOR:	Everybody must have thought what a dismal day this is.
