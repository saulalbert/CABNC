*PS0YX:	that 's right it 's just on the end .  1256435_1259395
*PS03S:	that 's it now here 's your steel bit that 's split .  1259395_1262105
*PS0YX:	yes .  1262115_1262125

*PS0YX:	yes .  1283435_1283575
*PS03S:	and the idea is so you you push it down to earth you want it down to there .  1283575_1288895
*PS0YX:	in other words you can move it up and down aargh .  1288895_1291985
