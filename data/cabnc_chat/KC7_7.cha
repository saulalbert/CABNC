*GIL:	No I know what you mean. •149147_149356•
        I've never really found it that much of an insult ever anyway, but I just think that it's a bit of a term which doesn't really apply to us. •149486_150076•
        Do you know what I mean? •150144_150201•
        We've got hippyish tendencies but we're not hippies. •150201_150421•
*JEM:	Well also I mean the term hippy I mean it's not really a real term I don't think. •150486_150764•
        Shall I put a bit more, do you reckon that's enough  that's okay that little bit of sauce innit? •150764_151188•
        Do you reckon there's enough there? •151188_151358•
*GIL:	Is Nancy eating? •151410_151482•
*JEM:	Yeah. •151504_151530•
*GIL:	Er er er er er well what else could you put in that would make it more  •151572_151889•
*JEM:	More more tomatoes and more tuna. •151889_152026•
*GIL:	I might, I would maybe think it might be worth making a little bit more actually. •152068_152399•
*JEM:	Right. •152407_152427•
        Shove it all in. •152453_152496•
        Do you wanna chop,mush that up a bit? •152529_152644•
*GIL:	Okay. •152718_152740•
        But then I'm pretty shit at measurements and stuff  cook the dinner  •153060_153328•
*JEM:	Well what's left I can have tomorrow. •153328_153465•
        Erm in that case  are these, this stuff here  is it yours? •153523_154521•
*GIL:	What stuff? •154552_154608•
*JEM:	This stuff. •154624_154674•
*GIL:	No. •154736_154777•
        It might be Frank's or someone's. •154777_155044•
*JEM:	I reckon it is. •155075_155138•
        Or  •155188_155206•
*GIL:	Oh she won't mind you using it anyway. •155248_155418•
        She's got so much tuna she could bloody start an aquarium up. •155536_155803•
*JEM:	tuna  •155982_155994•
*GIL:	Mind you, they're all dead so it wouldn't be a very active aquarium really would it? •156124_156497•
        Think the pasta's done. •156718_156965•
*JEM:	Right do you wanna  turn it off then. •156965_157247•
*GIL:	Do you wanna taste it to check cos I might've got it wrong? •157247_157563•
        No I think it's done actually, what am I talking about, I have got a brain. •157598_157890•
        I can make decisions. •157925_158031•
        I'm a graduate. •158095_158154•
*JEM:	Another thing I I've realized recently right, I, I have a brain, I can make decisions, I have an opinion  •158154_158528•
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	that can be valued by people. •158528_158660•
*GIL:	I've always valued your opinion. •158796_159050•
*JEM:	Yeah I know you have but   anyone else has. •159074_159489•
*GIL:	Do you mean straight? •159497_159562•
*JEM:	Yeah, yeah basically. •159572_159681•
*GIL:	You know I'd never really valued the  the erm  the truth in that term, straight heads do definitely think very differently. •159853_160687•
        Andy's a real mate he  just kept saying straight heads  er for all the times when I might have said  oh, I couldn't really talk to some people last night and he'd say what you mean straight heads?he's right. •160807_161924•
        Totally different wavelength man. •162166_162338•
*JEM:	It's not just, I don't, well I I don't think it's  •162338_162638•
*GIL:	No it's not just straight heads but like quite a lot of the time it is straight heads. •162640_162927•
*JEM:	I think the thing is  people who are very straight aren't likely to  people who are like very  limited in their their way of thinking. •162949_163736•
*GIL:	Probably maybe a bit of a chicken and egg situation and the egg might have come before the chicken? •163774_164095•
*JEM:	Yeah. •164095_164130•
*GIL:	Yeah. •164169_164200•
        Funny way of putting it. •164327_164423•
        Deep in my heart  safe from the guards   •164574_165228•
*JEM:	Is there lots of space at the table? •165331_167188•
*GIL:	Er I can make some space, is it nearly dinner time? •167222_167831•
*JEM:	Yeah. •167878_167904•
*GIL:	I'll open the wine then. •167995_168087•
*JEM:	Let the wine breathe. •168379_168492•
        It's really funny right erm  in the office today this guy Paddy  got a er an, an invitation, like a formal invitation to erm a posh do •168672_170268•
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	and erm he, he was trying to work out how, how to write the reply correctly. •170431_170770•
        And he asked this girl er •170841_170980•
*GIL:	Can you say that again, sorry? •170990_171117•
*JEM:	This guy Paddy in the office •171117_171317•
*GIL:	Yeah? •171320_171331•
*JEM:	he had an invitation to a posh do, you know a black tie type of thing? •171343_171741•
*GIL:	Yeah. •171758_171800•
*JEM:	A a formal  invitation •171800_171862•
*GIL:	Yeah. •171997_172024•
*JEM:	and he wasn't sure like how, what was the correct way  to reply to it, right? •172044_172504•
*GIL:	Yeah. •172513_172539•
*JEM:	And so he asked this girl Jane and, and then he asked me  and erm and er had I sat down and thought about it I could have said well er what I thought, you know, the correct way er but I thought well  there's correct and there's correct and I think the right way is to write to it and to say yes thanks   •172539_174168•
*GIL:	No there is actually a very formal way of doing it though isn't there? •174171_174413•
        There's, I see what you mean, there's correct and correct. •174413_174578•
*JEM:	Oh yeah, yeah but I, I but I just thought  so I, so I,so I, so I said to him  well I, if it was me I'd just write back and say thanks, yes I'll come actually, thank you very much  •174578_175234•
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	cos I thought what you talk about is such a load of bollocks and he looked at me madly, and I thought oh how funny, I thought . •175236_175793•
        I'm gonna have to start explaining myself to people a bit more actually •175849_176105•
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	cos they get very, they misunderstand me. •176105_176441•
*GIL:	Yeah but I mean, it doesn't really matter if they misunderstand you does it? •176441_176727•
        But I mean I know what you mean. •176750_176895•
        I  a lot, cos I remember erm  when Claire was  I got a really formal invitation to something  and I asked Claire how you were supposed to reply  and she told me the exact wording of how you should reply and I just looked at her  I looked at her and I said I'm not bloody writing that. •176895_178642•
        Cos it sounded so stiff and so er •178817_179102•
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Cheers, lovely  •179120_179188•
*JEM:	alright? •179188_179240•
*NAN:	Oh dear   •179367_179407•
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	Good job     •179419_179492•
*JEM:	I mean the whole point of it is right is it doesn't make any difference how you reply to an invitation. •179892_180485•
*GIL:	Well I know, I mean especially if you know the people, what's the point of being formal if you know the people? •180485_180989•
*JEM:	Exactly. •180992_181019•
*GIL:	It's so ridiculous. •181108_181209•
*JEM:	with, with posh people, if if they were being pissed off by the fact that you didn't reply to the invitation properly then he's a dickhead. •181407_181907•
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	people. •182011_182023•
*GIL:	Did you even try? •182452_182550•
        Did you even try to get it out or did you just think oh well? •182684_186618•
*NAN:	 (        )  (.)  ((music))
*GIL:	Oh what! •186618_186794•
        That wasn't doing what I was asking it to do. •186869_187106•
        I wanted it to forward wind, I think I pressed the wrong button. •187106_187494•
        I've got  I did have the other one, Crossroads, but the reason why I had it was because Dave was in the house and he had it. •187634_188286•
*NAN:	Right, right, yeah. •188397_188484•
*GIL:	And then he fucked off and left me and he didn't give me  I this, it really pisses me off the way that people like leave before you get round to taping the tapes that you liked, do you know what I mean? •188484_189378•
        D'ya know what I mean ? •189400_189527•

*NAN:	and they put it in the sinks and  baths  all round the hall •238431_238731•

*NAN:	No they didn't turn the taps on, they just left it all round the hall and, and the door frame had been kicked off and all things like this you know? •238880_239375•
*GIL:	Oh dear. •239375_239495•
        Did they get caught? •239495_239564•
*NAN:	Well the people that done it didn't get caught but  the corridor on which it happened was fined for all the equipment. •239631_240482•
*JEM:	Oh! •240482_240491•
*NAN:	A lot of money. •240491_240585•

*NAN:	Yeah. •240922_240936•
*GIL:	Only they, they, they must be mad with them. •240936_241162•
*NAN:	Yeah. •241246_241255•
        They're obviously not gonna say anything but they are very mad. •241256_241705•
*GIL:	They should get them to pay for it. •241705_241801•
*NAN:	I know. •241801_241819•
        Well I think they are going to, the people that did it tt are gonna pay for it er anonymously •241834_242240•
*GIL:	Yeah. •242349_242385•
*NAN:	via the er  hall inhabitants, you know, that cannot afford it. •242385_242741•
*GIL:	Yeah. •242744_242752•
        So at least they won't get done for it cos they'd probably go up to disciplinary and stuff wouldn't they? •242752_243187•
*NAN:	that on? •243187_243240•
*JEM:	Mm. •243299_243330•
*GIL:	Erm  lordy lordy. •243704_243788•
        I remember that we, we had erm a corridor fine in our hall  for er just something stupid like they  one of the ceiling tiles got broken or something. •243788_244917•
        But we did you have to pay a deposit? •244917_245077•
        It came out of our deposit. •245265_245368•
*NAN:	we did, fifty pounds. •245368_245522•
*GIL:	Mm. •245522_245542•
*NAN:	That's true. •245543_245713•
        I should get that back shouldn't I? •245717_245838•
*GIL:	Yeah. •246101_246129•
*NAN:	Mm there's no reason why I shouldn't get that deposit back. •246163_246453•
*GIL:	No. •246499_246525•
*NAN:	Because last   •246525_246554•
*GIL:	And that's why they've mentioned it isn't it? •246554_246692•
*NAN:	Yeah. •246749_246762•
*GIL:	Cos with us getting it back was automatic. •246762_246912•
        I think  you were in a shitty hall Nance . •246912_247112•
*NAN:	I know. •247112_247318•
*GIL:	What, what happened about your posters? •247318_247448•
        They just walked in and saw that you had posters up and •247448_247650•
*NAN:	Yeah the cleaners, you know the cleaners have got a key to your room and that  and you   •247650_248073•
*GIL:	What cos you'd used Blu Tak or something? •248073_248248•
*NAN:	Yeah. •248255_248258•
        Oh basically you weren't allowed anything up on any wall. •248281_248453•
*JEM:	Well we weren't supposed to have posters up in our hall either. •248453_248715•
*GIL:	Really! •248715_248724•
*JEM:	Mm. •248847_248883•
*NAN:	And erm every time the cleaners came round on a Tuesday  it's not er everything had to be on the bed, including chairs er everything, you know, you had to have your desk   •248883_249791•
*GIL:	My cleaner used to come in and I'd be in bed . •249827_249977•
        And she used to clean round me and stuff. •250034_250196•
*NAN:	Cos our cleaners won't clean if it's erm  occupied or  not everything is cleaned from the floor  they won't change the bed sheets unless you've actually taken them off and   •250196_251188•
*GIL:	We're, oh no we didn't, they didn't do that for us either. •251189_251399•
*JEM:	Well we we had that. •251399_251548•
        We had to erm  like have, you wouldn't, you wouldn't  •251548_251773•
*GIL:	No   •251776_251790•
*JEM:	wouldn't get bed sheets unless they were actually stripped off the bed, things like that. •251791_252023•
*NAN:	Mm. •252044_252059•
*GIL:	But I, I, me and Claire, by the time we left U H, had a store of bed sheets to bring to our new house. •252059_252654•
        Just because like they'd leave them for us and we hadn't changed them. •252654_253045•
        And we'd just shove them on, under the bed and stuff. •253045_253212•
        I had thousands, I mean I gave a load back cos I had loads of them. •253212_253530•
        And the reason why  they were shoved under the bed was because  I hadn't got round to sort of you know, doing anything about it sort of thing. •253530_254046•
*JEM:	Mm. •254046_254057•
        Mm. •254057_254068•
*GIL:	But I mean my cleaner used to come in and just sort of like  clean around me and chat a bit. •254102_254465•
        Dave's cleaner in High Hall used to do loads of stuff for him, she used to wash his mugs up and all sorts of things. •254741_255300•
*NAN:	Mm. •255362_255368•
        Mm. •255368_255378•
        They do in the self catering flats. •255378_255594•
        But erm  •255594_255734•
*GIL:	I'm gonna try a bit of your bread. •255735_255871•
*NAN:	they're really funny and finicky about a lot of things, you know? •255872_256394•
        It does my head in. •256473_256565•
        And basically they and the other thing, right, I found out what they had for dinner the other night right? •256565_256905•
        We had jacket potatoes right, which is literally mouldy and baked hard so you'd get about  out of a jacket potato you'd probably get about that much potato and the rest is just skin and mould and hardness  quiche which is just like processed cheese and processed eggs and everything you can imagine just total packet mix •257159_258957•
*GIL:	Mm. •258957_258963•
*NAN:	it tastes like blancmange rather than quiche •258963_259291•
*JEM:	Mm. •259291_259317•
*NAN:	and erm  salad which is just like  brown lettuce. •259317_259822•
        And and I was paying eighteen pounds a week to be catered for. •259822_260265•
*GIL:	why doesn't someone do anything about it? •260268_260493•
*NAN:	Apparently   •260732_260749•
*GIL:	Like take it to N U S or something. •260749_260894•
*JEM:	Yeah. •260952_260977•
*GIL:	Because that is just a pile of shit  •260977_261098•
*NAN:	We're not even  •261099_261127•
*GIL:	they're ripping everybody off in that hall. •261128_261267•
*NAN:	we're not even in it, we've de-affiliated from erm •261268_261436•
*GIL:	Oh that's, that's why it's in that, basically that's why •261436_261726•
*NAN:	Oh •261726_261729•
*GIL:	people, that's why erm N U S is there to protect man. •261816_262130•
*NAN:	And nobody  Handsworth is  in a funny neck of the woods basically, it's like off campus, it's university accommodation •262130_262897•
*GIL:	Miles away. •262925_262992•
*NAN:	miles away, off campus, you know, they haven't got to make it look good  •262992_263246•
*JEM:	So you haven't got, you haven't got any any back up kind of from the  •263246_263447•
*NAN:	No  •263447_263463•
*JEM:	campus, the whole campus feeling I guess is   •263463_263653•
*NAN:	Yeah, yeah. •263685_263778•
*JEM:	Mm. •263889_263895•
*NAN:	It is, it's sort of like  it's sort of like extradited from the rest of the er  the rest of the whole university, you know, nobody really cares about what goes on at Handsworth. •263895_264877•
        But it's like wherever I, you know, if you get   a halls of residence on campus you would get put in Handsworth, like if you chuck a telly out of the, like one   •265094_265826•
*GIL:	It's like a prison isn't it ? •265894_265984•
*NAN:	Yeah. •265984_266007•
        It's like, you know  •266081_266297•
*GIL:	Or a rehabilitation centre. •266297_266423•
*NAN:	Yeah. •266430_266456•
        But it hasn't got anything going for it, basically, whatsoever •266465_266763•
*GIL:	Mm. •266765_266771•
*NAN:	it's got  three TVs though which are really rubbish and one small bar called The Bin, Village Inn it's called, and it is absolutely tiny, and really crap. •266771_267675•
*GIL:	Mm. •267734_267770•
*NAN:	Very expensive as well. •267803_267862•
        It's more expensive than on campus, I mean we haven't got a pub there, we haven't got  like the Guild bars or anything like that. •267902_268569•
*GIL:	It's worse than being on Griffin Close. •268569_268688•
*NAN:	Because there's no erm, there's no  like for freshers there wasn't any sort of entertainments during freshers' week on at Handsworth, it was all at campus. •268688_269488•
*GIL:	Mm. •269488_269501•
        So how, how do you get in to campus then? •269704_269874•
        Do you, is there one bus that goes all the way in? •269874_270065•
*NAN:	One bus the sixteen, but it's like  twenty minutes  it's like catching the bus from Moseley erm Village •270065_270724•
*GIL:	Yeah. •270724_270733•
*NAN:	from here. •270733_270794•
        You have to walk that far like to get the bus and then get in and then walk back home, it's not too far. •270794_271270•
*GIL:	But do they erm  provide a minibus service •271270_271526•
*NAN:	No, no there's no  •271526_271588•
*GIL:	to get back? •271588_271633•
*NAN:	no minibus service at all erm at any time of the day or night and they erm •271633_272149•
*GIL:	Cos we used to have like this minibus service back from the Guild •272149_272415•
*NAN:	Mm. •272441_272456•
*GIL:	even if you weren't in hall, and like girls used to get priority. •272477_272770•
*JEM:	Mm. •272919_272927•
*GIL:	You could hire out free rape alarms and all that kind of stuff. •272927_273238•
*JEM:	yeah you hand your railcard over and get   •273238_273395•
*GIL:	Yeah, free rape alarm. •273395_273538•
        That is just so shit but a lot of that is to do with the is the whole of Aston disaffiliated from the Guild, from the N U S? •273538_273982•
*NAN:	The whole university is. •274096_274174•
*GIL:	When did they do that? •274174_274267•
        Do you know? •274267_274413•
*NAN:	Last year I think, •274466_274516•
*GIL:	That is just I just don't understand why universities do that, it's so fucking stupid. •274516_274826•
        Cos that means that you can't get things like  •274826_274972•
*NAN:	apparently I was talking to like, cos you know a lot of my lecturers   •274972_275171•
*GIL:	erm like student cards and stuff cos that was all  •275171_275357•
*NAN:	Mm I know. •275357_275381•
*GIL:	no you can, but all student cards and stuff are all negotiated by N U S. •275388_275745•
*NAN:	I know. •275795_275808•
        And the N U S, you know  it is, in a way it is a good thing but in a way it isn't because when they were when they actually belonged to the N U S erm  they weren't because it's a small university, they weren't getting much funding from the US er the N U S or erm any support really. •275808_277381•
        I mean it's just like  Aston is, it is, is, it's, it's a university but it hasn't been a university for that long, it was a technological institute before  •277465_278190•
*GIL:	Mm. •278190_278197•
*NAN:	it's only been a university now for about  sort of ten well not even that, five or ten years I think. •278198_278773•
*GIL:	Mm. •278792_278800•
*NAN:	And before it was sort of like the it was mainly erm sort of post graduate er sort of training centre  for sort of science erm science graduates  •278800_279713•
*GIL:	Yeah. •279730_279742•
*NAN:	and things like that and it only, it's only become  and really it's only actually set up as a business school  quite recently as well, I mean what in the past ten years or something  •279742_280679•
*GIL:	Mm. •280679_280688•
*NAN:	as well. •280688_•
        Erm my course has only been running for three years. •280735_281145•
        I don't think they've actually had any graduates from my  •281146_281318•
*GIL:	No. •281318_281334•
*NAN:	course yet either. •281334_281535•
*GIL:	Why? •281535_281542•
*NAN:	Cos it's only been running for three years  •281543_281641•
*GIL:	Oh of course it's a four year course. •281641_281762•
*NAN:	four year course. •281762_282028•
*GIL:	So they don't really know how it runs do they? •282028_282279•
*NAN:	No. •282279_282290•
        They don't know how it's gonna work. •282291_282399•
        I mean it  I mean er the reason why it was set up really was the nineteen ninety two sort of like coming into the single European market and everything  •282404_283007•
*GIL:	Yeah. •283008_283009•
*NAN:	that's what gave them the sort of, the idea to set it up but  I mean Aston is good because  now we're   now we're not •283015_mute•
