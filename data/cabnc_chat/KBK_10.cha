@Comment:	conversation #10 (Tape 002010)
*LYN:	Doesn't it make you feel funny to have  (        ) 
*NOR:	Erm therefore it doesn't really  (        ) .I mean therefore she doesn't pass.So there is some judgement and skill involved.And I think her judgement is impaired by the fact she feels nervous.And is anxious not to overdo it and   (        ) cos that's another where you fail again.
*LYN:	Yes, unless somebody  (        ) 
*NOR:	 (        ) bad enough.But he wouldn't be letting you use your time if you were that poor at it because they do build you up very slowly. (        ) over two years she's been doing it.
*CHR:	Well.
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*NOR:	Well hopefully, she's got another class on Monday.She likes her tutor. (        ) 
*LYN:	Well I'd be happy to give you the name of the particular one but I don't know whether it applies to the young. (        ) they usually want to know the colour of your eyes and that sort of thing  (        ) .
*NOR:	Well I only, I've bought odd things in the past and never actually been asked anything specific.
*LYN:	I'll ask June.It may not apply to anything but I know in the past when she's   (.) given me those things to try   (        ) erm she's got a book at home and it'll say   (.) erm particular  (.) 
*LYN:	 (        ) a decent homeopathic shop they prescribe  (        ) .
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	She, she uses homeopathic treatment  (        ) .She went to the er   (.) College of Veterinary Surgeons yest Wednesday   (.) with her latest dog because she's not jumping.You know she just got   (        ) bigger dog.And she's had it some time now but the whole purpose was to   (.) so that she could train this one because   (.) the first one now is too old, the second one has   (        ) and can't.And the second was a sort of  (        ) .The third one has hip displacement.The fourth one   (        ) and Jim wanted one  (        ) .And she's had hip displacement.
*NOR:	Again?
*LYN:	Yes.So she can't, so she has five dogs she can't train.
*CHR:	Good god.
*LYN:	And she   (        ) tablet   (        ) today.But that will be a bit of a   (        ) 
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	I hope it means she doesn't buy any more dogs  (        ) .I I fear the opposite.
*LYN:	Well the one thing she can't do now is breed from her.So she has to have her spayed.I didn't know she planned to breed from her but er   (.) she must  (        ) .But it means she has five dogs to look after and
*NOR:	Has she not passed dogs on or? (.) They're more like children than dogs  (        ) .
*LYN:	Oh yes.Yes, more like, more like children than children to her actually.Erm the only thing that occurred to me I just wondered if she knew somebody who had a dearly loved dog that, didn't want to train it but you know she could perhaps just take along   (.) for the joy of running it and training it but I think part of the pleasure is the reflected glory you know it's my dog
*NOR:	Well it's  (        ) 
*LYN:	Yes.So I don't   (        ) 
*NOR:	Our erm department head at school has a beautiful collie.And they felt he was bored at home because they're out quite a lot
*LYN:	Mm.
*NOR:	and although he's well trained and they   (.) exercise him.They felt he was bored so they took him to training classes and Tricia said he's an absolute natural.He goes up through the hoops along the narrow, she said the first day when all the others were standing there shaking at the narrow bath he was just over it and down and   (.) she said you've never seen him   (        ) 
*LYN:	I mean they do it and thoroughly enjoy it.All of them do that er
*NOR:	They're not showing theirs or using it for any other purpose just for the dog's benefit.
*LYN:	Yes.For enjoyment   (        ) 
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	She doesn't show them as such it's all agility and er obediency and so on.And the dogs do, they wouldn't do it otherwise I suppose. ((phone rings))
*CHR:	Good afternoon, good morning I mean  (.) 
*CHR:	Pretty   (        ) order.Phone call from Singapore. (.) Do you want to keep that list of the jazz
*LYN:	Yes  (        ) 
*CHR:	because I've got the similar, similar thing in small format here. (.) 
*LYN:	I was just trying to remember whether they did Joan's do at the   (        ) last year. (        ) . But I've got a feeling they didn't.No they, they didn't because the   (.) that's right because it was cancelled last year it was the year before she did  (        ) .But I thought they were perfectly acceptable and surprised in a way that so many people commented adversely on them.Because they don't make a bad noise.
*CHR:	I think it's people who don't like trad jazz Lynda.
*LYN:	That's right.
*CHR:	I think that's all, all you can say.
*LYN:	Erm we are, there should be another order from Descar ready today.
*CHR:	Oh.
*LYN:	Mm.One.
*CHR:	Are you going to ring  (        ) ?
*LYN:	I just  (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes.
*LYN:	Erm.The other thing I'm wondering whether I should do the Petroline order which in fact flew on its first leg to Rome yesterday.
*CHR:	Yes.
*LYN:	It's only worth about a hundred pounds.We haven't insured it at all yet erm   (        ) arrange that anyway.
*CHR:	Mm.
*LYN:	But   (        ) might not be the best thing because   (.) if for any reason   (.) the buyer says that they didn't   (        ) they're not going to pay  (        ) 
*CHR:	I I I think we've got to accept that that on that business we have, we have, do not have secure terms period.
*LYN:	Right but should we insure it fully?
*CHR:	Not fully.But contingency.
*LYN:	Contingency is, I thought was just sort of between here and the airport
*CHR:	Oh no.
*LYN:	until it left the country.
*CHR:	No.No no no 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	That is what it is for.That is what it is.Contingency is if the customer having, the buyer having said he will cover the insurance, doesn't
*LYN:	Mm.
*CHR:	and then   (.) doesn't get his money, doesn't pay us
*LYN:	Right.
*CHR:	we can claim.
*LYN:	But if it was lost we could still claim?We could claim, he couldn't but we could.
*CHR:	Yes.
*LYN:	Fine, O K.
*CHR:	Yes.We will probably have to prove that we have not been paid for the consignment.
*LYN:	Interesting.
*CHR:	Interesting possibility.But it, it, it's not covering from factory to airport or anything of that sort.It is definitely covering
*LYN:	Right covering part of the risk.
*CHR:	Yes.
*LYN:	But not the  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes.Because we we can only take it on their word when they say we shall insure.I mean we should be doing it for  shouldn't we?
*LYN:	I do do it for .
*CHR:	Do you?Right.O K. (.) Ah. (.) 
*LYN:	 (        ) contingency only  (        ) . (.) 
*CHR:	I suppose it   (.) it doesn't matter very much one way or the other does it?
*LYN:	What to them   (        ) cheaper?
*CHR:	Cheaper to us, erm the trouble with it is of course we never actually add it in.Do we?
*LYN:	Yes   (        ) costs I do.
*CHR:	Do you?
*LYN:	Oh yes.
*CHR:	You you bung it across to the customer?
*LYN:	Ah.I do if it's a C I N contract when I'm
*CHR:	Well if it's a C I N contract you aren't you're not contingency.
*LYN:	No.If it's contingency, no I don't.
*CHR:	No.
*LYN:	But it's usually  (        ) .
*CHR:	It is a small sum yes that's quite true.Great.
*LYN:	I do add it into the costs if it's  (        ) 
*CHR:	Ah.Yes.
*LYN:	 (        ) don't know do they?
*CHR:	No that's true.That's quite true.Now er Richard rang me at five o'clock yesterday.
*LYN:	That's an old fashioned half an hour.
*CHR:	Yes.He did say that he'd tried to ring before I got back from lunch but I'm not one hundred percent certain.Erm but it wasn't, it was twenty past two when I got back from lunch.Erm and the erm   (.) I saw John at lunchtime and I mentioned it to him because he, he said that, it hadn't even occurred to me till then, because he said I'm concentrating on the surveying side and I thought ha ha ha to you my friend.Would you like Richard's work telephone number?
*LYN:	 (        ) why not.Did you discover what company he works for?
*CHR:	No I didn't I'm afraid.
*LYN:	Oh.
*CHR:	No I didn't erm   (.) I didn't ask.But he said er, and I said that I gather you're seeing Lynda the weekend if you do find anything perhaps you could pass it on to her.And John said oh it will give me something to do. ((laugh)) It is a bit desperate isn't it?
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	I think Lewisham have got themselves into a ludicrous state over people er  (.) .Erm   (.) being pushed sideways into jobs that don't match and being paid full price.I don't want  (        ) .Erm being paid their full salary.Yeah we don't want you any more so go and, go and twiddle your thumbs in this corner but they're still paying them twenty thousand a year.Absolute farce.Absolutely farcical.
*LYN:	But I thought John had been put into a job that in fact he was born to and getting his teeth into   (        ) 
*CHR:	Absolutely.Absolutely but he's up against the fact that nobody wants to know what he's doing.Quality control, I mean er   (.) client satisfaction, things of that sort I'm not quite sure what he's into.But er being a local authority they're saying oh come on.Why make the effort.
*LYN:	I mean sadly that really was in a sense what making local authorities answerable was supposed to stamp out.
*CHR:	Yes.And of course local government is the most wonderful procrastinator in the world isn't it?
*LYN:	Yes but if they truly were answerable for their own budgets
*CHR:	Oh sure.
*LYN:	which they're still not
*CHR:	No.
*LYN:	and you know never will be now
*CHR:	That's right.That's absolutely right.
*LYN:	er that things go on like that.
*CHR:	That's right.And that's going to be
*LYN:	But who does it benefit?It doesn't benefit.I was quite convinced that   (.) ninety nine percent of people do not actually enjoy sitting doing nothing.You like to feel useful.
*CHR:	Oh absolutely.
*LYN:	But who does that benefit apart from the fact they're getting a salary at the end of the day?
*CHR:	Nobody.Nobody.Nobody.But but   (.) when initially presented to you, here's twenty thousand a year for doing nothing my friend.It's, it has an element of appeal doesn't it?
*LYN:	Well clearly you'd rather being doing that than doing
*CHR:	Getting nothing for doing nothing  ((laugh)) .
*LYN:	 (        ) .Yes.Yes.But why can't they get their act together and  (.) 
*CHR:	Yes.Yes I agree.
*LYN:	I suppose at the end of the day   (.) yes you're right.He's as well sit pushing papers around pretending to be busy but drawing the salary than being made redundant which is what ought to be happening.
*CHR:	Yes.
*LYN:	But they could possibly, they surely must be able to do it through natural wastage to some extent.
*CHR:	I would have thought so.
*LYN:	I mean all the time  (        ) 
*CHR:	This Guys er business incidentally.They're now saying four hundred jobs will go but less than a hundred will be made redundant.The other three hundred will go through natural wastage.
*LYN:	 (        ) .They said six  (        ) 
*CHR:	They said six hundred originally apparently but then and now they're talking four hundred.There was some rather naff comments about the union people   ((whispers))COHSE I mean what a shower.Erm.On television last night there was some waffling about nothing and complaining they hadn't been told  ((laugh)) .
*LYN:	I don't, I honestly don't know what the answer is with the National Health but it's going to take years and years and years.But probably we'll always   (        ) 
*CHR:	I think the Guys situation is a very interesting   (.) experiment.It's a shame it's going on under a microscope, spotlight or whatever but erm.Spotlight I mean don't   (        ) a microscope.Erm   (.) but even so it's er   (.) it's, it's interesting.And Guys needs it for goodness sake.Guys definitely needs it.
*LYN:	If you look at all the nationalized industries that have been privatized, they're all making thumping great profits now.I wouldn't say it was, like the Gas Board, like B T.And I wouldn't say that we were being fleeced, I mean I, I think we've always been fleeced up to a certain point but they were always making a loss in the past and   (        ) 
*CHR:	Well their, their accounting was cock-eyed in commercial terms Lynda.It, it really was different accounting which is hardly comparable.Erm and I see nothing wrong with making decent profits as long as you're not actually ripping people off as a monopoly.
*LYN:	Yes.I think it's a bit dubious what they do with the profits after.
*CHR:	Well.Oh that, that's a different matter.That is a   (.) surely 
*LYN:	I mean with something like British Gas erm to make the enormous profit they've made surely it must be possible to reduce the price to the consumer.
*CHR:	I would have thought so, yes.
*LYN:	And they can give you all sorts of reasons why   (        ) 
*CHR:	Erm I I I must say I haven't read or heard anything about the British Gas thing.
*LYN:	 (        ) billion  (        ) .
*CHR:	Oh yes.I knew they'd made a lot of money.But erm what they were going to do I don't know.
*LYN:	 (        ) justify why they're not going to reduce the price.
*CHR:	But the South West Water Authority or whatever they're called erm also made a big   (.) profit didn't they?But the guy said well ninety percent of this has got to be spent on a small proportion of the works which we are required to do over the next decade.
*LYN:	Well that's fine.You know if British Gas   (        ) training themselves more efficient or whatever else it is, fine.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes.Yes it's when you see British Telecom repainting all their vans with this silly new logo that you get a bit twitchy don't you?
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Mm. (.) 
*LYN:	I think the health   (        ) length of waiting lists for operations and   (.) the furore about the fact that you've got to ring up and find where the shortest list is and all that  (        ) 
*CHR:	Mm.
*LYN:	which is a sensible thing to do in a way.Lots of people say well I don't mind waiting or whatever.
*CHR:	Well.Norman on his wall has a a a list of er   (.) theoretical waitings for the different specialists at Orpington hospital and presumably he's got one beside it for Queen Mary's as well.
*LYN:	Mm.
*CHR:	So he can actually look at and say oh well   (.) Queen Mary's is the place for you to go my friend.
*LYN:	And some people might say oh I don't want to go there I'd rather wait   (        ) 
*CHR:	That's right.Absolutely.
*LYN:	You know it's going to work out   (        ) 
*CHR:	So it, it's happening already.
*LYN:	Yes.
*CHR:	To some degree.
*LYN:	But er   (.) they're never going to, I don't think they're ever going to get on top of the waiting lists because they're introducing so many new operations.
*CHR:	That's right.Yes.
*LYN:	So.And there are people living longer and needing them.But it's always going to  (        ) 
*CHR:	You, you have got to have a waiting list to use the facilities reasonably fully.
*LYN:	Yes, otherwise you'd have   (        ) sort of hanging around and asking
*CHR:	That's right.
*LYN:	how is that hip?
*CHR:	Yeah.
*LYN:	Shall we do it now? ((laugh))  (.) Right.I'll ring   (.)  (        ) 
*CHR:	There's your jazz band leader.
*LYN:	Jeffrey Jeffrey!Is that really? (        ) 
*CHR:	That's his full time job. (        ) 
*LYN:	 (        ) when does    (        )  (.) And he lives in ?
*CHR:	He admits that it's a   (        ) area  (        ) .He's a bit of an odd boy himself though you know.
*LYN:	Yes.
*CHR:	And I think it was his wife there last night too.Erm and she, she's a, a curious lady. (.) I think it was his wife anyway she went round with a pot at the end. (.) 
*LYN:	And he, I mean that's such an anomaly.He's effectively a surveyor.
*CHR:	Yes.He's a building surveyor.
*LYN:	I mean, you know building surveyors don't wear clothes like that. (        ) pants.
*CHR:	Dressed all in black dear.
*LYN:	I was just gobsmacked  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes, yes.Incredible isn't it.?Brave fellow I'd say.
*LYN:	Yes.I love the   (.) humorous name though  ((laugh)) .
*CHR:	Yes it fits him rather well doesn't it?
*LYN:	Like the little terrace house called Bedlam at the end of   (        ) .
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) Talking of which there's a house down lower Camden which has the Chislehurst station sign.Great big thing.Stuck in their driveway.It's been there for ages and ages and ages.
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) .Not a very clever thief really.
*CHR:	No I wouldn't have thought so either.Enormous great thing.
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	By the way  (.) 
*LYN:	I heard it on erm Capital Radio.Now how does it actually work?
*CHR:	You just say please may I have my Argos card.You take the card back next time and they put it in a machine and add more points to it.Recorded electronically.
*LYN:	And, and where do you, how do you know how many points you've got?
*CHR:	You, you don't.The machine will no doubt tell you but erm   (.) and for every fifty pounds of petrol you get one pound for Argos.
*LYN:	Oh well that's not bad.
*CHR:	Well considering I put thirty quid in to fill the tank yesterday.You, you get there quite quickly.
*LYN:	Yes.Mine takes thirteen pounds worth at a time  (        ) . (        ) such a nuisance.
*CHR:	And then you can just shove in your pass and erm
*LYN:	So they   (.) they put this through the machine.
*CHR:	They just put it in the machine and tag it and, price 
*LYN:	And then when you go to Argos they put this through their machine.
*CHR:	That's right and read it off.
*LYN:	Right.So anyone can use it.
*CHR:	And it's a long term promotion.It's going till the end of next year or, or August next year.
*LYN:	Is it just?
*CHR:	Yes.So you you you have a chance to actually build up something worthwhile.
*LYN:	Yes.I think that's   (.) I think that's the first sensible thing they've done. (        ) worth a pound off so they give you    (.)  (        ) ten points do they every  (        ) ?
*CHR:	Well, my thirty pounds seventy gave me sixty, thirty pence or something. (.) What, what did I say, fifty, fifty
*LYN:	You said fifty pounds   (        ) 
*CHR:	Fifty pounds worth of petrol gives you one pound off. (.) 
*LYN:	Next, up to. (.) Which is five pounds off.So presumably you have to do it  (.) 
*CHR:	Do what?
*LYN:	Well, it says you can collect up to twenty five hundred premium points on your collecting card.
*CHR:	Then you get another card.
*LYN:	Then you get another card.
*CHR:	You've got stacks of cards there. (.) 
*LYN:	I think that's a jolly good idea.
*CHR:	Yes I think it's fair.
*LYN:	And what I really need is another card for my purse! ((laugh)) . When I was in Sainsbury's yesterday you know   (        ) credit card   (        ) pay by cheque.And erm I mean I've got  (        ) 
*CHR:	Membership etcetera?
*LYN:	Yes.
*CHR:	National Trust I see there.Which you never use.
*LYN:	I've never used.Peugeot warrantee   (        ) 
*CHR:	Oh fancy putting that on a plastic card.
*LYN:	Well that's, no it's a breakdown service.
*CHR:	Oh is it?
*LYN:	Mm. (.) Erm my library ticket.Er picture of Kate.Two   (        ) tickets for the thirteenth of June.And erm   (        ) stamps worth fifteen pence each which  (        ) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	 (        ) which I can't live without.But these are my credit cards. ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Oh my god.
*LYN:	What I really need is another credit card.I mean yesterday I can never find my Visa card quickly you know what it's like  (        ) .And I found my Mastercard   (.) first
*CHR:	Yes.
*LYN:	and went to put it back and I thought oh   (.) doesn't matter does it you know   (        ) credit cards.Gave it to the girl and she went   (.) oh   (.) erm   (.) what's the credit limit on this?I said I haven't a clue, I've never used it.She said oh I've got to write down a credit limit. (.) 
*CHR:	So.Oh what's the credit limit on your Barclaycard?
*LYN:	I think fifty pounds you know before they have to   (.) no it isn't my credit limit  (.) 
*CHR:	Well yeah well they mean that credit limit
*LYN:	It's a thousand pounds.
*CHR:	Do you mean as a cheque   (.) backing card?
*LYN:	She said what is your credit limit on this.I don't know.
*CHR:	Were you paying by cheque?
*LYN:	Yes.
*CHR:	Well it's not a cheque guarantee card anyway.That's not a cheque guarantee card.Is it?
*LYN:	Neither is Barclaycard.
*CHR:	It is with Barclays, but I mean the, there's got to be a standard figure for the Barclaycard.Any any anybody else's, my bank card has a figure on it.It actually has fifty quid on it or something of that sort.
*LYN:	I think it's fifty pounds for everything.
*CHR:	Yes. (.) 
*LYN:	Yes anyway.So that had to go back and I had to find my Visa card much to the annoyance of people queuing behind me.
