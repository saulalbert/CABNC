@Comment:	conversation #8 (Tape 058703)
*DON:	There could be no doubt in the mind of John that Jesus had been sent by God. (.) 
*DON:	So what happened when Jesus was thirty years old?
*DON:	Erm   (.) he erm, he ha he went to John the Baptist to baptize, to ask him to be baptized  (.) 
*DON:	Yeah that's right, very good, so nine, [reading] by pouring out this holy spirit and Jesus, Jehovah was er knighting him or appointing him to be the king of this coming kingdom, thing thus have anointed with the spirit, Jesus became the Messiah  [] , which words in the Hebrew and Greek languages mean appoint, a anointed, therefore he became in fact Jesus Christ or Jesus the United, so, so it was Apostle Peter spoke of Jesus who was from Nazareth, Nazareth, how about anointed them, but all the spirit and power, also by his baptism and water, Jesus was presenting himself to God, to carry out the work that God had sent him to earth to do, what was that important work?So mine asks when did Jesus in fact become Christ?And why then? (.) 
*DON:	Er, when he was baptized  (.) 
*DON:	And Peter says by his baptism what was Jesus presented himself to do?
*DON:	To do er   (.) God's will, erm  (.) 
*DON:	Yeah
*DON:	with read it here, hmm
*DON:	That's right as you say 
*DON:	Yeah 
*DON:	So   ((clears throat)) when a person gets baptized then, what, what, they're dedicating themselves to do God's will aren't they?
*DON:	Yes, to carry out God's work, yes
*DON:	Were you, have, have you been baptized?
*DON:	No
*DON:	When you was a baby?
*DON:	Oh when I was a baby yes of course, yes
*DON:	So when you were a little baby   ((clears throat)) did you dedicate yourself to do God's will then?
*DON:	No you're not capable are you?
*DON:	No
*DON:	Er
*DON:	 ((clears throat)) So just for us you don't even know what God's will is do you?When 
*DON:	No er 
*DON:	you're a baby
*DON:	That's right
*DON:	and er
*DON:	There's something as well, er, er in baptism isn't there really?Godparents, these state that you should keep them on the straight and narrow
*DON:	 ((laugh)) 
*DON:	I mean you can't guarantee that
*DON:	No
*DON:	can they?
*DON:	and then again   (.) did Jesus have godparents?
*DON:	No
*DON:	No, I mean if the parents can't keep children under straight and narrow
*DON:	That's right, yeah 
*DON:	and don't and particularly these days they don't go, seem to have all that much interest in doing so do they?
*DON:	No no, not at all 
*DON:	So grandparents are probably even less interested, you know
*DON:	Yeah
*DON:	so

*DON:	So that's when you were born?
*DON:	Yes when, when I was baptized
*DON:	How old where you when you were baptized?
