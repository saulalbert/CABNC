*CHE:	I'd have been terrified somebody was gonna come out and jump on me! •322382_325572•
*FIO:	I was a bit worried when we were trying it on with the passes. •325572_327642•
*CHE:	Rupert! •327642_327902•

*CHE:	Well I was worried about you not hearing me! •334922_338032•
        There's some there's some tea down here. •338422_340742•
        I would have been very concerned that some great big hairy  bouncer would come leaping out at me! •342552_348372•
*FIO:	Anyway, it was a bit weird cos we had to go with parties cos they're all  they're all black and they're all about six and a half feet tall you know! •348372_355622•
        And they don't take any crap from anyone,I tell you ! •355622_360412•
*CHE:	Don't they? •360472_361052•
        Oh oh oh! •361592_362252•
*FIO:	I said , I said we've been doing boundaries for the trial park today and they ran out of passes and gave us these and said they'd be alright. •362252_368202•
        And he goes, er I'm not sure ah, and he nearly let us in there and then but he had to go and see somebody else and he said tell them to go away! •368202_374652•
        So we had to go away ! •375062_376622•
*CHE:	That was the first attempt? •376622_380292•
*FIO:	That's the first time and then we  and then we were still around the back and we darted up over these banks •380292_385062•
*CHE:	Ha! •385062_385232•
*FIO:	and into these trees and  where we were up there no one could see us and we could see the place, so we would see all the gaps in the fences. •385232_392072•
