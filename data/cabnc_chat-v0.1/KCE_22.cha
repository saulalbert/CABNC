*UNK:	In very small doses •397685_398445•
*HEL:	Yeah, she's always been alright with me, you know, so I can't say about anybody else, I mean she's already, she's always been really nice to me, but  like them people she goes around, well she used to go around with Lisa  and Vicky and all that lot and when she used to go around with them she used to be bitching them off behind their back and going oh you're my best friend, to their faces. •398665_420527•
