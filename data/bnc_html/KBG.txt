*** 1 (Tape 033601) ***
Susan (PS052) [1] You've gotta carry it around with you.
Carl (PS051)  [2] It's on volume ten.
Susan (PS052) [3] Well it says, like the microphone here look.
              [4] You've got to ... put it at chest height
Carl (PS051)  [5] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [6] make sure it's knocked or covered by clothing.
              [7] Cos if you have to brush [...] it won't break the ...
              quality.
              [8] If you're at home you can put the machine and microphone on
              the table near where it will still pick up conversation.
              [9] Does that I mean work by a [...] from now on.
Carl (PS051)  [10] Probably.
Susan (PS052) [11] Right ... right and giving things away.
Carl (PS051)  [12] There's nothing to give away.
Susan (PS052) [13] Where's your tapes?
Carl (PS051)  [14] Yeah, there's a load of tapes!
Susan (PS052) [15] It's a lot isn't it?
Carl (PS051)  [16] I think they're all ... I think they're ninety minutes.
Susan (PS052) [17] Ninety minutes on each tape!
              [18] Good grief!
Carl (PS051)  [19] Well forty [...] , I think they're C nineties.
Susan (PS052) [20] Well I can talk the hind leg off a donkey, will
Carl (PS051)  [21] Oh
Susan (PS052) [22] all that
Carl (PS051)  [23] God!
Susan (PS052) [24] [laughing] [...] [] !
Carl (PS051)  [25] Yes I know.
Susan (PS052) [26] It makes you feel very
Carl (PS051)  [27] No, I don't think about it, just let it run.
Susan (PS052) [28] Look at him!
              [29] Well I couldn't care cos I don't like taping [laughing] so I
              shouldn't [] !
Carl (PS051)  [30] Well ... it's never stopped you before!
Susan (PS052) [laugh]
Carl (PS051)  [31] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [32] Not right now though.
              [33] Oh!
              [34] I've got a cup of tea.
Carl (PS051)  [35] No, you were right what you said though about
Susan (PS052) [36] Mm.
Carl (PS051)  [37] Matthew.
Susan (PS052) [38] Yeah I just ... it just seems to me such a complete ... and
              utter waste of of, his time primarily ... for fifteen, I mean
              this being identified a year earlier which ... we reckon it was
              ... you would think that ... even given ... all the red tape and
              everything else
Carl (PS051)  [39] I'll have to look up his records at least.
Susan (PS052) [40] You know it makes you ... well it makes you wonder whether
              ... something could be done without placing him, for his sake!
              [41] Cos he's never gonna achieve anything in an ordinary class.
              [42] He's just got such a downer on himself
Carl (PS051)  [43] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [44] and he's he's got such a ... a negative ... way of looking
              at himself ... and everybody else looks at him that way now.
              [45] Cos he he, he cannot be positive ... he contributes nothing!
Carl (PS051)  [46] It's hard being positive
Susan (PS052) [47] In his own eyes.
Carl (PS051)  [48] for him isn't it?
Susan (PS052) [49] Well it's, I mean I feel sorry for him ... but having said
Carl (PS051)  [50] Well I do and I don't sometimes.
Susan (PS052) [51] well having said that, although I feel sorry for him I get
              annoyed with him!
Carl (PS051)  [52] Yes.
              [53] Like I said he's his own worst enemy!
Susan (PS052) [54] Because he wastes everybody's else's time.
Carl (PS051)  [55] And everybody else is fed up with him!
Susan (PS052) [56] Well this is why I think he'd be better off,hi his needs ...
              are not met by a class teacher.
              [57] And I don't think they have been for this last
Carl (PS051)  [58] Mm, we need a support teacher to go there.
Susan (PS052) [59] for the last year.
              [60] But yo , you need somebody who's gonna work with him every
              day ... and ... with an individual programme and you just can't
              offer that ... in a class.
Carl (PS051)  [61] Mm, it's difficult.
Susan (PS052) [62] The only way you can do that is if he goes to ... a special
              unit ... at Maidstone ... and works
Carl (PS051)  [63] Well I don't think there's provision for him now you see
              because it's a
Susan (PS052) [64] Mm.
Carl (PS051)  [65] there's a term and a half left before he moves on.
Susan (PS052) [66] Well this, this is what I'm saying, if it had been picked up
              ... and followed through ... at an earlier stage he would have
              been ensconced
Carl (PS051)  [67] Oh yeah , well there must have been
Susan (PS052) [68] and
Carl (PS051)  [69] a problem identified earlier on but er
Susan (PS052) [70] Oh!
              [71] Well I think so ... I think it's been identified but I don't
              think it's been followed through.
Carl (PS051)  [72] Well, it's like so many other things isn't it?
Susan (PS052) [73] Yeah, that's always the way though innit?
              [74] ... I just [...] cos when I see children like that ... and
              you know there's nothing you can really do for them, you can't
              make up for the fact ... that they've got a rotten home life and
              that's ... top and bottom line that's what it is!
Carl (PS051)  [75] Yeah.
Susan (PS052) [76] You're trying to be everything ... and they're pushing it
              away cos it's not what they really want ... and they, I mean,
              all, all you can get from him is how marvellous, you're right,
              how marvellous his brothers are ... and yet, what I've heard of
              the brothers they're not
Carl (PS051)  [77] Not much, yeah.
Susan (PS052) [78] they're not all that marvellous, they're not really that
              much to look up
Carl (PS051)  [79] Ah.
Susan (PS052) [80] to.
Carl (PS051)  [81] No
Susan (PS052) [82] And they, they've
Carl (PS051)  [83] role model is it, really?
Susan (PS052) [84] No.
              [85] I suppose marvellous to the wrong things!
              [86] Oh well!
              [87] And he he was ... talking
Carl (PS051)  [88] Was anything else ... said or acted upon or ... shall I use
              the kids who are done today ooh,tha that [...] should be ...
              done.
Susan (PS052) [89] No.
              [90] I don't think so.
Carl (PS051)  [91] Done today?
Susan (PS052) [92] No.
              [93] No I said erm ... I had a conversation with Gillian about
              reading, about little bits of reading ... and, I made the point
              that we'd said last night about him barking at print, reading
              through words that he didn't know ... and not asking what they
              were ... and she said she'd noticed that.
              [94] And, cos we had a bit of a laugh about it, I don't know what
              I'm telling you about it for cos you hear him read anyway!
              [95] But she said yes, she'd noticed, but she said they are
              getting more out of this ... Johnny Briggs book ... than the
              other book.
Carl (PS051)  [96] Mhm.
Susan (PS052) [97] So she's quite pleased ... that she's put them on to it, it
              is difficult.
Carl (PS051)  [98] [...] brilliant!
Susan (PS052) [99] Sorry?
Carl (PS051)  [100] Nothing.
Susan (PS052) [101] Mm.
              [102] And I saw Mrs
Carl (PS051)  [103] Oh yes?
Susan (PS052) [104] in the bank, I went up to the bank
Carl (PS051)  [105] And what did she have to say for herself?
Susan (PS052) [106] She's alright.
              [107] I just don't feel that ... you know, she's basically taken
              Robert back last night, that was very kind of her and all that,
              she said oh it's been nice to have him and ... erm ... but er ...
              Oliver and Robert had got on really well ... and erm ...
              [yawning] that's all really [] .
Carl (PS051)  [108] Are you still working?
Susan (PS052) [109] [laughing] Yeah [] !
Carl (PS051)  [110] It's alright
Susan (PS052) [111] Er
Carl (PS051)  [112] it's just some noise I heard on the tape.
Susan (PS052) [113] oh and we were jus ... well we just sort of cha , I was
              just talking about the weather, she was saying how cold it was.
              [114] And erm ... and I made the point that I ... tipped all your
              lot out of I said what and [] ... I hadn't let them go in the
              classroom and I said it's a new thing but ... I said they got
              their coats on ... they're too macho to wear them that's their
              problem, you know!
              [115] They've got their coats in school.
              [116] But we ... they were very good about going out, I'm not
              going up to her again!
              [117] She's just gonna have to cry herself to sleep I'm afraid.
              [118] I've just
Carl (PS051)  [119] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [120] had enough of her now!
              [121] She's tired, she's had a busy day, so
Carl (PS051)  [122] When was she last asleep?
Susan (PS052) [123] Erm ... just before I came in from school ... and we were
              home by about half three.
              [124] But she's ready to go off really, she probably would have
              done if Robert hadn't tipped the milk everywhere!
Carl (PS051)  [125] Was she asleep by then?
Susan (PS052) [126] And then ranted and raved cos she probably just about going
              off then, you see it woke her up all the fuss and kerfuffle!
Carl (PS051)  [127] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [128] I was so mad with him for doing it!
              [129] ... So silly!
Carl (PS051)  [130] The trials and tribulations of a family life!
Susan (PS052) [131] Mm.
              [132] Trials and tribulations!
              [133] I tell you a ... ou ... I said today when I was in school
              ... cos that's like being at home with my three year old, it was
              just like that today being stuck in there!
Carl (PS051)  [134] I'll just go up and see to her.
Susan (PS052) [135] Alright.
              [136] And try and sort her out.
              [137] ... Where's your ... bit of paper then you have to fill in
              on this?
              [138] About where you're ... working and what you're doing and
              ... who you're doing it with ... and how often!
Carl (PS051)  [139] The log book?
Susan (PS052) [140] Yeah, [laughing] that's the word [] !
              [141] Ha!
Carl (PS051)  [142] The ... the log book!
Susan (PS052) [143] Near the dictionary, yeah.
Carl (PS051)  [144] I
Susan (PS052) [145] [...] ... there's quite a few questions innit?
Carl (PS051)  [146] You get ... a conversation record booklet, tapes one to
              ten.
Susan (PS052) [147] Where's your [...] ?
              [148] Sorry that was the one I was looking for.
Carl (PS051)  [149] Each side covers one side, forty five minutes of a ninety
              minute tape.
Susan (PS052) [150] Mind you, there's been a great pause on it while you went
              to see to the baby.
Carl (PS051)  [151] Mm.
              [152] So then they're all the details, and there's examples and
Susan (PS052) [153] So, you're gonna take that out with you tomorrow?
              [154] When we go and buy the corn and er ... goat mix?
Carl (PS051)  [155] I could do.
Susan (PS052) [156] I'm just trying to think where you ... what you're gonna do
              when I have my, have my hair cut?
Carl (PS051)  [157] I don't know.
              [158] I'll find something.
Susan (PS052) [159] I'll be about an hour ... I reckon.
              [160] I must find that photo as well.
              [161] The erm ... take it with me.
              [162] ... I feel I should be all philosophical and ... start
              [laughing] spouting! [...] [] !
Carl (PS051)  [163] What about?
Susan (PS052) [164] I dunno.
              [165] It sounds good.
Carl (PS051)  [166] I'm spouted out I think!
Susan (PS052) [167] I told you that I was punned today didn't I?
              [168] I'd
Carl (PS051)  [169] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [170] suddenly forgotten, it suddenly just ... it just didn't ...
              twig with them at all.
Carl (PS051)  [171] They didn't laugh when he mentioned then?
Susan (PS052) [172] Yeah they ... they groaned at the ones we'd come up with
              ... but when it came to making their own up
Carl (PS051)  [173] And they couldn't.
Susan (PS052) [174] they'd come out with half of one, they'd come out with
              things like ... I think you're ... er ... I dunno ... er, not
              barking up the wrong tree that was the wrong one, but ... the
              they'd sort of come out with half of a pun and they wouldn't
              finish it off, like oh th , this is smashing!
              [175] Sa , and I'd say ... yeah but that's not a pun ... that's
              only a pun if you ... if you write down this is smashing ... said
              ... erm ... the robber or the smash and grab, in other words the
              window fell in, that kind of thing, you know.
Carl (PS051)  [176] Well anyway how do , does that link with sea ...
Susan (PS052) [177] Well ... we had to
Carl (PS051)  [178] [laughing] words [] ?
Susan (PS052) [179] we, no we broaden it ... i i , they they just couldn't
              manage on the sea ones [...] .
Carl (PS051)  [180] Cor there's loads!
Susan (PS052) [181] Oh they couldn't si , yeah don't forget yo , well I don't
              know why I'm telling you, but, you know your ri , your age range.
              [182] They managed to get some ... ones on the sea, but they did
              have a try ... erm ... a lot of them come up with the erm ...
              barking up the wrong tree said the dog, you know, things like
              that ... with a bit of help.
Carl (PS051)  [183] Yeah.
Susan (PS052) [184] Erm ... there's another one that a lot of came up with ...
              one or two had heard ... a few before ... and they all groaned
              and then accused you of making them all up!
              [185] I said, no, actually [laughing] but that's always a lie []
              !
Carl (PS051)  [186] Oh I thought you might say that!
Susan (PS052) [187] So they all laughed at
Carl (PS051)  [188] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [189] that and then ... but that was quite hard really!
              [190] When I think about it they did ha erm, but I'm fed up with
              talking about school!
              [191] Let's talk [laughing] about something else [] !
Carl (PS051)  [192] School's banned now is it?
Susan (PS052) [193] Yeah.
Carl (PS051)  [194] I don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
Susan (PS052) [195] What a wicked dog!
              [196] [laugh] ... [laughing] Oh God [] !
Carl (PS051)  [197] You're gasping for air are you?
Susan (PS052) [198] Cor blimey!
              [199] I don't know what my mother's fed that dog [laughing] today
              [] , but ... it's certainly repeating on him tonight!
Carl (PS051)  [200] Mm.

              cats ... so I said, fine.

Carl (PS051)  [213] So matter of fact.
Susan (PS052) [214] in the ... she kept speaking about him as tho , as though
              he was all, you know, still alright, and that was just so funny
              the way she said it and I thought I mustn't laugh cos that ...
              er,i she doesn't intend to be funny with it at all!
              [215] That was quite good, in fact, she'll have

Carl (PS051)  [244] there's not been much change
Susan (PS052) [245] Yeah I see it, over that, I mean that's Suffolk all over

              [246] Th they si they sit and look at change for ten
Carl (PS051)  [247] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [248] years and then they think, yeah we might do something
              [laughing] and then they actually go out and do it [] !
Carl (PS051)  [249] Yeah , watching the grass grow is pretty
Susan (PS052) [250] Yeah.
Carl (PS051)  [251] dramatic down here!
Susan (PS052) [252] Sometimes it can be, yeah.
              [253] Yeah, it's interesting though!
Carl (PS051)  [254] I mean, it looks nice it's ... see I'm impressed with her
              ... I must admit, impressed with her.
Susan (PS052) [255] It looks better than it did.
Carl (PS051)  [256] And the decor.
Susan (PS052) [257] Well that'll totally depress Terry [laughing] if he goes
              there then [] won't it? [...]
Carl (PS051)  [258] But theirs is bigger, they've got a pottery room, they've
              got careers education there
Susan (PS052) [259] Yeah, [...]
Carl (PS051)  [260] they've got two classes, they're looking to the library.
Susan (PS052) [261] Yeah but I mean yours is ... a big school now isn't it?
Carl (PS051)  [262] Well ours has got ... loads more pupils than theirs!
Susan (PS052) [263] And they've just got more room haven't they?
Carl (PS051)  [264] They've got, they've
Susan (PS052) [265] Yeah, well they've got an old secondary modern school
              there.
Carl (PS051)  [266] Well it's the old six, yeah that's right.
Susan (PS052) [267] That's why.
Carl (PS051)  [268] Oh
Susan (PS052) [269] I mean they've got the facilities purposely built
Carl (PS051)  [270] Cor, too right!
Susan (PS052) [271] really, that's ... that'd be lovely!
Carl (PS051)  [272] It's ideal!
              [273] I mean, we should have their site.
Susan (PS052) [274] Yeah.
              [275] It's like the girls said to me today, erm ... just before
              the end of ... I'm doing it again!
              [276] But anyway, just before the end of the morning, they said
              erm ... could we practise our talks on each other, and there was
              only ten minutes left so I said, yes ... and they said well can
              we go somewhere quiet?
              [277] And the only way ... place I could ... think to send them
              was the girls' changing room!
Carl (PS051)  [278] Oh.
Susan (PS052) [279] There wasn't anywhere else!
Carl (PS051)  [280] Wasn't it?
Susan (PS052) [281] Cos the library was being used
Carl (PS051)  [282] it was a quiet
Susan (PS052) [283] the hall was, they're getting ready for lunch
Carl (PS051)  [284] yeah it was a quiet joke at the staff meeting that er
Susan (PS052) [285] you know and
Carl (PS051)  [286] my office is er ... gonna be taken over ... because they
              need the extra toilets!
Susan (PS052) [287] Ha!
Carl (PS051)  [288] I would say oh they do for these extra classroom they're
              gonna
Susan (PS052) [289] Well you ma ah, made me laugh when you just sit there in
              that corner ... doing paperwork!
              [290] Like when you were in the other week and I was taking that
              class
Carl (PS051)  [291] I don't normally sit there.
Susan (PS052) [292] Well it was just so funny, it's just the kind of place
              you'd expect to see naughty [laughing] boys, there was you
              sitting to the
Carl (PS051)  [293] Yeah, but I was quiet, I was hardly
Susan (PS052) [294] marking papers [] , you know! [...]
Carl (PS051)  [295] Well there aren't any other places!
Susan (PS052) [296] Oh I know!
Carl (PS051)  [297] I mean Terry said I could use his office but
Susan (PS052) [298] You feel as though it's
Carl (PS051)  [299] he keeps coming in and
Susan (PS052) [300] ah, it feels
Carl (PS051)  [301] and the secretary's knocking on the door, the telephone
              rings, and ... I got a bit of work done.
Susan (PS052) [302] that's inhibiting as well isn't it?
              [303] And it's almost like ... crowding somebody's personal space
              ... if you go in their office.
              [304] And, I feel that when I go in your room now ... very much
              that it is your room, and I feel the same when I go in Glenys's,
              it's her room
Carl (PS051)  [305] Well ... I mean that should be
Susan (PS052) [306] and you're a visitor there which is ... as it should be.
Carl (PS051)  [307] it shouldn't be after, what , seven years?
Susan (PS052) [308] Yeah.
              [309] But that's just it.
Carl (PS051)  [310] Never been painted, never been clean and tidy.
Susan (PS052) [311] Ah but ... but it's, it's all to do with ... having your
              own personal space I think.
Carl (PS051)  [312] Yeah, be o , interesting if they are.
Susan (PS052) [313] Cos mum made me laugh tonight ... but she came in and ...
              she said oh you can have a hot cross bun there, I said well ... I
              think I'll have a piece of chocolate cake and she said ...
              alright then!
              [314] I said, oh I'm glad you approve being as though it's mine
              and it's [laughing] my house, I can eat what I want!
              [315] And she'd just totally forgotten [] !
Carl (PS051)  [316] Mm.

Susan (PS052) [318] So
Carl (PS051)  [319] you see.
Susan (PS052) [320] i , it was really quite funny!
              [321] But ... you [...] cos she'd said ... [...]
Carl (PS051)  [cough]
Susan (PS052) [322] looking after the littlest ones all day and ... and she's
              obviously been speaking to them like that during
Carl (PS051)  [323] Ah.

Carl (PS051)  [351] There ought to be!
Susan (PS052) [352] as wrin , now I know where that's come from.
Carl (PS051)  [353] What wrinkly?
Susan (PS052) [354] Naff, as well, is another word ... that the kids use a lot.

Susan (PS052) [...]
Carl (PS051)  [357] now.
Susan (PS052) [358] They don't like ... [...] .
Carl (PS051)  [359] It's out of
Susan (PS052) [360] What was that word that erm ... Ebony was, used?
              [361] And I ... wa commented on it ... to you, it was when I
              borrowed ... the maternity robe from Penny ... and she
Carl (PS051)  [...]
Susan (PS052) [362] said one, talking about one of the dresses ... and that
              meant it was really awful and I can't think what

Susan (PS052) [375] But when you used to look at the te , you know, the
              children's television programmes, they're
Carl (PS051)  [376] Yeah.
Susan (PS052) [377] nearly all American, the cartoons.
Carl (PS051)  [378] Yes it's a ... hundred and forty four isn't it, a gross?
Susan (PS052) [379] Yeah.
              [380] Suppose so.
Carl (PS051)  [381] With the old numbers.
Susan (PS052) [382] Yeah.
              [383] I don't remember using that.

Susan (PS052) [390] Oh no chance!
              [391] Makes me seem ever so old!
Carl (PS051)  [392] Oh.
Susan (PS052) [393] Looking round at people today and ... you mi , try to
              imagine them ... in their own home setting ... you know?
              [394] And what they're like ... out of work ... you know?
              [395] It's ... I mean it's ... it's difficult to picture people
              anywhere other than where you actually meet them at work.
              [396] I can't im , with not knowing where they live, I mean I
              can't envisage where ... what kind of houses I mean
Carl (PS051)  [cough]
Susan (PS052) [397] some of them ... have got, some [...] .
              [398] ... Quite interesting.
              [399] Oh.

Susan (PS052) [414] Oh, well I'll tape Victoria Wood then cos I like that!
              [415] Them
Carl (PS051)  [416] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [417] Good Guys, it gets more of ... outrageous every week, you
              can't believe a word of it!
              [418] There's no plot to it at all, it's ... it's just so
              farfetched!
Carl (PS051)  [419] Well then ... we'll watch Victoria Wood then.
Susan (PS052) [420] Oh!
              [421] [laughing] Alright then [] !

Susan (PS052) [428] Good Guys sa ... a couple of times and ... [...] ...
              whether it was gonna improve or not ... but it hasn't!
              [429] [laugh] ... Been waiting for it to get better every week
              and it
Carl (PS051)  [430] Well this could be the episode!
Susan (PS052) [431] And you've missed it!
Carl (PS051)  [432] Yeah!
Susan (PS052) [433] Cos we've been watching the repeat of Victoria Wood!
Carl (PS051)  [434] Oh yeah, if we see
Susan (PS052) [435] Why is that Care Bear down there, has she had it out the
              bath?
Carl (PS051)  [436] Probably.
Susan (PS052) [437] [...] difficult to sleep innit?
Carl (PS051)  [438] No, you tell them, I'm fed up of telling kids off today!
Susan (PS052) [439] You haven't had any to look after today!
              [440] None of your kids!
Carl (PS051)  [441] This week I have.
Susan (PS052) [442] Mm.
              [443] I didn't have no [...] ... didn't have any complaints at
              dinner time, [...]
Carl (PS051)  [444] [yawning] Oh [] I don't care Sue, I'm not bothered.
Susan (PS052) [445] Mm.
              [446] That's alright then.
              [447] ... Oh one of the hens got ... erm ... landed on the top of
              the black net ... cos I ... I'd put some ... corn and stuff in
              you see ... and she landed on it ... and she got her feet stuck
              through netting ... so she was flapping and the net was just
              going [laughing] up and down [] !
Carl (PS051)  [448] It's quite er
Susan (PS052) [449] No ... that, that'll give way, that will be alright.
              [450] Now as she, I flapped it, I got hold of it and I flapped it
              so it, I sort of bounced about, she sort of bumped along
Carl (PS051)  [451] Yeah, you have to.
Susan (PS052) [452] until she got onto that crossbar ... and then she just flew
              straight back and did exactly the same thing all over again and I
              just thought ... sod it!
              [453] I left her on there!
Carl (PS051)  [454] Yeah.
Susan (PS052) [455] And that she'll just have to take a chance tonight.
              [456] Cos she saw me putting the corn in and she decided she'd
              try and get it ... by diving through the black net ... instead of
              going through the gate, like with a normal hen, you know, this
              one's obviously brain ... dead or
Carl (PS051)  [457] They are stupid that lot!
Susan (PS052) [458] They are silly!
              [459] Mum said they'd been all over today!
              [460] Dad opened the front door and he said there was a troop of
              them walking up the path!
              [461] He said, he just said get out of it!
              [462] [laughing] They all we , turned round and went the other
              way again [] !
Carl (PS051)  [463] [laugh] ... Surprising that he'd talked back to them, yes.
Susan (PS052) [464] Yeah.
              [465] But the , I mean I came home and they were under the hedge
              ... they weren't going through but ... there's a big piece of
              netting ... has come down ... and it needs ... erm ... stitching
              up and then it needs ... sewing, not sewing ... erm
Carl (PS051)  [466] That's alright, if it's fine let me do that.
Susan (PS052) [467] i , but it needs two of us, it needs somebody on the inside
              and somebody on the out ... just to stop them flying ... through
              it.
              [468] Cos the, the the the cock was on the back door this
              morning, crowing!
Carl (PS051)  [469] Somebody there was crowing ... at about half past twelve,
              quarter to one this morning!
              [470] There were two of them crowing their heads off!
Susan (PS052) [471] Oh I never heard them
Carl (PS051)  [472] Yes!
Susan (PS052) [473] Oh God we'll be popular round here won't we?
Carl (PS051)  [474] That's what I thought.
Susan (PS052) [475] I never heard them Carl!
Carl (PS051)  [476] I mean you're not locking him in any more are you?
              [477] You're not shutting the door.
Susan (PS052) [478] Well I ... I hadn't been shutting the one ... that don't
              make no difference still, there's only ... cos Pavarotti's out
              anyway!
              [479] Cos he he won't ... [...]
Carl (PS051)  [480] Yeah but you don't let the other two, I mean ... it's
Susan (PS052) [481] I ought to ... perhaps we ought to start closing them in
              again then that'll keep
Carl (PS051)  [482] Yeah, perhaps you ought to.
Susan (PS052) [483] them quiet.
              [484] But the trouble was ... with closing them in, not so much
              on the [...] , but on the old flock ... it was so warped, the
              wood with being damp and wet and frosty ... it was freezing
              across every night and it was nearly taking my fingers off
Carl (PS051)  [485] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [486] getting it open in the morning, that really hurt!
Carl (PS051)  [487] Well put a little loo loop or something there.
Susan (PS052) [488] It's too, too rotten, the wood.
              [489] But I've got, what I've gotta do is repair that other coop
Carl (PS051)  [490] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [491] and get that there and then it'll be a lot easier ... cos
              mum said she struggled today to get in that door ... of the [...]
              , I said well what do you go in there for?
              [492] And she was going in for eggs or something, said well I
              usually leave them a day or two in the winter cos it doesn't hurt
              ... and she said she struggled and struggled with that door!
              [493] She said it hasn't got any ... [...] at the minute!
              [494] I said, well no cos it was on, like strings ... but er that
              does need fixing.
              [495] But it's just been too wet and too nasty to do anything
              about it so ... when we've got a chance we'll have to really do.
              [496] She said she's [laughing] looking forward to the day that
              we get it fixed [] !
              [497] Said, oh I'm sorry mum, I'll go and get you some eggs!
              [498] Cos they are quite tame, I mean that's one thing about the
              hens ... I mean ... they can't come out though, they just wander
              about.
              [499] And it ... but the erm ... the goats apparently were no
              problem today, they just stayed on and ... gave them a few bits
              and pieces you know ... so ... [yawning] that was fair enough []
              .
              [500] Oh, I wish she'd hurry up and go to sleep!
Carl (PS051)  [501] I think I'll have to put her down again then.
Susan (PS052) [502] Put her down!
Carl (PS051)  [laugh]
Susan (PS052) [503] I can't understand it!
              [504] I mean she's ... she's been up ... and been busy and ...
              she's had a warm bath and she's had a bottle of
Carl (PS051)  [505] She'll start this caper again though!
Susan (PS052) [506] Yeah, coming in at night.
              [507] I wo , well she was awake in the middle of the night, I
              don't know what time it was but all I could hear was mummy,
              mummy, mummy!
Carl (PS051)  [508] Why didn't you just put her back ... into bed!
Susan (PS052) [509] And I lay her down and she bawls!
Carl (PS051)  [510] Well it doesn't matter!
              [511] I didn't hear her!
Susan (PS052) [512] Well, I heard her!
              [513] And I feel really guilty, I think oh I better bring her in
              ... and then she wakes me up at six o'clock bouncing on the bed!
              [514] So ... And o , also ... when it's the day before I, I'm
              working ... I'm very conscience that I don't want her to be upset
              in the morning, same with Christopher ... I don't want any upsets
              in the morning.
              [515] I don't want her frazzled ... and I don't want him upset in
              the morning cos I wanna ... go out and have a nice ... even keel
              then
Carl (PS051)  [516] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [517] and not have to worry that ... they're er ... gonna be a
              problem for mum
Carl (PS051)  [518] Yeah.
Susan (PS052) [519] to look after you see, so ... I think if that's the price
              we gotta pay if it's ... a choice between tha
Carl (PS051)  [520] Oh yes!
Susan (PS052) [521] putting up with that ... and me not going out ... then I'm
              afraid we'll just have to put up with it!
              [522] Cos it's ... it's too ... erm ... expensive to do
              otherwise.
              [523] That's what I reckon anyway.
              [524] ... Aren't you gonna turn that off yet?
Carl (PS051)  [525] No, we'll let the first side run.
Susan (PS052) [526] Are we?
              [527] We'll
Carl (PS051)  [528] Mm.
Susan (PS052) [529] play it up [...] later on!
Carl (PS051)  [530] [laughing] You're doing very well thank you [] !
Susan (PS052) [laugh]
Carl (PS051)  [531] I think I've only said about three words in ... you're
              doing all the chatting.
Susan (PS052) [532] Well you can't get a word in edgeways ... can't you?
Carl (PS051)  [533] No.
              [534] I'm used to it!
Susan (PS052) [535] No you're not!
              [536] Oh well of course that's making me have a parched throat
              you know, so you're gonna have to ma , go and make me a cup of
              tea!
              [537] Please?
Carl (PS051)  [538] No, you're making me one.
Susan (PS052) [539] Oh go on!
Carl (PS051)  [540] No.
Susan (PS052) [541] Why's that pendulum blue?
Carl (PS051)  [542] Oh, pass!
              [543] I've no idea.
              [544] Pendulum why are you blue?
Susan (PS052) [545] [laughing] I don't know [] ... said the pendulum!
Carl (PS051)  [546] I don't know dear!
              [547] I don't know.
Susan (PS052) [548] We've got big cobwebs up there and all!
Carl (PS051)  [549] Don't tell [laughing] everybody our secrets [] !
Susan (PS052) [550] [laugh] ... Sorry!
              [551] Oh dear!
              [552] It's quite a surprise!
              [553] Mm.
Carl (PS051)  [554] [whistling] Yeah.
Susan (PS052) [555] This is what could be termed in [...] as a ... [laughing] a
              pregnant pause [] !
Carl (PS051)  [556] [yawning] Oh!
              [557] Level four, attainment target two it'll be [] .
              [558] [yawning] Oh, oh I dunno [] !
              [559] You get gobble-eyed looking at all those dockets.
Susan (PS052) [560] Well I had a quick look at them.
              [561] Oh no, you're doing it again, you're talking about school!
              [562] We can't talk about school, it's boring [...]
Carl (PS051)  [563] No, I'm gasping for a cup of tea!
Susan (PS052) [564] What are we gonna do now?
              [565] Well if I go through now she's just ... quietened again ...
              just wait until sh , there's no noise at all from up there, give
              it another ten minutes.
Carl (PS051)  [566] Okay.
Susan (PS052) [567] Then ... and then I think hopefully she'll settle.
              [568] Has she got a dolly in her cot with her?
              [569] ... She does like that so ... we'll have to go and get
              Christopher's present won't we?
              [570] On Monday.
              [571] ... Still seems quite keen on a ... train
Carl (PS051)  [572] Yes he does seem ... keen on the railway track.
Susan (PS052) [573] Anything, apart from get away from tractors for a bit!
Carl (PS051)  [574] Trouble is, is the floor space, he puts it out and ... gets
              stood on.
Susan (PS052) [575] Yeah.
              [576] We'll have to encourage him to put in on the table.
Carl (PS051)  [577] Mm, scratch the table, yeah!
Susan (PS052) [578] Mm.
              [579] Oh he's, oh dad's buying a sander did I tell you?
              [580] No I didn't.
              [581] Dad's buying a sander.
              [582] Cos he said to me, he said don't rush in to stripping that
              table cos he's gonna buy a sander ... to keep his [...]
Carl (PS051)  [583] Did you tell him we were gonna do the table?
Susan (PS052) [584] Yep.
              [585] He said leave it don't do it yet.
              [586] I said, well we hadn't intended doing it yet cos the
              children being so young ... that er ... that's what he needs.
              [587] And he said to me, he said if you hang on ... erm, he said
              you can borrow it ... and sand it all down, you know?
              [588] So, I thought that was ... nice of him.
Carl (PS051)  [589] It'll be nice that.
Susan (PS052) [590] Yeah.
              [591] I thought it was a good idea.
              [592] But you know, until then I think we're gonna have to make
              it that the railway goes on the table, she ju , she doesn't see
              it Carl, she just ... when she broke that
Carl (PS051)  [593] Yes I know.
Susan (PS052) [594] that combine, the [...] she just trod on it but she never
              saw it!
Carl (PS051)  [595] [laughing] Big yellow thing [] !
Susan (PS052) [596] Green actually.
Carl (PS051)  [597] Green, is it?
Susan (PS052) [598] Yeah but
Carl (PS051)  [599] Oh it's the tractor
Susan (PS052) [600] he left
Carl (PS051)  [601] that's yellow.
Susan (PS052) [602] he left it you see, but I mean ... she doesn't know it's
              ... ah she's, she's like Robert, Robert used to walk through
              things instead of round them.
              [603] I can remember him doing that ... way back, when he was
              this age.
              [604] She's gonna be like Robert, I reckon she'll be
Carl (PS051)  [laugh]
Susan (PS052) [605] [laughing] that kind of temperament [...] [] !
              [606] What have we let ourselves in for!
Carl (PS051)  [607] Another one!
Susan (PS052) [608] Another Robert, aye?
              [609] It's not too bad I suppose.
              [610] Could do a lot worse [...] .
              [611] Oh I don't like that woman over there.
              [612] ... And [...] .
              [613] [laughing] Why are you looking at me like that [] ?
              [614] Well that reminds me of Robert that picture.
Carl (PS051)  [615] [cough] ... Before or after a disaster?
Susan (PS052) [616] [laughing] No [] !
Carl (PS051)  [laugh]
Susan (PS052) [617] Oh it's, he's a walking landmine isn't he?
Carl (PS051)  [618] Bless his heart!
              [619] Just like you he is!
Susan (PS052) [620] I know he is, [laughing] that's why I get so irritated with
              him [] cos I see my failings in him so clearly!
              [621] And his, his left hand doesn't know what his right leg is
              doing!
              [622] Terrible!

Susan (PS052)              [1279] Getting on with that aren't they?
Carl (PS051)               [1280] Doing a good job.
Susan (PS052)              [1281] Do you fancy that then?
Carl (PS051)               [1282] What?
Susan (PS052)              [1283] That house there.
Carl (PS051)               [1284] Oh somebody'll be doing it up themselves.
                           [1285] It'll be a smart house.
Susan (PS052)              [1286] Erm on a bad bend though innit?
Carl (PS051)               [1287] Er ... not really. ...
Susan (PS052)              [1288] Yeah that's where the shop used to be, you're
                           right, yeah.
                           [1289] Yeah it is shut, yeah.
                           [1290] Yeah
Carl (PS051)               [1291] [...] oh been closed ages that has.
Susan (PS052)              [1292] Oh I never knew that, there's one for sale
                           there Carl, house.
                           [1293] Mind we always said we wouldn't buy another
                           old house didn't we?
Carl (PS051)               [1294] Mm.
                           [1295] ... I would put in for that if it came up.
Susan (PS052)              [1296] Would you?
Carl (PS051)               [1297] I think so.
Susan (PS052)              [1298] [...] school. ...
Carl (PS051)               [1299] Well it would be silly not to wouldn't it?
                           [1300] ... Give it a go. ...
Susan (PS052)              [1301] Well it wouldn't be much different to what
                           you're doing now, but you may be ... would you be
Carl (PS051)               [1302] Well
Susan (PS052)              [1303] paid more?
Carl (PS051)               [1304] Not much.
Susan (PS052)              [1305] [...] wouldn't be a lot different would it?
                           [1306] ... I don't know how erm [...] ...
Carl (PS051)               [1307] No the only parent ... I knew ...
Susan (PS052)              [1308] Georgie .
Carl (PS051)               [1309] Yes and erm
Susan (PS052)              [1310] She was pleased [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1311] I think 's dad ... Paul, Timmy 's dad was the
                           chairman of governors.
Susan (PS052)              [1312] Oh and he thought they were good did he?
                           [1313] ... Oh and that, that little boy who was at
                           [...] school, Nicholas, he went there didn't he?
Carl (PS051)               [1314] He's still there I think.
Susan (PS052)              [1315] Is he?
                           [1316] Oh well she's obviously decided she likes it.
                           [1317] Either that or [laughing] she's run out of
                           schools to send him to [] .
Carl (PS051)               [1318] Yeah.
Susan (PS052)              [1319] [laugh] Probably a bit nearer the mark.
                           [1320] ... I think that's one of the drawbacks
                           though to a village school.
                           [1321] Er it can be very nice, very cosy, but I ...
Carl (PS051)               [1322] See that also epitomizes what I was saying
                           before, you know I mean if I'm there you could be
                           stuck there for the remainder.
Susan (PS052)              [1323] [...] teaching.
Carl (PS051)               [1324] Oh yeah.
                           [1325] And there's always the danger of it ... could
                           it be changed, and then ... you've got the whole
                           curriculum area to look after.
                           [1326] Instead of having three to look after I'd
                           probably end up having to look after a seven or
                           eight.
Susan (PS052)              [1327] Yeah.
                           [1328] ... But you see I, I don't know ... I can see
                           what you mean, but I don't know whether a move would
                           be the answer cos I think you're ... if you're gonna
                           stay in teaching this is what's gonna happen.
Carl (PS051)               [1329] I mean it's, there must be a time when it
                           settles.
Susan (PS052)              [1330] [...] wherever you go ... wherever you go
                           there's gonna be all this upheaval and ... I mean
                           let's face it if the Tories don't get in this time,
                           and pray god they don't, Labour's gonna completely
                           ...
Carl (PS051)               [1331] Yeah [...]
Susan (PS052)              [1332] alter everything [laughing] that's gone
                           before [] .
                           [1333] They'll keep very little in.
Carl (PS051)               [1334] Yeah I know.
                           [1335] And that doesn't fill me with any great er
                           ...
Susan (PS052)              [1336] But I, I mean which er you, you look and you
                           think well
Carl (PS051)               [1337] Well
Susan (PS052)              [1338] which is the wor er it's gonna be bad whi
                           whoever's in charge really. ...
Carl (PS051)               [1339] [...] the Scottish Nationals. [laugh]
Susan (PS052)              [1340] At least from the point of ... with Labour at
                           least they ... most of them ... send their kids
                           through the state system so they've got a little
                           more idea of what they're talking about.
                           [1341] ... But that still boils down to the fact
                           that everybody thinks they know how schools work ...
                           cos they've been at school themselves.
                           [1342] ... I get really fed up with the whole [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1343] Mm
Susan (PS052)              [1344] Seem like all we ever do is talk about
                           schooling other people's children. ...
Carl (PS051)               [1345] Well ... it's never too far from the back of
                           your mind though is it really?
Susan (PS052)              [1346] No.
                           [1347] ... It's funny I mean I find I'll say
                           something, I'll think oh so and so would like that
                           and I'm [...] about other people's kids, [laughing]
                           why they're [...] [] .

*** 5 (Tape 033702) ***
Susan (PS052)              [1642] a lot of myths surrounding Down's Syndrome
                           children as to what they can and can't do you see
                           ... and er
Carl (PS051)               [1643] Well it's good to see them in the bath anyway
                           having a good ... good old splash about, you know?
Susan (PS052)              [1644] Yeah.
                           [1645] She said she hasn't, I said do you bring her
                           every week?
                           [1646] She said no she said we haven't been for
                           ages.
Carl (PS051)               [1647] That's what she said to me.
Susan (PS052)              [1648] Cos I said I'm really surprised, I said I
                           thought you must come at least every week cos she
                           seems to be so confident in the water.
Carl (PS051)               [1649] She said she hadn't been for a while ... and
                           erm ... then she said ... they didn't really know,
                           they wondered how she was gonna get on in the water.
Susan (PS052)              [1650] Ah no she's fine.
                           [1651] ... Yeah cos they're not supposed to, you see
                           there again, Down's Syndrome children are not
                           supposed to be able to float.
                           [1652] Well she was doing a
Carl (PS051)               [1653] Well she had some floats on I know but
Susan (PS052)              [1654] Well she's only a tot isn't she?
Carl (PS051)               [1655] Mhm.
Susan (PS052)              [1656] No I thought, cos I, I remember reading erm
                           ... I think it's her father who owns one of the
                           bookshops in Woodbridge and he had this book on
                           display, you know he sort of erm ... advertised it
                           if you like ... and it's, it's properly published
                           and everything but he had it as a ... a book
                           available in his store and there was an advert in
                           the Anglian about it, and I remember reading that
                           she said ... er that he said er cos it was his
                           daughter who had the child, that it totally knocked
                           them for six.
                           [1657] They never dreamt that it could happen cos
                           she wasn't in ... the risk age group or anything, it
                           just never crossed their minds that it might happen
                           and they were totally ... well they just didn't know
                           what to think.
Carl (PS051)               [1658] Was there any explanation of it?
Susan (PS052)              [1659] Really shocked.
                           [1660] No.
                           [1661] And she's o she's gone on to have a, a normal
                           little boy you see?
                           [1662] Just a fluke of nature.
Carl (PS051)               [1663] Ah.
Susan (PS052)              [1664] [...] ... She's, she's younger than me.
                           [1665] She's, she's in her twenties and
                           theoretically the, the risk is
Carl (PS051)               [1666] She lo she looks older.
Susan (PS052)              [1667] Yeah but she's not, she's in her twenties and
                           theoretically
Carl (PS051)               [1668] She looked about mid thirties I thought.
Susan (PS052)              [1669] No she's not.
                           [1670] Not as old as that.
                           [1671] I think she was ...
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [1672] Oh look mummy [...]
Susan (PS052)              [1673] [...] ah there's the pygmies.
                           [1674] They've got ... see they've got their tether.
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [1675] Mummy [...]
Susan (PS052)              [1676] Yes yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [...]
Susan (PS052)              [1677] And er ... the fact that she's obviously gone
                           on without ... it was awful, when she was pregnant
                           ... the second time round ... she didn't make a big
                           thing of being pregnant but you could tell she was
                           pregnant but I never quite liked to say to her just
                           in case they had the amnio amnio whatever it is and
                           decided not to go
Carl (PS051)               [1678] Aye they would have done won't they?
Susan (PS052)              [1679] ahead you'd, yeah but you can't have that
                           till sixteen weeks ... and by then you sh you know
                           ... you show don't you?
                           [1680] Anyway ... she's had a little boy and he's
                           fine, he's got a cold that's why he wasn't in today.
                           ...
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1681] That was mum and dad wasn't it?
                           [1682] Yeah.
Susan (PS052)              [1683] Sorry?
Carl (PS051)               [1684] It was dad who was outside?
Susan (PS052)              [1685] Yeah dad dad had got the baby outside, yes.
                           [1686] I don't know him at all, I've never met him.

Carl (PS051)               [1717] Right.
Susan (PS052)              [1718] causing bad feeling or trying to upset her

                           and er we felt that between us we'd got over twenty
                           years' experience of working with children, we
                           reckoned we knew a little bit more ... about what
                           makes children tick.
                           [1719] [laughing] And er [] she agreed.

                           thought ... could just imagine her being saying ...
                           going and saying something and getting, it getting
                           ... moulded a different way, you know?
                           [1727] And then I thought oh bugger it, I'm entitled
                           to my opinion and I made the point that [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1728] Yeah and you have done on more than one
                           occasion
Susan (PS052)              [1729] it just didn't ... just didn't suit Chris a
                           bit.
Carl (PS051)               [1730] Wasn't for Chris.
                           [1731] So what did she say?
Susan (PS052)              [1732] And she said she said well her little boy,
                           Christopher, loves it but he's a quiet child you see
                           ... he thrives on that kind of thing.
                           [1733] And she, he was always quiet when we were at
                           the erm ... t twos to threes.
                           [1734] And er ... and she said he enjoys it and he
                           goes to playgroup ... I think he must go to
                           Dennington playgroup cos he's going to Dennington
                           school, and he enjoys sitting down and being, likes
                           looking at books and he's started writing and she
                           said ... actually she said I'm really panicking
                           because I'm frightened that I might be teaching him
                           wrong and ... that I'm ... I said well why don't you
                           pop in and have a word at the school?
                           [1735] No I'll leave it ... I haven't got one fifty
                           I don't think.

Carl (PS051)               [1794] Yeah there's a study.
Susan (PS052)              [1795] Must be a small study then.
Carl (PS051)               [1796] No it's about the size of our bathroom and
                           toilet put together.
Susan (PS052)              [1797] Is it?

Carl (PS051)               [1802] Er ... there's quite a lot, it goes round the
                           side, round that way, it's a big L shape.
Susan (PS052)              [1803] Yeah. ...

Susan (PS052)              [1806] I don't even know how much it is.
                           [1807] ... Oh yeah [...] garden.
Carl (PS051)               [1808] Yeah there is.
                           [1809] I mean alright ... the pub garden's next to
                           it.
Susan (PS052)              [1810] Yeah there's that, yeah there may be ...
                           noise and ... pretty though
Carl (PS051)               [1811] No well I don't know though, there wouldn't
                           be much ...

Susan (PS052)              [1813] [laughing] Oh [] trust Andrew [...] .
                           [1814] Trouble is you'd
Carl (PS051)               [1815] And the pub, there's nobody in the pub look.
Susan (PS052)              [1816] it's your catchment area again though isn't
                           it? ...
Carl (PS051)               [1817] Well [...]
Susan (PS052)              [1818] Brun Brundish is Wilby.
Carl (PS051)               [1819] Aha.
Susan (PS052)              [1820] It's Wilby catchment and Stradbroke.
Carl (PS051)               [1821] Yeah.
                           [1822] Look there's the garden.
Susan (PS052)              [1823] Oh yeah. [...]
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [1824] Is that [...] ?
Susan (PS052)              [1825] No.
                           [1826] ... No. ...
Carl (PS051)               [1827] But I just wanted to see what it had
                           downstairs, it was typically new, it's a, a lounge
                           not much bigger than the one we've got now erm ...
                           in fact I think the lounge and the dining room area
                           was probably a little bit smaller
Susan (PS052)              [1828] Yeah.
Carl (PS051)               [1829] but a bigger kitchen ... a downstairs loo ...
                           er
Susan (PS052)              [1830] They probably have a bathroom upstairs as
                           well
Carl (PS051)               [1831] Y oh yes it would have, and er a small [...]
Susan (PS052)              [1832] Well move then, is that what you wanna do?
Carl (PS051)               [1833] Ooh ... hell's teeth no.
                           [1834] Couldn't afford it, and we couldn't sell our
                           house Sue. ...
Susan (PS052)              [1835] I don't think anyone can sell anything at the
                           moment.
Carl (PS051)               [1836] I think something like that one could be
                           going for about eighty five thousand.
Susan (PS052)              [1837] Sorry?
Carl (PS051)               [1838] Well it's been gone, it's been built for a
                           year er er er er it's been up for ages hasn't it?
Susan (PS052)              [1839] Yeah well they, they sold it at the wrong ti
                           I mean they built it the wrong time didn't they?
                           [1840] They missed the boat.
                           [1841] ... It's nice
Carl (PS051)               [1842] It's just its location ... but it's nice. ...

Susan (PS052)              [1843] Perhaps we just need to decorate and then
Carl (PS051)               [1844] Yes.
Susan (PS052)              [1845] we'll feel better about ours.
Carl (PS051)               [1846] Ours, ours has got a bigger garden.
Susan (PS052)              [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1847] I don't like that one because of its
                           proximity to the pub.
Susan (PS052)              [1848] Yeah ... well Robert said why have we stopped
                           so I said I think we're looking because it's a
                           typical new house and daddy wants to see what
                           typical new houses now offer.
Carl (PS051)               [1849] I just wanna see for some ideas Robert
                           really, you know?
Robert (PS056)             [1850] It was Andrew who asked that [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1851] Oh
Susan (PS052)              [1852] Oh was it?
                           [1853] Sorry I thought [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1854] Just i ideas for decoration and
Susan (PS052)              [1855] Yeah.
                           [1856] I'm gonna have my kitchen rose pink I've
                           decided.
Carl (PS051)               [1857] I think the toilet needs to be, well if I do
                           the toilet this week
Susan (PS052)              [1858] [...] the bathroom.
Carl (PS051)               [1859] The bathroom, sorry, the bathroom.
                           [1860] Well the toilet needs doing any
Susan (PS052)              [1861] Yeah only needs to be done white doesn't it?
Carl (PS051)               [1862] If I do that ...
Robert (PS056)             [1863] [...] the bathroom and the toilet [...]
                           matching and then your room needs doing.
Carl (PS051)               [1864] Oh we're gonna do our room at Easter time I
                           think.
Susan (PS052)              [1865] Yeah, we should
Carl (PS051)               [1866] I've got that targeted I think for an Easter
                           job.
Susan (PS052)              [1867] we won't have time to do it this holiday
                           Robert, there won't be time [...]
Carl (PS051)               [1868] The bathroom and the, and the kitchen.
Susan (PS052)              [1869] And I'm working in March.
                           [1870] I don't know what I'm doing April yet but I'm
                           definitely working in March. ...
Carl (PS051)               [1871] Yeah nobody knows what's happening April time
                           as yet.
Susan (PS052)              [1872] Cuts into the, it cuts into the we the weeks,
                           I mean that sounds terrible, I'll be, [...] you're
                           only working a few days but it's surprising the
                           teaching days I do ... really, that really does cut
                           into my time at home.
                           [1873] ... Not that I mind but it just means
                           [yawning] things like [] painting and decorating ...
                           what you looking ... [...]

                           mean it's over a certain time, but if you go in at
                           the end of the time
Pat (PS059)                [2256] Yeah.

                           anybody else.
                           [2262] I've always thought that's a, that's a
                           totally unfair system.
                           [2263] It's best with the, what, the best way I've
                           seen it is with a numbers disk.
                           [2264] ... Say from one till ten cos they're the
                           early ones ... and then they get a certain time,
                           then your numbers eleven to twenty
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [2265] Yeah but what I'm saying is erm ... the
                           orange disk was flashing for a long while before the
                           buzzer [...]
Carl (PS051)               [2266] Yeah but it's flashing just as long for those

Christopher (PS053)        [2475] Daddy daddy we need a new lightbulb.
Robert (PS056)             [2476] and the second one [...] open which went

                           steps but my hand slipped so I ... was going round
                           with the current so I tried to hold on to the orange
                           thing that they had put there but I slipped
                           [laughing] off that [] and I kept on going round ...

                           usually has an hour at least in the morning and
                           another hour in the afternoon.
                           [3092] She ain't been to sleep yet. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3093] Probably cos the boys are back you see.
Susan (PS052)              [3094] Mm.
                           [3095] I know.
                           [3096] She, she goes down no problem ... when
                           there's just erm ... us at home, you know? ...
Robert (PS056)             [...]
Carl (PS051)               [3097] Sorry Robert, what did you say like?
Susan (PS052)              [3098] No you weren't five.

Robert (PS056)             [3101] skateboard when I [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3102] Perhaps he was five.
Robert (PS056)             [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3103] It's on red Carl.
                           [3104] ... Just about to go zooming through.
                           [3105] ... Weren't you? ...
Carl (PS051)               [...] ...
Susan (PS052)              [3106] Do you know they've got these bulldozers up
                           the other end ... up near ours.
                           [3107] ... I don't know what they're doing.
Carl (PS051)               [3108] Well who's the blue van then?
Susan (PS052)              [3109] I'll have a look as we go.
                           [3110] But they've got a digger ... and erm a couple
                           of lorries, cos I, I looked and wondered what they
                           were doing.
                           [3111] ... But it's, they seem to be in the middle
                           of nowhere, you know, just on a piece of road where
                           ... there wasn't really anything much happening,
                           opposite the pub.
Carl (PS051)               [3112] They might just be parking up there.
Susan (PS052)              [3113] No, they've got a st they've got the diggers
                           moving backwards and forwards, yeah.
Carl (PS051)               [3114] Practising. [laugh]
Susan (PS052)              [3115] Couldn't see what they were doing though.
                           [3116] ... That's hot this mint, innit? ...
Carl (PS051)               [3117] Lovely. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3118] Yeah.
Andrew (PS055)             [3119] Come on!
Susan (PS052)              [3120] We can't go yet Andrew, the lights are on
                           red.
Carl (PS051)               [3121] Is that Harriet behind R Andrew?
Andrew (PS055)             [3122] Pardon? ...
Susan (PS052)              [3123] They don't know Harriet.
Christopher (PS053)        [3124] No behind.
Robert (PS056)             [3125] Yes it is.
Andrew (PS055)             [3126] What did you say?
Carl (PS051)               [3127] Is that Harriet?
Robert (PS056)             [3128] Yes. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3129] What Harriet ?
Christopher (PS053)        [3130] What's the matter?
Susan (PS052)              [3131] [laughing] Oh it's alright [] .
                           [3132] Panic over.
                           [3133] ... She's nine isn't she, Harriet?
Carl (PS051)               [3134] Ten she is.
Susan (PS052)              [3135] Ten.
                           [3136] She's one of your third years though isn't
                           she? ...
Carl (PS051)               [3137] Who is it?
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [3138] Can I do that?
Susan (PS052)              [3139] Sorry?
                           [3140] ... Hire. [...]
Carl (PS051)               [3141] [...] that's all.
Susan (PS052)              [3142] Oh they're digging the road up, what a
                           surprise.
                           [3143] ... They always dig up the road though.
                           [3144] Where was that bungalow that you said was for
                           sale then?
                           [3145] You said oh that's, that's, that's on the
                           way, on the outskirts of Fram ... in a close or
                           something.
                           [3146] ... I still like these here, they're too near
                           Terry though.
                           [3147] ... Don't suppose they'd be big enough either
                           would they, for us now? ... [...] don't ru run over
                           Mrs ...
Carl (PS051)               [3148] It's not her.
Susan (PS052)              [3149] Isn't it?
                           [3150] It looked like her from the back. ...
Robert (PS056)             [3151] Daddy you know the [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3152] Pardon?
Robert (PS056)             [3153] You know the rough [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3154] Yeah.
Robert (PS056)             [3155] skateboard?
                           [3156] Some of that has worn off.
                           [3157] It's all smooth.
Susan (PS052)              [3158] Oh it will do as er ... you use it really.
                           [3159] You don't use it that much now though do you?
                           [3160] ... Interested in other things now.
                           [3161] ... Nice to see him reading.
Carl (PS051)               [3162] Yeah it was.
Susan (PS052)              [3163] I thought that.
                           [3164] Well we'll try and get some ... erm ... we'll
                           look down, the next time I'm down the library and
                           look and see if they've got any ... Enid Blyton
                           because that might just be a way in.
                           [3165] ... She was very unfashionable at one time
                           but I remember reading and enjoying her books.
Carl (PS051)               [3166] Yeah. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3167] Alright, she might not ... have the most
                           fantastic ...
Carl (PS051)               [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3168] imagination but, for a plodder, it might be
                           erm ... the right kind of book. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3169] No I think you know when this family come
                           out, they come out in force.
Susan (PS052)              [3170] I know.
Carl (PS051)               [3171] [laugh] Think it's one out they're all out.
                           ...
Susan (PS052)              [3172] Er they're, they're all sort of in into erm
                           ... inter-rela yes [...] , they're all inter-related
                           though aren't they?
                           [3173] Carl!
Carl (PS051)               [3174] They have to give way Sue.
Susan (PS052)              [3175] I know but she [...] she wasn't going to
                           then.
                           [3176] Erm ... only erm ... cos Stacey's always with
                           them you know. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3177] Well [...] yeah like you say they're all
                           inter- related.
Susan (PS052)              [3178] But erm I think
Carl (PS051)               [3179] They're all
Susan (PS052)              [3180] think she's a niece, from what I can gather.
Carl (PS051)               [3181] Yeah they're all cousins [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3182] Dad told me, I can't remember what relation
                           she is but she's a relation to them anyway.
                           [3183] But she spends nearly all her time with them.
Carl (PS051)               [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3184] Oh.
                           [3185] ... I think she's a pretty child, Stacey.
                           [3186] ... She's got very ... very pretty eyes.
Robert (PS056)             [3187] Mummy
Susan (PS052)              [3188] What?
Robert (PS056)             [3189] will you remember me in a second?
Susan (PS052)              [3190] Why?
Robert (PS056)             [3191] No just say yes.
Susan (PS052)              [3192] Oh yes [...] here, when you were laughing.
Robert (PS056)             [3193] Will you remember in an hour?
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3194] Yes.
                           [3195] How could I
Robert (PS056)             [3196] Will you remember me in an hour?
Susan (PS052)              [3197] Yes, how could I forget?
Robert (PS056)             [3198] Will you remember me in a week?
Susan (PS052)              [3199] Yes.
Robert (PS056)             [3200] Will you remember me in a year?
Susan (PS052)              [3201] Yes.
Robert (PS056)             [3202] Will you remember me in a million years?
Susan (PS052)              [3203] Yes.
Robert (PS056)             [3204] Knock knock.
Susan (PS052)              [3205] Who's there?
Robert (PS056)             [3206] You've see you've forgotten me already!
Susan (PS052)              [3207] [laughing] you've forgot who I am already []
                           . [laugh]
Robert (PS056)             [3208] You should say ...
Susan (PS052)              [3209] Hello Robert, shouldn't I?
Robert (PS056)             [3210] Yes you should say hello Robert.
Susan (PS052)              [laugh]
Carl (PS051)               [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3211] I knew that one.
Carl (PS051)               [3212] You didn't know that!
Susan (PS052)              [3213] I did know that.
Carl (PS051)               [3214] No [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3215] Oh look!
                           [3216] All the bales, they weren't there the other
                           day.
Carl (PS051)               [3217] What, these?
Susan (PS052)              [3218] Well if they were, oh unless he's uncovered
                           them.
Carl (PS051)               [3219] These have been here for ... months
Susan (PS052)              [...]
Carl (PS051)               [3220] Sue.
Susan (PS052)              [3221] Well perhaps we didn't come this way then the
                           other day.
Carl (PS051)               [laugh] [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3222] Anyway they're nice old bales though, I
                           wouldn't mind a few of them.
                           [3223] ... Well I was looking out the other side cos
                           I was trying to work out where Glynis lived.
Carl (PS051)               [3224] You were looking at the lambs.
                           [3225] We didn't come this way, Glynis doesn't
Susan (PS052)              [3226] Oh that's right.
Carl (PS051)               [3227] live along this side.
Susan (PS052)              [3228] No she doesn't does she? [laughing] [...] []
Carl (PS051)               [3229] So you're not even in the right place.
Susan (PS052)              [3230] That explains why I couldn't see where she
                           lived.
Carl (PS051)               [3231] That's correct. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3232] That's quite nice ... tiles again though.
Carl (PS051)               [3233] Yeah, nice house. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3234] It makes you think of summer dunnit?
                           [3235] You know you look out and see the sunshine
                           and the illusion of warmth ... cos you're, we're in
                           the car.
Carl (PS051)               [3236] It's warm in the car.
Susan (PS052)              [3237] Yeah.
                           [3238] ... Be nice in the summer and just put ...
                           instead of doing her up in all these great big
                           snowsuits, you know?
Carl (PS051)               [3239] Yeah.
Susan (PS052)              [3240] Just put a little sunfrock and T-shirt and
                           that hat on, which I know she won't keep on.
Carl (PS051)               [3241] Yeah.
Susan (PS052)              [3242] And sandals ... and no socks, that'll be
                           lovely.
                           [3243] ... I hope by then that I'll have her, you
                           know, that she'll be dry.
                           [3244] ... In fact I had thought once she gets over
                           this erm tooth coming through ... that I might erm
                           start trying to potty train her.
Carl (PS051)               [3245] Mhm.
Susan (PS052)              [3246] See if she's interested, you know, to see if
                           she's ready.
                           [3247] ... I got a few little pairs of knickers
                           there, I'd have to get her some more though.
Carl (PS051)               [3248] Yeah?
                           [3249] ... Good idea.
Susan (PS052)              [3250] I ought to start, really ... really and truly
                           I ought to start buying them in now in sort of
                           double, double packs, you know, get two ... cos
                           they're expensive to buy.
                           [3251] Sort of three pounds for a couple of little,
                           little pairs of knickers and that and that's a lot
                           when you think they ... when she first starts she's
                           gonna be getting through seven or eight [laughing]
                           pairs a day [] .
Carl (PS051)               [3252] I know.
Susan (PS052)              [3253] You know, you, you sort of think well [laugh]
                           ... have to have plenty in.
                           [3254] ... I've got some up in the suitcase which I
                           can use but ... Oh I, I'll have a look.
                           [3255] I, I still like the Ladybird ones best, they
                           wash nice. ...
Christopher (PS053)        [3256] Andrew I will remember you ... remember you
                           in the weeks ... all the weeks
Susan (PS052)              [laugh]
Christopher (PS053)        [3257] you know what?
                           [3258] I would open the door and I would say look
                           that's Andrew.
Susan (PS052)              [3259] [laugh] ... Half an hour later Christopher
                           comes up with a joke.
Carl (PS051)               [3260] That's one way of getting the joke,
                           [laughing] yes [] .
Susan (PS052)              [3261] Yeah.
                           [3262] ... Have you got anywhere t
Robert (PS056)             [3263] What's that black paper up there for mummy?
Susan (PS052)              [3264] Where?
Robert (PS056)             [3265] There, on the window.
Susan (PS052)              [3266] Oh somebody took all our lovely parking
                           ticket display off that was keeping the tas tax disk
                           up ... and replaced it with black tape.
                           [3267] It was either Nan or GrandPat.
                           [3268] ... Who was it?
Robert (PS056)             [3269] I don't know. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3270] Probably your dad.
Susan (PS052)              [3271] Yeah. [laugh] ...
Robert (PS056)             [3272] I never did it.
Susan (PS052)              [3273] Oh I know you didn't do it. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3274] Open your window a little bit Robert, let
                           some fresh air into the back. ...
Robert (PS056)             [3275] It's nice
Carl (PS051)               [3276] Bit more. ...
Robert (PS056)             [3277] ain't it?
Susan (PS052)              [3278] Or even isn't it.
Carl (PS051)               [3279] That's it.
                           [3280] Good lad.
Susan (PS052)              [3281] Speak posh sometimes.
                           [3282] ... We never did afford our meal did we?
                           [3283] [laugh] ... We gaily thought oh yes we'll
                           have enough money to pay for [laughing] a meal [] .
Carl (PS051)               [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3284] [...] [laughing] we can't afford it now [] .
                           [3285] Never mind.
                           [3286] ... Maybe we should earmark ... perhaps my
                           birthday, to go out.
                           [3287] Arrange it in advance you know?
Carl (PS051)               [3288] Mm.
                           [3289] I don't like the thought of anybody else ...
                           come to babysit though personally.
Susan (PS052)              [3290] No [...] but
Carl (PS051)               [3291] I know people keep saying oh we'll do it for
                           you but
Susan (PS052)              [3292] We'll do it,we yeah I know.
                           [3293] Well the thing is if I arrange it for May I
                           can ring er talk to mum and see if she'll do it
Carl (PS051)               [3294] Yeah.
Susan (PS052)              [3295] and do it that way.
                           [3296] I don't know what day my birthday's on this
                           year.
                           [3297] Oh it's still Christopher's birthday anyway
                           ... didn't mean to start talking about mine, only as
                           a means for having a meal out. [laugh]
Carl (PS051)               [...] ...
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [cough]
Carl (PS051)               [3298] Oh whee! ...
Unknown speaker (KBGPSUNK) [cough]
Susan (PS052)              [3299] Mind if he's coughing like that ... erm ...
                           don't know.
                           [3300] Don't suppose I'd get in the surgery tomorrow
                           now.
                           [3301] ... If it's just a cough to go with the cold
                           then there's nothing they can do anyway, but if it's
                           an asthmatic cough then I can give him some erm ...
                           Ventolin. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3302] That's what he's had before. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3303] He is wheezier but ...
Carl (PS051)               [3304] He's had it for a week. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3305] Mind I hadn't noticed.
                           [3306] I must be a terrible mother, I just haven't
                           noticed.
Carl (PS051)               [3307] You're used to it. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3308] Well ... He doesn't get them quite as
                           frequently now though as he did.
Carl (PS051)               [3309] No.
Susan (PS052)              [3310] Not quite cos I mean at one time, when he was
                           Christopher's age ... god he was never free from
                           cold was he?
                           [3311] We'd have a respite of about a fortnight if
                           we were lucky before he went down with the next one.
Carl (PS051)               [3312] Yeah [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3313] In fact I remember I took him out of school
                           for nearly three weeks to try and ...
Carl (PS051)               [3314] Get rid of [yawning] the bro []
Susan (PS052)              [3315] ge get his health ... yeah
Carl (PS051)               [3316] bronchial infection that he had.
Susan (PS052)              [3317] Yeah, that's right.
                           [3318] ... And also because I didn't think they were
                           doing that much there with him anyway.
                           [3319] [laugh] I reckon he learnt more in that three
                           weeks at home than he ever did there.
Carl (PS051)               [laugh]
Susan (PS052)              [3320] Yeah.
                           [3321] ... [...] ring up [...] make an appointment
                           for Dr .
                           [3322] He's sometimes easier to get into.
                           [3323] ... Chris hasn't been too bad though, his
                           ears have been reasonable.
Carl (PS051)               [3324] Is he still on medicine or not?
Susan (PS052)              [3325] Well it's there.
                           [3326] I stopped, I stopped using it, I must admit.
Carl (PS051)               [3327] Why?
Susan (PS052)              [3328] Well it made him drowsy for one thing, it
                           kept knocking him out.
                           [3329] ... And er ... he could hear me perfectly
                           well.
                           [3330] I thought well it's there for next time.
                           [3331] ... Soon as th there's any ... slightest hint
                           of hearing loss I can ... [...] .
                           [3332] In a way though, perverse though it sounds,
                           I'd rather let it get fairly bad and take him back
Carl (PS051)               [3333] Mhm.
Susan (PS052)              [3334] because it's only by that way that ... if, if
                           he's gonna need the grommets or something in his ear
                           ... then he really needs to get it sorted out this
                           year.
Carl (PS051)               [3335] Yeah.
Susan (PS052)              [3336] I don't want him to start in the January and
                           then have to be off school for three weeks because
Carl (PS051)               [3337] Mm.
Susan (PS052)              [3338] he's got to go to hospital to have his ears
                           done and things like this, you know?
                           [3339] ... If it's gonna plague him and give him
                           trouble let's get it sorted out this year, even if
                           it means that he has a little bit of temporary
                           deafness ... for a little while, you know?
                           [3340] ... [yawning] Oh dear [] ...
Robert (PS056)             [3341] Mummy what's the erm ... water tower near the
                           erm ...
Susan (PS052)              [3342] I don't know what you mean Robert.
Robert (PS056)             [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3343] Oh erm ... jumbo.
Robert (PS056)             [3344] Jumbo.
                           [3345] ... What's the erm ... [...] cinema next to
                           the [...] ?
Susan (PS052)              [3346] It's not a cinema it's the Mercury Theatre.
Robert (PS056)             [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3347] Where you saw the pantomime?
Robert (PS056)             [3348] Yeah.
Susan (PS052)              [3349] It's the Me
Robert (PS056)             [3350] [...] forgotten the name of it.
Susan (PS052)              [3351] That's the Mercury.
                           [3352] It's a nice theatre that.
                           [3353] ... [...] ... [singing] ... What was here
                           before they put these up Carl?
                           [3354] I can't remember, or was it just ... a bit of
                           ground?
Carl (PS051)               [3355] Mm. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3356] Wonder if Tamsin had any luck selling her
                           house.
Robert (PS056)             [3357] What I don't understand ... is when erm ...
                           she jumped into the beauty parlour door, how did erm
                           [...] change so quickly?
                           [3358] Change clothes.
Carl (PS051)               [3359] It was somebody else Robert who was in there
                           already.
Robert (PS056)             [3360] Oh.
Susan (PS052)              [3361] Yeah it's all ... all very clever.
                           [3362] ... Yes it's what pantomime's all about.
                           [3363] Thinking on your feet, improvisation.
                           [3364] ... It's great.
                           [3365] I enjoyed doing pantomime.
                           [3366] ... Oh I wasn't a very convincing Prince
                           Charming though, [laughing] don't think I'd do it
                           again [] .
Carl (PS051)               [3367] You did your best, had a go.
Susan (PS052)              [3368] Had a go.
                           [3369] Wasn't me.
                           [3370] I'm better backstage, I'm better writing
                           things and ... than on the st on the stage.
                           [3371] I'm not enough of a strutter ... anyway. ...
Carl (PS051)               [3372] Oh you've gotta be a poser. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3373] Oh I, I enjoy [...]
Carl (PS051)               [3374] You did okay.
                           [3375] You [...]
Susan (PS052)              [3376] I did it.
                           [3377] Well I, I enjoyed it when I was at college, I
                           used to enjoy drama there.
Carl (PS051)               [3378] Not the same as putting on a big performance
                           though is it?
Susan (PS052)              [3379] No it's a bit different.
                           [3380] When you put the ... and that's the
                           difference about drama at college is you're doing it
                           to please yourself ... and the, the group that
                           you're in with and ... ultimately I suppose your
                           tutor ... but when you do something like a pantomime
                           when you're doing it to please the punters ...
Carl (PS051)               [3381] Yeah. ...
Susan (PS052)              [3382] [...] ... I think the bravest thing I ever
                           did in my life was sing solo at that pantomime, I, I
                           think that was braver than giving birth or
                           [laughing] having my wisdom teeth out [] .
Carl (PS051)               [3383] I think you sang quite well.
Susan (PS052)              [3384] The bravest thing I ever did. [laugh]
Carl (PS051)               [3385] You sang quite well for
Susan (PS052)              [3386] It's one of m it's one of my ... me memories
                           I've erm ... hidden, well not hidden away but tucked
                           away ... to look at in
Carl (PS051)               [3387] In a later
Susan (PS052)              [3388] later years, say well okay I, I haven't got
                           ... a fantastic voice but I did it and that was the
                           bravest thing I did cos I know I haven't
Carl (PS051)               [3389] Anna's voice isn't much better.

Susan (PS052)              [3752] It's got enough room as well to put all the
                           bits and pieces, mind you if you had a house like
                           that you could afford to have someone to look after
                           all the [laughing] goats and the hens [] . ...
Carl (PS051)               [3753] [yawning] Oh excuse me [] .

                           I've got, not got the remotest chance of owning?
Carl (PS051)               [3755] I don't know, for the size.
Susan (PS052)              [3756] You reckon? ...
Carl (PS051)               [3757] There's nothing to stop you looking.
Susan (PS052)              [3758] Yeah I know but it makes you discontented

                           then, they'd have been cold ... I think if we'd left
