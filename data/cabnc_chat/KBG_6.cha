*SUS:	Yeah there's that, yeah there may be   (.) noise and   (.) pretty though 
*CAR:	No well I don't know though, there wouldn't be much  (.) 
*AND:	Oh look at that  (        ) 
*SUS:	 [laughing] Oh   [] trust Andrew  (        ) .Trouble is you'd 
*CAR:	And the pub, there's nobody in the pub look.
*SUS:	it's your catchment area again though isn't it? (.)

*UNK:	Is that  (        ) ?
*SUS:	No. (.) No. (.) 
*CAR:	But I just wanted to see what it had downstairs, it was typically new, it's a, a lounge not much bigger than the one we've got now erm   (.) in fact I think the lounge and the dining room area was probably a little bit smaller
*SUS:	Yeah.
*CAR:	but a bigger kitchen   (.) a downstairs loo   (.) er
*SUS:	They probably have a bathroom upstairs as well 
*CAR:	Y oh yes it would have, and er a small   (        ) 
*SUS:	Well move then, is that what you wanna do?
*CAR:	Ooh   (.) hell's teeth no.Couldn't afford it, and we couldn't sell our house Sue. (.) 
*SUS:	I don't think anyone can sell anything at the moment.
*CAR:	I think something like that one could be going for about eighty five thousand.
*SUS:	Sorry?
*CAR:	Well it's been gone, it's been built for a year er er er er it's been up for ages hasn't it?
*SUS:	Yeah well they, they sold it at the wrong ti I mean they built it the wrong time didn't they?They missed the boat. (.) It's nice 
*CAR:	It's just its location   (.) but it's nice. (.) 
*SUS:	Perhaps we just need to decorate and then 
*CAR:	Yes.
*SUS:	we'll feel better about ours.
*CAR:	Ours, ours has got a bigger garden.
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	I don't like that one because of its proximity to the pub.
*SUS:	Yeah   (.) well Robert said why have we stopped so I said I think we're looking because it's a typical new house and daddy wants to see what typical new houses now offer.
