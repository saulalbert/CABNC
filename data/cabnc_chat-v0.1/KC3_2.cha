@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 051603)
*FRE:	But then they have to er raise money to go. •0265_8405•
*PET:	Right. •8465_8565•
*FRE:	I mean it  •8565_11085•
*PET:	I think it's only, I don't think  he, he's  there's any cheap answers •11085_15555•
*FRE:	No. •15835_16145•
*PET:	and I know well some time when  retirement was looking on the  on the horizon  I was saying to him you're not alone  but, you know, you've gotta be looking towards being on your own because of course  •16515_36375•
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	mother and I hope father and I will  be around to want to pick up what we can to help  you've gotta start thinking about  standing on your own feet, you know, because  admittedly I er I, I, I  could turn out to be  not as bad a financial state as I anticipated but I never was stinking rich and I'm certainly not stinking rich now, so  erm I mean •38115_82745•
*FRE:	No but quite apart from that, er there's  anybody er needs to aim to be self sufficient don't they? •82885_91715•
*PET:	Well I, I, I, I think that you've got to  move in that direction rather than maintaining the status quo. •91815_101425•
        So erm  if, if it was er if it was a matter of  oh bankrolling him out to wherever it was or  supplementing his own resources   okay, but the, the experience and I mean the personal experience as well as the er the skills experience •102685_134785•
*FRE:	Mm. •135505_135595•
*PET:	that •135895_136005•
*FRE:	Yeah but he's got to want to do it. •136005_138155•
*PET:	Quite. •138155_138365•
*FRE:	Er erm that's the, that's the crucial bit. •139345_142655•
*PET:	Absolutely. •142655_142965•
        There is no possible way of shipping an unwilling young person out. •143935_155365•
*FRE:	No that's right. •156635_157545•
        Because even  •158095_158905•
*PET:	I don't think there ever was. •158905_160845•
*FRE:	even those that er you know are definitely wanting to go and keen can  get homesick  fairly soon. •160845_167675•
*PET:	Oh yeah. •168515_169965•
        But you know erm if, if, if you look back to the days of the Raj  erm it was a  even within my living memory, erm people were joining the armed services or the overseas er er   corp and the civil service overseas I suppose, yeah, er at a, at a fairly  humble level and would either work their way up or they drink themselves stupid or they get mixed up with someone or they, you know  but it was a, a, a  recognized way of, of, of going, you know, either join the services or the •170215_230665•
*FRE:	Mm. •231255_231595•
*PET:	or the church of course was another one, erm but  none of these  traditional  erm  avenues exist now •232195_245115•
*FRE:	No. •245205_245465•
*PET:	and more and more and more people are looking for experience, they're looking for vocations, they're looking for er  the sort of  attributes which, you know, aren't actually overflowing when you're unemployed in Wolverhampton •245465_271035•
*FRE:	That's right. •271745_272345•
*PET:	having failed out on two poly courses. •272715_278485•
        So erm we as, we as I say are very concerned about er  that can't have done Jan any good, that's •278715_289615•
*FRE:	No no, that's right. •289815_291875•
*PET:	She really has  this er  attitude which  I cannot understand because erm as I think it was Al Reeve said, you know, erm some people can't bear children, we can't, but we like them  but if you have actually borne children, you are in other words a mother, you've gotta have a  attitude, not only to children in general but to your children in particular, which is very very difficult for  er a male to understand and a non-father, it's gonna be very very difficult cos I personally don't have any children at all and therefore it is very very difficult for me to even comprehend but  given that I can erm I can sympathize with something I do not comprehend  it must be monumentally difficult for her •292465_359055•
*FRE:	Yeah. •360655_360735•
*PET:	it really must . •361695_363765•
*FRE:	Yes, oh yes,that's right, there's no doubt about it. •364275_367655•
*PET:	And erm poor Jan is  saying what   have I done, should I have done, could I have done  •368255_383545•
*FRE:	Yeah. •383665_383965•
*PET:	and, you know, once you start into, into that er scenario you, you, you can't  very very little erm opportunity for anything because  all you can do is, is to say what do we do now, never mind what we could, should or might have done then, what do we do now because the future is that way and the past is   •384475_417795•
*FRE:	Yeah. •421195_421385•
*PET:	We can be influenced by history, we can, we learn from history, we can do all sorts of things about history but what er er as far as  er  Christopher's concerned, what do we do now because that  I just don't know! •421995_439355•
        I just •439355_440065•
*FRE:	No. •440065_440245•
*PET:	don't know! •440515_440785•
*FRE:	No that's right. •440785_441175•
*PET:	And erm  the really distressing thing is  I think Christopher is saying what to do now  I think he is saying oh you know •441175_458285•
*FRE:	Yeah. •458285_458365•
*PET:	I, I've been •458535_458855•
*FRE:	Yeah •459315_459435•
*PET:	depending on, sponging off er whatever  for however long and now he is going, is, is retiring on health grounds, you know, he really isn't going to be er able to bankroll me •461295_479075•
*FRE:	You mean he, he's now talking about you? •479895_481735•
        Yeah, yeah. •481735_482255•
*PET:	Well I mean, yeah, he •482405_483615•
*FRE:	Er thinking, yeah. •483785_484845•
*PET:	he's not, he's not, he's not a, he's not stupid, Christopher, he, he's certainly not stupid, and er  he must have seen, I mean I assume he keeps his bank statements, I mean I'm afraid we have one or two bank statements which show  thousands of pounds that he's received from us over the last year erm and, you know, he can't  blind because they've all gone through his bank account, you know, he must •484965_514935•
*FRE:	Yeah, quite  •514935_515895•
*PET:	be thinking good grief, you know, I haven't had a  a, a, a successful, happy  year or so •516035_524805•
*FRE:	No. •524805_525125•
*PET:	and  it has, it has represented volumes of money which the state can't or won't or doesn't  carry on with. •526845_540015•
        So I think he's sitting there in Wolverhampton about this time wondering what on earth he is  •540015_548905•
*FRE:	I'm sure he must be  •549055_551995•
*PET:	looking forward to and    that is a very very  painful  situation to be in isn't it? •551995_564895•
*FRE:	Mm. •565045_565105•
*PET:	I, I just don't know what he's, he's, he's, he's, he's seeing his future as being and erm  maybe cos we haven't got , maybe erm it's because of the  generation gap, maybe it's because of communication problems either between me and him or the young and old or whatever but, you know, he just doesn't seem to have anything  to  volunteer er other than ah well I'll try and get a job or ah well I'll try and get some more qualifications or whatever. •565855_613735•
        So, yeah, that's sort of  •615065_621635•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah  •621955_622325•
*PET:	another bit in the •622325_623905•
*FRE:	Yeah. •625455_625605•
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Where, whereabouts is Lyndsey in her training now? •625815_629845•
*PET:	Oh she's erm  tt  she is the  brighter  spark on the horizon I suppose, you know? •630255_643265•
        It makes me cough a bit because when  I came on the scene he was the one academically everything and she was the one who was academically rather  disadvantaged but she, she was, you know,not having the greatest of, of, of success but erm  it was said that she wouldn't be able to be a student nurse because she wasn't bright enough but you know she  clocked up the O levels and A levels like guide badges and she went off on this pre-nursing course in South Notts you know and  she was in and out of the Queens on a course and   people and, you know,and  she said I  don't know all the answers but I've a rough idea about some of the questions, I want to be a nurse and  off she went to, to, to Walsall and  I'm not saying she's a brilliant student nurse but erm  absolutely clear that she's better than some of the others. •644025_731005•
        And er, you know, that's  negative if you will but  it's fact •732855_740455•
*FRE:	Yeah. •740465_740475•
*PET:	and  she's still enjoying it which is great  •740625_743765•
*FRE:	Yeah, so, so what year is she, er third year? •744105_746685•
        Yeah. •746685_746935•
*PET:	Mm. •746935_747235•
        Takes her finals this, this summer. •747235_749335•
        And erm not only er do I think that er she'll probably  be reasonably good with, with finals  I'm absolutely sure that her course reports from, you know, all the places where she's been will be  better than most of the other candidates, you know, because she brings home these,these reports, you know, and she says it looks alright, you know,beginning of the course  Nurse  is lacking in this or has not got that or is not, you know, you think mm pretty  the end of the course   Nurse  got the hang of, is very good, has done this, has done that, has supported this and you think mm pretty, well that's lovely  you know but she  didn't have the experience  during the whatever, she had been given the experience and the end of it  brilliant •749695_825735•
*FRE:	Mm. •825845_826015•
*PET:	A or whatever it is, you know? •827685_830915•
*FRE:	Mm. •830955_831025•
*PET:	And er I, I would therefore think that it's, it's unlikely that she'll crash out on her exams. •831025_837425•
        But if she did  I think she will pass out on her record because perhaps, even more delightful than someone who, you know, sitting down to an exam and, and  doing reasonably well on it. •837955_858415•
        So  I, I, I think that er one of the, the  comforting things which er  I I can see is that she has grown in self confidence, not cockiness, self confidence. •858415_879335•
        She has learnt, she has absorbed  inwardly digested a quantity, a considerable quantity of it, I think that she will be a reasonably  useful  nurse to have around. •880585_900325•
*FRE:	Mm. •900665_900755•
*PET:	That's lovely   •900755_902395•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah  •902405_902735•
*PET:	You know, they, they, they can be a bit hard, they can be a bit bitter, they can drink a bit too much, they can be a bit promiscuous, they can be all sorts of rather  iffy things but I don't think Lyndsey will. •903225_918425•
        I, I, I, I've got, I think all the evidence is building towards her being  •919105_925665•
*FRE:	Mm. •925755_925815•
*PET:	a good little nurse. •925955_931415•
*FRE:	Yeah. •931615_931735•
*PET:	What on earth she does then  I dunno. •932645_936285•
        Erm  mm I can't remember, Alan and Josie's daughter down the road, erm  she  passed out as a nurse from Queens a while ago and you know what students are in general, nurses in particular , there was, you would expect, one hell of a party when the exam results were public   what came out of the    the party was when she got a job  as a nurse. •936285_975255•
        And that is absolutely mind blowing to me •975615_981315•
*FRE:	Yeah. •981525_981645•
*PET:	because I can remember, and it's not that long ago for goodness sake, that if you qualified as a nurse, and  will probably tell even the same story to an extent, there was no problem about a job, you were a certified nurse, bang. •981645_998635•
*FRE:	That's right. •998635_100000•
        Well er I mean that's  not going back too far either. •100001_100416•
*PET:	Well  it ain't now •100416_100676•
*FRE:	Mm. •100677_100678•
*PET:	and er er er er the situation is that you can, in, in some of these nursing schools where they have taught you and it is their letterhead that's on your pass-out, they still aren't in a position to say oh well there's a job of course because you don't need to have passed out top, you know, to be guaranteed a job, there ain't no jobs  guaranteed for no one. •100678_103272•
        And er I just don't know what to do. •103506_103819•
        California and Saudi Arabia are two of the, you know, destinations that come to mind but erm  I don't know about that either, you know, if she doesn't  •103819_105517•
*FRE:	What month does she take the exam? •105555_105826•
*PET:	Oh I er er I think it's erm  July or er June, July or August, it's, it's, it's it's  •105826_106674•
*FRE:	Yeah. •106675_106676•
*PET:	the summer. •106683_106705•
        I think she maybe takes the exams in June and gets the results in July and  er then we're fifty in August and then we go off to North America in September I think, you know, er I think, I, I can't quite remember the details but erm •106705_108416•
*FRE:	You've got a holiday booked? •108416_108675•
*PET:	Yes, yes  •108675_108715•
*FRE:	Good. •108715_108751•
*PET:	well we've erm  we've erm  we've been rather  tempted by the west coast er  I personally want to see the Grand Canyon and erm I'd like to see San Francisco  so the package which is being offered to the Boots Association with whom we've been away several times and  we we like it as, as a, as a background because you've got a rough idea, you know, the people you're going with   •108841_114136•
*FRE:	Yes. •114151_114152•
*PET:	there are, there are very very few who are chasing women or men and there are very very few who are er  requiring to be prised out of the bar erm  at two o'clock in the morning. •114156_115860•
        There are very very few who are er interested in finding a gambling haunt or a, you know, television or film theatre or whatever, you know, er er by and large there are a lot of people who  chat to a waitress if they're a bloke or, or chat to the, the whatever it is if they're girls but er in, in a, in a friendly way, who will have a drink but will not be paralytically drunk, who may watch television or a, you know, film or theatre or something if it's appropriate but won't get twitched if it isn't, you know, and  and by and large erm all the people we've, we've, we've, we've come across  I came across before have been very very good company and it is, it is delightful to have the  have you, cos have you been on a on a Signpost? •115873_121871•
*FRE:	Yes  a Signpost holiday, yeah •121902_122274•
*PET:	Yeah. •122274_122342•
*FRE:	Mm. •122347_122387•
*PET:	Well er  I think that getting away the  oh you live in Nottingham, oh fancy that  you know, you, you know where you're starting, you know, everyone either works for Boots or used to work for Boots and, you know, you've got a rough idea, you, you, you don't need to go into the  oh fancy that   you know, all that's  arranged so erm I think it's,it's the middle of September when we either go to Los Angeles, I think we go to Los Angeles, and fool around Hollywood and San Diego and places and down to  to see a  and then away off to erm Las Vegas and Flagstaff  you know about this meteor crater in Flagstaff, that apparently is why you go to Flagstaff tt a meteor came, the meteor crater is there tt and then the Grand Canyon and   go through  national park which  San Francisco and erm  spend erm two or three days there and then come back again. •122387_130624•
        Tt so erm  we are thinking it will be, like everybody else, it's not a good idea to put too much off  too far into the future  •130785_132137•
*FRE:	Oh no no, you want to go. •132137_132394•
*PET:	I, I think, well I think so. •132394_132593•
        And so er friends of ours, he's got  muscular dystrophy  and he's sort of in the same sort of  and so we   we'll have a decrepit contingent,he and I will  sort of and the two girls who are relatively young and healthy will go charging around and  taking photographs and  doing the tourist thing. •132593_135721•
*FRE:	Yeah. •135721_135729•
*PET:	Yes. •135729_135778•
        Sort of on the, on the horizon for the end of the year and er  I, I er don't know how we're going to  do but erm  I think the answer probably is to  take a chunk at a time on the basis that erm one isn't going to be able to charge around as violently, actively as some people will. •136291_139532•
*FRE:	Yeah, yes er erm that's oh you must because then you have the memories. •139652_140356•
*PET:	Exactly. •140356_140376•
        Exactly. •140376_140385•
        Not only does no one want to take those away, no one can take them away •140385_141116•
*FRE:	That's right. •141116_141170•
*PET:	that's er that's right, you know, and  erm what I'm saying to myself is okay, you know, er  maybe it will be tiring, I'm sure it will  maybe it will be erm  expensive, like take a taxi because   can't walk, you know, erm  erm okay •141170_143505•
*FRE:	 ((yawn)) 
*PET:	that's, that's, that's the way it is and er  •143539_144186•
*FRE:	Yeah. •144208_144216•
*PET:	we'll  I think, be okay and, provided we don't  excessively energetic and too stupid, get too hot in the bath or  that's not a very good thing to do, or crash out with er flu or something  I dare say anyone can crash out, I mean you, you, you could be a president of the United States   •144310_147730•
*FRE:	Exactly    •147730_147736•
*PET:	and be in, in Japan and you can crash out but er •147742_148161•
*FRE:	Yeah. •148161_148176•
*PET:	we'll see how it er  What are your,what are you er er your plans? •148179_148930•
        Are you, are you going on a, a ship again or ? •148942_149107•
*FRE:	No I, I haven't got any plans at the moment, you know I've been sort of er  I usually go around this time you know, er •149107_150258•
*PET:	It it's certainly looking    •150258_150379•
*FRE:	Yeah I've still got swollen fingers which I am er er I've needed as much physio on these as on, on the finger that was done. •150380_151451•
*PET:	Why was that? •151451_151526•
*FRE:	They just swelled up and erm I don't know why but I'm told it's not unusual. •151545_152381•
*PET:	Mm. •152483_152549•
        Because of the, the tinkering around it must do a bit of •152668_152925•
*FRE:	And erm  but as I say I, I, I have, I still haven't got full use of those. •152925_153468•
*PET:	Are they, are they coming? •153468_153967•
*FRE:	Yes I  yes they are er but I seem to have reached a, a stage where they're not  progressing as much as I would like  you know? •153967_155016•
        They're, they're, oh they're vastly improved •155016_155265•
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	to, to, I mean when I first had the er plaster off, which was for ten days it was, I could not believe it that  these fingers were not going  but I'm told that that's quite usual. •155265_156663•
*PET:	Well  it's a very complicated bit of gear and  •156683_157173•
*FRE:	Yeah. •157245_157292•
*PET:	it's been tinkered around with I mean I don't  •157292_157479•
*FRE:	Yes but er I think it's a combination of things, it's the fact that you've got your erm hand in plaster so your fingers are not moving and you lose muscle tone so quickly. •157480_158634•
*PET:	Mm. •158658_158715•
        Particularly with something which is otherwise in  •158715_159087•
*FRE:	Yeah. •159087_159093•
*PET:	almost continuous use •159134_159327•
*FRE:	Ah right. •159327_159362•
*PET:	perhaps not to a very violent er extent but it's, it's, it's moving. •159362_160050•
*FRE:	Yeah that's right, that's right. •160071_160170•
        So er to get to your question erm I've sort of not  been doing anything erm I was hoping that I would be sort of fully fit round about now and then if I saw something on teletext  er that was good I'd just buzz off for a week or so. •160170_162445•
        Cos I  I got one off teletext erm  er it must have been nineteen ninety now  for Tenerife  four star hotel, seven days, East Midlands Airport for one hundred and fifteen pounds  half board er er the following day which was fantastic. •162451_165264•
        I mean everything was good, the flight, the hotel, the weather. •165264_165776•
*PET:	Er and, and these are erm  to fill up the, the exercise, the  •165776_166784•
*FRE:	Yes they're er er •166784_166988•
*PET:	short term •166988_167053•
*FRE:	they're a filling up, the plane, yeah. •167053_167257•
        Filling up the plane and the hotel, spaces that the, this particular company had, yeah. •167346_168053•
        You don't see many like that, I'm not expecting that again. •168290_168566•
*PET:	Well. •168566_168598•
*FRE:	Especially East Midlands Airport, it's very seldom you see an East Midlands Airport bargain. •168661_169202•
        But erm no I shall er •169228_170109•
*PET:	Is, is, is that national  nationally advertised? •170150_170658•
*FRE:	Yes, yes •170658_170804•
*PET:	So   •170834_170870•
*FRE:	so most of them are London Gatwick  or Manchester. •170880_171257•
        Most of them er er that are advertised are from London Gatwick. •171257_171907•
*PET:	So as it were you, you, you turn up  holidays  and you, you, you, you, you scroll through until you •171907_173287•
*FRE:	Yeah. •173287_173321•
        Well they, they, they scroll through themselves, I mean you have no control  er they are on three five two is one of the the numbers and er there, there's probably be about four to six pages which, you know, go er er er you have to wait, I mean they just go through I don't know about twenty seconds perhaps each •173431_175861•
*PET:	Oh so •175937_176041•
*FRE:	page •176041_176061•
*PET:	there, there is time to erm •176061_176325•
*FRE:	Oh and you can hold  if there's one comes up you can hold it. •176325_176643•
*PET:	Oh I see yes, yes. •176693_176756•
*FRE:	Mm. •176830_176839•
        Yeah. •176839_176864•
*PET:	and yes that is, that is quite erm  that is quite erm •176908_177691•
*FRE:	You'd be interested in teletext, you must have a teletext set next time you have a set. •177781_178261•
*PET:	Well yeah I suspect we will but erm  •178261_179030•
*FRE:	I, I don't mean just for holidays, I, I •179202_179389•
*PET:	it seems that an enormous number of people who have got it erm  do  find it er useful. •179389_180733•
        Whether it is er  particularly important to an individual depends on the individual again  •180822_182043•
*FRE:	Mm mm •182043_182067•
*PET:	and er I suspect most people would be  only keeping an eye on the foreign exchange page, you know, when they were thinking about buying   •182067_183167•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah but I mean there's the weather forecast including the local weather forecast erm that you can switch on any time and er  news of course erm oh er er lots and lots. •183175_184822•
        It's, it's amazing how much there is  •184822_185188•
*PET:	Do you get a teletext directory? •185188_185633•
*FRE:	You •185640_185703•
*PET:	Well you know it's gonna be page three five two but how do you know it's page three five two, do you just  •185964_186445•
*FRE:	did, yeah, did ah ah yes but er •186445_186554•
*PET:	do you go through, through  three five one before you got there ? •186616_186883•
*FRE:	Yeah they, they erm  when you switch the teletext on it comes on to a hundred, that's the thing, and, and, and on that a hundred they'll give you  er news one O two or whatever it is, you know, and so on. •186889_188796•
        But also one nine nine is the index of the whole lot. •188918_189355•
*PET:	And, and you, you, you, do you  select Ceefax or, or Oracle? •189413_190472•
        Or •190472_190548•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah you  •190632_190712•
*PET:	does it  •190712_190760•
*FRE:	No er yes,what you do er okay one is B B C One so if you put text on that, then obviously Ceefax will come up. •190760_191943•
*PET:	Yes. •191967_191980•
*FRE:	Now you've got to go back to T V to get •191985_192502•
*PET:	Change to •192502_192590•
*FRE:	to three •192590_192617•
*PET:	I T V •192617_192697•
*FRE:	and then you text for your Oracle. •192702_192902•
*PET:	Oh I see. •192902_192966•
        Cos it's,it's, it's, it's, it's, it's very very clever isn't it? •193164_193968•
*FRE:	It is very clever. •193990_194073•
*PET:	It's, it's  is it two lines the  picture that have got the teletext data on them? •194073_195096•
*FRE:	How do you mean? •195510_195541•
*PET:	Where is it? •195541_195791•
        Where's the information? •195791_196070•
        It must be transmitted •196070_196215•
*FRE:	Ah yes. •196215_196370•
*PET:	and it must be transmitted on •196370_196486•
*FRE:	Yeah •196486_196508•
*PET:	B B C One and I T V  •196616_196872•
*FRE:	it's er on B B C One and B B C Two er •196872_197112•
*PET:	The same? •197199_197213•
*FRE:	I think they are the same but three and four are different. •197213_197580•
        Er B B C Two I think B  er  three and four are different. •197580_198423•
*PET:	Channels •198423_198480•
*FRE:	Four •198522_198553•
*PET:	three and four? •198598_198649•
*FRE:	is different to Oracle •198649_198799•
*PET:	Oracle •198842_198877•
*FRE:	er is well is different to er  er channel three. •198877_199259•
        I think they're probably both Oracle. •199259_199493•
*PET:	Oh so it's just  •199493_200547•
*FRE:	Yeah but in other words what I'm saying is that there are diff  •200547_200872•
*PET:	It's three page hundreds  •200872_200948•
*FRE:	Yeah •200948_201005•
*PET:	that you've got to look at. •201088_201193•
*FRE:	Yes, yes, yes yes. •201193_201428•
        Erm  •201440_201460•
*PET:	So your  •201527_201774•
*FRE:	but but on, no, on your er, no, on your  Oracle er  channel three, one nine nine  what will be shown up on your index will be channel three and channel four •201774_203257•
*PET:	Aha •203270_203284•
*FRE:	so, and, and you will see that's, that er  I don't know whether some are all the same, but erm there are different, yeah, you know, erm  in other words what I'm saying is they're not on both channels. •203426_205062•
*PET:	So they're, I don't know whether it's,it's terribly reactionary to say that we really want one teletext  cos your holidays, might they be coming up on  Ceefax •205062_206805•
*FRE:	No, no,it's it's all  •206983_207272•
*PET:	Oracle  •207296_207310•
*FRE:	Oracle, yeah, cos it's an advertisement, I mean the people who are  er er it is er being paid for by the people who advertise it. •207313_208212•
        Yeah. •208212_208218•
*PET:	Yeah I, I think you'll find  that erm when the  colour er when B B C Two came along and all the aerials went to U H F, we went from a four O five line •208379_210643•
*FRE:	That's right  •210657_210716•
*PET:	to a six two five  •210716_210869•
*FRE:	Something. •210869_210884•
*PET:	line and I think you'll find that now there are in fact six two three lines of television information, and there are two lines which are dedicated to carrying teletext data •210895_212575•
*FRE:	Oh •212647_212664•
*PET:	and I think that's where the , there's no sound is there? •212664_213001•
*FRE:	No, you get the sound of the erm the programme. •213001_213589•
*PET:	Oh really? •213589_213747•
*FRE:	Oh yes, if you, you, no you get the sound, if I erm say I've got Oracle erm channel three on and I switch to text, I will still get the sound of the television programme •213747_215075•
*PET:	Ah I see. •215131_215187•
        Which will be confusing. •215290_215507•
*FRE:	Well you can mute it if you want you see. •215507_215779•
*PET:	Yes of course, yes of course  •215779_215814•
*FRE:	And you can mix it. •215903_216319•
        You, you can have your erm  if you were watching a programme and er, I've done this, erm if you're watching a programme and you want to see what the weather forecast is er you can have that superimposed on your programme. •216319_217757•
        And, and the other way •217757_218090•
*PET:	What in a, in a    •218090_218183•
*FRE:	No, no over the top. •218183_218375•
*PET:	Over the top? •218375_218458•
*FRE:	Over the top. •218458_218537•
*PET:	Oh I see. •218537_218589•
*FRE:	And the other thing erm which er er is good, supposing you're watching er a programme and there's a football match on and you're interested in the, the football  er but you don't really want to keep, you know, switching to find out what the score is, er I'm talking about teletext as opposed to a programme, you press the update and it er and if something's happened, you know, they've changed and there's been a score, it'll come up er  er while you're watching the programme, er it'll let you know that erm there's been something happening. •218589_222267•
        Er it's, it's amazing. •222316_222612•
*PET:	I don't know what that is. •222671_222806•
        It's not you is it? •222806_223851•
*FRE:	It isn't, no. •223886_224140•
        Is it, it's not your er central heating is it? •224140_224427•
*PET:	Ah  might be. •224427_224700•
        It might be. •224886_224920•
        Yes that, that sounds like it. •225114_225598•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •225598_225801•
*PET:	Yes the erm  these things,and can you er can you record  teletext? •225888_226647•
*FRE:	No, I tried that the other day. •226951_227183•
        No. •227183_227216•
        er you're talking about video? •227371_227988•
*PET:	Yeah. •228032_228053•
*FRE:	Yeah. •228053_228072•
*PET:	And if you're playing a tape back  which was recorded off air  what happens if you push the text button? •228134_229402•
*FRE:	Don't know. •229410_230101•
*PET:	Because the data, you see, the two lines, I would have thought would have been recorded •230101_230937•
*FRE:	 ((sigh)) 
*PET:	without you meaning it to be recorded  •230961_231467•
*FRE:	Ah well I can let me er say this, er  you, you know how some programmes er you can have erm  oh you may not know   excuse me  erm there are certain programmes which you can er put in eight eight eight and you get captions •231467_233896•
*PET:	Ah yes,if that's available. •233916_234173•
*FRE:	If it's available. •234251_234335•
*PET:	Yes, yes. •234335_234389•
*FRE:	Erm now if you record that programme and then, on video, and then play it back you can't put in eight eight eight and get it. •234488_235757•
*PET:	Oh. •235757_235772•
        Mm it, I, I, I, I I dunno as I say it, it, it seems to me to be an incredibly clever •236606_237084•
*FRE:	You would enjoy it. •237346_237497•
*PET:	arrangement. •237497_237521•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah  •237525_237597•
*PET:	But erm    The television of course is infernally clever, I mean there's er no doubt that the microchips that erm  takes away the erm the teletext information, stores it and then spits up whatever you ask for is er  two or three P now I suppose and therefore the, the television manufacturer charges hundred pounds to put it in. •237597_241658•
*FRE:	Mm. •241685_241697•
*PET:	It's er  it's   you're, you're, you're, you're quite erm  hooked on it? •241738_242641•
*FRE:	Ah well yes I wouldn't like to be without it now. •242641_242916•
        Definitely not. •242916_243117•
*PET:	And is, is there much difference between er Ceefax and Oracle? •243117_243929•
*FRE:	Well  •243933_243948•
*PET:	They look more or less the same do they? •244337_244617•
*FRE:	Yeah I mean the news is very similar of course erm •244636_245027•
*PET:	Presumably that's indicated  or is it? •245058_245428•
        Dunno because I think it isn't actually come to think of it  B B C will do their own and I T V will do their own   •245428_246083•
*FRE:	Oh yeah oh it's definitely their own, yes. •246083_246308•
        Yeah. •246308_246343•
        Yeah. •246388_246401•
        So I'm a bit of a newshound so I look at both of course, see what's what. •246791_247225•
        I'm er I'm not saying I, the headlines you see, so I will select the headline I'm interested in. •247225_247972•
*PET:	And would •247972_248352•
*FRE:	And then it'll come up, you know, I'll put in er one O two is the headlines for Ceefax for instance and then the stories will be from one O three to about one one five or something like that you see. •248403_249888•
        And er  so er if I'm interested in er George Bush's illness, you know, and that's one O four I'll put in one O four and then that will come up on the screen. •250020_251113•
*PET:	So presumably  what bank are you with? •251119_251931•
*FRE:	What  I'm with Barclays. •251965_252334•
*PET:	Oh  I suspect they're  you bank with  totally ignorable. •252334_253080•
        If you're with er National Westminster  erm  you, you, you know about these, these, these  cash tills that you put a card in and •253080_254584•
*FRE:	Yeah. •254710_254718•
*PET:	ask it questions, it's obviously on the telephone  because you can ask what the balance is and it will tell you, and it can't possibly know that  and Cleethorpes, when you put the card in the Cleethorpes thing, that, you know, your bank balance at Nottingham is  so it's obviously on the telephone erm and it's on the telephone to a central computer which holds quite a lot of information, it accesses  •254757_257442•
*FRE:	Quite. •257442_257463•
*PET:	it very very quickly •257463_257593•
*FRE:	That's right, yeah. •257593_257680•
*PET:	so  why shouldn't you telephone that computer? •257680_258094•
        And the answer is, no reason at all. •258100_258446•
        And if you're with National Westminster, you telephone a, a a number in Manchester or Birmingham or two or three other places I guess but as far as we're concerned er the Birmingham Manchester one's the cheapest  you, you ring them up and you give them A your identification number  and it immediately tells you what your balance is. •258492_261429•
        Immediately. •261473_261501•
        What do you want to do? •261559_261819•
        Well of course there's a whole range of things you can order, you know, chequebooks and bank statements, you can do all all sorts of things  •261819_262545•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah. •262561_262593•
*PET:	you can do with the till in the wall •262593_262948•
*FRE:	Yeah. •262948_263002•
*PET:	but you can also say I want a transaction too and the machine then comes back to you with one of these sepulchral voices, you know, which is tone  •263002_264148•
*FRE:	Yes  •264194_264210•
*PET:	generated or whatever, who do you wish to pay to, and  we have four erm electricity board, the gas board, the er er er  credit card and the, can't remember what the fourth one is, you simply say I wanna  pay number four  how much do you wish to pay to the Royal Bank of Scotland  and you say how much you wish to pay in, er in pence  and it immediately says you wish to pay blah blah blah  it will be done. •264210_268510•
        Couple of days later a little note comes in the post saying that you've just paid the National National Bank  Bank of Scotland  twenty three pounds thirty  and it's absolutely brilliant! •268510_269725•
        Barclays haven't got one yet? •269801_270256•
*FRE:	Well er er I think not because I would have heard, I mean obviously they would've er  •270258_270734•
*PET:	Well er Nat West have been very quiet about Action Line erm because they haven't quite got the  the, the, all the  firmware sorted out yet but it's absolutely fantastic, you know  •270749_272364•
*FRE:	Mm  •272364_272385•
*PET:	it's just, just  erm  but er er have you got a, a tone telephone or a pulse telephone? •272385_273090•
        It's probably a switch  •273183_273646•
*FRE:	I've got several  •273646_273697•
*PET:	Well erm probably on the back you can select whether it er sends a number by  pulse, and you can tell actually cos it's very  you you'll dial   •273697_275422•
*FRE:	Well the old dial was pulse  was  •275424_275587•
*PET:	The twiddle dial? •275658_275868•
*FRE:	Yeah. •275868_275901•
*PET:	Oh yes •275901_275947•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •275947_275997•
*PET:	but some push button telephones send  one as one pulse  and two as two pulses •276024_277033•
*FRE:	Yes. •277033_277078•
*PET:	whereas others send er one as a beep and two as a ooh •277099_277691•
*FRE:	Ah •277706_277723•
*PET:	in other words the pitch of the  •277723_278037•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. •278037_278089•
        I think mine are erm the pulse type, mm. •278153_278430•
*PET:	Well usually erm modern telephones have got a switch on the back and you can switch them to pulse or tone •278505_279167•
*FRE:	Oh? •279167_279170•
        I don't think mine have. •279258_279443•
*PET:	One of those four switches across the top is the pulse tone. •279875_280327•
*FRE:	Oh yeah I can see that. •280411_280503•
        Yeah. •281224_281234•
*PET:	But erm you bleep with one, one of ours is, is, is erm on  tones now and you can tell the you, you, you can tell •281265_282322•
