*DAV:	I want the phone bill to lob into them as well, but I ain't got one •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	all round the trees, like that woman did with her husband  cos she, she was a bit of a lunatic and er •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	and er so one night she gave him, come in a bit paralytic, wanted a drink, so she give him a drink with a load of tranquillisers in •_•
*CLI:	Mm, mm •_•
*DAV:	he passed out that killed him and found him in the garden, it took four years to find him •_•
*FLO:	really? •_•
*DAV:	Whenever, anybody asked where he was, oh he was abroad working abroad •_•
*FLO:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLI:	Oh those trees will grow really quick anyway, cos they're so many goodness in the ground in their garden, it's bloody amazing never think to •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CLI:	and I reckon what it is they spray the fields with all this stuff •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CLI:	and all that lot, yeah, and then when it, when it rains you see cos it's a lot of clay •_•
*DAV:	It can't be washed away so easy •_•
*CLI:	Yeah it does, it all washes down into the garden you see cos the garden's on a slope and the field, the field slopes straight into the garden, and when we have, when we really have lots and lots of rain, you look out your back windows and there's about that much lying there, cos it's running down and it can't get past the houses, so it just builds up and floods •_•
*DAV:	Yeah, I shall make sure the er path between your houses is lower than anything else, so it takes it away •_•
*FRE:	Mm, my patio's going down there •_•
*DAV:	Oh you can't •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	patios •_•
*FRE:	No, it'll be alright •_•
*DAV:	Mm, you wait until we have that heavy rain •_•
*FRE:	Er want, it want •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	by the time I spent just •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	it's gonna be flat to the, and I'm gonna build a wall about two foot high and level the garden •_•
*DAV:	Yeah •_•
*FRE:	and level with the top of the garden •_•
*DAV:	Yeah •_•
*FRE:	so it'll all be level so that  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah, it'll still come down though won't it? •_•
*FRE:	No it wouldn't, can't, can't not at the ground level, it will sit at the top •_•
*DAV:	No it won't, no it won't, seep through earth eventually •_•
*FRE:	No, but it wouldn't seep through that wall though will it? •_•
*DAV:	No it'll go round it, won't it? •_•
        Down it or under it •_•
*FRE:	It'll go in next door's garden then, mm •_•
*DAV:	It'll either go round it or under it won't it? •_•
*FRE:	Mm •_•
*DAV:	What about size, •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	right up to the house innit? •_•
*FRE:	Mm •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	right up to the house •_•
*FRE:	Mm •_•
*DAV:	the patio, not the wall •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	No •_•
*DAV:	you can either go round it or, or under it •_•
*FRE:	the wall just going to go straight across the garden •_•
*DAV:	Yeah, what are you gonna have some steps up? •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, steps in the middle, yeah •_•
*DAV:	That's it and that's where the water will come through •_•
*FRE:	No •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	come down them steps and straight through your house •_•
*FRE:	Er, er, er I'm going to put a drain in anyway, in the middle of the patio •_•
*DAV:	Yeah, but where? •_•
*FRE:	What? •_•
*DAV:	Where you gonna •_•
*FRE:	Into the sewer, cos there's a drain bit just where the patio's gonna be and the drain what comes out the outfill •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	the washing machine away •_•
*DAV:	Yeah •_•
*FRE:	and I just have, well •_•
*DAV:	put another pipe in •_•
*FRE:	just put another pipe in it  knock a couple of bricks out and knock a pipe in and that's •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	no I didn't want to leave a little, only want to leave a proper little drain things, you know  •_•
*DAV:	It's probably a six high inch pipe underneath there I should think  •_•
*FRE:	Mind you, them, actually they •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	straight underneath the back door •_•
*DAV:	Then they all go along the back •_•
*FRE:	Mm •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	with them along the back •_•
*FRE:	Mm •_•
*DAV:	I ain't worked out how the sewers •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	goes to the •_•
*FRE:	Mm •_•
*DAV:	I think it goes underground , our next door neighbour's house, and out, the only •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	we've got, is at the back of the house right, and then it goes up there, then that is the houses and it goes down to the sewer in the road, so er •_•
*FRE:	I didn't know •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	no, no, no, that's what I can't understand, no I think it's about a hundred years old you see, probably •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	erm thinking about sewers ain't they? •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah, probably not, it'll pocket out the window job •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	mm •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	so as long as they er didn't actually have •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	You had toilets out in the garden, didn't you? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah, that's why you see, we've converted, put a wall up where the door were and knocked the wall down and had a door into the house  •_•
*FRE:	That's chaos that is •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	innit? •_•
