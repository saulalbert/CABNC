@Comment:	conversation #92 (Tape 010805)
*TON:	Yes, one or two. •113671_113797•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah. •114277_114297•
        Erm  Oh I was just trying to remember what, what was said. •114297_115278•
        Something to do with  Ah Jerry said something quite good about  availability. •115390_116386•
        Erm  like you can't  although people will go for jobs, now produce proof of jobs they've applied for. •116503_117278•
        You can't tell whether they really want the jobs or not. •117371_117842•
*MAR:	Yeah. •117883_117892•
*TON:	And and it is  •117892_117933•
*MAR:	So they're actually seeking  then? •117933_118129•
*TON:	Yeah. •118419_118429•
*MAR:	Well I suppose not really. •118429_118574•
*TON:	No. •118599_118624•
        It shows that they've applied for the job. •118624_118804•
        It doesn't show that they wanted it. •118804_118972•
*TON:	Yeah. •119025_119036•
*TON:	They really tried. •119036_119122•
*TON:	Yeah. •119150_119160•
        There's no way you  can know that unless you've got the  from the Job Centre that these  •119161_119552•
*TON:	And gives feedback on how they turned up and  •119631_119964•
*TON:	Yeah. •119964_119970•
*TON:	and all this sort of thing. •119970_120068•
*TON:	Yeah. •120172_120186•
*TON:	But er •120213_120290•
*TON:	That's what really makes •120291_120409•
*TON:	something, something very odd came out of that, this Ann  said something I thought  what? •120409_121255•
*TON:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	And  and the thing is I didn't understand it. •121420_121738•
        So it's quite difficult to remember exactly what she said. •121738_122574•
*TON:	Mm. •122607_122621•
*TON:	Erm  something to do with  no. •122944_123116•
        I can't think. •123116_123175•
        Trouble is when you don't understand it it doesn't sink in. •123178_123773•
*TON:	No that's right. •123826_123908•
*TON:	But everybody sort of. •123908_123985•
        I remembered   •124045_124230•
*TON:	 (        ) 
*TON:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Have you? •124288_124305•
*TON:	Yeah. •124305_124320•
        It's a bit like a single office group. •124321_124606•
        sitting in and we're trying to split them up cos we don't want too   •124606_125201•
*TON:	Yeah. •125201_125221•
*TON:	Which, which they did. •125221_125336•
        But they've gone back now to sitting altogether. •125430_125931•
        So. •_•
