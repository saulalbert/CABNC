@Comment:	conversation #14 (Tape 069503)
*ANN:	Are you ready for your dinner?I've made the tea. (.) I forgot to put those in the freezer. (.) I think I'll do the bedrooms this afternoon.
*JAM:	Especially Bry Bryony's bedroom. (.) And those begonias are doing well now.
*ANN:	Which?Where?In the front room?
*JAM:	Yes.
*ANN:	How many have grown?
*JAM:	Er 
*ANN:	Sometimes you look at them. (.) It doesn't matter, you don't need to look.Get on with your dinner!You'll be late.
*JAM:	Mm. (.) There's four in the sitting room, there's one well advanced that's doi doing quite well, there's one upstairs that's just about ready for   (.) er, repotting, and there are   (.) two more that have sprouts on.Only   (        ) 
*ANN:	So that's seven out of ten, was it?
*JAM:	Oh yeah.Yeah.About seven.
*ANN:	Well that's not bad for one ninety nine.There's erm   (.) I know they'd be, probably be better quality   (.) but there are   (.) nine, I think it is, advertised in   (.) today's paper that say, erm for er eleven ninety nine. (.) So even, we get   (.) seven for one ninety nine, it's a bargain.
*JAM:	Depends what they flower like though.
*ANN:	I hope they're different colours.
*JAM:	And how long they last. (.) And if we
*ANN:	Well they go on flowering for quite, you you've got 
*JAM:	No, no, I mean, how long   (.) you put 
*ANN:	Oh yeah, you'll have to le leave the children's.
*JAM:	I know that.But   (.) if we keep them for the next ten years they're a   (.) a real bargain, if, if, if 
*ANN:	Aha.
*JAM:	they're all no good next year, well   (.) it'll be just a   (.) an ordinary bargain.
*ANN:	I don't think, I dunno   (.) that   (.) I wonder if we should put some gravel under that umb umbrella tree. (.) Or if it should even be near that radiator.In Australia, you know they grow into great big huge trees in Australia, Mrs  told me.
*JAM:	Yes.
*ANN:	She said er, Derek   (.) has them in his garden.
*JAM:	Well it's a bit better climate out there.Well I don't know if it's a better climate, but it's a warmer climate.
*ANN:	Well it must get hotter   (.) than it does in this house for a start!
*JAM:	It is hotter.
*ANN:	I was freezing last night in bed!And you were snoring.
*JAM:	So were you.
*ANN:	I hardly got any sleep last night, my head was aching so much.

*ANN:	How many staff have you got off?
*JAM:	I'm not sure, everyone's off sick.
*ANN:	Mm.Will you be home late?
*JAM:	I don't think so.
*ANN:	Mm.Have you checked the television pages?Is there any wildlife programmes or anything you want me to   (.) oh hold on, I've got it here. (.) Er

*ANN:	The Messiah?
*JAM:	And the original version from Dublin.
*ANN:	The Messiah, the Messiah in Dublin   (.) seven forty five tomorrow.
