*PHI:	Shoppers creche   (.) that must   (.) er, registered.  (.) What does registration mean? It means that when you go along to the social services, register and it's above board   (.) children's work that you are doing.  (.) But they have a right   (.) within the law   (.) to carry out, to check all persons who are offering help in caring.  (.) And registration may be denied anyone who has been convicted of any certain types of offense.  (.) It's the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that all those leading groups   (.) are people of good standing.  (.) The church must make every effort to   (.) achieve the highest standards.  (.) And the church as   (  ) bible road to fame   (.) in alerting us to   (.) our responsibilities.  (.) Now there's one thing that I have to alert us all to   (.) the rest may not have been important, perhaps only to some of   (.) the larger churches   (.) but groups are advised   (.) and churches are advised to make sure that in buildings that are used   (.) ah, for many different groups   (.) that young children under the age of eight   (.) do not come into contact with any casual   (.) people who may be using that building.  (.) Now that is quite an implication when you think about it!  (.) There is need to emphasise the importance of   (.) encouraging people to re  , receive some sort of training when they come forward and offer to be involved   (.) in the work of our under eights and young people. I don't think there's any need for me to spell out any more at this point what that may mean   (.) but the   (.) responsibility in   (  ) as churches to ensure that we care for the under eights. I will, in fact erm   (.) answer any questions afterwards. 
*UNK:	Thank you Nanette. An introduction that is important. There are   (  ) a number ar  , of areas in the ma  state legislation that have been aligned to the church, or will affect the running of the church. One is the children act   (.) one will be something on   (.) on on the   (.) preparation of food, another will be one affecting the way in which   (.) charities have to keep   (.) registered accounts   (.) er, financial accounts   (.) which means that   (.) an example   (.) erm    (.)  (  ) is responsible   (.) for registering the accounts of congregations   (.) by law. And another will be   (.) erm   (.) the responsibility to   (.) er, the minister, the   (.) alterations to listed buildings   (.) which   (.) might be landed on the, on the churches. What Nanette has said has been an important introduction and if yo  , if what sa  you have prepared altogether   (.) is legible then perhaps   (.) give it to Eileen and it can go out in the Synod papers   (.) that will be helpful. Erm, and in the faith and life   (.) department of URC we'd better preparing a pack on the children rights. Other information on whatever  (  ) .  (.) We move now    (  )  (.) we move now to er, faith and life   (.) is on   (.) we're on page   (.) thirty five.  (.)  (  ) moderator and friends   (  ) of faith and life.  (.) In the very short   (.) space of time that we have   (.) available this afternoon   (.) there are three subjects that I need   (.) simply to bring to the attention of Synod. The first the little report   (.) under the heading of faith and life, on page five   (.) of your reports   (.) the   (.) second   (.) is the report of the provincial advocate which is on page six   (.) and the third, the report of the Youth Secretary which is on page twenty. Erm   (.) all those because subjects come under the general umbrella of faith and life, and I think   (.) er, moderator, probably the correct thing is to do   (.) is to be formal and to begin by   (.) er, proposing that these three reports be received for discussion. 
*UNK:	Then I'll receive the reports of faith and life   (.) and the   (  ) Youth Secretary and   (.) the new secretary for discussion, yes. 
*UNK:	Thank you. Er, to take then   (.) first the report which you will find on page five   (.) you will see that faith and life on this occasion has concentrated on one subject   (.) and that is our    (  )   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	weekend that we are   (.) arranging this summer as we have done annually for a number of years.  (.) Er, there is a   (.) a little orange leaflet which has been placed on the seats   (.) during the day   (.) that many of you, I hope, already have   (.) er, for anyone who hasn't   (.) may I   (.) perhaps place these   (.) on the front table, there's a   (.) the  , there's another supply over there and, could I please ask that   (.) some responsible representative from each district would please take a few more of these away with you so that they are distributed in district meetings   (.) in the near future, and attention drawn to them there   (.) er, if there are not enough copies   (.) er, then I'm sure the provincial office on receiving a, a request from you will make sure there's more    (  )  (.) that passed on to you. Now, if you had an opportunity of glancing at the leaflet already you will have seen that the leader   (.) for this July's   (.) er, (  ) weekend is is Mr Henry     (.) and, I don't think I can do any better than to spend two minutes of the time that we've got in asking Henry if he would   (.) say a word or two of introduction to the theme   (.) for this year. 
*UNK:	Ignatius of Loyal er or     (.)  (  )  (.) er, more   (.) properly known   (.) to me in church history was the scourge of the wrath of the, of the council of reformation and   (  ) inside of consumism but   (.) I think regards some years ago in   (  ) on Ignatius spirituality of   (  ) bibles   (.) which I'm delighted to see John has mentioned in his prologue for the er   (.) for his introduction to Holywell the the the association's there   (.) came to discover who   (.) Saint Ignatius   (.) er, helping to sort of tap greater spiritual depths and er   (.) resources   (.) and consequently trained as spiritual director   (.) er   (.) in Ignatian things. The spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyala have once, were once described as a sort of a spiritual   (  ) from which people of past    (.)  (  ) men, put together again. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Erm   (.) that is not the aim of Trabecca  
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Er, to start off with they do the full spiritual exercise of Ignatius Loyal all takes thirty days in silent retreat   (.) with a   (.) with an individual   (.) er   (.) under individual guidance with a, with a, a director   (.) or   (.) it could take anything from nine months to eighteen months to do   (.) in er day   (.) da  da  da   (  ) living   (.) in open sort of retreat. What I hope to do is simply   (.) to share with you the life of Idigo  (.) and in experiences   (.) and to walk alongside him   (.) and also to help us reflectively to look   (.) and examine our own journey   (.) where are we with God? Where's God in our life, where has he been and where is he directing us? And so it'll be a gentle, I hope and   (.) er, reflective   (.) type of weekend   (.) and er   (.) using some of the tools of Ignatius   (.) and other tools, cos Ignatius was very   (.) er, adaptable   (.) er, you know in   (.) in methods of prayer   (.) and reflection and contemplation.  (.) I, (  ) . 
*UNK:	Thank you. And I I, I hope that I, I hope there's a good variety of people will again, as you always have done   (.) will turn up   (.) er, this year to share fellowship   (.) a  , on this   (.) theme which er, is   (.) is a refresh theme I think for, for many of us.  (.) Now, the other two subjects I'm really only dealing because the   (.) people responsible are, are not   (.) here in the flesh this afternoon   (.) but Alyd   the provincial advocate and I I think of Bill   that's also gone too, er yes he he has, he has had to leave   (.) this afternoon.  (.) Erm, so what I promised to do in er   (.) er, a moment or two if people are to ask specific questions or comments to make   (.) arising from either of those   (.) printed reports on page six and page twenty   (.) erm, if you would make your point or ask your question   (.) now   (.) er, it will be recorded and transmitted to the officers responsible and they will take any necessary action or give any   (.) reverent replies to those questions.  (.) This doesn't preclude any private questions in conversation with those people at any stage during the life of the church. So if, if there are any formal concerns that anybody would wish to bring   (.) formally   (.) before Synod and erm to either   (.) Alyd   or Bill   then perhaps   (.) state them.  (.) Right. 
*UNK:	Right, yes I shall happy to convey to the moderator that Synod was er   (.) totally satisfied with the reports that are here before me and give them one hundred percent support in the work  (  ) . Thank you. 
*UNK:	Bill   is   (.) is erm   (.) with the group of young people who are   (.) having a weekend in  (  ) . Er, those were the people that   (.) walked in and walked out! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	We come now to the final committee report which is on page thirteen   (.) of the   (.) page thirteen.  (14.0) Did you want to stand up for a minute? 
*PHI:	Yes. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	While you're stood up   (.) while you're stood up have a second   (.) and   (.) well each   (  ) worship, right? Come on stand up!  (.) Stand up! Up!  (.) Erm   (.) is Benny here?  (.) No.  (.) Well it's very simple, who knows the Peruvian Glory? 
*UNK:	Woops! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Will you please come here with me.  (.) Erm, who else knows it? 
*UNK:	  (  )  
*UNK:	  (  )  thank you. Anybody else know it?  (.) So this is how it goes. 
*UNK:	I think so! 
*UNK:	I think it goes   (.) I'm not sure. 
*UNK:	Have we got an organ in here? 
*PHI:	Yes, I think   (  ) . 
*UNK:	  ((cough))   ((organ music))
*UNK:	Okay, sing that. 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) Glory to God, Glory to God  
*UNK:	Right. ((organ music)) 
*UNK:	That's glory in the highest. 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) glory in the highest  
*UNK:	The next line is to God be glory forever. ((organ music)) 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) To God be glory forever  
*UNK:	And then le   (.) lastly, line halleluja amen. ((organ music)) 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen  
*UNK:	Are we there? 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	You know  it? 
*UNK:	 Yeah. 
*UNK:	 Okay   
*PHI:	  ((laugh))  
*UNK:	and for the closing worship   (.) you will be the  (  )  
*UNK:	Oh! 
*UNK:	and the rest of you will be the people. Okay?  (.) So the   (  ) sings the first line   (.) erm   (.) you know, Glory to God   (.) glory to God in highest   (.) and then you respond   (.) and then you sing   (.) to God be the glory, to God be the glory   (.) and you respond. And then you sing   (.) halleluja   (.) and we all sing halleluja, halleluja, halleluja   (.) okay? 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) Glory to God,Glor   ((laugh))  
*UNK:	Five seconds.  (.)  (  ) . (.) Erm  ((organ music)) 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest  
*UNK:	Right. 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest   (.) to God be glory forever, to God be glory forever, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen . 
*UNK:	Once more bit faster. 
*UNK:	 ((singing)) Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest, Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest, to God be glory forever, to God be glory forever, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen . 
*UNK:	High notes! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Very good! 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Well I must admit I'm gonna have to   (.) present a   (.) finance report which is received by an overture. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	And   (.) first of all   (.) before we er   (.) we put the reports we  (  ) , there are a number of er, there's one alteration and a number of er, additions   (.) obviously alteration or I should say a a  an amendment is something   (  ) an important place on page fifteen   (.) er, at the tope of the page referring to   (  ) December nineteen ninety two   (.) I've put, which is agreed by GP committee   (.) with the exception of young   (.) these representatives, that we ask them to bring thirty pounds towards the cost   (.) that should be twenty five.  (.) That's the actual figure.  (.) Erm   (.) one difficulty with with   (.) giving a financial report is so many things seem to   (.) happen quickly   (.) and a erm   (.) apart from the fact that there was a, a major finance resources comes from    (  )  (.) we  , as well you see   (.) that I have to tell you now   (.) these have been done   (.) on the   (.) red letter assembly side   (.) and you may want to alter one   (  ) there   (.) er   (.) according to reform   (.) I see the cost per   (.) erm   (.) person attending   (.) is not a hundred and twelve pounds, but a hundred and fourteen pounds   (.) and that means that we have forty representatives we've got to try and find four thousand five hundred and sixty  (  ) . Now, I hope I've got these facts right and I'm sure   (.) that not, that Eileen may correct me that er   (.) we have er forty hundred pounds in the budget, (  ) budget   (.) for this   (.) er the erm South Wales congregation   (  ) has, has kindly   (.) erm   (.) given us grant of a thousand pounds   (.) and I understand from the secretary of con  , Cardiff congregation  (  ) , and he's also offered a thousand pounds   (.) I don't know whether   (.) we've got that yet? But then   (.)  (  )  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	That will be, it is thousand so that's er   (.) that's three thousand four hundred   (.) short of a four by sixty. And what the difference is that   (.) er, we thought that you could have one young person per district   (.) and that they only have to pay thirty two pounds each, but I think these are only purely 
*UNK:	Yes, er, I have them   (.) for those who   (.) received that incorrect information from me, I must apologise   (.) erm   (.) young people who are going   (.) as delegates   (.) as representatives of their district must be treated   (.) as adult   (.) representatives and they have to pay full price.  (.) Er   (.) for   (.)  (  ) , for people who are going to   (  ) group   (.) and and, for any young people who are going observers   (.) there are special arrangements to be made which doesn't relate to our official represented district, I'm sorry about that! 
*UNK:	So that means that er, in   (.) th  the total we do have to pay   (.) in some way or another, is four thousand pounds with sixty   (.) but we'll say   (.) we've already got three thousand four hundred, if all the for  , forty people go and they pay twenty five pounds each, that's another thousand, so we've got a   (.) I think I've got it right,a  , we're only a hundred and sixty short. Fairly reasonable! I hope we get that from somewhere.  (.) So er er that   (.) that is if we're up-to-date on the financial  (  ) . Now, the most   (.) er, serious business   (.) the er, Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety two   (.) and the Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety three. At the meeting   (.) er, of the   (.) Financial Resources Committee that I attended on Wednesday   (.) the first thing we discussed was the   (.) er   (.) the giving so far, up to the end of February   (.) from the various provinces   (.) and we, by the end of February   (.) er, the total was up to thirty thousand pounds less than we required   (.) er   (.) which could mean that   (.) the end of the year   (.) it could be a hundred and eighty thousand pounds less than required   (.) but   (.) er   (.) of all the    (  )   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	all the provinces, bar one   (.) have balances which could be used to make that up, so   (.) the money is fairly short and we're bear   (.) er, for pains, the    (  )   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	ten and a half thousand   (.) from the first of July onwards for this year. Now   (.) erm   (.) i  i  in Wales, and I'm sorry to say, our figure   (.) er, we should of produced ninety thousand pounds   (.) and we provi  , er, produced   (.) er, eighty three thousand two hundred and nine   (.) that means we are   (.) er, six thousand eight hundred down in two months! Now, we have a balance as it already tells you   (.) er, in er earlier in the paragraph of this paper that that we had a er balance of sixteen thousand pounds   (.) a  , in the   (  ) ministry last year   (.) so, if we knock sixteen thousand pounds    (  )   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	what we're likely to   (.) be short of   (.) it seems to me we could end up being twenty four thousand pounds short at the end of the year. Now, there are quite a number of reasons for this   (.) and the good news, I think, that I bought good news again this morning   (.) is that presentations both about budgets   (.) er, and about what we do wi  with the small churches   (.) is, er, could be some of our salvation. Question of budgets   (.) our    (  )  (.) I was almost   (  ) said halleluja! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	If only, all our churches could do that   (.) we would really be getting somewhere! The biggest problem of all   (.) is that we can't look forward   (.) and that a lot of the problems, being problems are happening now, and happened since   (.) the er   (.) the first of January   (.) that should of happened   (.) they should of happened in th  , in th  , in the er at least the three months before the end of last year, if not more! So, er, we're getting people saying it's impossible to pay this   (.) even though they were asked if they could pay it   (.) at the the the time it was given   (.) sometime last July. Well that's one   (.) the other reason, of course we have got   (.) a large number of chur  , very small churches   (.) in fact, looking at our mai  , ministry figures nineteen ninety   (.) there were thirty churches that didn't pay anything to the maintenance   (.) and a lot of these, I think, maybe    (  )   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	that both   (.) Gethwyn and Russell sorted out   (.) er   (.) who up   (.) on on those extremes that   (.) you get in a group   (.) that, that maybe feel they re   (.) that they really have nothing to, hardly anything to do with us   (.) they've don't receive ministry   (.) and why should that be, and after be asked each year, has to go up? And they see   (.) o   (.) I just wonder whether they just pile letters in the wastepaper basket! And therefore, if it can really come to this possibility of ministry   (.) a sort of, Young Farmers Club idea of getting themselves about   (.) that could be   (.) a a a a, a, a marvellous boost. So, the, the other thing which is er erm, a real problem, partly because of that, is, is when one talks about an increase in   (.) in giving, increase in percentage i  , or a contribution of the church is   (.) in er, we were talking about twenty percent la  , twenty one percent last year   (.) that would be alright if everybody gave twenty one percent! Those who did nothing, they can eas  , easily increase their giving by twenty one percent, it's still the same! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	It means   (.) that the other people have to give more   (.) that's why some of the churches, I think they've found that their   (.) er, requests for their er   (.) er   (.) their er contributions, have gone up enormously! So, er, those are the pro  , those are a lot of the problems that we are, we are facing   (.) now, will we really   (.) er   (.) will we end up at twenty four thousand down at the end of the year? That i  , all I can say is that my, that's my best guess at the moment. We know there are some churches which er, will probably only pay quarterly, so they haven't paid yet, so that's money that's coming in. On the other hand we know there are some churches that are finding great difficulty in meeting   (.) er, what they've  said they can   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	and are doing their best to do it. So that's on the down side. So   (.) er, at the moment they're saying   (.) all I can see   (.) is that er, we would have to use up the whole of our balance, that's sixteen thousand   (.) and the twenty four thousand arrears. Now, that as the picture   (.) er, leads me onto the next er, stage which is what in ministry, er what can we do in nineteen ninety three? Erm   (.) a letter was sent to all district secretaries, who I think in mo  , most cases sent these round to churches to see if we could get some idea from you as to what sort of increase in contributions could be possible for nineteen ninety three. That's quite difficult to do because where there's so many churches not being sure whether they're going to make it this year   (.) how can they say what's going to happen next year? On the other hand   (.) er, if we did what our friend from Cheltenham is doing   (.) we would have lo  , we would be looking forward like that all the time   (.) we would have some idea. Now, I'm pleased to say we have had quite a number of   (.) of er   (.) replies from churches   (.) on what they think they can d  , do. On the other hand, some of these er   (.) are good   (.) re  positive replies and some of them, some are negative! And, it seemed to me   (.) that when I, as the er   (.) your representative on Provincial Finance Committee is asked to make a co  , commitment for this, for this    (  )  (.) for   (.) er   (.) for nineteen ninety three I could say no better than what we had as out target this year and   (.) that was hard! Cos clearly we've only er   (.) reached something like five hundred, three thousand, four thousand   (.) er   (.) then it's gonna be a   (.) a big jump to get to the five hundred and forty! Now, nobody er   (.) er,a  at this stage at the er   (.) Financial Resources Committee er, challenge us on this figure, I think we will just   (  ) stage of   (.) of doing arith  arithmetic of adding it up, but no doubt that the staff will be   (.) comparing what going to be, er what within a   (.) but have prepared   (  ) for next year with what we're supposed to do this year   (.) and ours is an increase of another percent.  (.) We look at all the other conferences, the lowest after that was the Northern Provence which is in a very similar position to ourselves   (.) and they were offering a five percent increase. Er, a few others were offering seven to nine   (.) and most of the others were offering between ten and fifteen percent. So we're way down on all the others! (  ) so, that then falls three hundred thousand pound short   (.) of what is required to   (.) er, give ministers an increase to twelve thousand next year. There seem to be   (.) our two groups er, in one of our provinces   (.) and they say that the rich and poor but the rich   (.) er er are not so rich and others   (.)  (  ) . That, in fact, er   (.) there are three provinces who are already now contributing more than anyone else   (.) that, they feel that the churches should go forward to try and raise the minister's   (  ) to what was proposedly that the   (.) assembly last year, they should be paid thirteen thousand two hundred   (.) but in order to do that   (.) see another six hundred thousand pound raised   (.) and it is likely that this will be put as a challenge to the churches   (.) at assembly. Now   (.) if I could just remind you of what's happened at the Lyndford Haven  (.) er   (.) er, Synod, last March   (.) erm, the Financial Committee have suggested that we should go for a target of five hundred and ten thousand   (.) but   (.) er, this is   (.) we are not gonna be able to   (.) even start looking at the eleven and a half thousand if if er   (.) all the provinces do it for months and more   (.) and we, I think very bravely or foolishly whatever way you li  , look at it, proposed that we should got to five hundred and forty thousand   (.) and it looks as thought we're gonna end up   (.) certainly nearer to five ten than five forty. Erm, but if we er are are going to   (.) en   (.) ensure that ministers can get   (.) er, at least twelve a   (  ) of twelve thousand next year then we have to er   (.) erm   (.) there has to be further offers from provinces. As I say, there are three provinces who'd like to go further   (.) and than that be even   (.) er, more increases. Now, I have   (.) put down reports   (.) about the finance committee   (.) er   (  ) as it were but I think the responses from the churches and districts    (.)  (  ) sort of calculator will be there, we think that it would seem as though we should only offer the same amount as last year. But, I think if we have further discussions with churches and districts that we might see that we can break that   (.) a bit further   (.) for that reason when we come to   (.) er, come to the resolutions I would advise you   (.) er er propose a minor amendment with the second thing.  (.) But I think that   (.) er  (  ) . 
*UNK:	We can now receive this report for the  (  ) .  (.) Any questions or comments on   (.) paragraphs that are not erm   (.) relating to those  (  ) ? So any questions or comments on paragraph one   (.) on page thirteen?  (.) Or paragraph two   (.) or paragraph three   (.) or paragraph five   (.) or paragraph   (.) that's it! Yes.  (.) So, if there are no questions or comments on those paragraphs   (.) erm we move to the other resolutions. 
*UNK:	 (  ) be amended  (  ) ? 
*UNK:	I think so, yes. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*UNK:	Er, what I would like to propose   (.) the erm   (.) a  a  that resolution two of course, was put down   (.) at the time it had to be put down er, and is clearly going to be affected by, that it happened at the   (.) th  the financial services   (  ) in March   (.) and what I have suggested   (.) is that you might prefer this be a a a second resolution   (  ) it is or   (.) and turn to the   (  ) to add on the end of that resolution   (.) thus urging local churches to through their consultations with district treasurers and finance committee   (.) to increase their contributions to the Ministry of Mission Fund in nineteen ninety three in such a way that provincial commi  , commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two  (  ) .  (.) But th  , the thing is that it looks as though it is going to be a fairly ongoing thing that's going to   (.) it may be well on   (.) certainly   (.) er a   (.) beyond assembly when we have to come to a conclusion, and therefore we ought to know the picture er, of, within reform churches far more clearly in giving more time. But, clearly we need to have the authority that the   (.) that er   (.) to having discussed   (  ) to   (.) a form of  (  ) . 
*UNK:	And, If I understand this now 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*UNK:	er, we have a choice   (.) the resolution before us, (  ) endorse the action taken by the provincial treasurer   (.) in the level of commitment he has made to the MMF fund in nineteen ninety three on behalf of the  (  ) .  (.) And that commitment which Alan has made, I'm right Alan? 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*UNK:	Is a nought percent increase 
*UNK:	It's nought percent. 
*UNK:	over our commitment.  (.) Erm   (.) would you like to take that resolution first   (.) and make this  a sort of a, an extra resolution   
*UNK:	  (  )  
*UNK:	Right, okay then.  (.) I think that will be   (.) that will be clearer.  (.) First of all if we debate now whether or not the Synod endorses the action taken by judicial moderator 
*UNK:	Treasurer. 
*UNK:	in the level of commitment he has made to the MMF fund of nineteen ninety three on behalf of the provence   (.) and we now know   (.) that that's   (.) a commitment, was a commitment of a nought percent increase.  (.) We'll debate that first. 
*UNK:	It's gotta be done first. 
*PHI:	Mm? 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	David? 
*ENA:	Can I just clarify 
*UNK:	Stand up please! 
*ENA:	David  , can I just clarify that this resolution now supersedes   (.) what is said in the report? 
*UNK:	No, er    (.)  (  ) we're proposing   (.) that we just do, take this reso  , in other words, if you endorse the fact that I say I I sa  committed the 
*ENA:	But what do you say  about   
*UNK:	 Yes. 
*ENA:	the ones you've written down? 
*UNK:	Yeah, that's right, yes. 
*UNK:	The, because   (.) this report  has been written   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	three or four weeks ago   (.) before Alan was able to vet all the information. And in view of the information he had when he went to London for a meeting last Wednesday   (.) and that was when he   (.) consulted with other people   (.) deciding that he should offer a nought percent increase.  (.) Okay? 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	So   (.) that's right.  (.) Erm, one can then 
*UNK:	 ((whispering))  (  ) . 
*UNK:	perhaps cure   (.) the provincial credit    (  )  (.) brought to us  (  ) .  (.) And following that recommendation   (.) we accepted a rash   (.) amendment on the floor   (.) of  (  ) . Increasing the commitment with the treasurer      (  )  (.)  (  )  (.) and   (  ) not to be rash with it   (.) but the people understand    (  )  (.) people who are mostly killed in churches and    (  )  (.) and either way     (.)  (  )  (.) should not pass to amend a resolution for the Council  (  ) .  (.)  ((laughing)) You're not with it ! 
*UNK:	 (  ) at the er    (.)  (  ) the ministry   (.) but maybe the ministry er   (.) will be  (  ) . 
*ENA:	Could we not have er   (.) I think procedure is   (.) could we not have the er er   (.) resolution for the   (  ) at first and now that a ministry is in motion? 
*UNK:	Erm   (.) I think we need to endorse the action taken by the judicial treasurer   (.) and then   (.) if we was then to go onto   (.) second bits, which is urging the churches to give   (.) five percent more than that in the past   (.) you could debate that se   (.) separately. Investigative procedure will follow   (.) and we keep the two things clear   (.) we're making   (.) the   (.) the treasurer is erm   (.) suggesting that this provence of the URC makes no  (  ) , makes    (  )  (.) not to increase. There's no   (  ) to increase over this year 's commitment.  (.) That's what  we've proposed. 
*UNK:	  ((noseblow)) 
*UNK:	Er   (.) Bob? 
*UNK:	I've got a question  on   
*UNK:	 Bob! 
*UNK:	 (  ) does that mean that   (.) the assessment for each church will remain the same   (.) for a couple of years? Is that the   (.) er, is that the implication? 
*UNK:	Erm 
*UNK:	But does it still  need, somehow   
*UNK:	 No, I can't   
*UNK:	or other if the assessment will increase? 
*UNK:	It will vary because er   (.) erm   (.) er we we ac   (.) remember that we have a formula which will expose to what your   (.) er erm, nominated income was in previous years   (.) what the membership, you know, these have all changed   (.) so it could be   (.) i   (.) I wouldn't like to say it's exactly the same   (.) could be a bit of a problem! 
*UNK:	But also there you can   (  ) ministers   (.) because minis   (.) er churches they count for more than two years   (.) stop being central funds   (.) and therefore, if we had  too many   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	churches that   (.)  entered   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	a third year of vacancy   (.) next year  that puts   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	more of a burden on churches with ministers. 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*UNK:	So i  i  it just depends on 
*ENA:	Thank you.  (.) May I   (.) ask one more thing? 
*UNK:	By, by very  special   
*ENA:	 Oh! 
*UNK:	 (  ) ! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	Erm   (.) in order to meet a commitment which is the same as this year commitment   (.) then last    (  )  (.) here increasing last year   (.) because this year's commitment we will not reach this year   (.) therefore, we'll be into deficit! Therefore, to pay   (.) that commitment again the churches must be asked to give more   (.) and ask the treasurer to make a further commitment   (.) and the churches must   (.) find more again! So it can't be the same as in churches   (.) even if it stays in the profit? 
*UNK:	Any other comments? 
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	 Keep them  coming! 
*UNK:	 (  )  (.) to say   (  ) from what we  (  ) . 
*UNK:	Right. 
*UNK:	Cos I don't mind taking this action   (.) erm, I think the   (.) the thought is that I would like to propose that we have a word with the government. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Because I think that they   (  ) and that we can only say    (.)  (  ) the same again next year when our own  (  ) , everything goes up   (.) and, I think it's very sad   (.) that the church can't  (  ) ! 
*UNK:	Is that a formal   (.) amendment? 
*UNK:	Yes it is. 
*UNK:	Is there a seconder to that formal amendment.  (.) Does anybody want to speak for that amendments now? That we add the words with sadness   (.) to the resolution? 
*UNK:	Could I, say also with sadness that in that that, yes things are going up but one thing isn't going up and tha  , that's our membership. 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*UNK:	 Mm. 
*UNK:	 And  that is   (.) as   (.) one of the members of, we have a   (.) I think we can afford to have member on the finance of churches   (.) who are called at the assembly of the URC   (.)  who er   
*UNK:	 Good, yes! 
*UNK:	in fact, erm anybody that says a lot of sensible things and says look   (.) if people are asked to   (.) er, to er   (.) increase their giving by nought percent that me  , it probably means the church might have to be    (  )   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	cos the membership has gone down! 
*UNK:	Mm   (.) mm. 
*UNK:	Thanks. 
*UNK:	Mm mm. 
*UNK:	The amendment to add the word with sadness   (.) to this resolution number two on page sixteen is before you   (.) those in support of the amendment that we add the words with sadness to the resolution please show.  (.) And those against the amendment please show.  (.) The amendment is carried.  (.) So the resolution before us now   (.) is that the Synod endorses   (.) english grammar writing  (  ) ! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Synod endorses with sadness the action taken by the provincial treasurer   (.) in the level of commitments   (.) he has made to MMF in nineteen ninety three. We'll be making that resolution.  (6.0) If there are no other further comments   (.) or   (.) questions set before you   (.) would you show if you're in favour of resolution two of page sixteen   (  ) ? 
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*UNK:	In favour?  (.) Those against?  (7.0) We now move to the   (.) erm   (.) sort of, two A which I will now as    (  )  (.) and this will be that Synod urges local churches   (.) through their consultations with district treasurers and the finance committee   (.) to incrus  , increase their contribution to MMF in nineteen ninety three   (.) in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two budgets   (.) targets sorry! Targets!  (.) I'll read it again   (.) that we, that Synod urges local congregations through their consultations with district treasurers and finance committee   (.) to   (.) increase their contributions to MMF in nineteen ninety three   (.) in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by fi  , by at least five percent   (.) over the nineteen ninety two targets.  (.) If anybody would like to speak. 
*UNK:	Could I just say a   (  ) ? 
*UNK:	 Yes. 
*UNK:	I think I should while you're putting the words in such a way so it wasn't a   (.) er, it wasn't thought that everybody just increased everything by five percent. But as I say the   (.) the people who did not   (  ) five five percent   (.) er, therefore, others may not have given more! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Others may give less because they've got a lot of members   (.) so that therefore it's   (.) so that the provence as a whole   (.) could be advised.  (.) And I would have thought us giving five percent and, and there are other provinces that are giving more will ensure at least the   (.) the   (  ) on twelve thousand we pay next year   (.) and therefore, starting with eleven and half thousand we paid this year   (.) and that    (  )  (.) provinces   (.) and in ourselves went further than that it is possible  (  ) . 
*UNK:	Not very good!  (.) Surely, John     (.) erm, at home   (.) would like today off fishing! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 (  ) .  (.) How much longer moderator   (.) can we in the Welsh provence accept   (.) being the poor relationship   (.) within the denominations? Indeed, how much longer can we expect the other provinces to continue carrying us? We are no poorer than some of the 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*UNK:	noble provinces! 
*UNK:	No. 
*UNK:	Because we hear great   (.) erm   (.) shouts,cackulations of joy from those provinces that can afford to increase their giving   (.) shouldn't allow us to sit on our morals!  (.) I think it's a great tragedy that Wales   (.) considers itself to be the poor relation   (.) within the United Reform Church   (.) and the answer can only lie within Wales! I can't come en  , elsewhere   (.) we have to support this motion too! 
*UNK:	Any other comments?  (6.0) The motion is before that Synod urges local churches   (.) through their consultations with district treasurers and the finance committee   (.) to increase their contribution to MMF in nineteen ninety three   (.) in such a way that th  , that the provincial commitment   (.) may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two targets.  (.) For those in favour please show?  (.) And those against please show?  (.) And that's carried.  (.) So we move to resolution three on page   (.) sixteen. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	I think erm   (.) er   (.) I know there has been some discussion of   (.) I I   (  ) about    (  )  (.) er   (.) and I put   (.) er, in this report I think all the documentation that the ministers and   (  ) ministers that had already seen it   (.) and   (.) I've explained that the big issue is that er   (.) the URC, I think   (  ) a weekly account o  ah of all other informations   (.) has er, worked out very   (  ) on the basis of five thousand and I was   (.) been tugging   (  ) you pay your car off to get that    (  )  (.) and   (.)  (  ) . The church in Wales   (.) er    (.)  (  ) and   (  ) and from a   (.) a survey of   (.) one church in Church of England   (.) in Hemel Hempstead, I discovered that their rate seemed to be about thirty two P per mile. You've got to work it out on the basis of ten miles   (.) not on the basis of five miles. I think also   (.) er, and this   (.) er, it may be that the er   (.) er URC does not want to be pushed round    (  )  (.) er, we got up   (.) er, to how many ministers this applies   (.) but I do know there are quite a number of ministers   (.) which   (.) who need their own cars   (.) a  and   (  ) a a   (  ) at the church that pays the   (.) er, insurance, the road license and even something for the maintenance. Now, clearly if you were paid say   (.) six hundred pounds for that   (.) and you only did twelve hundred miles, you're getting fifty P a mile anyway! And they've got, I think the odds are that people are   (.) giving more perhaps   (.) er     (.)  (  )  (.) and that er, if they were paid at fifty four P per mile   (.) and   (.) and got   (  ) how that would affect the churches   (.) er   (.) contributions they make?  (.) And therefore, er our proposal is that we should adopt the figures at the bottom of the page which are actually those which the   (.) the er   (.) er, Inland Revenue have recognised in ones where you don't have to   (.) er, put in a tax return for.. for  (  ) . 
*UNK:	So resolution three isbefore you   (.) for discussion  (  ) . 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Peter? 
*MAR:	I know I'm a  (  ) ! 
*UNK:	Reading for our  (  ) , I mean er, I supply my own car, my church   (  ) has recognised that   (  ) whether I'm    (.)  (  ) probably if I pay the tax and the insurance    (  )  (.) erm   (.) and I just   (  ) thirty two, thirty five   (.) that's    (  )  (.) but   (.) when I'm in   (  ) business or I'm in provinces and I'm allowed to pay what, ten  fifteen   
*UNK:	 Fifteen. 
*UNK:	pence a mile? 
*UNK:	Fifteen. 
*UNK:	And I do not 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	or be subsidised, you know a  a  I mean I think that's   (  ) consistency. 
*UNK:	Well I I shall leave you to go through the questions for a few minutes. 
*UNK:	 (  ) from from  (  ) , erm I'm rather concerned about what   (.) the   (.) er, provence here is intending to do! Erm, I've worked for ten and a half years within this county of Clwyd as a   (.) social worker, regarded as an extensional    (  )  (.) and every year my employers   (.) er, who are based in London would like the county to know what were the remec  recommended mileage   (.) rates   (.) for the reimbursel to a business car mileage? Now, if Clwyd or Gwynedd or any other county for that matter, within Wales or in England   (.) er, decided that in themselves that they would not implement the national recommendation   (.) er, then there duly would be   (.) all hell to pay, and rightly so! And certainly now that of course, ministers don't have a union   (.) unfortunately!  (.)  Er   
*UNK:	 No. 
*UNK:	they would allow me half    (  )  (.) now erm I've been looking at one particular church, one denomination   (.) er, which is the Methodist Church, although it has been said already here this afternoon, or this morning rather   (.) there are an overall erm   (.) joint   (  ) style with Methodist and with United Reform Church   (.) and   (.) erm   (.) I have personally the Methodist   (  ) of last year, last September   (.) where it gives   (  ) and also   (.) erm, mileage recommendations. I'll be viewing the Methodist Church in quite a different way, but I think it's very important for us to be   (.) made aware of how they do it   (.) erm   (.) for example, if you have   (.) erm   (.) a a   (  ) or or and I don't think any church has, are provided   (.) within that    (  )  (.) and gets   (  ) alike. In addition to that you get depreciation   (.) of one thousand one hundred and forty four pound per year   (.) which, by my reckoning is ninety five pound a month   (.) in addition to that, as a Methodist Minister you get a standing charge of five hundred and twenty eight pound per year which is   (.) forty four pound   (.) pe  er, per month   (.) and then   (.) you also through i  in the year if you have a major repair needed on your car you get a hundred and eight pound   (.) now, if in fact, I had  (  ) , I have a Vauxhall Nova, and let me take these figures as you are    (  )  (.) at twenty four P   (.) a mile, or twenty four point   (.) five P a mile   (.) and if that's all we are recommended, recommending, in other words, there's no lump sum at all er, that would mean that I would be getting forty nine pound   (.) but    (.)
