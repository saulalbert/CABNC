@Comment:	conversation #55 (Tape 004311)
*CAR:	They're doing a, I've got a piece of paper somewhere with it all written on, I'll show you, they're doing a piece of research with a company that does dictionaries and a university, to put together a load of modern usage.
*ADA:	Oh right.
*CAR:	Like, has a, like   (        ) the girl that came talked about it, like for example, people are using wicked, good.
*ADA:	Oh yeah.
*CAR:	So there's, obviously lots of other pieces, English at work   (        ) as well.
*ADA:	Yes. ((baby talk))
*CAR:	So I've been left with a load of tapes, (        ) batteries.
*ADA:	How long have you got to do it for?
*CAR:	Mm, as often as I can until further  (        ) , she left all the  (        ) .
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	Brilliant little machine actually, well it's only a Walkman, but the microphone is incredibly 
*ADA:	Yeah is that the microphone there?
*CAR:	Yeah.Clever.
*ADA:	It's a small enough tape innit?
*CAR:	It is really  ((laugh)) .Let's go and do a bit of spying. ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	That's right. (        ) conversation come into it?
*CAR:	Oh yes, ((laugh)) , you could just quite, quite a lot in it, quite vocal she is.
*ADA:	Who have you had taped?
*CAR:	Mm, mum and dad, Brian and Lynn, erm, no, no not Brian and Lynn, Brian, Brian and Pauline, Bett  (        ) , my piano lesson's on there   ((laugh)) yesterday.
*ADA:	That'll be interesting. ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Mm, (        ) , piano playing's not so beautiful, but, is when he plays.
*ADA:	Does he play when he comes here?
*CAR:	If he's showing me something, or is, before, I start a new piece, he'll always play it.
*ADA:	And yours sounds nothing like it?
*CAR:	No, well certainly not the first time I play, it, I approach it when he thinks I've finished, but it's nowhere near, I mean
*ADA:	Provisional, expect to sound as good
*CAR:	Mm.
*ADA:	so
*CAR:	 (        ) concerts and things, but you can, you can tell, with just, just by listening that it's not just any old body tinkling on the piano, it's wonderful, it makes you sick. ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	Is Charlotte going to learn to play it?
*CAR:	Well I hope she'll be interested enough to, but, not really before she's six, cos I asked him last couple of times ago, he said, what sort of age, cos obviously the size of the hands comes into it, they can't do too much, but he said he wouldn't consider before six and you ought'a have to take the parents into consideration, of a child that age you gotta have a parent who's prepared to sit there and make sure the child does what he's set them to do, because  (        ) , oh Amy, you not getting any   (        ) out of that. ((knocking))Have you finished it?Ha, you big lump. ((knocking)) ((baby noise))No wonder she puts on half a pound a week.Mind you erm, I mean that's not, it's normal, I expect you to put between six, six ounces and eight ounces  (        ) .Oh dear, oh dear, it's a hard life isn't it?
*ADA:	 (        ) taken it off.
*CAR:	How you doing?
*ADA:	Eh, oh, O K, I'll find out tonight.
*CAR:	Oh of course, Wednesday.
*ADA:	The way in to work, cycled there last week.
*CAR:	Oh my.
*ADA:	I had to, Richard had taken the car  (        ) , he takes it in the morning, but
*CAR:	Oh my goodness, (        ) .
*ADA:	Well he   (.) he takes the car to school, but, and it, sorry takes the car to work and before he's bringing the car home and then he's been going to school on his bike.
*CAR:	Oh right.
*ADA:	So of course the bike, the car's for me to use in the evening, but last
*CAR:	You cycle home from here and then  (        ) ?
*ADA:	 (        ) from you, then you get changed and then go, but, last week he took the car, cos when I got home, first I was late last Wednesday, well I say late, I didn't get back here, erm, until seven, so by the time I got home it was quarter past seven and I have to make sure I get to Weightwatchers between seven and eight.
*CAR:	Oh, for the weigh in?
*ADA:	Mm, so I had to go, quickly get changed, and cos it, it, I normally I just wear a pair, a pair of sandals and light weight clothing, but
*CAR:	Oh dear.
*ADA:	so, I couldn't go in sandals, well obviously I can't cycle in a pair of sandals on
*CAR:	Can't really cycle with a floating skirt on either, can you?
*ADA:	The last   (        ) with me leggings on and this top on.Well, I looked a bit of a sight, but I thought well, well, you know, what else can I do, I mean I couldn't take clothing to get changed in to.
*CAR:	Well, they wouldn't expect you to would they?
*ADA:	I've, I'd got a few stares from some of the women there, I mean, there are some women there that are huge, and maybe they looked at me and thought oh I hope I can wear leggings like that one day  ((laugh)) , I mean I don't think I look too bad in the leggings, I mean I would never have done it when I used to go to Weightwatchers when I was thirteen and a half stone, I would never of gone in leggings, no way, but it doesn't
*CAR:	Well you don't, you don't really look as if you need to lose weight cos it's probably why you got a few stares, it's like all the diet books that have sylphlike people on the front.
*ADA:	Well  (        ) .I mean I spoke to Jane the other Sunday and I, I said to her you know, just be honest, I said I don't care what you said, but just be honest and tell me how much you think I weigh, cos she doesn't know how much I weigh and she thought I weighed about ten stone, I said well stick thirteen pounds on top of that  ((laugh)) , then you'll be right, she couldn't believe that I, that I weighed that much, so obviously it doesn't look that bad and people at work, well they've noticed that I've lost weight, but they don't say how much they think I weigh, so I don't want   (        ) come to them to sort of, have a, have a g  (.) have a guess of my weight.
*CAR:	Guess the weight of a Suzie.
*ADA:	Yeah, but they have noticed which is something I suppose.There's somebody came in today, a guy came in today who used to work with us who usually comes in occasionally and I would see him, but for a few weeks now, so he noticed it.It's nice that people say it to you unprompted. ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Oh yes, you say I'm on a diet, they say oh well you have lost a lot of weight then. ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	Adam's mum's like that.
*ADA:	Oh is she?
*CAR:	She knows you're dieting, every time she sees you, ooh you've lost a lot of weight.
*ADA:	Even when you haven't, yeah, but erm, no I mean, there is a guy at work, I mean there is a guy at work that's constantly saying to me, oh it's really noticing, it's really started, he says this every day, and he, after a while, I mean it's nice to be told it, once in a while, but not every day.
*CAR:	But not every day, it loses value doesn't it?
*ADA:	Oh it does, and he said to me, erm this afternoon, he said eh, oh he said eh, your weight loss is really, really noticing this week, and I thought well, even if I had lost weight this week it's only going to be a couple of pounds, and a couple of pounds would not notice.
*CAR:	Plus the different clothes you wear.
*ADA:	It doesn't matter who you are, two pounds won't make any difference to your appearance, I mean, yeah I suppose clotheswise
*CAR:	Well as you, as you get smaller, two pounds does notice, it's when you're 
*ADA:	Maybe it does.
*CAR:	when you're bigger, and you've got a real lot to lose, and two pounds is nothing.
*ADA:	Yeah, two pound is nothing , yes that's true.
*CAR:	Two pounds is actually quite a lot.
*ADA:	Yes it is.
*CAR:	Good evening.My goodness me how many have you caught? ((laugh)) Have you got a whopper in there?
*ADA:	Yes.
*ADA:	I's gonna say the bags   (        ) full.
*CAR:	Goodness.So, so your new leader did the trick. ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	God you need, my god.
*ADA:	Mm.
*CAR:	Ah.
*ADA:	In the chair Jessie.
*CAR:	Good grief, what's it weigh?
*ADA:	Three pounds, five and a half.
*CAR:	Wow.Who shall we have over for dinner?
*ADA:	Not giving that away.
*ADA:	 ((laugh)) That's a lot.
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) That's amazing.
*ADA:	Alright, yeah.
*CAR:	Wow.
*ADA:	Well I'll tell you what
*ADA:	Excuse my ignorance.
*CAR:	It's a fish kettle job isn't it?
*ADA:	Excuse my ignorance, but what is it?
*ADA:	It's a trout.
*CAR:	It's a very unusual colouring.
*ADA:	Mm.No I think it's just the  (        ) .
*CHA:	Mum.
*CAR:	It's spotty it's spotty, ha.
*ADA:	No he lost some, lost some of his scales, that's all.I was a, having a devil of a job bringing him in, cos erm, he was in the top rank and he was, weave, he was weaving in and out  (        ) .
*CAR:	Wow.Oh well done you've got him.No good talking to me about top and bottom length , cos I don't know what you're talking about. ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	Mm, the top lake is like very flat water, is a lot of weed and a lot of scum, right?
*CAR:	Oh right.
*ADA:	So bringing the thing in, hello darling, and erm, he was just literally he was rushing around the weeds trying to
*CAR:	Trying to escape.
*ADA:	tangle it, just trying to tangle it up, cos the idea being if he gets round a weed, often enough he go   ((noise))that means, basically it gives him a lever, I mean they're very clever you know, these fish, they're not, they don't just sort of sit there and wait.
*CAR:	You mean someone  (        ) ?
*ADA:	They're not like coarse fish, Jo, perch, or roach or whatever in the river, if you catch them, they just sort of, lie down and wait for you.
*CAR:	Give up.
*ADA:	Yeah, yeah, (        ) .
*CHA:	Wow.
*CAR:	Oh, well done you did it.
*ADA:	Joelle.
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) Poor Joelle she's got some work to do.
*CHA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	What she, cos her mum's got a fish shop, she knows the way of   (.) cleaning fish without you cutting them, (        ) , pulling it all out from, through the gills.
*CHA:	Ready, steady
*CAR:	And of course they, they stay whole and they're beautiful when they're cooked.I don't   (        ) I'll tell Adam   (        ) everything, he can do it himself.
*CHA:	 ((scream)) 
*ADA:	That's right. (        ) 
*CAR:	I'll cook them.Careful.I'll cook them and eat them.
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	He can catch them and gut them.
*ADA:	That's right, yeah.

*CAR:	Is it cotton and lycra?
*ADA:	Eh, cotton polyester, lycra, elastic.Forty six per cent cotton, forty six per cent eh polyester and eight per cent lycra.
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*ADA:	I brought erm, a pair of, a floral pattern leggings from Marks and Spencers on Saturday, but when I got them home, they did nothing for me.
*CAR:	Ooh.
*ADA:	Come to daddy.
*CAR:	No. (        ) .

*ADA:	Charlotte can you come inside love, come on darling.You given me a cuddle yet, no you haven't have you?Let's have my cuddle, come on put your arms round me, give me nice big cuddles  ((kiss)) , give a nice kiss.

*ADA:	Oh do you want me to leave?
*ADA:	 ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	It's alright I'll shut my eyes.
*ADA:	And erm, I tried them on, well I, I bought, I mean I bought them and brought them home and a sort of cropped, cropped leggings they didn't really do anything for me.
*CHA:	Don't slam the door.
*ADA:	I'm not going to darling.
*CAR:	They catch the calf at the wrong place or something.
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	I have no idea, I haven't taken Nurofen for donkey's years, so I don't know what the situation is 
*ADA:	Are they downstairs  (        ) ?
*CAR:	They're either in the, in the erm, little cupboard in the downstairs loo or they're in the bathroom.He has some work to do I gather.
*JOE:	Did you see the trout?
*CAR:	I did trout.What a trout.
*ADA:	 ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Yes, big one.Not to be given away. (        ) .
*ADA:	Getting ready to cycle home.
*JOE:	Have to go work.
*ADA:	Have to go work, yes.
*CAR:	Then you can have a bath, ha.
*JOE:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	I meant bath for Charlotte. ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	Mm.
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*ADA:	Eh, concentrate, oh yeah leggings, erm so Jenny tried them on, and they looked really nice on her, cos her legs, you see, cos I've got this bit here, little bit there, erm, and being cropped, just made the legs look a bit sort of stumpy.
*CAR:	You haven't got stumpy legs.
*ADA:	Oh I have, have   (        ) well I've got high heels on, ((laugh)) , but it's, it's, because I am 
*CAR:	Yeah, I know what you mean.
*ADA:	Because I'm a bit patterny, flowers, with this little bit here and being cropped there, just made my leg look a bit, and I thought oh dear, and I wasn't convinced, Richard couldn't stand them, he thought I looked absolutely gross in them.
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*ADA:	So I thought, well I said I like them, and he said you can wear them as long as you're not out with me.So I thought well there's not much point in me having them, cos I would wear them 
*CAR:	If you find something unacceptable there's not much point.
*ADA:	Well I, I'd be wearing them at weekends, so, you know just, just just slouching around in really, well you know, perhaps, cycling yeah.
*CAR:	Not in front of the husband.Cycling.
*ADA:	So I thought there's not much point in me keeping them, if he really does, doesn't like them at all, he
*CAR:	Well done.
*ADA:	So erm
*CAR:	So she's got them.
*ADA:	 (        ) come inside, stay with mummy whilst I go and find myself some pills, please don't do that Charlotte.
*CAR:	While you go find some what?
*ADA:	Oh, pills, think I might have some in the car actually.
*CAR:	You got some in your, I was just going to say in your handbag, in your briefcase?
*ADA:	Could be.
*ADA:	Erm, yes I'm going to try and buy some plain ones, you know her, you know her navy blue ones  (.) 
*CAR:	How many more? ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	you know her navy blue leggings, but they're thicker than  (        ) .
*CAR:	Yeah, yeah they're nice.
*ADA:	I thought I might get myself a pair of those.
*CAR:	She got those from M and S, didn't she?
*ADA:	Yes.
*CAR:	Cos they looked really nice with that jumper she wears.
*ADA:	Yes, so I thought, I might erm, cos I bought a jumper, I bought a pale blue jumper to go with the flowery leggings, but, I've decided I'll take blue jumper back, cos, although it would be alright with plain white trousers I thought that's all I would wear it with, I wouldn't wear it with anything else, so, I think I'll change that, if I get the dark blue leggings like Jamie, then I'll get the striped jumper the same.
*CAR:	Soon be twins.
*ADA:	Soon be twins.
*CHA:	Daddy.
*ADA:	What's the matter with you?
*CHA:	Pull me.
*ADA:	What do you mean pull these, what for?
*ADA:	It's dead.
*CAR:	 ((laugh))  (        ) concerned about it.
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Got some.Do we need, me to buy some more?
*ADA:	Yeah, I  (        ) .
*CAR:	Better be without the Paracetamol for the last ten, eleven months or more.
*ADA:	Mm.Is that all you're allowed?
*CAR:	Mm.Well I mean, I don't know, I didn't ask any doctors, cos, we normally have Nurofen, but I didn't ask any doctors whether they were acceptable in pregnancy or not, I just assumed they weren't, cos nurses said last time, (        ) , that eh Paracetamols was alright.
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	Paracetamol is alright when you're breast feeding.
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	It was very difficult misses, you always have it both ends of your  (        ) , go on spit it out, spit it out, go on, you've got a mouthful there.More, ((baby crying)), oh, oh dear, go on  (        ) .
*CHA:	Quick, quick, quick.
*CAR:	Quick what?Quick what?
*CHA:	Quick.
*CAR:	She's getting worried about the door  (        ) .
*ADA:	The door.
*CAR:	Yes.
*ADA:	The front door.
*CAR:	Yes, whenever anybody knocks or rings.
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Funny girl, I remember she sat there and said don't worry it's only daddy.
*CHA:	Quick, (        ) .
*CAR:	I said no it's not daddy, who is it?When she found out it was you, she was alright.
*CHA:	 (        ) .
*CAR:	She got worried about my piano teacher when he arrived yesterday.
*CHA:	Come on  (        ) .
*CAR:	No, Aunty Suzie got to go home.
*ADA:	She's got to get on her bike.
*CHA:	Oh.

*CAR:	Change your nappy again haven't we little one?
*ADA:	Thank you.
*CAR:	Oh Amy darling.What she say? ((laugh)) Don't worry little girl, oh it's a hard life, oh sweety poppet.
