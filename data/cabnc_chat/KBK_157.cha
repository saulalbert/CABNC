*CHR:	I see right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) . When you start is to do a thing, put that mallet down like that and then line up the which you need to go. 
*CHR:	I see. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	The other ball contact, must be a contact there. 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	Just about enough   (  ) the red from  (  ) . Now that yellow, that blue ball must move 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	otherwise it's fault. Now where that centre of that V is   (  ) where the black ball will go. 
*CHR:	Right. Got you. 
*DAV:	I, I don't tend to do it like that at all, I do    ((hits ball)) (  ) it very nearly go, it's on the wrong side unfortunately. (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes, yes, it, it did curl with the grass didn't it? 
*DAV:	Yes. (  ) . 
*CHR:	Right. What you didn't want to do in that case, no   
*DAV:	 No  . (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes indeed. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	You can  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes, I see. 
*DAV:	So it doesn't matter if this ball goes off.  ((hits ball))Moving slightly the wrong way. 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) , where, where you want the ball to come back. 
*CHR:	I understand, yes, yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	And there's no benefit of having a row   (  ) as you had before. 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) . The black would of come up about there. 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	Which would've enabled me to rush, (  ) up there, but I didn't. 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Right. O K 
*DAV:	Right now you come out   (  ) or go up to red. I think I would just go up to red 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	till you've got the feel of it, I  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Right, fine. 
*DAV:	And the object is to hit red. 
*CHR:	Yes, quite, quite, it's, it's intriguing because it's so un   (.) so different to what I had in mind.  ((laugh))  ((hits ball))Eh that was strange stuff  (6.0)
