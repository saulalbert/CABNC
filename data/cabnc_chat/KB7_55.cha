*STU:	Mm, mm. 
*NON:	okay, now, er, as long as the standing order's kicking okay, there's not a problem, you have not got to worry now, erm, all it is, is, it just falls into like   
*NON:	  (  )  
*NON:	the payments come out, twenty five years, one pays out the other, end of story. 
*STU:	Mm. The one, when, when, when, when does the mortgage payment actually come out? The actual two hundred and whatever it was    (  )

*STU:	Ok, right-y-oh 
*NON:	But if you've got any more questions, I mean don't hesitate to come back, because at the end of the day I'd rather you know too much than not enough 
*STU:	not enough, that's it   
*NON:	 well I mean  if you've been in, you sat the opposite way 
*STU:	 Yeah, yeah  . 
*NON:	 you know what it's, I mean it only costs me, five minutes on the phone and I've got the information for you, but if you've got a sleepless night, that's not worth it. 
*STU:	No. One small  (  )  
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	Still that doesn't matter if, because if I put  (.)  
*:	 (  ) 
*NON:	yes because, 
*STU:	in case it makes a difference to your 
*NON:	hang on, I have got the figures here  (12.0)  
*NON:	Erm, twelve ninety, twelve ninety four, erm I, I don't think  (  )  
*NON:	you're absolutely spot on, cos you had them on the other one didn't you? So I've altered that to twelve ninety four and there's a twenty eight, 
*NON:	So have I 
*NON:	that is an eight   (.) O, one, okay 
*NON:	What number?

*NON:	 smoker, it's on your medical thing   
*NON:	 When, when we got  access to the medical thing 
*NON:	it said non smoker 
*STU:	It said cigarettes, (  ) do I smoke cigarettes and I said no, 
*NON:	which is honest 
*STU:	which, which is    (  )   
*NON:	 yes, yeah   (  )   
*STU:	so make it out cheaper 
*NON:	they'll make  them out cheaper   
*STU:	 a little bit cheaper   
*NON:	absolutely, yeah 
*STU:	Fair enough, as long as though we    (  ) honest   
*NON:	 Well I  think you know, you, you, you, it was an honest answer to, to both questions, cos they didn't say do you smoke a pipe, that you smoke you know or whatever or just said cigarettes. 
*STU:	Don't smoke cigarettes and I thought no   (  ) when it comes back it may work out much cheaper. 
*NON:	Yeah, that's right. 
*STU:	Right, okay, thanks very much
