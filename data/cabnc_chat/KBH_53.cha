*JOE:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Give her a little bit of eh leg meat, yeah.
*JOE:	Of a what?
*CAR:	Leg meat.
*JOE:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	And there's half of baked potato in the fridge if you can scoop it out of the skin and heat it up.Pardon, not hit it, heat. ((laugh)) Stop crying   (.) Did you have a nice weekend?
*ADA:	Shopping in John Lewis for  (        ) .
*CAR:	At the weekend?What on Saturday?
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	 (        ) it's not open on Sunday.
*ADA:	Yeah, she wanted to get some fabric to make up a jacket.
*CAR:	Oh this is the jacket that mum said   ((laugh))  (        ) .
*ADA:	That's the one.
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	That's the one.
*CHA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Shall we, shall we turn this off now?
*CHA:	No we not.
*CAR:	No we not, alright.
*CHA:	We leave it.
*CAR:	We leave it alright.
*ADA:	Can I see?
*CAR:	Is the television control behind you?Could you turn the volume down.
*ADA:	Which one's the telly?
*CAR:	That one.
*ADA:	That one.
*CAR:	It's like arrows, that's alright, we're not turning it off love, don't worry.
*CHA:	No don't turn.
*CAR:	That's it, it's wonderful, I don't think we need it quite so high, when we're not concentrating.
*CHA:	No.
*ADA:	 (        ) what you got, mind yourself.
*CAR:	So what, what you do, what sort of type of things did you get?
*ADA:	 (        ) , in the picture it's really  (        ) , it looks more like a jacket rather than a blouse.
*CAR:	Oh right.
*ADA:	But, erm, I mean all the fabric we went to get, they just cotton and erm
*CAR:	Yeah, but there's cotton and there's cotton.
*ADA:	cotton , weaved cotton or something, something cotton, I can't remember what it is.The Aberdeen
*CHA:	Hello.
*ADA:	 (        ) .But erm, the fabric that Jamie wanted all print, it's just printed cotton, (        ) .
*CAR:	Oh.
*ADA:	But I mean the style of it is obviously jacketed person, blousey, cos it's   (        ) collar and she's got three buttons at the front and it's fitted as a jacket as opposed to a tuck in a blouse.
*CAR:	Oh right.
*ADA:	And it's got three quarter length sleeves.
*CAR:	Oh.
*ADA:	Or half sleeves. (        ) .
*CAR:	 (        ) it probably looks half isn't it?Wear it as a skirt as a jacket   (        ) blouse.
*ADA:	As a jacket, yes , that's right, I think it'll look quite smart, you know, with, perhaps a straight skirt.
*CAR:	With a plain, that goes in one of the colours.
*ADA:	Mm.
*CAR:	Oh well mum will enjoy herself won't she?
*ADA:	She always does.
*CAR:	Well I expect Jamie can, get as much, get as far as a button your blouse.
*ADA:	Oh well Jamie, well, I think she'll
*CAR:	She did do some sewing at school didn't she?
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	So she shouldn't be completely
*ADA:	I don't think   (        ) you know she's doing it down there because it like, it she's not very good at understanding the pattern.
*CAR:	Well she's not got a machine anyway has she?
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Charlotte you don't read books when you're watching the television.
*ADA:	You're watching the telly.You read later sit and watch telly.
*CHA:	No, no, no I won't  (        ) .
*CAR:	Did you hear how, oh suppose you haven't spoken to her since the party have you?
*ADA:	No.
*CAR:	What's the cake like?
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	What did she do?
*ADA:	 (        ) but she didn't see the   (        ) on you know, on the cake, it's all  (        ) .
*CAR:	Oh cos   (        ) do My Little Pony some time ago though, frantically looking for a pattern you know a magazine or something.
*ADA:	Yeah, yeah. (        ) .
*CAR:	Wonder what Charlotte's passion will be by her next birthday, at the moment it's Postman Pat. ((laugh)) Mind anything Disney at the moment will probably go down a treat.
*ADA:	Sorry?
*CAR:	Anything Disney will probably do down a treat, like Lady Amd The Tramp, Sleeping Beauty or something.
*ADA:	Yeah.Oh dear. (        ) .
*CAR:	Have you, have you not seen it?
*ADA:	I have, but I can't remember it.
*CAR:	But you don't remember it.I don't know how much of it I remembered, cos I've seen it so often now, mm, can't remember the first time I saw it   (.) Didn't know  (        ) .Lady to the rescue. ((laugh))  ((sigh)) I use  (        ) .
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	I hope you don't get wet.
*ADA:	That's right, that's what I'm just thinking actually.
*CAR:	Cos I don't know what time Adam will be back   ((laugh)) he's   (        ) fishing.
*ADA:	Oh right, I don't, I mean, I don't really want to get wet, but I mean, it's not so bad going home, (        ) wet going home.
*CAR:	Oh you can just jump in the bath.
*ADA:	Just get in the bath , it's the going in the morning.This morning it started to  (        ) .
*CAR:	You can wake up now, got to change your nappy, (        ) , mucky nappy, mm.
*ADA:	Yeah  (        ) .
*CAR:	Why what   (        ) say?
*ADA:	She's up late tonight.
*CAR:	Oh it's normal now.
*ADA:	Oh is it?
*CAR:	Yes, she has   (        ) now.Well, she   (.) her, her sleeping habits during the day change to afternoons, and, well today she's been she had about two hours this afternoon, so if we did our normal and gave her tea at five o'clock, and send them up for a bath at half past six, there's no way she'd be asleep.
*ADA:	No.
*CAR:	So we sort of switched all around now, so she eats with us at half past six stroke seven, goes up for a bath at seven thirty, (        ) eight o'clock and she's in bed by nine, then she, she's usually asleep by half past ten, but eh, it seems to have cured the problem we had with her  ((cough)) , wanting, wanting me all the time, after she's gone to bed.
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	So, seems to be working.
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Well this one seems to go to bed a bit later now, so she goes longer, but she's feeding all day today, (        ) , I'm at   (        ) every couple of hours, so with a bit of luck, I'll finally put her to bed maybe half past nine ten o'clock, she might go through till three or four, which isn't bad.
*ADA:	No.
*CAR:	It's usually half past nine till, I wasn't so good last night, she went until two, but then she didn't wake up again until seven.Manages to do long stretches at night, which is nice.
*ADA:	Yeah.
*CAR:	And then she went to sleep again until ten, on our bed. ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	Mm.
*CAR:	She's   (        ) reluctant to go back in her own bed, so I just point her over me shoulder and lay and said get on with it    (.)  (        ) an insult. ((laugh))  (        ) lose his sense of smell in the wet.
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Richard had any more pets recently?You haven't had one.
*ADA:	Yeah, he's booked one of the thirteenth.
*CAR:	Oh, (        ) good luck, eh.
