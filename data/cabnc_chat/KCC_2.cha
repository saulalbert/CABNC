(        )  (.) and as we were coming from it he said look there's a shirt you want for Robert there. (.) So I thought well in case I can't get them anywhere else   (        ) the market and he said well we'll have one from here, twelve ninety nine. (.) We goes up town the following week then to get    (        )  (.) and I forget what I was looking for, oh it was   (        ) I was looking for your blouse

*MAR:	And I went down, I went somewhere else   (.) there was a few places I saw them      (.)  (        )  (.)  (        ) so erm   (.) I said to  (        ) , I said to Robert now you know those shirts, that shirt I bought you for Christmas?And he said yeah   (.) I said I could've got two for the price of one. (.)  (        )  (.)  (        ) see that then. (.) Padded leisure shirts five ninety nine    (        )  (.) and I read the bloody thing out yesterday. (        )  (.) 
*CER:	No wonder    [laughing]  (        )  [] 
*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*CER:	Nan can you see them  (        ) 
*MAR:	Yes love. (.) 
*CER:	 (        )  (.) 
*HAZ:	They've dug up   (        )  (.) 
*MAR:	Yes they   (        ) 
*CER:	I can't get up now mummy. [whingeing] I can't    (        )  []  (.) 
*MAR:	Oh   (        ) you know   (        ) 
*CER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	padded shirts for   (.) padded shirts nine ninety nine to twelve ninety nine. (        ) 
*HAZ:	Cos Ken said, first of all he couldn't find any and he said oh he said perhaps I should've bought them when I saw them, nine ninety nine.But anyway he saw this one stall and he had a look and they had three racks of them    (.)  (        ) for ten ninety nine    (        )  (.) and then we found some others then, they were   (.) they were ten ninety nine but they were as thick as these other ones.
*MAR:	They were twelve ninety nine  (        ) .But erm the shop   (.) opposite er you know there's the market and there's a cake shop, opposite there by the   (        ) shop, they've got a sale there.
*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Stock clearance.By, by the, you know   (        ) wallpaper   (        ) 
*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Yeah
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	and then there's a shop next to it and he's selling er stock clearance sales there and that's where he saw them, the padded shirts, there.
*HAZ:	Mm 
*MAR:	But I didn't look, I didn't stop, it was raining so bad Thursday morning and windy that I   (.) I went to the market, I cut straight through and went up   (        ) and Di went to get the paper then he went  (        ) .So we, we were back in here by half past eleven Thursday   (.) I didn't want to stay out in the cold.
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	Yeah  (        ) 
*CER:	Yippee!
*MAR:	I wanna get him another towelling dressing gown because the blue one he had on the caravan he brought home for the winter   (        ) bring them home and wash them.But he would he said don't wash it I wanna wear it.So really he could do with one for down there and one for home. (.) But the 
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*MAR:	only other one he's got is a silk one    (        )  (.) so er I was gonna go   (        ) on Tuesday and have a look   (        ) and they had them there before Christmas, seven ninety nine   (.) and, but it said one size   (.) now I don't know whether the one size will fit Di because the last one I had for him I sent away for and I had erm      (.)  (        )  (.)  (        ) so I don't know whether them down there would fit, they were seven ninety nine, there were white and lemon and pale green   (.) that was striped I think. (.) They had some nice thick ones in Peacocks but they were seventeen pound   (.) well sixteen ninety five 
*CER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	and they didn't reduce them for the sale.
*HAZ:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	He wouldn't let me pay that for it, he said   (        ) that they had at the shop.And when we went then after Christmas the shop was   (.) closed down for the 
*CER:	There we are!
*MAR:	the Christmas holidays. (.) 
*CER:	I'll have that one.
*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	 (        ) You know the mini market top of   (        ) I, I usually get the bargains?
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*MAR:	Well when Ken said about the headboard last week they were selling sheets on   (        ) mini market I said pink ones and grey ones   (.) but I said not while they had the Christmas stuff in, it was before the Christmas stuff they must have taken them out   (.) you know I 
*HAZ:	Mm 
*MAR:	I was thinking perhaps they'd bring them back.So Thursday we, we usually come out of Bridge Street, go round the corner and then down to the end of the  (        ) , car's parked at the end of the lane.So I said wonder if they've got that headboard for Ken, you know I didn't know he had one    (        )  (.) I said we'll have a look and see how much they are.When we got there, it's all locked up.Oh that's for stocktaking   (        ) they said.And we looked through the side windows and there's not a thing on the ruddy counters, it's cleared out.There's nothing there at all so there's no stock they can sell, they've shut down I expect.
*HAZ:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	And the week before it was all Christmas stuff was still in there. (.) 
*HAZ:	Oh you know in, you know in Ponty?You know that great big double shop   (.) that's a mini market?They always got chairs and wicker baskets and things 
*MAR:	Mm 
*HAZ:	outside. (.) That's gone.
*MAR:	They've got one in they've got one in   (        ) like that as well haven't they?Irene had her jardiniere thing
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	They shut up have they?
*HAZ:	Yeah and that was a big one that was   (.) cos that went downstairs an'all.
*MAR:	Yeah.
*HAZ:	Just gone. (.) 
*MAR:	Mm. (.) Mind now as you say   (        ) the   (.) recession. (.) Didn't Rhys wanna go to the match today though?
*HAZ:	He did, yes.
*MAR:	Well he come round here he said   (.) are you ready? (        ) Robert   (        ) and er   (.) Rob said aye we're going.And I said what's the matter Rhys? (.) And Di said what's the matter, you've got a face as long as a fiddle? (.) Everything, he said   [laughing] he went   []  (.) 
*HAZ:	Oh what happened was he was going to the match
*MAR:	Mm.
*HAZ:	and then his friends come knocking at the door, you coming out to play football Rhys?No I'm going to the football match with dad. (.)  [mimicking] You're gonna watch Cardiff City  [] ?And so of course they started pulling his leg then see?And he said   (.) he said 
*CER:	No, are you gonna watch Cardiff City lose again.
*HAZ:	That's right, twenty five nil.
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*HAZ:	So Rhys says oh how did you guess   (.) but erm he come in then, he said I'm not going to the football mum.
*MAR:	He, hmm
*HAZ:	So I said to him well alright then I said er   (.) if you're not going to the football match you can go upstairs to your bedroom and tidy your bedroom again.Well when I say again   (.) he hadn't touched it. (.) It's a mess innit Cerys? (.) He makes more mess in his bedroom than she does   (.) and his is because, not only is it all papers and books and toys and everything else, it's all his clothes as well.He don't put any of his clothes away   (.) and if he's looking for anything it's all   (.) fling out of drawers and on the floor, he don't care.And if I've hung his coats up once I've hung up, I've hung them up a hundred times, he's got a coat hanger on the back of the   (.) coat hook on the back of the door 
*MAR:	Well I gave him two when he stayed here to stay er to hang er on his door and he   (        ) 
*HAZ:	and I'm not kidding you, he's got   (.) his blue coat that he wears down the garden, you know the one with all the  (        ) , he's got erm his army jacket, a grey jacket   (.) erm   (.) tt how many has he got  (        ) ?I think there's another jacket that he's got and there's no room to keep them all downstairs on the hook hanging in the passage
*MAR:	Mm.
*HAZ:	so I told him to keep them on the back of that door.You put them up on the door, they're on the floor.You pick them up again you put them back on the door, he chucks them back on the floor.
*MAR:	Oh   (        ) Robert he used to   (        ) 
*HAZ:	Terrible!
*MAR:	he'd go upstairs and Shirley would have put all the clean clothes back in the wardrobe   (.) and he'd go in the wardrobe oh, no I won't wear that, no I won't wear that   (.) and half the time she found the cleanest clothes were all rolled up under the bed.
*HAZ:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        )  ((laugh))  (        )  (.) 
*HAZ:	Yeah. (        ) 
*MAR:	They ain't half done a lot of   (        ) r er lorries and that going back and forward today   (.) over there.
*HAZ:	Yeah   (        ) here didn't they?

*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	B & Q?The   (        ) a sort of curve toward, behind B & Q   (.) so, and they, they   (        ) sort of on the slope there. (        ) this morning  (        ) , we didn't have a warning yesterday   (.)  (        ) 
*HAZ:	I dunno erm   (.) tt I was up er David's and Eileen's when it went and their windows rattled.
*MAR:	Yesterday?
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	Tuesday we had hell of a bang.
*HAZ:	And er   (.) erm Eileen said then she said we never had a warning then did we?So I dunno whether it's because we've got used to it
*MAR:	Ah.
*HAZ:	do you know what I mean?Cos I mean it's only like a siren, it's only going ooh ooh ooh innit?And you notice it.
*MAR:	Well anyway I   (        ) for half past three yesterday

*CER:	 (        ) 
*HAZ:	twenty five past three
*MAR:	He probably had the telly on so perhaps I just didn't but the last time they had er a siren on it wasn't all that load I thought.Whether it's cos the wind was blowing that way I dunno.Did you eat those Ferrero Rocher I sent up to you?
*HAZ:	Ooh she liked them didn't you?
*MAR:	Oh Iris didn't.She had a box full for Christmas, she ate three odd one, right?
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	She sent, they were in those little strips, she sent three in for me, she said and have you tasted these   (        ) I said I don't think so, so she sent them, I'd tasted the other ones but not those white ones   (.) so she sent three of them in for us.And he   (.) he caught her the other day, she was putting them out for the birds, she don't like them but she said    [laughing]  (        )  [] . (.) So he come in here he said Iris is putting those Ferrero Rocher things out onto the, onto the birds' table he said, she don't like them.He said she said they're like  (        ) .I said well what the hell's she doing Arthur, if she don't want them tell her to come, send them in here I said and give them to the kids.But that's all she sent in were those two.I said she might've sent a full packet   (        ) give one to Barry, one to Rhys and one to Cerys but there was only two  (        ) 
*HAZ:	Mm.Oh they're nice they are.

*HAZ:	 (        ) them open.
*MAR:	I know, I   (.) they haven't been open all this week.
*HAZ:	I've been, I was thinking today actually   (.) when I was walking up the road and I thought oh the   (        ) is shut again.They're gonna close down aren't they?
*MAR:	I think so.
*HAZ:	I think, I think that last erm break in has done it to death hasn't it?
*MAR:	Er they've still got a Father Christmas outfit in there er er   (        ) in one window   (.) the one next to the   (        ) shop.
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	But I've been up the road every day this week, not shopping but just out for a walk, you know?If I can get out, (        ) 
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	but most days   (.) but erm and the bar's right across the door and last week when I went out they still had er er one or two bits of Christmas stuff in the one window   (.) and some balls of er    (.)  (        ) in there.
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	But that window's completely cleared out now   (.) and it hasn't been open at all this week.
*HAZ:	No.
*CER:	 (        )  (.) 
*MAR:	Betty  says a window in Caerphilly had been knocked in, (        ) 
*HAZ:	Oh yeah?
*MAR:	There's a board up to that. (.) And where is the other one I saw?
*CER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	The wine store up the top end there, they   (        ) 
*HAZ:	Aye that's right.They've got erm
*MAR:	They've got a big piece of wood 
*HAZ:	they've got a board, yeah.
*MAR:	Yeah a board up   (        ) their window   (        ) 
*HAZ:	Yeah that's right. (        )  (.) 
*CER:	I did twelve.
*HAZ:	Mm. (.) 
*CER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	But you know it surprises me   (.) I mean I know the church is, is closed and it's been closed for a couple of years now   (.) and it looks a sight because   (.) now I don't know how many members they've got, at least a couple of them could go in there and cut all the brambles down.
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	I mean if you belong to a church you do something to make it look tidy don't you?I mean that church isn't in such a bad state   (        ) bloody fall on you all the time. (.) You go past there and you look in that front and people have been dumping bags of rubbish over there.
*HAZ:	Yeah, they will.
*MAR:	Little tiny white bags full with cans and odd   (.) just dump  (        ) , I mean there's no respect at all lately is there?You wouldn't think of doing it years ago
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	even if the church was    (        )  (.) And they've cut all the side, the other side  (        ) , Church Street   (.) they've cut all the hedge of the church down there and dumped all the grass inside, no not the grass, the branches, inside   (.) well you'd think they'd get a blooming lorry or a van to take it all down the blooming tip wouldn't you?
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	To ta just to make it look a bit respectable because   (.) it's a church, they're using that part of it.
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*MAR:	 (        ) absolutely terrible.I said to   (        ) 
*CER:	Nan 
*MAR:	about it the other day   (.) aye he says but they weren't supposed to cut anything down he said, they were only supposed to cut a bit off the top.Well I said that doesn't excuse the thing of, of tipping all over and putting it inside and not shifting it.It looks terrible.
*CER:	Nan which church 
*HAZ:	Mm.
*CER:	was the bit that's sticking out on the path.
*HAZ:	Yes.
*CER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	No somebody could go in there who belonged to the church anyway, two or three of them and it wouldn't take long cutting all those brambles and things away. (.) 
*CER:	Tt nan do you mean the Cubs' church?
*MAR:	Yes.
*CER:	Cos then they usually make fires.
*MAR:	Well I, I don't know what's stopping some of the  (        ) , they'll go up one day er there one day and they'll
*CER:	 [shouting] Why can't they leave   (        )  [] 
*MAR:	throw something over it would be up.
*CER:	Nan why can't they leave just a little patch of grass for the fire?
*MAR:	 (        ) .I said to Di if you want pea sticks that's the place to go because they've got    (        )  (.) and   (        ) he said oh I go   (        ) now.But er you'd think they'd get a lorry or something to shift it from there.
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	It's a fire hazard really isn't it? (.) You know with kids today. (.) And I tell you another thing I noticed, I cut through the car park in the lane behind Shirley's   (.) one day this week, I went through and    (        )  (.) and the back door of the old police station's open.And all the windows in the back are broken.
*HAZ:	Mm.
*MAR:	So I expect somebody's been and er the   (        ) er the door thing, you can get in the back way and in through the back door.I bet there's some people sleeping in there in the night. (.) 
*CER:	Someone could easily make a fire in there.
*MAR:	I mean if they're not gonna use the building and they can't sell it, gut it. (.) Cos they said they were gonna sell it then they changed their mind, they were gonna pull it down  (        ) 
*CER:	If they can't sell it, pull it down and put something else in.
*MAR:	It's no good   (        ) is it now?
*CER:	Put something else in like a flat.
*MAR:	Shouldn't think it's very nice inside. (.) There's room for flats I think.
*CER:	Mm.
*MAR:	Even on the ground floor. (.) 
*HAZ:	 [yawning] There was    (        )  [] 
*CER:	Nan.Ah ah!Is that all you've got on the line, one tea towel?
