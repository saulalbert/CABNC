*TER:	Fifty for one, Botham was out for eight
*MAR:	Oh dear, not again
*TER:	Yeah   (.) bit of a shame innit?
*MAR:	Oh dear I was thinking he was going easy
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	he was gonna take over from Gooch
*TER:	Yes
*MAR:	or whatever
*TER:	Smith is now in, he hasn't scored yet, fifty for one off thirteen overs
*MAR:	Mm  (.) 
*TER:	so providing they just play it steadily they should be alright, there's a lot of discrimination over the Australian defeat in the paper, they reckon that if erm
*MAR:	Only   (.) no, no, go on what was it?
*TER:	They reckon that if erm Australia lose another match it could mean that they won't even make the semi finals and erm they reckon like that, that channel nine that's supposed to be backing all this
*MAR:	Oh yeah, aha
*TER:	well they think they'll pull the plug on it
*MAR:	Oh yes
*TER:	and show re-runs of Neighbours instead, now can you think   [laughing] can you imagine    []  ((laugh)) anything worse than that?Oh dear, I thought that was funny   (.) yes   (.) cos there's been so much
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	in Australia, you know, I mean it was really a competition 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	just to show that Australia was gonna be champions again you know
*MAR:	Mm   (.) that and erm
*TER:	Australia play India next then they play England, that'll be a match and a half I think
*MAR:	Should be, especially with this erm, this
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	oh yes, yes
*MAR:	Do you want to take that?
*TER:	No I, well I'm gonna, yeah okay, but I mean she, well you're gonna be, you'll get up in a moment now won't you?
*MAR:	Er yes I'm gonna get up in a minute anyway, so
*TER:	Right, mm
*MAR:	Oh fancy Botham being out, I was hoping that, you know he was going easy
*TER:	Yes, I was
*MAR:	erm letting Gooch score 
*TER:	Perhaps he was going too easily you see, not playing his natural game, I mean it's, you never know do you?
*MAR:	Well perhaps it needn't where he just had   (.) plenty of porridge
*TER:	Yeah, yes
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Now I should be
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	should prefer cutting my hair, I'm not gonna have it cut quite so short this time I think
*TER:	Right
*MAR:	you know just have a little bit off it 
*TER:	Yeah 
*MAR:	taken off it, cos I was looking at the length of it when we were in France
*TER:	Mm, mm
*MAR:	and I think that looked a nicer length 
*TER:	Yeah , mm, now do you want to come up the town?Because I shall be going up the town
*MAR:	Yes after Lucy about, er yes that was what I was getting around to, by that time of course I should be erm
*TER:	It'll be finished in half an hour, yes
*MAR:	erm, so I would come up the town with you if I could think what for
*TER:	Oh right   ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TER:	it'll help, okay
