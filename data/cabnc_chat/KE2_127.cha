*TER:	Good morning! (.)  [sighing] Oh  [] !
*UNK:	Alright?Thank you very much indeed!
*UNK:	Thanks.Bye!
*UNK:	Thank you.Bye bye then!
*TER:	Thank you!
*UNK:	Hello.
*TER:	Have you any erm   (.) stamps?
*UNK:	First class or second class sir?
*TER:	Second class.
*UNK:	Yes.
*TER:	Five please.
*UNK:	Right.Certainly!I'll get those for you. (.) Give that gentleman his paper.There you are.
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	Lovely!Thank you very much!
*UNK:	Thanks Mr .Five seconds my love.
*TER:	That'll do.
*UNK:	Let's see what we've got, ooh I dunno if I've got, ooh yes I have!Yes I have!That'll be ninety pence won't it?Five tens are 
*TER:	That's right!
*UNK:	fifty, five eights are forty, ninety pence.Good job I learnt my tables when I was at school!
*TER:	 ((laugh))  (.) There's a lot that don't do it these days!
*UNK:	Well my son does.They're very hard   (        ) at his school, we've always done them!It's very important!
*TER:	It's ever so important!
*UNK:	But, from an early age because without 
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	tables you can't do multiplication, (        ) 
*TER:	It takes so , it takes so long to do everything you see.
*UNK:	You can't do anything!
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	You know, and I mean where he used to go to school they didn't teach them them till they were ten!What the hell of a use is that!
*TER:	No good at all!
*UNK:	So I mean he is very, very good at his tables and   (.) we bought one of those Early Learning   (.) tapes when he was quite young that you sing 
*TER:	Yeah.
*UNK:	to.
*TER:	Mm.
*UNK:	And I always learnt mine parrot fashion using 
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	sticks.
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	And then we   (.) got a table tester   (.) to help them refresh their memories, it's like a disc and then you got the slots and then it tells you your eight times and that's good as well but   (.) I mean he's got them off by heart which is brilliant!
*TER:	Well it it saves so much time as well you see because and you get on so much quicker with everything!
*UNK:	Well absolutely!And I mean, fortunately he is very good at his maths and he's quick at his sums and things because he knows his tables.There's erm 
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	so much difference!
*TER:	Well I've got, I pu put a program on, I've got a computer and I 
*UNK:	Oh yes!
*TER:	put a program on the computer   (.) for maths
*UNK:	Oh right!
*TER:	and it's er   (.) it's erm   (.) it's a table program   (.) amongst others, adding 
*UNK:	Oh that's good!
*TER:	and subtraction and multiplication.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*TER:	But, you know they can pick it and er, it just flashes up and they have to put the right answer in, if they get the right answer it it goes on to the next one, if it
*UNK:	Oh that's good!
*TER:	get the wrong answer
*UNK:	Yeah.
*TER:	then i it says no that's wrong!Sorry la  (.) whatever he name is that   (        ) 
*UNK:	What age group is that for then?
*TER:	Well this is really for anybody learning the tables.But, primarily it's it's it's, you know   (.) top end of the primary school.
*UNK:	Oh it sounds good!
*TER:	But you co could go on, I mean if you if they don't know it you can still use it when they get to secondary school.
*UNK:	What computer is that then?
*TER:	Oh it's er, it's erm
*UNK:	B B C   (        ) or 
*TER:	It's a Tandy actually , it's one I had 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*TER:	given me   (.) about eight 
*UNK:	Right.
*TER:	years ago.So, and it's an old one actually
*UNK:	Oh!
*TER:	but I've put, put my own program so that the 
*UNK:	Ah!That's a good idea!
*TER:	But how old is your
*UNK:	He's nearly ten.Yeah.Nearly ten.But he has,we we've only got, my husband's got a computer at work, we just got one of the Segas, the master systems you know that you you got th the games that you put in those   (.) but he wants to get another one next year   (.) but that's a good idea something like that!Should be very good for schools I would think, wouldn't it?
*TER:	Well, yes of course, I mean I, the schools have got programs I mean you can, you know   (.) they er 
*UNK:	Yeah.Yeah.
*TER:	Da ta  (.)  (        ) for it.
*UNK:	Yes.But that's, I think that's a brilliant idea actually!Because where he goes is a smaller school where they go   (.) and erm   (.) I think something like that is nice for them to actually   (        ) 
*TER:	Where does he go?
*UNK:	He goes to a school in the Tene Valley, it's a teacher that, he used to go to Exeter school and the teacher's opened her own school   (.) and, only for lo a small time and then she's opening up actually in Exeter but this is an in between and she's a very good teacher!
*TER:	That's great, you see!
*UNK:	And you see she's bringing him on very well!
*TER:	Yeah.
*UNK:	I mean there's only a few kids there, they're all good mates and it's like private tuition.But, I 
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	mean you pay for it, course you do but then 
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	on the ar , we well you know we've paid for his education since he was seven because he wasn't doing anything at primary school!Half the teachers le left them doing nothing!
*TER:	It's a shame really!
*UNK:	Yeah!Yeah!But er   (.) you know, and it would have been such a waste cos he's bright.But that he was always naughty!They used to write back and they said he was always being sent out and I said that's because he's bored!He couldn't be bothered   (.) you see.And how many more children slip through the net that way?
*TER:	That's right.
*UNK:	It's very true.An and so we we said right, that's it!We'll have to get him out and   (.) pay for it and it's   (.) worked total dividends!I mean he's very good at   (.) maths.They say maths and science are his strength subjects well I'd never have known that if he was still over there!I was just told he was a   (.) a fair average.You know?
*UNK:	Erm can I have sixteen of those   (        ) there?
*UNK:	How many darling?
*UNK:	Sixteen.
