                                     it's better when, they're, the big ones

                           have been there longer than she thought, and so
                           she'd got her ... car clamped ... and it was thirty
                           pound to have it off but
Ann (PS01U)                [3699] Yes.
Joyce (PS01V)              [3700] she hadn't got thirty pound on her.
                           [3701] Took her little boy to the hospital.
                           [3702] So ... the attendant says to her, have you
                           got a wrist watch and she hadn't got her wrist watch
                           on, but he spotted her wedding ring ... and he said,
                           I'll take that ... and she said, she had to hand her
                           wedding er ring over and she vowed when she put that
                           on that she would never
Ann (PS01U)                [3703] Mm mm.
Joyce (PS01V)              [3704] take that off.
                           [3705] And then she said here she was hanging,
                           handing it to a stranger and you know what they said

Ann (PS01U)                [3706] So she could get her wheel, get her car back.
Joyce (PS01V)              [3707] to get her car back, you know what they said
                           ... if she doesn't pay that thirty pound within six
                           weeks they'll pawn it!
Ann (PS01U)                [3708] Mm.
Joyce (PS01V)              [3709] They'll auction it

Ann (PS01U)                [4546] I says erm ... yo it'd be cheaper to go bed

Ann (PS01U)                [4549] yeah but it won't be as convenient with baby
                           like.

Ann (PS01U)                [4551] Yeah.
Joyce (PS01V)              [4552] want, and if their baby wakes at night they
                           can just go
Ann (PS01U)                [4553] Yeah.

Joyce (PS01V)              [4556] Mm.

Joyce (PS01V)              [4563] Mm.
Ann (PS01U)                [4564] You know, I think erm ... rather than they
