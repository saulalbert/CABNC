*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	He said you weren't to let a new dog off the lead until he had   (        ) for six weeks
*CHR:	Gosh!
*MUM:	I think perhaps if you go over the field after Ben she would make  (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah.
*MUM:	After about six weeks you know.
*TON:	He certainly seems to know his way around now doesn't he? ((laugh))

*JAC:	But once I decide that's settled I'd notice it cause you couldn't seem to get down.All the others you didn't see cause they're down at the bottom so when this lot  (        ) 
*MUM:	Hm mm
*JAC:	So that particular one seems to be   (        ) late tonight.And it's as if it wasn't floating on the surface and it was doing all the things that fishes do but it was
*MUM:	Is  (        ) 
*JAC:	What is it?They called it dropsy.

*TON:	Ah ha    (.)  ((cough))  (.) 
*JAC:	Gosh! (.) He's got a coat just like Ben's hasn't he?
*MUM:	Yeah.Silky and er
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*MUM:	No I don't I made it like mug soup not plain soup.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	So greeny isn't it?
*MUM:	Yeah. ((cough)) Let the grain go well er matured  ((laugh)) 
*TON:	Oh I loved that bit in Shogun I don't know if you remember it.Or whether you saw it at all.But they had er Richard Chamberlain shot pheasant
*MUM:	Yeah
*TON:	And he hung it up outside his house
*MUM:	Yeah
*TON:	To let it get   (.) let it rot.Let it get gamey and he's erm Chinese assistant the person who has been assigned to sort of look after him and do his do his translating and things like that took it down and buried it   ((laughter))cause they didn't eat rotten meat they did   ((laughter)) (.) 
*TON:	Oh you can't beat a wet shave  (.) 
*MUM:	I don't like Gillette  (.) 
*MAR:	No. (.) 
*TON:	You can't beat a wet shave   (.) I find I find I mean people have said that oh having a wet shave makes my face sore and things like that.I find that using an electric shaver makes your face sore cause you're rubbing your face all the time.Whereas
*MUM:	But I mean with a blade it's only one
*TON:	That's right
*MUM:	Yeah yeah .
*TON:	and it's all I mean I use this gel stuff
*MUM:	Hm
*TON:	which doesn't dry the skin dry the skin out or anything and erm it's just like washing your face with water.I mean it doesn't   (.) I used to hate it when I was doing plays there and you have er grease paint on and you'd be you'd try and you'd have to cream on your face to get the grease grease paint off .
*MUM:	Get it off .
*TON:	And so you'd be putting lots and lots of grease and much on your skin and then you get spots.
*MUM:	Yeah
*TON:	And you'd be trying to shave and you don't want to cut spots.
*MUM:	Err!
*TON:	Oh!Horrible! ((sniff)) 
*MUM:	And the cream actually brought you out in spots did it?That they were putting on or was it the actual make up or?
*TON:	Well it's just it's not the the grease the make up or the cream it's the fact that you're you're putting so much muck on your skin all the time and it clogs up pores and causes spots. (.) Cause you have to put a lot of cream on your face to get the make up off   (.) and you do that especially if you're doing two performances a day   (.) it's an awful lot mess and much you're putting on your face and you can't get it all off  (.) 
*MUM:	Done anything about a Christmas presents yet Jack?
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*MUM:	Yeah.
*JAC:	 (        ) which   ((cough)) got a lot more space.
*MUM:	Oh!
*JAC:	Three drawers down one side and it's got it
*MUM:	Oh!
*JAC:	And there's a support the other side is a book shelf.
*MUM:	Oh that's nice.
*TON:	Hm.
*MUM:	Yeah
*CHR:	 (        ) got one exactly the same as that except it's wooden.It's got three doors one side and a book shelf the other side.
*TON:	Hm.
*CHR:	It's wood.It's got red handles.
*MUM:	As same as  (        ) 
*TON:	Is it nice?
*JAC:	Yeah.
*MUM:	Where's that Grace is it?
*CHR:	Yeah.
*TON:	Hm.
*JAC:	It's like you know at the moment
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	On the bookshelf of the   (        ) side.
*TON:	Oh.
*JAC:	You might be able to decide which side you want it on then Christine.
*CHR:	Yeah
*TON:	Yeah .
*JAC:	Because if you're right handed 
*TON:	It's a flat pack Yeah.
*CHR:	Mum is it wooden?
*JAC:	I don't know.It's erm
*TON:	Well it er it will be wood but whether it's covered over whether it's wood grain or whether it's white or I don't know.
*MUM:	They might have a selection.They might have it done in white black and wood.
*TON:	Hm. (.) 
*JAC:	So we I think we might go with  mightn't we?
*MUM:	Hm mm.
*TON:	Hm. (.) 
*MUM:	Did she decide what she's doing with her money yet?Still making less   (        )  ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	She's more or less   (        ) she's er
*TON:	We're gonna have to hurry up now.
*JAC:	Yes.She's going get Aunty Iris'  (        ) 
*MUM:	 (        ) yeah.
*JAC:	And if there's any over she might be able to get some other bits for it.
*MUM:	Desk yeah.
*TON:	I mean she she might want to buy   (.) a nice desk.No she's got a desk tidy.
*JAC:	She's got a desk tidy.
*TON:	Yeah
*JAC:	What might be an idea is to get her some good blotters.Not ones with blotting paper.
*TON:	No no I know
*TON:	Yeah I know.
*MUM:	Yeah because this one because it's easier to write on than er than a wooden .
*JAC:	Yeah it's like er a very a layer of plastic with a very thin layer of sort of felt underneath.So when you write it's soft.It's was like you were writing on a writing pad.Because you don't feel right on wooden table it's quite hard isn't it?
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Well it makes it it's a nice soft surface for you to write on.
*CHR:	You mean something like sort of like a board.Like Daddy had in  (        ) 
*TON:	That's right.
*CHR:	Yeah only  (        ) 
*JAC:	This   (        ) After having a think.I reckon most of your books will go in that bookcase.Which would mean you could you could have your work
*CHR:	I could put my little shell boxes on top of the shelf.
*JAC:	That's right.You could put all sorts of little things in there.But let's wait and see cause I'll take you out and we'll have a look.Perhaps next weekend.
*MUM:	Yeah.What is it another free weekend?
*CHR:	Right I reckon I'm going to get   (        )  (.) 
*TON:	 ((cough)) he just folds up.
*MUM:	Peculiar.You'd never think he'd go into that sort of ball. ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	I must admit they're lovely to cuddle because they do curl up into a ball.They love cuddling.
*CHR:	Oh yeah. (        ) 
*JAC:	Let's wait and see.
*TON:	See what we can get.
*JAC:	If there isn't any chance you could get a  (        ) 
*CHR:	I'd just love to get that.
*UNK:	Could I? (.) 
*CHR:	Make it first on the lead.
*CHR:	No.Because I think Thursday Daddy'll be working.
*CHR:	Oh yeah well
*JAC:	You've got to have it when   (.) there's least disturbance.
*TON:	There are   (.) two problems with that.There are things certain things I'm committed to and   (.) to have   (.) time off means I still got to be able to do those things.Do you see what I mean?So I've got to watch that.But I could manage.I could certainly manage to have a half day.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	And if we we're looking around in town.
*JAC:	Well we will be.
*CHR:	Could I have a day off?
*JAC:	It's a bit late.
*TON:	Okay but
*JAC:	This is it.If we going out   (        ) 
*TON:	you'd have to you'd have to come and get me and we'd go straight off .
*JAC:	Well the thing is 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	The thing is.
*TON:	The other thing erm is that I haven't got any leave.

*TON:	Yeah.I haven't got any leave.What I've got enough leave to take the time off over Christmas.That's all agreed.But I haven't got any extra.And I already took a half day off flexi leave .
*JAC:	Daddy'll   (        ) we'll have to do it .
*TON:	I've already took a half day off flexy leave to have my driving test last week
*MUM:	And if you do it on the tenth  (        ) 
*TON:	Hm.Erm and I really want to   (.) I will build up some more time but I haven't got any to take at the moment.
