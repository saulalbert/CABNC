@Comment:	conversation #72 (Tape 015701)
*JEA:	Said John, well, we've got other ideas we'd like you to come to us for Christmas, so I thought, as I said to Brenda, you don't turn down an invitation from your own children  ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	That's right, yeah.
*JEA:	But, actually I was   (        ) 
*BRE:	You don't go every year .
*JEA:	I certainly am not.I was looking forward actually to looking after Neil
*BRE:	It was one year she could of done without the invitation though isn't it?, if she, if she wanted her other friends and Neil.
*JEA:	Definitely , yes, and you, you and Dave could have come up and er Carla, perhaps not Lee , but, you know, he may have wanted to go off somewhere else, erm, we could all have bunked down on what spare space there was and I was going to do a very primitive almost medieval, middle ages sort of Christmas
*BRE:	Well that's what we said, but , right.
*JEA:	I wasn't going to rush around buying horribly expensive things like smoke salmon that I couldn't afford, I was going to do a big family feast and I was going to get in a few games like the monopoly or   [laughing] lotto or you know  [] , I just, I haven't worked it out but I thought oh what fun
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	and then, invited to be a good, to be a good mum and a good  (        ) .
*BRE:	No, I mean, that's what it's all about, I mean the fact is
*JEA:	I shall enjoy it and I, I very touched that they   (        ) 
*BRE:	Well one year it used to be that she come to us at dinner time
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and then go to Lenny's in, in the evening.
*JEA:	Mm, mm
*BRE:	You know
*JEA:	yeah, yeah.
*BRE:	and I mean it used to be the fact, oh god well we've got to sort of have dinner at twelve o'clock, we've got to be round there by four.
*JEA:	Well do you know, when I met, I, I'm meeting old chaps through this very excellent marriage agency, I've never expected any thing like it, they are marvellous, and the sent me a nice old lad, but I knew I was onto a looser when he said, of course I go to my daughter-in-law every Saturday for lunch, she absolutely insists because she says, she wants to make sure that I'm eating properly, now this is a very healthy old man with a very good income who could afford to buy any food he wants and the fact of the matter is his that he's son is probably not, he doesn't want to upset his old dad, and it's handy to have him to come on Saturday for lunch and be done with it as it were, but I thought surely Bernard  your own sense would tell you that nobody want's their old father and father-in-law every Saturday of their life, for lunch oh   (        ) .
*BRE:	Honestly   (        ) do all the time .
*JEA:	Oh no.
*DAV:	Terrible, it's a problem in it?
*BRE:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	My watch.
*BRE:	Took the watch to repair it.
*JEA:	 ((laugh)) it didn't get repaired.
*BRE:	Didn't get repaired.
*JEA:	We, we felt we had a lot of talking to do.
*BRE:	You know, that's why we thought we'd come back cos we thought we hadn't talked much.
*JEA:	 ((laugh)) .
*DAV:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	Oh very handy why?
*DAV:	That be.
