*PS04Y:	old ferry coming over from erm Harwich to the Hook of Holland And I I used to sort of sit in er put sit myself in my little erm bunk you know . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	And the the swaying of the ship and I used to sleep like a log Everybody else round me was being sick Not me . 
*PS04U:	I did n't sleep very well at all Up and down up and down all night . 
*PS04Y:	You have . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	Why . 
*PS04U:	Do n't know I . 
*PS04Y:	Excitement . 
*PS04U:	I think a lot of it you know I was burning a bit so I think a lot of it was sort of it thinking about that blooming boiler . 
*PS04Y:	Yes Yes . 
*PS04U:	And then you know Dave I think drew he was he was ever so ever so restless I do n't know whether he was expecting the water to burst or what it was . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah I know Ooh I know . 
*PS04U:	Cos when I went to bed I mean you know I tested it and it did n't seem too bad . 
*PS04Y:	No No . 
*PS04U:	It seemed sort of hot but er I mean that 's the trouble at the moment because even if it 's something minor thing it seems so dramatic . 
*PS04Y:	Exactly . 
*PS04U:	You know especially to me at the moment .  29093_30553
*PS04Y:	Yes .  30553_30643
*PS04U:	I do n't know why The smallest thing I mean it seems such a .  30643_31963
*PS04Y:	Well I think there must this must be a very common feeling for a lot of people that they feel that they 're balanced on a knife edge There 's so much we 've had to pay out so much erm you 've had to pay out so much on on more mortgage than you expected .  31963_39883
*PS04U:	Mm Did you saying that did you see that programme on let me think oh dear It was on repossession One day in the week or the week before It was on er channel four I think it was and it was all about these people that had been you know encouraged to buy this house and then repossessed .  39883_46963
*PS04Y:	Mm Mm .  46963_47083
*PS04U:	And did you watch it .  47083_47583
*PS04Y:	No I did n't see that one .  47583_48453
*PS04U:	Oh it was horrible And it was how people you know did n't want to er and they would n't And they were saying that you do n't give the local erm mp was saying you know people just give their kids up and walk away .  48453_53153
*PS04Y:	Mhm yes Mm .  53153_53513
*PS04U:	And but it was awful you know There was so many of them .  53513_54813
*PS04Y:	It should not happen I I mean I think it somewhere somebody is being greedy It should n't happen And it seems to have happened because thirty years ago everybody like Jerry and me had a repayment mortgage which meant there were very few endowment mortgages .  54883_62383
*PS04U:	Mm .  62383_62443
*PS04Y:	Now a repayment mortgage they will extend the term of the mortgage .  62453_64203
*PS04U:	Yeah but when we had a when we had .  64203_65103
*PS04Y:	And the endowment you ca n't extend it Well I think they should make it so that you can extend it .  65193_69183
*PS04U:	Yeah but when they .  69183_69653
*PS04Y:	I just do n't think I just do n't think repossessions should happen .  69653_71383
*PS04U:	But repayment now is due as an endowment .  72653_74323
*PS04Y:	Well they should do something about it Brenda That 's all I can say There should be some certain fund for bailing out people who are in real terrible difficulties Because you see .  74323_79553
*PS04U:	Yeah because .  79553_80213
*PS04Y:	people people are not being helped It 's like my Neil Nobody was helping him .  80473_82813
*PS04U:	Nobody wants to know do they .  82813_84583
*PS04Y:	No they do n't .  84583_84813
*PS04U:	Not with things sort of going on there 's and now you think sort of it it 's time when people sort of would club together .  84813_87793
*PS04Y:	Yes .  87793_87933
*PS04U:	But it was saying er this this programme was saying that that erm that they were buying a house And it was telling you you know say they were for argument 's sake they was buying this house that was sort of up north and that And they were buying this house and it was worth something like I do n't know they were they 'd got a twenty five grand mortgage .  87933_98193
*PS04Y:	Mm .  98193_98253
*PS04U:	They had n't got it it was n't I mean you know to us it was qu a cheap mortgage but sort of up there it was probably you know sort of .  98253_101343
*PS04Y:	Mm Mm .  101563_101683
*PS04U:	a lot of money to him cos there 's not the work and that And they 'd bought this mortgage and their repayment was something like about I du n no a hundred and eighty pound a month .  101683_108253
*PS04Y:	Mm .  108253_108313
*PS04U:	And they said you know and then all of a sudden it had sort of gone up six percent .  108313_110153
*PS04Y:	Yes That 's right .  110313_111153
*PS04U:	And it was five hundred quid .  111153_111963
*PS04Y:	Mm .  112003_112063
*PS04U:	And there was no way you know at a hundred and eighty they 'd struggled .  112063_114243
*PS04Y:	Mm Mm .  114243_114363
*PS04U:	And they thought because most people were were sort of us We thought oh we 'll go for it .  114363_117063
*PS04Y:	Yes Yes .  117063_117273
*PS04U:	It 's gon na be a struggle for a year But you go for it .  117273_119583
*PS04Y:	Yeah of course .  119643_119703
*PS04U:	And you do n't dream of it .  121963_122463
*PS04Y:	No Nobody ever dreamed .  122463_123123
*PS04U:	going up .  123123_123373
*PS04Y:	Nobody ever dreamed of this .  123373_124033
*PS04U:	I mean they reckon it 's gon na go back up now do n't they .  124033_125083
*PS04Y:	Yeah Probably will I you see I think that instead of instead of Lawson putting interest rates up to squeeze inflation out of the economy he should have stopped all credit When Jerry and I were young if at the end of the month there was no money in the account the bank used to write you a filthy letter if you were two pounds overdrawn And you had if it was no good you wanting something and waving a bit of plastic at it There was no bit of plastic to wave then .  125083_138513
*PS04U:	There was n't .  138513_138753
*PS04Y:	Not a thing If you wanted to borrow money from the bank to to buy anything there were two ways of getting money You could go to the bank and ask for a loan And mostly you got a dusty answer because if you had n't got shares to put down as collateral you did n't get your loan And the other way of doing it was to go on hire purchase And when you wanted to buy something like a three piece suite you went to somewhere like Bentalls and they took you into a little room soon as you said to the man well I want to buy this on hire purchase and you went in to a little room and the man sat down and you filled in a long form You told him what your husband earned Erm what you er what you could manage in the way of repayments what er er you had to put one third of the full price down .  138753_161273
*PS04U:	Is that when you and Jerry were first married or .  161273_162463
*PS04Y:	Yes Yeah you had to put one third of the full price So if a three piece suite cost say a hundred and fifty pounds you had to put fifty pounds down And the the hundred over over two years on on interest .  162463_168223
*PS04U:	So people could n't get in that state could they You .  168223_169363
*PS04Y:	You you could not get into debt Brenda You were not allowed to .  169363_171393
*PS04U:	What you could afford you had .  171393_172023
*PS04Y:	Exactly Exactly .  172023_172633
*PS04U:	Now when did the I suppose the credit card they brought but as to what you say I mean the these these repossessions it 's not the fact they ca n't afford the mortgage It 's the fact they ca n't afford all the the the lifestyle to go with it that 's what Dave says I mean the fact is you know there 's blokes at work Same mortgage as us and earning the same as Dave I mean you know they 're in a dreadful state .  173523_186013
*PS04Y:	Mm .  186013_186073
*PS04U:	I mean they spend their wages before .  186523_188393
*PS04Y:	Mm .  188393_188453
*PS04U:	And I think it 's because they go out drinking and you know .  188453_189603
*PS04Y:	Mm .  189603_189663
*PS04U:	They 're always buying things for the home And the cars I mean majority of blokes at Dave 's firm have changed their cars three times .  189663_193633
*PS04Y:	Yeah Yeah I know People have come to expect that Now you could do it in the nineteen seventies and er well yes I would say from nineteen sixty eight onwards with plastic card and revolv what 's called revolving credit You could just run up the credit I mean my all my efforts after Christmas will be to get rid of these card debts I promised .  193663_204533
*PS04U:	Yeah but with you it 's I mean alright you do n't want it over you but you will clear it .  204533_206433
*PS04Y:	Oh yes .  206433_206613
*PS04U:	But thing is there 's a lot of people that that that do n't .  206723_208773
*PS04Y:	No Quite Quite .  209133_210073
*PS04U:	I mean I know I told you this .  210073_210663
*PS04Y:	I mean the only reason I 'm I 'm running up these debts is that now I 've got so little capital left that I 've got to keep the capital for sheer disasters like the boiler .  210663_214953
*PS04U:	Mm .  214953_215013
*PS04Y:	And because you 've got to pay that in cash .  215013_216033
*PS04U:	But there 's people that you know are still now spending them at Christmas It 's like Jen still spending them You know he 's still got like two holidays left on them .  216033_223193
*PS04Y:	Mm .  223193_223283

*PS04Y:	Yeah I mean I I now will do no spending .  225323_226283
*PS04U:	Yeah but you you did n't have thousands outstanding before you you know by spending yours like yesterday You did n't think to yourself oh god I owe five hundred pound on Marks and Sparks I 'll top it up .  226283_232563
*PS04Y:	No I had a fifty pound debt .  232563_233432
*PS04U:	That 's it .  233443_233593
*PS04Y:	And when the er and I 've now got what Er three hundred Now that when as soon as I get my cheque from the British Legion for two hundred roughly I wo n't wait for the card for the bill to come in for the card I shall send that off to Marks I wo n't wait for them to send to me .  233593_243713
*PS04U:	Oh can you send it off .  243713_244203

*PS04U:	So it encourages people even more does n't it .  267913_269143
*PS04Y:	Course it does .  269143_269973

*PS04U:	But what it was they were like it was like G A N do them er Man and Co And they had sort of like a job like Dave 's and a lot of them what they 've done is they 've bought in this area I mean probably most areas they 've bought the repossessed they 've got about eight or nine houses they 're either renting them out or they 're leaving them empty The majority of them are empty round here .  398263_413573
*PS04Y:	Mm .  413573_413633

*PS04U:	Sell them at .  420893_421203
*PS04Y:	parcel them out amongst the estate agents And the estate agents do n't want to know Because people do n't want to buy a repossessed house For one thing they think it 's unlucky And the second thing is that repossessed houses very very quickly begin to look dirty and battered .  421863_429973
*PS04U:	Mm .  429993_430053
