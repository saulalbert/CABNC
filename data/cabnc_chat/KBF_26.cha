And   (.) you had get the two people who were at the back, you have to get them out   (.) before you landed because when you   (.) when you brought the flaps up   (.) if they were still in this little bay you would squash them to death   (.) and one day   (.) his dials showed that he had, in fact, [laughing] squashed them to death  [] !
*BRE:	Oh!
*JEA:	But he hadn't.
*BRE:	He hadn't?
*JEA:	No. ((car starting))
*BRE:	Come on car, don't start playing on me now when I want to get home  (        ) .
*JEA:	 ((yawn)) Ooh don't, at the thought of tea!
*BRE:	So it's like that without, I mean, with Carla, I mean, you can't   (.) you know, you just can't think when you've gotta   (.) I mean she would have been bored and she wouldn't have looked at the gifts.
*JEA:	Of course, poor little child! (.) No! (.) No!
*BRE:	Oh you're clever.
*JEA:	 [laughing] Ah ah dear me  [] .
*BRE:	I can't get out u any o another other way!
*JEA:	 [laughing] No    []  (.) oh dear       (.)  [laughing]  (        )  []  (.) Neil said yesterday   (.) he was running   (.) he was running in thr in through the hall way with   (        ) karate suit or something   (.) he was muttering to himself and he said smoking   (.) a healthy, dirty habit, it's expensive and it shortens your life   (.) I love it! ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	 ((laugh))  (.) No it's dreadful    (.)  (        ) they are   (.) give it up but I said 
*JEA:	 ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	I    (        )  (.) with my nerves at the moment.
*JEA:	Oh no an it it's   (.) it's like slimming   (.) nobody should try to slim when they're feeling tense and agitated and worried about things.
*BRE:	I'll go up Tescos way   (.) sure it gets busy over here, dunnit though?
*JEA:	Yes well 
*BRE:	I mean it's not packed though, the shops weren't   (.) I mean tomorrow morning   (.) it'll be   (.) m murder there   (.) it'll be 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	people with kids, see at night time 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	they don't 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	come with the kids.
*JEA:	No, no   (.) I'm looking forward to coming back here in the Spring   (.) and having another go at clothes for you and me   (.) I'm going to save like mad.
*BRE:	Might have won the   (        ) Jean
*JEA:	Oh I 
*BRE:	in the Spring.
*JEA:	I should   (.) I should have some idea about selling the house.
*BRE:	We all know, sort of, what's, sort of , happening.
*JEA:	That's right.
*BRE:	Cos, I mean you've got the feeling that, didn't you that   (.) Neil might move on.
*JEA:	Nope   (.) I don't think he'll leave me until he marries.
*BRE:	No I don't   (.) apart from getting married I don't think he'll leave you!
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	I th I think though, you know, after a year or two if he'd moved away an  (.) if he moved out the area he would then break with his mother.
*JEA:	Yes
*BRE:	It's the fact, that's how I see it.
*JEA:	I'm seriously 
*BRE:	the fact 
*JEA:	thinking
*BRE:	mother was, sort , up in Wisbeach 
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	and I was in Surrey.
*JEA:	That's right.A lot depends   (.) on   (.) what point I sell my house   (.) if I 
*BRE:	What price you get.
*JEA:	Yeah, if I sell at a time when there's still a recession on   (.) and you see   (.) somebody has to get my   (        ) they had a visit   (.) perhaps that was somebody that actually bought a house, not she not   (        ) 
*BRE:	She 
*JEA:	they haven't to sold the house   (.) they had a visit from a Bank Manager   (.) her preferential mortgage treatment   (.) as part of their   (.) immonuments   (.) they always have had
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	the bank seems to pay the   (        ) a cripplingly low salary   (.) demand that everybody dresses in   (.) in Saville Row, but   (.) you could buy a house on a something like two and half percent mortgage   (.) well it's not like that now, but it's still   (.) still get a preferential mortgage   (.) and this banking person   (.) man was looking around only three or four weeks ago, but     (.)  (        )  (.) you see a lot depends on your luck as to whether   (.) you pick up a   (.) a very good buyer.
*BRE:	Is your   (.) friends have they had anybody look at theirs yet?
*JEA:	They had a couple of people round, but no   (.) no nibbles, or I think, yes, I think somebody a   (.) silly offer because of course all the   (.) property pages and places like that, Daily Telegraph are urging everybody, go on   (.) put in an offer for a house, put in a silly offer!
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	Which is all very well, but nobody's phoning in to accept a silly offer.
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	This is why, at the moment, I'm being a bit cautious about   (        ) remaining in my cavity   (.) I don't want to find myself in the situation that I'm held   (.) to sell.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	That's why I'm so keen, I shall I tell you what my plan is, at the moment but as soon as the   (.) the uncourteous Bill   (.) has decided to   (.) move into his   (.) new house   (.) new flat, rather, I am going to take my ensuite back
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	yeah, I'm going to go back into my bedroom   (.) and Neil can still use the ensuite shower cos he's got the tip of the idea that he's got to come in   (.) clothed   (.) and knock on the door   (.) cos last time I was in my bedroom he asked if he could use the shower, (        ) situation    (        )  (.) he'd   (        ) you know, and I'd let him   (.) after all, it's not as though my be , there's a door between my bedroom and the
*BRE:	Shower, that's right.
*JEA:	the ensuite   (.) and er   (.) and then I will have three lodgers, I will have Neil
*BRE:	Mind you Neil's not worried about parading around with nothing on, is he?
*JEA:	Oh well I made him worry
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	my goodness, I have! (.)  (        ) .
*BRE:	Don't you like his new dressing gown, he was in 
*JEA:	Love that 
*BRE:	last time?
*JEA:	yes.
*BRE:	What was he like, when you took   (.) cos you took the boxer shorts
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	dressing gown and some 
*JEA:	all 
*BRE:	silly bits, oh no sweets   (.) biscuits 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	was it?
*JEA:	 (        ) some money, you spent on me   (.) ooh! ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	I bet he was like a big child, was he?
*JEA:	Yes, of course he is, he is a poor child   (.) I hate to think what Christmas is like for some people.
*BRE:	Do you think she'll buy him something   (        ) 
*JEA:	I have no doubt wha did I not tell you about the fact that I hit the roof when he said that   (.) she has said that when he was twenty one, she was going to buy him a Vauxhall Chevette.
*BRE:	Sh she's going to?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	Well why didn't she pay for his lessons then?
*JEA:	Well that's I say 
*BRE:	that's when he wanted help.
*JEA:	I said it's sh I said, I he said don't you think it's a nice gesture? (.) I think that is showing off! (.) I said I   (        ) 
*BRE:	How he's supposed to tax and insure it and run it? (        ) have said!
*JEA:	Well that's I said   (.) that's what I said an  (.) and I said where's she going to, where are we going to put it.
*BRE:	Just because you've passed your test doesn't mean 
*JEA:	Oh I 
*BRE:	I mean, it's years normally before someone can get a car.
*JEA:	You can tell what sort of a 
*BRE:	You can use   (        ) 
*JEA:	fool the woman is! (.) She is dreadful! (.) Does it strike an answering chord with your mother?
*BRE:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	I have no doubt that if they owned their council house   (.) they would now be very busily   (.) selling and buying and   [laughing] selling and buying  [] .
*BRE:	She's   (.) sh she's a bitch, she's a oh has she still got that horse?
*JEA:	Oh I have no doubt   (.) of course I never   (.) I despise the woman so heartily that I never ask any questions about it.
*BRE:	How does Neil get on with y Philip?
*JEA:	Very well, they all three get on well together.
*BRE:	Oh they do?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	I was very surprised about Tony though.
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	Cos I remember you saying about he didn't really want to know did he, about the ad er   (.) er
*JEA:	Neil's boss, no   (.) no he said oh I think I'll wash my hands of Neil   (.) I thought that's another one   (.) If I don't stick by Neil 
*BRE:	If he was still living with you   (.) he wouldn't wash his hands of Neil, would he?
*JEA:	He might have done, he's very a strong mighty chap and I don't know that   (.) anything I said could have influenced him   (.) and anyway Brenda to be perfectly honest I wo I wo 
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	I wouldn't be doing it   (.) I wouldn't dare! (.) I, I mean, I   (.) at the moment I'm not doing anything about Neil's training because   (.) we've got coming and it's   (.) it's too soon to start   (.) stirring up the bud again.
*BRE:	I think you probably could have stopped anyway   (        ) 
*JEA:	Yes, quite, yes 
*BRE:	you know, wouldn't it?
*JEA:	Exactly   (.) yes we'll take a breathing space until the new year   (.) I mean Neil says that at the moment he'd be quite happy to   (.) get into a job   (.) where if he was a good worker he could   (.) progress in the job   (.) and I said an what about doing your   (.) radio repairs in the evening, but he just, he said yes.
*BRE:	I said, well was it like a part-time thing?
*JEA:	Yeah well you see   (.) you can make quite a few   (.) nice little pounds for yourself   (.) if you can say to your friends   (.) I can undercut   (.) I won't chat while you get across here   (.) if you can say to your friends   (.) I can   (.) do it cheaper than the
*BRE:	Well you can it's like 
*JEA:	standard repair.
*BRE:	Dave   (.) these computer been   (.) you know   (.) up in the air for about six months and Dave said you've gotta get it repaired he said, cos you know y he's gotta print out on it and everything 
*JEA:	Aha, aha 
*BRE:	a lot of his work is, sort of, rather than getting copies you just do a printout
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	and erm   (.) you know, and I said Carla needs it for work   (.) anyway so Dave said I'm gonna while I'm on holiday I'm gonna do all the stupid jobs, so I can take that computer in
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	and he said only cost about twenty cost about twenty five quid to get 
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	repaired
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	took it in and they said well they have to send it away and Dave said, yeah okay, he said well   (.) it's forty nine pound   (.) before you start
*JEA:	Oh no!
*BRE:	and erm   (.) providing it's nothing, sort of major   (.) and that forty nine pounds will cover   (.) but if they find anything major they're   (.) it's on top of their forty nine pounds! (.) And I said to Dave, you need somebody   (.) you know like a 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	handyman or so something like Neil, I mean 
*JEA:	Yes   (.) exactly.
*BRE:	to fix things like that
*JEA:	That's right.
*BRE:	so that if they charge twenty quid   (.) when they start
*JEA:	Quite.
*BRE:	you know, half the price
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	you know that's
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	you could make the money up.
*JEA:	Of course you can   (.) well I knew of a girl who married   (.) I wouldn't say she'd married well   (.) when she started out but her husband   (.) was enterprising   (.) e eventually got himself quite a good job at the   (.) at people who print the bank notes so so that they   (.) they started off in a   (.) prefab   (.) and they ended up with a new four bedroom   (.) bungalow with central heating   (.) at   (.) Athorpe  (.) Roding .And er I lost touch with her after that but Joyce was very nice, very, very   (.) a down to earth cockney girl from Hockston   (.) and she said er   (.) she'd tell her sister   (.) she said I do admire my sister she said they'll never have anything other than a council house, I don't suppose   (.) but she said   (.) my brother-in-law   (.) mends people's motorcycles   (.) as a side line   (.) and the money that he gets from that   (.) he gives her most of it   (.) and she buys things on hire purchase, this was the days when hire purchase wasn't   (.) fearsomely expensive
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and she said my sister spends   (.) I mean, we're now talking about   (.) nineteen seventy   (.) my sister spends twelve and six a week   (.) on   (.) things from   (.) for the house   (.) on the hire purchase   (.) if she ever   (.) truly runs into debt she'll save   (.) part of the cost of the thing, you know   (.) and then she knows that she's always going to have to put twelve and six a week aside   (.) but she does that and buys things for the house   (.) and you see if you've got   (.) if you've got that little bit of extra coming in it's quite   (.) well it's like my lodgers, Brenda   (.) if I couldn't if I couldn't get   (.) what I need from my lodgers   (.) well Neil pays me   (.) Neil's house rent which thirty pound a week
*BRE:	And that's not very  (        ) 
*JEA:	No   (.) I stop 
*BRE:	No 
*JEA:	when he gets another job   (.) when he gets a proper job, when he's employed it'll stop.
*BRE:	Oh I see.
*JEA:	But at the moment I get thirty pounds a week
*BRE:	I see so if he gets 
*JEA:	and if he gets 
*BRE:	some money coming in
*JEA:	that's right, and he gets some unemployment money and I take   (.) ten pounds a week off him, for his food, I mean, it's not enough but it'll do, you know   (.) and then in dribs and drabs begrudgingly from that forty   (.) over the week   (.) once he starts to run out of money   (.) cos he's paid once a fortnight   (.) I begin to give him   (.) his karate money   (.) and   (.) here's two pounds fifty to go to the pub with Neil, you know, little bits 
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	little bits, little bits   (.) and I'll buy you your tobacco Neil   (.) nothing much but   (.) little bits of something   (.) now if he were   (.) working and could give me the full sixty that is thirty for his room and thirty for his   (.) food   (.) so that I didn't have to worry about th  (.) actually paying for him   (.) but he was paying me   (.) Paul is going to pay me fifty   (.) that's thirty pounds in, I made a rule to Paul that he is going to eat thirty pounds worth of food   (.) and there are only twenty pounds in my profit   (.) and then the other rule, a man called Alan  this window cleaner   (.) he wants the room   (.) that I'm in at the moment
*BRE:	Oh dear.
*JEA:	because he doesn't want the ensuite, he can't afford it, he can't pay forty pounds a week
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	or thirty five, he wants to pay as little as possible.
*BRE:	What will you charge, twenty five for that one?
*JEA:	Twenty five, yes an and for that   (.) he can make hims he doesn't want to to really to pay me for food at all so I'm going to tell him that he can have his cups, spare cups of tea and a drink of milk an  (.) and some toast.
*BRE:	Just bits and pieces 
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	he doesn't want main 
*JEA:	No 
*BRE:	meals, sort of thing.
*JEA:	Or main meals , no   (.) but he can have that on the twenty five he needn't give me anything extra for that.
*BRE:	When's he moving in then? (.) as soon as 
*JEA:	Well he was probably   (.) actually hammering on the door now to er come and see   (.) where he's going to put his ladders, he wanted er   (.) a bit of wall to put the brackets up to put his ladders   (.) but Paul said   (.) that   (.) he Paul thought you could suspend ropes from my garage roof, you remember   (.) what a lot of criss-cross bracing there is 
*BRE:	Have you seen what we've done in our garage?
*JEA:	No I haven't.
*BRE:	We took erm   (.) just wood beams across   (.) for canoes    (.)  (        ) 
*JEA:	Or if 
*BRE:	might as well up there 
*JEA:	 (        ) Richard put over, put a lot of beams   (.) and Paul   (.) at the weekend put an immense amount of his   (.) household gear   (.) up on the roof   (.) in the garage.
*BRE:	In the garage, yeah   (.) that's what we did we   (        ) 
*JEA:	Yes 
*BRE:	the ladder and 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	everything on the beam.
*JEA:	Yes   (.) well it's possible that er Alan may see a way to using that but   (.) he is quite ni , I mean he he's got no doubts he wants to come to me   (.) he's in a divorce at the moment and the moment that the final papers are signed, he's got to get out of the house   (.) he has to stay there till the last minute   (.) and then the moment that the papers are signed, he must go.
*BRE:	But what happens if Philip's still there?
*JEA:	Well   (.) Alan says he'll sleep on my sofa.
*BRE:	On the sofa, for now, yeah.
*JEA:	I mean h he under he says this is, you know   (.) a very nice house   (.) and he wouldn't normally expect   (.) to get a room for twenty five pounds in a house of that character.
*BRE:	That's right   (.) but twenty five quid is a hundred quid a month, innit?
*JEA:	Precisely! (.) Well it's it's say I say I was   (.) doing my best, as it were, say that everything was going swimmingly   (.) I'd be getting a profit of thirty pounds from Neil   (.) twenty pounds from Alan because five will go on the tea and the milk and the box of Cornflakes and the toast   (.) er twenty, thirty  (        ) , that's fifty   (.) and   (.) twenty for Paul which is   (.) seventy.
*BRE:	You get thirty from Paul, don't you?
*JEA:	No, he's going to give me fifty because, don't forget, he's in a small bed   (.) and he eats thirty pounds worth of food.
*BRE:	Twenty pound from   (        ) that's seventy quid.
*JEA:	 (        )  (.) exactly! (.) The price is considerably better.
*BRE:	Two eighty a month.
*JEA:	Exactly   (.) much, much, better than any pokes in the eye with a sharp stick!
*BRE:	So what does it   (.) did Philip pay up on time?
*JEA:	Always excellent on that   (.) yes, he's a toad in some ways but in other ways he's very good.
*BRE:	What about   (.) Paul?
*JEA:	Well he hasn't got any money, but when he's had it he's paid   (.) on the dot   (.) the only one
*BRE:	But hasn't he got that job still then? (.) At  (        ) ?
*JEA:	He's only just started.
*BRE:	Oh he's just started.
*JEA:	And he has to week before he gets any money   (.) he has to work a week in arrears, you know, they   (.) they   (        ) 
*BRE:	So has he been there this week, Paul?
*JEA:	Yes, he's been there this week   (        ) 
*BRE:	Next week he'll get paid.
*JEA:	money   (.) yes.
*BRE:	So from next week you start getting paid.
*JEA:	Yes   (.) and if that bloody Karen comes on the scene   (.) and wants to take him back I shall tell her, if you go back Paul
*BRE:	That's it!
*JEA:	that's it, I'm having no more of it! (.) I've had two lots of terrible upheavals.
*BRE:	Mm   (.) he can't, you know, he's 
*JEA:	He mustn't! (.)  (        ) .
*BRE:	That's right you're gonna, sort of,
*JEA:	Build a trench ha ha oh ha oh oh ha ha.
*BRE:	Yeah he   (.) you can't keep on and on helping them out, I mean, they've gotta 
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	 (        ) themselves I mean 
*JEA:	Quite!
*BRE:	Shan't be sorry to see Philip go, will you?
*JEA:	Oh, I can hardly wait! (.) I mean I   (.) I went in there   (.) yesterday, I think it was, or this morning   (        ) erm   (.) he put wet shirts into the wardrobe admittedly with the doors open   (.) but that bedroom is not a bedroom that I like to get any dampness in at all, Brenda.
*BRE:	Why does he just hang it   (.) you know   (.) put in the tumble dryer or hang it in the garage?
*JEA:	Too lazy! (.) Easier to do it that way!
*BRE:	Has Tony taken all his stuff out?
*JEA:	Yes, he has at last.
*BRE:	Is he in his house yet or is he still in that 
*JEA:	Yes and he's very, very difficult to   (.) feed himself, to get the food in   (.) because, you know, he liked to come in a half past ten and bully me to cook things for him   (.) that's why sometimes I used to run up to bed and pretend I was   (.) asleep  [] .
*BRE:	 [laughing] Asleep  [] . (.) So what er   (.) so how does he cope now then?
*JEA:	Cos I thought that was a with a utmost difficulty   (.) and he has to get his little daughter on Sunday to help him to clean the place.
*BRE:	She'll soon get fed up with that.
*JEA:	Well   (.) tough he's not getting my, he's not getting the ensuite room, I can tell you   (.) If I if I have got three lodgers and I'm getting on with them and they're   (.) they're paying me regularly   (.) for the sake of an extra   (.) twenty pounds or whatever   (.) and the annoyance from Tony   (.) coming in   (.) at ten   (.) a or there abouts   (.) and then sitting there like a stuffed frock   (.) waiting for me to leap about and put food on a plate and microwave it   (.) not doing it, Brenda!
*BRE:	No   (.) you shouldn't, I mean you
*JEA:	I mean I w when I was dropping dead with exhaustion one evening I said to him   (.) look Tony,the there's I've cooked a chicken, there's a big chicken cooling on the table   (.) and there there were   (.) red sauce, potatoes, gravy, I said, stick the lot on a plate a micro and, you know, film it over, microwave it   (.) oh well I shan't bother to eat anything   (.) now of course he was paying me for his food
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and he was jolly well seeing whether 
*BRE:	But if you'd said   (.) oh well I'll prepare, what about if I prepare you , oh yes well I'll have that   (.) probably if you'd got   (.) done it   (.) he'd have it because he had to help himself.
*JEA:	Oh well I th I then said oh well   (.) I'll alright I'll fling it together for you   (.) oh good   (.) can you bring it into the sitting room? (.) I very nearly brought it o 
*BRE:	See don't.
*JEA:	in the sitting room and banged it over his head!
