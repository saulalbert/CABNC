*GIN:	Went in  (  ) . It's worth it cos you feel so much better when you've been. 
*KEI:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	 (  ) it's a real dingy day and I think oh dear, wear their boots and Kagouls, and you feel so much better when you get   (  ) taken the snow of them, the leaves are nice cos they dry them, scuffle in them. 
*VIC:	 (  ) 
*GIN:	Yeah. Just walking in the woods. (  ) . 
*VIC:	 (  ) .

*VIC:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Oh   (.) does Paddy help you move the plants? 
*VIC:	Oh yes, yeah, I couldn't of done  (  ) . 
*GIN:	 ((whistling)) , Parker   (.) Park, (  ) come on, come on. I was talking to Alison saying that sometimes I think we spend too much money keeping all these erm criminally in sane 
*VIC:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	I said to her, it's all very well, but, we spend so much money on them and we don't seem to spend any money on victims. 
*KEI:	No, (  ) . 
*GIN:	And she said, sometimes I can agree with you she said, but some of them when they come into a library, you feel   (  ) helped 
*KEI:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	and others   (  ) really victim  (  ) , I said but isn't it, isn't it kinder in a way, I wouldn't, if they really are sick in their minds then but for the grace of god   (  ) wouldn't it be kinder to stick a needle in their bottoms when they were asleep so they didn't wake up again 
*KEI:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	and she said well we've got, for instance, one of my favourite patience is the girl of er, I think she's nineteen, and er, she's in their because her father had raped her since she was about eight, when she was sixteen she killed him, well I said well I think she should have been given a medal. 
*KEI:	Yeah, (  ) . 
*GIN:	Hello, hello, hello 
*KEI:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	I've forgotten your name, Judy   (  ) oh sitting down in the   (  ) meadow I think, oh aren't you having fun, come on Rocket, oh Rock, Rock, Rock, you, Rocket, (  ) I hide, he get's every so anxious if I hide. 
*KEI:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	 (  ) , didn't bring your lead did I, It was on the back seat  ((train passing)), well this girl apparently, erm, would of got away of killing her father 
*KEI:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	because he had abused her all those years, erm, but apparently she's also got a  (  ) , not the right sort of word, a pathological hate for men in general  
*KEI:	Oh, oh, yeah. 
*GIN:	and was inclined, any man who accidently put a hand on her 
*KEI:	Mm. 
*GIN:	likely to of had a have a knife in her pocket and turned round and stabbed him. 
*KEI:	Yeah, well you can't blame her can you? 
*GIN:	No, I can't blame her 
*KEI:	 But I suppose you have to   
*GIN:	 But it seems to me she  shouldn't be locked up in Broadmoor, she should be somewhere where it's more   (  ) supervision, but more freedom where she can walk around gardens and places like that, erm 
*KEI:	 (  ) , well she should after a while  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Yes, if they put you in a 
*KEI:	grow older. 
*GIN:	close order with nuns or  (  ) . 
*KEI:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	 (  ) understand   (.) especially is one of them was a 
*KEI:	 (  ) beat her up while he was, while she's asleep, didn't actually do it, while he was actually abusing her, so  (  ) . 
*GIN:	 (  ) , I mean a woman that frightened we all be seething inside and of course seeing him asleep in a drunken stupor to think now's my chance, she must of been in a terrible state emotionally 
*KEI:	Yes  (  ) . 
*GIN:	and thought now's my chance if I  (  ) . 
*KEI:	She couldn't of done anything to him while he was abusing her 
*GIN:	No 
*KEI:	because he did it. 
*GIN:	Exactly 
*KEI:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	 (  ) . Oh I can, I can understand what must be going through her mind, it must still of been a terrible time  (  ) . 
*KEI:	Yeah, yeah  (.)  
*GIN:	 (  ) .

*GIN:	Oh yes, I think they    (  )  . 
*KEI:	  (  )  . 
*GIN:	Sort of. 
*KEI:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	Which is what we had at home in the manor ground, our squire was er 
*KEI:	Yeah, (  ) . 
*GIN:	selection of them   (  ) went all over the world collecting trees. 
*KEI:	Funny, they did in those days didn't they? 
*GIN:	Oh yes   (.) from seventeen something to eighteen   (.) early nineteenth century  (  ) . 
*KEI:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Apparently   (  ) they use to keep a little thing alive and they took it on the boat coming home 
*KEI:	Yes. 
*GIN:	 (  ) 
*KEI:	 (  )  (10.0) 
*GIN:	Oh it's nice to have you there for a walk 
*KEI:	Oh I   (  ) it was lovely. 
*GIN:	Did you good as well. Wasn't it too long for you, to catch cold, if you walk  . 
*KEI:	 No, no, not really  , (  ) cold, but I do hate it when the winds blowing at me. 
*GIN:	Yes, yeah, we having some icy  winds about a month ago, when we had the frost in the morning. 
*KEI:	 When, when the cold wind blows  , yeah, that's right    (  )  . 
*GIN:	 It was cold  , 
*KEI:	Wouldn't set foot outside. 
*GIN:	Cold over the meadow then. 
*KEI:	Do you know how, if you've got a lot of toadstools and fungus in your   (  ) in your garden, you have to dig down don't you, it said about six inches    (  ) down  . 
*GIN:	  (  )  , (  ) . 
*KEI:	That little pouch in the front where I have flowers in, in the summer, absolutely covered in toadstools, it's all the way round there it's all covered in toadstools. What, what I do? 
*GIN:	They're probably edible. 
*KEI:	Oh dear, the thing is, as, as far as I can remember I can't find it in any of the two books that I've got out at the moment, it's not under  (  ) , but I vaguely remember that you have to dig down a certain  (  ) . 
*GIN:	It's not very deep thought is it? 
*KEI:	No, it's like, (  )   
*GIN:	 Watching the television   
*KEI:	or something like that. 
*GIN:	yeah and you should turn the top few inches over and there was what he called the 
*KEI:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	 (  ) thing is if you don't get them out, then they'll grow up again. 
*KEI:	Unfortunately I haven't  got any spare earth to put it  . 
*GIN:	 I've got an idea  I read that salt   (  ) of course kitchen salt   (  ) does it, which I imagine would kill most any thing. 
*KEI:	Well yes. 
*GIN:	 (  ) . 
*KEI:	Yes, and it might kill the flowers off, but  (  ) . 
*GIN:	It was just that erm, if you do it gently, layer by layer 
*KEI:	Yes 
*GIN:	you'll probably come across those little 
*KEI:	yes 
*GIN:	interlaced mats 
*KEI:	yeah 
*GIN:	which I think are the spores aren't they? 
*KEI:	Yes, I think I've got to go out and dig, I, I really have, but  but when you're watch your back and   (  )  . 
*GIN:	  (  )  
*KEI:	With it, with it not, with it being opened planned. 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*KEI:	I do like, I don't really like them. 
*GIN:	No, I can't say I  (  ) . 
*KEI:	That's the only thing about that house that I don't really like, that's, the 
*GIN:	You haven't got as much at the front as I have. 
*KEI:	No. 
*GIN:	I meant to put a lot more bulbs in over the   (  ) I've still got time actually. 
*KEI:	Well we dug the lot up   (  ) they're all growing like mad and I, I've got an idea that once you've moved them they don't, they don't re-settle very well. 
*GIN:	Oh I thought you can move bulbs any time when they were dormant. 
*KEI:	Well they're not, all there, all their roots are growing 
*GIN:	Yeah. 
*KEI:	and all their, all their 
*GIN:	Yeah, I suppose.
