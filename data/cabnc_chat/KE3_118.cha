*JAC:	I'm afraid that's why I get paranoid Christine and say •177560_177860•
*CHR:	Yeah. •177860_177866•
*JAC:	be careful of the roads because  a car  can't  erm  can't always stop in time  it's up to you not to walk out in front of them  cos they can say oh well you should be able to stop in time  but in practice if you drove to be able to stop in time if somebody stepped out in front of you you'd never above  about five miles an hour  you know?you must sort of stick to the speed limits  I don't believe it we got  gaining on the car in front. •177933_185481•
