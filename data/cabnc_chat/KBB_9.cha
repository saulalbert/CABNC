        Well it's funny it's working this time int it? •211290_213078•
*ART:	Well there's so many things to go wrong int there? •213078_218072•
        You've gotta watch it all. •218073_218447•

*EVE:	I've thrown some out. •220700_221094•
*ART:	Mm. •221143_221345•
*EVE:	They've got some. •221346_221897•
        Ah after all that trauma . •222111_223065•
*ART:	It's going to be a bad frost tonight. •223066_225398•
*EVE:	I know, shall I  put the gas fire on, as well? •225676_228332•
*ART:	No, I'm warm enough. •228714_228964•
*EVE:	I'm not very warm. •228965_229824•
*ART:	It's getting dark isn't it? •229825_230766•
*EVE:	I mean you did the same with that as you did with the other didn't you? •230766_233605•
*ART:	The only thing that was different is that, that  it's not starting on the same •233815_237265•
*EVE:	Well you get obsessed with that but you're comparing it with yours. •237275_239360•
*ART:	I was just sitting figuring it out. •239365_240294•
*EVE:	You're comparing it with our  •240295_241056•
*ART:	You know the ones you put in? •241080_242199•
*EVE:	thing  with our system. •242246_243572•
*ART:	Well no she couldn't put the B side in cos she you've got to put the A in. •243588_247103•
*EVE:	Yes. •247509_247571•
        You put the A in. •247571_248479•
*ART:	The only way you can get it  •248556_249493•
*EVE:	A  •249498_249585•
*ART:	right would be putting the B side in but you've gotta start with A. •249585_251020•
        It's rather curious that. •251021_251581•
*EVE:	Well you, you always do on yours when you're recording on our er set don't you? •251581_253243•
        But you're obsessed with the position of the, the tape. •253273_256623•
*ART:	Well  I compare like with like don't I? •256675_258148•
        What's this one in here, the  •258149_258695•
*EVE:	Leave alone and I'll sort them out. •259014_260093•
*ART:	Well  that's what I'm saying. •260156_262160•
*EVE:	Well   •262173_262202•
*ART:	Ah, there, that's it. •262202_262770•
*EVE:	That's it. •262771_262891•
        Now do you want any cake with that second cup of tea? •262951_263910•
*ART:	Yes I'll have a slice. •264209_265016•
*EVE:	There's not •265017_265199•
*ART:	Have you got much left? •265240_265655•
*EVE:	Yeah there's half of it left. •265744_266165•
*ART:	Oh. •266250_266304•
        Yes but if you're not here you won't will you? •266388_267385•
*EVE:	Well I shall be in a minute, I've only just got to go in the kitchen and get it. •267385_270151•
*ART:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	No! •270268_270348•
        It won't matter for a minute or two. •270348_271165•
*ART:	On my daughter's wedding day ten thousand pounds I'll give away. •271260_275070•
        On second thoughts I think it best to put it back in the old oak chest . •275339_276973•
*EVE:	How big ? •277130_277442•
*ART:	Normal. •277833_277934•
        Some folk sing opera, some folk sing jazz, some sing like sawing wood, I sing like that. •277934_281084•
        But when the dickie birds sing in the trees I think we ought to try and sing like these. •281119_283481•
*EVE:	Well what's all that in aid of? •283569_284533•
*ART:	Let's all sing like the birds can sing   •288439_289488•
*EVE:	You needn't sing on it. •289560_309896•
        Shut up! •309902_309983•
*ART:	tweet tweet tweet, tweet tweet  •310283_311826•
*EVE:	And eat that cake. •313163_315812•
