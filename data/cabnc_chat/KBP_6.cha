        Don't let me forget there's a cake in the oven will you? •211235_211576•
*CLA:	Not a bun but a cake. •211576_211724•
        Right. •211974_211983•
*NIN:	You know what I'm like. •212086_212298•

*NIN:	I know what it is now but  •213249_213432•
*CLA:	Mm. •213432_213442•
*NIN:	I'm quite capable of forgetting in about five minutes. •213460_213668•
*CLA:	Mm. •213668_213690•
        Well it wouldn't take me that long  . •213760_213933•
*NIN:	Oh dear. •213933_214009•
*CLA:	Quite a bit more  today anyway. •214009_214342•
*NIN:	Oh well yes. •214342_214394•
*CLA:	Mm. •214394_214404•
*NIN:	It's a hard slog  isn't it ? •214411_214820•
        I wish we'd got a bit further really but it's hard work. •214832_215102•
*CLA:	There's a lot of work. •215139_215189•
        But we, we're getting there slowly. •215189_215283•
        Mm. •215307_215336•

*NIN:	Yeah. •216805_216811•
*CLA:	And then the chippie erm  cuts the door to fit. •216822_217172•
        it, you know? •217172_217407•
        Very seldom you get it a perfect fit when you •217407_217765•
*NIN:	Mm. •217790_217799•
*CLA:	just  it in. •217922_217994•

*NIN:	Mm. •218651_218660•
        I don't think they, I would have thought that everything was more or less •218660_219193•
*CLA:	Well it is more or less. •219193_219263•
*NIN:	spot on  •219263_•

*NIN:	Oh. •223000_223032•
*CLA:	Not the faintest. •223032_223056•

*CLA:	yeah. •224373_224380•
*NIN:	getting a a job really, can you? •224380_224518•
        Certainly not now. •224544_224594•
*CLA:	I'd have thought he's going to find it extremely difficult down here to find a job. •224594_225022•
*NIN:	Because I don't   •225027_225101•
*CLA:	Of any sort. •225101_225173•
        Never mind just in the building trade. •225173_225295•
*NIN:	Yes, I don't think he'll rush down . •225295_225646•
        But he's so used to being . •225646_225784•
*CLA:	Well he's got all his mates . •225794_225921•
        And he er I don't think he's got the confidence to . •225921_226244•

        I don't. •226285_226317•
*CLA:	No. •226368_226378•
*NIN:	And then again he's getting older, I mean   •226379_226711•
*CLA:	Mm. •226711_226714•
*NIN:	it's more difficult as you get older . •226774_227123•
*CLA:	See I did see there's that place erm  erm  oh it's going, it's  Tearscross direction. •227123_227680•

*NIN:	The thing is er where he is now •228579_228725•
*CLA:	Mhm. •228725_228731•
*NIN:	er when, mind you he's been in his job for a while now. •228731_228955•
*CLA:	Mm. •229012_229025•
        Mm. •229242_229270•
*NIN:	But I mean  when the jobs have finished  he's always  •229283_229599•
*CLA:	Well he  •229600_229723•
*NIN:	managed to get on to another one pretty well straight away. •229747_229934•
*CLA:	See hang on no no no. •229985_230078•
        The job's been never finished  never will be finished  with the corporation on it. •230078_230563•
        It's amazing . •230563_230605•
        Specially there . •230606_230629•
*NIN:	No but I mean, I don't mean I don't mean where he's been working for the corporation, I mean  before when he's had these various jobs and they've finished and he's had, you know, the job's finished and they've had to go somewhere. •230666_231640•
*CLA:	Oh the shopfitting and mm mm mm. •231654_231764•
        Mhm. •231764_231770•

*CLA:	Oh to be fair to him, yes he has. •232058_232199•
        He's been very quick at that. •232199_232287•
*NIN:	But as you get older that's not so easy is it? •232287_232506•
*CLA:	No, precisely. •232506_232562•
        No. •232562_232570•
        No. •232594_232620•
*NIN:	And he might not find it so easy here. •232620_232717•
        Cos there's so many more people in pretty much the same trade. •232740_233306•
*CLA:	I would have thought so. •233306_233580•
        Yes. •233580_233607•
        I would have thought so. •233607_233763•
*NIN:	Mm. •233785_233798•
        And it just isn't commonsense to commute  •234058_234173•
*CLA:	No. •234173_234180•
*NIN:	to Manchester is it? •234186_234286•
*CLA:	Oh he'd never do it. •234286_234328•
        It's ridiculous. •234328_234375•
*NIN:	Mind you, the only thing that I was thinking of, do you know when he was commuting  •234376_234782•
*CLA:	Ah. •234782_234793•
*NIN:	that firm he was working for •234793_234905•
*CLA:	Yeah, can't •234916_234951•
*NIN:	to was it Swansea? •234951_234986•
*CLA:	It probably was Swansea area. •234992_235158•
        I think it was, yeah. •235158_235219•
*NIN:	Yes it was Swansea area. •235219_235268•
*CLA:	Go on. •235324_235344•
*NIN:	He seemed to like that, although he did get fed up with it . •235344_235702•
*CLA:	Ah yes but it was quite a different run you see Nina. •235725_235947•
        That was motorway nearly all the way. •235947_236160•
*NIN:	Mm. •236160_236166•
*CLA:	And he could do it in  less time. •236335_236497•
*NIN:	Mm. •236501_236518•
*CLA:	It was a straight run. •236530_236698•
        There was no driving involved. •236698_236779•
        You just point the car in the right direction  press the  pedal and you're there . •236793_237072•
*NIN:	It was still a long way. •237072_237332•
*CLA:	It's a longish way but erm  for Ken it's not quite the same as erm  the A roads and B roads and  •237341_238278•
*NIN:	No. •238304_238310•
*CLA:	oh no. •238311_238324•
*NIN:	No. •238324_238332•
*CLA:	Cos he doesn't really like driving. •238332_238468•
*NIN:	No he doesn't. •238521_238573•
*CLA:	No. •238574_238575•
*NIN:	And it is a bit of a tedious journey. •238575_238657•
*CLA:	He'd never do Mike's job. •238731_238819•
        Well  he'd never do Mike's job anyway but  •238821_239006•
*NIN:	Oh no. •239006_239018•
*CLA:	you know, the driving side . •239018_239159•
*NIN:	No but Mike enjoys it doesn't he? •239159_239314•
*CLA:	Mm. •239338_239344•
*NIN:	He covers a a rattling  big area. •239344_239772•
*CLA:	He's got a big area to cover, Mike  if you think about it. •239772_240012•
*NIN:	He seems to enjoy the job doesn't he? •240012_240230•
*CLA:	Seems to yes. •240294_240363•
        Mark you he wouldn't crack on if he didn't. •240387_240557•
        No he wouldn't say very much about . •240558_240685•
*NIN:	Well  no I don't suppose so. •240685_240930•
*CLA:	No. •240948_240955•
        No. •240955_240962•
*NIN:	But reading between the lines, you can usually have a a rough working idea   •240962_241637•
*CLA:	Oh yes he obviously likes it better than when he was at er at that erm what do they call themselves? •241708_242180•
*NIN:	Oh I can't remember now. •242299_242513•
        Erm oh well you see  •242513_242602•

*CLA:	Oh no. •243047_243095•
        He'd sooner be out. •243172_243242•
*NIN:	And I think I think he does his job well anyway. •243242_243419•
*CLA:	I'm quite sure he does his job extremely well, yeah. •243419_243763•
*NIN:	Mm. •243962_243985•

*CLA:	Well you usually mm. •246059_246489•

*CLA:	Er no I particularly  in view of her experience •247053_247283•
*NIN:	Cos  yeah •247329_247344•
*CLA:	I don't think she would. •247344_247405•

*CLA:	Quite as much anyway. •247443_247529•
*NIN:	No I don't. •247579_247602•
*CLA:	She might have to wait a wee while but I think she'll get on, yes. •247602_247818•

*NIN:	How did he er how did he first find out that he he had this    •253908_254149•
