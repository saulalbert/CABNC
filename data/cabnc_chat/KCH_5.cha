*JAN:	David wants to go to bed.
*PHI:	I know he does.
*CHR:	 ((humming)) 
*PHI:	Do you want to go to bed David?
*DAV:	 ((mimicking snoring)) 
*JAN:	I think you're as well on, on the sofa with er
*PHI:	Why what's up?
*JAN:	the rug.
*DAV:	Go to bed.
*PHI:	Go on then.
*DAV:	Mhm.
*PHI:	Not, not like him to ever want to go to bed truly. ((sigh)) 
*CHR:	 ((humming)) 
*JAN:	He had a late night 
*PHI:	Do you want your tea over there or do you want it
*JAN:	No I'll bring it, I wanna go over there.We're going to be late to dinner tonight aren't we I think?
*PHI:	Ah.
*JAN:	The time's  (        ) .
*PHI:	Nothing's boiling.
*JAN:	Well that's true.
*CHR:	 ((humming)) 
*JAN:	If we   (.) were you thinking of going to Health Chardonne?
*PHI:	Well   (.) yes, because er A 
*JAN:	Only I thought 
*PHI:	if they deliver it it's   (.) cheaper than going to Scunny or 
*JAN:	Well yes, but we've still got the problem of erm
*PHI:	But if, if we go in my car to fetch it I can't take the kids.
*JAN:	I know.I know.Well, which means I can't come.I thought it'd be nice if we all went together.But you mean go during the week some time?
*PHI:	No, I wasn't thinking of any time.Erm   (.) you could take two cars if you want to.
*JAN:	No, I think that's a bit of a waste.I thought you might have time during the week to pop into Hull that was all.A lunchtime 
*PHI:	No.
*JAN:	or something.I could come with you.
*PHI:	Well I don't know.I really don't know.
*JAN:	You don't know what a normal week is now do you?
*PHI:	Anyway popping into Hull is a thing of the past isn't it?
*JAN:	I suppose it is. (.) Well how much are their delivery charges?
*PHI:	Well I don't know.Ten, fifteen quid I should think.
*JAN:	Ee ooh!Well it's worth asking anyway isn't it?
*PHI:	Mm. (.) If they'd left one of these out
*JAN:	Oh.
*PHI:	when we were down in B & Q 
*JAN:	Oh while we were there the other day.
*PHI:	wouldn't have had to spend those hours
*JAN:	Yes.
*PHI:	finding somebody.Twenty two to, Hardpool Star garden compost  (        ) .That's thirty four ninety nine.
*JAN:	You see.I mean, all these, these grass cuttings erm from what Chris is doing now could go in.It's a shame just to waste it isn't it?
*PHI:	B & Q growing bags.The only thing is, you can't find them.
*JAN:	Cos you're filling up the weeder bin and I want   (.) well   (.) anyway,we we've got to get sorted out compost for it. (.) There's some baby sweet corn left erm   (.) oh I might get 
*PHI:	They, they won't be very good.
*JAN:	I'll put them in a chicken casserole tomorrow.I can use all these peppers up as well. (.) With the sauce.Oh I need some more tomatoes. (.) I guess Chrissy's coming in for something to eat.
*PHI:	Well I called him but   (.) I didn't think there was a rush.
*JAN:	No there isn't. (.) Saturdays are going to take some, they always take some getting used to when the football season's first finishing.I don't know   (        ) 
*PHI:	The erm 
*JAN:	ah I've got loads of mushrooms left, put those in the casserole, that's what I've got left  (        ) .
*PHI:	The B & Q conservatory, that one you were in the other day
*JAN:	Oh yes.
*PHI:	which comes in one size, twelve foot four by ten foot two.
*JAN:	Oh!Want one bigger than that.
*PHI:	Three thousand six hundred and ninety nine.Not bad.
*JAN:	Oh!Erm   (.) talking about conservatories   (.) for which you need  (        ) , I've read about the quiz.Yes, it starts at, it says on the front it starts at seven, and then at the back   (.) it says the actual quiz starts at seven thirty.Seven thirty to eight fifteen, then there's an interval which you have pie and peas, which is always good at the town hall   (.) erm, and then it's nine to nine thirty part two of the quiz.So really it sounds the sort of thing that'll be nice for you and I to go really just to get away from the children.Or do you want to go on your own so you don't have to get a sitter?But I need to be knowing cos if we're going out I'll have to
*PHI:	That's right.Yeah.
*JAN:	let the other   (.) man, the conservatory man know, it's not fair to   (.) not be here to  (        ) .
*PHI:	Mm.He's gonna be a pain in the neck!
*JAN:	I know love.
*PHI:	I mean   (.) there's no intention of letting somebody like that have a go.I was gonna do it myself.
*JAN:	Well if there's no intention I may as well cancel him altogether.There's no point in wasting his time either.
*PHI:	Well we're not are we?
*JAN:	Well if we're not I'll ring him up and say   (.) I'll say   (.) er
*PHI:	Hey we're going out and be,we we're going to have them build us one, I mean   (.) er   (.) my intention is I might get   (.) Stuart  or somebody to put the bricks at the bottom.
*JAN:	Yes.Sort of a semi do-it-yourself.
*PHI:	But a it'll, I'll assemble it myself.
*JAN:	Yeah.Okay.Cos Johnny can come up and give us a hand can't he?
*PHI:	I could do the lot actually if it comes down to it.

*PHI:	.Well he will be.
*JAN:	 ((laugh))  (.) Well   (.) aha 
*PHI:	 (        ) and Simon and things.Yes, well, if you go, if just you and I go we're likely to end up with somebody who knows us.
*JAN:	We have to make up a team though don't we?I mean, we can't do it on our own?
*PHI:	But you, probably wouldn't want to be with John.
*JAN:	Well   (.) yes but it   (.) will   (.) Ruth be going?And how are we going to make a team?
*PHI:	I would doubt Ruth will be going.

*PHI:	Mm mm.I don't know.I don't really know what it is.

*DAV:	They fell off.
*PHI:	they didn't know a lot about steel, they were made out of iron.
*JAN:	Mm.You can have a   (        ) 
*PHI:	And when he built his first engine it was made out of erm   (.) iron and stuff and was extremely heavy.
*JAN:	I haven't done enough peppers.What am I thinking of there?
*CHR:	Is steel lighter than iron?
*PHI:	Well not necessarily Chris.Erm
*CHR:	Is it stronger but 
*PHI:	It's, it's stronger weight for weight, you see, or   (.) well it can be in certain circumstances.
*JAN:	Grab a chair there.
*PHI:	Steel tends to be a bit more elastic.
*CHR:	Oh.
*PHI:	Iron do iron, certainly the stuff they used then, cast iron, was very brittle and
*CHR:	Aha.
*PHI:	so it won't stand shocks.
*JAN:	Mm.
*PHI:	So if you put a big heavy engine going down a cast iron railway   (.) which won't 
*CHR:	That might hit the railway, (        ) 
*PHI:	which won't be made   (.) properly
*CHR:	Ah.
*PHI:	it'll go   (.) and crack it.
*CHR:	Mm.
*PHI:	But I mean, having said that, there's lots of cast iron bridges around still,lo the one at Stamford Bridge is er
*CHR:	Mm.
*PHI:	cast iron and I mean, it's no problem in that   (.) situation.
*DAV:	And get a shock.Ah ah!The steam engine   [laughing] coming through  [] .

*DAV:	Hey!
*PHI:	erm
*JAN:	That's right.
*PHI:	Anderson Street.
*JAN:	Ooh!
*PHI:	But you see that would have given, one, two, three, four crossings on that, within half a mile in Driffield, so they closed that one and put a footbridge over and erm   (.) thanks.
*JAN:	I'll take that.I'll take that one for you.
*CHR:	And three crossings in about five hundred metres.
*PHI:	Well, that's about right, yes. (.) So, you can imagine what it'll be like cos erm   (.) twenty years ago in the summer, well no, twenty five years ago
*DAV:	That one.

*PHI:	Yeah.Erm   (.) no they le 
*DAV:	Dad I said er 
*PHI:	well er, I'm, excuse me David I'm talking to Chris.Yeah, they're normally every half   (.) hour, but
*CHR:	In the sixties 
*PHI:	when it used to be summer Saturdays and Sundays they were excursions, they weren't   (.) service trains.Some weekends like Eas erm, not Easter, bank holidays, August bank holiday and stuff, you'd have as many as they could get in.
*CHR:	You know I don't
*JAN:	I'm sorry, I was just, I was gonna pass that to daddy.
*PHI:	And did you know that when, when they used to go to Bridlington you know, you know where the big signal box is at Bridlington, near B & Q?
*CHR:	Yeah, yes 
*PHI:	Where the bus, and you know where the buses park and everything, that used to be all sidings   (.) right under that bridge that's got the weight limit on
*CHR:	Yeah.
*PHI:	for storing the engines and the coaches   (.) for the excursions 
*DAV:	And trucks.
*PHI:	and they used to get so many
*DAV:	And trucks.
*PHI:	And trucks Dave.Well they didn't have trucks for excursions, they didn't take any sheep and cattle to the seaside for a day.
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	But
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	they erm
*JAN:	The donkeys were already there.
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	they used to, they used to travel them back to Driffield if they were full and keep the empty coaches   (.) in two sidings.It used to be down to Meadow Road.And they used to keep them there until it was time for people to go out and then they'd run them back up to Brid.So it was that crowded.
*DAV:	How did you know?
*JAN:	You know, you'd think things had changed a long time ago but erm   (.) I remember having Chrissy in that yard when he was a baby in his pushchair   (.) where   (.) and there was the coalman's horse and erm
*PHI:	Oh at Brid?
*JAN:	cart at Bridlington.You know, and guess what, I remember

*PHI:	 ((sigh)) Don't be silly!
*JAN:	Mm.Jolly nice bread.
*PHI:	Mm?
*CHR:	It's much easier cutting that.Are you not going do all that?Dad!You're not going to eat all that?
