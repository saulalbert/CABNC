*DON:	like, I might make a determined effort, but I know what a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	overpower, you know, creep up on you, I, I'd, it'd just get the better of me Eric that's why I got really the other one you see and that, I, I haven't come to any harm not having it, and erm I've just got to get rid of this because it's, I'd do a lot more Eric if it weren't for the television, I know I'll miss it when I get rid of it you see, it has been described as a plug-in drug

*UNK:	Yeah   (.)  ((whistling)) 
*DON:	It's been mild again hasn't it?
*UNK:	Yeah   (.) that's considering it's January   ((whistling)) it reminds me of this global warming that's taking place down on everywhere

*UNK:	Where you going now?
