*JEA:	Mm.
*DAV:	it shot down the hole.
*JEA:	Mm.
*DAV:	So it's a right pain!
*BRE:	Unless there's a special fluid or something   (.) they could put it in there to wash through 
*DAV:	You can't because it wouldn't come out through the taps would it? (.) For someone like Nigel who's got all the tools   (.) it   (.) it'd be a   (.) a   (.) it's not a job you can come in and just do it   (.) cos you have to take a bit off   (.) clean it 
*JEA:	 ((cough)) 
*DAV:	and then   (        ) a bit more cleaning.
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	I haven't got any of the tools.
*BRE:	Mm   (.) no but it even for a 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	plumber it's a big job.
*DAV:	Be a bloody long job! (.) Well no not really cos you could find   (.) once you've found it, once he's, where you found the clog 
*BRE:	So is that Lee, jacket that's got a hole in it?
*DAV:	Marked at the top and  (        ) , yeah.
*BRE:	Why?
*DAV:	Well cos it had sunk and fallen, that's why   (        ) going   (.) cos the jacket had s  (.) fallen   (        ) 
*BRE:	What the new jacket we got off Lee?
*DAV:	Yeah, it filled with water, it'd gone into the tank.
*BRE:	But why, why did it?
*DAV:	Well it must have had a split in or something.
*JEA:	Mm.
*DAV:	The si it's all round the sides   (.) you don't really need a top on a tank, it's just the sides you want.
*JEA:	Can you come on the neo have you come on the insurance? (.) Can you come on Les and can he come on his insurance?
*BRE:	I doubt it.
*DAV:	 (        )  (        ) I mean estimated
*JEA:	Ah.
*DAV:	because Nigel like   (.) privately
*BRE:	We didn't, we haven't cos Les   (.) has to go through the   (.) books and charge 
*JEA:	Ah yes of course.
*BRE:	so we do it, we have like   (.) Nigel as our own plumber
*JEA:	Ah yes, yes 
*BRE:	and he doesn't charge, he charges still
*JEA:	Mm yes.
*BRE:	but not as much.
*JEA:	Mm.
*DAV:	And me   (.) being a silly idiot, see if I'd realized   (.) I didn't think   (.) you don't think that there's three parts of the tank, you think it's a tank and you just turn your tap on and the water comes out   (.) or 
*JEA:	Do you know Dave   (.) I read erm   (.) we there's a magazine called Good Housekeeping   (.) and it's been going for   (.) it had been going for seventy years, last year it started in nineteen twenty one, women's magazine, very good one   (.) and they had a sort of seventieth birthday issue
*BRE:	Do you want a cup of tea now?
*JEA:	and   (.) one woman said that the year, nineteen twenty one   (.) she was a bride of eighteen years old and she took Good Housekeeping and she's got the whole lot   (.) although she's now a very old lady, and she said   (.) my first lot of housekeeping was done in a   (.) house in Wales where we had water from the well   (.) we had to   (.) build the fires up by hand   (.) we could get Welsh coal cheaply   (.) but they had to   (.) you know   (.) use paper and kindle   (.) and we swept with brooms and my life has never been easier   (.) she said I had three children in four years and my life has never been easier   (.) she said and all these modern things came in   (.) life has   [laughing] got more and more complicated and difficult  [] !
*DAV:	You're not kidding   (.) he certainly ain't kidding you   (.) now now it's happened to me I know if it ever happened   (.) I know never to do it again.
*JEA:	The the the buggeration of it   (.) is that   (.) the next time round that something goes wrong, it'll be again something that you've   [laughing] encountered before  [] !
*DAV:	Yes yes   (.) and me and   (        ) there's one 
*BRE:	Bugger!
*DAV:	thing house, I never touched   (        ) electrics   (.) anything gas, electrics   (.) it's funny me and   (        ) are absolute disaster!
*JEA:	Yeah   (.) yeah.
*DAV:	I mean whatever I touch 
*JEA:	Yeah.
*DAV:	with the plumbing it   (        ) so   (        ) 
*JEA:	Plumbing is very difficult   (.) erm
*DAV:	 (        )  (.) I hate it!
*JEA:	Years ago I had a class of very bright children   (.) and they did some really good projects, they weren't silly projects where they just scribble a bit an  (.) and draw some rubbish the they really worked   (.) and I saw to it that they produced really   (.) good work
*DAV:	Yeah.
*JEA:	and one boy chose to write about plumbing   (.) and do you know, he found that there was nothing written down about plumbing   (.) in the early nineteen seventies   (.) there were one or two plumbing text books, they were very expensive and you could only get them through The Institute of Plumbers   (.) plumbing is something that until about nineteen seventy five   (.) was passed from father to son or uncle to nephew   (.) it was a sort of secret craft   (.) you know, you can 
*BRE:	It can 
*JEA:	understand it.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*JEA:	Yes.
*DAV:	Yeah I still I watched Nigel, I mean, I can dig some of that
