*NON:	Did you hear them say about the horoscopes?Waiting for this programme     (.)  (        )  (.) and erm   (.) when the husband, her partner went home   (.) they'd been to see this  (        ) , I don't know quite what happened 
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	She said, I can't believe what it says in the paper any more  (        ) 
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	last week in a T V programme.But they we , quite convinced they were gonna win and I think this is what was behind it.
*NON:	Yes, oh I didn't hear that much.
*NON:	So he bought the cutting with him and said they couldn't it.
*NON:	What, so they obviously believe in their horoscopes?
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	Yeah, cos you can read into it what you want these things re , can't you 
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	really?
*NON:	Well I think she felt, as they went   (.) I was   (.) sitting reading all about horoscopes but they did win.
*NON:	Mm.But they just got greedy.
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	Mm.Turn that off for a minute.No!Turn it off a minute I got a joke.
