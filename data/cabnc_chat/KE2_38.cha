*MAR:	Is Tuffnel, oh Tuf , Tuffnel is a slow bowler isn't he?

*MAR:	over
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	there, you see he's accumulated erm confidence
*TER:	Mm
*MAR:	didn't he? (.) 
*TER:	Mind you it seemed that they had a test at school last week and he wasn't terribly happy with it, he said he couldn't understand it, he tried to explain to me what it was, but erm, it's not, not easy, but Ga Gavin said erm, he said they'd had a test and he said it took him time to get into it but once he got into it, you know, he did alright in it, I think he said how many he got, he didn't seem to do too badly, but he said Alex didn't really do anything and what he did do he thought was wrong so he didn't hand it in, he said and in actual fact what he had done was right, so I don't know, I told, I told Alex to go and see, you know, and ask about it and sort of erm, apparently he did do that so at least he'll know, but erm, it's strange really because normally Alex
*MAR:	So much better
*TER:	copes very well, you know
*MAR:	And yet that other time, you know, when he came to you
*TER:	That's right, yes and, and Gavin of course, yeah 
*MAR:	because he couldn't do it and that Gavin had done it yeah it's amazing innit, yeah 
*TER:	that's right, yeah, mm , yes Gavin really has, yes he's one that's come on tremendously
