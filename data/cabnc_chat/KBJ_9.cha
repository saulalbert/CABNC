*ANN:	Well I've given some, I've not gone all the way round. I spent about an hour and a half this morning, I thought well it's time to stop. 
*CAR:	 It's very time consuming  though innit? 
*ANN:	Yeah. Cos I'm doing some mobile, well I'm hoping to get some mobile around Ruddington before it opens   (.) and so people can see me a bit before. 
*CAR:	 Yes.  Yeah. Before. 
*ANN:	So   (.) Lisa, it's it's going round at the moment with a mobile one, but after that it'll be from the shop  (  ) . 
*CAR:	Mm! 
*ANN:	 So   
*CAR:	 Oh  good! Well I hope it all works out alright. 
*ANN:	Oh I hope so. 
*CAR:	Ha!  Such   
*ANN:	 Oh!
