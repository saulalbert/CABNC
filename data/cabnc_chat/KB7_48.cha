*STU:	Go for a microwave or do you just go for •_•
*ANN:	We've got nine hundred pounds approximately, after the cooker and the fridge. •_•
        Five hundred pound for carpets, leaves four hundred pound, two hundred pound for suite and the microwave  •_•
*STU:	say, there's so many combinations that's the thing isn't it? •_•
*ANN:	Yep. •_•
*STU:	There are so many combinations of what to have, what to get, what we can't get, what we need really I think is, what we need is obviously going to be priority isn't it? •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*STU:	Carpets, cooker fridge •_•

*STU:	Decent  •_•
*ANN:	A reasonable one, I mean you can go up to two thousand for a good one, but a reasonable one you wouldn't get nowadays under seven hundred and ninety nine   •_•
*STU:	I think you'd be better off with a  with a new cooker and fridge •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah, definitely I think  •_•
*STU:	, you can go second hand  •_•
