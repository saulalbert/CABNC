*TON:	Can you change your game, so you can play it with with two? •160646_161039•
*CHR:	No, what you do •161160_161254•
*TON:	Mm, mm. •161254_161283•
*CHR:	is erm, well you do it, you've got one Joker in pack right, and you mix them up and you deal them out and you look at your cards, if you've got a Joker •161294_162158•
*TON:	Mm. •162202_162208•
        Yeah. •162208_162231•
        Yeah •162251_162268•
*CHR:	then, then you, everyone's got to mix up there cards again •162307_162676•
*TON:	Mm. •162676_162686•
*CHR:	You've got to put them in the order so you can see him, but the other person can't •162687_163041•
*TON:	Mm. •163075_163111•
*CHR:	and you've got to pick someone to choose out your card, and they don't know if you've got the Joker or not •163111_163743•
*TON:	Mm, mm. •163743_163787•
*CHR:	and they've got to pick one of the cards and they might get the Joker. •163876_164155•
*TON:	Right, I see. •164165_164256•
*CHR:	But, the trouble is you can tell who's got the Joker when there's two, because if you haven't, you know the other person has. •164333_165240•
*TON:	Yeah. •165257_165269•
*CHR:	But if you've got more than one person then it's harder. •165269_165610•
*TON:	Mm, we could play pairs if you like. •165610_165846•
*CHR:	Snap? •165902_165927•
*TON:	Yeah, can play snap. •166210_166427•
*CHR:	I put the same cards oh  and we can play . •166467_167496•
*TON:	Well, I won't, I'll play one game with you and then I'll go and get your tea  alright? •167496_168489•
        So. •_•
