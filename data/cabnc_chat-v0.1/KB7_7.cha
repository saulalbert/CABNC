*ANN:	And if we make an appointment to view some places and then we'll know what time we've got to doing the shopping and fit it in round taking mum. •212680_213404•
        Seeing mum. •213813_213876•
*STU:	something erm next week. •213916_214020•
*ANN:	So you don't fancy this afternoon? •214020_214433•
*STU:	In the morning. •214433_214498•
        Oh yeah well  yeah I mean if if they if  •214531_214698•
*ANN:	Cos as I say if we did see Sefton Avenue or New Drove today. •214698_215014•
*STU:	If there's nothing available. •215020_215120•
        That's what I meant. •215120_215196•
*ANN:	Oh yeah, there's plenty of time. •215223_215805•
        I don't really want to go on a Saturday. •215822_216038•
        Saturday afternoons with mum. •216282_216358•
*STU:	Saturday afternoons with Helen. •216384_216881•
*ANN:	well I wouldn't be absolutely  if, if I had to go out then I'd have to go out. •217021_217364•
        Then there's always Saturday morning  see Helen but then Stuart likes to sleep in. •217375_218064•
        But no I think Saturday's out really. •218213_218553•
        It's not a day for viewing houses. •218579_218746•
        We could go out Sunday? •218746_218969•
        And mum could come as well. •218969_219321•
*STU:	I don't know whether they work   •219348_219698•
*ANN:	Oh yes. •219987_220048•
        People at work all the week don't they? •220048_220191•
*STU:	Yes. •220191_220200•
*ANN:	Gets dark in the evenings then then then  definitely. •220222_220448•
        That's the only time you can view a property. •220590_221042•
        I mean unless somebody's living in it you can't go in the evenings in the winter can you? •221220_221552•
        And I don't  fancy a house that somebody's actually living in. •221552_221899•
        Cos then you've got ta wait while they •222057_222178•
*STU:	Yeah. •222178_222184•
*ANN:	And it can all fall through because theirs is falling through or they can't get out when you want and  that can go on for  Can it not? •222184_223655•
*STU:	Yeah. •223662_223671•
*ANN:	Sometimes it just can't be helped cos there's nothing  in your price range you know that you like that  isn't empty but  I would prefer  an empty property so that when we decide and then whatever just  •223835_225946•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Certainly if we'd see something that would do this afternoon, or  New Drove  today, that's fine. •226435_226922•
*STU:	No problem. •226922_227082•
*ANN:	Two of them at New Drove are downstairs and one is an upstairs. •227464_227798•
        The one upstairs, because it hasn't got a bay window •227988_228229•
*STU:	Yes. •228242_228253•
*ANN:	is larger. •228261_228440•
        The upstairs one is slightly larger. •228793_228945•
*STU:	The upstairs one's larger? •228945_229030•
*ANN:	number seven which is an upstairs one  hasn't got any bay windows. •231070_231310•
        It is  larger than the two five and six that are downstairs. •231310_231483•
*STU:	Who's selling that one? •231483_231552•
*ANN:	Well one's Cornerstone. •231552_231794•
        One's Cornerstone  •231797_231847•
*STU:	So one's Cornerstone and two are the other  •231847_232120•
*ANN:	Two are Hansard  •234572_234608•
*STU:	Yeah. •234608_234614•
*ANN:	I think it's Cornerstone one that's  the larger of the two, the three. •234628_235021•
        Six  seven. •235021_235790•
        Hansard. •235790_235809•
*STU:	Hansard. •235809_235827•
*ANN:	They're doing five and seven so they've got one above each other. •235827_236163•
*STU:	So they've got  one  one's doing two and one's doing one. •236220_236549•
*ANN:	One's doing five and seven which is  this is for two and one's doing six which is this one. •236549_237291•
*STU:	Yeah. •237294_237311•
*ANN:	Seven is definitely slightly bigger than six and five. •237311_237657•
        I checked it out. •237681_237762•
        The lounge is fourteen by ten. •237969_238174•
        The bedroom is thirteen nine by nine  instead of eleven by eight. •238182_238546•
        That kitchen's thirteen by five, that totals eleven by seven. •238553_238936•
*STU:	Neither here nor there is it? •238936_239011•
*ANN:	No. •239024_239030•
        None of it's much difference. •239030_239193•
        It's only a er it's a matter of two feet here and •239204_239383•
*STU:	Yes. •239565_239579•
*ANN:	But then I don't mind . •239689_239809•
        I don't mind living upstairs or on the ground. •239857_240051•
        Well I mean if they've got the key to both might  haven't decided on both of them you might as well go and see them. •240139_240618•
*STU:	Yeah. •240644_240670•
*ANN:	Both of them. •240714_240866•
        See which one you like the best or if you like them at all. •240866_241066•
        But as it's  got that financial package •241438_241731•
*STU:	That's Cornerstone? •241819_241894•
*ANN:	Yeah. •242014_242020•
*STU:	Don't know whether the same applies to the other two. •242020_242270•
*ANN:	it. •242273_242281•
        The financial package . •242281_242369•
*STU:	With Cornerstone? •242555_242617•
*ANN:	Cornerstone. •242757_242781•
*STU:	Doesn't actually say that in  Pantiles  •242781_242949•
*ANN:	No •242949_242955•
*STU:	Oh. •242993_242996•
        Just have to ask . •243118_243242•
*ANN:	Yeah. •243407_243420•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	But actually the one at Cornerstone is fifty pound cheaper than the both of them at Hansard. •243431_244088•
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	It is! •244088_244167•
*STU:	Fifty pound. •244167_244205•
*ANN:	One's nine nine fifty and one's nine nine •244334_244575•
*STU:	five, yeah. •244593_244631•
*ANN:	So it's forty five pound different. •244991_245235•
*STU:	Well that's a good way, if you think about it he's got, he's got four flats there  hasn't he? •245337_245856•
*ANN:	Oh yeah. •245905_245917•
*STU:	Four flats at thirty thousand. •246014_246145•
        That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses. •246157_246324•
        They could be sixty thousand apiece. •246385_246564•
*ANN:	Yeah. •246564_246570•
*STU:	Whereas if he had, if he sold them as separate houses he'd probably get forty thousand apiece. •246863_247162•
*ANN:	Yeah that's just  Yeah. •247162_247270•
*STU:	Forty five thousand even apiece. •247360_247532•
*ANN:	Yeah. •247583_247591•
*STU:	But he's making the money by selling them as flats. •247606_247786•
*ANN:	Yeah. •247846_247852•
        The only difference is he's had a few thousand extra because it's got two kitchens and two bathrooms. •247931_248474•
        partitions and  •248530_248570•
*STU:	Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings. •248570_248859•
*ANN:	But apart from that oh an extra bath instead of the other bedroom •248859_249226•
*STU:	Yeah. •249255_249277•
        Yeah. •249303_249321•
*ANN:	and erm another kitchen instead of a dining room or something and that's the only difference. •249321_249696•
        Say three four thousand probably. •249696_249873•
        For the extra bits and pieces that's all. •249873_250035•
*STU:	Yeah. •250035_250047•
*ANN:	I don't know how many of them there are. •250047_250196•
        Whether they only had four flats or whether there's a  flat on another block and another block of fours down the road. •250200_250847•
        I mean I don't know. •250847_250948•
*STU:	Only assume there's  you've got that one block. •250948_251404•
*ANN:	Well there might be  four blocks of four or  I du n no. •251404_251526•
*STU:	No I don't think so. •251620_251682•
        Not enough space for them. •251682_251742•
*ANN:	No I don't know. •251776_251836•
        I mean you know the area better than me. •251836_251926•
*STU:	Unless they've knocked them garages down or something  •251926_252076•
*ANN:	I've no idea . •252079_252103•
        I know them council houses aren't usually  but I mean I can't visualize how much land there is. •252106_252509•
        I only know that by going to school and   •252509_252871•
*STU:	Yeah. •252874_252880•
*ANN:	where they are. •252936_252980•
*STU:	Yeah. •252986_252992•
*ANN:	Probably should have gone the other way into town but •252992_253176•
*STU:	that •253236_253245•
*ANN:	Eh? •253245_253248•
*STU:	Neither here nor there. •253248_253286•
*ANN:	Well you could have gone sort of like round the Rainbow and  that way on. •253295_253575•
        That's what I meant. •253575_253618•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	the bypass  that end of town  would have been perhaps a little bit clearer. •253658_254028•
*STU:	If you look at the first it might help you to decide whether you like  •254039_254338•
*ANN:	That's it. •254338_254359•
        Whether you wanna go and see it. •254359_254432•
*STU:	Whether you wanna go and see them or not. •254432_254572•
        Whether you like the positions. •254572_254648•
*ANN:	I mean we know where Sefton Avenue is and we know that's •254648_255115•
*STU:	Well we know where it is. •255115_255164•
*ANN:	a nice house. •255173_255333•
*STU:	Well we don't know really. •261127_261291•
        We haven't seen it have we? •261306_261392•
*ANN:	Well I mean  I mean  •261392_261666•
*STU:	Yeah but we haven't actually looked  •261666_261830•
*ANN:	No but I mean I know which house it is with that  one, and you do don't you? •261869_262413•
*STU:	I think so yes. •262413_262524•
*ANN:	Well I think so as well. •262524_262658•
*STU:	But it would be nice just to go and have a quick  check. •262726_263151•
*ANN:	Oh I think, just to make sure that   •263151_263408•
*STU:	Just to make sure I like it. •263421_263532•
        Or  •263532_263536•

        We think it is. •263943_264010•
*STU:	You may not like it. •264053_264183•
*ANN:	I said as soon as I see it in the paper oh that looks nice. •264359_264573•

*ANN:	It's that one. •265767_265821•
*STU:	It's up here. •265821_266127•
