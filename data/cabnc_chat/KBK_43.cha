*NOR:	these days  Do it for money, everything right. •920065_923395•
*CHR:	Mm. •923395_923485•
*NOR:	going to teachers,staffed. •928995_941525•
        . The more you educate your teachers, the more they're going towards . •948835_954205•
        I'm not saying if there's an argument against educating them. •956925_962305•
*CHR:	Do you think there is an argument for finding natural teachers as opposed to set of people to get on with the job? •962655_978425•
*NOR:	How would you find them to start with? •981245_984825•
*CHR:	I don't know. •984825_985315•
*NOR:	You can't, you aren't saying that teaching is to, is a skill, that can't, isn't, teaching is now a skill in ? •989815_998155•
*CHR:	No I'm not, but I'm saying that some people probably have a natural, a natural teaching ability. •100371_101212•
*NOR:	But how do you know when you're eighteen, whatever, is a natural teaching ability or merely a wish to try it? •101237_102047•
*CHR:	Maybe eighteen is not the right age to be recruiting teachers. •102047_102296•
*NOR:	recruit . •102838_102864•
        Well how do you know you're going to be a doctor, or anything when you're eighteen then, you know, you can't, you're teaching . •103102_103896•
*CHR:	No, I accept it. •104008_104078•
        Accept that. •104114_104168•
*NOR:	I mean it is a longer training now, what it used to be. •104372_104689•
        standard is required. •104877_104985•
        I think you need a lot of knowledge, especially nowadays when they're insisting on all this national curriculum, you've got to have a very broad ability. •104985_105801•
        And then of course you need and you're going to avoid chance like this and  or whoever you . •106206_106655•
        You've got to be educated in child development and child psychology and the emotional development of children as well as their physical and educational intellectual •106850_107980•
*CHR:	Mm. •107980_107986•
*NOR:	You've got to have all that side of it, and if you're in teaching it's a bit ridiculous to be in any job if you don't know something about the history of it. •108143_108851•
        I mean no one 's suggesting doctors sit and learn all the theory of and the history of the development of medicine, but I'm sure that it's important to have some knowledge of your area. •108851_110372•
*CHR:	Mm. •110456_110462•
        Yes. •110462_110479•
*NOR:	So you wouldn't just push it all out, and how do you discuss new educational reforms if you haven't any idea about the original  previous  •110479_111594•
*CHR:	Yes. •111629_111663•
*NOR:	reformat I mean you've got to be you, knowledgable about your, the area in which you work, so I don't think you can just wipe out the history of education that's irrelevant. •111699_112812•
*CHR:	No. •112856_112864•
*NOR:	In fact there's a great argument teaching teachers a lot more about the legal areas these days as a  teaching. •113169_114032•
        Instead of just relying on your union,. •114067_114233•
*CHR:	Yes. •114329_114367•
*NOR:	Knowing your responsibilities and your rights. •114578_114778•
        there's a four year , you think they'd  fit quite a lot into that, cos a lot of it is holiday. •115261_115898•
*CHR:	Mm. •115956_115962•

        responsibility as well as the next college lecturers, that'll help you. •117998_118853•
*CHR:	Yes indeed. •118879_118939•
*NOR:	Which isn't . •119101_119160•
        Would you like coffee and biscuits or would you like some fruit or a piece of bread and jam or what do you fancy? •119169_119878•
*CHR:	I'll have some fruit first please. •119890_120616•
        It's quite a lurid apple isn't it? •120687_121014•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Oh. •121029_121039•
*NOR:	 (        )

*CHR:	Mm. •123616_123625•
*NOR:	She might have just had it off the hook yesterday. •123650_124525•
*CHR:	Come on . •124525_124593•
*NOR:	Students with O A level passes for ninety three percent of training teachers   Eight out of ten graduates have a good second class honours degree. •125811_127257•
        It's not such a high percentage in maths as it is   Twelve and a half thousand early retirements in eighty nine. •127675_129154•
*CHR:	Mm. •129154_129164•
*NOR:	Four thousand retirements through ill health, doubles the number to eighty seven. •129321_129864•
*CHR:	Aha. •129913_129936•
*NOR:	A good honours graduate now has a starting salary of eleven thousand five hundred, why should good honours graduate teachers earn fifty percent  medical, medical practitioner, seventy five percent less than new accountants or eighty percent less than new civil engineers? •131206_133106•
*CHR:	Yes, it's not, they've turned it into a total university trained job erm, people haven't given  award. •133421_134421•
*NOR:	Well apparently used to be  trained . •134533_134851•
*CHR:	No,taken them, they're taken to be professionals though aren't they? •135009_135422•
*NOR:	That would be the theory. •135477_135570•
*CHR:	Professionally speaking. •135570_135766•
        I've never had taken that. •135781_136706•
*NOR:	Educational is not seen as a vital part of national right, that must be somebody   The wages earned by unskilled workers in Germany are twice as high as those earned by teachers here  •137710_140830•
*CHR:	likely don't it? •141596_141652•
*NOR:	across the board  trouble is when you get these differential  spend all the interpretation on them, not that you're rewarding the good teachers but that some teachers are not worth rewarding. •142941_144481•
        Now if you really are a weak teacher  •144531_145132•
*CHR:	out. •145135_145172•
*NOR:	Then your  then your feelings perhaps don't matter in the overall picture of the education, but bearing in, looking at the teachers in our school, we, we really don't have a weak teacher except perhaps Mr , who's obviously not been well these last three years, erm •145181_147439•
*CHR:	He is weak on discipline. •147512_147653•
*NOR:	He is very high in his guild his musical know, gets a lot of work from the children and the children really like his classes. •147668_148383•
*CHR:	So does that mean that he is a good teacher of music, he's just not a good disciplinarian? •148400_148818•
*NOR:	To be a teacher you've got to have control of your children and you can't   •148873_149237•
*CHR:	Yes. •149241_149250•
*NOR:	possible, however good you are at your subject. •149250_149414•
*CHR:	Right, right. •149414_149508•
*NOR:	You must have control of your class, sometimes if you don't, under, when I say he's a weak teacher I don't mean he's a bad teacher. •149540_150310•
        I wouldn't single him out, I would just say he's not a strong teacher for the reason that he's only got part of it under his belt properly yet. •150310_151250•
*CHR:	Mm. •151277_151285•
*NOR:	But, you know, you can't, you might say well this teacher doesn't have such good displays on her wall, but then she might be ever so good at another area, I mean  is not a display lady, she doesn't have artistic creative sort of flair like say Polly did •151421_153334•
