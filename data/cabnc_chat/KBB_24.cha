*ART:	nick knacks
*EVE:	no, in certain things either
*ART:	well as far as that stoat didn't offer them any thing because they, a chap about forty he reached it
*ART:	it was, it was all tough weather scale of six, on, you know, and I said what, how much is that up there?, and he said ten shillings, I said a little bit dear in't it?, cos ten shilling then was ten shilling
*EVE:	mm
*ART:	and he says su its a good buy even for that says, it, you know, its a hundred years old, oh well he says it was continental, but er
*EVE:	well it perhaps wasn't just what he was looking for
*ART:	no   (.) well he knew what he were looking for, something worth when you think
*EVE:	no its not 
*ART:	I bet they come across it as well 
*ART:	what about those painti , that painting before he had the market stall

*ART:	best of it is he hadn't taken it out of the
*EVE:	roll 
*ART:	roll , roll you know the box
*EVE:	well he put it in, probably didn't put it, must of taken it out to of looked at it surely  (.) 
*ART:	it'd look like that might of been looking in the markets and that 
*EVE:	oh I know 
*ART:	for that thing
