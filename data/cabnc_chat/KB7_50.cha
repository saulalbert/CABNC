*STU:	Mm. •549262_549302•

*ANN:	yes, it's already going to the top of the charts  to be number one for Christmas  all the other Christmas songs are  •563422_584362•
*STU:	They're all coming down and that one's er •584372_586722•
*ANN:	yep •586822_587332•
*STU:	going up  •596622_597582•

*STU:	They always  prices keep falling. •598282_601672•
*ANN:	Well, I understand its  reasoning , but, I think if you've been very hard pushed  list, with this money, don't you? •605862_623172•
*STU:	Mm, mm. •623172_623932•
*ANN:	Considering I'm not supposed to have that  cos I had it when Ann and  bought it  not sure if it's now  are you? •624502_642712•
*STU:	Not really, was, though I thought we were offering a reasonable price taking everything into consideration •642712_649582•
*ANN:	upstairs and •650352_651932•
*STU:	price market  •651932_653142•
*ANN:	market  •654772_654832•
*STU:	erm, how long we've been here sitting tenants er •656182_660012•
*ANN:	I'm not thinking it object the sitting tenants  •660022_662462•
*STU:	the  , I thought that was  •662592_664672•
*ANN:	as it stands at the moment. •666002_667842•
*STU:	fairly good deal. •667842_672582•
*ANN:	Mm. •672682_672882•
        See here, they're gonna get thirty six for it as it stands  put it on the market as   •673972_685252•
*STU:	Might do, yeah. •685252_686192•
*ANN:	Might even  two years . •686192_690342•
*STU:	When you look at, look at the old houses on the market, erm, yeah, I think he might just, he might wait a while, there aren't that many buyers, •690342_701282•
*ANN:	Oh that's it, that's why they're coming down, that's why  are quite pleased to see us dear, especially at this time of the year, not many people will buy Christmas time, think oh we'll wait and go and get Christmas over and the spring and  •701462_721112•
*STU:	I think looking at the market you can, you can get a, erm detached, semi-detached sort of one you know one bedroom I suppose, •721112_730452•
*ANN:	You can get two bedroom •731162_733082•
*STU:	two bedroom at a push for about thirty four, thirty five, thirty six, thirty seven, •733082_740642•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	oh I don't know, I don't know, I think it will be a while getting rid of it yes, but I think he might get his price eventually, but it will take a long while to get it , it's up to him if he wants a quick sale,you know, thirty five yeah I, thirty five thousand I think , as I say taking everything into consideration, I mean, failing three okay I know I did the  thirty three  so take thirty five, thirty three and a half, oh  he ain't got much to worry about  •743002_798512•
*ANN:	Well •800622_800742•
