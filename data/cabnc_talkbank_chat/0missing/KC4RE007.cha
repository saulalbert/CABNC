*PS1E9:	That school like Alexander goes to I mean it 's a good place to go to is n't it If you can afford to send your kids there I would say there was more going on going for them is n't there than . 
*PS1E4:	Oh yes yes . 
*PS1E9:	than the old comprehensive schools Some are better than others of course but er . 
*PS1E4:	I think that a big advantage if you wanting to get in very large areas like London and Birmingham I think that if the schools I do n't suppose that kind of thing but erm I mean the schools out in Surrey and all erm places like that When you get down there they 're much much better than . 
*PS1E9:	Oh yes I mean we have a local school Hayes School which is a very good comprehensive . 
*PS1E4:	Mm All the comprehensives . 
*PS1E9:	and everybody . 
*PS1E4:	But I do n't think parts of Croydon south of Croydon Birmingham they 're much better down there . 
*PS1E9:	I mean people move in to Hayes specially so that their kids can go there . 
*PS1E4:	Yes I think generally speaking you erm schools out in the country are better . 
*PS1E9:	Oh yes Mm . 
*PS1E4:	Cos then you . 
*PS1E9:	It 's O K if your headmasters that run the school change I mean schools tend to change with headmasters do n't they . 
*PS1E4:	Cos it 'd be I mean a big disadvantage to a lot of particular schools around this area is the number of erm Asian and . 
*PS1E9:	Yes . 
*PS1E4:	erm Indian I mean they they probably do n't speak English and they 're at at a disadvantage to start off with . 
*PS1E9:	Yes . 
*PS1E4:	Which again is holding the others back . 
*PS1E9:	Yes yes changing headmasters at his school and they had a terrible reputation one time .

*PS1E6:	No I got I need to get some stuff out of the red one . 
*PS1E9:	and it changed out of all recognition Now it 's one of the the best schools for miles around .
