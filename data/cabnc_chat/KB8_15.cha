*ANN:	Mm.Yes.
*BET:	to understand.
*ANN:	Yes.

*ANN:	It comes on initially
*BET:	Yes.And dies down.
*ANN:	and it immediately dies down and then it's okay, but there was this tremendous roar   (.) and a loud click and it went out.And it was only about   (.) we i it was wi within a couple of minutes, or, probably less   (.) Jim came in   (.) er   (.) I think he was, I don't know where he'd been cos his day off was Thursday I think.Yes he was.And   (.) I told him about it, and he said oh yes, the pilot light has gone out   (.) and he relit it.And it was fine.It sounded okay   (.) but we kept getting these fumes.So we kept opening the door   (.) it blew out once again and he put it on again   (.) and we were still getting these fumes till about   (.) oh   (.) about half past five it seemed to stop,u we had the windows open.
*BET:	Mm.
*ANN:	And then   (.) Raymond phoned at about quarter to seven.No.He didn't.Sorry!Sorry!It we he phoned at   (.) it was, it was five to six, Jim was going to take me to aerobics because of the weather

*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	off the kitchen and ru and runs the boiler, he said it's the best kind you can get, nothing should come in there.And as he's driven up at the back then he looked up and he said   (.) you ca you could see daylight through it so it was, wasn't blocked by anything.
*BET:	Wasn't blocked.
*ANN:	Erm   (.) but he said 
*BET:	D'ya think it was the rain, maybe?

*BET:	Mm mm.
*ANN:	Except last night   (.) I thought   (.) what on earth's this?It just smelt like Christmas cake cooking, and I wasn't cooking anything at all.I mean   (.) Jim went to work at one o'clock and the last of the kids   (.) went home, I've had my dinner

*ANN:	I never feel cold in your house.
*BET:	Well, it's alright if, you know, if you're in a room where the fire's on, although I have had the heating on   (.) erm   (.) a few days recently because of the cold.But I was hoping it was off for good er   (.) but it didn't work out that way cos of the weather.Erm   (.) I thought I'll try and save a bit of gas   (.) this month.This quarter.But erm   (.) and I, I got my er microwave and I'm trying to save some electric.I've been doing most of my   (.) cooking with the
*ANN:	Aha.
*BET:	rather than putting a big oven on.
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	And if   (.) some, er,jus it was very thin slices of beef, topside of   (.) well I thought I'll get some beef out, and I did it in the microwave and it cooked   (.) but it was   (.) it was quite tough.I think if I'd had er   (.) no teeth I wouldn't have been able to manage at all, or if I had
*ANN:	You might have slightly overcooked it.
*BET:	That's what he said.
*ANN:	It's, you tend, to start with you do tend to erm
*BET:	Yeah.
*ANN:	overcook things.
*BET:	Yeah.Well it   (.) there wasn't a recipe to cover just what I was doing with the 
*ANN:	I know i i it
*BET:	and it was just a case of   (.) erm   (.) pot luck, I would sort of brought it out and looked at it and, er no it wasn't cooked, it was cooked on the edges so I turned it over and   (.) turned it round and put it back in again.
*ANN:	Did you let it stand?
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	For a while after?
*BET:	Yes.Yes.Yeah.
*ANN:	Before it carries on.
*BET:	Er it was
*ANN:	It's like when you cook 
*BET:	it was cooked 
*ANN:	cakes they look as if they're not quite cooked
*BET:	Mhm.
*ANN:	but by the time they've stood for five minutes they are.
*BET:	Well 
*ANN:	Did you remember if you cook a cake and you put a piece of erm   (.) kitchen paper over the top
*BET:	Mhm.I don't.
*ANN:	Oh.I, I can't remember where I got, I remember telling   (.) Beryl that a long 
*BET:	Oh!
*ANN:	time ago
*BET:	Right.Well I
*ANN:	well before she knows
*BET:	well I've cooked a
*ANN:	Someone who told me roundabout that 
*BET:	a cake recipe 
*ANN:	time.The other thing is   (.) yes.
*BET:	but it was, to me, it was more like a erm   (.) er, er a sponge   (.) erm   (.) like a pudding sponge.
*ANN:	Yes.What 
*BET:	Er 
*ANN:	kind of a cake did you make?
*BET:	It was just a plain erm   (.) Victoria
*ANN:	Oh.
*BET:	sponge recipe.

*ANN:	And u and dark brown 
*BET:	A pudding.
*ANN:	sugar.I that's nice and

*BET:	Mm.
*ANN:	run a knife round
*BET:	Mhm.
*ANN:	tip it up onto your hand, just briefly 
*BET:	Mm.
*ANN:	just for a second, and then 
*BET:	Mhm.
*ANN:	back a again.
*BET:	Yes I did.
*ANN:	Let's the air go, and get underneath
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	and that helps the bottom to dry out quicker.
*BET:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Now   (.) someone else told me, and it worked, and if you just lay a piece of kitchen paper over the top, that absorbs some of the moisture 
*BET:	The moisture.
*ANN:	as well and ta and the top isn't so soggy.
*BET:	Mm.Well I didn't have 
*ANN:	But chocolate cakes are definitely the best.
*BET:	Well I did a chocolate pudding 
*ANN:	In the microwave.
*BET:	and it was lovely.Erm 
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	but this   (.) cake that I made   (.) erm   (.) we thought was more like a   (.) a pudding   (.) and I

*ANN:	they're so pale as well.
*BET:	and the next day it, it was   (.) sort o like a rock, well not

*BET:	exactly, but it was pretty 
*ANN:	the only cakes I make in erm   (.) in a microwave are   (.) chocolate cakes
*BET:	And are they alright the next day?
*ANN:	Yes.They're a lot moister if you, if you use dark brown sugar
*BET:	Yeah.
*ANN:	they definitely are a lot more moist.
*BET:	Mm mm.
*ANN:	And as long as you don't over, overcook them.
*BET:	Mm.Mhm.
*ANN:	And I'll tell you what I always do.
*BET:	But what, what do you make them in?Er, like a, a deep er flan, erm 
*ANN:	I've got these, you know the very thin microwave dishes?They're getting a bit battered now.
*BET:	Plastic?
*ANN:	They're very thin plastic.
*BET:	No.I haven't got 
*ANN:	They're about 
*BET:	any plastic ones.
*ANN:	Th I got them in the electricity board, there three for sixty pence.

*ANN:	Mhm.
*BET:	souf I could have done it in there 
*ANN:	That might help.
*BET:	but I didn't, I did it my pyrex   (.) bowl
*ANN:	Yeah.
*BET:	which of course, the bottom is narrower than the top.
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	 [laughing] And it came right up like that 
*ANN:	Ah!Ah!

*ANN:	These things are about   (.) so high.Smales 
*BET:	Yeah.
*ANN:	have a lot of microwave dishes.

*BET:	Oh, just put the greaseproof in?
*ANN:	Ju I just lay a piece of greaseproof in the bottom.
*BET:	Oh!Now, I grease mine and er, I put the greaseproof in.
