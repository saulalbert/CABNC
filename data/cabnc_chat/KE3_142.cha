*TON:	Oh   (.) I've got a horrible feeling I've forgotten to put the milk in the fridge.
*JAC:	Well we'll have a sniff at it and see what it's like.
*TON:	No we won't.
*JAC:	Why?
*TON:	I'm talking about the milk that's in the training room.
*JAC:	Oh   (.) has it ever occurred to you   (.) to take a bottle of milk in from home   (.) save going out to buy it?
*TON:	Erm
*JAC:	Do you think   (.) they 
*TON:	well it's cartons
*JAC:	ah.
*TON:	and they're easier to get rid of   (.) I'd have to bring bottles home again wouldn't I?
*JAC:	Well yeah I suppose you would.
*TON:	And I get the money back.
