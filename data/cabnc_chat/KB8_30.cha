        What does she think's happening to the hospitals? •228807_228968•
*MAG:	I don't think, probably she hasn't really thought it, she's, she's been more concerned with her own self but she's . •229013_229841•
        can't, I don't know. •229841_230033•
        I'll have to have a talk with her. •230033_230245•
*ANN:	Put your daughter straight! •230245_230351•
*MAG:	I've, I've  I've often thought I would never vote Tory but, I mean, I've been better off in some ways in that I was able to buy my council house. •230352_231695•
        But that, as far as I can make out, is the only thing that I've benefited by, you know, with them being in. •231712_232666•
*ANN:	Mm mm. •232666_232699•
*MAG:	erm •232701_232723•
*ANN:	The unemployed certainly haven't been better off. •232723_232955•
*MAG:	The, the thing is  •232956_233194•
*ANN:	The young people leaving school haven't been better off. •233194_233559•
*MAG:	Well it would be erm, the number of people who are being put out of work •233559_233984•
*ANN:	Yeah. •233985_233986•
*MAG:	and it's not just every week or every month, it's every day, when you hear of jobs being lost  •233986_234593•
*ANN:	That's right. •234593_234677•
*MAG:	It's a, it's a   •234677_234885•
*ANN:	And isn't it a hundred, hundred and, hundred and fifty small businesses go bust every year? •234885_235439•
        I mean they keep saying we've given the all, all these opportunities to all these  •235439_235890•
*MAG:	a case in point  •235890_235998•
*ANN:	small businessmen and there's a hundred and fifty. •235998_236153•
*MAG:	She tried to get, she's tried to get started making, doing her own business, spoke to her the other day and she's, well, Pat spoke to her on Sunday and she got more out of her than I did •236153_237168•
*ANN:	Mm. •237233_237254•
*MAG:	but er, she's not getting  •237254_237408•
*ANN:	No. •237408_237417•
        Paul next door left school, you know, he all he wanted to be was a mechanic, it's, it's all he's ever been, he's really good. •237417_238387•
        But he's learnt from his father •238433_238576•
*MAG:	Mm mm. •238613_238642•
*ANN:	and he couldn't a job and then, I I mean, he tried for apprenticeships all over the place and other jobs and he just couldn't get one! •238659_239449•
        When his father died, when he was twenty- one, he took over the erm taxi business. •239473_239842•
        Well it was private hire, but most of the work came from Northgate Hospital. •239842_240359•
*MAG:	Mm mm. •240359_240420•
*ANN:	You know they, they ran, they took the nurses, because the nurses home was a mile or, was it a mile or a mile and a half or something from the hospital, they had this, they took them in the morning and then they took them at lunchtime and then all the different shifts coming on and off they took them, and they had the schools run as well. •240420_242712•
        And then, of course the er, they started running down Northgate hospital and they closed down the nurses home. •242795_243267•
        So there was half his business worked out, wiped out in one go. •243267_243876•
        And then erm, his schools run was way up into the country, quite a long way  and then that was changed. •243915_244618•
        First of all the erm registration went up, then something else went up and then  two of his children from farthest away were moving so he was gonna be paid much less than that. •244618_246311•
        Well the ordinary private hire, there's so many of them, I mean his dad had been doing it for years but there's so many started up. •246517_247431•
*MAG:	Yes. •247431_247463•
*ANN:	He couldn't compete! •247463_247528•
        And, and then finally the council said, he actually had an Austin Princess, but you know Paul and his cars that that nineteen, I don't know what it is the car he's got in his garage now, but he buys old cars and completely rebuilds them, it looks like a new car now and he he had an Austin Princess which, which actually it was a P reg and er they told him he couldn't run the service unless he bought a much newer car. •247528_250293•
        And he couldn't do it, because, the pair of them, I mean, that was, that business was supporting his mother as well and between them, after they'd paid for the petrol, they were taking in less than a hundred pounds a week and that was for the two of them. •250298_252164•
*MAG:	Two. •252164_252224•
*ANN:	So he couldn't keep it going any longer and he had to give it up, so he's on the dole again. •252255_252886•
        It's about  oh, it's, it's over a year since he packed in and he's applied for hundreds of jobs. •252887_253431•
        He's applied for jobs in Washington and •253600_253784•
*MAG:	Mm mm. •253784_253819•
*ANN:	you know it's quite  •253827_253965•

*MAG:	and they had, •255223_255375•
*ANN:	wrote to. •255402_255426•
*MAG:	they expected, they expected a lot of er  applications. •255426_255931•
        They got thirty thousand! •255931_255972•
*ANN:	Yes. •255972_256001•
*MAG:	Phew! •256001_256007•
        You know, it was er, it was ridiculous   •256007_256228•

*ANN:	then we got the new front door so only Betty now has got er, a spare backdoor key  which wasn't much good the day I bolted the door into the kitchen! •269327_270331•

*MAG:	I've been grateful for Jessie  having my key because er I've locked myself out one or two  •270669_271272•
*ANN:	Yes. •271272_271330•
*MAG:	You know, I get out the door and I think I've left the key  in the lock. •271343_271871•
*ANN:	There's something extremely sticky on this windowsill. •271908_272273•
*MAG:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Urgh! •272273_272323•
        It's all claggy. •272331_272421•

*MAG:	oh there's my paper . •273251_273542•
*ANN:	Oh. •273542_273551•
*MAG:	What happens as far as patients in hospital are concerned Ann when it comes to an election? •273551_273874•
*ANN:	Well if they've applied in time they can get a postal vote. •273874_274739•
*MAG:	Mm. •274749_274775•
*ANN:	Er  or they can ask for someone to take them. •274775_274996•
        Jim's actually running people from Comfort House  there. •274996_275196•
        Someone er  asked  it was someone who was deliving, delivering the erm election  the polling cards. •275222_275954•
        He'd been helping his wife to, she must work for the council and he'd been helping her and he said er  the matron at Comfort House had asked and he, and he'd noticed Jim's name on when he delivered ours so he knew where they could, he'd take them. •275954_278999•
        The only thing is in a place like that they're more likely to be Tory. •279000_279526•
        However, Jim says he'll take them. •279528_279683•
*MAG:	Where is Comfort House? •279683_279747•
