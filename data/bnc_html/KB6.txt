               pound Ange, he said you can give me some money next week.
               [3] Don't worry about it, get what you want and I'll fill this
               for you.

               [9] I said I'll give you a tenner to build it all for me.
               [10] Drill it and do everything.
               [11] Come with me, get the wood, measure it the lot.
               [12] And he said that's alright.
Chris (PS02A)  [13] So how much you reckon that's gonna be, cost then?

               six erm ... sixty inches.

               [18] You don't want that thin little stuff like that.
               [19] He said and that cost me ... he looked round, twenty two
               pound.
               [20] Well I said Angie said she went up Wicks' and got her
               worktops and it cost her fifteen pound.
               [21] ... And he said well Wicks' are cheaper he said we'll go to
               Wicks' then and ... I'll measure up for it when I come over.

               [27] But if not if, if ... I go up with them and I'd go in with
               them.
               [28] Just wait in the car.
               [29] I'll go in with them and see what I gotta get ... and just
               strap it on the roof.
               [30] And he'll come home and do it he said.

                           [1872] You could do it.
Sue (PS02E)                [1873] Yeah, no ... the thing is I'm not a driver.
                           [1874] I shouldn't have took it in the first place.
Angela (PS029)             [1875] Well you passed it.
Sue (PS02E)                [1876] I passed.
                           [1877] Yeah, the second time.

                           things I haven't got time to bloody think about
                           driving.
Angela (PS029)             [1881] That's like me.
                           [1882] I had six right and on the, on the fifth one
                           he said you done really well, I didn't tell you
                           nothing.
                           [1883] On the sixth one ... it was like this sort of
                           year and I was getting into Christmas and that.
                           [1884] And I'm driving along ... and I'm thinking
                           all about Christmas
Sue (PS02E)                [1885] You [...] panic now then I should imagine.

                           panic then.

Sue (PS02E)                [1889] What, taking your sixth test, did you say?
Angela (PS029)             [1890] Not ... test.
                           [1891] I mean like lessons [...]

                           [1895] That was it.
                           [1896] I started thinking about Christmas then
                           didn't I?
                           [1897] Not what I'm doing.
                           [1898] He had to grab the wheel twice I think he
                           smashed two cars coming down the road.
Sue (PS02E)                [1899] Oh no.
Angela (PS029)             [1900] I thought that's it.

                           [2229] He wanted to know where the strimmer was, he
                           was [...]

                           [2234] Oh and she didn't take no bloody notice of me
                           might have been [...]
Sue (PS02E)                [2235] Well she knows she's, she's a bit funny then.
                           [2236] Otherwise she wouldn't feel so conscious
                           about it.
Angela (PS029)             [2237] [...] You gotta be careful with her.
Sue (PS02E)                [2238] Mm.
Angela (PS029)             [2239] You know, what you say to her.
                           [2240] And if you tell her about somebody she'll
                           tell them.

Sue (PS02E)                [laugh]
Angela (PS029)             [2244] Yeah you've gotta be careful.
                           [2245] Cos ... Ange said she'd, she'd been chatting
                           about Jenny to her.
                           [2246] She went and told Jenny.
                           [2247] And Jenny asked Ange about it.
                           [2248] See?
Sue (PS02E)                [2249] Maybe it's the best thing she could have done
                           then, get a job?
Angela (PS029)             [2250] Yeah.
                           [2251] ... And now she's paranoid.
                           [2252] She thinks everyone's talking about her.
                           [2253] I said I've got better things to do than talk
                           about you Lynn.
Sue (PS02E)                [2254] Yeah.
Angela (PS029)             [2255] And that day we was all over Jenny's.
                           [2256] Ange said let's pop in Jenny's.
                           [2257] So we go down Jenny's and er ... the door
                           knocked and I said [whispering] Christ it's Lynn []
                           .
                           [2258] And Lynn came in.
                           [2259] You should have seen her face ... cos we were
                           sat in Jenny's.
Sue (PS02E)                [2260] Ooh.

                           [2263] She does stare quite a bit I must admit.
Angela (PS029)             [2264] Yeah.
Sue (PS02E)                [2265] Don't she?
Angela (PS029)             [2266] Yeah she does.
Sue (PS02E)                [2267] as if every, she thinks everybody is talking
                           about her [...] .
Angela (PS029)             [2268] Yes.
Sue (PS02E)                [2269] There's no need for it.
Angela (PS029)             [2270] Yeah I know.
Sue (PS02E)                [2271] And what's this ... Angie's taking her kid
                           ... little boy out of school.
Angela (PS029)             [2272] Yeah.
                           [2273] She's thinking of taking him out isn't she.
                           [2274] Cos erm ... I mean she went to a report
                           evening and Miss said, was saying about Jay and
                           saying ... you know if he falls behind you ... know
                           what'll happen and Ange says what?
                           [2275] Well you'll have to go in the office.
                           [2276] ... Course that was playing on Angie's mind
                           see and Miss said she'd give Jason extra work.
Sue (PS02E)                [2277] Yeah.
Angela (PS029)             [2278] Cos it had been playing on her mind for
                           weeks.
Sue (PS02E)                [2279] Mm.
Angela (PS029)             [2280] So she's been trying to get work off her.
                           [2281] Well in the end she took a stack and went in
                           to see ... Miss and Miss tried to change the
                           subject,subj
Sue (PS02E)                [2282] Subject.
Angela (PS029)             [2283] Yeah.
                           [2284] So erm ... anyway she told her that she
                           wanted Jay out.
                           [2285] And she wanted her to [...] Mr .
                           [2286] Well she hasn't gone to Mr .
                           [2287] So Ange rang this bloke, woman who ... sorted
                           out Chrissie at at the school.
Sue (PS02E)                [2288] Yeah.
Angela (PS029)             [2289] And she goes up Parker school so ... she was
                           going, she said to Ange she was talking to Miss
                           tomorrow.
                           [2290] Yesterday, sorry.
Sue (PS02E)                [2291] Yeah.
Angela (PS029)             [2292] But Ange hasn't heard nothing.
                           [2293] So I think she's gonna ring them back up
                           again.
                           [2294] I think Miss shouldn't have said what she
                           said because ... Jay hasn't got a problem.
                           [2295] But she just said it ... like if he drops
                           down like Chrissie you know what would happen see?
Sue (PS02E)                [2296] Yeah.
Angela (PS029)             [2297] Course it worried Ange look cos she don't
                           want to go back in the office like last time.
Sue (PS02E)                [2298] Mm. ...

                           [2324] No, I trimmed it for her last week
Angela (PS029)             [2325] Yeah.
Sue (PS02E)                [2326] cos it needed cutting.
                           [2327] But she, she's asked me to perm it and she's
                           cancelled and she's ever so funny with hairdressers
                           sort of thing.
                           [2328] Well erm ... I said if you want me to do it
                           let me know and I'll come and do it but just make
                           ... well she's cancelled before because once she
                           hadn't got the money and ...
Angela (PS029)             [2329] Oh.
Sue (PS02E)                [2330] which is the excuse, I'd rather somebody went
                           along sort of said right I'll have it done such and
                           such a time rather than keep buggering about
Angela (PS029)             [2331] Yeah.
Sue (PS02E)                [2332] like anybody, do you know what I mean?
Angela (PS029)             [2333] Yeah.
Sue (PS02E)                [2334] Oh come on, you've got to have one more in
                           here.
                           [2335] Right.
                           [2336] And er ... you know she asked me to cut it
                           for her so I cut it for her.
Angela (PS029)             [2337] Yeah.
Sue (PS02E)                [2338] Which, it looks a hell of a lot better now
                           ... than what it did before.
Angela (PS029)             [2339] Yeah, cos it looked a bit heavy I thought, on
                           top didn't it?
Sue (PS02E)                [2340] Yeah but erm ...
Angela (PS029)             [2341] So what time did you cut Ange's hair?
Sue (PS02E)                [2342] About eleven.
Angela (PS029)             [2343] She still going up Kingswood?
Sue (PS02E)                [2344] I don't know.
Angela (PS029)             [2345] Well she was going to go up Kingswood to see
                           Lynn.
Sue (PS02E)                [2346] Oh ... yeah.
Angela (PS029)             [2347] So she still might go up.
                           [2348] If you cut her hair at eleven she said
Sue (PS02E)                [2349] Mm.
Angela (PS029)             [2350] she said was ... she was going to go up about

                           that alright?
Sue (PS02E)                [2358] No.
