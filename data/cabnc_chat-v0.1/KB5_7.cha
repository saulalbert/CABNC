*AND:	Mhm. •153484_153500•
*SAN:	That's a bit of a drag. •153500_153577•
*AND:	Yeah. •153620_153638•
*SAN:	That's a bit of a long drag that one, not that  Paul take open up a bit there and go a bit faster, level, but that was a bit Well's done a left up to Chell's Field and that, bloody that killed him, I bet, you know the bit I mean, and up over the fields, where you go through the fields and  fields, that was the killer, cos  and coming back  Bell's straight round to , got to the bottom,Hill wasn't too bad. •153693_156437•
*AND:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	It's a short, sharp, you can see it there, you get to  the top of it, get up to your roundabout, we hang a right, and the next, it's a bit of a drag all the way up, you save coming, coming the other way it's down hill, from just past The Bull, until you get to the , almost to that junction you turn off the top and you're going up hill, just slowly, but cor, you get up to that, our junction, she drops down, we went straight down through the High Street, and we hung a right in the one way system, turn left, didn't get, quite get to Green Lane, turn left and up we come round the Green Lane, up and in the back way. •156522_160526•
*AND:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	Mm. •160563_160571•
        I say, it took us three quarters of an hour to get there, three quarters of an hour to get there, just over the half an hour getting back. •160571_161834•
        Mind you got short  that was a killer up round by   place. •161864_162523•
        I reckon we got down from The Bells, Chell's Field, to the bottom of , six, seven minutes. •162768_163315•
*VAL:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	Might be a bit more than that, but erm, could of been nine. •163833_164106•
        She said  wouldn't get up  hill  How these blokes go  I don't know,aren't they? •164198_165773•
*AND:	Mm  •165844_165850•
*SAN:	Mind you, it's the bloke in the front keeps  don't he? •166443_166725•
        Keep tucked in behind the side  always said to you, the bloke in the front, mate, he does all the donkey work, picking up  drags you round don't it? •166725_167581•
        Whether he punches hole in the wind, in the air or not I dunno, like cards. •167635_167930•
*AND:	Yeah. •168041_168052•
*SAN:	He does seem eager, up behind some, long as you get a right distance, too far and you get oh, they're fighting it again, whereas you can get right up. •168052_168790•
        We were thinking of  the car, a slower car, could overtake a  by getting up behind you, and when you coming out, as soon as he comes out •169474_170232•
*AND:	Yeah. •170232_170255•
*SAN:	he's got to go back again. •170274_170377•
*AND:	That's what I thought. •170377_170462•
*SAN:	But they don't, do they? •170469_170535•
        You get, or you get two cars of equal speed, along straight •170574_170850•
*AND:	Well it's a memento innit? •170850_171021•
*SAN:	one get, yeah, one gets up behind it and can  in the back I suppose, but they go after they, and then, you think as soon as you pull out, you're gonna get all that, yeah, he's gonna get all that, but they don't do they? •171029_172055•
        They don't . •172055_172094•
        Gotta be a reason for that I suppose. •172627_172748•
        Cos they're going flat out when they're like that, it's not like you gonna say like, when you go on a , like overtake mode, when you're like that, they are flat out down the straight, all you go to get a  out. •173306_174284•
*AND:	Mm. •174305_174319•
*SAN:	It's not like  •174319_174383•
*AND:	He goes  •174383_174430•
*SAN:	Yes, it's not like he's going, he's, he's going faster than this geezer, he's not, he's getting a drag from him, then all of a sudden he comes out and he goes faster you think,explain a little bit more on the old . •174447_175599•
*AND:	I really don't know. •175661_175742•
*SAN:	same  lines, but, he know he , you assume that as soon as you got outside him, that bloody draft would come round and push him back and the other bloke would carry on. •176146_177136•
*AND:	Yeah. •177179_177193•
*SAN:	We might have a bit of a winner tonight. •177886_178177•
