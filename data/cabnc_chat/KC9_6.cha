*DIN:	Pretty bloody awful . •158784_158901•
*GIN:	and he was whining . •158910_158986•
        She said it's alright Herbie I'm here and he  for a minute. •158986_159140•
        And I said he's gonna do damage if he's trying to get up at the door •159140_159494•

        And she said you know, on no account must he strain. •160293_160604•
        Obviously he's got dissolving stitches in. •160610_160919•
        On his insides. •160939_160970•
        And she said there was so little muscle  left. •160970_161403•
        It had been so stretched and strained by . •161403_161646•

        Peter will . •162115_162139•
        And of course Audrey's not too quick on her feet you see since she broke her hip. •162406_163048•
        So I was trying to  help Audrey and that and help Herbie. •163048_163417•
        So Herbie didn't try and jump in the car before I could lift him and trying to get Audrey in with her stiff leg. •163488_164105•
        And then get the rug across her . •164105_164388•
        She didn't turn a hair when   she said two hundred and ninety three pounds. •164388_165991•
