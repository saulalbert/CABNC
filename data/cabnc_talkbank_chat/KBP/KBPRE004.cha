*PS066:	I would n't be surprised .  837003_838323
*PS065:	Probably Mm Mm I 'm wondering what made them change their mind over the er knock through into the garage .  838323_851513
*PS066:	Well I suppose they thought it was a bit too much I mean the place they 've got there it er it would mean .  851513_858693
*PS065:	Oh I 'm not sugge .  858693_859053

*PS065:	Yes but surely they thought that through before they got to the stage that I mean even with the mortgage .  862793_867823
*PS066:	Well that 's probably why they 've decided against it .  867823_870313

*PS066:	They 're having a mini break instead .  889183_891093
*PS065:	Oh possibly again i it 's just possible actually that the construction of the bungalow did n't lend itself properly well to knocking through .  891093_897983
*PS066:	Well I think oh well it 's so beautiful I mean as it is in there they do n't need anything doing to I mean .  898143_904563
