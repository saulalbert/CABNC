@Comment:	conversation #1 (Tape 003901)File not found : 
*ADA:	The two companies concerned are trying to record the spoken word. •_•
*CHA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	We don't want you on tape. •_•
*ADA:	So the thing, the thing to do is to sort of dot around in the conversation things like antidisestablishmentarianism. •_•
        And hopefully   •_•
*CAR:	This will get modern usage of words. •_•
        Of, one of the words that she was talking about, people have started using wicked for  a normal phrase. •_•
        I mean, it doesn't mean what it says in the dictionary any more. •_•
*PAU:	That's a really wicked thing to say, he went, no it's not it's bad, it's not wicked. •_•
        He thinks of wicked as being good, he doesn't, cause Mandy says wicked. •_•
*CAR:	Yeah. •_•
        Well that's the idea anyway. •_•
*PAU:	He goes round saying wicked, it's his favourite word. •_•
*CAR:	Are you going to go to sleep, eh? •_•
        Please   That doesn't mean much, does it? •_•
*ADA:	She's just looking over there to see which one she wants to throw up on. •_•
*CAR:	Who do you want to go and gurgle at? •_•
        Eh? •_•
*PAU:	Oh not Uncle Brian, no no no. •_•
*CAR:	No? •_•
        Have you had enough grub for a little while? •_•
        There you are, go and see somebody. •_•
*PAU:	she's got a ginormous one. •_•
        She had it . •_•
        Well don't  to me I've only just you •_•
*ADA:	Come on, give Auntie Pauline a nice smile. •_•
*CAR:	Go on, you do lovely smiles. •_•
*PAU:	 ((baby talk)) (.) 
*CAR:	If she smiles it will be at your hairline. •_•
        Pardon? •_•
*UNK:	She won't be able to see that far, will she? •_•
*CAR:	She might be able to see a blurred shape. •_•
*PAU:	she's just looked this way now. •_•
        She kept looking over there. •_•
        Don't know what she was looking at. •_•
        What were you looking at? •_•
*CAR:	Well she definitely looks at her mobile. •_•
*ADA:	Yeah? •_•
*CAR:	I know it drives you mad, the music but er  •_•
*ADA:	I wouldn't mind if those blasted  slightly longer life in terms of the music they played. •_•
        But unfortunately, you know, it's  or whatever. •_•
        But it's  over again. •_•
*CAR:	Well, yes. •_•
        Well I mean that's what's nice for them, isn't it? •_•
*PAU:	Yeah. •_•
        You see they've got a short concentration. •_•
*ADA:	Do you think  music in the background  sort of, do all the lyrics as well . •_•
*CAR:	Oh of course Oh well done. •_•
        the last half hour. •_•
*PAU:	a little bit wasn't it? •_•
*CAR:	She's had a lot of that today. •_•
*PAU:	Have you? •_•
*CAR:	Well don't put it on too loud, will you? •_•
*PAU:	why babies have a suck there. •_•
        You say they're having milk, he went, what do you mean? •_•
        Milk? •_•
        What do you mean milk comes out there? •_•
        So I said well it's only when you've just had a baby like, you know, like cows. •_•
*CAR:	Love him. •_•
