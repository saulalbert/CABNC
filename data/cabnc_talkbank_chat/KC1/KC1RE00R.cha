*PS09E:	Yeah the front just hinges off at the top .  2207503_2210473
*PS09G:	It 's not at the back of the here is it .  2210613_2213363
*PS09E:	It mi it may do why Have you spotted something .  2213363_2215563
*PS09G:	Du n no if it 's the second one down that way or not but there 's a crack across there Or is i is it a crack or a scratch This is the right one .  2215563_2227823
*PS09E:	Yeah that 's the right one Oh I 'll get my magnifier Thing is you 're actually using your eyes are not too good .  2228893_2246453
*PS09G:	Well I go get the magnifier to read the bloody magazine sometimes It 's ridiculous I 'm going back to the opticians with the the new glasses I got are still flipping worse than these .  2246453_2255813
*PS09E:	No it 's just a scratch I think Mm somebody 's been working on this though have n't they The sound chip 's in the wrong place .  2261503_2278673
*PS09G:	Crikey Well this is high enough .  2284593_2285863
*PS09E:	Yeah it 's probably worth changing the control in n it to see what happens They 've evidently looked you can see where they 've scratched to get a screwdriver through there to try and get the sound the sound out .  2286473_2313843
*PS09G:	Could n't you tell with the meter er th th th the control whether it 's worth it or not .  2314233_2316963
*PS09E:	Yeah you should be able to .  2317773_2318703
*PS09G:	Yeah but I do n't think the it 'll do what you want .  2318703_2324363
*PS09E:	Yeah you 'll have to Mm .  2333033_2334773
*PS09G:	Want a se want a screwdriver there .  2334813_2339043
*PS09E:	I got one there yeah .  2339523_2347863
*PS09G:	0 . 
*PS09E:	Yeah I got one yes .  2348393_2351703
*PS09G:	Gon na turn it as well .  2351703_2353203
*PS09E:	Yeah If you can oh let's put it on .  2353583_2361393
*PS09G:	around from one end to the other that is .  2361483_2378633
*PS09E:	Yeah Right .  2378733_2378963
*PS09G:	Right now one end to the other .  2378963_2381473
*PS09E:	Is it Oh Go that way .  2381473_2382203
*PS09G:	No .  2382203_2382263
*PS09E:	Well that 's I 'll get there eventually That 's not reading through anything that one .  2382263_2391563
*PS09G:	That wo n't read through .  2391863_2392313
*PS09E:	Yeah I think so Now one end is joined so a bit Okay Nothing .  2392313_2400593
*PS09G:	No .  2405643_2406033
*PS09E:	So it was circuit then Just try the one above cos I think they 're oh wait a minute I 'm not looking at .  2406353_2413433
*PS09G:	You do n't want to go there .  2413433_2414163
*PS09E:	I 'm not silly sod Right .  2414163_2415213
*PS09G:	Right that moves Not much there .  2415353_2421283
*PS09E:	It should go right across at one end .  2423333_2425613
*PS09G:	No No that 's .  2425613_2428113
*PS09E:	Oh it is open circuit then .  2428123_2428703
*PS09G:	Yeah it 's trying to go that .  2429813_2431873
*PS09E:	Yeah .  2432043_2432173
*PS09G:	way .  2432173_2432363

*PS09G:	Tu turn .  2435493_2435633
*PS09E:	Tu 0 . 
*PS09G:	that .  2437583_2437683
*PS09E:	Yeah turn that one yep Even the Remember where you can get it back to that 's the only thing .  2437683_2442313
*PS09G:	Oh Oh it 's back where it was at one end .  2442433_2446673
*PS09E:	What are you doing this .  2446673_2451783
*PS09G:	Ah ha let me just twiddle it Hang on th check this up and twiddling time .  2452383_2455393
*PS09E:	Yeah see this is the wiper this should well assure itself back to that one .  2456983_2461013
*PS09G:	Goes when you touch it there .  2461013_2462513
*PS09E:	Yeah just touching the ends together .  2462513_2464303
*PS09G:	Oh .  2464303_2464613
*PS09E:	Mm I 'll try the other one cos I 've got that in bits If you can twiddle that one I 'll er .  2464743_2476803
*PS09G:	Yep .  2476803_2476943
*PS09E:	second one down It reads totally different That 's it Up one end down the other .  2476943_2488323
*PS09G:	More positive that one as well .  2488323_2492763
*PS09E:	Yeah That 's .  2492763_2493773
*PS09G:	Yeah .  2493783_2493793
*PS09E:	what it should read like So it 's definitely on the circuit .  2494493_2499323
*PS09G:	So it 's down to the chip and we have n't had the chance of being .  2499563_2506913
*PS09E:	We might have to we might be able to get away without having to take the board out if I if I use the old de- solderer might be able to just hook it out and put the next one in Yeah but yo that 's what they did change you looking for the fault .  2506913_2652153
*PS09G:	Yeah Mm mm mm mm mm mm Ah ah What was that in the I fo forgot now .  2656493_2680503
