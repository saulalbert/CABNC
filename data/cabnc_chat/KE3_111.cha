        Why is it lately that I go to, before I start my  my work •688292_694092•
*TON:	Mhm? •695242_695412•
*JAC:	I feel absolutely done in. •695412_697182•
        You know I've worked so much at home •697182_698522•
*TON:	Mm. •699112_699352•
*JAC:	that I feel so tired. •700422_703822•
        So I think this is half the reason why  I'm not  that . •704562_710392•
*TON:	Mm. •711362_711652•
*JAC:	Because by the time I get to work •712312_716232•

*JAC:	You know? •718062_718412•
*TON:	 ((sigh)) 
*JAC:	You get there and there's, there's not that much pressure so you tend to sort of think  ah. •722782_732702•
        And you go at the speed that it warrants. •733392_735652•
*TON:	Mm. •736142_736282•
*JAC:	If there's a lot to do you go quicker and if there's not you go slower. •736282_770662•
