*TON:	Mm, mm. •792472_792662•
*MAR:	What we do is take the, the day of the week and the, the calendar date, it might be the  say it was the fourth day of the week Thursday •794562_804292•
*TON:	Yeah. •805232_805352•
*MAR:	And it was July, it's got to . •805352_808312•
        It was the third day in July, page four, seven, three and then I had to find a word that I'd never heard off before and put it up on the board. •809222_821702•
*UNK:	. •_•
*MAR:	Like gromwell,.. •824362_824902•
*UNK:	. •_•
*MAR:	And then people would put up there suggestions of what a gromwell was  . •826172_830642•
*UNK:	. •_•
*MAR:	It was good fun, we won't, I won't re-institute that one. •833382_837312•
*UNK:	Yeah that's good. •837312_838122•
*MAR:	Ginormous, where are we, ginormous, erm, no it's not in here and er G Y or J I or J Y so no it doesn't  . •838122_852552•
*TON:	No , but eh, another word that was  I've heard used, and it was, actually it was quite annoying because the chap used it, used it wrongly, but I didn't know that he'd used it wrongly at the time. •852562_868152•
*MAR:	Mm, mm. •868152_868482•
        What  . •868902_868962•
*TON:	It was paradigm. •868962_869822•
*MAR:	Paradigm? •869822_870702•
*TON:	Yes. •871102_871622•
*MAR:	Yeah, paradigm that, that's a bit like a paradox but completely different •871912_879162•
*TON:	. •_•
*MAR:	What, what is it  as a paradigm . •879162_880962•
*TON:	You, you, you can't, yeah , you said you can't use er money as a paradigm for energy. •881172_889942•
*MAR:	Ah. •889942_890582•
*TON:	And what he really meant to say was, you can't use money as a er a  as a sort of parallel to energy, but paradigm doesn't mean parallel, it means something, something different. •891542_907032•
*MAR:	It does, doesn't it? •907032_907882•
*TON:	Yeah. •908282_908342•
*MAR:	I mean it's not  they way you expect it either, yeah, paradigm means example of pattern of, reflection of noun, hence parasite, big . •908342_919522•
*UNK:	. •_•
*MAR:	No, I don't think I believe  at all. •920722_925292•
*TON:	No, but, he was using it as, as a fancy word for parallel and he wasn't using it properly. •926702_934292•
        The trouble is I didn't know because I've never heard the word before. •934292_937522•
*MAR:	So, you could off asked him, what's he mean by the word paradigm. •937522_941612•
*TON:	Yeah. •942172_942432•
*MAR:	Because I've never used that word before, he'll say something completely pathetic. •943182_948962•
*TON:	. •_•
*MAR:	At least you'll know what he meant by it. •950162_951342•
