*NOE:	My wife's    (  )   
*ENI:	 Hello Ian, oh I was hoping  that you'd come and see us. 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	That's  wonderful. 
*IAN:	  (  )  to see you. 
*ENI:	I'm just getting, will you   (  ) tea? 
*IAN:	Yes, I'd love one.  Thank you. 
*ENI:	 Right  I'll just get that. 
*NOE:	Well how are things going? 
*IAN:	Yes  business okay   
*NOE:	  (  )  
*IAN:	Mm   (.) no  ((laugh))  
*NOE:	No? Oh dear dear dear 
*IAN:	not at all, no. 
*NOE:	Is old   (  ) alright? 
*IAN:	Just about yes   (.) yes. 
*NOE:	That must be worrying, a lot of people feel like that don't they? 
*IAN:	Yes. No it's, it's been a very bad eighteen months  er   
*NOE:	 Oh dear. 
*IAN:	cos the, the business that I was 
*NOE:	What? 
*IAN:	the business I was a director of 
*NOE:	Yes? 
*IAN:	er last year   (.) went into receivership 
*NOE:	Oh lord. 
*IAN:	in January 
*NOE:	Ooh. Now does that have a er I, I know you lose the income but   (.) does it, does it penalize you at all? 
*IAN:	Yes it does. 
*NOE:	Oh dear. 
*IAN:	Yes. Yeah we've had er   (.) the D T I investigating 
*NOE:	Oh lord. 
*IAN:	cos it was quite a big company. 
*NOE:	Oh. 
*IAN:	But erm   (.) it just er hopefully because yeah but really they're just trying to investigate to make sure that we didn't act fraudulently  in any way. 
*NOE:	 Oh yes.  Oh good. I mean  I don't suppose   
*IAN:	 Which, which  we didn't.  You know it was the   
*NOE:	  (  )  
*IAN:	it was the downturn that erm 
*NOE:	Yes, ooh   
*IAN:	 you know  that started nineteen   (.)  nineteen ninety one. 
*NOE:	 What was the business  what er did you do? 
*IAN:	In, in advertising. 
*NOE:	Advertising  oh yes. 
*IAN:	 An  advertising agency. 
*NOE:	Oh. 
*IAN:	Yeah. But about   (.) a third of the top agencies in our sector all went bust  in   
*NOE:	 Good  god. 
*IAN:	in the last eighteen months. 
*NOE:	Cos living up here privately in retirement one doesn't realize these things. 
*IAN:	I mean er unemployment in er   (.) white collar management   (.) area is, is, is very marked now. 
*NOE:	Is it? 
*IAN:	Yeah it's   (.) yes. Yes it's really affect  affected our, our businesses. There's so many areas that have contracted so much. 
*NOE:	Yes and i  it's a, it's   (  ) long  erm   
*IAN:	 It is, yes. 
*NOE:	process    (  )   
*IAN:	 Yes.  Affects everything. But, you know, things are going okay. 
*NOE:	But you, you managing just, just to hold on    (  )   
*IAN:	 Just about yes. Yeah. 
*NOE:	Cos as you know Ben's in Hong Kong 
*IAN:	Yes? (  ) yes. 
*NOE:	He's suddenly swapping from the police to er security in   (.) a big bank. 
*IAN:	Oh fascinating. 
*NOE:	 (  ) 
*IAN:	Oh. 
*NOE:	Erm I, I suppose it'll be a couple of years before he does that but    (  )   
*IAN:	 Well, yes. 
*NOE:	yes. 
*IAN:	Cos he signed up for five, five years didn't he? 
*NOE:	He signed up for three years with an  option   
*IAN:	 Mm   
*NOE:	to do another two. 
*IAN:	Oh I see, yes. 
*NOE:	And I think he's going to work out the other two and then go on to this   (.) forget the name of it at the moment, this bank 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*NOE:	and er but he doesn't want to come back to England. 
*IAN:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*NOE:	 (  ) 
*IAN:	No I was sorry I missed him when he came over last year. 
*NOE:	Last year, yes. 
*IAN:	I just had a quick phonecall with him. 
*NOE:	Oh he did speak to you? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*NOE:	Yes that's right  mm   
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*NOE:	Yes see that time went like lightning. 
*IAN:	Yes.  (.) Such a shame. 
*NOE:	Edmund is still in his job. 
*NOE:	Aha. 
*NOE:	He still hasn't got naturalization but he seems to be fairly   (.) erm fairly secure. He's a journalist of course. 
*IAN:	Yes. Is he confident that he'll get the naturalization? 
*NOE:	Oh yes, eventually  he will. 
*IAN:	 Right. 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*IAN:	W  will that be this year or does it take much longer? 
*NOE:	You can never tell 
*IAN:	Really? 
*NOE:	never tell, a   (.) girl we know went over at the same time as he did   (.) got it this year. 
*IAN:	Really? 
*NOE:	But er it's just the luck of the draw, it all depends upon the temper of the particular official that's handling it I think. 
*IAN:	Yes. (.)  
*NOE:	I'll give you a   (.) funny article he wrote  before you go. 
*IAN:	 Oh I'd  like to see that. (.)  
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) But er   (.) I'm just trying to think now er   (.) Ben   (  ) er the trouble with it is, Edmund can't leave the country   (.) whilst he's in a job   (.) until he gets naturalization because he's got to get a work permit and an entry permit and everything all the way through 
*IAN:	Right. 
*NOE:	and   (.) again er with the present state of unemployment in America it's unlikely he  would get it. 
*IAN:	 It's very difficult.  Yes. 
*NOE:	But he, he managed to   (.) get his extension to his permit because he had these English connections and the paper he was on   (.) reckoned that he was very valuable to them and so they 
*IAN:	Good. 
*NOE:	they held him. 
*IAN:	Good.  (.) Well I'm sure  he's   
*NOE:	 Are your  wife and family well? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*NOE:	They're happy with you are they? 
*IAN:	Yes they are, yes. I wouldn't er   (.) bestow them er on you even for a short visit though. 
*NOE:	Oh  don't be silly. 
*IAN:	 The er  the s  the small one is er 
*NOE:	Oh you've got two have you? 
*IAN:	 ((laughing)) Yes  he's a real handful. 
*NOE:	Is he? Oh dear  dear   
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*NOE:	dear dear. 
*IAN:	Yeah he's er he's nearly two and it's a   (.) er they're trying times. 
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) I've had it five times. 
*IAN:	Yes. We're expecting another one in June. 
*NOE:	Are you really? You    (  )   
*IAN:	 That'll be  that'll be the third. 
*NOE:	But I had five.  Every   
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*NOE:	one I said was the last but it  (  ) . 
*IAN:	 ((laugh)) Oh I see certainly feel that er we must be mad. 
*NOE:	 ((laugh)) 
*IAN:	We must be mad. (.)  
*NOE:	And you're living in Chiswick? 
*IAN:	Yes, yes. Although we'll have to sell that house. 
*NOE:	Would you? What because of the financial position? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*NOE:	Oh dear oh dear 
*IAN:	So er we'll have to wait   (.) we're, we're   (.) er we've put an offer in, in on a house in Weybridge 
*NOE:	Oh yes? 
*IAN:	in Surrey. Erm   (.) not particularly because we, we wanted to go to Weybridge but er 
*NOE:	Cos travelling's expensive isn't it? 
*IAN:	It is actually. Fifteen hundred pounds 
*NOE:	 ((whistling)) 
*IAN:	for twenty five minutes' journey to Waterloo. But it's got a huge garden which with the two boys I think will be marvellous. 
*NOE:	Oh yes. 
*IAN:	It's very unusual for a   (.) even in a, a suburban er 
*NOE:	 Yes. 
*IAN:	 area.  Huge garden. 
*NOE:	I know Weybridge slightly. 
*IAN:	Do you? Oh. 
*NOE:	Mm. Erm   (.) but will you make, be able to make much profit on the   (.) on your old Chiswick house to be able to buy the Weybridge one, will that be an economic move? 
*IAN:	Erm   (.) we save quite a lot er which is what we're trying to do, yes. 
*NOE:	Oh good, yes. 
*IAN:	Erm   (.) and it's er it's a good area for schools 
*NOE:	It is a good area for schools, mm. 
*IAN:	a  a  and er it's you know  a reasonable community   
*NOE:	 As a matter of fact I knew an old  couple that ran a, had a nursery school there, a big one and a very successful one. 
*IAN:	Yes I imagine it, it would be. 
*NOE:	 For a number of  years they did have but er 
*IAN:	It's a shame about le  leaving   (.) Hounslow where Chiswick is 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*IAN:	because they provide nursery places.  And   
*NOE:	 Yes. 
*IAN:	so Thomas who's three is at school. 
*NOE:	Oh yes. 
*IAN:	Whereas Surrey doesn't until they're five. 
*NOE:	Oh dear. 
*IAN:	So we'll have to put them 
*NOE:	Even if they don't you can sometimes find that   (.) if you get behind the scenes that there is a way of doing it. 
*IAN:	Yes. Yes. 
*NOE:	Got to spin a hard luck story, something of that sort. 
*IAN:	Yeah. Yes. But erm   (.) we're very lucky where we are. The state schools are very good. 
*NOE:	Are they, in Chiswick? 
*IAN:	 They do seem  very good. Very pleased with them. But erm it's difficult living in London now. The erm   (.) you really are aware, I don't know if you get up to London much? 
*NOE:	Do occasionally, yes. 
*IAN:	Yes but the erm   (.) the atmosphere 
*NOE:	Oh I hate London, it's awful. (  )   
*IAN:	 Chris   Christmas day   (.) I had a real chest erm   (.) and mouth and everything. 
*NOE:	I can quite believe it. 
*IAN:	And it's erm it's so oppressive and we really worry about it with the children. 
*NOE:	Yes well I can see that, mm. I er I very much dislike London. We've got, still got a little house there 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*NOE:	and er so it gets sort of  
*IAN:	At the organ works? 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*NOE:	It's a bolt hole 
*IAN:	Mhm. 
*NOE:	but I very seldom use it. 
*IAN:	Yes.  (.) How, how's the er organ business  going? 
*NOE:	 They're  up to their eyes in work.  Plenty of   
*IAN:	 Really? 
*NOE:	of work. Mm. 
*IAN:	Good. 
*NOE:	Lot of it export. 
*IAN:	Good. 
*ENI:	Ian do you have milk in your tea? 
*IAN:	Just milk, that'll be   
*ENI:	 Just   
*IAN:	lovely. 
*ENI:	yes  right. 
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	No sugar? 
*IAN:	No thank you. 
*ENI:	Oh good lad. (.)  
*NOE:	Oh yes John s  came back from Japan 
*IAN:	Really? 
*NOE:	They, he built a large organ   (  ) university of   (  ) or    (  )   
*IAN:	 Yes, yes. 
*NOE:	And er   (.) he was back there ten days ago for some or other to see another customer   (.) and when he came, only got back into the country on Monday or Tuesday 
*IAN:	Aha. 
*NOE:	beginning of this week   (.) and then today I've had a letter from an architect friend in America suggesting he gets in touch with an architect in   (  ) for another job    (  )   
*IAN:	 Yes, yes. 
*NOE:	I'm taking it down to him tomorrow. 
*IAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	But he's   (.) he's got work in there to come.  (.) He's going to build a new organ for Chelmsford cathedral. 
*IAN:	Oh that's good  (  )  
*NOE:	A new one for St John's College Cambridge, he's really quite busy. 
*IAN:	Good. Good well I'm pleased that er business is strong. 
*NOE:	Oh yes he's alright. Yes. 
*ENI:	Well Ian and how are you doing? 
*IAN:	Oh not too bad.  Keeping fit   
*ENI:	 Really? 
*IAN:	anyway. Yes. 
*ENI:	You're keeping fit?  That's good. 
*NOE:	 He said he didn't  bring the children because he thought that we were too old for them. 
*IAN:	 ((laugh)) I think we're, I'm too old for my  children, well the smallest one. 
*ENI:	  ((laugh)) How lovely. 
*IAN:	Harry is a   (.) a nightmare.  He's a real   
*ENI:	 Is he? 
*IAN:	handful. Yes. 
*ENI:	He's a handful is he? Oh dear. I'm just going to pour you a 
*IAN:	Right. 
*ENI:	I w  I was  letting it   
*IAN:	 Thank you. 
*ENI:	er brew a little bit just to   
*IAN:	 Yes that's  fine 
*ENI:	for you. 
*IAN:	You're looking very fit anyway. 
*ENI:	Oh that's kind of you. Well we keep busy don't we darling? 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ENI:	Ya. And erm   (.) we just love it here  of course  
*IAN:	 Mm. 
*ENI:	so we've got nothing to grumble about at all really. 
*NOE:	Ian was saying  how   
*IAN:	 Good. 
*NOE:	he's moving out of London t  to Weybridge or hoping to. 
*IAN:	Hoping to. 
*ENI:	You are? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Oh are you? 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	That'll be nice. 
*IAN:	I, I think so. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	It's not   (.) it's not out of choice entirely because er   (.) the business that I was has, has gone very very badly over the last eighteen months 
*ENI:	Do you mean that type of business or that particular firm? 
*IAN:	Both. 
*ENI:	Oh. 
*IAN:	Yeah. But the particular firm I was a director of went into receivership 
*ENI:	Oh dear. 
*IAN:	beginning of last year, it was about   
*ENI:	 Oh that's   (  )   
*IAN:	a year ago now and erm   (.) so er I mean fortunately it was bought er as a going concern 
*ENI:	Good. 
*IAN:	erm but everyone's financial position er suffered as a result. 
*ENI:	Yes. Mm. 
*IAN:	So I'm not as, on as good a contract. 
*ENI:	You're not? 
*IAN:	No. 
*ENI:	No. 
*IAN:	But them I'm lucky to have   (.) have a job really. 
*ENI:	Well   ((cough)) I mean these were the kind of jobs that weren't replaceable weren't they really? 
*IAN:	Well  (.)  
*ENI:	In a slump. 
*IAN:	yes that's it. I mean there's so little business around that erm 
*ENI:	That's right. 
*IAN:	so 
*ENI:	It was, it was   (.) somewhat a good thing that somebody was prepared to buy it. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	Now I'll pull this forward a bit erm   (.)  Ian   
*IAN:	 Sorry  is this your seat? 
*ENI:	and   (.) no it isn't, no no no, not at all. Now I'm going to leave those there 
*IAN:	Yes.  Alright   
*ENI:	 and you'll  just dive in  to those won't you? 
*IAN:	 Oh lovely thank you. 
*ENI:	That's the thing. I'm going to sit quite near to you because I can hear better when I do. 
*IAN:	Right. 
*ENI:	So. Erm so this means that the house   ((cough)) that you were so   (.) er happy with and have you continued to be happy with it? 
*IAN:	Yes. (  )   
*ENI:	 Erm  in er forgotten    (  )   
*IAN:	 In Chiswick. 
*ENI:	In Chiswick 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	that's right. Aha. So you've got to leave that now? 
*IAN:	Yes.  Yes. 
*ENI:	 Mm   
*IAN:	But  (.)  
*ENI:	Well this is  life when you're young. 
*IAN:	  (  ) i  i  it is  really. Yeah I mean we we're   (.) fatalistic about it, it's   (.) I, I think it is only a, a phase. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Things will change. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	I'm sure we've learnt er I've learnt er   (  ) business er   (.) er secures as a result of it 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	erm so   (.) positive about it. 
*ENI:	Yes. It's the only way to be really  isn't it? 
*IAN:	 Well yeah  yes. 
*ENI:	Have you got a house ready for you in erm Weybridge? 
*IAN:	Well we're buying it from an ol  elderly chap 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	erm he's been in it twenty years   (.) and er he's had it on the market for some time. It m  probably not as long as a year but it's quite a while 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	er and he's accepted our offer 
*ENI:	Good. 
*IAN:	but he doesn't seem actually willing to move out 
*ENI:	Oh  ((laugh))  
*IAN:	er which I can understand really. 
*ENI:	You, one gets very fond of  a house really. 
*IAN:	 I think he's  he's split up with his wife 
*ENI:	Oh. 
*IAN:	although he must be sixty odd erm   (.) and it's obviously a very difficult time for him. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Erm so he's keeping us in limbo really 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	which is a bit infuriating cos er Alison's due our third in    (.)   ((laugh))   
*ENI:	 My! 
*IAN:	 ((laughing)) at the end of June  
*ENI:	Oh. 
*IAN:	so er we have to be decided either way 
*ENI:	 (  ) yes. 
*IAN:	by then. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Oh we're quite happy to rent for a while. 
*ENI:	I was going to say that's the alternative  I suppose   
*IAN:	 Yes, yes   
*ENI:	to, yes. 
*IAN:	yes 
*ENI:	And you might even have to do this er for an interim period  or something   
*IAN:	 Yes   
*ENI:	until he  decides   
*NOE:	 Can you get   
*IAN:	yes. 
*NOE:	places to rent alright? 
*IAN:	Yes you can actually, yes. Yes. 
*ENI:	Mm yes, do help yourself Ian. Erm so   (.) where would he be meaning to go if he does  let you   
*IAN:	 He wants to  move down to a smaller house in Weybridge. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Er which we're told shouldn't be difficult to  find. 
*ENI:	 Er no  no. 
*IAN:	So erm, you know, hopefully that will be the case. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	But erm   (.) I don't think he er realizes how difficult it is 
*ENI:	No. 
*IAN:	to set up 
*ENI:	No. 
*IAN:	a move and that really he's quite fortunate to have a buyer   (.) somewhere within the price he wanted. 
*ENI:	Indeed. 
*IAN:	Cos we've all   (.) you know, we've all not got as much for our houses as we want 
*ENI:	No that's very true. That's true. 
*IAN:	 (  )  (.) 
*ENI:	Mm. Oh well let's hope that he will. I mean the thing is   (.) at the age of sixty he has no conception of what it's like to be your age at this period. 
*IAN:	Mm. Well, you know, he hasn't bought a hou  sold a house within the last ten years 
*ENI:	Mhm mm 
*IAN:	which we've done a number of times 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	and it's not a pleasant   (.) it's a very stressful  business. 
*ENI:	 I'm sure  I'm sure it is. I don't know how we escaped it so much but we have you see. Because we lived on the business, that was 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	er a foregone conclusion and we never   (.) sought to move from there until he retired did we? 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*NOE:	No. 
*ENI:	So one doesn't know er exactly what it's like  to do it. 
*IAN:	 No.  No. 
*ENI:	Mm. Gosh. And tell us about the children, how old are they? 
*IAN:	Harry is erm he'll be two in June 
*ENI:	Mhm. 
*IAN:	then Thomas will be four in August. 
*ENI:	Oh I see, so they're nice spaces. 
*IAN:	Yes there'll be two years between all of them. 
*ENI:	Yes.  Yes. 
*IAN:	 So  which Alison feels is erm   (.) er you know the right  sort of time   
*ENI:	 Ideal really. 
*IAN:	for her 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	which is obviously important. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	And erm they haven't had   (.) Thomas doesn't remember not having Harry around 
*ENI:	That's nice. 
*IAN:	whereas we've got friends who've got older children   (.) well a little bit there's, yeah, three or four years between 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	and they get er old enough to be er quite er happy that they're on   (.) you know,c  centre of attention 
*ENI:	Exactly. 
*IAN:	which er Thomas  hasn't. 
*ENI:	 It sours  the relationship a bit. 
*IAN:	Yeah it does a bit. 
*ENI:	Yes aha. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Ah well I   (.) I   (  ) is this going to be, if it's a boy is this going to be a Benjamin? 
*IAN:	I don't know actually.   (  ) could be. 
*ENI:	  ((laugh))   (  ) you've got two boys 
*IAN:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	 and so   
*NOE:	  (  )  the last of the tribe. 
*ENI:	Oh the last of the tribe. 
*NOE:	Yes. 
*IAN:	  (  )  
*ENI:	 Well I think  I think you know what I mean. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Erm that's what we did finally in desperation with Ben wasn't it? 
*IAN:	 ((laughing)) You decided to  
*ENI:	 ((laughing)) He was five, number five . Erm it would be nice to have a little girl then now  wouldn't it   
*IAN:	 Mm   
*ENI:	really? 
*IAN:	I'd, it's funny because I always wanted a girl 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	but now I, I wouldn't know, I don't feel   ((laughing)) I'd know what to do  
*ENI:	Mm well   (.)  this is just how Ruth was. 
*IAN:	 Yes   (  )   
*NOE:	  (  )  got no choice. 
*IAN:	Mm. No that's right. 
*ENI:	This is what Ruth er felt cos she had two boys 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	but erm and she thought I shan't know how to deal with a girl at all  
*IAN:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	which is a funny thing for a woman to think isn't it? 
*IAN:	Well Alison feels the same, yes   
*ENI:	 Does she? 
*IAN:	Yes, yes she does. Yeah. 
*ENI:	It is odd isn't it?  But   
*IAN:	 And then  she had 
*ENI:	Oh, oh she adores her, and of course she said it's wonderful, I don't have to keep struggling to get boys out of their trousers. 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	This of course is passing now because  the girl's   
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	four isn't she Noel? Four and  (.)  
*IAN:	Really?  Gosh

*IAN:	Oh do they? 
*ENI:	in Somerset.  Mm. 
*IAN:	 Yes.  Oh lovely. I don't know that area  but   
*ENI:	 And they  no   (.) they're very happy   (.) there  (  ) . So   (.) that's them.

*ENI:	Yes John is doing well, he's got three children too.

*IAN:	Well he's got three too. 
*ENI:	Nice kids. 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Mm yes nice kids. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	And of course Margaret's not erm inclined for marriage, she loves her job. 
*IAN:	No, yeah. 
*ENI:	And erm I think she'll be   (.) she'll, she'll probably stay single  unless   
*IAN:	 Mhm   
*ENI:	she meets some nice old man. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*IAN:	Wh  and where's Margaret working? (.)  
*ENI:	She's now at erm one of the girls public day school   (.) trust schools in Sydenham. 
*IAN:	Oh. 
*NOE:	Sydenham High School. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Sydenham High School   (.) For Girls. Her dream really is to be teaching at City of London School    (  )   
*IAN:	 Mm. 
*ENI:	And erm I'm ho  we're hoping that she might 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	get a job there. But she loves her work doesn't she Noel? 
*IAN:	  (  )  
*NOE:	 Very secure. 
*ENI:	And  she   
*NOE:	 And your mother seems  keeping quite well. 
*IAN:	Yes, yes she is. She had a bad er   (.) flu over Christmas 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*IAN:	when she was due to come   (.) and she's still got a very bad chest 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	Oh I'm sorry to hear that, oh. 
*IAN:	but er 
*ENI:	That's the bit that hangs on  always   
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	isn't it? Mm. Yes I saw her, I went up to I went to   (.) keep fit with her 
*IAN:	Oh you did? Good. 
*ENI:	and er 
*IAN:	Good. 
*ENI:	although I didn't last   (.) Tuesday, I did the Tuesday before and  she seemed   
*IAN:	 Mhm   
*ENI:	to be getting back on her feet alright. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Ah 
*IAN:	She says she's much better    (  )   
*ENI:	 Mm.  (  )  And what about Hamish? 
*IAN:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	Doing fine? 
*IAN:	Mm. Finding it quite difficult to get work but erm he was over at Christmas for a short time. 
*ENI:	Oh yes.  I don't think   
*IAN:	 And I saw him   
*ENI:	we saw him did we? No. 
*IAN:	Well he wasn't here very long 
*ENI:	No. 
*IAN:	but er they've got, they've se  set up their own teaching business 
*ENI:	Oh, have they? 
*IAN:	and again because of the recession over there le  learning English is, is one of the things that, you know, gets  put, put back on the   
*ENI:	 It's not a priority. 
*IAN:	 (  ) priority yes. 
*ENI:	Mm. Mm. 
*IAN:	So erm   (.) but they se  they seem to be working out okay. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	They've taken somebody else on so things  can't be that bad   
*ENI:	 Have they? 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	Oh good. Mhm. 
*IAN:	 (  ) er Alec is a re  another real handful. 
*ENI:	Is he? 
*IAN:	He's a year younger than Thomas but he was   (.) the same height 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	and er sort of wild curly hair  and   
*ENI:	 Oh  really? 
*IAN:	Yes.   (  ) real wild   
*ENI:	 Isn't that funny? 
*IAN:	but lovely, lovely boy yeah. 
*ENI:	Yes, yes but, but lively. 
*IAN:	Yes. Mm. Very  much so. 
*ENI:	 Is that  the only child they have  at the present time? 
*IAN:	 Yes. Yes. 
*ENI:	Mhm.  Mm. 
*IAN:	 Yeah. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	All they can cope with I think. 
*ENI:	And of course he'll be bilingual. 
*IAN:	Well he is. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	He's quite slow as a result, which is quite common apparently 
*ENI:	Is it? 
*IAN:	with er   (.) children who are brought up with both languages. 
*ENI:	Mm. Mm. 
*IAN:	Erm   (.) bec  they don't speak either very well to start off with. 
*ENI:	And how old is he did you say? 
*IAN:	He's two and a half    (  )   
*ENI:	 Oh well  it's early. It's such an advantage to them later on  I think. 
*IAN:	 Oh well a   absolutely  yes. 
*ENI:	 Mm. 
*IAN:	Er he   (.) because Toni, Hamish's wife 
*ENI:	Mm 
*IAN:	is half French   (.)  so   
*ENI:	 Is  she? 
*IAN:	I'm, I'm sure he'll her  pick up   
*ENI:	 Get  three. Trilingual. 
*IAN:	Yes. Cos they spend quite a lot of time, they spend their holidays in France. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	So I'm sure that confuses him even more at this stage. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	Course it does. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	Yes but in the end it does seem to work. I was always   (.) a bit doubtful about it 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	erm er you know, whether it could vu  confuse children or not but in fact it doesn't seem to with John's children  does it? 
*NOE:	 No  no.  His   
*ENI:	 They use   
*NOE:	his wife is German. 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Mhm. 
*ENI:	And they use both languages quite freely. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	In fact she gets rather   (.) uptight because erm   (.) during the year at school when they're speaking English most of the time 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	which is very natural, and so she ships them off to Germany to the relatives 
*IAN:	To put them straight. 
*ENI:	Aye    ((laugh))   
*GRO:	  ((laugh))  
*IAN:	That's quite right I think because it is a good, good thing. 
*ENI:	That's right.  Well it is. 
*IAN:	 I wo   I won't thanks. 
*ENI:	Will you have another one? 
*IAN:	No thank you. 
*ENI:	Well help yourself then if you want one. Mm.  (.)  But   
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	of course the, the, the slump is also, not the slump, the recession is also er operative in Italy is it? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	It's everywhere. Ian why do  people   
*NOE:	 It's  worldwide. 
*IAN:	Well 
*ENI:	make such a fuss about it erm I mean politically? 
*IAN:	Well, yes  well I suppose it's   
*ENI:	 Everybody's having to cope with it. 
*IAN:	coming up to an election time  and   
*ENI:	 Of course. 
*IAN:	everyone er 
*ENI:	They're bound to use it. 
*IAN:	bound to use anything they can 
*NOE:	Mm. 
*IAN:	er any angle they can get, get a grip of. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	But er   (.) yes, no it is   (.) th  I mean they had a lot of business from banks and areas like that    (  )   
*ENI:	 Yes. 
*IAN:	which of course have lost a lot of money in the last year or two. 
*ENI:	That's right of course. They have, they will be drawing back on most things. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	 ((cough)) But in fact   (.) they're the people aren't they who need bilingual people  on the staff? 
*IAN:	 Yes they are.  They're much, much better. I mean y  er   (.) you know, although they're in recession I, I think there's   (.) you know in this country 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	we we're owned now, our company, by a French agency group   (.) and erm   (.) none of our directors are, are learning French. 
*ENI:	Isn't it extraordinary. 
*IAN:	And yet you've got   (.) people who run restaurants, small businesses of that sort erm   (.) just general businessmen who want, you know, know they have to speak English. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	And they're just doing it as a matter of course over there. 
*NOE:	 Yes. 
*IAN:	 (  ) 
*ENI:	They all seem to have more drive than our people, what's the matter with us? (.)  
*IAN:	It's certainly in the, in that area, it's the cosmopolitan business 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	attitude er   (.) and also it's complacency because  we can   
*ENI:	 Yes. 
*IAN:	you can get away with it. You know all the  meetings   
*ENI:	 That's right. 
*IAN:	are held in English. 
*ENI:	Mm. Mm. 
*IAN:	And er the French speak very good English 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	erm so there's, there's not enough incentive there. 
*ENI:	No. 
*IAN:	And I have to say that er I don't. But I, I, I   (.) I ou  really I, I know I'll have to be thrown into the situation of having to do it 
*ENI:	You'd better get on with it  and do it now. 
*IAN:	 Yes. (  )   
*ENI:	But of course the beauty of it is you've done it at school haven't you? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	And once you've done it at school, it comes back with a bit of an effort  quite quickly. 
*IAN:	 Yeah I've got a reasonable  vocabulary 
*ENI:	Yes. Yes. 
*IAN:	but never really spoken it at all. I mean we never did any French trips. (  )   
*ENI:	 Didn't you? 
*IAN:	was useless for languages when I was there. 
*ENI:	Was it? 
*IAN:	Yes absolutely hopeless. We never did any   (.) trips of that nature at all actually. 
*ENI:	And what was the teaching system? Er had they   (.) by the time you were still at school   (.) come on to that new erm   (.) er system where you speak a lot more? 
*IAN:	No. 
*ENI:	No. You've done it out of grammar books? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	Yes.  I remember   
*ENI:	 Mm. 
*IAN:	it was, yeah vocabulary tests and that sort of thing  which   
*ENI:	 Mm.  Mm. 
*IAN:	you know er well it's er it's a middle ages approach to    (  )   
*ENI:	 Well actually  the one thing you can say about it is, it is a good grounding for what you now go on and do 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	because erm wherever you go now for   (.) refresher lessons, they will use the modern method. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	And that's, that will build on that foundation. 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	You'll be astonished how quickly  it'll come back. 
*IAN:	 Mm mm. 
*ENI:	You really will. 
*IAN:	Hopefully. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	Yes all we had when I was at school were l  l  yards of verbs and yards of nouns, we never knew how to put the two lots together. 
*IAN:	No. 
*NOE:	  ((laughing))  (  )  
*ENI:	 That's true. 
*NOE:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	The people who had the imagination or ability to do it where the ones that could speak the languages, the ones that didn't 
*NOE:	Yes  it was   
*IAN:	 made no  connection at all. 
*NOE:	Mm. Because I knew a lot of nouns and a lot of verbs, I could get by when I went to Algeria  in   
*IAN:	 Mm. 
*NOE:	nineteen forty   (.) but it was   (.) I envied those who could really speak. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	But erm   (.) if you see some officer floundering for   (.) the word for a cabbage or something of that sort I could provide the word and he provided the conversation. 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Yes. Well actually   (.) you're going to a centre aren't you er in   (.) where there will be evening classes and that sort of opportunity? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	I think  probably   
*IAN:	 It's, it's  it's well erm   (.) served  for   (  ) for   (  )   
*ENI:	 Mm I would imagine it's quite well led. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Ya. And you'll have no problem, yes. 
*IAN:	Mm. (  )   
*ENI:	  (  )  Aha. 
*IAN:	I'll have to give up my art classes then which is  (.)  
*ENI:	Art? 
*IAN:	 (  ) haven't been doing them recently but when I've been able to get a, er an evening away  that's what I   
*ENI:	 Mm mm. 
*IAN:	spend my time doing   (.) over the past few years. 
*ENI:	Yes but will it rule it out altogether do you think if you've  got to do the French? 
*IAN:	 Well A  Alison  goes out for one evening so that means I have to get back early for that evening 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	and then if I, I go out for another one, that means two evening evenings back 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	leaving the office at   (.) five thirty on the dot  and of course  
*ENI:	 Yes. 
*IAN:	I, I can't do that more than twice a week. 
*ENI:	 No.  No I see. Your work itself is going to take more time than that. 
*IAN:	Well yes. 
*ENI:	Is that just at first or is it   (.) regularly? 
*IAN:	No I mean it's, it's always been the case. 
*ENI:	Mm. Mm.  (.) Ya. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	It's tough really. It is tough. 
*IAN:	It's very erratic the work as well, it's it's   
*ENI:	 Yes, is it? 
*IAN:	very, you know, stop start    (  )   
*ENI:	 Yes.  Is it still advertising? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	You must be pretty good at that by now. 
*IAN:	Well I've got quite a lot of experience    (  ) I mean I've   
*ENI:	 Yes you have. 
*IAN:	I've done it since I was, well it's getting on for fifteen years now. 
*ENI:	It isn't? 
*IAN:	Yeah, thirteen years  in, in   
*ENI:	 Mm. 
*IAN:	the same area 
*ENI:	 Mm. 
*IAN:	  (  )  I've not really moved around a lot 
*ENI:	No. No. 
*IAN:	in the actual function. 
*ENI:	No. 
*IAN:	Just sort of progressed  up the ladder I suppose   
*ENI:	 Yes. 
*NOE:	Mhm. 
*IAN:	so, yes  (.)  
*ENI:	Yes. Oh well, you can only make the best of the thing you've got and that's the best thing to do rather than  
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	unless you're forced to switch er horses, you know in, in  mid stream. 
*IAN:	 Yeah.  Well i  i  I always say that er it always comes a surprise that I was good at anything. And I always think back to the er the time I think Edmund and I were sitting in the back garden here   (.) and deciding that we'd go off and join the paratroopers 
*NOE:	  ((laugh))  
*ENI:	 Really? 
*IAN:	 ((laughing)) because we weren't going to get  any O levels. 
*ENI:	Oh! 
*IAN:	And that was   ((laughing)) about all we were good for . 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) I'm  sorry. 
*NOE:	  (  )  
*ENI:	How funny.  But in fact you did get your O levels didn't you? 
*IAN:	 So I remember   (  ) well I got a handful   
*ENI:	Yes I  remember   
*IAN:	  (  )  
*ENI:	Mm. 
*NOE:	And Edmund got a B A. 
*IAN:	Yeah. 
*ENI:	Ah but wait a minute, not until after that was it? 
*IAN:	 (  ) yes. 
*ENI:	He got his O levels but that was it. 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Decided   (  ) he'd had enough and I suppose you had too. 
*IAN:	Mm well 
*ENI:	Did you stay on for As? 
*IAN:	Yes I did. 
*ENI:	Mm. 
*IAN:	But again I   (.) you know I always had the ability to er to know, to scrape by 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	or knowing what the minimum required was 
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*IAN:	and er pitching myself at just over that point I think. 
*ENI:	Yes. 
*IAN:	Which I suppose is some sort of   ((laughing)) ability     (  )   
*ENI:	 Well it's a  it's a, in a way that's quite true. 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	Yes it saves the er er the use of excess energy when you don't need to doesn't it? 
*IAN:	Yes. That's  right. 
*ENI:	 Ah.  Edmund was lucky because he got this chance to do   (.) a university you see  in   
*IAN:	 Mm. 
*ENI:	in er New Hampshire wasn't it? 
*IAN:	Yes. 
*ENI:	Erm  (.)  
*IAN:	Well that's when er Ben and I saw him, when he was doing it 
*ENI:	That's right, you did. 
*IAN:	doing that, yes. 
*ENI:	You did. 
*IAN:	Yeah. But I'd love to see him again. 
*ENI:	Oh yes. 
*IAN:	I'd love to get a trip out there. 
*ENI:	It would be wonderful  wouldn't it? 
*IAN:	 Yes. 
*ENI:	He'd so love to see people and of course at the moment 
*IAN:	Mm. 
*ENI:	he daren't make trips, or at least it wouldn't be wise to make  trips yet   
*IAN:	 I know, yes  I know    (  )   
*ENI:	 because he's waiting  for his 
*IAN:	Yes, naturalization.  Shame really. 
*ENI:	 Yes. That's   right. 
*NOE:	 Can I  pour you another cup of tea Ian? 
*IAN:	I'm fine actually, thank you. 
*ENI:	We've got photographs, recent ones, to show you anyway. 
*IAN:	Oh good. 
*ENI:	And we saw him in   (.) September October didn't we? 
*NOE:	Yes    (  ) yes   (  )   
*ENI:	 End of September beginning of October   
*IAN:	Good. 
*ENI:	and stayed
