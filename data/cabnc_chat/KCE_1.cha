*HEL:	 [laughing] Get a life  [] !

*HEL:	he reckons   (.) Pete's cheating on Susan, he's been really bad to Helena as well he's just using them and all 
*EMM:	Yeah.
*HEL:	this business.
*EMM:	But, in a way I mean like, I thought that as well, but then I thought   (.) well that's stupid that is because   (.) you weren't as   (.) as bad as Pete was were you?I mean, let's face it
*HEL:	I mean, who's taking advantage of him 
*EMM:	You were ta , you were taking advantage, not him!

*HEL:	so I dunno!
*EMM:	He said it to Andy though, and I mean   (.)

*HEL:	Oh got a nasty 
*EMM:	Ah 
*HEL:	bruise there! ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	Yeah, actually se , I sa , actually she said   (.) oh what, have you been walking into this time?
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	Hah, shut up!Shut up before I punch your face in!But like erm   (.) no one else saw it.But, I tell you what, it was so embarrassing!The, it was the Mo , the Monday after the Saturday got, the Saturday it was done, I had P E   (.) oh great!
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	So there's me like   (.) I'm sat in first lesson we have   (.) P E last lesson   (.) sat in the first lesson   (.) and I'm th , I've thought   (.) God my bra strap feels really lose! (.) So I'm right   (.) I thought   (.) oh my God! (.) There's a gap in between, they're not attached any more!
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	 [laughing] What would you do  [] ? (.)  (        ) . (.) I mean, like, okay it wasn't bad I mean   (.) let's face it and I'm not exactly flipping   (.) Dolly Parton am I? (        ) !
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	 [laughing]  (        ) exploding everywhere wouldn't she  [] !But like, I was thinking   (.) this is gonna be so embarrassing like in P E! [laughing] With ha half a bra on  [] !
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	 [laughing]  (        )  [] !
*HEL:	 [laughing]  (        )  (.) my cups down   (.) my cups down to my waist  [] !
*EMM:	I sa , I was sat there and   (.) and then we was in maths, like the lesson before and I was going Zena, I don't wanna do P E!I just do not want to do P E!And she's going, why not?You like P E, I don't wanna do it Zena   (.) will you write me a letter to get me out of it?She's going   (.) no I won't, you know, not unless you tell me what it i , why it is you don't wanna do it!So in the end I wro , I wrote her this letter because I couldn't say it out loud   [laughing] in case anyone else heard me!And say that I've busted my bra strap  [] !So she goes, oh don't worry about it.Like, we go into the loo and like, you can mend it.
*HEL:	Mm.
*EMM:	So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all, okay, I thought, cos like, some of them have got the loop actually on the, the like on the top of the cup haven't they?
*HEL:	Mm.
*EMM:	Did this one?No!The loop's attached to the end of the strap!It's a bit of the cup that's actually come apart, unsewn!So that meant I had to get   (.) the part of the, the top bit of the cup, thread it through the hoo , the hoop and then tie it in a knot!So like, you can imagine   (.) I had to have all the strap completely undone   (.) so like   (.) the, the buckle was like down here! ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	 ((laugh))  (.) And above the knot!
*HEL:	Comfortable then?
*EMM:	Well   (        ) it wasn't, it wasn't that bad but like   (.) it was really weird because like   (.) you could see like, people like, especially the lads, just sort of looking at you   (.) and then like   (.) not meaning to be pervy but just like, looking again as if to think   (.) why has Emma got a, a extraordinary lump   [laughing] on half the top of her boob, you know  [] !
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	 [laughing] It's like a lump there!They're thinking, mm, a shame  [] !But like, it was alright then because like   (.) means that you can changed up in this one corner of the changing room all the time   (.) and so   (.) I'd got my shirt on while I was putting my T-shirt on   (.) like   (.) for the reason that my bra strap was bust, not actually because I'd got a gigantic   [laughing] love bite around my neck  [] !
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	But like er
*HEL:	But I mean 
*EMM:	So that was alright really.
*HEL:	But, I couldn't believe it cos I   (.) he goes to me, what do you think of love bites?And I goes, I think they're horrible to be quite honest, I don't 
*EMM:	Yeah.
*HEL:	like them!
*EMM:	Same as me!I goes to Scott, I really really   [laughing] hate love bites    []  (.) and er   (.) and he goes, yeah and me.The only time he's ever had one was at this kid's party   (.) Fran , Franny someone, he's   [laughing] actually a bloke  [] !
*HEL:	 [laughing] Ooh that's   [] 
*EMM:	 [laughing] I said that's    []  (.) he went to this party and he he was like really hard and he was really drunk   (.) and he gave   (.) Scott, Noel and Ian   [laughing] a love bite   (.) like   (.) for a joke  [] !He just decided to do   (.) just for a laugh!
*HEL:	Oh, how sick! (.)  [laughing] Ah what a gay  [] !
*EMM:	I know like, anyway   (.) but like, Scott had gone home   (.) said to his mum   (.) like, is his mum isn't, going what's that on your neck?You know,woh what you been doing, sort of thing!And he's told her the whole story   (.) so Noel's gone home and his mum's gone, what's that on your neck?So Noel's gone   (.) oh   (.) someone tripped me up, I fell down the stairs and hit it on the coffee table, right!His mum believed him!So then his   (.) Scott's mum and Noel's mum met in town   ((laugh)) and they were just talking   (.) and Scott's mum   (.) it's dis , God it's disgusting isn't it   (.) that lad given all them little lads love bites!And er   (.) Noel's mum's going   (.) well what?I don't know what you mean!Noel said   [laughing] he'd hit it on the coffee table  [] !
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	 [laughing] Next day at school, Noel's come in and gone to Scott, you bastard!
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	Why do you have go and tell your mum the truth for  [] !
*HEL:	 ((laugh))  (.) I'd never tell my mum that! (.) Like, luckily they're 
*EMM:	Oh God!
*HEL:	no , not very big but I've still got the one, I've still got, and it's right next to it as well!
*EMM:	Mm.
*HEL:	Now it's yellow now it's going!
*EMM:	Yeah.
*HEL:	But, ah 
*EMM:	Ah gee
*HEL:	ah Jesus! ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	I think they're 
*HEL:	At least 
*EMM:	really disgusting!Cos like, Scott was going I've never gave anyone one, you know. (.) And er   (.) Hannah's going   (.) we started off the conversation where was the perviest you've ever had one   (.) I mean, knowing that I didn't have one, ever had one before   (.) and that was Mark , feeble attempt that lasted about ten minutes 
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	 [laughing] I think  [] !And I was really upset about that as you can imagine!But like erm   (.) what was I saying?Oh yeah   (.) so I was going what's the perviest place?I was thinking, you know, Scotts bound to have some pervy ones off Mandy  (        ) !But like er, and he was going oh I've never had one except for like, this Franny   [laughing] bloke! (        )  [] .
*HEL:	Girls don't do it to boys as much as boys do it to girls though do they?
*EMM:	No I know. (.) That is really sick though!
*HEL:	I certainly don't think so anyway.
*EMM:	I think that's really disgusting, they look silly!
*HEL:	I think it looks awful on boys!I mean, it looks bad enough on girls but I mean
*EMM:	I know, it looks really cheap doesn't it?
*HEL:	Yeah.
*EMM:	Sort of like   (.) eh eh eh eh eh!
*HEL:	But I didn't   (.) that's why it's 
*EMM:	I'm a big slag!

*EMM:	Ha!
*HEL:	I didn't tell anybody.
*EMM:	Yeah.
*HEL:	At school.
*EMM:	You didn't tell anyone like, except   (.) Joe then told Stuart, [laughing] Mr   [] !
*HEL:	Really funny! (.) But I ca , honestly when Pete phoned me up   (.) and like, I was getting so worried!And he's going 
*EMM:	Yeah but I swear you should have heard Pete   (.) mouthing off at Joe!
*HEL:	I know.
*EMM:	And because like, he didn't even know about the love bites!Cos Scott goes to him   (.) cos, we were talking about flipping   (.) biting other people's nipples   [laughing] or something  [] !
*HEL:	He did, he 
*EMM:	And 
*HEL:	he did actually bite me!

And you know er   (.) but she goes like, she's like, like she said to me, once you've done it once   (.) she'll expect you to do it again, and again!And like, it's alright say like, once   (.) every so often but like   (.) once or twice 
*HEL:	 (        )

*HEL:	You get, are you alright?Comfortable?
*EMM:	Yeah. (.) sh , he's really sort of like, dead brainy and goes to the child-minder and   (.) goes to school and whatever! (.) But like erm   (.) she said like, he's a really good kid. (.) Well 
*HEL:	Mm.
*EMM:	I mean   (.) well I thought to myself, God what a life! (.) I mean, I know it's not her fault   (.) but like, every Wednesday she has   (.) all the people from the college bridge   (        ) go to her house to play bridge. (.) I mean the kid's 
*HEL:	Poor kid!
*EMM:	just sat there on the sofa! (.) I mean, okay, he goes to bed about, what, eight o'clock or whatever? (.) But like, I mean   (.) God, do you know I'd really hate that!I mean, I used to hate it with like   (.) having   (.) flipping   (.) anyone come up to our house when I was little!
*HEL:	Yeah. (.) I remember, I remember once
*EMM:	Apparently his mum's hardly there! (.) Because   (.) the baby-sitter she's got at the moment right   (.) she said she doesn't mind doing   (.) Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays   (.) as well as the weekends   (.) but she doesn't wanna do every day   (.) each week. (.) Ma , how much does she go out? (.) I mean, God, the poor kid I feel really sorry for him!
*HEL:	 ((sigh)) Yeah! (.) I mean   (.) ooh!
*EMM:	That's why she's asked me to do it, but like I said to mum   (.) you know, I'm not gonna say to her, oh yeah I'll do it whenever you want, I'll say like   (.) they're gonna do this extra course on Wednesday nights   (.) and she said, like   (.) unless she could get a baby-sitter she couldn't go   (.) which is the reason I'm doing it. (.) So like
*HEL:	Just say you'll do it Wednesday night.
*EMM:	Yeah   (.) say I can do it Wednesday nights, apart from that, you know   (.) it's too bad sort of thing!So I think I'm gonna change my nights   (.) this, of staying in   (.) to either Mo , Monday and Wednesday or   (.) Tuesday and Wednesday   (.) something like that.I don't know really! (.) But like, like erm   (.) that'd be quite good because if I go to someone else 's house like, you don't wanna be sort of like, messing about with all, all the stuff, you haven't got anything to   (.) mess about with, do your hair or whatever can you?
*HEL:	No.
*EMM:	Mess around with your make up. (.) So I can get loads of homework done   (.) and erm   (.) like I can count that as one of my nights in.
*HEL:	Mm.
*EMM:	So that'll be quite useful I reckon really   (.) as well as getting a bit of money.
