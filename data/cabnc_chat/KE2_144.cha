@Comment:	conversation #144 (Tape 039708)
*TER:	It's just afternoon, what time is noon?
*LUC:	Twelve o'clock
*TER:	So that is just eighteen minutes after noon, so how long is it from nine, ten in the morning until, until eighteen minutes past twelve o'clock in midday?So how long is it 
*LUC:	Three hours and
*TER:	Right so Switzerland is three hours and eight minutes   (.) isn't it?
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	And you had two hours, fifty two minutes, right, so which is the next one, this one?Now that's five, ten P M to eleven thirty eight P M, well what's five ten, to eleven ten?
*LUC:	Erm   (.) six hours
*TER:	Six hours
*LUC:	and eighteen minutes
*TER:	and eighteen minutes, er wait a moment   (.) six hours and what?Ten, thirty eight
*LUC:	And twenty eight
*TER:	Right, so that is six hours and twenty eight minutes isn't it?
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	Right, now what's the next one?Two fourteen to ten twenty, er this again is easier because what would be two fourteen to ten fourteen? (.) 
*LUC:	Erm   (.) eight
*TER:	Eight hours, so fourteen to twenty would be how many?
*LUC:	Sixteen
*TER:	Right, so it's eight hours six minutes   (.) now the next one
*LUC:	Erm
*TER:	two fifty to ten twenty nine, well, come back to the same sort of time, the hour just before that, say two fifty to nine fifty, what would two fifty to nine fifty be? (.) 
*LUC:	Erm seven hours
*TER:	Right, now you've got to go from   (.) fifty to twenty nine
*LUC:	Erm
*TER:	so fifty to an hour would be
*LUC:	Thirty nine
*TER:	Right thirty nine minutes, so it's
*LUC:	Seven, eight hours
*TER:	No seven hours isn't it?
*LUC:	Seven hours 
*TER:	Two to nine, seven hours and thirty nine minutes isn't it?
*LUC:	Got thirty nine
*TER:	Right, now this next one   (.) ten A M to two thirty seven P M, well what's ten o'clock?
*LUC:	Four hours
*TER:	Four hours and?
*LUC:	Fifty seven
*TER:	Right and I think the next one you got right, because you worked it out alright, cos it's seven days, which is how many hours?
*LUC:	Five, three, erm   (.) seven times twenty four
*TER:	That's right, which is?
*LUC:	Erm a hundred times twenty four
*TER:	Well it's a hundred and sixty eight, seven times twenty four, but then you've got five hours to add onto it which makes it a hundred and seventy three, right, so now work out your average speeds.
*LUC:	Okay   (.) but I got some right, I got the actual question wrong on that one, just I, shall I do that one? (.) 
*TER:	Have you got the second one, didn't you get the second one, oh you got that one wrong?
*LUC:	Yes
*TER:	Right, so yes, do that one   (.) this is what this is Dublin to Cork? (.) 
*LUC:	Erm one hundred and ten, no one hundred and twenty
*TER:	Dublin to Cork, it's two hundred and sixty six
*LUC:	Oh I've done the wrong one   (.) a hundred and six, I've got that and you've marked it wrong  (.) 
*TER:	What did you divide by? (.) 
*LUC:	That
*TER:	What?
*LUC:	Two point five, eight
*TER:	What's two point five hours?
*LUC:	Erm   (.) a hundred and
*TER:	Well what's point five of an hour? (.) 
*LUC:	Six
*TER:	What, what fraction is point five? (.) Point five something, what fraction is that?
*LUC:	Point five?
*TER:	Yeah point five
*LUC:	Half
*TER:	Right, what's half an hour?
*LUC:	Thirty nine
*TER:	Right, so two point five is two hours, thirty minutes, but it's not two hours, thirty minutes, it's two hours
*LUC:	Fifty minutes
*TER:	Right, so what have you got to do?You've got to change the minutes to a decimal
*LUC:	Oh
*TER:	haven't you?
*LUC:	Eight, eight point eight, three
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	What did I say, point eight three? (.) Ninety four
*TER:	Right
*LUC:	erm  (.) 
*TER:	Right, now what's the next one?
*LUC:	erm Switzerland
*TER:	Switzerland, right
*LUC:	Eight   (.) there, nought, point, one, three
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	Did I say nought, point, eight, three?
*TER:	No
*LUC:	Nought, point, one, three
*TER:	Right
*LUC:	Nought, point, one, three
*TER:	but you're not gonna divide by nought, point, one, three are you?
*LUC:	No   (.) ninety one
*TER:	Right   (.) now what I shall do before you go any further is divide that at the side here, what those and minutes are as decimals of an hour  (.) 
*LUC:	Nought point four, seven, nought point four, seven
*TER:	What was it erm six hours twenty eight minutes was it?
*LUC:	Yes six point nought, what did I say?
*TER:	Yeah
*LUC:	Six point three, seven
*TER:	No, four, seven isn't it?
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	Nought point one   (.) six, five   (.) nought, point, four, two
*TER:	No, how long is it?
*LUC:	Twenty seven
*TER:	Is it twenty seven?
*LUC:	Yes
*TER:	Which one we dealing with?
*LUC:	Britain  (.) 
*TER:	Right, no it's not, look, it's ten o'clock to two thirty seven, what's that?How many minutes?
*LUC:	Thirty seven
*TER:	Right, so it's four hours, thirty seven minutes isn't it?We want thirty seven  (.) 
*LUC:	Nought point six, two
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	ninety eight
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	eighty six
*TER:	Eighty, you're not far out, but it's just erm
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Madrid to Barcelona 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	six, eight, seven  (.) 
*LUC:	Erm, eight six
*TER:	Right   (.) just don't do it again
*LUC:	 ((laugh)) Six
*TER:	Is this the seven hours, thirty nine minutes?
*LUC:	Yeah, six, eight, seven
*TER:	Seven hours
*LUC:	seven
*TER:	thirty nine minutes
*LUC:	Twenty six  (.) 
*TER:	five
*LUC:	Five, no I do it the wrong way
*TER:	Right, start again, eight hundred and, no it were doing
*LUC:	I'm doing Spain, that's what I'm doing anyway, oh I've got that one right  ((laugh)) 
*TER:	Right, so West Germany  (.) 
*LUC:	One hundred and six
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	One, three, seven
*TER:	Right   (.) right, what you didn't do almost all the time was to change those minutes to decimals of an hour wasn't it?So you must remember that whenever you're dealing with speed or anything to do with hours and minutes you've got to change your minutes to the decimals of an hour before you can use your calculator.
*LUC:	Okay.
*TER:	Now, just let's have a little help here, because you won't have this graph with you all the time   (.) will you?
*LUC:	No
*TER:	Right, so, how can you find out what forty minutes is?
*LUC:	Divide it by ten  (.) 
*TER:	No, what decimal fraction of an hour is forty minutes?How can you find out, you can use your calculator
*LUC:	Quarter, three quarters
*TER:	No, what's, what's a quarter of an hour?
*LUC:	Quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, fours into sixty, fifteen
*TER:	Right, so three quarters of an hour is?
*LUC:	Forty five
*TER:	Forty five minutes   (.) if you've got forty five minutes, what's, what's the fraction of an hour?
*LUC:	Over sixty
*TER:	Right, it's forty five over sixty, you want to change that into a decimal, what do you do?
*LUC:	Erm   (.) divide into
*TER:	No, how do you change any fraction into a decimal, now this is something you must 
*LUC:	Divide it by ten
*TER:	No, no, no, no   (.) you've got fractions here look, erm   (.) now how do you change all those fractions into decimal fractions, what do you do?
*LUC:	Nought point five
*TER:	But how did you do it?You knew that, but how do you do it?
*LUC:	Erm
*TER:	How do you do it on a calculator?What does that really mean one over two, how else could you write one over two?How else could you write it?
*LUC:	Two over four
*TER:	Yes, but I don't mean that, erm, could you, would you write it as one plus two or one minus two or one multiplied by two or one divided by two
*LUC:	One multiplied
*TER:	One multiplied by two?Two ones are two?Does a half equal two?So what does that, you know this, which of those four rules do you do for that? (.) 
*LUC:	One  (.) 
*TER:	What's one plus two?
*LUC:	Three
*TER:	What's one minus two?
*LUC:	Nothing, minus
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	one, minus two?
*LUC:	One, no, nothing  (.) 
*TER:	One, minus two
*LUC:	Minus two
*TER:	Minus, one, come down two, come down one you get to nought, come down another one 
*LUC:	Minus two 
*TER:	so one minus one, one minus two is?
*LUC:	Minus one
*TER:	Is minus one, what's one times two?
*LUC:	Er two
*TER:	What's one divided by two?
*LUC:	One
*TER:	If you've got one apple and you divide it
*LUC:	Half
*TER:	Right, one divided by two is a half, so which of those answers is that one?Right, so what does one, how else can you write one over two?
*LUC:	Erm one divide
*TER:	One divided by two, right, remember that, so how can I write that?
*LUC:	Forty five divided by six
*TER:	By?
*LUC:	Sixty
*TER:	Right, do that on your calculator  (.) 
*LUC:	Nought point seven five
*TER:	Right, so that equals nought point seven five, what's a half?Do it on the calculator
*LUC:	Nought point five
*TER:	Right   (.) what's three quarters divided er as a decimal?
*LUC:	Nought point five   (.) nought point eight, seven, five
*TER:	Right, so how do you change a fraction into a decimal?
*LUC:	You divide it by the bottom
*TER:	You divide the top number by the bottom number, so, supposing you've got fifty seven minutes and you want to change that into a decimal of an hour, what fraction of an hour is it?What's fifty seven minutes as a deci as a fraction of an hour?That's forty five minutes
*LUC:	Fifty seven over sixty
*TER:	Right, so how do you change that into a decimal? (.) 
*LUC:	Nought, point, nine, five
*TER:	Right, nought, point, nine, five, so now you can see how easily you can change your minutes into a decimal at any time, right, now, let's look at some of these, this is four hours and thirty 
*LUC:	Thirty 
*TER:	seven minutes, so it's four hours, four hours and thirty seven minutes, so what fraction is that of an hour?
*LUC:	Erm  (.) 
*TER:	Thirty seven minutes?
*LUC:	Forty
*TER:	Thirty seven minutes?
*LUC:	over sixty
*TER:	Right thirty seven over sixty, what's thirty seven over sixty?Cos the ans that is four and thirty seven sixtieths
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	so what's thirty seven sixtieths as a decimal? (.) 
*LUC:	Nought point six
*TER:	Right, so what's four hours, thirty seven minutes?
*LUC:	Four point six 
*TER:	Point six 
*LUC:	O
*TER:	Well six
*LUC:	One
*TER:	to the nearest two decimal places what's that gonna be?Nought, point, six 
*LUC:	Nought, point, six one
*TER:	to do decimal places?
*LUC:	Oh, two
*TER:	Right, because that's bigger than five isn't it?
*LUC:	Yes
*TER:	So it's nought, point, six, two, so for our thirty seven minutes it's, four point six, two, there we are look, but the thing is you can now do it without having to look at a scale
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	Right?
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	So do this one   (.) what is this?
*LUC:	Four
*TER:	Eight hours and four minutes
*LUC:	Four, six
*TER:	So, so what's that gonna be, eight hours and four minutes?
*LUC:	Nought point nought
*TER:	It's, it's eight hours
*LUC:	Yes
*TER:	so it's gonna be eight not nought isn't it?
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	It's gonna be eight point
*LUC:	Nought one
*TER:	Nought what?
*LUC:	One
*TER:	Nought one, what's that?
*LUC:	Mm, erm nought
*TER:	Nought, six, six, so it's gonna be to two decimal places it's gonna be
*LUC:	Nought point nought seven
*TER:	Right, so it's gonna be eight point
*LUC:	Nought seven
*TER:	eighty point, nought, seven   (.) right
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	So you now know how you can change your minutes to decimals 
*LUC:	To decimals 
*TER:	Right, now you may have to do that on this next one  (.) 
*LUC:	Tired
*TER:	I can see that  (.) 
*LUC:	Oh my brother does motor racing
*TER:	I know he does   (.) Have you heard from your brother?
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	How is he?
*LUC:	He's okay, he says the resorts are very good
*TER:	Does he and the snow good?
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	And has he been up to the top of the
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	I don't know I wasn't there when mummy
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	oh I see   (.) so what's today Thursday, he's only got today and tomorrow left hasn't he for skiing 
*LUC:	That's Silverstone 
*TER:	That's right
*LUC:	Yes I know where that is
*TER:	Do you?
*LUC:	Yes
*TER:	Have you been there?
*LUC:	No, my brother has
*TER:	Has he?
*LUC:	He might have I don't, he probably has
*TER:	Right   (.) so it shows a Silverstone motor racing circuit
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	Right, so what's the first
*LUC:	circuit has five corners and ten kerbs, car start
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	ha, car start near Woodcape Corner and go clockwise, which corner do they come from first?
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	aha   (.) Copse Corner
*TER:	Right Copse Corner   (.) what would you expect to find at Copse Corner?
*LUC:	Ten cops
*TER:	And what's a copse?
*LUC:	I don't know
*TER:	That's what I wanted to find out
*LUC:	 ((laugh)) 
*TER:	You don't know what copse is?
*LUC:	No
*TER:	A copse is a smallish group of trees
*LUC:	Is there lots of trees there?
*TER:	Well there would be, yes, I would imagine or if they certainly would, they would of been in the past, they may have been cut down, but that would indicate to me that there were probably trees 
*LUC:	Probably been cut down 
*TER:	at that corner, a group of trees
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	Copse Corner, copse er, is, is a name which we give to a small wood, a small group of trees is a copse, in India that can be called a shola, S H O L A
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	and at one stage when I was walking in India we used to stay at bungalows and one was called Marian Shola and another was called Pine Shola, because it meant that it was a, it was a bungalow in a group of pine trees
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	but copse is a small group of trees, right, so, the next one B
*LUC:	Which curve is just after Beckett? (.) Chapel kerb
*TER:	Chapel kerb  (.) 
*LUC:	Wonder who's got a Chapel there?
*TER:	I should think almost certainly there was a chapel at that point  (.) 
*LUC:	Famous people go there
*TER:	Oh they do indeed, yes
*LUC:	Mm, mm   (.) which corner is at the end of Hammer Street?Stow Corner
*TER:	That's right
*LUC:	Why is that called Stow?
*TER:	I wouldn't know that one  (.) 
*LUC:	Banker's got a nice track
*TER:	I hate to think what was in that corner too
*LUC:	Ugh
*TER:	 ((laugh)) Oh dear, right
*LUC:	Look, I have a magic pencil
*TER:	You have a magic pencil  (.) 
*LUC:	It moves
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	mm  (.) 
*LUC:	Car going from Woodcape to Copse who
*TER:	To Copse
*LUC:	Car will be travelling roughly from west to east or eastwards
*TER:	Yes, now remember that, what that means, west to east is in fact going eastwards
*LUC:	Yes  (.) 
*TER:	Where would it be travelling roughly southwards?
*LUC:	Where am I going from Woodcape southwards, that way
*TER:	Which is southwards?
*LUC:	Down
*TER:	Right, so where would the car be travelling in a southward direction?
*LUC:	There
*TER:	Right, so how would you describe that stretch, it's going from
*LUC:	Copse Corner to
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	right  (.) 
*LUC:	Oh   (.) there we go
*TER:	Right, so where would it be going, roughly going 
*LUC:	going northwards 
*TER:	Northwards
*LUC:	Going up
*TER:	So where would that be from?
*LUC:	There
*TER:	There to?
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	to Woodcape Corner
*TER:	Right  (.)
