*PS02G:	It 's that . 
*PS02H:	We go for a second hand suite as well or . 
*PS02G:	a microwave . 
*PS02H:	Go for a microwave or do you just go for . 
*PS02G:	We 've got nine hundred pounds approximately after the cooker and the fridge Five hundred pound for carpets leaves four hundred pound two hundred pound for suite and the microwave . 
*PS02H:	say there 's so many combinations that 's the thing is n't it . 
*PS02G:	Yep . 
*PS02H:	There are so many combinations of what to have what to get what we ca n't get what we need really I think is what we need is obviously going to be priority is n't it . 
*PS02G:	Yes . 
*PS02H:	Carpets cooker fridge . 
*PS02G:	Yeah . 
*PS02H:	they 're the definite needs and erm . 
*PS02G:	That was eleven hundred pounds .

*PS02H:	Decent . 
*PS02G:	A reasonable one I mean you can go up to two thousand for a good one but a reasonable one you would n't get nowadays under seven hundred and ninety nine . 
*PS02H:	I think you 'd be better off with a with a new cooker and fridge . 
*PS02G:	Oh yeah definitely I think . 
*PS02H:	you can go second hand .
