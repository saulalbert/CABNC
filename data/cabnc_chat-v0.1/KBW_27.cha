        As I wasn't watching first time round. •257121_257483•

*DAW:	I thought we were going on a bit. •257987_258061•
        Going . •258106_258121•
        We'll go a bit slower shall we? •258127_258281•
*DOR:	We'll go a little, trifle slower but rather than no it's not so much a trifle slower as  steadily. •258281_258669•
        If we're gonna set off fast then we carry on fast. •258688_259091•
*DAW:	Fast. •259091_259105•

*DAW:	Ooh lightly . •259530_259558•
*DOR:	lightly. •259644_259659•
        That means do not thump on the piano. •259697_259917•
        Right? •259917_259925•
        Butterfly, okay. •259930_260056•
*DAW:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	Just let me switch this thing off cos they don't want to hear our piano lesson do they? •260129_260638•
*DAW:	Oh no, I don't think so. •260638_260804•
