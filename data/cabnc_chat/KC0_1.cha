*ANN:	Yes.
*MOL:	do agree.
*ANN:	But the trouble is Noel, in the meantime   (.) erm   (.) the Quakers have fallen apart   (.) because the Quakers have filled themselves up with   (.) sort of barefooted raw carrot eaters with beads 
*MOL:	Well I know they have, yes I agree.
*ANN:	with the and haven't, but haven't ever read 
*MOL:	That's right.
*ANN:	the bible   (        ) 
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	sort of Eastern religion type, meditation and thing and it's no good at all!The old fashioned Quakers who were sikhs and everything.
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	Now, what I have learnt at college this week which is   (.) rather interesting I think.Well I think you'll be interested.Erm   (.) in the bible   (.) in the new part, the new testament, there's a   (.) er an epistle of James.
*NOE:	Yes.
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	Well   (        ) I am told that that is the earliest thing at all.
*NOE:	I'd say that.
*ANN:	That is his erm   (.) actually a brother of Jesus in his family 
*MOL:	Yes.
*ANN:	and so it's very much as he was thinking   (.) and it should be in the old testament really cos it was written   (.) you know, before Jesus
*NOE:	Mm.
*MOL:	That's right.
*NOE:	before the, before the crucifixion.Erm, and it's been quickly Christianized with just two little lectures at the beginning of two chapters to Christianize so it was popped in for new testament   (.) and it's the nearest we can get to   (.) to teaching.And of course, it's totally Jewish
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	but I'd say it's th it's th Je , the Jewish teaching as Christ would have preached it 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	you see and it's for   (.) all the family.And there's, towards the end of the   (.) first chapter   (.) there's a bit all about erm   (.) erm   (.) er temptation and deliver us from evil kind of thing which is obviously rather from the, from the Lord's Prayer and yet it's, rather explained rather nicely and it, it's a lovely, lovely book!It's only five   (        ) 
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*NOE:	Do you know, I haven't ever read it.I will do of course.
*MOL:	I've heard about that.
*ANN:	It's lovely!It really is lovely!And you really feel that 
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	here is a 
*MOL:	I shan't be able to walk home!
*NOE:	Really?
*ANN:	It seems to be 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	everything   (.) sort of, in a nutshell, you don't need any of the rest 
*MOL:	Oh well!
*ANN:	of the new 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	testament, that's just quite enough, it's just a   (.) just th the Jewish thing filled out slightly and and and a little bit less rules and, you know,i it's very, very lovely!
*MOL:	Well apparently Chelms 
*NOE:	I've never read it , but I shall.
*ANN:	We'll have a go, yes.
*MOL:	Well that's what Chelmsford's got you see, Chelmsford was was full of Quaker!I mean, I can, I can   (.) erm   (.) quote the Quaker the families who still live there.
*NOE:	Yes.
*MOL:	Oh, all the important people were Quaker families when I lived there   (.) you see?And the erm   (.) the .
*NOE:	The , I was gonna say them.
*MOL:	Oh the  were appalling!
*NOE:	Ah yeah, the  , the  and  I knew them.
*MOL:	Oh yes!
*NOE:	Yes.
*MOL:	and erm
*ANN:	What about the ?
*NOE:	They're still there apparently 
*ANN:	The  were
*MOL:	Oh yes, they're still there!
*ANN:	and the  were the Norfolk more weren't they?
*MOL:	Mm mm?
*ANN:	Were the  Norfolk more, were they?
*MOL:	I think they were.Yes, I I mean I can't remember   (.) they  and the  and  (        ) .
*NOE:	By the time   (        ) 
*MOL:	I can't remember now but they're at least five.I was thinking of them the other night, well they   (.) er, five at least erm       (.)  (.)  (        ) they were 
*NOE:	 (        ) 
*MOL:	th they were Quakers.
*NOE:	But er
*MOL:	,, (.) and something else, I can't remember them.
*NOE:	I di , I always think of the , I met one or two of those.
*MOL:	They're   (        ) 
*NOE:	A when I go through
*MOL:	Oh Mrs , (        ) 
*NOE:	off the train and   (        ) still standing there with her name on her side.
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah, that's right.
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*MOL:	Oh they're lovely people!
*NOE:	But er
*MOL:	They ran everything.
*NOE:	I'd been per wo ah   (.) I I feel that   (.) all this   (.) doctrine   (.) res religions are spoilt 
*ANN:	That's what I said!
*NOE:	by doctrine.
*ANN:	Exactly!
*MOL:	Oh no!
*ANN:	Nobody believes 
*MOL:	That's wrong!
*ANN:	any of it now!I mean I think 
*MOL:	No I know.
*ANN:	 (        )  (        ) 
*MOL:	I know.
*ANN:	Yeah, it's terribly sad!It's terribly sad!
*MOL:	I think it's  (        ) .
*ANN:	Even the Bishop of Durham, I've just recently bought one of his books   (.) and I rather wish I hadn't, I'm not liking it much   (.) erm   (.) he's still much too orthodox really.
*NOE:	Is he?
*ANN:	You know he's still hanging on to 
*MOL:	Oh he is  (        ) ?
*ANN:	and trying to 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	show 
*NOE:	Well I mean you can't   (.) you 
*MOL:	Mm.
*NOE:	you can't get fish   (        ) from   (.) prize thinking fish 
*ANN:	No.
*NOE:	can you?
*MOL:	No.
*ANN:	But I know they blamed him for that.And he says you can because he says it's important for it to be a living thing that's got to change with the time.
*NOE:	Mm.
*ANN:	In all that way he's quite correct 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	I think.It's just that he hasn't, to me, changed enough, he's still stuck up with all these   (.) various things.That really
*NOE:	Well I know   (.) let's face it, if he, if he was   (.) really convinced of the   (.) falsity of most it he 
*ANN:	Mm.
*NOE:	couldn't be a conscience to obtain his seat could he?
*ANN:	Well he reckons you can say it in a different way.You can say 
*NOE:	Mm.
*ANN:	it entirely symbolically and spiritually and and 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	things don't 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	have to have happened in fact.And that the stories were told to make a point and 
*MOL:	Mm.
*ANN:	the trouble is, people have lost the point and kept the story!Erm, you know, it's saying that
*NOE:	Well, the earliest man who   (.) used to think like this was Albert .
*ANN:	Yes, oh yes course it 
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ANN:	was!
*NOE:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	He wrote that marvellous book!
*MOL:	Oh 
*NOE:	Well 
*MOL:	a lovely book!
*NOE:	I've got about six of his books in there!
*MOL:	Well I had all of his books.

*MOL:	I know quite a few  (        ) .
*ANN:	The er
*NOE:	Christ, the Historic Jesus.

*NOE:	That is his best book 
*ANN:	chapter which is so lovely when 
*NOE:	Yeah.
*ANN:	he sort of says well you still can   (.) spiritually meet Jesus even though you know, it's a rather lovely 
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	the last chapter!I say, he moves him the more you   (.) search for him historically 
*NOE:	Yeah.
*ANN:	but there is a   (.) there's something hanging about still.But in a funny way, perhaps there is.I don't know.I'm very   (.) very, very, very, tied up with it, I I I invariably turn   (.) relatively happy with it all.
*NOE:	I don't think one has to worry too much.
*ANN:	Been brought up so much, bought up a Christian 
*MOL:	Yes, (        ) 
*ANN:	you just find it difficult to   (.) to admit that one's rather   (.) you know   (.) But certainly that epistle of James, to me, was just marvellous!Just everything!
*NOE:	I, I can't 
*ANN:	Mm.
*NOE:	ever remember reading James, If I had, I've forgotten about it.
*ANN:	Mm.
*NOE:	But I shall read him tonight.

*ANN:	and erm   (.) and I asked Margaret , they had a better view where she was

*ANN:	No.
*NOE:	we couldn't go anyhow.
*ANN:	No.It was very packed in there   (        ) but I couldn't see a lot of anything.
