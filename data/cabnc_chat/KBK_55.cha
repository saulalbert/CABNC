*CHR:	Yes, yes , that   (.) that's what it's for, isn't it.
*BIL:	Hm.Hm.
*CHR:	It looks as if you've got a spare   (        ) as well down there.

*CHR:	Yes that, I, I, have a feeling that the original   (        ) frame rotted.
*BIL:	Rotted.
*CHR:	There.
*BIL:	Oh.
*CHR:	I   (.) I   (.) I think it, it was not well maintained and rusted, rusted, and rusted and it was just impossible to do anything .
*BIL:	 (        )  (        ) .
*CHR:	Hm.
*BIL:	I like that where  (        ) .
*NOR:	 (        ) sun   (        ) the house.
*CHR:	Yeap, yeap.Oh, when the lads did this, they went to great trouble to actually find the right sort of windows and what have you .
*NOR:	 (        ) match   (        ) .
*CHR:	Had   (.) had the top been specially   (.) glazed ehm, ehm, what I mean, barred.
*BIL:	 (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	So that it looked as if it belonged to the house.

*CHR:	Oh, she can trim the dog with it. ((laugh)) .
*NOR:	 (        ) prune with spring, but, then, once   (        ) the flowering   (        ) that green one needs cutting back, but again it needs all the old wood taking out and the new wood in.
*CHR:	Yeap, that's down too William.
