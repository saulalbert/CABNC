@Comment:	conversation #194 (Tape 002902)
*CHR:	David is looking for somewhere to put his croquet club.
*NOR:	What do you mean by that?
*CHR:	Well he's got a croquet club without a ground.
*NOR:	Oh you mean a club?A number of people not a club stick?It's not called like a golf club that you hit the ball with?
*CHR:	Ah!Correct.He's looking for ground land.
*NOR:	 (        ) Not looking much of a hurry
*CHR:	What's that thing out there hydrants or something?
*NOR:	On which to play croquet?
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	He   (        ) occasionally he gets by the club.
*NOR:	Uncomfortable next to the Tigers.
*CHR:	 ((yawn)) Excuse me.
*NOR:	Erm.Yes he was he is the Secretary of Eden Park Croquet Club which was an offshoot of Eden Park Cricket Club.
*CHR:	Where is Eden Park?
*NOR:	It's between Beckenham and Croydon.And
*CHR:	They don't have anywhere to play?
*NOR:	at the moment they don't have anywhere to play.
*CHR:	What do you need for a croquet club?
*NOR:	Well you need ideally some space for about four or five tennis courts to run
*CHR:	Quite a lot
*NOR:	Well that would run you three lawns  (.) 
*CHR:	How big is a lawn?
*NOR:	which would be ideal.
*CHR:	As big as a tennis court?
*NOR:	I believe it's twenty four by sixteen ideally.
*CHR:	Is that bigger than a tennis court?
*NOR:	It's about the size of a double tennis court apparently.
*CHR:	Double tennis court?
*NOR:	Mhm.
*CHR:	Gosh!
*NOR:	With the surrounds.
*CHR:	 (        ) Presumably you can't use it for anything else because it needs to be very smooth and perfect.Is there cold air blowing in this car?
*NOR:	It's hot air blowing in.
*CHR:	I know   (        ) any air but something's blowing.You can erm   (.) you can't use it for anything else but croquet?
*NOR:	No.But then it's not a very big area.You know as you can't use a tennis court for anything else or bowling green for anything else.
*CHR:	No.But it does sound quite a big area to me if you haven't got the land in the first place.It would mean somebody's got to give up something.
*NOR:	You could fit it on a bowling green.
*CHR:	But then who wants to give up a bowling green?
*NOR:	Well I'm talking of space.The area you need.
*CHR:	You've got the area.That's fine but you haven't got any land at all.
*NOR:	Mm.
*CHR:	It's quite a lot of land to find.
*NOR:	Absolutely true.
*CHR:	It's not like somebody's back garden.
*NOR:	Yep.
*CHR:	So where were they playing today?
*NOR:	They went to Dulwich.
*CHR:	Is there a croquet club there?
*NOR:	Yes.Burbidge Road.Which is where Carlos used to live.
*CHR:	How many croquet clubs are there around here?
*NOR:	Very few.Sydenham is possible. (        ) ran an evening class affair.
*CHR:	Not one in Bromley?
*NOR:	No.There's nothing in Bromley.Apparently the Mayor last year or the Mayoress er was rather keen and organized a match between the Dulwich Club and her team nominally which turned out to be made up of masters from Dulwich College  ((laugh)) .Well apparently they have a lawn and they play it.
*CHR:	Well yes   (        ) people who play.
*NOR:	Oh you need people who know the game anyway.Then
*CHR:	Oh no.You need to know how to play.
*NOR:	Oh indeed you do.Mighty complicated it is too.
*CHR:	Well I was reading that article in the Sunday Times with you and the chap who's the champion said he liked it because it's like chess and bridge.
*NOR:	Mm.Mm.
*CHR:	A game of strategy.
*NOR:	Or I mean David was saying you can do this you can do that you can do the other you can do this.I I my mind was absolutely blown by the end.It it was almost impossible to erm  (.) 
*CHR:	If you were  (.) 
*NOR:	latch on to everything.
*CHR:	starting out out.Doing it from scratch.If somebody was used to teaching croquet they wouldn't tell you everything all at once.And you can gradually build up.
*NOR:	Well he was coaching me and he was very good.
*CHR:	Oh good.
*NOR:	Very good.I can understand why he has been invited to coach.Very good.
