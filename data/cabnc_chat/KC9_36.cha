*UNK:	I thought really done all  haven't done all that much, cos I was alone most of the time •164852_174212•
*KEI:	Mm, mm. •174342_174462•
*GIN:	The  make you, sort of what were doing when  making  another member of staff, so there's a  going on full time   having free coffee like Dinda did, much  change it to be , but I mean it's just there for free, all day every day, she's now  ten penny piece in, they get a card, get a little pin pricked on, every time they used it up to twenty they get twenty cups of coffee on its card •174532_220632•
*KEI:	. •_•
*GIN:	no, they loose it so of course they have to go and buy another card . •221942_225362•
        Every time I do the laundry I bet there's a coffee machine card in there, shirt pocket, there's two there this morning. •227262_235302•
*KEI:	Oh I guess that, that means that's all right when it, did you   coffee machine . •235302_246692•
*GIN:	seventeen thousand pounds if he gave them a free cup of coffee. •249822_255872•
*KEI:	Well he, he, he  given them a free cup of coffee it'll be alright, but he didn't, he gave, the machine took ten P pieces so he provided them with the ten P pieces to put in and then when it was full up he'd empty it out and give them all ten P pieces back •255872_272902•
*GIN:	So he was given them coffee. •273142_274252•
*KEI:	So he was, for it was, it was a perk, or something like that,I, I couldn't really understand what they, they were getting at . •274872_281982•
*GIN:	I couldn't understand it either. •281982_283112•
*KEI:	I thought that was absolutely . •283112_284602•
*GIN:	To charge him I mean, somebody gets a company car •285182_288112•
*KEI:	Mm. •288362_288602•
*GIN:	the tax man charges him, who is, who's got the use of the company car •288872_292162•
*KEI:	Yes, yes. •292162_292502•
*GIN:	doesn't charge the boss •292502_293332•
*KEI:	No, that's right, mm. •293372_293882•
*GIN:	Well I think  expenses I'd should imagine that's written off against it. •295122_298012•
*KEI:	Well he, he said if they, if, if, some, get a visitor in and I give them a cup of coffee well that's all right, but  I don't know if it's money or, or like maybe, maybe . •298772_310342•
*GIN:	But it seems to me  it's the person, people drinking the coffee who are getting the perk, therefore they should have twenty pounds a year added for  free coffee providers •310902_323632•
*KEI:	Mm. •323812_324022•
*GIN:	worth twenty pounds a year or whatever it is worth  •324022_326052•
*KEI:	Well he  he was saying that, that the boss was the one that provided the money that the chap was . •326052_331712•
*GIN:	So he, that was definite, yeah. •332812_334672•
*KEI:	If he was given them tokens or something like that, it would of been alright, but I, I, I  a couple of weeks ago  •334672_339722•
*GIN:	Perhaps now they're not doing it then . •339722_340952•
*KEI:	I've forgotten the details on it . •340952_341972•
*GIN:	Well imagine what Panasonic are going to own •341972_343682•
*KEI:	Yeah. •343932_344032•
*GIN:	giving out those great big blocks of , all getting as much as . •344202_349082•
*KEI:	Well, this, this is  a lot of people, of er to erm . •349482_357022•
*GIN:	Oh I . •359322_359402•
*VIC:	he, he was sort of on loan to another company •360352_364482•
*GIN:	Mm. •364652_364822•
*KEI:	and they say  film industry department, Wakefield somewhere got John's name out of the blue, so that, don't know anything else about it because he's, he's always been seen by you know , this, this other company, and he got three tax  eighty seven, eighty eight, eighty eight, eighty nine, ninety, and one what, were the estimate was twenty five thousand pounds, and five thousand pounds •365402_398022•
*GIN:	Yes , and he hadn't even earned that had he? •398502_400202•
*KEI:	not a chance, he, he never even earned that much money in all his  , no but I mean having, having had the income tax done that to you  however ridiculous that it is you've got to do something about it •400302_412102•
*GIN:	, yeah •412132_412252•
*KEI:	and having been sort of helping  •412592_414202•
*GIN:	. •_•
*KEI:	The  finally he decided what  he had to right back to say, you know, I, I, tell you this is how much I've earned •418582_433232•
*GIN:	Yeah •433262_433322•
*KEI:	this is how much tax I've paid, this is, I mean if you go on the dole too unless you've made a note of it there is no record of how much you've been paid on the dole, they, they give John the what he calls a giro, takes it to the bank and cashes it and there is no, no record of  and when he's been on the dole. •433322_452002•
        I mean he's got plenty of  every single bit of papers that they're given all the time. •452462_456482•
*GIN:	Yeah , but the D S S must have it,. •456522_458322•
*KEI:	Well I, I don't know how keen they are on giving them out, just . •459492_463202•
*GIN:	. •_•
*KEI:	Actually it was lucky for us because when John rang up  the •466772_471152•
*GIN:	For his firm. •472292_472922•
*KEI:	for his firm, erm, he said  I'll, I will see to it, which she's doing at the moment but , but erm, I don't know how far •473092_490972•
*GIN:	At least it's got an end now with the others if he's on the film company, he's got an end now hasn't he now he's got  . •491272_497382•
*KEI:	Yes I suppose so, but I feel sorry for Simon cos you see John and Geoff they can both go on the dole but Simon's is . •497412_503472•
        The  or, or anything so at the moment . •505492_510832•
*GIN:	. •_•
*KEI:	Any way the thing is erm, I hope  only have a   •516142_526292•
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*KEI:	What he's, he's earns, er pay tax on everything he's earned •526662_529432•
*GIN:	Yeah •529432_529602•
*KEI:	never had a  not for all the things   •529642_532472•
*GIN:	No, no  •533002_533652•
*KEI:	and er, he's been on the dole admittedly he did go on the dole  If you're on the dole for part of the year, your own salary is  do they add your dole money to the salary, charge you tax on that , •533652_546302•
*GIN:	Oh yes, oh not half  •546302_546872•
*KEI:	you see so I think, •546872_547772•
*GIN:	not half  •547942_548332•
*KEI:	I said to Paddy I think that they do that John will owe, owe them some money cos he'll owe them tax from all the doles . •548332_554372•
*GIN:	he can't tell them how much it is? •555192_557332•
*KEI:	Because er, I don't know whether •557432_558542•
*GIN:	Oh well that  signature for it every time and it goes on his file every one has a file . •558712_566482•
*KEI:	Well I hope so , because he's been when he went  •566812_570012•
*GIN:	Huh. •571712_571812•
        He didn't get very much . •571942_572902•
*KEI:	So I, I don't think it's finished yet somehow, he don't seemed worried about it   •574182_577932•
*GIN:	It seems that they chase somebody like John who, at the outside may end up after five years owing them perhaps a hundred to two hundred pounds •581782_592552•
*KEI:	Mm. •592552_592782•
*GIN:	and yet people like the Maxwell board •593242_595702•
*KEI:	Yeah, yeah. •595702_596612•
*GIN:	millions involved and other people who are running dodgy companies •597162_602042•
*KEI:	Yeah. •602042_602152•
*GIN:	going bankrupt and then starting up another company in another name •602212_605542•
*KEI:	Mm, mm •605832_605972•
*GIN:	which I don't think should be allowed, go right themselves off and leave lots of people that they owe money to and can't get it, they get threatened  •605972_612952•
*KEI:	That's right and then they go and start again  •612952_614702•
*GIN:	in the  or something, it's  some of them are  all over again, start them off of course. •614812_620122•
