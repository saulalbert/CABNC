@Comment:	conversation #5 (Tape 033702)
*SUS:	a lot of myths surrounding Down's Syndrome children as to what they can and can't do you see  and er  •174697_175477•
*CAR:	Well it's good to see them in the bath anyway having a good  good old splash about, you know? •175487_175931•
*SUS:	Yeah. •175944_175975•
        She said she hasn't, I said do you bring her every week? •175990_176209•
        She said no she said we haven't been for ages. •176209_176386•
*CAR:	That's what she said to me. •176402_176495•
*SUS:	Cos I said I'm really surprised, I said I thought you must come at least every week cos she seems to be so confident in the water. •176512_176991•
*CAR:	She said she hadn't been for a while  and erm  then she said  they didn't really know, they wondered how she was gonna get on in the water. •177000_177877•
*SUS:	Ah no she's fine. •178011_178125•
        Yeah cos they're not supposed to, you see there again, Down's Syndrome children are not supposed to be able to float. •178343_178848•
        Well she was doing a •178848_178971•
*CAR:	Well she had some floats on I know but •178971_179182•
*SUS:	Well she's only a tot isn't she? •179182_179326•
*CAR:	Mhm. •179367_179395•
*SUS:	No I thought, cos I, I remember reading erm  I think it's her father who owns one of the bookshops in Woodbridge and he had this book on display, you know he sort of erm  advertised it if you like  and it's, it's properly published and everything but he had it as a  a book available in his store and there was an advert in the Anglian about it, and I remember reading that she said  er that he said er cos it was his daughter who had the child, that it totally knocked them for six. •179450_182772•
        They never dreamt that it could happen cos she wasn't in  the risk age group or anything, it just never crossed their minds that it might happen and they were totally  well they just didn't know what to think. •182792_184194•
*CAR:	Was there any explanation of it? •184360_184486•
*SUS:	Really shocked. •184486_184558•
        No. •184589_184595•
        And she's she's gone on to have a, a normal little boy you see? •184595_184873•
        Just a fluke of nature. •184976_185106•
*CAR:	Ah. •185145_185164•
*SUS:	She's, she's younger than me. •185516_185652•
        She's, she's in her twenties and theoretically the, the risk is  •185673_186060•
*CAR:	She she looks older. •186060_186101•
*SUS:	Yeah but she's not, she's in her twenties and theoretically  •186169_186403•
*CAR:	She looked about mid thirties I thought. •186403_186543•
*SUS:	No she's not. •186543_186598•
        Not as old as that. •186651_186746•
        I think she was  •186884_186972•
*UNK:	Oh look mummy   •186972_187014•
*SUS:	ah there's the pygmies. •187113_187215•
        They've got  see they've got their tether. •187217_187405•
*UNK:	Mummy   •187405_187419•
*SUS:	Yes yeah. •187632_187819•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	And er  the fact that she's obviously gone on without  it was awful, when she was pregnant  the second time round  she didn't make a big thing of being pregnant but you could tell she was pregnant but I never quite liked to say to her just in case they had the whatever it is and decided not to go  •187869_189675•
*CAR:	Aye they would have done won't they? •189688_189810•
*SUS:	ahead you'd, yeah but you can't have that till sixteen weeks  and by then you you know  you show don't you? •189816_190394•
        Anyway  she's had a little boy and he's fine, he's got a cold that's why he wasn't in today. •190499_191320•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	That was mum and dad wasn't it? •191328_191432•
        Yeah. •191432_191462•
*SUS:	Sorry? •191538_191563•
*CAR:	It was dad who was outside? •191563_191734•
*SUS:	Yeah dad dad had got the baby outside, yes. •191734_192024•
        I don't know him at all, I've never met him. •192024_192149•
        But I used to •192286_192338•
*CAR:	So where do they live then? •192338_192411•
*SUS:	Well I they live in the catchment area for Fram because she used to go the  •192508_192824•
*CAR:	Mhm. •193101_193124•
*SUS:	and I think she I think her little daughter goes to the Rainbow thing    Kate doing her largesse, you know  let the heathens in   •193148_194074•
*CAR:	She didn't know who I was obviously? •194087_194206•
*SUS:	No, no. •194221_194306•
        No I don't go round saying who you are. •194346_194531•
*CAR:	No. •194531_194539•
*SUS:	It's nice  it's a rare  •194626_194765•
*CAR:	Right. •194807_194817•
*SUS:	a breath of fresh  air  if you like  when people don't know. •194840_195439•
        I tell you who else was there erm the lady who used to do caretaking for you at school you know, who had a little girl  months before Becca was born. •195458_196278•
*CAR:	Mrs ? •196338_196353•

*CAR:	the other lady. •196726_196787•
*SUS:	the lady with black hair. •196787_196933•
*CAR:	The one whose baby kept on being very very quiet and never  •196933_197201•
*SUS:	that's why  she's still quiet and she's still tiny. •197204_197454•
        She looks nowhere near as old as Rebecca and she's a month older. •197484_197779•
*CAR:	I never saw her. •197826_197934•
*SUS:	No no she'd got out the pool you see, she was  I didn't recognize her, she said oh it looks like all the family's here and I was only talking to Evelyn  and, and I kept trying to place her and it was only when she said oh Rebecca was born a month after cos she's  died her hair a different colour , I didn't, just didn't recognize her at all. •197956_199443•
        But erm yeah  can't remember what she called her little girl, Michelle I think or Michaela   name anyway. •199639_200604•
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	But  well Evelyn was asking me about reading and writing but  first of all she asked did we still go to  you see and I said  no  I we I said we decided it didn't suit him. •200696_201896•
        Oh she said  why was that? •202044_202235•
        I said well we had  I said I had a bit of a run in with the lady who ran it, I didn't agree that he should be compelled to do singing which she thought he should I said and we had a   decided it cos he . •202235_203496•
        Oh she said it's silly making him do that I said er very quickly I said, I said don't get me wrong I said for kids who enjoy going to that sort of thing it's great  and fine if it's alright   •203678_204637•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	but I don't want anybody accusing me of  er •205056_205384•
*CAR:	Right. •205384_205423•
*SUS:	causing bad feeling or trying to upset her trade, I mean we know she's rubbish but  erm I, I said er I just said well  the children who enjoy it  enjoy it I said but he never really settled and er we felt that between us we'd got over twenty years' experience of working with children, we reckoned we knew a little bit more  about what makes children tick. •205521_207916•
        And er  she agreed. •207916_208032•
*CAR:	Yeah, it's fair enough Sue. •208174_208273•
*SUS:	Yeah. •208285_208294•

*CAR:	Know it all. •209098_209212•
*SUS:	Well no not so much that but, but I'm not, I'm not sure that other lady, the one whose baby was born just after er before Becky you see and I thought  could just imagine her being saying  going and saying something and getting, it getting  moulded a different way, you know? •209212_210726•
        And then I thought oh bugger it, I'm entitled to my opinion and I made the point that   •210726_211233•
*CAR:	Yeah and you have done on more than one occasion  •211233_211397•

        So what did she say? •211647_211713•
*SUS:	And she said she said well her little boy, Christopher, loves it but he's a quiet child you see  he thrives on that kind of thing. •211713_212321•
        And she, he was always quiet when we were at the erm  twos to threes. •212326_212840•
        And er  and she said he enjoys it and he goes to playgroup  I think he must go to Dennington playgroup cos he's going to Dennington school, and he enjoys sitting down and being, likes looking at books and he's started writing and she said  actually she said I'm really panicking because I'm frightened that I might be teaching him wrong and  that I'm  I said well why don't you pop in and have a word at the school? •212985_215222•
