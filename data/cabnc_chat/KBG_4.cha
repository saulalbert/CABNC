*CAR:	Not much. •684542_685272•
*SUS:	wouldn't be a lot different would it? •685342_687842•
        I don't know how erm   •687842_688242•
*CAR:	No the only parent  I knew  •702432_706592•
*SUS:	Georgie . •708312_708472•

*CAR:	He's still there I think. •728412_729592•
*SUS:	Is he? •729592_729872•
        Oh well she's obviously decided she likes it. •729922_732352•

*CAR:	Yeah. •736532_736752•
*SUS:	Probably a bit nearer the mark. •749932_750692•
        I think that's one of the drawbacks though to a village school. •750692_752302•
        Er it can be very nice, very cosy, but I  •752302_753922•
*CAR:	See that also epitomizes what I was saying before, you know I mean if I'm there you could be stuck there for the remainder. •753922_759132•
*SUS:	teaching. •760072_760242•
*CAR:	Oh yeah. •760512_761272•
        And there's always the danger of it  could it be changed, and then  you've got the whole curriculum area to look after. •761642_767032•
        Instead of having three to look after I'd probably end up having to look after a seven or eight. •767472_770212•
*SUS:	Yeah. •771972_772072•
        But you see I, I don't know  I can see what you mean, but I don't know whether a move would be the answer cos I think you're  if you're gonna stay in teaching this is what's gonna happen. •772802_785922•
*CAR:	I mean it's, there must be a time when it settles. •786172_788102•
*SUS:	wherever you go  wherever you go there's gonna be all this upheaval and  I mean let's face it if the Tories don't get in this time, and pray god they don't, Labour's gonna completely  •788992_796652•

*SUS:	which is the er it's gonna be bad whoever's in charge really. •807112_809732•
*CAR:	the Scottish Nationals. •812202_814232•
*SUS:	At least from the point of  with Labour at least they  most of them  send their kids through the state system so they've got a little more idea of what they're talking about. •815292_823542•
        But that still boils down to the fact that everybody thinks they know how schools work  cos they've been at school themselves. •828402_836852•
        I get really fed up with the whole  •838202_842022•
