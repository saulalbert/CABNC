        That's why people won't vote er a lot of people won't vote for them. •151842_155062•
        Cos they're considered a wasted vote aren't they? •155202_157042•
        But erm  you're voting for a party not for a character. •157042_162262•

*NIN:	Mm  I can't understand why people want to be in politics. •280802_285692•
*CLA:	Power. •286252_286602•
        Mm. •291432_291522•

*NIN:	Erm  •321832_322022•

*NIN:	It wasn't an accountant was it? •324692_329482•
*CLA:	No no no. •330302_330832•
        It was something to do with growing things. •330832_332092•
        That sort of came over quite strongly. •332452_334082•
*NIN:	Oh no that was his second choice. •334312_335872•

*NIN:	He never forgets a thing does he? •379012_380402•
*CLA:	No. •380882_381142•
        Steve doesn't. •381142_383052•

*CLA:	Mm. •395222_395592•
        Mm. •395702_395732•
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Oh he's a very bright little boy but •395732_399432•

*CLA:	You can't really relax with him can you? •404902_406772•

        It's a shame isn't it? •410602_411972•
*CLA:	Mm and they shouldn't be  can't, rather it can't be down to lack of  contact I wouldn't have thought. •411972_421482•
*NIN:	No. •421572_421772•
*CLA:	In part I suppose it's due to  erm  complete contrast of lifestyle between Jill and Steve's way and our way. •422062_431142•
        Could be. •431142_442752•
        She was just like an automated  programmed doll, oh god. •442752_447882•
        Poor kids can't help it of course but  •447882_450452•
*NIN:	No she's such a nice little thing   •450582_452212•
*CLA:	Oh she's a nice little kid, yeah. •452212_455012•
        Pathetic really to see her waving like that. •455012_458062•
*NIN:	I always want to cuddle her. •458112_459412•
*NIN:	Press the wave switch now, plonk you know. •459432_461532•
*CLA:	Aah! •461532_461592•
*CLA:	Mm. •461592_461622•
        Oh well. •462112_466282•
        She may change quite a lot, on the surface anyway. •466282_468072•
*NIN:	Oh she has done already hasn't she? •468072_469502•
        She's better than she was. •469512_470242•
*CLA:	Oh indeed yes. •470242_471102•
        Yes. •471102_471302•
        Certainly has. •471302_472492•
        Mm. •472492_472522•
        I mean it's most unnatural for a child not to be  chatting away in the presence of grandparents isn't it? •472842_486822•
        Unless the grandparents are a couple of weirdies . •486922_488212•
        Perhaps she thinks we're two weird, no I'm weird anyway. •488212_495672•
        Could be right. •495672_496242•
*NIN:	 (        )  ((laugh))  (        ) 
*CLA:	Could be right. •496342_497462•
        Yeah. •497462_497572•
        Yeah. •497572_497642•
        It's not a bad evening now is it? •497652_505832•
*NIN:	No. •505832_506042•
        Have you seen a weather forecast for ? •506042_510612•
*CLA:	No. •513812_513952•
        very brief  this morning I think. •513952_514962•
        We were due for better weather today which we've had. •514962_518172•
        And then I think more rain tonight . •518262_524592•
        But as the girl in the  post office said erm  it's usually different here than the weather forecast which is probably is, the gulf stream •524592_•
