*PS0V5:	I must admit I like to see that because so many people if a dog had to lose a leg they 'd say put it to sleep put it to sleep . 
*PS0V4:	Mm Yeah . 
*PS0V5:	And why If you lost a leg they 'd stick a false one on you or give you a set of wheels . 
*PS0V4:	Mm Right . 
*PS0V5:	So why kill it why kill a dog because it 's gon na lose a leg . 
*PS0V4:	Mm . 
*PS0V5:	It 's got well you 've only got two You lose yours one of yours and it 's a disaster . 
*PS0V4:	Mm . 
*PS0V5:	If a dog loses one well it 's still got three to get on with you know . 
*PS0V6:	Yeah . 
*PS0V5:	It 's hardly a handicap at all to a dog . 
*PS0V6:	It 's happened to one dog and he learned to walk like a human . 
*PS0V5:	Mm . 
*PS0V6:	He walked like a human And he spun right round and he like that And they said get up And he rolls over and then he sort of put his legs up I ca n't remember no he sort of I ca n't do it . 
*PS0V5:	But to lose a leg for a dog is hardly a handicap at all . 
*PS0V4:	Mm . 
*PS0V6:	Cos they 've got three others They just lose their balance occasionally . 
*PS0V5:	Well that 's why a dog that limps slightly very often there 's practically nothing wrong with it . 
*PS0V4:	Yeah . 
*PS0V5:	If it thinks it 's gon na hurt it will limp . 
*PS0V4:	Yeah . 
*PS0V6:	0 . 
*PS0V5:	Whereas people if you 've got a painful leg you 've got to walk on it Whereas a dog might have a slightly painful leg and it will limp like hell . 
*PS0V4:	Mm Yeah . 
*PS0V5:	Cos it does n't have to use it . 
*PS0V6:	Oh no we 've got some really hard numbers french if I had a dictionary I could look it up but I have n't .
