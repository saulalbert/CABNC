*EMM:	Did you like your ride on the   (.) thing? 
*CAR:	Yes I did. Did you? 
*EMM:	I wish they'd have gone a bit faster. Is that how fast they goes? 
*CAR:	Mm. They don't go any faster than that. So   (.) are you sitting in the front or at the back? 
*EMM:	Erm, sit in the back. 
*CAR:	Right, I'll sit in the front then. 
*EMM:	Ooh! 
*CAR:	I'll lock these gates as well. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*CAR:	I know!  ((laugh))  (14.0)  ((car starting)) (.)  ((sighing)) Ah ! Right are we all ready then? 
*CHR:	 (  ) 
*CAR:	It's not shut.
