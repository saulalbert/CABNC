*DAV:	It sounds good
*FRE:	But if Lisa er   (.) would be plain and have a chat, put your
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	I think it might be a good id , I don't know whether, Lisa would like it better if you would let her know and let her get Kev talking on it, which perhaps be a better idea if she was in on it, but I'll, I'll have a word with her
*FRE:	Yeah, have a word with her and perhaps she'll like to listen to that to the er words sort of that, and then make her own comments, it's nice to get the opinions you know, the, the many of the family as you can
*DAV:	Really, I'm the sort
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	and er, it helps me to, it's only a hobby, you know, but er, it's one that I've had for donkey years, I want to er keep going with it as long as I can

*FRE:	He did it on the guitar and you were simply found a few words and
*DAV:	yeah   (.) yeah it's true
*FRE:	it was a long time ago but as I recall they weren't too bad, to even, if you'd have stuck at it, you'd have got better, it's the same with every job you get better at

*FRE:	Yeah, yeah
*DAV:	It's sort of rained 
*UNK:	 (        )

*DAV:	Yeah, well
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	just to
*UNK:	 (        )

*FLO:	Oh, I've never heard, well I've heard of it, but I've never seen it  (.) 
*FRE:	As for a recipe, you pick these recipes up and that's a stupid blooming herb
*FLO:	This paper's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	Taunton in Devon  (.) 
*FRE:	Good old
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	Hurry up then, come paying, there's a shopping precinct in Taunton, Devon
*FRE:	Did you see the name of
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	town of Somerset
*DAV:	Did you see
*FLO:	What?
*DAV:	the name of the erm
*FRE:	That's unusual for the Observer
*DAV:	the Raving Loony Party member who's

*DAV:	Paddy Ashdown
*FRE:	Yes
*DAV:	Patrick Ashdown
*FLO:	Oh that's it Patrick I'm, I saw the Patrick Ashdown, I didn't know what
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	his real name isn't Patrick, it's John
*DAV:	Yeah, I mean it's a bit, a bit naughty in a way innit?
*FLO:	Yeah 
*DAV:	There could be a few older people that could make 
*FLO:	it could be confusing cos people
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Here you get
*FLO:	Although it does now say on paper what party they are, it never used to
*DAV:	No
*FLO:	but it does now, it does have a party as well as a name on the election paper
*FRE:	Well, a lot of old folk er, I don't think they're much bothered what they say, they know the name of the candidates and they seemed to 
*DAV:	that's for the name, yeah so ,so , some of them will be confused, but not enough for them to have any problems I shouldn't have thought.Did you get
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	I think they hold the balance at the end don't they?
*FRE:	Oh I think
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	getting in this er, seat it er
*DAV:	I bet it, as regards it cut down to about five
*FRE:	five, probably less
*DAV:	and Freda will get in as well 
*FRE:	There's no doubt who the majority will go   (.) well most of it
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Powell will lose his seat
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	but Freeman Fry will be
*FRE:	But I don't like the way he'd er, all this, all about er   (.) how you'll be annually taxed under Labour because the truth is that even under the Conservatives, all the years they've been in, and all the years they've been reducing tax, taxes from time to time, indirect taxation increased
*DAV:	Oh I know, you only got to look at the VAT ain't you for starters 
*FRE:	Yeah , taxation now if anything is harder than it was in seventy nine
*DAV:	Yeah
*FRE:	they shouldn't talk
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	I, I, I'd would teach them to stand up and tell them the truth, there don't appear to be too many of them about these days
*DAV:	Well it's just brought out a budget to paper over a few cracks and make it look good because they knew that, they've got no more chances this is it innit?I think  (.) 
*FRE:	Well do you think this really impress er Lisa?
*DAV:	I'll have a word with her when she's awake, she's still on a third dream I should think at the moment   (.) but she's er, certainly good talking, I could, I could try and get her without her knowing about it and see what happens, just dinner time I'll take it down and try it, oh you're gonna take it round Steve's ain't you?Today
*FRE:	Oh yes well you can perhaps do it tomorrow
*DAV:	Yes, through the week some time
*FRE:	do it a good turn if you could er
*DAV:	Well they normally stay in now, er, Monday and Tuesdays usually Lisa and Kev stay in with us and watch the telly with us   (.) they go, he plays pool Wednesday
*FRE:	Do they stay in on er, Sundays do they all
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Well generally he comes up for dinner, but he ain't today so he'll be Rhys will come, be in for dinner, he'll turn up about three, and they sometimes stay, we sometimes play game in the afternoon, board game or something, it depends
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Steve, you see, they often get
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Why, why bother about the football this afternoon?
*FRE:	See he'll watch it and all
*DAV:	Man City and Southampton ain't it?
*FRE:	Yeah
*DAV:	Yeah, don't bother me none   (.) as long as Southampton win mind you
*FRE:	Well Southampton er can pull er  (.) 
*DAV:	Reg see where Tottenham are in the league?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Pardon?
*DAV:	See where Tottenham are in the league?
*FRE:	No
*DAV:	They're about six from the bottom ain't they?They lost at home again yesterday   (.) they shall find themselves some trouble if they don't buck their ideas up   (.) whether they're lacking or not  (.) 
*FRE:	Well they're
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	I expect
*DAV:	well they're
*FRE:	Well it, the way they started off in that cup final, last year
*DAV:	Yeah
*FRE:	they're a danger to life aren't they?
*DAV:	Yeah it's terrible really
*FRE:	I've had him off with that first foul in the first minute, that he committed, ridiculous
*DAV:	Were Lineker weren't playing where he?No
*FRE:	Not yesterday?
*DAV:	No
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*DAV:	All raving about Rob Jones  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	down again
*DAV:	yep afraid so can you 
*UNK:	 (        )  (        ) 
*FRE:	get wound up
*DAV:	I know,would wouldn't surprise me either
*FRE:	Pity you know
*DAV:	He said that's half the reason that Brian Tolbrook took over at Tettron ain't it?,I think he had his eyes, he'd got his eyes on Tettron replacing 
*FRE:	Yeah 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	in the league 
*FRE:	he probably looked into the future a bit and decided that er 
*DAV:	yeah 
*FRE:	well it cost them a hundred thousand to do it, but, I mean he's never been able to afford the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	yeah and he's deciding that Adam and he's deciding that Adam weren't worth it and
*DAV:	Yeah
*FRE:	went for it, but
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	well he apparently spoke to erm, he had quite a lengthy conversation with Ron Atkinson apparently, cos Atkinson used to be the manager of Tettron didn't he?And he was telling them you know what a   (.) a good club it could be, it's the ground
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	they opened their own ground as well you see, but that was
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*DAV:	and, I mean don't, he's upset that
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	a wound up, I mean if there was a league team like Kettering, Kettering like the fourth division, that would be brilliant   (.) be nearer to go wouldn't it?
*FRE:	Why they all have such a large ground
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	I've never seen it
*FRE:	I remember going there
*DAV:	bet it's got four star pitches
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	after the war and there
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRE:	and they had a record gate  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*DAV:	It isn't a ground
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	near a ten, near the ground size of Kettering's
*DAV:	but they've got to, I remember when Rhys played in that, the F A bars quarter final, two seasons ago down here, they got well over a thousand down there then, and you just couldn't move, that were brilliant, all the way round the ground there were about four of five people deep
*FRE:	there's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	ground, it's a shame because
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	no point for promotion and weren't allowed to go off, cos of the state of the ground
*DAV:	I know that 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	but they could win the league this, this season and not go up
*FRE:	That's right
*DAV:	The Taylor reports got a lot to answer for really 
*FRE:	How did they get on yesterday?
*DAV:	Don't think they played
*FRE:	Well somebody said they're at Grantham
*DAV:	Were they? (.) It weren't in my paper this morning
*FRE:	Well check it on the er back page inside  (.) 
*DAV:	got to be the  (.) 
*FRE:	they weren't in the ordinary fixed roll
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	re-arranged
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	you see   (.) I met an old work mate of mine he said they were at Grantham  (.) 
*DAV:	No
*FRE:	Well they're on the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	though, weren't he?
*DAV:	In the paper I saw they were supposed to been at Bury but they played Bilston, Bedford  (.)
