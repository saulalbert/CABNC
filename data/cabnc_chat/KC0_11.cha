*ENI:	Do you get at school any erm  any sort of music lessons? •159606_160209•
*MOL:	Erm  yes. •160297_160406•
        On Thursdays I go to music lesson  and erm, we have this singing contest  erm, we come second out of the  first years, and we sung Mole in a Hole. •160463_161694•
*ENI:	Good! •161749_161763•
*MOL:	Erm  at dinner times you can go into the music room  erm  you can play on any music instrument you like  there's  keyboards  erm, violins  guitars erm  drums. •161763_163264•
        I tried to play on the drums, I'm not too good at that. •163291_163796•
*ENI:	They make a terrible noise don't they ? •163840_164037•
*MOL:	Yeah. •164037_164059•
        Erm  Only trouble, there's a snare drum  you can turn it onto snare or ordinary but when you have it on snare, if you play  or anything it rattles! •164059_165199•
*ENI:	Is it erm, is a snare the thing that , the sort of wire that goes across it? •165299_165706•
*MOL:	Yeah. •165736_165760•
*ENI:	And what does that do? •165817_165920•
*MOL:	Erm, well  it makes erm  a lighter , makes the drum sound to a lot of  lighter sounds. •165985_166647•
*ENI:	Oh I see. •166737_166797•
*MOL:	But erm, when you play music and you keep it on snare the wires keep rattling. •166822_167308•
*ENI:	Ah yes. •167367_167403•
*MOL:	So, you have to erm  pull this  erm, little lever at the side  and that  that'll  turn the snare bit off  they can play on there  erm  there's  the choir, erm •167423_169288•
*ENI:	Are you in the choir? •169416_169490•
*MOL:	Erm, no I don't know much about it yet, we haven't  I've only just  been told about it by a friend who I sit next to on the bus. •169490_170369•
*ENI:	You've only been there  I think a , a term haven't you? •170429_170659•
*MOL:	Yeah. •170713_170729•
*ENI:	So , yes. •170751_170771•

        It needs practice doesn't it? •173122_173278•
*MOL:	Yeah. •173278_173293•
*ENI:	Of course, being in the choir it gives you practice reading music  because you just have one line to follow •173374_173808•
*MOL:	Yeah. •173826_173846•
*ENI:	and that's a good start isn't it? •173883_174033•
