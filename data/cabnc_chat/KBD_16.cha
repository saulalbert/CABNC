*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	I say, so I said, well I'll arrange for a delivery.But, having said that   (.) he's not the most reliable   (.) person in the world.
*TER:	Have you given Peter your order?
*BAR:	Yeah.

*BAR:	Yeah.I mean, I can be back for   (.) well I mean, I can actually stay there in fact.
*TER:	Well, do you want the latest?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	There's, there's Steve , Dave    (.) er, all the men's meeting at the hideaway
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*TER:	is now going to be at the  (        ) . (.) We think she should, might stand down gracefully, if she doesn't erm   (.) she, we could refuse to adopt, but she's over there personally.Erm, I'm in two minds about what to do.I could   (.) name names and say   (.) because this is not a party decision, it's
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Dave , Steve , etcetera, and  (        ) .Now, who's Dave ? (.) Senior employee of the City Council
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	meeting with   (.) the leader of the Labour group who's   (.) supposedly doing all this to protect his wife.The reason he's married to her   (.) I mean, even  (        ) .I could, I could really throw the dirt at them   (.) by saying that I'll, you know, if there is a conspiracy   (.) there's, a person here who's been involved in a very iffy part of the budget, who all of a sudden after ten years of   (.) slagging off the town clerk, all of a sudden he's totally on the town clerk's side, together with   (.) Councillor .Why?The only person who's involved in both, allowing the town clerk to take these decisions, without any   (.) interference at all 
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	and now conspiring with a senior employee of the council, and of course, (        ) .Just not so.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	All of a sudden this erm   (.) worry about this budget heading, is being swept under the carpets and everybody being told is all in been er   (.) cleared up.It's Dave   (        ) .I'd fire him.
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	I could really make this into a very great conspiracy for  (        ) .
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	Apart from which, this meeting that they're supposed to be going to have   (.) is totally out of order anyway.Cos nobody's been sent any notices for it or notified about it.So I mean, I, I could
*BAR:	What the hell are they doing now!
*TER:	get the full meeting cance I mean, you get Ashdown yesterday, his party rally round him like
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	royalty's going of fashion!You get, I mean, Dave  and Steve , alright, they've never been my favourite people   (.) but   (.) all this pious goings-on with Dave , how much he hates the town clerk, and whatever opportunity he could get   (.) he would 
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	take.
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	First opportunity, real opportunity he gets   (.) he's   (.) doing everything the town clerk wants him to do.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	I just, I, I, honestly Barry, I've got to the stage where I believe in this conspiracy  (        ) .
*BAR:	Mm. (.) Well certainly some people want   (.) some answers want to be given on this   (.) budget, er me as well, I mean, he can't just suddenly say 
*TER:	Well 
*BAR:	it's all been sorted out, don't worry about it.
*TER:	Well   (.) I think it will be really stupid. (        )  (.) But I shall say   (.) Dave    (.) 
*BAR:	And how long  (        ) ?Well I park
*TER:	I'll put
*BAR:	er
*TER:	I'll drop you off.Cos I want to go home and  (        ) , I've got to home cos I've   (.) I've a stack of paperwork on my table.I'm not gonna be able to set off much later on remember because
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	There's no point in me getting
*BAR:	Nope.
*TER:	I'll have to go up to shop to get some shopping cos there's   (.) nothing to eat in the house.So I'll have to do something  (        ) . (.) Alright Barry? (        ) 
*BAR:	I just wonder what on earth they're, they're playing at with   (.) ha, cha cha cha cha cha cha.You know, I just don't understand what they're playing but th you know 
*TER:	They 
*BAR:	they can only be doing   (.) damage to th to the election chances I mean 
*TER:	Well they 
*BAR:	they can't be achieving anything else!
*TER:	I mean saying things like   (.) a successor has already been identified.I mean   (.) it's just stupid!Cos the general view in Morecambe isn't what they say it is.
*BAR:	Yeah, but it gives the impression there's a split group innit?
*TER:	Well, you give the impression of a   (.) a faction in the party, now   (.) I could, I could serve this faction quite easily   (.) to   (.) Mike  who'd give me a lot of say   (.) if I said, you know,th the   (.) the plot thickens, you know, here's a town 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	hall employee
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	always an opponent of the town clerk   (.) also now   (.) erm   (.) trying to cause problems.
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	I mean, that really does make the plot thicken   (.) doesn't it?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	I mean, why was Dave  being quoted for  (        ) , what has it got to with Dave ?He's not an officer of the constitut he isn't a treasurer, he isn't secretary, he's, he's nothing   (.) as far the constituency's concerned.They, if they want any quotes why don't they go and see chairman, who's Terry?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	I mean, this is them deliberately saying things to their friends   (.) and deliberately stirring it.They, oh!Because, I mean, I know where it's coming from, some of it's coming from Stanley , who, who thinks   (.) if I don't stand down it will damage Ruth's chances.That's not Ruth's own view of it.Well it, and I don't think with the News of the World round their necks they can afford to start playing silly people.Because I'm, you know, if they sa if they keep crossing me the way they are, quite frankly I'm   (.) you know, willing to make remarks myself.Although I don't want to do damaging things, but   (.) I don't see why I should be the person con cons constantly getting the flack from a group of people who were   (.) you know.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Who are genuinely trying to do damage to the party. (.) So do you want me to call at the  's now?
*BAR:	Yeah.There's, may as well. (.) Well, don't know.Well it doesn't really matter, I'll, I'll be   (.) I mean, what, so   (.) I mean there's   (.) except for seeing Anne there's nothing more to do is there?
*TER:	Well except to start getting that rubbish cleared away.
*BAR:	Well I can't put it away.Don't want a pile in the cellar when carpet delivery comes.
*TER:	No, but I pu put it next to the lift   (.) and as soon as Hughey comes   (.) put it outside and when I come back I'll take it away.
*BAR:	No you won't cos I'm meeting Ellial at, at half three.
*TER:	Well I mean, I should be back for half past two.I mean, if you want to just put it in that dustbin place and we'll take it tomorrow.
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	You know, the washing up machine and everything, all, all of that needs cleaning out, all behind the bar needs cleaning.We're giving people a very bad impression if we're opening tonight and   (.) nothing's been cleared up.I think I'll go for it Barry.I'll, I'll go and see where he is, and say, you know   (.) That washing up and everything wants doing before tonight so you, so if you're gonna say   (.) oh, we're open tonight and the place still looks like a pig stye!It ain't gonna give a very good impression.
*BAR:	Well he's not gonna want to, he's not,sha I mean he's   (.) it's not a meeting to look around the place is it really?
*TER:	Well it is.That's what they're coming for.That's one of the things Richard  is coming for, to look round.We'll come and have a good look round, I've never seen it. (.) I mean, er, you know what that's to do with don't you?The repairs notice.Even if we only got all those old tickets and things into green bags and started cleaning that out it would   (.) it would look as though we're making some   (.) effort.Er, if I can get   (.) the  and get him to come in   (.) reasonably soon, you know, I'll ring you and tell you whether he's in.If we could get him to come in reasonably quickly   (.) you could get all that stuff down and bagged up and we could get rid of it couldn't we?
*BAR:	Which which tickets are you talking about?
*TER:	Well all the old tickets and stuff, I mean, alright 
*BAR:	Where?From where?
*TER:	In, the bottom office.
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*TER:	As well as all the junk that's in the cleaner's room, it all wants getting rid of.I mean, what's happening about these speakers then? (.) I mean, is this supposed to be happening tonight or
*BAR:	No.
*TER:	what's
*BAR:	Well it's   (.) it's a trial. (.) Go in then.
*TER:	Just stop if there's any mail.
*BAR:	No there's nothing.
*TER:	Oh.
*BAR:	Okay.
*TER:	I'll go and get in and get on with
