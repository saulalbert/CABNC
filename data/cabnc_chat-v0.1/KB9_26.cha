*ANN:	What are the terms? •_•
        Thirty days. •_•
        But they're not paying thirty days. •_•
*TRA:	I've just explained that to him. •_•
        And he said he didn't know that, that he would get hold of Sen and ring me first thing, thing in the morning  er, to tell me why Sen hasn't paid. •_•
        He's got the invoice and everything. •_•
        I said well you've sent us twenty I said there is no V A T on it which it should be! •_•
        Deary me! •_•
        He says. •_•
        Has he got the ? •_•
        I said yes. •_•
        And I said, we've been having, having the invoice outstanding since October at two and half thousand pound! •_•
        I said, you actually owe me six thousand, one hundred and odd! •_•
        And I said, you must realize I've a small company, and that's, in one respect that I've had to send those conditions because you're failing to meet the agreed thirty days payment! •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*TRA:	And I said it's not on! •_•
        I said we couldn't survive like that. •_•
        And he said, well would you like to carry on with the contract? •_•
        I said we're too far committed now to, I says to back out. •_•
        I said, you know, we can't back out at this stage. •_•
        And I said, but I said if there isn't the payments of the invoice when they are sent  then  you know, we've you've gotta look at it. •_•
        So that invoice wants •_•
*ANN:	Doing. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*TRA:	it wants doing and sending, and put in put twenty eight days on. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*TRA:	Had to be paid, it can't be paid by the twenty eighth it's er  you know  well if I could've got hold of David or er, Andrew , I was gonna give Andrew  a right bollocking for just pushing it in and he should've sent it to er, Michael , Michael  's just got it shoved in front of his nose in Edinburgh. •_•
        He's just gone in to see if everything's alright at Edinburgh  and of course, that's why he's had to report for that. •_•
        Which was fair play to him, but bloody Andrew should have told him! •_•
        It's agreed, the system of stage payments, it's all written to him. •_•
*ANN:	And you've just spoken to him have you? •_•
*TRA:	I've just spoken to Michael . •_•
        Michael's great! •_•
*ANN:	And you, you  so he understands after he's sent you this? •_•
*TRA:	What? •_•
*ANN:	What's going on. •_•
*TRA:	Yeah. •_•
        Because I said I had to send that agreement because you're failing to meet the standard agreement, you're not paying within the twenty eight days or the thirty days! •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*TRA:	I said I've got an invoice outstanding for October, and I said I can't afford to do that! •_•
        He said, I realize that. •_•
        Then he said, we want you to do that work he said, because you've got a good reputation. •_•
        It makes, you know, if we  we're not gonna go bust just to get twelve months bloody work out of him on a service contract! •_•
        You know, but if we couldn't, if they as they said, if they wanted that money back tomorrow we could only give them half that money back because of what we've got •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*TRA:	er, you know, but, we might as well just say to everybody, David, Geoff, Ian  •_•
