@Comment:	conversation #46 (Tape 015402)
*JEA:	old ferry coming over from  erm Harwich to the Hook of Holland. •09725_28825•
        And I, I used to  sort of sit in er put  sit myself in my little erm bunk you know? •31425_72425•
*BRE:	Yeah. •72425_73025•
*JEA:	And the, the swaying of the ship and I used to sleep like a log. •74025_95625•
        Everybody else round me was being sick. •96325_116025•
        Not me. •116425_118225•
*BRE:	. •_•
        I didn't sleep very well at all. •118825_124125•
        Up and down up and down  all night. •125325_131325•
*JEA:	You have? •131325_132925•
*BRE:	Mm. •132925_133525•
*JEA:	Why? •139025_139625•
*BRE:	Don't know. •139625_141325•
        I •141325_141625•
*JEA:	Excitement? •141625_144325•
*BRE:	I think, a lot of it, you know I was  burning a bit so I think a lot of it was sort of it thinking about that blooming boiler. •144325_176125•
*JEA:	Yes. •176125_177025•
        Yes. •177525_178425•
*BRE:	And then you know Dave I think drew  he was, he was ever so, ever so restless. •178425_193225•
        I don't know whether he was expecting the water to burst  or what it was . •198525_224025•
*JEA:	Yeah I know. •224025_225825•
        Ooh I know. •225825_227425•
*BRE:	Cos when I went to bed I mean, you know I tested it and it didn't seem too bad. •227425_244925•
*JEA:	No. •244925_245525•
        No. •245525_246125•
*BRE:	It seemed sort of hot  but er  I mean that's the trouble at the moment because  even if it's something minor thing, it seems so dramatic. •246125_287125•
*JEA:	Exactly. •287125_290925•
*BRE:	You know especially to me at the moment. •290925_305525•
*JEA:	Yes. •305525_306425•
*BRE:	I don't know why. •306425_309725•
        The smallest thing  I mean it seems such a  •309725_319625•
*JEA:	Well I think  there must, this must be a very common feeling for a lot of people  that they feel that they're balanced on a knife edge. •319625_374025•
        There's so much  we've had to pay out so much  erm you've had to pay out so much on, on more mortgage than you expected. •374025_398825•
*BRE:	Mm. •398825_399425•
        Did you, saying that, did you see that programme on  let me think  oh dear . •399425_413725•
        It was on repossession. •413725_420725•
        One day in the week or the week before. •420725_430825•
        It was on er channel four I think it was  and it was all about these people that had been, you know encouraged to buy this house and then repossessed. •430825_469625•
*JEA:	Mm. •469625_470225•
        Mm. •470225_470825•
*BRE:	And  did you watch it? •470825_475825•
*JEA:	No I didn't see that one. •475825_484525•
*BRE:	Oh it was horrible. •484525_488225•
        And it was how people you know didn't want to er  and they wouldn't. •488225_500425•
        And they were saying that you don't give, the local erm MP was saying you know people just give their kids up and walk away. •500425_531525•
*JEA:	Mhm yes. •531525_534425•
        Mm. •534425_535125•
*BRE:	And, but it was awful you know. •535125_542325•
        There was so many of them. •542325_548125•
*JEA:	It should not happen. •548825_553025•
        I I mean I think it, somewhere somebody is being greedy. •553825_568025•
        It shouldn't happen. •568025_572025•
        And it seems to have happened because  thirty years ago everybody like Jerry and me had a repayment mortgage which meant there were very few endowment mortgages. •572025_623825•
*BRE:	Mm? •623825_624425•
*JEA:	Now a repayment mortgage  they will extend the term of the mortgage. •624525_642025•
*BRE:	Yeah but when we had a when we had   •642025_651025•
*JEA:	And the endowment you can't extend it. •651925_665525•
        Well I think they should make it so that you can extend it. •665525_691825•
*BRE:	Yeah but when they  •691825_696525•
*JEA:	I just don't think I just don't think repossessions should happen. •696525_713825•
*BRE:	But repayment now is due as an endowment. •726525_743225•
*JEA:	Well they should do something about it Brenda. •743225_755225•
        That's all I can say. •755225_767325•
        There should be some  certain fund for bailing out people who are in real, terrible difficulties. •767725_790825•
        Because you see  •790825_795525•
*BRE:	Yeah because  •795525_802125•
*JEA:	people  people are not being helped. •804725_816925•
        It's like my Neil. •816925_822225•
        Nobody was helping him. •822225_828125•
*BRE:	Nobody wants to know, do they? •828125_845825•
*JEA:	No they don't. •845825_848125•
*BRE:	Not with things sort of going on there's  and now you think sort of it, it's time when people sort of would  club together. •848125_877925•
*JEA:	Yes. •877925_879325•
*BRE:	But it was saying, er this, this programme was saying that that  erm  that they were buying a house. •879325_906225•
        And it was telling you  you know say they were, for argument's sake they was buying this house that was sort of up north and that. •906225_932425•
        And they were buying this house and it was worth something like  I don't know, they were, they'd got a twenty five grand mortgage. •932425_981925•
*JEA:	Mm. •981925_982525•
*BRE:	They hadn't got  it it wasn't, I mean  you know to us it was , a cheap mortgage but sort of up there it was probably, you know sort of  •982525_101342•
*JEA:	Mm. •101562_101622•
        Mm. •101622_101682•
*BRE:	a lot of money to him cos there's not the work and that. •101682_104022•
        And they'd bought this mortgage and their repayment was something like about I dunno a hundred and eighty pound a month. •104022_108252•
*JEA:	Mm. •108252_108312•
*BRE:	And they said you know, and then all of a sudden it had sort of gone up six percent. •108312_110152•
*JEA:	Yes. •110312_110402•
        That's right. •110942_111152•
*BRE:	And it was five hundred quid. •111152_111962•
*JEA:	Mm. •112002_112062•
*BRE:	And there was no way, you know at a hundred and eighty they'd struggled. •112062_114242•
*JEA:	Mm. •114242_114302•
        Mm. •114302_114362•
*BRE:	And they thought, because  most people were, were sort of us. •114362_115762•
        We thought oh we'll go for it. •116022_117062•
*JEA:	Yes. •117062_117182•
        Yes. •117182_117272•
*BRE:	It's gonna be a struggle for a year. •117272_119002•
        But you go for it. •119002_119582•
*JEA:	Yeah of course. •119642_119702•
*BRE:	And you don't dream of it •121962_122462•
*JEA:	No. •122462_122642•
        Nobody ever dreamed •122642_123122•
*BRE:	going up. •123122_123372•
*JEA:	Nobody ever dreamed of this. •123372_124032•
*BRE:	I mean they reckon it's gonna go back up now don't they? •124032_125082•
*JEA:	Yeah. •125082_125142•
        Probably will. •125142_125432•
        I, you see I think that instead of, instead of Lawson putting interest rates up to squeeze inflation out of the economy  he should have stopped all credit. •125432_129132•
        When Jerry and I  were young  if at the end of the month there was no money in the account  the bank used to write you a filthy letter if you were two pounds overdrawn. •129652_133382•
        And you had  if  it was no good you wanting something  and waving a bit of plastic at it. •133402_136512•
        There was no bit of plastic to wave then. •136552_138512•
*BRE:	There wasn't? •138512_138752•
*JEA:	Not a thing. •138752_138962•
        If you wanted to borrow money from the bank to, to buy anything there were two ways of getting money. •138962_141352•
        You could go to the bank and ask for a loan. •141382_142232•
        And mostly you got a dusty answer because if you hadn't got shares to put down as collateral, you didn't get your loan. •142232_146222•
        And the other way of doing it was to go on hire purchase. •146302_147532•
        And when you wanted to buy something like a three piece suite, you went to somewhere like Bentalls  and they took you into a little room, soon as you said to the man well I want to buy this on hire purchase and you went in to a little room  and the man sat down and you filled in a long form. •147532_155252•
        You told him what your husband earned. •155252_156292•
        Erm  what you, er what you  could manage in the way of repayments what, er er you had to put one third of the full price down. •156752_161272•
*BRE:	Is that when you and Jerry were first married or •161272_162462•
*JEA:	Yes. •162462_162552•
        Yeah you had to put one third of the full price. •162552_163462•
        So if a three piece suite cost say a hundred and fifty pounds, you had to put fifty pounds down. •164392_166342•
        And the, the hundred over over two years on, on interest. •166342_168222•
*BRE:	So people couldn't get in that state could they? •168222_169302•
        You •169302_169362•
*JEA:	You, you could not get into debt Brenda. •169362_170932•
        You were not allowed to. •170932_171392•
*BRE:	What you could afford  you had. •171392_172022•
*JEA:	Exactly. •172022_172262•
        Exactly. •172392_172632•
*BRE:	Now when did the  I suppose the credit card they brought  but as to what you say I mean  the, these, these repossessions it's not the fact  they can't afford the mortgage. •173522_177902•
        It's the fact they can't afford  all the  the, the lifestyle to go with it, that's what Dave says. •178012_181822•
        I mean the fact is  you know there's blokes at work. •181822_183392•
        Same mortgage as us and earning the same as Dave. •183392_184952•
        I mean, you know they're in a dreadful state. •184952_186012•
*JEA:	Mm. •186012_186072•
*BRE:	I mean they spend their wages before •186522_188392•
*JEA:	Mm. •188392_188452•
*BRE:	And I think it's because they go out drinking and  you know •188452_189602•
*JEA:	Mm. •189602_189662•
*BRE:	They're always buying things for the home. •189662_190482•
        And the cars. •190482_190742•
        I mean  majority of blokes at Dave's firm have changed their cars three times. •190742_193632•
*JEA:	Yeah. •193662_193722•
        Yeah. •193722_193782•
        I know. •193782_193882•
        People have come to expect that. •193882_195582•
        Now you could do it in the nineteen seventies and er  well  yes I would say from nineteen sixty eight onwards with  plastic card and  , what's called revolving credit. •195582_200452•
        You could just run up the credit. •200632_201812•
        I mean my, all my efforts after Christmas will be to get rid of these card debts. •201812_204222•
        I promised   •204222_204532•
*BRE:	Yeah but with you it's  I mean, alright you don't want it over you, but you will clear it. •204532_206432•
*JEA:	Oh yes. •206432_206612•
*BRE:	But thing is there's a lot of people that, that that don't. •206722_208772•
*JEA:	No. •209132_209252•
        Quite. •209882_210042•
        Quite. •210042_210072•
*BRE:	I mean I know I told you this  •210072_210662•
*JEA:	I mean the only reason I'm I'm running up these debts is that now  I've got so little capital left, that I've got to keep the capital for sheer disasters like  the boiler. •210662_214952•
*BRE:	Mm. •214952_215012•
*JEA:	And because you've got to pay that in cash. •215012_216032•
*BRE:	But there's people that  you know are still now spending them at Christmas. •216032_218962•
        It's like Jen, still spending them. •218972_219772•
        You know he's still got like two holidays left on them. •219772_223192•

*BRE:	But then still runs it up for Christmas. •223282_225322•
*JEA:	Yeah. •225322_225392•

*BRE:	Yeah but you you didn't have  thousands outstanding before you, you know by spending yours like yesterday. •226282_229782•
        You didn't think to yourself oh god I owe five hundred pound on  Marks and Sparks  I'll top it up . •229782_232562•
*JEA:	No I had a fifty pound debt. •232562_233432•
*BRE:	That's it. •233442_233592•
*JEA:	And when the er and I've now got what? •233592_234462•
        Er three hundred. •234462_234812•
        Now that when, as soon as I get my cheque from the British Legion  for two hundred, roughly. •234992_239432•
        I won't wait for the card, for the bill to come in for the card. •239432_240862•
        I shall send that off to Marks. •240862_241652•
        I won't wait for them to send to me. •241652_243712•
*BRE:	Oh can you send it off? •243712_244202•

        But they'll get their money. •253452_255132•
*BRE:	And then, when they send you the bill then will they just, you won't get so much interest on it? •255132_258472•
*JEA:	No they'll just say payment, thank you. •259652_260592•
        And  won't be quite so much. •260592_261502•
*BRE:	Mind you er and even easier, what annoys me  they've put the interest rate down on the cards. •261502_264252•

        Because people don't want to buy a repossessed house. •424502_425762•
        For one thing they think it's unlucky. •425762_426532•
        And the second thing is that repossessed houses very very quickly begin to look dirty and battered. •426532_429972•
*BRE:	Mm. •429992_430052•

*BRE:	Mm. •481092_481152•
*JEA:	You, you find a house to rent  that seems right for your  about the price, perhaps a bit high but about right for your  level of income. •481152_485462•
        And you go to the local housing agency er the, the council housing agency, and you get a  grant to help you with your rent. •485692_488822•
        So that there aren't special council houses. •489602_490512•
        any house could be a council house. •490512_491632•
*BRE:	Mm. •491692_491752•
*JEA:	And it means that •491752_492472•
*BRE:	I don't think the council can afford to do it now can they? •492522_493822•
*JEA:	No. •493822_493902•
        They can't but they, it should, it should have been possible for the councils to have  I don't know it, it  it seems  I, I put it down, I remember walking up and down on the beach with John  about eight weeks ago was it? •493902_501262•

        Or was it after the diarrhoea but before the two lovely colds? •502872_504452•
        And we were walking up and down on the beach at Aldeburgh  and the most interesting part of our conversation was  that we were saying we both started out as  not conservatives, I've never voted conservative in my life, but we started out as very loyal people. •504452_511412•
        British justice was marvellous. •511412_512482•
