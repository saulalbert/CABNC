*ANN:	Yes. 
*JAM:	And she gets any, a lot of parcels that woman. She must be the best, one of the best customers they've, she, they've got. 
*ANN:	Yes, but she's got all the erm   (.) she's got hundreds of   (.) well not hundreds, but she's got a lot of customers, I mean, she works in   (.) huge offices doesn't she? 
*JAM:	Yes. It's the biggest   (.) erm   (.) fraud er o  well civil service outside London. 
*ANN:	Yeah.  (7.0) Right.  (14.0) There was erm   (.) what I thought was a, a white Rolls   (.) parked outside our house when I was putting the washing on the line   (.) just after you went to work.  (6.0) Erm   (.) well   (.) I've gotta wash the dishes. I was with, and it was, I could see it at the front. 
*JAM:	Oh! 
*ANN:	Er, it turned out it wasn't a Rolls it was a Bentley, but I don't know one  car from   
*JAM:	 Oh yeah. 
*ANN:	another.  A   
*JAM:	 It's  still a rather   (.) classy  car. 
*ANN:	 Yes.  Well it looked like a wedding car cos there were bouquets in the back. 
*JAM:	Mhm. 
*ANN:	And, Paul was working on his car out the front   (.) and I went to ask him if he knew who was getting married. And er   (.) he said it had been standing there for quite a while. He thought it was   (.) maybe just   (.) er   (.) the driver had taken someone to the church   (.) was waiting to go back for them. And er   (.) Betty called me in for a cup of coffee but     (.)  ((clears throat))  (.) and I was there, I think, for over two hours. 
*JAM:	Tt. 
*ANN:	I didn't mean to stay that long   (.) cos I had a lot to do. Anyway, it was, it  was still there   
*JAM:	 Like what? 
*ANN:	it was still there when I  took   
*JAM:	  ((laughing)) What  do you mean you had a lot to do ? Like what? 
*ANN:	Housework! 
*JAM:	Why? 
*ANN:	It was still there   (.) when I took Jackie's parcel to her and it wa  I, I think   (.) I didn't look out the, the window   (.) till about five o'clock and it had gone then.  But Betty   
*JAM:	 Well  , 's a taxi driver. 
*ANN:	Yes. And tho  erm   (.) Betty thinks the er   (.) the   for   (.) do er cars as well. 
*JAM:	Mm. (8.0)  (  )  
*ANN:	Yes.  (40.0) See if it is hot enough. 
*JAM:	Thank you. 
*ANN:	Has that just come through the letter box? 
*JAM:	No it came before. 
*ANN:	Oh.  (9.0) I'll make you  some   
*JAM:	 Yes. 
*ANN:	coffee. 
*JAM:	Yes, it's   (.) hot enough thank you. 
*ANN:	Right.  (30.0) Is it raining? 
*JAM:	I suppose it is. I don't know if  it is. 
*ANN:	 Well  the back wall looks wet. 
*JAM:	Well th  there was no rain on it when I came   (.) came here. Must have su  must have suddenly started. 
*ANN:	It is raining.  (6.0) I got the washing   (.) nearly all dry anyway. All the shirts. I didn't   (.) it was so bright and   (.) windy so   (.) I put another lot in after that lot came out   (.) it'll be, only be   (6.0) T-shirts I'll have in the dryer when they finish off. 
*JAM:	Well these poor blighters who got flooded   (.) who   (.) could do with the wind to dry the houses out couldn't  they? 
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*JAM:	The er  (8.0)  
*ANN:	The what? 
*JAM:	I delivered those leaflets this morning   (.) in Auburn Place   (.) the house at the end 
*ANN:	Which one? 
*JAM:	the one that was flooded, the one that was 
*ANN:	The one facing onto the bridge? 
*JAM:	Yes. That er   (.) Tess   bought   (.) and they did it all up. When they told me at work she'd bought that, I was, cos they lived up at Green Lane   (.) I thought my God he'd have   (.) they've picked a   (.) a bad spot there cos there's no flood protection at all there. And in fact, when the river rises they   (.) it drops down onto that house, and the house next door. Anyway, I saw that everything was up, the doors, the back door was open, the front door was open   (.) there was everything up from downstairs and   (.) must be awful. 
*ANN:	Well I saw the curtains were down   (.) erm   (.) when I took   (.) the triplets 
*JAM:	 ((cough)) 
*ANN:	all around there yesterday, the curtains were down and it looked as if there was   (.) a table piled up with cardboard boxes in the, in the front  window. 
*JAM:	 There was.  Well there's, it was er   (.) there was a table. And a house further along   (.) in   (.) Abbey View there   (.) cos i  and it was four houses  actually in the   
*ANN:	 The one on  (  ) ? 
*JAM:	 No. 
*ANN:	 Th   the one just past the social club? 
*JAM:	No not that one. Well that one, I wa  I, I delivered there. But, no, about three houses on from that   (.) they were decorating. Now, it looked as if they were newly decorating so whether the water got into there or not, but it didn't look   (.) as if they were in the process of decorating so   (.) I hope it didn't for their sake. 
*ANN:	Well, that one on the cor  the first one 
*JAM:	Aye. That's the one that appears on  television  (  ) . 
*ANN:	 That was the one  that was on television with the water right   (.)  the way   
*JAM:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	up it. 
*JAM:	But further on, you know er, what they call, the teacher lives? 
*ANN:	Brian  ? 
*JAM:	They've got erm   (.) sort of walls in front of the houses, right next to the, the bay windows with erm   (.) with the slot, where they, they slot in these steel erm, plates. 
*ANN:	Have they? 
*JAM:	Yes. Oh yes. About two or three of them, they have, at that end. 
*ANN:	I never noticed that. 
*JAM:	Yep. With erm   (.) and they had sand, they all had sandbags along there, but they had these sort of   (.) er   (.) walls built up. But I mean th  they're decorative walls, they've got plants growing in the top and this sort of thing, built up to the, about the level of the window 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*JAM:	and er   (.) then they have   (.) the gap for the path and they have a, erm   (.) a steel plate. Because when I went up I had to climb over the steel plate. Cos they hadn't removed them. 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*JAM:	Even though the water was all down. But erm 
*ANN:	Have they  done   
*JAM:	 the   
*ANN:	that themselves? 
*JAM:	I think so, yes. I think so. Yes, cos they're not the same. I mean each   (.) each house is different but er   (.) there's   (.) not all of them have them, there's only two or three had done that. And that was at Brian   's end.  The ones   
*ANN:	 And he, he is the very end one isn't he? 
*JAM:	I dunno if he's   (.) er, but it's his end, I don't know if it's his house, I can't remember if it was his house, but at that end of  the street. 
*ANN:	 Didn't he  buy the one that we looked at, once? 
*JAM:	We did look at one there. I can't remember. I don't know. But in any case, erm   (.) th  the end house hasn't got that up   (.) it's   (.) oh, what they call her? Rosie? 
*ANN:	 
*JAM:	Rosie  . Her house has. And the house next to her, on either side, those are the three houses  that have got that on. 
*ANN:	 I've never seen Ro  Rosie    for years! I know, she's working erm 
*JAM:	Well her husband  was very ill wasn't he? 
*ANN:	 at the workers'  education   (.) what is it called? W E A? 
*JAM:	Workers'  Education Association. 
*ANN:	 She works, she works  for that. 
*JAM:	Does she? Oh! 
*ANN:	Erm 
*JAM:	What doing? Does she lecture like? 
*ANN:	Yes. I think, yes. 
*JAM:	What subject? 
*ANN:	I can't remember, but there was a whole 
*JAM:	Well it can't be in Moorford because  the only thing that   
*ANN:	 No it's at  Ashington. 
*JAM:	the only thing they do in Moorford is   (.) birds. Ornithology. 
*ANN:	No, erm   (.) I'm sure it's in a, at Ashington. 
*JAM:	Mm. 
*ANN:	And 
*JAM:	Well I've  never seen   
*ANN:	  (  )  
*JAM:	it advertised. They do quite a, they've got quite a big programme in Gosforth and Newcastle   (.) and 
*ANN:	I'm not sure. I think 
*JAM:	Whitley Bay I think as well. 
*ANN:	I think   (.) I think I heard Jean     (.) say something about erm   (.) the writers' workshops. 
*JAM:	Mm. 
*ANN:	I'm not sure if   (.) she said tha  that Rosie had, had given them a lecture or something once, then I said  oh! 
*JAM:	  ((cough))  
*ANN:	I know Rosie   quite well.  (6.0) There's your coffee. 
*JAM:	Thank you. Thank you.  That was very   
*ANN:	 Was it hot? 
*JAM:	nice.  Thank you   
*ANN:	 Was it   
*JAM:	very much. 
*ANN:	hot enough for you? 
*JAM:	Yes, it was hot enough. 
*ANN:	It looked as if it was. 
*JAM:	Well I don't like it too hot, (  ) ever. 
*ANN:	Pardon? 
*JAM:	I don't like hot food ever. 
*ANN:	Oh I know, you're like my mother, stone cold! 
*JAM:	I don't like it stone cold, I just like it nice, cos if it's too hot you can't taste it. Try to get it down me before it burns  my tongue! 
*ANN:	  ((laugh))  
*JAM:	These folks and that with all these spices and things a   (.) you can't taste the food   (.)  you taste   
*ANN:	 I know. 
*JAM:	the spices. Cos that's what it was all about,tas  take away the taste   (.) of the rotten food, that's the whole point  of spices. 
*ANN:	 I know, I think it's hilarious! Asdir   (.) erm   (.) saying my ginger wine  was too hot. 
*JAM:	 Was too hot. 
*ANN:	Bloody  ridiculous! 
*JAM:	 When she's used  to eating   (.) red hot curries 
*ANN:	But they don't drink red hot stuff I suppose. I suppose that was the difference. They don't drink red hot stuff, they drink, ((laughing)) only eat red hot stuff, and they drink   (.) cool things to cool their mouth down  after ! 
*ANN:	 She  drinks tea. 
*JAM:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Well she   (.) she used to drink tea when she   (.) if I ever   (.) well I didn't invite her in for a coffee do, well I didn't to begin with  did I? 
*JAM:	 Well they  drink, do they not, does she   
*ANN:	 I mean   
*JAM:	not drink coffee? 
*ANN:	No. I invite, when we walk back from school   (.) erm   (6.0) when she first came to live   (.) round there, and er   (.) I used to walk back from school with her sometimes   (.) and say, would you like a cup of coffee? Well she didn't know anybody of course and she'd say, no   ((laughing)) thank you . And then after   (.) oh, after a few weeks she said   (.) I'll come in for a cup of tea. So I said, okay. So I used to make tea for her.  (7.0) And it got, in the end, actually, if I was, if I had to do something   (.) that was urgent   (.) or I had to go somewhere   (.) I used to have to say to her   (.) something like, you know, erm   (.) oh I better get on, I got a lot to do this morning, or   (.) I'm goi  I've to be shopping and   (.) be back in time to cook Jim's dinner or something like that cos he's starting, oh I've gotta have his dinner ready at twelve before he goes to work and   (.) if I really was pushed   (.) otherwise she would have come in every day. Not that I minded her coming in every day, just didn't, not always that time. 
*JAM:	Aye. I wonder how they're getting on through there? 
*ANN:	And also, if she came in   (.) when I had the triplets   (.) it meant that erm   (.) you know, she was sitting talking to me when I wanted to be playing with them and   (.) taking them out and getting on with doing things with them. 
*JAM:	They still haven't sold the house have they? 
*ANN:	No.  (6.0) Well I was just talking about that today to Betty. You ar  di   (.) didn't you see it? Didn't you show someone round it once? 
*JAM:	Yeah, I've shown two lots of people  round. 
*ANN:	 Did  you notice the bathroom ceiling? 
*JAM:	Yes. (  ) . 
*ANN:	I only saw it erm   (.) you showed two lots round  didn't you? 
*JAM:	 Mm mm.   I did. 
*ANN:	 I only  showed er, Gillian   
*JAM:	 I didn't  show them right u  opened the house and was stood with them, walked round with her like, you know, but   (.) breezed 
*ANN:	Well actually the time I went in it was erm   (.) when Gillian   was thinking of buying it 
*JAM:	Oh aye. 
*ANN:	and er   (.) I went   (.) her mother and father were with her   (.) and I just really went in up and down the stairs, and they went upstairs and they, they shouted, oh Ann! Come and look at this. And er   (.) in the back   (.) I think it was the back bedroom   (.) there was a, a light switch   (.) and the wiring   (.) was sort of hanging from, from the switch. It looked dangerous! 
*JAM:	Mm. 
*ANN:	And there was   (.) there was something weird. It wasn't a telephone point   (.) I don't know what it was. 
*JAM:	Television point? 
*ANN:	No, it came from   (.) half way along the hall, up under the stair carpet   (.) and into the erm   (.) front bedroom, but it, it didn't have a, a sort of, you know the 
*JAM:	Yes. Aye. 
*ANN:	it didn't have a telephone, sort of attachment.  (6.0) And the bathroom ceiling was black mould! And of course, if it, if it had been   (.) I know they came once   (.) because 
*JAM:	Who came? 
*ANN:	Well, Syrej 
*JAM:	Oh. 
*ANN:	dropped Asdir off   (.) and she drove away and I saw her and the four children go, along to the house 
*JAM:	Mm. 
*ANN:	cos I was in here   (.) and er   (.) I think she had some paint in her hand 
*JAM:	Oh. 
*ANN:	and after about ten minutes I thought   (.) what the devil is she doing in there! No, she only had the three children, erm   (.) Asthana wasn't born. That was it. 
*JAM:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	I thought, what's she doing in there? Tha  that's right, she was pregnant wasn't she, after 
*JAM:	Can't be. 
*ANN:	Asthana wasn't born when she left here. 
*JAM:	That's right, she was  (  ) . 
*ANN:	Mm mm. 
*JAM:	Well surely she was born when   (6.0)  (  ) . 
*ANN:	No,go   ((sigh))  (7.0) well perhaps it wasn't long after Asthana was born. Anyway, it was, it was in the winter. Erm 
*JAM:	Is it two years now? Oh I can't remember. 
*ANN:	It is, you know. I think Asth   
*JAM:	Eighteen months old. Two  Christmases. 
*ANN:	 No,Januar  . Janu   
*JAM:	It's two Christmases anyway. 
*ANN:	it's January the seventh. Asthana's birthday, she must be two. 
*JAM:	No, no, no, no, she's the  (  ) . 
*ANN:	Oh! They moved before Christmas. 
*JAM:	I know it's two Christmases. 
*ANN:	Aye. Well, whatever. And er   (.) well that might have been it,A  Asthana might have been a tiny baby. So I went along there cos I thought   (.) if she was painting   (.) the children will be frozen and nothing to sit on  and no   
*JAM:	 Mm mm. 
*ANN:	heating. So I went down, and she was, she was painting the bathroom ceiling. And I said   (.) er, I'll take the children back to my house with me, at least they'll be warm, I can give them a drink or something. So they came back   (.) but of course, if it's jus  if it's been pouring in on that bathroom ceiling again it's, it, when I took, when Elsie called up to me, come and look at this, the bathroom ceiling was black mould! 
*JAM:	It wasn't black when I   (.) showed those people round, but it was damp.  You could see   
*ANN:	 Oh no. 
*JAM:	the stains of the damp. 
*ANN:	Perhaps he's been and washed it off again. Sometimes when he  comes   
*JAM:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	through. 
*JAM:	Aye. 
*ANN:	But nobody, how long is it since the last time we showed them in? 
*JAM:	It's quite a while now. I dunno.  I can't remember when it was. 
*ANN:	 And the key's still on  our kitchen windowsill  so   
*JAM:	 Yes.   (6.0) Yeah but look at, the amount of houses that are for sale. 
*ANN:	Oh yes, but   (.) but look how quickly Marie sold hers. 
*JAM:	But it was in a better state. Better condition wasn't it? 
*ANN:	Oh it was beautiful! 
*JAM:	I know. Aye.  (6.0) But I mean, there's a lot of houses for sale. 
*ANN:	Some of them are sold quite quickly.  (6.0) There's some new people in number   (.) ten is it? 
*JAM:	I don't know. 
*ANN:	They park their car just beside Doug's house. I don't see them very much, they tend to use the back door, and sort of come out and then go  down   
*JAM:	 Mm. 
*ANN:	the back lane. I don't see them come round the front.  (9.0)  ((sigh))  (.) You haven't drunk your coffee.  (7.0) Did you see your mother? 
*JAM:	Yes. And she's complaining about not going anywhere or 
*ANN:	Ee! The places she's been in the  last couple   
*JAM:	  ((sneeze))  
*ANN:	of weeks. 
*JAM:	Yes.  She's   
*ANN:	 If  she could only remember where she'd been   (.) and how much she's enjoying it while she's actually doing it. 
*JAM:	Aye. Cost me a fiver for her hair to be done on Monday and another fiver to go out on   (.) Berlin Square on Tuesday. And tomorrow, she's going to this   (.) thing at the chapel.  Going for tea. 
*ANN:	 What thing at the  chapel? 
*JAM:	Going for tea and then for the service afterwards. 
*ANN:	Mm! Oh yes! 
*JAM:	So they're going about four o'clock. 
*ANN:	I'll have to go   (.) earlier to see her because they'll be   (.) maybe getting her changed for that. 
*JAM:	Aha. Karen came and asked me   (.) I says alright. Have you got to go? And I said yes.  (7.0) Mind, she didn't go out this afternoon cos they went, some of them went up to the British Legion Club this afternoon. 
*ANN:	Didn't she want to go? Or wasn't there room? 
*JAM:	I don't know. She were up sick all night, but I don't think she, she would have wanted to go anyway. The erm   (.) you know the rather large lady that, who I always speak to? 
*ANN:	Er, yes.

*ANN:	Has she got her colostomy bag back on yet? Or are they still leaving it off? 
*JAM:	I don't know. 
*ANN:	How do they take her anywhere if she's got the bag off?  (9.0) Must, well that's you out.

*ANN:	 It's  cos it's written on blue paper in tiny  print. 
*JAM:	 it's  the third of May. 
*ANN:	 ((reading brochure)) Daffodils   (.) and arboretum 
*JAM:	And there's a  coffee bar. 
*ANN:	 products, plant and cake stalls. Suitable for wheelchairs. 
*JAM:	Well that's what I was thinking. 
*ANN:	Toilet for disabled. 
*JAM:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Tea with home-baked scones and cakes. Open from one till   (.) five . 
*JAM:	Mhm. 
*ANN:	It still isn't a lot of time if you finish work at quarter past three, and you're not home  till   
*JAM:	 I'm, I'm a half day, I finish at twelve. 
*ANN:	 Oh! Oh! Right.  Oh that's okay then. 
*JAM:	I was just thinking if we take her out that afternoon. 
*ANN:	Sunday, May the third. 
*JAM:	In fact, I was   (.) there's a   (.) I'm going to suggest that we, we take some of the patients er   (.) and early about   (.) when is this? It's in June. 
*ANN:	Well do you want to go   (.) take some of the other patients that day and I'll go as an escort? 
*JAM:	Well on the twelfth of June my   (.) Age Concern are having   (.) er, a fair at Blagden Hall, all day that day. 
*ANN:	On when? 
*JAM:	The twelfth of July.  (6.0) So on Hazel's birthday. No, that's twelfth of June. 
*ANN:	Twelfth of June, your Hazel's birthday. 
*JAM:	What's the twelfth of July? 
*ANN:	I've no idea. 
*JAM:	It's the twelfth of July  is last year the er   
*ANN:	 Fourth of July's Independence Day. 
*JAM:	it's the twelfth of July of last year they   (.) had one. No, that's the fourteenth of July. 
*ANN:	I don't think anything's the twelfth of  July. 
*JAM:	 No.  It's the fourteenth of July is Bastille Day. But, anyway 
*ANN:	And what are you that day? 
*JAM:	I'm on early. All earlies. 
*ANN:	Ordinary early? Quarter past three early? 
*JAM:	Oh, well, I say I'm on early but   (.) I will be, I could be an early or a late. So that's 
*ANN:	So if you took them that day you'd be going while you were on duty? 
*JAM:	Well, for pa  most of it   (.) or part of it. But I could organize that. And, if   (.) what they call it? 
*ANN:	Is that a Sunday at Easter? 
*JAM:	It's a Sunday. If they can actually let me know   (.) whether that bus is available or not 
*ANN:	You're not gonna drive that bus are you? 
*JAM:	I didn't say I was. But, Mr   has got a P S V licence. I don't know if I can  drive   
*ANN:	 Oh! 
*JAM:	the bus or not, it depends   (.) we'll have  to see. 
*ANN:	 And does  he, does he drive the buses? Er, the hospital bus  like   
*JAM:	 No. 
*ANN:	that? 
*JAM:	No. No. He's never driven. He's not down as a   (.) as a driver for the minibus now. But he's got a P S V licence which is a different thing altogether. 
*ANN:	Yes, but, if he was willing to drive in his spare ta  time, he would have his name down surely? Wouldn't  he? 
*JAM:	 Well  one would have thought so, but I said to er Mrs   you see, about the minibus, no not the minibus, the M S bus being available   (.) and, I said the problem was   (.) or maybe   (.) that we'd have to have drivers who have had a P S V licence, or what they call it? It isn't a P S V license now, it's   (.) very different  type of licence. 
*ANN:	 Well whatever  it's  called. 
*JAM:	 But  it's the same thing. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JAM:	And she said, oh my husband's just renewed his. So he could drive and so there'd be no problem she says. But he's never ever, as far as I know   (.) offered to drive the minibus. 
*ANN:	Does he work? 
*JAM:	Well 
*ANN:	It sounds, it sounds odd saying, oh my husband's just renewed his, it makes it sound as if he hasn't had a P S V   (.) erm   (.) licence for a while. 
*JAM:	I don't  know. 
*ANN:	 Cos  if he was working, and driving   (.) he wo  it, surely he would have automatically renewed it? 
*JAM:	I don't know. 
*ANN:	So it  sounds as if he's just renewed it after a while. 
*JAM:	 They used to have some sort of test on that  (  ) . 
*ANN:	So maybe that's why he's never volunteered before. If he didn't have the licence, he couldn't. 
*JAM:	Well yes, of course. 
*ANN:	Except, he could have for the minibus of course.  (6.0) Where's my knitting gone? 
*JAM:	I think he had a pet shop. 
*ANN:	Well he wouldn't need a P S V licence for a pet shop. 
*JAM:	But, I don't know that  he does now. 
*ANN:	 Unless you were a  Pet Shop Boy   (.) and were a roadie. 
*JAM:	Mm mm. ((cough))  
*ANN:	I can't remember what line I was doing. 
*JAM:	Well   (.) because she   (.) periodically brings the bird seed for the   (.) the bird on the ward. I'm sure he never  (  ) . Whether the business was successful or not. I had a vague recollection   (.) somebody said he had this pet shop at Blagden or som   (.) not Blagden  er   
*ANN:	 Blagden?  There are  no shops   
*JAM:	 not Blagden   
*ANN:	at Blagden. 
*JAM:	Bury. 
*ANN:	Oh. 
*JAM:	 ((sniff)) 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*JAM:	But we could still take the minibus and just take   (.) three or four. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JAM:	Well that's an alternative.  (6.0) But that will be a good day to go out on. 
*ANN:	Mm mm. 
*JAM:	But we could take my mother on the other one. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JAM:	Or we could take   (.) them periodically. Could go out, well the next   (.) then there's a queue a mile long. I said no. I said mark the ones on that thing.  (  ) you want to go to.  (6.0) That's when I    (  )   
*ANN:	 It's  a bit far to take her to near Berwick. 
*JAM:	I wasn't thinking of taking her there, I was thinking of taking  you! 
*ANN:	 Oh. 
*JAM:	Anyway, it might be  too cold. 
*ANN:	 And Corn  Hill on the Tweed's a bit far for you my love. 
*JAM:	I was thinking about 
*ANN:	There's  Anwick   
*JAM:	 cos you   
*ANN:	Howick at Anwick. 
*JAM:	I was thinking of you going there. 
*ANN:	Where's Hallington? 
*JAM:	I dunno. It tells you. Does it not? 
*ANN:	Oh! Wait a minute. Between Colwell and Kirkharl. 
*JAM:	Mm.  (6.0) Etaul Manor's open nearly every Sunday. 
*ANN:	Wasn't it Kirk  oh no it was Katheaton. Was it Ka   
*JAM:	Where Capability  Brown   
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*JAM:	came from? Yes. 
*ANN:	That's right. We never did find his house did we? 
*JAM:	No. 
*ANN:	If there's any 
*JAM:	 ((laughing)) And there's nothing  there ! 
*ANN:	 if  there's any   (.) remnants of his house. There was certainly no   (.) indication of it anywhere in the village. There wasn't even anybody to ask! 
*JAM:	Nope. But if you wanted to go to any of those, those I marked for my   (.) days off, apart from the one to Blagden on a half day. But I could go that day. Cos it's no distance to Blagden. The others we'll take 
*ANN:	We could walk there. 
*JAM:	Tt. Aye, it's three mi  it's over four miles, it's   (.) I haven't got the street map, it's about four miles.  (6.0)  ((sigh))  (.) Well we took your mother and we   (.) that time. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JAM:	Perhaps we'll get the bus there. And then, in those days there was a bus service that way. I don't think there's a bus service running that way now. 
*ANN:	Isn't there? 
*JAM:	Nope. To get to 
*ANN:	Well how many houses are on that road? There's only 
*JAM:	Well there's a fair number. Actually on the road itself there's   (.) well there is a fair number. There's quite a few in the estate itself. Quite a few houses  down   
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*JAM:	the estate.  (9.0) Tt. 
*ANN:	Did you tell me   (.) what did they call the one who lived there? That worked with you. 
*JAM:	Near the road there? 
*ANN:	Yeah. Di   
*JAM:	She got  (  ) . 
*ANN:	Oh that's right.  (6.0) Where is she? 
*JAM:	Well er, she's at home, or she's in the erm  R E I   
*ANN:	 I used  to see her in  the hairdressers sometimes. 
*JAM:	 while the death is being investigated.  And she   (6.0) she went into the R E I, with a query   (.) stroke. 
*ANN:	I know. I remember that. 
*JAM:	A query   (.) I think she had a query lump on her breast or something, er lump or something. And   (.) they transferred her to the, the Cottage   (.) and she did quite well, and she was home. And whatever lump it was   (.) they said wasn't anything to worry about. But then   (.) it was virtually   (.) er   (.) clear again, she was saying   (.) but she has a brain tumour. And whether they can operate  (  ) . 
*ANN:	Mm. Oh dear.  (7.0) She was nice, she was a nice woman. 
*JAM:	But he retired early, of course, because of his   (.) bad knees. 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*JAM:	He couldn't   (.) well he was the   (.) head gamekeeper for Lord  . 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JAM:	And er   (9.0) the dampness and the   (.) tramping all over the   (.) rough ground and what have you, wasn't good for his knees. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JAM:	He    (  )  (.) came from all over   (.) Macaw or somewhere down there   (.) he came from. 
*ANN:	Mm. Didn't know that. 
*JAM:	And when he came out of the army   (.) you know, after the war   (.) er   (.) he didn't want to go. Well, I think, I don't know if they went back to the pits and sort of left, but he didn't want to stay there and   (.) and got this job as a gamekeeper  (  ) .  (8.0)  (  ) . He had a stroke. They say that if you, if it wasn't for the shooting   (.) we wouldn't have any grouse or pheasants cos they wouldn't be preserved.  (6.0)  (  ) they   (.) they'd be   (  ) on a farm if he wants. The grouse apparently it would. 
*ANN:	I nearly stood on a grouse once, when we were walking up   (.) I wasn't walking with you, it was when we were with the Footpath Society. Got the shock of my life! I was walking along talking to   (.) Mika I think   (6.0) and it just shot up from in front of me, I had my foot out. It waited till the very last  second. 
*JAM:	 Mm.  Well that's 
*ANN:	I couldn't believe it! 
*JAM:	 ((sniff)) 
*ANN:	Perhaps it decided to stay put and I wouldn't notice it was there and maybe at the last second it decided it would   (.) run for it! 
*JAM:	Well we nearly   (.) when I was up with the children at the to   (.) when I was  (  )  
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JAM:	and it went up into those   (.) they were coming down in the minibus   (.) and er   (.) we stopped   (.) so the  I can't remember where we stopped. Anyway, it was a good job we did because these   (.) erm   (.) these grouse and these chickens, I mean, they were so blended in with the   (.) the, the   (.) roadside you could hardly see them, and then they moved. As we were coming down so slowly, and I think   (.) we stopped suddenly   (.) cos then they walked across the path. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAM:	You couldn't, you co  you couldn't see them when they were on the roadside, you know on, on the   (.) whe  when they  moved   
*ANN:	 Mm. 
*JAM:	onto the actual track like, so 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JAM:	And Joy got the red squirrel so, at er    (  )  (.) when I was out. 
*ANN:	Well Edith told me   (.) that  erm   
*JAM:	 Or  was it Kenneth saying? 
*ANN:	as soon as she bought her house   (.) do you know which is her house? 
*JAM:	Yes I've been to it. 
*ANN:	What did you go there for? 
*JAM:	To deliver something for you. (  )  
*ANN:	 Oh maybe, a Christmas   
*JAM:	 Can't remember what it was. 
*ANN:	card it would be. Cos that, the, you know  the le    
*JAM:	 But that's  not where we saw the red  squirrel. 
*ANN:	 you know  at the left hand side of her house they've planted some trees. 
*JAM:	That's out the back there. 
*ANN:	Yeah. But there was already   (.) no. It's at the   (.) oh! 
*JAM:	It's out the back. 
*ANN:	No, the back of her house opens   (.) has erm 
*JAM:	Goes out onto the spri  the spring head itself. 
*ANN:	The back of her house, the back garden   (.) erm, faces onto a field. There's the fence 
*JAM:	Mm. 
*ANN:	o  over the fence from that, er, the back garden   (.) is the field, but 
*JAM:	That leads over  to the   
*ANN:	  ((cough))  
*JAM:	other  side of the house. 
*ANN:	 but to the left  of their house, when you're facing the front door to the left 
*JAM:	 Whe  you mean when you're outside   
*ANN:	 the  there are some trees   
*JAM:	or inside? 
*ANN:	Outside. There are some erm   (.) trees there 
*JAM:	Mhm. 
*ANN:	there was already   (.) quite a few trees there, it was like a small wood   (.)  and they've plan  and   
*JAM:	 Well it is, that is. 
*ANN:	they've planted some extra ones. I think  they've planted some   
*JAM:	 That's the spring  (  ) . 
*ANN:	fruit trees. It's a huge garden!  So they've got a   
*JAM:	 But we were   
*ANN:	wood in it 
*JAM:	I know  but up there   
*ANN:	 but from the time they  moved in she noticed red squirrels. 
*JAM:	Oh we didn't walk that way, we went up   (.) further down.  And erm   
*ANN:	 I think  she said she'd seen a badger as well. 
*JAM:	Well it's quite possible, yeah. In the   (.) from there onwards, you know,we  there's nothing. 
*ANN:	No. 
*JAM:	You know,a  after  those houses   
*ANN:	 Yes I mean, that's right. 
*JAM:	th  er the, there's fields until you get to   (.) the Irish Sea, int there? Just about. 
*ANN:	Well yes. 
*JAM:	But there's a few odd houses, a few odd villages, which are only small, but there's nothing much really.  (6.0) When you re  walk, going west it's countryside all the way. 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*JAM:	Well 
*ANN:	She's gone to California, Edith. 
*JAM:	Has she? 
*ANN:	I met her   (.) erm 
*JAM:	On holiday? 
*ANN:	Yes. I don't know if she's gone alone or with some, or with a friend, but er   (.) she said she wanted to, she'd never been to California   (.) and she wanted to go   (.) before she was too   (.) old and crotchety to get there   (.) because David's   (.) he's in no fit state to go anywhere any more. 
*JAM:	So why, what
