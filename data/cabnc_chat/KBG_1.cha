@Comment:	conversation #1 (Tape 033601)
*SUS:	You've gotta carry it around with you. 
*CAR:	It's on volume ten. 
*SUS:	Well it says, like the microphone here look. You've got to   (.) put it at chest height 
*CAR:	Mm. 
*SUS:	make sure it's knocked or covered by clothing. Cos if you have to brush   (  ) it won't break the   (.) quality. If you're at home you can put the machine and microphone on the table near where it will still pick up conversation. Does that I mean work by a   (  ) from now on. 
*CAR:	Probably. 
*SUS:	Right   (.) right and giving things away. 
*CAR:	There's nothing to give  away. 
*SUS:	 Where's  your tapes? 
*CAR:	Yeah, there's a load of tapes! 
*SUS:	It's a lot isn't it? 
*CAR:	I think they're all   (.) I think they're ninety minutes. 
*SUS:	Ninety minutes on each tape!  Good grief! 
*CAR:	 Well forty   (  ) , I think they're  C nineties. 
*SUS:	 Well I can  talk the hind leg off a donkey, will   
*CAR:	 Oh   
*SUS:	all  that   
*CAR:	 God! 
*SUS:	 ((laughing))  (  ) ! 
*CAR:	Yes I know. 
*SUS:	It makes you feel very 
*CAR:	No, I don't think about it, just let it run. 
*SUS:	 Look at him!  Well I couldn't care cos I don't like taping   ((laughing)) so I shouldn't ! 
*CAR:	Well   (.) it's never stopped you before! 
*SUS:	 ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Mm. 
*SUS:	Not right now though. Oh! I've got a cup of tea. 
*CAR:	No, you were right what you said though about 
*SUS:	Mm. 
*CAR:	Matthew. 
*SUS:	Yeah I just   (.) it just seems to me such a complete   (.) and utter waste of of, his time primarily   (.) for fifteen, I mean this being identified a year earlier which   (.) we reckon it was   (.) you would think that   (.) even given   (.) all the red tape and everything else 
*CAR:	I'll have to look up his records  at least. 
*SUS:	 You know  it makes you   (.) well it makes you wonder whether   (.) something could be done without placing him, for his sake! Cos he's never gonna achieve anything in an ordinary class. He's just got such a downer on himself 
*CAR:	Mm. 
*SUS:	and he's he's got such a   (.) a negative   (.) way of looking at himself   (.) and everybody else looks at him that way now. Cos he he, he cannot be positive   (.) he contributes nothing! 
*CAR:	It's hard  being positive   
*SUS:	 In his own eyes. 
*CAR:	for him isn't it? 
*SUS:	Well it's, I mean I feel sorry for him   (.)  but having said   
*CAR:	 Well I do and I don't  sometimes. 
*SUS:	well having said that, although I feel sorry for him I get annoyed with him! 
*CAR:	Yes.  Like I said he's his own worst enemy! 
*SUS:	 Because he wastes everybody's  else's time. 
*CAR:	And everybody else is fed up with him! 
*SUS:	Well this is why I think he'd be better off,hi  his needs   (.) are not met by a class teacher. And I don't think they have been for this last 
*CAR:	Mm, we need a support teacher  to go there. 
*SUS:	 for the last  year. But yo  , you need somebody who's gonna work with him every day   (.) and   (.) with an individual programme and you just can't offer that   (.) in a class. 
*CAR:	Mm, it's difficult. 
*SUS:	The only way you can do that is if he goes to   (.) a special unit   (.) at Maidstone   (.)  and works   
*CAR:	 Well I don't  think there's provision for him now you see because it's  a   
*SUS:	 Mm. 
*CAR:	there's a term and a half left before he moves on. 
*SUS:	Well this, this is what I'm saying, if it had been picked up   (.) and followed through   (.) at an earlier stage he would have been  ensconced   
*CAR:	 Oh yeah  , well there must have  been   
*SUS:	 and   
*CAR:	a problem identified earlier on  but er   
*SUS:	 Oh!  Well I think so   (.) I think it's been identified but I don't think it's been followed through. 
*CAR:	Well, it's like so many other things isn't it? 
*SUS:	Yeah, that's always the way though innit?  (6.0) I just   (  ) cos when I see children like that   (.) and you know there's nothing you can really do for them, you can't make up for the fact   (.) that they've got a rotten home life and that's   (.) top and bottom line that's what it is! 
*CAR:	Yeah. 
*SUS:	You're trying to be everything   (.) and they're pushing it away cos it's not what they really want   (.) and they, I mean, all, all you can get from him is how marvellous, you're right, how marvellous his brothers are   (.) and yet, what I've heard of the brothers they're not 
*CAR:	Not much, yeah. 
*SUS:	 they're  not all that marvellous, they're not really that much to look  up   
*CAR:	 Ah. 
*SUS:	to. 
*CAR:	No 
*SUS:	And they, they've 
*CAR:	role model is it, really? 
*SUS:	No. I suppose marvellous to the wrong things! Oh well! And he he was   (.)  talking   
*CAR:	 Was  anything else   (.) said or acted upon or   (.) shall I use the kids who are done today ooh,tha  that   (  ) should be   (.) done. 
*SUS:	No. I don't  think so. 
*CAR:	 Done today? 
*SUS:	No. No I said erm   (.) I had a conversation with Gillian about reading, about little bits of reading   (.) and, I made the point that we'd said last night about him barking at print, reading through words that he didn't know   (.) and not asking what they were   (.) and she said she'd noticed that. And, cos we had a bit of a laugh about it, I don't know what I'm telling you about it for cos you hear him read anyway! But she said yes, she'd noticed, but she said they are getting more out of this   (.) Johnny Briggs book   (.) than the other book. 
*CAR:	Mhm. 
*SUS:	So she's quite pleased   (.) that she's put them on to it, it is difficult. 
*CAR:	  (  ) brilliant! 
*SUS:	Sorry? 
*CAR:	Nothing. 
*SUS:	Mm. And I saw Mrs   
*CAR:	Oh yes? 
*SUS:	in the bank, I went up to the  bank   
*CAR:	 And  what did she have to say for herself? 
*SUS:	She's alright. I just don't feel that   (.) you know, she's basically taken Robert back last night, that was very kind of her and all that, she said oh it's been nice to have him and   (.) erm   (.) but er   (.) Oliver and Robert had got on really well   (.) and erm    (.)  ((yawning)) that's all really . 
*CAR:	Are you still working? 
*SUS:	 ((laughing)) Yeah ! 
*CAR:	It's  alright   
*SUS:	 Er   
*CAR:	it's just some noise I heard on the tape. 
*SUS:	oh and we were jus   (.) well we just sort of cha  , I was just talking about the weather, she was saying how cold it was. And erm   (.) and I made the point that I   (.) tipped all your lot out of I said what and    (.) I hadn't let them go in the classroom and I said it's a new thing but   (.) I said they got their coats on   (.) they're too macho to wear them that's their problem, you know! They've got their coats in school. But we   (.) they were very good about going out, I'm not going up to her again! She's just gonna have to cry herself to sleep I'm afraid. I've  just   
*CAR:	 Mm. 
*SUS:	had enough of her now! She's tired, she's had a busy day, so 
*CAR:	When was she last asleep? 
*SUS:	Erm   (.) just before I came in from school   (.) and we were home by about half three. But she's ready to go off really, she probably would have done if Robert hadn't tipped the milk everywhere! 
*CAR:	Was she  asleep by then? 
*SUS:	 And then ranted  and raved cos she probably just about going off then, you see it woke her up all the fuss and  kerfuffle! 
*CAR:	 Mm. 
*SUS:	I was so mad with him for doing it!  (6.0)  So silly! 
*CAR:	 The trials  and tribulations of a family life! 
*SUS:	Mm. Trials and tribulations! I tell you a   (.) ou   (.) I said today when I was in school   (.) cos that's like being at home with my three year old, it was just like that today being stuck in there! 
*CAR:	I'll just go up and see to her. 
*SUS:	Alright. And try and sort her out.  (58.0) Where's your   (.) bit of paper then you have to fill in on this? About where you're   (.) working and what you're doing and   (.) who you're doing it with   (.) and how often! 
*CAR:	The log book? 
*SUS:	Yeah, ((laughing)) that's the word !  Ha! 
*CAR:	 The    (.) the log  book! 
*SUS:	 Near  the dictionary, yeah. 
*CAR:	I   
*SUS:	 (  )  (.) there's quite a few questions innit? 
*CAR:	You get   (.) a conversation record booklet, tapes one to ten. 
*SUS:	 Where's your  (  ) ?  Sorry that was the one I was looking for. 
*CAR:	Each side covers one side, forty five minutes of a ninety minute tape. 
*SUS:	Mind you, there's been a great pause on it while you went to see to the  baby. 
*CAR:	 Mm.  So then they're all the details, and there's examples and 
*SUS:	So, you're gonna take that out with you tomorrow? When we go and buy the corn and er   (.) goat mix? 
*CAR:	I could do. 
*SUS:	I'm just trying to think where you   (.) what you're gonna do when I have my, have my hair cut? 
*CAR:	I don't know. I'll find something. 
*SUS:	I'll be about an hour   (.) I reckon. I must find that photo as well. The erm   (.) take it with me.  (7.0) I feel I should be all philosophical and   (.) start   ((laughing)) spouting! (  ) ! 
*CAR:	What about? 
*SUS:	I dunno. It sounds good. 
*CAR:	I'm spouted out I think! 
*SUS:	I told you that I was punned today didn't I?  I'd   
*CAR:	 Mm. 
*SUS:	suddenly forgotten, it suddenly just   (.) it just didn't   (.) twig with them at all. 
*CAR:	They didn't laugh when he mentioned then? 
*SUS:	Yeah they   (.) they groaned at the ones we'd come up with   (.) but when it came to making their own up 
*CAR:	And they  couldn't. 
*SUS:	 they'd  come out with half of one, they'd come out with things like   (.) I think you're   (.) er   (.) I dunno   (.) er, not barking up the wrong tree that was the wrong one, but   (.) the  they'd sort of come out with half of a pun and they wouldn't finish it off, like oh th  , this is smashing! Sa  , and I'd say   (.) yeah but that's not a pun   (.) that's only a pun if you   (.) if you write down this is smashing   (.) said   (.) erm   (.) the robber or the smash and grab, in other words the window fell in, that kind of thing, you know. 
*CAR:	Well anyway how do  , does that link with sea  (.)  
*SUS:	Well   (.)  we had to   
*CAR:	  ((laughing)) words ? 
*SUS:	we, no we broaden it   (.) i  i  , they they just couldn't manage on the sea ones   (  ) . 
*CAR:	 Cor there's  loads! 
*SUS:	Oh they couldn't si  , yeah don't forget yo  , well I don't know why I'm telling you, but, you know your ri  , your age range. They managed to get some   (.) ones on the sea, but they did have a try   (.) erm   (.) a lot of them come up with the erm   (.) barking up the wrong tree said the dog, you know, things like that   (.) with a bit of help. 
*CAR:	Yeah. 
*SUS:	Erm   (.) there's another one that a lot of came up with   (.) one or two had heard   (.) a few before   (.) and they all groaned and then accused you of making them all up! I said, no, actually   ((laughing)) but that's always a lie ! 
*CAR:	Oh I thought you might say that! 
*SUS:	So they all laughed  at   
*CAR:	 Mm. 
*SUS:	that and then   (.) but that was quite hard really! When I think about it they did ha  erm, but I'm fed up with talking about school! Let's talk   ((laughing)) about something else ! 
*CAR:	School's banned now is it? 
*SUS:	Yeah. 
*CAR:	I don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. 
*SUS:	What a wicked dog!  ((laugh))  (.)  ((laughing)) Oh God ! 
*CAR:	You're gasping for air are you? 
*SUS:	Cor blimey! I don't know what my mother's fed that dog   ((laughing)) today , but   (.) it's certainly repeating on him tonight! 
*CAR:	Mm. Kick him out then. 
*SUS:	Mm, he's laying there pretending it's not him, look! ((laugh))  
*CAR:	Get him off that  carpet! 
*SUS:	 Oh  dear! Oh Laura   (.)  I must just   
*CAR:	 Get him off  the carpet! 
*SUS:	I must just tell you this, Laura did make me laugh, cos she said   (.) she stood up and she said, I'm gonna give my talk about cats   (.) so I said, fine. She said, and I'm gonna talk about my cat Ginger and my brother's car  an  , and my brother's Barney, oh by the way Barney's dead!  ((laughing)) So she just carried on ! 
*CAR:	 ((yawning)) Oh , that's the end of that    ((laughing)) conversation ! 
*SUS:	  ((laughing))  (  ) !  But she spoke of   (.) and she kept  speaking about him being   
*CAR:	 So matter of fact. 
*SUS:	in the   (.) she kept speaking about him as tho  , as though he was all, you know, still alright, and that was just so funny the way she said it and I thought I mustn't laugh cos that   (.) er,i  she doesn't intend to be funny with it at all! That was quite good, in fact, she'll have   
*CAR:	 Oh. 
*SUS:	 (  ) talking about school! 
*CAR:	Yeah. 
*SUS:	Oh! Oh! Oh! School's banned! 
*CAR:	They're doing some good things at weekend.

*SUS:	 Yeah. 
*CAR:	this Head 
*SUS:	They like him? 
*CAR:	and there are those who   (.) think this new one's 
*SUS:	Too   (.) too squeaky! To squeaky   (  ) ? 
*CAR:	 gone in  , no no no, she's just gone in and er   (.) doing too much too soon, yeah, yeah. They're a very established staff  you know   
*SUS:	 Well it's   
*CAR:	there's not been much  change   
*SUS:	 Yeah  I see it, over that, I mean that's Suffolk all over isn't it, really for you? Th  they si  they sit and look at change for  ten   
*CAR:	 Mm. 
*SUS:	years and then they think, yeah we might do something   ((laughing)) and then they actually go out and  do it ! 
*CAR:	 Yeah  , watching the grass grow is pretty 
*SUS:	Yeah. 
*CAR:	dramatic down here! 
*SUS:	Sometimes it can be, yeah. Yeah, it's interesting though! 
*CAR:	I mean, it looks nice it's   (.) see I'm impressed with her   (.) I must admit, impressed with her. 
*SUS:	It looks better  than it did. 
*CAR:	 And the  decor. 
*SUS:	Well that'll totally depress Terry   ((laughing)) if he goes there then  won't it? (  )  
*CAR:	But theirs is bigger, they've got a pottery room, they've got careers education there 
*SUS:	Yeah, (  )   
*CAR:	 they've got two  classes, they're looking to the  library. 
*SUS:	 Yeah but  I mean yours is   (.) a big school now  isn't it? 
*CAR:	 Well ours  has got   (.) loads more pupils than theirs! 
*SUS:	And they've just got more  room haven't they? 
*CAR:	 They've got, they've   
*SUS:	Yeah, well they've got an old secondary modern  school there. 
*CAR:	 Well it's the old  six, yeah that's right. 
*SUS:	That's why. 
*CAR:	 Oh   
*SUS:	 I  mean they've got the facilities  purposely built   
*CAR:	 Cor, too right! 
*SUS:	really, that's   (.) that'd  be lovely! 
*CAR:	 It's ideal!  I mean, we should have their site. 
*SUS:	Yeah. It's like the girls said to me today, erm   (.) just before the end of   (.) I'm doing it again! But anyway, just before the end of the morning, they said erm   (.) could we practise our talks on each other, and there was only ten minutes left so I said, yes   (.) and they said well can we go somewhere quiet? And the only way   (.) place I could   (.) think to send them was the girls' changing room! 
*CAR:	Oh. 
*SUS:	There wasn't anywhere else! 
*CAR:	Wasn't it? 
*SUS:	Cos the library was being used 
*CAR:	it was a  quiet   
*SUS:	 the hall  was, they're getting ready for  lunch   
*CAR:	 yeah  it was a quiet joke at the staff meeting that er 
*SUS:	you know and 
*CAR:	my office is er   (.) gonna be taken over   (.) because they need the extra toilets! 
*SUS:	Ha! 
*CAR:	I would say oh they do for these extra classroom  they're gonna   
*SUS:	 Well you ma   ah, made me laugh when you just sit there in that corner   (.) doing paperwork! Like when you were in the other week and I was taking that class 
*CAR:	I don't normally sit there. 
*SUS:	Well it was just so funny, it's just the kind of place you'd expect to see naughty   ((laughing)) boys, there was you sitting to the 
*CAR:	Yeah, but I was quiet, I  was hardly   
*SUS:	 marking  papers , you know! (  )   
*CAR:	 Well there aren't any other  places! 
*SUS:	Oh I know! 
*CAR:	I mean Terry said I could use his office but 
*SUS:	You feel as though it's 
*CAR:	he keeps coming in and 
*SUS:	ah, it feels 
*CAR:	and the secretary's knocking on the door, the telephone rings, and   (.) I got a bit of work done. 
*SUS:	that's inhibiting as well isn't it? And it's almost like   (.) crowding somebody's personal space   (.) if you go in their office. And, I feel that when I go in your room now   (.) very much that it is your room, and I feel the same when I go in Glenys's, it's her room 
*CAR:	Well   (.) I mean that  should be   
*SUS:	 and you're  a visitor there which is   (.)  as it should be. 
*CAR:	 it shouldn't be after, what  , seven years? 
*SUS:	Yeah. But that's just it. 
*CAR:	Never been painted, never been clean and tidy. 
*SUS:	Ah but   (.) but it's, it's all to do with   (.) having your own personal space I think. 
*CAR:	Yeah, be o  , interesting if they are. 
*SUS:	Cos mum made me laugh tonight   (.) but she came in and   (.) she said oh you can have a hot cross bun there, I said well   (.) I think I'll have a piece of chocolate cake and she said   (.) alright then! I said, oh I'm glad you approve being as though it's mine and it's   ((laughing)) my house, I can eat what I want! And she'd just totally forgotten ! 
*CAR:	Mm.  Comfortable   
*SUS:	 So   
*CAR:	you see. 
*SUS:	i  , it was really quite funny! But   (.) you   (  ) cos she'd said    (.)   (  )   
*CAR:	  ((cough))  
*SUS:	looking after the littlest ones all day and   (.) and she's obviously been speaking to them like that  during   
*CAR:	 Ah. 
*SUS:	the day and   (.) got this   (.) that's like your grandma did that with erm   (.) with June   (.) once  or   
*CAR:	 Yeah. 
*SUS:	twice. And June wanted to go out and yo  , your granny said   (.) make sure you're   ((laughing)) back before midnight ! 
*CAR:	 Mm. 
*SUS:	 There  she was    (.)  ((laughing)) a married woman with a 
*CAR:	She's a right wally? 
*SUS:	mm   (.) kids  as well! 
*CAR:	 They  assume an awful lot man. 
*SUS:	Yeah. 
*CAR:	The elderly do. 
*SUS:	The wrinklies, now there's a word! In common   ((laughing)) usage, the wrinklies ! 
*CAR:	Yeah. 
*SUS:	As the children   (.) so sweetly call them! 
*CAR:	Oh, woe betide anybody who calls me one! 
*SUS:	Yeah, I know. I've seen so many grey hairs  (  ) .  ((laughing)) Am I a wrinkly yet ? Is this the sign of   (.) wrinklydom!  ((laughing)) You know ! 
*CAR:	 ((laughing)) Wrinkly ! Wrinklydom. There such  a   
*SUS:	 Oh. 
*CAR:	word? 
*SUS:	I dunno, erm   (.)  don't think there's such a   
*CAR:	 There ought to be! 
*SUS:	as wrin  , now I know where that's come from. 
*CAR:	What wrinkly? 
*SUS:	Naff, as well, is another word   (.) that the kids use a lot. It's really naff! 
*CAR:	No, I think that's  passed out   
*SUS:	  (  )  
*CAR:	now. 
*SUS:	They don't like   (.)  (  ) . 
*CAR:	It's out of  
*SUS:	What was that word that erm   (.) Ebony   was, used? And I   (.) wa  commented on it   (.) to you, it was when I borrowed   (.) the maternity robe from Penny   (.)  and she   
*CAR:	  (  )  
*SUS:	said one, talking about one of the dresses   (.) and that meant it was really awful and I can't think  what

*CAR:	 Yeah. 
*SUS:	nearly all American, the cartoons. 
*CAR:	Yes it's a   (.) hundred and forty four isn't it, a gross? 
*SUS:	Yeah. Suppose so. 
*CAR:	With the old numbers. 
*SUS:	Yeah. I don't remember using that. Ace, was the word   (.) that we used a lot.

*CAR:	Carbon dates, you! 
*SUS:	 Oh  no chance! Makes me seem ever so old! 
*CAR:	Oh. 
*SUS:	Looking round at people today and   (.) you mi  , try to imagine them   (.) in their own home setting   (.) you know? And what they're like   (.) out of work   (.) you know? It's   (.) I mean it's   (.) it's difficult to picture people anywhere other than where you actually meet them at work. I can't im  , with not knowing where they live, I mean I can't envisage where   (.) what kind of houses  I mean   
*CAR:	  ((cough))  
*SUS:	some of them   (.) have got, some  (  ) .  (6.0) Quite interesting. Oh. Are we gonna watch Victoria Wood at nine?

*SUS:	Good Guys, it gets more of   (.) outrageous every week, you can't believe a word of it! There's no plot to it at all, it's   (.) it's just so farfetched! 
*CAR:	Well then   (.) we'll watch Victoria Wood then. 
*SUS:	Oh!  ((laughing)) Alright then ! 
*CAR:	If you want to watch it now darling. 
*SUS:	Well I mean I've watched that   (.) the Good Guides    (.)  ((laughing)) Guys ! 
*CAR:	They're the Good Guides! 
*SUS:	 ((laughing)) The guys !  I watched the   
*CAR:	 Put your teeth in. 
*SUS:	Good Guys sa   (.) a couple of times and     (.)  (  )  (.) whether it was gonna improve or not   (.) but it hasn't!  ((laugh))  (.) Been waiting for it to get better every week  and it   
*CAR:	 Well this  could be the episode! 
*SUS:	And you've missed it! 
*CAR:	Yeah! 
*SUS:	Cos we've been watching the repeat of Victoria  Wood! 
*CAR:	 Oh  yeah, if we see 
*SUS:	Why is that Care Bear down there, has she had it out the bath? 
*CAR:	Probably. 
*SUS:	 (  ) difficult to sleep innit? 
*CAR:	No, you tell them, I'm fed up of telling kids off today! 
*SUS:	You haven't had any to look after today! None of your kids! 
*CAR:	This week I have. 
*SUS:	Mm. I didn't have no    (  )  (.) didn't have any complaints at dinner time, (  )   
*CAR:	  ((yawning)) Oh   I don't care Sue, I'm not bothered. 
*SUS:	Mm. That's alright then.  (6.0) Oh one of the hens got   (.) erm   (.) landed on the top of the black net   (.) cos I   (.) I'd put some   (.) corn and stuff in you see   (.) and she landed on it   (.) and she got her feet stuck through netting   (.) so she was flapping and the net was just going   ((laughing)) up and down ! 
*CAR:	It's quite er 
*SUS:	No   (.) that, that'll give way, that will be alright. Now as she, I flapped it, I got hold of it and I flapped it so it, I sort of bounced about, she sort of bumped along   
*CAR:	 Yeah, you have to. 
*SUS:	until she got onto that crossbar   (.) and then she just flew straight back and did exactly the same thing all over again and I just thought   (.) sod it! I left her on there! 
*CAR:	Yeah. 
*SUS:	And that she'll just have to take a chance tonight. Cos she saw me putting the corn in and she decided she'd try and get it   (.) by diving through the black net   (.) instead of going through the gate, like with a normal hen, you know, this one's obviously brain   (.) dead or 
*CAR:	They are stupid that lot! 
*SUS:	They are silly! Mum said they'd been all over today! Dad opened the front door and he said there was a troop of them walking up the path! He said, he just said get out of it!  ((laughing)) They all we  , turned round and went the other way again ! 
*CAR:	 ((laugh))  (.) Surprising that he'd talked back to them, yes. 
*SUS:	Yeah. But the  , I mean I came home and they were under the hedge   (.) they weren't going through but   (.) there's a big piece of netting   (.) has come down   (.) and it needs   (.) erm   (.) stitching up and then it needs   (.) sewing, not sewing   (.)  erm   
*CAR:	 That's  alright, if it's fine let me do that. 
*SUS:	i  , but it needs two of us, it needs somebody on the inside and somebody on the out   (.) just to stop them flying   (.) through it. Cos the, the the the cock was on the back door this morning, crowing! 
*CAR:	Somebody there was crowing   (.) at about half past twelve, quarter to one this morning! There were two of them crowing their heads off! 
*SUS:	Oh I never heard them 
*CAR:	Yes! 
*SUS:	Oh God we'll be popular round here won't we? 
*CAR:	That's what I thought. 
*SUS:	I never heard them Carl! 
*CAR:	I mean you're not locking him in any more are you? You're not shutting the door. 
*SUS:	Well I   (.) I hadn't been shutting the one   (.) that don't make no difference still, there's only   (.) cos Pavarotti's out anyway! Cos he he won't    (.)   (  )   
*CAR:	 Yeah but  you don't let the other two, I mean   (.)  it's   
*SUS:	 I  ought to   (.) perhaps we ought to start closing them in  again then that'll keep   
*CAR:	 Yeah, perhaps you ought to. 
*SUS:	them quiet. But the trouble was   (.) with closing them in, not so much on the  (  ) , but on the old flock   (.) it was so warped, the wood with being damp and wet and frosty   (.) it was freezing across every night and it was nearly taking my fingers off 
*CAR:	Mm. 
*SUS:	getting it open in the morning, that really hurt! 
*CAR:	 Well put a little  loo  loop or something there. 
*SUS:	It's too, too rotten, the wood. But I've got, what I've gotta do is repair that other coop 
*CAR:	Mm. 
*SUS:	and get that there and then it'll be a lot easier   (.) cos mum said she struggled today to get in that door   (.) of the  (  ) , I said well what do you go in there for? And she was going in for eggs or something, said well I usually leave them a day or two in the winter cos it doesn't hurt   (.) and she said she struggled and struggled with that door! She said it hasn't got any    (.)  (  ) at the minute! I said, well no cos it was on, like strings   (.) but er that does need fixing. But it's just been too wet and too nasty to do anything about it so   (.) when we've got a chance we'll have to really do. She said she's   ((laughing)) looking forward to the day that we get it fixed ! Said, oh I'm sorry mum, I'll go and get you some eggs! Cos they are quite tame, I mean that's one thing about the hens   (.) I mean   (.) they can't come out though, they just wander about. And it   (.) but the erm   (.) the goats apparently were no problem today, they just stayed on and   (.) gave them a few bits and pieces you know   (.) so    (.)  ((yawning)) that was fair enough . Oh, I wish she'd hurry up and go to sleep! 
*CAR:	I think I'll have to put her down again then. 
*SUS:	Put her down! 
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SUS:	I can't understand it! I mean she's   (.) she's been up   (.) and been busy and   (.) she's had a warm bath and she's had a bottle of 
*CAR:	She'll start this caper again though! 
*SUS:	Yeah, coming in at night. I wo  , well she was awake in the middle of the night, I don't know what time it was but all I could hear was mummy, mummy, mummy! 
*CAR:	 Why didn't  you just put her back   (.) into bed! 
*SUS:	And I lay her down and she bawls! 
*CAR:	Well it doesn't matter! I didn't hear her! 
*SUS:	Well, I heard her! And I feel really guilty, I think oh I better bring her in   (.) and then she wakes me up at six o'clock bouncing on the bed! So   (.) And o  , also   (.) when it's the day before I, I'm working   (.) I'm very conscience that I don't want her to be upset in the morning, same with Christopher   (.) I don't want any upsets in the morning. I don't want her frazzled   (.) and I don't want him upset in the morning cos I wanna   (.) go out and have a nice   (.) even keel then 
*CAR:	Mm. 
*SUS:	and not have to worry that   (.) they're er   (.) gonna be a problem for  mum   
*CAR:	 Yeah. 
*SUS:	to look after you see, so   (.) I think if that's the price we gotta pay if it's   (.) a choice between  tha    
*CAR:	 Oh yes! 
*SUS:	putting up with that   (.) and me not going out   (.) then I'm afraid we'll just have to put up with it! Cos it's   (.) it's too   (.) erm   (.) expensive to do otherwise. That's what I reckon anyway.  (6.0) Aren't you gonna turn that off yet? 
*CAR:	No, we'll let the first side run. 
*SUS:	Are we?  We'll   
*CAR:	 Mm. 
*SUS:	play it up   (  ) later on! 
*CAR:	 ((laughing)) You're doing very well thank you ! 
*SUS:	 ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	I think I've only said about three words in   (.) you're doing all the chatting. 
*SUS:	Well you can't get a word in edgeways   (.) can't you? 
*CAR:	No. I'm used to it! 
*SUS:	No you're not! Oh well of course that's making me have a parched throat you know, so you're gonna have to ma  , go and make me a cup of tea! Please? 
*CAR:	No, you're making me one. 
*SUS:	Oh go on! 
*CAR:	No. 
*SUS:	Why's that pendulum blue? 
*CAR:	Oh, pass! I've no idea. Pendulum why are you blue? 
*SUS:	 ((laughing)) I don't know    (.)  said the pendulum! 
*CAR:	 I don't know dear!  I don't know. 
*SUS:	We've got big cobwebs up there and all! 
*CAR:	Don't tell   ((laughing)) everybody our secrets ! 
*SUS:	 ((laugh))  (.) Sorry! Oh dear! It's quite a surprise! Mm. 
*CAR:	 ((whistling)) Yeah. 
*SUS:	This is what could be termed in   (  ) as a    (.)  ((laughing)) a pregnant pause ! 
*CAR:	 ((yawning)) Oh! Level four, attainment target two it'll be .  ((yawning)) Oh, oh I dunno ! You get gobble-eyed looking at all those dockets. 
*SUS:	Well I had a quick look at them. Oh no, you're doing it again, you're talking about school! We can't talk about school, it's boring    (  )   
*CAR:	 No, I'm gasping for a  cup of tea! 
*SUS:	What are we gonna do now? Well if I go through now she's just   (.) quietened again   (.) just wait until sh  , there's no noise at all from up there, give it another ten minutes. 
*CAR:	Okay. 
*SUS:	Then   (.) and then I think hopefully she'll settle. Has she got a dolly in her cot with her?  (6.0) She does like that so   (.) we'll have to go and get Christopher's present won't we? On Monday.  (6.0) Still seems quite keen on a   (.)  train   
*CAR:	 Yes  he does seem   (.) keen on the railway track. 
*SUS:	Anything, apart from get away from tractors for a bit! 
*CAR:	Trouble is, is the floor space, he puts it out and   (.) gets stood on. 
*SUS:	Yeah. We'll have to encourage him to put in on the table. 
*CAR:	Mm, scratch the table, yeah! 
*SUS:	 Mm.  Oh he's, oh dad's buying a sander did I tell you? No I didn't. Dad's buying a sander. Cos he said to me, he said don't rush in to stripping that table cos he's gonna buy a sander   (.) to keep  his   (  )   
*CAR:	 Did you tell him we were gonna  do the table? 
*SUS:	Yep. He said leave it don't do it yet. I said, well we hadn't intended doing it yet cos the children being so young   (.) that er   (.) that's what he needs. And he said to me, he said if you hang on   (.) erm, he said you can borrow it   (.) and sand it all down, you know? So, I thought that was   (.)  nice of him. 
*CAR:	 It'll be nice  that. 
*SUS:	Yeah. I thought it was a good idea. But you know, until then I think we're gonna have to make it that the railway goes on the table, she ju  , she doesn't see it Carl, she just   (.) when she  broke that   
*CAR:	 Yes I know. 
*SUS:	that combine, the   (  ) she just trod on it but she never saw it! 
*CAR:	 ((laughing)) Big yellow thing ! 
*SUS:	Green actually. 
*CAR:	Green, is it? 
*SUS:	Yeah but 
*CAR:	Oh it's  the tractor   
*SUS:	 he left   
*CAR:	that's yellow. 
*SUS:	he left it you see, but I mean   (.) she doesn't know it's   (.) ah she's, she's like Robert, Robert used to walk through things instead of round them. I can remember him doing that   (.) way back, when he was this age. She's gonna be like Robert, I reckon she'll be 
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SUS:	 ((laughing)) that kind of temperament   (  ) ! What have we let ourselves  in for! 
*CAR:	 Another  one! 
*SUS:	Another Robert, aye? It's not too bad I suppose. Could do a lot worse  (  ) . Oh I don't like that woman over there.  (6.0) And  (  ) .  ((laughing)) Why are you looking at me like that ? Well that reminds me of Robert that picture. 
*CAR:	 ((cough))  (.) Before or after a disaster? 
*SUS:	 ((laughing)) No ! 
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SUS:	Oh it's, he's a walking landmine isn't he? 
*CAR:	Bless his heart! Just like you he is! 
*SUS:	I know he is, ((laughing)) that's why I get so irritated with him  cos I see my failings in him so clearly! And his, his left hand doesn't know what his right leg is doing! Terrible!  (7.0) He doesn't seem to re   (.) relax either   (.) in friendship anyway so 
*CAR:	No, he's doing alright.
