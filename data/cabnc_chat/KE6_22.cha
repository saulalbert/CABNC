*WEN:	Well I should make your mind up Bev, here and now. •110578_110926•
        You really must! •111043_111125•
        If you prefer not I'll, I'll say •111218_111422•
*BEV:	No! •111422_111436•
        I want it! •111495_111549•
*WEN:	I know you want it Bev but it's no good getting yourself uptight! •111549_111848•
        It's no good at all! •111903_111982•
        No good at all! •112004_112288•
        Just waffle on and be done . •112330_112933•
        It's to be expected really. •113273_113446•
*BEV:	Yeah, but then  fifty nine thirty two. •113502_113789•
*WEN:	What? •113789_113820•
*BEV:	Well that's erm  cheque erm    . •113996_114216•
        Well that's what I was waiting for weren't it? •114622_114723•
        And then I'll get my old  fixed. •114723_114853•
*WEN:	Well no, you must make your mind up  love. •114918_115860•
*BEV:	Real last. •115860_115907•
*WEN:	Yay or nay I mean there's only a , what is the thing you don't know how to do? •115907_116132•
*BEV:	Well, the word processing. •116312_116432•
        But that's not it, •116432_116504•
*WEN:	What is it then? •116615_116651•
        I mean, it seem to me it would be an ideal one  if  •116705_116959•
*BEV:	Well it would! •116959_117008•
*WEN:	if, if, from what she says. •117025_117171•
*BEV:	It would! •117171_117198•
*WEN:	So you take the bull by the horns or you don't! •117364_117573•
*BEV:	Yeah. •117674_117678•
*WEN:	Or you don't. •117678_118072•
        But if if let it get you down then you don't. •118072_118247•
*BEV:	It hasn't got me down. •118358_118547•
*WEN:	Mhm. •118660_118672•
        Well that's what it is, apprehension's made that happen. •118672_118974•
*BEV:	Yeah. •119420_119469•
*WEN:	Certainly. •119475_119488•
*BEV:	And you don't want that . •119501_129799•
*WEN:	Well, I say, he tend to go at eleven and three, so think about it. •129799_130014•
*BEV:	Yeah, you're right. •130014_130047•
        You see it's not really for me to do. •130047_130150•
*WEN:	I mean, from the sound of it she's  answers the telephone, does a bit of typing and  •130150_130419•
*BEV:	That girl in there though? •130419_130470•
*WEN:	Mm. •130470_130482•
        Does a bit of typing. •130482_130578•
*BEV:	Oh I want it! •130578_130642•
        Don't get me wrong. •130643_130713•
*WEN:	So why not? •130741_130807•
*BEV:	But you gotta expect, there's bound to be a bit of apprehension. •130807_131122•
*WEN:	I understand that totally. •131201_131435•
        But I think it's take the bull by the horns •131435_131652•
*BEV:	Oh yeah, •131652_131702•
*WEN:	and I mean let's face it  you might not like it! •131702_131943•
        You might not  you might get there and you might say  oh I don't like this! •131943_132297•
        But that can be the same anywhere couldn't it? •132399_132696•
*BEV:	Yeah! •132714_132743•
*WEN:	If you come up my place. •132814_132913•
        Which I'm sure you wouldn't like would you? •133211_133392•
*BEV:	Ha! •133392_133399•
        Okay I'm going out now. •133402_133731•
*WEN:	Well I suppose if you want to  work  then the first one is    •133731_134114•
*BEV:	The first ones always can be the worst one! •134220_134423•
*WEN:	Ay? •134454_134487•
*BEV:	Well, the first one's always gonna be the worst one! •134535_134820•
*WEN:	Mm! •134820_134831•
        Certainly is! •135032_135090•
        But I say, I'm sure your capable of taking the bull by the horns. •135186_135484•
*BEV:	Oh God, yeah! •135490_135542•
        I've done it before it's just I haven't done it for so long! •135542_135739•
*WEN:	Oh well! •135739_135772•
        I mean er  that's why I never done the  yesterday. •135849_136271•
        I mean, it's not that she's probably gonna go after it but  I, you know, who knows! •136271_136629•
        I mean they know up there because of the, of theirs. •136629_136890•
        But they'll probably  rather annoying at the moment. •136905_137099•
        Innit? •137099_137135•
*BEV:	Yeah. •137135_137144•
*WEN:	Well I think it's   If you want it. •137144_138260•
*BEV:	Oh, I'll be alright now. •138260_138656•
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	I shall be alright now cos of Val. •138715_138986•
*WEN:	Yes, that's right. •139044_139135•
        I mean, as I say, you might get there and you might hate it anyway. •139228_139492•
*BEV:	Yeah, I might not even get it  •139517_139601•
*WEN:	No. •139655_139692•
        No, another he said was that bloke came in later. •139912_140204•
        What was that man's name? •140213_140360•
*BEV:	Clive    •140360_140379•
*WEN:	Clive? •140422_140452•
        Clive? •140490_140534•
*BEV:	I dunno, it was either Clive or Richard I think. •140623_141036•
*WEN:	I mean unless they get a temp from an agency  they gonna want somebody aren't they? •141582_142043•
*BEV:	Yeah. •142046_142082•
*WEN:	Sounds to me as though they're just  sell stuff, I I don't know! •142138_142594•
        But it sounds to me as though it's taking something off the telephone, which is simple innit? •142780_143155•
*BEV:	Yeah. •143161_143183•
*WEN:	And erm  a bit of  couple of letters typed. •143232_143527•
        I mean, the at the least you could go and have a look I suppose if •143613_143918•
*BEV:	Is it somewhere ? •143927_144103•
*WEN:	He never said. •144181_144249•
        He honestly never said. •144256_144600•
        It seemed to me it were the type of place you could sit and do your knitting. •144600_145417•
*BEV:	Yeah. •145452_145482•
*WEN:	If she's sat watching them   she's pregnant but  if she'd have sat watching Neighbours  and she weren't able to    was she ? •145494_146702•
        And he did say to me  well he has spoken to me about it, he did say answering  the telephone. •146926_147558•
        He said that. •147590_147662•
*BEV:	Mm. •147847_147862•
*WEN:	As I say, I've only met her the once. •147862_148004•
        And she come up in the car for him once. •148122_148311•
        But I mean the first step is always the hardest. •148686_148858•
        I mean, if  that don't only apply to you. •148858_149072•
*BEV:	No. •149072_149082•
*WEN:	But er  if you want it and it's  then  no harm in going and having a look! •149231_149962•
        Is there? •150113_150141•
        Like I say, the choice is yours hundred percent! •150307_150476•
        You don't have to. •150476_150527•
*BEV:	I want it but •150527_150870•
*WEN:	Well the butt of it then has gotta be go over. •150879_151260•
*BEV:	Mm. •151319_151328•
*WEN:	I mean if, if she wanted you to go out there today, just if  then the sensible is to pick up a taxi. •151418_151967•
*BEV:	Yeah. •152016_152049•
        Well, then I know where it is. •152144_152244•
*WEN:	Certainly! •152302_152335•
        I mean I went, I'm if it's the place where we said it is  then, I mean it  I know we went through Thicket , yes I do! •152335_153102•
        Cos I saw their horses and which I think are Moira's. •153191_153409•
        But I mean  you know what I'm like in a car I just sit there and then then  your father turned in  and there was all these, where we went to get the carpet, you know? •153498_154278•
        And that is as much as I can  sort of remember. •154278_154723•
        But I really don't take much notice  anyway, sat in a car. •154760_155118•
*BEV:	No. •155118_155126•
*WEN:	I don't. •155126_155220•
        Still as I say, no,it's, it's a fair comment to say it's to be expected. •155220_156189•
        But if you can overcome that  you know, by saying ah what the hell! •156288_156684•
        It's either this or nothing which, which it is  and if you want it  I mean Lesley's not bothered about it cos he's giving her seven hundred quid a blooming  month! •156684_157536•
        Well neither would you if , somebody give you seven hundred quid a month! •157536_157767•
        Neither would I! •157832_157907•
        For God's sake! •158059_158114•
        I wouldn't get up at six, put the washing out and then go up there! •158114_158378•
*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Thinking . •158590_158612•
*BEV:	But there again, one week you might, one month you might get a  one month he might give her that and  bugger all the next month! •158712_159897•
*WEN:	Well she says it's guilt money and that is possible. •159897_160094•
*BEV:	Mm. •160130_160160•
*WEN:	But, I think you're quite right in what you say. •160172_160339•
        Quite right! •160339_160526•
        No doubt about that. •160976_161050•
        You never know  with what she said anyway. •161050_161242•
        Unpredictable. •161310_161388•
        But I mean, knowing her  the  the the , the money she's had  she will  erm  certainly look after. •161517_162612•
*BEV:	Mm. •162624_162630•
*WEN:	You know? •162630_162653•
        I mean she's been living off what  seventy three odd quid has she? •162653_163632•
*BEV:	Yeah. •163632_163654•
*WEN:	So I mean there isn't anyway in the world that she's gonna bank  seven hundred quid a month! •163832_164289•
        No way at all! •164475_164516•
        She'll er  make the most of that because she won't  possibly  money for erm •164947_165377•
*BEV:	Mhm. •165377_165400•
*WEN:	she'll want money for the deposit and  and  whatever she gets. •165612_166223•
        Has there been much noise today? •166223_166312•
*BEV:	No, but  their dogs and that. •166312_166403•
        Got a lot done this morning then? •166403_166472•
*WEN:	Well I did it on the way  . •166472_166565•
