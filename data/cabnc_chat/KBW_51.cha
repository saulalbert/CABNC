*DOR:	Should of had the answer •785510_787160•
*ROS:	yeah, I find that, that I've done it and I've written down the answer and then I can't think which number does it go to, and by the time I've got to number one they're on about six, so I might as well, I'm lost it completely, so I can't do that either and my project work, course work, goes towards certain percent of my marks and I can't think for the life of me why •787330_881630•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*ROS:	cos I don't want •881670_882630•

*ROS:	you get one percent on explaining how you do it •882630_887930•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*ROS:	so that's that, I can't rely on my course work for my marks so that's •887930_892410•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*ROS:	I can't do it, so that I've got to get full marks for the exam to pass, without the other two bits on it, I can't do that •892410_908840•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	Why is the project work so •908980_916520•
*AND:	You don't have to have English? •916520_924670•
