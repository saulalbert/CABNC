*JAM:	Oh!
*BIL:	Which is, like, next door.I had the Rotaract, erm, they   (.) said they'd probably be, offered, er er, one of these castle things   (.) er jumping castles from   (.)  (        ) .
*JAM:	Oh!
*ANN:	Did you see those on the news yesterday?
*BIL:	Aye.I see, yeah.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*BIL:	They can cause a lot of   (        ) apparently.
*ANN:	Adults and children
*JAM:	Yeah.
*ANN:	injuries.I fell off one the week before last   (.) at the soft play   (.) but   (.) it wasn't blown up   (.) quite enough.
*BIL:	Oh I see.
*ANN:	And, as I ste 
*JAM:	Well there's no carpet, he said there's just
*ANN:	Well, there was 
*JAM:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	there's a great   (.) you know the big heavy   (.) erm, foam thing, but it kept slipping away.All the morning I kept pushing it back again.
*BIL:	Aye.Yeah.They 
*ANN:	Er 
*BIL:	couldn't tell me I suppose.
*ANN:	and it a it had happened to of   (.) slipped away at that time   (.) and I went to step off, and, with it not being blown up properly   (.) that's how   (.) it just flattened and I went off sid I've still got a big bruise on my left knee! ((laugh)) 
*BIL:	Well erm   (.) the only 
*ANN:	So I, I do not jump on any more.
*BIL:	the only trouble with that sort of thing i is, again if you ever get any wet on it because
*JAM:	Mm.Mm mm.
*BIL:	Oh well.And, there's certainly some 
*JAM:	So the mayor's taking out the oranges?
*BIL:	And er 
*ANN:	So they've got, they've got it back now, so it's got nothing to do with us?
*BIL:	No, I don't suppose, thank you.Er
*ANN:	Do you work?
*BIL:	No. (        ) 
*ANN:	Mm.
*JAM:	No, erm   (.) basically er   (.) I think for the   (        ) anyhow Trevor will be coming in, so we'll, we just st try and stay a little more to see what happens at the end.
*BIL:	 (        )  (.) But erm
*JAM:	See they handed it over to us and, but they didn't wanna   (.) you know, it was very   (.) when, what they call them?Erm
*BIL:	It was Temple wasn't it,la last year?
*JAM:	Aye, Temple was     (.)  (        )  (.) but it, it was a good job because we had no oranges   (.) and they had to go and break in. ((laugh)) 
*BIL:	It's alright now  (        ) .
*JAM:	 ((clears throat))  (.) Yeah.
*ANN:	Was that the year the oranges were horrible?
*JAM:	Er
*ANN:	I've 
*BIL:	Yeah.
*ANN:	they were Seville oranges, I'm sure they were 
*JAM:	Well they've, they've been nice.
*ANN:	Seville oranges.
*BIL:	Aye.
*JAM:	They've never been really nice.
*BIL:	Yeah.Well I don't know where they're getting them from, but I mean, that's what they say.
*ANN:	Well that year 
*BIL:	And they've got Round Table laid on to help and they want help from the   (.) from us.So they want us to go around at   (.) half past one   (.) or the two of them can start cos we've got an addition  (        ) .
*JAM:	Well, it worked.Er, I'm just   (.) wondered, you know,wi with   (.) because they came to expect it and we, we didn't know.And, they'd handed it over to us and then   (.) obviously they wanted it back, but then
*BIL:	Well, I think it's like everything else, I think that   (.) er, with, with Lawrence being off they're just sort of meeting everything as a crisis and getting, getting
*ANN:	Well if you're at work 
*JAM:	Yo you see as well to go with what you call them?
*JAM:	Er, (        ) 
*BIL:	 (        ) 
*JAM:	he, he
*BIL:	Didn't
*JAM:	he didn't want anything to do with it you see.That's where   (.) and he's not from  (        ) , he's not from this end so   (.) had   (.) er no real interest   (.) for him I don't think.
*ANN:	If you're at work Dorothy could go   (.) If I help, I'll help with Trevor with his triplets.
*JAM:	Well you can go and get their oranges and the
*ANN:	Yes, but it's, he, he   (.) couldn't possibly push that buggy
*JAM:	 ((sigh)) 
*ANN:	around that field.
*JAM:	But it isn't in the fields though.
*BIL:	 (        ) it's up beside the 
*JAM:	It's, it's 
*BIL:	it, it's Carlisle Park.
*ANN:	Oh!That's 
*JAM:	Because 
*ANN:	better.
*JAM:	because the, the, the pa the er
*ANN:	Oh!Because of that lea 
*JAM:	The Easter Field is, is 
*ANN:	leaking 
*BIL:	It's got a  (        ) .
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	So it can't be used.
*ANN:	Right.
*BIL:	But I presume that   (.) we do turn out if we do it right in the middle.
*JAM:	Well in actual fact, people who turned out were Isobel   (.) and me, and er   (.) what they call him?Er, one who goes on?Er, from Lonsdene?Er   (.) Fred ?
*ANN:	Fred  
*JAM:	No.Fred .
*BIL:	No, Jack's not very well.
*ANN:	Well I helped you   (.) one year 
*JAM:	Oh yes.
*ANN:	cos there was only 
*JAM:	Yes.
*ANN:	there was only   (.) you and somebody else.
*JAM:	Well the year I was chairman.Th the, er   (.) the year I was wi I was chairman, we were both there. (        ) 
*ANN:	There was one child came up about seventeen times 
*JAM:	Oh yes!
*ANN:	I think.
*JAM:	Erm, down, it was down here remember?
*BIL:	I know.
*JAM:	That was the year the oranges were horrible, maybe his mother was making marmalade.
*BIL:	 ((laugh))  (.) The only thing about er is that the Rotaract one tentatively mentioned about the  (        ) .
*JAM:	Well that's it.I mean,th tha when we took it over we, we got that, cos people said well, you know, just dishing out the oranges wasn't   (.) there should be something organized so Rotaract said they would do   (.) we said we would give the money towards the prizes.
*BIL:	So that they wouldn't hate us.Well when er, the, the, the, there's two words, the charter, and what's the other word?There's two things to do with  (        ) .
*JAM:	Food and jar, that's right.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*BIL:	Well well Barlen, Barlen.
*JAM:	Barlen   (        ) and  (        ) .
*BIL:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	I can't say that properly.Those words aren't used where   [laughing] I come from  [] .
*BIL:	 ((laugh))  (.) And er, er 
*ANN:	Mind, I use words that Jim doesn't.
*BIL:	the, the Rotaract er   (.) presents this year that they're   (        ) towards, so he's been   (.) quite pleased.
*JAM:	Mhm.
*BIL:	 (        )  (.) So they'll, they'll be done.And Round Table it says, has laid on for the
*JAM:	Well Round Table a er have never, that's the first time then?We got 
*BIL:	Well it's 
*JAM:	because, cos it's Rotaract who's always
*BIL:	It must be the borough involved with the
*JAM:	Mhm.
*BIL:	But I'm er
*JAM:	But they were keen.I mean, I, they, they've, they've, they did work didn't they?With, with the games and things when, when we were there.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	And it was a reasonable day too
*ANN:	I know all the children.
*JAM:	I mean, we thought it'd rain this year so it's   (.) more 
*BIL:	Yeah.
*JAM:	likely to be a better day then 
*ANN:	And ee, all the kids ended up with a prize didn't they?
*JAM:	Oh, eventually, yes.I mean,th the 
*ANN:	Yeah they 
*JAM:	they were   (        ) that had bigger to ones 
*ANN:	The winners got 
*BIL:	Who supplied those then?
*JAM:	Out of the money that we gave them.
*BIL:	Oh!The 
*ANN:	Yes.
*BIL:	I see, it was, and that was what Rotaract did?
*JAM:	Yes.Yes.
*ANN:	They had big eggs, well, you know, sort of the 
*BIL:	Aha.
*ANN:	Smarties type egg so about so big 
*BIL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	for the prizes
*BIL:	Ah.
*ANN:	and the others got little Cadbury's 
*BIL:	Ah.
*ANN:	Creme Eggs.Which remi reminds me, I've got to get some for all they   (.) spare children   [laughing] before   [] 
*BIL:	Yes. ((cough))  (.) well 
*ANN:	before they ran out.
*BIL:	It's surprising actually cos th the more, the more   (.) common ones do run out because of course th the other ones are a bit pricey.
*ANN:	The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round   (.) and then they run out at Easter.That's happened, I couldn't get any   (.) one year   (.) I took the triplets to the erm   (.) Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola   (.) and one of them   (.) won a Creme Egg
*BIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag   (.) and er   (.) it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some   (.) I, I can't remember what we were doing afterwards   (.) so I gave it to his mother, I thought she could share it.
*BIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Mind, by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between   (.) those three and their older brother
*BIL:	Yeah.There's not much of it left.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*BIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	No, but I could have seen a, there'd be an   (.) almighty tantrums from the other two if Ji er
*BIL:	Aha.
*ANN:	James had had it.
*BIL:	I can imagine.
*ANN:	Mm.Mm.
*JAM:	Is there anything much for the agenda for a week on Tuesday?
*BIL:	Not a great deal.I mean, what I'll 
*JAM:	Yeah.
*BIL:	do is   (.) we'll get rid of those couple of things left over
*JAM:	Mhm.
*BIL:	and er   (.) basically, it's, Peter's got the one coming which is er   (.) put the ducks in the river.
*JAM:	Mm.
*BIL:	Er, he's doing the, a, and what I'm er sug suggesting
*JAM:	Aha.
*BIL:	like well   (.) apparently the fella that's done it, for years, and years, for years, for years has had a  (        ) 
*JAM:	Mhm.
*BIL:	and he's, he's just   (.) ke you know what I mean, I think he's, he's getting an extension so that's why there's a bit of delay on that.
*JAM:	Mhm.
*BIL:	And it's where that lot meet  (        ) .
*ANN:	I've been counting them since.
*JAM:	Well how much, I mean 
*ANN:	I read the letter in the paper.
*JAM:	how much was he paying  (        ) ?
*BIL:	It was summat like er   (.) I dunno, it was summat like five hundred pound a year.It was quite modest.
*JAM:	Mm.
*BIL:	Er
*ANN:	There were thirteen 
*JAM:	But 
*ANN:	drakes cha  (.) er chasing one duck   (.) er, just past the baths along the promenade.And then we sat   (.) at the far side of the Old Gate bridge   (.) and er   (.) an old lady came along   (.) and said, and she was counting them   (.) but she said, just look at that thing, she counted seven   (.) although, in actual fact, by then   (.) th these dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down.And a there was a domestic one   (.) in each group   (.) there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was another white one   (.) near Old Gate Bridge.
*JAM:	Did he cull them as well?
*BIL:	Yeah, apparently so.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	Did he feed them?Cos there's   (.) there was, there used to be fe feed put down for that as well. (        ) 
*BIL:	Well, to be honest, it seems to, I   (.) Peter's got the details cos he's been talking to er, the public health clerk.
*JAM:	Mhm.
*BIL:	But it's, it's, it's   (.) it sort a   (.) it's, I think carrying through from the old borough days
*JAM:	That's right.
*BIL:	and, somebody ha erm   (.) nobody really knew a great deal about it, so I think he's been doing some research on that.That's the one paper that is a bit er   (.) maybe a bit so   (.) but th I'll have to check with the N   (.) R A because of course er, the river
*JAM:	Mm.
*BIL:	er policing is their responsibility.
*JAM:	It is.
*BIL:	They, they've not   (.) they'll not do that.
*JAM:	No.
*BIL:	No.But I mean,we really, we've gotta make sure that they haven't got any objections.But of course, in the meanwhile, of course we've had a flood.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	And it's going to kill most of the 
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	eggs   (.) wash most of the nests away I was thinking yesterday.
*BIL:	It's bloody incredible actually!We always get extreme  (        ) .
*JAM:	Well that's, it wasn't a obviously as high as the flood twenty seven years ago.
*BIL:	No.
*JAM:	But was, pretty near.It was getting near.But of course the higher standards they've got no protection cos they   (.) didn't want   (.) what was offered.
*BIL:	They didn't want a bank.
*JAM:	Well that's right.
*BIL:	Er none whatsoever.
*JAM:	It was 
*BIL:	 (        ) 
*JAM:	a raised footpath that was before 
*BIL:	Yeah.
*JAM:	this wasn't it?Than, than the bridge right round.
*BIL:	Which is what we're doing at, at the Wandsbeck innit?So we'll put a   (.) we'll put a bank in, very deliberately at the first level
*JAM:	Mhm.
*BIL:	erm   (.) and went right the way through with, it did look, it doesn't look bad at all, it was 
*JAM:	Yeah well   (.) no, it didn't.I mean, this looks   (.) well there's nothing else they could do here.It doesn't look il ugly, but I mean it, it   (.) it's not attractive
*BIL:	No.
*JAM:	but it's
*BIL:	 (        ) 
*JAM:	but, but, but they've got protection.
*BIL:	But I mean er that one lent itself to that.
*JAM:	That's right.Yes.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	It would have been ideal.
*BIL:	But you see now of course, that was when there were River
*JAM:	Yeah.
*BIL:	River Authority days and 
*JAM:	Yeah.
*BIL:	that was quite good.Erm   (.) it was quite useful er, they   (.) you could get things done, now 
*JAM:	Mm.
*BIL:	now it's nothing.
*JAM:	Well they just   (.) put 
*ANN:	I came along the river path when I came home from shopping.Sitting in the, the sand, damp sand   [laughing] under the bridge  [] .
*JAM:	Mm.
*BIL:	You never saw that one that would er   (.) you know the one on the Bedford Road because Bedford Road has a   (        ) 
*JAM:	Well they   (.) that's right.I mean 
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	there's nothing can be done, than the 
*ANN:	No.
*JAM:	nothing at all.
*ANN:	Mhm.
*BIL:	Mhm.
*JAM:	But er, ah, you know, it gets up into the garden but I don't think it, it's got anywhere near the house er this time, cos I was up there   (.) on Thursday and I, you could see where it had been, but it was   (.) and I mi I'd have got very worried about er
*BIL:	But you could actually put a bag all the way and tie it into   (.) tie it into er   (.) the   (.) it's the Skillery Bridge that one.
*JAM:	Yes, the Skillery Bridge 
*BIL:	And 
*JAM:	yeah.
*BIL:	you just sort of tied up the 
*ANN:	Well 
*JAM:	Yes, well, that's where we'll have to go from there 
*BIL:	I think.
*JAM:	round   (.) but 
*ANN:	There were wild rumours flying around on Wednesday, I was told
*JAM:	They didn't want to
*ANN:	by several people that the Skillery had gone.In 
*JAM:	But it hadn't, no.
*BIL:	It survived. (        ) 
*ANN:	Well Jim, Jim saw the children going back to er   (.) school after swimming
*BIL:	Oh.
*ANN:	over it on Thursday afternoon   (.) but er
*JAM:	But there was a lot of debris up against it, and high up against it!
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAM:	So they could see how bad 
*ANN:	Was Fold Cottage flooded?
*JAM:	It was bound to be 
*ANN:	It didn't 
*JAM:	Ann.Bound to be.
*ANN:	I thought they built a wall around it the 
*JAM:	No.
*ANN:	last people who bought it.
*BIL:	Yeah, but even on that you see,yo yo you know,yo  (.) you're never really stuck with it   (.) I mean 
*JAM:	No.
*BIL:	 (        ) , once you're in the clear   (.) you   (.) really it's the silliest in the world to have a little   (        ) actually.
*JAM:	Yeah.Well this , who is   (.) must be related to David , anyway, erm   (.) they bought the house facing the o is it Old Cross, Old Gate bridge   (.) and has spent a lot of money on doing it up,li just over three million   (.) of course the whole of the downstairs was flooded today.
*BIL:	Is that Mrs  's?
*JAM:	Yes, that's right.The one 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAM:	facing her, that's right.Yes.
*ANN:	Aha.It's called Aubern House is it?
*JAM:	That's right.
