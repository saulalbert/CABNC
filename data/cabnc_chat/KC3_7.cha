@Comment:	conversation #7 (Tape 051801)
*VIC:	I know you can get sport, weather, news whatever on  but I wouldn't know what else you can get or what page. •0095_7995•
*JOA:	Oh well I haven't got as far as that because I •8125_9995•
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*VIC:	So how do you know just what is available? •10305_12315•
*JOA:	Erm  I shall have to sit one afternoon  and go through it all . •12425_17665•
*FRE:	Yes well if you're on one  •18125_19465•
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*JOA:	I think it was erm  when John was tt playing with it  •20455_24445•
*VIC:	Fiddling around  •24445_24825•
*JOA:	I, I noticed •24825_25325•
*FRE:	Yeah. •25325_25485•
*VIC:	He just stood there   •25705_26515•
*JOA:	Ernie's Ernie's winning numbers. •26635_28855•
*VIC:	Ernie's winning numbers? •29605_30595•
        Ah. •30945_30975•
        Bet it wasn't ours was it? •31135_32245•
*JOA:	I don't know what mine are to tell you the truth. •32545_34625•
*VIC:	Well you'll have to have yours glued erm tt to the side of the television set when Ernie's numbers comes up you can •35775_40965•
*JOA:	Well they're supposed to let you know aren't they if erm  if you win? •41765_46785•
*VIC:	They are supposed to tell you. •46785_48115•
*FRE:	Yeah. •48115_48195•
*VIC:	I'm sure they will let you know. •48195_49525•
*JOA:	Cos when it first started I used to  check in the Sunday paper every day but er I dunno  it's a waste of time . •54105_62245•
        They've got the address, they're supposed to let you know when •63765_65975•
*FRE:	Yeah •65975_66145•
*JOA:	you come up. •66395_70625•
        I have a niece who  erm she had quite a few, she's won several times. •70625_79605•
        And it's a case of coals, taking coals to Newcastle   •80135_85075•
*FRE:	Yeah  yeah. •85145_85735•
*JOA:	But it would be quite nice to collect on, on something. •85875_95885•
        But you get quite a lot of these  erm I suppose they're trying to promote what they're selling  you are, you have been picked out of Nottingham •97505_107485•
*FRE:	Yeah  •108345_108735•
*JOA:	to have these er four numbers, a chance to win about twenty thousand. •108735_115665•
        I keep sending them back but  I haven't got the twenty thousand  yet. •119925_123735•
        Ah I did win it was before, before Tasha and John got married it was er one of these catalogues that came through you see  anyway I sent the thing back and I got the catalogue and they wanted some things out and you get twenty five pounds off whatever you ordered, the first order, so quite alright  but I did win something out of that draw   twenty five P  •127305_156345•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	they sent me a cheque for twenty five P and I was going to tear it up  I thought well no I might as well put it in the  in the bank  twenty five P. •156475_168765•
        And I waited till I'd got a few  bit more money to put in and sort of hid it amongst all these others, mm. •169775_176805•
        Yeah twenty five P I won on that one. •177655_179585•
        What have you got your nose there for? •184255_186805•
        But talk about a hassle  they wanted, they, well they picked the the you know the present that you you claim erm, a deep fryer  and I think it was in March time  and by July it still hadn't come in spite of ringing and writing and everything else •190475_213405•
*FRE:	Really? •214435_214825•
*JOA:	and then they informed me that it was out of stock so I wrote them rather a  a polite  letter  saying that it took them a long to realize it was out of stock when it had been ordered in March  and erm  I thought their communicative system in their office was er non existent. •217165_247035•
        Anyway they said what else would they like and they had some, a set of luggage, well it's only this nylon stuff but it was very useful for them to take away with them  it did a bit of good the  and I, I put in this letter  I shall no longer order, I shall  what was it? •249045_272015•
        I shall be very wary of having any contact with your firm  again . •273685_279165•
        They're still pestering me, sending me letters and  we haven't heard from you recently •279165_287025•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	what would you like from  the catalogue sort of thing  and I only had this catalogue to   Cos I you know I paid for it  what did they have? •287025_304055•
        Oh I think an electric drill  it was in the sixties  so with the twenty five pounds off  it brought it down a bit and I, I paid for it with one cheque so I wasn't having it on the weekly er  er it worked out  I think Vicki gave some of it towards it. •304735_332135•
        But I thought if that's how they run a business  So then when they, they moved house I realized they were using an ordinary saucepan to do their chips in  and I had visions of fat boiling over and  cos it's gas  so I bought them one a  very nice deep fryer as a housewarming present. •332135_365175•
        It came in very useful because they were quite a while before the gas was connected. •369095_372435•
        But you've only got, if you if you put  chips in a basket in a  chip pan if it, the fat boils up you can at least lift the chips out straight away but if you're putting them straight into the pan there's no hope of stopping it coming over. •377345_403995•
*FRE:	Yeah. •405375_405445•
*JOA:	Oh I kept thinking of this fire hazard  thought I can't, I can't  live with that any longer  •405935_411555•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	with the thought of them using a saucepan. •411885_414725•
        Cos they hadn't seen any danger to it I suppose. •416795_420265•
        So then John, he tries all sorts of things out, you know doughnuts and  things like that and it's a thermostatically controlled •420265_441485•
*FRE:	Yeah •441855_441935•
*JOA:	one so he knows what the temperature's going to be and er he's  I think he's quite enjoyed experimenting with it. •441965_451135•
        They've got quite a nice  it's not a large house but it's a good size  lounge and dining room and kitchen. •451455_472305•
        The bathroom is downstairs but there are three bedrooms so it's quite a decent  size for them. •472305_482605•
        But the base of the bed is still in the dining room, they can't get it up  up the stairs   although although it folds up, you know, it's  it's standing like this in  in the dining room. •486165_498645•
        The cat er likes it there, it goes and sits on the top of it. •504295_515115•
        You're not cooking are you? •515115_515935•
        Vicki ? •518365_518595•
        she got the door closed? •518595_523775•
*FRE:	Sounds though er well •524185_525055•
*JOA:	She gets in that kitchen you know and •525155_528865•
*FRE:	sounds like  •530945_531875•
*JOA:	Vicki •531875_532745•
*VIC:	Hello  •532895_532995•
*JOA:	you're not cooking are you ? •533005_534845•
*VIC:	I can't hear with the washer going. •537705_539675•
*JOA:	You're not cooking are you? •539685_541285•
*VIC:	No. •541665_541765•
*JOA:	Oh. •541765_541855•
        What are you busy doing? •541855_543025•
*VIC:	I've just washed the wine glasses out. •543035_545305•
*JOA:	Oh well I would have come and done those   •545425_547335•
*VIC:	Ah there's only four. •547365_548815•
        I've done them now. •548825_551665•
*JOA:	Oh right. •551665_555295•
        Being lazy. •555295_555795•
        I had such a lazy week  Christmas week  I went down to er Northamptonshire to my son's. •558285_570145•
        All I did was  wash up  and we didn't do anything else. •570145_576545•
        Talk about being lazy. •577755_579615•
        They wouldn't let me do a thing. •579615_586375•
        Never went out till Friday because it was, they went walking but it was so windy cos  they're here and the garden's sort of down to a field and then it's all fields and fields and fields and the wind just  comes across like gales all the time. •586375_615655•
        I think I've never spent such a lazy week. •615655_637595•
*FRE:	Were you here at Christmas? •637595_640375•
*JOA:	No. •640585_640695•
*FRE:	You were down there? •640695_641775•
*JOA:	Mm. •641995_642255•
*FRE:	Mm. •642655_642955•
*JOA:	Went on the Saturday. •642955_644685•
        They came up to view Heidi's riding display then I went back with them and Vicki and Malcolm diverted from Barford on the Sunday where they'd been for lunch and picked me up Sunday afternoon the sort of following weekend. •644845_669785•
        First time I hadn't spent Christmas with Vicki I think since they were married. •669785_680705•
        We went to the theatre in London on the Friday night. •680705_688035•
        They have erm  what's called the players' theatre, I don't know whether you've heard of it at all erm they belong, they're members of it. •689505_702305•
        It's only the ground floor, really, and it is set out with a bar at the back and refreshments like the old music halls used to be with every so often, every few seats there is a table so that it's a thing to have your drink and refreshments to hand at the table. •702305_730505•
        And before the proceedings you drink the health to Queen Victoria •730505_735395•
*FRE:	Oh yes  •736015_736335•
*JOA:	and it's a, an old fashioned music hall, more often than not well  when we went it was a pantomime but the first  part of the evening was an a music hall •736345_750595•
*FRE:	Mm. •752305_752445•
*JOA:	type of entertainment, then it was a pantomime, Beauty and the Beast, but they keep as near to the original script as they can always, well it was written eighteen fourteen or something. •752485_768885•
        quite entertaining. •769115_773815•
        And you sing chorus so you know they give you a song sheet and you sing then. •773815_781275•
        It's very expensive to  for what it is, I mean it's fifteen pounds a ticket but if you, if you're a member of course you get in reduced •781305_794995•
*FRE:	Yes. •795465_795735•
*JOA:	But you've got to, Terence said it's so dear to be a member you have got to keep going to get your, your money back. •795745_810515•
        But it's, it's a nice homely  it's all been refurbished in the last year. •810525_825135•
        And they've made a very nice restaurant on the top floor. •825145_832285•
        Only a very small one but it's very nice  nice food. •832285_857515•
        Then when we came out we went   around London to see the sights but  the decorations but why we went I didn't think anything to them at all this year. •857685_879295•
        Cos we didn't get we didn't  it didn't finish till about •879465_882295•
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*JOA:	well half past ten  if not later so we were late getting home. •885285_903115•
*FRE:	Mm. •903115_903415•
*JOA:	But they pop down to London as though it's  down  into town but   They're quite near the motorway so it's useful. •903525_913965•
*FRE:	Yes well I've often said Northampton's about the right distance. •914035_918655•
        Er  •918655_918775•
*JOA:	Yeah. •919035_919285•
*FRE:	you can, it's within striking distance isn't it? •919335_924645•
*JOA:	Yes. •925795_926095•
        It doesn't take them long at all to get in the outskirts of London, it's weaving your way •926105_933015•
*FRE:	Yeah. •933015_933245•
*JOA:	through when you've got there. •933245_937675•
*FRE:	Yeah. •937675_937745•
*VIC:	 ((laugh))  (        )  (.) 
*JOA:	Well her mum's knee wasn't there so she thought she  •937835_943035•
*VIC:	Ah! •943035_943125•
*JOA:	she might as well sit on her gran's  •943125_944665•
*VIC:	Her mum's knee will be back. •944665_946755•
*JOA:	on her gran's knee. •946755_948355•
*VIC:	Mum's knee will be back. •948405_952365•
        Ah!somebody else's knee? •952365_952985•
        Don't want  do you Luce? •953035_958045•
*JOA:	Is his eye running again? •962285_963555•
        I think he must have a bit of cold in it or something. •963555_966595•
        Have you still got a hair in  from your •966595_970925•
*VIC:	Haircut. •970925_971035•
*JOA:	haircut? •971635_971795•
*VIC:	This weather's enough to give anybody a cold eye isn't it? •971805_977035•
        Mm? •977035_977245•
*JOA:	Well we set out with the good intention of taking her for a long walk this morning but er  we changed our mind didn't we? •977245_986915•
*VIC:	Didn't do, didn't think it would do you any good did we? •986915_991265•
*JOA:	Oh it was so damp and ooh and miserable  •991265_993455•
*FRE:	Oh it was miserable yeah. •993455_997035•
        Yesterday it was very cold but it was very nice •997035_999695•
*JOA:	Yes. •999695_999965•
*FRE:	and dry wasn't it? •999965_100231•
*JOA:	Yes I, I walked from er where was it, Langmere Lane? •100231_100805•
*VIC:	Walked from   road   •101284_101702•
*JOA:	Well wasn't, isn't that Langmere Lane where you park the car? •101703_101976•
*VIC:	No Langmere Lane's the other side of the garage. •102052_102401•
*JOA:	Well what's that lane called then? •102402_103038•
*VIC:	Tt that goes into Compton Acres doesn't it? •103038_103196•
        I don't know what that's called. •103197_103487•
*JOA:	car conked out so Vicki stayed with the car and her who we were going to take a walk in Ruddington, and I walked home with her to get Malcolm to  go over with the other car. •103511_105166•
        And it was quite actually although I was hurrying because I thought of them sitting in the car erm it was very pleasant walking, very slippery though along by Walford cemetery and all down there. •105166_107093•
*VIC:	You really stepped out. •107194_107419•
*JOA:	Yes. •107429_107454•
*VIC:	Nice crisp morning wasn't it? •107468_107682•
*JOA:	It was a pleasant morning for walking, it would have been quite  nice   •107682_108025•
*VIC:	But it was cold  waited. •108025_108274•
*JOA:	Well you were frozen weren't you waiting? •108274_108549•
        Cold day, it was me that  but I think with hurrying so, quite a good walk. •108549_109086•
        It's alright when I first got in then after a while my legs  all started going wobbly . •109086_109665•
*FRE:	Oh yeah. •109850_109902•
*VIC:	But Saturday mornings we usually  drop Heidi don't we? •109902_110622•
*JOA:	Yes. •110622_110646•
*VIC:	And then go in the •110646_110887•
*JOA:	The building and leisure centre  •110887_111125•
*VIC:	park. •111134_111187•
*JOA:	leisure park at Ruddington and they've got a quite a lot  •111236_111696•
*VIC:	Paths and  •111732_111797•
*JOA:	yes of intersecting paths haven't they? •111864_112250•
*VIC:	And it's just opposite where we drop Heidi, we used to walk along the road  it doesn't really lead anywhere only to a couple of farms does it? •112251_113187•
        But if we go in the park she can run more, or in the summer we go down by the old railway track don't we? •113187_113976•
*JOA:	Yes. •113976_113986•
*VIC:	Go through the farm and  go along there. •113992_114288•
        See the flowers and listen to the birds. •114442_114706•
        Don't we? •114747_114830•
*JOA:	But you had a walk on your lead yesterday didn't you? •114830_115396•
        And this morning we got as far as  didn't we? •115396_115773•
        Went in for a hot chocolate and that was it we didn't •115784_116320•
*VIC:	And then we just •116320_116404•
*JOA:	well we did   •116404_116541•
*VIC:	we walked outside didn't we? •116541_116681•
*JOA:	Yeah •116681_116699•
*VIC:	So she could come off the lead. •116703_116988•
        But it was so damp and cold and not nice was it? •116988_117938•
*JOA:	She enjoys herself cos she chases around all the beds doesn't she there and •117947_118433•
*VIC:	She doesn't go far she just, she just  doesn't bother anybody else. •118434_119163•
        Do you? •119534_119590•
        And Heidi was going to phone to say what time she wanted collecting and so we'd got to be back  couldn't be out too long could we? •119596_120498•
*JOA:	No. •120498_120507•
*VIC:	And leave the •120646_120711•
*JOA:	We needn't have bothered though need we? •120712_120882•
*VIC:	No! •120976_120982•
        By the look of it. •120992_121599•
        Cos she asked last night, I was supposed to be taking Jenny and then when Fay came she asked me if I'd take Fay as well today so  it looks as though Charlotte's mum did everybody took everybody home. •121599_123139•
*JOA:	Mm. •123139_123149•
        Well it's an awkward time to  ask people to go and fetch them when they're  if they're preparing dinner isn't it? •123150_124136•
*VIC:	Most people don't have a Sunday dinner as they  used to. •124136_124567•
        I don't think it is a traditional •124568_124775•
*FRE:	Not  I don't think it is. •124775_124902•
*JOA:	No. •124902_124908•
        It is  •124965_125005•
*VIC:	Mind you   •125013_125044•
*JOA:	when you go to our morning service it is. •125044_125514•
*FRE:	Exactly . •125514_125532•
*VIC:	Well we always used to have what I call a traditional Sunday dinner  •125532_125914•
*JOA:	Yes we did. •125920_126052•
        Father used to  like that so  •126052_126381•
*VIC:	but  well sometimes we still do but sometimes we have something else  instead don't we? •126381_126938•
*JOA:	Totally different, yeah. •126938_127384•
*VIC:	Yes. •127384_127403•
*JOA:	Lives have changed. •127403_127484•
*VIC:	Yeah, all changed. •127557_128143•
        But I think there are a lot of people that don't have a Sunday dinner, whatever  form. •128143_129340•
        Think there are a lot of children that just have, well I think they must just live on snacks, they just  •129340_130105•
*FRE:	Mm. •130105_130157•
*VIC:	something here, beans on toast, open a packet of this, tin of that and  or a take away or  •130157_130917•
*JOA:	Pizza or •130927_131821•
*VIC:	mm. •131828_131846•
*JOA:	We went to church last  Sunday didn't we? •131846_132516•
*VIC:	Mhm •132516_132526•
*FRE:	 ((yawn)) 
*JOA:	Well it's the first time I've been •132527_132723•
*VIC:	This year. •132821_132847•
*JOA:	Well you're right yes, it would be this year  but I didn't go much at the end of last year did I? •132848_133819•
*VIC:	No well you were away  •133819_134024•
*JOA:	I was away and then I had that awful little cough  first thing in the morning  erm  and I think I, to be quite honest, I lost interest in going. •134024_135700•
*VIC:	Well last Sunday it seemed to be going quite nicely to start with, trying to think what it was, communion  •135707_136379•
*JOA:	It was Carole  •136379_136533•
*VIC:	communion yes •136573_136814•
*JOA:	Carole  she's normally very interesting but she was  very hard to hear. •136815_137449•
        Carole . •137478_137489•
        Malcolm said it was  •137489_137574•
*VIC:	. •_•
        Well she was  •137574_137770•
*JOA:	very good didn't he? •137770_137840•
        But he was sitting underneath her. •137840_138076•
*VIC:	Yeah but we'd got erm tt oh, Leo  at the side of us  so he was, do you know the  that do christian ? •138076_139628•
*FRE:	No I know of them. •139628_139816•
*VIC:	Yeah what's her name? •139817_139992•
        Sandra •139992_140012•
*JOA:	Sandra  Sandra I think it is, Sandra    You couldn't hear anything could you? •140025_141193•
*VIC:	He was chattering away, dad was replying to him, he was up and down the steps, shuffling on the carpet and •141212_141746•
*JOA:	They were having this game, you know, one hand on top of the other so •141746_142111•
*FRE:	Oh! •142111_142128•
*JOA:	it was clapping and •142133_142330•
*FRE:	Oh dear  •142330_142354•
*VIC:	And you just  But as we were saying er talking to Janet afterwards  there was another little one down at the side, erm mum was getting a bit irate with him, but you see they don't take anything for the children to do. •142354_144225•
        I mean you can't expect them to be quiet, just sit and do nothing all that time. •144225_144750•
*FRE:	That's right. •144759_144847•
*VIC:	It didn't finish till five to twelve did it last  Sunday? •144848_145353•
*JOA:	Well that's  early, I should have thought it was •145354_145722•
*VIC:	Was it after that? •145722_145798•
*JOA:	Well I thought it was, yes. •145798_145928•
        It might have been   •145928_145987•
*VIC:	Well you can't expect them to just  sit. •145987_146301•
        I mean fair enough you can't expect them to be quiet. •146301_146830•
        But  I think the parents should  take something for them to do, I mean we used to take colouring books and books for the children to look at and •146830_147920•
*FRE:	Yeah. •147920_147927•
*VIC:	whatever so there was something to keep them occupied and erm  you know have a bag and as soon as they got fed up with that right you'd get something else out to take their interest and •147927_148937•
*JOA:	Well Peter did remark to this lady didn't he? •148937_149286•
        Who's child was making a dickens of a commotion  •149291_149606•
*VIC:	Noise, that the creche was in the   •149631_149886•
*JOA:	Yes. •149886_149906•
*VIC:	and she did actually take him out at one time  •149906_150126•
*JOA:	But she looked  •150131_150172•
*VIC:	she looked absolute daggers when she took him out didn't she? •150172_150507•
        And then she came in. •150511_150709•
*JOA:	Yes and he •150709_150826•
*VIC:	And he'd got a car •150827_151003•
*JOA:	that he'd got out of the creche I think, cos he hadn't got it when he went out. •151004_151446•
*VIC:	No, and of course he was running that along the seat •151446_151695•
*JOA:	And dropping  it . •151709_151784•
*VIC:	and dropping it off the seat and whatever. •151784_152086•
*JOA:	But Leo hadn't got anything but he certainly made enough noise, oh dear. •152086_152563•
        So what with Carole's soft voice and that we didn't get a lot of  and it seemed as though it was well like that, several times I went last year and I really got  a bit cheesed off. •152563_154075•
*VIC:	Oh er yes I was going to say we suddenly heard a chorus didn't we? •154115_154634•
*JOA:	Oh yes that was it. •154634_154867•
        Oh well we've got   •154867_154933•
*VIC:	There are quite a few children in here, let's have some choruses. •154933_155397•
        I don't like that. •155397_155647•
        You're all in the mood and   •155648_156019•
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	along this line and then all of a sudden it's  yes that's right it was before •156019_156451•
*JOA:	Communion, yes. •156451_156551•
*VIC:	we'd had the collection  and then it was all choruses and then it was oh where were we, he'd, then he'd forgotten his glasses, couldn't find his glasses, what page were we  •156552_157365•
*JOA:	Didn't know where he was. •157366_157459•
*VIC:	Oh dear . •157607_157744•
        And then we went back to the prayer after the collection didn't we? •157744_158411•
*JOA:	Mm. •158411_158437•
        Where are my glasses? •158437_158534•
        So somebody had to tell him he'd left them at the •158534_158820•
*VIC:	Altar. •158853_158880•
*JOA:	altar. •159298_159320•
*VIC:	So it was  we'd got distractions and then we suddenly chip in with all these choruses  er  no! •159320_159999•
        Didn't go down too well with me that didn't . •160000_161539•
        On a family service fair enough, when you've got the family service and it's all  •161539_161842•
*FRE:	Yeah, mm, right. •161842_161888•
*VIC:	you know, bits of this and bits of that but there again I think the family service ought to be a lot shorter than it is •161888_162442•
*JOA:	Well it certainly should be because it's for the families, for the young children and they, they can't understand what it, all of it is about so  it should be kept as simple and as short as possible. •162442_163890•
        And the and the children should have their own address. •163890_164105•
        Er well one address that is suitable for children. •164305_164695•
        Grown ups can sit and listen to it all close their ears. •164730_165180•
*VIC:	Probably get far more response from the grown ups  •165180_165336•
*JOA:	Erm but some of these childrens' addresses that we've had at St Paul's  they are very interesting and you get something out of them. •165611_167234•
*FRE:	Yeah. •167234_167255•
*JOA:	I miss going to St Paul's really. •167317_167494•
        Well we did go there one Sunday didn't we? •167494_167699•
*VIC:	Mm. •167791_167809•

*JOA:	That was it. •168639_168672•
*VIC:	Didn't we? •168806_168835•
*JOA:	We used to go once a month you know when the girls were in the Guides, used to go for their parade service and if you were at Auckley, Malcolm and I used to go up with Heidi didn't I? •168835_170230•

        Well Jane did say  no I don't think there's one in the village but if you want to go to one I'll take you to   Daventry would be nearest, yes, but she said I'll take you to one if you want to go. •172534_174673•
*VIC:	Yeah I think we went in November to er St Paul's didn't we? •174673_175415•

        I don't know whose idea it is that it goes on and on. •179702_180202•
*VIC:	Yeah the eight thirty, the eight o'clock service is a lot more  seems a lot more compact, I know you haven't got the hymns, but it seems to erm start, go on and finish, you know it •180202_181461•
*FRE:	Mm. •181462_181463•
*VIC:	it's all there •181469_181579•

*JOA:	End of, end of September I think. •237021_237251•
*VIC:	End of September,October, no end of September. •237553_237957•
*JOA:	Mm. •237957_237986•
*VIC:	For our old age, this is. •237986_238279•
        The other one was getting a bit low for us. •238767_239589•
        Wasn't it? •239589_239835•
*JOA:	Yes. •239835_239841•
        It wasn't that the springs had gone it was just low when when you had it wasn't it? •239929_240663•
        Keep still Lucy. •240665_240880•
*VIC:	Oh  and, well it must've been since we were at Malton so we'd've had it, what, about four  three or four  years when we went to Malton? •240880_242322•
*JOA:	you had it in Slay Drive didn't you? •242322_242695•
        No, not Slay Drive, at er Paddock, The Paddocks. •242697_242838•
*VIC:	No we'd only had it three or four years  when we went to Malton  and Pam said then  ooh if ever you get rid of this just let me know, it's just right for me cos she's only short isn't she? •242857_244379•
*JOA:	She's only short you see. •244379_244446•
*VIC:	And she said so many chairs are so deep that my legs are dangling, she said whereas this one, it's so comfortable and I can get my feet on the floor. •244446_245239•
        Erm  and it must have been  oh I don't know, two or three years ago  must be at least two or three years ago when we were talking about, umm-ing and ah-ing, and she said well don't forget if ever you want to lose this just let me know. •245239_246980•
        Erm, yes, right, no we  shan't be losing it and of course when we decided, rang her up, oh great, so at last I can have my  chair . •246981_248023•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	Well she was gonna have the three piece suite actually but she lives in a bungalow and of course the settee was a six foot settee which they don't make now •248023_249013•
*FRE:	Mm. •249014_249015•
*JOA:	and she found that she couldn't get the settee and the chairs in because, if you remember, they were sort of open armed, they, they were very wide. •249015_250073•
        So anyway she had the er settee and brought a friend with her with a  well I think it was one of these Range Rovers that you can seat erm, you know, about seven and he dropped the seats down and got the settee in, I don't know how he managed it. •250073_251993•
        Then I think the erm the chairs, Malcolm phoned erm  was it the homeless, was it Shelter, one of those organizations and they came and picked them up. •251993_253897•
        Which, gonna say the chairs, they went to an organization didn't they? •254013_254534•
        It was  Samaritans, no. •254545_254604•

*VIC:	But it's not as hard as one that we tried cos we wanted a firm one, she wanted something firm but nice and high. •257062_258041•
