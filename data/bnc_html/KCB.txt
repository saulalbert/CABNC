Sarah (PS0E2)  [572] It's totally different.
Ann (PS0DY)    [573] It's super!
Antony (PS0E3) [574] Yeah, we've finished the bathroom.
Graeme (PS0DX) [575] Yeah.
               [576] Yeah, it's very good!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [577] Well the thing is, I mean ... it's like buying it as
               you're going ahead and just totally re-tiling it and going
               round.
Ann (PS0DY)    [578] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [579] I mean, the Anaglypta we're painting looks lovely, but as
               I say you can re-paint it as it goes
Graeme (PS0DX) [580] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [...]
Ann (PS0DY)    [581] That's right.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [582] And then we're going to make a bi a little bit extra.
Ann (PS0DY)    [583] I mean, it's lovely!
Graeme (PS0DX) [584] Well it's the same as our place,a that paper is ... as far
               as I can see is ... jet black underneath!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [585] Oh!
Ann (PS0DY)    [586] Which ones?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [587] The paper in our lounge and in the hall, and tha where you
               put that piece to cover it up, it's all black under there where
               it's ... wearing on the corners of the wall ... where you go
               round and kno it looks black, so I'm sure it's black underneath
               and you just
Ann (PS0DY)    [588] Where?
Graeme (PS0DX) [589] Th the ... the ... the paper through our house ... it is
               actually is black paper and you paint on it.
               [590] The cur
Ann (PS0DY)    [591] Really?
Graeme (PS0DX) [592] Yes!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [593] You've got wood chip haven't you, in some places?
Graeme (PS0DX) [594] It's Anaglypta, yes.
Ann (PS0DY)    [595] Yes.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [596] Well it's, in the bedroom we're gonna paper it, Anaglypta
               and paint.
Ann (PS0DY)    [597] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [598] Because, what?
               [599] Something, we don't wanna pa paint the walls cos there's
               so many ... like ... bits that are wrong with the walls but we
               want ... if we Anaglypta it, it wo
Graeme (PS0DX) [600] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [601] it won't show them up.
               [602] You're only going out again, you won't want your [...] !
Graeme (PS0DX) [603] Sorry?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [604] No, I'm talking to the cat.
Ann (PS0DY)    [605] Oh oh!

Sarah (PS0E2)  [608] No , I'm not calling you a [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [609] But, no.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [610] Erm ... but ... once you're [...] , erm ... we do really
               ... it's trying to wallpaper that'll go with our bedspread, er
               without
Graeme (PS0DX) [611] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [612] being too patterned.
Ann (PS0DY)    [613] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [614] Can't really have it too patterned up there.
Ann (PS0DY)    [615] No.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [616] If we really couldn't find anything for that, so what
               we'll ... like, we're gonna paint it,Anagly An Anaglypta it
               again
Ann (PS0DY)    [617] Yes.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [618] then paint it ... a colour.
               [619] And do it tha that way round.
Ann (PS0DY)    [620] I think it really looks nice upstairs!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [621] Yeah.
               [622] And the it's outside!
Ann (PS0DY)    [623] Yep!

Sarah (PS0E2)  [625] Mm?
Ann (PS0DY)    [626] When's
Graeme (PS0DX) [627] He's
Ann (PS0DY)    [628] he coming?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [629] No, we've had the outside
Graeme (PS0DX) [630] He's done it!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [631] painted!
Ann (PS0DY)    [632] Oh you've done it?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [633] Yes.
Graeme (PS0DX) [634] That's what I went out to look at.
Ann (PS0DY)    [635] Oh I see!
Antony (PS0E3) [636] Mhm.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [637] Had the whole lot done, he said it'd take about ... two
               and half
Ann (PS0DY)    [638] Oh lovely!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [639] days
Antony (PS0E3) [640] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [641] and [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [642] That's what I said, a hundred and ninety pound, I said if
               you could do my house for that I'd be laughing!
Ann (PS0DY)    [643] I think it's marvellous!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [644] But it's, well considering he had to re-putty all the
               windows, it wasn't just like he had to one
Ann (PS0DY)    [645] I think that is very good!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [646] he had to
Graeme (PS0DX) [647] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [648] literally
Ann (PS0DY)    [649] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [650] smooth them all
Graeme (PS0DX) [651] Well my
Sarah (PS0E2)  [652] down and go off to [...] .
Graeme (PS0DX) [653] Mine have got to be re-puttied as well, in places, quite a
               bit .
Sarah (PS0E2)  [654] Mm.
               [655] So yeah, he was very good!
Ann (PS0DY)    [656] Seemed very good [...]
Sarah (PS0E2)  [657] Very good apparently round here!
               [658] These are now having theirs done but he's done quite a
               number of them in this area.
Ann (PS0DY)    [659] Yes.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [660] Good business for him I suppose.
               [661] [...] . But then we're going to do the er ... garden.
               [662] The [...]
Ann (PS0DY)    [663] Yep.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [664] and get that done. [...] .
Graeme (PS0DX) [665] Well I've had the mower ... serviced.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [666] Yeah?
Graeme (PS0DX) [667] It looks, it's come back looking [laughing] like a brand
               new mower [] !
Sarah (PS0E2)  [668] A ne ne ne new one.
Graeme (PS0DX) [669] No, very good.
               [670] No they've really cleaned it up, it looks beautiful!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [671] Good!
Graeme (PS0DX) [672] Well it's never been serviced since the day we bought it
               and that must be a good ten years ago.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [673] Mm!
Antony (PS0E3) [674] Did you have the blades sharpened and that?
Ann (PS0DY)    [675] Yes.
Graeme (PS0DX) [676] Well I put new blades on actually
Ann (PS0DY)    [677] Really, really good!
Graeme (PS0DX) [678] er ... and that was one of the problems, I couldn't
               tighten them, I didn't have
Antony (PS0E3) [679] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [680] the right equipment because, they're awkward to put on
               because the nuts are on the top of the ... on the top of the
               blade.
Antony (PS0E3) [681] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [682] So you gotta get away and underneath and I haven't got the
               ... rer rer ... the socket spanners that would do it, so ...
               well I haven't got a spanner let alone a socket ones that would
               do it!
               [683] And er
Sarah (PS0E2)  [684] Do you want a bit of lemon juice in your drink?
Graeme (PS0DX) [685] Yes please love.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [686] Father.
Ann (PS0DY)    [687] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [688] So, I told them that it had new blades on but they wanted
               it really tight, and they wanted tightening up and that so ...
               yeah.
               [689] I saved them and I put them car engine oil [laughing] in
               [] !
               [690] Which was partly the reason why I wanted it serviced, it
Sarah (PS0E2)  [691] There's yours then.
Ann (PS0DY)    [692] [...] , moved up the car is it over? [tv on]
Sarah (PS0E2)  [693] It's okay.
               [694] But George [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [695] [yawning] Yeah, I thought it was very good [] with this
               erm ... the thirty six for the servicing plus your part that
               they
Antony (PS0E3) [696] That's better!
               [697] I had my er, serviced yesterday.
Graeme (PS0DX) [698] That wasn't thirty six pounds, I bet?
Antony (PS0E3) [699] Er, no, hundred and twenty for [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [700] Ye
Antony (PS0E3) [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [701] Yes.
Antony (PS0E3) [702] But actually, I paid cash and it
Ann (PS0DY)    [703] No.
Antony (PS0E3) [704] had everything done, it had brakes, had the lot.
               [705] Whole lot!
Graeme (PS0DX) [706] Wish I could get mine done for that!
Antony (PS0E3) [707] Well it's a mechanic that we use
Graeme (PS0DX) [708] Oh.
Antony (PS0E3) [709] and er ... just did
Ann (PS0DY)    [710] Oh!
Antony (PS0E3) [711] me a favour.
Ann (PS0DY)    [712] Running.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [713] Whe then again is yo could I go to Southampton and
Antony (PS0E3) [714] Mm.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [715] and back in it [...] ?
Ann (PS0DY)    [716] Well exactly!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [717] I expect my car to be ... [...]
Ann (PS0DY)    [718] Of course it does!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [719] Oh well!
               [720] Cos I'm doing about what, about three hundred fi three
               hundred fifty miles a week just going to work and back [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [721] Oh that is ... what, fifteen thousand ... fifteen to
               twenty thousand a year isn't it?
Ann (PS0DY)    [722] You do almost twenty thousand miles a year!
Graeme (PS0DX) [723] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [724] I know.
Ann (PS0DY)    [725] Bits.
               [726] Picks up all
Sarah (PS0E2)  [727] No.
Ann (PS0DY)    [728] the mess now in one go.
Graeme (PS0DX) [729] That's not bad actually Sarah, cos I mean ... when I come
               home for lunch at
Sarah (PS0E2)  [730] It is when you [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [731] when I come home for lunch ... er, and things like that I
               clock up about ... two hundred and twenty, to two thirty, two
               fifty maybe a week just
Sarah (PS0E2)  [732] I do forty miles a day
Graeme (PS0DX) [733] doing that!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [734] going to work and back.
Graeme (PS0DX) [735] Yeah.
Antony (PS0E3) [736] Yeah but Sarah doesn't use a car ... much er
Sarah (PS0E2)  [737] Oh no.
Antony (PS0E3) [738] most of the time.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [739] No that's right.
               [740] Do on the odd occasion but
Graeme (PS0DX) [741] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [742] no you just use it for that ... and I'm not going anywhere
               else
Graeme (PS0DX) [743] No.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [744] cos once I'm parked, I'm parked.
Graeme (PS0DX) [745] Well yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [746] No ... I mean ... but there might be an earlier promotion
               now.
Ann (PS0DY)    [747] Oh really?
Graeme (PS0DX) [748] Wha what this is in the management ... side?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [749] Oh yeah, er well ... be a different one to that to start
               with ... but it'll be earlier.
               [750] What's actually happened is, first of all Tracey's
               leaving, she's been promoted to Area Telesales Manager for
               Talking Pages ... so she's going up to Slough ... and ...
               Michelle will be going for that position, and one other girl ...
               [...] ... and the two others that are on management development,
               one is now leaving cos she's like, burnt out, she doesn't want
               to do it any more ... and the other one's going into the field
               so ... it's literally just me and this other girl and Michelle,
               but I'm obviously just starting, but next time around ... it'll
               just be me again Di , and Dianna is good at her work
Ann (PS0DY)    [751] Mm.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [752] but she jus just hasn't got a [laughing] personality [] !
Ann (PS0DY)    [753] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [754] Erm, she's a very aggressive person!
Graeme (PS0DX) [755] Oh right.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [756] And manner
Ann (PS0DY)    [757] Oh yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [758] not, not even like in the right situation, she's like just
               aggressive all the time and nobody particularly gets on with her
               or likes her because of this.
               [759] And, they do say that they don't feel that ... unless she
               changed her personality
Graeme (PS0DX) [760] Mm.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [761] she probably wouldn't become a manager, because usually
               you think you can change and develop but ... I think she'll be
               then be able to become a manager and she'll ... sort of learn,
               [laughing] but she'd have to [] actually change her personality
               for it.
Antony (PS0E3) [762] Would she have to change her personality or not?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [763] [whispering] Shut up [] !
               [764] But, er, so hopefully Michelle will get this next ...
               Tracey's position, and obviously sort of in ... in the meantime
               and providing her position comes up they ... are bringing in a
               Telesales County Secretary, which wasn't gonna come in for about
               a year cos they wanted to sort of like, trial it, but now
               they've decided if that's what they want the position to do ...
               erm ... it'll probably happen in the next two months and they
               said for me to go for it from our division, so I said right,
               okay.
Antony (PS0E3) [765] [whispering] Oh she won't like that [] !
Graeme (PS0DX) [766] That'll be in Southend, will it still?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [767] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [768] Good!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [769] Well it's actually just basically the team ... it's a new
               position that they've actually made ... within each team now,
               within each division ... which is like, you're dealing with
               higher accounts but a different type of account as well.
Graeme (PS0DX) [770] Oh, jolly good!
Ann (PS0DY)    [771] Oh very good!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [772] So
Ann (PS0DY)    [773] Very good!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [774] It's all looking good!
Ann (PS0DY)    [775] Sarah?
               [776] Sorry!
               [777] Ca can I have some sugar?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [778] Do you want sugar?
Ann (PS0DY)    [779] Yes please.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [780] Do you normally usually have sugar!
Graeme (PS0DX) [781] She has since
Ann (PS0DY)    [782] Yes, in these.
Graeme (PS0DX) [783] she's been in the hospital.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [784] [tut] [tut] [tut] , bad habit!
Graeme (PS0DX) [785] In fact, I bought
Ann (PS0DY)    [786] I know!
Graeme (PS0DX) [787] I found in that chemist shop when I was looking there ...
               er, refill Nutrene.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [788] What made you start on sugar again?
Graeme (PS0DX) [789] So those
Ann (PS0DY)    [790] Well I I like it.
Graeme (PS0DX) [791] so she'll be able to refill all those two Nutrene packs,
               what
Ann (PS0DY)    [792] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [793] you said, it was one in your purse to take with you and
               ... the one at, the bigger one at home.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [794] Oh erm ... [...] and all

Sarah (PS0E2)  [796] that.
Ann (PS0DY)    [797] Lovely!
Graeme (PS0DX) [798] Yeah, that's at home.
Ann (PS0DY)    [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [799] It's a sweetener.
Ann (PS0DY)    [800] Well I can't tell the difference.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [801] No.
Ann (PS0DY)    [802] No, I like it.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [803] Well you used to.
Ann (PS0DY)    [804] Mm!
               [805] I love it!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [806] [...] ... How's it going?
Ann (PS0DY)    [807] Especially ... with
Graeme (PS0DX) [808] Well
Ann (PS0DY)    [809] co a cup of coffee
Graeme (PS0DX) [810] it's going well.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [811] Well we got the bill from Mr
Ann (PS0DY)    [812] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [813] for
Ann (PS0DY)    [814] Ah!
               [815] Yes!
Graeme (PS0DX) [816] for your mother's treatment at the hospital ... six
               hundred and sixty pound!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [817] Is that all?
Ann (PS0DY)    [818] Tha that is the
Graeme (PS0DX) [819] Well he's the arthritis man
Ann (PS0DY)    [820] just the arthri [...]
Sarah (PS0E2)  [821] Oh for the arthritis?
Graeme (PS0DX) [822] The arthritis man, yes!
               [823] We haven't got
Sarah (PS0E2)  [824] I was gonna say, for the other one
Graeme (PS0DX) [825] But we haven't got his yet.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [826] That's gotta be [...] more than that, cos that's basically
               what my fares cost.
Graeme (PS0DX) [827] Well his'll be a thousand pound for the operation, being a
               major operation, it will be the fact that it's skull.
Ann (PS0DY)    [828] It'll be very, very expensive.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [829] Well when I had my boob done ... including consultation,
               his was about seven hundred pound.
Ann (PS0DY)    [830] Mm.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [831] I had my face done, and oh God, it was about five hundred
               pounds!
Graeme (PS0DX) [832] Well Mr was over a thousand pound for the ... gall bladder
               operation
Sarah (PS0E2)  [833] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [834] but
Ann (PS0DY)    [835] I never
Graeme (PS0DX) [836] er
Ann (PS0DY)    [837] even knew, [...] that one.
Graeme (PS0DX) [838] but he won't get that now for it because ... they've
               graded them, so that if it's, it's keyhole surgery type now it's
               er, it's a lower figure than
Sarah (PS0E2)  [839] Because, you're not actually opening them up.
Graeme (PS0DX) [840] That's right.
Ann (PS0DY)    [841] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [842] Oh!
Graeme (PS0DX) [843] So that was the embarrassment I had to do when we went and

               rates do you?
               [844] And, he said yes I do and waved the leaflet at me, he says
               I know all about that but ... but you've got to now otherwise
               you you
Sarah (PS0E2)  [845] Mm!
Graeme (PS0DX) [846] could find yourself let in for two or three hundred pound
               ... because
Sarah (PS0E2)  [847] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [848] BUPA won't pay it.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [849] Well shall we go in the dining room?
Ann (PS0DY)    [850] Did you know how much I'd lost?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [851] Mm?
Ann (PS0DY)    [852] Eight pounds.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [853] Did you?
Graeme (PS0DX) [854] Well a bit more than eight pounds actually, it was over
               eight pound ... over half a stone.
Antony (PS0E3) [855] Well not only have you got a bit missing, you hadn't had
               anything to eat for ages did you?
Ann (PS0DY)    [856] No, I didn't have anything for five days!
Graeme (PS0DX) [857] Five days on a fluid diet wasn't it?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [858] Mm!
Graeme (PS0DX) [859] Most of which was water as well.
Ann (PS0DY)    [860] Well I don't eat mu very much now do I?
Graeme (PS0DX) [861] Well no, you don't.
               [862] You miss a lot of your meals though.
Ann (PS0DY)    [863] Yep.
Graeme (PS0DX) [864] I measured the scar on your mum's tum last night, it's six
               and half inches without allowing for the
Ann (PS0DY)    [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX) [865] the wrin you know
Sarah (PS0E2)  [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX) [866] the wrinkles of the stomach, so I should think it's a good
               seven inches.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [867] Eh?
Antony (PS0E3) [868] Ya.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [869] Big one!
Graeme (PS0DX) [870] And I'm going to ask Mr when I see him that ... if he
Ann (PS0DY)    [871] Graeme you can't!
Graeme (PS0DX) [872] I, course I will!
Ann (PS0DY)    [873] Oh honestly he's so nice!
               [874] I wish you wouldn't ask him that!
Graeme (PS0DX) [875] If he trained at Saint Swithin's!
Ann (PS0DY)    [876] Honestly!
Graeme (PS0DX) [877] [laughing] Well you remember the film with Ru James [...]
               []
Sarah (PS0E2)  [878] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [879] says er, where ... the chap put a tentative mark on the
               stomach and he
Sarah (PS0E2)  [880] That's Doctor at Large, and Doctor at Sma , at Small isn't
               it?
               [881] I remember that.
Ann (PS0DY)    [882] That's right.
Graeme (PS0DX) [883] And he sa
Ann (PS0DY)    [884] It was very good!
Graeme (PS0DX) [885] he berated him for being
Sarah (PS0E2)  [886] Knife happy.
Graeme (PS0DX) [887] Yeah.
               [888] Oh yeah!
               [889] He just went, choo!
Antony (PS0E3) [890] Sarah?
Graeme (PS0DX) [891] Like this with the
Sarah (PS0E2)  [892] Well that's the problem I had with my boob wasn't it?
Graeme (PS0DX) [893] Oh!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [894] The doctor started work the day I went in, and she pre-
               warned me and I said to him, no big cuts please?
               [895] And she said to him, when I got out she said oh, was he
               knife happy?
               [896] He usually is!
               [897] I said, yes thanks!
Ann (PS0DY)    [898] Oh dear!
Graeme (PS0DX) [899] Watched an interesting programme ... the other night on Q
               E D ... er, it was to do with people who ... have hare lips and
               cleft palates
Sarah (PS0E2)  [900] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [901] where th ... the a apparently, you know, they put them
               right as se when you're very young now
Sarah (PS0E2)  [902] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [903] but they have found that ... in a lot of cases that the
               ... bones starts growing so therefore, when you're ... in your
               late teens, twenties, maturing ... your bottom jaw is growing
               out from the rest of ... your jaw bone.
               [904] So they had this girl which they showed er, where they had
               to ... break all the bone up under here
Sarah (PS0E2)  [905] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [906] and rewire it and pull the who
Antony (PS0E3) [907] That's [...] , oh that was on telly weren't it?
Graeme (PS0DX) [908] Sorry?
Antony (PS0E3) [909] That was on telly yesterday.
Graeme (PS0DX) [910] On Q E D.
               [911] Yeah but ... but of course this chap has been doing this
               research in erm ... Bangladesh wasn't it, I think?
               [912] But, you know, some of the cleft palates you saw and they
               were
Ann (PS0DY)    [913] They were terrible!
Graeme (PS0DX) [914] Oh!
               [915] Pull yo co co well you can imagine why people hid
               themselves away.
               [916] And this chap, I mean he was ... oh this, it was almost
               sickening to look at!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [917] Mm
Graeme (PS0DX) [918] And ... this ... th th this three surgeons go out from
               here ... and they do all their research on the various and they
               operate from eight o'clock at night to eight in the morning,
               non-stop, using three theatres, each doing a forty five minutes
               ... one, and then another one takes
Sarah (PS0E2)  [919] Cos they can't eat properly with cleft palates anyway
Ann (PS0DY)    [920] No.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [921] can they?
Graeme (PS0DX) [922] No.
Ann (PS0DY)    [923] No.
Graeme (PS0DX) [924] And this chap in pen, and ... it showed them drawing on
               his ... lips when he was anaesthetized where you
Sarah (PS0E2)  [925] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [926] thought he'd cut and things like this ... and then they
               showed you the chap the next day ... and he was completely
               different!
               [927] He he could walk down the street without people looking
               and staring at him.
               [928] They're amazing!
Ann (PS0DY)    [929] Terrible for them!
               [930] They're awful!
Graeme (PS0DX) [931] Amazing , what they can do now!
               [932] But, but they're saying that, ooh apart from I think the
               ... what they're really saying is that it's ... better to wait
               till ... in
Sarah (PS0E2)  [933] You're older.
Graeme (PS0DX) [934] you're older and do it then
Sarah (PS0E2)  [935] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [936] because ... as I say,
Sarah (PS0E2)  [937] At least
Graeme (PS0DX) [938] it stops growing.
Ann (PS0DY)    [939] Mm. [scraping something]
Sarah (PS0E2)  [940] Ha!
               [941] Are you enjoying yourself there?
Ann (PS0DY)    [942] Somebody's enjoying it!
Antony (PS0E3) [943] I haven't got a vice, but it ha
Graeme (PS0DX) [944] Well if you've do , If I'd known I'd have bought you a, a
               clamp over for you to
Sarah (PS0E2)  [945] You got that clamp!
Antony (PS0E3) [946] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [947] Yeah, oh well would help, yeah.
Antony (PS0E3) [948] It wouldn't really hold it tight enough.
               [949] That should do nice, I've got one here.
Graeme (PS0DX) [950] Cos I've got the ones that Budgie had like that.
Ann (PS0DY)    [951] We were going to have Gertrude this afternoon.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [952] Mhm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [953] No the other way round
Ann (PS0DY)    [954] And look after her.
Graeme (PS0DX) [955] We were gonna go there for tea.
Ann (PS0DY)    [956] No they didn't!
Graeme (PS0DX) [957] She asked if we'd go over there for tea this afternoon!
               [958] I said no, we're going to Sarah's.
Ann (PS0DY)    [959] Oh I thought we were going to Sarah's today.
Graeme (PS0DX) [960] And then I said we were coming to Sarah's, so she sends
               you her love.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [961] Yes.
               [962] I'll send it back.
               [963] Say hello to her.
               [964] Have they heard from Cara?
Graeme (PS0DX) [965] I don't know.
               [966] I ... Cara's
Ann (PS0DY)    [967] Well she has done once.
Graeme (PS0DX) [968] Cara's due back next month.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [969] Mm?
Graeme (PS0DX) [970] Cara's due back next month.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [971] Yeah?
Graeme (PS0DX) [972] Yes, I didn't realize that but she's got to come back fo
               for an exam or something wasn't it?
               [973] Yeah
Ann (PS0DY)    [974] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [975] if it's in er ... I didn't think she was coming back till
               July when the term finished, but she's coming back in ... I'm
               sure Gertrude said March.
Ann (PS0DY)    [976] I think it is March.
Graeme (PS0DX) [977] Cos she hasn't applied for a green card to work, cos
               there's point
Sarah (PS0E2)  [978] Oh hasn't she?
Graeme (PS0DX) [979] because she's not gonna be there long enough to do it.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [980] Oh!
               [981] It can take so long to get one as well!
               [982] She'd be better looking for a job, and when she gets ...
               give a
Ann (PS0DY)    [983] Yes.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [984] job, getting it then.
Ann (PS0DY)    [985] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [986] I think there's no difficulty over that, in the ... area
               they are, and the hospital they're at.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [987] What's he doing?
Graeme (PS0DX) [988] Well he's at the sa , he's got the scholarship to this erm

Ann (PS0DY)    [1008] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1009] we decided to get a new one, and use the new numbers.
               [1010] Now that the [...] were rather dark for it, so we
               wouldn't be able
Ann (PS0DY)    [1011] Oh I see!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1012] to see them.
               [1013] And er ... we went to get one, and measured it and it was
               right size this box ... but
Ann (PS0DY)    [1014] Mm.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1015] the other one, but ... even though it opens outwards, a
               bit comes in ... and a bit comes out and so he had to chip away
               at the
Ann (PS0DY)    [1016] Oh I see!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1017] door so that it was around to there.

Graeme (PS0DX) [1042] Yes I know.
               [1043] Mine aren't gonna be any problem at the moment are they?
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1044] Antony hasn't been to the dentist for about six years!
               [1045] Antony has got a temporary cap on one of his teeth but
               he's had it about twice really.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1046] Yeah, if it's
Antony (PS0E3) [1047] Good grief!
Ann (PS0DY)    [1048] only a temporary one.
Antony (PS0E3) [1049] It was when I was about ... twelve ... I broke the front
               of my tooth so I [...] ... I had a temporary cap put on, and it
               only lasted six months and came off!
Ann (PS0DY)    [1050] Oh dear!
Antony (PS0E3) [1051] He put another one and it's been on ... since then!
Ann (PS0DY)    [1052] Good
Antony (PS0E3) [1053] So
Ann (PS0DY)    [1054] Lord!
Antony (PS0E3) [1055] twelve years?
               [1056] They're only supposed to be sort of six monthly caps.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1057] Good Lord!
Graeme (PS0DX) [1058] Well even a permanent cap ... probably wouldn't last that
               long under normal
Antony (PS0E3) [1059] Oh yeah!
Graeme (PS0DX) [1060] circumstances.
Antony (PS0E3) [1061] I've actually got very strong teeth, they [...]

               terrible with dentists, hairdressers, and all these things ...
               though I work quite hard, I never really sort of
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1067] Your dentist is only round the corner from where you work
               though isn't it?
Antony (PS0E3) [1068] Oh yes, I know!

Sarah (PS0E2)  [1130] Does anyone else want another one?
Ann (PS0DY)    [1131] No I'm fine thank you.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1132] I wouldn't mind another one if there is one, not to worry
               otherwise.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1133] I [...]
Graeme (PS0DX) [1134] But Jim, the chap who lives next door to them came over

Sarah (PS0E2)  [1242] Having a rest.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1243] and then it's not ... disturbing her ... although we've
               been using the bottom bedroom really.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1244] Although Colin, Colin rang last night, I didn't even know
               he'd been!
Graeme (PS0DX) [1245] No.
               [1246] Well if the phone's next to me you ... pick it up fairly
               quickly after it gives it's first beep don't you?
               [1247] So it's
Ann (PS0DY)    [1248] Yes.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1249] But I've ... as I say I've got ... memory banks in for

               have it.

               the
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1265] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1266] time!
               [1267] I didn't put Debbie's in because, we don't ring New
               Zealand as much as ring Hong Kong, but ... but I've thought of
               it being a dangerous number but I'm, there it is!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1268] Yeah.
               [1269] ... [yawning] Ah [] !
Antony (PS0E3) [1270] We've got loads of numbers on this phone!

               is press send and it'll ring it.

               lighter

Antony (PS0E3) [1315] five P a minute.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1316] Oh yes.
Antony (PS0E3) [1317] So it's quite expensive.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1318] It is very expensive innit?
Graeme (PS0DX) [1319] Well I know with Arnold and Antony is ... Arnold's not so
               bad cos he uses his quite a bit er ... but the tendency with
               Antony is, when the bill comes in each month ... th ... the
               rental is double what ... the usage is most of the time.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1320] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1321] Oh we try and use ours ... as little as possible but
               still we've had high bills.

               they've

Graeme (PS0DX) [1340] that they've just ... discounted ... users.
               [1341] But you can't ... I only get it on line one ... because
               line two ... I just use as an a ... as an incoming call line, or
               if I'm ... .
               [1342] caught on one and I want to ring out in the other at the
               same time I can use it.
Antony (PS0E3) [1343] Doug's got tha , a goo , a good system, which is another
               new one.
               [1344] It's it's part of the Star system.
               [1345] But he he's got a ... two lines on one phone
Graeme (PS0DX) [1346] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1347] and you only need a normal phone
Graeme (PS0DX) [1348] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1349] er, I suppose it's got one of those R buttons on
Graeme (PS0DX) [1350] Ah yes!
Antony (PS0E3) [1351] but it's now ... erm, if the phone rings and he picks it
               up ah, er and he's talking to someone on the phone ... someone
               else tries to ring
Graeme (PS0DX) [1352] Yes.
Antony (PS0E3) [1353] erm ... it won't be engaged, they will get a er er er, a
               erm voice saying ... erm ... the caller is on another call at
               the moment please hold the line
Ann (PS0DY)    [1354] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1355] and, you hear o this, er like three beeps ... and if you
               press the R it will hold wha , the conversation you're on
Graeme (PS0DX) [1356] You're on an ... you can now go
Antony (PS0E3) [1357] and you can speak to the other people, and then you
               switch back
Graeme (PS0DX) [1358] Mm, it's
Antony (PS0E3) [1359] or, hang up and then the phone will ring and you'll get
               the other who's
Graeme (PS0DX) [1360] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1361] there.
               [1362] It's quite clever.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1363] But it could be annoying to the person holding on.
               [laugh]
Antony (PS0E3) [1364] And they've got
Graeme (PS0DX) [1365] cos you've been answered so you start clocking up don't
               you, at that point?
Antony (PS0E3) [1366] And they've got a call barring system as well, as well ,
               I like that!
               [1367] ... Erm ... say, you ca , you can ... tap in a code
Graeme (PS0DX) [1368] Yes.
Antony (PS0E3) [1369] and that phone will be useless, won't be able to ring out
               on it
Graeme (PS0DX) [1370] Yeah.
Antony (PS0E3) [1371] or ... you can ha , tap another code in and it'll only
               make local calls ... and another code you can only make
               nationals
Graeme (PS0DX) [1372] Mm.
               [1373] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1374] er , calls in this country ... and erm ... another code
               and it, you
Graeme (PS0DX) [1375] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1376] can phone anywhere you like ... all over the world.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1377] Yeah.
               [1378] Trouble is with this quarter, with this discount I'm
               probably ... not going to get to a hundred pound at the office
               because I've been using it at home so much.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1379] Mm!
Graeme (PS0DX) [1380] But I now get er er er, get an itemized bill from ...
               Telecom, so I'll be able
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1381] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1382] to ... re-charge on the basis of what's been charged.
Antony (PS0E3) [1383] So what happens, say if you pho , phone the dirty phone
               numbers?
Graeme (PS0DX) [1384] Th that'll be on.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1385] That's right!
Antony (PS0E3) [1386] You can, you can find out.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1387] Well I only did it out of curiosity basically to ... to
               see how much ... er, one spent in ... in calls with th , like
               Lyndsey in Hong Kong.
Antony (PS0E3) [1388] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1389] And I suppose it's almost
Antony (PS0E3) [1390] Mind you, that's pre , I've only ever known that
Graeme (PS0DX) [1391] fifty percent of your phone bill on most occasions.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1392] The only
Antony (PS0E3) [1393] Only on
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1394] unusual calls we
Antony (PS0E3) [1395] on
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1396] make are er itemized.
Antony (PS0E3) [1397] on normal phone bills, but er the international calls ...
               international call they do.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1398] Yeah.
               [1399] Well it only gives you units used though
Antony (PS0E3) [1400] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1401] it doesn't ... tell you the number it went to.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1402] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1403] And this does you see, you get it with the number.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1404] Do you know all that now?
Graeme (PS0DX) [1405] It's quite interesting that where you think you've ...
               you've rung say, Freda or Amber ... in the evening and you've
               had quite a lengthy conversation in, mentally you think that
Ann (PS0DY)    [1406] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1407] and when the bill comes in you find it was only eighty
               six P or something like
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1408] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1409] that.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1410] You expect it to be more like three quid or something.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1411] Yes tha that's right!
Antony (PS0E3) [1412] And, do you know now, from from Bournemouth ... erm
Graeme (PS0DX) [1413] That's er er, Antony
Antony (PS0E3) [1414] frequently used ... trunk calls
Graeme (PS0DX) [1415] there's some on the
Antony (PS0E3) [1416] frequently used trunk calls
Graeme (PS0DX) [1417] Mm.
Antony (PS0E3) [1418] erm ... are not ... for example, if you phone ... London
               from Bournemouth it's not ... the same band as ... if you phoned
               ... erm
Graeme (PS0DX) [1419] That's right.
Antony (PS0E3) [1420] Brighton from Bournemouth
Graeme (PS0DX) [1421] That's right.

Antony (PS0E3) [1423] because it's
Graeme (PS0DX) [1424] numbers ... there are areas
Antony (PS0E3) [1425] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1426] now aren't there?
Antony (PS0E3) [1427] It's ... London, Bristol, Yeovil ... where else was it?
               [1428] I wasn't really looking.
               [1429] But not from
Graeme (PS0DX) [1430] Yes.
Antony (PS0E3) [1431] they don't do it from ... Banford, for example, that's
Graeme (PS0DX) [1432] Oh!
Antony (PS0E3) [1433] not the same ... exchange.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1434] No.
Antony (PS0E3) [1435] It must be this new dish that's changed, it must be ... I
               dunno.
               [1436] Obviously some
Graeme (PS0DX) [1437] I was interested too that ... got the new phonebooks
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1438] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1439] at work, and they got all the Mercury numbers in
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1440] Yep!
Graeme (PS0DX) [1441] as well.
Antony (PS0E3) [1442] Ours has got our mobile number in as well!
Graeme (PS0DX) [1443] Has it?
Antony (PS0E3) [1444] Yeah.
               [1445] And it don't cost any more.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1446] No, I know!
Antony (PS0E3) [1447] You could have one of the
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1448] Oh it should have a Mercury numbers in cos all they
               actually do is rent a B T line and pay for it.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1449] Yes, I know , yes.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1450] So
Graeme (PS0DX) [1451] But th they they ... cheaper to use aren't
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1452] Yes.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1453] they?
Antony (PS0E3) [1454] Not for local, local calls cost a bloody fortune!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1455] Local

Sarah (PS0E2)  [1457] calls are do
Graeme (PS0DX) [1458] Yes.

Graeme (PS0DX) [1460] Yeah.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1461] but er
Antony (PS0E3) [1462] Local calls are a fortune ... when you think
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1463] Yeah.
Antony (PS0E3) [1464] if you've got no B T lines.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1465] Yes, it's only on erm ... trunk calls that you really
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1466] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1467] score isn't it?
Antony (PS0E3) [1468] In fact, I think in Bournemouth you can actually make
               locals on Mercury now at the normal rate which is good!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1469] Well you might be able to get long distance [...]
Antony (PS0E3) [1470] I think it's all a bit complicated for me!
               [1471] I can't understand it all!
Graeme (PS0DX) [1472] Well what used to be simple and straightforward now
               leaves you with th ... wondering whether you got the right card
               in your pocket

Ann (PS0DY)    [1478] Are you going to explain this to them?
Graeme (PS0DX) [1479] No,wha why, we'll talk later on, don't worry now.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1480] Oh thank you.

Sarah (PS0E2)  [1607] I'll have to wallpaper your bathroom, then paint it, I
               then have to touch up the door ... cos it's that kind of paint
               ... and I had it like, on the top of the loo, I was doing it up
               a bit, and the next thing I saw was Felix coming onto the back
               of the wind ah
Ann (PS0DY)    [1608] Oh!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1609] window and I sort of pinged the cat's tray, you know, if
               I shut the door and walked back in and hid the paint on the
               side, and on a couple of occasions he was painting that window
               and suddenly this cat appeared outside
Ann (PS0DY)    [1610] Oh dear!
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1611] on the ledge!
               [1612] It's like the man who was doing ... putting the two new
               windows in.
Antony (PS0E3) [1613] Oh God!
               [1614] Put the glass in ... and he kept coming and si sit,
               trying to get on the bloody windowsill and getting out!
Ann (PS0DY)    [1615] I bet!
Graeme (PS0DX) [laugh]
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1616] But Antony was doing it and you put her on the
               tumbledryer behind him, and it was so funny cos ... he's like
               this ... with his head going round Antony looking, every

Graeme (PS0DX) [1625] Yes.
               [1626] What would they do without you now, Felix, eh?

               [1632] ... Where are you er
Ann (PS0DY)    [1633] Yes.
Antony (PS0E3) [1634] Your brakes sounded a bit squeaky in your car.
               [1635] When you came up.
Ann (PS0DY)    [1636] Did they?
Antony (PS0E3) [1637] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1638] Ya.
               [1639] It's it's almost due for a service again.
Antony (PS0E3) [1640] Sounds like you had no brake pad in it whatsoever!
               [1641] They were finished and ... which is the main reason to
               have it serviced.
               [1642] Gotta go back to the [...] .
Sarah (PS0E2)  [...]
Ann (PS0DY)    [1643] Actually, I've noticed that once or twice today.

               all.
               [1645] Could be a bit of dirt on the pad which ... squeaks,
               that's all.
Antony (PS0E3) [1646] Unfortunately, brake pads nowadays, they're not allowed
               to put asbestos in any more.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1647] No.
Antony (PS0E3) [1648] [...] the sque the squeaking.
Graeme (PS0DX) [1649] Remember when we went on that ... caravan trip up to the

               another Opel who ... was a bit of engineering type, so he took
               my wheels off and cleaned the pads for me you see.
Sarah (PS0E2)  [1666] Know wha do you know what about I remember about that
               holiday?

               cos we were renting it, and then as we went through a petrol
               station, on the way home

Sarah (PS0E2)  [1673] it had taken five [...] .
Graeme (PS0DX) [1674] There was a bit jutting out wasn't there and

                           like a child!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2235] Do you Hazel?
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2236] I think you should let her get on with it
                           Graeme.
                           [2237] The then she'll, she'll realize what she's

Graeme (PS0DX)             [2242] Well I do, I do let her get on with it, but I
                           ... have to make sure that she doesn't
Ann (PS0DY)                [2243] Wait, wait for it!
                           [2244] Wait for it!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2245] overdo it you see.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2246] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2247] And end up falling flat on her face or
                           something like that!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2248] Yeah, perhaps it'll be a good thing actually!
                           [2249] [laughing] In fact she's just complained
                           about what you're
Ann (PS0DY)                [2250] That's right!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2251] doing for her [] !
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2252] Oh!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2253] No, yeah I'll come with you [...] , you go
                           off and stay with Joyce, look after her for a little
                           while and let [laughing] Kenneth sort things out []
                           !
Ann (PS0DY)                [2254] Look after me?
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2255] Yes, I I think that she might appreciate
                           [...] .
Ann (PS0DY)                [2256] Yeah.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [laugh]
Ann (PS0DY)                [2257] Actually, I don't really mi mind him looking
                           after me, he's very good!
                           [2258] But I I don't like being treated like a
                           child!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2259] You're not treated li
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2260] Oh I'm sure we don't treat you like that!
                           [2261] I wouldn't mind someone doing the cooking!
                           [2262] Ha , I hear you're a good cook?
Ann (PS0DY)                [2263] Oh he loves, loves cooking!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2264] Well that's what's annoying [...] ,
                           [laughing] I got the help [...] [] !
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2265] Yeah but
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2266] I don't stop her doing it if she wants to!
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2267] Ann hasn't
Ann (PS0DY)                [2268] Oh Graeme!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2269] Ye
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2270] Ann hasn't done a lot of cooking for a long
                           time though, have you really?
                           [2271] Because of the ... whatever you call it
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2272] Well
Ann (PS0DY)                [2273] I do do
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2274] Oh yes!
                           [2275] Yeah she gets, she gets the evening
Ann (PS0DY)                [2276] I do the ones that
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2277] meals and
Ann (PS0DY)                [2278] ev evening meals, things like
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2279] and often a
Ann (PS0DY)                [2280] that.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2281] the lunches over weekend.
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2282] So, the thing is you shouldn't be such a good
                           cook Graeme!
Ann (PS0DY)                [2283] That's right!
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2284] That's the trouble!
                           [2285] That's what I tell everybody, when they say
                           to me, oh no, ... you know, we never go out for a
                           meal!
                           [2286] I say well ... shouldn't be such a good cook!
                           [2287] I mean, there's quite a few husbands I know
                           that absolutely hate being out!
                           [2288] They only like their wives'
Hazel (PS0E5)              [...]
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2289] cooking!
                           [2290] And I said, you know, well ... if you weren't
                           a good cook, he'd be glad to [laughing] go out and
                           have one [] !
Ann (PS0DY)                [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2291] Ah, but that's no consideration for the cook
                           then is it?
                           [2292] Cos she would like to go out and have a meal
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2293] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2294] that somebody else has
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2295] Yes, that's it!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2296] cooked, shouldn't she?
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2297] That's right!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [...]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2298] Yeah.
                           [2299] Yeah.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2300] Morning Zara!

                           [2302] Or is it good afternoon now, isn't it?
                           [2303] Yeah.
                           [2304] ... Well, did you enjoy Saturday night?
Zara (PS0E6)               [2305] Yes!

Zara (PS0E6)               [2308] Yeah!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2309] Good!
Zara (PS0E6)               [2310] Not bad.
                           [2311] Had it's er, moments, but
Ann (PS0DY)                [2312] Ha!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2313] Oh!
Zara (PS0E6)               [2314] You know that bit when ... in the last act
                           where they're ... sometimes sticking together
Ann (PS0DY)                [2315] Oh yes!
Zara (PS0E6)               [2316] and felt that ... that was a bit hairy!
                           [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2317] Oh!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2318] Well tha , they did that quite well I
                           thought.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2319] Yeah!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2320] Doing it properly in that.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2321] Yeah.
                           [2322] Didn't have an awful of trouble with that ...
                           six er, six pages of dialogue which ... sometimes
                           they're speaking together and sometimes they're
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2323] speaking alternately.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2324] they're they're speaking alternately and er,
                           it was
Ann (PS0DY)                [2325] Oh dear!
Zara (PS0E6)               [2326] it was very difficult!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2327] Mm.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2328] Very difficult
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2329] Needs good
Zara (PS0E6)               [2330] indeed!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2331] timing doesn't
Ann (PS0DY)                [2332] Oh.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2333] it?
Zara (PS0E6)               [2334] Yes.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2335] Oh Yes.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2336] Yeah.
                           [2337] And er, it was bit sort of not the place to
                           learn yo , forget your lines!
                           [2338] No way!
Ann (PS0DY)                [laugh]
Zara (PS0E6)               [2339] It's a bit sort of stilted.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2340] Ah!
Ann (PS0DY)                [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2341] Well there

Graeme (PS0DX)             [2343] you are!
Zara (PS0E6)               [2344] er ... apart from that ... it all went very
                           well.
                           [2345] The set was quite ingenious, I thought!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2346] Aha.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2347] Yeah , it was pretty good, it was
Zara (PS0E6)               [2348] Yes.
                           [2349] The erm, bed-sit sort of on a raised bit
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2350] Yeah.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2351] you know?
                           [2352] Yeah.
                           [2353] The sitting room was on a [...] at the stage.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2354] Mm.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2355] But er ... the timing with the doors is very
                           good, I thought!
Zara (PS0E6)               [2356] Yeah.
                           [2357] It all went quite smoothly that bit.
                           [2358] Well I tell

Graeme (PS0DX)             [2363] Yeah.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2364] was quite good, in a way.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2365] Were you there when you, ee, you talking
                           about that, there were two mistakes on that one er
                           er ... doorbell went and it wasn't telephone, it
                           should have been the telephone!
Zara (PS0E6)               [2366] Telephone.
                           [2367] Aha.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2368] And the other one was the car ... coming and
                           going.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2369] Going.
                           [2370] It was the wrong side.

                           the room [laughing] and the car was [...] [] !
Zara (PS0E6)               [2372] Oh Right!

Zara (PS0E6)               [2374] Oh well we got, the timing was out was it?
Hazel (PS0E5)              [laugh]
Zara (PS0E6)               [2375] Actually, they they ... they did one car
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2376] Going away.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2377] going away, but it was still
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2378] and didn't come back.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2379] on the wrong si , it was on the wrong side
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2380] Yeah.

Zara (PS0E6)               [2383] the other side of th , you know, should have
                           come from the other side.
Joyce (PS0E4)              [2384] Was it a [...] ?
Zara (PS0E6)               [2385] No!

Graeme (PS0DX)             [2395] Yeah.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2396] Changed too many sets.

                           Strand Theatre that er ... people are moving in this
                           week and they've got no authority to move you see.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2500] Really?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2501] This is what Ni , I spoke to Nigel about on
                           the phone on Friday and said he could
Ann (PS0DY)                [2502] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2503] stop it, so ... so he had to erm ... just
                           talk to our solicitors this morning and try and get
                           this sorted out ... between the two solicitors.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2504] Did you get through to him?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2505] Yes, yes, got through.
                           [2506] Well not David it's a er, Susan ... got
Ann (PS0DY)                [2507] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2508] Susan.
Zara (PS0E6)               [2509] Have you read it now cos I shall have to
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK) [2510] Hello!
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2511] So erm
Zara (PS0E6)               [2512] take it back?
                           [2513] I can't do it, can you do these
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK) [2514] How have you been, alright?
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2515] That a bathroom cabinet up there?
Zara (PS0E6)               [...]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2516] so they're, you know, explain the situation
                           to her because it's between the two solicitors to
                           sort out now and get the writ, writ sorted out
                           before ... anything could be signed to ... to allow
                           them to ... move in.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2517] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2518] It's a tricky situation actually because
Ann (PS0DY)                [2519] Well what do you say the
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2520] the lease
Ann (PS0DY)                [2521] the [...] ?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2522] well th the, the people who have the actual
                           lease of the offices ... have gone out o er ... gone
                           out of business in a sense, they're no longer
                           operating ... and ... because, they were part of a
                           bigger organization, that bigger organization
                           guaranteed the rents.
                           [2523] Now this bigger or , this other organization
                           which ... wants to put th ... er ... another tenant
                           in as in a, as a sub-let to their lease
Ann (PS0DY)                [2524] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2525] and, I am saying that ... they haven't got
                           the lease
Ann (PS0DY)                [2526] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2527] even though they might be part and parcel of
                           the same organization, they are not the leaseholders
                           so they can't ... make the arrangements, so if they
                           want to make the arrangement they must have the
                           lease assigned to them first, then we will come to
                           terms with them over land and to under le ... under
                           let.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2528] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2529] But, you know, they're just being ... going
                           on as if they are ... i in a position to grant
Ann (PS0DY)                [2530] To do.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2531] to do!
                           [2532] And, having said that we haven't, at this
                           moment, approved an under-let anyway, so
Ann (PS0DY)                [2533] No.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2534] But, you know, the situation is difficult in
                           that ... if the ... people did move in there's ...
                           not a lot you can do about it because ... it would
                           mean that ... you would have to surrender the lease,
                           which means you've let ... the guarantors off the
                           hook for paying the then ... and you're left without
                           a tenant whatsoever.
                           [2535] Erm it's, it's trying to get an amicable
                           solution to it.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2536] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2537] Oh.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2538] Darling, will you get me a ... a scone,
                           another scone ... teacake
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2539] Teacake.
                           [2540] Aha.

                           teacake, oh it's fifty five.
                           [2549] What do you have, tea or coffee?
Ann (PS0DY)                [2550] Coffee.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2551] Coffee?
                           [2552] Hundred and seventeen, a hundred and seventy
                           two again isn't it?
                           [2553] So I will pay that.
                           [2554] ... What have you done to yourself that
                           hurts?

Graeme (PS0DX)             [2558] Oh!
                           [2559] One seventy two.
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK) [2560] Is it?
                           [2561] Oh right! [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2562] Thank you madam.
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK) [2563] Thank you.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2564] Thank you.
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK) [2565] You oft are you?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2566] I'm off now, yes.
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK) [2567] Okay then.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2568] Mm.
                           [2569] Yes, yes
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2570] Anything
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2571] yes.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2572] exciting at the office?
                           [2573] No! [laugh]
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2574] Oh well, yes.
Ann (PS0DY)                [2575] Well lots of mail.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2576] Lots of mail?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2577] Lots of mail.
                           [2578] An interesting situation which I've just
                           explained to Ann, whereby at the weekend ... there's
                           a set of offices in the Strand Theatre which ... the
                           company that we're operating from there so ...
                           stopped
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2579] Can you manage?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2580] business
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK) [2581] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2582] but they're part of a much bigger
                           organization who
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2583] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2584] was guaranteeing the rent, so the rent ...
                           has been paid even
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2585] Paid.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2586] though the office
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2587] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2588] has been vacated ... and they wanted to grant
                           an under-let to another
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2589] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2590] body of people to try and reduce the rent
                           they were paying ... erm ... but it, it's er, it's
                           initially a difficult situation that we have said
                           yes we don't mind you ... erm ... we don't mind
                           granting you that, but ... we want to know ... if
                           you will accept an assignment of the lease ... from
                           the previous company cos
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2591] Mm.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2592] from our point of view ... in nineteen ninety
                           three, we have to deal with somebody over a revision
                           of the rent ... and if the company doesn't exist ...
                           it makes it very difficult!
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2593] Yeah!
                           [2594] Yeah.
                           [2595] Quite!
                           [2596] Yeah.
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2597] You see, so ... these people were going to
                           move in at the weekend so had to put a stop to that
                           cos they had no authority to move in there ... until
                           the solicitors try and get this thing sorted out.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2598] I wonder what they'll do?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2599] But it ma , it's a ... it leaves you this
                           interesting situation in that ... if ... they had
                           moved in ... what do you do, cancel the lease and
                           get them out?
                           [2600] Which means the guarantor no longer has to
                           pay you the rent so you ... you don't really want to
                           forego that either, yeah.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2601] So you really, bit of a clever stick aren't
                           you?
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2602] Yes.
Hazel (PS0E5)              [2603] Yeah.
                           [2604] Very, very [...] .
Graeme (PS0DX)             [2605] However, it'll all come out.

Ann (PS0DY)                          [2659] My mum and dad were nice, they
                                     never used to make life hard for us and if
                                     we wanted to go out, all they wanted to
                                     know is where we were going
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK)           [2660] That's right.

                                     wanted to, we could take anybody home
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK)           [2665] That's right

                                     don't either, at all.

                                     to be back

Graeme (PS0DX)                       [2673] it was a special occasion which
                                     they, then they'd accept that you'd be
                                     back after midnight, but

Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK)           [2675] Mm

                                     them they were reasonable with you, I, I
                                     can't understand young people of today
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK)           [2677] We were very

                                     weren't they?
Graeme (PS0DX)                       [2679] Mm
Ann (PS0DY)                          [2680] Well it was like Zara
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK)           [2681] really
Ann (PS0DY)                          [2682] I used to try and not say er, you
                                     know, to make her feel uncomfortable and
                                     that sort of thing, but I did use to draw
                                     the line when they used to be eleven and
                                     half past eleven saying goodnight and I
                                     had to get up at half past, six o'clock,
                                     seven o'clock
Unknown speaker (KCBPSUNK)           [2683] Oh yes
