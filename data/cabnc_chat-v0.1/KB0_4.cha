*BOB:	Mm •137166_137193•
*ALA:	but they've changed now, they're more or less on the same basis as the U R C •137193_137635•
*BOB:	Oh •137646_137691•
*ALA:	but erm  it didn't look a very attractive proposition at the time •137691_138402•
*BOB:	Oh •138402_138416•
*ALA:	for one thing, if we'd taken one of their houses and I'd died first, my wife would of been left without a home •138416_139286•

*BOB:	Mm •157073_157098•
*ALA:	south London they're two different worlds aren't they? •157098_157337•
