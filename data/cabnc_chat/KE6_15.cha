*BEV:	It's like cling film   (.) but it's microwave  (        ) .
*WEN:	Well what if I don't get it?
*BEV:	Must have it do you?
*WEN:	Yeah , it says it!Take it out the foil tray   (.) erm   (.) put in a   (.) well, a pyrex   (.) and erm   (.) cover with micro co  (.) microwave film.
*BEV:	Cover it with a   (.) lid.
*WEN:	Does that matter?

*BEV:	I said it's probably cold enough out there.
*WEN:	No, well I'll put it in  (        ) . (.) Where's the Microwave Know How then?
*BEV:	Ah?
*WEN:	That big one?

*BEV:	Cover and wrapping, wrapping food.
*WEN:	Yeah.What in there?
*BEV:	Ah?
*WEN:	In the microwave?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	 [reading microwave book] By covering   (.) the food during microwave cooking you can speed up the cooking procedure.This also prevents splattering and juices all over the cooker wall  [] .That's the gravy.
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	It would be, yeah.
*WEN:	Right.Yeah?
*BEV:	 [reading] There are several ways of covering food
*WEN:	Oh   (.) right.
*BEV:	use a tight fit lid
*WEN:	Mm.
*BEV:	to a dish
*WEN:	Mm.
*BEV:	or use a saucer or plate to cover.
*WEN:	Mm.
*BEV:	Use cooking bag   (.) cooking bags or roaster bag
*WEN:	Mm.
*BEV:	for vegetables   (.) and meat.Remember to replace the metal ties   (.) provided with elastic band
*WEN:	Mm.
*BEV:	or string.
*WEN:	Mm.
*BEV:	Cling film, plastic wrap is inva , invaluable   (.) to all microwave users.But do remember   (.) to puncture holes  [] .
*WEN:	It's , it says that.
*BEV:	So   (.) I would imagine   (.) as long as you put a lid on it
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	it's doing exactly the same.
*WEN:	The same thing.Do you do that when you do scrambled eggs then?Do you put anything on it?
*BEV:	No.
*WEN:	No.Why don't that   (.) work the same then?
*BEV:	Because it cooks at the top and then cooks inwards.
*WEN:	Oh.My  (        ) , I better go down and get cling film I suppose.
*BEV:	I wouldn't bother!
*WEN:	Won't bother.
