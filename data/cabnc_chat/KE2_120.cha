*MAR:	What were we talking about? •955435_961085•
*TER:	I don't know . •965485_968155•

*TER:	Helen, yeah. •983495_985575•
*MAR:	Anyway erm  Richard was feeling quite relieved about the •988695_993925•
*TER:	I think so, yes the planning  •994115_996645•
*MAR:	about the  •996645_997075•
*TER:	permission being turned down, yeah. •997075_998105•
*MAR:	No I don't blame him, I mean   •998105_100277•
*TER:	No I don't. •100277_100345•
*MAR:	lot of times I've, you know, thinking sort of is  •100345_100629•
*TER:	I mean he's got a nice house there, he doesn't want it erm •100862_101074•
*MAR:	That's right. •101074_101111•
*TER:	spoiled. •101112_101113•
        The trouble is I mean if, if it did, it came up and he wanted to sell it would of  it would obviously decrease the value. •101113_101994•
*MAR:	Yeah, that was what he was thinking of. •101994_102224•
*TER:	You'd get all the rubbish from a  take-away as well blowing into his garden, I mean it wouldn't have been very pleasant. •102389_103190•
*MAR:	much  he reckons his house is worth now. •103190_105341•
        But I suppose in a way they would have then been contemplating  selling their own house and getting somewhere else before in fact •105486_106171•
*TER:	Yeah. •106209_106239•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	It's a shame because I mean it  I think what they've got is really  you know, er er er they'd be hard put to it to get anything  as good really at the price I think. •106239_107912•
        Mind you they'd probably get a hundred thousand for theirs I should think now. •107912_108192•
*MAR:	Yes I think, that's what I was thinking of. •108192_109150•
*TER:	Do you remember when we used to come out here for the primroses? •109150_109282•
        That's a long time ago isn't it? •109282_111087•
