*ANN:	or the er what is it? •124152_125672•
        Is there a lot of high impact in it? •126132_127742•
*JAM:	No you got •128012_129162•
*ALI:	No not really it's pretty low impact. •129162_131902•
*JAM:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh •132032_132232•
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Yes. •132542_132742•
        I go to Maxine's erm intermediate class. •133332_137162•
        I wouldn't be able to do the you know the really high very high impact. •137342_141822•
        They •141922_142132•
*ALI:	Well I mean I do I've been doing aerobics a long time. •142132_144722•

*ALI:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	And apart from the fact that you're less than half  my age . •149902_152652•
        It helps doesn't it? •153122_155212•
        Although the intermediate class most of them seem to be teenagers and twenties. •155212_160862•
        There's a few thirties and there's a couple I think probably in their forties but when it comes to the high impact they don't do it they just step it out you know. •161822_175442•
        Erm  •175442_175702•

*ANN:	the advance class on a the first one on a Friday morning is nearly all high impact. •180632_186612•
*ALI:	Is it? •186612_187072•
*ANN:	There are very few floor exercises. •187122_189292•
        Well I wouldn't be able to do that. •189582_190782•
        But I can keep up with the intermediate class and I said to Maxine, Does this get any harder? •191142_196472•
        And she said, No we do different exercises but there's this amount of high impact. •197072_201262•
        So. •201862_202322•
        Oh what's the  •203442_204072•

        And it was so tangly. •240722_241942•
        And she wouldn't have it brushed and she was shaking her head about when you tried to brush it so. •243382_248022•
        She's lost all her curls from the bottom of it. •248852_250782•
