                                     cos of his money?
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [265] Well she hasn't got much choice
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [266] It can be done.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [267] has she?
                                     [268] I mean
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [269] But, yeah, she did have a choice but
                                     I mean ... sh you do with people with
                                     money.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [270] I don't know, I, I ... Yeah I
                                     suppose so.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [271] You do, they gr they you see them in
                                     a different light.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [272] Well her mother was saying, they got
                                     engaged and, you know, there was drinks
                                     [...] and her mother was saying oh the
                                     wedding's gonna be in February, it's gonna
                                     be a quick wedding and all this ... so I
                                     was talking to her, I said Cath I said
                                     when are you are getting married then?
                                     [273] She said I, she said I'm not getting
                                     married.
                                     [274] So I think her mother's gonna be in
                                     for a bit of a shock because they all
                                     think that they're gonna get married so
                                     quick, I think she just wanted to get that
                                     ring on her finger so she can reap the
                                     ackers ... and I think she's gonna do a
                                     runner.
                                     [275] ... Which I don't blame her there
                                     again, if he's stupid enough to ...
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [276] If he can't see it, aye.
                                     [277] ... I mean a lot of people [...]

                                     like that.

                                     or nothing
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [845] Sit ups you want to do.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [846] it's the exercise I should do.
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [847] Yeah but it's so boring exercising.

Lyn (PS0DP)                          [849] Yeah but you're on cloud nine.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [850] Yeah I am.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [851] And when I took those [...] I didn't
                                     come down for a, and that frightened me, I
                                     said to Russell I will never ever take
                                     speed ... because it's if, I was er we
                                     were in the pub right on a Sunday morning
                                     and I was there but I wasn't there, I was
                                     somewhere else.
                                     [852] ... And people were just saying to
                                     me what's the matter?
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [853] I've taken speed as powder right ...
                                     and ... erm ... it had an effect [...]
                                     like these ones. ...
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [854] It's a [...] thirty ... have a look
                                     on the bottle if they're thirty
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [855] Thirty mils yeah.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [856] They're thirty mils, they're the
                                     strongest ones see.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [857] Yeah.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [858] You can get twenty five.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [859] Get fifteen too isn't there,
                                     sometimes you can
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [860] Yeah.
                                     [861] You can get erm a red and a grey one
                                     ... I think that's the fifteen, then you
                                     can get a yellow and a grey one, that's
                                     the twenty five.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [862] And the all yellow ones are the
                                     thirty.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [863] Are the thirty.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [864] Yeah.
                                     [865] Perhaps I'm going a bit too strong
                                     see.
                                     [866] ... Cos I mean for someone like me,
                                     I was saying that like, before I used to
                                     say to you ... I wouldn't eat all day,
                                     right?
                                     [867] But then, when I le left you and
                                     went to work I'd eat those pasties and
                                     crisps and then perhaps I'm still hungry,
                                     sometimes I'd go and have a Chinese all at
                                     the wrong time, that's what all that is
                                     innit?
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [868] When I lost
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [869] And then lying on it.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [870] [yawning] when I lost my weight with

                                     stone.
                                     [871] I s I was still only down to sort of
                                     eleven stone, but if I get to like ten

Hayley (PS0DN)                       [875] Yeah.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [876] but ten stone something
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [877] I used to be eleven stone.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [878] and I look quite slim because I'm
                                     not a small person.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [...]
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [879] I used to be eleven stone, when I
                                     was eighteen, nineteen I was eleven stone
                                     Hayle.
                                     [880] And that's honest to God.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [881] Never well you must've looked big
                                     Deb cos you're small.
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [882] Oh I was massive man I had a double
                                     chin an'all.
                                     [883] My arms were massive.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [884] I don't remem [...] remember you
                                     like that.
                                     [885] I never remember you like that.
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [886] No well I wasn't.
                                     [887] I moved to [...] from Nelson and
                                     that's when I was big.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [888] And how did you lose all your weight
                                     then?
                                     [889] You just lost it?
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [890] I went on an egg diet ... with the
                                     girls in work
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [891] Egg diet?
                                     [892] I thought
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [893] Yes.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [894] they were fattening.
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [895] No it wasn't just eggs though it was
                                     erm ... like salads and there was steak,
                                     you could have one meal a day, right, but
                                     it was eggs for your breakfast, eggs for
                                     your dinner, your lunch
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [896] Now I love eggs [...] but I thought
                                     eggs
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [897] and then it was salad
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [898] binded you.
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [899] They do.
                                     [900] They do bind you
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [901] But you'd have to take something to
                                     make you
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [902] but the thing is you can you eat
                                     fruit in between see Hayle so you're
                                     having ... you know,you your roughage.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [903] Yeah your roughage with that yeah.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [904] Oh I see.
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [905] As well like in between.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [906] When I went to slimming I used to
                                     get [...]
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [907] I tell you what I lost a stone and
                                     half in two weeks
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [908] I used to have erm
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [909] by sticking to that.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [910] I'd get up in the morning I'd have
                                     my two pieces of wholemeal bread toasted
                                     with a scraping of marmalade on, right,
                                     and my butter cos I like that.
                                     [911] For my dinner then I'd have er
                                     jacket potato with tuna ... then about
                                     four o'clock I would have an apple and an
                                     orange and maybe a Mars Bar cos [...]
                                     right.
                                     [912] And then before eight o'clock then I
                                     would make myself a big meal, I'd have a,
                                     a huge salad ... I'd do tinned potatoes
                                     cos they were, on this diet tinned
                                     potatoes aren't fattening
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [913] Aren't they?
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [914] No they're not.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [915] No so I'd have tinned potatoes
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [916] I don't like them I don't like [...]

Lyn (PS0DP)                          [917] I'd have tuna fish, I'd have ham,
                                     everything because you can eat as much
                                     meat ... you could sit down and eat ...
                                     cabbage, swedes, runner beans,
                                     cauliflower, peas ... every vegetable
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [918] That's what I'm doing for him now.
                                     [919] But I don't like veg I don't.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [920] and that's not counted in your, in
                                     your calories, you can just eat that, it's
                                     all free so you can eat as much as you
                                     like of that.
                                     [921] Cos if I was really hungry I used to
                                     go upstairs, I'd get all the frozen veg
                                     out, I'd cook a bit of everything
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [922] It's not so bad [...]
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [923] I'd slam a pork chop under the grill
                                     and I'd just eat that.
                                     [924] And it used to fill me up and I'd
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [925] Yeah.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [926] that's nothing then, I could eat as
                                     much as that as I liked.
                                     [927] ... And bacon's not fattening
                                     grilled on this diet, you can eat as much

Hayley (PS0DN)                       [968] You should make him sleep on your

                                     move over.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [969] I've never seen him like this
                                     though, I've never se he hasn't shaved for
                                     about four days.

                                     we haven't.

                                     [992] Years ago this was when it was
                                     Carfours

                                     have no records
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1000] We've had it for years.
                                     [1001] Well Russell bought it when he was
                                     at home in his mother's house.
                                     [1002] And then we, when we got married we
                                     took it to our house.
                                     [1003] I mean it is a bit, well
Gordon (PS0DL)                       [1004] The only way they check [...] now
                                     is if you go [...] hire.

Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1006] Yeah.
Gordon (PS0DL)                       [1007] If you've just bought it from a
                                     shop ... and you've had it years [...]
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1008] Yeah.
                                     [1009] Anyway now they spot check.
Unknown speaker (KCAPSUNK)           [1010] Yeah but [...] they can can't they?

                                     having your telly on now, they can still
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1012] If you've got a telly in the house
                                     without having a licence.
                                     [1013] And I mean it's, it's a lot of
                                     money innit?
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1014] and it's without havi without
                                     having a telly on. ...
Gordon (PS0DL)                       [...]

Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1016] And you can stop them from coming
                                     in as well if you've got debts like, yeah.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1017] Yeah it says, I read the thing and
                                     it says ... I haven't gotta let them in
                                     unless they've got a warrant so the first
                                     time they come they wouldn't have a
                                     warrant, surely, so they're gonna have to
                                     go away and get a warrant and in that time
                                     then I'd have to get a licence wouldn't I?
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1018] Well you could answer the door now
                                     and you say well I don't know love, I'm

                                     [1055] Because they paid us extra because

                                     and you and my mother.
                                     [1056] So remember the committee said oh

                                     [1057] ... That's why.

                                     girls, you ready now to start?
                                     [1119] And all of a sudden they unlock
                                     them doors out there and they come running

Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1120] Oh that's true, yeah.
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1121] in here
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1122] Pair of us had panic attacks didn't
                                     we?
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1123] I had a panic attack, I told her, I
                                     said I'm shaking all over.
                                     [1124] And I thought if I go from behind
                                     this bar now I'll never go back behind it
                                     now.
                                     [1125] So I calmed down see and I was
                                     alright after about ten minutes.
                                     [1126] But this year it was much better
                                     because they'd let them all in because it
                                     was raining weren't it?
                                     [1127] So they couldn't leave them all
                                     standing outside.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1128] Bloody stupid anyway.
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1129] So when they walked in here it was
                                     packed in there and it was full in the
                                     bar.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1130] Even if they'd let them in let them
                                     get their seats and said look the bar is
                                     not open.
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1131] Well that's what they should do
                                     every year because do you know what it was
                                     much better this year.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1132] They do it in the Labour Club, you
                                     can go in there
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1133] Within ten, fifteen
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1134] right
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1135] minutes we'd serne served everybody
                                     by that bar this year.
                                     [1136] Now what was it like last year, all
                                     night long we slogged didn't we?
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1137] They let them stood out there in
                                     all that rain didn't they?
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1138] Yeah.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1139] I mean in most clubs I mean they
                                     come in, they have a game of cards
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1140] They let you in but the bar's not
                                     open.
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1141] don't they, get their tables and
                                     that?

                                     I've just slagged them off.
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1143] Who?
Hayley (PS0DN)                       [1144] They might use this against us.
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1145] What are you on about you

Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1262] I mean one Friday I come, I left
                                     here about ten to one I went in the house
                                     ... and I went to bed and I was starving
                                     and Gordon says oh I'm hungry I, so I went
                                     out straight down the stairs, come back up
                                     with a bloody big tray ... cups of teas
                                     now when I, after drinking down here,
                                     pasties now what I'd taken home what I
                                     didn't sell here, crisps, sandwiches ...
                                     and a after I'd ate it I felt so guilty.
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1263] You couldn't go back to sleep then.
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1264] I couldn't go back to sleep, but I
                                     felt so guilty about what I'd eaten. ...
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1265] Ooh I know.
                                     [1266] Like say last week me and Russell
                                     never got up before, oh my mother and
                                     father come to the house right and it was
                                     quarter past ten ... and we were still in
                                     bed and my father put the milk ... cos
                                     the, my milkman leaves my milk by the gate
                                     because, with the dog, he always used to
                                     leave the gate open so I used to let the
                                     dog out in the morning and the dog would
                                     go out ... so I said don't put the milk by
                                     the door, leave it just, put it over the
                                     gate cos I like the gate left shut.
                                     [1267] So that's what he does and my
                                     father come in, put the milk by the door,
                                     knocked the door and me and Russell were
                                     still in bed fast asleep.
                                     [1268] I mean we'd been up
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [1269] Did they knock you up then?
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1270] No she left us still.
                                     [1271] And waking up about a quarter past
                                     ten, go downstairs and make tea and toast
                                     ... takes the paper up, I take Freeman's
                                     catalogue ... put the, the wireless on and
                                     he's looking through the paper and I'm
                                     [laughing] looking through Freeman's
                                     catalogue [] saying
Debbie (PS0DM)                       [laugh]
Lyn (PS0DP)                          [1272] oh this'll look nice in the summer

                                     for an hour and thought oh I've gotta get
                                     up now the dog's whining to go out, then
                                     we get up then when the dog starts whining
                                     to go out. ...

                           [1795] I haven't stuck the gears on.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1796] You can move them anyway you want to Sean,
                           it's up to you to do that ... to work them.
                           [1797] So you're fast
Sean (PS0DT)               [1798] And even then a lot of this stuff to get on
                           and off.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1799] It's only part of the Lego this Sean and make
                           a ... look holding the stick.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1800] I haven't stuck that as well have I Sean.
Sean (PS0DT)               [1801] Well I know how to put it on anyway.
                           [1802] It tips, so you can put these on.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1803] Well, I didn't stick it all because
Kirsty (PS0DU)             [1804] My, my book's come off
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1805] so that you could play with it isn't it?

Debbie (PS0DM)             [1807] So stick these back on.
Sean (PS0DT)               [1808] Mm.

Sean (PS0DT)               [1811] Alright.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1812] That's this one.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1813] Is there two books in her hand?
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1814] Lovely, lovely tractor!
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1815] Is there two books in her hand?
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1816] So Sean's got the [...] .
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1817] And I put them in back of her hood cos she
                           couldn't hold my hand.
                           [1818] So he put them
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1819] Yes.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1820] in her hood and Sean watched her bringing
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1821] Well you just pay for that.
Sean (PS0DT)               [1822] And they never fell out.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1823] You had to read it use Sean's library book.
Sean (PS0DT)               [1824] Yeah, they used to mine.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1825] [reading] The Cooper Family Lived On It's Own
                           [] .
Sean (PS0DT)               [1826] We've got two of those!
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1827] Have you?
                           [1828] [reading children's book] They were
                           disturbing [...] at the top [...] .
                           [1829] And there was Nebbins.
                           [1830] Nebbins was Mr Cooper's only horse.
                           [1831] ... Nebbins was Mr Cooper's only horse who
                           worked very hard, pulled the plough and the hay
                           cart, and his, all the other jobs that a horse had
                           to do on a farm.
                           [1832] Nebbins was happy!
                           [1833] He had lived with the Coopers nearly all his
                           life and all Coopers like him, especially Tom [] .
                           [1834] There's Tom look!
                           [1835] Kirsty.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [cough]
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1836] See Tom with the apple there.
                           [1837] [reading] Tommy came to the barn every day
                           after Nebbins work was finished and always brought
                           him an apple, or a lump of sugar.
                           [1838] Great brother Jim gave him fresh water and
                           plenty of oats.
                           [1839] One day a terrible thing happened!
                           [1840] And Mr Cooper and Nebbins were returning from
                           the field [...] []
Kirsty (PS0DU)             [1841] Like that!
                           [1842] Now they've picking hands look!
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1843] Mm!

                           stings my hand cos I ... cos
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1845] Never mind.
                           [1846] Never mind.
Sean (PS0DT)               [1847] I caught , I caught took my hand to those
                           cats.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1848] Dad bought your bike down here.
Sean (PS0DT)               [1849] I didn't even feel like
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1850] Only that you've not been on his bike [...]
                           ... or yesterday.
                           [1851] I thought perhaps, you'd bring your bike
                           down.
Kirsty (PS0DU)             [1852] I got a little purse!
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1853] I know!
                           [1854] That's lovely that.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1855] I only just taken his bike for him cos it
                           went a bit rusty cos out the back and er ...
                           couldn't find [...] then could we?
                           [1856] I only once then we lost it again, lost the
                           [...] somewhere, it's up the hill somewhere but I
                           don't know where.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1857] Well I bought you a couple isn't it?
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1858] Yeah.
                           [1859] I it's up the hill somewhere but I can't find
                           it.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1860] [reading] Oh dad!
                           [1861] The tractor is here come and see!
                           [1862] Of course Nebbins had never seen a tractor
                           before, he wondered what it was.
                           [1863] When they reached the farmyard there it
                           stood, a great shiny red thing with big wheels at
                           the back and little wheels in front.
                           [1864] And what a fuss everyone was making about it!
                           [1865] Tommy was climbing all over it!
                           [1866] And Jim was giving it a drink of water.
                           [1867] Why he was the one who had always bought
                           Nebbins a drink when he came home.
                           [1868] Today, no one paid any attention to Nebbins,
                           not even Tommy!
                           [1869] Old Nebbins felt hurt and slowly set off
                           towards [...] [] .
Sean (PS0DT)               [1870] What, well is Nebbins the tractor?
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1871] No!

Sean (PS0DT)               [1873] Ah!
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1874] [reading] That Nebbins heard Mr Cooper and
                           the tractor returning from the field.
                           [1875] Jim and Tommy were with him.
                           [1876] Mr Cooper drove it straight into the barn and
                           stopped next to Nebbins [...] []
Sean (PS0DT)               [1877] I can't fit the gear in now!
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1878] I told you it was hard didn't I?
Sean (PS0DT)               [1879] Mm.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1880] Have to take it out.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1881] You shouldn't of take him off see Sean.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1882] [reading] How dreadful thought Nebbins! [...]

Gordon (PS0DL)             [1883] Let's see if I can do it for you.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1884] Mr Cooper and the boys rushed over [] .
Sean (PS0DT)               [1885] No, you've glued it all up.

Sean (PS0DT)               [1892] Oh, I'll keep them on.
Gordon (PS0DL)             [1893] Will you see if I can put it on too Sean?
Sean (PS0DT)               [1894] No I don't want them to be there.
Debbie (PS0DM)             [1895] [reading] How dreadful!
                           [1896] Nebbins kicking his knees out!
                           [1897] Mr Cooper and boys rushed over to calm him.
                           [1898] At last they were closing the barn door
                           hearing Mr Cooper say ... Jim I could [] [tape

Debbie (PS0DM) [2552] And I just know that
Gordon (PS0DL) [...]
Debbie (PS0DM) [2553] even [...]

Gordon (PS0DL) [2571] I'm sure I miss it too.
               [2572] What it is, when you got snooker on and just snooker
               you're quite ... content to watch it, but when you got darts on
               one side and snooker on the other side ... darts is such a
               faster game
Gordon (PS0DL) [2573] Mm.
Hayley (PS0DN) [2574] Faster than snooker.
Gordon (PS0DL) [2575] Of course it is.
               [2576] An and er, I mean, I love snooker but when there's a
               choice of darts and snooker ... I always watch the darts because
               it's faster, it's more counting.
Hayley (PS0DN) [2577] They reckon that er, er er er oh is it, er the whole
               family go there, children and all, you know!
Gordon (PS0DL) [2578] It used to be fifty thousand innit, the prize?
               [2579] But it's gone down to twenty eight
Gordon (PS0DL) [2580] Twenty eight it's gone down to.
Gordon (PS0DL) [2581] twenty eight now innit?
Hayley (PS0DN) [2582] Twenty eight thousand so that's
Gordon (PS0DL) [2583] Mind you, that's better than nothing innit?
Hayley (PS0DN) [2584] I think there's about
Gordon (PS0DL) [2585] No.
Hayley (PS0DN) [2586] thousand in the [...]
Debbie (PS0DM) [2587] I was about to say
Hayley (PS0DN) [2588] I er ... eight thousand difference in er ... first and
               second wasn't it?

               that mac?
               [2592] The long trench coat?

               from me.
