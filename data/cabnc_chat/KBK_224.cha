*CHR:	Blowing awfully quickly, that's the second out of the sixth that you bought yesterday.
*NOR:	Yes   (.) I bought them in Sainsbury's they are Sainsbury's bulbs aren't they?
*CHR:	Philip's bulbs.
*NOR:	I mean that was a new bulb, well that's the second one you've used.
*CHR:	Second one I've used.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	No, not yet   (.) What's on television?
*NOR:	Well there's only look like two that are anything   (        ) discussing that film about the lambs   (.) whatever it's called with Jodie Foster, the rest didn't look very interesting but you may feel differently.
*CHR:	Yes, a bit forgettable isn't it? (.) I put my specs outside.
*NOR:	They're in   (        ) 
*NOR:	Oh here they are
