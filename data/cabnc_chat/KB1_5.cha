*JUN:	No, your eyes.
*KAR:	Yeah, you know two times I've been, and me eyes are going right mad.
*JUN:	Just a minute while your mum tells me.
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	 (        ) 'cos of bird, you've always had Bobbie.
*SAS:	 (        )

*JUN:	You're always dusting with him, 'cos he's right dusty.
*KAR:	Right er, maybe that's what it is then. (        ) seems funny though, it's only started.
*JUN:	Albert says I've got to sell 'im.Shall we sell you?
*UNK:	Mm.
*JUN:	Who's gonna make you, scratching his bloody head, and he's made his head bleed.
*KAR:	 (        ) would you have Colin   (        ) about him.
*JUN:	Well.
*ALB:	Colin.
*JUN:	I ended up paying for him.She's not bothered, she never goes near him.
*ALB:	Never goes near him.
*JUN:	She never goes near him.She's frightened to death of 'im
*KAR:	 (        ) isn't it.
*JUN:	I know.But I don't think Geoff would be very pleased.
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	Well, if you say to him, that just say that   (        ) and that, that's you know, oh, just say something like, just say something like   (        ) I can't keep up with him Dennis, he's throwing loads of dust about, just say to him, (        ) think about selling, to you want to buy him back or, you know.
*JUN:	Well, they won't, I don't think they'd have him back.
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	No and that's   (        ) a 
*ALB:	I don't think, I don't think sell him.
*SAS:	Has he got to wait.
*JUN:	A.
*ALB:	I don't think you'd get what you paid for him.
*JUN:	Probably not, but I mean, cage is worth a hundred and fifty quid.That's what Russell paid for the cage.
*SAS:	Oh, look.
*KAR:	Mm
*SAS:	Oh, look.
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*SAS:	What.Look, (        ) 
*KAR:	 (        ) that he's into, (        ) 
*JUN:	Well, I mean, he's no problem to me.I'm not bothered about him.You know, I'd rather keep him than sell him, but
*ALB:	 ((cough)) It's like everything else, you've always summat else to bloody feed.
*JUN:	Mm.
*KAR:	By the way, when we had that pair, that were driving me mad, and then that one died, when we were in bungalow.Other one would learnt how to open a crack, and it were in that cage, and it could hear birds outside.Anyway in the end we let er Kenny's grandad have 'im, I mean, 'cos they got me mum's bird.They've got two of his own, he ended up with four birds.
*JUN:	Yeah.
*KAR:	But at least they were happy, you know what I mean.'Cos they were with other birds.But I never missed, I never missed him. (        ) 
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*JUN:	I don't think you get attached to birds like you do animals.
*ALB:	I don't think you get attached to birds like dogs.
*JUN:	Not like dogs and cats.
*KAR:	No.
*JUN:	I mean Albert said, (        ) if we do get that bungalow, we are   (        ) 'cos the owner, he said she'll disappear.
*ALB:	She'll disappear.
*JUN:	I mean I'll be upset about our Whisky, 'cos we're, I mean, we've had a long time, although she's not a pet   (.) pet, you know what I mean.
*KAR:	What   (        ) feel like.
*JUN:	Well, they they just, they go away when you take them somewhere fresh. ((cough)) and they don't know where they are.
*SAS:	That one.
*ALB:	They're very very  (.) 
*JUN:	Sometimes, you're lucky, and you know, if if you keep them in long enough
*ALB:	We've always had cats, always had cats, when we lived at  and we moved into  and we'd had this one cat years, it were old cat.I wouldn't say it was ready for popping off, you know what I mean.
*KAR:	Yeah
*ALB:	It were always fit and we were only there a fortnight, three weeks disappeared.
*JUN:	I mean, if our Whisky died, I wouldn't be as upset about it, as I would about these.But if she disappeared I'd be worried all time.
*ALB:	And yet  (.) 
*KAR:	Aye.
*JUN:	You know, like when our Dawn's kittens disappeared.It, they weren't bothered, I think Mick took them away meself.
*KAR:	Yeah.
*JUN:	I'm convinced he did.
*ALB:	I think he did.
*JUN:	But I were I were upset about that, you know.
*KAR:	 (        ) without a break.
*JUN:	 (        )  (        ) 
*JUN:	No, it's a can't be in the garden, can he.
*KAR:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	Yeah.Same as with these next door.I get right upset about Paddy.I mean she's give his kennel away now, and he's got no kennel again.
*KAR:	Ar.
*JUN:	And he's running streets, and you know how cold it was last week, and he's running streets.
*KAR:	What she give kennel away for, then.
*JUN:	I don't bloody know.
*ALB:	I think she'd give the dog away as well.
*KAR:	 (        ) 
*ALB:	Saw him coming.
*JUN:	Don't lick, don't let him lick her, Karen. (        ) 
*ALB:	Don't lick.
*KAR:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	You mutt
*SAS:	 (        ) all right.
*ALB:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	I've been round me mums this morning.
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	 (        ) I expect I'll go.
*JUN:	Yeah.
*KAR:	 (        ) any better or.
*JUN:	She said, when I went round she was sat doing crossword on bed.And then, er, I said I've just come to see if you want any cigs.She said, well our John's coming down tonight, she said, just get me twenty.I said, you might as well get forty, I said, because if he's late coming down
*KAR:	Yeah, right.
*JUN:	And he can't round shop after, you'd be stuck, and I mean, he.I don't   (.) Albert don't mind going for her cigs, but it's just that we don't get up early in the morning, you know, and if me mum's ringing at eight o'clock in the morning, 'cos she got no cigs.It's a bit unfair like, when when she could at   (        ) 
*KAR:	 (        ) I said   (        ) she said after my job at   (        ) 
*JUN:	Margaret's not very well.
*KAR:	 (        ) she hadn't seen Margaret since Christmas Eve.Yeah, but she ain't been bad since Christmas Eve.
*JUN:	Oh, no.no.But she 
*KAR:	Ov over a month ago.
*JUN:	When they came on Sunday, when it were your anniversary, she'd got diarrhoea and sickness, Margaret.I think she were off work last week.
*KAR:	Yeah.
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	I I mean, you're anything like that, but not not for a month, I mean.
*SAS:	I got two toilet papers on  (        ) .
*JUN:	Oh yeah.Well, put one in your pocket then, ((cough)) 
*KAR:	I   (        ) Margaret   (        ) last night.
*JUN:	Oh I I bet   (.) if you look at it,
*ALB:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	I don't Pete's been to me mum's for about six months.Because I can't remembering him going.He never goes without Margaret.She always goes herself, she were down there last night, by herself.He were at pub.
*KAR:	Mm.Well, I said to her, told her about not having nowt to eat from that Wednesday morning, er Wednesday dinner time, till Thursday when they went 
*JUN:	Well she took away fish last night for her supper.
*KAR:	Oh.And that she she looked shocked, you know, she didn't didn't know me like, and er, well she was shocked, and then I said I said, right   (        ) well we'll have to get together and sort something out about stopping with her, and Pete said straight away.Margaret's there every day, she goes out every morning.Right.Not that he actually asked her.
*ALB:	 (        ) years ago about Beryl.
*JUN:	I told you that's what he said.
*KAR:	And I said, aye up, I don't mean in day-time.I says on a night-time, I said, you know, she can't leave her home now, I said, she can't manage to put coal on fire, and she can't manage to get up up to eat and drink and that, I said, I don't mind dropping off and taking me turn on the night-time but I mean, but it's hard, it's hard with me with kids every night.
*JUN:	It's   (        ) for you with kids.
*KAR:	But I don't, certainly don't mind taking her down once a week or twice a week and taking me turn.
*ALB:	Karen there's no need, no need, you're needed at bloody home.
*JUN:	I mean, there's only you got kids.
*KAR:	There's no reason your Margaret can't stop when he's on nights.Or   (        ) afters.
*JUN:	No.
*KAR:	I mean, 'cos we can all   (        ) down.Only days really what's difficult for him.
*JUN:	Yeah.I don't think Pete'd stop.
*KAR:	 (        ) really.I mean, he only got to get his clothes on and go to work, the same.
*JUN:	I don't think he'd go stop.Our Margaret might go stop herself, but I don't think he'll go.
*ALB:	 (        ) 
*SAS:	Ah.You're bending
*JUN:	Watching ya.
*ALB:	Will you settle down.
*SAS:	No.
*JUN:	I don't think   (        ) Margaret would want to stop, actually.
*JUN:	No, I don't think they would.
*ALB:	None of em will
*KAR:	But er, I don't think  (        ) 
*ALB:	If no one will go down there at all and and sit with their mother for a for a couple of hours.
*KAR:	No.
*JUN:	I mean, I can't talk, because I never go.Er, to say 'cos I mean, I closest, and I don't go.
*KAR:	Yeah, but I was your  (        ) 
*JUN:	But er, me and me mum's never got on like our Margaret and me mum have.
*KAR:	No.
*SAS:	 ((giggle)) 
*KAR:	It's same as, what   (        ) ow she's gone into hospital with her, you know, and I'd actually been that day, you know what I mean, I don't mind, don't get me wrong, I'm not cross, 'cos I don't mind.But it annoys you   (        ) they they they think they're doing a lot for her 'cos they go in ev every morning.
*JUN:	Yeah, they're more thought of.
*KAR:	Yeah.
*ALB:	More thought of.
*JUN:	Has he.
*KAR:	Yeah.I mean, I know, but Colin ain't been down much this week, because Colin's been working, he's been working every day   (        ) and that, you know what I mean, it's been a bit hard for us to get down but we tried.
*JUN:	Yeah.
*KAR:	 (        ) who should try and pick kids up and then have an hour down there.
*JUN:	Well, he spends more time there than me.'Cos I've been this morning and I've cleared fireplace out, washed   (        ) 
*KAR:	No, you're not wearing your shoes in here.
*JUN:	and I've 'oovered up,
*KAR:	 (        )  (        ) 
*JUN:	and dusted and polished.That kitchen floor could do with washing, I saw a mop, but didn't see no bucket.I don't whether she's got one, but I thought, I didn't have time to do it this morning.
*KAR:	Mm.
*JUN:	So I just run round with 'oover and dusted and polished, then I made a cup of tea.
*KAR:	Who's doing the washing?
*JUN:	Our Margaret.
*KAR:	Ah.
*JUN:	I can't, our Margaret's drying it on radiators, and I says to Albert, what me mum doing with the dryer.He says, I don't know.
*ALB:	It's still there.
*JUN:	So I'm gonna ask her if I can borrow it 
*ALB:	It's   (        ) 
*JUN:	and then now I'll do her dryer washing for her.
*KAR:	Yeah.
*JUN:	I mean, I only really wanted to dry me towels, because I hate having to run out laun launderette while I'm drying all me other clothes on radiators.
*ALB:	It's more expensive to use.
*JUN:	Yes.I know it's more expensive.
*KAR:	Sasha.
*JUN:	but it's really only for towels.
*ALB:	Come in, and shut that door.
*KAR:	What you got.
*JUN:	Get, shout Barney in.Shout Barney.
*SAS:	 [shouting] Barney  [] 
*JUN:	I don't whether she doing ironing, I know she's doing washing.
*KAR:	Oh, alright.
*JUN:	'Cos she's, well, that day Albert took me 
*SAS:	Barney 
*JUN:	mum to 'ospital, and I, er she give me a lift.She dropped her washing off.I thought she'd dried it, and she said, oh, I'm just gonna put this washing on radiators, and then it, it were then that er it made me think, well, what   (        ) done with her dryer.
*ALB:	 (        ) 
*SAS:	Yeah, I know.
*JUN:	Well, 'cos I mean, she can't be paying much electric.
*KAR:	It's not that   (        ) that your Margaret ain't got time to stop there and dry it for her, you know what I mean.
*JUN:	Oh, all you got to do is put it in, somebody'll take it out.
*KAR:	Yeah.
*ALB:	Go over there, no don't, she won't go outside, keep them on there.
*SAS:	Yeah.
*JUN:	I don't know.
*KAR:	I mean, your Margaret sent a dinner down last night
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	 (        ) you know what I mean, the
*JUN:	Yeah, she she said she might.
*KAR:	 (        ) she's took er fish and that, and she's tried in ways like that.
*JUN:	Yeah.I mean I can't afford to take care   (        ) 
*ALB:	We tried to   (        ) 
*JUN:	We can afford to keep afford to   (        ) dog.
*ALB:	And Margaret's dad, when they, when my kids were little would never take our kids anywhere but they  (        ) 
*JUN:	It were me dad, it were me dad that didn't take up   (        ) 
*ALB:	And always relied on one or the other, I don't  (        ) 
*JUN:	Me dad wouldn't me dad didn't mind taking   (        ) 
*ALB:	I don't care which one.But they would never take 'em out for day
*KAR:	No, I know.
*ALB:	But they would fetch 'em and pay for them, and I even today, you cannot buy love.
*KAR:	No.
*ALB:	And it's proven my point, our Dawn wouldn't even think about   (        ) there.Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
*UNK:	Don't think about what. (        ) 
*JUN:	Our Corinne don't only go round when she got to.She goes round  (        ) 
*ALB:	Goes round   (        ) weeks ago.
*JUN:	Well, she won't go and stop.Said she won't go and stop again.
*ALB:	Who's gonna stop then.
*JUN:	When we were all on about stopping  (        ) 
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*KAR:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	I don't mind going and doing her shopping and bits, she says, I'm not stopping.
*KAR:	Yeah.When you were on about that love, what pa was saying about, you know, like every night, that our kids, when, they had their pyjamas on, and they're like, to get hold, (        ) I'm lying watching television, I'm usually falling asleep, but I put the kids, (        ) you know.And er, last time I I get in touch, me mum told me, (        ) turned round and says to me, I don't want   (        ) any more mum, I says why, he says, oh she won't let me have pillow   (        ) and then I then I think if summat else   (        ) brought to light, I   (        ) kill her
*JUN:	Yeah.
*KAR:	if she had come in
*ALB:	Yeah.
*KAR:	 (        ) and that, I know it's a filthy old thing, but it it's comfort ain't it.
*JUN:	Yeah.
*KAR:	And when they start   (        ) let them have the pillow down, they don't feel, they can't get comfortable.I know it's a little bit trivial like, but it's just, it's still  (        ) 
*JUN:	She has queer ways me mother.Karen I I'm forty-seven and I can't work me mother out, so, no chance for you working her out, few years you've known her.
*KAR:	 ((laugh)) No no, I I, I mean, she's always been alright with me really, I mean,y you know, she's not   (        ) not at all mother-in-law, she's not   (        ) 
*JUN:	Well, me and me mum's, me and me me mum's never been close.It were always like, me and our Colin were more or less with me dad, and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum.Then when they got older, me dad sort of took our John on, because our John were mechanical minded, and our Colin got pushed out a bit, 'cos our Colin weren't interested in cars.
*SAS:	 (        ) I found this.
*JUN:	Oh yeah, oh that's what that bird.Yuk.And our Colin was to be off t' fair, and that, so, me dad sort of went on to our John and pushed our Colin out a little bit.
*KAR:	Yeah.
*JUN:	But er, me and our Colin's never been me mum's favourite.It's always been our Margaret.
*KAR:	Mind you, did you see that photo that  (        ) 
*JUN:	Yeah.
*KAR:	You are, I mean, I could just work out, (        ) I said, your Margaret and John are a lot like you.She is   (        ) 'cos she's got Margaret's lips and your nose, but out of all of you, I think your your Jo you can see your John in it, can't you, more than anybody.
*UNK:	I always think our John looks more like a Prescott, 'cos he al every time I see him, I see me Uncle Bill more and more.
*KAR:	Yeah, John   (        ) used to say, years ago about how much that you're, John looks like your Brian, and I don't think he looks anything like it.
*JUN:	No, I don't.
*KAR:	And she   (        ) again now, she says like somebody   (        ) your John look like that bloke next door.What a load of rubbish, I thought well.
*JUN:	No.
*ALB:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	He looks more and more
*KAR:	Aye.
*JUN:	our Colin's getting more and more like me dad.
*ALB:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	Well, Brian   (        ) ain't it.Brian , Brian I think don't like, er,
*ALB:	 (        ) they are, they're all like that.All of them. (        ) 
*JUN:	And I think our John looks like me Uncle Bill.
*KAR:	Yeah, I think he does.
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	But then again, he did look like that photo, I think he does look like that photo, but you were younger then,
*JUN:	Yeah.
*KAR:	but he does look like Uncle Bill.Mind you   (        ) Colin's getting more like your dad every day.
*JUN:	I know he is.
*KAR:	black welding glasses on, and he turned round and he made me jump.Like oh, Colin, and then he go like this, you know, (        ) isn't it.You know, he'll come running   (        ) glasses.
*ALB:	Yeah.
*KAR:	I can't do it.And right, he made me heart jump, 'cos he looked just like your dad, and then a few days later, he's in garage again, and Johnny come in and he said, God he said, he gave me a flaming heart attack out there.I said, why, and he said, he turned round with these glasses on, then he said it was just like John's stood there.I says, don't tell me, I said, he did the same thing to me the other day, and it were only within a couple of days of each other.When he puts those glasses on, honestly he's his double.
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	I think it's the way he looks, like, if you know what I mean, you know like   (        ) pull his face and like, look over glasses, I mean, ((laugh)) he did it to me when   (        ) did it to Johnny.He probably thought   (        ) like.
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	He's like me dad, er me dad, he never had no patience, and our Colin's just like him.
*KAR:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	Mind you, I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways.I haven't got a lot of patience.But where   (.) where we're better off 'cos Albert, he's calm, where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered
