*JAM:	Who's Angeline? (.) Which is the right one for
*ANN:	The pink one's a dish cloth. (.) The blue one's the one I wipe up   (.) small stains off the floor.
*JAM:	Right.

*JAM:	What?
*ANN:	I said, I wonder how Bryony is? (.) And she wasn't very well yesterday.Every time she got a bump   (.) or knock off one of the others she was crying   (.) instead of clouting them back. (.) It must have been Richard, I do I don't think   (.) Richard's very, he 
*JAM:	Sorry, what d'ya say Richard was?
*ANN:	I said I don't   (.) well stop running the tap.I say, I don't think Richard's   (.) very well either. (.) Cos he cried more than usual. (.)

*JAM:	A   (        ) 
*ANN:	remember what Richard was using it as yesterday.
*JAM:	Well he was poking me   (.) in the groin.
*ANN:	What are we going to do about these   (.) tiles for the step
*JAM:	I dunno.
*ANN:	to cover this   (.) little hole in our path?I should hate to think what must be down there now.Tt.Oh!Well leave it cos it's   (.) it's
*JAM:	Well I told you that Fenwicks had   (.) and they were cheaper than
*ANN:	Cheaper?Fenwicks?
*JAM:	but cheaper than   (.) what they call it?The place in, the old place. (.) Yes.They were cheaper.I got the price for you.
*ANN:	Cheaper than the do-it-yourself shop up Brady's?
*JAM:	They were both
*ANN:	But when, can we get through to Newcastle?
*JAM:	Well I   (.) well I'll have a week's holiday after Easter and I've gotta go   (.) unless we go to  (        ) .And I've got a   (.) an all day meeting, I've arranged it on the   (.) Tuesday   (.) that's if we're being presented to  (        ) .
*ANN:	Which Tuesday?After they break up?
*JAM:	That's right. (.) Which is, this, next Friday.
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	So I hope to sort it out   (.) the Lenten appeal   (.) well
*ANN:	The what?
*JAM:	The Len 
*ANN:	Lin 
*JAM:	the Lenten's appeal at the schools   (.) that Mrs  was supposed to   (.) let Miss  know   (.) so she could get it off to the parents to get the money back   (.) so that they bought the scanner.
*ANN:	See, you didn't tell me about that.
*JAM:	I did tell you.
*ANN:	You didn't.All you told me   (.) go on   (.) ah   (.) only this one's
*JAM:	Miss  wanted to 
*ANN:	all you told me was that Miss  was retiring.But, I haven't to tell anyone.Which I haven't done. (.) Which I don't intend to do.
*JAM:	At the beginning of Lent Miss  approached me
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	to see   (.) what she should do about the Lenten appeal
*ANN:	Aha.
*JAM:	as she always does.Since I said, why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was   (.) plenty of children's things local?
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	So I asked if we wanted anything?And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital?
*ANN:	What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
*JAM:	Well there are special beds.
*ANN:	Oh you mean a bed?Well
*JAM:	Tt!
*ANN:	D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be 
*JAM:	Well, she just asked about a bed, so I told her that   (.) we were
*ANN:	You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?But why's 
*JAM:	She di na she just said a bed, and so 
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	I told her there were special beds that we have   (.) are very useful, in fact   (.) very necessary in some, some cases, and are   (.) painfully short of them.
*ANN:	Aha.
*JAM:	And a Nimbas bed   (.) costs two thousand pound.And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of, which costs a lot more.
*ANN:	Mhm.
*JAM:	Something like, five thousand.But I can't remember the name.Anyway, I said I'd   (.) make enquiries as to what a  (.) is wanted.And I said there's a, there's a new children's ward   (.) will open at the Wandsbergh Hospital   (.) perhaps they would like something.I saw Mrs , and Mrs  said   (.) they were aiming to raise money for the scanner appeal.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAM:	But, also they're going to   (.) have a   (.) an obstetric adult patient's department   (.) at the College Hospital for the very first time.
*ANN:	A what?A
*JAM:	An obstetric outpatients
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah.
*JAM:	and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other children   (.) with mothers then   (.) so they would like perhaps a play facility there.And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to the
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*JAM:	or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	there's very limited facilities for children to play.So   (.) but I also coaxed Mrs  about   (.) the Wandsbergh  (        ) .Anyway, she   (.) wanted to, me to go and see her, she said there we there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible   (.) and   (.) because there was an arts appeal and   (.) for arts facilities at the hospital, and all sorts of things.So   (.) I went back to Miss  and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be   (.) she thought that that would be the best idea. (.) Not the children's things at the   (.) Cottage Hospital.I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital   (.) and   (.) the children from   (.) will be invited to the hospital for that day   (.) that week, sorry.It's gonna be a week   (.)  (        ) .So she wanted to know what date it is.So I, I asked Mrs  to   (.) but would she write to Miss  and give her all the details.And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all.And that she was going on Wednesday, I think.Up she went   (.) you know
*ANN:	Hold on.Which one was going to see which 
*JAM:	It's 
*ANN:	one?
*JAM:	Mrs  was going to see Miss 
*ANN:	Was going to see Miss 
*JAM:	.
*ANN:	Oh.I see.I didn't know which one.
*JAM:	But I give them a   (.) so then I saw Mrs  on Tuesday     (.)  ((cough))  (.) when I was at Ashington.And she came up with all sorts of things that   (.) she would like for the   (.) the new Wandsbergh development.But on a   (.) but there's nothing ready of course, so th  (.) there's, there's a   (.) giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards   (.) and it's a giant one   (.) it's, it's the, the building and the blocks of   (.) things in, in the   (.) in the courtyard that make up the   (.) the time.So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the   (.) of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine o'clock and so forth.This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got 
*ANN:	Hold on.Wha how   (.) where is it going to be seen from?
*JAM:	I presume it's seen from the wards   (.) that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard.There's also erm   (.) a play area for the   (.) the children's ward   (.) there's also some murals on the   (.) the walls, various artistic murals.And, of course, they've got this grant from   (.) Artcan   (.) for six thousand pound   (.) for a proggie mat  (.) exhibition.
*ANN:	A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat 
*JAM:	Well
*ANN:	exhibition?
*JAM:	well over, over a period, it's   (.) and other things too but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it. (.) And various other art things.But also,th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden   (.) up.But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here   (.) to   (.) the Wandsbergh Hospital.But then I thought, perhaps   (.) if   (.) that 
*ANN:	I can't see the education committee   (.) with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here 
*JAM:	Well they won't 
*ANN:	to go Ashington Hospital to do a 
*JAM:	they won't so the they, they 
*ANN:	garden.
*JAM:	the, the, the   (.) education committee and the school governors have no money at all 
*ANN:	No.
*JAM:	to pay for that.
*ANN:	I would expect 
*JAM:	But then 
*ANN:	that's a very low priority.
*JAM:	well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing.They won't get the money.Th they won't pay for them to go swimming 
*ANN:	Well I don't
*JAM:	they've gotta walk to go swimming.But, I thought that   (.) now that the M S has acquired that bus   (.) and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time   (.) and it's a twenty nine seater bus.I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in   (.) but   (.) in between times it's twenty seats you see.
*ANN:	And then you'll need a P S V 
*JAM:	Well 
*ANN:	licence.
*JAM:	but, but that's, that's   (.) that's easily remedied if you could get a er   (.) a driving licence holder   (.) to take them   (.) oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents   (.) or somebody who could take the children, er, periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing.So that was a possibility.But I haven't seen Miss  about all these sort of things.But I did also say   (.) to Mrs , that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September, that it might be better to discuss it with them   (.) after I've discussed with Miss .
*ANN:	I only know one person   (.) I only know one bus driver with children.
*JAM:	There's ambulance drivers.
*ANN:	And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School.Er   (.) this   (.) letter from the Multiple Sclerosis
*JAM:	Yes.Says any 
*ANN:	that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.You're not 
*JAM:	To sixteen.
*ANN:	you're not reducing the size of the bus.
*JAM:	Well I think that's crazy.
*ANN:	And someone who's been just used to driving a car   (.) are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra
*JAM:	Well
*ANN:	tuition?
*JAM:	Well I, I 
*ANN:	Whether it's got   (.) whether it's got sixteen people in it or   (.) twenty nine 
*JAM:	Well er 
*ANN:	it doesn't alter the length of the bus.
*JAM:	I drive the minibus at the hospital
*ANN:	I know.
*JAM:	which only takes four wheelchairs   (.) and of course there's the drivers of, of the minibus things that bring them.I think, I, I would query that anyway, that just   (        ) 
*ANN:	Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition 
*JAM:	No.
*ANN:	and just drive 
*JAM:	But, but 
*ANN:	it?
*JAM:	but I query as well, whether just because you reduce the number of spa passengers in it   (.) that you, you, you don't need   (.) a P S V licence, or the equivalent isn't a P S V licence but it's, it's
*ANN:	Oh you do,the they've looked into that.
*JAM:	But it sounds   (.) doubtful to me.But anyway   (.) there's the insurance point of view.But anyway, any   (.) I mean   (.) that's the easy, and I mean, if, if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving   (.) before they take passengers out.I mean, I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAM:	I mean I   (.) I, I   (.) I   [laughing] drove the minibus    []  (.) with only somebody in with me   (.) before I drove out with people in it.
*ANN:	Didn't you da drive Dancy Dags?
*JAM:	Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that.
*ANN:	Yeah, but   (.) yo you drove that one
*JAM:	I drove it to Ashington and   (        ) 
*ANN:	Mm.You drive her to Ashington in it.
*JAM:	Yes.
*ANN:	Erm   (.) do you think I should throw these roses out?They're 
*JAM:	Aha.
*ANN:	dead aren't they?
*JAM:	I'm afraid so.
*ANN:	It's a shame.
*JAM:	Well they'll be forced for last Sunday.
*ANN:	Pardon?
*JAM:	They will be forced for last Sunday, and that was 
*ANN:	Oh I know.
*JAM:	the air wasn't it?
*ANN:	I know, but they were dead by about Tuesday.The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.So   (.) what a shame.Never mind. (.) Right, I'll put my make up on.
*JAM:	Have you decided where you want this umbrella tree?
*ANN:	Er er
*JAM:	You need a saucer at the bottom.But they're never the right size for that it wants  (        ) .
*ANN:	Well there's a huge saucer on the old one.
*JAM:	Ah but that's in it   (.) you can put one in that 
*ANN:	Well 
*JAM:	plant pot, that's a different matter altogether.
*ANN:	Jus just leave it there for now.Erm   (.) I'm going to put my make up on   (.) and think what I need from the shops.
*JAM:	Right.It's ten o'clock love.
*ANN:	I know.I'm gonna have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner. (.) I'll take that upstairs with me.Ooh!My head feels a lot better.
*JAM:	It's gotta be better.
*ANN:	 [sighing] Oh  [] ! (.) I don't 
*JAM:	That er 
*ANN:	I haven't had a   (.) a headache like this for a
*JAM:	Still it's much more quick.
*ANN:	I know.I need some   (.) le er   (.) the, I wanted a carton of live yoghurt   (.) I don't think the live yoghurt I used was any good because, for a start   [laughing] it was   [] fruit flavoured, no it wasn't, it was natural, but it said mild flavoured
*JAM:	Mm.
*ANN:	and I don't think it was the proper   (.) like the Greek style, real live yoghurt that would have 
*JAM:	Mm mm.
*ANN:	started all the fungus growing on it.It is beginning to look like a proper stone cup though.And they're saying that   (.) er   (.) okay, I'll go and get ready.
*JAM:	So do you want the yoghurt, yoghurt before we go to the   (.)  (        ) ?
*ANN:	I don't think it matters, but   (.) if the weather's still going to be freezing at night
*JAM:	And if so does, does 
*ANN:	I've got the 
*JAM:	the, [laughing] it's outside all the time anyway  [] .
*ANN:	I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still. (.) I got it standing on that brick   (.) so it would drain. (.) I wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.Some of the   (.) erm   (.) stems on it look as if the   (.) not mouldy but they're, they're sort of 
*JAM:	Well we'll just have to dig it up and put 
*ANN:	green.
*JAM:	another one in.
*ANN:	Those hyacinths in the cauldron are taking a long time to come out aren't they?
*JAM:	I know.
*ANN:	I would have thought the tulip   (.) that went in the er coal scuttle   (.) the tulips in the cauldron   (.) I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely.
*JAM:	I know.They just straightened 
*ANN:	They were 
*JAM:	up.
*ANN:	just   (.) grown up again.And those   (.) forget-me-nots   (.) that are called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers, they're coming out with erm   (.) tiny   (.) pinkey, purpley flowers.
*JAM:	I know.
*ANN:	If they're blue, so am I!
*JAM:	And then we've got miniature roses gonna come up, one that's on it own, that one with the
*ANN:	The wha 
*JAM:	on the tub.
*ANN:	Is there one in the tub?No.
*JAM:	Yes.
*ANN:	Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay, it's the other one.
*JAM:	Mhm.
*ANN:	I like the other best as well, it's the peach one.When are you going to prune them?
*JAM:	Well, when I plant that other one where you want it planted, that's
*ANN:	I wonder when er   (.) John  's going to have the erm
*JAM:	Wheelbarrow ready.
*ANN:	Yes.Oh!Said in yesterday's paper   (.) that someone had had a wheelbarrow   (.) valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden   (.) and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill.Where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible. (.) So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds.
*JAM:	Mm.
*ANN:	Cos it didn't, it didn't say   (.) a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow.
*JAM:	Well those er   (.) four tapes 
*ANN:	So we'll have to get it

*ANN:	Well I can't see very well through binoculars.
*JAM:	The Sistine Chapel.We mustn't take those big ones with us.

*JAM:	You have to rewind it, it's a 
*ANN:	all the 
*JAM:	problem.
