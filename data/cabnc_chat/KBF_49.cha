*BRE:	That's what I mean with that Jean you probably won't need    (.)  [laughing] vitamins  [] .
*JEA:	No you see I don't think normally people do.But they do say as you grow older yes.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	Cos your body isn't so efficient at processing the food you take in.No but I might, I won't 
*BRE:	No but   (        ) 
*JEA:	keep it up for ever more.But I thought I might have a   (.) a course of it.A month's vitamins perhaps.Just to   (.) top, make sure I'm topped up.But this is a good idea.
*BRE:	What's that?
*JEA:	These, these flakes.

*BRE:	Because   (.) we shut the doors.

*BRE:	We don't let any air sort of circulate.
*JEA:	And you haven't got a radiator in here of course?

*JEA:	Well she has a marvellously engaging   (.) personality.
*BRE:	Yes.That is what I think I liked about her.
*JEA:	Yes.Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	I mean the fact   (.) and it, that it was, half of it was so true.I mean it's like when 
*JEA:	Some of it was.
*BRE:	she went into the   (.) the store.
*JEA:	That was perfect.
*BRE:	They didn't want to know.But then when she went back!
*JEA:	And when she went back and she said er   (.) you didn't serve me yesterday.No.You made a mistake.A big mistake.Huge. [laughing] And she's got this enormous hat box do you remember  [] ? ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	Yeah   ((laugh)) .Yeah.Yeah no I, I don't know what, I quite liked that.
*JEA:	It irritated me a bit because   (.) what it   (.) what it was saying 
*CAR:	 (        ) dirty but   (        ) 
*JEA:	what it, what it was saying was   (.) in effect that the woman   (.) er so long as she's free and and open sexually then she can have whatever she wants.And of course A this is true  ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and we don't like it.And B it isn't actually true at all because most, most men would simply exploit that in the situation she was in.
*BRE:	I say they wouldn't sort of spend like he did.
*JEA:	No.No.
*BRE:	But I, I like you say I mean half of me 
*JEA:	There was something 
*BRE:	I liked it.
*JEA:	Yeah.Yeah.
