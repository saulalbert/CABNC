{"name":"CABNC","tagline":"A conversation analytic transcription of a spoken subcorpus of the BNC","body":"# CABNC transcription project\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\nThe CABNC corpus is a open-licensed, detailed conversation analytic\r\nre-transcription of naturalistic conversations from a subcorpus of the [British\r\nNational Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) amounting to around 4.2 million\r\nwords in 1436 separate conversations.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to produce transcripts usable for both computational and\r\ndetailed qualitative analysis. If you are a CA transcriptionist and you use the\r\ndata, please make sure you re-submit your updated transcripts to help improve\r\nthe corpus over time.\r\n\r\n## Accessing and using CABNC data\r\n\r\n### Using transcripts\r\n\r\n* You can browse the latest versions of individual CABNC transcripts as [CHAT-CA files here](https://github.com/saulalbert/CABNC/tree/master/data/cabnc_chat), and the latest stable release of CABNC can be [downloaded as an archive here](https://github.com/saulalbert/CABNC/blob/master/packages/cabnc_subcorpus_chat.tar.gz?raw=true).\r\n* The corresponding audio files for each transcript can be downloaded from the [Audio BNC projectâ€™s list of urls](http://bnc.phon.ox.ac.uk/filelist-wav.txt).\r\n\r\nTo edit transcripts in [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/), place both the\r\ntranscript .cha file and the audio .wav file in the same directory. Check the\r\n[CLAN manual](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/CLAN.pdf) for details of how\r\nto use the CLAN editor.\r\n\r\n### Contributing transcripts\r\n\r\nTranscriptions are made using [Jeffersonian CA transcription\r\nconventions](http://homepages.lboro.ac.uk/~ssca1/notation.htm), and the CHAT-CA\r\nfile format and transcription symbols provided by the\r\n[CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/) transcription system.\r\n\r\nA [guideline for transcribers is currently being\r\ndevised](https://github.com/saulalbert/CABNC/wiki/CHAT-CA-lite) to help with\r\nstandardisation - the guidelines adhere as closely as possible to current\r\nstandards in CA without sacrificing machine readability.\r\n\r\nTo use or contribute to these transcripts:\r\n\r\n1. download and install [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/),\r\n2. download the [corresponding audio file](http://bnc.phon.ox.ac.uk/filelist-wav.txt) from the [Audio BNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access),\r\n3. improve existing transcripts with CLAN, then submit them to the CABNC project for inclusion.\r\n\r\n## Underlying BNC Data and Usage Rights\r\n\r\n### Accessing original BNC data\r\n\r\nThe data on which this project builds is available here:\r\n\r\n* The original [Audio BNC transcripts are available in HTML format](http://bnc.phon.ox.ac.uk/transcripts-html/) via the AudioBNC \r\n* Audio data and Praat TextGrid are available on the Oxford Phonetics Institute [AudioBNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access).\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform complex searches on BNC data:\r\n\r\n* Lancaster University's [BNCweb tool](http://bncweb.lancs.ac.uk/): provides a useful web interface for searching the BNC and checking the audio location of sections of transcript.\r\n\r\n### Subcorpus Data Selection Rationale\r\n\r\n[The Audio BNC](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) contains about 7.5 million words of recorded speech, all of\r\nit already roughly transcribed, with audio recordings of sufficient quality for\r\nautomated phonetic transcriptions, and full Praat TextGrid files aligning audio\r\nto transcriptions are available for the entire corpus. There are also\r\ncomprehensive wordclass and part-of-speech tag annotations. Within the overall\r\nBNC corpus, this project focuses on a subcorpus of more naturalistic,\r\nconversations from informal contexts. These include 152 rough transcripts of\r\naudio files, labelled by the original BNC transcribers with the following tags:\r\n\r\n* Overall category: Demographically sampled (subjects carrying audio recorders around)\r\n* Interaction type: Dialogue (rather than speeches/monologues)\r\n* Genre type: conv. (conversation).\r\n\r\nThese are conversations around water-coolers, in corridors, bus-stops, homes\r\netc. and as such are most useful for analysing natural talk-in-interaction.\r\nThere are 4,228,314 words in this subcorpus. \r\n\r\n## Rights and Usage Information\r\n\r\n* All files are publicly available under a Creative Commons Attribution License ([details here](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))\r\n* Please cite use of these transcriptions as: Saul Albert, Laura E. de Ruiter, and  J.P. de Ruiter (2015) CABNC: the Jeffersonian transcription of the Spoken British National Corpus.
