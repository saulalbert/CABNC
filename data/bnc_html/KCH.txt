Phillip (PS1BT)     [213] the toast.
Jane (PS1BS)        [214] thr throw it out.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [215] No.
Jane (PS1BS)        [216] That toaster's a bit unpredictable at the moment.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [217] Well, it's supposed to adapt to all widths and it's
                    rubbish
Jane (PS1BS)        [218] Well it, yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [219] it doesn't.
Jane (PS1BS)        [220] Well we've had it over a year, it's probably had its
                    natural life.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [221] It's [...] .
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [222] Mm.
                    [223] I told you I went and looked that up ... not long
                    ago, things at that price they only guarantee them for six
                    months.
Jane (PS1BS)        [224] Yeah.
                    [225] Well we got through several toasters in a year.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [226] Yeah but they all went just over a year and we
                    thought
Jane (PS1BS)        [227] Just over a year.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [228] we thought oh they've just got out the guarantee.
Jane (PS1BS)        [229] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [230] It's not right ... they were out of it six months
                    before then.
Jane (PS1BS)        [231] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [232] Dave.
                    [233] Don't sing while you're eating.
Jane (PS1BS)        [234] They're very [...] now aren't they?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [235] Yeah.
Christopher (PS1BU) [236] I wonder what they're for?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [237] I know what they're for Chris, but I don't know what
                    he's doing with them.
Christopher (PS1BU) [238] What are they for then?

David (PS1BV)       [245] Dad.
Christopher (PS1BU) [246] I thought they were polling stations.
Jane (PS1BS)        [247] [laughing] Oh!
                    [248] Chris [] .
                    [249] No your school's going to be a polling station next
                    week.
David (PS1BV)       [250] Not all of it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [251] No.
                    [252] Is it just the hall they're using?
Christopher (PS1BU) [253] Mm.
David (PS1BV)       [254] Yes.
                    [255] Yes.

Phillip (PS1BT)     [257] Will you do that for me please?
Jane (PS1BS)        [258] Yes I will.
                    [259] Can I get in there?
                    [260] Oh dear!
                    [261] I better get another knife.
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [262] Were you hungry?
David (PS1BV)       [263] Mm.
Christopher (PS1BU) [264] You go into a polling booth do you?
Jane (PS1BS)        [265] Er, polling, yes you do, they're divided into little
                    booths and you have a little
David (PS1BV)       [266] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [267] table and there's ... there's a pencil attached by a
                    string ... to the desk.
David (PS1BV)       [268] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [269] Mm?
David (PS1BV)       [270] Do you remember when I told you about

                    [276] Yes, that was for the council election.
                    [277] There's local council elections, this is a general
                    election.
Christopher (PS1BU) [278] A general election.
Jane (PS1BS)        [279] So there'll be probably a few more people voting at
                    er
Phillip (PS1BT)     [280] Mm mm.
                    [281] There'll be three instead of two.

Phillip (PS1BT)     [288] Do you want me to leave yours a bit longer?
Jane (PS1BS)        [289] No, okay.
Christopher (PS1BU) [290] Can you strain mine please.
Jane (PS1BS)        [291] No it's alright.
                    [292] I wanna get started.
                    [293] Let me just cut that for you.
                    [294] There you go.

Jane (PS1BS)        [296] Okay.

Phillip (PS1BT)     [302] Well your [...] looks good.
                    [303] I think all the
Christopher (PS1BU) [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [304] dregs have gone.
David (PS1BV)       [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [305] Can I

Phillip (PS1BT)     [309] Chrissy, do you want lots of toast?
Jane (PS1BS)        [310] Have you finished with the Marmite David?
Christopher (PS1BU) [311] Yes please.
Jane (PS1BS)        [312] Do you want Marmite?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [313] Which flavour?
Jane (PS1BS)        [314] Da David
Phillip (PS1BT)     [315] This one?
Jane (PS1BS)        [316] do you want Marmite on your toast?
Christopher (PS1BU) [317] Erm, [...]
David (PS1BV)       [singing] [...] []
Phillip (PS1BT)     [318] Can I sit down then?
Jane (PS1BS)        [319] Oh I think you can.

                    [322] Mouth closed.

David (PS1BV)       [324] I've got a cold.
Christopher (PS1BU) [325] Are we going to decorate the kitchen today?
Jane (PS1BS)        [326] Oh yes, that was what ... oh, but wi with the weather
                    being nice we ought to be out.
                    [327] It was a question of, if it wasn't very nice we would
                    finish
Christopher (PS1BU) [328] Ah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [329] I haven't really [...] to get down it was just I, I
                    took ... [...] .
Christopher (PS1BU) [330] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [331] Oh!
                    [332] And the contents of that board of course.
                    [333] I don't want young [...] messing up.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [334] Well I'd better check what we have to do it with.
Christopher (PS1BU) [335] Mine is like that [...]
Jane (PS1BS)        [336] But do
Christopher (PS1BU) [337] like that.
Jane (PS1BS)        [338] Well no, I meant your, the one you made.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [339] I think I've got all the paint but erm
Jane (PS1BS)        [340] Oh I thought you knew whether you'd got it.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [341] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [342] But if, if it's a nice
Christopher (PS1BU) [343] That looks nice.
Jane (PS1BS)        [344] day I think we ought to be out in the garden.
                    [345] And we'll save the decorating for when it's raining
                    again.
David (PS1BV)       [...]
Jane (PS1BS)        [346] Cos it's not as if we have to keep it for the
                    weekend, I can do it during the week.
Christopher (PS1BU) [347] No that's better.
Jane (PS1BS)        [348] Is that how you like your toast?
Christopher (PS1BU) [349] Yes thanks.
Jane (PS1BS)        [350] [...] underdone.
Christopher (PS1BU) [351] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [352] But hot?
                    [353] ... The two boys are up the dentist on Thursday.
David (PS1BV)       [354] Oh no!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [355] Heaven help the dentist!
Jane (PS1BS)        [356] See Alison.
Christopher (PS1BU) [357] Who's see Alison?
Jane (PS1BS)        [358] No, we're going to see Alison.
                    [359] That's the dentist.
Christopher (PS1BU) [360] Ha?
David (PS1BV)       [361] When I went in there the other week, you walk in and
                    think ... isn't she nice.
Jane (PS1BS)        [362] Then she starts messing around with your mouth.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [363] And then, then she
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [364] yeah, [...] she [...] you and she said, oh, you
                    alright?
                    [365] And you think oh she's marvellous!
                    [366] Then she says, I'll just clean this bit of tartar
                    off.
                    [367] After that you think, you ... [clears throat] ...
                    right.
                    [368] I think that's worse than having a filling.
David (PS1BV)       [369] But dad
Phillip (PS1BT)     [370] What?
Jane (PS1BS)        [...]
David (PS1BV)       [371] it's called decay.
Jane (PS1BS)        [372] No, [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [373] No, love, no it's not.
David (PS1BV)       [374] They get this drill do they?
Christopher (PS1BU) [375] They put them
Phillip (PS1BT)     [376] No she, it's
Jane (PS1BS)        [377] She has a scraper with a pointed er
Phillip (PS1BT)     [378] Scraper on the back of your teeth.
Christopher (PS1BU) [379] Does it hurt?
Jane (PS1BS)        [380] It doesn't hurt, it's uncomfortable.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [381] I've got very sensitive gums ... cos I've ... brushed
                    them badly
Jane (PS1BS)        [382] I
Phillip (PS1BT)     [383] for years.
Jane (PS1BS)        [384] I don't think we have to discuss that while we're
                    eating.
                    [385] ... All too prone to neglect [...] so that's why we
                    take good care of your teeth. ... [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [386] Pardon?
Jane (PS1BS)        [387] No it's not, I didn't put it back.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [388] Oh. [...]
Jane (PS1BS)        [389] [laugh] ... Do you really want to carry on using that
                    mug?
                    [390] Can't you start on something else?
Christopher (PS1BU) [391] I like it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [392] You like it.
Christopher (PS1BU) [393] And my crocodile mug ... as well.
Jane (PS1BS)        [394] Yes.
Christopher (PS1BU) [395] Do you want to start using that?
Jane (PS1BS)        [396] And put your turkey mug away for a while.
Christopher (PS1BU) [397] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [398] Good.
                    [399] ... Well David's mug is positively quiet compared to
                    yo
Christopher (PS1BU) [400] I'll finish this drink first though.
Jane (PS1BS)        [401] [laughing] Well yes [] .
                    [402] I think we might even wash it before it goes in the
                    ... David's mug is quiet compared to ... Oh have you bitten
                    your mouth again?
                    [403] I think it's because you try to eat too much at one
                    go.
David (PS1BV)       [404] Well there's this first.
Christopher (PS1BU) [sigh]
Jane (PS1BS)        [405] If you want to wear your jeans Chrissy, they're in
                    the drawer.
                    [406] I just got the wrong pair out.
Christopher (PS1BU) [407] Oh.
Jane (PS1BS)        [408] I'd forgotten there was a new pair in the wardrobe
                    with, still with the labels on I hadn't taken off.
Christopher (PS1BU) [409] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [410] As long as you don't put a belt on they're still long
                    enough.
Christopher (PS1BU) [411] Are they?
                    [412] Can I wear my track suit?
David (PS1BV)       [413] [singing] [...] [] .
Jane (PS1BS)        [414] Yes, that's alright.
Christopher (PS1BU) [415] I'd like to put two [...] .
Jane (PS1BS)        [416] Okay.
Christopher (PS1BU) [417] Gosh!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [418] What's your plan on the violin front today Chris?
Jane (PS1BS)        [419] Yes.
                    [420] We didn't do a particularly good practice on
                    Thursday.
                    [421] Friday night you got let off.
                    [422] So ... there's two good ones to do.
                    [423] We've got to go through one of the exam pieces.
                    [424] She wants to run through them all and then you've got
                    to fill in a piece of paper on which three pieces you'd
                    like to do, and al you know, she wants the cheque and ...
                    full details of what name to go on the certificate and that
                    sort of thing.
                    [425] I read it through as four pounds, and Brenda next to
                    me is saying, fourteen and I had to re-read it, it, course
                    it's fourteen.
                    [426] I thought that was rather a lot.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [427] Not really.
Jane (PS1BS)        [428] Mm.
                    [429] I don't remember it being that much last year, but
                    she's using a different board this year so maybe that's
                    something to do with it.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [430] David, another piece of this.
Jane (PS1BS)        [431] I think he's had enough.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [432] Right.
David (PS1BV)       [433] No, not, not [...] , Vitalite please.
Jane (PS1BS)        [434] Oh. [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [435] I know.
                    [436] I know, I've got it all worked out.
Christopher (PS1BU) [437] I'll have the crusts.
Jane (PS1BS)        [438] No, but there isn't a crust.
Christopher (PS1BU) [439] Oh oh!
Jane (PS1BS)        [440] Well if you, he's developed a taste for crusts.
                    [441] Oh!
                    [442] Aha, use th bag we might need to put that behind it
                    if you wouldn't mind please.
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [443] Anybody got any preferences for dinner tonight?
Christopher (PS1BU) [444] I can see a
Phillip (PS1BT)     [445] No [...]
Christopher (PS1BU) [446] Dad, I can see a crust in that Vitalite.
Jane (PS1BS)        [447] Ah but in
Phillip (PS1BT)     [448] That's the next one.
Jane (PS1BS)        [449] that's, that's a new one but we're just using the old
                    one
Phillip (PS1BT)     [450] But there's one last in, in this one cos you've had
                    the crust already.
Christopher (PS1BU) [451] Ra
Phillip (PS1BT)     [452] I know it must be you because it wasn't me.
Jane (PS1BS)        [453] [laugh] ... Did you like that granary bread?
David (PS1BV)       [454] Ooh yes!
Jane (PS1BS)        [455] Daddy's cut you a nice thick slice.
David (PS1BV)       [456] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [457] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [458] Er
Phillip (PS1BT)     [459] Oh!
David (PS1BV)       [460] [...] ... I can't eat it plain.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [461] I'm not, I'm not asking you to eat it Dave, I just
                    wish you didn't pass it across to me like that.
David (PS1BV)       [462] Oh!
                    [463] Sorry!
                    [464] ... We do
Phillip (PS1BT)     [465] Do you want a bit more?
David (PS1BV)       [466] Yes please daddy. [humming]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [467] This finished?
Jane (PS1BS)        [468] I'm sorry.
David (PS1BV)       [469] Dad
Phillip (PS1BT)     [470] Oh you put that there.
Jane (PS1BS)        [471] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [472] Yes?
David (PS1BV)       [473] The only thing wrong with that granary bread ... is
                    that every time you cut it it wriggles, wriggles.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [474] It wriggles.
                    [475] Well it's alive.
David (PS1BV)       [476] [laugh] ... It goes like, woo ooh!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [477] Mum will do that for you.
David (PS1BV)       [478] That's the knives int it?
Jane (PS1BS)        [479] That's better.
David (PS1BV)       [480] This.
Jane (PS1BS)        [481] Marmite again then?
David (PS1BV)       [482] Yes mum.
                    [483] ... Breakfast is nothing like reading a comic.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [484] We never said it was.
Christopher (PS1BU) [laugh]
Jane (PS1BS)        [485] Well, I don't see the connection.
Christopher (PS1BU) [laugh]
David (PS1BV)       [486] Oh oh oh!
                    [487] You know, you read your comic at breakfast.
Jane (PS1BS)        [488] Well, you might.
Christopher (PS1BU) [489] Well dad doesn't read his newspaper at breakfast.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [490] What newspaper?
Jane (PS1BS)        [491] We only have a newspaper once a week.
                    [492] There you go.
                    [493] Thank you very much.
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [494] Dave!
                    [495] Chomping away.
Jane (PS1BS)        [496] Do you want spaghetti tonight?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [497] Suits me.
Jane (PS1BS)        [498] Spaghetti David?
                    [499] Got some of that lovely oatmeal bread?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [500] I didn't know you were talking about bread.
Jane (PS1BS)        [501] Nice big oatmeal buns.
                    [502] ... I think, I think on the grounds that erm ... what
                    we've been, I'm gonna have chicken on Sunday.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [503] Well
Jane (PS1BS)        [504] Is that alright?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [505] Yep.
                    [506] Fine.
                    [507] After two dinners now I've had enough.
Jane (PS1BS)        [508] Well that's what I thought.
                    [509] I was going to do beef but I think er ... I think
                    we'll go back to chicken.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [510] Mhm.
                    [511] I'm not interested.
                    [512] I had that Thursday night.
Jane (PS1BS)        [513] The beef, yes, that's, I thought you did.
                    [514] Erm, we need some more milk.
                    [515] I was just ... a bit too short of time on, on ...
                    Friday to ... That's about all I need.
                    [516] And, some vegetables.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [517] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [518] But we can pick that up any time today can't we?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [519] Mm.
                    [520] Or Sunday.
Christopher (PS1BU) [521] Certainly get looks like it ... the sun's going in.
Jane (PS1BS)        [522] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [523] Yeah, probably if you want me to get that old mower
                    going I ought to go up to Woods and ... see if I can get a
                    new drive belt.
Jane (PS1BS)        [524] Well it would be nice if I could use it.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [525] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [526] But why don't you use the other one?
Jane (PS1BS)        [527] And when, when the weather is nice
Phillip (PS1BT)     [528] Mm?
Jane (PS1BS)        [529] I said I would be very happy to be out there.
David (PS1BV)       [530] We've got two mowers.
                    [531] The red one and a green one.
                    [532] Why don't you use the green one?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [533] Well I like the ride on one because it's easier.
                    [534] The, the ... green one it takes hours to cut ... used
                    to take about three hours for me to cut all the grass with
                    that one.
Jane (PS1BS)        [535] But first, but when we first came here I spent three
                    hours on a Sunday morning, and I only did that area where
                    you play football.
David (PS1BV)       [536] Ah!
Jane (PS1BS)        [537] Mind you, I was just slow. [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [538] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [539] Erm
Phillip (PS1BT)     [540] If you'd started the motor and used it it would have
                    helped.
Jane (PS1BS)        [541] [laugh] ... What about, are we going to put that one
                    in the sale this year, the one that's out in the shed?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [542] Yes I would think so.
Jane (PS1BS)        [543] Yes it would be nice if we were, we got rid of that.
Christopher (PS1BU) [544] Put it in the
Jane (PS1BS)        [545] Then I can
Christopher (PS1BU) [546] traction engine rally auction.
Jane (PS1BS)        [547] That's what, yes I think it was [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [548] But it's the ... it's the transporting of it.
                    [549] I have no trailer.
Jane (PS1BS)        [550] You see if we can get away on holiday earlier this
                    year because the violin exam's in June or in July we'll be
                    back.
                    [551] Cos you remember we came round, we came back the
                    night before the traction engine rally cos I didn't have
                    time to get organized.
David (PS1BV)       [552] What about, you could hire a trailer.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [553] Not with your mouth full!
Jane (PS1BS)        [554] I'm sure we could ... work out something.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [555] I'll have to check I've got all the engine bits,
                    whether I left any at dad's so I can at least stick, bolt
Jane (PS1BS)        [556] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [557] the engine back together.
Jane (PS1BS)        [558] You do agree though we should get rid of it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [559] Yeah.
                    [560] I'm never going to do that one.
                    [561] ... There's your tractor to do, there's my motorbike
                    to do, and so many other
Jane (PS1BS)        [562] I know but that
Phillip (PS1BT)     [563] things that mower's a
Jane (PS1BS)        [564] I don't like
Phillip (PS1BT)     [565] goner.
Jane (PS1BS)        [566] that out there it is because at the back of my shed,
                    I want to do some ... I want to tidy that area up.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [567] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [568] Repot some plants.
David (PS1BV)       [569] Dad.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [570] Yes love.
David (PS1BV)       [571] You've never taken us on a ride on your motorbike
                    this year.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [572] Well I haven't, haven't had it out this year.
                    [573] I'm not going to
Jane (PS1BS)        [574] D'ya know I think, I think, I think it has been out
                    this year.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [575] Yes I, actually I think it
Jane (PS1BS)        [576] It has.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [577] I think we have run it once this year.
                    [578] But er, there's two things Dave.
David (PS1BV)       [579] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [580] Number one is, I don't like using it on wet grass.
                    [581] The other one, is you and Chrissy ... getting too big
                    to take you both on it now.
                    [582] Have to be one at a time now.
                    [583] And you'll have to ride on the back, you can't ride
                    on the tank any more.
David (PS1BV)       [584] Why?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [585] You're too big.
Jane (PS1BS)        [586] You're too big now.
                    [587] You're six now.
David (PS1BV)       [588] [laugh] ... I remember when I used to ride on the
                    tank.
Jane (PS1BS)        [589] You were only a baby, I used to be very frightened.
                    [590] You had nothing to hold on to, you were just squeezed
                    in between daddy's legs.
David (PS1BV)       [591] [laugh] ... But when I ... was a bit older
Jane (PS1BS)        [592] Mm.
David (PS1BV)       [593] and I was still riding on the tank
Jane (PS1BS)        [594] Yes but
David (PS1BV)       [595] I gripped a erm ... I gripped it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [596] Yes.
                    [597] Yes yo well your hands were a bit bigger and you knew
                    where to hold on.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [598] More?
Jane (PS1BS)        [599] Yes please.
                    [600] ... Thank you.
David (PS1BV)       [601] Dad.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [602] Mhm?
David (PS1BV)       [603] We can get the motorbike out in the summer.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [604] Mm.
                    [605] I wasn't meaning that motorbike in any case.
                    [606] ... That one goes.
                    [607] There's another one in there that doesn't.
                    [608] Ah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [609] Oh don't tell me [...] .
                    [610] Which reminds me, when are we going to get rid of all
                    those other car bits in there?
David (PS1BV)       [611] Oh yes!
                    [612] I know, there's a windscreen up er, on the ceiling
Jane (PS1BS)        [613] Mm.
David (PS1BV)       [614] we which came from the car you, you two got married
                    in.
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
David (PS1BV)       [615] And you've still got that ... paste on it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [616] [laughing] I was under the impression we got married
                    in the church [] .
David (PS1BV)       [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [617] No you got it wrong Dave.
David (PS1BV)       [618] Well you nicked it off someone's car though.
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [619] I dismantled ... that car.
Jane (PS1BS)        [cough]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [620] It was one ... your uncle David ... brought up for me
                    so that I could get ... take it to pieces to make the car
                    we'd got ... better.
David (PS1BV)       [621] Ah!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [622] Took the engine out, the gearbox out.
Jane (PS1BS)        [623] You do realize it's nine years later and we've still
                    got the bits, got all the bits in the garage?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [624] Mm mm.
                    [625] Be collector's pieces.
Jane (PS1BS)        [626] Can we get rid of them?
                    [627] ... No I'm, I'm
Phillip (PS1BT)     [628] D'ya want any more?
Jane (PS1BS)        [629] I'm having another piece of toast in a moment.
                    [630] But there's no rush though.
                    [631] I'm tired this morning, but not as tired as I thought
                    I would be considering two nights out.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [632] At least you've had one of them in your own bed.
Jane (PS1BS)        [633] Mm.
                    [634] ... And the smoke ... the smoke on Thursday was
                    awful!
                    [635] ... You'd think the Roadrunners friends wouldn't
                    smoke as much as they did.
                    [636] But then you see Wen ... Wendy brings all the friends
                    from Leckernby Installations, of course, they all smoke.
                    [637] They got crowds of them from there.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [638] Mhm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [639] Actually I was thinking ... it would be nice erm ...
                    I have to make a team up with erm ... Wendy's parents and
                    we would do quite well with the joint knowledge of four of
                    us.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [640] It's your competitive instinct coming out again.
                    [641] You're trying to win.
Jane (PS1BS)        [642] One of the questions erm, there was a ... one of the
                    categories was quiz shows ... so I thought well I, I don't,
                    I won't do very well here cos I just don't watch enough ...
                    and one of the questions was, who was the helper on erm ...
                    My, on Take Your Pick?
                    [643] The old Take Your Pick.
                    [644] Well one of the ones that u that used to Take Your
                    Pick?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [645] Who sha well Michael Mi
Jane (PS1BS)        [646] That was Michael Miles.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [647] Michael Miles used to do it.
                    [648] Who was the helper?
Jane (PS1BS)        [649] On Take Your, on Take Your Pick.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [650] Bob [...] Walker.
Jane (PS1BS)        [651] Well, you see, er we didn't know that.
                    [652] Yo yo if you'd have been there we'd have done well.
                    [653] And then it was who was the helper on Double Your
                    Money?
                    [654] Well we fi
Phillip (PS1BT)     [655] Hughey Green and er
Jane (PS1BS)        [656] finally got to Monica and we thought that was enough,
                    so we just wrote Monica, we thought they'd accept that and
                    they did n't.
                    [657] Th the ... we didn't get the full marks we, we didn't
                    get
Phillip (PS1BT)     [658] I can't remember her name.
Jane (PS1BS)        [659] Monica Rose.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [660] Oh.
Jane (PS1BS)        [661] But you see, if we'd had yous and then, we were doing
                    qui quite well up until
Phillip (PS1BT)     [662] Well I wasn't around.
                    [663] I was at
Jane (PS1BS)        [664] then, then we got the sport and we didn't do so well
                    on that.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [665] Oh well.
                    [666] ... Did you do the filters on this yesterday?
Jane (PS1BS)        [667] Erm ... I rinsed out the bottom of the [...] , yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [668] Alright.
Jane (PS1BS)        [669] Why would they leave those poles?
                    [670] I mean they were there at lunchtime when I came home
                    and there was nobody with them so I assumed they'd knocked
                    off for lunch.
                    [671] And then
Phillip (PS1BT)     [672] I think somebody's trying to upset you.
Jane (PS1BS)        [673] I is that all they're trying to do?
                    [674] Because it's frustrating
Phillip (PS1BT)     [675] Well no, I don't know, but
Jane (PS1BS)        [676] to put them there and then
Phillip (PS1BT)     [677] I wouldn't er
Jane (PS1BS)        [678] leave them there.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [679] they've lined one up at each end of the field so it,
                    it looks like they're saying, well, you know that's a
                    parcel of land.
Jane (PS1BS)        [680] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [681] But, I don't know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [682] I mean I, I reckon it'd be nice if they, they sort of
                    parcel it up and then sell some of it
Phillip (PS1BT)     [683] Go round and ask.
Jane (PS1BS)        [684] No.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [685] Why not?
Jane (PS1BS)        [686] I don I don't know whether I want to ... spend er,
                    you know, so much money on that.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [687] Well would you rather do that or have a conservatory?

                    much money here, I'd rather

Phillip (PS1BT)     [727] You can ring him and ask him what his plans are.

                    yours.

Phillip (PS1BT)     [775] Yeah.
                    [776] That's right.
                    [777] Got things like that on it.

                    ever seen plate two, three or four or?
Jane (PS1BS)        [784] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [785] Oh!
Jane (PS1BS)        [786] I think they go to two and three but they don't go
                    very far.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [787] Michael 's alright.
Jane (PS1BS)        [788] The paperwork must cost quite a lot ... that they
                    keep pushing out.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [789] Why?
                    [790] I mean ... the plates'll cost pennies to make.

Jane (PS1BS)        [792] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [793] and there's no mention of the price.

                    good.

                    [800] So oh here it is.
Jane (PS1BS)        [801] That's the sort of thing Geoffrey might like.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [802] Erm
Jane (PS1BS)        [803] What? [clears throat]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [804] Well that's a thought.
Jane (PS1BS)        [805] What?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [806] Erm ... when we sell that flat we were gonna give
                    Geoffrey and Jean something.
Jane (PS1BS)        [807] Well ... that's a
Phillip (PS1BT)     [808] Yeah I
Jane (PS1BS)        [809] nice for present Geoffrey but not for Jean.
                    [810] Not
Phillip (PS1BT)     [811] Yeah, but you get Jean something as well.
Jane (PS1BS)        [812] No, don't you think that's going a bit over the top?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [813] Well ... it's up to you.
Jane (PS1BS)        [814] I'll buy them [laughing] a bunch of flowers [] !
Phillip (PS1BT)     [815] That's a better one.

                    [817] Takes me back to Scampton.
Jane (PS1BS)        [818] Oh yes, that's nice.
                    [819] I like that better than the other one.
                    [820] Yes that's plate two.
                    [821] Coalforth.
                    [822] Nineteen twenty.
                    [823] Yes that's better.
                    [824] I like that.

                    yesterday, I'm a bit confused about who, who's [...] .
                    [826] Erm ... Steve ... for some reason I thought he was a
                    tall ... man, but he's quite short isn't he?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [827] Yeah.
                    [828] Just when he's
Jane (PS1BS)        [829] Is he
Phillip (PS1BT)     [830] on the football field.
                    [831] He can jump.
                    [832] Steve, the fair haired little
Jane (PS1BS)        [833] is he the one
Phillip (PS1BT)     [834] one.
Jane (PS1BS)        [835] well, who's the one
Phillip (PS1BT)     [...]
Jane (PS1BS)        [836] the dif a while ago drove down [...] Middle Street
                    and crashed into some, that one?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [837] That was Ian , he doesn't work there.
Jane (PS1BS)        [838] Oh!
                    [839] I'm mixing the two people.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [840] Ian 's tall.
                    [841] But he
Jane (PS1BS)        [842] Isn't he?
                    [843] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [844] he doesn't look anything like him.
Jane (PS1BS)        [845] So Steve 's quite respectable?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [846] Yeah.
                    [847] They're all nice lads.
Jane (PS1BS)        [848] Mm.
                    [849] Well he seemed quite nice and I thought, well are you
                    the one that
Phillip (PS1BT)     [850] Ian's alright, he just gets drunk.
Jane (PS1BS)        [851] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [852] But he's recently married that ... lass with the
                    ready-made family so
Jane (PS1BS)        [853] Oh well.
                    [854] No I just thought he was quite pleasant.
                    [855] I mean he was always quite helpful when I
Phillip (PS1BT)     [856] Steve's, Steve is
Jane (PS1BS)        [857] didn't know anything
Phillip (PS1BT)     [858] Steve's very pleasant.
                    [859] He's a nice lad.
Jane (PS1BS)        [860] but I thought, well is he the one
Phillip (PS1BT)     [861] He's intelligent as well.
Jane (PS1BS)        [862] He, he er yes, he ... I mean they were all quite
                    helpful.
                    [863] Pete was, was quite helpful too.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [864] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [865] I thought [...] to Janet [laughing] when I last see
                    him [] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [866] It's alright.
                    [867] ... Janet should come to work shouldn't she?
Jane (PS1BS)        [868] Do you think she'll ... turn up on Monday?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [869] Oh I would think so.
                    [870] She's got the most ... abysmal sickness record!
                    [871] She'll [...] rigid cos her pay stopped at one stage
                    and ... it was wrong because she hadn't been warned
Jane (PS1BS)        [872] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [873] but erm ... she did a ... threw a wobbler about it
                    and
Jane (PS1BS)        [874] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [875] then when we checked into it
Jane (PS1BS)        [876] It was right.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [877] and you got her sickness record it ... it was, well
                    it's
Jane (PS1BS)        [878] What's the matter with her?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [879] they nearly paid her ... erm early forties and a
                    spinster.
Jane (PS1BS)        [880] Oh Phillip!
                    [881] That's
Phillip (PS1BT)     [882] D'ya know what I mean?
Jane (PS1BS)        [883] very sexist.
                    [884] I don't like that.
                    [885] Is she in her early forties?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [886] Yes.
                    [887] Forty one I think.
Jane (PS1BS)        [888] You mean she's my age?
                    [889] I thought she was older than me.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [890] There you are, you see.
Jane (PS1BS)        [891] No I think [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [892] She's, she's, she's typical of the
Jane (PS1BS)        [893] Now now!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [894] of the eight cats
Jane (PS1BS)        [895] Oh I know she is.
                    [896] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [897] living on your own syndrome.
                    [898] So I think it's the cats she catches anything from.
                    [899] She worries and frets all the time.
                    [900] It's cos she's nobody to talk to.
Jane (PS1BS)        [901] Mm.
                    [902] That's what ... Julie and I were saying that ... when
                    you live on your own you get a bit like that.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [903] Oh!
                    [904] She, she gets all wound up at home and then comes to
                    work and ... where there's people to sound off about,
                    everything under the [...] er the sun.
Jane (PS1BS)        [905] We were saying about John, we was talking about John
                    as well.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [906] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [907] And the fact he can't just accept things, he has to
                    question things.
                    [908] And we were talking about M E, and how
Phillip (PS1BT)     [909] Oh he's a very intense person.
Jane (PS1BS)        [910] how Dave, I was saying about Dave and how he's sort
                    of taken, taken a completely different attitude to things.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [911] More relaxed.
                    [912] But
Jane (PS1BS)        [913] If he, if he couldn't do anything then he would
                    accept it and not do it and then try a bit and if he had to
                    ... go back to bed.
                    [914] I mean he gave up work for a long time didn't he?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [915] Yeah.
                    [916] But it's such a ... sort of thing
Jane (PS1BS)        [917] And the contrast in personalities though, they're
                    just [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [918] Well there's a contrast in personality and you don't
                    really know whether anybody's got the same thing because
                    nobody's narrowed it down
Jane (PS1BS)        [919] No, oh no, I mean
Phillip (PS1BT)     [920] down.
Jane (PS1BS)        [921] Yeah you can't.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [922] All they know is that they're
Jane (PS1BS)        [923] But Julie was saying
Phillip (PS1BT)     [924] different.
Jane (PS1BS)        [925] about that sleeping treatment that he took,tha that
                    finished him off because he, he, he
Phillip (PS1BT)     [926] Yes but
Jane (PS1BS)        [927] staked so much on that and we were, we were agreeing
Phillip (PS1BT)     [928] Oh yes I know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [929] that the reason he didn't sleep was because the fact
                    that he was just sitting around all day.
                    [930] So you wouldn't sleep
Phillip (PS1BT)     [931] But they didn't
Jane (PS1BS)        [932] then your body doesn't need it.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [933] they didn't do it properly though.
Jane (PS1BS)        [934] Oh!
                    [935] That was the other thing she said, that he, he should
                    have be gone into hospital.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [936] Course he should.
                    [937] He tried to do it at home and that was
Jane (PS1BS)        [938] They co
Phillip (PS1BT)     [939] ridiculous!
Jane (PS1BS)        [940] did he have the opportunity to go into hospital to
                    have it done?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [941] Erm, well the
Jane (PS1BS)        [942] [clears throat] I would have thought
Phillip (PS1BT)     [943] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [944] so because erm
Phillip (PS1BT)     [945] I mean Paul said, with the blokes down in London and
                    he, he ga gave them the pills and sa told them that they go
                    back home and so he did.
Jane (PS1BS)        [946] Yes but the, Julie said, and she's right of course,
                    you can't have the erm ... strength of drugs to, to, to
                    administer at home because obviously
Phillip (PS1BT)     [947] It wasn't, it wasn't
Jane (PS1BS)        [948] you've got to be monitored on that sort of thing.
                    [949] You can't be put into
Phillip (PS1BT)     [950] it wasn't done right.
Jane (PS1BS)        [951] a deep drugs and ni not have erm ... some medical
                    staff ... monitoring you.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [952] Yeah it sounds like you did a lot of work yesterday.
Jane (PS1BS)        [953] I told you we tal I talked, I, I disturbed her all
                    day long.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [954] Oh look!
Jane (PS1BS)        [955] What?
                    [956] Why is that?
                    [957] What is it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [958] Oh!
Jane (PS1BS)        [959] I was going to say it was just something stuck on ...
                    the
Phillip (PS1BT)     [960] It's te I'll pick it up,i if it [...] it was rust on
                    the [...] .
Jane (PS1BS)        [961] No, no.
                    [962] It, it, it
Phillip (PS1BT)     [963] No, now that I've seen it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [964] while I was sitting from here I could erm ... see it
                    had something stuck on it.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [965] The sheep seemed to have thinned out.
Jane (PS1BS)        [966] Mm mm.
                    [967] I think they must be up that other end cos th there's
                    about a couple of dozen yesterday I noticed.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [968] Only two down here.
                    [969] They're not eating our hedge.
Jane (PS1BS)        [970] No, see that one that's going up near where I planted
                    granddad's honeysuckle?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [971] Mhm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [972] They erm, [laughing] they er [] ... there was a lamb
                    nibbling that yesterday and he's taken off, [laughing] so
                    the bits at the top and the bottom [] have no connection
                    any longer so
Phillip (PS1BT)     [973] Oh!
Jane (PS1BS)        [974] It's not, I don't think that's granddad's
                    honeysuckle.
                    [975] I must go out and check it.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [976] I don't know where granddad's is.
Jane (PS1BS)        [977] No, it's ju it's just down there.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [978] But that was a wispy one, granddad's was ever so big.
Jane (PS1BS)        [979] No, granddad's ... never really took off
Phillip (PS1BT)     [980] With big leaves.
Jane (PS1BS)        [981] because of the ... of the drought.
                    [982] When we were away it didn't get watered on.
                    [983] I used to water it every day.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [984] Well everything looks as though it's had a good water
                    now.
Jane (PS1BS)        [985] All four lilac trees have taken anyway.
                    [986] I want to check that the
Phillip (PS1BT)     [987] Did I tell me when we got up to erm ... Newcastle we
                    turned on the local news, they'd had five inches of rain
                    ... which is a winter's rain in four days.
Jane (PS1BS)        [988] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [989] The Metro station just down from ... Gosforth Park er
                    was flooded to platform level.
Jane (PS1BS)        [990] [laughing] Oh [] .
                    [991] Like d'ya, do you remember Sheffield
Phillip (PS1BT)     [992] And all the overheads were
Jane (PS1BS)        [993] flooded last year?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [994] Yeah.
                    [995] And, and everywhere you went the fields ...
                    waterlogged
Jane (PS1BS)        [996] Actually standing in water.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [997] Standing in water all the way up.
                    [998] Snow on the hills and everything.
Jane (PS1BS)        [999] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1000] But fortunately, you know, we, we only got ... tail
                    end of it, a bit of sleet.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1001] Whereabouts did you go yesterday?
                    [1002] You know you said ... there was a bus coming at half
                    past eight.
                    [1003] Where did
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1004] Erm
Jane (PS1BS)        [1005] you go?
                    [1006] I couldn't
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1007] to
Jane (PS1BS)        [1008] I couldn't quite imagine what you were doing.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1009] went round the erm ... British Gas research
                    establishment.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1010] Oh!
                    [1011] Was it mu was it very interesting?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1012] Amazing!
                    [1013] Amazing!
                    [1014] And ... very impressed.
                    [1015] The ... it's a massive place and, you know, five or
                    six hundred staff, and erm, it's where they ... develop all
                    the new technology for the ... gas fields ... delivery of
                    gas to your house and everything.
                    [1016] But you see they're spending a lot of the time ...
                    you know, on ... developing ways of repairing roads after
                    they've been in them.
                    [1017] And what's impressive is they're doing research that
                    we should have been doing for years!
                    [1018] I mean, it's a bit much when the gas board is there
                    showing us
Jane (PS1BS)        [1019] How to research [clears throat]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1020] how, it's developed materials, it's developed
                    techniques and everything for mending roads.
                    [1021] So ... it's er ... a bit humbling.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1022] So did you learn something?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1023] Yeah.
                    [1024] Quite a lot.
                    [1025] You see when the erm ... legislation changes
                    shortly, well the legislation is there but ... when it's
                    enacted ... erm ... they ... they will become responsible
                    for repairing after their own hole digging ... and they
                    have to provide us with guarantees.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1026] Certain standard and time to do it in.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1027] Yes, but I've, they've got to guarantee the repair
                    for at least two years after they've done it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1028] Ah I see.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1029] So, British Gas, the commercial, have worked out
                    that there's only one way to do that, you do the job
                    properly to start with.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1030] Mm.
                    [1031] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1032] And so, they're putting all the effort into doing
                    it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1033] Mm.
                    [1034] Well they
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1035] And er
Jane (PS1BS)        [1036] don't wanna, amount of time of coming back again to
                    do it haven't
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1037] It's
Jane (PS1BS)        [1038] they?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1039] well that's lost money isn't it?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1040] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1041] So ... no it was very impressive.
                    [1042] I'll ... I think it's a bit much when you have
                    highway engineers there and ... really ... they were
                    showing us how it should be done.
                    [1043] And er
Jane (PS1BS)        [1044] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1045] they proved, you know, some things, certain rollers
                    and stuff that ... we thought were useless, you know
                    Paddy's dancing partner?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1046] [laughing] Oh yeah [] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1047] Erm ... well we thought that was out of fashion.
                    [1048] They've shown that ... if you run it at the right
                    speed and stuff it's one of the most effective ... methods
                    of doing it ... and erm ... the ones we say are the nice
                    little plate compactors which are ... the best thing, they
                    are useless in comparative performance so
Jane (PS1BS)        [1049] Mhm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1050] er ... no it was, good.
                    [1051] The money they spend on research!
                    [1052] I forget what it was, the turnover was erm ...
                    something like eight billion.
                    [1053] Or was it ... no i er it, probably eight hundred
                    billion.
                    [1054] It was in some figure you can't even relate to.
                    [1055] So
Jane (PS1BS)        [1056] Well they must have a lot of money.
                    [1057] Isn't it British Gas' Chairman that's just had that
                    enormous pay rise?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1058] Well I think most of them have.
                    [1059] Oh yes, but the Gas one has.
                    [1060] But I mean th the ... the standard of entertainment,
                    I mean ... put, putting
Jane (PS1BS)        [clears throat]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1061] us all in that hotel for
Jane (PS1BS)        [1062] [cough] ... Somebody was saying ... rang in
                    complained to Peter about the, the amount of, what, what
                    are they getting?
                    [1063] It's not, it's not quarter of a million is it?
                    [1064] It's about two hundred thousand.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1065] Prob probably something like that.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1066] And Peter said well what would you consider ... a
                    reasonable salary for him?
                    [1067] And I thought he would say something like, you know
                    something really silly, about fifty, sixty thousand, but he
                    said ... I think a hundred and fifty thousand's enough.
                    [1068] And, I thought well, it is really isn't it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1069] Probably is.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1070] And for, for somebody who was ringing in, an
                    ordinary person just complaining
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1071] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1072] I, I do think they have rather gone over the top.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1073] Well, there you are.
                    [1074] If you want to attract the right people and keep
                    them you have to pay them money.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1075] Yeah but, don't, I'm sure there must be a lot of
                    right people who will work for a hundred and fifty
                    thousand.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1076] Probably not.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1077] Well
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1078] The other thing that was interesting I learnt at
                    dinner on ... Thursday night is, under the ... government's
                    legislation within so many years, nineteen ninety four I
                    think, they've got to ha have reduced their market share
                    from the original hundred percent ... to sixty percent ...
                    as new firms come in to ... sell gas
Jane (PS1BS)        [1079] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1080] Now, as the bloke said there, the only way you can
                    do that with people coming in from the outside is that
                    British Gas ... have got to keep pushing their prices up to
                    make it worthwhile for somebody else to come in.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1081] For the competition to get in.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1082] You can't just suddenly say well we're not gonna
                    supply this quarter or something unless there's somebody
                    coming in
Jane (PS1BS)        [1083] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1084] to do it.
                    [1085] To make it commercially attractive to somebody else
                    British Gas have to got keep lifting their prices to a
                    level, that eventually somebody comes in and says oh yes
                    ...
Jane (PS1BS)        [1086] It's worth my while [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1087] it's worth me having a go.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1088] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1089] I asked them if once they'd got rid of the forty
                    percent they could then get it back ... by dropping the
                    prices, you know, they've, they've
Jane (PS1BS)        [1090] By, by competing.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1091] satisfied them legally?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1092] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1093] They weren't sure about that.
                    [1094] But, they, they thought they'd probably struggle.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1095] I thought, just assumed they would have known.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1096] Well,ye I'm not dealing with the marketing people
                    was I?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1097] No.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1098] I was, dealing with the engineering people.
                    [1099] Right.
                    [1100] If you're clearing up I'll go upstairs ... and er
Jane (PS1BS)        [1101] Yeah.
                    [1102] Yes, I think you're right [...] .
                    [1103] Oh no, there's some more sheep sitting over there.
                    [1104] Under th under that tree that is left.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1105] Mm mm.
                    [1106] Nothing from the insurance company was there?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1107] No.
                    [1108] ... Oh yes, I wonder
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1109] You wonder what?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1110] I wonder what they've decided to
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1111] Well ... it's out of our hands.
                    [1112] It's just very important that
Jane (PS1BS)        [1113] I hope you remembered to pick up those ... [clears
                    throat] ... discs last night.
                    [1114] I can't understand why he, I mean he had nothing to
                    do with it.
                    [1115] And Lorna did her own sheet didn't she?
                    [1116] We, we did our own.
                    [1117] Didn't Lorna fill in her own sheet?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1118] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1119] So.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1120] Well they said it was me and Lorna.

                    we're the ones who did it, who, who did it.
                    [1125] Who did do it.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1126] I'm not worried about it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1127] Well it
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1128] I say it's a compact disc when you haven't got a
                    compact disc player
Jane (PS1BS)        [1129] When you ha haven't got a player

Jane (PS1BS)        [1131] but neither have they, it's a, thing is this
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1132] it's a bit of a luxury.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1133] Well I thought I would use it as a raffle prize at
                    school or something.
                    [1134] Give it straight back into something.

Jane (PS1BS)        [1147] Well I can't hold a conversation on my own.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1148] Why not?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1149] Well, I'm not very good at that sort
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1150] What?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1151] of thing.
*** 2 (Tape 076102) ***
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1152] We're going to do the mower.
                    [1153] Okay?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1154] Yes.
                    [1155] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1156] So I'm gonna fetch it round.
                    [1157] Erm
Christopher (PS1BU) [humming]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1158] yeah, I don't think I can do the big mower.
                    [1159] I couldn't get the right bolts.
Christopher (PS1BU) [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [1160] Oh.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1161] And we went to try and get Chris some trainers.
                    [1162] It wouldn't hurt for some of them throwing away but
                    none the right size of course.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1163] Yes.
                    [1164] Well what size is he?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1165] And, so I popped in and asked Douglas if he'd got
                    any going for next to nothing but he doesn't have anything
                    down his size.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1166] No.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1167] But we really ought to er
Jane (PS1BS)        [1168] Oh he does, he needs some trainers.

Jane (PS1BS)        [1172] I'll go, I'll
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1173] I thought I'd take him into Woollies or the market
                    or something.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1174] Well not the market.
                    [1175] But er
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1176] Well, do you want to go to Phillips and, I mean he
                    kicks them out in two weeks.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1177] Oh I was gonna say haven't Clarkes got some cheap
                    ones in?

David (PS1BV)       [1303] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1304] please.
                    [1305] It's the only way to get rid of that cold.
David (PS1BV)       [1306] My first engine in the Fat Controller's Railway was
                    Thomas.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1307] Yes that's right.
David (PS1BV)       [1308] Then it was Edward, then Henry ... then Gordon, then
                    James, then Percy .
Jane (PS1BS)        [1309] Then Percy.
                    [1310] Yeah.
David (PS1BV)       [1311] Then Toby
Jane (PS1BS)        [1312] Toby the Tram.
                    [1313] And Henrietta ... the coach.
David (PS1BV)       [1314] Then it was Duck.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1315] Did we make a coach for, for Toby,Henrie can you buy
                    Henrietta?
David (PS1BV)       [1316] Yes you can buy them.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1317] Do you want a Henrietta as well?
David (PS1BV)       [1318] Oh yes please mum!
                    [1319] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1320] Yes?
David (PS1BV)       [1321] If I had loads of room in [...] house I'd put them
                    all together.
                    [1322] Put them e behind Gordon.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1323] Yes but, I don't think Gordon, it's only Thomas that
                    really has any caravan, sometimes Percy isn't it?
                    [1324] The, the ... larger engines, the express engines
                    don't.
                    [1325] Maybe James.
David (PS1BV)       [1326] I thought er
Jane (PS1BS)        [1327] Cos it's usually the er ... the tender engines don't
                    ... pull [...] caravan do they?
David (PS1BV)       [1328] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1329] It's only the tankers isn't it?
David (PS1BV)       [1330] But mum!
                    [1331] Look ... you can't get the express coaches.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1332] No.
David (PS1BV)       [1333] But mum
Jane (PS1BS)        [1334] Why, why
David (PS1BV)       [1335] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1336] I just think Tom's looking very battered.
                    [1337] The cabs are very chipped.
                    [1338] It's, I think you have to take a bit more care of
                    those.
                    [1339] Cos you will throw them at the back of the box
                    instead of lining them up.
                    [1340] D'ya remember how I got that box where you could lay
                    them in ... separately?
                    [1341] And of course you're not being very careful.
                    [1342] You're not a very careful with your toys young man
                    are you?
David (PS1BV)       [1343] But mum
Jane (PS1BS)        [1344] Mhm?
David (PS1BV)       [1345] you, you ca you can get a bo you can get a set of,
                    you can get a board for these to get room on ... so you
Jane (PS1BS)        [1346] Mhm.
David (PS1BV)       [1347] Yeah.
                    [1348] A big, a big board.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1349] I don't think we really need that do we now?
David (PS1BV)       [1350] No.
                    [1351] Apparently it isn't a very big one.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1352] Well, well you've got
David (PS1BV)       [1353] All over
Jane (PS1BS)        [1354] the board that you set out the Lego on, you could
                    run those on that.
                    [1355] That's taking up enough room
David (PS1BV)       [1356] It is
Jane (PS1BS)        [1357] we do I don't think we've got any more space.
David (PS1BV)       [1358] The board's damaged from, cos that board's damaged
                    beca ... from Duck, from Duck to Diesel.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1359] D'ya know I'd forgotten it's got dirty beads on.
                    [1360] ... It's a long time since you've had this set out.
David (PS1BV)       [1361] Ooh yes!
Jane (PS1BS)        [1362] Well keep them all together this time.
                    [1363] Or that'll get trod on.
David (PS1BV)       [1364] Ooh!
                    [1365] There's that [...] .
                    [1366] ... Got Thomas.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1367] How come you've got two Thomas?
                    [1368] Oh!
                    [1369] Yo you bought another Thomas with Annie and
                    Clarabel, is that
David (PS1BV)       [1370] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1371] is that the one?
David (PS1BV)       [1372] I bought, we bought the Thomas second ... and then
                    we
Jane (PS1BS)        [1373] Second one.
David (PS1BV)       [1374] got one Thomas with Annie and Clarabel.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1375] Mm.
                    [1376] ... Oh.
David (PS1BV)       [1377] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1378] Yes?
David (PS1BV)       [1379] You know when we did gold paint on James' [...] ?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1380] Yes.
David (PS1BV)       [1381] It's red paint.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1382] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [1383] Whoops.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1384] Looks good in there.
                    [1385] ... They're not in the right pair are they?
                    [1386] Unfortunately, the Fat Controller.
David (PS1BV)       [1387] No they do come [...] .
Jane (PS1BS)        [1388] Mm.
                    [1389] Not actually, I think you can get different sizes
                    can't you?
                    [1390] Just those and erm ... small and that it's difficult
                    to find, those are like the very small ones, they have a
                    picture on there.
                    [1391] Tt.
David (PS1BV)       [1392] But mum
Jane (PS1BS)        [1393] But I don't think the Fat Controller's supposed to
                    be quite as nice is he?
                    [1394] Are you finding they're not particularly [...] ?
David (PS1BV)       [1395] Mine are all staying there.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1396] Oh. [...] .
David (PS1BV)       [1397] [...] ?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1398] Yeah.
David (PS1BV)       [1399] You know these two they, cos they [...] set don't
                    they?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1400] They come together, yes.
                    [1401] But I think you've ... got different sizes there.
David (PS1BV)       [1402] Well, mum
Jane (PS1BS)        [1403] And probably only bigger ones.
David (PS1BV)       [1404] they came as the same ... they came in the same
                    colour mu thing round them we in the red letters saying
                    what they are.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1405] Mm.
                    [1406] The same packaging.
David (PS1BV)       [1407] Yeah.
                    [1408] Same package, package.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1409] Mm mm.
                    [1410] Cos you can get the bigger
David (PS1BV)       [1411] Mm mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1412] got the bigger Thomas haven't you?
                    [1413] Got two of them the one that, that pushes one round.
David (PS1BV)       [1414] Hey mum!
                    [1415] You, you can get a toy the same as the Fat
                    Controller there.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1416] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [1417] A really big one, that big!
                    [1418] They're that big.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1419] Well I don't, I haven't seen one that size.
David (PS1BV)       [1420] That big.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1421] It's probably ... yes.
                    [1422] Maybe a bit smaller.
David (PS1BV)       [1423] No.
                    [1424] Bu ... I think it's Fat Controller bubble bath.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1425] [laughing] Oh!
                    [1426] I see what you mean [] .
David (PS1BV)       [1427] I think
Jane (PS1BS)        [1428] Yeah.
David (PS1BV)       [1429] I think it is.
                    [1430] Well I think it was made of a squidgy thing.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1431] Now, I was only thinking this morning when I was in
                    your bathroom ... you've got lots of bubble bath left over
                    from Christmas.
                    [1432] You've still got some left over from the year
                    before, but people keep giving you it.
David (PS1BV)       [1433] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1434] Chrissy's still got that turtle bubble bath that he
                    doesn't want anybody to use.
                    [1435] And you've got the same one.
                    [1436] And then er ... pots with the squidgy soap in.
David (PS1BV)       [1437] Oh yeah!
Jane (PS1BS)        [1438] And then there's another tall bottle that Wendy got
                    you.
                    [1439] You've still got the lot from last year that David
                    and Wendy got you and you've
David (PS1BV)       [1440] You soap
Jane (PS1BS)        [1441] still got this year's.
                    [1442] I think it's about time you used some of that.
David (PS1BV)       [1443] I, I'm the only person who used the squidgy soap.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1444] Didn't we have to stop using it because Chrissy was
                    coming out in a rash?
David (PS1BV)       [1445] [laughing] No [] .
                    [1446] No.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1447] And we didn't know what it was.
David (PS1BV)       [1448] No because I was,ha because I had the diarrhoea.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1449] Did you?
David (PS1BV)       [1450] Yeah.
                    [1451] That was the reason we that was when we stopped
                    using the turtle stuff.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1452] D'ya know, I don't know.
David (PS1BV)       [1453] Mm mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1454] Well we'll start using it again.
                    [1455] Start using the stuff ta cos there's another big
                    bottle in the cupboard as well in your bathroom.
David (PS1BV)       [1456] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1457] No point in saving it.
                    [1458] You may as well use it.
David (PS1BV)       [1459] Mm mm.
                    [1460] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1461] Yes?
David (PS1BV)       [1462] You know of that music which goes with the engines?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1463] Mm.
David (PS1BV)       [1464] Well as soon as you know, knowing it too well.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1465] [...] .
                    [1466] Oh we must make sure on Tuesday we're home to
                    record, what time is the [...] on?
                    [1467] It starts at five to four doesn't it?
                    [1468] I must get the tape lined up so that it's ready to
                    switch on when we come home cos it's gonna be, walk home
                    from school if it's a nice day, we'll, we'll have to hurry
                    home.
                    [1469] Cos we usually walk slowly don't we?
                    [1470] So we're not getting home till about four o'clock.
                    [1471] But if we, we erm
David (PS1BV)       [1472] Hurry.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1473] Well if it's, if it's ... if the weather's not very
                    good I'll meet you in the car, but if it's a nice day I,
                    I'd much rather walk to meet you.
David (PS1BV)       [1474] But mum we did go in th the car.
                    [1475] You said, it's erm ... at five past five.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1476] No we, we walked and I, I got the time wrong didn't
                    we?
                    [1477] Cos we came in and Chrissy, instead of switching on
                    the children's programmes put his computer on so we didn't
                    see it.
David (PS1BV)       [1478] Well we
Jane (PS1BS)        [1479] But of course it's five to four isn't it?
                    [1480] It's the beginning of the programmes rather than the
                    end.
                    [1481] Never mind.
                    [1482] We've only missed one.
David (PS1BV)       [1483] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1484] I hadn't even got the tape lined up ready to ... the
                    next, the next one on.
                    [1485] So I'll have to get it set up ready for when I meet
                    you from school and then we can switch it on as soon as we
                    get home.
David (PS1BV)       [1486] Well that's what Chrissy did see.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1487] Well we'll remember.
                    [1488] The Tuesday after that we go on holiday, it's the
                    Easter holidays.
David (PS1BV)       [1489] Can you move your foot mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1490] I'm sorry.
David (PS1BV)       [1491] You're ri you're right on the railway.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1492] I'm standing on the railway?
                    [1493] Oh, I better move out the way, I might get squashed.
                    [1494] ... If we got this Monopoly game finished we could
                    get this cleared up couldn't we?
                    [1495] It's been going on a few days this game.
                    [1496] I think Chrissy's got a ... although I'm not sure
                    actually, you might win.
                    [1497] You've got two sets haven't you?
                    [1498] And quite a lot of money.
                    [1499] Have you got houses ... on your set?
                    [1500] Yes you have.
                    [1501] You've got a house on [...] .
                    [1502] ... I started off quite well.
                    [1503] I've got Mayfair ... Piccadilly, Fleet Street and
                    Regent Street, but I never got a set did I?
David (PS1BV)       [1504] Mum, how much, how much do you want for Fleet
                    Street?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1505] Well
David (PS1BV)       [1506] Then I'll have just three sets.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1507] Yes.
                    [1508] If I land on ... something where ... I need some
                    money.
                    [1509] Chris has got quite a lot of, he's got Old Kent Road
                    and Whitechapel Road.
                    [1510] Although, they don't cost much to buy though.
                    [1511] [...] a few houses on them.
                    [1512] You can earn ... some money.
                    [1513] So I might need, if I land on that I'll probably
                    have to sell Fleet Street to be able to survive.
                    [1514] And I think once I do that I shall have lost out
                    because Chris has got Park Lane and he's not going to part
                    with those.
                    [1515] ... [yawning] So I don't think I'm going to do very
                    well [] .
David (PS1BV)       [1516] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1517] Yes?

                    ... James kept on er ... in [...] and in [...] ... that erm
                    ... he stopped at the station and I have to take it ...
                    like that ... far enough ... cos I wanted Gordon to be
                    there ... so he co could pick up the express ... pick, up
                    the coaches
Jane (PS1BS)        [1531] Yeah.
David (PS1BV)       [1532] and it's, I think I can set down.
                    [1533] Right.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1534] Oh I know what we used for the board.
                    [1535] Do you remember that big puzzle ... that ... Barry
                    gave Chris?
David (PS1BV)       [1536] Ah!
Jane (PS1BS)        [1537] That's what we used.
                    [1538] We used to put the fire engines in it as well.
                    [1539] Do you remember it makes into a ... into a big road
                    and it's got a [...] and a school, and factory and
David (PS1BV)       [1540] It hasn't got a factory.

Jane (PS1BS)        [1544] Mm mm.
                    [1545] I was thinking you could put Thomas and the
                    carriages in there.
David (PS1BV)       [1546] And you can try everything on
Jane (PS1BS)        [1547] And it isn't, it's not big enough to get all the
                    engines on.
David (PS1BV)       [1548] Is it big enough to put ... put, put Gordon on?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1549] Well Gordon's a very big engine.
David (PS1BV)       [1550] The biggest of all of the engines on the Fat
                    Controller's Railway.

Jane (PS1BS)        [1646] Oh!

David (PS1BV)       [1648] Mm mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1649] Oh!
                    [1650] I wondered how you knew.
David (PS1BV)       [1651] Inside where the tapes go.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1652] Are you enjoying your Chronicles of Narnia?
David (PS1BV)       [1653] Tt.

David (PS1BV)       [1658] mm mm ... I don't, but, some bits near the end are
                    too scary.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1659] Well ... I think you're a bit young to enjoy it, at
                    the moment but er Christopher is.

                    to ... Gwyneth and thank her.
                    [1661] Which reminds me you still haven't written to
                    Geoffrey and Jean to thank them for your birthday money
                    have we?
David (PS1BV)       [1662] So mum, I know I haven't.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1663] Or have you, which is more to the point.
David (PS1BV)       [1664] The other night [...] cos I didn't like ... you
                    wrote about telling Gwyneth about I don't like the
                    Chronicles of Narnia.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1665] Well, fortunately she understood.
                    [1666] What are you going to put in your letter to Geoffrey
                    and Jean?
                    [1667] And
David (PS1BV)       [1668] I don't know what I got from them.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1669] They gave you a cheque.
David (PS1BV)       [1670] Oh yes, that's right.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1671] I've put it into the bank and I shall give you the
                    money.
                    [1672] Now what are you going to buy?
David (PS1BV)       [1673] Books.

                    given you some money for books as well.
David (PS1BV)       [1675] I'll get some Thomas books.
                    [1676] There is quite a lot I haven't got.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1677] You could actually buy erm ... Trevor.
                    [1678] No, Terence, Terence the Tractor to go with your
                    set.
David (PS1BV)       [1679] Mm.
                    [1680] Well, mum
Jane (PS1BS)        [1681] Cos Geoffrey likes trains doesn't he?
                    [1682] You could write to Geoffrey and say ... say you've
                    bought something to do with trains and should feel very
                    pleased.
David (PS1BV)       [1683] [laugh] ... I don't want to buy, I don't want to buy
                    a bulldozer!
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
David (PS1BV)       [1684] What has that got to do with trains?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1685] Terence the Tractor's part of [...]
David (PS1BV)       [1686] Have I seen that other [...] , talking about Lenny
                    Henry?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1687] I don't know why you think that's what [...] .
David (PS1BV)       [1688] Oh.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1689] Strange child!
David (PS1BV)       [1690] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1691] Yes?
David (PS1BV)       [1692] What I want to do ... wha with the bulldozer I got I
                    would like to poke it that ... shovel one.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1693] One of those interesting conversations with Thomas,
                    like, which are better ... train wheels or tractor wheels.
                    [1694] The caterpillar wheels.
David (PS1BV)       [1695] Oh yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1696] Cos do you remember then Terence can get through the
                    snow where Thomas can't.
David (PS1BV)       [1697] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1698] And Terence comes to Thomas' rescue, cos Thomas
                    doesn't like that snow plough does he?
David (PS1BV)       [1699] No he banged it so he can't
Jane (PS1BS)        [1700] He banged it so that it would bend.
                    [1701] He's very naughty.
David (PS1BV)       [1702] Yes.
                    [1703] Because that's why he was cheeky.
                    [1704] Probably cos he's ... puffed up in the snow box and
                    comes to see to him.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1705] He was going to rescue Mrs .
                    [1706] Was it Mrs ?
David (PS1BV)       [1707] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1708] I think he [...] .
David (PS1BV)       [1709] Sh he did.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1710] She was waving to him.
David (PS1BV)       [1711] It is Mrs .
Jane (PS1BS)        [1712] Is that the name?
                    [1713] Oh we haven't read that for a while cos you read
                    them to yourself now don't you?
                    [1714] So I don't get to read
David (PS1BV)       [1715] Ah

David (PS1BV)       [1717] On that?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1718] Yeah.
David (PS1BV)       [1719] I still like people reading to me though.
                    [1720] ... Six people still read to me.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1721] Quite a lot of people read.
David (PS1BV)       [1722] No oh.
                    [1723] I don't often have people reading to me.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1724] Well you're such a good reader yourself now, you
                    don't need anyone to tell it
David (PS1BV)       [1725] Wow!
Jane (PS1BS)        [1726] to you.
                    [1727] You're quite right it is nice to have people to read
                    to you.

                    haven't been very well and I've been in bed.
David (PS1BV)       [1732] Yes [...] Park.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1733] And mum?

                    [1736] And Chrissy read to me ... what was it?
                    [1737] It was a Roald Dahl book.
                    [1738] [...] . I like George's Magic Medicine books best.
David (PS1BV)       [1739] Mum.

David (PS1BV)       [1741] I ... mum.

                    [1743] Which was it?
                    [1744] Was it Jack, was it James and the Giant Peach?
                    [1745] No it wasn't.
                    [1746] It was something about
David (PS1BV)       [1747] Crocodiles.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1748] No it wasn't.
                    [1749] It was, it was James and the Giant, it was about
                    this boy being ill-treated by these two old ladies that
                    were looking after James.
                    [1750] I suppose ... no I, I didn't enjoy that one but, I
                    could see that Chrissy enjoyed it.
                    [1751] Thought it was wonderful.
David (PS1BV)       [1752] Oh mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1753] Yes.

Jane (PS1BS)        [1767] Oh alright.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [1768] But we'll see, we probably ought to go somewhere
                    else.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1769] Where?
                    [1770] Where?

                    children.

Jane (PS1BS)        [1805] Oh no, sweetie pie.
                    [1806] If it had been the following week with school
                    holidays but I, I do think you'd be very tired the next
                    day.
David (PS1BV)       [1807] I wouldn't mind.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1808] And a pie and pea supper in the interval.
David (PS1BV)       [1809] A what of?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1810] A pie and pea, a charge, two pound fifty.
David (PS1BV)       [1811] Wow wee!
Jane (PS1BS)        [1812] Wow wee!
                    [1813] Bring your family and friends.
                    [1814] I think it means they're all just ... older family,
                    I don't think it means six year olds.
David (PS1BV)       [1815] Mm.
                    [1816] So you think, do they think I'm a baby.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1817] I wonder if daddy wants to go.
                    [1818] I shall have to see if I can get a sitter for you
                    two children.
                    [1819] ... Now what were you asking there?
                    [1820] I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
                    [1821] Darling.
                    [1822] Did you ask me something?
David (PS1BV)       [1823] Er, no.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1824] [yawning] Oh!
                    [1825] I'm tired [] .
                    [1826] I dunno about you lot ... coping with late nights, I
                    certainly can't.
David (PS1BV)       [1827] I haven't had Toby out [...] for a while.
                    [1828] ... It's Toby's turn.
                    [1829] ... It's a good tram isn't it?
                    [1830] ... Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1831] Mhm?
David (PS1BV)       [1832] It's funny, cos Toby's the only steam tram I know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1833] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [1834] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1835] Mm mm?

Jane (PS1BS)        [1839] Mhm.
David (PS1BV)       [1840] Cos there are real engines in there.
                    [1841] But, if they're, the real engines don't have faces.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1842] Yes that's right.
David (PS1BV)       [1843] And they think that was Melissico.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1844] Yes.
                    [1845] Yes rather than er doing the talking.
                    [1846] You're right, Melissico didn't have any.
David (PS1BV)       [1847] But it did.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1848] But, the real engine ... which is
David (PS1BV)       [1849] Yes.
                    [1850] But mum

Jane (PS1BS)        [1853] That's right.
                    [1854] Yeah.
                    [1855] Direct quote from the book.
                    [1856] You did very well.
David (PS1BV)       [1857] No!
                    [1858] No!
                    [1859] From television.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1860] Yes but they take it from the book.
                    [1861] They keep it as close to the book as they can.
David (PS1BV)       [1862] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1863] Well, no point in changing it.
David (PS1BV)       [1864] Oh mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1865] Mm mm?
David (PS1BV)       [1866] Do you know when Gordon goes rushing through the

Jane (PS1BS)        [1867] Mhm.
David (PS1BV)       [1868] Well, well ... well in the book it said ... that,
                    that, that ... that er this Gordon's er ... is, he's er,

Jane (PS1BS)        [1869] [laughing] Yes [] .
David (PS1BV)       [1870] But on the television it says, it doesn't do that.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1871] Er, well you know because you read the books
David (PS1BV)       [1872] It's only there
Jane (PS1BS)        [1873] very carefully.
David (PS1BV)       [1874] [...] [...] for today.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1875] Do you remember when Gordon went rushing through
                    when he'd got his whistles out?
David (PS1BV)       [1876] Yeah.
                    [1877] And the
Jane (PS1BS)        [1878] Aha.

David (PS1BV)       [1881] Yes.
                    [1882] That was the first one where Dot gets cold.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1883] Mm.
                    [1884] I like that book.
                    [1885] I like the earlier stories better than the recent
                    ones.
David (PS1BV)       [1886] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1887] I'm not, not so keen on those.
                    [1888] I like the books, the original books that I had when
                    I was a little rather than the new books.
David (PS1BV)       [1889] Books of Thomas?
Jane (PS1BS)        [1890] Yes.
David (PS1BV)       [1891] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1892] The pictures are nicer in those books.
David (PS1BV)       [1893] But mum ... er

                    this morning.
David (PS1BV)       [1916] Mum, this is only just a yard.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1917] Yes, you've got it looking like the yard.
                    [1918] Where are the engines now?
                    [1919] You could do the turntable in front.
                    [1920] Cos that's how it is in the book isn't it?
                    [1921] When they [...] .
                    [1922] Or facing that to go on the turntable.
David (PS1BV)       [1923] Yes.
                    [1924] And mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1925] Mind your head lovey.

David (PS1BV)       [1929] have you noticed
Jane (PS1BS)        [1930] Mm mm?
David (PS1BV)       [1931] that ... you know erm all like tracks which lead
                    into the sheds
Jane (PS1BS)        [1932] [yawning] Oh!
                    [1933] Excuse me.
                    [1934] Yeah [] .
David (PS1BV)       [1935] Well I was gonna say it didn't have erm ... have ...
                    lines, they were on the side.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1936] Well that's right, yes.
David (PS1BV)       [1937] So that they can be turned onto the track like going
                    to the ... goods show.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1938] Yes.
                    [1939] They've got [...] .
David (PS1BV)       [1940] Mhm mm.
                    [1941] Cos Gordon wanted to go to straight through this
                    [...] ... and th the turn table.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1942] Can you think of another way of turning the engine
                    without using the turntable?
David (PS1BV)       [1943] Of course!
Jane (PS1BS)        [1944] Can you?
David (PS1BV)       [1945] I'll use, I'll use Duck.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1946] Just demonstrate it for me.
                    [1947] Mm mm.
                    [1948] Have you ever seen an engine go on a coach like,
                    kerb like that?
David (PS1BV)       [laugh]
Jane (PS1BS)        [1949] What was the shape we were talking about yesterday?
David (PS1BV)       [1950] It's a triangle.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1951] That's right.
                    [1952] It's got a [...] curve on each end.
                    [1953] Yeah?
                    [1954] And what is the matter with that?
                    [1955] That's it.
                    [1956] And then it goes backwards.
                    [1957] No actually it doesn't have a curve, it is a
                    triangle but it's got a longer base hasn't it?
                    [1958] It would extend so that it could just jump back.
David (PS1BV)       [1959] Right.
                    [1960] To there.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1961] Mm.
David (PS1BV)       [1962] Up to the top.
Jane (PS1BS)        [1963] Then you can get an engine tuned without using the
                    turntable ... these [...] .
David (PS1BV)       [1964] Like
Jane (PS1BS)        [1965] Cos James is pointing, it goes backwards.
                    [1966] You've got engines facing in opposite directions.
David (PS1BV)       [1967] Oh.
                    [1968] Ha!
Jane (PS1BS)        [yawn]
David (PS1BV)       [1969] I'll walk.
                    [1970] ... Take one of these off mum. [door slam]
Jane (PS1BS)        [1971] Oh!
                    [1972] That's daddy and Christopher back again.
                    [1973] That didn't take them long did it?
                    [1974] I hope they've got the bits now.
                    [1975] I really ought to go and help them seeing as we're
                    [...] .

David (PS1BV)       [1982] No!
                    [1983] I don't want to chop them up [...] .
                    [1984] Yes.
                    [1985] There's one man ... I was go was always good at
                    playing with those [laughing] lost my [...] []

                    [1989] Yes, that's all we ever do.
David (PS1BV)       [1990] But then when you got a ta ... th the new one is
                    that when you've got the tape recorder on you go wo ho ho
                    ho ho ho!
Jane (PS1BS)        [1991] [laugh] ... Though sometimes, when they've been
                    smashed into [...] and then I have to turn the other way,
                    they go oh!
                    [1992] Horror struck aren't they half the time.
                    [1993] Somebody as asked to keep it.
David (PS1BV)       [1994] Well
Jane (PS1BS)        [1995] When James and Tara had it, d'ya remember?
David (PS1BV)       [1996] Oh yes.

David (PS1BV)       [2002] The brake van.
                    [2003] The face was on the other end ... and it was looking
                    really surprised.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2004] Yes.
                    [2005] What sort of face did he have then ... to make it
                    look surprised?
                    [2006] How did they draw a face?

David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2088] cos you didn't have to pay tax cos you're a non-

                    got it taxed.

Jane (PS1BS)        [2092] Well you have to be a non-tax payer, you can't
                    cheat.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2093] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2094] But it's obvious at your age ... that you won't be a
                    tax payer.

Jane (PS1BS)        [2112] Well that's what I'm saying, why don't you use the
                    money that Geoffrey and Jean gave you with al ... buy
                    something and then you can write to them and tell them what

                    time you're writing to them they'll think you're a most

                    [2123] You can go and get it out, you're a big enough boy
                    now to fetch it.
David (PS1BV)       [2124] I've forgotten where it is.

                    haven't played with your Lego much since have you?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2273] No.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2274] Is it because it, I mean ... can you give me a
                    reason?
                    [2275] You were so keen to get all that Lego and you've got
                    tons of Lego and yo you're not playing with it.
                    [2276] Any particular reason?

David (PS1BV)       [2281] Mm mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2282] It's just we got the board and it's taking up all
                    the room in the playroom ... and yet you're not playing
                    with it.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2283] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2284] Why?
                    [2285] Is there some reason?

David (PS1BV)       [2287] Well [...] cos I got very little Lego.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2288] Can we improve it at all?
                    [2289] I mean,wha what, what is it that you don't like
                    about it?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2290] I just don't like it now.
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2291] It's just that you were so keen.

                    town.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2307] But you've got lots of Lego.
                    [2308] Even, I've never seen it all set up at the same
                    time.
                    [2309] The police station, the fire station ... I think
                    there was a harbour as well.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2310] Yeah.
David (PS1BV)       [2311] No.

                    a helicopter, I haven't got an airport.

Jane (PS1BS)        [2332] matter.

                    something.
                    [2334] I mean, you can use the Duplo to build something
                    couldn't you?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2335] Mm.
David (PS1BV)       [2336] Mum, the Duplo's up there.
                    [2337] Chris, I remember when ... [...] me and Chrissy used
                    to play with it ... tha Du mainly Duplo but we had some
                    other ... tt ... like the Lego. [...]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2338] I'm just a bit disappointed that th there really is
                    a lot of money's worth of Lego and you're not playing with
                    it.
David (PS1BV)       [2339] He will. [...] .

Jane (PS1BS)        [2347] Yeah.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2348] in sort of Lego.
                    [2349] This monorail goes around, it stops at the bo the
                    bottom stage and it goes over the top stage.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2350] Mm.
                    [2351] It sounds quite good then.
                    [2352] But er
Christopher (PS1BU) [2353] It costs a hu a hundred pound.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2354] you wanted, you wanted lots of Lego, you've got lots
                    of Lego
David (PS1BV)       [2355] [...] station.

                    now Chris.
David (PS1BV)       [2357] And we can, Chrissy we can make a space monorail.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2358] Unless you want some bits [...] from down there.
David (PS1BV)       [2359] Well ... we need some standing posts.
                    [2360] That's what we need.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2361] If you're not gonna play with the Lego Chrissy, can
                    you pack some into the boxes and I'll put that board away.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2362] Mm mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2363] Then we'll get back into the playroom again.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2364] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2365] Shall we sell it then?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2366] I don't know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2367] Well I, I'm so disappointed.
David (PS1BV)       [2368] What sell all our Legos!
Jane (PS1BS)        [2369] Well
David (PS1BV)       [2370] Don't!
Jane (PS1BS)        [2371] that was what you really wanted.
                    [2372] Do you remember that long letter you wrote at
                    Christmas?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2373] Mm.
David (PS1BV)       [...]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2374] I just haven't worked out
David (PS1BV)       [2375] No, Monopoly's better than Lego.

David (PS1BV)       [laugh]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2382] David wants to go to bed.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2383] I know he does.
Christopher (PS1BU) [humming]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2384] Do you want to go to bed David?
David (PS1BV)       [mimicking snoring]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2385] I think you're as well on, on the sofa with er
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2386] Why what's up?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2387] the rug.
David (PS1BV)       [2388] Go to bed.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2389] Go on then.
David (PS1BV)       [2390] Mhm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2391] Not, not like him to ever want to go to bed truly.
                    [sigh]
Christopher (PS1BU) [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2392] He had a late night
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2393] Do you want your tea over there or do you want it
Jane (PS1BS)        [2394] No I'll bring it, I wanna go over there.
                    [2395] We're going to be late to dinner tonight aren't we I
                    think?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2396] Ah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2397] The time's [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2398] Nothing's boiling.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2399] Well that's true.
Christopher (PS1BU) [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2400] If we ... were you thinking of going to Health
                    Chardonne?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2401] Well ... yes, because er A
Jane (PS1BS)        [2402] Only I thought
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2403] if they deliver it it's ... cheaper than going to
                    Scunny or
Jane (PS1BS)        [2404] Well yes, but we've still got the problem of erm
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2405] But if, if we go in my car to fetch it I can't take
                    the kids.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2406] I know.
                    [2407] I know.
                    [2408] Well, which means I can't come.
                    [2409] I thought it'd be nice if we all went together.
                    [2410] But you mean go during the week some time?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2411] No, I wasn't thinking of any time.
                    [2412] Erm ... you could take two cars if you want to.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2413] No, I think that's a bit of a waste.
                    [2414] I thought you might have time during the week to pop
                    into Hull that was all.
                    [2415] A lunchtime
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2416] No.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2417] or something.
                    [2418] I could come with you.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2419] Well I don't know.
                    [2420] I really don't know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2421] You don't know what a normal week is now do you?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2422] Anyway popping into Hull is a thing of the past
                    isn't it?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2423] I suppose it is.
                    [2424] ... Well how much are their delivery charges?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2425] Well I don't know.
                    [2426] Ten, fifteen quid I should think.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2427] Ee ooh!
                    [2428] Well it's worth asking anyway isn't it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2429] Mm.
                    [2430] ... If they'd left one of these out
Jane (PS1BS)        [2431] Oh.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2432] when we were down in B &amp; Q
Jane (PS1BS)        [2433] Oh while we were there the other day.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2434] wouldn't have had to spend those hours
Jane (PS1BS)        [2435] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2436] finding somebody.
                    [2437] Twenty two to, Hardpool Star garden compost [...] .
                    [2438] That's thirty four ninety nine.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2439] You see.
                    [2440] I mean, all these, these grass cuttings erm from
                    what Chris is doing now could go in.
                    [2441] It's a shame just to waste it isn't it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2442] B &amp; Q growing bags.
                    [2443] The only thing is, you can't find them.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2444] Cos you're filling up the weeder bin and I want ...
                    well ... anyway,we we've got to get sorted out compost for
                    it.
                    [2445] ... There's some baby sweet corn left erm ... oh I
                    might get
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2446] They, they won't be very good.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2447] I'll put them in a chicken casserole tomorrow.
                    [2448] I can use all these peppers up as well.
                    [2449] ... With the sauce.
                    [2450] Oh I need some more tomatoes.
                    [2451] ... I guess Chrissy's coming in for something to
                    eat.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2452] Well I called him but ... I didn't think there was a
                    rush.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2453] No there isn't.
                    [2454] ... Saturdays are going to take some, they always
                    take some getting used to when the football season's first
                    finishing.
                    [2455] I don't know [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2456] The erm
Jane (PS1BS)        [2457] ah I've got loads of mushrooms left, put those in
                    the casserole, that's what I've got left [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2458] The B &amp; Q conservatory, that one you were in the
                    other day
Jane (PS1BS)        [2459] Oh yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2460] which comes in one size, twelve foot four by ten
                    foot two.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2461] Oh!
                    [2462] Want one bigger than that.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2463] Three thousand six hundred and ninety nine.
                    [2464] Not bad.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2465] Oh!
                    [2466] Erm ... talking about conservatories ... for which
                    you need [...] , I've read about the quiz.
                    [2467] Yes, it starts at, it says on the front it starts at
                    seven, and then at the back ... it says the actual quiz
                    starts at seven thirty.
                    [2468] Seven thirty to eight fifteen, then there's an
                    interval which you have pie and peas, which is always good
                    at the town hall ... erm, and then it's nine to nine thirty
                    part two of the quiz.
                    [2469] So really it sounds the sort of thing that'll be
                    nice for you and I to go really just to get away from the
                    children.
                    [2470] Or do you want to go on your own so you don't have
                    to get a sitter?
                    [2471] But I need to be knowing cos if we're going out I'll
                    have to
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2472] That's right.
                    [2473] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2474] let the other ... man, the conservatory man know,
                    it's not fair to ... not be here to [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2475] Mm.
                    [2476] He's gonna be a pain in the neck!
Jane (PS1BS)        [2477] I know love.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2478] I mean ... there's no intention of letting somebody
                    like that have a go.
                    [2479] I was gonna do it myself.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2480] Well if there's no intention I may as well cancel
                    him altogether.
                    [2481] There's no point in wasting his time either.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2482] Well we're not are we?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2483] Well if we're not I'll ring him up and say ... I'll
                    say ... er
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2484] Hey we're going out and be,we we're going to have
                    them build us one, I mean ... er ... my intention is I
                    might get ... Stuart or somebody to put the bricks at the
                    bottom.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2485] Yes.
                    [2486] Sort of a semi do-it-yourself.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2487] But a it'll, I'll assemble it myself.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2488] Yeah.
                    [2489] Okay.
                    [2490] Cos Johnny can come up and give us a hand can't he?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2491] I could do the lot actually if it comes down to it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2492] Are you okay with what I've put out?
                    [2493] That ham and potato and salad.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2494] Yeah!
                    [2495] More than enough thanks.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2496] I'll warm some of these, well I won't warm all of
                    them.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [whistling]
Jane (PS1BS)        [2497] Right.

David (PS1BV)       [2502] I'll do it mum.
                    [2503] Is it, is it old, old?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2504] Yes, it's the same sort of thing, and then it warms
                    them up. [...]
David (PS1BV)       [2505] No thanks.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2506] No?

Phillip (PS1BT)     [2513] Stop the mower.
                    [2514] Oh I haven't shown you how to do that.
                    [2515] Chris!

Phillip (PS1BT)     [2526] Who?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2527] [laughing] He says, he's filled the wheelie bin and
                    it's go he's been in it and jumped on the top, so course
                    ... his track suit is []
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2528] Well it's not ... it's not bad what you've done.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2529] got covered in grass.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2530] Pardon?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2531] I didn't do that much.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [...]
Christopher (PS1BU) [2532] I thought you had to push it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2533] Oh no.
                    [2534] [...] . Erm ... take your gloves and just shake them
                    outside.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2535] What's that?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2536] No I'll, I'll ha have another go later.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2537] I'll warm those up.
                    [2538] I think I'll warm all those up because we might eat
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2539] Bye.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2540] them all.
                    [2541] Ooh it's cold!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2542] Well he's coming in.
                    [2543] David!
                    [2544] Come on!
Jane (PS1BS)        [2545] I shall hoover you to get that grass off.
                    [2546] ... Thank you, cleaning these up.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2547] Hands washed boyo.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2548] I bet it's come again and I was dashing in to, I had
                    about two minutes to [...] Sunday
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2549] Hey!
Jane (PS1BS)        [2550] night.
                    [2551] And I wa as it was I was in the bread queue.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2552] Aargh!
Jane (PS1BS)        [2553] And queue up soon and get in there.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2554] Who complained?
                    [2555] ... Either way, that's too late for the kids.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2556] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2557] But the thing you won't like it, it'll probably be
                    John there.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2558] John?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2559] .
                    [2560] Well he will be.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2561] [laugh] ... Well ... aha
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2562] [...] and Simon and things.
                    [2563] Yes, well, if you go, if just you and I go we're
                    likely to end up with somebody who knows us.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2564] We have to make up a team though don't we?
                    [2565] I mean, we can't do it on our own?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2566] But you, probably wouldn't want to be with John.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2567] Well ... yes but it ... will ... Ruth be going?
                    [2568] And how are we going to make a team?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2569] I would doubt Ruth will be going.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2570] But it sounds as if it's a sort of family evening
                    though doesn't it?
                    [2571] I mean ... shall we take somebody with us?
                    [2572] I mean, would Dave and Wendy want to go?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2573] Mm mm.
                    [2574] I don't know.
                    [2575] I don't really know what it is.
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2576] But I'll read it again.
                    [2577] Hang on.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2578] Read it again.
                    [2579] We ought to be making our minds up.
                    [2580] Cos if that, if you go on your own that's fine, but
                    if I'm going we've got to get a sitter.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2581] Well it says, entrants may take part as individuals
                    or as teams of up to four persons.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2582] Oh well, oh you and I can do a
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2583] So we don't need
Jane (PS1BS)        [2584] you and I can do a team on our own then.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2585] Can I come as well?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2586] I'd like to take you Chris but it is a school night,
                    I think it's going to be,yo it'll be ten o'clock before we
                    got home.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2587] [reading leaflet] The quiz will contain some sixty
                    questions covering general knowledge and not just railways.
                    [2588] So there is nothing for a family to be afraid of []
                    .
Jane (PS1BS)        [2589] If it was er space then we need Chris because
Christopher (PS1BU) [2590] Mm mm mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2591] co we need Chris as our space expert.
David (PS1BV)       [2592] And me!
                    [2593] As my
Jane (PS1BS)        [2594] Oh!

Phillip (PS1BT)     [2596] What are you an expert on?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2597] What are you an expert on?
David (PS1BV)       [2598] Railways.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2599] Well that's true, yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2600] Yes, you're not bad are you?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2601] Yes.
David (PS1BV)       [2602] They don't even know who built the first engine?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2603] Who don't?
David (PS1BV)       [2604] The people at the quiz.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2605] Oh I'm sure
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2606] Oh I should think they will do.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2607] The person who's [...] .
Jane (PS1BS)        [2608] Definitely.

David (PS1BV)       [2620] That's English.
                    [2621] It's English though isn't it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2622] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2623] Who wants a tiny bit
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2624] Yes, Chris.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2625] of cheese?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2626] But actually he built his first engine, I think, for
                    a ... quarry in
David (PS1BV)       [2627] Pennydaryn Pennydaryn.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2628] Wales.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2629] That's right.
                    [2630] And where was that?
                    [2631] Yes.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2632] Wales.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2633] Chrissy's got it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2634] For a six year old you know a lot about engines.
                    [2635] The potato's ready in a moment kids.
David (PS1BV)       [2636] Dad.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2637] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2638] If anyone wants a little bit of cheese I'll do it.
                    [cough]
David (PS1BV)       [2639] I know he, he broke the rails
Jane (PS1BS)        [...]
David (PS1BV)       [2640] he broke in rails because some silly man was talking
                    to him in Wales!
Jane (PS1BS)        [2641] cholesterol level [...] .
                    [2642] Actually I'll do a little bit more than that.
David (PS1BV)       [2643] Well that's Richard 's fault.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2644] No, no it wasn't he put on too many weights sunshine

Jane (PS1BS)        [2645] Oh no you can't have much cheese. [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2646] The engine was just too heavy.
David (PS1BV)       [2647] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2648] What happened?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2649] Er er ... what?
David (PS1BV)       [2650] It it broke, it broke
Jane (PS1BS)        [2651] To, to, to the engine?
David (PS1BV)       [2652] the track, it split the rails.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2653] Did it?
David (PS1BV)       [2654] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2655] Well yes be
Jane (PS1BS)        [2656] I don't know much about this sort of thing.
                    [2657] You don't want
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2658] because the
Jane (PS1BS)        [2659] any cheese do you Phillip?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2660] No thanks.
                    [2661] The plate, the plate ways, the railways they had
                    then ... were built for horses to pull trucks on.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2662] Thank you.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2663] And they di
David (PS1BV)       [2664] They fell off.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2665] they didn't know a lot about steel, they were made
                    out of iron.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2666] Mm.
                    [2667] You can have a [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2668] And when he built his first engine it was made out
                    of erm ... iron and stuff and was extremely heavy.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2669] I haven't done enough peppers.
                    [2670] What am I thinking of there?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2671] Is steel lighter than iron?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2672] Well not necessarily Chris.
                    [2673] Erm
Christopher (PS1BU) [2674] Is it stronger but
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2675] It's, it's stronger weight for weight, you see, or
                    ... well it can be in certain circumstances.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2676] Grab a chair there.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2677] Steel tends to be a bit more elastic.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2678] Oh.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2679] Iron do iron, certainly the stuff they used then,
                    cast iron, was very brittle and
Christopher (PS1BU) [2680] Aha.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2681] so it won't stand shocks.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2682] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2683] So if you put a big heavy engine going down a cast
                    iron railway ... which won't
Christopher (PS1BU) [2684] That might hit the railway, [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2685] which won't be made ... properly
Christopher (PS1BU) [2686] Ah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2687] it'll go ... and crack it.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2688] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2689] But I mean, having said that, there's lots of cast
                    iron bridges around still,lo the one at Stamford Bridge is
                    er
Christopher (PS1BU) [2690] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2691] cast iron and I mean, it's no problem in that ...
                    situation.
David (PS1BV)       [2692] And get a shock.
                    [2693] Ah ah!
                    [2694] The steam engine [laughing] coming through [] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2695] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [2696] And that railway that, little railway wi is made of
                    cast iron.
                    [2697] In the middle.
Jane (PS1BS)        [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2698] I just said that.
                    [2699] ... The one at Stamford?
Jane (PS1BS)        [...] [...]
David (PS1BV)       [2700] Near the old railway bridge.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2701] Which one David?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2702] The walk on one?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2703] Which one?
                    [2704] Over there?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2705] Oh!
                    [2706] This one here.
                    [2707] No, that'll be steel.
                    [2708] That was only cos you came
Jane (PS1BS)        [2709] Ham David?
David (PS1BV)       [2710] Yes please.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2711] in the, in the sixties Chris it wasn't erm so
Jane (PS1BS)        [2712] I didn't make any coleslaw, you like coleslaw don't
                    you?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2713] So it's a comparatively modern bridge.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2714] I'll have some lettuce
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2715] The
Jane (PS1BS)        [2716] though.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2717] there used to be a level crossing there.
David (PS1BV)       [2718] Mm mm.
                    [2719] Oh yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2720] Eastgate used to go right through down to join
David (PS1BV)       [2721] Hey!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2722] erm
Jane (PS1BS)        [2723] That's right.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2724] Anderson Street.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2725] Ooh!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2726] But you see that would have given, one, two, three,
                    four crossings on that, within half a mile in Driffield, so
                    they closed that one and put a footbridge over and erm ...
                    thanks.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2727] I'll take that.
                    [2728] I'll take that one for you.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2729] And three crossings in about five hundred metres.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2730] Well, that's about right, yes.
                    [2731] ... So, you can imagine what it'll be like cos erm
                    ... twenty years ago in the summer, well no, twenty five
                    years ago
David (PS1BV)       [2732] That one.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2733] Saturdays and Sundays there would be trains every
                    ten minutes going to Brid.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2734] Are you going to put butter on that yourself
David (PS1BV)       [2735] A

Christopher (PS1BU) [2756] In the sixties
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2757] when it used to be summer Saturdays and Sundays they
                    were excursions, they weren't ... service trains.
                    [2758] Some weekends like Eas erm, not Easter, bank
                    holidays, August bank holiday and stuff, you'd have as many
                    as they could get in.
Christopher (PS1BU) [2759] You know I don't
Jane (PS1BS)        [2760] I'm sorry, I was just, I was gonna pass that to
                    daddy.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2761] And did you know that when, when they used to go to
                    Bridlington you know, you know where the big signal box is
                    at Bridlington, near B &amp; Q?
Christopher (PS1BU) [2762] Yeah, yes

                    everything, that used to be all sidings ... right under
                    that bridge that's got the weight limit on
Christopher (PS1BU) [2764] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2765] for storing the engines and the coaches ... for the
                    excursions

Phillip (PS1BT)     [2767] and they used to get so many
David (PS1BV)       [2768] And trucks.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2769] And trucks Dave.
                    [2770] Well they didn't have trucks for excursions, they
                    didn't take any sheep and cattle to the seaside for a day.
David (PS1BV)       [laugh]
Christopher (PS1BU) [laugh]

                    Driffield if they were full and keep the empty coaches ...
                    in two sidings.
                    [2775] It used to be down to Meadow Road.
                    [2776] And they used to keep them there until it was time
                    for people to go out and then they'd run them back up to
                    Brid.
                    [2777] So it was that crowded.
David (PS1BV)       [2778] How did you know?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2779] You know, you'd think things had changed a long time
                    ago but erm ... I remember having Chrissy in that yard when
                    he was a baby in his pushchair ... where ... and there was

                    side.

David (PS1BV)       [2869] Everybody in York will be wanting to go.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2870] Maybe we'd better aim for the spring half term to go
                    away.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2871] Well do you want stay at caravan then?
Jane (PS1BS)        [2872] Well, I don't know we went, it depends on the
                    weather I mean, we went last year at
Phillip (PS1BT)     [2873] Well I mean
Jane (PS1BS)        [2874] half term and the weather wasn't very good.

Phillip (PS1BT)     [2882] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [2883] I found in Northumberland, the worst bit was it was
                    just going out in the cold to the shower.
                    [2884] I mean there's much better hot showers it was okay

                    [4075] There have been cows in the field.
                    [4076] I think it was before you were born.
                    [4077] And it wasn't for long, I must admit, that we had
                    cows in that field but ... I think
David (PS1BV)       [4078] Mum we
Jane (PS1BS)        [4079] the sheep are best.
David (PS1BV)       [4080] mum, we had horses in the winter once when I was a
                    baby.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4081] There were horses in the field when we came.
                    [4082] And that was years ago.
David (PS1BV)       [4083] When I was a baby.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4084] That was nine years ago.
                    [4085] No you weren't a baby.
                    [4086] We had horses again ... well maybe when you were a
                    baby.
David (PS1BV)       [4087] Yes er, I was, I, I saw a picture

Jane (PS1BS)        [4093] are you sure it wasn't Chris as a baby?
David (PS1BV)       [4094] I'm su ... it was either me or Chris.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4095] I'd rather there were sheep in the field than pigs.
                    [4096] Didn't like having pigs.
                    [4097] Geese were alright weren't they?
                    [4098] Except it wasn't very nice watching them disappear
                    just before Christmas.
David (PS1BV)       [4099] Well at least they gave ... some to some old
                    concentration
Jane (PS1BS)        [4100] We don't eat ... lamb any more do we?
                    [4101] After things that we've [laughing] seen in that
                    field [] .
David (PS1BV)       [4102] Pardon mum?
Jane (PS1BS)        [4103] We've given up eating lamb ... lamb since there's
                    been sheep in the field haven't we?
                    [4104] We haven't had lamb for years now.
David (PS1BV)       [4105] We haven't.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4106] No.

                    there's sheep in the field, we won't eat lamb.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4124] No.
                    [4125] I don't think, I don't think I want to eat lamb ever
                    again.
David (PS1BV)       [4126] When there's pigs in the field ... we won't eat pork
                    chops.
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]

Phillip (PS1BT)     [4253] Silly things, like crashing, running out of petrol.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4254] Running out of petrol just before.
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Christopher (PS1BU) [4255] Bit of a daft time to wait to, to [...] .
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [4256] What did he say?
                    [4257] Consummately easy win?

                    it?
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4260] That's really constructive.
                    [4261] That ... looking at a bald head, a stupid girl, and
                    something else.
                    [4262] Oh!
Jane (PS1BS)        [4263] But why is she stupid?
Christopher (PS1BU) [4264] I bet they show other people all that.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4265] Getting her head in the way of the camera.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4266] So what happened to Senna?
                    [4267] I know he dropped out, but why?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4268] Don't know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4269] Oh.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4270] Ran out of steam after eighteen laps.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4271] If we're going to do any more quizzes this is the
                    sort of thing we're going to need to know to do well on the
                    sports sections.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4272] Well I don't know.
                    [4273] They don't do interesting sports.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4274] They did the firs
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4275] They do obscure ones like golf.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4276] ah but the, the first ques the first question on the
                    sports section was, what team does Nigel Mansell drive for?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4277] Oh.
                    [4278] Did you get it right?
Jane (PS1BS)        [4279] No, we could only come up with, I forgot, but it was
                    something Renault, and we could only think of Renault.
Christopher (PS1BU) [4280] Williams,Will Williams.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4281] Yeah.

Phillip (PS1BT)     [4293] Your mum loves it.
Christopher (PS1BU) [4294] What?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4295] Standing on the podium and they spray champagne over
                    everybody.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4296] Oh I hate that!
                    [4297] That does annoy me!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4298] Breaks your mum's heart that, to see all that
                    champagne thrown.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4299] No it's not the waste of champagne, I feel sorry for
                    everybody getting so sticky.
Christopher (PS1BU) [4300] Oh [...] .
David (PS1BV)       [4301] Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!

Christopher (PS1BU) [4310] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4311] Oh she's out there again!
Christopher (PS1BU) [4312] Where?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4313] I wonder who was sponsoring the race?
Jane (PS1BS)        [4314] Mm?
                    [4315] ... You can afford to be [...] can't you?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4316] Mm.

                    news.

Jane (PS1BS)        [4330] Oh, you saw the first
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4331] I want to see all the exciting bits I missed.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4332] Well, won't they have highlights on later?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4333] This is the highlights.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4334] You mean, they didn't show the full race?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4335] The full race was run at some obscure time today so
Jane (PS1BS)        [4336] When I listened to the six o'clock news
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4337] I was hoping you wouldn't come
Jane (PS1BS)        [4338] on the radio
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4339] running through and tell me
Jane (PS1BS)        [4340] No, oh ... do I ever?

Phillip (PS1BT)     [4344] well, yes sh yes well, this, well this was only the
                    highlights unless the last two or three, no the last two or
                    three parts have been live.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4345] Yeah, on the six o'clock they said it was half way
                    through and Nigel Mansell was the lead and I thought you
                    were watching it live, so I wouldn't just come through and
Christopher (PS1BU) [4346] Mm mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4347] Right.
                    [4348] Chrissy go outside and shake the grass off you now

                    [4356] [singing] David [] !
Jane (PS1BS)        [4357] We're going to have to have this room tidied up
                    tomorrow.
                    [4358] I hope Morna will sit, but she might not mightn't
                    she?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4359] Well you haven't asked have you?
                    [4360] Aren't you go

Jane (PS1BS)        [4365] Well I forgot.
                    [4366] Well she's probably tired, she's been out two nights
                    in a row.
                    [4367] I'll get her tomorrow when she's feeling a bit
                    fresher.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4368] Then she says no.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4369] Well I daren't ask Susan again.
                    [4370] Daren't.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4371] Oh no, we're not asking Susan.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4372] It's getting expensive getting Susan.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4373] Although the money's not important, it's just that
                    you can't keep asking a girl that age to come out.
                    [4374] Are you ready?
                    [4375] Are we going upstairs?

                    number?
                    [4388] Because when that parcel came from Gwyneth you said
                    that ... I think probably two thousand three hundred mini-
                    bites ... in it.

                    [4398] I'll do that on Tuesday.
David (PS1BV)       [4399] Too late when they've got bubbles.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4400] Yes.
                    [4401] You don't have bubbles when you're gonna to wash
                    your hair.

                    didn't you?
                    [4508] I noticed when I was at school the other day.

Jane (PS1BS)        [4510] You ha
David (PS1BV)       [4511] out.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4512] you had to, why did you have to cross all the words
                    out?
                    [4513] I thought you'd be
David (PS1BV)       [4514] Cos she didn't want the song.

Jane (PS1BS)        [4525] You've spelt it correctly in your book.
                    [4526] It's easier to spell when you can write things down
                    isn't it?
                    [4527] Rather than still, you're only just six.
                    [4528] Your spelling's quite good.
David (PS1BV)       [4529] Mum.

Jane (PS1BS)        [4545] I must admit, with that amount of bubbles in bo ...
                    look at your toes peeping out through the bubbles.

                    [4547] [laugh] ... [laughing] It does look funny [] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4548] I think you better get a move on, it sounds like
                    your brother's coming.
David (PS1BV)       [4549] Doesn't matter.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4550] Alright.
                    [4551] I know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4552] Oh, yes, he does look like Father Christmas.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4553] Ready?
Christopher (PS1BU) [4554] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4555] See if your mum can catch.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4556] Ooh!

Jane (PS1BS)        [4558] Look at that lovely egg.
                    [4559] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4560] She missed it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4561] Can you
David (PS1BV)       [4562] I'd like
Jane (PS1BS)        [4563] can we put [...] on that side because I think that's
                    where to keep it.
                    [4564] I don't want to lose that again.
                    [4565] Do you remember when we got it?
Christopher (PS1BU) [4566] Yes.
                    [4567] Pantomime
David (PS1BV)       [4568] It got, we caught it.

                    [4570] Yes, it was really good.
                    [4571] And these [...] so you can catch eggs.
David (PS1BV)       [4572] We need to waggle it.
Christopher (PS1BU) [4573] That's better than ca catching the eggs is better
                    than catching the Wagon Wheel.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4574] Yes, I think so too.
                    [4575] Because he only ever, he only threw one egg out of
                    the audience and we caught it, whereas at a, every year he
                    throws lots of Wagon Wheels out.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4576] Oh oh.
Christopher (PS1BU) [...] [...]

Phillip (PS1BT)     [4621] Yeah, and I was trying to listen to that lousy
                    interview.

                    [4677] In a way.
                    [4678] Unfortunately.
Christopher (PS1BU) [4679] She can still become Prime Minister though can she?

Phillip (PS1BT)     [4687] but in practise, no.
                    [4688] She's dropped out now Chris.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4689] she's not going to resign as an MP this time, in
                    fact, she's in America now.

Jane (PS1BS)        [4695] Er and Chrissy, and Chrissy said to me, I didn't
                    realize a man could be [laughing] Prime Minister [] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4696] Quite so, I think if Kinnock
Jane (PS1BS)        [...]
Christopher (PS1BU) [4697] But I [...]
Phillip (PS1BT)     [4698] if Kinnock gets in you've got an old woman so you'll
                    be right.

                    [4700] That David, they thought
Christopher (PS1BU) [4701] But I thought it was
Jane (PS1BS)        [4702] that women could o only women could hold the top
                    jobs.
Christopher (PS1BU) [4703] No, I thought ... if it was a man it was a president
                    and it was a woman it was Prime Minister.
Jane (PS1BS)        [4704] Oh yes,yo you're destroying my belief in what you
                    were thinking about.
                    [4705] Cos I thought you thought only women could

                [5056] I number one is, what does it say at the end?
David (PS1BV)   [5057] Nothing there.
                [5058] Full stop.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5059] It says, two, O, seven, nine.
David (PS1BV)   [5060] Oh.
                [5061] Two O seven nine.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5062] Which is?
                [5063] What does that make?
David (PS1BV)   [5064] It's the number of a steam engine I've got.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5065] I'm not bothered whether it's a number of a steam engine
                but ... how do you pronounce that number?
David (PS1BV)   [5066] Two hundred a
Phillip (PS1BT) [5067] No.
                [5068] No.
David (PS1BV)   [5069] two.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5070] If it was that number it would be hundreds.
                [5071] It's bigger than hundreds, so what's that?
David (PS1BV)   [5072] Er thousands.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5073] Right.
                [5074] So how many thousands?
David (PS1BV)   [5075] Two thousand and seventy nine.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5076] Well you got there in the end didn't you?
David (PS1BV)   [5077] Right.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5078] Right.
David (PS1BV)   [5079] Now it's even more difficult.
                [5080] Even more difficult.
                [5081] ... Equals
Phillip (PS1BT) [5082] Yeah, very clever.
                [5083] You can add up in, what are you doing up, in tens?
David (PS1BV)   [5084] Tens.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5085] You can do that.
                [5086] Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, can't you?
David (PS1BV)   [5087] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5088] What comes next?
David (PS1BV)   [5089] Fifty, sixty.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5090] Then?
David (PS1BV)   [5091] seventy, eighty, ninety, twenty
Phillip (PS1BT) [5092] Ah ah!
                [5093] Ninety?
David (PS1BV)   [5094] A hundred.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5095] That's better.
                [5096] And add up in hundreds now.
David (PS1BV)   [5097] A hundred, twenty
Phillip (PS1BT) [5098] No.
                [5099] A
David (PS1BV)   [5100] a hundred billi
Phillip (PS1BT) [5101] No, start off
David (PS1BV)   [5102] Erm
Phillip (PS1BT) [5103] with a hundred and then add another hundred what do you
                get?
David (PS1BV)   [5104] I'm trying to work my way to the end.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5105] Now you're being a pickle!
                [5106] Not, not with the machine.
                [5107] Using your own head.
                [5108] Add, add hundreds up.
                [5109] Come on.
                [5110] What do you start with?
David (PS1BV)   [5111] A hundred, a hundred and one, and
Phillip (PS1BT) [5112] No.
                [5113] No, no, no, no!
                [5114] I was, I wasn't meaning you to go up in single numbers I
                was meaning, go up in hundreds.
                [5115] Start off with a hundred.
David (PS1BV)   [5116] Yes.
                [5117] A hundred.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5118] Then add, add the same again.
David (PS1BV)   [5119] Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred,
                six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred, ten
                hundred.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5120] But what's ten hundred?
David (PS1BV)   [5121] A thousand.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5122] Right.
                [5123] So why didn't you say that?
David (PS1BV)   [5124] You didn't ... yo
Phillip (PS1BT) [5125] I, I did.
                [5126] I was expecting you to count, nobody says ten hundred.
                [5127] Do they?
David (PS1BV)   [5128] No!
                [5129] It always goes onto the next number.
                [5130] Every number ga always goes up to nine.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5131] Then it triggers over into another one doesn't it?
David (PS1BV)   [5132] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5133] Now what were we saying the other day?
                [5134] You have, units ... tens, hundreds, thousands
David (PS1BV)   [5135] But Dad
Phillip (PS1BT) [5136] don't you?
David (PS1BV)   [5137] but [sigh] ... three er ... there.
                [5138] Check that number.
                [5139] Ha!
                [5140] That was stupid.
                [5141] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5142] Mm mm.
                [5143] So Mrs was showing you how to do this?
David (PS1BV)   [5144] Right.
                [5145] Yes. [...]
Phillip (PS1BT) [5146] What, what else have you learnt to do with a calculator?
                [5147] If you had four things
David (PS1BV)   [5148] Yes.
                [5149] If I give them
Phillip (PS1BT) [5150] and you wanted to divide them among four people
David (PS1BV)   [5151] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5152] how many would each person get?
David (PS1BV)   [5153] But I don I, I, I didn't quite get the question.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5154] If you had four things and you wanted to divide them
                between four people
David (PS1BV)   [5155] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5156] how many would each person get?
David (PS1BV)   [5157] Two.
                [5158] No, one.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5159] That's better.
                [5160] Now you did that without a calculator didn't you?
David (PS1BV)   [5161] Oh I see.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5162] Right, now this time do it with the calculator.
                [5163] So you've got
David (PS1BV)   [5164] Four ... turn it on.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5165] Turn it on.
                [5166] ... You run out of light?
                [5167] There are.
                [5168] Now you're on.
                [5169] Which figure do you want?
                [5170] No.
                [5171] No.
                [5172] You're dividing.
David (PS1BV)   [5173] Which one's divide?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5174] That one.
                [5175] Divide by
David (PS1BV)   [5176] Four.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5177] Yes.
                [5178] That's right.
                [5179] Equals?
                [5180] Right.
                [5181] Now that wa that time, that's easy.
                [5182] That just proves what you already know.
David (PS1BV)   [5183] Right dad, I'll show you something else.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5184] No.
                [5185] I was going to do more [...]
David (PS1BV)   [5186] But I wa I want to show you something, that's all.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5187] Go on then.
                [5188] Nine, fifty six ... square root.
David (PS1BV)   [5189] Er
Phillip (PS1BT) [5190] Who taught you that?
David (PS1BV)   [5191] [laughing] Well, I lis no one.
                [5192] It's Mrs said to Mark
Phillip (PS1BT) [5193] Just a minute.
David (PS1BV)   [5194] he, he, he was getting the ... controls wrong.
                [5195] [laughing] He pressed square root instead of equals [] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5196] Yes.
                [5197] And so you've discovered
David (PS1BV)   [5198] Eh!
Phillip (PS1BT) [5199] the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine,
                seven nine, five, eight nine.
                [5200] But do you know what square root means?
David (PS1BV)   [5201] What?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5202] Well the square root of a number
David (PS1BV)   [5203] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5204] is the number which if multiplied by itself
David (PS1BV)   [5205] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5206] gives you back the number you started with.
                [5207] Take, for , the easiest one is ... four.
                [5208] The square root of four is two.
                [5209] Try it on your machine.
David (PS1BV)   [5210] Right.
                [5211] What do I press?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5212] Four ... four, square root ... and it gives you two.
                [5213] Because two times two ... gives you four.
                [5214] Try the square root of nine.
                [5215] ... Just press clear.
David (PS1BV)   [5216] Yeah, I just press this one.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5217] Yes.
                [5218] Clear that bit.
David (PS1BV)   [5219] Cos it clears the whole mind.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5220] Right.
David (PS1BV)   [5221] What shall I press?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5222] Nine ... square root ... is three.
                [5223] So if you multiply three times three ... you get nine.
                [5224] Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because
                if you go to sixteen
David (PS1BV)   [5225] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5226] the square root is four.
David (PS1BV)   [5227] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5228] And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
                [5229] That's the number which multiplied by its ... self
David (PS1BV)   [5230] Right.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5231] gives you the number.
                [5232] Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number
                like six.
David (PS1BV)   [5233] Oh yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5234] Try and find the square root of six.
                [5235] What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be.
                [5236] Don't, don't press the button.
                [5237] Six.
David (PS1BV)   [5238] Er er
Phillip (PS1BT) [5239] What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by
                itself to get six?
David (PS1BV)   [5240] Three.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5241] No.
                [5242] Three times three is?
David (PS1BV)   [5243] I don ... six, six.
                [5244] [...] ... It's three.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5245] No.
                [5246] Three times three.
David (PS1BV)   [5247] I don't know the answer!
Phillip (PS1BT) [5248] Well look ... three ... three ... and three.
                [5249] So how many have you got?
David (PS1BV)   [5250] Ten.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5251] [laughing] No!
                [5252] Plonker [] !
                [5253] You've got nine.
David (PS1BV)   [5254] I'm just going
Phillip (PS1BT) [5255] Anyway
David (PS1BV)   [5256] to check.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5257] So, there you are.
                [5258] It's two point four four nine, which really, is very
                close to two and a half.
                [5259] Which isn't quite right.
David (PS1BV)   [...]
Phillip (PS1BT) [5260] Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so
                you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time.
                [5261] That gets very difficult.
David (PS1BV)   [5262] Right.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5263] Right.
                [5264] So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
David (PS1BV)   [5265] Right, I'll show you.
                [5266] Ten ... square root ... is
Phillip (PS1BT) [5267] Three point one six two two seven seven six.
David (PS1BV)   [5268] Right.
                [5269] Eh eh.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5270] Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one
                point three five four one five six.
                [5271] Very clever.
                [5272] Useless for you though.
                [5273] You don't really need that information do you?
David (PS1BV)   [5274] Well dad!
Phillip (PS1BT) [5275] So what, what, what sort of information do you need?
David (PS1BV)   [5276] Tt.
                [5277] Counting information.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5278] Well, if you went out doing your favourite hobby.
David (PS1BV)   [5279] Yes.
                [5280] [...] an engine.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5281] Pardon?
David (PS1BV)   [5282] Getting in an engine.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5283] Driving an engine.
                [5284] Now how would sums come into that?
David (PS1BV)   [5285] What!
                [5286] You can't get sums in an engine's smoke box.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5287] Mm.
                [5288] You could if they would burn.
David (PS1BV)   [laugh]
Phillip (PS1BT) [5289] Well you co
David (PS1BV)   [5290] I, I want to get clever with you.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5291] Oh I thought you had been.
                [5292] Shall we turn that off now then?
David (PS1BV)   [5293] I'll get [...]
Jane (PS1BS)    [5294] [...] on [...] City News there's gonna be something
                about trams in Manchester somebody wants to see.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5295] Well is it the new ones or is it, on the television, or
                on the radio?
Jane (PS1BS)    [5296] Yeah, on, on the television.

David (PS1BV)   [5299] [whispering] Yes [] .

Jane (PS1BS)    [5306] What?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5307] Is this the first part of the news or the second
Jane (PS1BS)    [5308] No.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5309] bit?
Jane (PS1BS)    [5310] It's the second half.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5311] So there won't be much more?
Jane (PS1BS)    [5312] No.
                [5313] Oh no, I mean it's about another ... another eight
                minutes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5314] Right.
Jane (PS1BS)    [5315] I thought he'd want to see, [...] take my shower.

                [5318] Right Dave, what do you want to do now while you're
                waiting?
David (PS1BV)   [5319] Get really clever!
Phillip (PS1BT) [5320] So how are you gonna get really clever?
David (PS1BV)   [5321] I'm going to get two sheets of paper and two pencils
                [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5322] I haven't got time for a lot of stuff.
                [5323] Don don't be getting a lot out tonight cos you've got
                Julie coming.
David (PS1BV)   [5324] They're not a lot anyway.

*** 9 (Tape 076302) ***
Phillip (PS1BT) [5327] Right what do you want?
David (PS1BV)   [5328] Take one sheet.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5329] I've got one sheet.
David (PS1BV)   [5330] Take the green crayon then.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5331] Right, I've got the green crayon.
David (PS1BV)   [5332] Put it that way.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5333] Hang on let me just ... turn the television down.
                [5334] ... You ... you keep your eye on it so that when your
                tra tram programme comes on we can watch it.
                [5335] Right.
                [5336] What to do?
David (PS1BV)   [5337] Well it's
Phillip (PS1BT) [...]
David (PS1BV)   [5338] that way you need it.
                [5339] I want a table for this.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5340] Well you can't use these tables.
                [5341] Don't ... let me just move this ... magazine.
David (PS1BV)   [5342] Write ... five on it.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5343] Have I got to write five on mine?
David (PS1BV)   [5344] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5345] Right.
                [5346] My green pen doesn't write very well.
                [5347] There you are.
David (PS1BV)   [5348] Double add.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5349] Double add?
                [5350] I'm not used to double add.
                [5351] Five plus plus ... equals
David (PS1BV)   [5352] Equals
Phillip (PS1BT) [5353] Equals, equals?
                [5354] Well this is a bit of a nonsense.
                [5355] ... What's that?
                [5356] One hundred plus plus
David (PS1BV)   [5357] Equals, equals.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5358] Equals, equals.
David (PS1BV)   [5359] Now it gets easier.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5360] Mhm.
David (PS1BV)   [5361] Now it gets really even harder.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5362] Well which way is it?
                [5363] Does it get harder or easier?
                [5364] ... Three hundred.
David (PS1BV)   [5365] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5366] Oh, three hundred and four.
                [5367] ... I, I'm not understanding when you're doing plus plus
                when you're writing down yourself.
                [5368] What are you trying to prove?
David (PS1BV)   [5369] Divide
Phillip (PS1BT) [5370] Mm.
                [5371] Well that's, that's, that's very good for divide, but
                that's a square root sign.
David (PS1BV)   [5372] A square root.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5373] A square root at three hundred and four?
David (PS1BV)   [5374] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5375] Haven't a clue.
David (PS1BV)   [5376] Equals
Phillip (PS1BT) [5377] Equals ... now what do you want me to do with all these?
David (PS1BV)   [5378] Guess.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5379] Oh I'm guessing.
David (PS1BV)   [5380] Write your name at the top.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5381] It's alright writing my name Dave but what am I doing?
                [5382] ... Mm?
David (PS1BV)   [5383] It's easier and easier.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5384] Well it doesn't look easy.
                [5385] Look, I'll do the usual.
                [5386] Let me write you down some sums.
David (PS1BV)   [...]
Phillip (PS1BT) [5387] And you, you can answer them.
David (PS1BV)   [5388] Okay.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5389] Sorry.
                [5390] I've put an answer in where you don't want.
                [5391] ... There you are.
                [5392] There's a nice list of sums for you.
                [5393] Just get on with
David (PS1BV)   [5394] What
Phillip (PS1BT) [5395] those.
                [5396] That's it.
David (PS1BV)   [5397] Well it isn't easy.
                [5398] It's the right one.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5399] Bu yes, you got it right.
                [5400] I, I shouldn't have written that.
David (PS1BV)   [5401] You sho ... [whispering] [...] , five, six, seven, eight
                [] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5402] Good
David (PS1BV)   [5403] [whispering] [...] [] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5404] Speak up.
David (PS1BV)   [5405] How do you do a seven?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5406] Er er, like that.
                [5407] You know how to do a seven.
                [5408] Oh here's the tram bit.
                [5409] Let's fli turn up the sound ... then we can ... [tv on]
                ... No you've done that backwards, it's seventeen not seventy
                one.
                [5410] Here we go look.
                [5411] ... Oh look Dave this is great!
                [5412] Going ... back to the old trams.
David (PS1BV)   [5413] But how can they go through the towns?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5414] Well trams Dave ... they do both, they go on the railway
                lines and they go through the town centre.
                [5415] ... Right.
                [5416] Oh dear!
David (PS1BV)   [5417] Don't watch this [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5418] The Olympics, not that far away.
                [5419] ... Right.
David (PS1BV)   [5420] Let's see.
                [5421] Seven minus two is
Phillip (PS1BT) [5422] Good.
                [5423] ... Ah ah!
                [5424] That's wrong.
                [5425] ... Right.
                [5426] I'll just turn off the television then we can
                concentrate on
David (PS1BV)   [5427] I can.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5428] Da David!
                [5429] You're not doing very well on that question and you've
                done harder ones.
                [5430] Remember how you do it.
                [5431] Add the four to the three
David (PS1BV)   [5432] I have.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5433] and what do you get?
David (PS1BV)   [5434] Eighteen!
Phillip (PS1BT) [5435] No you don't.
                [5436] Well do it, do it the way on your fingers.
                [5437] You've got thirteen plus four.
                [5438] Thirteen ... Got it now?
David (PS1BV)   [5439] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5440] Plonker!
                [5441] Right.
                [5442] Now let's do this one.
                [5443] This is, this is easy.
                [5444] ... Great!
                [5445] Now yo there you are now then ... now getting a little
                harder but you can do it in just the same way.
David (PS1BV)   [5446] [whispering] [...] [] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5447] So what's the answer?
                [5448] ... Yes!
                [5449] You've got it right.
                [5450] Now this last one ... then we'll do something different.
                [5451] ... That's right.
                [5452] Thirty three minus two is ... thirty one.
                [5453] That's not bad.
                [5454] Right what do you want to do now?
                [5455] ... Mm?
David (PS1BV)   [5456] Er er, I don't know.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5457] Right.
                [5458] Well we can do plenty of that.
                [5459] ... Have you cleared up all your toys and everything
                before Julie comes?
David (PS1BV)   [5460] There's that [...]
Phillip (PS1BT) [5461] Well then ... why is it still out?
                [5462] ... And have you cleared up everything in the dining
                room?
David (PS1BV)   [5463] Oh my er ... trees are still out.
                [5464] Chrissy hasn't put all the ... climbing up things away.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5465] Mm mm.
                [5466] Well shall we go through and do some clearing up then?
                [5467] Come on.
                [5468] Go and put these pens away and the paper please.
David (PS1BV)   [5469] We'll do some writing then.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5470] Not tonight we won't.
                [5471] There's not gonna be any more time.
                [5472] Go put those away please.
                [5473] Off you go.
*** 10 (Tape 076303) ***
Phillip (PS1BT) [5474] Right.
                [5475] Now you said you were gonna tell me what's happened on
                the news so far.
David (PS1BV)   [5476] Three people have er been killed in a railway accident
                after their ... their car ... ran into the side of a train.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5477] Oh dear!
David (PS1BV)   [5478] Wh which is about er ... which ... is about er ... open
                ... er ... the day after tomorrow.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5479] What's open ... the day after tomorrow?
David (PS1BV)   [5480] The level crossing.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5481] Oh it's closed now is it?
David (PS1BV)   [5482] No, they're going to open it.
                [5483] It's new.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5484] Aha.
                [5485] ... What else has been happening?
David (PS1BV)   [5486] And dad?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5487] Yes.
David (PS1BV)   [5488] You know that many level crossings are one barrier?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5489] Yes.
David (PS1BV)   [5490] Well that ... they showed us er ... a thing about ...
                the speed about ... about the traffic approaching lights when
                they're ... starting flashing.
                [5491] It showed you a car go over that, going over,tha a lorry
                going over crossing and the lights were starting to flash.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5492] Well a lot of people do that.
                [5493] It's very dangerous.
David (PS1BV)   [5494] But I was supposed to stop.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5495] They ha as soon as the lights flash supposed to stop.
                [5496] Be
David (PS1BV)   [5497] What the running of the railway line?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5498] No, they're supposed to stop before the lights.
                [5499] Silly!
David (PS1BV)   [5500] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5501] Because, on a lot of those the train
David (PS1BV)   [5502] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5503] activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
David (PS1BV)   [5504] Yes cos most,o most of that one barrier, it said on the
                news that they're o automatic.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5505] That's right.
                [5506] So
David (PS1BV)   [5507] They have er special cameras which ... they take the
                line of the trains both sides.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5508] Mhm.
                [5509] And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when
                the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers
                ... the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and
                could hit you.
                [5510] So it's a very silly thing to do.
David (PS1BV)   [5511] Yes.
                [5512] Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going
                across.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5513] Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd
                probably get across.
                [5514] But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come
David (PS1BV)   [5515] If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on
                the railway ... er th ... ah ... there's only way you can
                escape.
                [5516] Go round by the barrier pole.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5517] Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in
                Driffield.
David (PS1BV)   [5518] Yes.
                [5519] The barriers
Phillip (PS1BT) [5520] Er
David (PS1BV)   [5521] [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5522] they've got full barriers you see.
David (PS1BV)   [5523] Full barriers.
                [5524] Double are safe.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5525] Well, they're different because they have them ...
                they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're
David (PS1BV)   [5526] Yes they are controlled.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5527] controlled by a television.
                [5528] Er
David (PS1BV)   [5529] If they're controlled ... well dad, everyone knows that
                one th the Tackleby's controlled by a man.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5530] Oh yes.
                [5531] That was good wasn't it?
David (PS1BV)   [5532] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5533] Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box didn't
                you?
David (PS1BV)   [5534] Oh yes.
                [5535] But ... though it was rather dangerous.
                [5536] After all in my, you know my er ... people working on
                the rails book?
                [5537] The one
Phillip (PS1BT) [5538] Yes.
David (PS1BV)   [5539] [...] .
                [5540] It says, you must never try to steer ru steer round a bu
                barrier poles.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5541] That's right.
David (PS1BV)   [5542] And they're trying to take away as many er ... possible
                erm, mainly one barrier er ... railway gates as possible.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5543] Well I didn't know they were trying to get rid of those.
David (PS1BV)   [5544] Especially on busy main roads.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5545] But some of the crossings around this area didn't have
                any barriers at all
David (PS1BV)   [5546] Ah ah.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5547] and ... they just had the flashing lights.
David (PS1BV)   [5548] Well it's like wo ones at Meading Ro Meadow Road.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5549] That's right.
David (PS1BV)   [5550] They're only wooden ones.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5551] Ah well tha no Meadow Road's got the old gates but ...
                at Natherton there were some that didn't have any ... barriers
                at all, they were just flashing lights.
                [5552] Now, do you remember ... now let's think whether you
                were born.
                [5553] When the Lockington railway disaster happened ... that
                was just a few miles from here.
David (PS1BV)   [5554] At Manchester?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5555] No, Lockington.
David (PS1BV)   [5556] Ah.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5557] And that was where er, a train came off the railways
                when it hit a van ... on
David (PS1BV)   [5558] Oh.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5559] on the crossing er and killed a lot of people.
David (PS1BV)   [5560] Oh.
                [5561] I, I, I know, I'd, I have never heard ... never heard.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5562] Oh!
                [5563] That's sa surprise cos I was on the way to Hull ... oh
                yes!
                [5564] You were around because I was going to take you and
                Chrissy to Hull to a train fair
David (PS1BV)   [5565] Ah yes!
                [5566] And mum and Chrissy slept in the car.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5567] and and th that's ri they were, they, mum was gonna stay
                at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train
David (PS1BV)   [5568] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5569] and then mum decided she was going to come so we took
                the car.
                [5570] And we might, might well have been on that train that
                had the crash.
David (PS1BV)   [5571] Yes.
                [5572] Thank goodness we didn't.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5573] Well it was one of those things wasn't it?
David (PS1BV)   [5574] Well it's a good job mum came.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5575] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)   [5576] I hope, I hope [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT) [5577] Well we went past the crash and we could see that there
                was something going on but we weren't sure what it was.
                [5578] It happened just after we went past the, just before.
                [5579] You could see ... er ... a couple of Land Rovers going
                down with flashing blue lights and things towards
David (PS1BV)   [5580] I
Phillip (PS1BT) [5581] the crossing.
David (PS1BV)   [5582] And th th and they would be police ones if they'd got
                blue lights and
Phillip (PS1BT) [5583] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)   [5584] so did you, could you hear the sirens?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5585] No I couldn't.
                [5586] But erm ... when we, by the time we got into Hull I
                heard it on the radio what had happened ... and we went to the
                toy fair and then we came back ... and there was er ... you
                could see all the ambulances and everything still there.
                [5587] And the train was there leaning over.
David (PS1BV)   [5588] But half of it was still on the rails.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5589] Yes it was the front coaches went off.
David (PS1BV)   [5590] Front coaches?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5591] Onto the side I think.
David (PS1BV)   [5592] Well what sort of express?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5593] It was erm ... well what do you think it would be?
David (PS1BV)   [5594] Er ... I think it must have been a multiple unit.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5595] That's right.
                [5596] It was a diesel multiple unit.
                [5597] And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
David (PS1BV)   [5598] Yes.
                [5599] Thank goodness for that!
                [5600] I wouldn't want one of those, one of the pacers or
                sprinters or metros spoilt.
Phillip (PS1BT) [laugh]
David (PS1BV)   [5601] But dad!
                [5602] They're all multiple units ... at sometimes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5603] Yes, of course they are, but we, I was talking about the
                old sort of diesel multiple unit.
David (PS1BV)   [5604] Yes.
                [5605] One with the yellow front.
                [5606] You can get all different sorts of, one with two red
                lights erm ... one with two windows ... [...]
Phillip (PS1BT) [5607] Can you?
David (PS1BV)   [5608] Yes.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5609] Mm.
                [5610] I'm pleased you know your trains.
David (PS1BV)   [...]
Phillip (PS1BT) [5611] Yeah.
                [5612] Right.
                [5613] Well I'm gonna have to start thinking about getting
                ready.
                [5614] What about you getting ready for bed now?
David (PS1BV)   [5615] Dad.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5616] Mhm?
David (PS1BV)   [5617] What about the Manchester ... crossing disaster?
Phillip (PS1BT) [5618] Which one was that?
David (PS1BV)   [5619] Er, just outside Manchester.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5620] Mm mm.
                [5621] Can't remember that one.
David (PS1BV)   [5622] The one about those two boys playing on the track.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5623] Oh!
                [5624] Is that one they've told you about at school?
David (PS1BV)   [5625] No.
                [5626] No.
                [5627] I got it from the telly.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5628] Oh!
                [5629] Did you now?
David (PS1BV)   [5630] No.
                [5631] You, you told me about it when you came home once.
                [5632] You told me about that disaster.
Phillip (PS1BT) [5633] Well, your memory's better than mine.

                it.

                happens.

Julie (PS1BW) [5915] Dear.
              [5916] It's lovely isn't it?
Jane (PS1BS)  [5917] Mm.
Janet (PS6R1) [5918] Had it trimmed, do you feel better?
Jane (PS1BS)  [5919] She's taken quite a lot off actually.
              [5920] And that ... it didn't feel it when she was sort of
              combing it, but now I'm actually doing that I can feel it short.
Julie (PS1BW) [5921] It's not there.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5922] Mind you, it needed it.
              [5923] It did need it.
              [5924] She said it did.
Janet (PS6R1) [5925] Oh I need a cut.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5926] So ... [laughing] yeah [] .
              [5927] So, I'm thinking oh it's hard, when I actually feel it it
              feels thicker at the end and it does feel better but ... when
              I've washed it, I shall feel all hairy now all afternoon.
Janet (PS6R1) [5928] Yes.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5929] [laughing] I'm just going to look [] .
              [5930] Yeah.
Julie (PS1BW) [5931] Yeah, that's a really nice trim.

Julie (PS1BW) [5935] I can't bear the tables and chairs at this [...] bottles
              of wine.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5936] Bottles of wine or ... nice cold lager. [laugh]
Julie (PS1BW) [5937] Yeah.
              [5938] Alright.
              [5939] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5940] I almost envy the unemployed when they're sort of walking
              along the side the canal and [laugh]
Jane (PS1BS)  [5941] Playing with their grandchildren.
Julie (PS1BW) [laugh]
Jane (PS1BS)  [5942] That was.
Janet (PS6R1) [5943] Is it her grandson?
Julie (PS1BW) [5944] Aha.
Janet (PS6R1) [5945] That is.
Julie (PS1BW) [5946] We had loads of people in [...] last week.

Janet (PS6R1) [5949] Innit sad, isn't it really?
Jane (PS1BS)  [5950] I don't feel sorry for that man who came in on drugs and
              dropped [...]
Janet (PS6R1) [5951] Oh no!
              [5952] I didn't tell Julie about that.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5953] and when they were making, making a sign on the door
Janet (PS6R1) [5954] He had a cigarette in his hand and flicking ash up the
              carpet and I [laughing] was looking at him, you know, and I was
              sort of going, [cough] [] and Jane was sat in here and she said,
              put that cigarette out! [laugh]
Jane (PS1BS)  [5955] [laughing] Cheeky [] !
Janet (PS6R1) [5956] He usually smell, erm the air [...]
Jane (PS1BS)  [5957] And now cigar smoke I quite like.
              [5958] But I, the other day I wondered who it was and it must
              have been him cos he was in Alan's office.
              [5959] But er ... cigarette smoke, I mean you wouldn't think of
              pu I don't whether it was a strong make or something like that
              but it was, it seemed really offensive didn't
Janet (PS6R1) [5960] I know.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5961] it?
              [5962] Mm mm.
Janet (PS6R1) [5963] He said he was desperate for work.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5964] Yeah.
              [5965] For work.
              [5966] And then he had a real flash car didn't he? [laugh]
Janet (PS6R1) [5967] Desperate to get work, he's got a flash car and smoking
              [laughing] as well
Julie (PS1BW) [5968] [laughing] And smoking []
Janet (PS6R1) [5969] well I mean that's costly isn't it?
Jane (PS1BS)  [5970] This is it.
Julie (PS1BW) [...]
Jane (PS1BS)  [5971] But what er, I said, told Pete because I had another call
              when you ... were at lunch I think ... and erm ... he said he'd
              heard rumours that we were looking for somebody.
Janet (PS6R1) [5972] Mm mm.
Jane (PS1BS)  [5973] Now whether he'd just said that, or ... whether he
              actually had.

Phillip (PS1BT) [5999] No, it's too low.
                [6000] I thought we'd sit on that bench and
Jane (PS1BS)    [6001] I must ring Gwyneth.
Phillip (PS1BT) [6002] Mm.
                [6003] Ring her up, see if she wants to come down for a drink.

Phillip (PS1BT) [6006] Yeah.
                [6007] If she's in.
Jane (PS1BS)    [6008] I don't know about her mother.
                [6009] Erm, I wondered if I should ask her if she's going to
                the chinese tomorrow if she wants to drop in ... on the way
                home.
Phillip (PS1BT) [6010] A chinese tomorrow?

                election results or do you think if I start having a party
                tomorrow night it's gonna get out of hand?
Phillip (PS1BT) [6013] Well, the only trouble is, she won't be voting the way
                you are.
Jane (PS1BS)    [6014] I know.
Phillip (PS1BT) [6015] We

                isn't it?
                [6024] It means, if she's away two nights
Phillip (PS1BT) [6025] There's a nail sticking out of here.
Jane (PS1BS)    [6026] Yes I noticed that.
                [6027] It wants ... I keep meaning to hammer it in.

Christopher (PS1BU) [6179] They've had the school dinners in different places
                    before.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6180] Yes, but probably the school actually is bigger than
                    this, there's more people there than when you were in there
                    and erm, that's probably just too complicated.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6181] Mm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6182] Yeah.
                    [6183] I'm sure David won't mind sandwiches for a day.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6184] It's quite exciting.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6185] It won't be that good.
                    [6186] They'll just go down
Jane (PS1BS)        [6187] That's enough then.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6188] first every day.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6189] Pardon?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6190] Pardon?
Christopher (PS1BU) [6191] They'll just go down first every day.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6192] Yeah, well it doesn't matter Chris.
                    [6193] Okay Chris, you can try the new one love if you've
                    done that.
                    [6194] Let's get this in the bin.
David (PS1BV)       [6195] And that.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6196] Just erm, now, do you need anything?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6197] No we got so many of them that erm, I'll, I'll
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6198] You don't want that one?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6199] No.
                    [6200] You can throw that.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6201] As long as you're okay on that.
                    [6202] Can I sit down now?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6203] Only if I can have a lump of your bread.
                    [6204] In fact, maybe you should offer me the plate.
                    [6205] Can you pass me the butter?
                    [6206] Thank you.
                    [6207] I must admit I'm very hungry.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6208] Well so you should be.
                    [6209] Working at the garden.
                    [6210] ... Like you've had a gardener in.
                    [6211] ... Can I have it please?
                    [6212] Thank you.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6213] Don't worry David, I'll pick it up.
                    [6214] ... I didn't have a chance to put these out on a
                    dish either.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6215] [sighing] Oh [] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6216] You mean, I haven't put it out on a dish?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6217] Okay?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6218] Chrissy?
Christopher (PS1BU) [6219] Mm?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6220] Want some turkey?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6221] Do you want some turkey?
Christopher (PS1BU) [6222] No thanks.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6223] Did you David?
Christopher (PS1BU) [6224] I've got hazelnut and ham haven't I?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6225] Mm mm.
                    [6226] ... [...] , one of those.
                    [6227] And some of that.
                    [6228] I didn't wash all ... this so there's
Jane (PS1BS)        [6229] Well I must admit
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6230] there's more if you need it.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6231] it tastes better if it's washed and put in that, in
                    that cling film.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6232] Mhm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6233] It keeps better than ... it's left in the bottom of
                    the fridge.
                    [6234] ... Has David got some coleslaw?
                    [6235] You will eat your coleslaw honey won't you?
David (PS1BV)       [6236] Mhm.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6237] He's got some but he's not very enthusiastic.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6238] I thought you said you liked it?
David (PS1BV)       [6239] I go off and on it, but
Jane (PS1BS)        [6240] Oh.
David (PS1BV)       [6241] sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6242] Right.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6243] Ow!
Jane (PS1BS)        [6244] But it, it doesn't keep forever.
                    [6245] When did I make it?
                    [6246] Saturday.
                    [6247] So it wants using.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6248] I'm doing my best, you know ma
Jane (PS1BS)        [6249] Well, I've made some more since then.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6250] you know me ... and coleslaw.
                    [6251] Oh, so I don't have to rush it?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6252] Well, not that.
                    [6253] I'd prefer it to go.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6254] Have you got everything you want kiddies?
David (PS1BV)       [6255] Yeah.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6256] Yes.
                    [6257] And a bag of crisps, got the same packet.
                    [6258] ... Boys, when we next see Gywneth will you be nice
                    and quiet and kind to her, her Mummy's just died?
Christopher (PS1BU) [6259] Ah ah!
Jane (PS1BS)        [6260] Isn't that sad?
David (PS1BV)       [6261] Mm.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6262] What of?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6263] Erm ... well she's an elderly lady.
                    [6264] Erm
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6265] Heart problem wasn't it?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6266] heart problems, that's what I said.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6267] Mm.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6268] So she's always very nice to you, so make sure
                    you're very nice to her.
                    [6269] ... She hasn't got children to take her mind
                    [laughing] off her problems [] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [yawn]
David (PS1BV)       [6270] Ah, if she had children, it's a pity she doesn't.
Jane (PS1BS)        [laugh]
Christopher (PS1BU) [6271] Be nice to be able to play with them.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6272] There are the, other ways of looking at it Chris.
                    [6273] Not that I'd wish to encourage you, but if she had
                    children she wouldn't be so generous to you.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6274] Mm mm.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6275] No.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6276] [laugh] ... Cos she's very generous.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6277] Very.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6278] She spends more on you on your birthdays than your
                    grandparents do.
                    [6279] So think about that.
                    [6280] ... Doesn't she?
                    [6281] Indeed she does.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6282] It's still a, it's still a present for her grandma.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6283] Ow!
                    [6284] Shouldn't have mentioned grandma!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6285] Only one of them.
Christopher (PS1BU) [clears throat]
David (PS1BV)       [6286] We, we must go there at some stage ... to see her.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6287] Yeah.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6288] She's in Japan at the moment.
                    [6289] We're hoping she'll stay there.
David (PS1BV)       [6290] We'll, well [...] .
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6291] Ha!
Jane (PS1BS)        [6292] Come the end, end of the summer you haven't got a
                    clue.
                    [6293] I wonder why?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6294] Mm mm.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6295] That was quite nice.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6296] Has Bill got one?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6297] Mm mm!
                    [6298] They've all two ... except me.
David (PS1BV)       [humming]
Jane (PS1BS)        [6299] Can we decide what we are doing this weekend because
                    erm
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6300] You tell me.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6301] Well what's the options?
                    [6302] We either stay home or we ... stay home or we're
                    going away.
                    [6303] If we go away I think it's too early in the year to
                    use the caravan, therefore it means staying at
Christopher (PS1BU) [6304] Tent.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6305] somebody's.
                    [6306] [laughing] A tent [] !
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6307] Mm mm!
Jane (PS1BS)        [6308] [clears throat] ... Or there's the tent.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6309] Is that what you want Chris?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6310] You can, oh you can have, the tent up on the back
                    lawn if you, if you're so bothered about camping.
                    [6311] I don't think I want to go in tent this time of
                    year.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6312] Ring up Ted and Linda and see while they're going
                    over to your mother's we'll go over to Aberystwyth.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6313] Yes.
                    [6314] Well they have
Christopher (PS1BU) [...]
Jane (PS1BS)        [6315] got
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6316] We'll bo borrow their house.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6317] I used to like, camping's o ... okay Christopher,
                    but it's difficult when you've got children.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6318] Oh.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6319] And when the nights ... are that much darker early.
                    [6320] When it was just your Dad and I we, we could go out
                    all evening and then, then come back to the tent, but when
                    we've got you two we have to be back in the [...] , we
                    can't go out in the evenings.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6321] Where's the wine?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6322] On top of the microwave.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6323] That's where you might expect to find cold wine.
                    [6324] ... More?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6325] Mm mm.
                    [6326] Oh only a bit cos I [laugh] ... [laughing] I've
                    gotta cut David's hair tonight [] .
                    [6327] I'll cut your ears off.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6328] Squiggly hair.
                    [6329] ... Mouth closed please Dave.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6330] So, if we went away it's, it's really only
                    Aberystwyth or ... or [...] isn't it?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6331] Mm mm.
David (PS1BV)       [6332] I, I'd prefer [...] .
Jane (PS1BS)        [6333] Well ... cos I think Phil and Lesley are going to
                    grandma's ... for Easter ... and ... they live in [...] ,
                    and therefore it depe it depends what Aunty Dulcy's doing.
                    [6334] I mean, we could ring her up and ask her.
                    [6335] Or shall we just stay at home and go out for days
                    and
David (PS1BV)       [6336] Go to my parties.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6337] Yes, you'd miss the parties if we went away.
                    [6338] But I need to know cos I'll do a turkey ... if we're
                    staying home.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6339] Why?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6340] Well
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6341] Well there's York model railway exhibition that
                    weekend but we could still see that and go away.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6342] I've got a Christmas pudding as well, left over from
                    Christmas.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6343] Mind you, if it costs three pounds a head to get in
                    you'll probably not want to go.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6344] I'll sit outside.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6345] Ha!
Christopher (PS1BU) [6346] Children free probably.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6347] One pound
Jane (PS1BS)        [6348] What about stu
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6349] fifty.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6350] what about student concessions?
                    [6351] Do they have student ... no?
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6352] Don't
Jane (PS1BS)        [6353] I
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6354] know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6355] I would have thought so.
                    [6356] I mean, they usually do these things, if you flash
                    your student card.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6357] Pensioners and children, one pound fifty.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6358] Here you are.
                    [6359] They do students as well.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6360] Unless they [...] at school.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6361] I keep forgetting to, well you can [...] ,
                    forgetting to use my student card.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6362] I'm not student.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6363] Well you are really aren't you?
                    [6364] But, when they mean student they mean people who are
                    over eighteen or nineteen.
David (PS1BV)       [6365] Mum.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6366] Mm?

                    [6376] Can I have a drop of milk please ... pardon? [laugh]

Christopher (PS1BU) [6377] Er pardon.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6378] If you'd have said please David I
David (PS1BV)       [6379] The opposite to please.
                    [6380] Thank you.
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6381] What is the opposite to please.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6382] It's a

Jane (PS1BS)        [6384] Yes, that will be thank you is the right
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6385] No.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6386] thing.

                    [6392] ... Throw him in the pond.

David (PS1BV)       [6394] No oh oh oh!
Phillip (PS1BT)     [6395] You want Ribena do you Chris?
David (PS1BV)       [6396] Dad!
                    [6397] You're not allowed to ... to talk like that to
                    people's dog.
                    [6398] And especially dogs we know.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6399] I'm surprised the boys let it run their garden.
David (PS1BV)       [6400] What ... well it was David ... David's idea, don't
                    blame me.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6401] I said to Julie ... the office was quiet.
                    [6402] She said that was a nice day [laughing] they've all
                    gone out [] .

                    [6404] ... Says who?
Christopher (PS1BU) [6405] Says who?
                    [6406] On patrol.
                    [6407] They do.
                    [6408] Must be, some of the girls lay down.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6409] That, well, ask Daddy not me.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6410] Can I have one of my mini chocolate orange things?
Jane (PS1BS)        [6411] Well it can wait till after we've finished and yes
                    you ca cer certainly can.
David (PS1BV)       [6412] And me?

                    I?

                    [6416] Eh!
                    [6417] You want to get your violins done?
                    [6418] Are you racing?
Christopher (PS1BU) [6419] I want to disturb David.
Jane (PS1BS)        [6420] Well I don't think he will either.
Christopher (PS1BU) [6421] Well
