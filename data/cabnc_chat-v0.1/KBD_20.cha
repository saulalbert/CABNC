        And all that up there. •599170_600810•
        Mm! •600810_600900•
        Now then, so you'd  carpet them two •601510_606880•
*BAR:	Yeah. •607340_607750•
*ALA:	and then  summat  washed •607750_609920•
*BAR:	Well you see, hardly anybody ever they don't really sit in this area, all they do is er, I mean, they only sit  •611630_621410•
*ALA:	Around the bar. •621520_622190•
*BAR:	right at the end of the, you know  •622190_623140•
*ALA:	Yeah. •623140_623210•
*BAR:	when it's full  they'll sit on those two tables. •623210_624840•
*ALA:	You were going to clear that area anyway, don't they? •624840_626350•
*BAR:	Yeah. •626350_626480•
        I mean, everybody round here just stands  or sits on those bar stools. •626490_629860•
*ALA:	Mm. •629860_630030•
        Yeah. •630070_630280•
*BAR:	When people first come in they go for the raised areas and sit down. •630280_634470•
         •634540_•
*ALA:	You have to see. •634610_635960•
*BAR:	or they stand at the bar. •636190_636970•
        It's, and, and if you actually look on the actual area we're talking about, there's only one, two, three, four, there's only about  half a dozen tables. •637080_645040•
*ALA:	Yeah. •645060_645090•
*BAR:	Which is, you know, at maximum you're gonna get twenty four people sat around there anyway. •645090_649210•
        So I think, in a way, it's erm  a bit wasted carpeting it all. •649210_653650•
        Cos it's a big area  •653650_655210•
*ALA:	I do. •655210_655490•
*BAR:	to carpet. •655490_655790•

*ALA:	Well you,did you look to change the carpet  •661210_662820•
*BAR:	eighteen to twenty seven. •662880_663600•
*ALA:	because of the name on it? •664000_666320•
*BAR:	Well  yeah, and  •666320_666730•
*ALA:	You are? •667140_668140•
*BAR:	and it's getting past it to be honest. •668140_669460•
        I mean, these metal strips are down there for the public entertainment license, they weren't gonna give us it because the carpet was lifting. •669520_675830•
*ALA:	Yeah. •675900_676200•
*BAR:	So  I mean, not, weren't gonna give us it, but we had to do it for •676280_681500•
*ALA:	Yeah. •681500_681670•
*BAR:	you know, at the time. •681670_682380•
*ALA:	Yeah. •682380_682440•
*BAR:	And you can see like  like there  can you see straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet, but there's er been a a bit of a leak at some stage. •682700_688950•
*ALA:	Oh right, I see. •689240_690090•
*BAR:	There's one there. •690090_690610•
        I mean •690620_690830•
*ALA:	Yeah. •690830_690970•
*BAR:	if you've got it carpeted, once you got that you, you're  you're stuck aren't you? •691360_695440•
        You know  •695470_695600•
*ALA:	Yeah. •695600_695760•
*BAR:	you've either got  I mean, we've either gotta put a  table on top of it or   •695760_698510•

        Yes. •700910_700970•
*BAR:	Erm  or replace the whole damn carpet. •701190_703890•
        I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune  ! •703890_707160•
*ALA:	Bloody hell! •707160_707310•
        It must, it must have been absolute  arm and a leg. •707310_711700•
*BAR:	Mm. •711700_711760•
*ALA:	Absolute arm and a leg. •713420_727480•
        Er   •727950_728260•
*BAR:	But it  it's not a bad size room in the sense that  •728710_732010•
*ALA:	No it int, no, it's, it is  •732010_732850•
*BAR:	in the sense that you can get three hundred in •732860_733930•
*ALA:	Mm. •733980_734110•
*BAR:	well we often get four hundred in if you're  you know, I mean, just have the right  •734110_737770•
*ALA:	Mm. •737770_737920•
*BAR:	party  erm •737920_738220•

*BAR:	Three hundred. •740140_740410•
*ALA:	Three. •740630_740730•
*BAR:	But, you can get  but a hundred people can have a decent atmosphere as well. •741060_745370•
*ALA:	Mm. •745650_746160•
*BAR:	You know, it  •746160_746540•
*ALA:	Well that, that's good you see  •746800_747800•
*BAR:	Yeah. •747890_748100•
*ALA:	cos I mean some places that are fairly big  the, if you've got hundred in they just, it looks empty don't it? •748100_752590•
*BAR:	No that's right. •752720_753130•
        That's right. •753130_753420•
        I mean  •753710_753830•
*ALA:	Erm  •753830_753920•
*BAR:	that's the Carlton's problem innit? •753920_756200•
        You know, if it, unless it gets  •756200_756860•
*ALA:	Ooh! •756860_757090•
        God! •757090_757190•
        Yeah. •757190_757360•
*BAR:	unless he's got five hundred in you feel as if you're in a barn  aircraft hanger. •757360_759940•
*ALA:	Well that's right. •760050_761200•
*BAR:	Mm. •761290_761440•
*ALA:	But the sort of chromea and all that sort of lends itself to one of them aircraft things doesn't  •761450_777010•
*BAR:	Yeah. •777460_777600•
*ALA:	it? •777600_777740•
        Yeah. •777750_777760•
*BAR:	It does. •777760_777960•
        It does, yeah. •778040_778260•
        So you wouldn't have to spend a fortune on, on, on  I mean it's only a matter of  most of it's a matter of paint, and then hanging a few things up isn't it? •778260_789800•
        Change the atmosphere. •789800_790910•
*ALA:	Well er, yeah well it is, but I think  cos one, you've got to look at, oh a bit of a design as well while you're at it you might as well just get one or two bits •790910_797590•
*BAR:	Oh yeah. •797710_797930•
        Yeah. •797930_798050•
*ALA:	you know  •798270_798590•
*BAR:	Yeah, yeah. •799000_799400•
        True. •799400_799460•
*ALA:	Erm  oh yeah. •799590_799880•
        One, two  it's alright, I'm trying to  think. •807180_814180•
        if you're gonna  make all this into a dance floor and all the rest of it what's the er er er  benefit of having a stage? •814180_832810•
        If all this is virtually gonna be  it's virtually gonna be dance floor int it really? •833510_840770•
*ALA:	Mm. •840770_840890•
*BAR:	Well there is no benefit. •841120_843360•
*ALA:	Cos if you didn't have that it'd make this room more viable  in as much as erm, the point of view of doing  doing catering  and, functions and all the rest of it. •843360_856560•
        You can't, you couldn't  say right we'll do a function for  hundred and fifty and two hundred, and really to do, you've got to be looking to do a, a sit down function for two hundred •856890_866130•
*BAR:	Right. •866210_866270•
*ALA:	if you, because  it's more than the Headway can do  •866270_869970•
*BAR:	Yeah. •869970_870370•
*ALA:	comfortably. •870370_870460•
        And it's more than  er, and you can certainly do a better job than the Carlton so  I mean, you don't call, I mean, you don't call him any  competition at all I don't  but, you've got to look at being able to do functions for two hundred. •870700_883570•
*BAR:	Mm. •883570_883650•
        Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it? •883790_887670•
*ALA:	Well it is, but having, yeah but with their  •887670_889720•
*BAR:	Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms? •889720_891120•
*ALA:	I'm talking about the Carlton. •891120_892750•
*BAR:	Right. •892850_893060•
*ALA:	Not Chelstons. •893710_894040•
*BAR:	Not Chelstons, right. •894040_894570•
*ALA:	The Carlton up  •894820_895440•
*BAR:	Right. •895440_895500•
*ALA:	here. •895500_895800•
*BAR:	Yeah. •896070_896130•
*ALA:	It, really and truthfully, like the Headway do plenty of functions and the rest of it  but  you can do a better job than Headway. •896130_900730•
*BAR:	Mm. •900730_900900•
*ALA:	No two ways about,it  in a in a . •900900_904060•
        But if you can do, if, if you can do a two hundred thing for sit down  you're gonna be in among the functions. •904190_912870•
*BAR:	Mm. •913190_913360•
*ALA:	Definitely. •913730_913860•
        Plus the fact like you er like I say, if you're gonna have a dance floor in here there int any benefit about having the raised area is there? •914880_926210•
*BAR:	No, that's very true. •926480_927650•
*ALA:	And er, and it, it  it makes a lot of difference actually. •927660_931060•
        I would have thought so. •931060_932630•
*BAR:	Mm. •933710_933900•
*ALA:	I mean, cos the bands can still set up can't they? •934010_937060•
*BAR:	Oh yeah. •937120_937470•
*ALA:	If they sit up  here  •937470_937980•
*BAR:	Well you can do what, yeah. •938110_939770•
*ALA:	Yeah. •939770_939960•
        But they still sit up there and they can still see them. •939960_942360•
*BAR:	Mm. •942360_942590•
*ALA:	And it's makes it a  it makes it a different space, totally different. •942750_947240•
*BAR:	Mm. •947270_947410•
*ALA:	And like I say, if you're gonna carpet it  er not carpet it, you're gonna cover it  you might as well cover it  totally. •947410_952770•
*BAR:	Oh yeah. •953120_953340•
        Well  •953340_953530•
*ALA:	I wonder what you'd use though? •953530_955460•
*BAR:	You you're gonna, you're gonna cover it, I mean we've got to  •955470_960510•
*ALA:	You've gotta cover that anyway. •960650_961390•
*BAR:	we've got to re-cover that  •961390_962300•
*ALA:	That's what  •962300_962620•
*BAR:	stage anyway. •962620_963010•
*ALA:	So you're not  so all you're  •963020_964500•
*BAR:	So  •964720_964790•
*ALA:	doing is taking that out, but  •964790_965410•
*BAR:	Yeah. •965410_965630•
*ALA:	surely in a lot of ways it might  makes all the difference Barry. •965630_967960•
*BAR:	Mm. •968040_968290•
*ALA:	Makes it  and it makes in a way  so that it, it's not a •968360_972310•
*BAR:	Well you can create a dance floor area with tables and chairs. •972540_975220•
*ALA:	Yeah, course you can. •975220_976250•
*BAR:	All you do is just  put them round there. •976250_977260•
*ALA:	Just put them round. •977260_977950•
*BAR:	I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House •977950_979120•
*ALA:	Well that's  terrific! •979120_979570•
*BAR:	they've got er actual  flat floors. •979570_980220•
*ALA:	Get rid of all that and you have got more table area because  they can sort of sit in in the, the  •980220_984930•
*BAR:	Yeah. •985080_985210•
*ALA:	gangway •985210_985360•
*BAR:	Yeah. •985360_985610•

        Erm  and er •100463_100540•
*BAR:	Because, I mean, if you ever got anything you really need a little, you could always bring a little stage in. •100605_101234•
