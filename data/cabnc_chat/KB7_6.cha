@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 018206)
*ANN:	How would you like that? (.) Order's not completed you've got to stay till it is. (.)  ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Up yours mate. (.) I'm going home.Ten o'clock and that's it. (.) Or whatever. (        ) 
*ANN:	Not many would. (        ) Very rare. (.) 
*STU:	Not often. (.)  ((listening to radio))
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*STU:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (.) Oh my god!
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	I had that yesterday.What's our post code?
*STU:	P E fourteen seven P G.  (.) 
*ANN:	They was looking for it on a list. ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	Said I know it's P fourteen, I don't know the rest of it.And he looked on a list he had and he put seven something.
*STU:	Seven P G. (.) I can always remember it.
*ANN:	Well you're good at remembering numbers.
*STU:	Well yeah but I just think P E fourteen, half of fourteen is seven and then T. (.)  (        ) G.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Yes darling.
*STU:	So that's how I remember it.Funny innit?
*ANN:	Yes very strange but you are strange.
*STU:	I know yes.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Very strange, yeah, very strange.
*ANN:	You always remember numbers.Don't you?Car numbers and telephone numbers and
*STU:	Car numbers I remember more by the letters than the numbers.Because there are s specific set numbers. (.) Once I see 
*ANN:	 (        ) When they come round at work and says   (.) this car blocked in I say oh go and ask Stuart he'll probably know. ((laugh)) Give you a blooming it's a blue something or other and this is the number. (        ) Go and ask  (        ) .I said go and Stuart or Bill they, they know most of them. ((laugh))  (.) I wouldn't know one from another.
*STU:	 (        ) associated the letters with the car and the letters with the car go together.And then the numbers, the numbers I don't remember that well.Some of them I do. (.)  (        ) now with them changing the   (.) the changeover cos they always used to be   (.) the letters followed by the numbers.Now they've got   (.) the initial letter   (.) followed by the number then the letters.Rather than so   (.) As I say you associate the car and the number together.
*ANN:	I don't. (        ) 
*STU:	It would probably throw me completely If you   (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	it would throw me completely if you put, if you changed some of the number plates over.If you put Tina's number plate   (.) on another car   (.) and visa versa   (.) that would throw, I I'd probably look at it and think   (.) you know, oh somebody's got a new car or that looks familiar but it's not the right car so I wouldn't think about it.Even though I know Tina's is C two one one Y C L   (.) if it was on a different car   (.) I'd probably look at it   (.) and think
*ANN:	Oh that's not right.
*STU:	it's not right, it's not Tina's.And so I wouldn't think that that   (.) I   (.) probably   (.) Just a   (.) just a trait of personality.
*ANN:	I wonder how she is if she's   (.) at work or at home. ((laugh))  (.) 
*STU:	Don't really    (.)  [laughing] don't really care to tell you the truth in a way but  [] 
*ANN:	Oh that's nice.
*STU:	Well no I care   (.) I care if Tina's not well and hope she gets better soon but   (.) I don't care if   (        ) 
*ANN:	You don't care about work getting in a muddle  ((laugh)) 
*STU:	I don't care about work and them being in a muddle, no not at all.
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (        ) 
*STU:	Let them get on with it.
*ANN:	That's not very nice.
*STU:	It is.
*ANN:	No it isn't.
*STU:	Well it is.Why isn't it?
*ANN:	Cos it isn't.
*STU:	Well
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	if   (.) a lot of others were off we'd have to cope somehow wouldn't we? (.) So   (.) there you go.Just cos we're off. (.) And possibly Tina and that is off so   (.) they'll just have to struggle on as if we were there and   (.) a lot of others were off. (.) Don't you agree?
*ANN:	Yes darling. (.) 
*STU:	Right.So what's on the agenda for today?
*ANN:	Well you know very well.We are going shopping.
*STU:	Where are we going shopping?
*ANN:	Whenever you're ready to take me shopping.
*STU:	But where   (.) are we going shopping?
*ANN:	Well   (.) probably Wisbech.No point in going to Lynn if we're going to mum's.
*STU:	No but where?
*ANN:	Wherever you wish to take me.
*STU:	Where would Ann want to go?
*ANN:	I don't mind. (.) Haven't got a lot of choice.I don't like Tescos at Wisbech cos it's  (        ) .
*STU:	Right.
*ANN:	So it's Gateway Gateway or blooming Rainbow. (.) Suppose we could go down the Rainbow and have a look at that microwave. (.) But I'll have to go into town first. (.) Cos I don't think they'll give me the shopping for nothing and there's no bank down Rainbow.Well there is, a Co-op bank but I don't think they'll let me have some money out of it.
*STU:	Mm.Maybe not.
*ANN:	And seeing as I haven't got an account with them I don't think they'll say well you can   (.) have some anyway.
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	No.
*STU:	And then we're going into town?Well we've got to go into town 
*ANN:	Got to see the estate agents and see if we can   (.) view something today.
*STU:	Mm  (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) other ones that we are   (.) definitely interested in and underneath the ones that we are   (.) not so interested in.
*STU:	Yeah   (        ) there's one down, that one down Elizabeth Terrace.I was just trying to figure out which one it is. (.) Hundred and twenty.
*ANN:	I don't know if that isn't   (.) erm what they call it who died not long ago? (.) Hazel's mum's.Cos perhaps the dad's moved out or you know  (        ) .Quite close to her. (.) Oh what was her name?Old Hazel's mother.
*STU:	Hazel's mother.
*ANN:	The little old lady who went to Salvation Army, always wearing a little hat.Oh what was her name?Cos you know her as well.And I said oh my god she's died and you said   (.) oh I know her. (.)  (        ) 
*STU:	What used to go to the Salvation Army?
*ANN:	She was   (        ) to Salvation Army.Ever so small little lady. (.) or something.I can remember her kids and I can't remember her name. (.) Terrible.Hazel and Terry, mother-in-law's brother Terry   (.) fire officer at Wisbech, it's his mother-in-law   (.) laws.And she died not more than a few months ago.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) Oh it's awful.It's dreadful I mean   (.) quite fond of her.
*STU:	Just trying to think which one it was anyway .
*ANN:	I think it's her house.
*STU:	Yeah but I'm trying think which one it is. (.) Cos I say I know that   (.) I know Elizabeth Terrace well.
*ANN:	Yeah I know cos I think you called on her cos you knew her.When she died you said   (.) oh I know her well  ((laugh)) .
*STU:	Hundred and twenty. (.) Let's go and have a look.Oh it's in here somewhere innit?
*ANN:	 (        ) I put a ring round it so I know  (.) 
*STU:	Oh yeah here we are, hundred and twenty.Ah the one   (.) one in from the end. (.) Yeah, I know the one now.One in from the end. (.) 
*ANN:	I think that is her house.Mind she had a husband but   (.) should think he   (.) living with one of the kids.
*STU:	Can't think who lived there now.God, cos I used to call on that one. (.)  (        ) perhaps. (.)  (        ) The only trouble down Elizabeth Terrace   (.) parking.
*ANN:	 (        )  (.) 
*STU:	That's the only trouble.The only consolation   (.) if
*ANN:	 (        ) the college.
*STU:	if that was a possibility   (.) or if that became a possibility   (        ) mum only live round the corner. (.) Not that far away is she?Few hundred yards.
*ANN:	She drives.
*STU:	And I could leave the car in her driveway.
*ANN:	Then there's the college.Lot of people park in the college. (.) Don't they?
*STU:	So that is a possi I was just wondering which one it was cos I say I know   (.) some of them are a bit you know
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	a bit dodgy.I knew there there they had a lot of trouble with one of them but   (.) nearer Helen's end.There was one there that was empty and   (.) for a long long while.The builders started building, knocking it about
*ANN:	And it fell to bits.
*STU:	And then it
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	and then, no the   (.) ran out of money.The builder ran out of money   (.) and the   (.) it was just a shell.You know, nothing in it.No windows no doors no nothing er you know, completely gutted it   (.) to make it all, to renovate it and then ran out of money and then it just stood there completely empty. (.) And can you imagine a house in the open air in winter?
*ANN:	Do it a lot of good would it?
*STU:	It wouldn't do it a lot of good, no exactly.
*ANN:	Woodwork and
*STU:	 (        ) exactly.
*ANN:	and even the brickwork.
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	 (        ) damp and   (.) If you get me back to mum's for about three o'clock time at the latest to take her to Osborne House.
*STU:	Well that's what she's that's what she's   (        ) she's, she just sort of she didn't mean it but
*ANN:	No it  (        ) 
*STU:	it was her thought that we were
*ANN:	Yeah cos I mean you'd probably run her back, rather than her biking. (.) As I say I mean we, if we could make an appointment say three fifteen or three thirty to see Sefton Avenue. (.) Cos we'd be up there anyway.
*STU:	Yeah. (.) 
*ANN:	Wouldn't we?Before it gets dark and you couldn't see anything anyway.
*STU:	Oh we'd have to go and have a look in the light.
*ANN:	Well that's it. (        ) 
*STU:	Definitely.
*ANN:	cos you can't see a lot.Cos there won't be electricity on.Anyway you wanna have a good look round   (        ) seriously consider it.Cos I think now we   (        ) haven't heard from Mr  and I think that means   (.) he's not prepared to take it so he's not bothered about coming. (.) Yeah?Is that the   (.) way you're reading it?
*STU:	That's the way I'm reading it.I'm  (.) 
*ANN:	Ignore it cos the man might   (.) just leave him in there renting it until or when forever it goes up.But we can't afford it to go up.
*STU:	I'm disappointed that he's not been back 
*ANN:	Yeah I am.
*STU:	to discuss it.
*ANN:	Yeah I am.
*STU:	And to put the position to him.Look the market's not very good I know but   (.) we're sitting tenants.We're quite happy to take it on.We'd like to take it on.If we leave have you got another tenant to come in?You're gonna lose two hundred and fifty pound a month.And a good two hundred and fifty pound a month.
*ANN:	Exactly.
*STU:	You know, not one that he has any hassle in getting.
*ANN:	That's it.He don't have to keep calling and wandering around after us. (        ) But I'm not prepared to go on renting it.
*STU:	No no.
*ANN:	As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off   (.) a place of our own is is just   (.) I mean if   (        ) I have to rent it well I'll have to rent one.If we can't get anything else and we can't afford anything else we've just got to go on paying it but
*STU:	But
*ANN:	when there's so much other  (        ) 
*STU:	as I say you look at   (.) I mean this is two fifty.You look here in the paper and see how much they are.
*ANN:	Yeah I know.Some of them are terrible.
*STU:	You're talking two sixty, two eighty.
*ANN:	I know.Three hundred.
*STU:	To let.Three seventy.
*ANN:	No!
*STU:	Detached four bedroomed house admittedly. (        ) Granary.Two b two two bed 
*ANN:	That's the one I fancy.If I went anywhere into another flat, I'd quite fancy going into   (        ) 
*STU:	Two bed second floor self-contained flat.Living room kitchen bathroom twelve months two seventy five unfurnished.
*ANN:	Mm I know.
*STU:	Armada Close two eighty.Norfolk Street two eighty.
*ANN:	Mm I wouldn't I wouldn't go in to Armada Close I don't think.
*STU:	That's furnished.Six months.Two eighty.
*ANN:	Yeah well you see, furnished you see they can charge extra.
*STU:	Norfolk Street   (        ) self-contained principally first floor flat, two bedrooms furnished two eighty.
*ANN:	I wouldn't want a furnished one now.
*STU:	No, of course not.But   (.) as I say 
*ANN:	I know they are expensive.Which is why I   (        ) 
*STU:	Two sixty   (        ) two eighty which is the same price as   (        ) 
*ANN:	which, which is why now er that Rose and Jean when they considered it.Mum said how about renting one in Wisbech but I said well if she can't afford a mortgage you can't afford to rent one.Not anything that's   (.) worth living in.
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	 (        ) fifty quid a week ones are er forty pound a week and so on.You gets what you pay for   (.) which nowadays isn't a lot, not for that money.You know when I asked, was gonna have   (.) er on Lynn Road there what was that fifty a   (.) fifty a week?I mean it was
*STU:	Fifty or fifty five weren't it?
*ANN:	it was   (.) clean but that's about all you could say.
*STU:	Is that the one Ann  is in now?Or in that area.
*ANN:	I don't know where Ann  is.No I think she's down Victoria Road somewhere.She won't tell anybody.But I think she lives somewhere down Victoria Road. (.) I don't know.She's only in a bedsit.
*STU:	Yeah.But I mean you see her up town though.
*ANN:	I know.That's cos she's lonely and she just wanders about.She gets up 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	don't want to stay in the bedsit.One room    (.)  (        ) she she shares a bathroom and kitchen.She just goes for a walk.I mean she's seeing people and  (.) 
*STU:	Yeah but I mean the times I've seen her it's been this end of town rather than that end of town.Which has made, which which just makes me think 
*ANN:	I don't really, I just presume she lives down Victoria Road somewhere but I don't really know.
*STU:	And she walks to work.
*ANN:	She couldn't do any other.She hasn't got a vehicle, she can't afford one.
*STU:	No no.But that just makes me think why, that's what makes me think she's living  (        ) .
*ANN:	She could be. ((clears throat)) But that weren't a bedsitter that I was in  (        ) .Shared bathroom but I 
*STU:	No   (        ) but yeah
*ANN:	but it was a kitchen and bedroom and living room.They're only tiny like an alcove bedroom but
*STU:	Oh yeah I've been in one of them.You know I've seen them.
*ANN:	I mean it was the only one with a   (.) with its own kitchen.The one that I was gonna have.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	This was right up the top and there were   (.) a tiny attic bedroom thing was made into a   (.) not very salubrious but it had a cooker and a sink.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	 ((clears throat))  (.) And as I say that was fifty or something a week and it wasn't   (.) wasn't worth it really.
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	Furniture wasn't that posh but then er but the only thing I thought about it was safe and it was clean.Needed a bit of personalizing but it was   (.) it was old-fashioned furniture but it was polished.It was clean.Had a reasonable carpet on the floor and, and so on.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	But it wasn't worth fifty pound a week. (.) Definitely not.
*STU:	But that's what they're going for though isn't it?If they can get them for that   (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) people do  (        ) .People are desperate to buy and they'll have whatever and they have to pay.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	When you think that one    (.)  (        ) what was thirty three thousand two hundred and sixty a month or something wasn't it?Well that's gonna be about two hundred and forty, two hundred and fifty a month for that one down  (        ) . ((clears throat)) Cos thirty three worked out two sixty didn't it?
*STU:	Oh the mortgage you mean?
*ANN:	Mortgage.So you can say two hundred and fifty pound a month to buy a place.
*STU:	Oh yeah.
*ANN:	And yet they want two eighty to rent one. (.) Seems quite ridiculous.
*STU:	Well that's if you're prepared to   (.) buy a flat. (.) That's the only thing isn't it?If you're prepared to buy a flat.
*ANN:	Yeah but at least you've got, actually got the property haven't you?You're not just paying somebody else to have a   (.) Cos if you're moving if you can't sell it you can always rent it again.Which is what a lot of people are doing    (        )  (.) houses especially.They buy a house cos they've had a child or something.They can't afford to   (.) they can't sell that one so they rent that out which pays the mortgage for it and start again on another mortgage.
*STU:	You've got to be a bit careful when you're renting out though.
*ANN:	Oh yes.Got to be careful of your tenants. (        ) pay.
*STU:	Tenants.
*ANN:	That's why it's best to go through an agency or er something like White and Eddies because they have people that collect them and they have people who have to take up references and  ((clears throat)) 
*STU:	Yeah but not only that but I mean if you 
*ANN:	And they have they have proper leases.I mean after that they're out and 
*STU:	Yeah  (.) .well I mean all, all well it counts towards your income as well.
*ANN:	Oh yeah I know. (.) Oh yeah income tax on it.
*STU:	Counts counts towards your income.
*ANN:	But a lot of people are doing it.
*STU:	Mm. (.) Oh I know.Well there's   (        ) for one. (        ) sell   (        ) 
*ANN:	Lot of people are doing it because they just can't   (.) well circumstances.It's either the job or something means they've gotta go away or   (.) they can't afford, they can't sell them so they    (.)  (        ) I don't know if that would make your income different if you were still paying a mortgage  (        ) .
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Even though your, all the money 
*STU:	Think   (        ) 
*ANN:	you were getting in was getting paid out again?
*STU:	I think you'll find it counts towards your income.So I mean if you had a job  (.) 
*ANN:	Paying them more tax.
*STU:	You, you got a job say you're earning 
*ANN:	But I think the expenses when you're 
*STU:	earning ten thousand a year.And you're going, you're getting two hundred and fifty pound a month   (.) as well in rent
*ANN:	Yeah but you, you'd be able to claim expenses.
*STU:	I think so, yeah.
*ANN:	You wouldn't pay the whole of it taxable if it was   (.) you know you would claim expenses for one thing and another.
*STU:	Oh I don't know but I mean I wouldn't have thought so.Yeah.
*ANN:	Otherwise   (.) probably that's why they are dear because they have to do things like that. (        ) 
*STU:	That's probably why they're the price they are, two eighty.
*ANN:	That's it.
*STU:	Because people take   (        ) 
*ANN:	Pay fifty and thirty quid a week more is a bloody what they get stopped off them. ((laugh)) 
*STU:	 (        ) and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina. (.) And to pay off the mortgage they've got to charge so much   (        ) 
*ANN:	I mean Tina's got that little house .I mean now you'd get it two hundred and fi , I mean Tina pays two hundred and forty eight er pound a week, a month.Three hundred and forty eight pound a month mortgage on that little house.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I mean that was bloody thirty nine thousand, or was it forty one when she had it.It was 
*STU:	I know.
*ANN:	forty one I think.I mean now they're going for thirty two.We can afford one like that.
*STU:	Yeah we could   (        ) isn't it?
*ANN:	Mm. (.) They don't sell now.Not selling at all.There's a few renting now cos they can't sell them. (.) So   (.) It's a nice enough little house but   (.) I'm not awfully keen on it are you?
*STU:	I don't like the, I don't like the bedroom
*ANN:	No I don't 
*STU:	situation for one.
*ANN:	If it had a door and a wall and
*STU:	You're just straight upstairs and you fall into bed.
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	Handy I suppose but
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	 [laughing] In some respects but    []  (.) I mean it just doesn't   (.) I mean in a way I suppose well with Tina being a non smoker and Wiggie being a non smoker
*ANN:	It's not so bad.
*STU:	isn't so bad but, I mean if you're like us and I mean the smoke's just 
*ANN:	That's it.That's why Tina doesn't like people smoking in her house because it gets into her bedroom.
*STU:	Yes.Exactly.The smoke would just rise straight up and
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	straight up into the bedroom.I mean she doesn't smoke anyway so I mean you know
*ANN:	She doesn't like people smoking in her house.Because she says I don't want my bedroom smelling of smoke, her sheets and   (.) everything else. (.) 
*STU:	She would do   (        ) 
*ANN:	Mind you they have done a bit more to it since Wiggie's been there in as much as she's had a big curtain put across
*STU:	Oh yeah.Across the top of the stairs like or   (        ) 
*ANN:	All the way across.Because Steve couldn't sleep.
*STU:	Because of the light in that little
*ANN:	Because it's light.See you'd even the patio door light went
*STU:	Straight upstairs.
*ANN:	straight upstairs.
*STU:	And that
*ANN:	Because he's, and then
*STU:	skylight  (        ) .Mm yeah.
*ANN:	skylight .He's had a blind put up   (.) a special blind that leads straight across the fanlight.And she's had curtains   (.) big track put across so that sh 
*STU:	She can shut it off.
*ANN:	she can shut it right off.She couldn't, she just wasn't sleeping.Said was broad daylight.
*STU:	Mhm.
*ANN:	She said oh he   (.) you know we've had all that done.Tracked across the ceiling so that   (.) shut the   (        ) off. (.) She said he just couldn't sleep in there.
*STU:	With the light.
*ANN:	With all the lights and   (.) daylight and sunshine through the bloody   (.) thing and   (.) It was alright once he got off but he had a job getting off when it was
*STU:	Mm mm.
*ANN:	as I say when it was sunlight shining through the bloody thing on his face. (.) Mm they've had a special, they had a skylight blind made .
*STU:	Mm mm.
*ANN:	They couldn't have an ordinary one cos it would hang down. (.) Has to be on a runners on the side as well otherwise it would   (.) just fall down.
*STU:	Side yeah so it   (        ) fall   (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	It's got a, you know like a frame what you put in   (.) along.
*STU:	Like a venetian blind in a way  (        ) .
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	Or a straight down blind but at an angle   (.) but er but on runners to hold, yeah.
*ANN:	But it's got runners to hold the side in you see?
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I mean   (        ) but Steven would but
*STU:	Do they owe   (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) the building society and erm
*STU:	 (        ) the building society.Yeah.
*ANN:	They'll have to pay another mortgage as well.
*STU:	Yeah but on the   (.) yeah but I mean if she   (.) sold it for thirty two   (.) she'd still owe them nine thousand wouldn't she?
*ANN:	Well she must have paid a bit off.She's been in there about three years.
*STU:	Yeah.Well say she owes them nine thousand anyway.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	But then er if they wanted another mortgage it would be
*ANN:	That would be added to it you see.
*STU:	They'd probably have a fifty thousand pound mortgage   (.) to pay off the   (.) the existing mortgage on that one and the balance.I mean they can afford it between them.
*ANN:	Well I don't know, I mean Steve must pay about eighty pounds a bloody week.
*STU:	Oh yeah of course Steven and his maintenance.Maintenance.
*ANN:	Maintenance and one thing and another.
*STU:	Yeah. (.) Yeah that would cut it down wouldn't it? (        ) on their own you can say they'd be able to afford it but if you consider the outgoings as well eighty pound a
*ANN:	Mind you saying that, three hundred fifty   (.) pound a month to buy a bigger mortgage anyway. (.) Nowadays.
*STU:	For the interest rate yeah, but it would only buy the same sort of mortgage that Tina's got on it already.
*ANN:	Yeah well that's what I mean.They could have bought, afford a
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	a a better property for about forty four thousand or whatever for the same money.Cos that's how it's worked out.
*STU:	No cos she still owes, if she sold it she'd still owe the balance between the selling price and
*ANN:	Yeah so she's got to buy a cheaper one and that would be added to it.
*STU:	That would be added to it you see.
*ANN:	Mm and just his wages how much extra they could afford.
*STU:	That's it.
*ANN:	I know Steven would like  (        ) .
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	He'd like one with a spare bedroom so the children can come and stop.I mean Tina's worried now, she's got his mother coming for christmas for a fortnight. (.) Don't know where the hell she'll sleep, she's got to sleep in the living room.
*STU:	Mm. (        )  (.) But that's about fifty   (        ) isn't it?
*ANN:	Fifty two   (        ) probably get the fifty.
*STU:	As I say you're looking at a
*ANN:	Hefty mortgage.Tina reckons out of her wages she's got ninety  (        ) , ninety six pound a week   (.) out of her wages   (.) just for mortgage and
*STU:	Expenses.
*ANN:	expenses.That's gone before she starts. (.) 
*STU:	And then out of Wiggie's he's got
*ANN:	Seventy five I think he pays. (.) It's a lot of money gone before you've even   (        ) 
*STU:	Mhm before you even start. (        )  (.) Mm.
*ANN:	Depends what you want most don't it I suppose?
*STU:	Mm mm.That's true.
*ANN:	She'd like to change the car.I mean she never liked that car.Ever.She had a nice car before Chris made her have that more or less.She didn't want it.She hated it at first, she wouldn't drive it. (.) Noisy and clumsy, she didn't like it at all.She never has really.
*STU:	It's not it's not a bad car is it?
*ANN:	She doesn't like it.Never been happy with it.Never.It was Chris's idea to have the   (.) diesel one and that model.He   (.) talked her into it.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	But   (.) she hated it at first. (.) She'd do anything rather than drive it at first. (.) I don't know what she had before but it was a
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	Mind you it was quite old.I think it was a car that she'd had for   (.) was well looked after her dad used to see to it for her but it was   (.) she'd had it for some years and she was always poodling about in you see. (.) And it was her second car that she'd ever had sort of thing.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	She'd had it five or six years or something like that. (.) You know, think it was about ten year old when she got rid of it.Something like that.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	But, say it was a lovely little car really. (.) And she hated that.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	Times she used to go   (        ) really hate it.
*STU:	 ((laugh))  (.) Yeah if that one, that Elizabeth Terrace one is, is the one I think it is   (.) which is the one fairly near the end   (.) in that in that bottom, bottom row   (.) I think the  live in the first one, they still live in the first one   (.) on the corner.I'm not sure if they've moved actually now.They may have done.Got a funny feeling they have now.But    (        )  (.) Who's that?
