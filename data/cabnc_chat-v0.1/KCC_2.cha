        They had some nice thick ones in Peacocks but they were seventeen pound  well sixteen ninety five  •640305_649065•
*CER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	and they didn't reduce them for the sale. •649065_650795•

        Oh that's for stocktaking  they said. •699645_701535•
        And we looked through the side windows and there's not a thing on the ruddy counters, it's cleared out. •703175_707155•

        It's a mess innit Cerys? •838145_841175•
        He makes more mess in his bedroom than she does  and his is because, not only is it all papers and books and toys and everything else, it's all his clothes as well. •841535_851295•
        He don't put any of his clothes away  and if he's looking for anything it's all  fling out of drawers and on the floor, he don't care. •851755_859935•
        And if I've hung his coats up once I've hung up, I've hung them up a hundred times, he's got a coat hanger on the back of the  coat hook on the back of the door  •861105_868095•
*MAR:	Well I gave him two when he stayed here to stay er to hang er on his door and he   •868095_871285•
