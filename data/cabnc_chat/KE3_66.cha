@Comment:	conversation #66 (Tape 010601)
*TON:	It's tape number four.That one's alright, this one.
*JAC:	That one start again.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) .
*TON:	Oh well.Ah    (.)  (        )  (.) 
*JAC:	 (        ) everything.
*TON:	I wonder, I wonder what they get from some people you know.Sorry.
*JAC:	Must be fun.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Cut all our naughty bits out.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) .
*TON:	That's right.I do find I'm conscious of it a lot of the time.Other people probably can forget about it cos I'm wearing it, I feel conscious of it a lot of the time.
*JAC:	I'm not, I must admit I don't think about it now, so if   (        ) wearing it puts you off.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	You know what I mean, it's taking you  (        ) .
*TON:	What I'll do when I'm, if all the if signs and buts are covered, I will put the mike on it's stand when I'm working tomorrow, put it on the desk and put the recorder in the, in my briefcase underneath the little desk
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	cos there's a little coffee table sort of thing that I put my script on
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	and put my brief case underneath it
*JAC:	You'll have to take it home.
*TON:	and the microphone on to on top.
*JAC:	Have you read it again and realised what you're supposed to do you'll have to take some spare tapes in and spend lunch times   (        ) won't you?
*TON:	Yeah, but that's, just one, I mean I'm not gonna record, if I try and record the whole of the course
*JAC:	You can't.
*TON:	I can't.
*JAC:	True, (        ) .
*TON:	That's right, but
*JAC:	Because ok, yeah stuff remains anonymous
*TON:	mm
*JAC:	but you're giving people how, how to defraud benefit.
*TON:	yeah, I can't do that.
*JAC:	Erm, so   (        ) you've got to do that.
*TON:	No, oh, a lot of the session's when they're talking about data types and things like that   (.) oh I don't know, cos there's security aspects to that you see.
*JAC:	Yeah, but then, if it's obscure that nobody apart from someone working in the office that'll understand it, does it matter?
*TON:	The only way it would matter is that somebody breathes the information to, if they could get hold of a card, and get into an office, they could actually use the information to make a payment.
*JAC:	If they knew how.
*TON:	If they knew how.
*JAC:	Mm, yeah, but be honest for what you're using, for what you've said, would they pick up that, with not having 
*TON:	Not unless .
*JAC:	a computer in front of them and being able to look at it and do what you're saying?
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	Do you know what I mean?
*TON:	Yeah, I'd, I'll have to blank it out the part when I'm talking about passwords and things as well.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Cos they're all passwords that protect the system.
*JAC:	Yeah  (.) 
*TON:	Yeah, but apart from that, you're right.
*JAC:	Yeah it's like ours we've got passwords.
*TON:	Mm   (.) yeah and then everyone's got their own, I've got my own personal one as well.
*JAC:	We've got our own personal one too, our  (        ) .
*TON:	Mm   (.) no, mines more boring than that.
*JAC:	Is it?
*TON:	My pin number.
*JAC:	Oh.
*TON:	I use my bank pin number, that way I don't forget it  ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	Oh I see that, that's how you remember, oh the other day I went to look at Asda you know, put my card in the machine and my mind just went totally blank, do you think I could remember the dam number.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	I stood there, in the end I keyed in a number which was one digit wrong
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	and I thought, it came out erm, incorrect pin number, please remove your card, I thought   (        ) at least I'm getting it back you know so I whipped it out, I said to mum, I'm gonna have to pay for this with a cheque, I said, I can't get the cash out, and she, she said why, and I said I, I forgotten my number  ((laugh)) , I was getting in quite a panic cos I knew I didn't have it written down anywhere at home.
*TON:	Yeah, mm.Do you know what it is now?
*JAC:	Yeah, I remembered it while I was walking round the shop, cos the more I yeah, the more I thought about it the worse I got when I stood by the machine.
*TON:	That's alright then.Cos I know yours, yeah, yeah
*JAC:	So I took my card and went in I thought well I'll pay for this by, by cheque
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Erm, but I wanted some cash, so what I did in the end was walked round Asda remembered it, or thought I remembered it, came back out put the erm card back in and the terminal came up erm   (.) it's ok.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) nervous now, you're gonna be checking that quite a bit.
*JAC:	Yeah the terminal came up erm, due to an error were unable to complete your transaction, so I thought oh great, so I can't have my money in any place
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	then I felt a real twit, cos a man came up and I said I think something's gone wrong with the auto bank machine, says I, it won't give me any money because it's, it's coming up there's an error, so he said well I'll try and see, he says, he put in exactly the same card as me, he had the Midland card, put it in, got his money
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	so I thought, right, I'm not going to be beaten, so I got, went back in again, put the card back in, gave me my money that time.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	But, it, it wasn't saying I'd made, made an error
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	it was saying due to an error
*TON:	There's probably some disruption to the   (.) to the transmission or something for an  (        ) .
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Cos it only needs 
*JAC:	But I felt such a twit, cos I said to this man I, I don't know about you, but I can't get my money.
*TON:	it only needs for a little bit of attention on a wire or something
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	to just make it erm, shut out just for a split second
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	and it'll throw the whole thing.
*JAC:	But that was not a good day   ((laugh)) .
*TON:	 [laughing] no   [] .
*JAC:	Oh, no I put a six where a five should be, in my pin number, that's all I did, but I just, I just stood there and my mind just completely went blank, I couldn't remember it at all.And I'd already pushed the card in
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	so I had to key in something.
*TON:	Mm, oh I  ((laugh)) , I'd turned round, I can't remember what it was   (.) oh, what was it all about?I was doing a training session and I said erm   (.) I'd, I'd started to say something and I'd done it, I was talking about something and I hadn't done the bit before
*JAC:	mm.
*TON:	so they couldn't understand what I was saying, do you know what I mean?
*JAC:	Yeah, ((clears throat)) .
*TON:	and I said   (.) erm,
*JAC:	Do you want to make  (        ) .
*TON:	forget all about that, just let your mind go blank and I look round and I said cor that was quick  ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) .
*TON:	Cos they're all looking pretty blank anyway you know.
*JAC:	Yeah, (        ) .Ooh  (.) 
*TON:	Well I don't think information about the, the seven, what are the seven conditions of receipt of benefit and things like this would be a State secret.
*JAC:	No, unemployed dirty old thing, [laughing] living in a caravan, with a big dog   [] Sorry.
*TON:	Big, hairy and stroppy, you'll get whatever you like.
*JAC:	 [laughing] yeah  [] .
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	Oh yeah, ((laugh)) , big, hairy, stroppy, dirty thing whatever you like.
*TON:	Not quite true, but
*JAC:	Go on    ((laugh))  (.) doesn't it make you sort of   (.) bias when you actually work for the system?
*TON:	Erm.
*JAC:	And you see the nice people coming in and not getting really
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	what's due to them, see somebody coming in threaten to punch somebodies lights out and they get all the
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	you know?
*TON:	But then, to my mind, the person that who, who threatens to punch the lights out and gets whatever they want, everyone should get the degree of service.
*JAC:	Yeah, but the don't, and unfortunately it's the nice people that suffer.
*TON:	No , but it's up to the every individual to try and make sure that they do get that level of service.
*JAC:	So what are, yeah but, if to get that level of service you've got to threaten somebody
*TON:	Yeah well you, you shouldn't have to threaten somebody to get good service.
*JAC:	no, but you do have to.
*TON:	You shouldn't.
*JAC:	No, but you do, in the, in the end.
*TON:	Depends on the people.
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	Depends on the actual person you see and what their attitude is.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	And I must admit once I'd been   (.) I'd, early on when I didn't know an awful lot, then, yeah, but, later on when I had been more experienced there wasn't, there was very little difference between how I treated people whether they made a fuss or not.
*JAC:	Yeah, that's right, well that's the way it should be
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	but you're in the mi minority in, in actually
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	doing that and saying that, and that's wrong.
*TON:	Mm, yeah, I'm 
*JAC:	But ,
*TON:	 (        ) trying to do something about it.
*JAC:	yeah.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	That's right, I mean the thing is you train people to do it properly
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	they then go back to their office and unfortunately a lot of what other people in the office are doing are taught
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and that I think really have more of an influence, cos they're not going to change themselves into an individual
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	by doing something different to everyone else.
*TON:	Yeah, I see what you mean.They're not in a situation where they can take an individual line at that point.
*JAC:	No.
*TON:	It's only later on when they're more experienced that they can actually say, well hang on a minute   (.) I can do more for this person   (.) and I'm going to do more for this person.
*JAC:	But I think that's the only thing were, if I worked in a benefit office I wouldn't get on very well, because if I saw something   (        ) I'd try and move heaven and earth to make   (.) everything to go right for me .
*TON:	And that, and that would make you good.
*JAC:	Yeah, but in the beginning I'd get criticized for not being quick enough in my   (        ) ,
*TON:	I don't know .
*JAC:	because I'd chase people round to find, till I found out what I wanted to know.
*TON:	Mm, yeah.
*JAC:	Do you know what I mean.
*TON:	The sort of things I'm talking about, I'm, I'm thinking of is ok somebody, a mistake's been made, somebody hasn't got their payment out
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	alright, and the difference between that is er and then the degree of service that they get, erm you can say you'll get it in the post two days in, in two days, or you can say erm, we'll get a giro cheque written out for you, initial it to you at the counter
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	at half past three   (.) or you can say   (.) if you'd like to, if you'd like to wait for half an hour, we'll get a giro cheque to, issued to you or if you'd rather you can come back at half past three and collect it.
*JAC:	Yeah, that unfortunately the majority of people say you'll get money in a couple of days, then the person would start to argue, because they need their money now to go and buy their shopping.
*TON:	Yeah, yeah   (.) and that's    (.)  (        ) degrees of service
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	I mean that, in that situation I would try and say sort of 
*JAC:	Me, I, I know .
*TON:	Do you need the money urgently?
*JAC:	Mm, and they're always going to say yes aren't they, unless they're a reasonable human being and has got a bit of money they can use .
*TON:	Yeah , yeah, only erm  (.) 
*JAC:	But I must admit, I, I am a bit snobbish in it, I would move heaven and earth to help someone who   (.) looked clean and nice and had good manners.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	If it was someone coming in with a nasty attitude really filthy, scruffy, dirty, no fixed address because they lived in er   (.) er, an old wagon some where
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I think I'd be less inclined  ((laugh)) 
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	but having said that, I'd still give them
*TON:	Only thing is dealing with the awkward people 
*CHR:	Shall I get down?
*JAC:	Yeah, yes please.
*TON:	that distinguishes a professional to somebody who isn't.
*JAC:	Oh yeah, I, I'd give them the same options but
*CHR:	Ow!
*JAC:	with someone who's nice, put it that way, I'd almost definitely try, I'd get the, say that they could have the giro today
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Straight away.With someone who's not I'd try and get them to wait for a couple of days and then if they wouldn't I'd go through the   (        ) and get them it today.
*TON:	Mm, mm.
*JAC:	Do, do you see the difference?It wouldn't be, I wouldn't say oh no you can't have it, but I'd say well you'll receive it in a couple of days time and if they said oh well that's not good enough, then fair enough, you, you know.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	But somebody who's nice I'd think no, why 
*TON:	Mm .
*JAC:	should they have to wait because   (.) but the, I, these people they are  (        ) , they've opted out of society, they want nothing to do
*TON:	They don't ,
*JAC:	with society apart from the giro cheque on paper
*TON:	yeah well they don't
*JAC:	they want
*TON:	you don't have problems with their payments.
*JAC:	no, no it's, it's the people that think the world owes them a living, but they don't want to give anything back and that really bugs me.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	You know what I mean?
*TON:	Mm, mm, yeah, I must admit I wouldn't, I agree with what you say, where I wouldn't classify those people as being of no fixed abode, they're not necessarily of no fixed abode, there are a lot of people who would, living in flats and Council houses and things like that, they've got that attitude
*JAC:	Who  (        ) .
*TON:	and some of the people who were no fixed abode, actually trying very hard to get work.
*JAC:	Mm, no, by no fixed abode I didn't mean, I did say the  (        ) .
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	It's the people that get
*TON:	No, but, even, even some of those   (.) erm the only thing is they tend to get work and they tend not to tell you they've done it  ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	No, it, no it's the one's that have opted out and they don't try to get work and they don't want work
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	those are the ones that I'd be, cos it's obvious, I mean, they've done no work in the past sort of twelve months
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	or nearly twelve months, and they're not trying because whatever people say, they do, the works there.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	You've only got to go to the Job Centre and see all the jobs.
*CHR:	Mummy.
*JAC:	I mean
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*CHR:	 (        ) .
*JAC:	Yeah, that's not bad.
*CHR:	Right, erm, mum
*JAC:	Yeah.
*CHR:	Do you know with this model, (        ) those paints   (        ) with got to get it done by this Friday  (        ) .
*JAC:	Alright, I'll try and sort something out tomorrow.
*CHR:	Ok.
*JAC:	Ok, only I haven't got time today, if we can do the   (        ) that today look, might as well get done really.
*TON:	It is, it is a bit more complicated than that,
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	in that er, some people would like to work, but the level, the amount of money they need coming in, is not in line with the amount they can realistically expect to earn, and that's a difficult situation.
*JAC:	Yeah, but then they've got to adjust their life style.
*TON:	Mm, erm, yeah, you can't adjust your life style by killing a couple of kids,
*JAC:	Oh no ,
*TON:	that's the only problem  ((laugh)) , if you've got a large family and you've had a well paid job and then you loose it
*JAC:	yeah
*TON:	erm, and you're not likely to be able to get into that line of work again
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	it, it can be quite difficult,
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	but there are, what there wasn't before, that there is now is these, erm 
*JAC:	But, then, as I say , if you've got a fam if you, if you can get a job   (.) and you, you, it's their just life style adjusting.
*TON:	well no, because what you can do know is you can go to somebody who will sit down with a mini computer and that's what you need, a mini computer and will sit down and will look at a job and will say right, if you take this job, it can also claim Family Credit of so much, and, and they actually do a, a sort of alternative benefit calculation, and what they do is they look at, if you take this job and take all the other things into account, will you be better off?
*JAC:	Mm.Mm.
*TON:	And they'll actually sit down and work that out for people and encourage them to go for a job and give them all the forms they need to claim Family Credit or whatever.
*JAC:	Well that's what I was gonna say, if the system works properly there's no way.
*TON:	But sometimes people fall through the cracks
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	and if, you can actually have somebody go, who's interested in going for a job, and when you do that sort of calculation they end up they're gonna be worse off.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	And that shouldn't be allowed to happen, but it does.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Because it doesn't su , it doesn't match the whole, there, there are holes in it .
*JAC:	Yeah, so, so what happens then if they say I'm not even going to that interview then because I couldn't live on it, even with all the other benefits, what happens then?
*TON:	Right, erm
*JAC:	See this is it, they get punished then, don't they, for not   (.) for not trying.
*TON:	Well, erm, as I understand it er calculations for   (        ) in work benefit at erm, by somebody who's separate from the normal benefit section
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	and I don't think they, they will pass on information about somebody actually refusing to take a job
*JAC:	Because of the pay.
*TON:	because of the pay.
*JAC:	Oh  (.) 
*TON:	But, the system ought to be water tight, so that people are better off
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	but the trouble is it's so complicated there are always exceptions and problems that cause
*JAC:	Yeah, but I mean, be honest, you, you say that, but people have got to be prepared to adjust as well.
*TON:	Oh yeah.
*JAC:	Because you say someone with a large family and they need a lot of money, you see someone with a large family
*TON:	Yeah, ((clears throat)) .
*JAC:	 (        ) Child Benefit or something like that
*TON:	Mm, mm.
*JAC:	and they're not given a large amount of money
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	and there's somebody else saying oh I need five hundred pounds a month more than that, to live   (.) and you think well, hang on
*TON:	Well.
*JAC:	You, know, if, if these two people with the same number of kids can live for this
*TON:	yeah
*JAC:	why should this person need five hundred pound a month more.
*TON:	What you've got to take into account is that, an all, there's an awful lot of things that you get when your unemployed that stop when you find a job.
*JAC:	Oh yeah, cos I mean I know they pay mortgage for you, well not mortgage, but interest on your mortgage.
*TON:	Interest on mortgage, yeah.
*JAC:	So you've certainly got to erm start paying the mortgage again.
*TON:	mm.Also if you're in rented accommodation you're claiming housing benefit, you'll probably haven't got to pay any rent, specially if it's Council there's relief, relief from paying 
*JAC:	Provided, if your pay is that low .
*TON:	community charge, which you don't get any more once you start working.
*JAC:	Well you do.
*TON:	Well
*JAC:	Depending on your circumstances 
*TON:	it depend, it depending on your circumstances, yeah.
*JAC:	That's what I'm saying you'll still get people who, they don't qualify for any of these benefits   (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah .
*JAC:	because of what they're earning
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	and they're still saying they're not getting enough
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	those are the people who need to adjust what, how they're living and they don't.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	They've got a big car, they've got a big house
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	you know, say to them buy a smaller house and Phrr, you know you'd never
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	never hear the end of it.
*TON:	Erm.
*JAC:	I mean it was like Deborah and Dave, can you remember?
*TON:	I believe, ah , I believe the D S S do look at the situation, but they, before, yeah ,
*JAC:	Do you remember Deborah and Dave?,
*TON:	before they actually suggest to somebody that they sell a house, that they sell a house and moved to a smaller one, they have to be unemployed for quite some time.
*JAC:	yeah, but I mean they just desperately wanted to get away from Bristol
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	because of what happened with the accident
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	what have you, and they moved from that really nice house
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	that they had
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and that was Deborah's mother's house, that was where Deborah was brought up and where I used to go and play with her when we were little
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	and of course her mum moved to Cornwall and Deborah bought the house of off her, a bit cheaper than they would have bought on the   (.) they moved down to Cornwall and they bought a much smaller house, much, much smaller.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I mean she had three or four children
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	so she's still needed, I think she bought a three bedroomed house which meant she had two girls   (.) two girls and a boy, she had three children.
*TON:	Aha.
*JAC:	No two boys and a girl, so it meant that two boys have to share a bedroom which they weren't doing in that other house   (.) and David's been unemployed well
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I say, they did just that, they sold up, moved down to Cornwall where her mum lives and bought a much smaller place.
*TON:	Yeah.D S S don't help with the mortgage, at the first I think it's ten weeks as well, but I think   (        ) help with the mortgage at all .
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Unless people are insured for that sort of period in time any way.
*JAC:	 ((clears throat)) , yeah are we?
*TON:	I don't think we are.
*JAC:	No, because of the type of job.
*TON:	Yeah.Oh, I don't know if we would be.
*JAC:	I don't know, but it's, I don't know I, it's a very difficult sort of situation where you get, there are so many things to look into, and it's not being done well enough
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	basically.
*TON:	It's very, very complicated.
*JAC:	Mm, it is, but it's still not being done well as
*TON:	There's no way it should be that complicated   (.) a lot of the problems are caused by the rules being so complicated that you have to be working in that particular field
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	with two or three years before you really know what's going on
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	and in Avon we've got erm   (.) we've got a large turn over of staff
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	people don't stay out long, so you don't get many people getting up to two or three years experience, the one's that stay on that long stay 
*JAC:	Oh yeah , they, they're very good.
*TON:	They're, and they're very good and they, they tend to stay a long time.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	But then they tend to get promoted and move on to other things.
*JAC:	Yeah, but I, I think the reason I feel a bit bitter about it is living round here, you see all the dirties and the scruffies, you get annoyed, absolute no order, they've crawled into the system right up to and doing openly in front of you
*TON:	Yeah, mm.
*JAC:	and you think well to hell with it, they should be, come down on hard.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	You, you know, you 
*TON:	Yeah ,
*JAC:	just see them all getting away with it and they makes me thing something ought to be done, which has the people that lose out or the people who go in there very politely, fill out their claim
*TON:	mm.
*JAC:	suffered at home and because of all the dirties and scruffies making a fuss they don't get attended to properly
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	and that's what makes me evil, that's why I say I'd moved heaven and earth for someone who's nice
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and   (        ) for someone who's not.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Because you know dam well that those people, the ones that are not and are making the fuss are probably the ones that lead, need the money least.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Cos er, somebody I can think off with a, not a million miles from here is working and claiming
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I know that   (.) I mean he's actually thick enough to go up there and sign on in his overalls.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Then he says, oh he's working on cars for the family, ha, ha, ha, ha.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	You know, and you, you know dam well he's, he's defrauded the system.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	When, and he'll be the one going up there shouting.Somebody like Hilary
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	that needs all the help she can get goes up there and
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	gets little   (.) You know it just doesn't seem right at all.
*TON:	Mm.Erm   (.) I wouldn't   (.) there are ten per cent, well perhaps less than ten per cent who are absolute loonies.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Erm, but an awful lot of people who would go up and make a fuss   (.) may not get this, the same level of services erm, somebody who went up there and was nice.
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	They might get less.
*JAC:	Yeah, perhaps it's just that I know some of the loonies that go up there and get what they want every time.
*TON:	Well.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) .
*TON:	The thing is you have to look at your source of information for that.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	They might think they're getting away with it, a lot of people who, who, I mean being unemployed isn't, you tend, people tend to feel devalued and so if they can think oh, they've put one over on that, on the er, benefit office, then they'll go and brag down the pub about it.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Whereas in actual fact if they come in very nicely and ask very nicely, they might have got more than they actually got here when they came in shouting and yelling.
*JAC:	Mm, yeah.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) , but then, when you come to the lunatic fringe   (.) then supervisor's will cut an awful lot of corners to prevent them busting up the office or punching somebody in the nose, a real, I don't mean people who are just stroppy, I mean the real lunatic  (        ) .
*JAC:	Yeah, yeah, big red L written on their claim.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) , I know, ha, ha, I can sue you, you take care.
*TON:	Yeah, I mean there are some virile people who are mentally sub normal.
*JAC:	Oh yeah.
*TON:	There are people who are mentally ill, for one reason or another, there are people on drugs, there are people who are alcoholics and when those people come in, in that state, you minimize the areas of confrontation.
*JAC:	So when you say to them sorry you don't get any money because they're not entitled to it what happens then?
*TON:	Well there's only one thing you can do any way.
*JAC:	Yeah.You see the   (        ) it's gonna happen eventually with all these people, there's gonna come a time where's something gonna happen that they're not gonna like
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	you know,
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	erm, as long as, cos they can only claim benefit for a certain length of time can't they?, then it switches from unemployment to Social Security .
*TON:	Income Support , yeah, but Income Support, paid indefinitely.
*JAC:	Yeah, yeah.
*TON:	And Income Support is a lot more than Unemployment Benefit anyway.
*JAC:	It is, is it?
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Oh, I didn't think it was.
*TON:	Yeah, Unemployment Benefit is only forty one quid a week.
*JAC:	Oh.
*TON:	Or sixty five if you're claiming for a wife, ((laugh)) , what good is that?
*JAC:	Well, you said what good is that, it's more than mum and dad's er pension   (.) it's more than dad's pension
*TON:	Ah, yeah.
*JAC:	and he's claimed  (        ) .
*TON:	I don't think you've got that right somehow, there's no way, that retirement pension will be less than Income Benefit, it's always a bit more.
*JAC:	Well, it works out
*TON:	that's based on National Insurance Contributions.
*JAC:	No.
*TON:	And dad's in receipt of a, in receipt of a full pension.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Right, he's getting more than sixty, sixty five quid a week.
*JAC:	Yeah, but it's not a lot more.
*TON:	Ok, it might not be a lot more, it might be seventy.
*JAC:	Mm, yeah.
*TON:	But it's always a bit more.
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	Because they
*JAC:	They ought to be a lot more that's the thing.
*TON:	because people who are signing on will er, well,pe he's, he could still claim Income Support.
*JAC:	He can't.
*TON:	He's got too much money coming in then.
*JAC:	Yeah, cos he's got a private pension of one hundred pounds a month as well.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Cos they get hardly any rent rebate now, hardly any oh, but, well, Poll Tax, they pay nineteen pounds each
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	which is practically the same as were paying.
*TON:	It is the same.
*JAC:	Yeah, ((clears throat)) , they get no relief there, no relief any where else.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I mean, I be honest I don't know how they do it, because I do know what they've got coming in
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I mean they've got their old age pension and dad's private pension and that's it.Erm, I don't know how they live, yet they always seemed to have enough money   (.) you know.
*TON:	They get help with the rent?
*JAC:	About one pound odd a week.Rene said they're twenty four pound a week.
*TON:	Yeah  (.) 
*JAC:	They get practically no help at all and yet mum still manages to sort of save a bit 
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and I think well where are they going short, because they must be.
*TON:	Mm, it's a thought, they seemed to be able to manage ok.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	I mean, were, were be in a totally different situation.
*JAC:	Yeah, but then we've got three hundred pound mortgage, which they haven't got, I mean we've got different circumstances.
*TON:	Yeah, but, we will be totally different situation .
*JAC:	Oh yeah, when , when we retire.
*TON:	Cos we'll end up with no mortgage, we'll get I don't, I don't know, if I  (.) , I must admit I rather fancy the erm, the old er   (.) the erm, a re-employed pensioner, I don't know.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*TON:	It's quite a good one.
*JAC:	What going down to E.O.
*TON:	Well I can work till I'm sixty two as an E.O.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Or Sixty as an H.E.O.
*JAC:	Would you want to?
*TON:	What, you could then do which I think would probably help, cos you see you don't get State Retirement Pension till you're sixty five
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	but what I, what would be a possibility at sixty two, when I'm at that point, I'd be receiving half pay
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	as a pension, so if I'd retired at that point, and then worked part time
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	to keep your green matter in the wear
*JAC:	Yeah, yeah.
*TON:	As an A O somewhere.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	So I'll reach State Retirement Age we can, end up with virtually full pay.
*JAC:	Yeah,
*TON:	When I've, I've got 
*JAC:	that's if I was still working.
*TON:	I'd be working part time for full pay  ((laugh)) , if you see what I mean
*JAC:	Yeah, yeah.
*TON:	and then at retirement age I would continue to receive half pay plus retirement pen State Retirement Pension
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	which be, at the equivalent of about seventy quid a week as well.
*JAC:	Yeah, I h , I honestly think though that when erm   (.) I don't know, you see, cos I, I's been saying oh when I get a chance I'll get a transfer out of my office
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	because of they way it's run
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	but they way it is at the moment, with me able to use the car for work
*TON:	Mm, mm.
*JAC:	and things, you think is it worth it because the car would be sat out here, if, if say, say I transferred and still did three days but did it when you work
*TON:	Mm, yeah
*JAC:	in the building you work in
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I wouldn't be able to use my car
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	so, I'd have to pay bus fare
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	so I'd be paying, we'd be paying for our petrol which wouldn't be a lot different to what it is now really 
*TON:	No ,
*JAC:	a bit, two or three pounds a week perhaps
*TON:	mm.
*JAC:	and I'd be paying a lot more in bus fare
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	plus you haven't got the convenience of being able to go and get in your car
*TON:	Yeah, cos standing about waiting for buses is not fun.
*JAC:	No, you know, if I could work somewhere in an office where I could use my car
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	then that would be great
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	but you'd want to be able to know that you can   (.) I don't know, I mean, I  ((sigh)) , I think, with, with the place I am now   (.) I just don't know what to make of it really
*TON:	No, I think the thing is, is once you, this is gonna sound awful, but once you've done your time and you know as much or more, then you're E O   (.) then you're gonna be left alone to get on with your job.
*JAC:	What do you mean love, we've always been left alone to get 
*TON:	Yeah ,
*JAC:	on with the job.
*TON:	what I mean is, that you're not gonna have, erm   (.) you're not gonna have interference like you had lately, ya, not gonna have comments like you had lately.
*JAC:	Huh, there'll always be 
*TON:	And , and you feel, comfortable with what you're doing, you won't have to erm, you won't have to worry about the work, if you know what I mean, you'll know how to do it.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	Once you've got that, I, I think you might well fined that it's quite nice and comfortable to stay there.
*JAC:	Yeah, well this is it, I think 
*TON:	Rather than, rather than face moving into Benefit where it is very fraught at times and in a situa , and coping with that as well as not knowing what you doing isn't nice.
*JAC:	You, you say it's very fraught in Benefit at times, I don't think you appreciate what I do,
*TON:	right, you are very busy
*JAC:	no, when you get someone's relative phoning up because they've just been crushed under a lump of machinery, that's is very fraught.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Having to deal with that person
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	why aren't you prosecuting the company because my son has just been killed
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and who has to deal with it, da da.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Not, you know, the inspector's are out, where you can't reached them on the phone.
*TON:	You've never talked about that before.
*JAC:	Oh no, no it happens.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Quite a bit.
*TON:	And that's, that's on a par with the sort of problem we get in benefit
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	and somebody comes in, Aunt Maud has just died, what do I do?
*JAC:	Yeah, yeah.
*TON:	You think, oh  ((laugh)) , and it 
*JAC:	Yeah, but , the thing is with that it's very different because, ((sigh)) , it's not your fault
*TON:	Ok, erm.
*JAC:	erm they're not coming to you and saying, my wife has been killed why aren't you doing anything about it,
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	they're coming to you and saying my wife has been killed please can you help me which is 
*TON:	My kid ,
*JAC:	is different.They're coming to you asking for help
*TON:	yeah, yeah.
*JAC:	whereas they're coming to us and blaming you
*TON:	Mm, yeah.
*JAC:	you know
*TON:	Yeah .
*JAC:	For doing nothing, which is
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	you know, if the help and safety executive had done this, this and insured that this was right and that was right
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	this wouldn't have happened.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	You know, that's a bit different to my wife has died please can you help me 
*TON:	Yeah , yeah,
*JAC:	sort things out.
*TON:	another scenario that comes up quite often is that, somebody comes in and say my kids haven't had any food all over the weekend because you didn't send out a giro  (.) 
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	that be a  (        ) 
*JAC:	Yeah, but mine   (        ) they're lying instead.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) , well you,
*JAC:	 [laughing] .
*TON:	you won't   (        ) sometimes.
*JAC:	Yes, that means
*TON:	Yeah, but
*JAC:	my kids haven't had any food all weekend that I've paid for because you didn't send me my giro, they've had their meals because they've been round there at grandma's, but I'm not telling you that, yeah, you know.
*TON:	Yeah.I went down the pub on Saturday and drank it, all the rest of my benefit.
*JAC:	Yeah, quite.
*TON:	But, that's, that's what you're faced with sometimes.
*JAC:	Yeah, I mean.
*TON:	But, yeah, I mean
*JAC:	I mean we get it as well, it's not, you so sort of say oh my jobs a cosy little job, but it's not that cosy believe me, you get put in some very awkward situations .
*TON:	no, I didn't, I didn't want to say that.
*JAC:	No.
*TON:	I didn't want to say that because I didn't, I don't think it is a cosy little job
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	especially with the management's support you get.
*JAC:	Well we don't get any.
*TON:	That's what I meant .
*JAC:	From the management we get positive hinderance not support.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) , yeah, that's what I meant.
*JAC:	I mean, my immediate management, (        ) , now in, in a crisis she's brilliant, you see, I, I don't know whether this with this the other day, whether she didn't   (.) go to see Paul to see what I'd say
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	because I'd said this, and I don't know whether she was sussing me out
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	a bit as well, cos I've, I've said that, he's said something to me   (.) and,
*TON:	Ok.
*JAC:	and I don't know whether she took me down to see him to see if I'd backed down
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and I didn't, because he said it.
*TON:	Mm, yeah.
*JAC:	And I think she was 
*TON:	No, I ,
*JAC:	quite pleased with me cos she said, don't get irate, don't get upset, and I didn't.
*TON:	no.
*JAC:	I talked him down at one point
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	cos he kept doing it to me so I did it to him.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	He wouldn't let me say something and I tried about three times and in the end I just kept talking,
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	it was a case of you stop, let  (        ) .
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	But I don't know anybody in there who hasn't had a really good shout at him at some point, and that's all, that's including A O's
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	you know, and when Ah 
*TON:	Yeah , the one thing you have got there is that people are prepared to take him on.
*JAC:	Yeah, they are, Julie will
*TON:	Mm, whereas, if you 
*JAC:	and Joyce definitely will  ((laugh)) .
*TON:	yeah, whereas if you had the situation where people weren't prepared to take him on, it could be awful
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	you have people leaving hand over fist.
*JAC:	They have now.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I mean they've got a job to keep people.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Since I've been there, they've had.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I think A.O's, they, they, the A O's tend to stay
*TON:	Does they tend to have more gumption, they tend to have to stand up to him in the end .
*JAC:	yeah .
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	But the A O's don't, they've had one, two   (.) they've had one new A A to date
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	in the twelve month's I've been there, just one, and we've had three leave.
*TON:	Yeah  (.) 
*JAC:	You know
*TON:	Yeah  (.) 
*JAC:	I, I don't know it   (.) cos he, he sort of says all this, that we, were very good to people you know, great flexibility and all this  (        ) 
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	oh yes, you get a hospital appointment then you have the time off it, that's it, they'll 
*TON:	 ((laugh)) ,
*JAC:	move heaven and earth, you know
*TON:	so what
*JAC:	so what
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*JAC:	quite.If you have a pre he's actually said to me if you have a problem I will listen and I will help you, so there's me going to him and saying look due to a misunderstanding I have a problem and this one saying tough
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	you know   (.) but it wasn't any misunderstanding either, he said something
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	and now the chips are down and I'm calling on him to do what he said, he's not prepared to
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	that's what it boils down to, there's no misunderstanding it's him.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Him, he, he wanted someone to work there desperately
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I was there, I was prepared to do it
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and he wanted me
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	so he offered me the moon to get me
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	having got me
*TON:	Yeah, he then starts trying to take it back
*JAC:	yeah, and he's not going to.
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	So .
*TON:	He didn't exactly offer you the moon anyway
*JAC:	Well no,
*TON:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	no
*TON:	But he was prepared to negotiate on something which now he's saying he didn't negotiate.
*JAC:	Yeah, that's right, what, no, he's not saying erm, he's not prepared to negotiate any more
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	he's saying he didn't say it in the first place .
*TON:	First place , yeah.
*JAC:	He's also saying, but now I have a more responsible job, therefore I have to be in   (        ) time, five minutes after him, not good enough.
*TON:	Mm, yeah.
*JAC:	You know   (.) and, as I say with my partner   (.) I haven't mentioned it yet, this business about cover
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	but it annoys me that, why, you see, I'm, I'm asking for cover for technical half an hour in the morning
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Possibly fifty five minutes.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Somebody has to cover our group from half past three till five
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	during the week.
*TON:	Well that's not   (        ) time, so it doesn't matter.
*JAC:	No, when your partner 
*TON:	This,
*JAC:	goes home early 
*TON:	it's, it's a question it's not a question of cover, and it's not a question of erm efficiency it's a question of small mindedness.
*JAC:	Yes, luckily he's gonna look at all my flexi  (        ) .
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	The one that's been really bad, is the one that I'm still doing, they can't see that.
*TON:	Ah, right.Yeah.
*JAC:	I looked at the other day and I was thinking oh god, I want to go to sleep a couple of days last, you know
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	five minutes, ten minutes, and I was thinking erm, (        ) the car broke down
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	well that's all the sheet I'm doing now
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	so he won't see that one.
*TON:	No.
