*CHA:	 Mummy   
*RON:	 Well  we got to   (  ) and there's   (.) three weeks   (.) well when we came up at the beginning of May there was a notice on the main main twenty one which said

*RON:	 and as we're  right up towards the end and now after the bank holiday we've had lovely fine weather anyway, we got off to the main road and turned   (.) at Fibwell traffic lights onto the A twenty one and we got the to end of the dual carriageway onto the tail end of the queue as it started into the road works   (.) so I just went over the central reservation and went back down the dual carriageway to the traffic lights at 
*RON:	Fibwell and turned right went through Tyse   
*RON:	Tysehurst to Wothurst round the north side of 
*RON:	Bule reservoir to come out at Lamberhurst in the village   (.) so I sort of circled it

*CAR:	Oh well   (.) you got here 
*RON:	but in the middle of all that of course there were numerous little bits of temporary traffic lights at roadworks which
