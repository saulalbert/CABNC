*GIL:	Southend airport to get it done.
*NAN:	Really?
*GIL:	Yeah.
*NAN:	You look like somebody I know there, (        ) 
*GIL:	I love the way that pass both passports are sealed together, look at the seal, I think it's brilliant. (.) Well look in the insi on the inside of the front cover, no the inside of the other cover   (.) no of   (.) that one  (.) 
*NAN:	Oh. (.) Oh yeah   (.) ooh really nice, it's real authentic isn't it?
*GIL:	Really British, I'm pissed off about the European passports

*GIL:	That's Dave's birthday, thirteenth of June.
*NAN:	Really? (.) Have you got any stamps?
*JEM:	No cos I only got it this summer cos my other one was nicked, my other one which had all my really nice visas in it, which I was really   (        ) 
*GIL:	I ordered mine from Nigeria.And a few others.I love that passport.This passport is just fucking excellent, I love it.
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Well yeah, just because of the   (.) stamps in it and stuff, like real memories and s things.
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Oh shit you've lost yours totally?
*JEM:	Yeah it was nicked.Stolen.Gone.
*GIL:	Oh you would have thought though they'd send it back.Do you know what I mean?I mean that's so stupid not to send it back.
*NAN:	Where was it stolen from?
*JEM:	Well these, these these are the kind of people who nicked my address book which was sitting on my seat and which looked quite nice which wasn't in my bag, they nicked that. (.) 
*NAN:	Where was it stolen from?
*GIL:	But that's so pointless cos it's got all the addresses, your addresses in it.
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	It's such a tossy, you sure it wasn't in the bag?
*JEM:	Yeah I'm absolutely positive, I remember leaving it on the seat.It was stolen from my car, my car was broken into   (        )  (.) 
*GIL:	How long did you actually leave the er   (.) how long were you away from the car for?
*JEM:	Erm well it happened some time between about   (.) two and six  (        ) 
*GIL:	It was a bit silly to leave your bag on the front seat though.
*JEM:	Yeah but we were sitting in a er we were in a cul-de-sac in a nice area
*GIL:	Yeah you don't think do you?You don't think at all.Mind you, my mum was telling me, on Christmas day, right, Christmas day!Erm   (.) you know that Georgian house on my road on th my side of the road, up the road?Looks way out of place.Well not as way out of place as a British Telecom building would look but, it looks quite   [laughing] erm looks quite out of place  [] , but erm this massive great obnoxious Georgian building   (.) erm   (.) was broken into on Christmas morning right?They picked the lock   [laughing] on the house, the front fucking door  [] .All the people were in bed in the house, woke up in the morning, the front door was wide open, the video and T V had gone, and the stereo. (.) And so they pi they we came into the house when everyone was asleep.That would freak me out so much, you just wouldn't feel safe in your house ever again would you?Cos equally a rapist could pick the lock and come in and, and   (.) do you know what I mean?Er you'd just feel   (.) I couldn't believe that, thought fucking hell.So my dad's having all the locks changed. ((laugh)) Stepped up the security in our house.Outrageous.
*NAN:	 (        ) stepdad?
*GIL:	No stepped up the security   [laughing] in the house  [] .
*NAN:	 [laughing] Oh  [] 
*GIL:	Hey Nance, Nance, Nance, Nance, you know you were telling me that you thought someone had died   (.) at work? (.) I, I   [laughing] sort of heard   [] Debbie and Chris talking the other day, and I might have got it totally mixed up, but I reckon, I heard Chris saying   (.) that, well basically what I gathered was that Andy might have a different father to Chris and it was Andy's father that's died, right?Cos Chris was saying things like oh his, yeah he's been to the funeral and erm he's all of a sudden found that he's got loads of cousins he didn't even know about.
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*JEM:	What, so he did, he didn't   (        ) 
*GIL:	But I wonder if I wonder if Chris and Andy, cos Chris and Andy's half brother is Steven who's Debbie's husband, I'm wondering if they knew that   (.) they had different fathers.Cos they don't call each other they're half brothers. (.) 
*NAN:	Maybe   (.) yeah.Well Andy's, look how Andy's got ginger hair.
*GIL:	Mm.Chris is dark and sort of like totally, doesn't look anything like Andy.Not even one similarity.Totally like
*JEM:	And what, they're supposed to be half brothers are they?
*GIL:	No they're supposed to be brothers.
*NAN:	But I reckon they've probably lived like brothers from a young age.Cos look how much 
*GIL:	Yeah, oh yeah.
*NAN:	older Chris is than Andy as well. (.) Well he isn't that much but he's a good nine years.Nine, ten, eleven years older than Andy.
*GIL:	So maybe they did know. (.) 
*NAN:	Yeah I reckon they did.
*GIL:	And just sort of like did, just called people 
*NAN:	Or Andy may er Andy, Andy may be adopted or something like that.
*GIL:	Yeah maybe.But it's just strange that Steven's called their half brother and they're called brothers.Do you know what I mean?
*NAN:	Well maybe, yeah, but maybe Steven   (.) is er is a half brother through a third marriage erm   (.) at a later stage to when they   (.) his mum er they're er Chris' mum may have remarried, who Andy calls mum, erm remarried when Andy was   (.) you know, fifteen and Chris was twenty five and then they, and Steve was o old as well, Steve was quite   (.) however o however how old Steve is, he   (        ) 
*GIL:	So then he'd be a stepbrother.
*NAN:	Oh. (        ) mixed up.
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) Maybe we don't know.Maybe we're just gossiping. ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	Maybe we're just damn fucking nosy.
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	It was funny cos I could hear them talking and I was really sort of like
*NAN:	So obviously then, I reckon it must be his dad   (.) and that's obviously why Andy   (        ) saying oh look your dad's died   (        ) 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*NAN:	Cos Chris doesn't seem that bothered really, does he?Maybe he wouldn't know him.
*GIL:	Mm.Maybe Andy didn't know him. (.) And he just went because it was   (.) his father's funeral. (.) But then why would he have to go to the morgue for an identification, he wouldn't know what he looked like. (.) Maybe he's next of kin. (.)  ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 (        )  ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 [laughing] Stop it  [] . (        ) 
*GIL:	Aren't we nosy though?Aren't I nosy I mean. (.) 
*NAN:	I better go  (        ) 
*JEM:	Right, good luck.
*NAN:	Yeah. (        ) 
*GIL:	You bloody lay into them.
*NAN:	Yeah I will, I'm gonna stand my ground. (.) Yeah, definitely.
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*NAN:	I will, yeah.Well it is, it's money innit, we're talking about now?
*GIL:	Don't forget about the deposit.
*NAN:	Yeah, right.
*GIL:	 [mimicking] Yeah, right  [] . ((laugh))  (.) I love this song. (.) I haven't listened to it for ages. (.) 
*JEM:	 (        ) what I've nicked today?
*GIL:	Oh yeah.
*JEM:	Not bad eh?
*GIL:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*JEM:	Well
*GIL:	 [singing] He said I'm not fighting for you any more and the queen as she seen his face some days before   []  (.) 
*JEM:	Jane wants me to send her a postcard. (.) 
*GIL:	 [singing] up here on the hill   [] 
*JEM:	 (        ) lot of people I work with actually.
*GIL:	Who er so who's this Jane person then?
*JEM:	Jane's like another   (        ) she's really nice   (        ) 
*GIL:	Who you just got on with.

*NAN:	I'll be back soon   (        ) hour and a half   (        ) relax   (        )

*GIL:	I put south.But it's not Jersey, Jersey is all 
*JEM:	No.

*JEM:	Well it's not, it's just like   (.) er I dunno, I can't do it. (        )

*JEM:	Erm  (.) 
*GIL:	 [singing] and you are never revealed   (.) on your battle field    []  (.) would be to erm phone up Trailfinders   (.) or S T A, I think I might've asked S T A, and find out which would be the best card, which would be the best card to have.
*JEM:	Right.
*GIL:	You know whether it'd be Visa, Access or whatever. (.)  [singing] as an honest man    []  (.) You know some time we've got to decide what we're gonna do when, as soon as we get to Thailand and where we wanna go first.Cos we won't wanna stay in Bangkok for that long.
