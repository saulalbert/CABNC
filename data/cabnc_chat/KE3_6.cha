@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 010206)
*JAC:	No, it's not I thought it was a bit thin. ((laugh)) 
*REN:	Ah mm   (.) Oh she thinks she's nice and thin   (.) Thank you very much.
*TON:	Your welcome.
*JAC:	Okay.
*REN:	I'll see you tomorrow night then?
*JAC:	Okay then.
*REN:	 (        ) 
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) worst luck.
*REN:	Cheerio   (.) cheerio Christine.
*CHR:	Bye.
*JAC:	Bye. (.) Bye.
*REN:	Oh cr 
*CHR:	Mum, would you just sit up there with the bike   (.) like a twist bike.
*TON:	Hurry up.
*CHR:	Put the radio on now.
*JAC:	Can I put the radio on?
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*TON:	I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that I'd never driven in the dark before.
*JAC:	Well yeah, it's bound to throw you, I mean its 
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	it's the first time you drove in the dark was on your driving test   (.) wasn't it?
*TON:	Yeah   (.) I must admit I think that a little bit erm
*JAC:	It was unfortunate
*TON:	Yeah
*JAC:	but it was  (        ) .
*TON:	I suppose I could have er   (.) looking at 
*JAC:	Was it as dark as this? (.)  (        ) .
*TON:	By the time I'd finished, yes   (.) it was pitch dark.
*JAC:	Well the only thing you can do is hopefully your next test isn't at the same time   (.) make it a 
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	different time.
*TON:	But in any event it would be a good idea if I had some tests   (.) some lessons in the dark.
*JAC:	Might be   (.) I mean ask Brian, see 
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	what he can do because
*TON:	Yeah
*JAC:	I mean I knew   (.) the first day I drove in the dark was the first night we had the car and it was most odd experience
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I mean   (.) first day 
*TON:	I found it 
*JAC:	driving a brand new car and then
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	driving in the dark for the first time, ha.
*TON:	Yeah   (.) I'd find it quite difficult   (.) well I could see the headlights   (.) coming up   (.) and I was thinking   (.) now how fast is that car coming up   (.) I don't really know.
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) and the thing is also being   (.) new to driving you tend to look at the headlights rather than look away from them.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	And that doesn't help because   (.) I don't know, it wasn't, I don't think you'd find it was as dark as this.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Not at four o' clock, its not quite that dark at
*TON:	 ((cough)) 
*JAC:	half past, yeah
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	but not this dark at four, not yet.
*TON:	Well he had to switch on the interior light to be able to fill out the form.
*JAC:	Oh yeah, it's pretty dark but not 
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	it's not black like this.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	Are you, what are you doing tomorrow, are you coming in with me?
*TON:	Erm   (.) yeah.
*JAC:	Friday.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Good.
*TON:	I'm coming with you   (.) I've got to do er   (.) I've gotta do some prep 
*JAC:	it's nice to have someone to talk to.
*TON:	 ((laugh))  (.) Yeah, but you may be recorded.
*JAC:	 (        ) I don't care.
*TON:	 ((laugh))  (.) Oh.
*JAC:	Nice chap.
*TON:	Where did he come from?
*JAC:	He came out of the Harvester but it would have been nice if he'd waited   [laughing] for there to be a gap in the traffic  [] .
*TON:	 ((laugh))  (.) Yeah.
*JAC:	If you see what I mean.
*TON:	Yeah   (.) Oh he wasn't gonna wait 
*JAC:	 (        ) . ((laugh)) 
*TON:	either. ((laugh)) 
*TON:	Oh dear.
*JAC:	Ah   (.) it's gonna be one of those nights tonight  (        ) .
*TON:	Yeah I think so   (.) I must admit from one point of view   (.) I'm quite glad that I   (.) haven't   (.) passed   (.) cos 
*JAC:	Why?
*TON:	it's a bad   (.) as you said it's a bad time to start driving now there's an awful lot of
*JAC:	Idiots come out.
*TON:	idiots on the road   (.) especially coming 
*JAC:	last 
*TON:	up to Christmas
*JAC:	Yeah, last Christmas was a real eye opener to me, cos the Christmas before
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	I didn't drive very much cos my Dad was still so bad I only did 
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	the essential journeys
*TON:	Mhm.
*JAC:	and I mean I then I'd only just had my operation an  (.) and to actually   (.) drive   (.) for longer than about   (.) twenty minute journeys was killing   (.) so 
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I only drove over to to do the shopping and to pick Christine up from School.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	That was all.
*TON:	Yeah you're right I look at the headlights.
*JAC:	Yeah you must do you see you've got to 
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	look   (.) if you've got to concentrate on anything, concentrate on the white line or
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	the kerb   (.) certainly the white line if you can
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	cos if you concentrate on the kerb you tend to drive a bit too close to it
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and also it's not always there for you to see easily
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	whereas the white line is   (.) But if you look into the headlights it can be   (.) not dark   (.) erm but   (.) it appears to be dark because
*TON:	Well your pupils re erm
*JAC:	they react into the headlights.
*TON:	react into the headlights, yeah   (.) so it makes it seem darker.
*JAC:	And you've gotta be careful as well at night not to hang on to the tail lights of the thing in from of you
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	cos it's very easy to do it because they're two little red beacons
*TON:	Yes.
*JAC:	you know you've still got to look ahead
*TON:	Yes.
*JAC:	and concentrate on what's happening
*TON:	Yes.
*JAC:	further up the road.
*TON:	There was one point during my test when I was driving along and erm   (.) the I was creeping forward in a stream of traffic and the person in front of me had crossed the solid white line at some traffic lights   (.) and the lights changed and it would have been very easy to follow his lights and just carry on
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	but I didn't I stopped   ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	But you see it every day   (.) I mean
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	You know I've had it happen the lights have changed just as I've been crossing them so I've gone over and three cars immediately behind me have followed me.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	We're gonna have to get a tyre gauge I reckon   (.) they've got a new depth of tread   (.) one point six millimetres which is bigger than the.
