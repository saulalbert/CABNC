*MAR:	Unemployed. •242925_247225•
*TON:	Unemployed. •247225_252225•
*UNK:	Unemployed. •252225_256325•
*TON:	Yeah. •258825_259425•
        So people who are unemployed  can claim income support. •259425_303725•
        Any other people apart from people who are unemployed that can claim income support? •352525_392625•
*MUM:	Those on low incomes? •399325_408525•
*TON:	Low income, yes. •414525_423525•
        Anyone else? •423525_476925•
*MUM:	Training courses. •484725_491625•
*TON:	Training courses. •511425_518225•
*MUM:	You know? •518225_519725•
        Like U T and •520925_537425•
*TON:	Right. •537425_539425•
        They're actually paid a training allowance, which is related to income support. •540425_591925•
        But it isn't their income support. •602825_620125•
*MUM:	Mm. •620125_620725•
*TON:	So anything  anyone else who might receive  income support? •648525_699325•
*REN:	Old age pensioners. •703325_709725•
*TON:	Pensioners. •715325_720225•
        Yes. •723625_725425•
        Anyone else? •798825_804025•
*VIC:	If you're disabled? •807625_816125•
*TON:	Erm  yes but they normally receive their erm •825825_869325•
*VIC:	Disability allowance. •869325_874225•
*TON:	their own benefits. •874225_888525•
        Yes related to disability. •888525_905425•
        But yes they can if they don't receive enough from other means. •911225_959325•
        Yeah. •975725_979725•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	Yes. •979725_980825•
*REN:	It's what the government  •991025_100212•
*DOT:	Think I heard that one   That's quite an old one  •100212_110682•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	There's •113462_113792•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	No it's alright. •113792_116492•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	There's erm  there's one other erm  group of people that might be able to claim •116912_122712•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*REN:	One parent families. •122842_124042•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah. •124042_124392•
        Single parents. •124392_125252•
        That's another very common one. •125252_127042•
        Yep. •127162_127332•
        Single parents. •127412_128112•
        Right. •128112_128782•
        So what factors decide what you get under income, income support? •128922_144752•
*UNK:	Your income I suppose.? •144942_148102•
*TON:	Erm  •160562_161042•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*REN:	means tested. •162202_163422•
*TON:	Yeah, yeah. •163632_164402•
        So looking at somebody's needs  and what are the sort of things they're likely to take into account? •165542_172542•
*REN:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah  •172542_172662•
*VIC:	How many there are in the family. •174502_176442•
*TON:	Income. •176442_176702•
        Er  how many in the family? •179532_182522•
        Yes. •182832_182982•
        Number of  •183482_184082•
*UNK:	Number of children. •184512_185212•
*TON:	Number of children. •188892_190122•
*MUM:	Is that opposed to the number of adults  •190122_194372•
*TON:	Erm •194372_194432•
*MUM:	as well as. •194752_•
*TON:	As well as. •195282_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Financial commitments. •201902_203352•
*TON:	Financial commitments. •203442_204712•
*UNK:	Mortgage   •205112_205662•
*UNK:	Housing  •209482_209662•
*TON:	Yes. •209762_209902•
        Mortgage will  They will help with the mortgage. •209902_211202•
        What happens about rent? •211762_213102•
*DOT:	Get some housing benefit. •214042_214982•
*TON:	Yeah. •215442_215622•
        They can claim housing benefit. •215772_217122•
        That isn't income support, that's another benefit that they claim from the Local Authority. •218132_222192•
        So if they're in rented accommodation then they will need to make a claim to a Local Authority for that. •224012_229782•
        What other things might D S S take into account? •229782_233012•
*REN:	Poll tax. •233012_233772•
*DOT:	Savings. •233772_234122•
*TON:	Er  savings. •234952_236382•
        You mentioned poll tax. •242342_243672•
        Erm another, another thing you can claim is relief from paying poll tax. •243962_250232•
        So it's not directly linked with income support. •250792_253962•
        You claim relief from the people who collect poll tax. •254422_257072•
        But the fact you are claiming income support is a factor that they look at. •258422_262362•
        So if you were  in receipt of income support then you don't have to pay very much. •263272_267242•
*REN:	So who are these people then that you  get relief from if you want help with your poll tax? •267242_273102•
*TON:	Right. •273432_273642•
        You would claim that from your Local Authority. •274162_276242•
        In the same way as housing benefit. •276602_278762•
*REN:	You've got housing benefit forms  •278762_281382•
*TON:	Yeah. •284272_284332•
        Yeah. •284332_284392•
        Okay? •284392_284622•
        Savings. •285012_285862•
        Erm  something else that would relate to number of children, adults is also the age. •286332_294662•
        The ages of the people in the house. •295912_298132•
*MUM:	What, just of the children, or of the adults as well? •298712_300582•
*TON:	Well  once they're over eighteen age is immaterial. •301312_304442•
*MUM:	Oh. •305792_305872•
        Right. •305872_305982•
*TON:	But erm there, there are a couple of different rates at which er income support is claimed depending on how old the child is. •306162_313812•
*MUM:	Oh really? •313942_314102•
*TON:	Yeah. •314822_314892•
*DOT:	What about the other er end of the scale? •315082_318012•
        Somebody over sixty five or seventy five or eighty   •318612_320502•
*TON:	Right. •320772_320982•
        As I understand it there's no no banding at that end. •321132_324152•
*DOT:	That's strange isn't it? •324962_325672•
        Because there's a lot of erm pensions that are triggered off by the age of the elderly person. •325672_332302•
*TON:	Mm. •332302_332362•
*MAR:	Of course there, there are things, I mean there is the pension. •332672_334352•
        There is also attendance allowance and there are various things like that which are  outside this. •334962_340102•
*TON:	Mm. •340102_340172•
        Yeah. •340832_340952•
        But they will take into account any special help that is needed for somebody who's disabled. •341462_346122•
*DOT:	Washing. •348242_348422•
        Extra, extra money for if they've got lots of washing to do. •348632_351552•
*TON:	So you can get special help if somebody's disabled. •362982_366052•
        Oh you're right. •369242_370722•
        There's a pension  as well. •370822_371472•
*DOT:	Yeah. •372902_373072•
*TON:	Yes. •373072_373162•
        Yes. •373782_373902•
        Sorry. •374232_374522•
*DOT:	That's alright. •375372_378132•
*TON:	Right. •379062_379182•
        So. •379682_379982•
        Let's have a look  has , has anyone not seen erm B one? •380262_387762•
*UNK:	No I haven't. •388402_389892•
*UNK:	I'm not really  •389902_391902•
*TON:	Right. •393532_393692•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Well  I've only seen the back of it. •394242_397012•
        I've never looked right through it. •397012_398512•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	So how, how many do we need? •398512_403292•
*UNK:	All, all  •403292_403992•
*TON:	You have a look between the two  •403992_416442•
*UNK:	You've been reading B one's all week. •416442_420532•
*UNK:	Have I? •420872_421292•
*UNK:	You've been reading B one's for weeks haven't you? •421292_423132•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Right. •425942_426212•
        Your rate of allowances aren't there because they go out of date so fast so I've got an extra, you can have one of these each  with the rate of allowances. •426212_446862•
*UNK:	Thanks. •446992_447432•
*TON:	And there's also  you may or may not have  the erm form which you claim relief for community charge and housing benefit  inside the form. •451102_472532•
*REN:	You have to have another one if you're in , if you're not in council accommodation from the which we issue as well. •472612_483062•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*REN:	. •_•
        You get so much stuff from the N C A's who do that. •484242_489282•
        The N C A's who do  •489282_490882•
*TON:	Right. •490892_490902•
        So  can I wipe this side off. •491042_495982•
*MUM:	Ooh. •495982_496132•
        That's not fair is it? •496132_498502•
        If you're eighteen to twenty four years old and you're bringing up a child on your own. •498852_508012•
        You get the same as twenty five years and older. •513332_515972•
*TON:	Right. •516142_516292•
        So if we look at a  a typical family. •516292_520062•
        We have  wife and husband both over eighteen. •520062_524972•
        Both over eighteen. •525852_527392•
        How much would they get? •534942_537622•
*MUM:	Sixty two twenty five? •537622_540702•
*TON:	That's it. •541732_543892•
        Sixty two pounds twenty five. •544182_545512•
        Okay? •545562_545802•
        Now if they had a child who's four years old, how much would they get? •545802_558162•
*UNK:	Thirteen thirty five. •558162_558672•
*TON:	Thirteen thirty five. •560372_562092•
*UNK:	For each child. •563232_564162•
*TON:	Okay? •565202_565272•
        And then another child who is  sixteen. •567092_574882•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Right. •576242_576522•
        That's right. •576522_578312•
        So. •584342_584482•
        What about if they're fourteen? •584492_590612•
*UNK:	Nineteen seventy five. •590612_591242•
*TON:	Nineteen seventy five. •594152_595722•
        There you go. •596072_597362•
        And in addition to that there is a premium because they are a family. •598022_607372•
        And the premium because they have at least one child is seven pounds ninety nine, ninety five. •607372_613432•
*MAR:	So even if you had six children, you'd still allowed, still only get seven ninety five? •613562_625592•
*TON:	That's right. •627122_627912•
        In addition to the  •629672_629812•
*UNK:	Yeah •629812_630262•
*TON:	Yeah, yeah. •630262_630742•
        Okay? •632122_632322•
*REN:	I doubt if you'd have six children under four would you? •632452_640662•
*MAR:	You could have I suppose   •640662_641632•
*REN:	Oh well  . •641632_641982•
        Going back to what Jerry said you'd  •641982_644722•
*TON:	So. •644932_645232•
        You've got a total income coming in, er a total amount of benefit there of a hundred and three pounds thirty  for this family. •645232_655772•
        Okay? •659922_660102•
        Now  they will also be entitled to child benefit. •660102_668122•
        Okay? •668162_668262•
        So child benefit  for two children it's ninety twenty five for the first. •668292_678072•
        Seven twenty five for the second. •678592_681412•
        So that sixteen pounds fifty. •681692_684212•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	What are those rates again? •684212_688592•
        Nine twenty five first, and seven  twenty five   •691212_695012•
*TON:	It's not  •695012_695762•
*UNK:	Ah. •695792_695992•
        Sneaky peaky eh? •696002_697282•
*TON:	So the, for the oldest child it's nine pounds twenty five. •697392_702622•
        Sorry it's not on there. •702712_704262•
*UNK:	No   •704262_704402•
*MAR:	What is it? •704522_705312•
        Ten pounds twenty five? •706062_707112•
*TON:	Nine twenty five for the first child. •707112_709502•
        And then seven pounds twenty five for  subsequent children. •709602_714782•
        Making sixteen pounds fifty in total. •714782_717122•
        This would then be treated as income by D S S and so this amount would be reduced by sixteen pounds fifty. •717122_729982•
*REN:	That's a con innit? •730082_743442•
*UNK:	Mm. •743522_743772•
*TON:	I make that eighty six eighty? •745482_749982•
        Yeah? •749982_750202•
*UNK:	Mm. •750202_750512•
*TON:	Now that's an idea to how they do it. •750512_769072•
        Don't try to counsel somebody and tell them how much income support they're going to get. •769072_775942•
        Because that's very very basic. •775942_777922•
        There are lots and lots of other things the D S S can take into account. •777982_782532•
*REN:	Leave it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau. •782532_785432•
*TON:	Yeah. •785442_785452•
        Leave it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau or the D S S. •785452_788622•
*REN:	I feel sorry for the D S S cos the Citizen's Advice Bureau  to make sure that the people get all they're entitled to  •788622_796692•
*UNK:	Mm •796702_796712•
*REN:	The Citizen's Advice Bureau has got a pro forma which if a person goes in and says  I think I ought to be getting, I think I, I don't think I'm getting sufficient income support or I'm going to apply for income support. •796712_812992•
        What should I get? •812992_814062•
        And they go through and tell them what they should get. •814222_816532•
*UNK:	Mm? •816782_816932•
*REN:	Which I would find very trying if I was in the D S S quite honestly. •816932_821132•
*UNK:	Yeah. •821132_821192•
*TON:	Right. •821422_821562•
        Now  so having issued B one, where's it got to go? •821562_832582•
*UNK:	The D S S. •832582_833082•
*TON:	Right. •834472_834552•
        So it goes to the D S S. •834652_836752•
        Which one? •836752_837122•
*UNK:	The one nearest . •837122_837852•
*UNK:	The one in the area which in they live. •837852_842202•
*TON:	So it's not specifically related to the benefit office where they're signing. •842202_846422•
        It's based on where they live. •846612_848042•
        And so you might find that some offices have to think of two or three  D S S offices and refer various people to the, to various ones. •848042_859392•
        Depending on where they live. •865482_867072•
        Okay? •867132_867232•
        Now when you had that bundle of handouts that are all stapled together   •867232_872052•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	There was  a list of the D S S offices  together with guidance on their address. •872052_881782•
        Now if I can check that you've all got that. •882922_885052•
        I you haven't, I've got a list here that I can let you have. •885052_889092•
        It looks like that. •890142_893052•
        and then if you come across it later. •893052_924132•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	I was just wondering that. •924132_939402•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Or is it  it is in fact North Radstock isn't it? •939582_944252•
        . The actual town is North Radstock. •945372_949862•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Okay. •949862_949952•
        Any question so far? •952212_968432•
*REN:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Okay? •968432_968852•
        Right so when do you issue a B one? •968852_980162•
*UNK:	At fresh claims. •980162_980682•
        Change of circumstances. •983032_983842•
*REN:	Fresh claims. •984272_984652•
*TON:	Fresh claims. •984692_986512•
        Er what do you mean by change of circumstances? •987832_993292•
*REN:	If they change their address or something or they live with somebody else or they  move out from somewhere  •993292_999002•
*TON:	Yeah. •999002_999232•
        Erm  change of  let's say person's circumstances. •999342_100819•
        It might be limiting with a change of address it might not. •100819_101412•
        Yeah? •101412_101427•
        Any  •101427_101439•
*UNK:	Also when they run out of U B. •101468_101790•
*TON:	When they run out of U B. •101790_101954•
        Yes. •101954_101967•
        Any other times when you might issue one? •101967_103098•
        Erm  situation where you have somebody  who has left their job. •103098_105738•
        Wasn't clear at the time what the circumstances were. •105756_106028•
        You may find when you have the reply back from the employer that you have to suspend unemployment benefit. •106028_106530•
        In that instance you could issue a B one so that he would have some money coming in. •106554_107301•
        So  if unemployment benefit is suspended  and erm another circumstance which might arise is somebody  expects to receive unemployment benefit and then finds that they're not entitled to it. •107301_109744•
        Because of contribution problems. •109810_109839•
*REN:	If in doubt •109858_110085•
*TON:	Yes. •110115_110139•
*REN:	always give a B one in my opinion. •110323_110566•
*TON:	Yes. •110582_110595•
        That's right. •110614_110673•
        They may  the only thing is they may not wish to take one. •110748_111053•
        You don't have to, you don't have to claim. •111053_111350•
        And they may say no no I don't want to claim. •111351_111707•
        In which case that's fair enough. •111708_111913•
        But at some future time they may decide they want to. •111918_112769•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*REN:	If a person refuses U B. •112769_112904•
        They should take  you should issue them with a leaflet  •112904_113301•
*TON:	Sorry? •113321_113332•
        Refuses U B? •113332_113405•
*REN:	Issues  refuses I S •113520_113665•
*TON:	Mhm •113665_113680•
*REN:	You should issue them with the basic leaflet telling them about I S. •113680_113951•
*TON:	Mhm. •113962_113971•
*REN:	So that they're aware of what they've refused. •113998_114272•
*TON:	That's a very good  er very good precaution to take, yes. •114272_114588•
        Very good idea. •114629_114967•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*REN:	I don't normally. •114972_115486•
        But  you can do . •115486_115831•
        Well yes you can but  if anyone refuses U B er I S rather I always give them a leaflet. •115858_116361•
        so that you are sure I'm not conning you. •116640_116795•
*TON:	So before we issue  before we hand over the B one what do we do? •116796_117443•
*REN:	Fill in the back. •117443_117482•
*TON:	We fill in the back. •117482_117722•
        Yes? •117732_117744•
        .We'll be giving you some exercises later about filling in the back. •117744_118453•
        Erm •118460_118487•
*UNK:	Who would do this then. •118504_118734•
        I mean it wouldn't just be  anyone could do this, fill out the back it doesn't have to be an E O does it? •118773_119811•
*TON:	No, no it doesn't have to be an E O. •119814_120157•
        Right. •120157_120174•
        Erm the only thing is  what does happen occasionally is somebody comes from the D S S offices and they've been told, I need a B one. •120174_120997•
        What they haven't been told is that you actually have to make a claim for benefit. •120997_121366•
        And have to sign on every fortnight. •121368_121593•
*REN:	every day . •121593_121658•
        It happens every day. •121658_121741•
        Every day. •121751_121795•
*TON:	And  yes. •121805_121895•
        And, and so then they, they're a bit miffed that instead of the B one they're being asked to complete a U B four six one, a U B six seven one. •121930_122864•
        They then have to come to an appointment and be interviewed. •122864_123101•
        Whereas in actual fact I don't want all this, I want is a B one. •123110_123532•
        But they have to make a claim before you can issue a B one. •123559_123928•
*UNK:	And the D S S can't issue B ones unless they've gone through all the procedure. •123928_124319•
*TON:	That's right. •124334_124388•
        In fact D S S don't issue B ones. •124388_124612•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	We, we have to issue B ones. •124613_125453•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*REN:	Because they have new people on the counter and it's it's  •125606_125979•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	Good question. •125979_125995•
*REN:	It happens every single day . •126015_126297•
        Go down and get a B one  •126297_126712•
*TON:	How long does it take for income support to come through? •126712_127431•
        Once a claim has been made. •127431_127790•
*UNK:	According to the managers five and a half days in this area. •127844_128107•
*TON:	How long is a piece of string? •128107_128172•
        Five and a half days? •128172_128322•
*REN:	They can get it immediately. •128361_128440•
        get it immediately  •128440_128494•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	That's what I was quoted last week. •128494_128989•
*TON:	Right. •129149_129159•
*UNK:	When I asked the self-same question. •129169_129353•
        He said five and a half days. •129353_129819•
        He hasn't . •129819_129838•
*REN:	The last time  •129838_129883•
*TON:	I, I would I would have thought it could have, could take, it could easily take ten days. •129954_130234•
*UNK:	Yeah Two weeks. •130239_130323•
*MAR:	Two weeks. •130323_130503•
*REN:	When they had problems not so long ago it was taking a month. •130503_130746•
*UNK:	Yeah. •130746_130754•
        I heard it was six weeks. •130754_130829•
*REN:	A month, six weeks. •130829_130990•
*UNK:	Well they have targets like we all have and one of their targets is how quickly they can turn around the claimant's money. •131013_132165•
*TON:	Mm. •132180_132189•
*UNK:	What does a  claimant do then they've got no money then for six weeks if it takes six weeks. •132189_132532•
*UNK:	Come and bang on our door for six weeks. •132547_132877•
*REN:	They get, I think they can  •132877_132986•
*UNK:	Yeah •132986_132997•
*TON:	They can get a crisis loan. •132997_133504•
        They don't, they can also get paid early direct by the D S S. •133512_134028•
        D S S will actually pay them rather than telling us to pay them. •134038_134581•
*UNK:	But is it up to them to actually go to D S S and say I want a payment now? •134581_135068•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	That's right. •135068_135103•
        So if you get someone in that situation who's saying I'm desperate for money, I'm claiming income support, I've heard nothing  and you haven't been told how much they're entitled to. •135103_136247•
        Then they can actually go to the D S S office and say that they need some money urgently and D S S may make a payment. •136247_137026•
*UNK:	But may but not  •137026_137150•
*REN:	May  •137386_137405•
*UNK:	May not. •137443_137520•
*TON:	Yeah. •137520_137532•
        It depends on the circumstances and you're not, you're not in a position to say  what D S S will or won't do. •137532_138234•
        So you can only say they may make a payment. •138234_138537•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	under er  I think they would do under most circumstances. •138559_139195•
        It would only be if they suspected that something  odd was going on. •139195_139612•
        Okay and how do D S S tell us how much to pay  income support? •139675_141015•
*UNK:	B two. •141015_141058•
*TON:	Yep. •141072_141078•
        B two. •141118_141163•
        Right. •141275_141285•
        Before I ask you to complete B one there's one more thing we need to talk about. •141345_142254•
        And that is about what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord. •142254_142885•
        So what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord, what happens to their unemployment benefit. •142885_143677•
*UNK:	Suspended. •143677_143706•
*REN:	Suspended pending enquiries. •143706_143760•
*TON:	Yeah. •143760_143782•
*REN:	But not, it's suspended, it's suspended but it's not disallowed. •143890_144461•
*TON:	That's right. •144521_144559•
        So what, what's the difference? •144627_144867•
*REN:	Well it's suspended pending enquiries so it's in suspension. •144867_145251•
        They, we're looking into the reasons. •145251_145457•
        And if erm  they don't like the outcome of our deliberations they have a right of appeal. •145458_146255•
*TON:	Right. •146255_146271•
        But when, when the adjudication officer has made a decision  he will then allow or disallow. •146286_146863•
        So that that's the  so at first the claim is suspended. •146913_147349•
        And then when you have a decision from the adjudication officer it is then allowed or disallowed. •147349_147932•
*UNK:	And then they can appeal. •147932_148019•
*TON:	And then they can appeal. •148019_148081•
*UNK:	If they wish. •148315_148350•
*TON:	Yeah. •148350_148359•
*UNK:	It used to be six months didn't it, and now it's gone up to  •148359_148666•
*TON:	That's right, yes. •148820_148853•
*UNK:	Big jump isn't it? •148889_148975•
*TON:	Well. •148982_148993•
        It went up in stages. •148993_149247•
*UNK:	Oh did it? •149259_149299•
*TON:	It went to thirteen weeks and then it went to twenty six weeks. •149299_149487•
*UNK:	Did it? •149487_149594•
*TON:	Yeah. •149619_149634•
*REN:	As a deterrent. •149647_149697•
        Which it never has had any effect on  at all. •149708_149993•
        That was the reason behind it. •150071_150296•
        It was a, a deterrent to people giving up their jobs but nobody knew about it. •150314_150776•
        People don't know about it now. •150776_150874•
*MAR:	So if they immediately fall back on IS, I mean it •150875_151300•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah that's just what I was going to say. •151311_151789•
        What happens then, to income support? •151789_151880•
*UNK:	Paid at a reduced rate. •151880_152046•
*TON:	It's paid at a reduced rate  for the period of the suspension. •152113_152981•
*UNK:	I thought if it's disqualifying, if you were disqualified then  income support pays normal  •153234_153687•
*REN:	No. •153687_153696•
*TON:	Sorry it's, it's, if it's allowed they would have a reason  income support to pay. •153696_153943•
        If it's disallowed  then erm they would have their entitlement in that they would be paid a reduced rate during the period of the , er of the disallowance. •153959_155296•
*UNK:	And would they still get the income support after that but still at a reduced rate or not? •155587_155895•
*TON:	Right. •155899_155934•
        Once we're out of the twenty six week period it would go back to its normal rate. •155934_156453•
*UNK:	I think we're talking about  once the suspension was over •156453_156862•
*UNK:	Yeah •156923_156933•
*UNK:	and the the A O has made the decision. •156946_157328•
        disallowed •157339_157350•
*TON:	Mhm. •157350_157359•
*UNK:	they'd carry on getting the reduced rate prior to the period of disallowance. •157359_157749•
*TON:	That's right yes. •157749_157892•
*UNK:	They'd still get paid then? •157898_157982•
*TON:	Yes, but at a reduced   reduced rate. •157982_158223•
*UNK:	What is the reduced rate. •158223_158418•
*TON:	I'm sorry. •158418_158468•
        I'll go on to talk about that . •158495_158629•
*REN:	Is there a handout on this because •158629_158911•
*TON:	Right. •158918_158951•
        I've got a handout on the reduced rate, yes. •159066_159225•
        And I'm gonna be giving you a handout which gives you information about how to calculate it. •159267_160146•
*REN:	I never tell people getting a reduced rate  •160296_160765•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*REN:	Well no because they just go bananas if you do. •160797_161006•
        You've got to be careful. •161006_161137•
*TON:	What, what do we call that  reduction, deduction? •161147_161390•
*REN:	U D •161395_161436•
*TON:	Right. •161465_161528•
        Yep. •161554_161606•
        I don't know if you've heard that term at all around. •161637_162397•
        What does it stand for? •162406_162771•
*MAR:	The  deduction. •162771_162796•
*TON:	Yep. •162796_162829•
        oh. •162878_162884•
        Let's try that again. •163110_163779•
        Unemployed  deduction. •164057_164072•
        Okay? •164278_164306•
        Details of any reductions that have been made are held in enquiry screen four. •164403_167216•
        The reduction is made on the personal rate available. •167226_168450•
        So in this instance it would be made on half, if, if the husband had left his job of his own accord  it would be made on half of that amount. •168491_169902•
*UNK:	Surely that's  for his wife as well so she  •169902_170935•
*REN:	No  •170935_170949•
*TON:	No no no. •170975_171262•
        No that's why it would only be  it would be made  your deduction would be made on half of that amount. •171262_171857•

*UNK:	Oh I see. •171869_171954•
*TON:	No, no. •171957_172007•
        The deduction is based on •172145_172225•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	The deduction isn't half that amount •172252_172604•
*TON:	No. •172615_172633•
*UNK:	it's made on half that amount. •172634_172867•
*TON:	It's, yeah. •172896_173029•
        And it is forty percent of that. •173049_173290•

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yes. •177721_177753•
        It's made on the amount that that person, that individual is receiving in income support. •177773_178553•
        It's not on the whole family. •178603_178885•

*TON:	Yeah. •180994_181017•
        It's about twelve pounds a week. •181160_181323•
*REN:	What happens if you, if you're not on that rate  •181323_181886•
*UNK:	What if you're a single person only getting thirty nine something? •181887_182261•
*REN:	Then you  doesn't need much does he. •182274_182615•
*UNK:	But do you get the reduced rate, is it reduced forty percent for all sort of categories whether you're married, single? •182616_183456•
*TON:	Yes, yes. •183470_183492•
*REN:	I thought there were exceptions if the person was pregnant or something. •183493_183961•
        If there's a pregnant person in the house. •183977_184174•
*TON:	Yes. •184178_184206•
        There are exceptions. •184215_184292•
        So that the  majority of people will be subject to a  forty percent deduction  on their personal benefit  and their personal rate. •184393_186080•
        Okay? •186101_186125•
*UNK:	That's irrespective whether they're married or single? •186341_186556•
*TON:	That's right. •186708_186920•
        Erm  the deduction will only made, be made  if a suspension is held on our computer. •187372_188477•
        So if somebody forgets to put the suspension on •188477_188971•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*REN:	It's not actually cos it causes real problems . •189031_189328•
        In other words it can take  doing that person no good service  like if there's any doubt  suspending it immediately. •189328_190375•
        They can always get the arrears. •190396_190867•
        And they get very uptight if they get erm  too much and then it's reduced rather than the other way round. •190867_191825•
*TON:	Mm. •191825_191834•
*UNK:	Can I  ask ? •191834_191857•
*TON:	Yeah. •191857_191869•
*UNK:	queries at the end. •191869_191985•
*TON:	No. •192241_192253•
        No that's fine. •192305_192560•
*UNK:	I'm still a bit confused about erm  sorry I should have brought this up at the time. •192583_192990•
*TON:	It's alright. •192990_193011•
*UNK:	Claims suspended for twenty six weeks by our good selves •193011_193420•
*TON:	Yes. •193430_193442•
*UNK:	therefore if they apply for income support •193457_193585•
*TON:	Mhm •193657_193664•
*UNK:	that is also reduced by forty percent. •193664_193804•
*TON:	Yeah. •193850_193869•
*UNK:	Right. •193869_193890•
        What if they're unemployment benefit was disqualified? •193980_194576•
        The adjudication officer, we suspend it, the adjudication officer says  right, they're not supposed to have it. •194577_195444•
        What happens to their income support, do they still continue to receive it at a reduced rate? •195491_196024•
*TON:	That's right. •196024_196059•
        For the period of the disallowance. •196059_196170•
        And it would then revert back to full rate. •196194_196676•
*UNK:	And the disallowance can be •196778_197580•
*REN:	Up to twenty six weeks. •197593_197675•
*TON:	Yeah. •197766_197780•
*UNK:	thank you. •197806_197827•
*TON:	Okay? •197838_197850•
        Right. •197854_197867•
        Erm  the  some people can actually have a reduction made of twenty percent instead. •197931_199750•
        If, in this family the wife was expecting a baby  then  then it would be a twenty percent deduction. •199750_202218•
        Also if one or other of the partners, well it would have to be the partner that wasn't signing  was seriously ill  then the deduction would be twenty percent. •202218_204680•
        Providing  there's a condition attached, that they have savings of less than two hundred pounds. •205374_206204•
*UNK:	What if the claimant should become seriously ill? •206204_206294•
*REN:	sick. •206294_206303•
*UNK:	Sick  •206303_206318•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Do they get a reduced rate  on the sickness benefit? •206318_209557•
*UNK:	No •209557_209569•
*UNK:	No  They get more on sickness benefit than they do on  •209660_210188•
*REN:	And another thing  if you're living with somebody  and, and you're both unemployed. •210188_210596•
        If the person that's got the sack doesn't make the claim but the other person claims then it doesn't affect them either. •210596_211580•
        If you see what I mean. •211581_212153•
*UNK:	Oh I see  so er  you're assuming then that the person that was claiming  isn't working? •212153_212583•
*REN:	Wasn't, wasn't. •212597_212663•
        Isn't working but hasn't had the sack. •212663_212893•
        Perhaps they've been made redundant. •212894_212985•
        Perhaps their partner's had the sack. •212986_213234•
        If the  person  that has had, been made redundant to make the claim, can claim for the other person and there's no  •213235_214018•
*UNK:	dependent, yeah. •214116_214128•
*REN:	Yeah so there's no reduction on that. •214128_214253•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*UNK:	suspension  for three hundred and twelve days. •214253_216849•
        very often find knowing that they've left voluntarily to have babies and have decided not to go back to the job although the job's been kept open for them. •216958_218459•
        They're disallowed for six months and then coming and  •218468_218814•
*TON:	Right. •218814_218820•
        I hope this doesn't cause you a problem, but the rates of benefit have changed  very slightly since the first of October ninety one. •218848_220133•
        And the handout I've got here which I couldn't tie in just now when I was trying to do the deduction is because the rates are very slightly different. •220133_221038•
        It's about thirty pence or so more. •221038_221532•
        Than actually what we were talking about. •221581_222207•
        So I'm sorry about that. •222207_222740•
        I'll get the other one updated. •222741_223489•
        Erm but what you've got now  if you, can I pass those round and I'll explain what that says. •223579_224189•
*UNK:	Is this one the same as we've got in that erm wad again? •224189_224433•
*TON:	Oh you had one in the wad did you? •224449_224639•
*UNK:	Yes I had one, yeah  else did but I •224682_225114•
*REN:	In the one that we shouldn't have had which we did have. •225255_225462•
*TON:	Oh it's been a good week. •225527_226011•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Right. •226033_226044•
        If you'd have a look at that. •226044_226138•
        The appendix age twenty  the  category which you can see there, nought to four. •226138_227215•
        That tells you the amount of income support which the er for which the deduction is appropriate. •227215_228075•
*UNK:	Hang on a minute. •228104_229145•
        Are we looking at  •229152_229477•
*UNK:	No, we're looking at page two, yeah. •229547_231051•
*UNK:	Right. •231066_231079•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*REN:	I've got April ninety one here. •231098_231243•
*TON:	Right  some are April, some of October and they're all mixed up. •231246_231706•
*UNK:	I'm April •231737_231879•
*TON:	Wonderful. •231898_231913•
*UNK:	I'm October. •231914_232018•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Okay, October  you want, you want, anyone else need  October   •232032_232759•
*UNK:	Yes please   •232776_232821•
*TON:	And if you please destroy the other one. •232949_235337•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah, that's the latest one. •235337_235477•
        Right  Okay have a look at that. •235705_235871•
        The B U category  nought to four. •235883_235993•
        That shows the amount  of weekly rate to which the  can be applied. •235993_236437•
        So that shows how much we're gonna apply our deduction to. •236449_236882•
        Okay? •236882_236908•
        And we can see the rates for which the deduction is going to be applied  the other side. •236908_238154•
        So erm a single under eighteen or couple both under eighteen twenty three pound ninety. •238264_238770•
        That , that should relate to the allowances you had before. •238783_239322•
*REN:	And that's  so that's twelve fifty five if it's  •239366_240093•
*TON:	So if a forty percent deduction is made on category two, then somebody receiving thirty one pounds forty a week  would actually, it would actually be reduced by twelve pounds fifty five. •240093_241971•
        Do you see how that works? •241983_242433•
*UNK:	Mm. •242433_242444•
*UNK:	No sorry. •242444_242476•
        I've lose where that twelve fifty five comes from. •242595_242746•
*TON:	Right. •242791_242800•
        If you look at category two. •242820_242920•
*UNK:	What here? •242920_243001•
*TON:	Yeah. •243001_243012•
*UNK:	Yeah right. •243148_243192•
*TON:	They're in receipt of thirty one pounds forty? •243192_243426•
*UNK:	Yeah. •243426_243448•
*TON:	So if you look at category two down below. •243448_243652•
        Forty percent deduction applied for a full week. •243653_243944•
        Twelve pound fifty five. •243944_244001•
*UNK:	Oh right, twelve fifty five yeah. •244017_244175•
        Mhm. •244175_244193•
        Yeah okay. •244225_244275•
*TON:	Okay? •244275_244290•
        So the B U category shows the amount of income support that er is being, that the deduction is being based on. •244299_245820•
        And then the B U indicator  indicates whether it's rate one or rate two and indicates whether it's a twenty percent or forty percent deduction. •245824_247054•
        Now right at the beginning of a claim you can have an odd number of days before the first benefit week ending day. •247066_248102•
        There will also be an indicator on the B two to say how those days should be treated. •248112_248795•
        There will be a number which will be the number, should be the number of days before the benefit week ending day in the first week of the claim. •248852_249783•
        Right. •249832_249838•
        Any questions on that? •250292_251060•
*UNK:	Well only one and that is •251093_251616•
*TON:	Mhm? •251616_251622•
*UNK:	you've given us this information. •251638_251870•
*TON:	Right. •251988_252002•
*UNK:	But  don't tell them  what they're likely to receive. •252002_253397•
*TON:	Yes. •253397_253412•
*UNK:	So the information that is given us is for our information only, or? •253471_253672•
*TON:	Right. •253798_253824•
        You can go so far as to say that  I mean, you will be safe in saying that if your, that as your benefit is suspended  your income support for you, not for your family but for you, will be reduced. •253910_255082•
        It will probably be reduced by forty percent. •255082_255358•
        .. Yeah? •255379_255392•
*UNK:	Yeah. •255452_255464•
*REN:	But if you, if you look at a B two  it makes sense, I mean I've looked at B two's and I haven't really understood what the one's two's and three's are for but now it makes sense to me so people who are  B two  makes more sense to them to know what  •255654_257440•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah. •257440_257452•
        We'll be having a look at some B two's and we'll pick up this bit about  and er the coding when you have a look at that. •257452_258637•
*UNK:	It's knowing how much information you can supply and how much you keep out isn't it? •258685_260506•
*TON:	Yes. •260993_261009•
        Yes that's right. •261058_261135•

*TON:	Yes this, this one, this new one  ought to get it retyped. •266491_267801•
*REN:	It's quite an important one really. •267801_268657•
*TON:	Mm, yeah. •268657_268704•
*REN:	I'm using it all the time. •268719_268988•
*TON:	I've got better copies of the blank B one, but the handout is getting rather  Right so if we're looking at, we'll complete the B one. •268988_273545•

*TON:	Well hopefully all this will give you the address although it depends how far away it is.  contact D S S to get the address. •278706_280084•
