*TON:	Oh  I've got a horrible feeling I've forgotten to put the milk in the fridge. •802522_806642•
*JAC:	Well we'll have a sniff at it and see what it's like. •809142_811642•
*TON:	No we won't. •811642_811882•
*JAC:	Why? •811882_811942•
*TON:	I'm talking about the milk that's in the training room. •811942_815452•
*JAC:	Oh  has it ever occurred to you  to take a bottle of milk in from home  save going out to buy it? •815872_826702•
*TON:	Erm •826702_826972•
*JAC:	Do you think  they  •826972_828502•
*TON:	well it's cartons •828502_829342•
*JAC:	ah. •830532_830582•
*TON:	and they're easier to get rid of  I'd have to bring bottles home again wouldn't I? •830752_835422•
*JAC:	Well yeah I suppose you would. •835422_842142•
*TON:	And I get the money back. •844052_845462•
