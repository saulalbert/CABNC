*LOR:	Masters again, yeah. •140573_140768•
*CHE:	What do you mean masters? •140768_140969•
*LOR:	Mastered to get into the race. •141026_141156•
        Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and initiative and you're in! •141382_141741•
*CHE:	I bet, I bet  he's scared  •141896_142123•
*LOR:	I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's  for security guards. •142123_142434•
        You cannot walk past them if  you're going in that way. •142590_143026•
        So we had to go  past this little shed which is right up  right up this stupid grass earthy bank  right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in. •143026_144082•
        Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great  hole in the gate  massive! •144108_144723•
        Walked through there and got to the simulator  took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in  walked straight past and we were right on site! •144723_145556•
        We wasn't aware it was there. •145574_145718•
        Well I thought, saved us twenty quid! •145816_146000•
*CHE:	So all  ? •146136_146185•
*LOR:	We were going , we were in! •146228_146377•
        We're in! •146397_146467•
        We're in! •146480_146497•
        Pretty good! •146497_146528•
*CHE:	So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really? •146593_146984•
        Eh? •146984_147019•
        All that  •147028_147117•
*LOR:	And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so •147117_147745•
*CHE:	Have you got to pass for the stage then? •147944_148136•
*LOR:	Yeah. •148136_148145•
        I used an  •148145_148281•
*CHE:	What  •148356_148371•
*LOR:	old one. •148371_148393•
        So  those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine  turned mine round she saw it and went  she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't  thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't  just turned it round on her. •148393_150158•
*CHE:	I bet your  friends will be  sick then, won't they? •150158_150534•
*LOR:	I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one! •150552_151520•
        And there must have been about ten thousand there last time. •151520_152049•
        They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in  and you can spin round. •152049_153233•
*CHE:	Oh yeah! •153233_153251•
*LOR:	They had one of those in there  but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on! •153251_154065•

*CHE:	Velcro walls? •154303_154347•
*LOR:	No, they didn't have that there. •154498_155585•

        Video screens. •156761_156800•
