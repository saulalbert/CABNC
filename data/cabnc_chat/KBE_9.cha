@Comment:	conversation #9 (Tape 009109)
*JUL:	It looks like it's a really deep cut by looking at it now.It's sort of like open there.All it was first of all was a little graze on top of the skin.
*BET:	Mm.
*JUL:	Because where I was making boxes it was pulling the skin and was torn apart wasn't it?
*BET:	Yeah it kept going there all the time.They do though don't it? (.) 
*JUL:	So the other day last week I was bleeding  (        ) 
*BET:	Was you?
*JUL:	Yeah I cut myself.And erm the next day I had er it was all white there
*BET:	Was it?
*JUL:	and I took every little last bit out.But I never noticed it er
*BET:	Serious.
*JUL:	It was not funny because what I did.I was cleaning out knives and the metal thing that goes over the knives there was something there and it was a nail and I just pushed and I caught it.So I took a nick out of my finger and ended up with   (        ) from the top of my finger.
*BET:	Mm.Nasty. (        )  (.) 
*JUL:	 (        ) blood enough goes over my fingers   (        ) cut his thumb and and all he did was just sort of bathed it put   (        ) on it.It was a deep cut   (        ) and ended up   (        ) 
*BET:	 (        ) 
*JUL:	And a good cover up job.It didn't make it heal just good stuff   (        )  ((laugh)) 
*JUL:	And she was mhm
*BET:	Mm.Yeah!
*JUL:	 ((laugh)) She was had on a full stomach.She had to do it before she ate anything. (.) She said most of it was it wasn't the actual looking at the hole it was that she was hurting him   (.) pushing it in.
*BET:	Mm.
*JUL:	And it weren't hurting him at all but it was making her feel sick thinking that she was hurting him like.
