*BRE:	Mm. 
*UNK:	that's what she was, she was doing    (  )  .

*BRE:	 yeah   
*UNK:	where you went for a walk, down, went to the shops 
*BRE:	mm. 
*UNK:	or whatever, just let them know roughly what you're doing, cos, all they get is a tape, it gives them an idea of what sort of things were happening at that time, any words they can't pick up   (  ) if she's cooking, maybe that's something she was making or whatever, erm, in the   (  ) please write the first names and details, why you know them, of all the people speaking on this side of the tape, in order in which they speak on the tape in the first, first instance, right, you know, so now Carla, my husband, myself, Lee and, you don't need to repeat them again after that 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*UNK:	so if you don't, don't want, not worried too much about this, I mean, although we want you to do this, I mean, rather just get the conversation, in, even though you don't  do this  . 
*BRE:	 You want more than that  . 
*CAR:	The knob on the cooker's been turned. 
*BRE:	Put it in the dish.
