*MAR:	I don't really, I don't really
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Alan Ball admitted his men had it all to do after his men crashed to South Africa, the Australian wicket went for a duck as a defending champion slumped said we are going to have to do it the hard way now, we just didn't play very, we didn't get it together against New Zealand in the first match and today we were never in the picture, our brothers never really had a chance of any attempt of a hundred and seventy, but full credit to South Africa they are a rate, a better to side

*TER:	look at that a hundred and seventy one for one
*MAR:	Mm

*MAR:	Oh they're the favourites apparently, the kids they, they have it now
*TER:	That's right they are, well England, England next, but even so you see that's erm, that's in, that's incredible
*MAR:	Mind you when England come against South Africa let's hope they
*GRO:	 (        )  (.) 
*TER:	Of course if anything happened to us tomorrow or tonight because we play West Indies tonight  (.)
