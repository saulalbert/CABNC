*DAV:	Eh, you can see where the   (        ) was there.
*CHR:	Yep.
*DAV:	Probably somewhere round here, must be.
*CHR:	Other side? (        ) .
*DAV:	Got to be this side.
*CHR:	Right.Fine.
*DAV:	Not a very accurate  (        ) .
*CHR:	No.
*DAV:	 (        ) .One of the problems was really was  (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yep.
*DAV:	I've already   (        ) so I've had it.
*CHR:	Oh bad luck.
*DAV:	Yes.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	So I've  (        ) , well what I can do is go down there.Unfortunately that's right in the way. ((hits ball))I've got a continuation shot, well what I shall do is just try and line them up for a rush down to  (        ) , which is not bad.
*CHR:	No.Fine.
*DAV:	O K.
*CHR:	O K.
*DAV:	I think probably that red
*CHR:	Yes, back down here again?
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes I have, yes.
*DAV:	Erm, take  (        ) .
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	But it's still best to remove the temptation here.
*DAV:	Yeah, it would.
*CHR:	Right, right.
*DAV:	 (        ) down here. (        ) .
*CHR:	Right, O K.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	So what, what most people do, is when they bring the mallets back, they tend to twist them.
*CHR:	Aha.Yes.
*DAV:	It's easy when you're pushing forward to keep it straight, it's when you bring it back it tends to twist.
*CHR:	Surely.
*DAV:	So try and concentrate on bringing it back and then, bring, I mean, you can bring it back fairly slowly.
*CHR:	Alright, oh fine, yes. ((hits ball))
*DAV:	Very good, it's nice to see you hitting a ball like that.
*CHR:	Yes, it felt good too.
*DAV:	Yes.
*CHR:	You could actually feel it working well.
*DAV:	Yes, you brought the mallet back nice and slowly.
*CHR:	And I was aiming between them to be honest. ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	You obviously could of got  (        ) .
*CHR:	O K, I should, yes.
*DAV:	Erm, you can always stop and ask.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	The trouble is you can make, there's a lot of people, it's very easy when you're concentrating on what you're going to do next, you forget the colour you're playing.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	Especially when you're making a break, so having made the  (        ) .
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	So you know you're playing with red.
*CHR:	I see, yes.
*DAV:	Cos don't forget you're playing with two balls.
*CHR:	Quite.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Eh, the danger is, if you don't, then, break down, if you leave my blue near the er black break down then I'm just going to get back in.
*CHR:	Yes, yes.
*DAV:	So, with, if a very difficult shot, what what I'll do is just  (        ) .Let's just do a  (        ) .
*CHR:	To, to, not necessarily to hit the black, but to
*DAV:	No not necessarily.
*CHR:	Right, O K, (        ) .
