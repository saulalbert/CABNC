*WEN:	Well you'll have to decide I mean you  •834215_835695•

*BEV:	erm, that chunky one •844385_847345•

*WEN:	Mm •858145_858215•
*BEV:	so •858515_858575•
*WEN:	Mm •858575_858635•

*WEN:	terrific amount •861535_862035•
*BEV:	a terrific •862235_862885•
*WEN:	mm •862885_862945•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	cos it has two bands of rib •863265_865925•

*BEV:	that's what I don't want for it to er •883045_885005•
*WEN:	Yeah •885005_885105•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	crinkle too quickly •885445_885915•

*BEV:	Oh yeah  •890275_890375•
*WEN:	so really that's not a problem •890375_895975•

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	ha, ha, I bet you will, it won't take that long to unpick it though  but I mean you've got a, quite a selection there to choose haven't you? •903615_912525•
*BEV:	Yeah, oh if I can undo that one then I can do the sleeve •912835_918285•
*WEN:	Mm •918875_918935•
*BEV:	cos that'll be quite •919535_920805•
*WEN:	Mm? •921535_921595•
*BEV:	that will be quite intricate •921595_922485•
*WEN:	Yeah, not much bigger job anyway, innit? •923945_928015•
*BEV:	Yeah •928015_928075•
*WEN:	Well I'll look, I'll see how much of that plum is left •929635_931355•
*BEV:	I think there's quite a lot of plum and •931355_933715•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	you can't use that much can you? •935495_936735•
*BEV:	I think it was two balls •936735_938465•
*WEN:	Plenty then innit? •940805_941915•
        For that and  •942435_942745•
*BEV:	and you've got two, well what was in them? •942745_946105•
        You would of got two cos you would of been a big one won't you? •947185_950675•
        Just that colour •950675_951195•
*WEN:	That's right, but I mean all I want it for is the erm •951195_954485•
*BEV:	Body •955005_955135•
*WEN:	the body and use the black •955135_957465•
*BEV:	Two black feet •957945_958405•
*WEN:	That's right  I think it looked very effective what that woman had on •958725_962815•
*BEV:	Yeah •963085_963145•
*WEN:	so •966725_966785•
*BEV:	can do one like that with that mustard up the top shelf  •966785_969045•
*WEN:	Yeah it's nice innit? •969045_971575•
*BEV:	with the black •971575_972165•
*WEN:	That would stand out wouldn't it? •974495_976435•
*BEV:	Yeah •976435_976525•
*WEN:	That would be nice, you won't want that much for the sleeve •976525_979405•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	of black, so, do anything with black for ages •979405_981455•
*BEV:	I saw your Andrew the other day •981455_982585•
*WEN:	Eh? •982585_982665•
*BEV:	I would think Andrew doing some •984075_986505•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Probably would  •987985_988255•
*BEV:	three pound balls and three pound thirty, er three pound twenty seven •988645_993085•
*WEN:	How much was it nine? •994875_995695•
        Yeah it was nine, that's right, no it could be quite interesting actually, and then the other way •995855_100460•
*BEV:	Or then you'd do like the four, four, four flares •100460_101036•
*WEN:	Yeah •101054_101063•
*BEV:	flat back •101335_101370•
*WEN:	Yeah, it's limitless innit, but the other way is to do right down the centre, one on one and one on the other •101370_101833•
*BEV:	Yeah  •101833_101848•
*WEN:	reverse it on the back or have the same on the back •102093_102513•
*BEV:	No what, what you normally do with those is er, say one half black and one half yellow and you have a yellow sleeve that side •102513_103399•
*WEN:	Yeah •103399_103411•
*BEV:	and a black sleeve that side •103411_103557•
*WEN:	that's right , limitless innit? •103557_103664•
        But it would be wise to use the plum before I got the cerise or the sea green •104003_104405•
*BEV:	Well it would •104405_104635•
*WEN:	Yeah, of course it would, well it only sat there anyway again innit? •104635_104901•
*BEV:	Of course it does •104916_105007•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*BEV:	haven't we? •105007_105057•
*WEN:	Well we always do, I mean if you'd use all that was in that cupboard you'd have half a dozen jumpers •105057_105723•
*BEV:	I know •105723_105734•
*WEN:	Yeah •105734_105743•
*BEV:	Well I shall use the mohair next •105758_106200•
*WEN:	Yeah, well there must be a fair amount of mohair •106369_106670•
*BEV:	There is  •106670_106685•
*WEN:	I mean that was an exceptionally good buy weren't it? •106734_107255•
*BEV:	Well what I want is the black and the cerise •107255_107411•
*WEN:	Mm  •107442_107448•
*BEV:	because I'm not sure whether to put all different colours in •107570_108235•
*WEN:	Well I think, I'd just experiment •108246_108479•
*BEV:	or the black and the cerise and all the jacquards  •108479_108661•
*WEN:	but you must yeah •108661_108717•
*BEV:	because that could be quite effective •108763_108915•
*WEN:	That would be effective, but I mean you don't want to do any that you've got to unpick, no that  •108915_109392•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	is not viable that •109392_109493•
*BEV:	Yeah, that's why I think if I did all the jacquard in the cerise •109552_110030•
*WEN:	Mm •110106_110119•
*BEV:	that would show up beautiful •110151_110401•
*WEN:	Mm, yeah I think it would •110401_110446•
*BEV:	because what they've done on that pattern, why they've got so many different colours, where it mixes so you've got your red and your  •110547_111100•
*WEN:	Mm  •111100_111109•
*BEV:	green, they've got like an orangey •111238_111464•
*WEN:	Yeah •111480_111486•
*BEV:	you know where it crosses •111486_111606•
*WEN:	Yeah •111606_111612•
*BEV:	you know like that one of Howard's jumper •111625_111756•
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah •111756_111827•
*BEV:	well they've got it so that the colours in the middle •111827_112177•
*WEN:	Sort of mingle •112288_112324•
*BEV:	mingle •112341_112380•
*WEN:	Yeah •112388_112395•
*BEV:	and like you've sort of got a yellow and a green, they've put like an olive in that, an olive colour, but I haven't got colours that I can •112486_113395•
*WEN:	No •113395_113401•
*BEV:	mix like that  •113431_113474•
*WEN:	not like that no •113492_113546•
*BEV:	No, that's the thing •113589_113685•
*WEN:	Oh well, oh, as long as you don't have to unpick, because that is awful •113685_114054•
*BEV:	Oh I know •114203_114266•
*WEN:	It's just a mess innit after? •114266_114343•
*BEV:	Yeah, but I don't know it'll be quite effective •114415_115320•
*WEN:	Yeah, oh yeah, but as I say it's limitless really •115351_115571•
*BEV:	Yeah •115848_115854•
*WEN:	especially with a •115854_115892•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	unless I go up that shop, top shop and have a look at those gramme balls, yellow, oranges •115892_116445•
*WEN:	Yeah •116462_116473•
*BEV:	red and got those to put in the black •116475_116588•
*WEN:	Yeah •116588_116613•
*BEV:	but there again my er  •116613_116743•
*WEN:	How much were they? •116743_116898•
*BEV:	Ninety nine P •116948_117070•
*WEN:	Oh, that's not so bad is it? •117070_117467•
*BEV:	No but there again •117467_117616•
*WEN:	But there again you're buying again •117644_117801•
*BEV:	Well I'd put in the cerise and have all the jacquard colours, it, it would look very effective •117805_118436•
*WEN:	Mm it certainly would, it doesn't have to be different colours •118436_118982•
*BEV:	No, no it doesn't  how many black ones are there? •118982_119785•
*WEN:	I can't remember •119785_119896•
*BEV:	Two •119896_119902•
*WEN:	No I don't think there was two •120026_120160•
*BEV:	No just one •120160_120228•
*WEN:	I think there was only one because they only had one, and I got one white cos they only had one I think, it was the other colours I'm sure I'd got two of, I must of done, cos I mean I've used a lot myself don't I? •120264_121634•
*BEV:	Yeah  •121634_121640•
*WEN:	No I, I would think the black and the white were one, but mind you it goes a long blinking way don't it? •121640_122246•
*BEV:	Well I •122282_122390•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah  but I think it was only one and one of those two, I, I'd picked the white up because there wasn't any black, for that first time •122456_123745•
*BEV:	Mm •123869_123877•
*WEN:	because I thought that was neutral didn't I? •123886_124041•
*BEV:	Erm •124041_124053•
*WEN:	I don't know if I had them or not •124460_124541•
*BEV:	I wonder if I've seen one of those •124541_124939•
*WEN:	Three hundred again I think   it was  it was six balls weren't it? •125011_126020•
        Two, four, six •126020_126056•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	but they want seven and I want to put that big bit at the bottom. •126056_126469•
*WEN:	Have I used any black? •126669_126767•
        I haven't have I? •126776_126841•
*BEV:	No  •126841_126847•
*WEN:	No  •126847_126853•
*BEV:	Or was it seventy five ball? •126853_127353•
*WEN:	I dunno •127433_127842•
*BEV:	No •127913_127920•
*WEN:	I think it was fifty, I do, but I'm not sure  oh perhaps if we can get over there at the end of the, well it's the end of the month next week anyway innit? •127920_128967•
*BEV:	Oh •128967_128970•
*WEN:	I mean, you don't know what they've got over there now do you? •128970_129312•
        I mean basically we go there and the meat shop don't we? •129434_129641•
*BEV:	Yeah •129684_129702•
*WEN:	There's not much else we want to look around at is there? •129702_130004•
*BEV:	We wanna look at shoes •130016_130164•
*WEN:	Shoes I •130249_130262•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah •130598_130604•
*BEV:	But then again it's not a brilliant idea going on a •130730_131037•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	for wool when we've got so many •131120_131322•
*WEN:	Oh yeah •131358_131379•
*BEV:	cos we'll come back loaded up  •131387_131660•
*WEN:	haven't got it right actually, I mean basically we can go up the top shop and buy what we like can't we? •131945_132508•
        Get one, O nine, I mean providing you've got enough to do what you want to do in mohair •132523_132988•
*BEV:	I don't know •132988_133045•
*WEN:	no you'd have to get all out and have a look, but I mean if I go over there I'll bring back a load of D K and I know I will  we'll see. •133083_134073•
*BEV:	Well you see the trouble is when we're buying it over there right •134098_134791•
*WEN:	You get the left overs •134801_134898•
*BEV:	we buy six hundred •135088_135190•
*WEN:	Six hundred, yeah •135190_135233•
*BEV:	which is two hundred per person  •135255_135383•
*WEN:	Yeah, well you see it's quite a point you know, cos if we go up the top shop, we just, well the most I would buy is four •135391_135932•
*BEV:	Well that's four pound, four pound  •135932_136182•
*WEN:	Well that's what four pound and four nines  •136189_136394•
*BEV:	Forty  •136394_136414•
*WEN:	thirty six •136520_136560•
*BEV:	Four pound thirty six where you'd pay two pounds, four pounds for two hundred grammes •136647_137363•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	mm, dunno well we'll see anyway, it depends on you and what you're doing •137363_137873•
*BEV:	But there again it's better wool that you're buying from the •137873_138210•
*WEN:	What, at the top shop? •138210_138328•
*BEV:	Yeah •138335_138343•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	yeah •138343_138350•
*WEN:	Yeah, that's a very old make you know, that one's been going for donkey years, but it's those colours, I mean there's at least, well with the  •138373_139441•
*BEV:	Well the trouble is we go over there and we buy a good buy •139446_139806•
*WEN:	Mm •139806_139812•
*BEV:	but it might not be the colours that we're actually looking for  •139872_140219•
*WEN:	Well I, I'm sure it wouldn't be, what did I say I said that sea green and the cerise •140219_140741•
*BEV:	And I said the mustard •140781_140874•
*WEN:	The mustard and the beigey one weren't it? •140874_141171•
*BEV:	Yeah •141171_141183•
*WEN:	Er oatmeal •141183_141309•
*BEV:	Er, yeah •141309_141368•
*WEN:	Well that's, that's two jumpers each innit? •141571_141827•
*BEV:	Yeah •141842_141851•
*WEN:	I mean I've got plenty of black, so mustard and black whatever, whatever, cerise and black or something, that's daft really you know •141919_142768•
*BEV:	It's very silly •142780_142961•
*WEN:	I mean nine times out of ten we erm, we just go over there and buy what's there •142972_143590•
*BEV:	Yeah •143633_143642•
*WEN:	regardless when we come back well what are you going to make with it? •143642_143879•
*BEV:	See, that's what I've bought patterns now •144004_144107•
*WEN:	Yeah, no well I think that, thinking about it seriously now •144178_144612•
*BEV:	What I want to find one is one without a well •144642_144886•
*WEN:	Without a well? •145090_145162•
*BEV:	Yeah, so it can hang over trousers •145193_145417•
*WEN:	Oh I see •145417_145446•
*BEV:	A long one •145459_145528•
*WEN:	What like a sweat top or some of them does  •145552_145825•
*BEV:	Yeah, yeah  •145929_145949•
*WEN:	but I er  •145987_146084•
*BEV:	We know that one, that woman was wearing that white one  •146084_146376•
*WEN:	Yeah yeah, yeah •146376_146594•
*BEV:	now something like that, that can go over a skirt •146601_146796•
*WEN:	Or anything and it's very versatile •146863_147118•
*BEV:	Yeah •147219_147248•
*WEN:	No, thinking about it seriously it would be better to go up there, have a swifty through patterns you know, you need a bit of time •147248_147943•
*BEV:	Yeah •147943_147949•
*WEN:	you need a bit of time •147988_148135•
*BEV:	but then again it'll take me longer to find that one this morning •148135_148363•
*WEN:	Oh, that was when I was waiting in the queue weren't it? •148372_148531•
*BEV:	Yeah •148557_148573•
*WEN:	Mm, it really  •148665_148765•
*BEV:	it caught my eye and I thought well •148765_148879•
*WEN:	Yeah, it really is stupid having all these left overs, alright as I said before I can make all that kid stuff, but in the end I've got too much to take over •148958_149796•
*BEV:	Yeah  and then again you don't always wanna, erm start all along, with them do you? •149796_150756•
*WEN:	No •150849_150855•
*BEV:	And then you've got different colours that don't really go with that, but  •150855_151181•
*WEN:	Anyway I mean I've got a fair pile now to take in August ain't I? •151435_152443•
*BEV:	Yeah  •152443_152465•
*WEN:	No I, well the, the colours that I like you know the cerise and the •152465_152833•
*BEV:	Yeah •152833_152851•
*WEN:	the green, I can, I, he's says to buy four of them without thinking about it cos they're so nice and that's really the thing that we don't do when we go to Basingstoke we start going around saying well which one shall I have, but they said that you haven't looked at it like I've looked at those and you looked at yours because that oatmeal colour will be very, very handy for erm sticking with anything and everything •152887_155078•
*BEV:	Yeah •155109_155124•
*WEN:	Well I mean I've looked round here for a pair of blinking shoes, the only trouble here er had over here is that I've got to go somewhere where they're wide enough and that's •155406_156139•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Littlewoods innit? •156152_156645•
        The only ones here that did a wider fitting that one, er at the time I bought some, well those with the gold on the back was Stead and Simpson and they did a wider fitting, but I don't know anybody else, but they may now •156645_157883•
*BEV:	Probably do now •157957_158005•
*WEN:	they may now, but erm, I mean these I've got on are Williams, they're an E fit that I, I particularly sent away for •158057_158860•
*BEV:	Yeah •158865_158871•
*WEN:	Well I don't want to do that any more cos you've got to wait three damn weeks nearly for the blasted things to come and then if they're no good you've got to send them back. •158953_159634•
*BEV:	Yeah, but there again you see  they're, you're not going into a shop saying oh they look nice •159634_160356•
*WEN:	No, anyway those plimsolls they're, they're alright •160380_160771•
*BEV:	Yeah  •160771_160787•
*WEN:	now I said the others, they've got to be lace-ups though look, it's gotta be lace-ups  •160867_161225•
*BEV:	It must be easier to find wider •161225_161319•
*WEN:	Yeah because I mean if there, if you've got a high instep it still don't matter because you only widen your laces don't you? •161342_161939•
*BEV:	Yeah  •161940_161941•
*WEN:	Well perhaps I'll have a look in town next Friday then, I could definitely do with a pair •161941_162546•
*BEV:	Well we could even, oh dear  we could even go •162557_163014•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	oh dear •163014_163065•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah •163065_163074•
*BEV:	don't we? •163135_163575•
*WEN:	yeah  yeah we do cos it's there innit? •163576_163992•
        Quite right •164274_164313•
*BEV:	If we're gonna spend money you might as well go to Littlewoods or •164560_164773•
*WEN:	Mm •164791_164818•
*BEV:	somewhere where it's decent •164869_165167•
*WEN:	Mm, same, the same situation as those clothes •165168_165551•
*BEV:	Yeah •165560_165569•
*WEN:	weren't it? •165607_165661•
        Oh I didn't like them I was, I could see them riding up the leg just like that pair I had on that day and in the end they look so grey and they look like •165662_166482•
*BEV:	I had a doggy bag the other day •166510_166676•
*WEN:	Eh? •166701_166715•
*BEV:	doggy bag when their •166754_166848•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah •166977_167009•
*BEV:	in the end they do •167104_167214•
*WEN:	Yeah they do  but they, those others I was quite, you didn't try them on so I •167214_167773•
*BEV:	No I forgot I was downstairs weren't I so? •167773_168061•

*BEV:	Yeah •169113_169120•
*WEN:	and the stirrups are nice •169259_169339•
*BEV:	They're smart aren't they? •169339_169562•
*WEN:	Yeah •169563_169564•
*BEV:	But they've got to be long enough in the leg for me •169670_169788•
