*KC9PSUN:	Yeah oh yeah . 
*PS0CJ:	It 's a shame with . 
*KC9PSUN:	That 's what annoys me with erm these big company 's you know opening on Sunday 's really because er you can only get the money I mean they 've only got a certain amount . 
*PS0CJ:	Yeah . 
*KC9PSUN:	I mean if they could open nine days a week they could n't get any more money out of me because . 
*PS0CG:	No you have n't got it . 
*KC9PSUN:	No . 
*PS0CG:	No . 
*KC9PSUN:	They 're they 're . 
*PS0CG:	No me neither . 
*KC9PSUN:	all they 're doing is erm where people do it on a Saturday they they wo n't do their go football or something and then go on a Sunday now I think it 's nice to have a a day when nothing happens . 
*PS0CG:	Yes when it 's all quite all the shops are closed . 
*PS0CJ:	0 . 
*KC9PSUN:	Apart from religion or anything else you know . 
*PS0CJ:	Yeah . 
*PS0CG:	Yeah . 
*KC9PSUN:	It I think it 's nicer when when it . 
*PS0CG:	Oh yes not necessarily religious grounds I agree with you it 's just nice to have one day a week where everything is peaceful . 
*KC9PSUN:	That 's right yeah where as it 's now they 're all going to open up gon na go chasing around . 
*PS0CJ:	Just be like a Saturday . 
*KC9PSUN:	we sha n't know which day there 'll be no weekend will we really . 
*PS0CG:	No . 
*KC9PSUN:	it wo n't be a weekend . 
*PS0CG:	No . 
*KC9PSUN:	And that it 's all for money and they 're doing alright I mean they 're already making so many you know millions they 're making are n't they . 
*PS0CG:	Well the big ones are yeah . 
*KC9PSUN:	Yes . 
*PS0CJ:	Oh yes . 
*PS0CG:	There 's only one thing it might mean more part time jobs for college leavers and things if they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and they did give them a foot up to start a job then get taken on you know as . 
*KC9PSUN:	But the one 's that 's gon na be hit I think are people like old Lionel . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CJ:	Mm . 
*KC9PSUN:	Because he he 's not doing all that good you see and when er he he re he reckons on Sunday .

*PS0CG:	But I prefer Lionel I 'll go round the supermarket 's but I 'll shop at Lionel 's on the way back . 
*KC9PSUN:	We do we do n't buy . 
*PS0CG:	Cos I can pick out his stuff or say I do n't like the look of that one and he 'll he 'll chuck it in the back . 
*KC9PSUN:	Mm mm . 
*PS0CG:	And he 'll often say to me look there 's a fresh box under there help yourself to what you want i have n't opened that box . 
*KC9PSUN:	And and if you complained about anything er like we found perhaps had a banana that 's not been quite ripe he 'll give you two or three the next time you go in if you say anything about it . 
*PS0CG:	Oh yes indeed indeed well only last week I said do need some flowers come on Thursday they 're fresh I said I want them now Lionel I hate to be without flowers in the room and he said well have two for the price of one he would insist that I had two bunches for the price of one .

*PS0CJ:	Mm . 
*PS0CG:	and right back into the er the Keltic legions and the medieval monks . 
*PS0CJ:	That 's right there 's certainly a . 
*PS0CG:	That 's what I said to you your dad when he did n't want to take Aspirins for his restrained back and him do n't believe in these drugs and I said look if a monk gave you this he 'd he 'd give you the bark of a birch tree pound it up in a pestle and water and you 'd think it was magic and you 'd take it and you relax your muscles is that what it is I said yes that 's what Aspirin is originally birch bark Well of course they used to use the poppy for people in great pain .

*PS0CJ:	0 . 
*PS0CG:	If it 's good erm can I say truthful background of the Indians . 
*PS0CJ:	Well actually and it might be based on a true story do n't know if it . 
*PS0CG:	Do you remember when Vaughan was Vaughan was doing his meditation . 
*PS0CJ:	Yeah . 
*PS0CG:	and he was trying to get in touch with a North American Indian that a thingamy in Wales was fixed up . 
*PS0CJ:	0 . 
*PS0CG:	Wonder what ever came of that . 
*PS0CJ:	Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about things like that because you asked a straight forward and he goes way way over the head . 
*PS0CG:	Yeah I know he does versify . 
*PS0CJ:	and within three seconds my brain just switches off . 
*PS0CG:	Well I try to . 
*PS0CJ:	0 . 
*PS0CG:	I I just ask him if and it the question that I 'm interested in the answer to like how did it go and now he talks at me for an hour until Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany cos she can see I sort of trying to edge away . 
*PS0CJ:	suddenly cross your legs ouch . 
*PS0CG:	That 's a good idea She said to me just say to him like I do enough Vaughany do n't want to hear any more I said no I I would hate to offend him because it 's all so well meant being a mother in law you have to watch it . 
*PS0CJ:	honestly you could n't be much worse than . 
*PS0CG:	Oh mother in law is . 
*PS0CJ:	0 . 
*PS0CG:	She 's just . 
*PS0CJ:	I 'm not buying her a present I mean I 'll chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if it comes but we 'll have to go to but erm you know she . 
*PS0CG:	As a person you know I 'd never have any time Yes yes I mean you never she lives in that great place and she 's got no money . 
*PS0CJ:	they 're not they 're not her presents are they they 're from Diane . 
*PS0CG:	No of course of course . 
*PS0CJ:	So I tell you what if if we do end up spending Christmas at gon na give me the present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving Stella the Christmas present It so . 
*PS0CG:	I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate her but I . 
*PS0CJ:	I could n't I 'm afraid . 
*PS0CG:	Well could do what I ca n't forgive is that she was so spiteful to my daughter she 's a sun shiny little sole and she 's so full of love for everybody she 's so generous . 
*PS0CJ:	Why was she . 
*PS0CG:	she did n't want Vaughany to get married again . 
*PS0CJ:	Oh . 
*PS0CG:	She used to say what Diane I 've never heard of a Diane after they were married this . 
*PS0CJ:	0 . 
*PS0CG:	And when anyone treats my daughter like that I find it very hard to forgive I know it hurts my kids I 'm much more up in arms than if they hurt me Remember that first Christmas when she put the cat among the pigeons by saying to me your husband told me that he ca n't really afford he 's flying because you spend all his money when I when I 've been backing him saving money for his aeroplane and his lessons and . 
*PS0CJ:	What did you say to dad did you say that to dad did n't you say it . 
*PS0CG:	But I thought she was stirring it you see and so did Diane . 
*PS0CJ:	What did you tell . 
*PS0CG:	I did n't believe her . 
*PS0CJ:	You did n't you never . 
*PS0CG:	But he said I said it as a joke when she was asking me about my flying and I said I do n't do as much flying as I 'd like to I 've I 've got a wife to support and she takes all the money But I said I am the money I gave him his first flying lesson I paid for it like I bought his first three cars . 
*PS0CJ:	0 . 
*PS0CG:	I excused myself and went to bed I think but she repeated it so solemnly you see not as say somebody saying a joking sort of way . 
*PS0CJ:	Yeah good stirring . 
*PS0CG:	And it was just after Frank had left her and gone to live in that place in . 
*PS0CJ:	Does does anybody know what he 's doing . 
*PS0CG:	Do n't know last time I asked Diane she said oh he 's he 's living with this machine he 's got in . 
*PS0CJ:	What machine . 
*PS0CG:	some magic machine . 
*PS0CJ:	What machine Magic machine . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CJ:	What kind of machine . 
*PS0CG:	A machine he 's designed I do n't know for what purpose I did n't dare ask I was going to ask Vaughan . 
*PS0CJ:	It 's not to it 's not to isolate gamma rays . 
*PS0CG:	Probably but he was hiding he would n't come out because he said that the men from outer space were after him . 
*PS0CJ:	It 's funny you know I 've reading I 'm reading Silence of Silence of the Lambs at the moment and er you know it 's got in there a lot of er er mentally ill patient 's have got this idea that men men from Mars have . 
*PS0CG:	Well I said to Diane you know I did n't laugh I did n't think it was funny I thought it was sad and I said but he needs help if Vaughan 's you know he 's got two sons but Mark 's a bit hopeless and he was at Oxford anyway I said surely somebody should go and get him some some treatment sanitation . 
*PS0CJ:	Yes . 
*PS0CG:	You can get cranks you just believe in flying saucers and a quite happy harmless but I think they need checking on to make sure that they are happy with the life they 're leading it bothers me a lot . 
*PS0CJ:	So where is he now . 
*PS0CG:	Well he 's still in Manchester I think . 
*PS0CJ:	Doing what Is he living with living in a . 
*PS0CG:	I think he 's in lodgings .
