*GIL:	So you had a good day yesterday?
*UNK:	Yes dear, very, very nice  (.) 
*GIL:	I thought about you, about what time was it, about ten o'clock and I thought well it's no good gasping for air, she'll soon be able to have some yeah  ((laugh)) .
*UNK:	 (        ) but as I was saying erm, it was erm   (.) when you think I sort of tend to worry if I see like Neville you know 
*GIL:	Mm 
*UNK:	towards   (        ) or anywhere, but then you see it can be your weight as well 
*GIL:	yeah
*UNK:	to climb the stairs, and I think then you tend to panic a bit, I   (        ) and I felt most of the time I felt fine, and then you see getting up at five o'clock yesterday morning, by the time I got off, it was your father that fell asleep on that last drinking session, but I mean, as I said we ain't used to drinking in the day like that 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	I mean some of them at the   (        ) going in at dinner time and have a couple, three pints it don't hit them does it?
*GIL:	No
*UNK:	And erm   (.) I   (        ) they had to have   (        ) a couple of   (        ) I mean I think  (        ) 
*GIL:	yeah?

*GIL:	Yeah
*UNK:	they could get ready for half past where with rather doing the  (        ) 
*GIL:	oh

*GIL:	yeah 
*UNK:	bit here and I thought god that   (        ) so I thought right I'm gonna change places in that seat but your father's sitting on, (        ) alright, I said   (        ) go in that back seat, just behind us there were   (        ) there or I said or I'm just coming to sit where you are, I said I can't do four hours sitting like this, I mean I'd have been boss eyed before I got, well I was I, I, all say look at that cloud  (        )

*UNK:	Oh.
*GIL:	well it's not a jacket, it's a sort, as I say it's a waistcoat.Oh there's one right in front of us, look, blind as a bloody bat Gill.
*UNK:	Dad's just got in
*GIL:	Oh gawld, move forward a bit, so that's what I was going to get, but erm in BeWise they've got erm checked shirts and they're five ninety nine this brushed cotton thing, so I thought if I get him that waistcoat and a pair of cords, erm and get him one of these brushed cotton shirts    (.)  [yawning] that'll be that sort of colour  [] 
*UNK:	How much are the cords then?
*GIL:	What in the club book?
*UNK:	No
*GIL:	Cords in general?
*UNK:	eh?
*GIL:	Erm  (.) 
*UNK:	Mummy
*GIL:	yes, we're now going sweetheart, erm
*UNK:	mummy, (        ) 
*GIL:	I think they're about fifteen something like that, fifteen, sixteen, really depends whether you buy needlecord or erm this thickish cord
*UNK:	Well what do you want?
*GIL:	Well I'm, I'm easy, I mean the thickish cord erm, washes ni , they wear better I think the thickish cord but I mean erm and they're a bit warmer, but if you shop about usually you can get them erm the same price as the needlecord   (.) I'll leave that with you, right.
*UNK:	If we've got to go to Boston at some point, for the bras you see, so erm
*GIL:	Mm, oh, oh I'll leave that with you anyway 
*UNK:	I'm a bit concerned you know, about this, just this one week's wages you know because I would have thought once Jack got his time sheet out he would perhaps realised that
*GIL:	Just ring Derek up
*UNK:	no   (.) but on the other hand I've got a certificate till   (.) then, so if the, if the money has run out for what he pays me
*GIL:	mm
*UNK:	and he claims back, I'm still entitled to er,
*GIL:	oh yeah
*UNK:	sick pay from somewhere aren't I?
*GIL:	yeah, (        ) you're allowed 
*UNK:	and I, (        ) 
*GIL:	you're allowed twenty six, er twenty six weeks off
*UNK:	I thought I was.
*GIL:	I'm sure it's twenty six weeks off on full pay and then you go on
*UNK:	Mm
*GIL:	whatever, whatever 
*UNK:	yeah 
*GIL:	they call it this week, it changes names every week
*UNK:	yeah
*GIL:	so you 
*UNK:	it says  (        ) 
*GIL:	I wouldn't know that
*UNK:	statutory sick pay
*GIL:	yeah, but I'm sure the, the first one's for twenty six weeks.
*UNK:	Yeah, but I'm su , you know I did debate whether it was twenty
*GIL:	No, no, I'm sure it was twenty six 
*UNK:	I thought it was six, twenty six  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	if   (        ) Derek and he went away last weekend he perhaps stuffed it in here but then he drops it in when he finds it
*GIL:	mm
*UNK:	but Jack is so temperamental these days, I mean the other day he went by he said oh   (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	I nearly forgot you, I mean one week   (        ) he rang me and had it pinched out of his car
*GIL:	Yeah
*UNK:	and then he found it, stuffed down the bottom, so he don't know what he does with it
*GIL:	Oh so he found that?
*UNK:	Yeah it was in his car  (.) 
*GIL:	He reckoned it was pinched outside the post office 
*UNK:	yeah he said oh Margaret wages have been took out me car   (.) he said I ge , I'll get it at some point for you Margaret he said when I go at the bank but he said, yours was taken out Jack's car
*GIL:	What?
*UNK:	he said yeah   (.) and then 
*GIL:	then he found it 
*UNK:	and then er, I whether Jack or Derek came up with it he said it was found in the car.
*GIL:	Well I think you ought to ring Well's  (        ) 
*UNK:	Oh I will after this weekend, you know, because if 
*GIL:	yeah, but 
*UNK:	if they just bring one, I shall say well I've got choice then to say well is this this week's or last week's, now I don't want to give them that opportunity to say well she's worrying about one week's wages, I mean Jan could love that   (.) and that's given him chance to bring er, whereas if it pops through the door, or he comes
*GIL:	mm
*UNK:	I shall say to him, what's happened is this this week's or last week's?
*GIL:	mm, and if he says well I've already got last week's here.
*UNK:	Oh well then I'll say well that ain't.
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) Right come on then off we go.
