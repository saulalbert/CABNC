*ENI:	Do you get at school any erm   (.) any sort of music lessons?
*MOL:	Erm   (.) yes.On Thursdays I go to music lesson   (.) and erm, we have this singing contest   (.) erm, we come second out of the   (.) first years, and we sung Mole in a Hole.
*ENI:	Good!
*MOL:	Erm   (.) at dinner times you can go into the music room   (.) erm   (.) you can play on any music instrument you like   (.) there's   (.) keyboards   (.) erm, violins   (.) guitars erm   (.) drums.I tried to play on the drums, I'm not too good at that.
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) They make a terrible noise don't they  [] ?
*MOL:	Yeah.Erm   (.) Only trouble, there's a snare drum   (.) you can turn it onto snare or ordinary but when you have it on snare, if you play   (        ) or anything it rattles!
*ENI:	Is it erm, is a snare the thing that co , the sort of wire that goes across it?
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	And what does that do?
*MOL:	Erm, well   (.) it makes erm   (.) a lighter so , makes the drum sound to a lot of   (.) lighter sounds.
*ENI:	Oh I see.
*MOL:	But erm, when you play music and you keep it on snare the wires keep rattling.
*ENI:	Ah yes.
*MOL:	So, you have to erm   (.) pull this   (.) erm, little lever at the side   (.) and that   (.) that'll   (.) turn the snare bit off   (.) they can play on there   (.) erm   (.) there's   (.) the choir, erm
*ENI:	Are you in the choir?
*MOL:	Erm, no I don't know much about it yet, we haven't   (.) I've only just   (.) been told about it by a friend who I sit next to on the bus.
*ENI:	You've only been there   (.) I think a ba , a term haven't you?
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	So tha , yes.Mhm.
*MOL:	So we don't know much about it yet, but on Thursdays we   (.) get, we've got taught how to play   (.) erm   (.) a keyboard and been taught a little bit about reading music.But 
*ENI:	Good!
*MOL:	erm, I can't read it too well cos I've only had about   (.) couple of lessons on it.
*ENI:	Yes.It needs practice doesn't it?
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Of course, being in the choir it gives you practice reading music   (.) because you just have one line to follow
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	and that's a good start isn't it?Aha 
*MOL:	I have heard erm   (.) some choir, the choir sing a little bit   (.) cos erm   (.) we got a corridor near the   (.) music hall   (.) and erm   (.) they sing up pretty loud so you can hear it.Cos there's erm   (.) er   (.) machine in there   (.) what you can get erm fo food from right, so I go down there sometimes
*ENI:	Yes.
*MOL:	get something out the machine and listen to the   (.) music in there.
*ENI:	Nice!Good!I think it's a good school don't you?
*MOL:	Yeah, it's pretty good   (.) but erm   (.) the older ones think they run it a bit!
*ENI:	Yes.
*MOL:	But, there's, some of them are alright.I got some   (.) erm   (.) friends up there who are in fourth and fifth year
*ENI:	Mm!
