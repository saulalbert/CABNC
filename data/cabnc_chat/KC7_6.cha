*GIL:	I did wonder what er like when I saw Ben I did wonder what he'd   (.) how he'd think, if I'd changed and stuff.  (.) You know?  (.) I'll tell you what, the bed that me and Frank slept in was   ((laughing)) so gorgeous . 
*JEM:	 ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	It was so nice, it was like erm    (.)  (  ) feather thing, feather, feather mattress. 
*JEM:	Feather mattress? 
*GIL:	Yeah.  (.) I think it was feather, or down or something. So it wasn't bouncy but the way that it fitted, or the way that you lay on it, it was just so comfortable, yeah, gorgeous.  (7.0) And I realized it was the first time I actually slept in a bed with Frank ever. ((laugh))  
*JEM:	Yeah? I've ever, I've only slept with him once. 
*GIL:	Or like I've, I've slept with him in tents and stuff but not in a bed. 
*JEM:	Yeah. 
*GIL:	 ((laughing)) And Ben like  when we were sort of there Ben sort of we'd been sitting around for a while and he said it's very embarrassing to have to ask this but you're staying the night and stuff   (.) erm are you two a couple   ((laughing)) or are you just friends    (.) so no, just friends but it's alright, if you don't have any spare rooms we'll be perfectly happy to sleep together, don't worry.  ((laughing)) It was just funny  having him asking me.  (.) Yeah it was a good weekend it was, it was a very good weekend but packed   (.) so much packed in. You know I was only away for two nights, it felt like about a week. (.)  
*JEM:	You saw a lot of people, went a lot of places. 
*GIL:	Yeah. Shame Tom wasn't in. We were like ringing the bell and both of us were desperate for a crap, absolutely desperate, and desperate for a cup of tea cos we got up at ei  er half seven. (.)  
*JEM:	 (  )  (8.0) Oh well   (.) missed him. What a shame. 
*GIL:	It might have been easier actually to say she's not coming.  (.) Are you into going to a pub tonight? 
*JEM:	 (  ) I want to   (  ) wash my hair and 
*GIL:	I should stay in, I'm stupid going out again. 
*JEM:	  (  )  I mean I, I can see why you're going out but it's, you know   (.) I need, I need to have a night in I mean   (.) I've done, I've had so many stupidly late nights. 
*GIL:	Mm.  (.) Tell you what I must do actually whilst I'm thinking about it is do   (.) take one lot of washing out and put another lot in.  ((laugh))  (.) Yeah now we've got radiators it's very easy. 
*JEM:	Yeah. 
*GIL:	 ((singing)) Goodbye  She wants me to   (.) don't know what she wants.  (.) I mean I'm quite happy to go to the pub with her I mean   (.) she's alright.  (.) I'm quite interested to see how I get on with her actually cos I've only ever known her in the context of Tom and Darrel really. 
*JEM:	Yeah. I find her a bit hard actually.  (.)  (  ) I get   (  ) she's not really interested in what I'm saying. 
*GIL:	Yeah, I know what you mean. It's the way that she kind of like answers before you've really got done finishing what you're saying.  ((laughing)) Do you know what I mean ? You know when people do that and you just think well  (.)  
*JEM:	 (  ) 
*GIL:	 ((laughing)) Yeah you can't  really be listening to what I'm saying cos you   (.) cos I haven't   ((laughing)) finished yet .  (.) Erm    (.)  ((laugh)) Pizza Express tissues everywhere. That's better.  ((laugh))  ((sniff)) Both T-shirts still look blue don't they? 
*JEM:	 (  )  (.) 
*GIL:	 ((singing)) to be free . Maybe I put something in that's dyed them again    (  )  (.)  Hello   
*JEM:	 Hello. 
*GIL:	come in love.
