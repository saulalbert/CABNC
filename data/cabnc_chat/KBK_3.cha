@Comment:	conversation #3 (Tape 002003)
*CHR:	I've never seen such dry grapefruit.
*NOR:	I ought to complain really.It's such, such a time wasting procedure when you've got to   (.) take things back.
*CHR:	Where did they come from?
*NOR:	Sainsbury's.
*CHR:	Mm.
*NOR:	It's the same sort we had before that have been so good.And the last couple of weeks I bought the cheaper ones.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	And that was forty eight pence for one grapefruit because it was pink.
*CHR:	Doesn't even look pink, does it?
*NOR:	No.
*CHR:	Well I think you complain.I don't think you have to take it back, I didn't take that chicken back to Safeway's if you remember.
*NOR:	What chicken was that?
*CHR:	The one that smelt. (.) 
*NOR:	Did you complain?
*CHR:	Yes.Don't you remember that?
*NOR:	I remember the chicken.But I don't remember 
*CHR:	Some months ago.I took the label back.Didn't take, didn't bother with the chicken.And she didn't, she scarcely even looked at the label.She took my word for it.Unfortunately because it, it was a special sell today job with a reduction off others I didn't get much money back.And then went and bought another fresh chicken   (        ) had to pay even more money for it. (.) . Ah.Well it's incredible how little mail, and there's nothing on fax or telex either.
*NOR:	They're all on holiday perhaps   (        ) half term.
*CHR:	This is not nice.
*NOR:	Looks revolting.
*CHR:	Mm.Well.
*NOR:	Well don't bother, we'll take it back. (        ) 
*CHR:	Really not good.Extraordinary. (.) Will you have toast? (.) Cake? (.) Sorry, will you have some toast?
*NOR:	 (        )
