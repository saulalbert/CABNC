*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	we've got fifteen left. •426750_43845•
        Then then he says, then well cos what we're saying is, then if your barrelage goes up to four barrels, say •43845_47945•

        It even, providing you haven't got a lot of  if you've only got about a hundred people it's not too bad that cos it, it  also creates a bit more atmosphere. •649911_656611•
        But, it's a better  it's not a  bad designed place in a sense that, that  I mean, it's a reasonable size room •658061_664701•
*BAR:	Mm. •664841_665211•
*UNK:	and you and three hundred people er, you can take three hundred quite  •665341_668841•

*BAR:	Yeah. •726111_726311•
*UNK:	But I mean, that's not a big job it's just  •726311_728091•

*BAR:	you're light, the er ceiling  could you not get away with covering the, get the lights a colour blue? •774271_782251•
        And er  and  you know, tidying up ceiling obviously   •782511_784811•
*UNK:	Right. •786691_786811•
*BAR:	I mean, there's lots of bits and pieces you need for   •787581_790511•
*BAR:	I mean, if you just  cover all the areas that were really  •790601_794991•
*BAR:	Yeah. •794991_795081•
*BAR:	bad, er  I reckon, I says, well what do you think  yourself in, in, in •795081_802311•
*UNK:	Well the, the big  the single biggest cost is, is what we do with this  a carpet area. •802311_807711•
*BAR:	Mm. •807921_807951•
*UNK:	That's our single biggest cost, cos  as I say, I had three quotes in total, and they were all sort of between thirteen and twenty three. •807951_816621•
*BAR:	Yeah. •816621_816751•
        Thousand. •816751_817051•
*UNK:	Yeah. •817051_817341•
        But that's, having said that, that's to carpet all this area  •817421_820611•
*BAR:	Yeah. •820611_820871•
*UNK:	that back area I've just taken you through, that, the staircase, and the corridors out there. •820871_825201•
        I mean, that's the carpet I just said like  I wanted a quote to carpet  •825201_827991•
*BAR:	Mm. •828101_828291•
*UNK:	everywhere. •828291_828381•
        Erm  what we were doing is,what it was for, was for, for prospective buyers, they wanted erm  a justification for  •828381_835131•
*BAR:	Yeah. •835801_835841•
        Yeah. •835841_836661•
*UNK:	the money they were gonna spend. •836881_838361•
        I mean, they wouldn't have spent that money. •838361_839531•
        But, they wanted  written quotes for  a justification more or less. •839531_843481•
*BAR:	Do you think it's better being like this? •843481_844391•
        Looking there, or is it better sort of, clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space and •844391_848841•
*UNK:	Well it's quite, it's a reasonable size  •848841_851081•
*BAR:	I know it's a fair size, but   •851081_852011•
*UNK:	It's a fair size dancing  •852011_852641•
*BAR:	you know  •852641_853131•
*UNK:	space actually, I mean, you get about a hundred people on here, it's, it's, it's alright. •853141_856041•
        In fact the, in fact it's,at times it's too big. •856331_859341•
        That's, my one, I don't know how you'd ever get over it, but that's my one  criticism of the thing is that sometimes when you walk in  it's the first thing that hits you and unless people are dancing  it creates a cold atmosphere. •859461_871491•
*BAR:	Yeah. •871491_871531•
*UNK:	Erm •871531_871801•
*BAR:	I mean, if you've got your group on  there's nothing better than having your floor there and are dancing on  the floor at, at, in front of the group kind of thing like  •871801_880041•
*UNK:	Yeah, but I mean if you have any •880131_881441•

*BAR:	To pay. •214960_215023•
*BAR:	That's right. •215029_215122•
*UNK:	But even so, then ask Fred on the long term would be ideal. •215122_215687•

*UNK:	if we can resolve it  with  cos then you're getting summat on a different style of thinking to that, you know, I know Fred doesn't wanna be involved but then you've always got somebody, well we'll have to go and see Fred first. •217441_218211•
*BAR:	Mm. •218211_218217•
*UNK:	And, and I don't know. •218217_218404•
*BAR:	Yeah, you could work it  •218404_218447•

*UNK:	You know, that's the er  •218812_218911•
*BAR:	That's right. •218911_218937•
*UNK:	bit difficult. •218946_218955•

*BAR:	Yeah. •220336_220349•
*BAR:	erm  oh er •220361_220407•
*UNK:	You've gotta put an offer in and pay it so much a month haven't you or something and, and, and get it paid off over a period of time? •220504_221129•
*BAR:	And then you can do it without Fred and, really, with Fred is, is at the end of day you could proof pay load could go back to yourself and I, I and ourselves, but by having him that other cut  you're gonna be saying well  it's all a bit more than  your share. •221129_222262•
        I mean, from my point of view  I don't think he's ever  •222282_222639•
*BAR:	I don't think Fred'd be looking for anything as a return. •222639_222795•
*UNK:	No. •222795_222810•

        Not in the short term. •223010_223056•
*BAR:	you get tucked into it, and obviously there we'll keep it  sort of low profile. •223062_223305•
        But giving it a good clean out  and getting  •223320_223527•
*BAR:	Mm. •223527_223530•

*BAR:	just to save money •224295_224336•
*UNK:	See if you can get •224336_224459•
*BAR:	but as long as, I say, the biggest thing from my point er  is  not to lose money if you can do from where we're going. •224488_224987•
*BAR:	No. •225056_225065•
*BAR:	And use the fifteen grand to its best  image in the way that you feel then you can turn round and run a club  so it can get people in. •225065_225695•
*BAR:	Mm. •225695_225704•
*BAR:	And we can get the lighting in. •225711_225892•

*BAR:	Mm. •226027_226037•
*BAR:	you've got the ideas  and the motions. •226037_226144•
*BAR:	Mm. •226153_226179•
*BAR:	And for yourself, and what we don't wanna do is like I say, is spend money that  is just gonna disappear and say shit! •226179_226713•
        We haven't really improved the pub's  barrelage  if goes away. •226713_227026•
*BAR:	No. •227026_227029•
        I mean,the other aspect of the, of the the other aspect of the, the brewery and me that I was  talking about, er I'm thinking about is that we could do with  you know, okay those,those figures are  I mean, unless they're really realistic it's gonna be  you know, six months or so •227029_228651•
*UNK:	Mm. •228727_228738•
*BAR:	before we start getting up to the kind of figures where we can actually see a  you know  •228767_229134•
*UNK:	Yeah. •229134_229162•
*BAR:	a profit each week  •229165_229203•

*UNK:	That's right, yeah. •229384_229491•
*BAR:	so, with the best will in the world it's going to be six months so let's  so we need a little of breathing space •229491_229858•
*BAR:	Yeah. •229858_229908•
*BAR:	on that six months. •229924_230008•

*BAR:	That's right, yes. •230842_230886•
*BAR:	than we actually need to spend that  that  •230886_230956•
*BAR:	Yeah. •230956_230991•
*BAR:	enables us to  you know, have that breathing space  erm  so we can start  •230991_231389•
