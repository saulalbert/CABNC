*NOR:	The latest threat to children recently is not just wait till your dad gets home, but, my daughter told her four week old baby, if you're not good I'll put you on the fax and send you through to daddy. •240126_241412•
*CHR:	And the four week old probably understood it better than I do. •241944_242179•
