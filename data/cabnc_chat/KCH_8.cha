@Comment:	conversation #8 (Tape 076301)
*DAV:	I'm was having   (        ) on mine.
*JAN:	Alright?Which one's yours?Are you a Smartie one?
*DAV:	Yeah.
*JAN:	Well go and fetch it then.
*DAV:	Right.
*PHI:	There's a   (.) a thing there.Do you want any more drink?
*JAN:	No thank you, I, please let me just finish clearing and I'll, I'll get it finished off quickly. (.) You were telling that Judy, Julie.
*PHI:	Nothing.She said she was just having just the usual drinking gear and er
*JAN:	Well I'm 
*PHI:	eat biscuits, and I don't, nothing else.
*JAN:	I haven't, I haven't any biscuits have I?
*PHI:	Well you'll have some Kit-Kats or summat won't you?
*JAN:	Nope.
*PHI:	Breakaway?
*JAN:	I think I've got Breakaways.I want to put the   (.) disposal unit on so can you   (.) move this?
*PHI:	Come on sunshine, come and sit with me here.
*DAV:	Right.I'm ready.
*PHI:	You're ready?What are you going to do?
*DAV:	Well, first I need a   (.) light of concentration
*PHI:	Oh light helps you concentrate does it?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Go on then.Have some light.
*DAV:	That's   (.) sit down!No next to me here.
*PHI:	Oh right.I'm coming.
*DAV:	Just leave that here.
*PHI:	Right.
*DAV:	Right.
*PHI:	Now what are you going to show me?
*DAV:	I'll tell you. (.) Right.One, plus, plus   (.) one.I'm taking some ones.
*PHI:	Oh I see.That's how you set that up to do that is it?
*DAV:	Yeah.
*PHI:	Who showed you that?
*DAV:	Mrs .
*PHI:	Well I didn't know that.But
*DAV:	She's getting a job at a different school now.
*PHI:	Cor!Has she?
*DAV:	Getting a job.
*PHI:	But, you don't need a machine to do that.You can count just like that.
*DAV:	And, and, well I'm just showing you them.
*PHI:	Right.So
*DAV:	Here.
*PHI:	Yes.
*DAV:	Seven twos. (.) That's two, I got, got it, got it.
*PHI:	Right.But you can count in twos.
*DAV:	Of course I can!Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve.
*PHI:	After twelve?
*DAV:	Fourteen.
*PHI:	Then?
*DAV:	Sixteen.
*PHI:	Then?
*DAV:	Eighteen.
*PHI:	Then?
*DAV:	Twenty.
*PHI:	Then?
*DAV:	Twenty two.
*PHI:	Mm.You're having to think about it.Off then.
*DAV:	Clear.
*PHI:	So can you do ninety nines?Keep adding ninety nines together?
*DAV:	Wait!
*PHI:	What's two ninety nines?That's right.Oh!No now it gets useful doesn't it?When you're dealing in bigger figures
*DAV:	All the
*PHI:	than you can do in your mind.
*DAV:	all the, all the numbers.
*PHI:	Mm.Right, read me that number.
*DAV:	Two hundred and sixty nine.
*PHI:	Start again.
*DAV:	A hundred and two sixty nine.
*PHI:	How do you get that?I number one is, what does it say at the end?
*DAV:	Nothing there.Full stop.
*PHI:	It says, two, O, seven, nine.
*DAV:	Oh.Two O seven nine.
*PHI:	Which is?What does that make?
*DAV:	It's the number of a steam engine I've got.
*PHI:	I'm not bothered whether it's a number of a steam engine but   (.) how do you pronounce that number?
*DAV:	Two hundred a 
*PHI:	No.No.
*DAV:	two.
*PHI:	If it was that number it would be hundreds.It's bigger than hundreds, so what's that?
*DAV:	Er thousands.
*PHI:	Right.So how many thousands?
*DAV:	Two thousand and seventy nine.
*PHI:	Well you got there in the end didn't you?
*DAV:	Right.
*PHI:	Right.
*DAV:	Now it's even more difficult.Even more difficult. (.) Equals
*PHI:	Yeah, very clever.You can add up in, what are you doing up, in tens?
*DAV:	Tens.
*PHI:	You can do that.Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, can't you?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	What comes next?
*DAV:	Fifty, sixty.
*PHI:	Then?
*DAV:	seventy, eighty, ninety, twenty
*PHI:	Ah ah!Ninety?
*DAV:	A hundred.
*PHI:	That's better.And add up in hundreds now.
*DAV:	A hundred, twenty
*PHI:	No.A 
*DAV:	a hundred billi 
*PHI:	No, start off 
*DAV:	Erm 
*PHI:	with a hundred and then add another hundred what do you get?
*DAV:	I'm trying to work my way to the end.
*PHI:	Now you're being a pickle!Not, not with the machine.Using your own head.Add, add hundreds up.Come on.What do you start with?
*DAV:	A hundred, a hundred and one, and 
*PHI:	No.No, no, no, no!I was, I wasn't meaning you to go up in single numbers I was meaning, go up in hundreds.Start off with a hundred.
*DAV:	Yes.A hundred.
*PHI:	Then add, add the same again.
*DAV:	Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred, ten hundred.
*PHI:	But what's ten hundred?
*DAV:	A thousand.
*PHI:	Right.So why didn't you say that?
*DAV:	You didn't   (.) yo 
*PHI:	I, I did.I was expecting you to count, nobody says ten hundred.Do they?
*DAV:	No!It always goes onto the next number.Every number ga always goes up to nine.
*PHI:	Then it triggers over into another one doesn't it?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Now what were we saying the other day?You have, units   (.) tens, hundreds, thousands
*DAV:	But Dad 
*PHI:	don't you?
*DAV:	but    ((sigh))  (.) three er   (.) there.Check that number.Ha!That was stupid.Yeah.
*PHI:	Mm mm.So Mrs  was showing you how to do this?
*DAV:	Right.Yes. (        ) 
*PHI:	What, what else have you learnt to do with a calculator?If you had four things
*DAV:	Yes.If I give them
*PHI:	and you wanted to divide them among four people
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	how many would each person get?
*DAV:	But I don I, I, I didn't quite get the question.
*PHI:	If you had four things and you wanted to divide them between four people
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	how many would each person get?
*DAV:	Two.No, one.
*PHI:	That's better.Now you did that without a calculator didn't you?
*DAV:	Oh I see.
*PHI:	Right, now this time do it with the calculator.So you've got
*DAV:	Four   (.) turn it on.
*PHI:	Turn it on. (.) You run out of light?There are.Now you're on.Which figure do you want?No.No.You're dividing.
*DAV:	Which one's divide?
*PHI:	That one.Divide by
*DAV:	Four.
*PHI:	Yes.That's right.Equals?Right.Now that wa that time, that's easy.That just proves what you already know.
*DAV:	Right dad, I'll show you something else.
*PHI:	No.I was going to do more   (        ) 
*DAV:	But I wa I want to show you something, that's all.
*PHI:	Go on then.Nine, fifty six   (.) square root.
*DAV:	Er
*PHI:	Who taught you that?
*DAV:	 [laughing] Well, I lis no one.It's Mrs  said to Mark 
*PHI:	Just a minute.
*DAV:	he, he, he was getting the   (.) controls wrong. [laughing] He pressed square root instead of equals  [] .
*PHI:	Yes.And so you've discovered 
*DAV:	Eh!
*PHI:	the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine.But do you know what square root means?
*DAV:	What?
*PHI:	Well the square root of a number
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	is the number which if multiplied by itself
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	gives you back the number you started with.Take, for , the easiest one is   (.) four.The square root of four is two.Try it on your machine.
*DAV:	Right.What do I press?
*PHI:	Four   (.) four, square root   (.) and it gives you two.Because two times two   (.) gives you four.Try the square root of nine. (.) Just press clear.
*DAV:	Yeah, I just press this one.
*PHI:	Yes.Clear that bit.
*DAV:	Cos it clears the whole mind.
*PHI:	Right.
*DAV:	What shall I press?
*PHI:	Nine   (.) square root   (.) is three.So if you multiply three times three   (.) you get nine.Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	the square root is four.
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.That's the number which multiplied by its  (.) self
*DAV:	Right.
*PHI:	gives you the number.Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six.
*DAV:	Oh yes.
*PHI:	Try and find the square root of six.What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be.Don't, don't press the button.Six.
*DAV:	Er er
*PHI:	What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?
*DAV:	Three.
*PHI:	No.Three times three is?
*DAV:	I don  (.) six, six. (        )  (.) It's three.
*PHI:	No.Three times three.
*DAV:	I don't know the answer!
*PHI:	Well look   (.) three   (.) three   (.) and three.So how many have you got?
*DAV:	Ten.
*PHI:	 [laughing] No!Plonker  [] !You've got nine.
*DAV:	I'm just going 
*PHI:	Anyway 
*DAV:	to check.
*PHI:	So, there you are.It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half.Which isn't quite right.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time.That gets very difficult.
*DAV:	Right.
*PHI:	Right.So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
*DAV:	Right, I'll show you.Ten   (.) square root   (.) is
*PHI:	Three point one six two two seven seven six.
*DAV:	Right.Eh eh.
*PHI:	Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six.Very clever.Useless for you though.You don't really need that information do you?
*DAV:	Well dad!
*PHI:	So what, what, what sort of information do you need?
*DAV:	Tt.Counting information.
*PHI:	Well, if you went out doing your favourite hobby.
*DAV:	Yes. (        ) an engine.
*PHI:	Pardon?
*DAV:	Getting in an engine.
*PHI:	Driving an engine.Now how would sums come into that?
*DAV:	What!You can't get sums in an engine's smoke box.
*PHI:	Mm.You could if they would burn.
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	Well you co 
*DAV:	I, I want to get clever with you.
*PHI:	Oh I thought you had been.Shall we turn that off now then?
*DAV:	I'll get   (        ) 
*JAN:	 (        ) on   (        ) City News there's gonna be something about trams in Manchester somebody wants to see.
*PHI:	Well is it the new ones or is it, on the television, or on the radio?
*JAN:	Yeah, on, on the television.Do you want to switch it on?
*PHI:	Do you want, no th are you interested David?
*DAV:	 [whispering] Yes  [] .Course I am, in anything like that.
*JAN:	Well I'm, I'm going up for my shower is that okay?
*PHI:	Okay, off you go.I'll come up soon and   (.) despatch David.
*JAN:	Sorry? ((tv on))
*PHI:	Oh!
*JAN:	What?
*PHI:	Is this the first part of the news or the second 
*JAN:	No.
*PHI:	bit?
*JAN:	It's the second half.
*PHI:	So there won't be much more?
*JAN:	No.Oh no, I mean it's about another   (.) another eight minutes.
*PHI:	Right.
*JAN:	I thought he'd want to see, (        ) take my shower.
*PHI:	Yes, off you go then.See you later.Right Dave, what do you want to do now while you're waiting?
*DAV:	Get really clever!
*PHI:	So how are you gonna get really clever?
*DAV:	I'm going to get two sheets of paper and two pencils  (        ) .
*PHI:	I haven't got time for a lot of stuff.Don don't be getting a lot out tonight cos you've got Julie coming.
*DAV:	They're not a lot anyway.Only two of them each.
*PHI:	Okay.
*DAV:	 (        )
