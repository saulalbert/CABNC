@Comment:	conversation #4 (Tape 003904)
*ADA:	She was about to but she found a sticker on book   (        ) 
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*PAU:	She comes out well on tape doesn't she?
*CAR:	Who Charlotte?
*PAU:	Mm.I didn't realise how clear her speech was until I heard it on the tape.It's really quite good actually.
*ADA:	Not bad. (.) 
*PAU:	Oh we'll do this one again. (.) 
*CHA:	 (        ) drop off   ((laugh))  (.) 
*ADA:	Cos it's lights and things isn't it?She was looking at er lights in Sainsbury's the other day. (.)  ((laugh)) It looked like that, didn't it?
*ADA:	Carol was swaying at her.
*CAR:	You missed that.I just swayed at her, and she    (        )  ((laugh))  ((music))
*CHA:	It's Conway Twitty isn't it?
*ADA:	Is it?Oh no. (.) How far back does this go, I suppose early fifties?
*ADA:	Er nineteen fifty six.I remember Conway Twitty.
*CAR:	Oh yes.You were in your cradle. (        ) Elvis, didn't he? (.) 
*ADA:	I don't think he ever recorded it, I think he just used to sing it at his, er sort of cabaret.
*CAR:	Well so many of these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that, that.Because there's one there, one on one of these that er either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel or someone, can't remember which one, probably Art Garfunkel as Paul Simon does all his own doesn't he?
*ADA:	Well he has done other people's.
*CAR:	Well there's one on there, I can't remember
*ADA:	Like for instance the, er, what do they call those two?Oh   (.) the two brothers.In the
*CAR:	Everley Brothers?
*ADA:	The Everley Brothers, that's it.You know, Wake up Little Suzie?
*CAR:	Oh yeah.
*ADA:	Well Simon and Garfunkel did that  (        ) 
*UNK:	Wicked   (.) far out. (.) it's a groovy record this.
*CAR:	Shut up. ((laugh))  (        ) 
*PAU:	Can't remember which one it is but I'll recognise it when I hear it.
*ADA:	He's doing very well, isn't he.
*CAR:	He is.Have to employ him full time.He's always quite good.
*PAU:	I just can't believe how daft he is.
*CAR:	I suppose you like that film. (        ) 
*PAU:	Yes. (        ) 
*ADA:	Forget it.
*CAR:	You're not having cake.
*PAU:	Does she like cake?
*CAR:	Well she's looking at it. (.) 
*ADA:	So how's things down at the  (        ) ?
*PAU:	Not too bad.Quite good actually. (        ) 
*ADA:	Yeah?
*CAR:	Keeping him busy out on estimates and
*PAU:	Yeah he's out   (.) all this week.Well, my dad won't pass them on to Terry.Me dad said he's had enough   (        ) Well, we were debating whether to give it to you or not.But I thought, well if Terry notices he might  (        ) .Well in fact two really big estimates  (        ) 
*ADA:	Who, Terry?
*PAU:	Yeah.And one wanted re-estimating, the other one wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done.We give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail.So she had a list of about five things she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest.But she's got about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes.So I worked out   (        ) and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to Terry to sort those out.And they're both, about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work.
*ADA:	Well you can't afford to lose them, can you?
*PAU:	No.
*ADA:	So what's going to happen then?
*PAU:	God knows.He said, I asked, asked, well I left a message on Saturday for him to sort them out didn't I?He already knew about that.And then I asked my father on Tuesday to remind him and he said, he'd already said he'd fetch them in on Tuesday.And he, my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning.But he's  (        ) , he just really has to get in touch with one of them   (        ) and tell them the prices.So I don't know. (        ) Well, I mean he'd done, he's done this first estimate, these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in, you know they're well keen on our prices.
*UNK:	 (        ) they can't pursue it till we come back to them.
*PAU:	They're not pursuing it until we put these things out. (        ) My father just turned round   (        ) I've had enough of it if Terry's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to Brian.I said yeah then I get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to Terry and then there's an argument.If he, if he says anything to me I'll just have to tell him.But he's not doing the estimates he's been given and he can't afford to throw money away.It's cos he's working for him at the moment   (        ) money.He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him.He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way. (.) I mean Brian's pulled in a lot of work. (        ) lot of people kind of saying come back again on Thursday   (.) So he's, he's  (        ) .If we got Terry to do that we'd be well away.They, they would love him I mean one of them   (.) it was annoying really cos Terry's just not pulling his weight. (.) 
*UNK:	I don't understand it, if I live to be a hundred I won't understand it.
*PAU:	And also, it's cos that, you know after we had that row about Terry, after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop, and er he's already owing Brian a day?Guess who's doing the extra day? (        ) got my dad to cover a day.And then he takes a day off Bank Holidays. (        ) and he can't do it because my dad  (        ) .But then tomorrow he's actually doing his own work.So he could easily have  (        ) .And on Monday 
*ADA:	So who's covering tomorrow?
*PAU:	Well my brother's covered practically all week and Brian's doing tomorrow. (.)  (        ) Terry phoned up asking what, Tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering.And he said well my father is doing today I can't do today I'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be going in. (.) I mean he hasn't been in the shop once this week. (.) Somebody's got to tell him to    (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*ADA:	So do Dave and Terry   (        ) in the shop  (        ) .
*UNK:	They have the records. (        ) 
*ADA:	And it hasn't been sorted yet?
*PAU:	Oh no.He's got the gall to phone up on Tuesday and say Eileen can't do a day, we're going to be short of Eileen.
*ADA:	So the answer is to just phone them.
*PAU:	I can't do it.
*UNK:	I'm not doing it. (        ) 
*ADA:	What's the point of carrying on like that?
*PAU:	Well he's going to carry on like that isn't he?Not unless someone puts their foot down.
*ADA:	And if your father is currently taking your side of things   ((baby shouting))worth sounding him out as to how far he'll take  (        ) 
*PAU:	Ah  (        ) 
*ADA:	whilst he's in the mood?
*PAU:	Yeah.He's not being that much  (        ) 
*ADA:	You sure?
*PAU:	Mmm.He's probably only in the mood cos he's probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings.On a Wednesday evening, don't they.Cos Terry 
*ADA:	I mean , wouldn't he rather have Terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway?
*PAU:	It's not being fair  (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) do any work.
*ADA:	Oh what, your dad?
*UNK:	Pauline's dad   (        ) er   (        ) 
*PAU:	 (        ) too expensive I think.Terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often, uses my dad   (        ) ticking over running when he  (        ) 
*CAR:	Why  (        ) .He does get the offer, I mean   (        )  ((baby shouting))
*PAU:	 (        ) two months and she phoned up and I kind of made out it got lost in the post.I erm   (.) got, check you've got two days, you've got give me the estimate, it's got to be on because she's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent.And he actually got that one done.Do you know it was only five lines.I mean I could have made it up it was that easy.So I sent that off.She was in first thing, I mean I sent it off that evening she was in first thing the next morning yes that's fine  (        ) .So he's got that job and another one  (        ) .
*CAR:	She's trying isn't she? ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	I don't understand why it surprises you, that's what gets me.I mean   (        )  (.) 
*CAR:	It's normal behaviour  (        ) . (.)  ((laugh)) Charlotte's done it too. (.) 
*ADA:	Can you pass me that er, sheet?
*CAR:	This?
*PAU:	Is that your reading?That's not your regulations you have to read is it?
*CAR:	Oh no, that's a  (        ) 
*PAU:	I was going to say that doesn't seem very thick  (        ) 
*CAR:	No, that's to do with this tape.
*ADA:	Oh I tell you what is quite funny these, the act.
*CAR:	Mmm.
*ADA:	Oh. (        ) hereby enacted   (.) her gracious majesty, you know, etcetera etcetera.What was it, the Lords temporal and spiritual, that's what they call themselves.
*PAU:	Now that is, that's  (        ) 
*ADA:	Yes.Yeah I realise and I hope   (.) I don't come into contact with too many acts of parliament. (.) 
*PAU:	Oh, we had someone round to see the house yesterday.
*CAR:	Oh yeah?
*PAU:	They came twenty minutes early, there's Brian up in the shower, there's me stuffing things in the cupboard under the stairs.
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) That's an old trick.
*PAU:	I said to Danny, don't open the door.Don't open the door!So as I'm still trying to stuff things away, she opened the door and everything fell out. (        ) look round the front room, then they looked round the, the garden.While they were looking round the garden I   (        ) you've got to get out the shower quick.
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*PAU:	I don't know.They'd come down from, they'd come down from, (.) erm, somewhere or other.They're just doing a kind of tour of loads and loads of houses cos they keep moving with his job.
*CAR:	Oh, right.
*PAU:	She quite, I think she liked the area, she was saying about the schools and that. (.) Mind you, she likes erm   (        ) and they're all separate, all the best ones round here are  (        ) .She said don't they have any details?So I said well, no it's not   (        ) now is it, it's erm, oh it's that school that the  (        ) .Something and School of Arts now it's called   (        ) well technical
*ADA:	School of Arts round here?
*PAU:	No it's another, well technical, (        ) 
*CAR:	 (        ) performing arts here.
*PAU:	 (        ) performing arts and that's the technical
*CAR:	It's a monstrosity.
*PAU:	Oh you rotten old pig, you've been sick.
*CAR:	Oh she hasn't?Oh.
*PAU:	Yeah, it's alright. (.) 
*CAR:	 (        ) is it washable?
*PAU:	Yeah, I think so.
*ADA:	You'll soon find out. (        ) 
*CAR:	Yes.Do you feel better now?Obviously. (.)
