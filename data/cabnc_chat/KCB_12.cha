*JOY:	Ann hasn't 
*ANN:	Oh Graeme!
*GRA:	Ye

*GRA:	meals and 
*ANN:	ev evening meals, things like

*ANN:	that.
*GRA:	the lunches over weekend.
*JOY:	So, the thing is you shouldn't be such a good cook Graeme!
*ANN:	That's right!
*JOY:	That's the trouble!That's what I tell everybody, when they say to me, oh no, (.) you know, we never go out for a meal!I say well   (.) shouldn't be such a good cook!I mean, there's quite a few husbands I know that absolutely hate being out!They only like their wives' 
*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*JOY:	cooking!And I said, you know, well   (.) if you weren't a good cook, he'd be glad to   [laughing] go out and have one  [] !
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*GRA:	Ah, but that's no consideration for the cook then is it?Cos she would like to go out and have a meal 
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*GRA:	that somebody else has 
*JOY:	Yes, that's it!
*GRA:	cooked, shouldn't she?

*HAZ:	Well tha , they did that quite well I thought.
*ZAR:	Yeah!
*HAZ:	Doing it properly in that.
*ZAR:	Yeah.Didn't have an awful of trouble with that   (.) six er, six pages of dialogue which   (.) sometimes they're speaking together and sometimes they're
*HAZ:	speaking alternately.
*ZAR:	they're they're speaking alternately and er, it was 
*ANN:	Oh dear!
*ZAR:	it was very difficult!
*GRA:	Mm.
*ZAR:	Very difficult
*GRA:	Needs good 
*ZAR:	indeed!

*GRA:	Yeah.
*ZAR:	you know?Yeah.The sitting room was on a   (        ) at the stage.

*ZAR:	Yeah.It all went quite smoothly that bit.Well I tell 
*HAZ:	I was 
*ZAR:	you
*HAZ:	wa we 
*ZAR:	wouldn't be my choice of play but erm   (.) i it 
*GRA:	Yeah.

*ZAR:	No!
*HAZ:	No!
*ZAR:	No!
*GRA:	No!
*ZAR:	 (        ) , but

*UNK:	Hello Barbara.
*UNK:	All the best!
*UNK:	Yep, er yeah 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	isn't it shocking!
*UNK:	Yeah.
*ZAR:	Hello!
*UNK:	Yeah.Hi! ((phone rings))
*GRA:	Oh, it's a
*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*GRA:	just trying to sort out this business of this   (.) the offices   (.) that we're being let in the Strand Theatre that er   (.) people are moving in this week and they've got no authority to move you see.
*ANN:	Really?
*GRA:	This is what Ni , I spoke to Nigel about on the phone on Friday and said he could 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*GRA:	stop it, so   (.) so he had to erm   (.) just talk to our solicitors this morning and try and get this sorted out   (.) between the two solicitors.
*ANN:	Did you get through to him?
*GRA:	Yes, yes, got through.Well not David it's a er, Susan    (.) got 
*ANN:	Mm.
*GRA:	Susan.
*ZAR:	Have you read it now cos I shall have to 
*UNK:	Hello!
*GRA:	So erm 
*ZAR:	take it back?I can't do it, can you do these
*UNK:	How have you been, alright?
*HAZ:	That a bathroom cabinet up there?
*ZAR:	 (        ) 
*GRA:	so they're, you know, explain the situation to her because it's between the two solicitors to sort out now and get the writ, writ sorted out before   (.) anything could be signed to   (.) to allow them to   (.) move in.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*GRA:	It's a tricky situation actually because
*ANN:	Well what do you say the 
*GRA:	the lease 
*ANN:	the  (        ) ?
*GRA:	well th the, the people who have the actual lease of the offices   (.) have gone out o er   (.) gone out of business in a sense, they're no longer operating   (.) and   (.) because, they were part of a bigger organization, that bigger organization guaranteed the rents.Now this bigger or , this other organization which   (.) wants to put th  (.) er   (.) another tenant in as in a, as a sub-let to their lease
*ANN:	Yeah.
*GRA:	and, I am saying that   (.) they haven't got the lease
*ANN:	Yeah.
*GRA:	even though they might be part and parcel of the same organization, they are not the leaseholders so they can't   (.) make the arrangements, so if they want to make the arrangement they must have the lease assigned to them first, then we will come to terms with them over land and to under le  (.) under let.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*GRA:	But, you know, they're just being   (.) going on as if they are   (.) i in a position to grant
*ANN:	To do.
*GRA:	to do!And, having said that we haven't, at this moment, approved an under-let anyway, so
*ANN:	No.
*GRA:	But, you know, the situation is difficult in that   (.) if the   (.) people did move in there's   (.) not a lot you can do about it because   (.) it would mean that   (.) you would have to surrender the lease, which means you've let   (.) the guarantors off the hook for paying the then   (.) and you're left without a tenant whatsoever.Erm it's, it's trying to get an amicable solution to it.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*GRA:	Oh.
*ANN:	Darling, will you get me a   (.) a scone, another scone   (.) teacake 
*GRA:	Teacake.Aha.
*ANN:	and erm   (.) and a   (.) coffee.
*GRA:	Okay.Okay.
*ANN:	Can you er pay, pay 
*GRA:	Ye yes.
*ANN:	er
*GRA:	Yep.Teacake, I don't remember   (.) ooh ah, toasted teacake, oh it's fifty five.What do you have, tea or coffee?
*ANN:	Coffee.
*GRA:	Coffee?Hundred and seventeen, a hundred and seventy two again isn't it?So I will pay that. (.) What have you done to yourself that hurts?
*UNK:	Put my back out again!
*GRA:	Put your back out?
*UNK:	Yeah.
*GRA:	Oh!One seventy two.
*UNK:	Is it?Oh right! ((laugh)) 
*GRA:	Thank you madam.
*UNK:	Thank you.
*GRA:	Thank you.
*UNK:	You oft are you?
*GRA:	I'm off now, yes.
*UNK:	Okay then.
*GRA:	Mm.Yes, yes 
*HAZ:	Anything 
*GRA:	yes.
*HAZ:	exciting at the office?No! ((laugh)) 
*GRA:	Oh well, yes.
*ANN:	Well lots of mail.
*HAZ:	Lots of mail?
*GRA:	Lots of mail.An interesting situation which I've just explained to Ann, whereby at the weekend   (.) there's a set of offices in the Strand Theatre which   (.) the company that we're operating from there so  (.) stopped 
*HAZ:	Can you manage?
*GRA:	business
*UNK:	Yeah.
*GRA:	but they're part of a much bigger organization who 
*HAZ:	Mm.
*GRA:	was guaranteeing the rent, so the rent   (.) has been paid even 
*HAZ:	Paid.
*GRA:	though the office 
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*GRA:	has been vacated   (.) and they wanted to grant an under-let to another
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*GRA:	body of people to try and reduce the rent they were paying   (.) erm   (.) but it, it's er, it's initially a difficult situation that we have said yes we don't mind you   (.) erm   (.) we don't mind granting you that, but   (.) we want to know   (.) if you will accept an assignment of the lease   (.) from the previous company cos 
*HAZ:	Mm.
*GRA:	from our point of view   (.) in nineteen ninety three, we have to deal with somebody over a revision of the rent   (.) and if the company doesn't exist   (.) it makes it very difficult!
*HAZ:	Yeah!Yeah.Quite!Yeah.
*GRA:	You see, so   (.) these people were going to move in at the weekend so had to put a stop to that cos they had no authority to move in there   (.) until the solicitors try and get this thing sorted out.
*HAZ:	I wonder what they'll do?
*GRA:	But it ma , it's a   (.) it leaves you this interesting situation in that   (.) if   (.) they had moved in   (.) what do you do, cancel the lease and get them out?Which means the guarantor no longer has to pay you the rent so you   (.) you don't really want to forego that either, yeah.
*HAZ:	So you really, bit of a clever stick aren't you?
*GRA:	Yes.
*HAZ:	Yeah.Very, very  (        ) .
*GRA:	However, it'll all come out.
*HAZ:	It'll come out in the wash I guess!
*GRA:	Right , yes.
*HAZ:	 ((laugh)) 
*GRA:	So there we are.
*HAZ:	There we are.Well thank you for your company this morning madam.
*ANN:	Thank you, yes.
*HAZ:	And erm   (.) It was nice!
*ANN:	Oh I enjoyed sitting 
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*ANN:	with you!
*HAZ:	Cos we weren't that busy that we were able to devote a little bit of time.
*GRA:	Ta time.Oh good!Jolly good!
*HAZ:	It's lovely!It was very nice.
*GRA:	Yep.So, we'll go home now.
*HAZ:	Yeah.
*ANN:	We'll go home.
*GRA:	Go home   (.) to a nice tough, clean house shall we?
*ANN:	Thank you.

*ANN:	Yeah.
*HAZ:	and it's all clean 
*ANN:	Lovely!
*HAZ:	and sparkling

*HAZ:	Yes.You too.
*GRA:	Right.
*HAZ:	See you tomorrow then 
*GRA:	She was let off
*HAZ:	yeah.
*GRA:	she was let off lightly this morning cos there was hardly any   (.) ironing to be done you see, because I haven't worn 
*HAZ:	Oh, so she had that.
*GRA:	shirts all week really. ((laugh)) 
*HAZ:	 ((laugh))  (.) So she can have a little bit to do   (        )
