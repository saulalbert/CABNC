@Comment:	conversation #19 (Tape 062307)
*ANN:	That I can get repaired, rather  •265585_265806•
*UNK:	Ah! •265837_265840•
*ANN:	than just  erm, I like, reason I'm going for that one is my washer  is very similar looking •265920_266360•
*UNK:	Yeah. •266363_266379•
*ANN:	and it and it, you know, it's about the only one that looks anything like it. •266434_266763•
*UNK:	Mm. •266778_266791•
        Yeah, well I'm it's made in the U K isn't it? •266890_267119•
*ANN:	Yeah. •267125_267148•
*TRA:	Yeah. •267148_267182•
*UNK:	I mean it's got to be  the other, of course will be  probably  it's  a good machine. •267182_267535•
*TRA:	it's getting parts and everything  •267645_267754•
*UNK:	Yeah. •267909_267936•
*TRA:	int it? •267950_267980•
*UNK:	And then, you can always take out the extra insurance with er, no but it isn't very much for a tumble-drier, for five years  and there's no problems that way. •267984_268695•
        Absolutely none! •268695_268765•
*TRA:	No. •268765_268778•
*ANN:	Yeah. •268778_268798•
        And what do you do like, about, buy now, and pay July, what does that entail? •268828_269295•
*UNK:	Well what that means is, first of all it's no deposit •269305_269480•
*ANN:	Yeah. •269480_269535•
*UNK:	free delivery •269562_269606•
*ANN:	Yeah. •269606_269691•
*UNK:	and then erm  in July, you you don't have to pay out a ha'penny till July and you can either pay cash and get your sixteen percent off free  or you can pay terms from July. •269697_270518•
*ANN:	Oh! •270569_270594•
        Yeah, well I'll probably pay cash, it's just that electric bill's and gas bill's in. •270609_271126•
*UNK:	Yes I know. •271127_271159•
        I know ! •271167_271203•
*ANN:	And I, if I pay cash I wouldn't, you know, •271232_271393•
*UNK:	Yeah. •271405_271417•
*ANN:	I'm wondering if I'll be a bit short. •271417_271609•
*UNK:	Well, well you can always pay with terms if you want. •271609_271879•
        But there's nothing to stop you, if you take it out on terms, there's absolutely nothing to stop you coming in and paying, as long as you pay  before July, or by July  you get  •271879_272649•
*ANN:	Yeah. •272686_272692•
*UNK:	your sixteen percent off free. •272692_272792•
        But then also you've got, you, if you take it over say, twelve months you've got like a  •272792_273175•
*ANN:	Yeah. •273175_273189•
*UNK:	big safety net underneath you if you, if you find that you don't want to pay it in cash. •273189_273512•
*TRA:	Yeah. •273512_273520•
*ANN:	I mean, I know it's sort of the cheapest •273520_273685•
*UNK:	Right. •273685_273693•
*ANN:	and maybe, you know, that's not such a good thing, but  we were looking at the Phillips, erm  •273699_274310•
*UNK:	Mhm. •274319_274358•
*ANN:	but it's not, like that's got dual heat settings  •274405_274696•
*UNK:	Mhm. •274703_274727•
*ANN:	on int it? •274750_274807•
        That doesn't  •274807_274831•
*UNK:	That's a auto sensor dryer that's why. •274831_274985•
        It automatically turns the temperature down of the drying. •274986_275260•
        You get a choice on that one. •275266_275427•
        That's why. •275427_275656•
*ANN:	Yeah. •275657_275658•
*TRA:	Mm. •275658_275679•
        There's more  to be done on that than there is on that, really, cos  . •275679_276415•
*ANN:	Yeah. •276415_276428•
*UNK:	Mm. •276443_276452•
*ANN:	Probably. •276491_276520•
        Yeah, you're probably right. •276520_276645•
*TRA:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	It's just that my dad repairs mine. •276647_276872•
