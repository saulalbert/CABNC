@Comment:	conversation #19 (Tape 062307)
*ANN:	That I can get repaired, rather 
*UNK:	Ah!
*ANN:	than just   (.) erm, I like, reason I'm going for that one is my washer   (.) is very similar looking
*UNK:	Yeah.
*ANN:	and it and it, you know, it's about the only one that looks anything like it.
*UNK:	Mm.Yeah, well I'm su it's made in the U K isn't it?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*TRA:	Yeah.
*UNK:	I mean it's got to be   (.) the other, of course will be   (.) probably   (        ) it's   (.) a good machine.
*TRA:	 (        ) it's getting parts and everything 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*TRA:	int it?
*UNK:	And then, you can always take out the extra insurance with er, no but it isn't very much for a tumble-drier, for five years   (.) and there's no problems that way.Absolutely none!
*TRA:	No.
*ANN:	Yeah.And wha what do you do like, about, buy now, and pay July, what does that entail?
*UNK:	Well what that means is, first of all it's no deposit
*ANN:	Yeah.
*UNK:	free delivery
*ANN:	Yeah.
*UNK:	and then erm   (.) in July, you do you don't have to pay out a ha'penny till July and you can either pay cash and get your sixteen percent off free   (.) or you can pay terms from July.
*ANN:	Oh!Yeah, well I'll probably pay cash, it's just that electric bill's and gas bill's in.
*UNK:	Yes I know. [laughing] I know  [] !
*ANN:	And I, if I pay cash I wouldn't, you know,
*UNK:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I'm wondering if I'll be a bit short.
*UNK:	Well, well you can always pay with terms if you want.But there's nothing to stop you, if you take it out on terms, there's absolutely nothing to stop you coming in and paying, as long as you pay   (.) before July, or by July   (.) you get 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*UNK:	your sixteen percent off free.But then also you've got, you, if you take it over say, twelve months you've got like a 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*UNK:	big safety net underneath you if you, if you find that you don't want to pay it in cash.
*TRA:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I mean, I know it's sort of the cheapest
*UNK:	Right.
*ANN:	and maybe, you know, that's not such a good thing, but   (.) we were looking at the Phillips, erm 
*UNK:	Mhm.
*ANN:	but it's not, like that's got dual heat settings 
*UNK:	Mhm.
*ANN:	on int it?That doesn't 
*UNK:	That's a auto sensor dryer that's why.It automatically turns the temperature down of the drying.You get a choice on that one.That's why.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*TRA:	Mm.There's more   (        ) to be done on that than there is on that, really, cos   (.)  (        ) .
*ANN:	Yeah.
*UNK:	Mm.
*ANN:	Probably.Yeah, you're probably right.
*TRA:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	It's just that my dad repairs mine.I mean 
*UNK:	Oh right!
*ANN:	you know, and if 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*ANN:	if, as she says he's repaired it so many times!
*UNK:	Oh course!Course he does!But that's that one.
*ANN:	I want something that   (.) that I can look at that for.Erm   (.) yeah can I
*UNK:	Yeah.
*ANN:	go with that one?
*UNK:	Do you want the insurance on it as well?
*ANN:	Erm   (.) yeah, may as well.
*UNK:	Yeah alright.
*ANN:	If it's, if it's not expensive. ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Hi!
*UNK:	It's about the   (.) drier
*UNK:	Yeah.
*UNK:	with the  (        ) .

*UNK:	Er, er er er er 
*ANN:	It's one or the other.
*UNK:	Te er ten, yeah.
