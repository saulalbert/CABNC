*JEM:	No cos I only got it this summer cos my other one was nicked, my other one which had all my really nice visas in it, which I was really   •164272_169222•
*GIL:	I ordered mine from Nigeria. •169222_171942•

        I love that passport. •173382_174702•
        This passport is just fucking excellent, I love it. •174702_179002•
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Well yeah, just because of the  stamps in it and stuff, like real memories and things. •179002_184322•
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Oh shit you've lost yours totally? •185002_187792•
*JEM:	Yeah it was nicked. •187792_189392•
        Stolen. •189652_189822•
        Gone. •189942_190032•
*GIL:	Oh you would have thought though they'd send it back. •190032_191872•
        Do you know what I mean? •191872_192472•
        I mean that's so stupid not to send it back. •192472_194262•
*NAN:	Where was it stolen from? •194262_195212•
*JEM:	Well these, these these are the kind of people who nicked my address book which was sitting on my seat and which looked quite nice which wasn't in my bag, they nicked that. •195212_201082•
*NAN:	Where was it stolen from? •201082_202152•
*GIL:	But that's so pointless cos it's got all the addresses, your addresses in it. •202152_205142•
*JEM:	Yeah. •205882_205982•
*GIL:	It's such a tossy, you sure it wasn't in the bag? •205992_207862•
*JEM:	Yeah I'm absolutely positive, I remember leaving it on the seat. •207862_212352•
        It was stolen from my car, my car was broken into   •213352_215672•
*GIL:	How long did you actually leave the er  how long were you away from the car for? •215672_220212•
*JEM:	Erm well it happened some time between about  two and six  •221592_225622•
*GIL:	It was a bit silly to leave your bag on the front seat though. •225622_231752•
*JEM:	Yeah but we were sitting in a er we were in a cul-de-sac in a nice area •231752_234092•
*GIL:	Yeah you don't think do you? •234152_235602•
        You don't think at all. •235602_236412•
        Mind you, my mum was telling me, on Christmas day, right, Christmas day! •236962_240492•
        Erm  you know that Georgian house on my road on my side of the road, up the road? •240542_245832•
        Looks way out of place. •246182_246972•
        Well not as way out of place as a British Telecom building would look but, it looks quite  erm looks quite out of place , but erm this massive great obnoxious Georgian building  erm  was broken into on Christmas morning right? •246972_262152•
        They picked the lock  on the house, the front fucking door . •262152_265612•
        All the people were in bed in the house, woke up in the morning, the front door was wide open, the video and T V had gone, and the stereo. •265612_271142•
        And so they they came into the house when everyone was asleep. •271142_274132•
        That would freak me out so much, you just wouldn't feel safe in your house ever again would you? •274522_279072•
        Cos equally a rapist could pick the lock and come in and, and  do you know what I mean? •279072_283942•
        Er you'd just feel  I couldn't believe that, thought fucking hell. •283942_290872•
        So my dad's having all the locks changed. •290872_292052•
        Stepped up the security in our house. •292092_294592•
        Outrageous. •296312_296532•
*NAN:	stepdad? •296532_297082•
*GIL:	No stepped up the security  in the house . •297242_300222•
*NAN:	Oh  •300222_300512•
*GIL:	Hey Nance, Nance, Nance, Nance, you know you were telling me that you thought someone had died  at work? •301442_306212•
        I, I  sort of heard  Debbie and Chris talking the other day, and I might have got it totally mixed up, but I reckon, I heard Chris saying  that, well basically what I gathered was that Andy might have a different father to Chris and it was Andy's father that's died, right? •306212_323372•
        Cos Chris was saying things like oh his, yeah he's been to the funeral and erm he's all of a sudden found that he's got loads of cousins he didn't even know about. •324282_331922•
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*JEM:	What, so he did, he didn't   •331922_336422•
*GIL:	But I wonder if I wonder if Chris and Andy, cos Chris and Andy's half brother is Steven who's Debbie's husband, I'm wondering if they knew that  they had different fathers. •336432_345112•
        Cos they don't call each other they're half brothers. •345112_347022•
*NAN:	Maybe  yeah. •347022_351562•
        Well Andy's, look how Andy's got ginger hair. •353422_355712•
*GIL:	Mm. •355712_355862•
        Chris is dark and sort of like totally, doesn't look anything like Andy. •356122_361382•
        Not even one similarity. •361382_363412•
        Totally like •363412_365032•
*JEM:	And what, they're supposed to be half brothers are they? •365032_366522•
*GIL:	No they're supposed to be brothers. •366522_367752•
*NAN:	But I reckon they've probably lived like brothers from a young age. •367752_369892•
        Cos look how much  •370212_371202•
*GIL:	Yeah, oh yeah. •371202_371752•
*NAN:	older Chris is than Andy as well. •371752_372452•
        Well he isn't that much but he's a good nine years. •373092_376172•
        Nine, ten, eleven years older than Andy. •376172_378662•
*GIL:	So maybe they did know. •379062_380042•
*NAN:	Yeah I reckon they did. •380042_381692•
*GIL:	And just sort of like did, just called people  •382772_384572•
*NAN:	Or Andy may er Andy, Andy may be adopted or something like that. •384572_387292•
*GIL:	Yeah maybe. •387682_388472•
        But it's just strange that Steven's called their half brother and they're called brothers. •388472_392592•
        Do you know what I mean? •392592_393402•
*NAN:	Well maybe, yeah, but maybe Steven  is er is a half brother through a third marriage erm  at a later stage to when they  his mum er they're er Chris' mum may have remarried, who Andy calls mum, erm remarried when Andy was  you know, fifteen and Chris was twenty five and then they, and Steve was old as well, Steve was quite  however however how old Steve is, he   •393402_417152•
*GIL:	So then he'd be a stepbrother. •417302_418172•
*NAN:	Oh. •421742_422092•
        mixed up. •422122_422402•
*GIL:	Maybe we don't know. •422692_423542•
        Maybe we're just gossiping. •423612_424952•
*NAN:	Maybe we're just damn fucking nosy. •426042_427442•
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	It was funny cos I could hear them talking and I was really sort of like •427442_430932•
*NAN:	So obviously then, I reckon it must be his dad  and that's obviously why Andy  saying oh look your dad's died   •431212_439442•
*GIL:	Yeah. •439762_439822•
*NAN:	Cos Chris doesn't seem that bothered really, does he? •440292_441892•
        Maybe he wouldn't know him. •441892_444012•
*GIL:	Mm. •444012_444132•
        Maybe Andy didn't know him. •444352_445132•
        And he just went because it was  his father's funeral. •446052_448592•
        But then why would he have to go to the morgue for an identification, he wouldn't know what he looked like. •450042_452962•
        Maybe he's next of kin. •454052_454942•
*NAN:	 (        )  ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	Stop it . •457072_457492•
*GIL:	Aren't we nosy though? •462562_464472•
        Aren't I nosy I mean. •465332_466842•
*NAN:	I better go  •467852_468502•
*JEM:	Right, good luck. •468602_470912•
*NAN:	Yeah. •470912_471032•
*GIL:	You bloody lay into them. •474482_475672•
