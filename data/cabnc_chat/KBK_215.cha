@Comment:	conversation #216 (Tape 002924)
*CHR:	I'd be intrigued to know what those other two couples who were not informed about the cancelled christening feels.
*NOR:	Yes  (        ) 
*CHR:	Or not unless they join in wholeheartedly with the other lot.
*NOR:	Perhaps they turned up outside, looked in and saw nobody they knew and went away again.I can ask Mary when I see  (        ) 
*CHR:	Mhm.Has it been said that they hope to repeat the experience or  (.) ?
*NOR:	I think they're more concerned that the baby has an operation now.
*CHR:	What what is the situation there?
*NOR:	Some time in June.I expect they are waiting to called.
*LYN:	You like some more coffee?
*CHR:	Yes please.
