*VAL:	Like Andrew  (        ) .
*AND:	Yeah, that was, that was similar sort of ride   (        ) hard bloody work.
*VAL:	Yeah.
*AND:	All right up round here ideal, up and down the bumps over the guard, but when you get it out on the road, very hard work, similar sort of ride, well I suppose it will be, run around the   (        ) you've gotta push around   (        )  (.) 
*SAN:	Alright if you're double fit I suppose, and you've got a bit more help to   (        ) around.
*AND:	Yes.
*VAL:	 (        ) 
*AND:	I only took three quarters of an hour to get there. ((sniff)) It took about just over half an hour to get back.How's that for   (        ) straight down   (        ) Lane, straight over   (        ) lights up   (        ) hill, along the top here. (        ) 
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*AND:	Well it's still not bad at  (        ) . (        ) cold last night, (        ) , far old long trot down from   (        ) hill, (        ) innit?The Bells, it's all down hill until you hit   (        ) all down hill.
*VAL:	 (        ) 
*AND:	Yeah  (        ) . (        ) nice and  (        ) , nice, but even then they couldn't really  (        ) .
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*AND:	Well I want something in between, like the old sports  (        ) , straight down the bike job.
*SAN:	Well is he gonna ride on one man's  (        ) ?Mind probably more comfortable than the base weren't they?
*AND:	I   (        ) got used to them.I, yeah, I drove up, up there and back, like, my leg don't ache, they ached a bit at a time, but that, you know that bone you get, each side of your   (        ) keep your thumb there, you've got that bone, underneath there's a bone there, you might, or the bottom bone that you'll sit on, you know when you sit still you get that bone.
*SAN:	Tail bone.
*AND:	No, the bottom here, you've got two, you've got two, just in there, in there you got the bones.
*SAN:	Pelvis.
*AND:	Might be the bottom of your pelvis, in there.
*SAN:	Yeah.
*AND:	Bloody hurt it bruises, you sit on it and it doesn't, I thought I might, I suppose after a while you'll get blisters but it's bruised, when you sit on the bloody thing.
*SAN:	And they sit 
*AND:	To get a softer saddle you might get other problems.You might get other problems.
*SAN:	You get sore bones sitting down on anything.
*AND:	Oh can do, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*SAN:	Especially for me.
*AND:	Yeah, oh crikey, yeah.
*SAN:	They all   (        ) ride back.
*AND:	 (        ) 
*AND:	I thought we're gonna   (        ) so we came out of Paul's place, behind Belmont Parade, up past the ponds there and that's   (        ) and I'm knackered, I'm going up   (        ) river, had no   (        ) you start at the bottom of Belmont Parade, up those ponds up to the traffic lights where you change buses, that's all up hill and it's slow, and you've just started and you're not warm and it's like running out of here, running up that hill there, now you could run up that hill if you got, if you had sort of round a couple of times round nice  (        ) , no one so more   (        ) ready to go, you'd run up there, you come out of here, run down here, not warm, feel you get, well I come out of there and  (        ) , and you get, you go up past that set of traffic lights, you go up and you're still struggling past The Bull, that's still up hill, you get to the, just round that bend and it starts dropping down, and it's a gradual drop down, below the roundabout and the next roundabout's pretty level there, not too bad a roundabout, right the way across to Scades Hill, went down Scades Hill, right the way down to Alton, bottom of Alton high street, came out by the toilets at White Hart   (        ) to High Street, up to  house.
*AND:	Mhm.
*SAN:	That's a bit of a drag.
*AND:	Yeah.
*SAN:	That's a bit of a long drag that one, not that   (        ) Paul take open up a bit there and go a bit faster, level, but that was a bit Well's done a left up to Chell's Field and that, bloody that killed him, I bet, you know the bit I mean, and up over the fields, where you go through the fields and   (        ) fields, that was the killer, cos   (        ) and coming back   (        ) Bell's straight round to  (        ) , got to the bottom, (        ) Hill wasn't too bad.
*AND:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	It's a short, sharp, you can see it there, you get to   (        ) the top of it, get up to your roundabout, we hang a right, and the next, it's a bit of a drag all the way up, you save coming, coming the other way it's down hill, from just past The Bull, until you get to the  (        ) , almost to that junction you turn off the top and you're going up hill, just slowly, but cor, you get up to that, our junction, she drops down, we went straight down through the High Street, and we hung a right in the one way system, turn left, didn't get, quite get to Green Lane, turn left and up we come round the Green Lane, up and in the back way.
*AND:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	Mm.I say, it took us three quarters of an hour to get there, three quarters of an hour to get there, just over the half an hour getting back.Mind you got short   (        ) that was a killer up round by    (        ) place.I reckon we got down from The Bells, Chell's Field, to the bottom of  (        ) , six, seven minutes.
*VAL:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	Might be a bit more than that, but erm, could of been nine.She said   (        ) wouldn't get up   (        ) hill   (.) How these blokes go   (        ) I don't know, (        ) aren't they?
*AND:	Mm  (.) 
*SAN:	Mind you, it's the bloke in the front keeps   (        ) don't he?Keep tucked in behind the side   (        ) always said to you, the bloke in the front, mate, he does all the donkey work, picking up   (        ) drags you round don't it?Whether he punches hole in the wind, in the air or not I dunno, like cards.
*AND:	Yeah.
*SAN:	He does seem eager, up behind some, long as you get a right distance, too far and you get oh, they're fighting it again, whereas you can get right up.We were thinking of   (        ) the car, a slower car, could overtake a   (        ) by getting up behind you, and when you coming out, as soon as he comes out
*AND:	Yeah.
*SAN:	he's got to go back again.
*AND:	That's what I thought.
*SAN:	But they don't, do they?You get, or you get two cars of equal speed, along straight
*AND:	Well it's a memento innit?
*SAN:	one get, yeah, one gets up behind it and can   (        ) in the back I suppose, but they go after they, and then, you think as soon as you pull out, you're gonna get all that, yeah, he's gonna get all that, but they don't do they?They don't  (        ) .Gotta be a reason for that I suppose.Cos they're going flat out when they're like that, it's not like you gonna say like, when you go on a  (        ) , like overtake mode, when you're like that, they are flat out down the straight, all you go to get a   (        ) out.
*AND:	Mm.
*SAN:	It's not like 
*AND:	He goes 
*SAN:	Yes, it's not like he's going, he's, he's going faster than this geezer, he's not, he's getting a drag from him, then all of a sudden he comes out and he goes faster you think, (        ) explain a little bit more on the old  (        ) .
*AND:	I really don't know.
*SAN:	 (        ) same   (        ) lines, but, he know he  (        ) , you assume that as soon as you got outside him, that bloody draft would come round and push him back and the other bloke would carry on.
*AND:	Yeah.
*SAN:	We might have a bit of a winner tonight.
*AND:	Mm, (        ) pretty quick aren't they?
*SAN:	They're first and second  (        ) .
*AND:	Yep.
*SAN:	 (        ) tend to blow up do they?Mansell tends to break him don't he?
*AND:	Yep.
*SAN:	The other bloke tends to run out of road a bit don't he?
*AND:	Aye we
*SAN:	Bit erratic innit?
*AND:	Yeah, he's not a real charger is he?
*SAN:	No.The only thing that I will do, that he might do, he might keep, cos once   (        ) gets away mate that's   (        ) he might keep him behind.
*AND:	Mm.
*SAN:	Yeah, (        ) not used to driving behind is he?
*AND:	No.
*SAN:	He's always had to keep that bloody thing  (        ) .
*AND:	Yeah.
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*AND:	Ferrari   (        ) or something.
*SAN:	Yeah  (        ) .
