*NON:	Can I  •133795_133849•
*NON:	the patient looks  outside in  and carer  looks inside out. •133849_134520•
*DEN:	Inside out. •134874_•
*NON:	Right. •134985_135013•
        And here's, here's his journey right. •135067_135243•
        G P appointment, outpatient appointment, tests, admission, medical treatment, nursing care,planning and follow-up. •135243_135835•
*NON:	And that's the patient from his journey out? •135835_136188•
*NON:	That's his journey right? •136190_136310•
        Here, he's looking in  how he came, where is it? •136310_136782•
*DEN:	Route. •136782_136792•
*NON:	Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba •136877_137238•
*NON:	But is it the round window, the square window, or the arched window? •137243_137405•
*NON:	There's one. •137405_137480•
        Da, da, dee dee dee. •137485_137602•
        Right, it says here,quality can only be assured ,beg your pardon,if both patient's view, he's looking  •137602_138253•
*UNK:	in there. •138276_138309•
*NON:	Right. •138309_138322•
*NON:	in, and the care-givers view looking out are in agreement . •138337_138724•

*UNK:	Yeah. •139041_139069•
*NON:	That's right. •139069_139150•
*NON:	To achieve this  quality assurance should mean, that when the patient feels his care is not good  he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized, and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately . •139151_140605•
        And that's these things here. •140605_140770•
        There's patient questionnaires, complaints, da da, er  ba la  visitor inspections, complaints, patient questionnaire, there's a  basically all the same kind of thing, or relative survey. •140770_141855•
        Patient questionnaire. •141855_141972•
        So, basically, what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain. •142032_142888•
        My criticism of that being is •142888_143077•
*NON:	But what if it's not carried out? •143077_143275•
*NON:	it's, it's the quality's not there to start with. •143280_143502•
        How can you •143515_143585•
*NON:	He he won't know what, what quality of care is though. •143585_143907•
*NON:	Well er, the patient has his views about what •143944_144189•
*NON:	Yeah. •144189_144220•
*NON:	he expects, good nursing care  •144220_144394•
*NON:	But his views aren't really gonna be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know  •144394_144800•
*NON:	No, everybody's individual. •144801_144882•
        And to get, what it says here, to get quality assurance, the patient's views, and the care-giver's views have to be in agreement. •144883_145496•
        What, say you're the care-giver and I'm the  •145496_145747•
*NON:	Yeah. •145747_145759•
*NON:	patient  what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care. •145759_146116•
*NON:	But what you know is not gonna be the same. •146116_146250•
*NON:	It has to be the same for quality assurance. •146255_146318•
*NON:	But it's not gonna be the same. •146318_146489•
*NON:	But that will  •146489_146517•
*NON:	Yeah cos you  •146517_146649•
*NON:	I tell you what I think •146649_146716•
*DEN:	It says on our research thing  •146716_146792•
*NON:	say that, say that erm    . •146792_146926•

*NON:	Well, see, for one is she's not erm  as bad as that. •147984_148241•
        You know, some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital •148241_149008•
*NON:	Mm. •149008_149017•
*NON:	and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them, but it's not. •149033_149462•
        If, you're taking all   •149462_149557•
*NON:	Yeah. •149592_149610•
*DEN:	Mm. •149611_149612•
*DEN:	And when he goes into  •149612_149778•
*NON:	Plus they also say that a nurse is always  •149805_150085•
*NON:	 (        ) 
*NON:	busy  and they're angels, and they're, that and the other, that they won't complain. •150085_150462•
*NON:	Well that's the only way that this can be  assessed, is by, so that the patient  blah blah la    when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry . •150462_151533•
        But complaining, I mean, if he's gotta complain it means that  quality assurance isn't there. •151533_152031•
*NON:	But •152031_152071•
*NON:	This is only thing if they've got something to complain about. •152071_152386•
*NON:	if you were the patient  nurse  •152386_152600•
*NON:	So there's nothing to actually say  •152600_152724•
*NON:	In a positive sense? •152724_152841•
*NON:	Yeah. •152860_152872•

*NON:	says •153051_153060•
*NON:	Yeah. •153060_153066•
*NON:	erm   meaning ha blah blah  and action taken . •153066_153373•
        It should also mean that when Mr , that's it, says the nurses were marvellous, the nurses are able to say in all evidence, and with evidence to support their opinion, yes  •153373_154339•
*DEN:	We were crap! •154339_154426•

*DEN:	good or not, because as long as it was pretty clean. •156081_156273•
*NON:	Let's have a look what examples they're using. •156273_156436•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*NON:	Well that's what I was trying to say, because all the patient doesn't know what to expect anyway. •156436_157038•
*NON:	I mean, the patient wouldn't know whether it was like clean   •157038_157254•
*NON:	Well these are the criteria leaves for tests and investigations for tests and investigations, for example good facilities, up-to-date working equipment, nice staff, competent qualified staff •157254_157947•

*NON:	written and verbal information, appropriate tests, no complications . •158227_158381•
        But not necessarily the procedure itself. •158381_158747•
        If you, if you were the patient you might say it's wrong because erm  she doesn't look like she knows what she's doing or  there's a mistake or  something gets missed. •158770_159637•
*DEN:	Yeah. •159637_159642•
*NON:	You know. •159642_159744•
*NON:	But I mean, on that, well I think it's   •159793_160101•
*DEN:	Well I think the whole point of it is  •160101_160283•
*NON:	erm, the patient's not gonna know that I'm, first of all, not gonna know anything about nurses, •160283_160792•
*UNK:	Yeah. •160792_160801•
*NON:	Because he didn't, he stayed cos they class him as an A person. •160813_161328•
*NON:	And he might take a personal dislike to one of nurses. •161328_161560•
*NON:	Yeah. •161623_161650•

        It's all the same really. •176685_176873•
        And it, it looks upon nurses feel about  their own standard of care  and, the article then goes on about •176886_177513•
*DEN:	Standard they provide? •177601_177743•

*DEN:	Mm. •177837_177874•
*DEN:	the patients. •177874_177947•
        And then it goes on about setting up  the single but dynamic standards  a setting system it's called, divided into  local level groups like a tier system, you get the Managing Director on the top  and the ones at the bottom. •177948_179389•
        And they're called quality assurance, or standard setting teams  made up of volunteers •179397_179835•

        The main base made up of volunteers from the local wards like nurses and  well I mean  nurses and auxiliaries  like that. •180120_181402•
        But it's  bring, it says things about care  and assessing that quality care's being met on their ward and  the hospital itself  and  about once every six months to meet up with •181402_182617•
*DEN:	 ((clears throat)) 
*DEN:	other members of other hospitals in the area and discuss  different aspects of  raising the standards  of care. •182621_183325•

        But there's one  one fault really it takes approximately fifteen to eighteen months for them to pass  anything like that  and that could be one •185427_186257•
