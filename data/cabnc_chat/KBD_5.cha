*BAR:	Yeah.
*KEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	Got no er   (.) no change at the moment that's the only problem.
*KEN:	Yeah, always seem to be going for some er 
*BAR:	I just send er 
*KEN:	What's it?Alan.

*BAR:	How many 
*KEN:	 [laughing] Ain't he  [] ?
*BAR:	were on the bus then?
*KEN:	It was absolutely jam-packed full by the sta the standing, I didn't count them.
*BAR:	No, well 
*KEN:	Will it be ab be about ninetyish I would think.
*BAR:	Mm.
*KEN:	Ninety, ninety two summat like that.
*BAR:	Yeah, we had like fifty in before, fifty, or sixty.
*KEN:	Before the bus come?
*BAR:	Mm mm.
*KEN:	Came?Yeah, it's picking up again nicely.
*BAR:	Mm.Well it's a bad time of year ain't it since Christmas?I mean January 
*KEN:	Yes, yeah that's a point.
*BAR:	anyway, I mean, and then all the sort of   (.) ups and downs with the   (.) press publicity etcetera.
*KEN:	Mm.Course, yeah.Yeah.One or two have mentioned on Thursday actually so I think   (.) best we're open well before.See how that goes when they feel it.
*BAR:	Well I was just talking to Jean about that today, I mean I   (.) we've gotta keep on doing it but, I think that 
*KEN:	Yeah, if you stop now you'll get nowhere with them will you?
*BAR:	No that's right.But I mean I think we, I think I, I will need on Monday morning to talk to   (.) er Morecambe Bay   (.) and see if I can bring forward these promotions because 
*KEN:	Yeah.
*BAR:	until I start 
*KEN:	Yeah.
*BAR:	I mean, we should get them back.
*KEN:	You can't,al also I think you should start doing, having people regular again wi it's just 
*BAR:	I know.
*KEN:	not worth it.
*BAR:	The trouble is it's a bit of a catch twenty two because     (.)  ((sigh))  (.) if you don't put a bus on, will you get the people?
*KEN:	Mm.It's what you do innit?That's the problem with it. (        ) 
*BAR:	 (        ) the bus for er
*KEN:	I mean nobody actually 
*BAR:	and nobody on it.
*KEN:	nobody's actually said to me a  (.) well where, where's the bus on a Thursday?Nobody's said it yet.When they 
*BAR:	Mm mm.
*KEN:	start asking
*BAR:	Mm.
*KEN:	then that transport you could ask about putting it back on again.
*BAR:	I mean what a what I think I'll probably do is if we can get like erm   (.) something that's obviously   (.) our crowd and then   (.) either   (.) putting, say, Stella back on or something like that
*KEN:	Mm.
*BAR:	and banging it out   (.) for one   (        ) 
*KEN:	Can you not stick a band on   (.) pretty soon or nothing like that?
*BAR:	Well
*KEN:	People would think we were
*BAR:	frankly I'm not sure where that stands  (        ) .I mean talking to Charlie, just asking about   (.) getting some   (.) student bands on
*KEN:	Yeah.
*BAR:	might be an idea cos remember when we had that thin Mar 
*KEN:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	when we had that thin Martin's band on.
*KEN:	Yeah, but I was in   (        ) 
*BAR:	I mean 
*KEN:	gonna say, stick them back on cos they 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*KEN:	went down really well.And they brought a big following down didn't they?
*BAR:	They brought a big following.Yeah, that's right.
*KEN:	Er, I mean if you, if they, if they 
*BAR:	There was about a hundred with thin Martin on the other hand.
*KEN:	Yes.Yes.It was a really good night that.If you make it known that there's stuff like that going on, if you get a band like that you can always just 
*BAR:	Mm.
*KEN:	put a bus on for some people that come down.
*BAR:	Mm.
*KEN:	You get a couple of leads like that it'll start picking up 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*KEN:	up there.
*BAR:	That's right.So
*KEN:	Like ya, like you say it is a difficult situation at the moment innit?
*BAR:	Mm.
*KEN:	And what to do for the best.
*BAR:	Mm.Yeah.But I, I say if I get   (.) sh publicity I er   (.) if I say do, if I say   (.) cos we haven't got a premium lager on draft so if I stick Stella on draught
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	and then do it as an offer.

I was watching a programme the other day about it.They've developed a camera   (.) for your line   (.) for th for the mackerel, for the ma marlin and the shark fishing   (.) erm   (.) and basically you can actually watch   (.) you can, you can ac you've got a   (.) your T V screen so it, it's er, it's like a spectator sport as well cos you can actually watch   (.) the, the, the fish coming to take your bait.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	You know, so it's like yo you've got on this minute camera on the line and everything, you know so it, so that you can actually get the excitement of watching it   (.) you know, coming and taking 
*KEN:	Can we have a little bit of a discount?
*BAR:	Yeah you can.Course you can.
*KEN:	How much is it then?
*BAR:	Couple of quid each.
*GRO:	 ((laugh)) 
*KEN:	Couple of quid each!Couple of quid each!So we can start
*BAR:	Shark fishing's only   (        )

*ALA:	Yeah.Fair enough.
*HUG:	 ((laugh)) 
*KEN:	No!
*ALA:	Well isn't it?
*KEN:	Well I did   (        ) 
*BAR:	The guy was talking to Pete, he thought he could, he develop, he could develop for coarse fishing 
*HUG:	Bye bye.
*BAR:	er, you know river fishing and that as well, there's spa special camera.
*ALA:	Well where does the actual camera hang off?
*BAR:	It's hung, it it's hung,i i it's actually not below the boat but, but it 
*HUG:	Oh!Sure can.
*BAR:	get it, you see, but i it's   (.) fantastic watching cos   (.) you know they were   (.) they, they   (.) it was sort of going along the
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	whatever they were using as bait   (.) presumably some mackerel or something like that but, but as I was saying you could see it trailing through   (.) and then all, suddenly out of like nowhere this fish would come and like   (.) chase after it 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and snap and this, this would go off and you'd be sat there going right then, you actually 
*ALA:	Well presumably 
*BAR:	see it take it, you know 
*ALA:	the camera eye would be adjustable would it?Or
*BAR:	I presume so, yes.I mean they was talking about getting a really small for erm
*ALA:	Oh right.
*BAR:	you know, to be, to be used in   (.) in sort of coarse fishing and that.
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	But, of course, the other thing of course ,i it takes out the, the one that got away cos you actually see the one   [laughing] that got away 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you know  [] ?
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	There'd   (.) be some story then. ((laugh)) 
*ALA:	You know what'll happen is   (.) your camera would 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	the cameras'll magnify it anyway won't it?
*BAR:	Yeah it will.It will do.Yeah.Yeah.But it was really, I mean it, it meant of course that   (.) the other people on the boat could have some enjoyment as well, cos I mean, there's nothing worse i if you   (.) if there's only one rod out, or two rods out th those boats there's only like a couple of rods out int there on, on 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	those   (.) for the marlin and the   (.) and the sharks and that, fishing?
*ALA:	And you don't get many.
*BAR:	Yeah.And it's not like, sort of 
*ALA:	Three   (.) there'll be
*BAR:	twelve
*ALA:	three or four maximum 
*BAR:	twelve rods out, yeah.
*ALA:	something like that.
*BAR:	Yeah.So any anybody else that's going on board is bored out their brains basically!But at least 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	if you got T V monitors you can watch what's going 
*ALA:	Watch it.
*BAR:	on.
*ALA:	That's really good.
*BAR:	So now, now I mean   (.) now with all the radar and   (.) whatever else we're using, I mean   (.) you should really be able to find fish.
*ALA:	Well that, that boat from Evesham that we went out on a couple a years ago it had a fish finder on it.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	So   (.) it er, (        ) fish finder on it.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	You throw your line out, you don't get a few just biting.
*BAR:	No.No, that's right.That's right.They've done   (.) most of them are   (.) I mean the wo certainly the ones on the little   (.) little boat trips and that, I mean, they have   (.) all it does is that   (.) it'll tell you there's some fish about, I mean, it doesn't 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	tell you where to fish or 
*ALA:	Oh no.
*BAR:	depths or anything like that does it?What they're doing is   (.) there's some fish down there somewhere.
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	Cos that's the most frustrating thing about fishing is when you're like   (.) you know, you could be wasting that, you, you think to yourself like I could be wasting a whole, there's not a fish anywhere round here! [laughing] You know, you could be sat here like an idiot today 
*ALA:	Well that's it I've I've sat on 
*BAR:	for hours on end  [] .
*ALA:	Jay hours on end in middle of night freezing
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	you know like    (        )  (.) and I've caught nothing.And you've 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	thought well   (.) there's plenty of crabs   (.) in
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	summer, take your bait
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	but every time you throw out   (.) there's a crab on end of it.You know 
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ALA:	you think, why does that crab always have to come my line.
*BAR:	 ((laugh))
