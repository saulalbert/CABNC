@Comment:	conversation #11 (Tape 002011)
*CHR:	Have you tried them on already? •6365_8305•
*NOR:	Not yet. •10215_11525•
*CHR:	I like the look of it very much. •15635_16475•
*NOR:	Oh. •16475_16525•
*CHR:	or something. •21145_21455•
*NOR:	No . •22405_22485•
*CHR:	Fits nicer than that one. •42245_43215•
        Do you like it? •43215_45715•
*NOR:	Well I'm asking you. •46375_47325•
*CHR:	Yes I like it. •47605_48265•
        I like it. •48575_48855•
*NOR:	Well you think it fits alright? •48855_50285•
*CHR:	It seems to me to fit perfectly. •50285_52195•
*NOR:	And the colour's not too drab? •52195_53525•
*CHR:	I don't think the colour's drab at all. •53635_54735•
        I think the colour's fab. •55195_56225•
*NOR:	Right. •56225_56525•
*CHR:	Looks just fine to me. •57885_58855•
*NOR:	Yes. •58925_59035•
        Mm. •59815_59895•
        I'll just slip on another one. •59895_62325•
*CHR:	I like it. •62325_62605•
*NOR:	It wasn't too expensive. •62605_65255•
        Thirty pounds, twenty-nine ninety five or something. •65535_69185•
*CHR:	Good. •69185_69395•
*NOR:	Which isn't a bad price. •69995_71165•
*CHR:	Did you try, do you try any of them on in Marks? •71235_73365•
*NOR:	No. •73365_73815•
*CHR:	What's the material like? •73955_79345•
*NOR:	I don't know. •79345_79555•
        . Now this one  I've realized now  is actually meant for wearing  outside because it's got a bit of shaping here, see? •79555_93225•
*CHR:	Oh I see what you mean, yes, yes. •93225_96075•
*NOR:	Erm but whether that  couldn't wear it outside with this •96075_100465•
*CHR:	Out out out or in presumably ? •100525_102105•
*NOR:	Presumably.. •102195_103025•
*CHR:	What do you mean? •105655_109525•
*NOR:	The collar ends in a point at the bottom in the styling. •109525_112675•
*CHR:	Oh I see. •112835_113205•
        Oh yes yes yes yes I do see what you mean, yeah. •113205_115705•
*NOR:	I will say it's cut shorter at the back. •115835_117955•
*CHR:	sort of waistcoaty in fact. •118085_123455•
*NOR:	. •_•
*CHR:	Well it looks fine tucked in like that. •123485_131395•
*NOR:	I mean there's not much of it to tuck in. •131725_133515•
        You know sort of  •133635_133925•
*CHR:	Well that looks very smart as it is. •146025_156725•
*NOR:	But you couldn't wear it out on this particular blouse •156725_161325•
*CHR:	Well  •161545_161815•
*NOR:	because of the belt. •163185_163385•
        If you wore the erm  •163385_164685•
*CHR:	Well try it. •164685_165135•
*NOR:	If you. •165135_165725•
        I will. •165785_165995•
        You think that the colours go and •166065_168285•
*CHR:	I think the colours go very well indeed. •168285_170025•
        I mean it doesn't pick up precisely the same colour but that in there  •170025_173585•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes it is. •173585_174685•
        Yes it is. •174765_175315•
        Yes. •175315_175395•
        But it clashes very well indeed. •175835_177795•
        Why can't you wear it out like that? •177795_182245•
*NOR:	Because you destroy the blouse, the the way that the belt  •182485_185145•
*CHR:	Well that doesn't matter if you've got your, if you've got your your jackety effect then haven't you? •185165_189454•
*NOR:	I suppose you could, if you were going to wear it like that, you could take the belt right off. •189475_193655•
*CHR:	Well you don't have to. •193655_195095•
*NOR:	Well no but you, it, it, it's quite a heavy belt and if it, if it's holding, if it's giving point to it. •195165_201345•
*CHR:	Yes. •201345_201435•
        And that would make it a, an even cooler outfit wouldn't it? •201835_204705•
*NOR:	Yes. •204705_204825•
        Because I have got this    this  this creamy shirt. •204895_218015•
        Erm  which I saw again in Marks this year  which you could wear tucked in with a belt. •218015_233895•
*CHR:	Yes. •233895_234165•
        Yes. •234495_234635•
        But that one is, is genuinely versatile. •234925_236665•
        Looks just as good tucked in as •236665_239295•
*NOR:	Yes. •239295_239605•
        As I say the problem with the tucking in on that one is there's not quite such a lot of length. •239605_243715•
        So when you do this you might come out. •243715_245215•
*CHR:	It'd start pulling out, yes. •245215_246395•
*NOR:	Erm and I don't think it looks good hanging out because it's, you, you paying in the skirt and the belt and that. •246685_253365•
        And it's a bit silly to wear er a permanent arrangement. •253365_256685•
        But this shirt could be worn with the skirt, couldn't it? •256685_261455•
*CHR:	Definitely. •261525_261585•
*NOR:	I mean the colour's just as, it's not quite as strong. •263265_265795•
*CHR:	the colour's pretty neutral isn't it? •265795_267285•
*NOR:	But I mean it does pick up. •267285_268705•
*CHR:	Yes. •268705_269045•
        Yes I think the skirt's gonna be very useful actually. •269375_271595•
*NOR:	Er  good skirt whether . •271595_277115•
*CHR:	Well I hope you will. •278025_279335•
        I like it. •279335_280185•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	It's the wrong green I think. •280185_287295•
        The actual skirt, the skirt's a blueyer green. •287295_290755•
        But you've got two blouses to wear with it, that's alright. •290795_294865•
        You've got this other white one as well. •295095_296785•
*NOR:	white one. •297105_298615•
        That's a short, that's your shirt. •299535_300435•
*CHR:	That's mine is it? •300575_301035•
        Mm. •301265_301345•
*NOR:	They're very good, that's the white one. •301345_302645•
*CHR:	Yes. •302895_303085•
        I would have thought •303875_304315•
*NOR:	This white one might  the cream one. •304315_306005•
*CHR:	Well so you've got four blouses . •306115_307535•
*NOR:	Which is the fourth? •307535_308805•
*CHR:	Well the one you just said is a bit old now. •308805_310885•
*NOR:	Oh yeah but that's white again isn't it? •310885_311755•
*CHR:	Yes. •312545_312605•
        No I think they're all worth  and I think that's an attractive top as well. •313285_316545•
        I think you should have that. •317015_317795•
*NOR:	Well erm. •317795_319375•
        What else . •319375_320205•
*CHR:	I don't know . •320565_325915•
        It's it's it's a possible winter or cooler  •327855_330385•
*NOR:	No it's not. •330845_331205•
*CHR:	weather skirt. •331205_331625•
        With a jumper or cardigan. •331625_332845•
*NOR:	No it's not. •332845_333445•
        cooler, warmer weather and it's got short sleeves you know. •333465_336095•
        I don't really erm . •336115_337095•
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOR:	That's wrong for that. •337225_343985•
        This has got a stain on it. •343985_346785•
*CHR:	That's a nuisance. •346945_348435•
        It would be perfectly acceptable otherwise. •348435_353575•
*NOR:	Yes and we've got big crease marks on there. •353785_370315•
*CHR:	Let's have a look. •370315_371495•
*NOR:	There. •371495_371635•
        I know it's there. •371815_374845•
        I know it was last year I was really annoyed. •374855_382545•
*CHR:	Put the light on. •384655_386635•
        . Well if we can't see it, it doesn't matter even if it is there. •386635_396875•
        N'est pas? •396875_397235•
*NOR:	Well you certainly can't see it. •400125_402975•
        Which is  cos there was this big round grease mark. •402985_407065•
        It was very  but maybe I got it out. •407065_410695•
        But I suppose that  might erm •410695_414195•
*CHR:	Don't you think they go well together? •414195_417595•
*NOR:	work. •417595_417755•
        Those colours are not too dark are they? •417755_419805•
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*NOR:	They're not perfect but they would do . •422515_424255•
        Oh what about this? •424305_426435•
        Mind you this skirt is only casual. •426825_430505•
        And that's a rather sort of formal blouse. •430825_434195•
        No that's wrong. •434195_435275•
        wrong. •436635_436775•
*CHR:	Oddly enough I mean it's so far away from the yellow I would say it isn't wrong. •436785_443345•
*NOR:	Oh it is wrong. •443345_444065•
        It's not, it's not the same as this at all. •444065_445705•
        That's sort of brilliant  •446155_447545•
*CHR:	That, that's a hot pattern and colour isn't it? •447545_450005•
*NOR:	That's a brilliant yellow, yes. •450005_450535•
        And this one's erm a sort of golder. •450535_451815•
        And that wouldn't do. •451815_454495•
        But that's colours go with that . •454845_456075•
*CHR:	Mhm. •456845_456925•
*NOR:	Those are the only . •458285_462655•
        And I'll keep this blue skirt  stain, quite smart. •463135_467435•
*CHR:	Yes. •467915_468145•
*NOR:	. •_•
        And I'll keep the dress. •468145_470525•
        And I'll think about the shirt. •470525_472665•
        I like it with the skirt. •473315_477495•
        What I might do is go back to Marks. •477805_479265•
        If they have one thing in that colour they may have another one. •479265_483285•
*CHR:	In what colour? •485705_487105•
        We were chatting. •487105_487795•
*NOR:	The gold  •487795_488005•
*CHR:	Are you, are you thinking of that because it's a bit too formal or something? •488005_491875•
*NOR:	No just because it hasn't got the length for tucking in. •491875_494985•
*CHR:	Oh, yes. •494985_495425•
*NOR:	And I don't like these that pull out when you  •496015_498315•
*CHR:	Well at least if it pulls out it looks alright. •498805_501175•
        It was interesting in the pub last night. •501175_516565•
        There were quite a lot of enthusiastic er  audience but er they were mostly grey beards like me. •516565_523885•
        Yes. •523885_524215•
        Oh yes well apparently they normally have a sort of rhythm and blues or something on a, on a Thursday. •524215_532505•
        Er or soul or something of that sort, which er  you know there were loads of youngsters in the pub. •533325_541245•
        Not under age youngsters I was pleased to see. •541245_543935•
        But er  there were a goodly proportion of people who were really enjoying the er, the track. •543985_551795•
*NOR:	I'm sorry I didn't feel up to going. •551795_553655•
*CHR:	Yeah. •553705_553785•
        Well we've got plenty of other, I've got the list. •553995_556145•
        opportunities to go and hear them again. •556145_559875•
        He's a funny character though. •559935_562595•
*NOR:	Who? •562595_562945•
        Who's a funny character? •562945_566095•
*CHR:	, who runs it. •566095_566845•

*NOR:	Oh, who runs the band. •579695_580795•

*NOR:	What happened to the old one? •583335_586255•
*CHR:	Oh, they move on. •588365_588985•
        Erm you know he found another pub. •588985_591135•
        Sometimes they move from being managers to being licence, erm erm tenants, I mean •591165_595425•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	when they're running their own business. •595995_598945•
*NOR:	A bigger pub? •598945_599555•
*CHR:	Perhaps but I mean the Crown is quite a big pub. •599555_602225•
*NOR:	more opportunities. •602225_602495•
*CHR:	Quite a big pub. •602495_603995•
        It's a, with its own kitchens and what have you. •603995_606405•
        I should think you could make a good living there if you wanted to. •606405_608535•
        And there have been long term er landlords there. •608535_611395•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Sorry? •611395_611495•
*NOR:	 (        )

*NOR:	Well she was going on the train. •634375_636275•
*CHR:	Didn't realize she was going quite so early but I suppose it's hardly early anyway now. •636435_640115•
*NOR:	What time does Lynda come in these days? •640115_642285•
*CHR:	Half past nineish. •642395_642935•
*NOR:	I wonder if she'll change her time because of half term and she won't have to be  taking her daughter to nursery school today, half past one. •643985_651845•
*CHR:	She may be. •652155_652765•
        Yes, yes she may be. •653075_654695•

*NOR:	I know she hasn't left all her customers. •686605_688545•
*CHR:	Oh quite, quite. •688545_689425•
        Does she have any other suggestions of shops for the linings? •690305_694185•
*NOR:	. •_•
        Well John Lewis probably will have it but that means  burdening Suzannah with it. •694185_700915•
        At a time when she's busy with her exams. •700915_703555•
        It also means sorting out the cash. •703555_706145•
*CHR:	How interested is she in the preparation of this dress? •706195_710585•
*NOR:	Oh she's interested alright. •710585_711555•
*CHR:	Interested enough to be enthusiastic and do the right thing? •711565_718175•
*NOR:	Well she, she also  •718175_718805•
*CHR:	Did she? •718805_718945•
*NOR:	but she is  preoccupied at the moment with her exams and in a way I'm glad. •718945_726775•
        I didn't want to  send her material hunting if she could be doing something useful at college. •726775_733225•
*CHR:	Yes, yes fair enough. •733275_736715•
        Anyway, O K  •736785_738805•

*NOR:	going in on Monday when she doesn't normally. •744315_746755•
*CHR:	Half past ten, right. •747005_748375•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Well given that then, in that case she still can't ring the bank to find out what, how much she's now got in the account. •748435_757885•
*NOR:	Can't she? •757885_758415•
        Why not? •758915_759085•
*CHR:	Well she can do, but she can't do it from home. •759085_761785•
        That's all. •761785_762195•
        She won't be home. •762285_762875•
