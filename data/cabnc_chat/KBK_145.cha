@Comment:	conversation #145 (Tape 002615)
*CHR:	They are, getting lots and lots of people to do it 
*DAV:	Mm. 
*CHR:	and it's going to be a record, simply a record of erm, English as it's spoken in nineteen ninety one, I've got a little blurb on it which I'll show you. 
*DAV:	Yeah. 
*CHR:	Having put a jumper on I don't know where to clip the blinking microphone now. 
*DAV:	It's an interesting idea, isn't it? (  )   
*CHR:	 Oh yes  . Yes and they   (.) they provided me with boxes of tapes and batteries and eh Walkman and so on and so forth and eh, I'm trying to be conscientious. ((laugh))  
*DAV:	Well I'm sure, I don't know whether it's sort of easy to wear when you're playing croquet or I suppose  (  )  
*CHR:	Ah well, if, if it isn't I switch it off. 
*DAV:	Yes. 
*CHR:	Dispose of it, it's eh, somebody's having a fete or something. Oh it's a funny old day today isn't it? 
*DAV:	Mm, it's not cold is it? I  (  )  
*CHR:	Well I thought it was when I went out and exercised the dog before lunch, I went up to Jubilee Park and eh, I had a very brisk walk indeed and I was absolutely lathered by the time I got back to the  car, after half an hour. 
*DAV:	 Yeah.  It's always perceptive on days like this, because it's overcast and eh 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	you tend to  thinking not very warm. 
*CHR:	 Yes  . Absolutely, absolutely. Your son had better things to do had he? 
*DAV:	He's gone into Bromley with my eldest. 
*CHR:	Aha. 
*DAV:	Jeremy does play croquet, but very infrequently. 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) . Just broken away from his girlfriend. 
*CHR:	Oh has he, ah. He seemed happy enough when I called. 
*DAV:	Well it was his doing so I suppose 
*CHR:	I see. 
*DAV:	Probably not be unhappy  with it, she is. 
*CHR:	 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha yes  , yes indeed, ha, ha, ha. 
*DAV:	Smart brake lights aren't they    (  ) car   (  )   
*CHR:	 I was just thinking what an  intriguing colour they were. 
*DAV:	Yeah. 
*CHR:	Fuchsia, would you call it? 
*DAV:	Yes, wonder why you'd want two double exhaust do you, I mean it's not a very big engine surely on those, Volkswagen is there? 
*CHR:	 Yeah, yeah  , it's all a bit of pizzazz I suppose. 
*DAV:	Mm probably only one of them is actually effective. 
*CHR:	Yes. Or   (.) or probably neither of them are connected. ((laugh))  
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Still a noisy little engine though, isn't it, my goodness. 
*DAV:	Well they always were, weren't they? But the 
*CHR:	Yes, yes. 
*DAV:	I mean I, my sister used to have one and she said you could take it on the motorway and it'll just keep up a, a very good speed still with a noisy engines and  then it just kept going and going and going. 
*CHR:	 Yes  , yes. 
*DAV:	They're like a Morris Minor aren't they?  I mean that's an incredible engine. 
*CHR:	 Oh yes, yes  . Did you see that the British High Commissioner of Sri Lanka has been chucked out of Sri Lanka? 
*DAV:	No. 
*CHR:	Er, he, there was a pic   (.) there was a picture of him on the report in the paper and he was sitting in his convertible Morris Minor. 
*DAV:	Oh  (  ) . 
*CHR:	And they are, they are very popular vehicles in Sri Lanka, and somebody's about to set up a factory there to make the  bulk of the parts   
*DAV:	 Yes. That's right  , yes I think I 
*CHR:	Rather oddly there are two or possibly even three Morris Minor centres who   (  ) parts, that's in Bath, they're, they've seemed to have concentrated in Bath rather, rather oddly. And I get erm, one of my customers in Trinidad runs a Morris Minor still. 
*DAV:	Really? 
*CHR:	And eh, he occasionally asks me to get bits  and pieces   
*DAV:	 Well they do  so, I mean, I know, I know the body shape is expensive to make because of the number of different panels 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	by comparison with modern cars. 
*CHR:	Surely. 
*DAV:	They just pick same extent   (  ) the Mini doesn't it? 
*CHR:	Yes, yes. 
*DAV:	That's why it is expensive compared to eh, other cars, but, ((cough)) they, they seemed to go on for ever those cars, I mean they're quite incredible aren't they? 
*CHR:	Yes, they, they 
*DAV:	They've certainly  the engine of it. 
*CHR:	 Tough, tough  little beasts aren't they? 
*DAV:	Yeah, yeah. 
*CHR:	And of course they've actually made eh, the bodies with er metal not tissue paper in those  days didn't they? 
*DAV:	 Yes.  But they don't seem to have some of these sort of inherent problems that other cars have had since, with eh, sections of the body that tend to rust. 
*CHR:	Really, yes, yes. 
*DAV:	Whereas I think cars now, because they give these guarantees on rust, they've certainly given it a lot of thought, but, I mean there was certainly models that were riddled with problems weren't there? 
*CHR:	Yes there were. Only the Mini when it first came out was a shocker wasn't it? 
*DAV:	Mm, yes. 
*CHR:	Absolute shocker. 
*DAV:	Today I was listening to the talk on the radio coming home, it last night, and the, there was a, representative from one of the largest eh, firms that transport new cars in this country 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	together with a representative of British Rail, and he was saying that, I, forget how many car transporters they've got that erm, they built, bought specially to go on British Rail, he said, but they said he just had to give them up for many reasons and one of them was the problems that they have with new cars when they take them on British Rail and the brake dust from the trains apparently causes immediate rust. 
*CHR:	Oh. 
*DAV:	So that you can put a brand new car on at eh, A and by the time it gets to the other end it's literally got rust problems. 
*CHR:	How curious. 
*DAV:	It seemed to me incredible. 
*CHR:	Yes, absolutely amazing. 
*DAV:	 Apart from the vandalism problems they've had, where whole trainload of cars have been stripped of the radios. 
*CHR:	Oh dear. 
*DAV:	Cos when they pulled into a slow section on the railway, the vandals have got on and just gone through the whole lot and taken the radios out. 
*CHR:	Yes, yes, British Rail have got big problems  in that way, haven't they? 
*DAV:	 Oh   (  ) yes. 
*CHR:	And rail   (.) railways really ought to be far better developed than they are in this country, eh. 
*DAV:	Well it seems the obvious means of transport. 
*CHR:	Absolutely, absolutely, but I mean, I   (.) I ship goods out of this country into the continent and further afield, erm, rail is just not an option that I can consider. 
*DAV:	No. 
*CHR:	It's er it's not feasible. 
*DAV:	That's what the representative said from the erm, the car transporter company, was that they   (.) they just couldn't any longer use British Rail because it, he said although British Rail are willing to compensate, it's delay of deliveries. 
*CHR:	It's  not the point is it? 
*DAV:	 They can't deliver  to their customers on time. 
*CHR:	Mm. Surely, surely, yes, and thirty, forty, fifty years ago, rail was an acknowledged method of shipping things into from Europe. 
*DAV:	Yes. 
*CHR:	And then there were people who specialized in it, I don't suppose from a moment there are now. 
*DAV:	 Yes.  No. 
*CHR:	They just 
*DAV:	Eh, (  ) , I mean there's a   (  ) idea the money that's been spent on the railways instead of on motorways we'd be a lot better off, and I think   (  ) and Partners subscribed to that because I think that erm, had more money being spent on the railways that we would have been much better off, oh I'd much rather go on a train journey than on a motor bridge journey. 
*CHR:	Yes. Yes.  Absolutely. 
*DAV:	 Sitting comfortably  get up and walk about, go and have your cup of tea or coffee. 
*CHR:	Surely, surely, it makes much more sense, you can read a book and 
*DAV:	There's still something   (  ) about railways  even though they're not steaming. 
*CHR:	 Yes  , yes I agree. All clear on the left  (10.0)  
*DAV:	Busy road isn't it this? 
*CHR:	Far too busy, yes. 
*DAV:	Perhaps I should have, you can pulled into this refuge in the middle there  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes, yes, it's, otherwise it's very neat here, you know in this, these little spaces are really incredibly small. 
*DAV:	Yes, yes, just stop and get some petrol. 
*CHR:	Aha.
