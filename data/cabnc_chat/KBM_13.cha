*CHR:	oh
*DAV:	I mean never stay in the right hand lane
*CHR:	why?
*DAV:	because you overtake is speeding there, the left hand lane isn't, the right hand lane is for overtaking

*CHR:	you've gotta start breaking when you see three
*DAV:	no
*LYN:	no one 
*DAV:	one, as soon as you get, well you've gotta work out what your speed is then, break, break your speed down to your stopping distance, say it's thirty, you wannae stop slowing down at   (.) forty five feet   (.) right, that's what you have to know   (.) erm  (.) 
*CHR:	well Darren you're cramming too much in me head right now
*DAV:	well ask me some then
*CHR:	it's cramming too much in, I'm getting confused, I get 
*DAV:	well I wanna learn new stopping distances here, no I'm not being funny Sharon
*CHR:	you know them, so why you asking?
*DAV:	well I want you to learn them   (.) it doesn't take much to learn them either   (.) going to learn them
*LYN:	I used to know them
*DAV:	right, here's your stopping distances   (.) read them, I'll give you till five to ten, got ten minutes
*CHR:	what that mean twen , is it metres or what? in metres 
*DAV:	go in feet go in feet it's better 
*CHR:	which ones that?, the red or the black?
*DAV:	what's the black?
*CHR:	mile an hour twenty, thinking distance twenty, what's it?
*DAV:	is it?, oh   ((cough)) think twenty, twenty, forty

*DAV:	take the distance the black well look   (        ) 
*CHR:	the black is feet 
*DAV:	the black is feet
*CHR:	right
*DAV:	right, twenty mile an hour right, shh twenty
*LYN:	the reds thinking distance in it?
*DAV:	no
*LYN:	there's one of them thinking distance in it?
*DAV:	you've got stopping distance, thinking distance overall you see
*CHR:	sshh
*DAV:	dead easy
*LYN:	should know that an all  (        ) 
*DAV:	three coloured line at the motorway, see the next, its stop, you're not supposed to stop, you're not supposed to stop the flow of traffic

*LYN:	thirty feet is it? in the town, thirty miles, sixty feet is it? (.) is it Sharon?
*CHR:	don't  (        ) 
*LYN:	thirty mile, that's sixty feet is it Sharon?

*LYN:	thirty mile an hour 
*CHR:	it's seventy five feet
*LYN:	seventy five

*DAV:	aye
*CHR:	how?
*DAV:	twenty mile an hour right
*CHR:	aha, goes to forty
*DAV:	your thinking distance, right your thinking distance is twenty
*CHR:	aha
*DAV:	right
*CHR:	aha
*DAV:	your stopping distance is thirty five
*CHR:	no it's not
*DAV:	your stopping distance for twenty miles an hour is twenty
*CHR:	no
*DAV:	it is and your overall is forty
*CHR:	well it doesn't say that
*DAV:	twenty, twenty, forty
*CHR:	what's that mean, so you, what you doing twenty mile an hour you think that you can stop in twenty mile an hour, at twenty feet
*DAV:	at twenty feet is you start braking it down 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	and then what's that mean braking
*LYN:	a hundred, a hundred and forty feet for seventy
*CHR:	it takes twenty feet
*DAV:	twenty feet to stop
*LYN:	it's a hundred and forty feet
*CHR:	then overall stopping distance, what does that mean then?
*DAV:	that's forty feet
*CHR:	what does that mean?
*LYN:	that's seventy miles an hour 
*DAV:	at forty at forty feet right
*CHR:	aha
*DAV:	you start slowing it down right, right
*CHR:	when?
*DAV:	and then, when you get to twenty feet, right?
*CHR:	aha?
*DAV:	now you start thinking then when you come to the junction and also you're slowing down, by the time you've done that, them two stages you should have all your gears ready and you should be prepared for it
*CHR:	so how'd ya work it out?
*LYN:	at seventy mile it should be your hundred and forty feet
*CHR:	shouldn't have 
*DAV:	no you shouldn't it should be three hundred and fifteen, the overall length, seventy is your think, thinking distance for that is seventy and your stopping distance should be two, four, five
*CHR:	how'd ya work it out Darren, you gonna tell us or not?
*DAV:	it's so simple
*CHR:	right, well it is
*DAV:	ere move up
*CHR:	I have er, I know, forty, a hundred and twenty two, (        ) seventy five a hundred seventy five and three  (        )

*DAV:	now ask you twenty, what, the thinking distance for twenty mile an hour right
*CHR:	forty
*DAV:	no it's not  (.) 
*CHR:	what then?
*DAV:	twenty
*CHR:	twenty
*DAV:	right, now your braking distance is twenty an all, right

*CHR:	I can get that one alright
*DAV:	thirty, right
*CHR:	thirty, forty five and seventy five
*DAV:	right, ask us, ask us any of them, you think the distance to stop
*CHR:	twenty
*DAV:	twenty 
*CHR:	twenty 
*DAV:	what's your braking distance?
*CHR:	twenty 
*DAV:	twenty is your braking distance and your overall should be the   (        ) there in the middle, which is forty, that's cos
*CHR:	oh you add one
*DAV:	aye
*CHR:	there and it's erm
*DAV:	thirty
*CHR:	thirty, forty five and seventy five, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy five 
*DAV:	now forty is a hundred and twenty, right
*CHR:	aha
*DAV:	so forty, forty mile 
*CHR:	that would be 
*DAV:	an hour right, so, your thinking distance would be the same mile as what?, your distance is forty and then
*LYN:	you want   (        ) 
*DAV:	take that off and what have you got, it leaves you eighty as your braking distance
*RHI:	oh
*LYN:	 (        ) all the time
*DAV:	seventy, right
*RHI:	I know
*DAV:	your thinking distance is seventy, now what's seventy ov

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	do you know what your braking, stopping distance
*CHR:	well I  (        ) 
*DAV:	 (        ) from what it is in the snow?
*LYN:	what?
*DAV:	you know erm, your stopping distances
