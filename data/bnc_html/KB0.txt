                           moderator was talking to me on the telephone
Margaret (PS002)           [55] Aha
Bob (PS006)                [56] I think it was yesterday

Margaret (PS002)           [63] Oh
Bob (PS006)                [64] erm, but er, you know,wh whether it'll be a
                           good thing to link up with somebody I don't know yet
Margaret (PS002)           [65] No
Bob (PS006)                [66] that's one of the things he'll want to talk
                           about
Margaret (PS002)           [67] Yes of course, er, you know this thing we've
                           been talking about joining with the
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Bob (PS006)                [68] Yeah
Margaret (PS002)           [69] do you think that's going to come to anything?
Bob (PS006)                [70] Well honestly I, I don't know because I haven't
                           been in the discussions
Margaret (PS002)           [71] No
Bob (PS006)                [72] before
Margaret (PS002)           [73] but, the ordinary, the congregation at St Jones
                           hasn't
Bob (PS006)                [74] Mm
Margaret (PS002)           [75] but erm, we've got friends in the Methodist
                           church and they told us things that er, you know,
                           absolutely
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [76] to us, er, whoever represents us doesn't come
                           any of the bring anything back and you don't know
Bob (PS006)                [77] Mm, well the thing is there's some similar
                           conversation going on in
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [78] are there?
Bob (PS006)                [79] but, er, I don't think they've got as far as
                           yours have
Margaret (PS002)           [80] No, oh, I mean personally I think it would be
                           better for the United Reformed to join up with the
                           shared pastures instead of joining up with the
                           Methodist because the Methodist have got plenty of
                           churches in their area, haven't they?
Bob (PS006)                [81] They have there, yes, and
Margaret (PS002)           [82] Yes
Bob (PS006)                [83] and the trouble is of course, they've, the
                           Methodist haven't really joined up themselves
Margaret (PS002)           [84] No that's true Alan, no, aha, I know, aha, and
                           they want to pay somebody a fee to do a service, how
                           many service have we had done? [laugh]
Bob (PS006)                [85] Oh
Margaret (PS002)           [86] We enjoyed the moderator very much when you was
                           a
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Bob (PS006)                [87] Good
Margaret (PS002)           [88] We

Margaret (PS002)           [95] Yes
Bob (PS006)                [96] I expect somebody from St. Jones will be
                           coached.
                           [97] How's Nigel these days?
Margaret (PS002)           [98] Well he's off sick as far as I know
Bob (PS006)                [99] Mm
Margaret (PS002)           [100] but, I did hear something, I don't know
                           whether it's true, that the doctors took him off the
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [101] because that, he wanted to go up for a medical
                           which was a bit erm, unethical [laugh] , but I don't
                           know whether it's true it's, you know it's just what
                           someone said
Bob (PS006)                [102] Oh
Margaret (PS002)           [103] it was on good authority, but you know you
                           got, the things get exaggerated
Bob (PS006)                [104] Yes
Margaret (PS002)           [105] I haven't seen him, I, I think they were away
                           at the weekend
Bob (PS006)                [106] aha
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...] [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [107] well he's, the last time I saw him was, was
                           being having, was trying to have a lot of fund
                           raising things
Bob (PS006)                [108] Mm
Margaret (PS002)           [109] and er , what's, what's the last one?
                           [110] Oh it was the Valentine's cover, it, it'll
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [111] and we'd all made different things, you know,
                           and there was loads of food, but his children wanted
                           one particular thing, well they were late coming in
                           and of course it had gone, so he, he wasn't very
                           happy [laugh]
Bob (PS006)                [laugh]
Margaret (PS002)           [112] and he didn't stay long and he didn't, he, he
                           did look terrible, he did really
Bob (PS006)                [113] Oh
Margaret (PS002)           [114] but, er, I don't see it, that kind of a job
                           which he's going to do, if it don't have
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [115] Hello

Bob (PS006)                [116] Hello, hello
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [117] and, looks so ill, it's not very [laughing]

Margaret (PS002)           [119] Well I hope so, yes
Bob (PS006)                [120] er, but I, I, I've heard that erm shingles
                           does have this sort of after effect
Margaret (PS002)           [121] Yes, aha
Bob (PS006)                [122] but you know, it takes a long while to get
                           over it
Margaret (PS002)           [123] Yes
Bob (PS006)                [124] but I hope he will because
Margaret (PS002)           [125] Oh, I hope so

Margaret (PS002)           [127] Yes

Bob (PS006)                [130] I mean he's, I think we'll miss him, but I

                           they took them to different specialist and the truth
                           is, they've both left school now and got jobs, but
                           they were er, dyslexia

                           realise, you know, it troubles the parents and as I
                           say they took them to a number of specialists and
                           given different things

Bob (PS006)                [312] Oh, oh
Alan (PS007)               [313] and er ... originally when, when we first
                           sought to retiring, retiring, we were attracted to
                           the Dales, but we couldn't afford that
Bob (PS006)                [314] No ... no this is the great problem of er ...
                           at the moment, oh it was C W M when you retired
                           wasn't it?
Alan (PS007)               [315] Mm
Bob (PS006)                [316] And erm ... and did they, had they got their
                           nanny form of assistance?
Alan (PS007)               [317] They had but it was erm, much less
                           satisfactory as a U R C one
Bob (PS006)                [318] Mm
Alan (PS007)               [319] but they've changed now, they're more or less
                           on the same basis as the U R C
Bob (PS006)                [320] Oh
Alan (PS007)               [321] but erm ... it didn't look a very attractive
                           proposition at the time
Bob (PS006)                [322] Oh
Alan (PS007)               [323] for one thing, if we'd taken one of their
                           houses and I'd died first, my wife would of been
                           left without a home
Bob (PS006)                [324] Oh dear
Alan (PS007)               [325] except for going to the er, you know, they've
                           got that place in Worthing erm
Bob (PS006)                [326] Yeah
Alan (PS007)               [327] erm
Bob (PS006)                [328] Yeah

Bob (PS006)                [330] Yeah
Alan (PS007)               [331] but we were, neither of us very keen on that
Bob (PS006)                [332] No not really, no ... Could you of chosen ...
                           erm ... where to have the house or did they have
                           some, that had been left for that purpose?
Alan (PS007)               [333] Erm, I'm not really sure, we didn't go into it
                           very deeply
Bob (PS006)                [334] No
Alan (PS007)               [335] Fortunately Ruth had some money from her
                           father which covered buying this house
Bob (PS006)                [336] Oh, oh ...
Alan (PS007)               [337] erm ... At that time property was fairly cheap
                           in Bradley
Bob (PS006)                [338] Mm, mm
Alan (PS007)               [339] we got this for seven and a half thousand
Bob (PS006)                [340] Oh, blimey, mm
Alan (PS007)               [341] I think it cost more than that now
Bob (PS006)                [342] Oh I think so, yeah ... you wouldn't purchase
                           the land that it stands on for that now ...
Alan (PS007)               [343] Mind you it's only a paper profit because you
                           can't rely on it
Bob (PS006)                [344] No, no ... Where are you from originally ah?
Alan (PS007)               [345] London, east London, East Ham ... actually I
                           was brought up till I was about seven ... er in the
                           same area, but erm ... in a place called Beckton
Bob (PS006)                [346] Oh that's where the gas works used to be.
Alan (PS007)               [347] That's right, yeah, just over, not far over
                           the water from er the Woolwich
Bob (PS006)                [348] That's right , no, yes, I know not far from
                           where we live really
Alan (PS007)               [349] Mm, mm ... and I often tell people that er,
                           those who don't come from London don't realise ...
                           the difference between north and south
Bob (PS006)                [350] Mm
Alan (PS007)               [351] south London they're two different worlds
                           aren't they?
                           [352] In a way
Bob (PS006)                [353] Yes
Alan (PS007)               [354] for the people who live there they are, anyway
                           ... the river's a great divide
Bob (PS006)                [355] Oh yeah ... Yes, it's amazing how a big
                           delight it is, despite all the bridges
Alan (PS007)               [356] Oh that's right, mm ... You didn't go straight
                           from college overseas
Bob (PS006)                [357] Well, as near as possible because, erm, I mean
                           I was appointed to, to Africa while I was still in
                           college
Alan (PS007)               [358] Oh, mm, mm
Bob (PS006)                [359] but then there was delay because of war
                           conditions
Alan (PS007)               [360] Mm, mm
Bob (PS006)                [361] so ... so it was nearly a year before we
                           actually got away
Alan (PS007)               [362] aha

Bob (PS006)                [403] the rules were not to do that, the ships
                           weren't supposed to stop because apparently the

                           beginning to discover that [...] will be [...]

Gethyn (PS009)             [732] [...] at the time.
                           [733] ... Shall we remember ... and these three
                           friends in life.
                           [734] ... [praying] Lord we thank you for the ways
                           in which you challenge and call people ... to all
                           forms of ministry within the light of your church.
                           [735] ... And especially we thank you today for the
                           call of Martin and Ian and Richard to the Ministry
                           of Word and Sacrament within the light of your
                           church.
                           [736] ... We pray for them and their families.
                           [737] ... We pray for them in their studies.
                           [738] ... In their pilgrimage to ... discover more
                           of your presence in their lives.
                           [739] ... As they begin a particular stage of the
                           ministry ... we also pray for those who are coming
                           towards the end of that particular stage of the
                           ministry.
                           [740] ... Remember especially Bob and Roy ... and we
                           pray that you will enable them to find fulfilment
                           and enjoyment, and enrichment ... in their lives as
                           they ... step forward ... in faith and confidence in
                           ... Lord in your mercy []
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [741] Amen.
Gethyn (PS009)             [742] Amen.
                           [743] ... Reports are not always about revolutions
                           ... and that's important!
                           [744] And you will see that we now have ... a good
                           ... erm ... [...] .
                           [745] ... Well, over to Noel ... to relax with each
                           other thoughts, questions, comments about the life
                           of the ministry of the church.
                           [746] ... And [...] happens ... some people have
                           prepared particular presentations, you will see
                           after one is on [...] , and one of political
                           insubordination, one on the process of learning
                           together.
                           [747] ... Five [...] districts have erm ... prepared
                           some of vision ... in order to ... share that vision
                           or that example of what is happening in the
                           districts, relating to the ministry ... erm ... with
                           the [...] ... and those who have come to us as well.
                           [748] ... And ... one church has prepared a ...
                           little presentation or ... mind-stretching, heart-
                           stretching thought of church and community.
                           [749] ... So we're, we're here now to relax.
                           [750] ... To talk about the Ministry of Office.
                           [751] ... I think, in starting this off, I would
                           like to ... encourage as many people to take place
                           in conversation, if possible.
                           [752] ... And I will include in that ... those who
                           are ... younger than most of us here.
                           [753] ... Er, to talk about what ... you think about
                           the ministry ... of the church as well.
                           [754] ... We're talking about this ... partly
                           because of the document passed in the ministry in
                           which, everybody has avidly read ... and erm ... has
                           been [...] talked about after the seventeenth ...
                           er, in York ... in July.
                           [755] ... But I think the more important reason for
                           talking about ... the Ministry of the New Church, or
                           the Ministry of the Church ... is because of the ...
                           erm ... developing needs and the ... developing
                           thoughts and ideas which are actually [...]
                           additions ... which are the, the crucial area ...
                           where ministry takes place.
                           [756] ... First of all, I think it would be useful
                           if we were clear ... that with the new [...] ,
                           ministry was a waste!
                           [757] ... Too often, we are limited in thinking of
                           ministry as those who ... either do or do not work
                           where [...] are thought of.
                           [758] ... And, we might call those Ministers, if you
                           like, with a big M.
                           [759] ... Erm ... but we'll be talking about the
                           Ministry of the Church.
                           [760] ... We're actually talking about, I mean, if
                           you remember this [...] , we're talking about ...
                           the absinity ... of the body of Christ.
                           [761] ... That is the Ministry of the Church.
                           [762] ... But each one that's here ... however old
                           or however young ... are a part ... an active part
                           ... an essential part ... a crucial part ... of the
                           Ministry of the Body of Christ.
                           [763] ... We are these.
                           [764] ... And how we relate ... within the church
                           ... and how we relate outside the church ...
                           although, in essence, there is nothing outside the
                           church ... there is nothing that that position [...]
                           .
                           [765] ... Okay?
                           [766] ... As you look into your shaving mirror in
                           the morning, you shall say, hello Minister, how are
                           you?
                           [767] ... Or as you look into your drawer in the
                           morning, to find out what you need ... to put into
                           your hand bag in the day, you say hello Minister,
                           how are you?
                           [768] ... Okay?
                           [769] ... That's [...] .
                           [770] ... We're also talking in terms of a ministry
                           ... which ... what you expect ... is very often what
                           you get ... you're trained to be somebody [...] ,
                           okay?.
                           [771] ... And one of the things that these trainings
                           help you [...] ... is that if you expect something
                           of a child ... then you're much more likely to get
                           it!
                           [772] ... That way it's positive.
                           [773] ... If you expect that child is going to ...
                           do a fantastic job ... on that painting ... then
                           that encouragement and confidence is coming across.
                           [774] ... It also works negatively!
                           [775] ... If you don't expect much from little Tommy
                           ... then, little Tommy is less and less likely to
                           give you anything much!
                           [776] ... So we're talking about ministry.
                           [777] We're talking about something which is bound
                           by our expectations.
                           [778] ... We need to be aware of our expectations
                           ... because our expectations can be ... limiting ...
                           and can be stretching and ... inspiring.
                           [779] ... We also are exercising the Ministry of the
                           Church ... within a context.
                           [780] ... We've learnt something about the church
                           and [...] .
                           [781] ... One of the contexts in which we are
                           exercising ministry is that we have ... for the last
                           fifty years ... well I haven't personally!
                           [782] ... But for the last fifty years or so ... for
                           most of us ... the experience of the church ... has
                           been declined ... and ... closer ... and ...
                           reducing number of people with dog collars.
                           [783] ... Okay?
                           [784] There have been negative interference.
                           [785] ... We need to be aware ... of how those can
                           actually triple the numbers.
                           [786] ... We need to be aware of how ... we are ...
                           subconsciously ... taught.
                           [787] ... A Geographer ... knows that ... and ...
                           the whole environment importance.
                           [788] ... A Geographer also knows that in order to
                           ... use maps ... you need to know ... where you are.
                           [789] ... You can't get anywhere without knowing
                           where we are.
                           [790] ... Half of our exercise in listening to each
                           other is to know where we are.
                           [791] ... In order that we can begin to recognise
                           ... the movements and the visions and the views ...
                           of where we can be.
                           [792] ... Knowing where we are in terms of the way
                           in which we are tricked into having ... bad [...] .
                           [793] ... Knowing where we are in the way in which
                           we are tricked ... into believing that erm ... our
                           churches now are weaker than when they were founded
                           ... and ... probably most of you, many of you have
                           heard my children's prayer. ... [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Gethyn (PS009)             [794] the children are the difference between
                           churches now and churches in the past.
                           [795] ... Especially at church anniversaries.
                           [796] ... [...] . ... And nine times out of ten when
                           I ask the congregation ... whether your church is
                           bigger now than it was when it was founded ... nine
                           times out of ten the congregation say, it is smaller
                           now than when it was founded.
                           [797] ... And nine point nine times out of ten they
                           are wrong!
                           [798] ... We've got a wrong ... false ... image of
                           the [...] .
                           [799] ... And that is harmful!
                           [800] ... And it's parallel.
                           [801] ... Those visions come from within ourselves.
                           [802] ... Come from the way in which we don't
                           necessarily take on board what we are learning.
                           [803] ... They come also from ... orgasmic enters or
                           whatever ... such programmes there are go around

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [807] Is it Derek Nimmo?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Gethyn (PS009)             [808] In the nineteen fifties.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [809] I never
Gethyn (PS009)             [810] Erm
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [811] I never watched it, in fact.
Gethyn (PS009)             [812] There's also the whole of notion of what we
                           are saying by our ministry together.
                           [813] ... Okay?
                           [814] ... What we are, what we are saying by our

Gethyn (PS009)             [816] [...] ... What we are saying by our notice

                           our attitude.
                           [819] What we are saying by ... the way in which we

                           [820] ... All of these are involved ... and a part
                           of our ministry.
                           [821] ... And, that again, might be me ... but many

Gethyn (PS009)             [823] Well that, that may be a reflection on me,
                           okay?
                           [824] ... But ... what are we saying by our
                           expressions ... both within worship and outside?
                           [825] ... And of course, our discussion of ministry
                           i.e. the activity of the people of God ... is not
                           just a domestic thing about the URC.
                           [826] I mean, we ... we get bound up with ... with
                           all sorts of domestic things, and will, I expect,
                           later today.
                           [827] But it's also ... erm ... about discovering
                           the completeness of the ministry of the people of
                           God ... as we enter through the various commitments
                           that we have ... to our sister churches ... in Wales
                           and in Britain ... and in the world, whether it's
                           routine or a particular relationship of members or
                           ... All that's part of the context ... of the ways
                           in which we're talking about ... and sharing with
                           each other with God.
                           [828] ... Please smile?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Gethyn (PS009)             [829] There is a list here ... three major's
                           presentations on [...] communion ... on political
                           insubordination ... and on the pilgrimage of
                           learning together.
                           [830] ... I think what we'll do is hear each of
                           those three presentations ... and then I will allow
                           a time for comment, especially discussion ... after
                           each ... I will limit that ... to make sure we get
                           time for all ... so that's ... that's the way we're
                           going to do it.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [831] Thank you.
Gethyn (PS009)             [832] But first of all ... in terms of a precedency
                           attitude ... I hope I'm looking in the right place?
                           [833] Nannette erm ... is going to ... lead us in
                           our ... [...] .
                           [834] ... Nannette would you like everybody where
                           you are and who you are?
Philip (PS004)             [835] Nannette [...] the Minister of the United
                           Reform Church in Merthyr ... also sharing the
                           ministry with the Presbyterian Church of Wales in
                           Merthyr and Merthyr Vale.
                           [836] ... Thank you John for that introduction.
                           [837] I remember John coming to Merthyr and asking
                           the young people to find, see if there was anybody
                           who was over a hundred in the congregation!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [838] And the dazzling thing was that quite a few
                           made a beeline for ... a lady who co , could at
                           least give ... thirty years!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [839] I thought [...] haven't noticed from where I'm
                           standing!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [840] In preparing ours for today ... and ... the
                           whole question of thinking of being, main precedency
                           of communion rests in our understanding erm, of
                           ordination, which I know ... later we ... we will
                           have time to discuss.
                           [841] ... But, may I ask yo , of you a question ...
                           not for answers but will ... erm ... perhaps come
                           later in the debate ... and that is what does the
                           ... service of Holy Communion mean ... to you?
                           [842] ... Our answers ... will get crushed.
                           [843] ... But one thing that I would share with you
                           ... and it's this, is that ... whenever the ...
                           friends of Jesus eat and drink together ... they
                           remember him ... his sacrificial love for them ...
                           and the wonderful gift of freedom that he has made
                           possible.
                           [844] ... I'll say at the outset, that Holy
                           Communion is not something that we play about with.
                           [845] ... Our communion service is part of the rich
                           tradition which has been passed down to us ... from
                           Jesus Christ.
                           [846] ... But having sa said that ... I have to
                           share with you the ... a key element er, in the life
                           of the church has been the ordained Ministry of Word
                           and Sacrament ... and pastoral care.
                           [847] And there is no intention to dispense with
                           this kind of service.
                           [848] But concern is expressed ... in the number of
                           jobs that the perfect minister is expected to do.
                           [849] I stand here, I am not a perfect minister
                           because I am over forty ... I've got ... children
                           that are not too awkward but ... erm, could be
                           awkward ... and, I haven't a spouse ... ah ... and
                           ah ... I stand here saying that I'm not good at
                           everything ... I'm good with young people, I'm not o
                           only good with old people ... I try to do my best.
                           [850] We know the picture of a perfect minister ...
                           but ... we ... there is a challenge ... to relief
                           ministers ... to do the work that they are called to
                           do.
                           [851] ... This will lead to ... a long deba ...
                           debate.
                           [852] ... But, it is ... it seems from this report
                           that ... is in front of us ... that it is now
                           appropriate for the URC ... to take a new step with
                           regard to the local ministry of elders.
                           [853] Already this morning the question has been
                           asked about providing elders.
                           [854] ... And it is that ... each local church, of
                           whatever sign ... should be invited to nominate from
                           amongst their elder division ... those elders who
                           district council ... might consider and recognise as
                           dividing elders ... for a stated period of years ...
                           with authority to do , provide them all services of
                           worship and meetings of that local church, as the
                           need arises.
                           [855] ... And this has been suggested, the same
                           thing, the understanding that we have now of special
                           authorization ... which obviously doesn't work.
                           [856] ... The reasons for looking at this change
                           and, I quote the reports ... the ... the ways the
                           district council interpret the existing clause ...
                           about provi , [...] precedency ... is the district
                           council ... ah, interpret in very different ways.
                           [857] ... A second thing is that ... a co , is it
                           right that a company of people ... should be
                           deprived of a sacrament ... because an ordained
                           minister is not available?
                           [858] ... Remembering the words of Jesus, that where
                           two or three are gathered together.
                           [859] ... The third thing that the re , the report
                           says is that there is no magical element about
                           sacraments.
                           [860] ... But ... sacrament has everything to do
                           with the grace of God ... and the faith of the
                           church.
                           [861] ... And this proposal is seen, lastly, as
                           developing ... local leadership.
                           [862] ... The proposal is that presiding elders ...
                           and whether proposal is the right word, but the
                           suggestion that presiding elders ... be ...
                           appointed following our conviction ... that every
                           local church ... should have regular sacramental
                           worship ... with presiding ... with people ...
                           presiding ... being allowed.
                           [863] ... Can I close by saying that every time
                           Christians share the Lord's supper ... they are
                           publicly declaring their needs to be fed with the
                           living bread and wine.
                           [864] ... What does the holy ... communion, what the
                           Lord's supper ... mean ... to you?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [applause]
Gethyn (PS009)             [865] [...] ... and ... our visitors from other

                           [866] ... And any more, for those who feel like it,

                           for a presidency in the absence ... of a minister
                           ... is a good one as long as it is monitored closely
                           by ... district council.
                           [870] ... And ... be that there no magical ... erm

                           the Eucharist, er the the ... the communion is very
                           central to our worship ... and ... having had ten
                           years working at the Navy ... that was an eye opener
                           ... and deepening of my own spiritual awareness ...
                           in the, as in the sanctity that I got, the sacrament
                           ... and how other churches see it ... and er ...
                           helped to create a very ... [...] affirm, at the

                           sometimes, er, perhaps arrive and been to the church
                           and say, oh by the way it's communion!
                           [873] ... And ... have that sprung on me ... I I I,
                           I I feel terrible because ... the communion service
                           i is, is something I have to prepare for ... in
                           myself ... and obviously shape the whole se se
                           service around it.
                           [874] ... And I think we need to heighten, sharpen
                           our awareness of ... erm ... what I understand by
                           communion ... and er ... er, also to er, to remember

                           deliver unto you.
                           [875] Those words of execution as we continue to
                           read them.
                           [876] ... There's a severe warning against those ...
                           who can't do it in a spirit of ... of of, lardiness

Philip (PS004)             [889] Yep.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [890] Erm ... oh yes ... my next question was ...
                           er, what is holy communion?
                           [891] ... I'd like to re-phrase the question ...
                           what is holy ... in ... communion?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [892] Okay ... well I mean
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [893] [...] do we say, what is holy in communion we

                           [894] ... The holy, as in communion to me is a who

                           [895] ... Okay?
                           [896] ... And I think that debate ... er between
                           the, the [...] tradition and, and the ... the [...]
                           ... and and er, Roman Catholic traditions, you know
                           i ... er, this business of elevating the host and
                           and [...] substantiation [...] ... so the elements
                           themselves that, that it become holy ... alright?
                           [897] And then it's a kind of a what, you know?
                           [898] It's the body of a what, and the blood as a
                           what!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [899] Have you read [...] ?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [900] But that's not it!
                           [901] And that's not what Paul meant ... when he
                           said [...] the body of a what!
                           [902] ... He meant [...] who?
                           [903] ... That is holy.
                           [904] ... And who is holy?
                           [905] ... Jesus Christ.
                           [906] Alright?
                           [907] You wanted it, and that's it!
                           [908] When two or three are doubted ... they're
                           wrong!
                           [909] ... So, what's the who?
                           [910] That's the holy to me.
                           [911] And the other who of holy ... is the Saint.
                           [912] ... I'm making this point because I think that
                           we can get really [...] to verify [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [913] You're always going on about
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [914] You know ... this whole of idea of things and
                           ritual being the holy ... and that things in the
                           ritual there ... yes, there are sacred symbols ...
                           and they need to be handled in that, that, that
                           sense of sacredness, but the ... that which makes
                           them sacred ... is the person, our Lord ... and us
                           ... in communion with him and with each other and it
                           seems to me that wherever that happens there is
                           sacrament.
                           [915] ... Wherever that happens there is ... holy
                           communion.
                           [916] ... Even if the elements aren't even present.
                           [917] ... Okay?
                           [918] ... But I think I think those elements are
                           important otherwise Jesus wouldn't have made a point
                           of it!

                           [920] ... Can I clarify please what exactly we are
                           talking about here?
                           [921] ... Because the do ... document, Patterns of
                           Ministry ... does not ... talk about lay presidency!
                           [922] ... It talks about the presidency of ordained
                           people!
                           [923] ... Elders ... who are ordained!
                           [924] ... Now, I rather wish it was talking about
                           ... lay presidency ... and I would go along with
                           Nannette ... on the question of a lay person ...
                           presiding in communion.
                           [925] Ecumenical dynamite, I know!
                           [926] ... But I think we need to be clear ...
                           whether we are talking ... about ordained or lay
                           people ... and further on in the discussion whether
                           we can indeed justify that division.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [927] How can try [...] and allow an elder ... [...]

                           [928] ... Can I say that need holy communion as a
                           group thing ... in a way of our communion ... and
                           ... as a church we are going to be Roman Catholic.
                           [929] ... It is the community ... as a ... an
                           affirmation of the community ... and to say that we
                           need to have an outsider in to do that ... because
                           there is not an ordained minister there ... to me,
                           is a little like the situation in some Anglican
                           Parishes where there's a woman ... sitting

John (PS008)               [931] I'm allowed to say something [...] pilgrimage
                           of love ... and the parish knows that too because

                           [932] ... So the three words that's come to my mind

                           [933] ... And you will recognise them as the words
                           of Jesus.
                           [934] ... They are ... direct ... they're clear ...
                           they're simple ... and most importantly ... they are
                           words of one syllable.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
John (PS008)               [935] But they ... still have a conscience ... and

                           [936] ... Now the ... the annual assembly ... has
                           challenged us to engage in ... what is called
                           integrated trading.
                           [937] ... Personally, I prefer to speak about ...
                           learning together ... because I think it's more ...
                           friendly use, er, user friendly ... I think I
                           understand it better ... and it reminds me ... that
                           it's connected with disciple-ship.
                           [938] ... Because I'm quite sure that ... the young
                           people ... this morning ... everyone would know ...
                           that the word disciple ... means
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [939] Follower ... isn't it?
John (PS008)               [940] Well you're all shy aren't you?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [941] yes?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [942] Means a learner.
John (PS008)               [943] Now the word disciple means learner.
                           [944] ... So that we're all involved ... disciple-
                           ship is integrally, er, learning is integral ... to
                           our disciple-ship.
                           [945] ... And we are involved ... not just,
                           spasmodically or occasionally ... but continuously.
                           [946] ... And learning together ... as we've been
                           reminded more than once than this morning ...
                           engages us all ... irrespective of age, irrespective
                           of experience ... it engages everyone ... and it's
                           worth emphasising that the quality of learning ...
                           does not depend upon the size of a congregation!
                           [947] ... And I say that in a right of some
                           statistics that appear in today's agenda.
                           [948] ... The quality of learning ... depends upon
                           the measure of our response ... and of our
                           commitments.
                           [949] ... It involves sharing our gifts ... with
                           each other freely and generously.
                           [950] ... It means erm ... learning ... with each
                           other and learning from each other because none of
                           us knows it all!
                           [951] ... And I think, also, it means being open ...
                           open to one another and open ... with one another.
                           [952] ... And when you put all that together ... I
                           think we would recognise ... that there is no single
                           ... [...] ... of learning ... that suits every
                           congregation ... because congregations differ, one
                           from the other.
                           [953] ... And we remind ourselves that the spirit is
                           also ... infinitely versatile and flexible in its
                           activity.
                           [954] ... But when we consider learning together ...
                           are a model.
                           [955] ... To use an educational term ... it's an
                           active model ... it's an active model of, model of
                           partnership ... and of sharing.
                           [956] ... Patterns of Ministry ... to my mind ...
                           can be interpreted as ... patterns of sharing ...
                           and partnership is active and not fussy.
                           [957] ... Partnership is ... creative ... and not
                           rigid.
                           [958] ... Partnership is ... dynamic ... and not
                           [...] .
                           [959] ... And then ... learning together ... is a
                           model ... of dynamic ... encounter ... or dialogue,
                           one with the other.
                           [960] ... And by that, I mean ... that we engage one
                           another in a process.
                           [961] ... We cannot all, as it already been
                           emphasised ... by the last speaker ... we may not
                           all be able to do the same things ... we have not
                           all got the same gifts or the same ...
                           responsibilities ... er ... within the church ...
                           but you all ... have the same responsibilities ...
                           in this light of God.
                           [962] ... And that implies that ... our learning
                           together ... engages us in ... dynamic encounter ...
                           dynamic dialogue ... which also releases ... some of
                           those energies in various areas of life ... that
                           would otherwise be sealed ... or indeed, locked!
                           [963] ... And I were to guess that ... learning
                           together is also ... a model of ... rich ... and
                           diverse possibilities.
                           [964] ... There is no one who can foresee ... what
                           are the ultimate results.
                           [965] ... Or what is the ultimate outcome of any
                           learning process?
                           [966] ... There is no blueprint ... that one could
                           lay down ... but with a [...] on ... the infinite
                           ... versatility of God ... to use and deploy the
                           gifts that we are able to offer ... to his service.
                           [967] ... The Holy Spirit is also flexible ... and
                           progressive in operation.
                           [968] ... And therefore, in learning together there
                           are ... rich ... and diverse possibilities.
                           [969] ... And I would suggest through us learning
                           together ... is a model ... of effective evangelism.
                           [970] ... For evangelism ... at best is a
                           congregation learning together.
                           [971] ... Learning together for the word.
                           [972] ... Learning together for the sacrament.
                           [973] ... Learning together through prayer and
                           worship ... and all the activities of the church.
                           [974] ... Learning together by entering, entering
                           into ... the experience of one or the other ... and
                           also ... engaging the community around the church,
                           not superficially ... but er ... realistically.
                           [975] ... And it would seem to me ... that unless
                           this morning's exercise ... which has been so
                           rewarding and so ... profitable ... unless this
                           morning's exercise is to dissipate ... into another
                           piece of feeling ... and er ... pleasurable
                           discussion ... then we ought to take quite seriously
                           ... the, the words of Jesus.
                           [976] ... Go and do!
                           [977] ... And see whether we can no , we could put
                           this ... matter of learning together ... that every

                           of their church ... in terms of using ministry.
                           [985] ... A ministry that we don't often think of as
                           a ministry.
                           [986] ... Correct sir?
Alan (PS007)               [987] [...] .
                           [988] ... Er, in the introductions I didn't stand up
                           and er, introduce myself cos I felt it would steal a
                           few minutes of my er presentation!

                           [990] My name's Chris , I'm from the river town ...
                           URC in [...] just down the road.
                           [991] ... What we've been embarking on in the ... er
                           ... the URC church in Shodden ... is er budgeting
                           ... the title of my ... talk today is budgeting for
                           growth.
                           [992] ... We hear about budgets in all walks of
                           life, indeed we saw a red box only a few days ago.
                           [993] I'm afraid I've only got a little red one!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Alan (PS007)               [994] This will happen next week.
                           [995] ... So we've had the most famous budget of
                           all.
                           [996] ... I suppose ... you could argue that his
                           budget was er, a budget for growth ... but my
                           discussion this morning is apolitical.
                           [997] ... But I'll make not comment on his budget at
                           all.
                           [998] ... The basic principle of a budget ... is
                           straightforward ... it's to forecast your [...] ...
                           forecast your expend ... expenses ... so they can
                           make plans ... for the future.
                           [999] ... Big and lit , little businesses alike ...
                           budget for growth.
                           [1000] ... It enables them to make most, most cost-
                           effective use ... of their resources.
                           [1001] ... So why shouldn't a church do the same?
                           [1002] On this approach, following a presentation
                           ... and a discussion ... led by the Reverend Bill
                           ... about eighteen months ago.
                           [1003] ... And I've written this paper, not to ...
                           give information ... and details ... on, how you do
                           budget.
                           [1004] There are plenty of papers and books ... and
                           guidance from the URC to help you do that.
                           [1005] ... What I'd like to ... share with you this
                           morning ... is ... how we as a church took that
                           challenge ... and the experiences we feel we've ...
                           received ... from taking that challenge.
                           [1006] ... We have begun to feel the benefit.
                           [1007] ... Well how was it at er ... Shodden ...
                           Well, like any other church we thought we were doing
                           well.
                           [1008] ... We were just getting enough money in ...
                           to do ... just enough in the church.
                           [1009] ... The church was helping ... the spirit.
                           [1010] ... Helping in kind.
                           [1011] ... Helping the fellowship.
                           [1012] ... What more as a church could we ask for?
                           [1013] ... Well maybe they can ... [...] like any
                           other church ... was the an , or is, the Annual
                           Church ge ... the Annual General Meeting ... and as
                           John pointed out this morning ... of course, we look
                           ... at what we've done in the past.
                           [1014] ... The finances ... the well being of our
                           own flock ... what we have done.
                           [1015] ... But, look at the tense, it's what ...
                           have done [...] .
                           [1016] ... It's a retrospective view.
                           [1017] ... That is important, we learn from
                           experiences.
                           [1018] ... But it's what we've done in the past.
                           [1019] ... What about the future?
                           [1020] ... How many of us actually, in our church
                           meeting, look forward ... to what we want to do?
                           [1021] ... Where's the direction of your church?
                           [1022] Where's the direction of your fellowship ...
                           that they can follow?
                           [1023] ... Are there any problems that may be
                           looming on the horizon ... that perhaps you ought to
                           be addressing before they reach the door?
                           [1024] ... We need to grow together ... and enjoy
                           the experience together.
                           [1025] ... So what changed us?
                           [1026] ... Well, the presentation by Bill ... helped
                           ... in supporting [...] provided was the [...] .
                           [1027] ... We've heard it all before!
                           [1028] But not, at any time, in the context of the
                           church.
                           [1029] ... A number of us went to that presentation
                           ... the minister, the church secretary, myself, and
                           the treasurer at the time ... and a few of the
                           elders.
                           [1030] ... We listened and learned ... that if the
                           church is to grow ... it must consider all its
                           resources!
                           [1031] ... Reference to that again this morning.
                           [1032] ... We must tap that wealth with talent.
                           [1033] ... I suppose really we learn by who sent us
                           that evening.
                           [1034] ... A sense of purpose ... a sense of
                           involvement ... a sense of direction ... a sense of
                           satisfaction ... and a sense of achievement.
                           [1035] ... We're beginning to experience all those.
                           [1036] ... And I suppose we also experience a sixth
                           sense.
                           [1037] ... A sense of humour [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Alan (PS007)               [1038] we've heard that again this morning.
                           [1039] And Bill, in there, used sense of humour ...
                           to get some of his points over.
                           [1040] ... But we've got all of those.
                           [1041] ... [...] talk from any of you.
                           [1042] ... If you look closely at that ... to what
                           depth ... to what depth do those senses reach ... in
                           your church?
                           [1043] ... Our church has money to spend on ... on
                           anything! ... [...] , fabric, fellowship ...
                           worship, mission ... the list is endless!
                           [1044] What a delightfulness to choose from!
                           [1045] ... But what priority do you sign to it?
                           [1046] Which one do you choose?
                           [1047] How much ... on each of those?
                           [1048] ... One of the problems you may be facing in
                           your church is inertia ... the feeling that ...
                           we're doing fine ... everything's ticking over.
                           [1049] ... But remember, the same effort ... reaps
                           the same reward.
                           [1050] ... So we returned from that evening together
                           ... and were very enthusiastic about what we heard.
                           [1051] ... The seed was sown in good soil.
                           [1052] ... The treasurer indeed, faces the same old
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Alan (PS007)               [1053] task every year ... to ask church members to
                           give a little bit more ... to pay the bills.
                           [1054] ... What a depressing thing to ask for!
                           [1055] ... Just to keep up with inflation!
                           [1056] ... Just to keep the wolf from the door.
                           [1057] ... Wouldn't you generate a more positive
                           attitude ... if ... you were aligned your increase
                           ... or the request for an increase ... through the a
                           ... an increase in activity ... in the church
                           itself?
                           [1058] That, is true growth!
                           [1059] ... So what did we do?
                           [1060] Well, first of all we told the people ... at
                           the earliest opportunity ... we told the church
                           members what we've learnt ... told them about our
                           ... of the advantages and our enthusiasm and
                           commitment to the process.
                           [1061] ... We tried the process.
                           [1062] ... We selected a single project to just ...
                           learn ... how to do it ... just go through the
                           process simply.
                           [1063] ... It took about nine months of planning
                           from start to finish ... on the one project we did.
                           [1064] ... [...] ... We had a programme on four
                           consecutive Saturdays, last October ... help reach
                           the [...] .
                           [1065] ... At, not a significant cost.
                           [1066] ... It's a significant step for our
                           fellowship.
                           [1067] ... And ... the benefit is, we want to do it
                           again this year, that's great!
                           [1068] ... Plus, taking [...] , keeping it and doing
                           it ... if you see benefit in that.
                           [1069] ... So that was a benefit to ... people
                           outside ... and people inside the church.
                           [1070] ... We have learnt at getting ... a number of
                           people ... into our congregation.
                           [1071] ... So that was our first success when we
                           decided [...] that process.
                           [1072] ... Forward planning ... and setting
                           objectives ... were a good way to focus attention.
                           [1073] ... So, we set objectives ... and sub ,
                           subsequently ... planned a budget ... to ensure ...
                           that it's successful.
                           [1074] ... So what's the timetable?
                           [1075] ... Well I'll take you back six months.
                           [1076] ... The elders were advised in advance that
                           we were going to discuss ... the future, [...] .
                           [1077] ... This enabled the eldership to start
                           thinking about ... what we want to do next year ...
                           to grow together.
                           [1078] ... So, in the next elders meeting ... we
                           used a management technique, brainstormers ... think
                           the ... say what you think.
                           [1079] ... And ... we gathered all this information
                           ... we grouped it into those categories, admission,
                           worship, [...] ... and such like.
                           [1080] ... Then later, couple of months later when
                           we found that list ... checked that we understood
                           what the list meant ... and we presented that list
                           ... to our church meeting.
                           [1081] ... This will ensure that there's commitment
                           ... and that the direction is understood ... for the
                           next year.
                           [1082] ... So, in that presentation discussions
                           followed ... and that list of nine things, I think
                           it was, surprise surprise the church wanted to do
                           all nine!
                           [1083] ... Now there's a challenge!
                           [1084] ... So what we did then, is we went ... to
                           do, to do fact-finding, costs, people resources,
                           effort ... and any options that might be open to us.
                           [1085] ... And ... the culmination of the production
                           of some financial information that simply enables
                           you to ensure ... that you can meet those goals ...
                           in that coming year ... if you choose to do so.
                           [1086] ... So at the Annual, Annual General Meeting
                           ... it was conducted i , very much in the same way
                           as before ... presenting the previous year's
                           activities ... but this time, we presented a budget!
                           [1087] ... Very similar to the example that Bill
                           provided ... in his hand outs.
                           [1088] We listed a ... our expenditure ... his
                           forecast ... we used the forecast based on
                           experience and inflation.
                           [1089] Some of them are at best guesses!
                           [1090] ... But then you foil a new project to your
                           expenditure and say look ... if you want to do these
                           ... as indeed, you've expressed ... then it's going
                           to cost you so much.
                           [1091] ... If you get that agreement there ... one
                           hopes you get that commitment.
                           [1092] ... On a technicality the bu , the treasurer
                           can still control it.
                           [1093] ... He can measure every clause of what the
                           income is [...] , against what the expenditure is
                           ... so that we have some control ... to ensure ...
                           that the church life grows ... and we don't stumble.
                           [1094] ... So, we have true growth.
                           [1095] ... What are, finally, what are the benefits
                           that we've seen here?
                           [1096] ... Well ... if there's a commercial activity
                           you could argue that ... but i , in the chu ,
                           context of the church ... what have we achieved?
                           [1097] ... We have focus ... we have a direction ...
                           we maintain the fiscal control ... we are aware of
                           what we're doing as a church ... we have the ... the
                           members commitment ... indeed, we have their
                           involvement ... in what we want to do.
                           [1098] ... It is future planning ... it is growth
                           ... it is commended to you all.
                           [1099] ... And I'd like to leave you with one last
                           statement ... just enough, but just enough, is not
                           enough!

                           [1114] ... It's very much concerned ... with the
                           training and Ministry of Elders ... and a few weeks
                           ago ... a part of our programme ... we held a very
                           successful and lively meeting ... on the subject of
                           church membership.
                           [1115] ... It was initiated by one of our ministers
                           ... erm, who felt it would be useful for churches to
                           share ... er, their procedures for ... preparation
                           for church membership.
                           [1116] ... As he said, I know what I do with my
                           congregation ... but how do others ... er, approach
                           the subject?
                           [1117] ... Under the leadership of the Reverend
                           Kenneth ... this meeting developed into a much wider
                           consideration ... of the leaning and significance of
                           church membership.
                           [1118] ... Does it begin with infant baptism?
                           [1119] ... Are all children and me , and adults who
                           have been baptised ... members of the church? ...
                           [...] is not or you'll be actually encouraged ... or
                           pressured ... to misinterpret the membership ... or
                           should we wait for them to be informed ... er er, to
                           wait for them to, to feel the [...] ?
                           [1120] ... One or two elders [...] ... confessed
                           that they have not been baptised!
                           [1121] ... And others were not sure whether they
                           had!
                           [1122] ... So what about them?
                           [1123] ... We realise that this is a subject ...
                           which warrants much [...] consideration, as we think
                           about the life and reverence of our churches ... and
                           look to the future for [...] .
                           [1124] ... And we hope that our district will
                           continue to be, be aware ... of ways in, in which we
                           may help elders and ... churches in their ministry.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1125] Thank you.

Gethyn (PS009)             [1127] Russell , East Wales district.
                           [1128] ... Erm ... I'd like to tell you a story ...
                           about ... a vision of Ministry in East Wales.
                           [1129] ... When I'm about to tell ... you a story, I
                           thought to myself well ... stories that Jesus used
                           to tell were parables ... and when I looked at them
                           in the bible ... they had a kingdom meaning to them.
                           [1130] ... And I thought to myself ... yes, I'll
                           tell you a story!
                           [1131] ... I'll tell you a story about ... a place I
                           went
*** 8 (Tape 029001) ***
Noel (PS00A)               [1132] [...] ... Now ... so much more time has been
                           released for us ... to be the church ... but at the
                           same time we have nowhere to hide ... and nothing to
                           blame!
                           [1133] ... It has meant, that churches [...] need to
                           be bold ... and be young ... or a threat to what we
                           belong to ... as the edges between church and ...
                           and community have blurred ... we are now much more
                           vulnerable.
                           [1134] ... Somebody said, like a tortoise without a
                           shell.
                           [1135] ... And we need a greater trust in God.
                           [1136] ... It has also meant a greater love for one
                           another as we can share our faith ... and come face
                           to face with who we are.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1137] I'm glad that Pat used the word ... exciting
                           ... but all the story you've heard this morning are
                           exciting!
                           [1138] ... But, it does Pat, doesn't it ... also
                           danger!
                           [1139] ... It also means fear, it also means pain.
                           [1140] ... I don't know no any more what church is
                           ... I don't know any more and I'm supposed to come
                           this morning and help to discover what unity is!
                           [1141] ... It blurred so much ... and in the
                           blurring ... we have discovered our own
                           vulnerabilities.
                           [1142] ... And having raised our banners of church
                           [...] proudly ... a change is all ... [...] ... what
                           changes should have been!
                           [1143] ... I see now narrow mindedness ... I see the
                           deathedness ... I see suspicion of other communities
                           ... I see jealousies.
                           [1144] ... However, I am discovering that the church
                           ... probably not the community ... but more a
                           communion ... and that's perhaps an answer to what
                           Nanette [...] ?
                           [1145] ... Or within the communion of our Lord Jesus
                           Christ ... in word and sacrament ... and that living
                           out of his love is his body ... and finding
                           community.
                           [1146] ... Communion ... actually the Holy Communion
                           ... has become so much more important to us ... and
                           so much more exciting to us ... because we're not
                           just celebrating the living Christ ... we're also
                           celebrating the crucified Christ ... and we're
                           simply meeting our pain and our joys ... together
                           ... in communion with him.
                           [1147] ... I once watched a film on the telly ... it
                           was a pretty crap film really!
                           [1148] ... It was American ... no, sorry it's not!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1149] See ... yes ... the thing about community
                           [...] .
                           [1150] ... It was a simple story, and I would of
                           forgotten it ... er, about a woman struggling to
                           bring up a family in a depression.
                           [1151] ... The story was that her husband in the
                           deep south ... was killed by some young hoodlums who
                           were black.
                           [1152] ... She was left to bring up a family ... she
                           had to go the banks for money ... the banks were all
                           [...] ... and they refused her money ... to keep the
                           farm going.
                           [1153] ... She took on a black lad ... and because
                           she did that she was ostracised from the rest of the
                           community.
                           [1154] ... He eventually was driven off the farm ...
                           but the respectable white people who went to church.
                           [1155] ... The story, of course, was a happy ending,
                           that she struggled on and she did it.
                           [1156] ... But for some strange reason, and I don't
                           know whether they direct it to Christian ... the
                           last shot of the film, almost unnoticeable because
                           the credits were going up ... she went back into
                           church ... and it was a communion service ... and
                           all you saw was her receiving the bread and passing
                           the plate ... and the plate was to the young black
                           lad on the farm ... and you thought, he's come back!
                           [1157] ... But then, no ... he passed the plate then
                           ... to the woman's husband ... who had been killed!
                           [1158] ... And then the plate was passed from him to
                           his murderer ... and it was passed round until it
                           was passed to the bank manager who wouldn't give her
                           the money ... and then back to her.
                           [1159] ... And somehow, but I can't explain it ...
                           in that moment [...] that what community's about ...
                           it's about the not yet ... as well your [...] .

                           from the church meeting
Margaret (PS002)           [1184] Yeah.
Alan (PS007)               [1185] so we've still got to

Margaret (PS002)           [1192] And it was a major problem of finance ... it
                           seems to me [...] when you've two possible avenues
                           left to take.
Margaret (PS002)           [1193] When you [...] I think it's ... yes.
Margaret (PS002)           [1194] One is ... getting a loan from the church
Margaret (PS002)           [1195] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1196] and repaying it at ... five percent interest

                           they'll lend it.
Alan (PS007)               [1200] If they ask for money.

Alan (PS007)               [1206] I see.

Margaret (PS002)           [1208] Well you've got a lot of other things to

                           more urgent, so therefore, I haven't really pursued

Alan (PS007)               [1244] Please!
Margaret (PS002)           [1245] Would you be able stay with the one you've

Margaret (PS002)           [1246] Well the one we've got above our [...] ... in
                           fact, there's one next door to us going for sale at
                           the moment ... and they're asking advertised prices
                           [...] ... else you'll be getting about fifty
                           thousand on top ... that's ours.

                           [1248] ... And because ... that one ... even if we

Alan (PS007)               [1249] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1250] And it seems for the churches ... we'd then
                           be looking up to point ... forty perc , fourteen
                           percent ... for fifty thousand pounds.
Alan (PS007)               [1251] A , actually ... John was suggesting ... that
                           we might talk nicely to John's dad about the money
                           they've got invested in the sale of their pro ,
                           their ground.

                           it's worth looking at.
Margaret (PS002)           [1253] The only thing is though, I mean, you see but
                           ... I think the church itself ... and ... I would
                           say the church as the group now
Alan (PS007)               [1254] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1255] would be looking at that ... as a more
                           meaningful ... contribution to [...] .
Alan (PS007)               [1256] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1257] Well what else can you talk [...] ?

                           church and they could be, they could be [...] on the
                           interest ... you know, the amount ... towards ...
                           running costs such as this.
                           [1259] ... Well, to me running costs wouldn't be
                           [...] and the cost of towards ... borrowing ... a
                           house is the same way you know.
Margaret (PS002)           [1260] Well exactly!
                           [1261] The point is that ... [...] looks very nice
                           [...] .
Alan (PS007)               [1262] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [1263] You know, but I mean if the church cannot
                           find ... [...] contributions it really can't [...] !

                           have to talk about it with the elders you see.
Margaret (PS002)           [1267] Sorry, what did you say?
Alan (PS007)               [1268] We're still going to have to talk about with

Margaret (PS002)           [1288] dear, dear, dear!
Alan (PS007)               [1289] Just a mi , matter of interest where do you
                           come from because on this ... dictionary thing I'm
                           supposed to put down what people's local accent is?
Margaret (PS002)           [1290] Ah, that's good!
                           [1291] ... Only Oxford, no I'm, mine is in in ...
                           inexplicable because I've lived in so many places
                           and I pick up accents!
                           [1292] ... I was born in Lancashire, so that's
Alan (PS007)               [1293] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1294] the basis of it all.
                           [1295] ... I've had the roughest edges knocked off
                           it when I went to University.
                           [1296] ... And the , but then I went to live in ...
                           Northern Ireland so I've got a so ... picked up a
                           fair bit of Northern Ireland.
Alan (PS007)               [1297] Yes well, it does happen when,whe

Margaret (PS002)           [...]
Alan (PS007)               [1300] it does happen when you move around.
Margaret (PS002)           [1301] Yeah it does.
Alan (PS007)               [1302] In ... I think it happened to me to some
                           extent.
Margaret (PS002)           [1303] Well it does, if if ... if you pick up [...]
                           accents, some people never change!
Alan (PS007)               [1304] That's true.
Margaret (PS002)           [1305] [...] some people, doesn't matter where you

                           think you pick up reflections.
Alan (PS007)               [1307] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1308] You know, I haven't been consciously stru ,
                           striving to change my accent.
                           [1309] ... In fact, you know I'm consciously now not
                           to become a Welsh accent ... because if I've got the
                           Welsh accent added to it all it'll be horrendous!
Alan (PS007)               [laugh]

                           [1316] ... It's at least distinctive!
Margaret (PS002)           [1317] It is.
                           [1318] ... On the notice you sent out ... the other

Margaret (PS002)           [1319] Yes.
Margaret (PS002)           [1320] I think you put a paragraph first ... that
                           said maybe we will need to consider ... our
                           recommendation
Alan (PS007)               [1321] Yes.

Alan (PS007)               [1323] Yes.
Margaret (PS002)           [1324] Maybe in some thing which [...] at the moment
                           ... is that the be number one.
Alan (PS007)               [1325] Er ... which wo , which one you mean, the

                           on recommendation.
Alan (PS007)               [1327] I see!
                           [1328] Oh yes!
                           [1329] Well I was thinking that.
Margaret (PS002)           [1330] Yeah.
                           [1331] ... But it really is, it might have got lost
                           in the paragraph mighten it?
                           [1332] ... Cos when the [...] comes underneath.
Alan (PS007)               [1333] I see what you mean.
Margaret (PS002)           [1334] It isn't being critical at all but ... on
                           this position situation that might the first thing
                           that we
Alan (PS007)               [1335] Oh yes, I was assuming that ... erm ... a I
                           do , I didn't really set it out as a formal agenda
                           just as a
Margaret (PS002)           [1336] Just as a note
Alan (PS007)               [1337] a reminder, like.
Margaret (PS002)           [1338] Erm ... I don't know what the situation will
                           be in the other churches.
Alan (PS007)               [1339] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1340] And I must say between us at the moment ...
                           there wasn't a strong feeling ... what it's all
                           about.
Alan (PS007)               [1341] Not a strong feeling in favour?
                           [1342] ... No?
Margaret (PS002)           [1343] No, I'm only saying [...] as prepared ...

Alan (PS007)               [1378] Well I don't ... I don't think ... that
                           should influence them too much.
                           [1379] ... I mean ... it ... one wants to get a
                           settlement quickly
Margaret (PS002)           [1380] Mm.
Alan (PS007)               [1381] but it's more important to get the right
                           person than to do it

Alan (PS007)               [1387] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [1388] and then what's it amount to?
                           [1389] If I use the word aggression.
Alan (PS007)               [1390] Yes.

Alan (PS007)               [1393] It's cos I wasn't for that.
Margaret (PS002)           [1394] Weren't you?

                           [...] .
Alan (PS007)               [1401] A lot of tact may be needed at times, yes.
Margaret (PS002)           [1402] And ... you could see them all so ...
                           nervousness ... anxiety ... that I wasn't told

                           recommend positively ... if the church meeting goes

Margaret (PS002)           [1443] and ... I got a greater kinship because
                           they're a small group.
Alan (PS007)               [1444] Mm.

                           member of this Synod, and therefore, you've got me
                           three things!
                           [1514] ... Er

Noel (PS00A)               [1515] I greet you ... greet you on ... [...] on

                           [1516] ... And, but I, I'm glad to make a greeting
                           from a, a wide range of churches ... erm, I've got
                           to discard this figure because I've got [...] .
                           [1517] ... But including churches that are, [...]
                           Orthodox church and the Lutheran ... Lutheran
                           churches in Wales ... and now ... hopefully, during
                           this year ... some sanctity [...] churches in Wales.
                           [1518] ... And so that there will be a ... a broad
                           spectrum of people ... who with us ... confess a
                           common faith, serve a common Lord and proclaim about
                           our gospel ... serving within this number of people
                           in Wales and therefore I'm glad to bring you
                           greetings ... for that reason.
                           [1519] ... I'm glad to bring you greetings because
                           ... I think you serve a particularly unimportant
                           purpose!
                           [1520] ... When, when I was asked to comment ... be
                           before ... John was, was ever elected ... erm ... is
                           that ... you elect moderators from e , whatever
                           happened to a moderator!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Noel (PS00A)               [1521] Be before you were chosen by whatever process
                           ... a number of us was asked to comment and one of
                           the things I felt it important to say ... was that
                           the URC plays a very important role ... both in
                           being a bridge between all these nations ... but
                           also serving a particular reform tradition within
                           Wales.
                           [1522] ... And that this larger responsibility,
                           having more local responsibility combined in one
                           small church is an important role.
                           [1523] ... But I think that came through in this
                           morning's conversation.
                           [1524] ... And I'm glad also to ... to to [...]
                           greeting, it's my last part John, if you'd like to
                           know!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Noel (PS00A)               [1525] Erm ... be because ... out of that debate
                           this morning I sense you have much to offer the rest
                           of us ... and I hope that that conversation will not
                           be a conversation confined your Synod or to the ...
                           to the assembly of URC ... but that we'll find ways
                           of sharing that perception of ministry ... with
                           those of us in other churches ... cos ... you don't
                           need me to tell me, tell you that that key question
                           in the whole ecumenical debate, not just in these
                           nations but worldwide ... and I think that from
                           within this reform tradition in which I share ... I
                           will hope that we will find ways of offering that
                           perception ... of ministry, in all its forms ... as
                           erm, a symbol and a sign of the ministry of the
                           whole people of God ... we have that to offer the
                           churches in Wales ... and worldwide ... and I hope
                           that we can find ways of doing that.
                           [1526] And for those reasons ... and for the fact
                           that I, more or less enjoyed the journey ... and had
                           to come anyway as a chauffeur!

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1569] As I understand things, and I work from what
                           I know ... to what I don't know ... anyone ordained
                           an elder following these guidelines is recognised as
                           an elder within the United Reform Church and within
                           the Presbyterian Church of Wales.
                           [1570] ... As a result of that, and I think ... to
                           make sure this is something we would have to ask the
                           [...] advisory committee ... but I would read it ...
                           that that includes mutual recognition of eldership.
                           [1571] ... And so in my [tape change] [side two of
                           two hundred and eighty nine]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1572] That it would yes.
                           [1573] ... But I'd want to consult the giant
                           advisory committee ... before putting that into
                           print.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1574] Yo , that's an important question that comes
                           as a ... we can attempt ... or ... the group can
                           attempt to answer that question ... the in reports
                           of the next [...] ... so we don't lose it off the
                           agenda.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1575] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1576] Would that be fair?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1577] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1578] I'll just put that aside.
                           [1579] ... All in those in favour of the resolution
                           that we ... commend to these ... to the church [...]

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1580] we agree the procedure for the election of
                           ordination and induction of elders ... in [...] and
                           in churches.
                           [1581] ... Please show?
                           [1582] ... Any against?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1583] Actually I've rather hurried through ... that
                           objective part of our [...] I only had my ... time
                           ... to bring before you ... one other very important
                           issue ... and two other pieces of information.
                           [1584] ... There are a few copies remaining of [...]
                           newsletter.
                           [1585] ... There's also information about the
                           International Ecumenical Fellowship ... which is
                           something that you as an individual can do ... to
                           support ecumenical work.
                           [1586] If you want to know more about it, pick up a
                           leaflet.
                           [1587] ... If, we have run out of leaflets ... pick
                           up John !

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1588] Because he is a member ... and he can tell
                           you about it.
                           [1589] ... The most ... important thing ... in this
                           report ... is from the Council of Churches for
                           Britain and Ireland ... and it's a resolution ...
                           that they passed ... on Northern Ireland.
                           [1590] ... You should have this ... received this in
                           the pew ... when you came in ... this morning.
                           [1591] ... The reason it is important today ... is
                           because tomorrow ... has been ... requested to be
                           appointed to be ... a special day in prayer ... for
                           peace ... justice ... in Northern Ireland.
                           [1592] ... Like this resolution ... I would urge ...
                           all of you ... when you go back ... to your
                           congregation ... those ministers who ... are

                           from the South who will not be ... conducting
                           morning worship tomorrow because of the long journey
                           ... request whoever is conducting worship to use
                           this ... in the service ... in the prayers!
                           [1593] ... Those of you who are here without
                           ministers ... badger your minister!
                           [1594] ... When you get back tonight ... or tomorrow
                           ... to include this ... in your time and prayer ...
                           in one of your services tomorrow.
                           [1595] ... And don't ... let it stop there!
                           [1596] ... A day of prayer is important ... as it
                           changes our pattern of prayer ... and as it changes
                           ... our concerns week by week and year by year.
                           [1597] ... Some of the ... attempts at peacemaking
                           ... the churches in Ireland are making ... may seem
                           worrying ... may seem politically subversive ... but
                           how will we respond ... to the longing for peace ...
                           to the desire ... for reconciliation ... for the
                           hope ... the stakes [...] ... that will result ...
                           in a permanent and just solution?

                           look ... I always say you have to be terrified!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ena (PS003)                [1604] It's a bit
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1605] I'm a spy!
Ena (PS003)                [1606] Oh, after all that it didn't work!
                           [1607] ... It's at this point in our agenda when er
                           ... the world search ... it's ... our agenda ... and
                           er ... in introducing the report there are just four
                           things I want to comment about.
                           [1608] ... Er, I refer, first of all to ... the
                           continuing links we have with the church in Hungary
                           ... and to remind that there is a, a party of young
                           who are currently negotiating the ... er, visit to
                           Hungary at this present time.
                           [1609] ... And er, we would hope that that programme
                           of reciprocal visits will continue over the ensuing
                           years.
                           [1610] ... We also find there are, and I hope that
                           you will read it carefully, because I think you will
                           find it ... a fairly daunting report ... which comes
                           from Hugh ... who has managed, you know, has been
                           working, erm, in ... er, Romania ... with the Bishop
                           ... erm, who more or less, kind of, started off the,
                           or whose work started off the ... the revolution
                           that took place in Romania.
                           [1611] ... Within that report he tells us ... erm,
                           the rather startling disturbance story, that in fact
                           ... it almost suggests, has been suggested the
                           revolution hasn't happened because the situation ...
                           has continued as before with a different name ...
                           but basically with the same ... er ... with the same
                           kind of programme intact.
                           [1612] ... And in the creation of unity, unity [...]
                           there's deep concern about the status of American
                           churches in Romania ... and obviously the Hungarian
                           church ... in Romania is affected by that whole
                           process so I would urge you to read that letter ...
                           to remember the work of Hugh erm ... and to ... be
                           aware of, of what ... the situation is ... in that
                           part of the world.
                           [1613] It seems important that I should have links,
                           in developing links ... you ought to see that as
                           part of our agenda.
                           [1614] ... Hugh, himself ... I think he is
                           completing his work ... and there, in, in a few
                           months time ... and I know there have attempts made
                           to find someone to replace him.
                           [1615] As yet er, that has not been possible, but if
                           you knew of anybody, young person who you thought
                           might be suitable ... and might ... mi , might like
                           the challenge of an interesting venture of this
                           nature ... I'm sure if you let us know, or let the
                           moderator know ... we'll be very happy to, er,
                           suggest that name or see if there's any, any
                           possibility ... erm, in continuing that [...] .
                           [1616] ... We also feel it's important that we
                           should ... be doing just a bit more than just having
                           exchanges, that there is a whole process of [...]
                           that needs to go on.
                           [1617] There's an assumption ... by some politicians
                           that just because there is this ... immense change
                           taking place in Eastern Europe, that this is victory
                           for Western capitalism ... erm, I think there might
                           be some of who might be a bit cautious about that
                           victory and might believe that er ... there is still
                           much that needs to be shared and understood ... and
                           it isn't as simple as perhaps some political figures
                           might suggest it could be.
                           [1618] ... So I want to, first of all, in presenting
                           this report to remind you of the importance of that
                           link ... and for us to encourage its development.
                           [1619] ... Secondly, the World Church erm ... is
                           your agenda in the sense that ... you might be
                           interested to know there is a ... erm ... a video
                           now available, er ... which introduces the work of
                           CWM for the churches.
                           [1620] ... And that video can be obtained from
                           Tavistock Church, in Tavistock Place ... it costs
                           twelve pound fifty, with one pound fifty postage ...
                           erm, but I think that it has been recommended to us
                           and a number of the provinces have asked for copies
                           to be made available ... and then maybe there are
                           some churches within our provence that might like to
                           have that video so that they can draw the attention
                           of their churches to the work ... of the Council for
                           World Mission.
                           [1621] ... Thirdly, we will in a moment be hearing a
                           report ... erm, about the ... World Council of
                           Churches ... assembly which took place in Canberra
                           ... so there is another aspect to the World Church
                           hitting our agenda today.
                           [1622] ... But fourth, and I think it was reflected
                           very much in the discussions this morning ... just
                           to simply remind you that you are the World Church!
                           [1623] You know, we sometimes think of the World
                           Church as being something that's out there beyond
                           us, but we are the World Church aren't we?
                           [1624] We're ... we are part of the that process and
                           it's ... it's sometimes encouraging for us to
                           remember that there are ... small denominations,
                           small groups like us around the world ... who are
                           struggling to make their Christian witness real ...
                           in their particular context.
                           [1625] ... And it's important that the kind of story
                           that we're being told this morning, or to continue
                           to be told, we are to continually hear and observing

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1626] stories ... because they are encouraging ...
                           it does make us feel that even though we are a small
                           denomination that does not stop us from preventing
                           new ideas which we can share and in which we can
                           learn from each other.
                           [1627] So, I would hope that out of this experience
                           of this morning you will continue to er let some of
                           those stories come forward ... and, and let us hear
                           them and let us share in them.
                           [1628] ... And, with those comments moderator, I'd
                           like to present the er report of the World Church,
                           Church and Mission.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1629] Are there any questions, either on the report
                           or in what [...] ?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1630] Then it gives me great pleasure now to erm
                           ... I always knew that John al , has had something
                           different from the rest of us you know ... he has
                           that kind of air doesn't he, that ... that status in

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1631] And of course, I've now discovered what it
                           is, he's a distant relative of the ... Archbishop of
                           Wales.

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1632] There was always er ... there was always

                           [1633] ... There was just something about his daring

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1634] [...] ... that's alright then.

                           [1636] ... Erm, I'm ... I'm never sure about Bishops
                           and Archbishops, erm ... I remember Archbishop
                           Runcie once commenting about ... er, an activity
                           that took place at the installation of a Bishop and
                           it's, I gather, I mean I've, I haven't actually been
                           to one, but if you're Bishop or an Archbishop [...]
                           when they act to ... the triumph and act of
                           installation took place there were ... you'll find
                           that the person was surrounded by Bishops and they
                           were all sort of looking in on this er, this body
                           that was gonna be installed and somebody once asked
                           what are they doing?
                           [1637] ... Ar , Archbishop Run , Runcie said well
                           it's just simply an operation to remove their
                           backbone!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1638] Erm ... I don't know!

                           you extended to me.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [1642] At least, I feel at home.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [1643] I won't say any more!
                           [1644] ... Some of you may have listened very
                           attentively to the, to a programme that put o , was
                           put out a week ago I think, with Betty ... er, in

                           know something my background.
                           [1645] ... Er ... last year ... and time has flown
                           hasn't it?
                           [1646] ... Last February, twelve months last
                           February I'm, I was privileged ... to ... travel to

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [1648] There were seven of us from Wales ... er ...
                           and two of them are present here this afternoon.
                           [1649] ... Noel was present and ... [...] presenting
                           the Welsh independence in [...] ... and also ...
                           Gethyn was present ... erm ... I'd like to see, er,
                           know that Gethyn was representing the Church in
                           Wales ... apart from the fact that he's also a
                           baptist.
                           [1650] ... Er, as you know, Gethyn does work ... for
                           the Church in Wales now ... and this, in a special
                           way, is a ... testifies ... to ... the fact that he
                           is ... er ... an ecumenical person.
                           [1651] ... Working ecumenically ... in Wales.
                           [1652] He is also ... a secretary of Envis that is
                           the commission of covenant to churches ... of which
                           we are all members of churches.
                           [1653] ... Yes, I er ... I went in February nineteen
                           ninety two ... and certainly this was a great
                           privilege ... to be there for, was it, three weeks?
                           [1654] Three weeks I think ... er ... spending time
                           with members of other churches ... and also members
                           of others cultures from all over the world.
                           [1655] ... The er ... I've got to keep an eye on my
                           watch, this is what I'm going by!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [1656] It's a [...] ... more than anything else.
                           [1657] I know that you are behind schedule ... and I
                           don't want to incur the wrath of your moderator!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [1658] During the, the fortnight in which we met in
                           Canberra ... eight hundred and twenty six of us were
                           official delegates ... er, to the World Council of
                           Churches.
                           [1659] Delegates from the member churches.
                           [1660] ... And, in a sense ... the World Council of
                           Churches at this point can be regarded as the
                           supreme legislative body ... of the World Church.
                           [1661] ... And you're quite right ... er ... we must
                           regard the World Church as meaning ourselves.
                           [1662] ... We tend to refer to the World Church as
                           something outside our particular constituency ...
                           and we mustn't forget that we must own the World
                           Church.
                           [1663] And this is something that came home to me
                           very much in Canberra.
                           [1664] ... We ... we are [...] from Wales ... and I
                           would like to say ... that all the Welsh
                           representatives were at one.
                           [1665] That we could own what was going on in
                           Canberra.
                           [1666] This was not entirely true ... of other ...
                           people from other churches ... in the United Kingdom
                           unfortunately!
                           [1667] ... The World Council of Churches assembly
                           takes pla , place roughly every seven years.
                           [1668] ... And though the World Council Churches was
                           formed ... before the second world war ... yet, the
                           first assembly was not held until nineteen forty
                           eight at Amsterdam!
                           [1669] ... Second assembly was held in nineteen
                           fifty four at Edmunston in the United States.
                           [1670] ... And then it was fir , er, the turn of the
                           third world ... the third assembly ... was held in
                           New Delhi in nineteen sixty one.
                           [1671] ... And then, the fourth assembly er, was
                           held in Loopsala ... Sw ... in Sweden ... and the
                           fifth assembly was ... er, held in Nairobi.
                           [1672] ... And then ... er, the sixth assembly in
                           Vancouver in nineteen eight three ... and the
                           seventh assembly ... in Canberra, last year.
                           [1673] ... Now, you'll see that ... it has a
                           tendency to go ... all over the world ... wherever
                           it is invited ... but whoever invites the World
                           Council of Churches now ... must, in fact, be able
                           to cope with a great number of people!
                           [1674] Not only delegates ... but also people who
                           attend as a service from other churches outside the
                           membership of the World Council ... and also ... to
                           cope with the press.
                           [1675] ... Unfortunately, in this country we were
                           badly served by the press!
                           [1676] ... And it had, it'd be true to say that
                           whatever you read in your newspapers ... er, while
                           we were in Canberra, I would advise you ... not to
                           believe half of it!
                           [1677] ... Or a quarter of this!
                           [1678] ... Because what came back to us was very
                           much tittle tattle gossip ... that people picked up
                           in ... er, Canberra!
                           [1679] ... And, it is true to say that that did not
                           represent the ... what really went on in Canberra!
                           [1680] Because, above all, it was an experience ...
                           experience of meeting people from different churches
                           ... wi ... experience of meeting people of different
                           cultures ... experience, too, of listening
                           attentively and worshipping with people of different
                           church traditions of your own.
                           [1681] ... And that was ... something to ... er ...
                           an experience to cherish!
                           [1682] ... The World Council Churches on this
                           occasion reviewed the work accomplished during the
                           seven and a half years since the last assembly ...
                           in Vancouver in Canada.
                           [1683] ... It rec , received a report therefore,
                           from the Central Council of the World Counc ,
                           Council of Churches ... which meets ... I think,
                           once a year ... Noel can correct me on this ... once
                           a year, or a at least once every two years.
                           [1684] ... And then we have a member from Wales on
                           the Central Council of the World Council of
                           Churches, Miss Carole who ... er, although she is
                           from Wales, member of the church of Wales ... she
                           now lives in Belfast.
                           [1685] ... But er, we were not successful in putting
                           up an ... er and er to have a member of Wales
                           elected on this occasion to serve for the next seven
                           years ... unfortunately!
                           [1686] ... And er ... i , it, this caused a great
                           deal of hurt, if I may say so?
                           [1687] ... And then the er ... Council also ... set
                           guidelines for it's programme in the years ahead.
                           [1688] ... It also chose presidents, it also chose,
                           a ... hundred and fifty members to serve ... on the
                           central committee, or the executive committee ... of
                           the World's Council of Churches.
                           [1689] ... It also made statements on pressing
                           issues ... in the church and the world.
                           [1690] ... And these, above all else included the
                           Gulf war because ... this ... war was on while we
                           were in Canberra.
                           [1691] ... And this really owed a great deal of
                           tension!
                           [1692] ... We er, the we, we have also to make
                           statements on the ... indigenous people and land
                           rights ... because we were confronted with the
                           position of Aborigine people ... in ... er,
                           Australia.
                           [1693] ... And we were concerned about their land
                           rights ... or in other words, their human rights
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Ida (PS005)                [1694] their natural human rights.
                           [1695] I'll speak about that in a moment or two.
                           [1696] ... We were concerned too ... about internal
                           conflicts ... in certain countries ... and
                           especially in South Africa.
                           [1697] ... But all these statements revealed the
                           desire of the assembly to pray more ardently for the
                           spirit of unity to reconcile ... people.
                           [1698] ... Indeed, this was a very rare opportunity
                           for all delegates and visitors, as I said, to meet
                           ... to listen ... yes, and to hear it first hand
                           about the life and witness of more than three
                           hundred member churches throughout the world ... in
                           a hundred countries!
                           [1699] ... It was certainly and opportunity for the
                           churches together to look at the world situation in
                           conversation together and thus, to deepen the faith
                           which have to proclaim ... at arriving at a common
                           understanding of the situation.
                           [1700] ... It isn't the ... you are not expected, at
                           least, I was not expected to ... to see the Council
                           producing masses of pages for our reading afterwards
                           ... and this report, by the way, is worth reading.
                           [1701] ... Sounds of the spirit.
                           [1702] ... If you had read this ... I shouldn't be
                           here this afternoon!

Ida (PS005)                [1703] But are we going to inflict that on you?
                           [1704] But, can I say this ... that what mattered
                           most to me was the fact that I have been in
                           conversation with so many people ... and to be able
                           to allow that conversation to affect my faith ...
                           and a faith that I have to ... proclaim day by day
                           and Sunday by Sunday ... from the pulpits of my
                           church.
                           [1705] ... As previous ... as in previous assemblies
                           ... worship wasn't central to our activity.
                           [1706] ... Besides, morning worship there were
                           midday sermons and in sessions ... together with
                           evening worship.
                           [1707] ... What I missed most at this occa , on this
                           occasion was the opportunity for bible study, but I
                           think ... getting pe ... er, a visitor of another
                           kind there was able to visit some of the bible
                           studies each morning.
                           [1708] ... The daily pattern of study and discussion
                           work was divided into two parts ... in the morning,
                           participants met in small groups ... in the
                           afternoon, all members ... met in [...] session ...
                           [...] sessions [...] reports from central committee
                           ... and also er, reports on developments in the
                           World Church.
                           [1709] ... The main theme of the assembly,
                           therefore, was ... the prayer ... come holy spirit
                           renew the whole creation.
                           [1710] ... [repeating in welsh] . ... Appertaining
                           to a [...] to infuse ... through dramatic presentic
                           presentations ... the main theme ... by the or ...
                           aboriginal of Australians telling about their life
                           ... and struggle.
                           [1711] ... Other Ecumenical topics presented were
                           the life and history of ecumenical movement ... you
                           retain and justice and peace ... ecumenical sharing.
                           [1712] ... and indeed, the recent programme justice,
                           peace and integrature of creation featured very
                           prominently in our discussions.
                           [1713] And no doubt, it will continue as a very
                           important theme for the future.
                           [1714] ... Some themes of the assembly therefore
                           were ... giver of life ... sustain your creation ...
                           spirit of truth ... set us free ... spirit of unity
                           reconcile your people ... Holy Spirit transform ...
                           and sanctify us.
                           [1715] ... What about the background, therefore ...
                           to the assembly's discussion?
                           [1716] But first of all ... the global situation in
                           the Gulf.
                           [1717] This marred the peace situation!
                           [1718] ... Plane flights had to be diverted ... so,
                           by the time we got to Canberra we were very
                           conscious of the destructive element ... of the Gulf
                           ... in our prayers and in our discussions.
                           [1719] Secondly, we were made aware of the effects
                           of what can be described as liberation thinking and
                           liberation theology ... not only in South America
                           ... but only, also, in the Pacific regions ... Asia,
                           Japan and Korea.
                           [1720] ... Then ... there was the influence of the
                           third world, or the two thirds world ... the
                           churches ... the politics ... and the cultures.
                           [1721] ... And then fourthly, more and more the
                           orthodox churches placed, played a very significant
                           part in guiding the port of [...] ... as far as ...
                           as the assembly was concerned.
                           [1722] Significantly to, there was the abstinence of
                           Roman Catholic church influence ... and dominance.
                           [1723] Some of us, some of us tried to make a plea
                           ... and I hope we will try, still try to make a plea
                           ... that there should be a significant Roman
                           Catholic ... er, element within the membership of
                           the World Council of Churches ... in the future.
                           [1724] ... So we were presented, as it were, with a
                           partial membership of the World Church.
                           [1725] ... As far as I'm concerned two things set
                           the assembly ... in context ... firstly, the sense
                           of space.
                           [1726] ... For many Australians the desert which
                           covers much of their country means ... a vast
                           emptiness ... solitude ... and the struggle to
                           survive in hostile surroundings.
                           [1727] ... But, for the original inhabitants of the
                           lands the desert is the familiar place that provides
                           nature ... and gives meaning to life.
                           [1728] ... It was natural, therefore, that the
                           assembly should take up this kind of understanding.
                           [1729] It was not too late to realise that space
                           should be given in the programme for a proper
                           consideration of the perception of winning in
                           relation to the whole team of the assembly.
                           [1730] ... Winning space therefore ... assumed a
                           significant part of the assembly programme.
                           [1731] ... Again, as I said, the Gulf war brought
                           the peace question very much into the arena ... and
                           accordingly there was always the pressure for prece
                           , reconsideration of the peace ... under the general
                           heading of peace space.
                           [1732] ... And, can I suggest that we need to bring
                           that very much into our discussions and into our
                           prayers constantly in our churches.
                           [1733] ... Significant that we have been challenged
                           by our master to be peace ... makers ... how real is
                           that in our churches?
                           [1734] ... And ... tomorrow will be the real test,
                           won't it not?
                           [1735] ... That we are really praying for peace and
                           identifying ourselves with peace struggle in
                           Ireland.
                           [1736] ... Secondly, there was also the context of
                           the Aborigines.
                           [1737] We were reminded of their plight at the
                           opening service of the assembly.
                           [1738] One thing I forgot to bring with me this
                           afternoon was a tape of the assembly worship ... I'm
                           sorry about that, but I don't think you've got a
                           tape recorder have you?

Ida (PS005)                [1739] That upsets me!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [1740] We were reminded of their plight ... of
                           peace, as I said, at the opening service.
                           [1741] ... Outside the [...] marched in ... the
                           aborigines had their fire of gum tree branches ...
                           to purify the atmosphere ... very much like the
                           flames of fire which appeared on the first whit
                           Sunday.
                           [1742] ... The twenty sixth of January seventeen
                           eighty eight ... the British established a small
                           prison community at Sydney Cove on the east coast of
                           Australia ... [...] villain read the declaration ...
                           and hoisted the Union Jack claiming the east coast
                           of the entire Australian continent ... for the
                           British crown.
                           [1743] ... And that meant ... quite a [...] effect
                           as far as the aborigines were concerned ... they had
                           lost their territory!
                           [1744] ... The aborigines were not consulted or
                           compensated!
                           [1745] ... European occupation of land gradually
                           extended through most of the continent.
                           [1746] ... In more remote areas ... reserves were
                           set aside for the igi indigenous hab , inhabitants.
                           [1747] ... They were ... sa , put aside, they did
                           not count!
                           [1748] ... But by the end of the nineteenth century
                           there were six British colonies in Australia!
                           [1749] ... On the first of January nineteen hundred
                           and one ... they formed a federation ... and most
                           adult aborigines were [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]

                           the federation.
                           [1751] ... The culture of the minorities of
                           indigenous people that ... was given providence at
                           the assembly.
                           [1752] ... And this was expressed in a very
                           imaginative presentation by Professor ... a young
                           [...] ... in her keynote lecture when she called ...
                           for three significant changes.
                           [1753] ... The first was that for our generation ...
                           we must learn how to live with the earth ...
                           promoting harmony ... sustainability ... and
                           diversity ... and, therefore, creation, spirituality
                           was the keynote of the address.
                           [1754] Secondly ... she said there must be a change
                           from the habit of dualism ... to, what she described
                           as interconnectialism ... We must see a relationship
                           between things.
                           [1755] ... In many parts of the earth, she said, the
                           organised life in accordance with a sense of dualism
                           ... body, spirit, man, women, black and white, poor
                           and rich ... we must try and see ... them, in Christ
                           ... coming together.
                           [1756] ... They all make sense.
                           [1757] ... The third change was from the culture of
                           death ... to the culture of life.
                           [1758] ... What is happening right now in the
                           Persian Gulf, she says, shows the best example of
                           the culture of death!
                           [1759] ... She urged the assembly to use the energy
                           of the Holy Spirit to tear apart all walks of
                           division and culture of death in separators.
                           [1760] Let us participate in the Holy Spirit of
                           [...] of life ... fighting for our life on this
                           earth in solidarity with all living peace.
                           [1761] ... Have you noticed ... if you listen hard
                           to your radio tomorrow morning ... and you will hear
                           so much about suffering and death ... and very
                           little ... about life!
                           [1762] ... I think we had better try and influence
                           that as churches ... not that we should ... [...]
                           about the suffering that goes on ... about the death
                           that goes on, but I think we ought to give all this
                           ... another dimension in churches.
                           [1763] ... That one would be ... thankful of the
                           fact that Christ ... has spoke ... and talked about
                           life.
                           [1764] ... Now, this approach ... was criticised by
                           the Orthodox church representatives as merely [...]
                           criticism ... an attempt to unify different faiths.
                           [1765] ... But many of us saw it as an approach
                           which emphasised the need to allow the faith of
                           Christ to be incarnated within particular culture
                           ... and Sir Paul , the former Archbishop of New
                           Zealand took the same stand point as ... a Maori, in
                           his own [...] address ... and called delegates
                           present to speak and act as people of hope ... and
                           to respond sensitively to economic and environment
                           progility and isolation, not only in the Pacific but
                           wherever they are.
                           [1766] ... Now then ... who do we assess [...] with
                           the assembly?
                           [1767] May I make ... one or two observations and
                           then I'll finish.
                           [1768] ... On the whole, the assembly gave us [...]
                           and understanding ... of the worldwide church which
                           was struggling to achieve reconciliation and to
                           promote peace ... [...] ... and justice.
                           [1769] ... If we belong to the World Church then we
                           must be ... in with ... part of this worldwide
                           process ... and we shall never be ashamed of it.
                           [1770] ... Secondly, moreover, it was an experience
                           a ... and an opportunity to meet Christians of other
                           churches.
                           [1771] ... Differing traditions and those of other
                           cultures and be in constant dialogue with them.
                           [1772] ... We never have that opportunity ... in
                           this country do we?
                           [1773] Unless we ask people to bring in people, for
                           instance, from the Afro- Caribbean churches to join
                           us in our worship and to lead our worship.
                           [1774] ... Can I also say ... that, er ... yes, we
                           were badly served by the press ... but I think that
                           er ... the onus now is on those of us who went to
                           Canberra to be able to share with others and ... we
                           have been going round to tell others about Canberra
                           ... to share with you and with others ... the
                           experience of being present in the World Council of
                           Churches ... in Canberra.
                           [1775] ... I would hope that ... by the time we come
                           to the next assembly ... where there is going to be
                           ... that there will be an opportunity for the
                           churches, er, at home here to take part in preparing
                           for the next assembly.
                           [1776] Also, that the churches at home, of whatever
                           church or denomination we are to be ... they also
                           can own, not just in ... the World Council of
                           Churches.
                           [1777] ... At present, I do think that there is that
                           kind of willingness to be ... er, engaged in this
                           kind
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Ida (PS005)                [1778] of preparation.
                           [1779] ... I think, we ought to be taking time to
                           try and ... prepare, well ... for the next assembly
                           ... and in doing so to own what goes on there and to
                           say, yes ... as the previous speaker said ... we are
                           the World Church in a very real way.
                           [1780] ... Now, moderator ... I've taken ... yes ...

                           [1782] Er, can I say that it's been a great pleasure
                           coming ... er, to you and to say that erm ... that
                           there's far more to say, of course, about Canberra
                           ... er, but I hope that that taster will help you to
                           try and appreciate what went on there.

                           [1798] ... We ought now to ... think briefly about
                           [...] .
Philip (PS004)             [1799] [...] is never to show any interest in
                           anything
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [1800] because, if you do you get landed with what
                           I've got to do this afternoon!
                           [1801] ... And ... it was my concern that churches
                           should know ... the implication of the children act
                           as it's related to ... the life of the church that
                           I'm ... landing in front of you.
                           [1802] ... You should of all ... saw the last Synod
                           papers ... received this.
                           [1803] ... How many of you are familiar with it?
                           [1804] ... There are a few hands.
                           [1805] ... I've got a red and a blue, I'm sorry I
                           haven't got yellow and green
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [1806] but I couldn't ... get the [...] political
                           parties.
                           [1807] ... It's not electioneering ... er, they're
                           just in different coloured paper ... to please the
                           eye.
                           [1808] ... Er, if you ... have not had a copy of
                           this sent to you ... what I have said to them, by
                           what I say afterwards ... erm ... it will be worth
                           purchasing.
                           [1809] ... My question ha , again another question,
                           how do you make the Lord interesting?
*** 12 (Tape 029101) ***
Philip (PS004)             [1810] Shoppers creche ... that must ... er,
                           registered.
                           [1811] ... What does registration mean?
                           [1812] It means that when you go along to the social
                           services, register and it's above board ...
                           children's work that you are doing.
                           [1813] ... But they have a right ... within the law
                           ... to carry out, to check all persons who are
                           offering help in caring.
                           [1814] ... And registration may be denied anyone who
                           has been convicted of any certain types of offense.
                           [1815] ... It's the responsibility of the local
                           authority to ensure that all those leading groups
                           ... are people of good standing.
                           [1816] ... The church must make every effort to ...
                           achieve the highest standards.
                           [1817] ... And the church as [...] bible road to
                           fame ... in alerting us to ... our responsibilities.
                           [1818] ... Now there's one thing that I have to
                           alert us all to ... the rest may not have been
                           important, perhaps only to some of ... the larger
                           churches ... but groups are advised ... and churches
                           are advised to make sure that in buildings that are
                           used ... ah, for many different groups ... that
                           young children under the age of eight ... do not
                           come into contact with any casual ... people who may
                           be using that building.
                           [1819] ... Now that is quite an implication when you
                           think about it!
                           [1820] ... There is need to emphasise the importance
                           of ... encouraging people to re , receive some sort
                           of training when they come forward and offer to be
                           involved ... in the work of our under eights and
                           young people.
                           [1821] I don't think there's any need for me to
                           spell out any more at this point what that may mean
                           ... but the ... responsibility in [...] as churches
                           to ensure that we care for the under eights.
                           [1822] I will, in fact erm ... answer any questions
                           afterwards.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1823] Thank you Nanette.
                           [1824] An introduction that is important.
                           [1825] There are [...] a number ar , of areas in the
                           ma state legislation that have been aligned to the
                           church, or will affect the running of the church.
                           [1826] One is the children act ... one will be
                           something on ... on on the ... preparation of food,
                           another will be one affecting the way in which ...
                           charities have to keep ... registered accounts ...
                           er, financial accounts ... which means that ... an
                           example ... erm ... [...] is responsible ... for
                           registering the accounts of congregations ... by
                           law.
                           [1827] And another will be ... erm ... the
                           responsibility to ... er, the minister, the ...
                           alterations to listed buildings ... which ... might
                           be landed on the, on the churches.
                           [1828] What Nanette has said has been an important
                           introduction and if yo , if what sa you have
                           prepared altogether ... is legible then perhaps ...
                           give it to Eileen and it can go out in the Synod
                           papers ... that will be helpful.
                           [1829] Erm, and in the faith and life ... department
                           of URC we'd better preparing a pack on the children
                           rights.
                           [1830] Other information on whatever [...] .
                           [1831] ... We move now [...] ... we move now to er,
                           faith and life ... is on ... we're on page ...
                           thirty five.
                           [1832] ... [...] moderator and friends [...] of
                           faith and life.
                           [1833] ... In the very short ... space of time that
                           we have ... available this afternoon ... there are
                           three subjects that I need ... simply to bring to
                           the attention of Synod.
                           [1834] The first the little report ... under the
                           heading of faith and life, on page five ... of your
                           reports ... the ... second ... is the report of the
                           provincial advocate which is on page six ... and the
                           third, the report of the Youth Secretary which is on
                           page twenty.
                           [1835] Erm ... all those because subjects come under
                           the general umbrella of faith and life, and I think
                           ... er, moderator, probably the correct thing is to
                           do ... is to be formal and to begin by ... er,
                           proposing that these three reports be received for
                           discussion.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1836] Then I'll receive the reports of faith and
                           life ... and the [...] Youth Secretary and ... the
                           new secretary for discussion, yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1837] Thank you.
                           [1838] Er, to take then ... first the report which

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1839] weekend that we are ... arranging this summer
                           as we have done annually for a number of years.
                           [1840] ... Er, there is a ... a little orange
                           leaflet which has been placed on the seats ...
                           during the day ... that many of you, I hope, already
                           have ... er, for anyone who hasn't ... may I ...
                           perhaps place these ... on the front table, there's
                           a ... the , there's another supply over there and,
                           could I please ask that ... some responsible
                           representative from each district would please take
                           a few more of these away with you so that they are
                           distributed in district meetings ... in the near
                           future, and attention drawn to them there ... er, if
                           there are not enough copies ... er, then I'm sure
                           the provincial office on receiving a, a request from
                           you will make sure there's more [...] ... that
                           passed on to you.
                           [1841] Now, if you had an opportunity of glancing at
                           the leaflet already you will have seen that the
                           leader ... for this July's ... er, [...] weekend is
                           is Mr Henry ... and, I don't think I can do any
                           better than to spend two minutes of the time that
                           we've got in asking Henry if he would ... say a word
                           or two of introduction to the theme ... for this
                           year.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1842] Ignatius of Loyal er or ... [...] ... er,
                           more ... properly known ... to me in church history
                           was the scourge of the wrath of the, of the council
                           of reformation and [...] inside of consumism but ...
                           I think regards some years ago in [...] on Ignatius
                           spirituality of [...] bibles ... which I'm delighted
                           to see John has mentioned in his prologue for the er
                           ... for his introduction to Holywell the the the
                           association's there ... came to discover who ...
                           Saint Ignatius ... er, helping to sort of tap
                           greater spiritual depths and er ... resources ...
                           and consequently trained as spiritual director ...
                           er ... in Ignatian things.
                           [1843] The spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of
                           Loyala have once, were once described as a sort of a
                           spiritual [...] from which people of past ... [...]
                           men, put together again.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1844] Erm ... that is not the aim of Trabecca
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1845] Er, to start off with they do the full
                           spiritual exercise of Ignatius Loyal all takes
                           thirty days in silent retreat ... with a ... with an
                           individual ... er ... under individual guidance with
                           a, with a, a director ... or ... it could take
                           anything from nine months to eighteen months to do

                           sort of retreat.
                           [1846] What I hope to do is simply ... to share with
                           you the life of Idigo ... and in experiences ... and
                           to walk alongside him ... and also to help us
                           reflectively to look ... and examine our own journey
                           ... where are we with God?
                           [1847] Where's God in our life, where has he been
                           and where is he directing us?
                           [1848] And so it'll be a gentle, I hope and ... er,
                           reflective ... type of weekend ... and er ... using
                           some of the tools of Ignatius ... and other tools,
                           cos Ignatius was very ... er, adaptable ... er, you
                           know in ... in methods of prayer ... and reflection
                           and contemplation.

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1850] Thank you.

                           variety of people will again, as you always have
                           done ... will turn up ... er, this year to share
                           fellowship ... a , on this ... theme which er, is
                           ... is a refresh theme I think for, for many of us.
                           [1852] ... Now, the other two subjects I'm really
                           only dealing because the ... people responsible are,
                           are not ... here in the flesh this afternoon ... but
                           Alyd the provincial advocate and I I think of Bill
                           that's also gone too, er yes he he has, he has had
                           to leave ... this afternoon.
                           [1853] ... Erm, so what I promised to do in er ...
                           er, a moment or two if people are to ask specific
                           questions or comments to make ... arising from
                           either of those ... printed reports on page six and
                           page twenty ... erm, if you would make your point or
                           ask your question ... now ... er, it will be
                           recorded and transmitted to the officers responsible
                           and they will take any necessary action or give any
                           ... reverent replies to those questions.
                           [1854] ... This doesn't preclude any private
                           questions in conversation with those people at any
                           stage during the life of the church.
                           [1855] So if, if there are any formal concerns that
                           anybody would wish to bring ... formally ... before
                           Synod and erm to either ... Alyd or Bill then
                           perhaps ... state them.

                           I've put, which is agreed by GP committee ... with
                           the exception of young ... these representatives,
                           that we ask them to bring thirty pounds towards the

                           [1912] ... That's the actual figure.
                           [1913] ... Erm ... one difficulty with with ...
                           giving a financial report is so many things seem to
                           ... happen quickly ... and a erm ... apart from the
                           fact that there was a, a major finance resources
                           comes from [...] ... we , as well you see ... that I
                           have to tell you now ... these have been done ... on

                           but a hundred and fourteen pounds ... and that means
                           that we have forty representatives we've got to try
                           and find four thousand five hundred and sixty [...]
                           .

                           I'm sure ... that not, that Eileen may correct me
                           that er ... we have er forty hundred pounds in the
                           budget, [...] budget ... for this ... er the erm
                           South Wales congregation [...] has, has kindly ...

                           I understand from the secretary of con , Cardiff

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1916] That will be, it is thousand so that's er ...
                           that's three thousand four hundred ... short of a
                           four by sixty.
                           [1917] And what the difference is that ... er, we
                           thought that you could have one young person per
                           district ... and that they only have to pay thirty
                           two pounds each, but I think these are only purely
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1918] Yes, er, I have them ... for those who ...
                           received that incorrect information from me, I must
                           apologise ... erm ... young people who are going ...
                           as delegates ... as representatives of their
                           district must be treated ... as adult ...
                           representatives and they have to pay full price.
                           [1919] ... Er ... for ... [...] , for people who are
                           going to [...] group ... and and, for any young
                           people who are going observers ... there are special
                           arrangements to be made which doesn't relate to our
                           official represented district, I'm sorry about that!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1920] So that means that er, in ... th the total we
                           do have to pay ... in some way or another, is four
                           thousand pounds with sixty ... but we'll say ...
                           we've already got three thousand four hundred, if
                           all the for , forty people go and they pay twenty
                           five pounds each, that's another thousand, so we've
                           got a ... I think I've got it right,a , we're only a
                           hundred and sixty short.
                           [1921] Fairly reasonable!
                           [1922] I hope we get that from somewhere.
                           [1923] ... So er er that ... that is if we're up-to-
                           date on the financial [...] .
                           [1924] Now, the most ... er, serious business ...

                           the first thing we discussed was the ... er ... the

                           the various provinces ... and we, by the end of
                           February ... er, the total was up to thirty thousand
                           pounds less than we required ... er ... which could
                           mean that ... the end of the year ... it could be a
                           hundred and eighty thousand pounds less than
                           required ... but ... er ... of all the [...]

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1927] ten and a half thousand ... from the first of
                           July onwards for this year.
                           [1928] Now ... erm ... i i in Wales, and I'm sorry
                           to say, our figure ... er, we should of produced
                           ninety thousand pounds ... and we provi , er,
                           produced ... er, eighty three thousand two hundred
                           and nine ... that means we are ... er, six thousand
                           eight hundred down in two months!
                           [1929] Now, we have a balance as it already tells
                           you ... er, in er earlier in the paragraph of this
                           paper that that we had a er balance of sixteen
                           thousand pounds ... a , in the [...] ministry last
                           year ... so, if we knock sixteen thousand pounds
                           [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1930] what we're likely to ... be short of ... it
                           seems to me we could end up being twenty four
                           thousand pounds short at the end of the year.
                           [1931] Now, there are quite a number of reasons for
                           this ... and the good news, I think, that I bought
                           good news again this morning ... is that
                           presentations both about budgets ... er, and about
                           what we do wi with the small churches ... is, er,
                           could be some of our salvation.
                           [1932] Question of budgets ... our [...] ... I was
                           almost [...] said halleluja!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1933] If only, all our churches could do that ...
                           we would really be getting somewhere!
                           [1934] The biggest problem of all ... is that we
                           can't look forward ... and that a lot of the
                           problems, being problems are happening now, and
                           happened since ... the er ... the first of January
                           ... that should of happened ... they should of
                           happened in th , in th , in the er at least the
                           three months before the end of last year, if not
                           more!
                           [1935] So, er, we're getting people saying it's
                           impossible to pay this ... even though they were
                           asked if they could pay it ... at the the the time
                           it was given ... sometime last July.
                           [1936] Well that's one ... the other reason, of
                           course we have got ... a large number of chur , very
                           small churches ... in fact, looking at our mai ,
                           ministry figures nineteen ninety ... there were
                           thirty churches that didn't pay anything to the
                           maintenance ... and a lot of these, I think, maybe
                           [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1937] that both ... Gethwyn and Russell sorted out
                           ... er ... who up ... on on those extremes that ...
                           you get in a group ... that, that maybe feel they re
                           ... that they really have nothing to, hardly
                           anything to do with us ... they've don't receive
                           ministry ... and why should that be, and after be
                           asked each year, has to go up?
                           [1938] And they see ... o ... I just wonder whether
                           they just pile letters in the wastepaper basket!
                           [1939] And therefore, if it can really come to this
                           possibility of ministry ... a sort of, Young Farmers
                           Club idea of getting themselves about ... that could
                           be ... a a a a, a, a marvellous boost.
                           [1940] So, the, the other thing which is er erm, a
                           real problem, partly because of that, is, is when
                           one talks about an increase in ... in giving,
                           increase in percentage i , or a contribution of the
                           church is ... in er, we were talking about twenty
                           percent la , twenty one percent last year ... that
                           would be alright if everybody gave twenty one
                           percent!
                           [1941] Those who did nothing, they can eas , easily
                           increase their giving by twenty one percent, it's
                           still the same!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1942] It means ... that the other people have to
                           give more ... that's why some of the churches, I
                           think they've found that their ... er, requests for
                           their er ... er ... their er contributions, have
                           gone up enormously!
                           [1943] So, er, those are the pro , those are a lot
                           of the problems that we are, we are facing ... now,
                           will we really ... er ... will we end up at twenty
                           four thousand down at the end of the year?
                           [1944] That i , all I can say is that my, that's my
                           best guess at the moment.
                           [1945] We know there are some churches which er,
                           will probably only pay quarterly, so they haven't
                           paid yet, so that's money that's coming in.
                           [1946] On the other hand we know there are some
                           churches that are finding great difficulty in
                           meeting ... er, what they've said they can
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1947] and are doing their best to do it.
                           [1948] So that's on the down side.
                           [1949] So ... er, at the moment they're saying ...
                           all I can see ... is that er, we would have to use
                           up the whole of our balance, that's sixteen thousand
                           ... and the twenty four thousand arrears.
                           [1950] Now, that as the picture ... er, leads me
                           onto the next er, stage which is what in ministry,
                           er what can we do in nineteen ninety three?
                           [1951] Erm ... a letter was sent to all district
                           secretaries, who I think in mo , most cases sent
                           these round to churches to see if we could get some
                           idea from you as to what sort of increase in
                           contributions could be possible for nineteen ninety
                           three.
                           [1952] That's quite difficult to do because where
                           there's so many churches not being sure whether
                           they're going to make it this year ... how can they
                           say what's going to happen next year?
                           [1953] On the other hand ... er, if we did what our
                           friend from Cheltenham is doing ... we would have lo
                           , we would be looking forward like that all the time
                           ... we would have some idea.
                           [1954] Now, I'm pleased to say we have had quite a
                           number of ... of er ... replies from churches ... on
                           what they think they can d , do.
                           [1955] On the other hand, some of these er ... are
                           good ... re positive replies and some of them, some
                           are negative!
                           [1956] And, it seemed to me ... that when I, as the
                           er ... your representative on Provincial Finance
                           Committee is asked to make a co , commitment for
                           this, for this [...] ... for ... er ... for nineteen
                           ninety three I could say no better than what we had
                           as out target this year and ... that was hard!
                           [1957] Cos clearly we've only er ... reached
                           something like five hundred, three thousand, four
                           thousand ... er ... then it's gonna be a ... a big
                           jump to get to the five hundred and forty!
                           [1958] Now, nobody er ... er,a at this stage at the
                           er ... Financial Resources Committee er, challenge
                           us on this figure, I think we will just [...] stage
                           of ... of doing arith arithmetic of adding it up,
                           but no doubt that the staff will be ... comparing
                           what going to be, er what within a ... but have
                           prepared [...] for next year with what we're
                           supposed to do this year ... and ours is an increase
                           of another percent.
                           [1959] ... We look at all the other conferences, the
                           lowest after that was the Northern Provence which is
                           in a very similar position to ourselves ... and they
                           were offering a five percent increase.
                           [1960] Er, a few others were offering seven to nine
                           ... and most of the others were offering between ten
                           and fifteen percent.
                           [1961] So we're way down on all the others! [...]
                           so, that then falls three hundred thousand pound
                           short ... of what is required to ... er, give
                           ministers an increase to twelve thousand next year.
                           [1962] There seem to be ... our two groups er, in
                           one of our provinces ... and they say that the rich
                           and poor but the rich ... er er are not so rich and
                           others ... [...] .
                           [1963] That, in fact, er ... there are three
                           provinces who are already now contributing more than
                           anyone else ... that, they feel that the churches
                           should go forward to try and raise the minister's
                           [...] to what was proposedly that the ... assembly
                           last year, they should be paid thirteen thousand two
                           hundred ... but in order to do that ... see another
                           six hundred thousand pound raised ... and it is
                           likely that this will be put as a challenge to the
                           churches ... at assembly.
                           [1964] Now ... if I could just remind you of what's
                           happened at the Lyndford Haven ... er ... er, Synod,
                           last March ... erm, the Financial Committee have
                           suggested that we should go for a target of five
                           hundred and ten thousand ... but ... er, this is ...
                           we are not gonna be able to ... even start looking
                           at the eleven and a half thousand if if er ... all
                           the provinces do it for months and more ... and we,
                           I think very bravely or foolishly whatever way you
                           li , look at it, proposed that we should got to five
                           hundred and forty thousand ... and it looks as
                           thought we're gonna end up ... certainly nearer to
                           five ten than five forty.
                           [1965] Erm, but if we er are are going to ... en ...
                           ensure that ministers can get ... er, at least
                           twelve a [...] of twelve thousand next year then we
                           have to er ... erm ... there has to be further
                           offers from provinces.
                           [1966] As I say, there are three provinces who'd
                           like to go further ... and than that be even ... er,
                           more increases.
                           [1967] Now, I have ... put down reports ... about
                           the finance committee ... er [...] as it were but I
                           think the responses from the churches and districts
                           ... [...] sort of calculator will be there, we think
                           that it would seem as though we should only offer
                           the same amount as last year.
                           [1968] But, I think if we have further discussions
                           with churches and districts that we might see that
                           we can break that ... a bit further ... for that
                           reason when we come to ... er, come to the
                           resolutions I would advise you ... er er propose a
                           minor amendment with the second thing.
                           [1969] ... But I think that ... er [...] .

                           [1972] So any questions or comments on paragraph one

                           it!
                           [1974] Yes.
                           [1975] ... So, if there are no questions or comments
                           on those paragraphs ... erm we move to the other

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1977] I think so, yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1978] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1979] Er, what I would like to propose ... the erm
                           ... a a that resolution two of course, was put down
                           ... at the time it had to be put down er, and is
                           clearly going to be affected by, that it happened at
                           the ... th the financial services [...] in March ...
                           and what I have suggested ... is that you might
                           prefer this be a a a second resolution [...] it is
                           or ... and turn to the [...] to add on the end of
                           that resolution ... thus urging local churches to
                           through their consultations with district treasurers
                           and finance committee ... to increase their
                           contributions to the Ministry of Mission Fund in
                           nineteen ninety three in such a way that provincial
                           commi , commitment may be increased by at least five
                           percent over the nineteen ninety two [...] .
                           [1980] ... But th , the thing is that it looks as
                           though it is going to be a fairly ongoing thing
                           that's going to ... it may be well on ... certainly
                           ... er a ... beyond assembly when we have to come to
                           a conclusion, and therefore we ought to know the
                           picture er, of, within reform churches far more
                           clearly in giving more time.
                           [1981] But, clearly we need to have the authority
                           that the ... that er ... to having discussed [...]
                           to ... a form of [...] .
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1982] And, If I understand this now
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1983] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1984] er, we have a choice ... the resolution
                           before us, [...] endorse the action taken by the
                           provincial treasurer ... in the level of commitment
                           he has made to the MMF fund in nineteen ninety three
                           on behalf of the [...] .
                           [1985] ... And that commitment which Alan has made,
                           I'm right Alan?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1986] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1987] Is a nought percent increase
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1988] It's nought percent.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1989] over our commitment.
                           [1990] ... Erm ... would you like to take that
                           resolution first ... and make this a sort of a, an
                           extra resolution
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1991] Right, okay then.
                           [1992] ... I think that will be ... that will be
                           clearer.
                           [1993] ... First of all if we debate now whether or
                           not the Synod endorses the action taken by judicial
                           moderator

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1995] in the level of commitment he has made to the
                           MMF fund of nineteen ninety three on behalf of the
                           provence ... and we now know ... that that's ... a
                           commitment, was a commitment of a nought percent
                           increase.
                           [1996] ... We'll debate that first.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1997] It's gotta be done first.
Philip (PS004)             [1998] Mm?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [1999] David?
Ena (PS003)                [2000] Can I just clarify
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2001] Stand up please!
Ena (PS003)                [2002] David , can I just clarify that this
                           resolution now supersedes ... what is said in the
                           report?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2003] No, er ... [...] we're proposing ... that we

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2005] Yes.
Ena (PS003)                [2006] the ones you've written down?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2007] Yeah, that's right, yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2008] The, because ... this report has been written

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2009] three or four weeks ago ... before Alan was
                           able to vet all the information.
                           [2010] And in view of the information he had when he
                           went to London for a meeting last Wednesday ... and
                           that was when he ... consulted with other people ...
                           deciding that he should offer a nought percent
                           increase.
                           [2011] ... Okay?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2012] So ... that's right.

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2021] Erm ... I think we need to endorse the action
                           taken by the judicial treasurer ... and then ... if
                           we was then to go onto ... second bits, which is
                           urging the churches to give ... five percent more
                           than that in the past ... you could debate that se
                           ... separately.
                           [2022] Investigative procedure will follow ... and

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [noseblow]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2025] Er ... Bob?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2026] I've got a question on
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2027] Bob!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2028] [...] does that mean that ... the assessment
                           for each church will remain the same ... for a
                           couple of years?
                           [2029] Is that the ... er, is that the implication?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2030] Erm
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2031] But does it still need, somehow
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2032] No, I can't
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2033] or other if the assessment will increase?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2034] It will vary because er ... erm ... er we we
                           ac ... remember that we have a formula which will
                           expose to what your ... er erm, nominated income was
                           in previous years ... what the membership, you know,
                           these have all changed ... so it could be ... i ...
                           I wouldn't like to say it's exactly the same ...
                           could be a bit of a problem!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2035] But also there you can [...] ministers ...
                           because minis ... er churches they count for more
                           than two years ... stop being central funds ... and
                           therefore, if we had too many
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2036] churches that ... entered
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2037] a third year of vacancy ... next year that
                           puts
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2038] more of a burden on churches with ministers.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2039] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2040] So i i it just depends on
Ena (PS003)                [2041] Thank you.
                           [2042] ... May I ... ask one more thing?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2043] By, by very special
Ena (PS003)                [2044] Oh!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2045] [...] !
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ena (PS003)                [2046] Erm ... in order to meet a commitment which
                           is the same as this year commitment ... then last
                           [...] ... here increasing last year ... because this
                           year's commitment we will not reach this year ...
                           therefore, we'll be into deficit!
                           [2047] Therefore, to pay ... that commitment again
                           the churches must be asked to give more ... and ask
                           the treasurer to make a further commitment ... and
                           the churches must ... find more again!
                           [2048] So it can't be the same as in churches ...
                           even if it stays in the profit?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2049] Any other comments?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [cough]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2050] Keep them coming!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2051] [...] ... to say [...] from what we [...] .
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2052] Right.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2053] Cos I don't mind taking this action ... erm,
                           I think the ... the thought is that I would like to
                           propose that we have a word with the government.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2054] Because I think that they [...] and that we
                           can only say ... [...] the same again next year when
                           our own [...] , everything goes up ... and, I think
                           it's very sad ... that the church can't [...] !
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2055] Is that a formal ... amendment?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2056] Yes it is.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2057] Is there a seconder to that formal amendment.
                           [2058] ... Does anybody want to speak for that
                           amendments now?
                           [2059] That we add the words with sadness ... to the
                           resolution?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2060] Could I, say also with sadness that in that
                           that, yes things are going up but one thing isn't
                           going up and tha , that's our membership.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2061] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2062] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2063] And that is ... as ... one of the members of,
                           we have a ... I think we can afford to have member
                           on the finance of churches ... who are called at the
                           assembly of the URC ... who er
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2064] Good, yes!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2065] in fact, erm anybody that says a lot of
                           sensible things and says look ... if people are
                           asked to ... er, to er ... increase their giving by
                           nought percent that me , it probably means the
                           church might have to be [...]

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2087] Others may give less because they've got a

                           [2088] ... And I would have thought us giving five

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2101] Any other comments?
                           [2102] ... The motion is before that Synod urges
                           local churches ... through their consultations with
                           district treasurers and the finance committee ... to

                           provincial commitment ... may be increased by at
                           least five percent over the nineteen ninety two
                           targets.
                           [2103] ... For those in favour please show?
                           [2104] ... And those against please show?
                           [2105] ... And that's carried.
                           [2106] ... So we move to resolution three on page

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2107] I think erm ... er ... I know there has been
                           some discussion of ... I I [...] about [...] ... er
                           ... and I put ... er, in this report I think all the

                           Church of England ... in Hemel Hempstead, I
                           discovered that their rate seemed to be about thirty
                           two P per mile.
                           [2109] You've got to work it out on the basis of ten
                           miles ... not on the basis of five miles.
                           [2110] I think also ... er, and this ... er, it may
                           be that the er ... er URC does not want to be pushed
                           round [...] ... er, we got up ... er, to how many
                           ministers this applies ... but I do know there are
                           quite a number of ministers ... which ... who need

                           license and even something for the maintenance.
                           [2111] Now, clearly if you were paid say ... six
                           hundred pounds for that ... and you only did twelve
                           hundred miles, you're getting fifty P a mile anyway!
                           [2112] And they've got, I think the odds are that
                           people are ... giving more perhaps ... er ... [...]
                           ... and that er, if they were paid at fifty four P
                           per mile ... and ... and got [...] how that would
                           affect the churches ... er ... contributions they
                           make?
                           [2113] ... And therefore, er our proposal is that we
                           should adopt the figures at the bottom of the page
                           which are actually those which the ... the er ...

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2123] Well I I shall leave you to go through the

                           [2125] Erm, I've worked for ten and a half years
                           within this county of Clwyd as a ... social worker,
                           regarded as an extensional [...] ... and every year
                           my employers ... er, who are based in London would
                           like the county to know what were the remec

                           [2126] Now, if Clwyd or Gwynedd or any other county
                           for that matter, within Wales or in England ... er,
                           decided that in themselves that they would not

                           so!
                           [2127] And certainly now that of course, ministers

                           I've been looking at one particular church, one
                           denomination ... er, which is the Methodist Church,
                           although it has been said already here this
                           afternoon, or this morning rather ... there are an

                           with United Reform Church ... and ... erm ... I have

                           September ... where it gives [...] and also ... erm,
                           mileage recommendations.
                           [2131] I'll be viewing the Methodist Church in quite
                           a different way, but I think it's very important for
                           us to be ... made aware of how they do it ... erm
                           ... for example, if you have ... erm ... a a [...]
                           or or and I don't think any church has, are provided

                           [2132] In addition to that you get depreciation ...

                           year ... which, by my reckoning is ninety five pound
                           a month ... in addition to that, as a Methodist
                           Minister you get a standing charge of five hundred
                           and twenty eight pound per year which is ... forty
                           four pound ... pe er, per month ... and then ... you

                           will see on the notice there a display of various
                           things that we do, and on the windowsills there are

                           [2142] The way in which society ... imposes an
                           agenda on us ... asks us questions in the churches.
                           [2143] I think we're not too bad in doing that.
                           [2144] But what we ... need to do ... as well, is to
                           listen wha ... to what the churches are saying as
                           they address these issues.
                           [2145] And I want to ... erm ... ask you please ...

                           representative!
                           [2146] We need to hear from the local churches, from
                           the district councils what's going on ... wha ...
                           what the issues that concern you are ... so let's

                           are any issues you feel we ought to be addressing
                           then please let us know so that we can put them on
                           our agenda.

                           who, that Synod received the report of the Church
                           and Society committee?
                           [2148] I'm assuming you've read that report?
                           [2149] Have you received it?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2150] Yeah.

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2179] You're so gracious John!
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2180] So ... it's just simply to er ... comment
                           about the ... the future work that's gonna be done
                           by Glanmole ... er, the work of investigation as I
                           understand it at the end of that first section.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2181] Really, two things brought up investigation
                           to consider ... the first is with [...] trusts ...
                           the very important piece of work that's done by
                           trusts on behalf of the provence ... another
                           provence may or may not know that there are the
                           trusts have now been ... er, between trusts ... erm
                           ... South Wales trusts ... erm
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2182] Monmouthshire
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2183] North Wales trust and Monmouthshire have now
                           all been amalgamated into one ... and we're working
                           through the implications of that.
                           [2184] And we have had the trust secretary who has
                           been working on our behalf voluntarily ... for some
                           time now.
                           [2185] I don't think anybody appreciates just how
                           much, and I would like to put it on record, how much
                           George does ... on behalf of the provence ... a very
                           considerable piece of work!
                           [2186] If you ... were part of the trust meetings
                           and saw the degree of work that he does do regularly
                           on our behalf it is quite considerable ... he
                           doesn't do it for nothing!
                           [2187] ... I can't imagine that George is gonna
                           continuing ... doing that forever ... and it may
                           well be that we'll be faced with a possibility of,
                           of what we do in the future ... to have that piece
                           of administration done ... will we be able to assume
                           that it could done voluntary in the future?
                           [2188] Or will it be part of the administrative task
                           of the church?
                           [2189] So I'd, I'd like that to be ... er ...
                           considered ... er, when this whole investigation is
                           carried on.
                           [2190] And the second point too, is to say ... is to
                           ask, at least to consider, whether then in some
                           centres the work of the Synod ought to be trimmed
                           down to match ... the particular work ... that is
                           being done.
                           [2191] I mean tha , is it all, you know, do we need
                           all the time to have ... erm ... extra
                           administrative help and in in, and in terms of which
                           we've been talking about before, I know they might
                           sound like two conflicting issues ... but one of the
                           ways of ensuring we get the work done ... is ... do
                           we trying too much at the Synod?
                           [2192] Should we be thrusting more work down to
                           districts ... and th , and they'll [...] to do the
                           job rather than always assume it should be done at
                           this level?
John (PS008)               [2193] I think, I'm not going to encourage debate on
                           that ... I think we've heard what Kenneth said ...
                           particularly about the trusts ... the working done
                           by the trust ... and would ... suggest that we ask
                           Granville to take that on board as well and be
                           within the ... presentations too.
                           [2194] And I think some would be ... the less about
                           the ... too much work perhaps being done by Synod
                           ... and not enough by districts.
                           [2195] I think it is something that we should ...
                           encourage churches to talk about, the districts to
                           talk about ... speaking of the district secretary
                           ... I [...] !
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
John (PS008)               [2196] But ... there we are ... I I think we'll just
                           take that on board like that.
                           [2197] ... Erm, resolution that Synod appoints Jo ,
                           John as Synod clerk for a period of up to three
                           years ... to commence at a date mutually convenient
                           to him ... and the present Synod clerk.
                           [2198] ... Those in favour of that resolution?
                           [2199] ... Any against?
                           [2200] ... Right, [...] .
                           [2201] ... I think ... erm ... we are not going to
                           say thank you to Eileen now ... because ... she is
                           not finishing as Synod clerk and that's a conscious
                           decision.
                           [2202] It may be that ... er, Eileen will be Synod
                           clerk this time ... next year as well we don't know.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
John (PS008)               [2203] Synod will divulge a degree of flex ... no,
                           quite seriously, a degree of flexibility ... and
                           we're grateful both to Eileen and er, to John ...
                           for allowing that degree of flexibility to take
                           place.
                           [2204] And Synod will of course will be informed ...

                           doing ... and will continue to do ... and we're
                           grateful to John for what he intends to do ... erm

                           [2210] But the background is that of fifty letters
                           were sent out to a variety of people ... er, lay and

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
John (PS008)               [2239] Erm ... so it had been thought about quite
                           seriously.
                           [2240] Is Synod willing to take this ... for the
                           general assembly as a nomination ... for ... erm ...

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2242] Could I, could I just ask what particular
                           element she has for Wales to nominate, why why, why
                           was Wales nominated [...] ?
                           [2243] ... Any, you know particular reason for that,
                           having got David here ... ah I I [...] I've decided
                           to go through actually.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2244] But how?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2245] But I I of course felt the [...] of giving me
                           something that he would be known by everybody in
                           Wales.
                           [2246] Er ... a and therefore, I would of thought
                           that was a ... everyone [...] ... but I'm just
                           wondering why it is that now ... what ... [...] of
                           Wales?
John (PS008)               [2247] Are there any other questions ... to refer to
                           district council?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [2248] No.
John (PS008)               [2249] Can you answer?
Bob (PS006)                [2250] Well I felt one of two ways, firstly when
                           we're looking for a moderator of the URC we're
                           looking for a moderator for the whole church.
                           [2251] And secondly, in terms of Liz ... Liz is
                           someone I know extremely well and have worked with
                           ... in various functions and committees over the
                           past.
                           [2252] We have someone always there ... for those
                           ... who have [...] er, society ... those who are
                           poor ... er, women ... er, many of the issues that
                           we feel ... very strongly ... and here, here [...]
                           She had no ... sort of cultural ... historic
                           resonance ... with the nation of Wales ... but I'm
                           sure her [...] ... and the way she approaches her
                           whole ministry would mean that she'd have a lot of
                           [...] than those of us here ... in the URC ... in
                           Wales.
John (PS008)               [2253] The resolution is, comes before you from Mid-

Alan (PS007) [2724] Oh dear!

             [2726] ... Oh the screen ... mm, about the same size.
Ena (PS003)  [2727] It's a little bit bigger ... I think you'll find ... if you
             put the tape measure on it you'll find it's a little bit bigger.
             [2728] ... Right.
             [2729] ... Right.
Alan (PS007) [2730] Presumably this is the power supply for it?
Ena (PS003)  [2731] Yeah.
             [2732] ... Woops!

             [2743] ... I'm not really worried about it.
Alan (PS007) [2744] No, I just, thinking it's easier if I take it down this
             way.
Ena (PS003)  [2745] Oh alright.
Alan (PS007) [2746] Then I pull it ... [...] .
Ena (PS003)  [2747] Now, [...] .
             [2748] ... Ultimately ... er ... they might change the lead on the
             end of that monitor.
             [2749] ... What's the matter?
Alan (PS007) [2750] I was wondering ... where the socket is.
             [2751] ... Oh I see where it's gone!
Ena (PS003)  [2752] Right!
Alan (PS007) [2753] I should have [...] .
             [2754] ... Oh there's plenty of wire.
Ena (PS003)  [2755] Oh yes.
Alan (PS007) [2756] Right.
Ena (PS003)  [2757] Now if I'd have been sensible
Alan (PS007) [2758] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [2759] which I really am ... I'd have brought over ... my
Alan (PS007) [2760] Oh!
Ena (PS003)  [2761] what's his name?
             [2762] ... My monitor.
Alan (PS007) [2763] Why?
Ena (PS003)  [2764] Well ... if I'd swapped monitors with you can pro ... and I
             don't suppose you'll wanna get rid of your Amstrad today
Alan (PS007) [2765] No.
Ena (PS003)  [2766] and you'll probably want to keep it for a little while?
Alan (PS007) [2767] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [2768] Oh hang on, moving leads and things ... don't stand up!
             [2769] ... Not just yet anyway.
Alan (PS007) [2770] Right.
Ena (PS003)  [2771] Erm ... I could of taken the black and white one
Alan (PS007) [2772] Mm.
Ena (PS003)  [2773] and then I could have shown mine to this lady, cos I mean
             the only difference is is the ... black and white isn't it?
Alan (PS007) [2774] Er, yes.
Ena (PS003)  [2775] Er ... I'll have another lead for you in just a sec ... I'm
             afraid.
             [2776] ... Hang on a mo ... just screw this in.
             [2777] ... Right ... straight under there ... [...] ... there is
             actually a power outpoint on this ... so if we can get the right
             kind of plug
Alan (PS007) [2778] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [2779] we could actually drive the monitor off the box and you'd
             only need one socket.
Alan (PS007) [2780] Well it doesn't really matter because I got ... and unused
             socket here.
Ena (PS003)  [2781] Yeah but I mean ... if you i ... in some ways it's easier
             ... cos then when you turn it off, you turn everything off.
             [2782] ... You see what I mean?
Alan (PS007) [2783] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [2784] Er erm ... there's a white ... plug ... have a seen a mucky
             grey, a white ... plug?

Ena (PS003)  [2792] That's in?
             [2793] ... We need the keyboard now.
             [2794] ... I got a ... er ... find out where that plugs in.
             [2795] ... At the back somewhere usually.
             [2796] ... Then ... we can turn it on and see if it all works.
             [2797] ... Can you hold that for a mo ?
             [2798] While
Alan (PS007) [2799] Yes.

             [2901] ... Oh well it doesn't matter.
             [2902] ... Fine, that's alright.
             [2903] ... I'll just add it to the end, that's all I was thinking.
             [2904] Sometimes the ... they make a fuss if you put them in the
             wrong place.
             [2905] ... No ... not at the moment.
             [2906] ... Yeah.
             [2907] ... Yeah, ultimately they might wanna ... end up with erm
             ... a mouse driver high but ... it's alright.
             [2908] ... Yes, I mean it does it for you doesn't it?
             [2909] ... Basically.
             [2910] ... Yeah.
             [2911] ... Oh.
             [2912] ... Yeah.
             [2913] ... I used to always load anti sys but I, then I found out
             there's nothing I ever I really needed it, so I took it out!
             [2914] [laugh] ... But I suppose you've got more complicated
             setups than me?
             [2915] ... What?
             [2916] ... Yeah.
             [2917] ... Mm.

             [2920] ... Now let's find out something!
             [2921] ... Just check that that boots properly.
             [2922] ... Control alt ... it's deleted [...] segment but we don't
             really ... need that.
             [2923] ... We'll let it just ... setup isn't really that e ... erm
             ... you can do fancy things!
             [2924] ... Er ... that's a ... I think what we'll do is we'll get
             used to it.
Alan (PS007) [2925] Mm.
Ena (PS003)  [2926] So I'll just [whispering] put that there.
             [2927] ... Would you be turning that round there [] ?
Alan (PS007) [2928] I can do that sometimes but I don't
Ena (PS003)  [2929] Erm ... no, soon as you get an ordinary chip dot bat ...
             file
Alan (PS007) [2930] Mm.
Ena (PS003)  [2931] erm ... it will ... it reads the clock [...] ...
             automatically.
             [2932] ... We'll just have to set it once but it hasn't done it.
             [2933] It's no good setting now because if there's no alt [...]
             dot bat
Alan (PS007) [2934] I ... it won't keep it?
Ena (PS003)  [2935] Yeah.
Alan (PS007) [2936] Mm mm.
Ena (PS003)  [2937] Oh!

Ena (PS003)  [2943] I'm always carrying it.
Alan (PS007) [2944] Here it is.
Ena (PS003)  [2945] I'm always sorting out people's computers for them.
Alan (PS007) [2946] Ah?
Ena (PS003)  [2947] I said I always carry Xtree, I'm always sorting out ...
             people's computers for them.
Alan (PS007) [2948] I see!
Ena (PS003)  [2949] A chair would help wouldn't it?
Alan (PS007) [2950] Yes, why not have one?
             [2951] ... Er ... would you prefer the chair or the stool?
             [2952] Have what you like.
Ena (PS003)  [2953] It doesn't matter ... one can have one.
             [2954] ... Ah, interesting!
             [2955] ... Aha!

             [2986] ... That'll take a bit of getting used to that! ... [...] .
Alan (PS007) [2987] How do you mean, it goes the other way?
Ena (PS003)  [2988] You turn it ... it's on the other side.
             [2989] ... Feels funny!
Alan (PS007) [2990] Oh ... it's done!
Ena (PS003)  [2991] Do anything different, you still turn it the same way to
             lock it down it's just
Alan (PS007) [2992] Oh it's just the shape of the thing?
Ena (PS003)  [2993] Just feels different!
             [2994] You can get used
Alan (PS007) [2995] Mm.
Ena (PS003)  [2996] to it quick enough.

Alan (PS007) [2999] Actually
Ena (PS003)  [3000] Doesn't take long does it?
Alan (PS007) [3001] No.
Ena (PS003)  [3002] Right!
             [3003] ... Let's have a look, look see.

             [3009] ... Yeah, this is a windows thing.
             [3010] ... You don't need it.
Alan (PS007) [3011] Lovely!
             [3012] ... Oh that
Ena (PS003)  [3013] Here?
Alan (PS007) [3014] Win eight twenty is?
Ena (PS003)  [3015] Yeah, so if you'd have been running windows on it.
             [3016] ... I'll check it.
             [3017] ... Files read only.
Alan (PS007) [3018] Oh well it doesn't matter.
Ena (PS003)  [3019] Oh!
Alan (PS007) [3020] I wouldn't worry.
Ena (PS003)  [3021] Okay.

Alan (PS007) [3027] Oh!
Ena (PS003)  [3028] Don't matter.
Alan (PS007) [3029] Well that's more what I'm used to.
Ena (PS003)  [3030] Xtree's more pretty in this isn't it?
             [3031] ... Where's the directory?
             [3032] ... There's ... er ... what's sub-directory known as?
             [3033] ... Handle? ... and then ... sub-directory in D-base!
             [3034] ... I think the sub dire , we don't want the Gem.
Alan (PS007) [3035] No.
Ena (PS003)  [3036] Cos I haven't sorted them out yet!
Alan (PS007) [3037] Mm.
Ena (PS003)  [3038] Er ... I'm gonna sit down quietly and do it one day ... erm
             ... it's ... and make a sub-directory.
             [3039] That's for storing.
             [3040] ... Can you scroll that down a bit?
             [3041] ... [...] ... Oh!
             [3042] ... Hang on!
Alan (PS007) [3043] Further?
Ena (PS003)  [3044] No, just as ... bit more, yeah.
             [3045] ... Leave your sub- directory as ... utils.
             [3046] ... Yeah, and I want to make the sub-directories so that
             can [...] .
             [3047] ... Make a sub- directory as ... .
             [3048] ... Make as sub-directory as WP ... [...] papers.
             [3049] It's gonna take as long as I thought cos I have to format
             it and install it.
             [3050] ... Make a sub-directory as Wordperfect fifty one.
Alan (PS007) [3051] Actually that ... is that a sub-directory or a main one?
Ena (PS003)  [3052] It's a sub-directory of the root directory ... it's
             alright.
Alan (PS007) [3053] I see!
Ena (PS003)  [3054] And that's it!
             [3055] ... And you've got a sub-directory which says DOCS.
Alan (PS007) [3056] Yes, what?
Ena (PS003)  [3057] Have you ever used that?
Alan (PS007) [3058] I don't think I have used it.
Ena (PS003)  [3059] Well you can always make ... no I don't need to make the
             rest because erm ... oh yes ... graphics!
             [3060] ... Make a sub- directory as ... graphics.

Ena (PS003)  [3063] Oh yeah!
             [3064] ... You have macros don't you?
Alan (PS007) [3065] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [3066] Just wanna call them the same things as you're used to.
Alan (PS007) [3067] Printers ... no print , yes printer will be the same won't
             it?
             [3068] ... Speller.
Ena (PS003)  [3069] You call yours speller.
             [3070] ... It's now
Alan (PS007) [3071] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [3072] on.
             [3073] ... Right!
Alan (PS007) [3074] Yes, that's the end by the look of it.
Ena (PS003)  [3075] Pardon me!
Alan (PS007) [3076] [sighing] Oh well [] !
Ena (PS003)  [3077] Right!
             [3078] ... Let's take that out.
             [3079] ... No, that one was brown that was.
             [3080] ... No, and that one was brown.
             [3081] ... I tend to keep them in the originals cos then I ... if
             I need to [...] .
Alan (PS007) [3082] Mm.
Ena (PS003)  [3083] Now let's ... [...] boot it and see what happens.
             [3084] ... No ... is it switched on ... [...] .
             [3085] ... Take that out ... otherwise it'll boot all the disc
             drive.
             [3086] ... Okay.
             [3087] ... Should be alright.
Alan (PS007) [3088] Good!
Ena (PS003)  [3089] Er ... Right ... can I have your ... erm ... all your bible
             ones?
             [3090] ... [whispering] There's some [...] [] .
Alan (PS007) [3091] We've had those!
Ena (PS003)  [3092] They're all
Alan (PS007) [3093] Ah!
Ena (PS003)  [3094] over there I think.
Alan (PS007) [3095] Yes, here they are.
Ena (PS003)  [3096] Oh ... don't really need this!
             [3097] ... Never mind!
             [3098] ... Is this the order you put them up in?
Alan (PS007) [3099] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [3100] Oh, so you'd like those in order, put back in there? ...
             [...] .
Alan (PS007) [3101] The only thing is, I did wonder whether the ... two ...
Ena (PS003)  [3102] What?
Alan (PS007) [3103] there's two files at the end which I thought ... maybe
             ought to be at the beginning.
             [3104] Where are they?
Ena (PS003)  [3105] In there.
Alan (PS007) [3106] Er
Ena (PS003)  [3107] They're all in one big directory, DOS
Alan (PS007) [3108] These two
Ena (PS003)  [3109] doesn't care!
Alan (PS007) [3110] You see those two are right at the end, and those ... I
             don't know whether those ought to be together ... before XX.
Ena (PS003)  [3111] Well it, they're
Alan (PS007) [3112] So
Ena (PS003)  [3113] all in one directory.
Alan (PS007) [3114] It doesn't matter?
Ena (PS003)  [3115] It doesn't care!
Alan (PS007) [3116] I see!
Ena (PS003)  [3117] It's called Bible isn't it?
Alan (PS007) [3118] Yes.
Ena (PS003)  [3119] Copy ... mm ... perhaps it doesn't like ... Oh, that's the
             only thing!
             [3120] ... You're gonna get ... used to that.
             [3121] ... The se ... there's no second ... star.
             [3122] ... In ... that er, Bible.
             [3123] ... Oh!
             [3124] ... That's cos I made a mistake! ... [...] ... if I ... did
             I forget to do a word there?
             [3125] ... No.
             [3126] ... Star
Alan (PS007) [3127] Oh!
             [3128] So that's drive B is it?
Ena (PS003)  [3129] Yeah.
             [3130] ... Star ... [...] .
Alan (PS007) [3131] I haven't ... bothered to make ... [cough] a label.
Ena (PS003)  [3132] No, I don't blame you.
Alan (PS007) [cough]
Ena (PS003)  [3133] Take them long enough wouldn't it?
Alan (PS007) [cough]
Ena (PS003)  [3134] Alright?
Alan (PS007) [3135] Mm. ... [cough]
Ena (PS003)  [3136] Right!
             [3137] ... I will get used this drive sooner or later!
             [3138] ... Boring this innit? [laugh]
Alan (PS007) [3139] Yes.
             [3140] ... Still ... it has go , got to be done.
             [3141] ... Well you could leave those [...] couldn't you?
Ena (PS003)  [3142] [shouting] No, it's alright!
             [3143] ... I like to check that it all works ... you know?
             [3144] ... Get a few things on it and check that it works [] .
             [3145] ... It won't take long.
Alan (PS007) [3146] Right you are!
Ena (PS003)  [3147] How many discs did you say this was?
Alan (PS007) [3148] Twenty one of them.
Ena (PS003)  [3149] Mm.
Alan (PS007) [3150] Er ... this one, yes I think we'll put that [...] .
Ena (PS003)  [3151] Yeah, no ... I'm putting them that way on top of each
             other.
             [3152] That's right!
             [3153] ... Hopefully another coffee?
Alan (PS007) [3154] I've ... just put the kettle on.
Ena (PS003)  [3155] Oh!
Alan (PS007) [3156] I thought you might be ready for one.
Ena (PS003)  [3157] Actually they spend more time ... changing discs probably
             than the
Alan (PS007) [3158] Than the actual copying, yes.
             [3159] ... Well you can't help it when you copy
Ena (PS003)  [3160] Well look at the speed it takes a disc onto the hard disc!
             [3161] ... Watch!
Alan (PS007) [3162] Now is that a file?
Ena (PS003)  [3163] That's a whole file! [laugh]
Alan (PS007) [3164] Oh yes, it takes long , spends longer reading than it is
             ... [...] !
Ena (PS003)  [3165] Oh yeah!
             [3166] ... Much longer!
Alan (PS007) [3167] Yeah.
Ena (PS003)  [3168] Well it's longer, it's about ten times as long!
Alan (PS007) [3169] Ha!
             [3170] ... Oh because that's the er
Ena (PS003)  [3171] That's a slow floppy innit?
Alan (PS007) [3172] Mm.
Ena (PS003)  [3173] Floppies are, that is terrible!
             [3174] ... [shouting] I'm up to book fourteen [] .
Alan (PS007) [3175] You what?
Ena (PS003)  [3176] I'm up to book fifteen!
Alan (PS007) [3177] Oh!
Ena (PS003)  [3178] Oh I'm more than half way through!
             [3179] ... Only nine left.
Alan (PS007) [3180] Good!
             [3181] ... [whispering] Suppose I could of put this ... out there
             [...] [] ?
Ena (PS003)  [3182] What are doing?
             [3183] It should be going down.
             [3184] ... Fortunately this'll be the biggest job of all!
             [3185] ... I suppose actually loading Wordperfect will be the
             slowest job of all.
             [3186] ... Always takes a bit longer ... doesn't it?
Alan (PS007) [3187] Mm.
             [3188] ... It's er ... there's not so many discs to load though.
Ena (PS003)  [3189] No?
Alan (PS007) [3190] There's not so many discs.
Ena (PS003)  [3191] No, but er ... I can't just do this with it!
Alan (PS007) [3192] No.
             [3193] ... Where are you going?
Ena (PS003)  [3194] Just wanna look at those.
             [3195] ... [whispering] [...] [] . ... I mean Autoroute's only
             about three files.
             [3196] ... Only got
Alan (PS007) [3197] Yeah.
Ena (PS003)  [3198] three discs so that won't take very long.
             [3199] ... D-base is what?
             [3200] Five at the moment.
             [3201] ... You know it says book forty, do you have to know which
             books you want to go into?
Alan (PS007) [3202] Yes ... erm ... er, it's on a file somewhere.
Ena (PS003)  [3203] Oh!
             [3204] ... No, is it?
             [3205] ... It's not the easiest thing to
Alan (PS007) [3206] No, that's one of the
Ena (PS003)  [...]
Alan (PS007) [3207] reasons why I've made little use of it.
             [3208] ... Erm
Ena (PS003)  [3209] Never mind!
Alan (PS007) [3210] I could probably re-name them?
Ena (PS003)  [3211] To make it easier to remember, except it ... maybe it
             refers to it, maybe it uses book something to refer to them.
             [3212] ... You might have to write the whole programme again to do
             that.
Alan (PS007) [3213] Oh well, maybe I'd better not try then!
             [3214] ... There's some coffee here.
Ena (PS003)  [3215] Sorry, I've nearly finished this.
             [3216] ... I'd like to get it done before I
*** 18 (Tape 029301) ***
Alan (PS007)               [3217] Yes for the, you know printing the leaflet
                           ...
Margaret (PS002)           [3218] How much notice do you require?
Alan (PS007)               [...] ...
John (PS008)               [3219] How quickly do they do it?
Alan (PS007)               [3220] The same day.
Margaret (PS002)           [3221] Ah.
John (PS008)               [3222] Only, I could take it to work, you know,
                           [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3223] Mm.
                           [3224] ... Er now then ... bring it on Friday and
                           show it to G to Granville.
John (PS008)               [3225] I'll ... I'll get another copy.
                           [3226] I'll leave that with Kenneth for now
Margaret (PS002)           [3227] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3228] and I'll bring one on Friday with me.
                           [3229] I did ask, I did mention it to Granville on
                           Saturday.
Margaret (PS002)           [3230] Aha.
John (PS008)               [3231] Because, you know, he said what it was gonna
                           cost him in the future.
                           [3232] So if we can save some cost
Margaret (PS002)           [3233] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3234] [...] But it's ... once you get more than
                           twenty copies [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3235] Yes.
John (PS008)               [3236] and that [...] makes the copying quite
                           reasonable.
Alan (PS007)               [3237] Oh I see, it's not an ordinary photocopier?
                           [3238] It, it
John (PS008)               [3239] Oh yeah.
                           [3240] But they've got two.
                           [3241] This one's called an, an offset
Alan (PS007)               [3242] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3243] printer.
                           [3244] You you've got an ordinary photocopier and an
                           offset.
                           [3245] The ordinary photocopier works out a bit more
                           expensive.
Alan (PS007)               [3246] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3247] But you see, using the offset ... [...] that
                           case be I don't know what's [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3248] Well he'll generally want about seventy
                           copies.
John (PS008)               [3249] Yeah.
                           [3250] In that way it works out much better.
Margaret (PS002)           [3251] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3252] Because there's an example there, you know,
                           hundred ... two hundred, whatever you want.
                           [3253] ... There's an example there.
Margaret (PS002)           [3254] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3255] Like, I just [...] really that ... we could
                           reduce the scale of costing.
                           [3256] A little bit.
Margaret (PS002)           [3257] Well why not?
John (PS008)               [3258] You know?
                           [3259] [...] It's gonna help my school and it will
                           help us as well.
                           [3260] It will do two things won't it? ...
Alan (PS007)               [3261] Oh it's the school do does it?
John (PS008)               [3262] It's the school does it.
                           [3263] Erm because we've got a printing system for
                           the school ... th they're, they're now letting out
                           their printing services to others in the community.
Alan (PS007)               [3264] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3265] Erm ... so i if you like it's, it's
                           officially done because therefore they're
                           advertising it ... in our last newsletter we send to
                           every parent
Margaret (PS002)           [3266] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3267] this advert went on the back of it.
                           [3268] So if anybody locally wanted [...] .
                           [3269] So basically all I would have to do is take
                           them with me and ... I'd bring them home on the same
                           day.
Margaret (PS002)           [3270] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3271] So it's done there and then. ...
Alan (PS007)               [3272] Apart from that I've got all the information
                           we want here [...]

John (PS008)               [3277] I thought ... but I thought it was erm ... I
                           mean you haven't
Alan (PS007)               [3278] Er no it's, it's ... no we haven't had two
                           sides [...]
John (PS008)               [3279] If you have two sides it'll be quite a few
                           won't it?
                           [3280] And sixty copies will be three pound.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
John (PS008)               [3281] Cos some of these places [...] in town,
                           people have to charge you VAT as well don't they?
                           [3282] Which is
Alan (PS007)               [3283] Oh yes, yes.
John (PS008)               [3284] what pushes ... well if you go to somebody it
                           pushes the cost up doesn't it?
Margaret (PS002)           [3285] Mm.
Alan (PS007)               [3286] And a lot of the commercial ones charge you
                           about ten pence a
John (PS008)               [3287] Oh some of them charge you ten plus VAT don't
                           they?
Alan (PS007)               [3288] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3289] Which is what adds it up you know, really.
                           [3290] So it would
Margaret (PS002)           [3291] Well [...] run out now because I've got all
                           the information I want.
Alan (PS007)               [3292] Oh ... well
John (PS008)               [3293] You wanna leave it with me Alan do you?
                           [3294] For Friday.
Alan (PS007)               [3295] Er ... I doubt if I, I doubt if I'll see
                           Granville before Friday.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3296] At least no if I do it will only be Friday
                           morning.
                           [3297] And I've got a funeral Friday morning I
                           think.
John (PS008)               [3298] [...] typing letters and that ... minutes ...

Margaret (PS002)           [3300] Oh yes.
John (PS008)               [3301] Erm they've [...] there's all the different
                           amount of things you've gotta learn [...] I mean ...
                           it's even different from a ... from a computer isn't
                           it?
                           [3302] You know it's [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3303] And a computer you've got a spellchecker.
John (PS008)               [3304] Well she's got a spellchecker on this one.
                           [3305] [...] got two capital letters
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3306] It's what?
John (PS008)               [3307] [...] it's got one small letter and two
                           capitals. [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3308] [...] ?
John (PS008)               [3309] No. [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
John (PS008)               [3310] Oh it's a, it's a, it's a good one.
                           [3311] We bought it from Smith's on Saturday, it's a
                           Brother.
                           [3312] But they were making an offer, if you brought
                           your old machine in they'd offer you thirty pound
                           off.
                           [3313] So we thought we may as well take it.
Alan (PS007)               [3314] Mm.
                           [3315] ... Yes I ... I've been busy today.
                           [3316] David's been helping me set up the ... I've,
                           I've just bought myself a three eight six.
John (PS008)               [3317] Oh.
Alan (PS007)               [laugh] ...
Margaret (PS002)           [3318] Well I've got er an electric typewriter.
                           [3319] Originally my son had it and he went over to
                           a printer.
Alan (PS007)               [3320] Mm.
John (PS008)               [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3321] A computer and a printer, mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3322] A wordprocessor?
Margaret (PS002)           [3323] A wordprocessor, yeah [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3324] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3325] You see the beauty of ... the beauty of the
                           ... computer or wordprocessor compared to an
                           electronic typewriter is you can finish your
                           document and then do your spellcheck.
Margaret (PS002)           [3326] Yes.
Alan (PS007)               [3327] Whereas with the electronic typewriter you've
                           got to do it er
Margaret (PS002)           [3328] Oh yeah.
                           [3329] Yes [...] .
                           [3330] It's really a better, faster ty ordinary
                           typewriter in a way.
Alan (PS007)               [3331] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [3332] [...] .
                           [3333] Otherwise they're pretty well the same as an
                           ordinary typewriter.
                           [3334] ... But er with a wordprocessor of course you
                           can alter things.
Alan (PS007)               [3335] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [3336] You can er [...]

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3338] And of course you can shift er ... a block.
                           [3339] Move it that way or some sort of thing.

                           is Idris, so ... I don't
Philip (PS004)             [3362] Yes I have an apology from Idris.
                           [3363] He rang me up last night ... to say that he
                           is more or less confined to barracks now in the
                           evening now that Phil is home.
Alan (PS007)               [3364] Mm.
Philip (PS004)             [3365] He can't leave her.
                           [3366] And he erm sends his apologies.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3367] Apology from Mrs , she's not too well
                           tonight.
Alan (PS007)               [3368] Right.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3369] Erm Mrs erm Eileen , one of our elderlies,
                           she's tied up with her husband who's in hospital.
Alan (PS007)               [3370] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Philip (PS004)             [3371] And Mrs is ill as you know, Rhoda is ill.
                           [3372] And an apology from Merle from Salisbury
                           Park.
Alan (PS007)               [3373] Right.
                           [3374] ... Erm ... from the eighth chapter of the
                           letter to the Romans ... [reading] For we are saved
                           by hope.
                           [3375] But hope that is seen is not hope.
                           [3376] For what a man seeth, why does he yet hope
                           for?
                           [3377] ... But if we hope for that we see not ...
                           then do we with patience wait for it.
                           [3378] Likewise the spirit also helpeth our
                           infirmities.
                           [3379] For we know not to what we should pray for as
                           we ought.
                           [3380] But the spirit itself maketh intercession for
                           us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
                           [3381] And he that searches the hearts knoweth what
                           is the mind of the spirit because he maketh
                           intercession for the saints according to the will of
                           god.
                           [3382] And we know that in all things god works for
                           good for them that love him.
                           [3383] To them who are called according to his
                           purpose [] .
                           [3384] Let us pray.
                           [3385] ... Father we pray ... that you will work for
                           good with us.
                           [3386] ... Help us as we look to the future.
                           [3387] ... May we be guided by your spirit.
                           [3388] ... May ou your spirit guide our prayers and
                           our thoughts ... and our hopes.
                           [3389] ... And father we pray that our hope may not
                           be in vain ... but ... may lead us ... to sharing
                           again in your kingdom.
                           [3390] ... And father we pray too for those who are
                           not well and unable to come.
                           [3391] ... May they be sustained and kept according
                           to their need.
                           [3392] And father we pray for ourselves.
                           [3393] ... And we pray too for those whom we
                           represent.
                           [3394] That we may work together according to your
                           will so that you may work for good in us.
                           [3395] Amen.
                           [3396] ... Er ... Sadly, although I sent you a
                           letter with suggestions for discussion I forgot to
                           keep a copy of it for myself.
                           [3397] So, but I hope ... if I stray too far from
                           the path somebody will remind me.
                           [3398] I suggest that the first thing is erm ...
                           comments on ... what recommendation you will be
                           thinking of making to the church ... in regard to
                           the visit of er Mr and Mrs .
                           [3399] ... Has anybody anything to say? ...
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3400] No, and do you want this?
Alan (PS007)               [3401] Oh, maybe I should have it.
                           [3402] ... Thank you.
                           [3403] ... Erm
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3404] Well I think er ... several points should be
                           ventilated and er I, I think the, while you're doing
                           the agenda this evening you could add something to
                           each item in turn
Alan (PS007)               [3405] Mm.
                           [3406] ... Erm
John (PS008)               [3407] The only thing one would say though whilst
                           agreeing with [...] ... some of the, the matters
                           perhaps that may be aired have a bearing on the
                           other matters in the agenda.
                           [3408] Perhaps number one ... the one that's in the
                           first paragraph
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3409] Yes.
John (PS008)               [3410] [...] ... I'll be in a position tonight,
                           perhaps after some discussion, to make a
                           recommendation one way or the other.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3411] Yes.
                           [3412] Well ... well er ... yes well ... [sigh] from
                           what I've already learnt, and I've got to be rather
                           blunt in this matter, I'm afraid that ... Carol 's
                           ... expectations
John (PS008)               [3413] John .
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3414] John rather's expectations regarding the
                           amounts, they're very ambitious indeed and ... I
                           can't speak for Salisbury Park but if we're expected
                           to pay a share of ... any alterations and so forth
                           erm it would be very difficult for us to meet that
                           commitment.
Alan (PS007)               [3415] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3416] Because we ... er if, if his erm ... if his
                           er desires were carried out we'd, well we'd be
                           talking about thousands of pounds.
                           [3417] Literally.
                           [3418] And the [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3419] Mm. ...
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3420] I don't know whether I've spoken out of place
                           because I'm not a member of Salisbury park but on
                           the assumption that erm ... that we would have to
                           share in the
Alan (PS007)               [3421] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3422] expense you see.. of any changes. ...
Alan (PS007)               [3423] Are there any other comments on his visit?
                           [3424] ... Er ...
John (PS008)               [3425] Well ju just to keep the ball rolling, my
                           first impressions were good and he seemed to ... be
                           er ... there was some drive about them.
                           [3426] His sermon er ... well it was erm a
                           reasonable sermon.
                           [3427] We're not going to get a good preacher.
                           [3428] The good preacher can get a much better
                           church than this set up.
                           [3429] So we're er ... we're sort of well down the
                           list as far as that's concerned.
                           [3430] Erm ... at first I was slightly put off by
                           his choosing Cain and Abel as er
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3431] [...] certainly yeah.
John (PS008)               [3432] the start the sermon but it, it seemed to er
                           develop reasonably.
                           [3433] Erm ... but I was er that was my own
                           impression.
                           [3434] I rather admired what he's doing for Margaret
                           because, as far as I can see, he's taking ... er as
                           she's not able, as far as I can see, to er exist, to
                           ... live on her own and he seems to be taking over
                           from elderly parents.
                           [3435] But erm ... I was er ... somewhat put off
                           altogether by comments I heard from people who had
                           been in much closer contact than I was because I, I
                           saw him ... very little of him really.
                           [3436] So I think other people have er ... a
                           contribution to make which is, well it would be
                           important. ...
Alan (PS007)               [3437] Anybody else with a comment?
Philip (PS004)             [3438] Well personally I mean ... erm ... Margaret
                           impressed me greatly but I think ... John was ...
                           inclined to be full of his own importance for one
                           thing.
                           [3439] He was exceptionally demanding and ... my ...
                           fairly long conversation was that he almost lead me
                           to believe that he had got the job because when he
                           started making comments about putting his
                           grandfather clocks in the church ... er thirty of
                           them.
                           [3440] And building a [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3441] [laugh] Thirty grandfather clocks?
Philip (PS004)             [3442] Yes.
Alan (PS007)               [3443] Oh goodness!
Margaret (PS002)           [3444] What, thirty? [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [3445] Thirty, yes.
Margaret (PS002)           [3446] Or or one [...] ?
Philip (PS004)             [3447] He said he was a collector of antiques so I
                           said I'd better keep out of the way.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [3448] Three O he said.
                           [3449] But the other thing that worried me, he was
                           inclined to be ... erm ... mind you I felt
                           aggression in his sermon a little, but he did
                           incline to be very uptight.
                           [3450] Nervous.
                           [3451] And I feel that erm coming to a good
                           pastorate, I think he would ... with his history of
                           having had trouble, trouble ... I think possibly he,
                           he ... he would be ill
Alan (PS007)               [3452] Mm.
Philip (PS004)             [3453] Because he was, he was a bundle of nerves, he
                           couldn't keep still.
                           [3454] And er ... you know he was ... I mean for
                           instance at Salisbury Park he probably didn't mean
                           anything but on Saturday when I was saying goodbye
                           to him he said ... now I hope there'll be somebody
                           here at ten past ten to open this church tomorrow.
                           [3455] I like to be here half an hour before the
                           service.
                           [3456] So I said well I said, I usually try to get
                           here quarter past ten or soon after ... but it all
                           depends on traffic because I live the other end of
                           the town.
                           [3457] ... Er however, I got there at quarter past
                           ten and he followed me in.
                           [3458] And then, no sooner got in he said by the
                           way, two glasses of water for me.
                           [3459] I'm a two glass water man.
Alan (PS007)               [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [3460] So I said it's quite alright Mr , we're not
                           very well off in Salisbury Park but we do possess a
                           carafe and that holds three.
Alan (PS007)               [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [3461] And then he said here's the hymns, put those
                           hymns up now.
                           [3462] I said that's not my job, it's the organist.
                           [3463] But I thought oh dear me.
                           [3464] That was ... my feeling and I feel ... that
                           er
John (PS008)               [3465] Not conducive to a [...]
Philip (PS004)             [3466] Not, not for Salisbury Park.
                           [3467] Not for me.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3468] No.
                           [3469] I'll, I can endorse that by saying that we
                           shouldn't, as I noticed a certain offhandedness with
                           him that I didn't like at all.
Alan (PS007)               [3470] Mhm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3471] I, I, I don't know why he talks that [...] of
                           attitude but there we are. ...
Ida (PS005)                [3472] Mr chairman as a colleague I ... felt he was
                           alright.
Alan (PS007)               [3473] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3474] We had a ... quite good fellowship together.
                           [3475] I heard him here ... and I think our people
                           was ... well impressed in some respect.
                           [3476] We endorse what you said.
                           [3477] There was a terrible nervousness which you
                           don't expect from a man of that age, and of that
                           standing in the ministry.
                           [3478] And then it was further endorsed because I
                           went to hear him at Johnstown and I thought to
                           myself well ... I felt sorry that he was erm ...
                           what's the word I want?
                           [3479] Well he was erm, oh I can't think of the word
                           I want now but er he, he was glued to his notes
                           [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3480] Mhm.
Ida (PS005)                [3481] You know?
                           [3482] There was no freedom.
                           [3483] No freedom.
                           [3484] Erm ... not really and it was a, a different
                           type of sermon.
John (PS008)               [3485] Yes.
Ida (PS005)                [3486] Er ... I felt another thing which I, I wasn't
                           too happy about but then again one can ... soon
                           change these things.
                           [3487] For instance the, the hymns that he all had,
                           I presume at Salisbury Park ... er certainly with us
                           ... and at Johnstown and at the Rio where there's no
                           alternative, was all from the congregation [...]
John (PS008)               [3488] Yes [...] yes.
Ida (PS005)                [3489] Now ... [sigh] he knew beforehand because we
                           told him when he came, first came here that we also
                           use Mission Praise, and you do.
John (PS008)               [3490] And we do.
Ida (PS005)                [3491] I, I would have thought, personally, I would
                           have thought he would at least have chosen one from
                           Mission Praise for the benefit of the be for the
                           people who, who like
Alan (PS007)               [3492] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3493] that sort of thing, you see.
                           [3494] And I think [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3495] Well you do get more modern hymns in that
                           don't you?
Ida (PS005)                [3496] Beg your pardon?
Alan (PS007)               [3497] You get more modern hymns in that.
Ida (PS005)                [3498] More modern hymns and I should have thought,
                           you know, er ... I would have liked him being a
                           little more up to date
Alan (PS007)               [3499] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3500] in that respect.
                           [3501] Personally.
                           [3502] ... I liked him as a man and I thought er Mrs
                           was a delightful lady.
                           [3503] She was a very sweet person.
John (PS008)               [3504] Oh she was delightful.
                           [3505] Yes, yeah.
Ida (PS005)                [3506] Erm ... but I think I can ... agree with what
                           Norah has said ... er er er regarding the
                           possibility of aggressiveness there.
Philip (PS004)             [3507] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3508] If I may just add one other thought.
                           [3509] Whoever the minister that comes to us, I
                           think that they should accept the manse without
                           question.
                           [3510] That's what we like to do brethren.
Alan (PS007)               [3511] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3512] All down through the years.
                           [3513] Haven't we?
Alan (PS007)               [3514] Yes.
Ida (PS005)                [3515] Some of them being too large.
                           [3516] But we've had to bear with it.
                           [3517] Too cold ... but we've had to bear with it.
                           [3518] And why there should be such a change these
                           days in that line I, I, I can't quite agree with it.
                           [3519] Er for two persons, two people, that manse
                           was adequate I would say.
                           [3520] I was delightfully surprised with it myself.
                           [3521] ... A reasonable
Philip (PS004)             [3522] Well I know you were all seemed to be s ...
                           you were all amazed when you went in.
                           [3523] I could tell by the expression on your faces
                           when ... only I felt
Ida (PS005)                [3524] Yes I was amazed.
Philip (PS004)             [3525] it was only fair to take them in and then
                           they know
Alan (PS007)               [3526] I think,ye
Philip (PS004)             [3527] what we were talking about.
                           [3528] Well [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3529] Yes you did right.
Philip (PS004)             [3530] But each one said ooh it's not as small as we
                           thought it was you see.
Alan (PS007)               [3531] Mm.
Philip (PS004)             [3532] But erm ... it's just having that one room
                           with a kitchen I think for ... if someone calls
                           probably you see.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3533] Mm.
                           [3534] Nice little room though.
John (PS008)               [3535] It could be.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3536] True.
                           [3537] Table and a couple of chairs and ... portable
                           television if you want it.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3538] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3539] Quite nice.
                           [3540] And adequate.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3541] But er you know reasonable demands are all
                           well and good.
                           [3542] Perhaps if he, if he, if he could ask a thing
                           like this then I'm sure ... Salisbury Park would
                           oblige.
                           [3543] But you know, if he's saying, well we do, we
                           would like the house ... redecorated all well and
                           good.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3544] Oh well yes those are those are normal
                           things.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3545] No but as erm ... Mrs has mentioned to me,
                           when it comes to er converting an existing garage
                           into a den or a study and then asking for another
                           garage to be built.
                           [3546] Well ... you know, it's not good enough is
                           it?
John (PS008)               [3547] I would think that's out because it would
                           destroy the value of the house er that, that has got
                           to be sold some time.
Philip (PS004)             [3548] House, of course, and it wouldn't suit
                           another person would it?
Alan (PS007)               [3549] Yeah.
John (PS008)               [3550] But er I wouldn't agree that that er manse i
                           that house is suitable for a manse.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3551] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3552] It wants at least one more room downstairs.
                           [3553] It would be very unfair to er Margaret that
                           every time somebody called she's got, she's banished
                           to the kitchen.
                           [3554] And er ... he, he could use the er ... h his
                           vestry or another room at the, the church but
                           somebody calling in the evening, he's not going to
                           take them over to a ... a cold room for an
                           interview.
Margaret (PS002)           [3555] But, but if he knew, if he knew Ken that they
                           were coming.
                           [3556] You know?
John (PS008)               [3557] Ah but then he wouldn't necessarily.
Margaret (PS002)           [3558] Mm.
                           [3559] But most people duly come surely make an
                           appointment?
                           [3560] But I, I think
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3561] No, some do some don't.
Margaret (PS002)           [3562] I ... think in some way here, with this
                           particular situation ... as okay we, we go into the
                           question of the house now ... the house shouldn't be
                           the issue here.
John (PS008)               [3563] No.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3564] Oh no, not ... not [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3565] Wi with this situation the
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3566] The question has been raised, that's right
Margaret (PS002)           [3567] Erm obviously the er ... and ... as Alan's
                           asked us few weeks ago, permission to explore ...
                           maybe looking for the finances, if and when it
                           became the situation.
John (PS008)               [3568] That's right.
Margaret (PS002)           [3569] But if er John came last week and to all of
                           us ... we were of a like mind that yes, he fitted
                           the calling here [...] everything else ... I, I see
                           then that the manse would be the issue but ...
                           basically now we're talking in many ways ... other
                           issues are affecting the call here ... than the
                           manse so therefore the manse goes down the, the
                           pecking order.
Alan (PS007)               [3570] Erm
Margaret (PS002)           [3571] But basically the matter we consider [...] is
                           John the suitable man for the ministry?
Alan (PS007)               [3572] Yes I I think ... I think that is the proper
                           order to do things.
John (PS008)               [3573] Yes.
Alan (PS007)               [3574] I think first of all we want to know ... er
                           as far as it's possible, which of course is always
                           er ... within the limitations of our abilities
                           whether we think he's a man that we can recommend to
                           the church, that they should call him.
                           [3575] Now the people I've heard speaking so far ...
                           don't seem to think so.
                           [3576] Is there anybody who disagrees with that
                           assessment?
                           [3577] Just to complete the picture.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3578] Well [clears throat] we had him for the
                           weekend and er ... looking back on the weekend ...
                           we were reasonably impressed with the man and his
                           wife.
                           [3579] And er from his conversation ... he appeared
                           ... to be a homely sort of a chap and er ... he was
                           outspoken but he would call a spade a spade.
                           [3580] ... Er ... in church his diction was clear
                           for all to hear.
                           [3581] He spoke well to the children ... and er his
                           sermon message did have a, a reasonable amount of
                           substance in it.
                           [3582] But under the circumstances of being there on
                           trial, I did feel that he was ... very nervous.
                           [3583] Er the Saturday evening we ... were in the
                           lounge and ... chatting away for two or three hours
                           and he, he could not keep still.
                           [3584] He was
Philip (PS004)             [3585] Mm that's right yeah.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3586] moving to the left and to the right and
                           sliding down.
Philip (PS004)             [3587] Down and moving his seat [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3588] He, he
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3589] He's uncomfortable.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3590] He was uncomfortable.
                           [3591] And when he was in the pulpit I felt that he
                           was ... there was tension ... there was tension
                           there
Alan (PS007)               [3592] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3593] Er whether ... he did say in a conversation
                           that he, he knows when this nervousness er er and
                           depression is coming on and he takes medication and
                           it's alright.
                           [3594] But er ... that's to be seen [...] ...
Philip (PS004)             [3595] I might add that Idris rang me up last night,
                           I was on the telephone for about three quarters of
                           an hour with him.
Alan (PS007)               [3596] That's typical Idris. [laugh]
Philip (PS004)             [3597] But he did ring up.
                           [3598] He [laugh] he said ... you're one person I
                           can talk to, you listen to me and I can talk to you
                           and er he didn't want to worry you at that time but
                           ... for him, he didn't think he was suitable.
                           [3599] Even Idris who er they're desperate for ...
                           but he Idris didn't think ... you know, he could
                           cope with the four churches.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3600] Well Idris rang me up last night which is not
                           unusual because he often rings, you know
Philip (PS004)             [3601] Yeah.
Ida (PS005)                [3602] once a week to me and I ring him
                           occasionally, and er [laugh] his first remark which
                           was quite erm natural he said well you know Ernest,
                           he said ... I've heard many ministers.
Philip (PS004)             [3603] Yes [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [3604] Like we all have, haven't we?
                           [3605] And we're, we're all ... guilty of being
                           critics.
Philip (PS004)             [3606] Mm.
                           [3607] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3608] But erm Idris said, in effect, which is an
                           expression which we've all used at some time or
                           another, he did nothing for me.
Philip (PS004)             [3609] That's right, yes.
Ida (PS005)                [3610] In inverted commas.
                           [3611] He did nothing for me.
Philip (PS004)             [3612] Mm.
                           [3613] Mm.
                           [3614] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3615] You see?
                           [3616] And er ... I knew what Idris was referring to
                           you see.
John (PS008)               [3617] I thought [...]
Ida (PS005)                [3618] Somehow or another erm ... Idris and I have
                           clicked, somehow or another ... and erm I understand
                           him and he understands me.
Alan (PS007)               [3619] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3620] And that's how we've er been able to get on
                           so well together
Philip (PS004)             [3621] Yes, same here.
                           [3622] Same here.
Ida (PS005)                [3623] you know?
Philip (PS004)             [3624] Yeah.
Ida (PS005)                [3625] Er ... but I would add this to you know ...
                           please do not depend in any way upon Beria
Philip (PS004)             [3626] No cos he
Ida (PS005)                [3627] Because it's ... it's folding up, it's dying
                           quickly.
Philip (PS004)             [3628] Yes.
Alan (PS007)               [3629] I'm, I'm afraid that is so.
Ida (PS005)                [3630] That is so.
Alan (PS007)               [3631] I, I don't ... I honestly don't know what
                           we're going to do about Beria
Ida (PS005)                [3632] No I don't, but ... So it's more or less a
                           threesome if anything at all.
Alan (PS007)               [3633] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3634] Really.
Gethyn (PS009)             [3635] I thought his nervousness was because of the
                           ordeal of ... you know er being before us as a ...
Philip (PS004)             [3636] But it shouldn't be after all that time.
Gethyn (PS009)             [3637] you know?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
John (PS008)               [3638] This was one of the one of the things I asked
                           him wasn't it?
                           [3639] When we were when we were
Gethyn (PS009)             [3640] Yes.
John (PS008)               [3641] talking afterwards about the team ministry
                           and working together and the problems and ... his
                           experiences.
Ida (PS005)                [3642] [laughing] You're not nervous are you Peter
                           [] ?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh] [...]
Gethyn (PS009)             [3643] No but u under the circumstances a man that
                           ... a man who
Ida (PS005)                [3644] [laughing] [...] take the biscuits [] .
Gethyn (PS009)             [3645] yeah, who has ... er had nerv you know
John (PS008)               [3646] Yeah.
Gethyn (PS009)             [3647] a nervous problem
John (PS008)               [3648] Mm.
Gethyn (PS009)             [3649] perhaps it was because of the situation.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3650] Mm.
Gethyn (PS009)             [3651] You know, and perhaps ... if he came, he
                           would overcome it.
John (PS008)               [3652] Yes.
                           [3653] I agree but I think that anybody who speaks
                           in public, you have nervousness beforehand and the
                           moment you go to talk to the people ... you know
                           what you're going to say, you have a few notes in
                           front of you and you talk to the people, if that is
                           your job.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3654] Absolutely.
John (PS008)               [3655] It's what you do.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3656] Yes.
John (PS008)               [3657] No matter how much your knees tremble ...
                           underneath, underneath the table.
                           [3658] But you talk to people with the fervour of
                           what you want to tell them.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3659] That's true.
John (PS008)               [...]
Alan (PS007)               [3660] Er I, I think I would agree with you there
                           that I mean it's natural to be nervous
John (PS008)               [3661] Absolutely, yes.
Alan (PS007)               [3662] in a situation like that
John (PS008)               [3663] Yes.
Alan (PS007)               [3664] but ... usually once one gets sort of started
                           it ... it gets better.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Ida (PS005)                [3665] And [...] he, he possibly had done it at
                           least a half a dozen times [...]
John (PS008)               [3666] Oh must have done.
Ida (PS005)                [...]
John (PS008)               [3667] Yes.
Alan (PS007)               [3668] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3669] Even even if he wasn't accepted on a first
                           occasion he's probably had another two or three
                           attempts elsewhere.
John (PS008)               [3670] Yeah.
Ida (PS005)                [3671] So he's done it before.
John (PS008)               [3672] And and lots of churches that he was telling
                           us that he'd been in contact with.
                           [3673] And he must have gone to those churches for
                           the first time.
                           [3674] ... And I don't suppose that, you know, a new
                           ministry is so very different from meeting people in
                           a new church.
Ida (PS005)                [3675] That's right.
                           [3676] People are the same everywhere.
John (PS008)               [3677] Well yes.
                           [3678] And they are all there willing you to do
                           well.
Ida (PS005)                [3679] Yes, yes.
John (PS008)               [3680] Whatever, you know, audience you're speaking
                           in front of.
                           [3681] I mean of course you're going to be judged
                           ... adversely perhaps, but i in a church you are
                           being ... listened to by people who are of like
                           mind, and therefore willing you to have something of
                           ... value and interest to say to them.
Alan (PS007)               [3682] Er ... yes that, that is important because qu
                           I mean when you feel that people are sympathetic
John (PS008)               [3683] Mm.
Alan (PS007)               [3684] then it's easier to speak.
John (PS008)               [3685] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3686] Oh yes.
John (PS008)               [3687] And we wouldn't have invited him if we
                           weren't sympathetic would we?
Alan (PS007)               [3688] [laughing] Hardly [] .
John (PS008)               [3689] You know. ...
Gethyn (PS009)             [3690] Oh well if he's a nervous person he wouldn't
                           think like that would he?
John (PS008)               [3691] Well exactly.
John (PS008)               [3692] No I feel that this ties in with his nervous
                           breakdown.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3693] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3694] We had a somewhat similar experience at a
                           previous church [...] I was at where we were looking
                           for a minister ... and the, the man er who was, who
                           came to us was again very nervous and excitable and
                           so on.
                           [3695] Fortunately we had a doctor in our
                           congregation who er was s had some knowledge of
                           psychiatry ... and he had a fairly long session with
                           him, just the two of them.
                           [3696] And he strongly recommended us not to accept
                           this man.
                           [3697] And this man went to another church not so
                           very far away so we knew what happened [...] and
                           certainly we were very glad we accepted our doctor's
                           opinion.
John (PS008)               [3698] Mm.
Alan (PS007)               [3699] Mm.
                           [3700] Well it looks as though er ... there's a
                           fairly clear majority against ... er making a call
                           as far as I read it.
                           [3701] ... I don't, do you want a show er do you
                           want to vote? [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3702] Oh, does anybody ... know the [...] of the y
                           the younger people ... the younger members of the
                           churches?
                           [3703] Did he appeal to the younger members?
                           [3704] Or
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3705] No.
                           [3706] Not ... not as far
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3707] oh well
Alan (PS007)               [3708] Er
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3709] if we send a recommendation to [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3710] [...] ... a recommendation to the church you
                           see, so I
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3711] Erm
Margaret (PS002)           [3712] You must know the feeling of this meeting
                           first mustn't you?
Alan (PS007)               [3713] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3714] But one, one would say no, I mean, I don't
                           disagree with what you said about ... er the
                           children's address, well I do ... personally.
Philip (PS004)             [3715] Yes.
Margaret (PS002)           [3716] Erm ... he [...] the same children's address
                           here as he did in Salisbury Park.
Philip (PS004)             [3717] Did he?
                           [3718] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [3719] I would think so, about the elephants?
Ida (PS005)                [3720] That's right.
Philip (PS004)             [3721] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3722] Right.
                           [3723] And in, in [...] er
Philip (PS004)             [3724] Our children weren't
Margaret (PS002)           [3725] the children didn't even know he was talking
                           to them.
Philip (PS004)             [3726] Mm.
                           [3727] He stayed up on the pulpit or whatever didn't
                           he?
Margaret (PS002)           [3728] Erm ... you see if this the pulpit, he didn't
                           come s
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3729] Yeah. [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3730] And what I was gonna say Alan was, perhaps
                           like Mr you know we had one of the ones sitting here
                           that did go up to two services.
                           [3731] I also went to Johnstown yesterday.
                           [3732] So I heard him in Salisbury Park last week
                           and in Johnstown yesterday.
                           [3733] I felt a, a degree of obligation because of
                           my commitment with Johnstown now
Alan (PS007)               [3734] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [3735] so I went to Johnstown yesterday afternoon.
                           [3736] Well I, I've gotta be honest in what I'm
                           saying, I sat through two services yesterday ... the
                           morning service did a lot for me.
                           [3737] ... But the afternoon service did nothing.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3738] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [3739] The morning service in fact I would, I've
                           gotta say it Norah.
Philip (PS004)             [3740] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [3741] The minister we had taking the service
                           yesterday morning I think felt as much on trial in
                           Salisbury Park
Philip (PS004)             [3742] I'm sure he did.
                           [3743] Yes he did.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3744] [...] Yes, yes.
Margaret (PS002)           [3745] because he was a student with us ...
Philip (PS004)             [3746] It was .
                           [3747] Mm.
                           [3748] Yeah.
Alan (PS007)               [3749] Mhm!
Margaret (PS002)           [3750] And had come back yesterday
Philip (PS004)             [3751] He was nervous wasn't he?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3752] He was.
                           [3753] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3754] after his first appointment was as much on
                           trial as Kenneth .
Philip (PS004)             [3755] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3756] And, but yesterday
Philip (PS004)             [3757] Hasn't he improved?
Margaret (PS002)           [3758] relaxed
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3759] Definitely improved.
Margaret (PS002)           [3760] unwound himself and you could tell his two
                           years, what it had done for him.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3761] Hadn't it just?
Margaret (PS002)           [3762] Marvellous.
                           [3763] But
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3764] [...] yes, incredible.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3765] a number of people said to me how much they
                           enjoyed yesterday's service.
Philip (PS004)             [3766] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3767] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3768] He also took a communion service again which
                           was ... [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3769] [...] yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3770] But I came home and feeling I could relate
                           all I'd [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3771] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3772] But I sat in [...] yesterday afternoon ...
                           and I felt sorry for the man's daughter who'd been
                           given a hymn [...] the service.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3773] Who was put on a spot.
                           [3774] Erm and as you said he, he couldn't leave his
                           notes.
                           [3775] Cos I'll have to confess to you, I saw him
                           diligently once looking below the pulpit
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Margaret (PS002)           [3776] at his, at his notes
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3777] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3778] of what he was gonna do next.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3779] Yeah.
Margaret (PS002)           [3780] Erm there was the whole time a sense of
                           anxiety about him.
                           [3781] Alright ... he knew he had to go to [...]
                           afterwards, half past three, but he couldn't unwind
                           one bit there.
                           [3782] And there are occasions, I think we all
                           agree, alright we have to have notes, but you must
                           unwind a little bit to get near to the people.
                           [3783] And I would not feel that Kenneth would ge
                           could get near to any one of us.
Alan (PS007)               [3784] Mm.
Margaret (PS002)           [3785] But I hate to say it because obviously he
                           wants to find, to go somewhere.
                           [3786] But I don't think this is the place [...] .
                           [3787] And heart to heart, having sat through two, I
                           went home [...] it was heavy.
Alan (PS007)               [3788] Mm.
Gethyn (PS009)             [3789] Well a lot of our people said they liked him
                           didn't they?
Ida (PS005)                [3790] Yes, oh yes.
                           [3791] Yes.
                           [3792] ... Yes erm ... you see we're in a different,
                           different situation than what you are at Salisbury
                           Park.
                           [3793] We haven't had to make a demand upon our
                           congregation to make such a decision for twenty two
                           or twenty five years you see?
Alan (PS007)               [3794] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3795] Whereas you've had to do that at Salisbury
                           Park you see?
                           [3796] May I just say I went to erm Johnstown
                           yesterday because ... I had half promised our
                           friends here that I would go to support them.
Alan (PS007)               [3797] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3798] It wasn't actually my Sunday.
                           [3799] I, I'd forego'd that Sunday afternoon for
                           agreeing to come there.
                           [3800] That's why I went.
                           [3801] But I, I also wanted an endorsement
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3802] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3803] of what I heard the previous week.
Alan (PS007)               [3804] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3805] And I think naturally we would all like that.
Alan (PS007)               [3806] Erm
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3807] Well ... going back to the very first meeting
                           that we had
Alan (PS007)               [3808] Mm?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3809] I did come away that er ... really wasn't
                           struck.
                           [3810] But I didn't like at all ... the er ...
                           excuses he made for his wife. [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3811] er that we weren't employing her.
Alan (PS007)               [3812] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3813] Well right-oh ... we er ... I don't think we
                           ever do expect that much.
                           [3814] But all the same, at the same time, we do
                           expect them to mix.
Alan (PS007)               [3815] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3816] If they're going to mix with the church then
                           they'll be only too happy to ... take some part in
                           it.
Alan (PS007)               [3817] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3818] But then in the sermons ... when he came here
                           to preach ... er I didn't see any sign of
                           nervousness myself.
                           [3819] Couldn't see any sign of nervousness myself
                           ... but er I'm very happy with his sermons, quite
                           good.
                           [3820] ... But er at the same time the further I go
                           on, the more apprehensive I get about it.
                           [3821] ... Whether [...] coming here or not and I
                           don't really think that, you know, coming back to it
                           ... I don't think he would fit in.
Alan (PS007)               [3822] Mm.
                           [3823] Er ... well
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3824] We are rather an old congregation, there's no
                           doubt about it, apart from the [...] here.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3825] But er ... you can, I mean we've got, of
                           course I'm not too young myself [] but er we are set
                           in our ways.
Alan (PS007)               [3826] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3827] And that takes up with the [...] .
                           [3828] Can't alter that.
John (PS008)               [3829] What bothered me most was the fact that he
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3830] Mm?
John (PS008)               [3831] What bothered me mo well wha one of the
                           things that bothers me is the fact that he said that
                           he wouldn't like to do hospital chaplaincy because
                           he wouldn't like to go visiting because he's got no
                           small talk.
                           [3832] And I'm just wondering what the ... the knock
                           on effect of that is in the visiting of the, the
                           members who can't get into church and who can't
                           receive communion in church, and who may like to
                           receive it in their home, or in the home, where they
                           live.
                           [3833] Because you don't just suddenly go in ...
                           give communion to someone and walk away again do
                           you?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3834] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3835] You, you ha you establish a rapport of
                           listening for a little while to whatever it is that
                           they've got to say, and their troubles and their
                           anxieties ... and I wasn't happy that
Alan (PS007)               [3836] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3837] there would be that sympathy.
                           [3838] I'm certain that the sympathy is there with
                           his wife.
Philip (PS004)             [3839] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3840] Yes.
John (PS008)               [3841] Absolutely.
                           [3842] But I don't how much that compassion and love
                           for fellow ... people goes beyond his wife to the
                           congregation.
Philip (PS004)             [3843] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3844] I don't know.
                           [3845] I don't know.
Alan (PS007)               [3846] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3847] And if, if he says to us in meeting that he's
                           got no small talk and no ... erm ability for
                           visiting ... in a hospital situation where you can
                           ask people how they are, and then can move to the
                           next person you've got to see ... I'm not sure how
                           he would be visiting someone in their home. ...
Alan (PS007)               [3848] Mm. ...
John (PS008)               [...]
Ida (PS005)                [3849] It's also a question isn't it, of whether you
                           appoint a man because he's a good preacher or
                           secondly because he's a good pastor.
                           [3850] That's really the question isn't it?
Alan (PS007)               [3851] Mm.
Philip (PS004)             [3852] You never get the two? [laugh]
Ida (PS005)                [3853] You can't get the two.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [...]
John (PS008)               [3854] You're very lucky if you do aren't you? [...]

Ida (PS005)                [3855] I would say the second is the more important.
Philip (PS004)             [3856] The more important being a good pastor.
John (PS008)               [3857] Yeah but you must, that, that, that your
                           congregation, that all the people in the pastorate
                           must know that they can go to you and that you will
                           listen.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3858] Yes that's [...]
John (PS008)               [3859] And that you, they, they ... that they will
                           have, for the time that they are in your company,
                           your whole attention.
                           [3860] ... And your whole mind concentrated on what
                           happens to be ... concerning them.
                           [3861] Whatever else you've left behind at home.
Alan (PS007)               [3862] Mm.
John (PS008)               [3863] But for that moment ... you are there for
                           them.
                           [3864] I in their service.
                           [3865] ... You know?
Alan (PS007)               [3866] Mm.
Ida (PS005)                [3867] In other words, the skills of a counsellor?
Philip (PS004)             [3868] Yes.
                           [3869] Yes.
John (PS008)               [3870] Definitely.
                           [3871] Definitely.
Alan (PS007)               [3872] Er well as far as I can see erm ... with,
                           with a few minor reservations, the ... the elders
                           would prefer not to recommend to the church that a
                           call be issued.
                           [3873] Ha have I got it right?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3874] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3875] Yes.
                           [3876] I think you are right.
                           [3877] I think [...]
Gethyn (PS009)             [3878] Well you've got to have a unanimous decision
                           haven't you?
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3879] Mm.
Gethyn (PS009)             [3880] And I mean yo you know, there's three to one
                           isn't it?
Alan (PS007)               [3881] Erm ... oh you mean in favour
Gethyn (PS009)             [3882] In favour, yeah.
Alan (PS007)               [3883] of a call?
Gethyn (PS009)             [3884] Yeah.
Alan (PS007)               [3885] Yes.
                           [3886] Well ... certainly I mean, one would want to
                           have a substantial majority in favour of a call to
                           issue it.
                           [3887] Now whether in fact the church meeting would
                           come to a different conclusion from us I've no means
                           of knowing but ... probably not because most of you
                           know something about the church that you're working
                           with. [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3888] Well [...] impressed with [...]
Gethyn (PS009)             [3889] That's what I'm saying.

Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3891] They all liked him [...]
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3892] [...] our congregation yesterday and erm ...
                           the feeling I got was that erm ... we couldn't
                           support a minister ourselves, and we're ... and,
                           well at least the congregation think that they're
                           there entirely to help Salisbury Park.
                           [3893] Erm and I think I go with them o on these
                           lines.
                           [3894] And we're hoping to get something out of that
                           sale
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3895] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3896] and what we're trying to do is plough
                           whatever we get back into the group
Alan (PS007)               [3897] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3898] so that erm ... more or less Salisbury Park
                           are the people who really ... Th they said that
                           whatever the decision, decision they make, they
                           would fall in with them.
Alan (PS007)               [3899] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KB0PSUNK) [3900] So er it looks as if the decision's against,
                           so ... I'm almost sure that the decision at
                           Johnstown will be against.
Alan (PS007)               [3901] Well
