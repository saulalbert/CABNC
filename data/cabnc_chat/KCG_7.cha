*MAD:	Well it is, I think she's just, she wanted to, to do a bigger third bedroom
*MAR:	Mm
*MAD:	and she's had this bloke round and I think he's 
*MAR:	and they've taught her 
*MAD:	he's recommended to her that instead of making the third bedroom bigger, to make four bedrooms because it would increase the value of the house more.
*CHR:	The house 
*MAR:	I mean anybody else would of made do with a little bedroom, I mean it's big enough to get a bed and a dressing table and what in, and it's bigger, it's a lot bigger than mine 
*MAD:	What I suppose she thinks is if she can afford to do it, do it.
*CHR:	Who's this?

*MAD:	she's had all her plans done for her 
*CHR:	Has she?

*MAR:	Come on pop what you doing, where's your  (        ) ?
*CHR:	This is for the son's bedroom?
*MAD:	Well it, when he, she originally wanted him to do plans to make the third bedroom bigger which would of been like an L shaped bedroom
*CHR:	Mm.
*MAD:	but he recommended to her to actually make it into a fourth bedroom because it would increase the value of the house 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*MAD:	and also
*CHR:	So where they gonna put the, the other bedroom?
*MAR:	At the side.
*MAD:	At the side, so, but she's not having a garage or anything at the side, she's having a side extension down below, but the front bit she's having made into a shower room and then the back bit it's gonna be like a morning room to the kitchen
*CHR:	Oh right.
*MAD:	like where you go in the kitchen you turn right, like that one of mine over there, the sink's there on the right hand side
*CHR:	Yeah.
*MAD:	well she's gonna have that knocked into an archway through to a dining room
*CHR:	Oh right, lovely.

*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAD:	with her being in a corner Jane

*MAD:	she's not, I mean the next door round the corner, like she's on the corner and the house here, it's been extended on the side, but it won't bring it anywhere near Pam's extension
*JAN:	No.
*MAD:	because it's in the corner 
*JAN:	Corner.
*MAD:	you know?
*MAR:	She could do it on the back an'all, she's got a third of an acre of garden, it's bloody massive.
*JAN:	I think that's it, if you can get a house with plenty of, you know you can stay there and live for ever can't ya?
*MAR:	Yeah you can, mm, you can do that can't ya?I just don't, hope they don't bring the rates back

*MAD:	Well it'll all be
*CHR:	I'm not doing any, I'm, I'm, all this bloody panicking about getting a flaming gas fire sorted out and getting a carpet done, I'm not, not bothering, we'll just have to rough it for a while.
*JAN:	Let 'em rough it for a week.
*CHR:	Mm, we'll rough it for a while, because I know the downers, the only thing that Mike wants to do is put the fence and the gate up the side
*JAN:	Mm.
*CHR:	which Don said we could do
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	to sort the dog out really
*JAN:	Mm.
*CHR:	but everything else we can sort, getting there, it's not as if we're gonna need a bloody fire is it Jane?
*JAN:	Not really.
*CHR:	I mean do you find you, you use your fire more?
*JAN:	We have been doing over the past few nights
*CHR:	Have ya?
*JAN:	because I've been turning the heating, it's the 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAN:	I don't know, from tea time it seems to warm up the house 
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAN:	and it's boiling hot 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAN:	from sort of eight o'clock so I could 
*CHR:	Then it cools off 
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	don't it?
*JAN:	So I just put it on just to tick 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAN:	the room over really   (.) but I mean if you can keep your heating on for that little bit of length of time 
*CHR:	Mm, that's what I'll do I don't think we'll use the fire that much, I mean we, I, did I put it on?No I didn't put it on last night, but I did leave me heating on, it clicks off at nine o'clock, but the house was warm
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	and we went to bed anyway
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	just gone ten.
*JAN:	That's what, I mean we used to turn ours off of about nine, half nine and like you say it just used to tick 
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAN:	over till about eleven, you could just feel it cooling down
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAN:	but, because I've been knocking it off that bit earlier
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAN:	sort of five minutes 
*CHR:	And how have you fi I think we're gonna end up like with a fire like yours to be honest, because we don't want to alter that fireplace if we can help it 
*JAN:	No, it's ever so nice.
*CHR:	because we do like it
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	and we thought well one night, I mean it's a bloody big radiator in that room
*JAN:	Mm.
*CHR:	which I think would be enough 
*JAN:	You wouldn't you'd probably find that you would use it half a dozen times through the year.
*CHR:	Yeah, yeah.
*JAN:	No I won't get rid of mine.
*CHR:	Have you sort of not, I suppose you haven't found out money- wise what it's costing ya?
*JAN:	No, not really I should imagine it's not, I don't know you see, we don't, we'd of had the heating on anyway
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAN:	so I don't suppose it's cost us any more
*CHR:	No.
*JAN:	because we've hardly had it on.
*CHR:	Mm.
*MAD:	Still you 
*CHR:	You do find it warm don't ya?
*JAN:	I do, yeah,
*CHR:	Have you got a couple of settings on yours is it a high and a low?
*JAN:	Well I've just got high and low that's all.
*CHR:	But I mean it'll give you er a wattage er, whatever it is
*JAN:	Yeah 
*CHR:	it pumps out anyway?
*JAN:	well I suppose so, I don't know what we've got.
*MAD:	The
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	yeah, because as I say something like what Jane's got would fit in that fireplace, just right
*JAN:	Mm.
*MAD:	Mm.
*CHR:	which like I say saw one up at erm   (.) I told you that fireplace shop on the corner, mind you I think we'll get Edwards in, he had some in about a hundred and sixty quid or so
*JAN:	You should start looking round.
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	erm I mean really ideally Mike would like one of those that actually fits perfectly 
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	in, in the fireplace
*JAN:	I know what you mean.
*CHR:	and it's got a back to it
*JAN:	Mm.
*CHR:	and it sort of throws the heat out into the room.
*JAN:	Yeah, yeah.
*CHR:	Well I could, it could, it wouldn't justify it.
*JAN:	But Chris I can't see them I can't see them making a fire like that that your heat's gonna go all up the chimney, no way.
*CHR:	No, but what I'm saying is 
*JAN:	Josh come on 
*CHR:	if there wasn't
*JAN:	come on Josh, Josh 
*CHR:	if there wasn't a good amount of radiator in that room
*JAN:	Josh
*CHR:	it would justify having a fire like that 
*MAD:	Come on 
*JAN:	Yeah, yeah.
*CHR:	but because it's got such a good
*MAD:	Yeah.
*JAN:	Radiator.
*CHR:	you know cos I told you Mike actually fancies one of these that actually fits right in the fireplace 
*JAN:	I know what you mean next door 
*CHR:	and there's a backing to it and it pumps it out into the room, they're dead hot
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	but I don't think this room needs it Jane.
*MAD:	No.
*JAN:	Mm.
*CHR:	I think it'll be a waste, and I don't want to go to the expense of
*JAN:	Well they are bloody expensive.
*CHR:	because 
*MAD:	It slipped  ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	I think the fires are about three hundred quid
*JAN:	Mm.
*CHR:	but it's not that, you'd have to have a lot of the fireplace ripped up.
*JAN:	Mm you would 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAN:	it's only a little square.
*CHR:	Yeah, we'd have to have the pillars taken off
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	and everything like that, so all that would have to be redecorated.
*JAN:	Whereas like that one of ours, it'd be ideal wouldn't it?
*CHR:	It be it just work right
*JAN:	Must have your chimney swept.
*CHR:	That's what I want to get that number off you for that as well because I some   (        ) would suggest anyway 
*JAN:	I got it somewhere yeah.
*CHR:	wouldn't he?
*JAN:	I got it somewhere, I'll root it out for ya and I forgot to see Hilda about that
*MAD:	Michael shout Mike 
*CHR:	There's no rush for it.
*MAD:	Michael shout louder 
*JAN:	she's gone on holiday now.
*CHR:	you know, some time
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	if you think about it.
*MAD:	Mike
*JAN:	Funny enough I saw her yesterday
*MAD:	in a minute or two
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	and she started talking about putting the freezer in the back garden 
*BIL:	Is it worth my taking a coat on?
*JAN:	and that
*CHR:	Oh.
*JAN:	and it just slipped my mind.
*CHR:	Well just any time, we won't be doing nothing until the end of May anyway.
*MAD:	Michael, Michael shout Mike

*MAD:	Mike, shout Mike, Mike 
*CHR:	But what would you, see Edward said

*CHR:	when we decided we want something he'll come down and 
*JAN:	Be careful 
*CHR:	sort it all out.
*JAN:	sort it out 
*MAD:	shout Chris
*CHR:	Hopefully we can get away with that room Jane with just maybe having to emulsion it
*JAN:	Yeah.
*CHR:	because I mean once you've taken all the pictures down, I think it did need it
*JAN:	She's a smoker int she?That's 
*CHR:	very much.
*JAN:	Yeah that'll be your main thing then.
*CHR:	Rather than decorate I think we'll just 
*JAN:	Paint it.
*CHR:	er emulsion over it and maybe put a border around the picture frames.
*JAN:	This is in the back room?
*CHR:	Front room.
*JAN:	Mm.
*CHR:	Yeah, leave the front room, we'll have to, first week or so we'll have to live in that back room
