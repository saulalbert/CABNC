*PS04U:	You 're sixty five in that year .  249293_250733
*PS04V:	And if I if I stayed with Tescos and got me pension and that But I do n't think it 's with the A V C's it 's just the pension I could if I retire at sixty five I can have twenty this is the best bit twenty one thousand pound in a lump sum And then I could have a pension which would be seven thousand six hundred and seventy three pounds a year which is about a hundred and twenty pounds .  250773_283133
*PS04U:	A month .  283303_283733
*PS04V:	a week No a week Plus you would have that month 's salary .  286523_294043
*PS04U:	What would you go you would n't have a lump sum .  294053_295753
*PS04V:	Oh yeah yeah .  295753_296653
*PS04U:	You 'd have the lump sum as well .  296653_298073
*PS04V:	Oh I 'd have the lump no you can it would be more than that My pension if I did n't have it if I say I do n't want the lump sum the twenty one grand .  298313_311933
*PS04U:	Yeah .  311933_312123
*PS04V:	It would probably be fourteen thousand pound a year you 'd work it on two hundred and fifty pound a week But if you 're sixty five you have n't got much longer to go have you You know what .  312163_324813
*PS04U:	If you took the lump sum and .  324813_325563
*PS04V:	Yeah If you get your lump sum out if you want a new car you get a new car Because you get your state pension as well Which is for a couple would be eighty three pounds So you 'd be on you 'd have twenty one grand which you could put away .  325843_339903
*PS04U:	Live on the interest .  340003_341313
*PS04V:	No you could n't live on the interest But see the way I the way I assume see this the endowment on the house is paid .  341483_351233
*PS04U:	0 . 
*PS04V:	So that goes fifteen thousand So you 'd have like twenty well so they about twenty grand so you get twenty grand there By that time we should have about I would say at least another ten thousand pounds in that account of yours So you 'd have thirty grand there which .  351233_369893
*PS04U:	And those family assurance things .  369973_371853
*PS04V:	Yeah Plus the shares which will be on my side Plus this pension so you 'd be you 'd have your house paid for so you 'd get a nice .  371853_380643
*PS04U:	A nice nest egg .  380933_381333
*PS04V:	a nice lump you can draw for a holiday and plus have a good living between That 's why that at the moment I do n't see it well I do n't see it a necessity you to get a pension .  381333_397363
*PS04U:	Mm .  397363_397483
*PS04V:	But I think .  397483_400223
*PS04U:	You got that family assurance thing have n't you And I 've got my tessa .  400223_402423
*PS04V:	That 's what I mean yeah That 's why I say to you you say oh we 've got this we 've got that we want that we want this but er I tell you two thousand nineteen and you 're at nineteen ninety two That ai n't far away though And plus the fact there 's I do n't wan na work till I 'm sixty five I wan na pack up about .  402423_424373
*PS04U:	What about that pension if you want to pack up before .  424373_426963
*PS04V:	No it 's it is quite reducing That 's why you 've got ta be er put all your things together now See even that there If for some reason you go back there and you 're not happy with the suit .  427883_456523

*PS04U:	What did you think it would be too small .  510343_511523
