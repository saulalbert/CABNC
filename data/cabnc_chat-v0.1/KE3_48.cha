*JAC:	Oh aren't they lovely? •195194_195473•
*TON:	What the  jugs? •195485_195638•
*JAC:	The jugs yeah. •195638_195772•
*TON:	Didn't see them properly. •195869_195974•
*JAC:	They were like bunches of oranges and lemons •196032_196456•
*TON:	Oh. •196456_196459•
*JAC:	if you know what I mean •196459_196526•
*TON:	Yeah I know. •196538_196588•
*CHR:	. •_•
*TON:	In ceramic? •196686_196767•
*JAC:	Yeah  •197010_197023•
*TON:	A what? •197211_197241•
*CHR:	A Pocket T V. •197543_197804•
*TON:	Pocket T V. •197913_198045•
*CHR:	. •_•
        A radio, the  the cuddly toy er •198081_198293•
*TON:	Good grief she's got a good memory. •198293_198494•
*CHR:	The coffee maker, the  the  er   •198494_200143•
*JAC:	God, she, she was brilliant. •202523_202609•
*TON:	She got an awful lot of things didn't she? •202609_203287•
        There's a really good game we did at, at Rammore for remembering people's names. •203299_203880•
*JAC:	Yeah. •203931_203941•
*TON:	And they, it was a bit frightening because we were in a group of seventeen and see what I mean when, I mean how it starts is like if were starting with me, I have to say I'm Tony, right, and then you would say I'm Jackie and this is Tony and then Christine would say I'm Christine this is Jackie, this is Tony, I was at the end of a group of seventeen  and I had heard it sort of, you hear it, it builds up round the room •204168_207967•
*JAC:	Yeah. •207967_207974•
*CHR:	We've had a game like that . •208022_208092•
*TON:	So that you can in the end, when I came to do it, although it was seventeen people I didn't find it too difficult. •208107_208791•
*JAC:	No, cos you just remember the order that you went round the room in and . •208825_209178•
*TON:	That's right, well no, these were people and, some of the people I knew, some of the people I hadn't met before. •209255_209903•
*JAC:	Ah. •210044_210055•
*CHR:	Daddy. •210066_210088•
*TON:	And so I had to sort of go round the room and say I'm Tony and this is, and go all round, and I got round the room. •210180_211044•
*JAC:	. •_•
*TON:	Yeah. •211219_211256•
*JAC:	So you did quite well. •211279_211449•
*TON:	But I was surprised that I got round the room, cos I'm awful at remembering names  I think I'm gonna have to try and •211515_213008•
*CHR:	Dad do we have to  we have to come up with a name. •213008_213675•
*TON:	Mm. •213745_213803•
*CHR:	With a first name, so I said her and Chris •213812_214344•
*TON:	Oh yeah  •214386_214483•
*CHR:	The man said . •214601_215175•
*TON:	Mm. •215576_215603•
*CHR:	 (        )  (.) 
*TON:	Erm, but, we had a, that was, that was quite good, but I must, there's a trick to remembering names, and that is that you use it all the time, so any time, if you want to remember somebodys name, every time you see them you say hello and there name •215778_217853•
*JAC:	Yeah. •217887_217902•
*TON:	and that sort of imprints it on you. •217925_218090•
*JAC:	Yes. •218182_218207•
*TON:	Cos I've noticed there is an awful lot of people do that to me. •218523_218854•
*JAC:	Yeah. •218909_218921•
        I'm terrible for people's names •219085_219246•
*TON:	Mm. •219259_219278•
*JAC:	I'm absolutely hopeless. •219278_219630•
        Places, I can tell you I know somewhere looking at them and I think where do I know you from •219634_220087•
*TON:	Yeah. •220118_220148•
*JAC:	Names ooh. •220229_220328•
*TON:	Yeah. •220450_220471•
        And that, that can be difficult in training because you see so many people and they spend the week looking at you and they've got one name to remember, but you've got eight or twelve names to remember •220739_222223•
*JAC:	Yeah. •222226_222233•
*TON:	and you see them a three weeks later and they say hello Tony and you think hello, who the hell are you?. •222316_222889•
*JAC:	My watch is breaking up. •223351_223645•
*TON:	Breaking up. •223791_223868•
*JAC:	Yeah. •223941_223956•
*TON:	What the strap? •224034_224107•
*JAC:	No, the case. •224145_224183•
*TON:	, oh, the case. •224394_224417•
*JAC:	, fit this in already,so, you know the other side. •224778_226855•
*CHR:	. •_•
*JAC:	Where the strap goes into the case. •226902_227414•
        The other side, the   •227414_227479•
*TON:	Oh oh I see. •227532_227580•
*JAC:	See the bit lifting? •227580_227763•
*TON:	Yeah, I can. •227797_227869•
        Missing a little bit missing bit further along as well. •228054_228261•
*CHR:	Daddy I thought . •228485_228556•
        What you doing . •228559_228649•
*TON:	Erm, I think if they killed a shark  •229234_229454•
*JAC:	Well they yeah, they, they killed Jaws about  . •229483_229694•
*TON:	Yeah, but there's an awful lot of sharks about. •229863_230247•

*TON:	Cos this is the fourth film. •231773_231914•
*JAC:	Yeah, I know, it was killed in the one where it got trapped in the . •231997_232303•
*TON:	That's right. •232468_232519•
*JAC:	And it was killed in the first one, that was two . •232573_232790•
*TON:	Yeah . •232825_232843•
*CHR:	But, there's thousands and thousands of great . •232843_233036•
*JAC:	Oh, I don't know how people can eat fish like that. •233057_233881•
*TON:	No, I can't, it'll, if you don't take the head of it I can't eat it, I couldn't even, I have prawn cocktail  and you have a prawn, they put, they put a prawn on top whole, I couldn't eat that, I could have peeled it, I looked at it and I thought about it, no, I can eat them when there done •233881_236068•
*JAC:	Yeah but not. •236119_236195•
*TON:	but not when there not done  •236210_236328•
*CHR:	Oh remember when I was squeezing that . •236423_236590•
