@Comment:	conversation #81 (Tape 015801)
*BRE:	You know what Lee's like.
*DAV:	And if for some reason it doesn't fit and you go back to them
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*BRE:	Picked a few parcels and wrappers   (.) to Marks and Sparks  (        ) .Couldn't you?
*LEE:	Yeah.
*DAV:	If you do   (.) go back there again   (.) you must   (.) to match the tie   (.) must have a white shirt.
*LEE:	But I haven't   (        ) white shirts.
*DAV:	You must, don't buy a stripy one cos a stripy one won't go with the shirt, the tie.
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*LEE:	 (        ) nothing else.
*DAV:	No I'm saying   (.) if the shirt doesn't fit you can  (        ) .
*BRE:	What size is the shirt?
*DAV:	It's a small.But he said they are very
*BRE:	What collar?
*DAV:	Well  (        ) .With a shirt like that you gotta have it, he he said it's
*BRE:	Open.
*DAV:	it's gotta be a
*LEE:	 (        ) a tie with that.
*DAV:	Well you see it's gotta be a reasonable fit.You can't have a   (.) great big baggy shirt underneath a slim suit type of thing.
*BRE:	Was he helpful?
*DAV:	He seemed alright didn't he?
*BRE:	Yeah.
*DAV:	The only thing I   (        ) was him with his poxy trainers on and no shoes. (.) When he turns up next week his trousers'll be about three inches above his shoes.
*BRE:	Might get your shoes on Wednesday. (.) 
*DAV:	But make sure he's got his trousers on!
*BRE:	Why does he have to have his trousers on?
*DAV:	Well he has to put the suit on, try it on in the shop, to make sure it, wear his shoes there   (.) cos even, the shoes he's got might be alright with it.
*BRE:	But they they've got holes in.He needs new school shoes.
*DAV:	Yes but if they   (.) are alright you know the type of shoes you want. (.) 
*BRE:	All he's gonna wear are shoes that day.
*DAV:	Er?
*BRE:	Are they, are they quite similar to his   (.) school trousers?
*LEE:	Oh yeah.
*BRE:	The cut?
*LEE:	Yeah.
*BRE:	Cos they look, be okay with those shoes.
*DAV:	Yeah but the length.It's the length you, the trousers'll be alright.
*BRE:	Have you gone for the longer length?Like with your school trousers or short short?
*DAV:	You couldn't te , they were long
*LEE:	Short.
*BRE:	Eh?
*BRE:	you can't tell because he had trainers on.
*LEE:	Short. ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	We may, he measured, we   (        ) the leg he had trainers on.And matey done them a little bit longer.He added a bit.He done down to the top of the trainer
*BRE:	Have they got turn-ups on?
*LEE:	Yeah.
*DAV:	and then down a bit more.
*BRE:	 (        ) they'll cut them. (.) 
*DAV:	Well I should imagine they'll cut them yeah.
*BRE:	They, they will they won't   (.) they won't just turn them up they'll actually cut them.
*LEE:	 ((cough)) 
*DAV:	So   (        ) he picked it up and he   (        ) shoes.I'll give you the receipt actually so you've got it in case.
*BRE:	Go and get your Benolin. (.) Or the other one.How many   (        ) has the other one got?
*LEE:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	Four at a time?
*LEE:	No.
*BRE:	So how many ti times do you take it?One spoonful or one  (        ) ?
*LEE:	 (        ) two teaspoons. (.)  (        )  (.) 
*DAV:	My pension. (.) 
*LEE:	Getting old mate.
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) .Here you are.If I was to pop my clogs at work or any time   (.) you'd get fifty five thousand eight hundred eighty pounds.
*BRE:	Quick, knock him off then. ((laugh)) . We'll knock him off quick.
*DAV:	Plus   (.) you get your three and a half grand back.Plus you would get five thousand six hundred and six pounds   (.) a year pension. (.) Plus the insurance on the house would pay up so you'd have, ha bloody hell, so you'd have about sixty grand in the bank. ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	Must be worth twenty five grand then.
*DAV:	No mortgage.
*LEE:	 ((cough)) 
*DAV:	Think how many shirts with that you could buy then. (.) And at the moment   (.) you know when I'm gonna retire Bren?
*BRE:	When? (.) When is it?
*DAV:	This ain't far away.
*BRE:	With that fifty five, yeah?Fifty five grand.What if you don't   (.) if you don't die before?
*DAV:	You don't get it, do you.
*BRE:	You don't get it? (.) 
*DAV:	I retire   (.) I'm sixty five right   (        ) this is not far away
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	when you say it like this.On the fourth of July two thousand and nineteen.
*BRE:	Is that  (        ) ?
*DAV:	That ain't far away is it? (.) 
*BRE:	What's that?At sixty five?
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	You're sixty five in that year. (.) 
*DAV:	And if I, if I stayed with Tescos and got me pension and that.But I don't think it's with the A V C's it's just the pension. (.) I could, if I retire at sixty five I can have twenty   (        ) this is the best bit, twenty one thousand   (.) pound in a lump sum. (.) And then I could have a pension which would be seven thousand six hundred and seventy three pounds a year which is   (.) about a hundred and   (.) twenty pounds
*BRE:	A month.
*DAV:	a week.No a week.Plus you would have that month's salary.
*BRE:	What would you go   (.) you wouldn't have a lump sum?
*DAV:	Oh yeah, yeah.
*BRE:	You'd have the lump sum as well?
*DAV:	Oh I'd have the lump, no   (.) you can   (.) it would be more than that.My pension, if I didn't have it   (.) if I say I don't want the lump sum, the twenty one grand.
*BRE:	Yeah.
*DAV:	It would probably be fourteen thousand pound a year you'd work it on   (.) two hundred and fifty pound a week.But   (        ) if you're sixty five you haven't got much longer to go have you? (.) You know what   (        ) 
*BRE:	If you took the lump sum and 
*DAV:	Yeah.If you get your lump sum out   (.) if you want a new car you get a new car.Because you get your state pension as well.Which is for a couple would be eighty three pounds.So you'd be on   (.) you'd have twenty one grand which you could put away.
*BRE:	Live on the interest.
*DAV:	No you couldn't live on the interest.But see the way I, the way I assume, see this   (.) the endowment on the house is paid    (.)  (        ) 
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	So that goes   (        ) fifteen thousand.So you'd have like twenty, well so they   (        ) about twenty grand so you get twenty grand there. (.) By that time we should have about   (.) I would say at least another ten thousand pounds in that account of yours.So you'd have thirty grand there which   (        ) 
*BRE:	And those family assurance things.
*DAV:	Yeah.Plus the shares   (.) which will be on my side.Plus this pension so you'd be, you'd have your house paid for so you'd get a nice
*BRE:	A nice nest egg.
*DAV:	a nice lump you can   (.) draw for a holiday and plus have a good living between. (.) That's why that, at the moment I don't see it   (.) well I don't see it   (.) a necessity   (.) you to get a pension.
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	But I think
*BRE:	You got that family assurance thing haven't you?And I've got my TESSA.
*DAV:	That's what I mean, yeah.That's why I say to you, you say oh we've got this we've got that we want that we want this but    (.)  ((clears throat)) er   (.) I tell you two thousand nineteen and you're at nineteen ninety two.That ain't far away though. (.) And plus the fact there's, I don't wanna work till I'm sixty five   (        ) I wanna pack up about  (        ) 
*BRE:	What about that pension if you want to pack up before?
*DAV:	No it's, it is quite   (        ) reducing.That's why you've gotta be er   (.) put all your things together now. (.)  (        )  (.) See even that there   (.) If for some reason you go back there and you're not happy with the suit
*LEE:	 ((cough)) 
*DAV:	right?
*BRE:	I shall cha , you know me.
*DAV:	 (        ) .No let him try it on.Don't take the suit away.Alright?Listening?
*BRE:	Right.Well what if he says well, it's alright you take it away and then bring it back?
*DAV:	No.Well it's no good to you.Alright?Don't take the suit away, the only thing I'm a bit dubious   (        ) well he said well take the suit home and try it   (.) if it's not he said come back with it, he said and   (.) we'll exchange it down here.He said there's no problem with the exchange.I came out that shop and I thought   (.) and why the fucking hell didn't he let us try it on there and then?And if it ain't the right size he can take the one that is.So I thought perhaps matey only had a small and large. (.) Not a medium so he's given him the small so he's thinking if   (.) if it doesn't fit   (.) he's still made the sale.If you see what I mean.So you have to go back and have another shirt.I mean he had about four or five different shirts there.But it has to be white.
*BRE:	What, did you think it would be too small?
*DAV:	Well no cos matey, I don't think so cos matey said he is a small.Cos I said to him I said well look, he likes his shirts baggy   (.) he said yeah but you can't have a shirt too baggy with a suit.So 
*BRE:	But that shirt's okay cos it, I mean he can wear that to school can't he?The rest of
*DAV:	Oh yeah.But he's gotta try it on and make sure it's not, if it's all tight he ain't gonna be happy in it is he? (.) That's if 
*BRE:	 (        ) he said today he said I don't know when I'm gonna wear the suit.
*DAV:	Well you said he could wear it   (.) well like you said most people   (.) mm   (.) I'll wear it.Have a night out at the  (        ) .
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Have a night out at  (        ) .
*BRE:	What?
*DAV:	Put the old suit on. (.) Here comes   (        ) love her.
*BRE:	 (        ) to wear.
*DAV:	Oh fucking hell! (.)  (        )  (.) oh  (.) 
*BRE:	Better get something in that's stronger than that Dave. (.) 
*DAV:	So what time are you er   (.) picking   (        ) up at one.Where's  (        ) .What time are you going?
*BRE:	Two o'clock kick off.Forty five minutes   (        ) quarter to four. (.) Round about no good   (        ) 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	about   (.) quarter past four.
*DAV:	And what time have we got   (        ) coming over?
*BRE:	Six. (.) 
*DAV:	I'll tell you there's no way when my kids get older, I don't care how boring my life is, I will never ever go round their house every week. (.) 
*BRE:	I reckon she had a few last  (        ) .
*DAV:	I think once a month is nice.You've got something to talk about. (        ) you've got something to chat about.
*BRE:	 (        ) sit here don't we and   (.) nothing to say to each other.
*DAV:	We talk about
*BRE:	 (        ) last night? (.)  (        )  (.) I did   (        ) as well though.
*DAV:	What time did they leave?
*BRE:	I should think erm long after.
*DAV:	 (        ) ?Oh. (        ) seems a bit expensive.
*BRE:	Oh no.Not really Dave.
*DAV:	Yeah I know but I was thinking   (.) it's alright but where you gonna put it?
*BRE:	 (        ) .At the end of her bed.It's not, it's not like they said.
*DAV:	Innit?
*BRE:	Cos the stand's only that size.She could have it out and she'd have a lot of fun with it and   (        ) on it.I mean Argos does, do one.Three hundred and sixty nine with the drum   (        ) and everything.And if the bloke can tape from it.I mean you can't, it's not, I mean you couldn't have it in like 
*DAV:	What she want it for then?
*BRE:	Er?
*DAV:	What she want it for?
*BRE:	Who?
*DAV:	Carla.
*BRE:	Well she can either sing in it   (.) play the organ, sing in it and tape it as well.You can have a lot of fun with them.Can't erm like   (.) the one she's got upstairs is like   (.) all she was quite happy with is a seventy pound one.Like that but a bigger version with full keys.
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	But this one this bloke's got is a full key like a piano.
*DAV:	Oh is it?
*BRE:	And you've got all the tunes.You've got all the   (        ) you've got I think a hundred voices.You've got jazz, ballet, all different things on it.
*DAV:	Oh.
*BRE:	I mean it's   (.) it's good to play  (        ) .Well I think that's quite   (.) I mean I'd probably knock him down to a hundred anyway. (.) I said to him if if, last night I said I probably  (        ) .I said I want to try it out first.Leave it at your house and I'll try it out   (.) and erm   (.) but Nick wouldn't sell it to you if he thought it was  (.) 
*DAV:	Oh no.
*BRE:	not worth it. (.) But he, I mean that one from Argos   (        ) seventy quid.And it's not the full size keys or anything.
*DAV:	What's he flogging it for? (        ) 
*BRE:	Been made redundant.It's 
*DAV:	Where did he work?
*BRE:	it's er   (.) she did say.It's Pete's erm, Pete!Nick's sister's boyfriend. (.) Dunno who it is
*DAV:	Oh well we've got the cash.The money's, like I said to you   (        ) 
*BRE:	Oh yeah but the thing is it's something, it's the main, it's something she, it's like   (        ) said to her last night 
*DAV:	Well if she wants that you let her have it.
*BRE:	what do you want?She said I want an organ but mum would never let me have one.And it's worth
*DAV:	The only thing I don't like about it is the noise.
*BRE:	Ah yeah but it's not noisy noisy are they?
*DAV:	Aren't they?
*BRE:	And the fact, what I like about it, it can be battery or mains.
*DAV:	Oh  (        ) 
*BRE:	Plug it in.And I mean   (.) she's, you've got room out there to have it if it just stands. (.) And then that
*DAV:	I was gonna say, tell you something.You  (        ) .That's  (        ) .Someone had an intruder.I'm not sure   (.) but I think it was Mrs Turner.
*BRE:	Well funny enough she's, she's got a light to put on now.
*DAV:	Yeah.I see the bloke putting them up.Because it was an old age woman, they ain't give anyone's names   (.) old age woman was   (.) er   (.) it was in the paper sort of   (.) met up with an intruder in her house like. (.) and I dunno went screaming, went crackers. (.) But then he said a neighbour   (.) who had a dress  (        ) , just wearing a dressing gown   (.) and he was married with three kids which is next door   (.) heard what going, been going on and he   (.) they were chasing, were chasing all through the common.Virtually all the way out to    (.)  (        ) park but they didn't give his name either.
*BRE:	Must be her.
*DAV:	That's what I thought when I see her put her lights up.
*BRE:	I didn't see, I just saw them lit up last, all last night lit up.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah I just assumed I thought oh hallo.I was reading it in the paper I thought oh I wonder if is.
*BRE:	And she had that paint didn't she?That iffy painter?
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	Trouble is they know she lives there on her own.
*DAV:	Mm. (.) That's what I mean.We don't wanna put a lot of valuable stuff out here.Cos at any time I mean, if we're here I mean    (        )  (.) there's always someone in cos I'm working nights so I'm here in the days. (.) So easy to break that 
*BRE:	 (        ) I'm glad I've got, broke the back of it.All I've got now is I haven't gotta go out for a main, if I'm out   (.) just pick up a couple of bits for him when   (        ) from Woking.But I can go to Woking and get whatever
*DAV:	Yeah.
*BRE:	And that's like Carla.I might, what you got from Argos the other day, I might keep one of the things back for her birthday. (.) 
*DAV:	Trouble is if they get so much   (        ) they don't use it.I mean it's different if it's clothes they need, good.
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	But if it's toys.They get all the toys and they   (        ) 
*BRE:	She needs   (        ) .She's got nothing up there what we brought.Alright that   (        ) but nothing   (        ) one game   (.) she can actually play with.It's like Lee I mean he'll have all his stuff and that, he's got nothing to do.
*DAV:	 (        ) hasn't he?
*BRE:	But she does still.
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	God   (        ) that'd be a nightmare.She's got fifty presents to buy.
*DAV:	Where she going for Christmas then?
*BRE:	Well if Vicky's in hospital she said they're going for the day there.
*DAV:	Are they?But if, how does  (        ) ?
*BRE:	 (        ) she's not well enough  (        ) .But   (        ) I mean I think Gill sort of worries the fact I think she's, I mean nobody said she'd be in there till Christmas.The doctor just said
*DAV:	No well if she's eating   (        ) they aren't going to let her out.
*BRE:	Well she's down to six stone eleven. (.) She was nine four   (.) before this started. (.) No she's lost four stone, she was ten stone four. (.) And then she's been average on the last three or four months she's been on eight stone.But now it's gone down, but there's no ulcer she had a laparotomy on Friday    (.)  (        ) the tube.And there's nothing wrong with her   (.) it was just sort of it's just nerves isn't it?Strain and nerves.
*DAV:	 (        ) I keep thinking, I mean I can   (        ) when I first met her  (        ) .She   (.) I mean she's got all the facilities about her but she don't seem
*BRE:	She's ever so, I mean she's very quiet and sort of sweet but she's got no
*DAV:	Got no idea.
*BRE:	I mean I said to her today   (.) I mean there was this costume there and I said here get that one there I said   (.) french maid outfit, nurse's outfit.I said get   (        ) that then.And she went no I wouldn't wear that!I said oh Dave would like that.There was no   (.) you know no, no sort of sense of humour there   (.) at all.But erm   (.) you know I've, I've   (.) but she said he's been right sort of  (        ) 
*DAV:	Well you would be wouldn't you?Tying all that money up in the house.Now if he's gotta make out himself there'll be a possibility he might be losing it.
*BRE:	But you don't know how bad he is.I mean he wouldn't sack his ex wife.She still works with him in the shop.And Gill gave her job to go and work in the shop   (.) and he wouldn't let her go and work in it.I said I thought it was you?She said no he kept saying oh   (.) we'll start you in a month, start you in a month   (        ) if I get rid of her.And he wouldn't get rid of her.And that's where a lot of it   (.) and she still think's that he's
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	Yeah.I mean he was married for quite a long time to her apparently.And she only lives two doors from the shop.Goes round there for his lunch.
*DAV:	 [laughing] Does he? [] 
*BRE:	Yeah! (.) I mean   (.) you know he's made the break.And she said he's just so   (.) you know  (.) 
*DAV:	 (        ) it was one beer and that was it.I couldn't believe  (        ) 
*BRE:	Yeah.
*DAV:	 (        ) how come you're back in?
*BRE:	It's just    (.)  (        ) different people aren't they?Just sort of a bit 
*DAV:	Oh well so all we've really gotta do now then is just get out and do a shop   (.) for Christmas. (        ) . We ain't gonna be doing a lot anyway are we?
*BRE:	I've got all that.
*DAV:	Yeah all we want is a turkey.
*BRE:	Bit of turkey and some   (.) drink.Get a few nibbles sort of like couple of days before like er cos if Kim comes I'll do like I did last year, just a little buffet tea.But I'm not buying   (.) biscuits and sweets and 
*DAV:	Gateaux.
*BRE:	Yeah.I don't know.I might get one gateau.
*DAV:	Well   (        ) eat things like that won't she?
*BRE:	Yeah.Well I might tell her to bring it.But   (.) that's it, I'm not buying   (.) I've got a couple of boxes of chocolates we bought from Tescos didn't we?Those Suchard things. (.) Jean's bought me a tin of biscuits and a tin of   (.) of   (        ) tin of biscuits so there's ample biscuits. (.) Erm and it's just   (.) bits of crisps.
*DAV:	Mm.
*BRE:	There's nothing really.And a couple of bottles of wine. (.)  (        ) 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	No.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	And that's it. (.) So it hasn't really.I mean today I've I paid all this cash.
*DAV:	Just sit there in a  (        ) 
*BRE:	Well I just think of the fact and I know it's sort of miserable but   (.) Christmas night I think well, if you've gotta sort of something like you've got to put up with your mum and dad   (.) and I think well just the more the merrier.Because just sort of go for it and it's all done and then
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	 (        ) visit.You let them visit you on that night and that's it. (.) 
*DAV:	 [laughing]  (        ) diet and you'll end up having his dinner  [] .
*BRE:	Well we'll just say no.
*DAV:	 (        ) are we?
*BRE:	We'll tell him  (        ) .We're, we're not around. (        ) 
*DAV:	 ((blowing nose)) 
*BRE:	we know they're gonna be around we'll just say you know we're not gonna be around. (.) Cos we might feel when we come out there   (.) we'll look at the turkey, might go for a walk or   (.) go 
*DAV:	Er don't think so!
*BRE:	Are the pubs open?
*DAV:	Yeah I reckon the pubs open. (        ) 
*BRE:	Yeah.Christmas?
*DAV:	 (        ) If you go    (        )  (.) Ten till twelve.I mean if you have a good hour in there you're not gonna get in smack on ten   (        ) be there about   (.) twenty past ten, probably get in about twenty to eleven that's just right.Get out at twelve   (.)
