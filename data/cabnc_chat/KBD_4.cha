*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	I mean, they can't possibly erm   (.) you know, cos they 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	can't, you can't accuse   (.) just Jean of corruption, they've got to   (.) they've got to accuse   (.) the development corporation of corruption as well.You know, cos you can't be corrupt just on one person, you've gotta have two people playing

*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	It was only, only about ninety people   (.) two hundred people   (.) Friday.I think it was overspeculated in the press that we've   (.) sold the premises and it, it   (.) well gave the impression that perhaps we might be open   (.) you know, some people might not think we're open even.
*ALA:	Well that's what, what I said on Saturday 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	they didn't think they'd be open, you know.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	When they come for tea, you know 
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	on Friday, thought they were closed.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	And if you're coming through from Lancaster, you know, as soon a it's a far old drag innit?After the pubs are closed, on the off-chance, I mean, cos if you get here what the hell do you do if   (.) not as if you've got an alternative is there?
*ALA:	No.
*BAR:	You know.If yo if you're gonna come here yo  (.) you're the ki not on a Saturday night, you're not the kind of clientele that's gonna go to the Empire

*MAR:	Er, I think they have, I think they'd have, I think they have two buses on er er   (.) a week so   (.) and then they go back if there's any more.
*BAR:	It's a long haul that innit though?
*MAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	Here.I mean, how many students are from Morecambe nowadays?Er, d'ya know?
*MAR:	I've no idea.
*BAR:	Must be a fair number.
*MAR:	I've no idea to be honest.There's not as many as there used to be.
*BAR:	No.No, no, no.I mean we  (.) when I   (.) when I came here   (.) it was virtually, virtually half, half the population of that.And then there was   (.) maybe a thousand people out of out of Morecambe.
*MAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	That's it.And the Uni was then only about two thousand eight hundred strong.
*MAR:	Mm.But there's quite a lot of erm   (.) development in Lancaster now.They're doing loads of   (.) erm, flats and there's all those, all that stuff round    (        )  (.) Highcross area.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*MAR:	But   (.)  (        ) .
*BAR:	Is it?
*MAR:	I think so, but   (.) well that's part of St. Martin's College really, isn't it that er
*BAR:	Some of it is.I thought some of it was the Uni.But, you know, I mean, if the Uni goes to ten thousand in   (.) what   (.) what is it, it's getting up for about ninety five, ninety six?It's quite quick.
*MAR:	Something like that.
*BAR:	It's 
*MAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	very quick   (.) really.Yeah, I mean that, well it's only fo well it's four, five thousand now?But I mean you're talking
*MAR:	Six.
*BAR:	It's five.Well, whatever.
*MAR:	Six.
