*TER:	Soup mix or something or other.

*TER:	No it's alright, no we can go there.
*MAR:	let's go there another time, I don't mind. (.) We'll wander round, I mean let's   (        ) to know that we can sort of just have a little walk as it were.

*MAR:	the, what do you call them's?The  's.
*TER:	Oh the  's, yes I think I have se noticed them, yes.
*MAR:	The cottage is on one side and something on the other. (.) And it's  something on a big gate. (.) This can be our half term treat.
*MAR:	Right. (.) Where did Richard say   (        ) was yesterday? (.) You said something or other to him
*TER:	Yes, I can't remember now. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) Helen's   (        ) is she?Cos they don't have half terms do they?
*TER:	I think they do actually.
*MAR:	Oh do they?Yeah. (.) 
*TER:	There you are, dog warden.
*MAR:	Dog warden yes, mm.
*TER:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	Now I filed my nail this morning cos it was catching, I didn't file it long enough obviously, but I filed it with that erm   (.) you know you opened up the 
*TER:	Oh yes, yeah.
*MAR:	and left the f the file on the windowsill   (.) I hope he pulls in and lets people go past.Oh he's going left.
*TER:	He's going l left here. (.) Going into the cemetery.
*MAR:	 ((cough)) 
*TER:	Trouble is, person in front's got a trailer as well.
*MAR:	Oh yes, mm. [whispering] Oh he's going right     (        )  []  (.) right into there. (        ) 
*TER:	Oh this one's going right as well, oh, very good. (.)  ((laugh))  (.) 
*MAR:	What were we talking about? (.) 
*TER:	 [laughing] I don't know  [] .
*MAR:	I was talking about something, I don't know   (.) mentioned about Paul and then I'd said about Helen   (        ) 
*TER:	Helen, yeah.
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) Anyway erm   (.) Richard was feeling quite relieved about the
*TER:	I think so, yes the planning 
*MAR:	about the 
*TER:	permission being turned down, yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	No I don't blame him, I mean   (        ) 
*TER:	No I don't.
*MAR:	lot of times I've, you know, thinking sort of is sh  (.)  (        ) 
*TER:	I mean he's got a nice house there, he doesn't want it erm
*MAR:	That's right.
*TER:	spoiled.The trouble is I mean if, if it did, it came up and he wanted to sell it would of   (.) it would obviously decrease the value.
*MAR:	Yeah, that was what he was thinking of. (.) 
*TER:	You'd get all the rubbish from a   (.) take-away as well blowing into his garden, I mean it wouldn't have been very pleasant. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) much   (.) he reckons his house is worth now.But I suppose in a way they would have then been contemplating   (.) selling their own house and getting somewhere else before in fact
*TER:	Yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	It's a shame because I mean it   (.) I think what they've got is really   (.) you know, er er er they'd be hard put to it to get anything   (.) as good really at the price I think.Mind you they'd probably get a hundred thousand for theirs I should think now. (.) 
*MAR:	Yes I think, that's what I was thinking of. (.) 
*TER:	Do you remember when we used to come out here for the primroses? ((laugh)) That's a long time ago isn't it?
*MAR:	Did we come out this far then?
*TER:	Well used to come out to Totnes didn't we?By

*TER:	No.
*MAR:	but erm   (.) yes the garden's alright but then they've been there in the garden all the winter as well 
*TER:	Yes that's right. (.) There's a lot of sheep there.

*TER:	No.
*MAR:	possibility of a new job and I didn't mention it to her.
*TER:	No well I, I'm n 
*MAR:	I got the feeling Bob said it wasn't
*TER:	I, I'm not absolutely sure from what Bob said whether she even knows about it.I think   (.) I don't know, I may be wrong there but erm  (.) 
*MAR:	We ought to go down and investigate the erm   (.) the   (        ) you know.
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	I know people say well oh it's, of course it's changed ownership, well   (.) things change ownership and it can be for the better as well for the worst can't it? (.) The   (        ) sit down snack bar
*TER:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] 
*MAR:	or something.Didn't get to read   (        ) 
*TER:	No I didn't get to read it either.Something on the right I think it was.bed and breakfast there, whatever that is.

*MAR:	lay-by or something. (.) 
*TER:	Must be here look.
*MAR:	Oh it is a lay-by, yes. (.) Yes that'll be it. (.) 
*TER:	Gosh, suddenly a lot of traffic.That's the first we've erm
*MAR:	Mm. (        ) 
*TER:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	Perhaps it's market day at   (.) Totnes? (.) It's funny er when Richard came in the other day and said he'd been   (.) he'd been to the dentist and you said oh well they haven't been in touch with us yet.
*TER:	Yes isn't it? (.)  (        ) we ever meet this lady.
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*TER:	It was funny to hear Miss  and not Harold . (.) 
*MAR:	Oh is that her name?
*TER:	Mm yeah.
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) You can walk along the river can't you erm   (.) that's at Dartington isn't it? (.) 
*TER:	Erm
*MAR:	And that's where you can walk along and you, you know, er when there are   (.) salmon leaping
*TER:	Oh it's only the road, I don't think there's a, I don't think there's a walk along there   (.) not here.
*MAR:	I thought there was   (.) somewhere.They've got that erm   (.) got that big sculpture somewhere about there. (.) Somewhere near the college I think.
*TER:	Well I mean we can   (.) we're er I'll,w we'll 
*MAR:	I just can't remember.
*TER:	I'll go to Dartington via that back road   (.) cos you can go that way   (.) turn off up here   (.) and see. (.) 
*MAR:	Was it through the grounds of the 
*TER:	Yeah 
*MAR:	college
*TER:	mm well
*MAR:	that I'm thinking of?
*TER:	you can drive through the grounds of the college.
*MAR:	 ((cough))  (.) Are there lights?
*TER:	Yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	 (        ) side and Dart side. (.) I can't really remember where it was exactly. (.) We did walk somewhere one time and erm   (.) very very nice the   (.) it must have been the time when the salmon were   (        ) riverside walk.
*TER:	Oh yes   (        ) yes. (.) Well we've never been along that, actually.
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) Still got a lot of erm
*TER:	Yeah, making ponds and things by the looks of things. (.) 
*MAR:	Making new roads?
*TER:	Making ponds by the looks of things,
*MAR:	Oh.
*TER:	yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	Wonder if the only time I was, when I saw this, was
*TER:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	somewhere er when Christopher was with us.
*TER:	You see that's no, oh no parking in this area.Erm  (.) 
*MAR:	Well it doesn't matter really, it was just that I sort of 
*TER:	It looks as if there is a walk down there but we've never been on it but tell you where you may be thinking of, you may be thinking of that walk that goes towards the erm   (.) adventure park   (.) at the other side of Buckfastleigh.
*MAR:	No it wasn't, it was in here in the grounds of erm   (.) Dartington.
*TER:	We've sat here in the car and watched the erm   (.) the birds down there. (.) 
*MAR:	I'm wondering whether it was erm   (.) one ti er we, we walked up a hill and the   (.) the erm sculpture was sort of up on a hill.
*TER:	There's a railway line down there you see.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) Funny isn't it? (.) Have to ask Christopher if he knows. (.) I can't think of how we got in. (.) Th there's that but that looks fairly   (        ) 
*TER:	That's very new, yes. (.) 
*MAR:	There's a bridge somewhere, do you know a bridge anywhere here? (.) Funny isn't it?
*TER:	Yeah it is funny. (.) 
*MAR:	I, I have got a sort of vague feeling that   (.) maybe it wasn't with you we walked along it, maybe it was Christopher and Amanda. (.) This is all the college   (.) buildings isn't it? (.) 
*TER:	There's Park Road there, now I've never been down there
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Well I d 
*MAR:	Gallery and  (        ) 
*TER:	Now I've just seen traffic a long way down here, leading to Ella Park and Warren Lane, now I, I've   (.) never been along here and I don't know but I   (.) c coming up the road I saw cars down here
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) car park for residents only.
*TER:	And that's no through road there, obviously. (.) Well there's no point in going through here then like that. (.) 
*MAR:	He's turning right as well. (.)  (        )  (.) 
*TER:	Cos we can get out here I think.
*MAR:	Oh is this the  (.)

*MAR:	 (        ) cottages. (.) All these sleeping policemen they've got.
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	I suppose with all the students   (.) wandering about    (.)  (        ) pedestrians    (        )  (.) Yes I wonder where that was cos I'm sure there was a Henry Moore sculpture. (.) 
*TER:	Oh there's a Henry Moore sculpture in the grounds

*MAR:	Yeah well er you see this was in the grounds at Dartington 
*TER:	Mm.Mm.

*TER:	But it's that side away from the river, you know, I   (.) I can't link it with the river.
*MAR:	Well y we walked
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	like er   (.) it would be a sort of
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	hill like that, a grassy place. (.)  (        ) suppose they've still got quite a bit of   (.) own a lot of    (.)  (        ) put plants up there   (.) and there. (.) 's quality meat, my goodness they're still going strong. (.)
