        Where you went skiing is this side of Austria, but Vienna is about two hundred and  two hundred and fifty miles further on across Austria, very close to  erm  Czechoslovakia and erm Yugoslavia. •333702_350372•

*TER:	So can it go twelve hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour? •380462_384012•
*LUC:	No. •384322_384382•
*TER:	How far can it go in half an hour? •384762_386622•
*LUC:	Erm one hundred and  •386802_387442•
*TER:	One thousand  •387442_387792•

*TER:	one hundred •390012_390752•
*LUC:	yeah, yeah fifty  •390752_391482•
*TER:	and fifty, right, so the answer is no it can only do  eleven hundred and fifty  kilometres in half an hour. •391482_399732•
        Right, average speed  •427622_429612•
*LUC:	Ha  oh   Terry •432982_435782•
*TER:	Mhm? •435782_436082•

*LUC:	Okay  •452032_452222•
*TER:	we'll be able to manage it. •452332_453312•
*LUC:	Yeah. •454252_454322•
        Okay. •454942_455092•
        It is a hundred miles from King's lions •459302_462002•
*TER:	King's Lynn. •462362_463262•
*LUC:	King's Lynn  where's that? •463642_467682•
*TER:	Erm  do you know where The Wash is? •467682_470332•
        No   if you think of a map of England  erm  the south coast is there, there's Dover, there's the estuary for London, London is here  erm  then it comes up like this, the east coast of London, the east coast of England  like that  this is East, called East Anglia, here you've got Norfolk and Norwich and then you've got Ipswich here and then you've got Suffolk there and Essex, right? •470702_512132•
        Can you remember that bulge in the map of England? •512732_515282•
        Well that piece up there is called The Wash  •515932_518722•
*LUC:	Oh. •520792_520822•
*TER:	and King's Lynn is close to the wash, King's Lynn is in this area here. •521672_525132•
*LUC:	Oh. •526022_526052•
*TER:	So from London to King's Lynn is, they say, a hundred miles and I'll take their word for it, London to Ipswich in fact is seventy miles. •526472_535542•
*LUC:	Oh. •536162_536212•
*TER:	But, yeah, that's about a hundred miles you see, that would be about right, yeah. •537412_540392•
*LUC:	Oh. •540742_540802•
*TER:	So that's where it is. •540972_542052•
        North of London. •543262_543962•
        Up by The Wash. •544792_545602•
        Right  it is a hundred miles from King's Lynn to London, the train takes two hours to do the journey  the train does not go at a constant speed, it speeds up sometimes and slows down at other times  it also stops at stations on the way  and once of course as it, as it's stopping it's going more and more slowly and as it's  er moving off again it starts slowly and starts to go quickly but because it takes two hours in all  the train goes a hundred miles in two hours we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour. •546922_586002•
        It says if it was travelling at a constant speed of fifty miles an hour. •588252_592272•
        It doesn't, sometimes it goes more slowly sometimes it goes more quickly, sometimes it stops  but because it takes two hours to do the hundred miles we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour. •593642_605802•
        Its real speed changes during the journey  sometimes it is more than fifty miles per hour, sometimes less  but in two hours it goes the same distance as it would if its speed was fifty miles per hour all the time. •606662_620522•
*LUC:	Oh. •620712_620832•
*TER:	So we say its average speed is fifty miles per hour. •621302_624892•
        There used to be a train called the Cheltenham Flyer   there it is   it went from Cheltenham to London  a hundred and twenty miles  in two hours  do you know where Cheltenham is? •627942_645922•
*LUC:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Well if there is  the south coast along here and Cornwall is there and Devon is here and you get the the Bristol Channel going up here  and then you the coast coming down here and there's  Wales is here  right? •648692_663632•
        Bristol is there, right? •669122_671982•
        And if you go up from Bristol on from here you go up the motorway to Bristol and then you go along the M four to London  well north of Bristol, up where the River Severn gets quite narrow and can be bridged is a city called Gloucester  and Cheltenham is just inland from Gloucester. •671982_693172•
*LUC:	Oh. •693742_693902•
*TER:	So Cheltenham is about there, and it's about a hundred and twenty miles from Cheltenham to London. •693902_700202•
*LUC:	Mm. •700332_700642•
*TER:	Right? •701332_701442•
*LUC:	Okay. •701512_701682•
*TER:	So there's Cheltenham. •701682_703832•
        Right so it  went from Cheltenham to London, a hundred and twenty miles, in two hours, what was its average speed? •705262_715202•
*LUC:	Mm  •731732_731872•
*TER:	Well if it, if it  average speed is a hundred and twenty miles in two hours  how far in fact would it go in one hour? •731872_739712•
*LUC:	Sixty. •740092_740262•
*TER:	So what was its average speed? •740262_741882•
*LUC:	Sixty. •742472_742922•
*TER:	Sixty miles per hour. •742922_743732•
*LUC:	Oh •745792_745932•
*TER:	It wasn't its actual speed  there will be sometimes it will be going very slowly, sometimes it will be going much more quickly  but its average speed  was sixty miles an hour because at sixty miles an hour it would cover a hundred and twenty miles, which was the distance, in two hours. •745932_762152•
*LUC:	Oh •763042_763482•
*TER:	Right? •763482_763632•
*LUC:	This book isn't very big is it? •763632_765432•
*TER:	No, none of them are really are they? •765612_767412•
        Well this one's very small isn't it? •767412_769052•
*LUC:	Yeah cos look   •769202_769832•
*TER:	Oh well you're gonna get on aren't you? •769832_771692•
        Great, yeah, you're half way through. •771762_773692•
*LUC:	Ha! •774712_774962•
        Only got nine pages •774962_776312•
*TER:	Mm. •778312_778642•
        Right so that was C one, C two   it is a hundred and fifty miles from Hereford to London by rail   Hereford is north of Cheltenham, it's going up from Cheltenham is Hereford  the first train in the morning takes three hours for the journey  what's its average speed ? •778832_800432•
        Right  •800432_800552•
*LUC:	Can we go on the computer today? •803342_807162•
*TER:	Well there might be time, we'll see how we get on. •807162_813632•
        Now it says B  what did you do with the numbers one hundred and fifty  and three to get the answer ? •813632_820432•
*LUC:	Divided a hundred by three. •820892_822362•
*TER:	Right so you write that down, you divided a hundred and fifty  by three. •822362_829762•
*LUC:	I wonder what my brother's doing now. •831902_834882•
*TER:	Well at the present moment it's about, where he is it's about half past five, twenty to six, so he is probably  waiting for his supper I should think  his evening meal. •834882_847862•
        He won't be, he'll have finished skiing now. •847862_856572•
*LUC:	Mm. •856572_857012•
        Does it get dark over there quick? •857012_864392•
*TER:	It probably gets dark about the same time as it does here. •864822_874002•
*LUC:	It's not dark quicker there now  would it? •874012_883642•
*TER:	No it would probably be, you know, no it will be about this, be a little bit darker than this. •883642_902632•
        It gets dark, it'll be dark there before it is dark here •902632_909672•
*LUC:	Mm. •909842_909992•
        mm •909992_910332•
*TER:	because it's further east  so the sun is further away from them  because the sun rises in the east so it gets light earlier  that's why we put the clocks on  when you go to Europe, one hour. •911212_946562•
*LUC:	Oh. •946562_946712•
        In America it's loads isn't it? •946712_953912•
*TER:	Well in America it's the other way, in America it is after us because they are further west than we are. •953912_990852•
*LUC:	Yeah cos it's about six hours different. •996432_100525•
*TER:	Mm, that's right. •100549_100851•
        Right C three •100903_100944•
*LUC:	I've been to Penzance. •100945_101633•
        I know  •101633_101646•

        It's about a hundred and thirty miles from us down to Penzance. •106387_109793•
        So you know we're  about two hundred miles from London, so we're about, only about two thirds of the way from London to Penzance. •109806_112425•
*LUC:	Have you been to erm Land's End since they've  •112425_113431•

*LUC:	What's a hovercraft? •189407_189816•
*TER:	Well  it's a very specialized boat in a sense, I mean it goes on the surface of the water and it literally goes on the surface of the water, it's a  hovercraft is a sort of a  it's a vessel which has got a skirt all round it  •189817_191401•
*LUC:	Is it a rubber one? •191401_191588•
*TER:	Yes, heavy thick rubber skirt and that  the engines do two things, they, they drive  propellers in the air  and they  pump air from under the vessel onto the surface of the water  and the skirt round the boat  •191596_194689•
*LUC:	Keeps dry  •194689_194709•
*TER:	keeps a cushion of air under the vessel so that really it hovers on top of the water and the air propellers drive it like an aeroplane •194709_195861•
*LUC:	Oh •195861_195876•
*TER:	but it skims across the surface of the water and it's very quick, it only takes half an hour to go from Ramsgate to Dover. •195912_196990•
*LUC:	Mm! •197120_197134•
*TER:	Right  er from Swanage to Ventnor is thirty two miles so how long would a motor boat take? •197134_197641•
*LUC:	Eight hours. •197669_197722•
*TER:	Eight hours, right. •197722_198169•
*LUC:	Colin's dad's got a boat. •198169_198344•
*TER:	Has he? •198437_198478•
        And how long would it take to go round the Isle of Wight, which is sixty miles round the Isle of Wight? •198478_199839•
*LUC:	Er  erm  fifteen? •199881_199998•
*TER:	Fifteen hours, right. •199998_200765•
        Right D two  how long does it take to go from Ventnor to Swanage in a launch with a speed of eight miles per hour ? •200765_202186•
*LUC:	Oh  Ventnor, where's Ventnor? •202258_202492•
        Ah  twenty two miles  four •202492_203191•
*TER:	Right. •203411_203429•
*LUC:	four hours. •203503_203651•
*TER:	Right, now you get the answer to D two by dividing the distance  by the speed •203741_204604•
*LUC:	Mm? •204604_204648•
*TER:	thirty two's the distance divided by the speed  which is eight, thirty two divided by eight is four  this is the rule for working out a journey time  distance  in miles divided by speed in miles per hour gives you the time in hours. •204649_207087•
        Right. •207087_207126•
        You need a calculator. •207126_207230•
*LUC:	I need a calculator. •207230_207459•
        Ooh •207459_207488•
*TER:	How many hours does it take to go seven hundred and five miles at forty seven miles per hour? •207488_208509•
*LUC:	Fifteen hours. •208693_208887•
*TER:	Right. •208891_208901•
*LUC:	This is fun I like talking into   This diagram shows the reach or an airline  distances  are in kilometres  the figures for them are only rough  one, a jet flies from Beirut •208901_211382•
*TER:	Beirut to •211413_211474•
*LUC:	to Bombay at four thousand kilometres. •211528_211796•
        Its speed is about eight hundred kilometres per hour •211796_212176•
*TER:	Eight hundred and  •212176_212373•
*LUC:	fifty •212512_212550•
*TER:	fifty •212550_212556•
*LUC:	kilometres per hour  to work out the time it takes we do four thousand divided by three er eight hundred and fifty. •212556_213231•
        The answer on the calculator is four point seven O five double eight two three hours but we do not need that  as that  •213231_214042•
*TER:	To be as exact as that  •214042_214170•
*LUC:	because the distance is  •214170_214279•
*TER:	because the not exactly four thousand miles and the speed is not exactly eight hundred and fifty kilometres per hour . •214279_214940•
*LUC:	The nearest whole number of hours is good enough. •215005_215346•
        The nearest whole number of hours   Do you take it by that number? •215346_215820•
*TER:	The nearest whole number to four point seven  the nearest whole number to four point seven nought  five double eight  two three is five because  to the nearest whole number you look at that four, it's either gonna be four or five depending upon what that number is •215820_217678•
*LUC:	Mm. •217759_217760•
*TER:	isn't it? •217760_217815•
        If that's five or more then you increase that by one and make it five. •217816_218166•
        So the journey time is about five hours. •218180_218410•
        So D four  work out these journey times to the nearest hour. •218410_219165•
        Bombay to Perth at about eight hundred and fifty kilometres an hour   •219165_221586•
*LUC:	Bombay to Perth   eight •221673_221899•

*TER:	Right. •227002_227023•
*LUC:	It only takes half an hour to go to Austria doesn't it? •227023_227301•
        No, it takes an hour  •227301_227437•

        Right •230610_230634•
*LUC:	E •230634_230678•
*TER:	Now this is quite important, you've got to think about this   calculate as work in decimals . •230694_231768•
        But we usually think of time as hours and minutes and seconds too if we are being very exact. •231768_232592•
        This scale shows both minutes  and decimals as an hour. •232592_233444•
        Thirty minutes  half an hour, nought point five •233595_233953•
*LUC:	Mm •234156_234195•
*TER:	right? •234211_234255•
        Erm fifteen minutes  nought point two five. •234255_234852•
        Forty five minutes  three quarters of an hour, nought point seven five  and all the different calculations in between fifty minutes is about nought point  that's nought eight, that's nought nine so it'd be nought point eight one, two •234852_236935•
*LUC:	Four •236935_236960•
*TER:	three isn't it? •236961_237021•
        Just over three. •237028_237168•
*LUC:	Mm yeah. •237196_237449•
*TER:	Right? •237449_237457•
        So it says  this scale shows both minutes and decimals and now use the scale to change these to minutes . •237466_238352•
        Now what's point three of an hour  in minutes? •238353_239148•
*LUC:	Ten point •239196_239458•
*TER:	No  nought point three's there look •239458_239634•
*LUC:	Mm •239721_239733•
*TER:	now you want to read off the top of the scale for minutes. •239733_240056•
*LUC:	Fifteen minutes •240064_240155•
*TER:	That's ten minutes •240156_240275•

        Then  E, change these to decimals of an hour  twenty four minutes  •248050_248628•
*LUC:	Nought point four. •248636_248729•
*TER:	Nought point four. •248729_249117•
        Fifty one minutes? •249117_249550•
*LUC:	Nought point eight five. •249550_249679•
*TER:	Nought point five, good. •249679_250219•
        Five minutes •250519_250585•
*LUC:	Nought point  nought point nought eight. •250732_251251•
*TER:	Right. •251299_251329•
        And thirty five minutes. •251329_251894•

*TER:	Right. •252908_252921•
        Right well we'll just do this then you can have a go on the computer. •252921_253247•
        The distance from London to Weymouth is a hundred and forty three miles  the train takes two hours forty two minutes for the journey  •253247_254924•
*LUC:	Mm? •254924_254938•
*TER:	we can find the train's average speed like this  change forty two minutes to a decimal of an hour   what's that? •254938_256192•
*LUC:	Nought point seven. •256192_256386•
*TER:	Right. •256386_256395•
        From the scale above forty two minutes equals nought point seven hours •256395_257069•
*LUC:	Mm. •257069_257095•
*TER:	that means the journey time  is two point seven hours , two hours forty two minutes is two point seven hours •257095_258178•
*LUC:	Mm. •258178_258185•
*TER:	divide the distance by the time  hundred and forty three divided by two point seven equals fifty two point nine  round off to the nearest whole number  that would be? •258185_259564•
*LUC:	Fifty three. •259632_259658•
*TER:	So the average speed is about fifty three miles per hour. •259658_260182•
*LUC:	Oh. •260182_260214•
*TER:	So do the first one here •260214_260448•
*LUC:	Okay •260448_260485•
*TER:	D two, London to Bristol, a hundred and eighteen miles at one hour twenty seven minutes . •260544_261477•
*LUC:	Nought point nought point four five. •261535_261647•
        So one hour one hour point, point forty five? •261758_262235•
*TER:	One point four five •262261_263385•
*LUC:	Yeah. •263393_263421•

*TER:	It's the reciprocal button •271814_272030•
*LUC:	Oh •272095_272105•
