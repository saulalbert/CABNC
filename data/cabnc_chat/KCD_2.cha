*UNK:	I wasn't really expecting to go into Jenny's. •269535_271565•

*HEL:	Yes. •282055_282345•
        She might do. •282545_283535•
*AMY:	Pardon? •284285_284635•
*HEL:	I don't think she expected a present  •285425_288015•

        Jenny was expecting a present. •309915_314075•
        From what's come in. •314075_314675•
        She looked a bit surprised didn't she? •314675_316295•
*CLA:	Yes hmm •316365_317375•
*HEL:	You know  she'd rather do Chimneys or something tomorrow than London Zoo. •319595_344335•
*AMY:	Pardon? •344465_345075•
*HEL:	We rather go to Chimney's tomorrow than to London Zoo. •346335_348695•
*CLA:	Oh. •348695_348805•
        I was asking. •349125_350925•

        It's not too far aways. •377945_379105•
*HEL:	No it's easier. •379895_380905•
        But it's easier if you got tact. •380905_383195•
*CLA:	Why  •384865_385185•
*HEL:	It's easier if you've got tact tomorrow •385565_388175•
*CLA:	Mm  Why? •389085_393155•
*HEL:	Well  because tac doesn't finish till till half past twelve. •393825_397915•

*AMY:	He's got a musical test which says don't they're tired they're tired and then he said the pig says I'm not  and then the people said Oh dear and then he said I'm hungry and then they said they're hungry and he says I'm not and he's sleepy . •515575_534835•
        I don't like  story. •534875_541685•
        She read that to me. •542205_543425•
        It was quite easy um I read it again to her . •543425_549545•
        It was quite a good reason really. •549545_559415•
*HEL:	Well I think Jenny's um sort of  •559945_562855•
*AMY:	We've never had hardly seen it before because I haven't lawn in that book before have I? •566465_572135•

        Oh is that in her book? •582585_587295•
*HEL:	You could read it could you? •587295_588615•
*AMY:	Mm. •588615_588775•
        But if I just she said lawn so I knew what it said. •589195_593445•
*HEL:	 ((laugh))

*HEL:	I hope not. •619005_620905•
*CLA:	you aught to use long words. •620905_624345•
*HEL:	That's probably what they want to know. •624345_628165•
        Which words you do use. •628255_629405•
*CLA:	Can't remember  •629405_632115•

*AMY:	I'll get pictures of Mrs.  just about to fall in the sea or something   •105716_106087•
*CLA:	Just about what? •106360_106414•
*AMY:	And then Mr Staton asleep on the lake or something •106414_106709•
*HEL:	You'd be lucky to find one of Mr Statton asleep •106721_107087•
*CLA:	 ((cough))  ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	I don't think he's going to go to sleep while he's in charge of thirty of you. •107087_107780•
*CLA:	Then  here you are just  •107780_107868•
*AMY:	Is he in charge? •107868_108212•
*HEL:	He's in charge, yes. •108238_108402•

        Maybe if you really are they'll send you home. •109698_110436•
*AMY:	On your own? •110436_110617•
*HEL:	No. •110617_110629•
        One of the staff would have to come with you. •110682_110873•
        Not that  one of the  that couple. •110873_111360•
*AMY:	Yeah •111360_111395•
*HEL:	You can't ring the doctors on the Isle of White. •111436_111951•
*AMY:	Oh if you have been really ill  •111951_112601•
*HEL:	I should think the one's whose most vulnerable is Clare Montgomery. •112601_112956•
        She's just had her operation. •112956_113088•
*AMY:	I'm surprised she's still going on it so soon after. •113088_114005•
        She gets a cough. •114097_114174•
        If by any chance she catches it off me she's going to have a really sore throat isn't she? •114174_115045•
*HEL:	I think she wants to go. •115095_115359•
        I don't think anybody wants to be left behind. •115359_115518•
*CLA:	take more crisps. •115523_116384•
*HEL:	No I think you've had enough. •116384_116556•

        I didn't have many did I? •116726_117114•
*HEL:	No. •117831_117840•
        Don't know really. •118261_118362•

        You know er you get your packet money each day and you can buy things. •118556_118937•
        But I'm not over keen on nuts. •118948_119115•
*HEL:	Good fun . •119115_119343•
        I think if Mr. Statton says you'll be so tired  would you like to go and get your reading book and get a hanky and  •119365_119868•
*AMY:	You get prizes afterwards so that er one had the best kept room and another one •119886_120593•
*CLA:	Can you get a hanky? •120593_120699•
*HEL:	Where have you come? •120699_121208•
*AMY:	About five are the best people to live with. •121239_121638•
