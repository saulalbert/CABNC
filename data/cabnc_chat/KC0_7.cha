*IAN:	Yes. •225932_226062•
        Such a shame. •227792_229372•
*NOE:	Edmund is still in his job. •229372_230552•
*NOE:	Aha. •230882_230972•
*NOE:	He still hasn't got naturalization but he seems to be fairly  erm fairly secure. •231772_237042•
        He's a journalist of course. •237332_238542•
*IAN:	Yes. •239252_239482•
        Is he confident that he'll get the naturalization? •239992_242622•

*IAN:	Really? •257542_257692•

*IAN:	Oh I'd like to see that. •269482_276182•
*NOE:	But er  I'm just trying to think now er  Ben  er the trouble with it is, Edmund can't leave the country  whilst he's in a job  until he gets naturalization because he's got to get a work permit and an entry permit and everything all the way through •276212_293062•
*IAN:	Right. •293062_293152•
*NOE:	and  again er with the present state of unemployment in America it's unlikely he would get it. •295222_299882•
*IAN:	It's very difficult. •300482_301022•
        Yes. •301072_301162•
*NOE:	But he, he managed to  get his extension to his permit because he had these English connections and the paper he was on  reckoned that he was very valuable to them and so they •301422_313312•
*IAN:	Good. •314602_314722•
*NOE:	they held him. •314722_315442•

*IAN:	erm he's been in it twenty years  and er he's had it on the market for some time. •759952_766342•
        It probably not as long as a year but it's quite a while •767892_770932•
*ENI:	Mm. •772112_772412•
*IAN:	er and he's accepted our offer •772612_774592•
*ENI:	Good. •774852_775092•
*IAN:	but he doesn't seem actually willing to move out •775592_778972•
*ENI:	Oh  •779032_779062•
*IAN:	er which I can understand really. •779212_781692•
*ENI:	You, one gets very fond of a house really. •781692_783362•

*IAN:	although he must be sixty odd erm  and it's obviously a very difficult time for him. •785792_795192•
*ENI:	Yes. •795232_795292•
*IAN:	Erm so he's keeping us in limbo really •795352_797022•
*ENI:	Yes. •797132_797252•
*IAN:	which is a bit infuriating cos er Alison's due our third in    •797312_803132•
*ENI:	My! •803132_803192•
*IAN:	at the end of June  •803452_804802•
*ENI:	Oh. •805662_805792•
*IAN:	so er we have to be decided either way •805792_809162•
*ENI:	yes. •810092_810262•
*IAN:	by then. •810262_811002•
*ENI:	Yes. •811002_811222•
*IAN:	Oh we're quite happy to rent for a while. •811272_813192•
*ENI:	I was going to say that's the alternative I suppose  •813192_814812•
*IAN:	Yes, yes  •814812_815372•
*ENI:	to, yes. •815372_815822•
*IAN:	yes •816322_816432•
*ENI:	And you might even have to do this er for an interim period or something  •816432_819612•
*IAN:	Yes  •819612_819842•
*ENI:	until he decides  •819842_820302•

*IAN:	yes. •820862_821142•
*NOE:	places to rent alright? •821212_822402•
*IAN:	Yes you can actually, yes. •822402_823742•
        Yes. •824552_824772•
*ENI:	Mm yes, do help yourself Ian. •824852_826792•
        Erm so  where would he be meaning to go if he does let you  •826792_830702•
*IAN:	He wants to move down to a smaller house in Weybridge. •830702_833802•
*ENI:	Yes. •834052_834272•
*IAN:	Er which we're told shouldn't be difficult to find. •834342_838592•
*ENI:	Er no no. •838592_839802•
*IAN:	So erm, you know, hopefully that will be the case. •839802_842452•
*ENI:	Mm. •843952_844162•
*IAN:	But erm  I don't think he er realizes how difficult it is •844162_847072•
*ENI:	No. •847282_847512•
*IAN:	to set up •848232_849312•
*ENI:	No. •849312_849352•
*IAN:	a move and that really he's quite fortunate to have a buyer  somewhere within the price he wanted. •849432_856912•
*ENI:	Indeed. •857272_857402•
*IAN:	Cos we've all  you know, we've all not got as much for our houses as we want •857462_861252•
*ENI:	No that's very true. •861252_863472•

*IAN:	 (        )  (.) 
*ENI:	Mm. •866012_866172•
        Oh well let's hope that he will. •866172_867202•
        I mean the thing is  at the age of sixty he has no conception of what it's like to be your age at this period. •867532_874072•
*IAN:	Mm. •874442_874592•
        Well, you know, he hasn't bought a sold a house within the last ten years •875112_878962•
*ENI:	Mhm mm •879392_880442•
*IAN:	which we've done a number of times •880442_881752•
*ENI:	Yes. •882002_882122•
*IAN:	and it's not a pleasant  it's a very stressful business. •882662_885512•
*ENI:	I'm sure I'm sure it is. •885512_887252•
        I don't know how we escaped it so much but we have you see. •887742_890352•
        Because we lived on the business, that was •890352_891982•
*IAN:	Mm. •891982_892072•
*ENI:	er a foregone conclusion and we never  sought to move from there until he retired did we? •893072_899102•
*IAN:	Mm. •899102_899162•
*NOE:	No. •900442_900502•

*IAN:	which is obviously important. •929132_930712•
*ENI:	Yes. •931592_931682•
*IAN:	And erm they haven't had  Thomas doesn't remember not having Harry around •931682_936142•

*ENI:	Exactly. •950072_950612•
*IAN:	which er Thomas hasn't. •950682_952252•
*ENI:	It sours the relationship a bit. •952252_953642•
*IAN:	Yeah it does a bit. •954032_954362•
*ENI:	Yes aha. •955262_955992•
*IAN:	Mm. •955992_956052•
*ENI:	Ah well I  I  is this going to be, if it's a boy is this going to be a Benjamin? •956792_962092•

*IAN:	You decided to  •975302_976162•
*ENI:	He was five, number five . •976162_978372•
        Erm it would be nice to have a little girl then now wouldn't it  •978372_981332•
*IAN:	Mm  •981332_981392•

*NOE:	 ((laugh))
