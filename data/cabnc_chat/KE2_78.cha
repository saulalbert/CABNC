*MAR:	Well we keep on trying Father  we don't get a lot of encouragement, I mean you're only having one collection on Sunday nowadays. •_•
*HOL:	Do you want two? •_•
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Erm  we went  I went into the hall and saw that fire. •_•
        Erm, would erm Mr  sort of look after it and, you know, cos, would he be responsible for it do you think? •_•
        Because it's, the school children go in there as well you see and that's a little bit of a worry but, but if they don't use it it'd be alright. •_•
        But you know I'm just wondering what would happen when erm •_•
*HOL:	You see the, the elderly people on a Sunday morning who go in there and there's some, some rather  •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
*HOL:	disabled people and, and it's very cold in there. •_•
*TER:	They're too cold. •_•
        Well,you know,what happens when the cylinder goes? •_•
        Do you think he would erm  know what  •_•
*HOL:	pay out of the parish I suppose. •_•
*TER:	Mm? •_•
        No well I mean I can pay for it, it's just a question of getting it and sort of erm  only we're not often here on a Sunday, if Mr  is here, is it   •_•
*HOL:	He's not. •_•
*TER:	He's not. •_•
*HOL:	he goes with Father . •_•
        Not Father , to erm  er  erm   that place? •_•
        Ashburton. •_•
*TER:	Ashburton. •_•
*HOL:	You see there, there was a  er not paying for it, asking about it, the finance committee  how very cold it was for the elderly and they sit in there while some get taken home and  •_•
*MAR:	Doris, you're quite elderly aren't you? •_•
        I'm very elderly, my husband's very elderly, we manage very well. •_•
*HOL:	Well yes but you tell them that will you? •_•
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*HOL:	And they'll tell you to go to hell •_•
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*HOL:	if you tell them that. •_•
*MAR:	Well I'm on my way there anyway you see   •_•
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*HOL:	But no I mean that's not nice to say that because there are cripples •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
*HOL:	and people who just people  •_•
*MAR:	But some people feel the cold more than others. •_•
*HOL:	who er yeah  and  •_•
*MAR:	Don't they? •_•
*HOL:	there's very few going in to coffee because of the cold in the  •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
*HOL:	hall, it is a very cold   •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
*MAR:	Well when we have our meeting •_•
*TER:	Well it's just a question of really of, of if someone can, you know, I mean •_•
*MAR:	Are you going to put a new fire in or something? •_•
*HOL:	No no we've  we, we were talking about it actually, what we've done  and erm  of course it's the school children we've gotta think about •_•
*MAR:	Cos we have our meetings   •_•
*HOL:	There's nowhere to put it away is there? •_•
        It'll slide on on castors. •_•
*TER:	It'll slide on I mean I moved it into the corner so that erm  •_•
*HOL:	Yeah is there anywhere that it can be put away when the children are not there? •_•
        Or when the children are there. •_•
*TER:	Well I mean the children, I mean if I go into the school and I, and say to them look there is a fire there but, you know, please will you not use it but it's just a question of whether the children fiddle with it really, that's •_•
*GRO:	 (        )  (.) 
*HOL:	We'll have to think about it this week while they're away, they're on holiday this week. •_•
*TER:	Yes they are, that's true. •_•
        But it's also a question of, you know, erm  when it's exhausted •_•
*HOL:	Yeah well we can always arrange that. •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
        But I'll talk to you some time about the heating because I mean the trouble is that  •_•
*HOL:	Well er er the whole thing, the, the hall is, is, is a big worry because they won't insure us  because it's dangerous. •_•
        There's no insurance on that hall  to my knowledge  there's no insurance. •_•
*TER:	I didn't know that. •_•
*HOL:	Michael said to me, the first thing he said to me when I came here, that's the first I'd do, knock it down he said, it's, it's dangerous it's not . •_•
        That's what he said, the first thing he said to me when I came here. •_•
        That's, that's the first job you've gotta do, get that, rid of that. •_•
*TER:	So there's no point in spending a lot of money on it? •_•
*HOL:	No that's what I say and, and I've written to the insurer  to the insurer to tell, ask them what is the situation and we're still waiting an answer. •_•
*TER:	I see. •_•
*MAR:	But we, didn't we   •_•
*TER:	I thought, I mean I, the fire people gave it the all clear. •_•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Erm and with, and with the erm with those fan heaters in there, there is  as it were, no fire risk from it. •_•
*HOL:	No. •_•
        Well fan heaters can be on you know but you can't hear, feel them unless you're next to them I think. •_•
*TER:	Mm mm. •_•
        And the overhead heaters were no use either, I mean that's why we put the fan heaters in cos they were better than the •_•
*HOL:	Well let me wait, I'll tell, I'll I'll tell you what the insurers say when they come back, when it comes. •_•
        I'm waiting for them to answer. •_•
*TER:	Right. •_•
*HOL:	But it's not insured I can tell you that. •_•
        I have no erm er policy for it. •_•
        And I've, I was, I don't know if it was Michael or somebody else told me that they wouldn't insure it. •_•
*MAR:	Oh   well we've never known that have we? •_•
*TER:	No we've never known that, haven't heard that. •_•
*HOL:	Well that's, well there's no  •_•
*MAR:	Cos it was sort of insured when we first took it over. •_•
*HOL:	Yeah, there's no record of an insurance in the, the file. •_•
*MAR:	Oh I see. •_•
*HOL:	And so I, we have written to them and waiting for an answer. •_•
*TER:	Right. •_•
*HOL:	So when we, you see there's no good putting anything in there  erm  or doing anything with it  if we're not going to use it  or if it's gotta come down in another year or two. •_•
*TER:	No. •_•
*HOL:	Mind you when I said it's gotta come down it might be five years before it comes down, but you've gotta think of your outlay first. •_•
*TER:	Yeah I mean there's no point in re-roofing it for instance. •_•
*HOL:	Oh no. •_•
        Not as, as far as I know. •_•
        But we'll see what they say. •_•
*MAR:	Is the insurance through the diocese Father? •_•
*HOL:	Well it's, it's done  it's a er no •_•
*MAR:	No. •_•
*HOL:	it's done privately but it's, the diocese have appointed the insurers. •_•
*MAR:	I see. •_•
*HOL:	We're done through Peter  •_•
*MAR:	Mhm. •_•
*HOL:	he's the insurance broker and it all works through Norwich Union. •_•
*MAR:	Mhm. •_•
*HOL:	Erm  and he's got some very good quotes for us •_•
*MAR:	Yes. •_•
*HOL:	you don't er insure a building according to its size now but according to the number of people who use it. •_•
        It's far er fairer. •_•
*TER:	Mm. •_•
*HOL:	I mean you might have a massive building   •_•
*TER:	And hardly anybody using it. •_•
*HOL:	you've gotta pay for it. •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
*HOL:	So it's according to the number of people that use it, go to mass, how much you pay •_•
*TER:	Mm. •_•
*HOL:	erm on the insurance. •_•
        And it covers everything but as far as I know, and I'm willing to be corrected •_•
*TER:	Yeah I don't know. •_•
*HOL:	that, that is not insured. •_•
*MAR:	No well we don't know, we had thought that it was. •_•
        Especially after  •_•
*HOL:	No as far as  •_•
*MAR:	it was all done up. •_•
*TER:	Mm. •_•
*MAR:	Yes  after it was sort of  •_•
*HOL:	Well as far as well I know that Michael  •_•
*MAR:	renovated. •_•
*HOL:	Michael said to me, the first thing he said to me, that has to come down. •_•
*MAR:	How funny, he never ever said anything like that to us. •_•
        You've not heard that either? •_•
*MAR:	told me. •_•
*HOL:	That's the first thing, I know nothing about, no well I know nothing about structure or anything else, you know I mean  •_•
*MAR:	But they had I don't know if you know it had been absolutely dilapidated, the hall, I mean it was absolutely run down and it wasn't used. •_•
        But then there was this erm er er what was it called? •_•
        The scheme er er to help  •_•
*MAR:	The scheme, the youth scheme and er   •_•
*TER:	The  •_•
*MAR:	youngsters •_•
*TER:	Oh •_•
*MAR:	so that if   •_•
*TER:	The work, work something something scheme and and they, they'd refurbish it, all that we had to do was to pay for the materials, they provided the labour. •_•
        And in fact, you know, I mean they er they made it  •_•
*HOL:	Well it looks alright to me. •_•
*TER:	they made it useful again. •_•
*HOL:	But if I, if I •_•
*TER:	Usable. •_•
*MAR:	if I had anything to do with it, I would like those, those gas fires that we've got in the room at the back of the church there, they're ideal. •_•
*TER:	The trouble is there  •_•
*MAR:	The trouble is there's  •_•
*TER:	no mains gas  •_•
*MAR:	there's no gas. •_•
*TER:	into the hall. •_•
*HOL:	No well  •_•
*TER:	That is why we didn't, we would of liked to have had it but the cost to put the mains gas in was going to be so enormous •_•
*HOL:	Oh well •_•
*TER:	and the electric supply is limited to the heating that we've got, we can't put any more in because the mains supply again is not sufficient. •_•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*HOL:	This is amazing because in Cornwall they would put in the gas for nothing. •_•
*TER:	Well I mean, you know, I mean •_•
*HOL:	Cos we had it done in our hall. •_•
*MAR:	they are now , perhaps if you had a word with them  •_•
*HOL:	We, we we had it in our hall, we, they put it into the building for nothing •_•
*MAR:	Yeah •_•
*HOL:	and then you have to wire erm  plumb it in or whatever they call it   •_•
*MAR:	Yes   •_•
*TER:	Yes, that's fair enough. •_•
*HOL:	but they put it in to the meter in   •_•
*TER:	Well well this was the problem, it was gonna cost I don't know how many hundreds of pounds just to have the gas supply put to the hall and we felt that, at that time, we couldn't do it. •_•
*HOL:	Well I had the one   •_•
*MAR:	Presumably there's no gas here is there? •_•
*TER:	There's gas here. •_•
*HOL:	Yes   •_•
*MAR:	You have got gas here, yes, mhm there's gas   •_•
*TER:	Well that might be that might be worth a a query  •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	I mean that might be worth a query if the Finance Committee are sort of erm er er worrying about the heating. •_•
*HOL:	Well well we'll have to see what, what the, what the er insurance man says first •_•
*TER:	Yeah. •_•
*MAR:	Yes mhm. •_•
*HOL:	but it's a long time er term, we've gotta look at it  and we've got to do something about it  for, for heating  if we're going to use it, if we're going to let it or something •_•
*TER:	Yeah •_•
*HOL:	then there's got to be heat in there. •_•
*MAR:	Mm. •_•
        But you see the rent  Father  •_•
*HOL:	We each want the same  same thing. •_•
*MAR:	the rent of the hall is very cheap. •_•
*HOL:	Yes, but they'll have to •_•
*MAR:	But they have to put fifty pence into the  •_•
*HOL:	Yeah  •_•
*MAR:	the meter   •_•
*HOL:	yeah well  the gas ones the same   •_•
*MAR:	That's that's fifty pence a  yes? •_•
*HOL:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Mhm mhm •_•
*HOL:	They have to sort out   •_•
*MAR:	But if you find out about the insurance, see what that is  •_•
*HOL:	Yes   •_•
*MAR:	and then perhaps sort of contact the gas people again and see •_•
*HOL:	Yes •_•
*MAR:	I mean this was, how long ago ? •_•
*TER:	Oh this was seven years ago I suppose. •_•
*MAR:	About seven years ago so   •_•
*HOL:	two years ago when I was at  we had the gas put into the hall. •_•
*MAR:	Yeah. •_•
*HOL:	They didn't charge to put it in. •_•
*MAR:	No. •_•
        Well it would be worthwhile investigating anyway  •_•
*HOL:	Yeah  •_•
*MAR:	after we hear about the insurance. •_•
*HOL:	find out  yeah it's all an ongoing thing •_•
*MAR:	Yeah  it's all go isn't it ? •_•
*HOL:	Okay then thanks. •_•
*GRO:	 (        )  (.) 
*TER:	It's good isn't it? •_•
*MAR:	 (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*TER:	Well I think so. •_•
*MAR:	 (        )  (.)  (        )  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	I thought I was giving you a lift   •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Well I, I thought of perhaps, you know, of giving you a lift somewhere. •_•
