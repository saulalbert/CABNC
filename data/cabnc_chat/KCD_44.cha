*HEL:	Alright, here you are. •174787_174912•
*CLA:	Mummy. •174925_174940•
*HEL:	What? •174940_174968•
*CLA:	Do you go up to half term and . •175020_175155•
        What's half term? •175205_175299•
*HEL:	Well your on half term now aren't you? •175310_175746•
*CLA:	Oh, well I can't just have lots of terms, half terms, cos the next one half term. •175746_176208•
*HEL:	Half what?. •176208_176343•
*CLA:	And then there's a lot more. •176343_176426•
*HEL:	What are you talking about? •176441_176574•
        You have a term and then in a middle of the term you have a half term don't you? •176614_176943•
*CLA:	Then you have a nice place. •176943_177149•
*HEL:	Well. •177261_177288•
*CLA:	Go home. •177288_177324•
*HEL:	Well I don't know whether you go home from boarding school, you probably just have a day off, I don't know, I haven't been to boarding school. •177421_177997•
        Right, were do we get, sharp words . •178128_178341•
        The spider affair as it was called went all over the school before the day was out, it caused a great deal of laughter. •178612_179127•
        When mother,Mams Arougeaye heard of it she sneered. •179193_179608•
        To think that a French woman should be so foolish she said, though I didn't like spiders or earwigs or moths or even snakes. •179608_180332•
        Mams Audyponch should be ashamed to make her exhibition of herself. •180332_180742•
        The first form talked about it more than any one else, of course they squealed with laughter when they saw the poor Mary Lou Manselle and Gwendoline, all falling victims to the same spider, jolly clever spider said Irene, it means the only three people in the form that it  that would be scared of it, I take my hat off to that spider, can't think why it chose my desk said Mary Lou, no, that was a shame said Gwendoline, poor Mary Lou it must of been an awful shock for you when you saw it, I wonder who put it there? •180746_183368•
        There was a silence for the first time it occurred to first form that the spider might of been put there on purpose, they looked at one another. •183505_184036•
        It was a dirty trick to put it into to poor Mary Lou's desk said Jean, she can't help being scared of things I suppose, she almost jumped out of her skin when she saw it, I should of thought any joker in our form would of been decent enough to popped it into say Alicia's desk, not if it happened to be Alicia who popped it in said a sly voice, you do so love playing tricks don't you Alicia? •184174_186240•
        You and Daryl where in the first form room before afternoon school and I'm sure we'll all remember you saying you'd like to put a spider down Mary Lou's neck. •186240_187055•
        It was Gwendoline speaking, Alicia glanced at her, well I didn't do it she says, nor did Daryl, sorry to disappoint you darling Gwendoline, Mary, but we just didn't, if it was any one I should think it was you. •187055_188255•
        Mary Lou's my friend said Gwendoline, I wouldn't do that to her. •188255_188656•
        Well if you've almost drowned her one week I should think you could quite well bring yourself to put a spider in her desk the next week said Daryl. •188656_189301•
        It's pretty funny that you and Alicia were the only ones in the classroom before afternoon school persisted Gwendoline angry that no one seemed to agree with her suggestion. •189302_190227•
        Shut up said Catherine shortly, we know it wasn't Daryl or Alicia because they say so. •190227_190811•
        The spider must of got in there by accident and that's that. •190811_191280•
        Well I think began Gwendoline that the class took  at once. •191282_191591•
        Be quite Gwendoline, Gwendoline shut up, shut up Gwendoline, Gwendoline shut up. •191708_192302•
        There was nothing to do but to shut up, Gwendoline was sulking exasperated. •192302_192822•
        It had been such a good idea and all that had resulted from it was a double punishment for her and a complete failure to make anyone believe to Alicia or Daryl had played the trick. •192938_193855•
        True the first formers had had to go to bed an hour earlier, but they all voted it was worth it, Gwendoline felt vicious about the whole affair, she'd determining not to be put off by her first day there . •193855_194856•
*CLA:	What  erm hours early. •194939_195124•
*HEL:	She did. •195124_195366•
        She determine not to be put off by her first failure, but to go on doing things to Mary Lou so that in the end the class would have to put the tricks down to Alicia and Daryl. •195389_196308•
        She thought she would also hint to Miss Potts that Alicia and Daryl were at the bottom of things, but she didn't get very far with this, she had to go and see Miss Potts about some returned homework. •196308_197311•
        She stood very neatly beside her in the little room that Miss Potts shared with Mams Audiponde at North Tower. •197311_197837•
        Miss Potts I was awfully sorry about that spider affair the other day, she began, of course Alicia and Daryl were in the classroom before hand, I'm sure they know something about it, I heard Alicia say, Miss Potts looked up, are you trying to sneak she said, or in more polite language to tell tales, because if so, don't try it on me. •197845_199469•
        At the boarding school I went to Gwendoline we had a very good punishment for sneaks, all the girls in the sneak dormy gave her one good spank with the back of a hair brush. •199488_200291•
        You may have a lot of interesting things to tell me, but it's no use expecting me to listen. •200291_200751•
        I wonder if the girls here out the same punishment for sneaks, I must ask them. •200751_201174•
        Gwendoline went flaming red, as sneaks, fancy Miss Potts daring to call her that. •201174_201684•
        Gwendoline Mary Lacy a sneak, all because she just wanted to drop a kindly hint, Gwendoline didn't no what to say she felt as if she'd like to burst into tears, but Miss Potts always got very impatient with girls who did that. •201684_202829•
        She went out of the room longing to slam the door as she often did at home, but she didn't dare to here. •202829_203357•
        She felt very sorry for herself, if her mother new what an awful school she'd come to she would take her away at once, Miss Winter too would be horrified. •203357_204151•
        But Gwendoline wasn't quite so sure about her father, he can say things at times very like Miss Potts said. •204151_204775•
        The week went by, it was a very pleasant week, hot with a cool breeze that made games and swimming even more pleasant than usual, Alicia and Betty were practising hard for the school sport, both were excellent swimmers and divers . •204775_205872•
*CLA:	That's what I use. •205873_205937•
        That's not very nice is it . •205938_206054•
*HEL:	Hm no, well try not to keep banging it. •206076_206321•
*CLA:	It does on her and it's quite sharp. •206328_206526•
*HEL:	Oh dear. •206526_206674•
        Daryl tried to imitate all they did, she was good to, but not quite so good as they were, but she was quite fearless and divide of the highest diving board and went down a chute in all kinds of peculiar position. •206674_207686•
        The only unhappy person that week was Mary Lou. •207686_208152•
        She'd got into a lot of trouble over many little things, for instance, her clothes in the changing room were being thrown down in a pool of water, and was soaking wet, she had to take them to matron to be dried, matron was cross. •208153_209223•
        Mary Lou can't you hang your things up properly in that changing room? •209223_209636•
        You know there always puddles of water on the floor from the girls coming in and out of the pool. •209636_210134•
        I did hang them up matron said Mary Lou mildly, I know I did, then Mary Lou's tennis racket sudden showed three broken strings, they were not frayed, but looked as if they've been cut, Mary Lou was upset. •210145_211142•
        My new racket she said, look Gwendoline, who would think a new racket would go like that. •211142_211678•
        It couldn't said Gwendoline pretending to examine it very closely, those strings have been cut Mary Lou someone's been playing a trick on you, what a shame. •211682_212422•
        Mary Lou was miserable, she couldn't believe she had any enemy's, for when she found buttons cut off on her Sunday dress, she new someone was being unkind and mean, Gwendoline comforted her. •212422_213300•
        Never mind I'll sew them on for you, I hate sewing but I'll do it for you Mary Lou. •213300_213933•
        . So making a great show of it Gwendoline sowed on the six blue buttons one night. •214146_214584•
        The first former's stared at her in surprise, they knew she never mended any thing if she could help it. •214584_215212•
        How did those buttons come off asked Jean? •215212_215433•
        That's what I'd like to know said Gwendoline smugly, six buttons all ripped off I'm putting them on for Mary Lou because I'm so sorry any one should play at such a dirty trick. •215434_216278•
        I'd like to know who cut the strings of her tennis racket too, the first formers looked at one another, it certainly is queer the way things have been happening to poor Mary Lou lately, even her prayer book had disappeared and some of her pencils had gone. •216279_217402•
        True there'd been found in Alicia's desk, but everyone thought that was just an accident, now they began to wonder if someone had put them there, not Alicia, Lizzie wouldn't do a thing like that, but somebody, it was getting near half term and new the girls were excited because some of them were expecting visits from there parents. •217402_218988•
        Any parent who lived  not to far away would be sure to come. •218988_219510•
        Daryl  because her father and mother were coming. •219521_219825•
        They lived a long way away, but they decided to take a weeks holiday in Cornwall and decided to see Daryl in the middle of it. •219825_220425•
        The girls began to talk about there families, I wish my three brothers could come said Alicia, we'd have some sport then. •220425_221067•
        I wished my little sister could come said Jean, I'd love to show her Mallory Towers. •221078_221417•
        Is your mother coming Sally asked Mary Lou? •221417_221678•
        No said Sally she lives too far away. •221678_221921•
        Daryl remembered something your mother had told her in a letter a week or two before, she said that she'd met Sally Hopes mother and had liked her and she said to that she'd seen Mrs Hopes baby. •221921_222868•
*CLA:	Who?. •222887_222923•
*HEL:	Sally. •223111_223137•
        Sally's sister a little girl of three months, Daryl had meant to tell Sally what her mother had said and had forgotten and now she remembered. •223138_223795•
        Oh Sally I expect your mother won't come because of the baby she said. •223795_224099•
        Sally went stiff, she stared at Daryl as if she couldn't believe her ears, her face went quite white. •224099_224595•
        When she spoke she sounded as if she was chocking. •224595_224936•
        You don't know what your talking about she said, what baby? we haven't a baby, my mother won't be coming because it so far I tell you. •224936_225547•
        Daryl was puzzled, but Sally don't be silly my mother says in a letter she's seen your baby sister she's three months old she said. •225547_226197•
        I haven't got a baby sister said Sally in a low  queer voice, I'm the only one, mother and I have been everything to each other, daddy has to go, go away such a lot, I haven't got a baby sister. •226197_227673•
        . Girls looked at Sally curiously, whatever could be the matter with her she sounded so queer. •227687_228362•
        Oh right said Daryl and Elsie you ought to know I suppose any way, I'd suspect you'd like a sister, it's nice having one. •228362_228895•
        I should hate a sister said Sally, I wouldn't share my mother with anyone, she walked out of the room her face as wooden as ever, the girls were really puzzled, she's a funny one said Irene, hardly ever says anything, all closed up, somehow, but sometimes those closed up people burst open suddenly and then look out, well I'll shall certainly write and tell mother she's mistaken said Daryl and she did so. •228895_230925•
        Then the mesh, she told Sally the next time she saw her, I'm sorry I made that mistake about you having a sister she said to Sally, I've written to tell mother you've said you haven't one she must of been mistaken what your mother said. •230925_231983•
        Sally stood still and gazed, glared at Daryl as if she suddenly hated her. •231983_232328•
        What you want to go interfering for she burst out, leave me and my family alone, little busy body always sticking your nose into other people's affairs, Daryl's temper flared up, I don't she said, you gua rd your tongue Sally, I never meant to interfere and I can't think what all the fuss is about, either you have a sister or you haven't, I don't care. •232328_234187•
        You tell your mother not to interfere either said Sally, writing letters about my family. •234187_234622•
        Oh don't be so silly flared back Daryl really exasperated now, any one would think there was a deep dark mystery the way you go on, any way I'll just see what my mother says when she next writes to me and I'll tell you. •234622_235651•
        I don't want to know, I won't know said Sally as she put her hands  put out her hands as if she was fending Daryl off, I hate you Daryl Rivers, you with, you with your mother who comes to see you often, sends you things and writes you long letters and comes to see you. •235651_236897•
        You boast about that to me you do it all on purpose, your mean, mean, mean. •236897_237410•
        . Daryl was utterly taken about, what in the wide world did Sally mean, she watched the girl go out of the room and sat down on the form completely bewildered. •237410_238287•
        Right, half term at last. •238287_238350•
*CLA:	Half term at last. •238469_238510•
*HEL:	Hm. •238767_238792•
        Right teeth cleaned at least I think. •238802_239031•
        Come on. •239031_239049•
*CLA:	Teeth cleaned at last. •239049_239105•
*HEL:	And bed. •239448_•
