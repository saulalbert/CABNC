*HEL:	And take a photograph of everybody   (.) as you set off.Mr Staton always takes a group one so if you say just a minute I'd like one too. (.) 
*AMY:	I'll get pictures of Mrs.  just about to fall in the sea or something   ((laugh))  (.) 
*CLA:	Just about what?
*AMY:	And then Mr Staton asleep on the lake or something
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) You'd be lucky to find one of Mr Statton asleep
*CLA:	 ((cough))  ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	I don't think he's going to go to sleep while he's in charge of thirty of you.
*CLA:	Then   (        ) here you are just  (        ) 
*AMY:	Is he in charge?
*HEL:	He's in charge, yes.He's Head Master.
*AMY:	What comes if someone's ill? (.) I suppose there are bound to be a couple of people. (.) 
*HEL:	I don't know. (.) Maybe if you really are they'll send you home.
*AMY:	On your own?
*HEL:	No.One of the staff would have to come with you.Not that   (        ) one of the   (.) that couple.
*AMY:	Yeah
*HEL:	You can't ring the doctors on the Isle of White. (.) 
*AMY:	Oh if you have been really ill  (        ) 
*HEL:	I should think the one's whose most vulnerable is Clare Montgomery.She's just had her operation. (.) 
*AMY:	I'm surprised she's still going on it so soon after.She gets a cough.If by any chance she catches it off me she's going to have a really sore throat isn't she?
*HEL:	I think she wants to go.I don't think anybody wants to be left behind. (.) 
*CLA:	 (        ) take more crisps.
*HEL:	No I think you've had enough.
*CLA:	Oh I've only had a few.I didn't have many did I?
*HEL:	No.Don't know really. (.) 
*AMY:	I'm quite looking forward to it.You know er you get your packet money each day and you can buy things.But I'm not over keen on nuts.
*HEL:	Good fun .I think if Mr. Statton says you'll be so tired   (.) would you like to go and get your reading book and get a hanky and  (        ) 
*AMY:	You get prizes afterwards so that er one had the best kept room and another one
*CLA:	Can you get a hanky?
*HEL:	Where have you come?

*CLA:	There isn't any?
*HEL:	Aren't there?
*CLA:	No.
*HEL:	Is the box not in there or is the box empty?
*CLA:	The box is empty.
*HEL:	Is it? (.) Hmm hmm.I'd better get another box.I'd better get some from Boots then I think.
