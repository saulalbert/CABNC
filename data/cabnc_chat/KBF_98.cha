*LEE:	 (  ) 
*BRE:	Tracey said that she's just gonna be one of these   (.) the judge either likes you or he don't like you. And like I said to her it's like James.  (.) He'll go in for his maths, won't study, go in for his maths and get an A. You'll study like mad   (.) revise like mad and come out with a C. 
*LEE:	If I'm lucky. 
*BRE:	If you're lucky. And like she said   (.) two   (  ) and Jennifer's walked in there and they're halfway there already cos they liked the look of them. 
*LEE:	They're just like   (.) James. They'll go into that exam without doing, alright they   (.) dance the same as you 
*BRE:	They haven't practised or anything but they don't need to. They just go in there and they come out with it. But they'll come unstuck later on. 
*LEE:	His family   (.) it's like dad   (.) if he wants to better himself at running   (.) he's not a natural at it. He's gotta work at it. 
*BRE:	We all have. 
*LEE:	His family, everyone in it, we have to work at what we do.
