        They went to Bromley High. •206826_207059•
        Catherine was actually a year lower than Suzannah. •207143_207434•

        I bet Lynda's in for a lark for the next year. •214452_214661•
        She's  round the corner when Raymond . •214705_214867•
        And then she'll come home some days and discover the place chockablock with students or three birds in bed with him or something. •214880_215962•
