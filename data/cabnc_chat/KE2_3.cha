*TER:	This is the long one, this is the five thousand •_•
*MAR:	It says here on the six o'clock Olympics today  including live coverage of Wilf Riley's attempt to win the gold for Britain in the mens thousand short practice speed skating final  it's six o'clock  •_•
*TER:	Yeah that's the final he's got three, they've got two, I think they've got two of each before that actually  and that's the wide lane that's two lanes so that's the erm, when they do the long one  •_•
*MAR:	Looks as if somebody was sort of passed over to the other •_•
*TER:	Yeah they do they cross over from outside  •_•
*MAR:	Any lane  •_•
*TER:	to inside •_•
*MAR:	I thought it were relay •_•
*TER:	Oh was it? •_•
*MAR:	That's what I thought because he's on the, he's by himself isn't he? •_•
*TER:	Well if they've separated you see you get one on the inside track, one on the outside track and they can be separated by a hundred metres so that there's one, one side one  •_•
*MAR:	No you can see  •_•
*TER:	there's usually two racing together in this one, but they're in separate tracks and one starts at the outside track  •_•
*MAR:	This is the end track  •_•
*TER:	crosses to the inside track and vice versa there the other straight where they change over I think  oh it's finished anyway  mm •_•
