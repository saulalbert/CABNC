*PS05X:	I was rather irritated yesterday because I had a phone call from . 
*PS102:	Yes . 
*PS05X:	And he called Gary saying we do n't have the P elevens And I I said oh well that 's fair enough so I dug them out and sent them to him And after I 'd stamped and sealed the envelopes he rang back he said I have n't got the copy vat certs either I was not pleased at that And I would n't have occurred to me to send the P elevens . 
*PS102:	Actually that 's not true either because I sent the P elevens to Steve and Matthew for his approval before we sent them off . 
*PS05X:	And he sent them back again . 
*PS102:	Erm I do n't know whether he sent them back I sent I did n't send him the originals I sent a copy . 
*PS05X:	Oh right . 
*PS102:	I doubt that he sent them back . 
*PS05X:	Oh well I I 've sent the ones from the drawer . 
*PS102:	Fine . 
*PS05X:	off and said I want them back . 
*PS102:	Oh right . 
*PS05X:	And he said fine . 
*PS102:	We have n't got copies of them . 
*PS05X:	No That that well you know if there 's a query in the next fortnight we know where they are do n't we But I was annoyed and I thought well that 's fair enough because I was n't aware that those particular documents were required by the accountants to sort things out but . 
*PS102:	Why were they required . 
*PS05X:	I do n't know I did n't ask him but he said he required them But I know that copy vat certs the vat certs vat payment return returns that 's what they 're called are n't they are required And so we had n't sent them . 
*PS102:	Oh . 
*PS05X:	Down to our that is . 
*PS102:	Well where were they . 
*PS05X:	Well they 're here in the drawer where they 're kept There 's there 's a vat file in there and that 's where they get put Bit silly is n't it This is a unhelpful because it 's winding that way yet it looks as if it 's winding that way does n't it . 
*PS102:	What onto the spool here . 
*PS05X:	It looks as if it 's reeling on to that spool . 
*PS102:	Yes But it 's reeling onto that one . 
*PS05X:	It 's not it 's reeling through there Very confusing and the fact that they 've stuck that label on there does n't help very much either . 
*PS102:	No so when it 's full you have to put another tape in does it . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS102:	click or does it . 
*PS05X:	I do n't know I thought it would actually reversed on the first side Erm . 
*PS102:	And do the other side . 
*PS05X:	Yes and I thought it was mucking it up so I just swapped it over the way it was Erm we shall see We shall see . 
*PS102:	It does n't tell you . 
*PS05X:	Well it it tells you quite a lot but it does n't actually mention that bit I 've got I have got oodles of instructions here .
