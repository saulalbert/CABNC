*BRE:	Erm  and she said also I think she wants to ask you something  and  you know  she asked you before and you've taken no notice! •757245_765535•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •765755_766565•
*BRE:	And  and he said well  do you think I ought to give her, you know, what about two pound a week? •766945_771205•
*JEA:	Ah! •771565_771595•
*BRE:	And she said well look  all I'm, all I'm  •772295_774195•
*JEA:	Brenda! •774195_774425•
*BRE:	saying is that, all I'm is erm  why don't you erm  don't think of the money because how valuable is she to you? •774425_783485•
*JEA:	Quite  quite. •784385_784945•
*BRE:	And it it really shook him up and she turned round and said  he turned round and said, very valuable. •785035_789455•
*JEA:	Mm, of course. •789595_789835•
*BRE:	And he said well happens, she said what happened if she  walked out  tomorrow? •790175_793795•
        He said I could never replace her  he said nobody is to  she is  he said I just couldn't, he said I'd  you know, I'd pay what I'd have to •793795_802325•
*JEA:	Yeah. •802625_802775•
*BRE:	he said we'll be realistic •802775_804085•
*JEA:	Mm. •805115_805175•
*BRE:	he said, you know  fifteen pounds a week, and I said to him  what about the petrol? •805175_809655•
        I said, you know, it's costing fifteen pound a week in , a least and you're you're paying ten  and he said, no he said, he said I think that's ample, he said. •809655_818445•
*JEA:	It isn't  because I keep on going down and filling up the metro with ten pounds worth of petrol and I'm not making a  a trip back and forth to work every day. •819075_829305•
*BRE:	Go on, I put that in on Wednesday and I've got to about a quarter of a tank again. •829305_832545•
*JEA:	Mm. •832665_832725•
*BRE:	So it'll be  •832725_833145•
*JEA:	Mm. •833145_833495•
*BRE:	tomorrow  I put it in . •833495_833895•
*JEA:	And it's an automatic, isn't it? •833895_835225•
        They use it up. •835225_836165•
*BRE:	They use a lot yeah  the I put it in my  I mean, I said yesterday to him, we've got the decorators in  and then they turned round and said  he is meant to be a businessman and they said  he cannot believe  they've never met such a penny pinching guy •836165_849735•
*JEA:	Mm. •851425_851515•
*BRE:	in all our life! •851675_852655•
*JEA:	Mm  yeah  yeah. •852655_853535•
*BRE:	They come in, he said somebody with a house like this, the money you've got, the cars that  got •853535_857735•
*JEA:	Mm, mm. •857985_858205•
*BRE:	and he turned round penny pinching, saying that  you know, why has this cost me thirty quid, why can't I  •858205_862895•
*JEA:	Ooh! •862895_863025•
*BRE:	get it for twenty? •863025_864065•
*JEA:	Oh yes, yes  •864205_865585•
*BRE:	They nearly walked out last week! •865585_867275•
*JEA:	Mm. •867765_867865•
*BRE:	They just honestly couldn't believe that  •867865_869165•
*JEA:	Yeah. •869165_869395•
*BRE:	somebody could be like that. •869435_870345•
*JEA:	But some people are appallingly mean  did I tell you about that Ned  being done out of six hundred pounds by an indian doctor and a her husband? •870345_878185•
*BRE:	No. •879525_879635•
*JEA:	He put in a kitchen  and he thought there was something funny about these people  erm  they didn't want to give him money up front for  the fabric, you know, the woods and things and he wasn't asking the full amount anyway  and  he said, you know, a  things are very tight in business and I do not want to run up any more debts  if you will let me have  some of  cash, some of the cash for the wood  as soon as the wood's delivered I'll come and do the job, it's not as though your money is going to be  tied up in any way  and there was a bit of a face pulling  and saw this woman drop to, sort of, always hovering around  always putting her motty in  and erm  when when the job was nearly completed  madam steps forward with the cries of  that isn't quite right and that isn't quite right and Nev was putting hours doing  nit-picking  fussing about getting things  absolutely perfect  got it absolutely perfect but when it came to the final bill  they knocked off six hundred because there was the tiniest little scratch  on one of the panels! •879635_954565•
*BRE:	Oh    he couldn't do anything about it? •955385_958295•
*JEA:	No it was it was fixed in. •958295_959385•
*BRE:	Perhaps  they're fiddling  •961495_963465•
*JEA:	Ah. •963555_963715•
*BRE:	a bit. •963715_•
*JEA:	Yes. •963835_963925•
*BRE:	That's one way to put it, anyway  and he said that  and he said he lost out on six hundred pounds? •963925_970095•
*JEA:	Six hundred yes. •970095_970825•
*BRE:	Did he not, sort of, think to take them to court? •971795_973315•
        I suppose it would have cost him more in court fees! •973315_974925•
*JEA:	Well I think he can  go through the small claims court for  five hundred  but I suppose six hundred was just over, it's probably something very crafty that they thought up between them, this pair! •974925_987265•
*BRE:	It's awful isn't it? •989405_990425•
*JEA:	Tis awful  I was taught as a child in catechism  the labourer is worthy of his hire  there are four sins that cry out to heaven for justice  one of them is a oppressing the widow and orphan and the other  is defrauding the labourer of his hire  because the labourer is worthy of his hire  that's a sin that  cries to heaven for justice, that's what I was taught as a child. •990425_101743•
*BRE:	I bet he was really, sort of angry? •101795_101953•
*JEA:	Oh they were, they felt sick! •101953_102108•
*BRE:	But the er it's does he still see them or? •102229_102489•
*JEA:	Oh no, I mean these were clients and they could never be friends after doing that  I've come to the conclusion you can either keep your money or you can keep your friends, but you're not going to do both. •102489_103526•
*BRE:	No. •103542_103548•
*JEA:	In life. •103671_103716•
*BRE:	Right, shall we make tracks? •103800_103911•
*JEA:	Yep. •103911_103931•
