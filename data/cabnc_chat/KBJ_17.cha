        Er  four times three equal twelve. •219073_219297•
        Er, two additions left. •219297_219389•
        Alright. •219389_219439•
*EMM:	Those two add? •219439_219510•

        You told us this! •226385_226492•
*CHR:	But , like these, these are equations. •226494_226642•
        So  two addition equations  er  three times seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one. •226919_227800•
        Right? •227904_227913•
        Oh! •227913_227920•

*CHR:	Right, she wants currency in two divisions  in each, right? •231060_231436•
        So it's  one, two, three, four, •231436_231620•
*EMM:	That multiplication is a  •231631_231713•
*CHR:	yeah well divisions, okay, so it's twenty one shared by  say, if that's one, two, three, four, five, six int it? •231713_232784•

        Six. •234085_234097•
*CHR:	And division is shared by. •234283_234453•
        So you got to do eighteen shared by  six is three  and eighteen •234623_235197•
*EMM:	Have you got •235197_235235•
*CHR:	shared by three is six. •235235_235434•

        That's what I don't get. •239640_239976•
        Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I don't get how you do that? •239985_240496•
        Is it, would you like us to put •240613_241783•
*CHR:	It's fours int it? •241796_241897•
