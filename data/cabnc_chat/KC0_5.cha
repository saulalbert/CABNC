*ENI:	Oh!It's sad isn't it?It really is, it's sad!
*STA:	I don't know, he come, he said to me   (.) er we we well he come over, you see when I come home from hospital he sa , he had to report   (        ) to come and see me   (.) he was a long while before he did come!But er, he he hopped on one day and er   (.) had a talk with him and so on and   (.) took my temperature and pulse and that, this, that and other, he said well   (.)

*ENI:	I mean, it doesn't stop him from going shooting and fishing does it?
*STA:	Oh no!
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*STA:	No, no, that's the thing.I think he's a little bit envious because   (.) er, I took those meadows back, you see.
*ENI:	Possibly , yes.
*STA:	Cos he used to go shooting there and   (        ) and they went in there and they shouldn't of done because Michael told them I'd taken meadows back   (.) and he sa , he said when Tony  told them, they, they'd been there shooting he said well they're, they're out of bounds!
*ENI:	Mm.Mm.

*ENI:	Yes.Yes, that's 
*STA:	Oh yes!
*ENI:	true
*STA:	But they,th th th they just walk on, they don't have to pay anything 
*ENI:	No.
*STA:	 (        ) !
*ENI:	No! [laughing] No  [] !
*STA:	Walk over you!
*ENI:	Well they just think they're in a privileged position Stanley!

*STA:	Jackie said, well ring them,sh he should know something about it!
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	And that don't take a week, week to test anything like that!

*STA:	There's a   (.) no, I don't think he's too obliged as he should be!
*ENI:	No, he's not a, I don't think he's as a as some

*ENI:	Erm, the first time I met him was when he was doing a very tricky   (.) stitching job, I took Mollie up
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	because she'd cut her leg
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	and er   (.) I took her up there   (.) and her si , skin is like tissue paper

*ENI:	I don't know how that man   (.) managed to get the two edges to meet   (.) but he did a wonderful job on it!And he was so nice to her when he was doing it.
*STA:	Yes, he's a nice person of
*ENI:	You're very nice!
*STA:	then Mrs erm   (.) er,, you know, who had the mu  (.)  (        ) 
*ENI:	Oh yes!

*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	you see, to the main surgery.
*STA:	Well of course when  is out, they they give you the the  's number
*ENI:	That's right.
*STA:	in fact, one time when they was out   (.) they give me a number, I go , and I got !
*ENI:	Oh yes!Yes.
*STA:	Well   (.) and I had er er erm erm   (.) what's the name?Ha!What do you call them, (        ) ?
*ENI:	A tummy upset?
*STA:	No!Skin!
*ENI:	Oh, not erm   (.) shingles?
*STA:	Shingles, I had a touch 
*ENI:	Oh!
*STA:	of shingles.
*ENI:	Gosh!Mm.
*STA:	And I said to him, he said what's the matter?And I told him, I said I've got shingles   (.) so I said well I got them   (.) he said and   (.) red round the stomach.Ha, ha, ha, he said!I thought to myself, not so much of the ha, ha, ha!That's what he's li , er, wasn't a way to tell nobody was it?
*ENI:	No, it wasn't.You see, that's another one.
*STA:	He didn't feel it did he?
*ENI:	No, he didn't feel, absolutely 
*STA:	No!
*ENI:	Stanley!No, that's not 
*STA:	I thought to myself, who's this then?That's something I don't sa , not so matter that I could have told him!
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	That isn't a way to get through to people!
*ENI:	No it isn't!No it's not.
*STA:	Cos after all, we don't go private but we're paying!
*ENI:	Tha abs 
*STA:	And I've payed for years and years for myself and four other people besides!
*ENI:	Mm.Mm.
*STA:	No, some 
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	of them get too   (.) snooty in a way.
*ENI:	Yes , they get, they're a bit less committed.I think the 
*STA:	And, as you say with , well if he can go fishing and shooting, I don't know about that, they take priority!
*ENI:	Yes.Yes, that's true.Mhm.There's another very nice one there, he's the latest to have come   (.) erm   (.) 
*STA:	.What in 
*ENI:	oh and he's just 
*STA:	at Framlingham?
*ENI:	Yes.And he's very young, he's i , I met him   (.) twice, when I was with people who   (.) were dying
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	and erm   (.) in fact, yes, but both of just had died and we sent for   (.) the doctor and it's
*STA:	Aha.
*ENI:	it was he who came   (.) and erm   (.) he was absolutely marvellous!I thought his manner was   (.) just right.
*STA:	Makes all the difference doesn't it?
*ENI:	Oh yes!It does make a lot of 
*STA:	I mean 
*ENI:	difference, yes 
*STA:	a person like that   (.) can help another person to get well can't they?
*ENI:	They can!They can.I mean,th there is something to be said for the manner towards you isn't there?
*STA:	Ooh yes!
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	Yes!
*ENI:	That's true.
*STA:	I mean, when you look forward to seeing the doctor and one thing and another, and saying, have a conversation with them, that's a different story innit?
*ENI:	That's true.
*STA:	And buck you up a bit.
*ENI:	Oh absolutely!
*STA:	That's something you 
*ENI:	Absolutely!Yes!
*STA:	if you think to yourself well if I can have a   (.) a quarter of an hour's chat with him, that'd be worth something.
*ENI:	That's right.That's true.
*STA:	Yes.I don't know why some of them get like that, well of course they shouldn't be doctors any how.And tha tha th th a doctor should have a nice personality!
*ENI:	He should.I think in some cases, Stanley, not only in the me , medical profession   (.) the more people are paid   (.) the less committed they seem to be to the job!
*STA:	Yes, they do, they get independent!
*ENI:	Yes.They begin to feel that the job is there so that they can earn a living, rather than that they are doing the job itself!
*STA:	That's right , yes.Yes.
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	Th th er theirselves, they take priority not the patient!
*ENI:	That's what I feel.Yes.
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	I'm sorry about it because   (.) you know, how I feel about the   (.) medical profession and the nursing 
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	profession.
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	Ye , I mean I'm passionately keen!But erm   (.) I I think some of them let us down a bit.Mm.
*STA:	Yes.Well there you are, I don't know whether it's wrong.Course, they drop onto you any old time if they come but if they can't 
*ENI:	Oh yes, if they want to come it doesn't matter if it's convenient to you or not   [laughing] does it  [] !
*STA:	Not a bit of it!Not a bit of it!Oh no 
*ENI:	That's true.
*STA:	not a bit of it.
*ENI:	That's true.
*STA:	Well I mean after all they want er an appointment!
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	But you don't get no appointment!
*ENI:	That's right, you don't.
*STA:	Oh no!You see 
*ENI:	That's true.
*STA:	you take second place, definitely!
*ENI:	Yes.I'm sorry 
*STA:	Well 
*ENI:	it is true with some 
*STA:	I mean, after all 
*ENI:	of them.
*STA:	you're, we're their customers!
*ENI:	Ah, that's right!
*STA:	That's their living innit?
*ENI:	That's right.
*STA:	Withou , they need er er anyone like ourselves, well, er er they'd have nothing to do!
*ENI:	That's right.Absolutely!
*STA:	 (        ) 
*ENI:	And of course they're not so hard pressed as people are in these big cities!
*STA:	Oh no!
*ENI:	You know, they have a nicer time of it here altogether don't they?
*STA:	Oh undoubtedly!Undoubtedly!
*ENI:	Yes.They do.
*STA:	Because, I mean, there you are, look, I mean   (.) for argument's sake, now , well they have e e every Tuesday off or some Monday or Tuesday off don't he?
*ENI:	Mhm.He does.
*STA:	The same as that Doctor  used to come down and er
*ENI:	Oh yes!
*STA:	for him.
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	He was quite a nice fellow!
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	So far.
*ENI:	Yes, he's in   (.) Debenham now.
*STA:	Debenham, yes.
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	He lived on the green didn't he, (        ) ?
*ENI:	He did.
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	Do he live at Debenham now?
*ENI:	Er, I think he does live at Debenham.Yes.
*STA:	He  (        ) , yeah.
*ENI:	I know he operates from there anyway.
*STA:	Yeah.Right.
*ENI:	Mm.Yes.
*STA:	But then I mean    (.) come and saw me once, you see, when I wasn't there like that and   (.) he he tested from top to bottom, he said well   (.) ar ar after we sit and talked, and like he said well I better give you the once over, I said th er, certainly.And so he he tested and such like and   (.) he shook his head and he said well   (.) I don't know, I can't find anything wrong with you.
*ENI:	No.
*STA:	And he said you're a better man than I am!
*ENI:	Really?
*STA:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Aha.Yes.
*STA:	And that's what  said, and that's what
*ENI:	That's what the hospital said!
*STA:	Yes!
*ENI:	Remember?
*STA:	Yes!And that is what er Doctor  said!
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	And !
*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	I've had four doctors tell me I'm a better man than them!
*ENI:	Well you wouldn't be ninety five if you were weakling would you Stanley?
*STA:	No I don't suppose so.
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*STA:	I don't suppose so.Poor old Doctor , he said you'll never wear your heart out.
*ENI:	Really?
*STA:	He said, whereas an ordinary man live till they're   (.) seventy   (.) you'll live till you're ninety!
*ENI:	Fancy!He knew, you see.

*STA:	And they don't often speak like that of one another.
*ENI:	No, they don't often refer to one another do they?
*STA:	No they don't, that's right.
*ENI:	You see it's not thought to be the thing 
*STA:	That's right.

*ENI:	 [laughing] Right  [] .
*STA:	And he never said no more.
*ENI:	That's right.

*STA:	I opened it.
*ENI:	They do, oh!Th , oh for me did you?
*STA:	Yes.
*ENI:	Ah, that's sweet of you!So when I go   (.) you'd like me to shut it probably would you?
*STA:	Well i i if you don't mind?If not 
*ENI:	 (        ) 
*STA:	I can shut it.
*ENI:	Oh no!Well it doesn't take me a minute.I just wondered whether it was because the erm   (.) men with the red van at the gate there 
*STA:	Oh no no the 
*ENI:	are doing something here.
*STA:	No, (        ) no!Cos I 
*ENI:	They're working are they?
*STA:	I knew you were coming and so I went and opened the gate.
*ENI:	Ah, so you did.That's sweet of you!
*STA:	I thought    (        )  (        ) 
*ENI:	That's kind!Stanley I do not

*ENI:	erm   (.) yeah?
*STA:	Pardon?That take all sorts to make a world you know.

*STA:	now like this.Well George  come the other day, now he's a working fellow!
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	He's got a little sense!
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	He earned a lot of money   (.) and he save it, he then bought a British car.
*ENI:	Mm, yes.
*STA:	He paid for it!
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	That's the sor  (.) he say, nobody need go short today!
*ENI:	That's true.Mm.
*STA:	Other people   (.) what do they do?They take the money   (.) they go and buy videos, they buy records, they go and   (.) bu ba for fo football and all si 
*ENI:	Mhm.
*STA:	they spend the money in the wrong direction!There's no return!
*ENI:	No.That's right Stanley.
*STA:	And then they 
*ENI:	It's 
*STA:	say they're short!
*ENI:	Yes.That's what you've been saying all the time this sort of bank lending's been going on haven't you?
*STA:	Yes!
*ENI:	Mm.
*STA:	Yes!
*ENI:	It's madness really!
*STA:	Ooh yes!And then 
*ENI:	Mhm.
*STA:	th a th th I mean th , all these repossessed houses   (.) they're lived far beyond their end zone!
*ENI:	Yes , they do.
*STA:	They're ordinary working people, they wanna be independent gentlemen!
*ENI:	That's right.
*STA:	And the banks and building societies have encouraged them!
*ENI:	They have, I'm afraid, they have!
*STA:	Pushed the money onto them!
*ENI:	And now of course they're paying the price too because 
*STA:	Course!
*ENI:	they're in a mess!
*STA:	It's their own fault!
*ENI:	Absolutely!
*STA:	As you make your bed you lie on it!
*ENI:	That's right.
*STA:	That's as simple as that!After all said and done, people live 
*ENI:	It is really.
*STA:	far beyond their income   (.) and when they get the money they spend it in the wrong direction
*ENI:	That's right, because they haven't 
*STA:	haven't they?
*ENI:	had to work so hard for it perhaps, you see.
*STA:	No!
*ENI:	They've borrowed 
*STA:	You see 
*ENI:	it instead.
*STA:	you see   (.) go to a football match, or buying some   (.) er electrical appliance   (.) appeal to them far more   (.) than paying the rent!
*ENI:	Yes, that's right.But a lot of people 
*STA:	They don't pay the rent, no, ah ra , the tax payers have to make that up!
*ENI:	That's true in many cases   (.) that's true.
*STA:	They've got swelled heads, people have!
*ENI:	Yes , they have Stanley.It's very foolish!
*STA:	I wonder if anybody would know   (.) that what happened here   (.) ah er er   (.) two or three year ago was a   (.) up till re recently   (.) they know very well that couldn't last!
*ENI:	Couldn't last, could it?
*STA:	Couldn't last!I know, (        ) 
*ENI:	It wasn't reality.
*STA:	went and borrowed an eighty thousand pound and bought a house
*ENI:	That's right.Mhm.
*STA:	well, he had to scrape to pay the rent at all!Then, on the other hand he had to go short indoors, well then when the   (.) I er th th ,th er the interest went up, cos he  (        ) !
*ENI:	They don't work out how much they're paying for their money 
*STA:	No, they don't!
*ENI:	do they?No.
*STA:	They go to silly people like 
*ENI:	It is really!
*STA:	that!
*ENI:	Is really.
*STA:	And the first thing they do th they go to the wo er er bo the boss of the firm where they work for   (.) and want more money!
*ENI:	That's right.They can't manage.
*STA:	We couldn't do that!What do you 
*ENI:	Mhm.
*STA:	think we are!
*ENI:	 [laughing] Yes  [] .
*STA:	They, and and they they've they've on the ba ba had their unions run the blessed country!
*ENI:	Well they did.Certainly, they did.
*STA:	I sa 
*ENI:	And they will again, Stanley!
*STA:	I said
*ENI:	If we get the wrong people in.
*STA:	that   (        ) Jackie will tell you the same, I told her mother anything from thirty to forty years ago   (.) I said, that don't matter some toss what political power they get in power you'll find the unions will run the country

*ENI:	Yes.
*STA:	They demand things!

*ENI:	That's right.
*STA:	Well
*ENI:	Mhm.
*STA:	all that money that they keep demanding from the   (.) er th wa th wa the firms and such like that   (.) ought to have been ploughed back into the firm!
*ENI:	That's right.That's right Stanley.
*STA:	If they robbed the firm, they're robbing themselves!
*ENI:	Yes, and then they are.
*STA:	Anthony  said years ago, when the rail ma men went on strike   (.) why do it?You'll only bring misery and distress on your own country!
*ENI:	Absolutely!
*STA:	And that's as true today!
*ENI:	Yes.It is!
*STA:	But they can't see it!All of them around   (.) they kill the goose that laid the golden egg.
*ENI:	Well that's the trouble, they do!Yes.
*STA:	Yes, but then 
*ENI:	They do.
*STA:	these firms are gonna pack up!
*ENI:	Exactly!Exactly, and then they lose the lot then don't they?
