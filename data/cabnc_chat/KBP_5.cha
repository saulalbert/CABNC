@Comment:	conversation #5 (Tape 026506)
*CLA:	It's not too bad finding   ((cough)) where you want to go
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	when it comes to looking for x-ray or path lab or whatever it is   (.) but finding your way out. (.) Very seldom they have continuing   (.) er continuity   ((cough)) of markers saying exit, you know, or this way out.
*NIN:	Wouldn't it, it's stupid that 
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	isn't it?You can't get out quick enough can you, usually?
*CLA:	Not short on the emergency exit signs, but yeah exactly.Mm. (.) I mean   (        ) once you've got in.But once you've gone down and turned left then turned right and gone ahead   (        ) 
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	It's like a labyrinth   [laughing] you know  [] .
*NIN:	I know.Certainly if you've not been before.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.Exactly. (.) I asked somebody the way out   [laughing] and she offered to show me  [] .Mm.
*NIN:	Oh!
*CLA:	Oh yeah, cleaner, mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Well Carolyn, when Carolyn was working at Witham Withamshaw 
*CLA:	Mm?
*NIN:	she said it was very lonely at night when you were walking down the corridors.
*CLA:	Yes I remember you saying.Oh it would be of course, yeah. (.) Mm oh it would be.It's quite a, it seems at least quite a pleasant hospital.Quite a pleasant atmosphere.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	I shouldn't imagine they have the problems that they do at erm Withamshaw and   (        ) 
*CLA:	 (        ) oh   (        ) no, they won't of course.Oh no.
*NIN:	And do you remember the  (.) 
*CLA:	What?
*NIN:	when Carolyn was working there they had this intruder.
*CLA:	Well they're often having intruders, (        ) go on  (.) 
*NIN:	I can't remember all the details.There was quite a to-do about it in the paper.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	I, I know Carolyn said that they   (.) in the end
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	they refused to work on their own
*CLA:	Oh that's right I remember.Yes yes.Yeah.
*NIN:	because they were so way out.There was no way
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	that they could have summoned help or anything else.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm. (.) And di didn't she have to leave  (        ) ?
*NIN:	Pardon?
*CLA:	Didn't she ha well, to get from A to B   (.) didn't she have to leave the building somewhere?
*NIN:	Yes.Yeah.
*CLA:	Yeah I thought so.Mm. (.) They're not too bad here but at Witham Withamshaw it'd be a    (.)  [laughing] different kettle of fish altogether  [] .
*NIN:	Er yes.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) Mm.
*NIN:	Mm because   (.) do you remember when we had to go and collect her?That night.
*CLA:	Yeah.Erm   (.) hang on.
*NIN:	It was very, there's some very lonely lanes there.
*CLA:	I remember going late at night.Were we collecting her?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Were we really?Mm.
*NIN:	 (        ) she was in the flat.
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*NIN:	And she'd passed out in the phone box. (.) 
*CLA:	I remember that happening but  (.) 
*NIN:	And that's when we went to collect her there.
*CLA:	And that was Withamshaw?
*NIN:	That was Withamshaw yeah.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	Er sh yes they were in er where were they living?The flat then, they weren't   (.) they didn't have the house.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.You said. (.) 
*NIN:	And she'd only just gone to the end of the road to phone   (.) Ken was working away.
*CLA:	Oh yes, that's right.Mm.
*NIN:	Wasn't he?
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	And Nicky wanted to, it was only   (.) a cock's stride down the road.Andrew was in bed and she just whipped out so Nicky could say goodnight to her daddy.
*CLA:	 [laughing] Oh yes, that's right  [] .Mm.
*NIN:	Oh dear.What a performance. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) Mm. (.) Yes, you get so used to having a phone at home don't you?
*NIN:	Mm.It's very handy.Having to go to the end of the road, well it's daft now.That's if you can find one working.
*CLA:	Not too bad here from what I've seen.
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	No but I mean in Manchester it was shocking wasn't it?
*CLA:	Oh well! (.) It was a very pleasant surprise if there is one working. (.) Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	You know I was just thinking
*CLA:	Were you?Jolly good.
*NIN:	That well   (.) Lil and Nev going up on the mini break
*CLA:	W tomorrow is it they go?
*NIN:	Yeah Wednesday to Saturday, yes.
*CLA:	Mm go on.
*NIN:	I'll bet they hear of these mini breaks through the wh I can't remember 
*CLA:	She probably 
*NIN:	her name.
*CLA:	Was it Carol?No it's not Carol.
*NIN:	No.No it's
*CLA:	I don't know what her name is but   (.) I know the one you mean.The travel agency girl?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Young woman, yeah.
*NIN:	I wouldn't be surprised.
*CLA:	Probably.Mm. (.) Mm. (.) I'm wondering what   (.) made them change their mind   (.) over the er knock through into the garage.
*NIN:	Well I suppose they thought it was a bit too much.I mean the place they've got there, it er   (        ) it would mean 
*CLA:	Oh I'm not sugge 
*NIN:	that them decorating 
*CLA:	I know.
*NIN:	the whole lot again wouldn't it?
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	Oh no way.
*CLA:	Yes but surely they thought that through before they got to the stage that   (.) I mean even with the mortgage 
*NIN:	Well that's probably why they've decided against it.
*CLA:	No. (.) Before   ((cough)) they got to the stage of asking for quotes because Nev had moved all his tools and tackle and stuff   (.) to clear it.
*NIN:	Had they actu actu really had a quote?
*CLA:	I don't know.I really don't know.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	They were due to get one.Any time.
*NIN:	They might have had one and found out what   [laughing] it was going to cost and were decided against  [] .
*CLA:	Possibly.
*NIN:	They're having a mini break instead.
*CLA:	Oh possibly   (.) again i it's just possible actually that   (.) the construction of the bungalow didn't lend itself properly well to   (.) knocking through.
*NIN:	Well I think   (.) oh well it's so beautiful I mean as it is in there, they don't need anything doing to, I mean 
*CLA:	Well 
*NIN:	they've got it nice.They've got it   (.) so they don't get s sort of minimum   (.) you know?
*CLA:	Labour.
*NIN:	Yes.So I shouldn't imagine that erm   (.) I mean once we've got through this one I'm blowed if I'm going to do it 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	just for the sake of doing it. [laughing] It'll have to really need it before we start again  [] .
*CLA:	Well mm.Oh yeah I know.But they, they are a little bit inclined to what shall we spend some money on next, aren't they?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	 ((cough)) Mm.
*NIN:	Well if it's there fair do.
*CLA:	Oh!Fair do, I know but er   (.) it's up to them what they do with their money I know but   (.) mm. (.) 
*NIN:	What's happened to the rest of the paper Larry?There's only half of it there.
*CLA:	Well which paper  (        ) ?
*NIN:	The Telegraph.Last week's Telegraph.There's only one 
*CLA:	I haven't the faintest idea.
*NIN:	sheet there.Just one 
*CLA:	One sheet?
*NIN:	Well one   (.) section.
*CLA:	Oh. [laughing] I don't know  [] .I haven't the faintest idea.
*NIN:	It's just disappeared.
*CLA:	I haven't moved it at all.Not knowingly anyway. (.) No. (.) It's possible I've used it but I don't erm   (.) don't recall.Never had an occasion to use, well the only time I've used a newspaper as far as I know   (.) this afternoon when I emptied the bag.And that was
*NIN:	Because we were going to phone up
*CLA:	Yeah I know.
*NIN:	the piece at   (.) with the 
*CLA:	Yes.
*NIN:	housing in.
*CLA:	Yes for the er
*NIN:	We were going to phone up and that seems to have 
*CLA:	the two bungalows yeah.Mm.It is incidentally  (        ) .It's where I thought it was.
*NIN:	Is it?
*CLA:	On the left hand side   (        ) and erm   (.) it's   (.) pretty near the main road.
*NIN:	Mm.Oh I know where you mean.
*CLA:	Oh you do?
*NIN:	I think I do anyway.
*CLA:	The area  (        ) .
*NIN:	Mm.I thought it was on the main road?
*CLA:	It is on the main road.
*NIN:	Oh I see what you mean, the front's pretty near the main road?Would that bother them do you think, being so close to the main 
*CLA:	I don't know Nina.I haven't the faintest idea.
*NIN:	Cos it looks quite a decent   (.) reasonable bungalow.I wonder how much they want for it?
*CLA:	I d I could only glanced at it as I drove past cos the traffic was   (.) moving fairly quickly for the lights there you know.But 
*NIN:	Mm.I bet the layout's something similar to that one we saw   (.) further  (        ) .
*CLA:	Probably.There's not much of a difference between
*NIN:	No, it looks the same shape somehow doesn't it?
*CLA:	No.Mm, yeah yeah. (.)  ((cough))  (        ) fairly tight.
*NIN:	But that, they're, the one that
*CLA:	 ((cough)) Sorry, go on.
*NIN:	we went to er look at, four of them, in the middle of er the three.
*CLA:	Oh yeah.Where Whereabouts was that?
*NIN:	There was four   (.) four it was in the middle.The girl that works at the garage,sh next door to that.
*CLA:	Oh not a bungalow, a house you mean?Sorry, yeah.
*NIN:	A house.Well that one, I mean everybody said oh   (.) that's too near to the main road so if that was too near to the main road so will this one be.
*CLA:	Well did Carolyn say that?I can't remember.
*NIN:	No Dawn said.Neither can I.
*CLA:	Well Dawn thought it was.I certainly thought it was.But then 
*NIN:	I know.I didn't.
*CLA:	I don't like traffic noise.
*NIN:	It w yes it, I'd, it wouldn't have bothered me that.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	But it, I can quite see that it would bother some people.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	But it's not as if it's a main road like
*CLA:	Oh crikey, no.
*NIN:	 [laughing] in Manchester is it  [] ?
*CLA:	Oh no.No.
*NIN:	There you could complain but I, I wouldn't say you get that much traffic at night.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm. (.) Certainly not at night you won't get a lot, no.Erm
*NIN:	Well you wouldn't notice during the day.You don't notice the same.It's when everywhere's quiet.And you're trying to sleep.
*CLA:	Yes but it's noises you don't notice, if they're continuous then they become
*NIN:	That's right.True.
*CLA:	Yeah.Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Still  (.) 
*CLA:	I mean that's one of the beauties here wasn't it?It's so peaceful, so quiet.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	There's no noises to get used to really.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Apart from the birds and the bees and the
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	sycamore trees.
*NIN:	 [laughing] And Sambo   (        )  [] .
*CLA:	 [laughing] And Sambo flying around yeah  [] . (.) No he just crawled under the door   (.) sort of glare, (        ) glare at me and then scootled, shooted past, you know. ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	Why?
*CLA:	Shot I should say.
*NIN:	 [laughing] Shooted past  [] .
*CLA:	Shooted past.He shooted past as well as shot past. ((laugh)) Mm.
*NIN:	I wonder why?
*CLA:	I don't know because he he's never really been frightfully keen on me, that cat.
*NIN:	Maybe it's probably has a rough working idea it's you that put the fountain on today. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	I doubt that very   [laughing] much indeed.Get on  [] .No.No. (.) No I try   (        ) to him but you know but er 
*NIN:	He's lovely.
*CLA:	He's alright.He let me sort of tickle him and god knows what but er   (.) he's pretty wary for some reason. (.) It may well be of course that father  was a bit er   (.) all dog and no cat sort of person, you know?I dunno.
*NIN:	Mm.The they're both, they're all in lovely condition aren't they?Beautifully cared for.
*CLA:	Oh yes.No argument about that, yes.Good nick
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	and well fed and  (.) 
*NIN:	Yes.
*CLA:	Mm. ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	Mm. (.) Now we've decided not to do that little built up wall affair at the front
*CLA:	Hang on.Oh there, yes.Yeah.
*NIN:	it erm   (.) we won't need to be bothered quite so much about getting paving stones.Or stones, suitable stones to build will we?
*CLA:	Well we won't be needing so many that's for sure, no.I want some for the    (.)  [laughing] erection    []  (.) at the side of the pool there.
*NIN:	What? (.) Oh there.
*CLA:	To take the waterfall.Mm.It's only gotta match the existing er 
*NIN:	Well how many do you want?I mean don't you want to put it on bricks?
*CLA:	Not bricks as such, no.
*NIN:	 (        ) just  (.) 
*CLA:	Cut some of the paving stones
*NIN:	I see.
*CLA:	to roughly brick size
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	and use that.As I have done with that erm
*NIN:	Well how many will you need?
*CLA:	collection   (.) Pardon?
*NIN:	You won't need that many for there.
*CLA:	Not no no no no no.Not an awful lot, no.I can pad out with sto with er brick where it doesn't show.It'd look a bit odd with bricks though, I think.
*NIN:	Mm.True.
*CLA:	Oh yeah. (.) And then we want matching slabs really don't we?
*NIN:	Yes.That'd be nice actu to have erm something you could sit on there.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) Wonder what do they do with old gravestones when they've er
*NIN:	Ooh I hate to think.
*CLA:	when they've abandoned the graveyard.
*NIN:	Well they seem to be there for   (.) er you know when they did all that erm   (.) levelling at erm   (.) Southam Southam cemetery?
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	I wonder what they did with them then? (.) They just flattened it didn't they and and  (        ) .It's a bit much when you come 
*CLA:	Yes, they made it so it could be 
*NIN:	to think of somebody paying a fortune for a 
*CLA:	Yes.
*NIN:	gravestone and then they come along and flatten it.
*CLA:	Oh there must have been some sort of arrangement, I don't know.To, to cope with that though.
*NIN:	Well quite a few of them   (        ) 
*CLA:	Well bear in mind a lot of them were very old ones and there are
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	probably no nearest and dearest left surviving.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	True. (.) 
*CLA:	I seem to remember    (.)  (        ) papers   (.) about that. (.) Erm   (.) that removal or disposal or alteration of the   (.) any creation around the grave was erm   (.) can be done at the discretion of, of the
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	parks authority or whatever it is, yeah.
*NIN:	It was better really when they'd done it 
*CLA:	Parks and cemeteries, yeah.
*NIN:	wasn't it?It was much neater.
*CLA:	Oh yes.Both in   (.) far more pleasant to the eye
*NIN:	Oh yes.
*CLA:	far neater and er   (.) oh yeah. [laughing] They can get more bodies in too   (        )  [] .
*NIN:	Ooh!
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	Shall we change the subject? ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	No I   (.) ha! (        )  (.) No I just had a thought because there must be stacks of old grave gravestones around.Some of the marble they   (.) cracking    (        )  (.) cracking bit of, yeah I know.
*NIN:	No they   (.) yes they are.
*CLA:	Should be for the price they charge too. (.) Ridiculous   (        ) forking out a fortune.
*NIN:	I wonder how many   ((laugh)) I wonder how many people have now got them as hearths?Now this marble er this kind of marble hearths.
*CLA:	Yes you've got, yeah.Yeah that's a point.That's a point.
*NIN:	I don't like that thing we've got there. (        ) 
*CLA:	I think they're rather thicker than that, the damaged gravestone.
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm. (.) When you think of all the  (        ) .Go on.
*NIN:	Mind you it it's   (.) indestructible really isn't it?
*CLA:	Oh
*NIN:	Once you've got it down.
*CLA:	I wouldn't say indestructible, but I know what you mean, yeah.Yeah.Yeah very very longlasting, yeah.Depends on the quality of the marble too doesn't it?
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	Obviously. (.) No I was gonna say, when you think of all the money that's spent   (.) with these very elaborate   (.) er headstones   (.) erm creations showing   (.) angels looking down on them, plonking at their harps and god knows what.They look quite nice from one point of view   (        ) but er   (.) fifty seventy eighty hundred years later   (.) what the hell does it matter?You know?
*NIN:	Mhm well I suppose it does to some people. (.) We've got to decide what to do at our fireplace yet haven't we? (.) Ooh   (.) what a problem.
*CLA:	Well if we get some   [laughing] headstones it'll be different  [] .
*NIN:	If   (.) you know if you, pardon? ((laugh)) If you take
*CLA:	Cor.
*NIN:	the top off, the wooden part
*CLA:	Er yes.The mantelpiece?
*NIN:	Yes.
*CLA:	Yeah.
*NIN:	Do you think it'll   (.) it's sort of cut so that the er it fits on top of the brickwork?
*CLA:	That one is I'm pretty sure, yes.Yeah.
*NIN:	Do you think it'll look   (.) still look cock-eyed, the brickwork?
*CLA:	Yes.
*NIN:	Mm.Mind you it won't matter if we erm    (.)  (        ) will it?
*CLA:	Oh no that will   (.)  (        ) .
*NIN:	Fancy building, I mean that must have been done when, when the house was built.
*CLA:	No.No no, it's not original that.No.
*NIN:	 (        ) the original one then?
*CLA:	You can see where the original fire surround was.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	Look at the plaster work there behind it, above it.Mm. (.) And where's the hearth   (.) different hearth isn't it?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	Yes, that's right.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	I'll be glad when that's done.It's going to be a big job really.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) No I should imagine it's a typical sixties, late sixties erm   (.) well early sixties   (.) er tile surround, you know?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	It's not  ((cough)) 
*NIN:	When you look there's, there's   (.) really there's only this room
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) Go on.
*NIN:	to remove the paper.
*CLA:	Erm
*NIN:	Er the the the two rooms, like the big room   (.) and the bathroom
*CLA:	And our bedroom.
*NIN:	Oh there's not much to move in 
*CLA:	There's in there, no.
*NIN:	in the be because I think 
*CLA:	Not, no.
*NIN:	the paper that's in the   (.) wardrobe alcoves?
*CLA:	Yes.
*NIN:	Well if that's firm it'll erm be washing over there won't it?
*CLA:	Lick over.Oh yes.Yes it's good enough there.
*NIN:	Well there's only the little bit on the breast of the er   (.) the chimney breast type of thing 
*CLA:	There's between the two   (.) yeah yeah.
*NIN:	that needs removing.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	And that was, that came off quite easily on the other wall.
*CLA:	Yeah. (        ) . Mm.
*NIN:	There's not that much to do so this is the main one really.And the bathroom   (.)  (        ) .Mm.
*CLA:	For wallpaper removal?Oh yes. ((cough))  (.) I need to see how those steamers work, how well they work.
*NIN:	Well, they must work fairly well because erm
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	well Joan and Clive were saying they did them.
*CLA:	Yes and Derek   (.) remember, next door?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	And Terry , he said  (        ) .He hadn't used one before, and he was a bit cackhanded.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	 [laughing] So they must have been pretty good  [] .
*NIN:	Mm. (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.Nice just to 
*NIN:	Carolyn was saying that a friend of theirs down the road   (.) she   (.) hired one
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	and finish   [laughing] she didn't know where to stop  [] .And she it was so quick.Yes it was very efficient.
*CLA:	You mean it was working so quick and easy?Yes.Yeah.Yeah.
*NIN:	And erm   (.) she was very impressed.
*CLA:	Oh. (.) Do you remember the old days when it was standard practice to put one   (.) paper on top of another?
*NIN:	Ooh!How many pa 
*CLA:	With the overlap.
*NIN:	I know.How many papers did we move 
*CLA:	You know? ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	off the er
*CLA:	Oh god I don't know.
*NIN:	the old  (        ) . [laughing] Oh about seven.Oh dear  [] .
*CLA:	Yes.Yes it probably was.Yeah.Mm.
*NIN:	What a job.It was a heck of a long way up there as well wasn't it?
*CLA:	Yeah.But do you remember the borders?The edges I should say at the, at the roll?
*NIN:	Mm.Yes.I do.
*CLA:	They used to have little marks to line the paper up when you hang it.
*NIN:	Oh?
*CLA:	Yeah.Down the 
*NIN:	Can't remember that.
*CLA:	Exactly.Down the edge
*NIN:	Mm?
*CLA:	the name of the manufacturer and possibly the   (.) say the model like the   (.) that particular paper's   (.) erm category   (.) name.But it had   (.) at about oh eighteen inch intervals, something like that?Little marks, sometimes an arrow   (.) sticking out.When you, when you put the next roll on you married up the arrow.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	Yeah.Mm.
*NIN:	I remember cutting out when you used to have to cut all down your rolls of wallpaper.
*CLA:	That's right.
*NIN:	And do you remember   [laughing] when you had to cut all your borders out  [] ?
*CLA:	Yeah but don't you remember when they had that erm   (.) erm   (.) semi-perforated edge on it?And you knocked it on the edge of a table?
*NIN:	Oh yes. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	Things have changed a bit.
*CLA:	Yes.I don't quite know why they put that edge on in the first place.
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	Unless it was, in those days, they didn't have the shrink wrap stuff did they?
*NIN:	I think they used to overlap them one edge didn't they?
*CLA:	Oh didn't th I was just thinking yeah.
*NIN:	That's right.
*CLA:	Oh it was standard to, yeah a standard practice job that, yeah.
*NIN:	To overlap.Well you could always see the join.
*CLA:	Oh yes of course.
*NIN:	And the joins they've put on this wallpaper here they stand out 
*CLA:	 [laughing] Oh god  [] .
*NIN:	about a mile don't they? ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Well this particular paper, you   (.) you've got to be very care 
*NIN:	I don't like it.
*CLA:	otherwise it crushes   (.) very easily.
*NIN:	Mm.I don't like it.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) No.It's not my favourite   (        ) by any means. (.) 
*NIN:	We'll have to go and be having a look at   (.) at erm
*CLA:	What?
*NIN:	choose a paper for the room where we're doing now.
*CLA:	Yes, there's a bit more plastering to be done yet.
*NIN:	Not a lot though is there?
*CLA:	Not a lot, no.I want to skim that corner, ceiling and the top of the wall. (.) Erm
*NIN:	And strip all the little   (        ) 
*CLA:	and   (        ) there's also there's a   (.) usual crack between the plasterboard and ceiling over the door and a little crack running down to the door.
*NIN:	Is there?
*CLA:	 (        ) yeah.It's worth doing.
*NIN:	Oh yes.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	And do it properly.Well   (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.Oh yes.And there's all the burning off and   (.) mm. ((cough))  (.) And also I want to, while the   (.) carpet's up, investigate the run of the cable.So it's 
*NIN:	And have you any idea yet? (.) 
*CLA:	About?
*NIN:	Where the cable runs?
*CLA:	Yes.Yeah, yeah. (.) I think it's a spur coming off   (.) that runs into the er   (.) But I don't think it's a proper imme immersion heater circuit.
*NIN:	You're joking?
*CLA:	Well it doesn't have to be.
*NIN:	Should it be?Oh.
*CLA:	No it doesn't have to be.No no no.No.No.
*NIN:	There's a   (.) a mark on the wall, you know where the switch is   (.) where you switch the pump on and off?
*CLA:	Er   (.) yes.
*NIN:	Well there's a mark on the wall.Something's been on the wall that was round.
*CLA:	Yes.That would be erm   (.) the junction box. (.) Mm.
*NIN:	Why would they need another junction box there then?Cos there's one down at the bottom.
*CLA:	To feed I s would suspect the immersion heater.Mm.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	Well what have they taken it off for then?Oh they wouldn't need, they wouldn't   (.) mm.
*CLA:	Because y you, when you have your cable up to the junction, hang on up to your junction box
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	and from the junction box to the actual immersion heater itself
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	you have erm   ((cough)) a heatproof cable called er systaflex I think it's called.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Yeah.Er   (.) it's sort of a white, braided stuff that goes over.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Heat resistant.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	So you'd need a junction box to erm connect the 
*NIN:	Well you know how they've   (.) you know where the pipe comes out of the   (.) cupboard?
*CLA:	Hang on.There are a lot of pipes.
*NIN:	No, the the pipe that I w I think   ((laugh)) supposedly leads to the radiator.
*CLA:	Erm
*NIN:	And it comes down under that little
*CLA:	do you mean the one with the pump in?
*NIN:	Yes.
*CLA:	Oh that pipe.Yeah, yeah.
*NIN:	By the wall, and it 
*CLA:	Oh.
*NIN:	comes into that little erm   (.) ooh the sort of semi   (.) skirting board thing.
*CLA:	Erm
*NIN:	That stands away from the wall. (.) 
*CLA:	offhand I can't say yes I do but 
*NIN:	Well it it's flat and then it comes down.You've got your skirting board
*CLA:	 [laughing] Flat and then it comes down  [] .
*NIN:	It houses   (.) pipes. (.) And it's 
*CLA:	Oh you you mean in the room?
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	Yes but I mean which pipe you mean, no.
*NIN:	Well I don't know the pipe.I haven't seen the pipe have I?
*CLA:	Oh it's in the   (.) oh sorry, go on.Carry on.
*NIN:	No.This thing   (.) but er er the pipe comes from the   (.) cupboard.You can see it 
*CLA:	If there's a pipe or pipes   (        ) cupboard yeah.
*NIN:	I dunno but it   (.) you can see it coming through
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	and it   (.) into that housing
*CLA:	Yeah.Yeah.
*NIN:	and then it comes right round to the radiator
*CLA:	Yes I know, yeah.
*NIN:	and goes right to that wall doesn't it?
*CLA:	Yes.Yeah yeah.Yeah.Yeah.
*NIN:	Well why would it need   (.) if that, if   (.) it does that, when it gets to the radiator
*CLA:	Oh it's not just for the radiator.
*NIN:	Oh.I see   (        ) 
*CLA:	It's the hot water to the tap in the kitchen.
*NIN:	Oh I see.
*CLA:	That's right, yeah.
*NIN:	As well.Well what I was looking at this afternoon   (.) was your radiator   (.) comes through the floor.And yet all these pipes are here.Why isn't   (.) why   (.) wouldn't they take erm   (.) your radiator pipe   (.) the water, the pipe that feeds the radiator?
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	Why wouldn't it come through   (.) that little housing?Instead of coming under the floor?
*CLA:	Well again that's not original is it? (.) The central heating   (.) system is er   (.) a later addition to the house isn't it?
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	And those pipes were where the circs where the, the   (.) where the pipe run to the hot water tap in the kitchen.And to the bathroom.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) And quite probably the cold water supply to the bathroom too. (.) Mm.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	And I think   (.) not the kitchen, that's on the rising main.Cos your stop tap is   (.) underneath the er
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	sink top there. (        ) . But that one there is er    (.)  ((cough)) fed, I'm pretty sure   (.) from   (.) the, yes it is. (.) Yeah because the pipe goes up there.Mm.
*NIN:	Oh yes of course.It goes right through to the bathroom doesn't it?That's it.
*CLA:	And, if you think about it, there's a header tank   (.) in the loft.
*NIN:	Yes.
*CLA:	 (        ) the cold water from somewhere.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	So it'll come from there   (.) across the ceiling
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	across the ceiling   (.) up through the erm   (.) cupboard
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	into the l into the loft and  (        ) .
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm.So   (        ) you'll have the hot water pipe   (.) to supply the hot tap
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	taps. (.) And the cold water feeds by the er header tank in the loft.
*NIN:	Mm.Well why wouldn't they take them underneath the floor? (.) They could of, couldn't they, up there? (.) 
*CLA:	Yes they certainly could.But at the time of building I think it was   (.) just continued practice from the victorian days to run it round on the top.Mm. (.) Pretty sure. (.) There has been, or appears to have been, a hole in the wall that's been plastered up rather badly but   (.) above that housing, that cover
*NIN:	Mm?
*CLA:	on the   (.) bathroom wall
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	the wall separating the bathroom from the spare room 
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	from the back bedroom   (.) in the bottom there's been a hole about the size of a pipe
*NIN:	Was there?
*CLA:	about three quarter pipe, yeah.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Or fifteen mil twenty two millimetres yeah. (.) Mm. (.)  ((whistling))  (.) 
*NIN:	I think I'll wash up and then have a cup of tea.
*CLA:	What a good  (.) 
*NIN:	What time is it?
*CLA:	 ((yawn)) time we had a   (.) wash up and a cup of tea I think.It's   (.) two and a half minutes to six o'clock.Or eighteen hundred. (.) Oh the news.Let's see if the queen's dead.
*NIN:	Pardon?
*CLA:	Where's the new oh is that the news?
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	See if the queen's dead.
