*MAR:	we shall go back, erm after Easter 
*BOB:	Yes 
*MAR:	hoping, permitting, you know, if it's not too expensive, it got very dear you know 
*BOB:	Yes, that is also  a thing to   
*MAR:	 Yeah   
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*BOB:	erm, I'm, I'm feeling a bit hard up at the moment, I had a   
*MAR:	 Yes   
*BOB:	a bill for repairing the car for two hundred and thirty pounds and   (.) so 
*MAR:	Oh, and everything comes at once, doesn't it? 
*BOB:	It does, yes   
*MAR:	 You know  , yes, that's what we find, and we've had water coming through the roof 
*BOB:	Mm 
*MAR:	when they put a new roof on I think they pinched the ledge round the chimney, er 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	and it comes through there so we've had a lot to do 
*BOB:	Yeah 
*MAR:	inside, there's always something isn't there? 
*BOB:	Yes 
*MAR:	And you're busy at 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	aren't you? 
*BOB:	 Yes   
*MAR:	 Yes   
*BOB:	Yes 
*MAR:	we'll have a meeting on Tuesday to decide whether we're going to have a 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	or not. 
*BOB:	Yes, well, as a matter of fact er, the moderator was talking to me on the telephone 
*MAR:	Aha 
*BOB:	I think it was yesterday 
*MAR:	yeah 
*BOB:	erm, he wants to come along and see you 
*MAR:	Yeah, aha 
*BOB:	erm, I, I don't think there's any question about you getting a minister 
*MAR:	Do you think we'll get one? 
*BOB:	Oh yes 
*MAR:	Oh 
*BOB:	erm, but er, you know,wh  whether it'll be a good thing to link up with somebody I don't know yet 
*MAR:	No 
*BOB:	that's one of the things he'll want to talk about 
*MAR:	Yes of course, er, you know this thing we've been talking about joining with the 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*BOB:	Yeah 
*MAR:	do you think that's going to come to anything? 
*BOB:	Well honestly I, I don't know because I haven't been in the  discussions   
*MAR:	 No   
*BOB:	before 
*MAR:	but, the ordinary, the congregation at St Jones hasn't 
*BOB:	Mm 
*MAR:	but erm, we've got friends in the Methodist church and they told us things that er, you know, absolutely 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	to us, er, whoever represents us doesn't come any of the bring anything back and you don't know 
*BOB:	Mm, well the thing is there's some similar conversation going on in 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	are there? 
*BOB:	but, er, I don't think they've got as far as yours have 
*MAR:	No, oh, I mean personally I think it would be better for the United Reformed to join up with the shared pastures instead of joining up with the Methodist because the Methodist have got plenty of churches in their area, haven't they? 
*BOB:	They have there, yes, and   
*MAR:	 Yes   
*BOB:	and the trouble is of course, they've, the Methodist haven't really joined up themselves 
*MAR:	No that's true Alan, no, aha, I know, aha, and they want to pay somebody a fee to do a service, how many service have we had done? ((laugh))  
*BOB:	Oh 
*MAR:	We enjoyed the moderator very much when you was a 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*BOB:	Good

*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	 Yes   
*BOB:	 That's  , that's at Hollywell 
*MAR:	Yes 
*BOB:	I expect somebody from St. Jones will be coached. How's Nigel these days? 
*MAR:	Well he's off sick as far as I know 
*BOB:	Mm 
*MAR:	but, I did hear something, I don't know whether it's true, that the doctors took him off the 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	because that, he wanted to go up for a medical which was a bit erm, unethical  ((laugh)) , but I don't know whether it's true it's, you know it's just what someone  said   
*BOB:	 Oh   
*MAR:	it was on good authority, but you know you got, the things get exaggerated 
*BOB:	Yes 
*MAR:	I haven't seen him, I, I think they were away at the weekend 
*BOB:	 aha   
*UNK:	  (  )   (  ) 
*MAR:	well he's, the last time I saw him was, was being having, was trying to have a lot of fund raising things 
*BOB:	 Mm   
*MAR:	 and er  , what's, what's the last one? Oh it was the Valentine's cover, it, it'll 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	and we'd all made different things, you know, and there was loads of food, but his children wanted one particular thing, well they were late coming in and of course it had gone, so he, he wasn't very happy  ((laugh))  
*BOB:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	and he didn't stay long and he didn't, he, he did look terrible, he did really 
*BOB:	Oh 
*MAR:	but, er, I don't see it, that kind of a job which he's going to do, if it don't have 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Hello 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*BOB:	Hello, hello 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	and, looks so ill, it's not very   ((laughing)) good for the  people he's looking after is it? 
*BOB:	No, oh well let's hope he'll get better 
*MAR:	Well I hope so, yes 
*BOB:	er, but I, I, I've heard that erm shingles does have this sort of after effect 
*MAR:	Yes, aha   
*BOB:	 but  you know, it takes a long while to get over it 
*MAR:	Yes 
*BOB:	but I hope he will  because   
*MAR:	 Oh, I  hope so 
*BOB:	I mean he's a young man and  he's   
*MAR:	 Yes   
*BOB:	done a good job I  think   
*MAR:	 Yes  oh yes, that's right
