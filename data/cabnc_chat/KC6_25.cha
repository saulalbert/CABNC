*GAV:	Yeah! •169956_170286•
        They're not going to interview anybody with you. •170426_172086•
*SUE:	Oh! •172616_172656•
        No, they might send me an application form back and then  I'll send it back to them  and they get an interview. •173306_181336•
        Seems a  when you're going for a bloody job! •184406_186966•
        You know, cos they're wanting another part-timer to do seventeen hours. •187356_189636•
*GAV:	Oh yeah. •189636_190316•
*SUE:	And men don't particularly want that. •190596_193126•
*GAV:	 (        ) 
*SUE:	Oh yeah. •193126_193456•
        I said somebody like a middle-aged woman would be best who's got grown up children at work  •194446_198016•
*GAV:	Yeah. •198016_198136•
*SUE:	and this, this guy came for it  and, obviously Lynn can't say, we don't want to take a man on it'll be  sex discrimination. •198136_204906•
*GAV:	Yeah. •205676_205846•
*SUE:	But it won't be suitable, I mean, one he's bloody crap! •206076_208956•
        And erm  , it's only seventeen hours, it's four hours a day  so that's why it would suit somebody who's married. •208956_216366•
*GAV:	Is he a nice bloke? •216376_219526•
*SUE:	No! •219556_219876•
        He's just stupid! •219956_221236•
        He's, he's already come in for one form  put it, he's obviously filled one form in, he came up and he said can I have an application form for that job in the window, so I gave him one  and he went, oh well I've just filled one in. •221546_232376•
        I thought  I thought, did he just say can I have  can I have an application form or here's an application form? •232426_238296•
        And I looked at him, and he went  , no I made a mistake on it. •238456_242386•
        So he , do you know where the two tills are downstairs do you? •242386_245056•
*GAV:	Yeah. •245256_245406•
*SUE:	They were on the erm  the main one we use  •245706_248256•
*GAV:	Yeah. •248256_248426•
*SUE:	just by the step in, he was stood, resting on the erm  perspex thing  that is, that is erm  till guard, and he's stood writing it on there cos he thought there was nowhere else. •248426_258146•
        And  stood blocking like, how I get round to the till! •258146_262446•
        And you just couldn't absolutely see anything  serving customer  I was going to , to move  or change out my draw  shutting it up, turning it off, going away  and somebody else had come, he kept, kept, kept doing that and he was stood there all the time and I thought  I thought you definitely won't get the job! •262446_278526•
        Well you're, you're not bloody suitable for it cos you keep getting  under my bloody feet! •278606_281706•
        And then  •281866_282036•
*GAV:	How old is he? •284596_285346•
*SUE:	I dunno. •286546_286806•
        Probably about twenty three I think. •286806_288226•
        And he's filled all the front in and the back, like, referees and everything  and he said  inside you've got to give your details of your erm  employment history  and he'd not put anything in, said I didn't know whether to put anything on there cos I'm on a Y P. •288226_301236•
        I said, what you mean a Y T S? •301346_303346•
        He , and he looked and he went  yeah, Y T. •303346_305746•
        And I says, well  you know, is it, is it a job? •306076_309306•
        You've got to put it down. •309306_310166•
        And he went, well no it's not a job. •310166_311966•
        I said, well what is it then? •311966_313516•
        He said, well I'm training. •313516_314016•
        I said, well training to do what? •314016_316176•
        He says I'm training on a Y T S. •316176_318466•
        Jesus Christ! •318576_319646•
        Is he really thick or what! •319746_321076•
        I still don't know what he's doing! •321076_323506•
        He were working for an erm  Macro or something. •323506_327216•
        Macro? •328516_328796•
*GAV:	Yeah. •330896_331126•
        Well maybe. •331176_331566•
*SUE:	Oh I'm, I'm thinking of Macro  Macro wholesalers. •331566_334436•
*GAV:	Well I know Macro. •334826_335456•
*SUE:	And when he went, as he went, she says oh I don't think he'll have much choice, er, much chance do you? •335486_341696•
        And we got this mad bloke come in! •341696_347486•
        And  the amount of people come in, with a cigarette  I have to go up and tell them that it's a no-smoking area and they look at me as if I'm stupid! •347486_355286•
        Did I tell you about that bloke the other week who got, the one who just cocky with me? •355296_358096•
        Ooh God! •358096_358536•
        He really got my back up! •359256_360256•
        This young lad about  probably about twenty three, twenty four, and he came in with a cigarette and I said excuse me but I'm afraid it's a no-smoking area. •360286_368556•
        And he looked at me, and he said well have you got any, he , started like tutting and said well have you got any signs up? •368616_374396•
        And I must have been in a really funny mood, and I said yes we have it's on the till and he went  well I suggest you get them in the windows then! •374506_380686•
        And I felt like saying fuck off and  get out ! •380686_383906•
        But I thought  they're obvious, do you know what I mean? •383906_387606•
        It's like  going to a firework factory and  sparking up a cigarette you just wouldn't do it would you? •387606_392226•
        You wouldn't! •392226_394836•
        And this bloke come in today  and erm  looked a bit, looked a bit like a tramp  didn't quite catch what he said, I'm sure he said  God sent me in here for a cigarette! •394836_404926•
*GAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*SUE:	I said,, I said I'm sorry it's a no-smoking area. •404926_411056•
        And he looked at me, give me a really horrible look as well! •411056_413056•
        Felt like going  you know, how when somebody put a lot of hate in their eyes? •413666_419166•

*GAV:	me every day. •420526_420746•
*SUE:	I can't do it. •420746_421936•
        You know like if you look at someone  and they always say your eyes  are the souls  , like your soul aren't they? •421946_430656•
        You can always read people's eyes, especially with your kind of facial expressions, cos the eyes always tell the truth. •431326_437936•
        And he looked like he really hated me! •437936_439786•
*GAV:	Probably did! •439986_440436•
*SUE:	What, cos I told him  he couldn't smoke? •440586_444456•
*GAV:	No! •444556_444706•
        Probably just hates everybody! •444716_446456•
