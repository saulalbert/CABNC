*LYN:	Oh we go to our place for, now women stage for  •233194_233533•
*CHR:	stage, that's my, that's my whole life  it's my whole  I've had that erm, have my views, so why do you think I should vote Labour? •233712_234613•
*LYN:	Er •234613_234618•
*CHR:	Come on why? •234971_235017•
*LYN:	because they'll put more into education and schools •235236_235482•
*CHR:	Yeah and it'll take a  •235541_235625•
*LYN:	and the health service •235625_235705•

*CHR:	short  •237357_237395•
*LYN:	Mm  •237395_237401•
*CHR:	yes because they, they forgot to take out the money which they could have, which erm, which would of come from privatization, which they had no intention of doing so they took that out. •237401_238369•
        Are you not for privatization? •238377_238633•
*LYN:	Er yes, if it gives a better service at the end of the day •238901_239194•

*CHR:	and why shouldn't the health service be privatized? •240434_240595•
*LYN:	Because some people need a lot more treatment than others and it's something you cannot, you cannot forecast  •240786_241288•
*CHR:	I know but the actual, the actual the actual people that have to pay for us, such it could be more that erm, the government would actually pay for it and then hospitals would erm fight for the, for the actual er thing •241288_242501•
*LYN:	Yes, but what if they don't? •242523_242716•
