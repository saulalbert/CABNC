                           friend, or just roughly what you're doing at that
                           time that conversation took place, okay, [...] at
                           work, [...] form, then make me a cup of tea, she was
                           photo-copying,
Brenda (PS04U)             [8] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [9] that's what she was, she was doing [...] .

Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [11] [...] , you're usually saying oh it's just,
                           just general [...] .

Brenda (PS04U)             [20] mm.
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [21] or whatever, just let them know roughly what
                           you're doing, cos, all they get is a tape, it gives
                           them an idea of what sort of things were happening
                           at that time, any words they can't pick up [...] if
                           she's cooking, maybe that's something she was making
                           or whatever, erm, in the [...] please write the

                           order in which they speak on the tape in the first,
                           first instance, right, you know, so now Carla, my
                           husband, myself, Lee and, you don't need to repeat

                           this, I mean, rather just get the conversation, in,

                                     French won't she?
Carla (PS04X)                        [789] Won't talk to us in English.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [790] Which is

                                     she's not very good.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [793] That's how I was taught you see and
                                     so in spite of the long lapse of years
                                     there's still a tremendous amount up there
                                     because it was, it was properly learnt,
                                     you learn something thoroughly
Brenda (PS04U)                       [794] Cos Lee, since this one's been
                                     talking to him all the time
Jean (PS04Y)                         [795] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [796] she won't have English
Jean (PS04Y)                         [797] No.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [798] and I, I went to see her in open
                                     evening, I couldn't understand her, cos
                                     she you know, she real , I mean she is
                                     French
Jean (PS04Y)                         [799] Yes and he English is not very good.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [800] No not at all.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [801] Very interesting that, yeah.

Jean (PS04Y)                         [803] You know seeing this lovely glowing
                                     pink, it reminds me of two thoughts, I
                                     wish I'd bought that instead of my pale
                                     brown chintz.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [804] It's nice though that.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [805] Oh it is, I shall love it.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [806] It's nice, yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [807] In the next house you see I shall
                                     have to have different seating, they,
                                     they, I'm going to, I'm going to get
                                     somewhere smaller, so that three piece
                                     suite, it owes me nothing it only cost me
                                     what seven hundred pounds
Brenda (PS04U)                       [808] You've had it quite a long time
                                     haven't you?
Jean (PS04Y)                         [809] and it's been and it's been beaten
                                     to hell.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [810] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [811] Erm, I'll probably have er two or
                                     perhaps a three seater sofa and for the
                                     rest fire side chairs.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [812] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [813] And er, I thought I'd probably have
                                     wall paper on that wall, you know, use,
                                     use the curtains just as plenty of
                                     fullness, but have them for keeping out
                                     the light or keeping in the heat,
Brenda (PS04U)                       [814] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [815] not make them an enormous feature.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [816] Mm.

                                     wrong pink.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [820] It's a sort of salmon rather than
                                     the pink.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [821] Mm, that's the only thing I don't
                                     like.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [822] Mm.

Jean (PS04Y)                         [824] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [825] and all your, all your weights and
                                     everything at the bottom and you just can
                                     have them replaced if you want.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [826] Yes
Brenda (PS04U)                       [827] Well I'm gonna work, see what it
                                     would cost

Jean (PS04Y)                         [834] Perhaps line your strips with
                                     lining, to give them body.
Brenda (PS04U)                       [835] To give them, yeah ... yeah, don't

Jean (PS04Y)                         [879] I can remember at Westfield school
                                     about fifteen years ago we had an art
                                     teacher, who got the children to make an
                                     enormous thing, I think it was a Loch Ness
                                     Monster, and it went out of, out of the
                                     door of one room into another, you know,
                                     and they spent days and ages on making
                                     this thing
Brenda (PS04U)                       [880] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)                         [881] and I thought at the time it's, it's
                                     quite good enough just to have the idea
                                     and talk about the idea, make some
                                     drawings and
Brenda (PS04U)                       [882] Mm

                                     could make, that sort of like, not such a
                                     big sort of model
Dave (PS04V)                         [889] [...] .

Brenda (PS04U)                       [892] Well if you start cutting wood, you
                                     want to do things that are simple.

Jean (PS04Y)   [915] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [916] And, you know, it sort of
Jean (PS04Y)   [917] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [918] frightened me
Jean (PS04Y)   [919] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [920] cos of this.
Jean (PS04Y)   [921] Yes you can't afford to lose it.
Brenda (PS04U) [922] That's right and I mean, you know, it's like now my hair
               needs cutting and ... you know
Jean (PS04Y)   [cough]
Brenda (PS04U) [923] you just feel, I think when you've sort of lost much

Jean (PS04Y)   [927] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [928] the cold anyway but sort of
Jean (PS04Y)   [929] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [930] I said to Dave you could feel my hip bones ... and it oh
Jean (PS04Y)   [931] Ah!
Brenda (PS04U) [932] it was awful!
               [933] I dunno
Jean (PS04Y)   [934] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [935] you know I always said ... wouldn't it be lovely to be
               thin and I said thank God
Jean (PS04Y)   [936] No!
Brenda (PS04U) [937] for a bit of fat on you!
Jean (PS04Y)   [938] Oh absolutely!
Brenda (PS04U) [939] I said because
Jean (PS04Y)   [940] Well I remember Jackie telling me, she came back from ...
               sh she came up to meet me in London one day and she came up with
               ... the woman, a German woman, who at that time was ... a buyer
               for Army and Navy ... er ... women's fashions ... and this woman
               said that ... the model girls ... who are so thin ... she said
               ... they're always bursting into tears and crying because
               they're under such stress to keep their weight down ... and ...
               their boyfriends don't like it because ... the girls are are
               lovely to have on their arms to take out, you know everybody
               sort of goggles, you know, lovely slim girl with yellow half way
               down her back etc. ... but, in fact, these girls get very, very
               ratty!
Brenda (PS04U) [941] Mm ... have you seen Jackie ... lately?
Jean (PS04Y)   [942] She phoned me a couple of days ago and said, you know,
               that life was really quite on top of them ... her ... mother-in-
               law died and they've had all the problems of putting the old man
               into a home ... the main problem
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [943] being of course, is first of all find your home ... and
               while he wasn't in a home he was driving the neighbours mad
               because he's beginning to get confused and wander about and ...
               maintain that he hasn't had his dinner when two people
               [laughing] have already taken him in lunch [] , you know ... and
               the other problem is erm ... er er having found him a very nice
               home, he didn't want to go!
Brenda (PS04U) [944] He didn't want to go?
Jean (PS04Y)   [945] No ... not likely!
               [946] ... He wanted to stay in his own place ... but Jackie and
               Neville were nearly driven mad ... running up and down to
               Letchworth when all that they had to do, Jackie's full time
               teaching and Nev is trying to build as many kitchens or build as
               many doors ... for millionaires as he possibly can.
Brenda (PS04U) [947] So how's erm ... young Neil?
Jean (PS04Y)   [948] Neil ... poor boy ... he had a driving lesson yesterday
               ... came home and said I don't want to do any more!
Brenda (PS04U) [949] What driving?
Jean (PS04Y)   [950] Mm ... so ... he was going to go up to.
Brenda (PS04U) [951] I bet!
Jean (PS04Y)   [952] Neil, bring cup of tea in here and we'll talk about it ...
               and I didn't really want to spare the time because you could
               imagine that I wanted to get ready to come away ... but I I made
               myself sit and really give him time
Brenda (PS04U) [953] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [954] and he said ... he lacks, he totally lacks confidence.
Brenda (PS04U) [955] This is what he said?
Jean (PS04Y)   [956] Yep ... and ... and he doesn't seem to be able to
               concentrate ... and I said, but Neil you can drive, when you go
               out with me ... you drive beautifully ... yes but yours is an
               automatic car, I said, it's not that I said ... you've got road
               sense ... you know what you're doing, I said your good.
               [957] ... No I'm not I'm awful!
               [958] ... I said look Neil ... you can drive, but let's not ...
               let's not take it that I'm saying that you must drive ... let's
               go into the question of why you're making a mess of it at this
               time ... and we, oh honestly ... Brenda if I've got black
               circles under my eyes do not be surprised because, of course,
               this all goes back to his absolutely, appallingly, stupid
               mother!
Brenda (PS04U) [959] He's really on a downer, isn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [960] He is, he said ... my mother said she could have been a
               forensic scientist if it ha if I hadn't been born!
               [961] ... Well Brenda [laughing] you can tell, I hit the roof []
               !
               [962] ... I mean normally I never criticize the woman because
               after
Brenda (PS04U) [963] No!
Jean (PS04Y)   [964] all mothers are sacred ... but I just had to put the boot
               in on her, I'm afraid, I said ... stuff!
               [965] ... I said she could have taken a degree in her spare time
               in th she's only she's not yet forty ... I said that's absolute
               rubbish I said th the world is full of these damn women going
               around saying, if only I hadn't had children I could have been
               Lord Chief Justice of England, I said, it isn't true!
               [966] ... I said an er I said do you think that I wasn't a
               career woman, I said I gave it all up for yo er to have to look
               after my young babies ... and then when the babies were no
               longer young, when I ... got through that phase of my life I
               went back and combined ... looking after a home very adequately,
               thank you!
               [967] ... With quite a difficult job, I said this is a ... I
               said your mother is living in a fantasy world, of course, I see
               the stupid bitch prancing around Stowmarket with her silly nose
               in the air!
               [968] ... She's a very conceited woman, Pete the adulterous told
               me she was a very conceited woman ... and ... er Neil says I I
               I'd have to talk to him to him about this, she couldn't discuss
               anything with him ... she would lay down the law, that was how
               it had to be ... and I said no ... I said Gerry and I, I had no
               hesitation, as I said, in putting the boot in ... and Brenda and
               Dave ... take the same the attitude to children ... that ... you
               let them ... first of all when they're small, you have to tell
               them no ... like you do not
Brenda (PS04U) [969] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [970] put your handy ... in the fire, dear!
Brenda (PS04U) [971] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [972] And then when they get bigger ... you give them more and
               more freedom ... to do just what they want to do and all you do
               is watch carefully and make sure they're not doing anything ...
               obviously, outrageously daft ... but you let them find
               themselves ... and if there are problems they bring their
               problems to you and you sit down and you quietly talk about it,
               there's not shouting, no ... I say you've got to do this because
               I am your parent!
Brenda (PS04U) [973] That's obviously her, that was her answer.
Jean (PS04Y)   [974] [...] that's her answer ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [975] You just sort of wa ... you know, argue it an
Jean (PS04Y)   [976] I know.
               [977] ... and and he says too ... he had to admit that he's
               lazy.
Brenda (PS04U) [978] Who Neil?
Jean (PS04Y)   [979] Neil ... yeah ... and he said my mother is a lazy cow!
Brenda (PS04U) [980] Yeah but don't you think he ... he he finds, I mean if ...
               alright y y you're not ex always exactly like your parents but
               if you've bro , if he's brought up, his mother's lazy
Jean (PS04Y)   [981] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [982] so I mean ... you know, that's part of his life isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [983] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [984] I mean it's he won't know better.
Jean (PS04Y)   [985] This is what I said to him ... this is what I said to him
               ... an but he said I I see you with all your get up and go ...
               so I didn't make any reply to that.
Brenda (PS04U) [986] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [987] I thought, well ... let it sink in.
Brenda (PS04U) [988] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [989] And I came in one day ... a few days ago an and running
               around like a ... bee on heat ... with erm ... cries of oh ...
               I've got so much to do and no time left in which to do it and I
               went ... ha ... I said yes, if you [laughing] got up early, you
               know [] !
Brenda (PS04U) [990] That's right ... he cos he is very bad on timing isn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [991] Shocking!
Brenda (PS04U) [992] I mean, like you say, you ought ... you know ... you ought
               to buy her a talking alarm clock for Christmas.
Jean (PS04Y)   [993] Oh yes, he's got to ... have an alarm clock.
Brenda (PS04U) [994] Or a radio one
Jean (PS04Y)   [995] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [996] so tha that would actually
Jean (PS04Y)   [997] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [998] the noise.
Jean (PS04Y)   [999] Of course, I've I've left him in the charge of ... of not
               ... I haven't asked Paul to take him ... under his wing over the
               weekend, but I've left Neil a list of things that I would like
               done.
Brenda (PS04U) [1000] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1001] Like get back the dustbins which [...] took them out ...
               but she didn't bring them back at the end of the drive ... erm
               ... and I hope that Paul ... tells him off!
Brenda (PS04U) [1002] And make him do it, do it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1003] An and you know, says, look Neil you've got to get your
               ideas together ... because that's what Neil has lacked, he's
               lacked ... masculine influence.
Brenda (PS04U) [1004] Mm ... [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1005] It's no good
Brenda (PS04U) [1006] now, I mean ... you've been very to Neil ... over the
               last year or so ... and I mean now it's time to get his act
               together.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1007] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1008] She can't keep on
Jean (PS04Y)   [1009] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1010] I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1011] I mean I've stopped ... I've ... I I don't any longer get
               up and get anybody's breakfast for them.

Jean (PS04Y)   [1019] But er that's ... from now on Neil has got to carry th
               ... the responsibility for his own actions.
Brenda (PS04U) [1020] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1021] I'm not going to bail him out by jumping into the car.
Brenda (PS04U) [1022] And really he's got to, I mean, you know, alright with
               work wise ... I mean he's got to take ... even if, I mean ...
               the kids these days, I mean, even at Neil's age, I mean ... you
               know, I've come the conclusion now ... these kids ... they think
               the world owes them something!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1023] Yes they do.
Brenda (PS04U) [1024] They're not like in our day
Jean (PS04Y)   [1025] I know ... no.
Brenda (PS04U) [1026] I mean they really think ... I mean it's like Lee ...
               he's doing this work experience an ... yes it's great an it's a
               bit boring, mum ... and Dave said ... Lee, you know ... wake up!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1027] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1028] This is reality!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1029] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1030] This is what people go to work in an office
Jean (PS04Y)   [1031] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [1032] work nine to five thirty.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1033] Yes ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1034] He said we ... I tell you what I didn't like, mum ... an
               I said what?
               [1035] ... He said, making the tea, I said tough!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1036] Yes, exactly!
Brenda (PS04U) [1037] I said what do you think ... you go
Jean (PS04Y)   [1038] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1039] into ... your ... I said you go into a job, your earning
Jean (PS04Y)   [1040] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1041] twenty five grand a year an ... and you're sat at that
               desk and you're boss?
               [1042] ... I said it doesn't it work like that Lee!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1043] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1044] I said you're the general dogsbody!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1045] Quite ... quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [1046] He said oh God!
               [1047] ... And I said we
Jean (PS04Y)   [1048] That's the way life goes
Brenda (PS04U) [1049] you know I said that is life!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1050] Yeah ... mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1051] He said, God, he said ... I didn't realize it's like
               that, I said, no you didn't!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1052] Do you do you think they get a false idea from the
               television or something,wha what is it?
Brenda (PS04U) [1053] Well I dunno I thi I think the teachers to be honest,
               Jean, no you
Jean (PS04Y)   [1054] Ah!
Brenda (PS04U) [1055] know ... th the teachers in this ... I mean ... you know
               I don't know, I mean ... so some of the teachers have got ...
               got really weird ideas! ... [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1056] Have they?
Brenda (PS04U) [1057] I mean, you know,it it's unbelievable!
               [1058] ... But
Jean (PS04Y)   [1059] Ooh I'd like to know what their weird ideas are.
Brenda (PS04U) [1060] Well it's just erm ... ah I don't know, I mean ...
               there's there's certain things ... I mean,it it's like this
               maths [...] ... I mean, I I spoke to her ... erm ... and she
               said yes Lee had come on and everything in his maths ... and I
               said we ... the thing is, I said, knowing Lee has difficulty ...
               in in th l in the high level maths, yes you don't want to drop
               him, but ... surely ... I said I'm willing to help ... in my
               spare time, Lee's willing to do it and I said ... can't you show
               Lee ... I said I'm not ... I wasn't trying to tell her
Jean (PS04Y)   [1061] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1062] you know, that what you were told
Jean (PS04Y)   [1063] No, no, no, no ... no
Brenda (PS04U) [1064] [...] ... and I think [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1065] Yes well I think I told him a wrong, you see, there were
               two ... there there are two ways of tackling it and I don't
               think the way I told him is what they want for the examination
               purposes, at all!
Brenda (PS04U) [1066] Oh I don't know ... he under , when ... you that told he
               understood it a lot more ... than when she said it ... and she
               sort of went all
Jean (PS04Y)   [1067] She's probably trying to explain them in a very
               complicated way of doing maths.
Brenda (PS04U) [1068] No she answered me, she said well I haven't got time to
               sit down, explain it to them, they just gotta, if they're in a
               high level they should be able to grasp it and I
Jean (PS04Y)   [1069] Frankly I think that's very bad
Brenda (PS04U) [1070] that's no attitude!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1071] you know, that is no attitude!
               [1072] ... That's bad!
Brenda (PS04U) [1073] You know the fact is they've got to ... erm ... be
               explained.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1074] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1075] Erm ... I mean, Carla I can't fault her teachers.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1076] No, no
Brenda (PS04U) [1077] at that church one ... she has learnt so much ... erm ...
               I mean this ... to speak French, now she speaking it in three
               weeks!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1078] She's excellent isn't she ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1079] You know, it's unbeliev
Jean (PS04Y)   [1080] Three weeks!
Brenda (PS04U) [1081] three weeks, that's all she's been doing it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1082] That's marvellous.
Brenda (PS04U) [1083] You know, I mean ... but this teacher won't stand no
               nonsense ... and I said to Lee ... y you were at it three years
               before you could speak like Carla speaks it!
               [1084] ... You know she has learnt so much!
               [1085] ... Erm i in this school, I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1086] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1087] they're very strict ... I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1088] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1089] you know ... but I think half of Lee's it [...] there's
               no discipline
Jean (PS04Y)   [1090] No ha
Brenda (PS04U) [1091] but then
Jean (PS04Y)   [1092] and when you try t ... in the past when I tried to find
               some way ... of imposing discipline, there is no way because ...
               quite rightly, you're not allowed to strike children, I never
               wanted to and I ... I hardly ever did ... at one school where
               ... there was a marvellous spirit of give and take ... I used to
               whip off my little black velvet slipper occasionally and whack
               some of the larger boys about the top of the thigh.
               [1093] just for fun, you know ... but I'm not a believer in
               using your fists, you ought to be using your brain to teach with
               ... but ... there were no ... there are no sanctions, if you say
               ... you must stay behind after school, you have to send a letter
               home ... and half the parents will write back and say my son or
               daughter is not staying after school and that is that!
Brenda (PS04U) [1094] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1095] And that's their right ... and so ... you think of
               something else we ... you're not allowed to take them out of a
               favourite lesson, you're not allowed to say ... you are going to
               miss your football or a P E ... P E teachers and the football
               teachers, quite rightly, say ... if you can't keep discipline in
               your class why ... [laughing] why should we be penalized [] ?
Brenda (PS04U) [1096] Mm ... that's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1097] And er ... you're pretty helpless really.
Brenda (PS04U) [1098] You are.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1099] You see the only way that you can really discipline them
               ... is when you have a school where ... the rules have been
               very, very strict from the moment that they went into that
               school ... and they have had their noses held to the grindstone
               ... with work up to their brows ... and they just don't think of
               being tiresome ... and anybody who is tiresome is pulled out and
               put in a special room on their own, called a sin bin ... an
               which is rather boring ... and made to work even [laugh] harder!
Brenda (PS04U) [1100] Mm ... but no what I'm ... sort of, getting back, I mean,
               you know, I don't ... I think it's the kids ... I mean, I dunno
               why?
               [1101] ... Whether they have too much or what they have ... but,
               I mean ... they're just ... they just think everybody owes them
               something, and it's like Neil, I mean, to me ... I mean ... I
               can't see why he can't get off his backside ... and go and work
               in a supermarket ... but it's not the job they want, the same
               answer I said to [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1102] I think at the moment Brenda he would take ... any job if
               he could get one.
Brenda (PS04U) [1103] He would take if offered it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1104] Yes I think so I [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [1105] There's a lot of [...] I mean it's like
Jean (PS04Y)   [1106] To be fair ... to be fair to him I think that he would
               ... erm ... he's set his heart on going and working at the lawn
               mower place on the production line
Brenda (PS04U) [1107] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1108] and he isn't ... in my opinion ... really considering
               half the other jobs, but he has said that he wants that ... and
               by the mercy of providence ... this business of Lee being flung
               out by Andy ... and being ... put back onto the ... into the job
               centre coincides with my being ... very tight on money.
Brenda (PS04U) [1109] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1110] You'll notice that I've said to you ... we're going to
               run the [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [1111] That's right, yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1112] And I'm going to pay it back ... with lodgers money
               really.
Brenda (PS04U) [1113] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1114] I mean ... my dear, I said to Paul, Paul yesterday was
               was ... babbling on about ... if Karen would take him back and I
               said Paul ... I shall be extremely displeased if you ever leave
               this house ... to go back to ... Karen, you know o after only
               being with me for something like three or four weeks, I said
               you'll never come back again ... I said I'm not going to be
               messed about like that!
Brenda (PS04U) [1115] No that's right!
               [1116] ... What did he say to that?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1117] Oh [laughing] ... I'm counting on you, lodgers money [] !
Brenda (PS04U) [1118] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1119] And I am Brenda!
Brenda (PS04U) [1120] Yeah, but thing is ... I mean, you know, there's a lot of
               kids out there, I mean I've know with, sort of, Lee's friend ...
               you know, okay, with us I mean ... with Lee o okay we don't I've
               often said to him, why don't you get a Saturday job?
               [1121] ... And he said no ... and I said okay, fair enough ...
               but then, you know ... you can say to Lee, well ... if you want
               something ... now you're gonna have to work
Jean (PS04Y)   [1122] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1123] and then he will, he'll go and do something.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1124] Yes ... mm let's go here ... I won't talk.
Brenda (PS04U) [1125] Erm
Jean (PS04Y)   [1126] Erm
Brenda (PS04U) [1127] but thing is there's a lot lot of like Lee's friends and
               that and they say ... well I couldn't work in a shoe shop and I
               wouldn't work in a, and I say why?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1128] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [1129] Well they say, well would you do jobs you don't like?
               [1130] ... Yes if I need the money.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1131] The ... the only job which I told Neil I do not expect
               him to take ... is working for [...] waste disposal ... because
               he did that, this time last year ... and before he started he
               was full of big talk about you make a lot of money and you get a
               lot of tips at Christmas ... he found that ... you do not make a
               lot of money ... and you do not get generous tips at Christmas
Brenda (PS04U) [1132] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1133] and he used to come home ... looking as white as a sheet
               ... sick to the teeth ... and he used to just go to bed and
               collapse in a heap, he isn't strong enough to do it and it's
               pointless for him to try ... but other than that he can do
               anything he fancies.
Brenda (PS04U) [1134] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1135] I vir [...] I just got
Brenda (PS04U) [1136] Neil, I mean he
Jean (PS04Y)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [1137] No but I mean he has had a bad start
Jean (PS04Y)   [1138] [...] ... and hasn't had the example of either a mother
               or a father ... who understands the necessity of
Brenda (PS04U) [1139] But there are a lot of
Jean (PS04Y)   [1140] [...] work.
Brenda (PS04U) [1141] that have had the support ... but they won't get off
               their backsides and it tends to be this ge generation.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1142] Well you know when my son was eighteen ... he and his
               friends were entertaining each other to pocket parties at which
               they were ... working out ... what University courses they were
               going to apply for
Brenda (PS04U) [1143] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1144] and what they wanted was the easiest ones ... and they
               came up with the answer ... economics ... Gerald simply, we Ge
               Gerry and I put our heads together and went bib bib bib bib bib,
               you know as good parents do ... and we both presented him with a
               ... fait accompli you either take an engineering degree, we
               don't care what sort ... or ... you go out to work in a bank ...
               because ... economics ... you will not get a first ... because
               you are not reader and t to ... get a first in economics, which
               is what you'll need if you're gonna make any money out of it
Brenda (PS04U) [1145] Mm
Jean (PS04Y)   [1146] and have a decent life ... to get a first or either a two
               one in economics ... you have got to read ... a very great deal,
               you've got to be a reader, a student ... a taker of notes, a
               writer of essays ... and we said that is not you ... so ...
               [laughing] within two
Brenda (PS04U) [1147] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1148] minutes he was looking through all the advertisements for
               civil engineering [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [1149] That's right ... but you had the encouragement, who's
               that waving?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1150] Who ... where?
Brenda (PS04U) [1151] That car in front ... I dunno, he was waving, I just hope
               it wasn't ... waving at us.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1152] That one E E?
Brenda (PS04U) [1153] I dunno.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1154] The Fiesta?
Brenda (PS04U) [1155] Maybe she wasn't waving at us
Jean (PS04Y)   [1156] No
Brenda (PS04U) [1157] it was only for a minute.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1158] Oh.
Brenda (PS04U) [1159] No, no, no, she's not
Jean (PS04Y)   [1160] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1161] I think she's realized she's made a mistake ...
               [laughing] she was waving away [] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [1162] Oh yes, yes, yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1163] And thought it was somebody else.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1164] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1165] But er ... no I mean there's ... th there's [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [cough]
Brenda (PS04U) [1166] that they've just, you know ... I mean some of the kids
               ... I don't know where we were going ... me and Dave ...
               somewhere or other we were ... and there was some kids an and
               their attitude, you know, it's ... well why should we do this,
               you know
Jean (PS04Y)   [1167] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1168] this isn't fair, I mean life's not fair.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1169] I think it's the television as much as anything else.
Brenda (PS04U) [1170] Yeah ... probably ... yeah tha that does
Jean (PS04Y)   [1171] I mean I'm appalled at the way that teenagers are still
               being shown on the television ... as they were twenty years ago
               ... able to rule the roost ... because they did.
Brenda (PS04U) [1172] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1173] They did ... erm ... twenty years ago a teenager, a girl
               of sixteen could leave home ... she could pick up a job ... just
               like that!
Brenda (PS04U) [1174] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1175] And, you know get reasonable money ... and there were ...
               there were still rented rooms of a sort, but she could find ...
               somewhere, of a sort, to live ... with other kids and they could
               do what they jolly well liked!
Brenda (PS04U) [1176] I dunno it's ... I mean ... you know it's
Jean (PS04Y)   [1177] But those days are well and truly over!
               [1178] ... And I don't think they'll ever come back!
               [1179] ... For one thing I I don't think that the next
               generation of parents are going to stand it ... because with the
               , cos I told you what, what I said Neil about erm ... when er
               ... when he was a father ... I said if you had a pretty fifteen
               year old daughter would you want to have some ... rough oaf
               taking her down a back alley and screwing her?
               [1180] No I bloody wouldn't, he said cor that's awful! ...
               [laughing] and it it's just what he's been doing [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [1181] Doing that's it ... it's alright for him to do it!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1182] [laugh] ... okay for him ... but nobody's going to touch
               his little girl.
Brenda (PS04U) [1183] Ah ... but erm
Jean (PS04Y)   [1184] Or my own boy.
Brenda (PS04U) [1185] no ... I mean I I do really feel sorry Neil because
               people wa it it it makes me cross because people won't give Neil
               the benefit of the doubt.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1186] No they won't ... they won't
Brenda (PS04U) [1187] You know and if they just won't give him a chance.

               point, I mean

Brenda (PS04U) [1191] Harry hasn't given up totally ... I mean he hasn't
Jean (PS04Y)   [1192] No he would've done if you hadn't, but he says this
Brenda (PS04U) [1193] I mean he feels like it, obviously, like with
Jean (PS04Y)   [1194] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1195] his driving.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1196] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1197] What's the point?
               [1198] I've got
Jean (PS04Y)   [1199] Yep.
Brenda (PS04U) [1200] no confidence ... who cares, you know, whether I pass or
               that ... I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1201] Well ... I did ... we we talked about this, you see Mary
               Anne, [...] half way through the conversation ... er ... Neil
               went out of the room so that I could to Mary Ann ... and I said
               towards the end of my conversation, you know, Mary Ann you're a
               very wise person, give me some advice ... I said, I told her
               about Neil not wanting no not doing well on the driving,
               although he can drive ... she said he doesn't want to do it ...
               she said don't hassle him ... so when he came downstairs I said
               ... I've been talking to Mary Ann and she sends you her love ...
               and because, of course, you know, we've got a grandson, you know
               she had a son, my
Brenda (PS04U) [1202] That's right, yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1203] grandson is about that age ... and very sympathetic she
               is ... erm ... I said er ... Mary Ann says she doesn't know what
               the point is, you don't really want to do it ... he said, she's
               right, I don't ... he said, in a way I do, in another way I
               don't, I said
Brenda (PS04U) [1204] You see
Jean (PS04Y)   [1205] well we can't go into the reasons for that but I said
               let's respect the reasons ... I said if that's how you feel I
               said, you're a man you you must make your own decisions ... I
               said probably in a few months time you'll come

Brenda (PS04U) [1235] Where did you meet him at?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1236] Marriage agency.
Brenda (PS04U) [1237] What Dateline?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1238] No ... Destiny, a local one.
Brenda (PS04U) [1239] Oh you're not with Dateline any more?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1240] No ... no good!
               [1241] ... Not for me ... this local one is absolutely splendid!
Brenda (PS04U) [1242] Is it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1243] Mm ... You ca
Brenda (PS04U) [1244] What about
Jean (PS04Y)   [1245] You can talk to the man who's running it.
Brenda (PS04U) [1246] Is Ron still going with his [...] ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1247] Oh yes, he's still with Trudy.
Brenda (PS04U) [1248] Do you reckon he'll end up getting married?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1249] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1250] No ... what on ... her side or his?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1251] Her side ... she won't have it.
Brenda (PS04U) [1252] Won't she?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1253] No ... I've warned Ron ... he's such an obstinate so and
               so, he won't be told!
               [1254] ... I said that I think you'll find, Ron that Trudy ...
               if she married would have to give up her ... late husband's
               occupational widow's pension ... so that the way you're going on
               now, where you go and stay with her for two or three days at a
               time ... is far better ... oh no, no, no, she'll be able to keep
               her pension [...] ... I said I very much doubt it ... then I
               said ... people are so jealous ... that if she does marry you
               ... and he doesn't tell the firm ... I bet that one of her ...
               dear neighbours will ... oh no they're all very nice people
               round where she lives, I thought there's no good arguing with
               Ron!
Brenda (PS04U) [1255] Would she lose he pension then if she got married?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1256] Well ... mostly, yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1257] Careful when you put your cup [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [1258] If you haven't, if you worked ... if you haven't worked
               at th sorry?
Brenda (PS04U) [1259] Careful when you pick that up, it's ever so slippery.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1260] Oh my God!
               [1261] ... If you get a ... a pension based on the fact that
               you're your late husband's widow ... when you are no longer your
               late husband's widow, but somebody's wife ... they don't have to
               pay you that pension.
Brenda (PS04U) [1262] Oh ... so I suppose Trudy doesn't know either?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1263] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1264] Actually I can't blame her.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1265] No ... and she doesn't want Ron ... to move into her
               house ... because there is no way that he could.
Brenda (PS04U) [1266] The thing is he's so [...] isn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1267] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1268] It doesn't, sort of, change anything ... Has he organized
               his [...] ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1269] Sorry?
Brenda (PS04U) [1270] Will he organize his [...] ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1271] No not really ... no ... it's still a great big ...
               muddly tip!
               [1272] ... You have seen it, haven't you?
Brenda (PS04U) [1273] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1274] Oh ... oh you must!
Brenda (PS04U) [1275] Cos how old is he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1276] Seventy.
Brenda (PS04U) [1277] He's quite good for seventy, in he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1278] Oh very ... oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1279] The thing is now, you see there's no way ... would you
               change him?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1280] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1281] But he wouldn't want it, would he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1282] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1283] This is lovely!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1284] Mm!
               [1285] ... I mean poor old Ron!
Brenda (PS04U) [1286] He's been going with her quite a while, though has he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1287] Yes, oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1288] So she's just happy with that relationship, is she?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1289] Yes ... in fact, to be perfectly honest with you ... the
               relationship is a bit more than she wants ... Ron ... [cough]
               ... is a bit of a pain ... I told him over and over again ...
               not to push his luck, I said for goodness sake, Ron, be ...
               grateful for what you've got ... apparently she ... doesn't like
               to make love with the lights on ... I said well if that's what
               she doesn't like that's what she doesn't like, you're not going
               to change a woman of sixty eight!
               [1290] ... Oh [...] ... the way she and her husband went on ...
               that's all in the past ... I said yes, but it's there was an
               awful lot of it.
Brenda (PS04U) [1291] That's right ... he should really, especially tha at her
               age!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1292] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1293] He should, sort of, honour her wishes shouldn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1294] He should.
Brenda (PS04U) [1295] So has he all gone to his gr mother's at Christmas?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1296] Mm ... yes ... I told Paul ... that he can bring a lady
               up ... at Christmas-time.

Brenda (PS04U) [1373] I mean, all I use ... I mean, if I was making them for
               somebody I would ... use about four or five layers ... and then
               I would put ... a piece of lace of braid or ... something at the
               top
Jean (PS04Y)   [1374] mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1375] just to make, if I was making them really
Jean (PS04Y)   [1376] Mm mm

Jean (PS04Y)   [1399] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1400] But it owes me nothing now.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1401] That's right.

               on and there, sort of
Jean (PS04Y)   [1483] Oh my dear some of them are comparing you with ...
               Racquel Welsh or whatever, you know you get the impression
               they're looking down their nose, as much to say ... oh how
               dreadful for me to have to be seen with this [laughing] old
               person [] !

               driving over to Lavenham, I said an early would be much
               appreciated, I said I cooked ... the Sunday Lunch for my
               lodgers, but I haven't, in fact, had any myself ... he said
               you've got to have a high tea, he said ... you must have ... a
               proper meal ... and he ordered up salad and ... a a ham salad
               and ... have this and have that and have the other, where as
               some of them ... like this chap Gerald who was erm ... sent me
               by one of the other agencies ... the first time we went out he
               took me to a meal ... and he obviously felt that quite enough,
               after that he used to come out ... to see me after he'd had his
               meal ... [...] ... meanness, hanging onto money!
               [1489] ... Wasn't going to waste money on a woman of around his
               own age!

Brenda (PS04U) [1500] I mean that's a bit daft really!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1501] You know who it is that wants to make money on that?
               [1502] ... That's that dreadful man,!
               [1503] ... Councillor ... he's had his greedy little eyes on
               that area for years.
Brenda (PS04U) [1504] Has he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1505] Mm.

               obviously look at the development plans and it would go ahead
               ... eventually for something there, they didn't state what.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1510] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1511] I mean it might be ... whatever year

Brenda (PS04U) [1515] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1516] They wanted to
Brenda (PS04U) [1517] That whole bit?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1518] raise that and have that developed as a road, the other
               one, would ... be closed
Brenda (PS04U) [1519] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1520] and developed ... would be ... destroyed ... and
               another,an an another big road put in it's place and ... he they
               they were after Horsell Moor ... which is where they're going to
               put the Tesco's.
Brenda (PS04U) [1521] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1522] That area's called Horsell Moor
Brenda (PS04U) [1523] I don't think they made it
Jean (PS04Y)   [1524] I bet
Brenda (PS04U) [1525] though, do you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1526] Well I hope not!
Brenda (PS04U) [1527] We do need one.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1528] Yes, we do we do need another store in Woking of that
               kind.

Jean (PS04Y)   [1534] Thirty years, easily, I mean it wa , it was already
               established when we arrived in nineteen fifty nine.
Brenda (PS04U) [1535] But Dave said Tesco's can't do, what they did they did it
               at Weybridge, they said let us buy your sight ... you say where

               ... erm John's firm is simply doing extremely well in spite of
               the recession.
Brenda (PS04U) [1546] Yes right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1547] I mean they're very pleased with him because he's the
               front man ... having appeared on the Anneka Rice thing and being
               kissed by Anneka Rice in the full view of millions [laughing] I

Brenda (PS04U) [1556] Yes.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1557] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1558] Did you see you with that gas that advert she did with
               that ... poor woman!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1559] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1560] Yes.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1561] I don't blame the woman for doing as much as possible on
               television ... with in those advertisements because I think that
               woman ... have got only a short ... life in those ads because
               she'd get bored with them [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [1562] Wonder why [...] ?

Jean (PS04Y)   [1565] Jealousy I think.
Brenda (PS04U) [1566] Probably.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1567] Hell of a lot of
Brenda (PS04U) [1568] I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1569] jealousy.
Brenda (PS04U) [1570] she's got a lot of get and go [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1571] That she has ... she has.
Brenda (PS04U) [1572] [...] ... this is taping now ... so what was erm ...
               Libertys did they have it?
               [1573] ... Re remind me tomorrow ... I must take those ...
               twenty [...] vouchers
Jean (PS04Y)   [1574] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1575] to erm ... Debs
Jean (PS04Y)   [1576] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1577] and Jenny was saying she went to ... Debenhams yesterday
               they had a twelve day spectacular at eight thirty to eight
               thirty at night ... [...] ... there was [...] clothes they were
               half price ... plus you got a third of ten per cent off.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1578] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1579] But I think a all the sales will be off before Christmas.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1580] I ... I looked at the fabrics in the Libertys
Brenda (PS04U) [1581] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1582] and ... if I can't get want I want at the Famlingham
               Textile Centre which is ... excellent ... when I next need
               fabrics I shall come up, I will come up to London and I'll go to
               Libertys, but I will have measured first of all to within an
               inch as to what I want because
Brenda (PS04U) [1583] It is expensive.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1584] Well some of the stuff is eighteen pounds a meter ... but
               if you think of the cost of a ... a well fitting jacket for
               somebody like myself, it's astronomical!
Brenda (PS04U) [1585] You know what you should have done while you was up there
               this time ... you should have took asked for some samples.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1586] Yes, my dear, I I did not feel well enough just
Brenda (PS04U) [1587] No do you think that they will?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1588] I didn't even think about, yes they will, they'll give
               you a little cutting, I suppose.
Brenda (PS04U) [1589] Yeah, but not only that, I mean, they will now ... all
               these shops are doing like a mail order
Jean (PS04Y)   [1590] That's interesting.
Brenda (PS04U) [1591] and they would actually send ... and I know why because
               erm ... John Lewis in London ... erm ... Jackie wanted some
               fabric ... and she'd seen it up there and Harrods ... and erm
               ... she found out she didn't have her card with her, just her
               Barclaycard ... said would you post this we wou ... we'll have
               to charge you, like, two pound
Jean (PS04Y)   [1592] Mm, mm.

Jean (PS04Y)   [1594] Well yes it's very good.
Brenda (PS04U) [1595] well I couldn't get up there because she know [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1596] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [1597] park
Jean (PS04Y)   [1598] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [1599] and ... she wanted sort of so many meters of each
Jean (PS04Y)   [1600] Mm ... yeah
Brenda (PS04U) [1601] and the the they sent it to her.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1602] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1603] And I suppose you could treat
Jean (PS04Y)   [1604] Worth going.
Brenda (PS04U) [1605] people this year, if they'd done all their Christmas
               shopping mail order.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1606] Oh yes ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1607] Rather than, sort of go round themselves ... I reckon
               we'll take that with us.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1608] Good idea!
Brenda (PS04U) [1609] Might want them for a cup of tea [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [1610] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1611] I think we should have got away with a small Coke,
               shouldn't we?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1612] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1613] That's nice of them.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1614] It's so big!

               was Dave originally ... had these five days off [...] taping ...
               and he said no, he said, you know you're so tired, have a little
               rest ... we'll go up I'll go up on the train ... only to get to
               the Selhurst Park he's got four or five train journeys [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1616] Yeah ... mm
Brenda (PS04U) [1617] and he has to get, like ... Woking to Surbiton ...
               Surbiton to Clapham Junction

               has Thornton Heath to Selhurst Park.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1620] Mm ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1621] So it's five trips
Jean (PS04Y)   [1622] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1623] there's no easier
Jean (PS04Y)   [1624] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1625] way
Jean (PS04Y)   [1626] No ... no
Brenda (PS04U) [1627] round it ... and like Dave said ... it would've cost him,
               sort of, seven or eight pound a day in petrol
Jean (PS04Y)   [1628] Mm ... quite
Brenda (PS04U) [1629] and he managed to get a ticket for a week [...]

Brenda (PS04U) [1638] sort of, quarter past seven he's had to leave in the
               morning ... to get there ... and then not getting home to, sort
               of , seven o'clock ... Dave picks up from the station ... and I
               think
Jean (PS04Y)   [1639] Part of life.
Brenda (PS04U) [1640] and I, sort of, said to him it's he's enjoyed it, he
               hasn't, sort of , moaned.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1641] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1642] He he just moans about the fact of making tea!

               gotta revise it ... which is brilliant, I mean, [...] at the
               moment ... but they also give them three hours homework a night!

Brenda (PS04U) [1664] because obviously like ... Kim very soon after revising
               she's going out.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1665] Yes, yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1666] Erm ... but, I mean, you know, I think they need to s
               they should say, no homework ... for this week, because they've
               already

               given all this and it's the homework ... it's nothing to do ...
               with the revision you've got to do in his the exams!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1683] Yeah, ha ... ha ha.
Brenda (PS04U) [1684] You know, it's sort of, totally different.

               I'd have devoured that.
Brenda (PS04U) [1704] Yeah and me look how much I've eaten.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1705] No, no I can't I just can't eat ... so I'm not forcing
               myself to eat, what I'm trying to do is only to eat the right
               things ... and I must start vitamin supplements ... I think I've
               got the age when I probably ... need that, I mean, this cold ...
               is a warning to me that my immune system is not as strong as it
               ought to be, I shouldn't have had another cold ... so soon after
               getting rid of one!

Jean (PS04Y)   [1726] Erm ... what difference will it make to your life ... to
               have Carla at the secretary.
Brenda (PS04U) [1727] I think I'm not ... she will then come in and let herself
               in, I have to be in at three
Jean (PS04Y)   [1728] Of course, yes, yes yes
Brenda (PS04U) [1729] o'clock

Brenda (PS04U) [1731] and for somebody to let her in, but
Jean (PS04Y)   [1732] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1733] when she gets [...] she's actually in thirteen
Jean (PS04Y)   [1734] Yes, that's right.

Jean (PS04Y)   [1736] Yes ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1737] Yes, I still would like to be in the house, but
Jean (PS04Y)   [1738] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1739] if I'm not
Jean (PS04Y)   [1740] It's not disastrous.
Brenda (PS04U) [1741] she's old enough
Jean (PS04Y)   [1742] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [1743] to let herself in.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1744] And you can work locally ... pick up jobs locally.
Brenda (PS04U) [1745] That's right, you know, and I still pop in.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1746] I mean by ... by the time all that happens then that'll
               be next October.
Brenda (PS04U) [1747] Yes it's in
Jean (PS04Y)   [1748] Well

Brenda (PS04U) [1753] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1754] You know ... you said that Rob is very good on
Brenda (PS04U) [1755] Yes ... he is ... but the thing is cars at the moment are
               so cheap
Jean (PS04Y)   [1756] They are.
Brenda (PS04U) [1757] I can pick them up
Jean (PS04Y)   [1758] They are.
Brenda (PS04U) [1759] because, I mean ... it it's like anything at the moment
               it it
Jean (PS04Y)   [1760] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1761] it's sold so cheap.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1762] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1763] That erm, made me laugh because he said to his secretary
               ... erm ... you know, I I honestly don't think your time is
               [...] she is so down in the mouth.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1764] And he had,did didn't you say to him, haven't you got
               eyes in your head, couldn't you see how
Brenda (PS04U) [1765] Well
Jean (PS04Y)   [1766] ill I was!
Brenda (PS04U) [1767] still I think it's the fact ... erm ... you know ... y
               you're not ... she's got a problem on her mind ... she's not
               been well ... you're not taking her serious
Jean (PS04Y)   [1768] Mm mm
Brenda (PS04U) [1769] you ought to cut the leash a bit
Jean (PS04Y)   [1770] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1771] which cos I think
Jean (PS04Y)   [1772] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1773] and
Jean (PS04Y)   [1774] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1775] she's obviously, you know, when you think what she does
               for you, marvellous!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1776] Mm, mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1777] Erm ... and she said an also I think she wants to ask you
               something ... and ... you know ... she asked you before and
               you've taken no notice!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1778] Mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1779] And ... and he said well ... do you think I ought to give
               her, you know, what about two pound a week?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1780] Ah!
Brenda (PS04U) [1781] And she said well look ... all I'm, all I'm
Jean (PS04Y)   [1782] Brenda!
Brenda (PS04U) [1783] saying is that, all I'm is erm ... why don't you erm ...
               ke don't think of the money because how valuable is she to you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1784] Quite ... quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [1785] And it it really shook him up and she turned round and
               said ... he turned round and said, very valuable.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1786] Mm, of course.
Brenda (PS04U) [1787] And he said well happens, she said what happened if she
               ... walked out ... tomorrow?
               [1788] ... He said I could never replace her ... he said e
               nobody is to [...] she is ... he said I just couldn't, he said
               I'd ... you know, I'd pay what I'd have to
Jean (PS04Y)   [1789] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1790] he said we'll be realistic
Jean (PS04Y)   [1791] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1792] he said, you know ... fifteen pounds a week, and I said
               to him ... what about the petrol?
               [1793] ... I said, you know, it's costing fifteen pound a week
               in a , a least and you you're you're paying ten ... and he said,
               no he said, he said I think that's ample, he said.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1794] It isn't ... because I keep on going down and filling up
               the metro with ten pounds worth of petrol and I'm not making a
               ... a trip back and forth to work every day.
Brenda (PS04U) [1795] Go on, I put that in on Wednesday and I've got to about a
               quarter of a tank again.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1796] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1797] So it'll be
Jean (PS04Y)   [1798] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1799] tomorrow ... I put it in [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [1800] And it's an automatic, isn't it?
               [1801] ... They use it up.
Brenda (PS04U) [1802] They use a lot yeah ... the ch I put it in my [...] I
               mean, I said yesterday to him, we've got the decorators in ...
               and then co they turned round and said ... he is meant to be a
               businessman and they said ... he cannot believe ... they've
               never met tha such a penny pinching guy
Jean (PS04Y)   [1803] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1804] in all our life!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1805] Mm ... yeah ... yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1806] They come in, he said somebody with a house like this,
               the money you've got, the cars that [...] got
Jean (PS04Y)   [1807] Mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1808] and he turned round penny pinching, saying that ... you
               know, why has this cost me thirty quid, why can't I
Jean (PS04Y)   [1809] Ooh!
Brenda (PS04U) [1810] get it for twenty?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1811] Oh yes, yes
Brenda (PS04U) [1812] They nearly walked out last week!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1813] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [1814] They just honestly couldn't believe that
Jean (PS04Y)   [1815] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1816] somebody could be like that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1817] But some people are appallingly mean ... did I tell you
               about that Ned being done out of six hundred pounds by an indian
               doctor and a her husband?
Brenda (PS04U) [1818] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1819] He put in a kitchen ... and he thought there was
               something funny about these people ... erm ... they didn't want
               to give him money up front for ... the fabric, you know, the
               woods and things and he wasn't asking the full amount anyway ...
               and ... he said, you know, a ... things are very tight in
               business and I do not want to run up any more debts ... if you
               will let me have ... some of [...] cash, some of the cash fo for
               the wood ... as soon as the wood's delivered I'll come and do
               the job, it's not as though your money is going to be ... tied
               up in any way ... and there was a bit of a face pulling ... and
               saw this woman drop to, sort of, always hovering around ...
               always putting her motty in ... and erm ... when th when the job
               was nearly completed ... madam steps forward with the cries of
               ... that isn't quite right and that isn't quite right and Nev
               was putting hours doing ... nit-picking ... fussing about
               getting things ... absolutely perfect ... got it absolutely
               perfect but when it came to the final bill ... they knocked off
               six hundred because there was the tiniest little scratch ... on
               one of the panels!
Brenda (PS04U) [1820] Oh ... [...] ... he couldn't do anything about it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1821] No it was fi it was fixed in.
Brenda (PS04U) [1822] Perhaps [...] they're fiddling
Jean (PS04Y)   [1823] Ah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1824] a bit.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1825] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1826] That's one way to put it, anyway ... and he said that ...
               and he said he lost out on six hundred pounds?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1827] Six hundred yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1828] Did he not, sort of, think to take them to court?
               [1829] I suppose it would have cost him more in court fees!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1830] Well I think he can ... go through the small claims court
               for ... five hundred ... but I suppose six hundred was just
               over, it's probably something very crafty that they thought up
               between them, this pair!
Brenda (PS04U) [1831] It's awful isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1832] Tis awful ... I was taught as a child in catechism ...
               the labourer is worthy of his hire ... there are four sins that
               cry out to heaven for justice ... one of them is a oppressing
               the widow and orphan and the other ... is defrauding the
               labourer of his hire ... because the labourer is worthy of his
               hire ... that's a sin that ... cries to heaven for justice,
               that's what I was taught as a child.
Brenda (PS04U) [1833] I bet he was really, sort of angry?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1834] Oh they were, they felt sick!
Brenda (PS04U) [1835] But the er it's does he still see them or?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1836] Oh no, I mean the these were clients and they could never
               be friends after doing that ... I've come to the conclusion you
               can either keep your money or you can keep your friends, but
               you're not going to do both.
Brenda (PS04U) [1837] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1838] In life.
Brenda (PS04U) [1839] Right, shall we make tracks?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1840] Yep.
*** 26 (Tape 015105) ***
Jean (PS04Y)   [1841] and your instrument panel started showing that ... the
               wheels had fallen off and one wheel was on fire ... first thing
               we had to think was ... are the ... [...] reading correct!

               back, you have to get them out ... before you landed because
               when you ... when you brought the flaps up ... if they were
               still in this little bay you would squash them to death ... and
               one day ... his dials showed that he had, in fact, [laughing]
               squashed them to death [] !
Brenda (PS04U) [1847] Oh!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1848] But he hadn't.
Brenda (PS04U) [1849] He hadn't?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1850] No. [car starting]
Brenda (PS04U) [1851] Come on car, don't start playing on me now when I want to
               get home [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [1852] [yawn] Ooh don't, at the thought of tea!
Brenda (PS04U) [1853] So it's like that without, I mean, with Carla, I mean,
               you can't ... you know, you just can't think when you've gotta
               ... I mean she would have been bored and she wouldn't have
               looked at the gifts.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1854] Of course, poor little child!
               [1855] ... No!
               [1856] ... No!
Brenda (PS04U) [1857] Oh you're clever.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1858] [laughing] Ah ah dear me [] .

               in through the hall way with [...] karate suit or something ...
               he was muttering to himself and he said smoking ... a healthy,
               dirty habit, it's expensive and it shortens your life ... I love
               it! [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [1861] [laugh] ... No it's dreadful ... [...] they are ... give
               it up but I said

Jean (PS04Y)   [1863] Oh no an it it's ... it's like slimming ... nobody should
               try to slim when they're feeling tense and agitated and worried
               about things.
Brenda (PS04U) [1864] I'll go up Tescos way ... sure it gets busy over here,
               dunnit though?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1865] Yes well
Brenda (PS04U) [1866] I mean it's not packed though, the shops weren't ... I
               mean tomorrow morning ... it'll be ... m murder there ... it'll
               be

Brenda (PS04U) [1872] come with the kids.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1873] No, no ... I'm looking forward to coming back here in the
               Spring ... and having another go at clothes for you and me ...
               I'm going to save like mad.
Brenda (PS04U) [1874] Might have won the [...] Jean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1875] Oh I
Brenda (PS04U) [1876] in the Spring.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1877] I should ... I should have some idea about selling the
               house.
Brenda (PS04U) [1878] We all know, sort of, what's, sort of , happening.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1879] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [1880] Cos, I mean you've got the feeling that, didn't you that
               ... Neil might move on.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1881] Nope ... I don't think he'll leave me until he marries.
Brenda (PS04U) [1882] No I don't ... apart from getting married I don't think
               he'll leave you!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1883] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [1884] I th I think though, you know, after a year or two if
               he'd moved away an ... if he moved out the area he would then
               break with his mother.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1885] Yes
Brenda (PS04U) [1886] It's the fact, that's how I see it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1887] I'm seriously
Brenda (PS04U) [1888] the fact
Jean (PS04Y)   [1889] thinking
Brenda (PS04U) [1890] mother was, sort , up in Wisbeach
Jean (PS04Y)   [1891] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1892] and I was in Surrey.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1893] That's right.
               [1894] A lot depends ... on ... what point I sell my house ...
               if I
Brenda (PS04U) [1895] What price you get.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1896] Yeah, if I sell at a time when there's still a recession
               on ... and you see ... somebody has to get my [...] they had a
               visit ... perhaps that was somebody that actually bought a
               house, not she not [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [1897] She
Jean (PS04Y)   [1898] they haven't to sold the house ... they had a visit from
               a Bank Manager ... her preferential mortgage treatment ... as
               part of their ... immonuments ... they always have had
Brenda (PS04U) [1899] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1900] the bank seems to pay the [...] a cripplingly low salary
               ... demand that everybody dresses in ... in Saville Row, but ...
               you could buy a house on a something like two and half percent
               mortgage ... well it's not like that now, but it's still ...
               still get a preferential mortgage ... and this banking person
               ... man was looking around only three or four weeks ago, but ...
               [...] ... you see a lot depends on your luck as to whether ...
               you pick up a ... a very good buyer.
Brenda (PS04U) [1901] Is your ... friends have they had anybody look at theirs
               yet?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1902] They had a couple of people round, but no ... no nibbles,
               or I think, yes, I think somebody a ... silly offer because of
               course all the ... property pages and places like that, Daily
               Telegraph are urging everybody, go on ... put in an offer for a
               house, put in a silly offer!
Brenda (PS04U) [1903] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1904] Which is all very well, but nobody's phoning in to accept
               a silly offer.
Brenda (PS04U) [1905] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1906] This is why, at the moment, I'm being a bit cautious
               about [...] remaining in my cavity ... I don't want to find
               myself in the situation that I'm held ... to sell.
Brenda (PS04U) [1907] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1908] That's why I'm so keen, I shall I tell you what my plan
               is, at the moment but as soon as the ... the uncourteous Bill
               ... has decided to ... move into his ... new house ... new flat,
               rather, I am going to take my ensuite back
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1909] yeah, I'm going to go back into my bedroom ... and Neil
               can still use the ensuite shower cos he's got the tip of the
               idea that he's got to come in ... clothed ... and knock on the
               door ... cos last time I was in my bedroom he asked if he could
               use the shower, [...] situation [...] ... he'd [...] you know,
               and I'd let him ... after all, it's not as though my be ,
               there's a door between my bedroom and the
Brenda (PS04U) [1910] Shower, that's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1911] the ensuite ... and er ... and then I will have three
               lodgers, I will have Neil
Brenda (PS04U) [1912] Mind you Neil's not worried about parading around with
               nothing on, is he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1913] Oh well I made him worry
Brenda (PS04U) [1914] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1915] my goodness, I have! ... [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [1916] Don't you like his new dressing gown, he was in
Jean (PS04Y)   [1917] Love that
Brenda (PS04U) [1918] last time?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1919] yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1920] What was he like, when you took ... cos you took the
               boxer shorts
Jean (PS04Y)   [1921] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1922] dressing gown and some
Jean (PS04Y)   [1923] all
Brenda (PS04U) [1924] silly bits, oh no sweets ... biscuits
Jean (PS04Y)   [1925] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1926] was it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1927] [...] some money, you spent on me ... ooh! [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [1928] I bet he was like a big child, was he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1929] Yes, of course he is, he is a poor child ... I hate to
               think what Christmas is like for some people.
Brenda (PS04U) [1930] Do you think she'll buy him something [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1931] I have no doubt wha did I not tell you about the fact
               that I hit the roof when he said that ... she has said that when
               he was twenty one, she was going to buy him a Vauxhall Chevette.
Brenda (PS04U) [1932] Sh she's going to?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1933] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1934] Well why didn't she pay for his lessons then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1935] Well that's I say
Brenda (PS04U) [1936] that's when he wanted help.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1937] I said it's sh I said, I he said don't you think it's a
               nice gesture?
               [1938] ... I think that is showing off!
               [1939] ... I said I [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [1940] How he's supposed to tax and insure it and run it? [...]
               have said!
Jean (PS04Y)   [1941] Well that's I said ... that's what I said an ... and I
               said where's she going to, where are we going to put it.
Brenda (PS04U) [1942] Just because you've passed your test doesn't mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1943] Oh I
Brenda (PS04U) [1944] I mean, it's years normally before someone can get a car.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1945] You can tell what sort of a
Brenda (PS04U) [1946] You can use [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1947] fool the woman is!
               [1948] ... She is dreadful!
               [1949] ... Does it strike an answering chord with your mother?
Brenda (PS04U) [1950] [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [1951] I have no doubt that if they owned their council house
               ... they would now be very busily ... selling and buying and
               [laughing] selling and buying [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [1952] She's ... sh she's a bitch, she's a oh has she still got
               that horse?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1953] Oh I have no doubt ... of course I never ... I despise
               the woman so heartily that I never ask any questions about it.
Brenda (PS04U) [1954] How does Neil get on with y Philip?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1955] Very well, they all three get on well together.
Brenda (PS04U) [1956] Oh they do?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1957] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1958] I was very surprised about Tony though.
Jean (PS04Y)   [1959] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1960] Cos I remember you saying about he didn't really want to
               know did he, about the ad er ... er
Jean (PS04Y)   [1961] Neil's boss, no ... no he said oh I think I'll wash my
               hands of Neil ... I thought that's another one ... If I don't
               stick by Neil
Brenda (PS04U) [1962] If he was still living with you ... he wouldn't wash his
               hands of Neil, would he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1963] He might have done, he's very a strong mighty chap and I
               don't know that ... anything I said could have influenced him
               ... and anyway Brenda to be perfectly honest I wo I wo
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1964] I wouldn't be doing it ... I wouldn't dare!
               [1965] ... I, I mean, I ... at the moment I'm not doing anything
               about Neil's training because ... we've got coming and it's ...
               it's too soon to start ... stirring up the bud again.
Brenda (PS04U) [1966] I think you probably could have stopped anyway [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [1967] Yes, quite, yes
Brenda (PS04U) [1968] you know, wouldn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1969] Exactly ... yes we'll take a breathing space until the
               new year ... I mean Neil says that at the moment he'd be quite
               happy to ... get into a job ... where if he was a good worker he
               could ... progress in the job ... and I said an what about doing
               your ... radio repairs in the evening, but he just, he said yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1970] I said, well was it like a part-time thing?
Jean (PS04Y)   [1971] Yeah well you see ... you can make quite a few ... nice
               little pounds for yourself ... if you can say to your friends
               ... I can undercut ... I won't chat while you get across here
               ... if you can say to your friends ... I can ... do it cheaper
               than the
Brenda (PS04U) [1972] Well you can it's like
Jean (PS04Y)   [1973] standard repair.
Brenda (PS04U) [1974] Dave ... these computer been ... you know ... up in the
               air for about six months and Dave said you've gotta get it
               repaired he said, cos you know y he's gotta print out on it and
               everything
Jean (PS04Y)   [1975] Aha, aha
Brenda (PS04U) [1976] a lot of his work is, sort of, rather than getting copies
               you just do a printout
Jean (PS04Y)   [1977] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1978] and erm ... you know, and I said Carla needs it for work
               ... anyway so Dave said I'm gonna while I'm on holiday I'm gonna
               do all the stupid jobs, so I can take that computer in
Jean (PS04Y)   [1979] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1980] and he said only cost about twenty cost about twenty five
               quid to get
Jean (PS04Y)   [1981] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1982] repaired
Jean (PS04Y)   [1983] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [1984] took it in and they said well they have to send it away
               and Dave said, yeah okay, he said well ... it's forty nine pound
               ... before you start
Jean (PS04Y)   [1985] Oh no!
Brenda (PS04U) [1986] and erm ... providing it's nothing, sort of major ... and
               that forty nine pounds will cover ... but if they find anything
               major they're ... it's on top of their forty nine pounds!
               [1987] ... And I said to Dave, you need somebody ... you know
               like a
Jean (PS04Y)   [1988] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1989] handyman or so something like Neil, I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [1990] Yes ... exactly.
Brenda (PS04U) [1991] to fix things like that
Jean (PS04Y)   [1992] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [1993] so that if they charge twenty quid ... when they start
Jean (PS04Y)   [1994] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [1995] you know, half the price
Jean (PS04Y)   [1996] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1997] you know that's
Jean (PS04Y)   [1998] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [1999] you could make the money up.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2000] Of course you can ... well I knew of a girl who married
               ... I wouldn't say she'd married well ... when she started out
               but her husband ... was enterprising ... e eventually got
               himself quite a good job at the ... at people who print the bank
               notes so so that they ... they started off in a ... prefab ...
               and they ended up with a new four bedroom ... bungalow with
               central heating ... at ... Athorpe ... Roding .
               [2001] And er I lost touch with her after that but Joyce was
               very nice, very, very ... a down to earth cockney girl from
               Hockston ... and she said er ... she'd tell her sister ... she
               said I do admire my sister she said they'll never have anything
               other than a council house, I don't suppose ... but she said ...
               my brother-in-law ... mends people's motorcycles ... as a side
               line ... and the money that he gets from that ... he gives her
               most of it ... and she buys things on hire purchase, this was
               the days when hire purchase wasn't ... fearsomely expensive
Brenda (PS04U) [2002] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2003] and she said my sister spends ... I mean, we're now
               talking about ... nineteen seventy ... my sister spends twelve
               and six a week ... on ... things from ... for the house ... on
               the hire purchase ... if she ever ... truly runs into debt
               she'll save ... part of the cost of the thing, you know ... and
               then she knows that she's always going to have to put twelve and
               six a week aside ... but she does that and buys things for the
               house ... and you see if you've got ... if you've got that
               little bit of extra coming in it's quite ... well it's like my
               lodgers, Brenda ... if I couldn't if I couldn't get ... what I
               need from my lodgers ... well Neil pays me ... Neil's house rent
               which thirty pound a week
Brenda (PS04U) [2004] And that's not very [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2005] No ... I stop
Brenda (PS04U) [2006] No
Jean (PS04Y)   [2007] when he gets another job ... when he gets a proper job,
               when he's employed it'll stop.
Brenda (PS04U) [2008] Oh I see.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2009] But at the moment I get thirty pounds a week
Brenda (PS04U) [2010] I see so if he gets
Jean (PS04Y)   [2011] and if he gets
Brenda (PS04U) [2012] some money coming in
Jean (PS04Y)   [2013] that's right, and he gets some unemployment money and I
               take ... ten pounds a week off him, for his food, I mean, it's
               not enough but it'll do, you know ... and then in dribs and
               drabs begrudgingly from that forty ... over the week ... once he
               starts to run out of money ... cos he's paid once a fortnight
               ... I begin to give him ... his karate money ... and ... here's
               two pounds fifty to go to the pub with Neil, you know, little
               bits
Brenda (PS04U) [2014] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2015] little bits, little bits ... and I'll buy you your
               tobacco Neil ... nothing much but ... little bits of something
               ... now if he were ... working and could give me the full sixty
               that is thirty for his room and thirty for his ... food ... so
               that I didn't have to worry about th ... actually paying for him
               ... but he was paying me ... Paul is going to pay me fifty ...
               that's thirty pounds in, I made a rule to Paul that he is going
               to eat thirty pounds worth of food ... and there are only twenty
               pounds in my profit ... and then the other rule, a man called
               Alan this window cleaner ... he wants the room ... that I'm in
               at the moment
Brenda (PS04U) [2016] Oh dear.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2017] because he doesn't want the ensuite, he can't afford it,
               he can't pay forty pounds a week
Brenda (PS04U) [2018] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2019] or thirty five, he wants to pay as little as possible.
Brenda (PS04U) [2020] What will you charge, twenty five for that one?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2021] Twenty five, yes an and for that ... he can make hims he
               doesn't want to to really to pay me for food at all so I'm going
               to tell him that he can have his cups, spare cups of tea and a
               drink of milk an ... and some toast.
Brenda (PS04U) [2022] Just bits and pieces
Jean (PS04Y)   [2023] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [2024] he doesn't want main
Jean (PS04Y)   [2025] No
Brenda (PS04U) [2026] meals, sort of thing.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2027] Or main meals , no ... but he can have that on the twenty
               five he needn't give me anything extra for that.
Brenda (PS04U) [2028] When's he moving in then? ... as soon as
Jean (PS04Y)   [2029] Well he was probably ... actually hammering on the door
               now to er come and see ... where he's going to put his ladders,
               he wanted er ... a bit of wall to put the brackets up to put his
               ladders ... but Paul said ... that ... he Paul thought you could
               suspend ropes from my garage roof, you remember ... what a lot
               of criss-cross bracing there is
Brenda (PS04U) [2030] Have you seen what we've done in our garage?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2031] No I haven't.
Brenda (PS04U) [2032] We took erm ... just wood beams across ... for canoes ...
               [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2033] Or if
Brenda (PS04U) [2034] might as well up there
Jean (PS04Y)   [2035] [...] Richard put over, put a lot of beams ... and Paul
               ... at the weekend put an immense amount of his ... household
               gear ... up on the roof ... in the garage.
Brenda (PS04U) [2036] In the garage, yeah ... that's what we did we [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2037] Yes
Brenda (PS04U) [2038] the ladder and
Jean (PS04Y)   [2039] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2040] everything on the beam.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2041] Yes ... well it's possible that er Alan may see a way to
               using that but ... he is quite ni , I mean he he's got no doubts
               he wants to come to me ... he's in a divorce at the moment and
               the moment that the final papers are signed, he's got to get out
               of the house ... he has to stay there till the last minute ...
               and then the moment that the papers are signed, he must go.
Brenda (PS04U) [2042] But what happens if Philip's still there?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2043] Well ... Alan says he'll sleep on my sofa.
Brenda (PS04U) [2044] On the sofa, for now, yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2045] I mean h he under he says this is, you know ... a very
               nice house ... and he wouldn't normally expect ... to get a room
               for twenty five pounds in a house of that character.
Brenda (PS04U) [2046] That's right ... but twenty five quid is a hundred quid a
               month, innit?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2047] Precisely!
               [2048] ... Well it's it's say I say I was ... doing my best, as
               it were, say that everything was going swimmingly ... I'd be
               getting a profit of thirty pounds from Neil ... twenty pounds
               from Alan because five will go on the tea and the milk and the
               box of Cornflakes and the toast ... er twenty, thirty [...] ,
               that's fifty ... and ... twenty for Paul which is ... seventy.
Brenda (PS04U) [2049] You get thirty from Paul, don't you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2050] No, he's going to give me fifty because, don't forget,
               he's in a small bed ... and he eats thirty pounds worth of food.
Brenda (PS04U) [2051] Twenty pound from [...] that's seventy quid.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2052] [...] ... exactly!
               [2053] ... The price is considerably better.
Brenda (PS04U) [2054] Two eighty a month.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2055] Exactly ... much, much, better than any pokes in the eye
               with a sharp stick!
Brenda (PS04U) [2056] So what does it ... did Philip pay up on time?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2057] Always excellent on that ... yes, he's a toad in some
               ways but in other ways he's very good.
Brenda (PS04U) [2058] What about ... Paul?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2059] Well he hasn't got any money, but when he's had it he's
               paid ... on the dot ... the only one
Brenda (PS04U) [2060] But hasn't he got that job still then?
               [2061] ... At [...] ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2062] He's only just started.
Brenda (PS04U) [2063] Oh he's just started.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2064] And he has to week before he gets any money ... he has to
               work a week in arrears, you know, they ... they [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [2065] So has he been there this week, Paul?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2066] Yes, he's been there this week [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [2067] Next week he'll get paid.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2068] money ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2069] So from next week you start getting paid.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2070] Yes ... and if that bloody Karen comes on the scene ...
               and wants to take him back I shall tell her, if you go back Paul
Brenda (PS04U) [2071] That's it!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2072] that's it, I'm having no more of it!
               [2073] ... I've had two lots of terrible upheavals.
Brenda (PS04U) [2074] Mm ... he can't, you know, he's
Jean (PS04Y)   [2075] He mustn't! ... [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [2076] That's right you're gonna, sort of,
Jean (PS04Y)   [2077] Build a trench ha ha oh ha oh oh ha ha.
Brenda (PS04U) [2078] Yeah he ... you can't keep on and on helping them out, I
               mean, they've gotta
Jean (PS04Y)   [2079] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [2080] [...] themselves I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [2081] Quite!
Brenda (PS04U) [2082] Shan't be sorry to see Philip go, will you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2083] Oh, I can hardly wait!
               [2084] ... I mean I ... I went in there ... yesterday, I think
               it was, or this morning [...] erm ... he put wet shirts into the
               wardrobe admittedly with the doors open ... but that bedroom is
               not a bedroom that I like to get any dampness in at all, Brenda.
Brenda (PS04U) [2085] Why does he just hang it ... you know ... put in the
               tumble dryer or hang it in the garage?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2086] Too lazy!
               [2087] ... Easier to do it that way!
Brenda (PS04U) [2088] Has Tony taken all his stuff out?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2089] Yes, he has at last.
Brenda (PS04U) [2090] Is he in his house yet or is he still in that
Jean (PS04Y)   [2091] Yes and he's very, very difficult to ... feed himself, to
               get the food in ... because, you know, he liked to come in a
               half past ten and bully me to cook things for him ... that's why
               sometimes I used to run up to bed and pretend I was ... asleep
               [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [2092] [laughing] Asleep [] .
               [2093] ... So what er ... so how does he cope now then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2094] Cos I thought that was a with a utmost difficulty ... and
               he has to get his little daughter on Sunday to help him to clean
               the place.
Brenda (PS04U) [2095] She'll soon get fed up with that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2096] Well ... tough he's not getting my, he's not getting the
               ensuite room, I can tell you ... If I if I have got three
               lodgers and I'm getting on with them and they're ... they're
               paying me regularly ... for the sake of an extra ... twenty
               pounds or whatever ... and the annoyance from Tony ... coming in
               ... at ten ... a or there abouts ... and then sitting there like
               a stuffed frock ... waiting for me to leap about and put food on
               a plate and microwave it ... not doing it, Brenda!
Brenda (PS04U) [2097] No ... you shouldn't, I mean you
Jean (PS04Y)   [2098] I mean I w when I was dropping dead with exhaustion one
               evening I said to him ... look Tony,the there's I've cooked a
               chicken, there's a big chicken cooling on the table ... and
               there there were ... red sauce, potatoes, gravy, I said, stick
               the lot on a plate a micro and, you know, film it over,
               microwave it ... oh well I shan't bother to eat anything ... now
               of course he was paying me for his food
Brenda (PS04U) [2099] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2100] and he was jolly well seeing whether
Brenda (PS04U) [2101] But if you'd said ... oh well I'll prepare, what about if
               I prepare you , oh yes well I'll have that ... probably if you'd
               got ... done it ... he'd have it because he had to help himself.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2102] Oh well I th I then said oh well ... I'll alright I'll
               fling it together for you ... oh good ... can you bring it into
               the sitting room?
               [2103] ... I very nearly brought it o
Brenda (PS04U) [2104] See don't.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2105] in the sitting room and banged it over his head!
Brenda (PS04U) [2106] Tell you something I'd like to pick up tonight [...] , if
               I see it ... is a blooming couple of trays.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2107] You know Paul has lent me ... some ... very clean ... but
               very ugly ... old fashioned trays of the sort that ... people
               have in restaurants ... that his mother ... lent him ...
               [laughing] and they're ... they're a God send [] !
Brenda (PS04U) [2108] I tell you really, I mean, I used to have one and went to
               look
Jean (PS04Y)   [2109] [...] beautiful trays in John Lewis's this morning ... I
               was licking my lips with desire, Brenda!
Brenda (PS04U) [2110] The amount of ti , sometimes I feel like a bowl of soup,
               especially with not being [...] , I felt like a bowl of soup and
               then
Jean (PS04Y)   [2111] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2112] not wanting to sit in the conservatory [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2113] It's cold.
Brenda (PS04U) [2114] winter ... and then, you know, you have to sort of use a
               plate to
Jean (PS04Y)   [2115] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2116] [...] and Dave said why don't we
Jean (PS04Y)   [2117] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2118] have a couple of trays, and I know it's so easy
Jean (PS04Y)   [2119] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2120] and we had a couple ... Mark's had them, I sa , but they
               wanted fourteen ninety nine.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2121] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2122] I mean they probably are quite expensive ... but I mean
               ... I I'm sure A and N or somewhere, Debenhams or somewhere
               would have them
Jean (PS04Y)   [2123] Debenhams probably, but the John Lewis's were excellent,
               and some ... some of them were tin and I do wonder if you're
               eating on your lap ... a tin tray might be rather cold ... but
               on the other hand, you let the heat from the plate through to
               your poor little legs.
Brenda (PS04U) [2124] I never noticed that!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2125] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [2126] All-weather pitch.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2127] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [2128] And we had one ... rugby pitch.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2129] Yes ... Is this where Jenny used to live, or still lives?
Brenda (PS04U) [2130] Up there by those weather boards.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2131] Oh yes ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2132] What about, have you heard from them lately?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2133] Yes she wrote to me, I'll tell you what when I get back
               I'll pop her letter in the post to you ... she seems alright.
Brenda (PS04U) [2134] Who Jenny?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2135] Yes, they've sti they've stayed together ... she still,
               mark you, in the letter she does come across as a misery guts.
Brenda (PS04U) [2136] They all do, don't they?
               [2137] ... What about [...] have you heard any more of her cos
               she was having trouble with her husband, wasn't she?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2138] Yes ... she still phoned me up in the morning and ... at
               vast expense to tell me how awful everything was.
Brenda (PS04U) [2139] Still bad is it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2140] Oh I phoned her back a few days later and said how are
               things now?
               [2141] Oh they're alright she said.
Brenda (PS04U) [2142] I expect Jenny, her kids are off at school now aren't
               they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2143] They are and I I think the whole trouble with Jenny was
               that ... not having, I mean, I was alright as a sort of mum
               subject ... I wasn't the same as a bona fide mum ... that could
               be called upon in all weathers, at all times, to do everything
Brenda (PS04U) [2144] I don't
Jean (PS04Y)   [2145] And I think she found looking after tiny children a bit
               too much for her.
Brenda (PS04U) [2146] Didn't like [...] ... she was more the career girl wasn't
               she, I think?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2147] She should have stayed in beauty therapy, she's a very
               gentle ... and she's very able.
Brenda (PS04U) [2148] She's very good at it wasn't she?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2149] Very good ... and kind ... and small children are cruel
               ... noisy ... and demanding, and unless
Brenda (PS04U) [2150] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2151] you've got ... a soul of ... steel, a heart of steel ...
               you can't cope with the buggers!
Brenda (PS04U) [2152] [...] the bath ... [...] off.
*** 27 (Tape 015106) ***
Dave (PS04V)   [2153] And obviously I think there was a little bit left in
               there.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2154] Yeah.
Dave (PS04V)   [2155] Cos you can't get your hand right to the bottom ...
               without a [...] I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [2156] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [2157] it shot down the hole.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2158] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [2159] So it's a right pain!
Brenda (PS04U) [2160] Unless there's a special fluid or something ... they
               could put it in there to wash through
Dave (PS04V)   [2161] You can't because it wouldn't come out through the taps
               would it?
               [2162] ... For someone like Nigel who's got all the tools ... it
               ... it'd be a ... a ... it's not a job you can come in and just
               do it ... cos you have to take a bit off ... clean it
Jean (PS04Y)   [cough]
Dave (PS04V)   [2163] and then [...] a bit more cleaning.
Brenda (PS04U) [2164] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [2165] I haven't got any of the tools.
Brenda (PS04U) [2166] Mm ... no but it even for a
Dave (PS04V)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [2167] plumber it's a big job.
Dave (PS04V)   [2168] Be a bloody long job!
               [2169] ... Well no not really cos you could find ... once you've
               found it, once he's, where you found the clog
Brenda (PS04U) [2170] So is that Lee, jacket that's got a hole in it?
Dave (PS04V)   [2171] Marked at the top and [...] , yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [2172] Why?
Dave (PS04V)   [2173] Well cos it had sunk and fallen, that's why [...] going
               ... cos the jacket had s ... fallen [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [2174] What the new jacket we got off Lee?
Dave (PS04V)   [2175] Yeah, it filled with water, it'd gone into the tank.
Brenda (PS04U) [2176] But why, why did it?
Dave (PS04V)   [2177] Well it must have had a split in or something.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2178] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [2179] The si it's all round the sides ... you don't really need
               a top on a tank, it's just the sides you want.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2180] Can you come on the neo have you come on the insurance?
               [2181] ... Can you come on Les and can he come on his insurance?
Brenda (PS04U) [2182] I doubt it.
Dave (PS04V)   [2183] [...] [...] I mean estimated
Jean (PS04Y)   [2184] Ah.
Dave (PS04V)   [2185] because Nigel like ... privately
Brenda (PS04U) [2186] We didn't, we haven't cos Les ... has to go through the
               ... books and charge
Jean (PS04Y)   [2187] Ah yes of course.
Brenda (PS04U) [2188] so we do it, we have like ... Nigel as our own plumber
Jean (PS04Y)   [2189] Ah yes, yes
Brenda (PS04U) [2190] and he doesn't charge, he charges still
Jean (PS04Y)   [2191] Mm yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2192] but not as much.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2193] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [2194] And me ... being a silly idiot, see if I'd realized ... I
               didn't think ... you don't think that there's three parts of the
               tank, you think it's a tank and you just turn your tap on and
               the water comes out ... or
Jean (PS04Y)   [2195] Do you know Dave ... I read erm ... we there's a magazine
               called Good Housekeeping ... and it's been going for ... it had
               been going for seventy years, last year it started in nineteen
               twenty one, women's magazine, very good one ... and they had a
               sort of seventieth birthday issue
Brenda (PS04U) [2196] Do you want a cup of tea now?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2197] and ... one woman said that the year, nineteen twenty one
               ... she was a bride of eighteen years old and she took Good
               Housekeeping and she's got the whole lot ... although she's now
               a very old lady, and she said ... my first lot of housekeeping
               was done in a ... house in Wales where we had water from the
               well ... we had to ... build the fires up by hand ... we could
               get Welsh coal cheaply ... but they had to ... you know ... use
               paper and kindle ... and we swept with brooms and my life has
               never been easier ... she said I had three children in four
               years and my life has never been easier ... she said and all
               these modern things came in ... life has [laughing] got more and
               more complicated and difficult [] !
Dave (PS04V)   [2198] You're not kidding ... he certainly ain't kidding you ...
               now now it's happened to me I know if it ever happened ... I
               know never to do it again.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2199] The the the buggeration of it ... is that ... the next
               time round that something goes wrong, it'll be again something
               that you've [laughing] encountered before [] !
Dave (PS04V)   [2200] Yes yes ... and me and [...] there's one
Brenda (PS04U) [2201] Bugger!
Dave (PS04V)   [2202] thing house, I never touched [...] electrics ... anything
               gas, electrics ... it's funny me and [...] are absolute
               disaster!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2203] Yeah ... yeah.
Dave (PS04V)   [2204] I mean whatever I touch
Jean (PS04Y)   [2205] Yeah.
Dave (PS04V)   [2206] with the plumbing it [...] so [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2207] Plumbing is very difficult ... erm
Dave (PS04V)   [2208] [...] ... I hate it!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2209] Years ago I had a class of very bright children ... and
               they did some really good projects, they weren't silly projects
               where they just scribble a bit an ... and draw some rubbish the
               they really worked ... and I saw to it that they produced really
               ... good work
Dave (PS04V)   [2210] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2211] and one boy chose to write about plumbing ... and do you
               know, he found that there was nothing written down about
               plumbing ... in the early nineteen seventies ... there were one

               ... everything out of there ... don't think they had many
               Christmas ... You used to ... was it you, you see you can make

Jean (PS04Y)   [2496] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2497] it was you
Jean (PS04Y)   [2498] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2499] did you use it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2500] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2501] For what?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2502] Well I tried to fix them on the door and they wouldn't
               stay
Brenda (PS04U) [2503] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2504] There was, unless I was prepared to put a ruddy great
               nail through my door ... I couldn't hang the thing!
Brenda (PS04U) [2505] What did you decorate them or did you just leave them
               plain?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2506] Well they were decorated weren't they, they were rings
               with and they had ... little tiny boxes, little coloured ...
               like little parcels sewn on.
Brenda (PS04U) [2507] Oh!
               [2508] ... Oh no I thought you bought just some plain green
               ones.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2509] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [2510] No?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2511] No ... no.
Brenda (PS04U) [2512] Perhaps we were going to and then decided
Jean (PS04Y)   [2513] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2514] against
Jean (PS04Y)   [2515] And I tried to fix it to the door ... and it wouldn't, I
               tried to do it up with Blu-Tack and would have none of it, I
               tried to do it with Sellotape and wouldn't do it ... the
               Sellotape kept on coming away ... something in the varnish I
               think that resisted that ... so then I thought, right I'll ...
               I'll tie the thing up in someway, I forget how, and blew away
               ... went down the drive!
Brenda (PS04U) [2516] [laughing] I didn't mean to laugh when you said it it
               blew away down the drive [] !
Jean (PS04Y)   [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [2517] [laughing] You can just imagine this bloody thing dri
               flying away down the drive [] !
Jean (PS04Y)   [2518] [laugh] yeah ... so I chased off after it ... one of the
               little boxes had come loose ... and ... carted it back to the
               house I said ... your going to be a Christmas decoration
               [laughing] whether you like it or not [] !
Brenda (PS04U) [laugh]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2519] So first of all I put it on a little er ... I've got a
               rather nasty little table that looks as though it ought to have
               a chamber pot underneath it ... you remember that nasty little
               wooden bedside table that I hate
Brenda (PS04U) [2520] Oh yeah, yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2521] so I put it on the top of there, every time anybody went
               by they knocked it off [...] !
Brenda (PS04U) [laugh]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2522] In the end I simply flung it on the
Brenda (PS04U) [2523] Away!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2524] middle of the dining room table
Brenda (PS04U) [2525] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2526] with cries of get on with it!
               [2527] ... That's half half the trouble with home decoration is
               ... it's not practical.
Brenda (PS04U) [2528] No, no I was gonna say some ... you know, just sort of
               just some ideas are good ... but I tell you haven't they got
               some beautiful erm ... candle holders around this year ... some

               five, it was that high
Brenda (PS04U) [2531] Was it that well that was quite good.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2532] and it was dark green ... oh it it's not bad but you know
               I'd just lost ten pounds to the taxi driver ... to him giving me
               the wrong change so I was feeling in a very frugal mood ... an
               and this the green of this candlestick holder ... you know what
               I call the old fashioned dark green, of some china?
Brenda (PS04U) [2533] Mm.

               central heating pumps are well hot, he said it shouldn't be like
               that ... so he to there's a little box up there he thinks it's
               probably this box ... but he's he's trying to figure out what it
               is up there because he's ... he's just such amazed at price of
               pieces
Jean (PS04Y)   [2680] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [2681] trying to work out exactly what's going round ... might
               have a
Brenda (PS04U) [2682] But did you tell tell him that, it doesn't get that hot
               in the conservatory?
Dave (PS04V)   [2683] No that's [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [2684] Nothing to do with that and the radiator key?
Dave (PS04V)   [2685] No, can't be that ... no don't worry about that.
Brenda (PS04U) [2686] It's a worry, isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2687] It is, I don't know.
Brenda (PS04U) [2688] I suppose even sort of, with a ... with a plumber, you
               know,y you don't ... I mean, I suppose they don't always know
               what they're looking for.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2689] Well no because ... unless they put the system in and
               know exactly what it was ... there are so many different ways of
               delivering water.
Brenda (PS04U) [2690] Mm, the thing is the guy that used to live here was such
               a bloody prat!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2691] Oh like Brian?
Brenda (PS04U) [2692] A didn't help chap!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2693] Oh ... oh my dear!
Brenda (PS04U) [2694] And the jobs we've found
Jean (PS04Y)   [2695] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2696] that that's gone wrong because he's a do-it
Jean (PS04Y)   [2697] Quite
Brenda (PS04U) [2698] yourself chap
Jean (PS04Y)   [2699] Quite ... yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2700] it's just totally unbelievable!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2701] Yeah ... well this is my ... this my
Brenda (PS04U) [2702] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2703] this is the story of my life ... now in the bathroom I
               have had, I have had to pay ... a hundred pounds to Mr Butcher
               the plumber ... to put in ... a new ... shower thing ... because
               that was ... cheap and rough and ... eventually wore out ...
               should never have been put in.
Brenda (PS04U) [2704] What about your leak that came through the ceiling, is
               that cleared now?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2705] Oh it's doing it again it's doing it again, dear ... oh
               yes, doing it again ... erm ... I had the plumber up to look at
               that ... cos I thought the plumbing was all wrong and he said no
               ... he said the plumbing is wrong ... the waste pipe of the ...
               en suite shower and the bath are connected, and they shouldn't
               be ... they should be separate, but they had been connected ...
               and that is bad ... but no, he said, what's happening is quite
               simple, he said erm ... the people using the en suite can't
               control the water it's going out ... he said the curtain doesn't
               fit flush against the wall, because the wall leans, you know
Brenda (PS04U) [2706] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2707] and he said water is getting out, he said tell people to
               be more careful and put towels all round ... so in my lovely en
               suite I've got old towels all round my ... surround
Brenda (PS04U) [2708] Oh!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2709] I love that
Brenda (PS04U) [2710] God!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2711] Brenda, I adore it, it's me all over ... so [...] the
               bathroom ... I had endless trouble, as you know, with Shirley
               ... I had to buy stuff and Shirley came in ... and I gave her
               ... little ... presents of this and that and helped her with
               cooking meals for her ... she re-grouted practically ... my bath
               tiles and my en suite tiles because we thought ... water was
               going through the wall, and it was ... and then I had to replace
               the ... where you take the plug out in the bath, I forget what
               you call that, the trap
Brenda (PS04U) [2712] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2713] all that has had to be replaced ... because that was
               starting to drip down into the hall, again!
               [2714] ... And then ... I had to th the shower just ... came,
               you know ... came to pieces in our hand, as it were it was not
               working as a shower ... so a plumber had to come ... Mr Butcher
               came into me
Brenda (PS04U) [cough]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2715] unscrewed the whole lot and he said this is cheap old
               rubbish!
               [2716] ... It's continental ... and is not ... is not U K ...
               and that was ... a hundred pounds, more or less for his ... fee
               and ... and buying a and buying at ... a discount through
               somebody who I knew ... buying this ... new shower ... and the
               tappy things, you know
Brenda (PS04U) [2717] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2718] the mixer things ... that's the bathroom.
               [2719] ... And the next thing that's going wrong in the bathroom
               ... will be that I'll have to replace that ... central heating
               pump.
Brenda (PS04U) [2720] Is that going wrong then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2721] It's it makes an awful noise ... in the morning!
               [2722] ... I I've got a bill to come in from the electrician for
               his call-out charge ... he diagnosed that it's was not an
               electrical fault ... and then thought it was an electrical fault
               by the noise, it was making a fizzing noise ... but he doesn't
               th he said it's, it's the pump ... the pump is ... on the way
               out ... it needs replacing ... house is built in nineteen eighty
               five!
               [2723] ... So ... the bedrooms ... and they're not too bad
               because he hasn't been able to do anything [laughing] in the
               bedrooms [] ... the bedrooms are alright ... except that over
               the lintels in most of the bedrooms ... the plaster ... is is
               not right, it's it's flaking in great lumps and rippling ... and
               cracked ... something to do with the
Brenda (PS04U) [2724] So was he the guy that did everything himself then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2725] Yes and he hadn't the faintest idea of how to do it!
Brenda (PS04U) [2726] But that ... flakiness and that is obviously when it was
               new ... he didn't let it dry out, he just painted
Jean (PS04Y)   [2727] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [2728] over it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2729] That's right ... so ... you then go into the en suite
               room, well I cannot tell you the trouble I've had from the en
               suite!
               [2730] ... Water pouring through into the kitchen ... water
               pouring down the electric wire of the lamp in the study!
Brenda (PS04U) [2731] What from there?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2732] Yes ... and ... eventually ... Shirley and I thought,
               well I mean, we spent weeks grouting, we grouted and we grouted
               ... and still water was coming through and we grouted and at
               last it seemed to be dry ... and the man came and did the re-
               artexing on the insurance ... and I had wa new wallpaper put up,
               for which I paid extra because he only allowed eight pounds a
               roll, the insurance company only ... pays eight pounds a roll
               ... and I had eleven pound wallpaper and a border ... and having
               got the whole thing up ... the s the patches have appeared
               again!
Brenda (PS04U) [2733] And they won't pay out again will they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2734] Oh no ... er ... and I
Brenda (PS04U) [2735] Did they come and check it ... first or they just
Jean (PS04Y)   [2736] No, no they just take your word for it ... and ... now I
               have got ... as I said, I've got ... that, I've got to paint
               that over ... and reseal and I've got to make sure that nobody
               makes a mess in there, but the plumber said ... what you really
               need to do ... is to get rid of this cheap and tatty, horrible
               ... plastic tray ... which doesn't come right to the edge of the
               tiles
Brenda (PS04U) [2737] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2738] and buy ... a screen ... five hundred pounds he says!
Brenda (PS04U) [2739] Mm, very clever isn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2740] I just looked at the man, I thought, I oh god I can't
               cope with this!
Brenda (PS04U) [2741] So you've just got a curtain round it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2742] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2743] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2744] So you come down the stairs ... and you come into the
               kitchen ... in the kitchen ... we start with the refrigerator
               being put next to the ... cooker
Brenda (PS04U) [2745] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2746] and I've had that taken out because I couldn't, I just
               could not stand it especially in hot weather!
Brenda (PS04U) [2747] You've got a new cooker haven't you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2748] I've got a a a well I got a new cooker ... had a have a
               new cooker because ... when they took the old one out it was
               already in seven separate pieces!
Brenda (PS04U) [2749] Those, bloody useless one though!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2750] He bought it off the town dump! ... so ... new fridge-
               freezer in the cu which is now free-standing in the corner ...
               bought it from Doug
Brenda (PS04U) [2751] Oh I've seen that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2752] you know ... reduced price ... but never-the-less money
               ... new cooker ... gas hob removed because that was going U S
               ... and an electric hob put in ... the formica in the kitchen,
               if you remember when you first saw me, it was tiles it wasn't
               formica, it was ghastly tiles ... and when Ned lifted all that
               out ... it was black with with rotten mould!
Brenda (PS04U) [2753] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2754] The man hadn't grouted ... the tiles in properly ... he'd
               used some sort of rough old cement and the water was just going
               through and staying there!
Brenda (PS04U) [2755] Oh my God!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2756] Fortunately ... Ned gave me that pink formica and the new
               sink as a present.
Brenda (PS04U) [2757] So you didn't to buy it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2758] Ha ... what else have we got?
Brenda (PS04U) [2759] Gas fire.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2760] The gas fire ... I have formed a really deep and
               meaningful relationship with ... Andy at Anglia Gas ... he's
               been back and forth to my house, I know all about the fact that
               he hasn't got a girlfriend ... and his mother is a marvellous
               cook ... and that Worlingworth is a bit off the map ... he and I
               are buddies, dear!
               [2761] ... I hate to think how much money I have paid over to
               Anglia Gas ... if I'd known what I was into ... I could have
               walked into that house then and I could, while I had all that
               money ... before I gave any ... away ... I could have said,
               right, I'm going to have to spend that, that, that, that and
               that ... and I would have done it and it would have ... I
               would've been ... alright because I wouldn't have had things
               going wrong!
Brenda (PS04U) [2762] Is it still working now, the fire?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2763] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2764] But after about three hundred quid innit?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2765] Ha ... I could have had a lovely new one!
Brenda (PS04U) [2766] That's th the trouble is they keep repairing, [...] they
               don't tell you this do they, I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [2767] No!
Brenda (PS04U) [2768] they could have, sort of, said look
Jean (PS04Y)   [2769] In the end I bullied Andy, I said, Andy there is
               something fishy about this fire ... he said well it's possible
               he said that ... it was erm ... a display model ... and every
               time anybody came in ... and needed a replacement part instead
               of sending for the part ... they took it out of the display
               model!
Brenda (PS04U) [2770] God, what was that bloke!
               [2771] ... Was he a youngster or what was he that lived in your
               house?
Jean (PS04Y)   [2772] Well youngish, he'd got youngish children, you know.
Brenda (PS04U) [2773] Blooming idiot, weren't he!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2774] Well ... totally!
               [2775] ... I mean ... next time I buy a house I shall say excuse
               me but are you a blooming [laughing] idiot? ... [...] [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [2776] Are you gonna be ... but these D A Y, D I Y
Jean (PS04Y)   [2777] Oh.
Brenda (PS04U) [2778] are okay if they know what they're doing, but I mean th
               this this guy, I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [2779] My lovely Gerald was very, very clever ... he was a
               mechanic, he was a graduate mechanical engineer ... and he knew
               everything about cars that needed to be known.
Brenda (PS04U) [2780] Mhm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2781] And he thought as a result that he knew about everything
               else as well and Brenda, he didn't.
Brenda (PS04U) [2782] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2783] Because another way in which I had to throw ... good
               money after bad was that after he died ... once I started having
               things done in the house ... they kept on turning up things that
               he had done that were absolutely N B G
Brenda (PS04U) [cough]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2784] the al do you remember those wires hanging about in
Brenda (PS04U) [2785] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2786] the kitchen?
               [2787] ... The electrician turned quite white when he saw them!
Brenda (PS04U) [2788] I know that was you ... but y you don't, I mean I
               remember u ... the fire we used to have here ... and it wasn't
               till I gave it to a friend, I mean we kept here for a year ...
               alright, lucky enough, we didn't use it ... anyway I gave to a
               friend who doing car boot, I found it in the attic an he said to
               me ... Brenda, he said, did you ever use this fire?
               [2789] ... He said well obviously you didn't, he said, cos you'd
               be dead!
               [2790] ... I said why I?
               [2791] ... He said, how are y he said the wiring on this, he
               said if you plug this in, he said ho , you'd electrocute
               yourself!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2792] I say!
Brenda (PS04U) [2793] I said, you're joking and I said they sell the house to
               you
Jean (PS04Y)   [2794] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2795] you know, and you
Jean (PS04Y)   [2796] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [2797] plug it in and they
Jean (PS04Y)   [2798] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2799] obviously just left it, luckily
Jean (PS04Y)   [2800] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2801] enough we did!
Jean (PS04Y)   [2802] I'm going to ask some very, very ... straightforward
               questions when I buy the next house
Brenda (PS04U) [2803] Well
Jean (PS04Y)   [2804] and I'm going to write down the answers they give me and
               get them to sign them ... because I have I have really been ...
               [laughing] beaten about the head by this [] !
Brenda (PS04U) [2805] Well it's, I mean, you know, it's ... I I don't think I
               could live with the conscience, if I was selling I would say
               well look
Jean (PS04Y)   [2806] No I couldn't ... I mean, and these people are Jehovah
               Witnesses who sold me this house ... and my feelings about the
               commercial probity of Jehovah Witnesses ... are that they
               haven't any commercial probity.
Brenda (PS04U) [cough]
Jean (PS04Y)   [2807] They're they're probably ... so wrapped up in their ...
               devotion ... that they don't bother about standard commercial
               morality, it was sh a shocking thing to do!
               [2808] ... I mean, if I were to sell my house now ... supposing
               somebody came galloping in ... along before Christmas ... ooh
               ooh I want the house on the first of Feb ... and ... they'd come
               and they'd see the house and they say yes I want it, want it,
               want it and it was plain that they were going to want it ... and
               we started to talk money, as soon as we'd got ... the solid
               block ... of money ... I want one O two ... you er ... estate
               agent tells me I can get ninety seven ... between ninety five
               and ninety seven ... say they offer me ninety six
Brenda (PS04U) [2809] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2810] say we'd be, you know, be ... fiddle around and get to
               ninety six ... I would then turn and say to them, I will give
               you five hundred pounds ... I will knock five hundred off that
               ... so that you can put in ... a proper shower tray ... and
               screen
Brenda (PS04U) [2811] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2812] put in by
Brenda (PS04U) [2813] That's it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2814] by Mick of Debenham ... because I understand from him
               that that is what's needed.
Brenda (PS04U) [2815] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [2816] I just would not
Brenda (PS04U) [2817] But even if you didn't sell, I mean but, death trap
               things ... electrical things, I mean ... you would
Jean (PS04Y)   [2818] Quite!
Brenda (PS04U) [2819] sort of feel ... you know, I mean, I've known people
               where, I mean, it was like us the day we moved in here
Jean (PS04Y)   [2820] Your conscio as you say
Brenda (PS04U) [2821] went to bed that night and thought [sniff] ... gas, you
               know ... and the blooming boiler, lucky it didn't blow up!
               [2822] I mean it had all, it had gone!
               [2823] You know, I mean, the next day we had the gas man out
Jean (PS04Y)   [2824] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [2825] and said we , you know,we we ... lucky we weren't gassed!

               Marks where they ... always have every possible man's suit that
               Marks make ... and ... and he takes the time to buy two or even
               three ... because he doesn't get that much time for shopping.

Brenda (PS04U) [3233] again?
Dave (PS04V)   [3234] you haven't got any hot water at the moment that's why I
               said ... that should ... well I would have thought he did it ...
               but you got no hot water then that should keep going until the
               water stops.
Brenda (PS04U) [3235] No it doesn't ... you run the top tap now ... in the
               kitchen, turn it off ... that will ignite and come on ... go and

               keep coming on and off all the time ... till it's hottened up.

Carla (PS04X)  [3307] [...] black
Jean (PS04Y)   [3308] Yes you don't have to paint it.
Brenda (PS04U) [3309] You put some insulating tape round it cos that peels off.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3310] Mm.
Carla (PS04X)  [3311] Wasted it ... it's for the house innit?
Jean (PS04Y)   [3312] Well it won't be

Brenda (PS04U) [3318] Well alright I'll get you some.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3319] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [3320] Rather than paint it cos I I wanna use that again.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3321] Ooh yes, it's very good that ... there [...] cos they're
Carla (PS04X)  [3322] I don't have to do it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3323] six pounds.
Carla (PS04X)  [3324] again ... but I might be.
Brenda (PS04U) [3325] Well I think it looks good but like that cos it looks
               like clear water.
Dave (PS04V)   [3326] Why don't you use
Jean (PS04Y)   [3327] Yes it does

               box.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3331] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [3332] And let that sit in the shoe box and then tape the shoe
               box.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3333] Yeah.
Carla (PS04X)  [3334] It's too fat to be in a shoe box.
Brenda (PS04U) [3335] No I don't think it is.

               Gill, I'll tell him tonight ... erm ... she's going over there
               at two and coming back at three thirty ... and she wanted Lee to
               go, like, at three thirty ... and she'd bring him back at half
               past eight at night.

Brenda (PS04U) [3397] what ... he can say that ... he'd go with her but he'd
               had to be back, sort of, by four ... cos he's going out with you

Dave (PS04V)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [3400] about ten thirty ... what time's he coming in tonight?

               his bike in, I thought perhaps he ain't gotta key ... [...]

Carla (PS04X)  [3505] [whispering] Monday [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [3506] Is everybody gonna do it or is it your choice if you do
               it?

               last one [...] ... I'll model it this time, it's good fun!
Jean (PS04Y)   [3508] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [3509] If you use the
Carla (PS04X)  [3510] So this one looks better?
Brenda (PS04U) [3511] You said you had to model it ... but make it, squeeze it
               in the middle so it's fatter at the ends ... that's it, so it
               looks like a ... canoe
Dave (PS04V)   [3512] Bren!
Brenda (PS04U) [3513] paddle, yeah.
Dave (PS04V)   [3514] What's that [...] back of your car?

Jean (PS04Y)   [3521] Oh I don't know really ... I haven't thought.
Carla (PS04X)  [3522] I got a bit left over from when I cut it ... I'll just
               bring it in ... this bit, there.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3523] I've sort of squeezed the tin foil ... so that it it fits
               very, very tightly around the middle.
Carla (PS04X)  [3524] Oh ah!
Jean (PS04Y)   [3525] And then it bulges at the end, you see, that'll do ...
               cos if you
Carla (PS04X)  [3526] What about if I do an extra bit at the end?
Jean (PS04Y)   [3527] Well I don't think it'll be a good idea at all because
               ... my no my knowledge of tin foil leads me to believe ... that
               tin foil ... wrapped on tin foil ... falls off.
Carla (PS04X)  [3528] Oh!
Jean (PS04Y)   [3529] I think you'll be better off with it like that.
Carla (PS04X)  [3530] Where's my [...] ?

               cancer
Brenda (PS04U) [3717] and cancer, that's right, I remember you saying
Jean (PS04Y)   [3718] and years ago ... Doctor said to me ... if you start to

               girl so he said if you start to lose weight and you can't

Jean (PS04Y)   [3722] and we'll catch it early ... and so I haven't ... been,
               sort of, saying to myself ooh I've lost some weight, I'll try to
               lose more ... at the moment I'm not worrying too much about what
               I eat
Brenda (PS04U) [3723] I wasn't when I lost it!
Jean (PS04Y)   [3724] Because I can't ... I can't eat all that much
Brenda (PS04U) [3725] No ... when I lost it I th I don't want to be this thin I
               want to put it on again.

               Wednesday ... er for meal ... and she's been saving Daily
               Telegraph vouchers ... and when you got so many vouchers you
               send them up to the Daily Telegraph, who's sent them, it's
               offers closed now and they send you a thing like a ... credit
               card ... and they send you a list of all the places that you can
               go to ... for a half- price meal

Brenda (PS04U) [3733] Oh that's free.
Jean (PS04Y)   [3734] and that comes free, that's right, that comes free ... so
               two people go out and they share the cost of the meal.
Brenda (PS04U) [3735] Oh that's a good idea, isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [3736] I couldn't eat the damn meal ... I had erm ... steak and
               kidney puddings, no steak and kidney pastry pie.

Jean (PS04Y)   [3742] They are ... erm it was er steak and kidney pie, brussels
               sprouts, carrots and bo plain boiled potatoes ... I could only
               eat about half the kidney and meat, I cou I could only eat about
               a third of the pastry, couldn't cope with the carrots at all or
               the brussel sprouts, they were beautiful brussel sprouts ...
               like little cabbages, you know ... I could only eat a couple of

               [4111] ... Yeah well that's eighty nine plus there's fifteen
               percent off.
Lee (PS04W)    [4112] What are the ones that the Italians wear called?
               [4113] Special ones.
Brenda (PS04U) [4114] What do you call the double-breasted Italian suits? ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [4115] Don't remember. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [4116] But what I'll do is, if tomorrow I get time ... I'll have
               a look in erm ... Top Shop.
               [4117] If I'm over that way.
               [4118] And if there is any decent suits then I'll let you know.
Lee (PS04W)    [4119] Mhm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4120] And then ... if you don't get it tomorrow perhaps one
               night after school
Lee (PS04W)    [4121] It might be easier just to hire one.
Brenda (PS04U) [4122] No.
               [4123] Why pay fifty quid to hire one?
Jean (PS04Y)   [4124] It's ridiculous.
Lee (PS04W)    [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [4125] When you're gonna pay seventy five quid and you've got
               one.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4126] Mm.
               [4127] Mm
Lee (PS04W)    [4128] Yeah but where am I gonna wear it again?
               [4129] I'll ... would ... outgrown it within a few months.
Brenda (PS04U) [4130] Well no you buy a size bigger.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4131] Oh definitely yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [4132] You like them bigger.
               [4133] I mean you buy it you're not gonna, I mean ... alright
               you're gonna have a bit more grown but you're only gonna get a
               bit more muscly.
               [4134] And you like them baggy anyway, you don't get one that
               fits you er buy ... That's why I said it would have been
               probably better to pay the extra twenty quid and bought the
               Italian style double- breasted
Jean (PS04Y)   [4135] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4136] for their baggy effect see.
Lee (PS04W)    [4137] Yeah but where can you buy them? ...
Brenda (PS04U) [4138] Tut ... that shop next door to ... erm Intersports. ...
Lee (PS04W)    [4139] Suit and Co ... I think that's called.
Brenda (PS04U) [4140] No.
               [4141] That it's a nice man's shop.
               [4142] It's a beautiful man's shop.
Lee (PS04W)    [4143] Yeah I know.
               [4144] It's dear.
Brenda (PS04U) [4145] Yeah but I don't, see savings they've got on suits at the
               moment, special offers on them cos they're not shifting them.
               [4146] ... But it's ridiculous you [...] fifty quid a night to
               hire a suit.
               [4147] ... Because you pay your fifty pound and that's it.
               [4148] ... But this suit, I mean.
               [4149] That's what I said if you buy a grey suit ... the
               trousers ... you'll, I mean alright if you don't, I mean you'll
               wear, grey won't date.
               [4150] Will it Jean?
Jean (PS04Y)   [4151] No.
               [4152] No.
               [4153] It never dates.
Brenda (PS04U) [4154] Green will date.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4155] Yes.
               [4156] And you'll get bored with it.
Brenda (PS04U) [4157] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4158] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [4159] But grey will not, I mean Granddad Sid's
Jean (PS04Y)   [4160] Goes on forever.
Brenda (PS04U) [4161] sixty five and he's still wearing his grey suits.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4162] Yes.
               [4163] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [4164] I mean dad got married in his suit.
               [4165] I mean now he's given it to granddad.
               [4166] But grey, the actual
Lee (PS04W)    [4167] It doesn't fit him.
Brenda (PS04U) [4168] Yeah it doesn't fit him.
               [4169] I mean it hasn't, I mean dad's was quite an expensive
               suit when he got married.
               [4170] ... I mean alright that's eighteen years ago.
               [4171] And the trous I mean the jacket never ... I mean very
               rarely does a suit jacket style change.
               [4172] The trousers you get flared, but that's no problem cos
               you just have them altered.
               [4173] If you have them ... you know I mean I can't see, I mean
               you wear your trousers baggyish and long .
Jean (PS04Y)   [4174] It's not it's not time for flared trousers yet.
Brenda (PS04U) [4175] No.
               [4176] That's what
Jean (PS04Y)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [4177] I'm saying.
               [4178] It's not time.
Lee (PS04W)    [4179] And I haven't got no shoes to go with ... whatever I get.

               that.

Jean (PS04Y)   [4228] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4229] Perhaps you can have them for Christmas or something.
               [4230] Erm ... so we've managed to hire everything so all you've
               gotta, you've gotta buy is your moonboots.
Lee (PS04W)    [4231] Mhm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4232] Erm ... the suit you've got to have.
               [4233] You've got to have [...]
Lee (PS04W)    [4234] I've got to have that by December the thirteenth.
Brenda (PS04U) [4235] Yeah well ... if we don't get it tomorrow we'll have to
               go one night, it's late night shopping till nine o'clock.
Lee (PS04W)    [4236] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4237] If dad's on his half past four, if he can get to kip ...
               if you go over at seven o'clock one night.
               [4238] It's not gonna take you, it's only gonna take you and dad
               an hour isn't it?
Lee (PS04W)    [4239] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4240] But he's got to do it on Access because ... there's no
               money in the bank to write a cheque out and pay for the suit.
               [4241] So I can't go and do it.
Lee (PS04W)    [4242] Have I got any cash cards?
Brenda (PS04U) [4243] No and you're not having cash cards either.
Lee (PS04W)    [4244] Why?
Brenda (PS04U) [4245] What do you want a cash card for?
Lee (PS04W)    [4246] No it's [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [4247] You can't draw out cash if it isn't there.
               [4248] And, and that's the trouble with the cash card.
               [4249] You you tend to think [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [4250] You can't have a cash card with a post office account
               anyway.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4251] No.
Lee (PS04W)    [4252] No with the Alliance though.
Brenda (PS04U) [4253] Yeah but what do you wanna cash card for?
Lee (PS04W)    [4254] So I can get money out if I ever need it.
Brenda (PS04U) [4255] Yeah but that money is, you've saved ... and I mean nan
               put that in when you were younger too, a lot of it.
               [4256] So I mean it's for when you're older.
               [4257] When you're desperate, you need it, not to just draw out
               and spend.
Lee (PS04W)    [4258] I know.
               [4259] I won't just draw out and spend.
Brenda (PS04U) [4260] No you don't
Jean (PS04Y)   [4261] You will you know.
               [4262] I'm the expert on that.
Brenda (PS04U) [4263] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4264] I've drawn out and spent.
               [4265] Because it was there.
               [4266] I I mean it's ever so difficult to resist the temptation
Brenda (PS04U) [4267] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4268] to spend money.
Brenda (PS04U) [4269] It it, it's like me.
               [4270] If I had an Access card ... I would buy him this that and
               everything.
               [4271] And I'd say oh come on we'll buy the suit.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4272] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4273] And then right, and then you can also buy ... the shirt
               and tie.
Lee (PS04W)    [4274] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [4275] You can afford that.
               [4276] Cos you've got all that money saved.
               [4277] We've had to sponge off him all week.
               [4278] Borrow all his money.
               [4279] And it ended up we owed him say ninety quid.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4280] [laughing] I know.
               [4281] I know [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [4282] Mind you he went out and he had to have er ... erm mind
               you he's had that, when you think of it you've had half of that
               back.
               [4283] I said to Dave ... I said how have you spent all that
               money?
               [4284] He said I've been giving Lee dinner money every day.
               [4285] I said well I wondered, he didn't ask me for it.
               [4286] I said I thought he was using his own.
Lee (PS04W)    [4287] No ... all he's given me each day is paper money ... plus
               about one fifty.
               [4288] So all together [...] given me about five pounds.
Brenda (PS04U) [4289] Yeah well it adds up.
Lee (PS04W)    [4290] Yeah I know.
Jean (PS04Y)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [4291] And we had to pay fifteen quid for the train ticket.
               [4292] So that's another twenty quid.
               [4293] We've gotta [...] pay for your computer.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4294] It adds up dreadfully .
               [4295] I mean I'm subbing one ... well I'm subbing two of my
               lodgers.
               [4296] I'm subbing Neil ... but that's out of money which he
               gives me and which really in theory ought to be for my own, own
               use you know for fun but ... I get housing benefit for him, from
               the council.
               [4297] And most of that goes back to him for his karate and a
               ... pint of beer in the pub.
               [4298] And I, I sort of dole out a little here and a little
               there.
               [4299] And I'm also subbing my lodger Paul.
               [4300] ... Erm and it, it it mounts up.
               [4301] By the time you've bought them some cigarettes and given
               them some ... money for the [laughing] pub [] and said well if
               there er and the car hasn't got any petrol so you pay for ten
               pounds worth of petrol.
               [4302] You're through fifty pounds before you can blink an
               eyelid.
Lee (PS04W)    [4303] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [4304] It's one of the ... well known things about money.

               [4316] That was it, wasn't it Brenda?
               [4317] ... No more because I then paid another thirty ...
               approximately for that two hundred and eighty nine ... for that
               [...] that, that came to twenty seven and I had ... there were
               two items inside it, I forget what they are.
               [4318] ... There's another nearly thirty pound cheque on top of
               the ... Marks and Spencer charge card.

               [5110] I was not well enough.
Brenda (PS04U) [5111] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5112] Er I mean if he were responsive and would work and would
               try things for himself ... but it, it's, it's like hacking at
               concrete with a knife.
Brenda (PS04U) [5113] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5114] Terrible.
               [5115] Terribly hard work.

Jean (PS04Y)   [5132] There are two of them.
               [5133] There's Beverley and Gail.
               [5134] Gail sometimes does my hair but she's a learner and I get
               her more cheaply.
               [5135] I think a corn dolly for Gail.
               [5136] ... Mm so that's corn dolly accounted for isn't it?
Brenda (PS04U) [5137] That's both corn dollies.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5138] That's my lot.
               [5139] And for Beverley ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5140] Who's she then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5141] That's the main hairdresser, the one who ... usually does
               my hair.
               [5142] Beverley and Gail work together you see.
Brenda (PS04U) [5143] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5144] Gail is her apprentice as it were.
Brenda (PS04U) [5145] Why don't you give that one to Beverley?
               [5146] And just give something sma cos you're gonna [...] .
               [5147] Have a tin of, have a pack of my chocolates ... and give

Jean (PS04Y)   [5150] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5151] Cos they're, I mean they're nice sort of wrapped up.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5152] Yes.
               [5153] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5154] Cos it's silly to make a thing out more than what you
               need.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5155] Mm.
               [5156] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5157] [...] that's corn doll ... swiss chocolate.

Jean (PS04Y)   [5160] Mm.
               [5161] Mm.
               [5162] Yes I know.
               [5163] Yeah. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5164] Ah yes I, I, I [...] but I'm gonna get [...] aren't I?
               [5165] Instead.
               [5166] Right so that's your hairdressers.
               [5167] That's about it isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5168] I think so.
Brenda (PS04U) [5169] What about that other lodger [...] ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5170] Oh I hope he'll be gone by Christmas.
               [5171] ... I think he'll be, I think he'll be ... moving out
               probably at the end of the, I told him I wanted a week's notice.
               [5172] I, I asked him a couple of weeks or ten days back.
               [5173] I said oh by the way when are you leav intending to move
               out?
               [5174] And he said the ... they were pressing him for completion
               ... that very minute.
               [5175] You see nowadays the solicitors are falling over
               themselves to do the conveyancing.
               [5176] Whereas when you and I were buying houses it was ... oh
               it's a long process and it can't be hurried.
               [5177] Now they're just desperate.
               [5178] And I, he said something about, muttering something about
               before Christmas.
               [5179] I hope he is gone before Christmas.
Brenda (PS04U) [5180] We won't put him down anyway.
               [5181] Who've you got for [...] ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5182] I can't be bothered.
               [5183] I really cannot be bothered.
Brenda (PS04U) [5184] [...] left.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5185] I tell you what I might do tomorrow.
               [5186] I might buy a couple more odds from Marks.
Brenda (PS04U) [5187] You've got no odds left.
               [5188] We've used all your odds.

               something ... er a tin of sweets is acceptable to both ... to
               both sexes isn't it?
               [5190] Well what, what was that, what was the price of that red?
Brenda (PS04U) [5191] This?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5192] No the red tin.
Brenda (PS04U) [5193] Two fifty.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5194] No that'll do fine.

               don't see a lot of them but they ... they are my opposite
               neighbours and of course the 's really ... I'm on good terms
               with I ought to give them ... I'll get them a tin of biscuits as

               very clean but he's not a good housewife.
               [5355] So nothing white will come out dazzling.
Brenda (PS04U) [5356] Right.
               [5357] Erm ... so Ron, Terry slippers.
               [5358] Marks and Sparks.

Brenda (PS04U) [5362] Right so erm ... M and S we'll put in [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5363] Yes I'd love to think that I can struggle back with the
               tree.
               [5364] But I'm not sure that I could. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5365] With what?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5366] I'm very tempted.
               [5367] ... By the time everything is packed into that bag ...
               that's going to be heavy but on the other hand I'm going to have
               taxis.
               [5368] On Waterloo on Sunday I'll be able to get a taxi very
               easily [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [5369] [...] yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5370] Erm ... if they can tie a a handle on to the tree ... If
               they're selling them in Guildford Marks.
               [5371] If they're selling those imitation trees, and if they've
               got that wonderful one that looks like a real tree ... if they
               can say to me yes, we can ... rope it up for you in such a way
               that it's got a handle on it.
               [5372] I could carry it back.
Brenda (PS04U) [5373] Well it has.
               [5374] In the box it's got a handle.
               [5375] It's one of those plastic ... boxes.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5376] Oh well, there.
               [5377] Yeah.
               [5378] And what I'll do is, I'll not only pack my Christmas
               presents into that.
               [5379] I'll also pack everything that's in that little black ...
               little black bag.
               [5380] Everything I've brought with me.
Brenda (PS04U) [5381] You won't get it all in that. ... [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5382] Well I think that probably Neil's clothes will have to go
               back in a Marks and Spencers
Brenda (PS04U) [5383] Right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5384] one of those bags, don't you think?
Brenda (PS04U) [5385] Mm. [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [5386] Well I think ... see [...] cos you're gonna get, alright
               tomorrow they're all little things.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5387] They're tiny.
Brenda (PS04U) [5388] Tiny things.
               [5389] Erm ... see how you pack it.
               [5390] See what you get tomorrow.
               [5391] I mean ... the tree's not desperate to get [...] .
               [5392] You can get it ... if you've got
Jean (PS04Y)   [5393] If the worst comes to the worst I can do without that.
               [5394] I can er either buy one in Asda or somewhere or forget
               about it and have a fresh tree.
               [5395] But I've had fresh trees since I've been in ... in
               Stowmarket and I've, I've come to hate them.
               [5396] They're, you know ... you, you get the earth you, Richard
               usually goes and gets the earth for me.
               [5397] Drops half of it all over the carpet as he's bringing it
               in.
Brenda (PS04U) [5398] Yes.
               [5399] Too much bloody mess [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [5400] And have you ever put a tree ... a Christmas tree in a
               tub and packed earth round it and got the bloody thing to stand
               up straight?
Brenda (PS04U) [5401] No.
               [5402] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5403] Not on your nelly!
Brenda (PS04U) [5404] But that ... I mean where do you [...] nearest M and S?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5405] Norwich is the best.
               [5406] Ipswich is the nearest.
               [5407] ... Norwich is the better bet because Ipswich is being
               redeveloped ... and only about ... a third of the space at the
               moment is being used for the, for shopping.
               [5408] I don't know whether they'll have managed by Christmas to
               get it all done.
               [5409] They were ... expanding.
Brenda (PS04U) [5410] The thing to do ... perhaps ... tomorrow morning ... to
               phone Ipswich ... Marks to see if they've got them in stock.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5411] Good idea.
               [5412] [...] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5413] But I think you're gonna have enough to carry back
Jean (PS04Y)   [5414] I think so.
Brenda (PS04U) [5415] without lugging that big box .
Jean (PS04Y)   [5416] I I don't think I could manage it.
               [5417] I can see ... [...] fits being had by [...] party.
Brenda (PS04U) [5418] [...] presents than worry about the tree at the moment.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5419] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5420] Cos you've gotta, I mean [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5421] I love that tree.
               [5422] I fell in love with that [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [5423] I know you did dear.
               [5424] But you can't even leave it down here and pick it up
               later
Jean (PS04Y)   [5425] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [5426] because it'll be too late.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5427] No.
               [5428] I, I want it for Neil and ... Paul and even for [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [5429] Well why don't you get him to, can't you go with, take
               Neil into Norwich?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5430] Mm.
               [5431] I can
Brenda (PS04U) [5432] And get him to carry it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5433] I can get, you see Mark will ... Mark will do anything at
               the moment cos he's quite interested in me.
Brenda (PS04U) [5434] Well phone, if it comes to it phone Mark at Norwich and
               ask him to deliver one.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5435] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5436] Alright might cost you an extra fiver.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5437] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5438] But it's worth it cos you, you wouldn't get there in
               petrol ... and back would you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5439] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [5440] Right let's just go through the rest of this.
               [5441] Jean to get.

               [5443] Erm ... Marge, something small.

               [5450] ... Actually, are we going in to Marks again tomorrow?
Brenda (PS04U) [5451] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5452] I think that Marks' winter tights will probably be
               better.
Brenda (PS04U) [5453] Okay.
               [5454] ... [...] ... Er ... Jackie?

Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5468] how tight Mike was going to be with ... you know having
               to look after Paul and all the rest of it I promised I'd take
               him to ... Snetterton market and he could have, he was going to
               buy some ... records.
               [5469] But er ... oh yes I might still do that.
               [5470] [...] talk to him very seriously.
               [5471] Talk to ... myself very seriously.
               [5472] ... No but there, there aren't any ... there didn't seem
               to be any concerts ... erm happening within the vicinity.

               [5474] And I, I suspect that they're on their way out because
               the way they ... leap and scream and bang and thump ... I should
               think that they [...] , most of them have been on drugs.

               itinerary of their, of their tour.
               [5476] This, this group that he's so fascinated by.

Jean (PS04Y)   [5487] Yes.
               [5488] Punishing schedule of work.
Brenda (PS04U) [5489] There are stupid people that [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5490] I suppose they're making the money.
Brenda (PS04U) [5491] Yeah aren't they?
               [5492] Right Bob and Glynis, tin of biscuits.
               [5493] The tin of biscuits.
               [5494] They're all Stowmarket?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5495] Yes.
               [5496] ... I couldn't contemplate hauling that lot back. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5497] Simon ask Richard.
               [5498] That's Stowmarket isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5499] Mm. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5500] Well you've got ... all you've got left, you've got my
               presents to get tomorrow.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5501] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5502] And ... that leaves you with just five in Stowmarket.
               [5503] Wine and some biscuits.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5504] That's not bad is it?
Brenda (PS04U) [5505] No
Jean (PS04Y)   [5506] I mean they're going to be very easy to buy. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5507] And you've bought eighteen presents today.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5508] Oh my goodness!
Brenda (PS04U) [5509] Eighteen people.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5510] I say!
               [5511] [...] . That's amazing isn't it?
Brenda (PS04U) [5512] So you had thirty four people this year to buy for.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5513] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5514] [...] but I mean if you'd bought all the extras, last
               year you had about fifty.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5515] Yes. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5516] So tokens are small, [...] , paperback will be small,
               calendar will be small.
               [5517] So they're not major presents
Jean (PS04Y)   [5518] No they're not.
               [5519] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [5520] tomorrow.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5521] They're not weighty ones.
               [5522] Brenda ... could you pass me up my, my box of, of er
               coloured ribbons and things.
               [5523] I just want to love and admire it.
               [5524] [laugh] . It's so Christmassy!
               [5525] ... [...] . It's got gift tags hasn't it, as well as
               pretty.
               [5526] Ah.
               [5527] ... Incidentally I was glad that although I didn't feel
               ... one hundred percent I was glad that I wandered round
               Liberties.
               [5528] Because I went up to their fabric department [...] and
               ... I want to ... after Christmas I'm going to wash all the
               covers on the ... er settees, you know er ... the dralon.
               [5529] And I want to make if I can a couple of ... deeper
               coloured cushions and if I can ... I want to make tie-backs for
               the curtains because everything in that room is so blooming
               pale.
Brenda (PS04U) [5530] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5531] Well Liberties sell a fabric that they call ... poult, P
               O U L T ... for what was it?
               [5532] Two fifty.
               [5533] And they had acetate at four fifty.
               [5534] And they had the most marvellous colours.
               [5535] I think that they only intend them for linings.
Brenda (PS04U) [5536] Oh that's what I wanna get.
               [5537] Some of that tomorrow.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5538] Well I will get some too.
               [5539] Put it down on my side as well.
               [5540] ... Because I'm not going to buy any more tree
               decorations this year.
Brenda (PS04U) [5541] No.
               [5542] I'm [...] .
               [5543] Either last year or the year before.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5544] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5545] Now shall we see what we can get in this bag?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5546] Yes please.
Brenda (PS04U) [5547] Right.
               [5548] ... Oh it's got a little padlock.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5549] Yes.
               [5550] Isn't it lovely!
Brenda (PS04U) [5551] Has it got a key though?
               [5552] ... No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5553] No it's just a little neat ... pretty thing.
Brenda (PS04U) [5554] Actually you have got a key.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5555] [laughing] Oh how nice [] .
               [5556] I thought it was just a decoration.
Brenda (PS04U) [5557] No.
               [5558] You've got two keys.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5559] Well I never. [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [5560] [...] gonna love that.
               [5561] Now if anybody pinches it ... alright they can ... break
               it, but
Jean (PS04Y)   [5562] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5563] I'd leave the two big baskets will probably, I think all
               the smaller things in here.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5564] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5565] Do you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5566] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5567] [...] stand up.
               [5568] ... [...] ... [...] ... [...] ... That's it isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5569] What about the erm ... the baskets, the toiletries.
               [5570] What do you think to do with those?
Brenda (PS04U) [5571] I think put them ... in case in the Marks and Sparks bag.
               [5572] Cos they're quite heavyish.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5573] They are aren't they?
               [5574] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5575] Pack them very tight ... in one bag. ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [5576] Mm. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5577] These are gonna be the most awkward things.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5578] I wondered if they would go in there.
Brenda (PS04U) [5579] No.
               [5580] See.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5581] Mo.
               [5582] Just won't.
               [5583] ... Oh they do.
               [5584] ... Well that's very clever Brenda.
Brenda (PS04U) [5585] No [...] ... Do you want the hangers?
               [5586] Do you desperately need the hangers?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5587] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [5588] Cos they're gonna be bulky.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5589] No.
               [5590] Hangers are a pain.
Brenda (PS04U) [5591] Even if you ... had to after Christmas take it back ...
               they won't know.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5592] They don't worry about the hangers, no.
Brenda (PS04U) [5593] You just say you don't have the hangers don't you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5594] That's right.
               [5595] Yes.
               [5596] ... The hangers could in fact go, go in there because
               that looked to be rather a good hanger, frankly.
Brenda (PS04U) [5597] Mm. [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5598] No, that one's a nuisance.
               [5599] That one's a nuisance. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5600] That one's alright though.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5601] That one's fine.
Brenda (PS04U) [5602] They're lovely [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5603] They are beautiful. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5604] It's not too heavy then.
               [5605] And you've got room in there if you want ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [5606] Have a little hold ... oh yes I can manage that for short
               distances.
               [5607] I think perhaps that can be thrown out because otherwise
               it's going to scratch that that nice tin.
Brenda (PS04U) [5608] I can take the tin of biscuits out if you feel it's too
               heavy.
               [5609] ... Oh we can try it tomorrow, thinking about it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5610] Yes.
               [5611] ... No I can lift that.
               [5612] I mean I couldn't walk for any great distance with it but
               ... I'm going to have taxis.
Brenda (PS04U) [5613] [...] and get them to carry it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5614] Yes.
               [5615] Yes. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5616] Yeah that's gonna scratch it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5617] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5618] That'll be easier for you anyway
Jean (PS04Y)   [5619] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5620] so you've got a bit of padding there you can put [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5621] Yes.
               [5622] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5623] Pack the biscuits along with your clothes.
               [5624] Inside and it won't [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5625] That's right.
               [5626] It won't get scratched.
               [5627] It's a lovely thing.
Brenda (PS04U) [5628] You've got two ... [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5629] Yeah.
               [5630] I'm wondering whether the things from that ... will lie
               in the top of this.
               [5631] Well we'll see when, when we get the things tomorrow.
               [5632] They're all going to be small aren't we, aren't they?
               [5633] They're going to be
Brenda (PS04U) [5634] All [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5635] tiny things tomorrow.
               [5636] ... Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5637] Course you've got your tree as well.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5638] Oh the tree!
               [5639] ... That could go in with the er wrapping paper couldn't
               it?
Brenda (PS04U) [5640] They [...] to keep that separate.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5641] I suppose so.
               [5642] Yes.
               [5643] It hasn't got it's own tree shaped bag has it?
               [5644] A tall thin bag?
Brenda (PS04U) [5645] No.
               [5646] No.
               [5647] Cos
Jean (PS04Y)   [5648] They were all big bags that we had?
Brenda (PS04U) [5649] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5650] Yeah.
               [5651] ... That's fine then.
               [5652] I don't mind looking after it.
               [5653] Yes.
               [5654] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5655] So it stays upright then.
               [5656] ... No, none of them are heavy.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5657] No.
               [5658] ... Ooh. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5659] Well ... I spent today in Marks and Sparks or you spent.
               [5660] Seventy four pound was mine ... and a hundred and eighty
               five pound was yours.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5661] Yes.
               [5662] Yes.
               [5663] So you've got another seventy really.
Brenda (PS04U) [5664] See there's a nice
Jean (PS04Y)   [5665] That's a beauty.
Brenda (PS04U) [5666] That's better for your baskets.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5667] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5668] Cos they're a bit squashed in this one.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5669] Yes.

               little bag.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5675] Yes.
               [5676] Isn't it nice.
Brenda (PS04U) [5677] That can go in there.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5678] Yeah.
               [5679] I mean that's just little odd bits of underwear and such
               like.
Brenda (PS04U) [5680] [...] put it in there and then fold that bag flat.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5681] Yes.
               [5682] Well I tell you what Brenda, I don't use this bag very
               much.
               [5683] If you don't mind I'll leave it with you.
Brenda (PS04U) [5684] Leave it here and then [...] got it here for shopping
               here [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [5685] That's right.

Brenda (PS04U) [5700] And I thought well, I suppose he's got such rich friends
Jean (PS04Y)   [5701] Mm.
               [5702] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5703] they'll like something like this.
               [5704] I mean stupid
Jean (PS04Y)   [5705] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5706] but I mean ... you don't think erm ... cos he said to me
               he said oh I suppose I'd better buy you a Christmas present and
               I said yeah buy me something that I'd use.
               [5707] He said what I said well if you're gonna me anything, buy
               me a tin of biscuits.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5708] Mm quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [5709] He said ... tin of biscuits?
               [5710] I said
Jean (PS04Y)   [5711] I think that's a most acceptable present.
               [5712] ... It really is.
Brenda (PS04U) [5713] Because ... you know it's stupid things like that
Jean (PS04Y)   [5714] I know that Bob and Glynis will be delighted to have some
               because he's been out of work.
               [5715] Alright, he invested the money that he received as a ...
               gratuity from British Telecom when he was made redundant.
               [5716] And he gets in about three thousand six hundred a year
               ... on that.
               [5717] It's a lot of money.
               [5718] I think they paid him out ... thirty thousand or
               something like that.
               [5719] He'd been with them for twenty seven years.
Brenda (PS04U) [5720] God.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5721] He joined when he was seventeen or sixteen.
               [5722] Made redundant.
               [5723] He cannot get another job.
Brenda (PS04U) [5724] We were saying that Ron in number four ... he was a
               builder.
               [5725] He had his own business, van, the whole lot he had staff
               working for him.
               [5726] And he hurt his back last year and the doctor said well
               ... you'll either be dead within six months.
               [5727] You've gotta give up the building work.
               [5728] He's only thirty odd ... thirty seven, thirty eight.
               [5729] Given it up and he said oh well ... got no kids you know
               they live in this house, got no kids.
               [5730] And they always have a holiday abroad and they go out a
               lot, good social life.
               [5731] They eat out once a week, you know.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5732] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5733] And, because she can't have children ... and er ... this
               was what, last June it all happened?
               [5734] He said oh alright, I'll do something you know, cement or
               milkman
Jean (PS04Y)   [5735] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5736] or something just casual, couple of hours.
               [5737] Couldn't get nothing.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5738] No.
               [5739] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [5740] Absolutely nothing.
               [5741] And say he's round about the fortyish ... age and we
               spoke to him last week and ... I said you got a job yet?
               [5742] He said no and I'm getting worried now he said me, my
               wife works full time and we could cope on the money but ... he
               said now we don't go out.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5743] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5744] You know, once a fortnight.
               [5745] He said we're not getting the luxuries like we could when
               we were both working full time.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5746] Mm.
               [5747] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5748] He said we're surviving.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5749] Mm.
               [5750] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5751] Cos they've got a next to nothing mortgage.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5752] Yeah.
               [5753] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5754] But er
Jean (PS04Y)   [5755] Yeah it's like with me, I mean of course don't forget
               that I've got a good two hundred pounds to come ... on about the
               fifth of December from the British Legion's savings.
Brenda (PS04U) [5756] Oh of course you have.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5757] I've been saving five pounds a week ... for practically
               the whole of the year.
               [5758] And that will be chucked into the building society ... so
               that I can, when I get my Marks and Spencers debt come through,
               I can pay a great wodge off.
Brenda (PS04U) [5759] Off that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5760] But I shall still have to draw on some capital Brenda,
               nevertheless.
Brenda (PS04U) [5761] You will.
               [5762] I mean you have to Christmas time though don't you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5763] Well erm ... I have thought now what shall I do after
               Christmas?
               [5764] Because you know I like January.
               [5765] I've achieved a Christmas.
               [5766] I've made everybody happy.
Brenda (PS04U) [5767] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5768] And ... I thought that sewing machine is really going to
               get out to work.
               [5769] And I'm not going to buy any fabric.
               [5770] I'm going to make up the fabric I've got.
               [5771] And it's, I'm going to do things for the house ... like I
               want to make erm ... Chris has put back the rail over my
               windowsill.
               [5772] I don't whether you remember I had a bamboo pole.
Brenda (PS04U) [5773] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5774] And I made a, a thing and it looked awful
Brenda (PS04U) [5775] I know you said.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5776] and I took it down.
               [5777] But I bought some ... beautiful crimson bias binding from
               Laura Ashley ... don't laugh but I'm taking the valance of
               Paul's bed
Brenda (PS04U) [5778] I remember you saying.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5779] because it's a white valance.
               [5780] And I'm going to have this white ... frill ... sp er erm
               roll, and I'm going to roll the fabric ... I'm going to leave
               all the pleating, not cut into that, but cut the valance
               platform and fold it over if you understand me and make it go
               over the ... the pole.
Brenda (PS04U) [5781] That's a good idea.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5782] Erm so that I'll have oh plenty of gathers you see but
               the pole will be smooth.
               [5783] My mistake was to ... to spread something through that
               went into horrid, nasty gathers on the pole.
               [5784] Didn't look anything, just looked messy.
               [5785] So I thought have it smooth over the pole and then all
               frilly underneath and this lovely line of ... soft crimson.
               [5786] And I thought you know I mean when, when erm Philip goes
               and I'm in the en suite in, in the en suite bedroom.
               [5787] Everybody says it does pay you to have the house looking
               fresh.
               [5788] That room ... the paint to my eye has either faded or
               changed colour or something.
               [5789] Now I noticed this with ... in the sitting room this year
               I got John , friend of Nev's to repaint the walls because do you
               remember they were called soft peach?
Brenda (PS04U) [5790] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5791] And I looked at them and I thought, that isn't soft peach
               any more.
               [5792] That's a glaring pink.
Brenda (PS04U) [5793] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5794] I suspect that Dulux emulsion paint changes colour.
Brenda (PS04U) [5795] Oh yeah it does.
               [5796] Tell you what I've got, it's a marvellous thing.
               [5797] The decorators at Peter's works ... cos they, they erm
               ... tradesmen they've got a colour card.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5798] Ah yes I've got that.
Brenda (PS04U) [5799] Have you ... this is the tradesmen's card.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5800] Which one is it?
Brenda (PS04U) [5801] It's a Dulux but you can't get it from the shop.
               [5802] It's tradesmen.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5803] No that's right.
               [5804] Erm Anthony ... Anthony got me that.
Brenda (PS04U) [5805] Got one, yeah?
               [5806] Marvellous aren't they
Jean (PS04Y)   [5807] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5808] cos you got every single
Jean (PS04Y)   [5809] Which year is it?
Brenda (PS04U) [5810] Now.
               [5811] This year.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5812] Oh I haven't got the up to date one.
               [5813] Let's have a quick gander through.
               [5814] Erm ... so I thought ... what have I got?
               [5815] I've actually got a great load still of gardenia and
               white mixed which is what ... was put on the walls in the
               sitting room.
               [5816] I thought I'll put that on the walls in the bedroom.
               [5817] I'm not going to bother to go out and buy new paint when
               I've got a damn great tub
Brenda (PS04U) [5818] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5819] of this lovely soft pale cream.
               [5820] Erm ... I don't know whether I was with you when I bought
               er rolls of ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5821] Borders.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5822] Borders.
               [5823] I've got a very pale grey.
Brenda (PS04U) [5824] Remember that in Marks and Sparks a couple of months back
               they were selling borders off and I bought a beautiful aqua one.
               [5825] And they were fifty p each on a background
Jean (PS04Y)   [5826] I wonder if they're still doing them?
Brenda (PS04U) [5827] No.
               [5828] They were just, it was just a one day I went round there
               shopping and they had, and I bought some beige ones for the
               kitchen.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5829] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5830] Erm ... and it cost me two quid I think for the four.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5831] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5832] And I mean I haven't put them up yet.
               [5833] I thought I'll wait to, I sort of really, like the
               bathroom I want to ... it's got the wallpaper starting to peel
               off.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5834] Tal speaking of wallpaper, I am going to paper the en
               suite.
               [5835] Er I only need two rolls.
Brenda (PS04U) [5836] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5837] Possibly even one.
               [5838] So I'm going to look in the, in the bin.
               [5839] And I shall make some more little cushions for the
               bedroom and I'm going to use this idea of ... terribly ordinary
               cotton
Brenda (PS04U) [5840] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5841] there's nothing wonderful about the cotton, but the
               cushions look absolutely superb because ... there were just thin
               lines of the, you can tell it was when you looked at it quite
               cheap ribbon ... but just arranged in a beautiful square and
               then a little bit of lace.
Brenda (PS04U) [5842] [...] like those tissue boxes.
               [5843] Now I've got a friend of mine that makes them.
               [5844] Now that was seven ninety nine that you bought for
               Rosemary.
               [5845] Now that was ... Marks, they're nice ones.
               [5846] Now she gets them and she sells them for ten quid.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5847] I say.
Brenda (PS04U) [5848] And they're not, I mean they're pretty but they're not
               ... that magnolia range in Marks is lovely.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5849] That's lovely yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5850] And ... but she sells them.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5851] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5852] You know she does parties as well, but
Jean (PS04Y)   [5853] Yeah, yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5854] she said she ... she's losing the profit ... at selling
               them at ten pounds.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5855] Yes.
               [5856] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5857] Because the lace, the time.
               [5858] She said tissue
Jean (PS04Y)   [5859] Do you remember when we tried to make fluffy dogs?
Brenda (PS04U) [5860] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5861] And we found we just ... were were wasting our time.
Brenda (PS04U) [5862] Wasting our time [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [5863] You're up against the factory conveyor belt system of
               sewing when you, one person does only ears and the other does
               bodies and
Brenda (PS04U) [5864] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5865] Yes.
               [5866] Yes that is lovely.
Brenda (PS04U) [5867] It's good isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5868] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5869] I think we ought to get some kip.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5870] I think so.
               [5871] I hate to but erm ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5872] [...] talk [...] for tonight.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5873] I must.
Brenda (PS04U) [5874] I wanna [...] in a minute.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5875] No and we must.
Brenda (PS04U) [5876] It's quarter past twelve.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5877] I don't like going up late, nor do you.
Brenda (PS04U) [5878] Right [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5879] But we'll have plenty of sleep.
               [5880] I mean I think five, six hour's sleep is absolutely
               enough.
Brenda (PS04U) [5881] Oh yeah.
               [5882] I'll get Dave to set the alarm and then we can have
               breakfast before we sort of rush out.
               [5883] Otherwise I'll sleep through.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5884] Mm.
               [5885] Well that's partly what did me today.
               [5886] I was deter , you see I, I have to set a good example to
               Neil.
               [5887] And I was determined that everywhere although not
               absolutely superbly glittering, everywhere was going to be tidy
               before I left.
               [5888] So I went through every blessed room.
               [5889] Tidy tidy tidy.
               [5890] Throwing away rubbish ... you know what it is.
Brenda (PS04U) [5891] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5892] Bitsy bitsy bitsy of this and that and the other.
               [5893] Came out without anything inside me and then had this
               ghastly experience of not, I was, I was banking on being able to
               get a hot cup of coffee on the train.
               [5894] No coffee.
               [5895] ... And then ... this wretched journey.
Brenda (PS04U) [5896] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5897] And I got thoroughly upset.
Brenda (PS04U) [5898] Oh you could tell right on the phone you were sort of all
               keyed up with it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5899] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [5900] Do you need a drink of water or anything?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5901] No thanks dear.
Brenda (PS04U) [5902] You're alright.
               [5903] You might hear Dave switch that off in the morning.
               [5904] Erm but he probably won't.
*** 45 (Tape 015402) ***
Jean (PS04Y)   [5905] old ferry coming over from ... erm Harwich to the Hook of
               Holland.
               [5906] And I, I used to ... sort of sit in er put ... sit myself
               in my little erm bunk you know?
Brenda (PS04U) [5907] Yeah. [yawn]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5908] And the, the swaying of the ship and I used to sleep like
               a log.
               [5909] Everybody else round me was being sick.
               [5910] [laugh] Not me. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [5911] [laugh] .
               [5912] I didn't sleep very well at all.
               [5913] ... Up and down up and down ... all night.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5914] You have?
Brenda (PS04U) [5915] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5916] Why?
Brenda (PS04U) [5917] Don't know.
               [5918] I
Jean (PS04Y)   [5919] Excitement?
Brenda (PS04U) [5920] I think, a lot of it, you know I was ... burning a bit so
               I think a lot of it was sort of it thinking about that blooming
               boiler.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5921] Yes.
               [5922] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5923] And then you know Dave I think drew ... he was, he was
               ever so, ever so restless.
               [5924] [yawning] I don't know whether he was expecting the water
               to burst ... or what it was [] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [5925] Yeah I know.
               [5926] Ooh I know.
Brenda (PS04U) [5927] Cos when I went to bed I mean, you know I tested it and
               it didn't seem too bad.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5928] No.
               [5929] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [5930] It seemed sort of hot ... but er ... I mean that's the
               trouble at the moment because ... even if it's something minor
               thing, it seems so dramatic.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5931] Exactly.
Brenda (PS04U) [5932] You know especially to me at the moment.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5933] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5934] I don't know why.
               [5935] The smallest thing ... I mean it seems such a ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [5936] Well I think ... there must, this must be a very common
               feeling for a lot of people ... that they feel that they're
               balanced on a knife edge.
               [5937] There's so much ... we've had to pay out so much ... erm
               you've had to pay out so much on, on more mortgage than you
               expected.
Brenda (PS04U) [5938] Mm.
               [5939] Did you, saying that, did you see that programme on ...
               let me think [yawning] oh dear [] .
               [5940] It was on repossession.
               [5941] ... One day in the week or the week before.
               [5942] It was on er channel four I think it was ... and it was
               all about these people that had been, you know encouraged to buy
               this house and then repossessed.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5943] Mm.
               [5944] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5945] And ... did you watch it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5946] No I didn't see that one.
Brenda (PS04U) [5947] Oh it was horrible.
               [5948] And it was how people you know didn't want to er ... and
               they wouldn't.
               [5949] And they were saying that you don't give, the local erm
               MP was saying you know people just give their kids up and walk
               away.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5950] Mhm yes.
               [5951] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5952] And, but it was awful you know.
               [5953] There was so many of them.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5954] It should not happen.
               [5955] I I mean I think it, somewhere somebody is being greedy.
               [5956] It shouldn't happen.
               [5957] And it seems to have happened because ... thirty years
               ago everybody like Jerry and me had a repayment mortgage which
               meant there were very few endowment mortgages.
Brenda (PS04U) [5958] Mm?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5959] Now a repayment mortgage ... they will extend the term of
               the mortgage.
Brenda (PS04U) [5960] Yeah but when we had a when we had [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [5961] And the endowment you can't extend it.
               [5962] Well I think they should make it so that you can extend
               it.
Brenda (PS04U) [5963] Yeah but when they
Jean (PS04Y)   [5964] I just don't think I just don't think repossessions
               should happen.
Brenda (PS04U) [5965] But repayment now is due as an endowment.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5966] Well they should do something about it Brenda.
               [5967] That's all I can say.
               [5968] There should be some ... certain fund for bailing out
               people who are in real, terrible difficulties.
               [5969] Because you see
Brenda (PS04U) [5970] Yeah because
Jean (PS04Y)   [5971] people ... people are not being helped.
               [5972] It's like my Neil.
               [5973] Nobody was helping him.
Brenda (PS04U) [5974] Nobody wants to know, do they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [5975] No they don't. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [5976] Not with things sort of going on there's ... and now you
               think sort of it, it's time when people sort of would ... club
               together.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5977] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [5978] But it was saying, er this, this programme was saying
               that that ... erm ... that they were buying a house.
               [5979] And it was telling you ... you know say they were, for
               argument's sake they was buying this house that was sort of up
               north and that.
               [5980] And they were buying this house and it was worth
               something like ... I don't know, they were, they'd got a twenty
               five grand mortgage.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5981] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5982] They hadn't got ... it it wasn't, I mean ... you know to
               us it was qu , a cheap mortgage but sort of up there it was
               probably, you know sort of
Jean (PS04Y)   [5983] Mm.
               [5984] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5985] a lot of money to him cos there's not the work and that.
               [5986] And they'd bought this mortgage and their repayment was
               something like about I dunno a hundred and eighty pound a month.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5987] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5988] And they said you know, and then all of a sudden it had
               sort of gone up six percent.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5989] Yes.
               [5990] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [5991] And it was five hundred quid.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5992] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5993] And there was no way, you know at a hundred and eighty
               they'd struggled.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5994] Mm.
               [5995] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [5996] And they thought, because ... most people were, were sort
               of us.
               [5997] We thought oh we'll go for it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [5998] Yes.
               [5999] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6000] It's gonna be a struggle for a year.
               [6001] But you go for it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6002] Yeah of course.
Brenda (PS04U) [6003] And you don't dream of it
Jean (PS04Y)   [6004] No.
               [6005] Nobody ever dreamed
Brenda (PS04U) [6006] going up.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6007] Nobody ever dreamed of this. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [6008] I mean they reckon it's gonna go back up now don't they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6009] Yeah.
               [6010] Probably will.
               [6011] ... I, you see I think that instead of, instead of Lawson
               putting interest rates up to squeeze inflation out of the
               economy ... he should have stopped all credit.
               [6012] When Jerry and I ... were young ... if at the end of the
               month there was no money in the account ... the bank used to
               write you a filthy letter if you were two pounds overdrawn.
               [6013] And you had ... if ... it was no good you wanting
               something ... and waving a bit of plastic at it.
               [6014] There was no bit of plastic to wave then.
Brenda (PS04U) [6015] There wasn't?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6016] Not a thing.
               [6017] If you wanted to borrow money from the bank to, to buy
               anything there were two ways of getting money.
               [6018] You could go to the bank and ask for a loan.
               [6019] And mostly you got a dusty answer because if you hadn't
               got shares to put down as collateral, you didn't get your loan.
               [6020] And the other way of doing it was to go on hire purchase.
               [6021] And when you wanted to buy something like a three piece
               suite, you went to somewhere like Bentalls ... and they took you
               into a little room, soon as you said to the man well I want to
               buy this on hire purchase and you went in to a little room ...
               and the man sat down and you filled in a long form.
               [6022] You told him what your husband earned.
               [6023] Erm ... what you, er what you ... could manage in the way
               of repayments what, er er you had to put one third of the full
               price down.
Brenda (PS04U) [6024] Is that when you and Jerry were first married or
Jean (PS04Y)   [6025] Yes.
               [6026] Yeah you had to put one third of the full price.
               [6027] So if a three piece suite cost say a hundred and fifty
               pounds, you had to put fifty pounds down.
               [6028] And the, the hundred over over two years on, on interest.
Brenda (PS04U) [6029] So people couldn't get in that state could they?
               [6030] You
Jean (PS04Y)   [6031] You, you could not get into debt Brenda.
               [6032] You were not allowed to.
Brenda (PS04U) [6033] What you could afford ... you had.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6034] Exactly.
               [6035] Exactly.
Brenda (PS04U) [6036] Now when did the ... I suppose the credit card they
               brought ... but as to what you say I mean ... the, these, these
               repossessions it's not the fact ... they can't afford the
               mortgage.
               [6037] It's the fact they can't afford ... all the ... the, the
               lifestyle to go with it, that's what Dave says.
               [6038] I mean the fact is ... you know there's blokes at work.
               [6039] Same mortgage as us and earning the same as Dave.
               [6040] I mean, you know they're in a dreadful state.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6041] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6042] I mean they spend their wages before
Jean (PS04Y)   [6043] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6044] And I think it's because they go out drinking and ... you
               know
Jean (PS04Y)   [6045] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6046] They're always buying things for the home.
               [6047] And the cars.
               [6048] I mean ... majority of blokes at Dave's firm have changed
               their cars three times.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6049] Yeah.
               [6050] Yeah.
               [6051] I know.
               [6052] People have come to expect that.
               [6053] Now you could do it in the nineteen seventies and er ...
               well ... yes I would say from nineteen sixty eight onwards with
               ... plastic card and ... revolv , what's called revolving
               credit.
               [6054] You could just run up the credit.
               [6055] I mean my, all my efforts after Christmas will be to get
               rid of these card debts.
               [6056] I promised [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [6057] Yeah but with you it's ... I mean, alright you don't want
               it over you, but you will clear it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6058] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6059] But thing is there's a lot of people that, that that
               don't.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6060] No.
               [6061] Quite.
               [6062] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [6063] I mean I know I told you this
Jean (PS04Y)   [6064] I mean the only reason I'm I'm running up these debts is
               that now ... I've got so little capital left, that I've got to
               keep the capital for sheer disasters like ... the boiler.
Brenda (PS04U) [6065] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6066] And because you've got to pay that in cash.
Brenda (PS04U) [6067] But there's people that ... you know are still now
               spending them at Christmas.
               [6068] It's like Jen, still spending them.
               [6069] You know he's still got like two holidays left on them.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6070] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6071] But then still runs it up for Christmas.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6072] Yeah.
               [6073] I mean I, I now will do no spending [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [6074] Yeah but you you didn't have ... thousands outstanding
               before you, you know by spending yours like yesterday.
               [6075] You didn't think to yourself oh god I owe five hundred
               pound on ... Marks and Sparks ... I'll top it up .
Jean (PS04Y)   [6076] No I had a fifty pound debt.
Brenda (PS04U) [6077] That's it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6078] And when the er and I've now got what?
               [6079] Er three hundred.
               [6080] ... Now that when, as soon as I get my cheque from the
               British Legion ... for two hundred, roughly.
               [6081] I won't wait for the card, for the bill to come in for
               the card.
               [6082] I shall send that off to Marks.
               [6083] ... I won't wait for them to send to me.
Brenda (PS04U) [6084] Oh can you send it off?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6085] Yeah..
Brenda (PS04U) [6086] Yeah it's gonna be sort of six ... well it's longer now
               isn't it?
               [6087] Before you get the bills ... it's about eight weeks they
               said now.
               [6088] Seven
Jean (PS04Y)   [6089] I don't know.
               [6090] But they'll, they'll get their money tout suite .
Brenda (PS04U) [6091] Cos you'll ... you probably won't get the bill in anyway
               till after, well after Christmas will you now?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6092] No.
               [6093] But they'll get their money.
Brenda (PS04U) [6094] And then, when they send you the bill then will they
               just, you won't get so much interest on it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6095] No they'll just say payment, thank you.
               [6096] And ... won't be quite so much.
Brenda (PS04U) [6097] Mind you er and even easier, what annoys me ... they've
               put the interest rate down on the cards.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6098] Mm.
               [6099] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6100] Charging everybody
Jean (PS04Y)   [6101] Mm.
               [6102] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6103] A twelve pound ... charge but putting their rates down on
               it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6104] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6105] So it encourages people even more doesn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6106] Course it does.
Brenda (PS04U) [6107] Think, oh well ... when we normally was paying you know,
               I think Jenny's is something like
Jean (PS04Y)   [6108] Twenty three percent A P R.
               [6109] It was, it was two ... it was something like two percent
               a month.
Brenda (PS04U) [6110] Jenny's is something like about ... eighty pound a month
               ... interest.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6111] She must have a colossal debt.
Brenda (PS04U) [6112] Mm.
               [6113] ... And then I said, cos I said well how are you doing
               your Christmas shopping.
               [6114] Mm flexi friends.
Jean (PS04Y)   [sigh]
Brenda (PS04U) [6115] The majority of people ... I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [6116] I, I mean my five hundred pound limit on Marks ... was
               what I asked for.
               [6117] I could have asked for far more.
               [6118] They ask you
Brenda (PS04U) [6119] When I talked to my mum, she had about a grand on, on
               debts.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6120] Mm.
               [6121] Yeah.
               [6122] They ask you what you want.
Brenda (PS04U) [6123] And then she went in one day and she knew she'd had a
               thousand and said can I extend it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6124] Yeah.
               [6125] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [6126] Yeah, course you can.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6127] Well do you know what my, did I tell you what my
               extension is, what happened with the ... Access.
               [6128] When I got into money difficulties in Woking.
               [6129] I simply phoned them and erm ... they put, they put it up
               ... so that I could buy things ... on Access that I could get,
               well I mean those were the days when I knew that you could sell
               a house like
Brenda (PS04U) [6130] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6131] just like that.
               [6132] I didn't know that I was going to have to sell my house
               for twenty five thousand less than all my neighbours were
               selling at.
Brenda (PS04U) [6133] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6134] And I mean this is where you get caught.
Brenda (PS04U) [6135] Mind you, you think if you'd stayed in there now.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6136] Well I don't know what would have happened to me.
Brenda (PS04U) [6137] You'd have just, well I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [6138] Couldn't have survived.
               [6139] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [6140] They, they reckon they're going for about ninety five to
               a hundred and five down there.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6141] Oh no.
Brenda (PS04U) [6142] Yeah!
               [6143] Cos I tell you who's ... not ... Poo next door to Poo.
               [6144] That was up for sale.
               [6145] ... That hasn't gone still.
               [6146] That's been on the market for ... oh ages.
               [6147] And the corner house is up for sale.
               [6148] Next to you on the, the house on the ... if you stand at
               your front door
Jean (PS04Y)   [6149] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6150] on the left.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6151] Oh Heath, yes.

               [6160] Yeah.
               [6161] And that is I think going for about ninety eight.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6162] [whispering] That's ridiculous Brenda [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [6163] Mm.
               [6164] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6165] I know that if I wanted to come back here ... this is the
               time that I could do so.
Brenda (PS04U) [6166] Mm.
               [6167] Oh well it's a buyer's market isn't it?
               [6168] If you haven't got ... have mortgages and that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6169] I'm waiting until, I'm not thinking about the prices of
               anywhere until I've sold.
               [6170] Because
Brenda (PS04U) [6171] And then you'll you'll get more value by selling yours up
               there, than you would down here.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6172] Mm.
               [6173] Yes.
               [6174] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6175] Much more because
Jean (PS04Y)   [6176] Well.
               [6177] Houses are selling there.
               [6178] Very very slowly.
               [6179] But you do see ... the moving vans on the go.
Brenda (PS04U) [6180] Yeah.
               [6181] I mean they're they're talk , you was talking about ... a
               good year on the market round here.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6182] Well ... I put mine on the market about ten week's ago.
               [6183] I haven't had a look, I haven't had a nibble yet.
Brenda (PS04U) [6184] No. ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [6185] No it will be interesting, it will be interesting to see
Brenda (PS04U) [6186] After Christmas it will.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6187] Yes.
               [6188] Interesting to see exactly where the prices settle down.
Brenda (PS04U) [6189] Where was it they, oh that was it erm this repossession
               programme, they also had a house auction.
               [6190] And they had flats in London and there was like ... sort
               of [...] guys like Peter ... there.
               [6191] And they interviewed them afterwards.
               [6192] And one guy had bought three.
               [6193] He'd bought two flats in London
Jean (PS04Y)   [6194] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6195] and they rated at ... with the high, when the house boom
               was on
Jean (PS04Y)   [6196] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6197] they were going for about a hundred thousand.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6198] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6199] He picked two flats up there for forty five thousand.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6200] You can, in Ipswich erm ... Paul was looking at the, at
               the property you know because he'd like to meet a girl and the
               two of them, he'd like to buy ... and he'd like to meet some
               girl who's already got perhaps er either a council flat or ...
               something.
               [6201] He said that he and Karen could have, he said at the
               present prices he and this Karen that he's, that left him ... er
               they, they could have had erm a place together because ... some
               one bedroom flats, two bedroom flats around are going at thirty
               five thousand, thirty one.
               [6202] Prices like that up in the Ipswich area.
Brenda (PS04U) [6203] Mm.
               [6204] But this was for two flats.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6205] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6206] And th it was like there was this couple and they were
               like I dunno ... about ... sixty, sixty five the pair of them.
               [6207] And they had no mortgage and they had a ... a little
               bungalow and everything.
               [6208] And erm ... th they went to an auction and she was saying
               how interesting it was.
               [6209] And she could have a like four bedroom house for fifty
               five thousand.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6210] Mm.
               [6211] Mm.
               [6212] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6213] You know.
               [6214] I mean they, and they were in good areas.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6215] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6216] But what it was, they were like ... it was like G A N do
               them er Man and Co And they had sort of like ... a job like
               Dave's and a lot of them what they've done ... is they've bought
               in this area, I mean probably most areas they've bought ... the
               repossessed they've got about eight or nine houses ... they're
               either renting them out or they're leaving them empty.
               [6217] The majority of them are empty round here.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6218] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6219] And then they'll just hang on to them
Jean (PS04Y)   [6220] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6221] for about five or six years till the house goes up and
               then.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6222] Mm.
               [6223] Mm.
               [6224] They, the building societies are worried about their
               repossessed houses.
               [6225] They thought that it was going to be all easy.
               [6226] I read this in the Telegraph.
Brenda (PS04U) [6227] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6228] They thought oh, easy we're going to
Brenda (PS04U) [6229] Sell them at
Jean (PS04Y)   [6230] parcel them out amongst the estate agents.
               [6231] And the estate agents don't want to know.
               [6232] Because people don't want to buy a repossessed house.
               [6233] For one thing they think it's unlucky.
               [6234] And the second thing is that repossessed houses very very
               quickly begin to look dirty and battered.
Brenda (PS04U) [6235] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6236] And ... I mean I remember myself when I was a young girl
               ... that you used to walk along a road and you'd see houses that
               were going to rack and ruin.
               [6237] And you see ... it's the central heating and the women
               opening and shutting doors and running round and keep
Brenda (PS04U) [6238] But they don't
Jean (PS04Y)   [6239] It's people who keep the houses going.
Brenda (PS04U) [6240] But there was a house on this repossession and ... it was
               sort of like ... just a sort of young couple and they'd bought
               this house and it was like a two bedroom house ... and they'd
               done up beautiful.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6241] Ah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6242] Really nice.
               [6243] Well they just fell behind you know I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [6244] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6245] they obviously ... I mean, quite an expensive sort of
               social life and everything.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6246] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6247] Whatever.
               [6248] And they just couldn't, he lost his job which is the same
               old story and er ... anyway they went back to visit and they kee
               they go back every two or three weeks to visit this house.
               [6249] They've got a ki , no they've got kids.
               [6250] They had got ... three kiddies that's right, cos the
               council housed them.
               [6251] And they were in this grotty council house now and they
               go back and they said ... and you saw them going back and saying
               look at the state of the garden.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6252] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6253] Look at the state of the, the woodwork looks tatty and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6254] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [6255] we spent all these years on this and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6256] Yes, yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6257] all the mail and junk letters all through the door and
               everything looked tatty.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6258] Mm.
               [6259] Mm.
               [6260] Mm.
               [6261] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6262] And they said you know ... th there should have been a
               way round it where they kept this couple in there.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6263] There should.
               [6264] There should.
Brenda (PS04U) [6265] It's now been empty six months.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6266] Even if it's even if people had sold their houses to the
               local council ... [...] .
               [6267] You see in in, on the continent they do not build ...
               council ghettos.
               [6268] Li you know, like you lived in.
               [6269] Where you walk in and think oh these must be council
               houses as you're driving through.
Brenda (PS04U) [6270] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6271] You, you find a house to rent ... that seems right for
               your ... about the price, perhaps a bit high but about right for
               your ... level of income.
               [6272] And you go to the local housing agency er the, the
               council housing agency, and you get a ... grant to help you with
               your rent.
               [6273] So that there aren't special council houses.
               [6274] An any house could be a council house.
Brenda (PS04U) [6275] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6276] And it means that
Brenda (PS04U) [6277] I don't think the council can afford to do it now can
               they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6278] No.
               [6279] They can't but they, it should, it should have been
               possible for the councils to have ... I don't know it, it ... it
               seems [sigh] I, I put it down, I remember walking up and down on
               the beach with John about eight weeks ago was it?
               [6280] He came to see me, it was before I had this illness er
               these two illnesses.
               [6281] Or was it after the diarrhoea but before the two lovely
               colds?
               [6282] And we were walking up and down on the beach at Aldeburgh
               ... and the most interesting part of our conversation was ...
               that we were saying we both started out as ... not
               conservatives, I've never voted conservative in my life, but we
               started out as very loyal people.
               [6283] British justice was marvellous.
               [6284] British parliament was wonderful.
               [6285] The queen is great.
               [6286] And John said I now don't believe in anything.
               [6287] I mean ... you're talking, you're talking about old ...
               middle class rather staid people.
Brenda (PS04U) [6288] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6289] And, you should be taping this [laugh] .
Brenda (PS04U) [laugh]
Jean (PS04Y)   [6290] You are!
               [6291] [laugh] Don't mean any disloyalty.
               [6292] Don't take me to the tower.
               [6293] [laugh] Erm ... but erm ... he was saying ... he now sees
               the weaknesses in ... and how, how pathetic are governments are.
Brenda (PS04U) [6294] Mm.
               [6295] Well they reckon now I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [6296] I mean the poll tax Brenda!
               [6297] The poll tax!
Brenda (PS04U) [6298] But they make me die because ... you, you you're a day, I
               mean we got this sort of letter the bailiffs were coming in
               [...] ... because we were a day late.
               [6299] A day late
Jean (PS04Y)   [6300] Ridiculous.
Brenda (PS04U) [6301] on it.
               [6302] And I said ... there's people out there that don't even
               pay it!
               [6303] You know and ... I mean cos Dave totally refuses on on
               the poll tax to have a standing order or direct debit.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6304] I have to Brenda.
               [6305] I have no option.
Brenda (PS04U) [6306] Yeah.
               [6307] Well he just totally sort of because I think he knows
Jean (PS04Y)   [6308] I, I was
Brenda (PS04U) [6309] so many people that don't pay it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6310] Well it makes me very bitter because the , this is the
               sort of thing that John and I we were going over ... one thing
               after the other.
               [6311] We we were brought up to believe that if you didn't do
               the right thing you would be punished.
Brenda (PS04U) [6312] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6313] And ... people are getting away with it.
Brenda (PS04U) [6314] But what I can't understand, I mean majority of people I
               mean erm ... you've gotta pay the debt in the end whatever.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6315] Course you have. [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [6316] Why keep putting it off?
               [6317] People put it off and that is where they get in the
               trouble.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6318] Well I don't know that it's that.
               [6319] I think that people who are living in a fixed abode are
               paying ... in the end.
               [6320] They're being taken to court and made to pay.
               [6321] But it's people like my lodger.
Brenda (PS04U) [6322] Yeah but they were saying now, it's like our, in the like
               local paper ... the poll tax is gonna [...] ... prob , might be
               even go up double because of the non-payers.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6323] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6324] Because of not
Jean (PS04Y)   [6325] That makes me very angry.
Brenda (PS04U) [6326] not having to take them all, I mean having to take them
               to court.
               [6327] And they said, just said in the end ... again there was
               er an article or something and it was saying that ... you know
               that er did did you eventually get the money?
               [6328] And they said no they had to write it off.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6329] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6330] They never ever did pay it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6331] Well ... they are spending a fortune on hounding Paul.
               [6332] ... They don't [sigh] somebody
Brenda (PS04U) [6333] Cos he's at no fixed address is he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6334] Well ... he, he left ... he was with Karen ... he came to
               me ... he left me and went down to Gloucester ... he dithered
               about running up and down the road between Gloucester ... and
               here er Stowmarket.
Brenda (PS04U) [6335] Stowmarket. [laugh]
Jean (PS04Y)   [6336] Erm ... not knowing where he was going to, to park his
               bottom.
               [6337] And eventually, well I had a, I had a questionnaire ...
               letters were coming to him which I sent back because I, Paul had
               never told me where he lived in Gloucester.
Brenda (PS04U) [6338] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6339] And I ... they were addressed to him and they were from
               the council and I simply said, er wrote on the outside ... erm
               no longer here, address not known.
               [6340] Which was true.
               [6341] ... And then they sent me a questionnaire saying ... they
               understood that he'd ... he'd given my address, and was he res ,
               was he still resident?
               [6342] And I said no.
               [6343] Did I know his address?
               [6344] I said no.
               [6345] Eventually an expensive chap, you're talking fifteen
               thousand a year, an expensive chap comes to interview me.
*** 46 (Tape 015403) ***
Brenda (PS04U) [6346] He said I thought I'd catch you out.
               [6347] Didn't think you'd be up.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6348] Oh indeed.
Brenda (PS04U) [6349] Trying to get rid of his second run so that he can get
               home by eleven.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6350] Oh yes.
               [6351] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6352] Erm so he can go back on this ... late.
               [6353] Because he's been up, now he's used to it his body
               clock's telling him to get up.
               [6354] I mean that's what this morning happened.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6355] Yes.
               [6356] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6357] Quarter to one he said god is it time to get up Bren?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6358] Ah!
Brenda (PS04U) [6359] I said no.
               [6360] Course he's been on it for six weeks.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6361] Yes, quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [6362] Hates the blooming hours but
Jean (PS04Y)   [6363] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [6364] course now they're putting them on at half past four ...
               you, your body clock's well out.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6365] Yeah, yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6366] They said that, he's just phoned the firm.
               [6367] He's up in ... tut oh god where is it?
               [6368] It's up er Landsford Park

Brenda (PS04U) [6370] wherever that is.
               [6371] London I think.
               [6372] And he said that he'd phoned them and said could they
               change it and he'd finish at eleven then he can still start
               tomorrow night again at quarter to one .

               [6377] Yeah.
               [6378] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6379] And he said if they can get someone else for the run they
               will.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6380] Yeah.
               [6381] Mm.
               [6382] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6383] But er ... mm what else was we saying?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6384] Well we were talking about the general ... lack of faith
               in governments [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [6385] [...] you was telling me about a suit.
               [6386] This guy fifteen grand turned up for Paul.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6387] Oh yeah, yeah.
               [6388] Suit comes along ... and sits there sipping coffee.
               [6389] Takes about three quarters of an hour.
               [6390] I, I don't say that it was like being grilled by the K G
               B he was ... most polite and courteous.
               [6391] But he was going to find out where Paul was.
               [6392] He was going to find out.
Brenda (PS04U) [6393] How did he get your address then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6394] Mm?
Brenda (PS04U) [6395] How did he get your address?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6396] Well
Brenda (PS04U) [6397] When he worked in Safeways or something?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6398] Yes er ... somehow they, they'd, they'd got it, or was it
               ... or did I have to fill in a ... a census form just at the
               time when Paul was with me?
               [6399] When he happened to be with me.
Brenda (PS04U) [6400] Right, yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6401] They knew anyway.
               [6402] They knew that he'd been here.
               [6403] Er and I mean Paul wasn't trying to dodge anything.
Brenda (PS04U) [6404] No.
               [6405] Well that's what they say if there's, even people that
               come over here for a holiday for three months ... have to pay it
               don't they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6406] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6407] Sort of twice.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6408] So ... er ... and god knows what it's costing them to
               collect.
Brenda (PS04U) [6409] Did Neil have to pay it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6410] Oh yes.
               [6411] Not, not the full amount.
Brenda (PS04U) [6412] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6413] He pays the small amount and in fact I keep on meaning at
               the back of my brain ... to get hold of him and say has he been
               paying it.
               [6414] Cos when, when he was down at Andy's Aerials I think he
               used to go on foot to the post office every week.
               [6415] When he got his ... giro I think he used to pay ... then
               and there.
               [6416] It's only about a pound eighty a week or something for
               him.
Brenda (PS04U) [6417] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6418] [cough] He was paying it and I must make sure that he is
               paying it.
Brenda (PS04U) [6419] Yeah you'd better check it cos if, those one er pound
               eighty adds up don't they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6420] Oh yes if it, it will be moi who has to foot the bill.
               [6421] There's no question on that one.
Brenda (PS04U) [6422] No.
               [6423] No what about erm ... your other friends.
               [6424] What, what are they gonna do?
               [6425] The ones that have got their, Shirley and Terry that have
               got their house on the market?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6426] They're not sure whether they're going to sell because er
               ...
Brenda (PS04U) [6427] Can they afford to stay?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6428] Marginally, now that Shirley has got a job.
               [6429] That [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [6430] So they just sort of put it on the market to see if it
               would sell?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6431] Well at the time they put it on the market we, we all
               three thought that it would be a good idea if, if both families
               ... sold up and moved into something smaller and perhaps moved
               ... near to each other
Brenda (PS04U) [6432] each other.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6433] in Stowmarket.
               [6434] But now I, I just don't think that's going to happen.
               [6435] I, I don't, I honestly Brenda I don't know whether I'm
               going to come back down here.
               [6436] Whether I'm going to move to Norwich.
               [6437] Whether I'm going to stay in Stowmarket.
               [6438] So to be truthful Brenda, I'm happier not thinking about
               it.
Brenda (PS04U) [6439] You've just gotta ... what mood, the mood sort of takes
               you.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6440] Exactly.
               [6441] Er at the moment I'm, I mean I'm even thinking of, of
               redecorating ... my bedroom.
Brenda (PS04U) [6442] Dave even came up with an idea we was talking about the
               other day.
               [6443] And he said what, why doesn't Jean rent?
               [6444] Put your money in the capital, rent and live on the
               capital.
               [6445] Let the interest rent.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6446] Well I have thought about that vaguely Brenda.
               [6447] It'll all depend on what the situation is when I sell.
Brenda (PS04U) [6448] He said that cos then, you know he said she she would
               have no upkeep of the house.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6449] Mm.
               [6450] That's right.
               [6451] That's right.
               [6452] But I, I don't know whether Dave has, I mean ... you see
               ... my friend Pam whose husband Steve is an airline pilot ...
               she knows quite a bit about this because ... Steve was an
               illegitimate child in London, in West Ham.
               [6453] His mother was an office cleaner ... and she conceived
               Steve by a married man.
               [6454] Erm a poor, working class man.
               [6455] No question of a divorce and marriage, she just had to
               get on with it.
               [6456] She was able to keep Steve because where she lived ...
               within the er there was a little coronet of little tatty houses
               that have since been pulled down ... and she was related to
               fifteen ... in fifteen out of the twenty two houses she had a
               relative.
Brenda (PS04U) [6457] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6458] So she could always dump the baby on somebody.
Brenda (PS04U) [6459] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6460] She'd got built-in babysitting facilities.
               [6461] And ... Steve knows a lot about being poor.
               [6462] And Pam said that Steve said to her that when he was at
               West Ham grammar school, boys grammar school ... everybody knew
               that the people who were best off were the council house people.
Brenda (PS04U) [6463] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6464] If you were in private accommodation you were noth , you
               were nothing like so well off.
               [6465] You see I have lived in private rented accommodation ...
               with my mother in the late nineteen thirties.
Brenda (PS04U) [6466] I'll just open these doors cos it'll be too cold to go
               out there once we go out.
               [6467] ... so cold with the glass
Jean (PS04Y)   [6468] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6469] and the trouble is if you don't have the ... [...] here
Jean (PS04Y)   [6470] Yes [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [6471] to circulate and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6472] And the trouble is that the, the, the English landlord
               has a name for being greedy.
               [6473] ... And it, it wasn't very nice Brenda because ...
               landlords are entitled to inspect where you live.
               [6474] Or they were.
Brenda (PS04U) [6475] Yeah but you wouldn't b I mean like Dave said because er
Jean (PS04Y)   [6476] Because it wasn't very comfortable.
               [6477] You can't do exactly what you want ... in, in a rented
               place.
               [6478] You can't go putting up shelves and things
Brenda (PS04U) [6479] Yeah but in searching I mean ... Sorry?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6480] You can't go putting up shelves.
               [6481] ... If you put shelves on the wall in a rented house ...
               those those shelves immediately belong to the landlord.
Brenda (PS04U) [6482] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6483] That was the law then.
               [6484] It may not be so now.
Brenda (PS04U) [6485] No I was gonna say yeah because ... I know Cheryl and
               Andy they, they had er erm ... th they rented a four bedroom
               detached house.
               [6486] And they even actually decorated.
               [6487] The landlord said to him you know ... she, she she sort
               of took a lease out for three years on it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6488] Yes.
               [6489] But until recently ... there hasn't been a lot of rented
               accommodation.
               [6490] And ... landlords have probably been quite pleased to get
               a decent tenant.
               [6491] When my Mary-Ann had her rented rooms in Herne Hill ...
               they had the top floor of a ... of a three floor house.
               [6492] And their landlord who was Polish was ever so delighted
               with them.
               [6493] And he said, you know he talked to them and he said you
               can do whatever you like ... because ... Mary-Ann and Mitch were
               superior people.
               [6494] They were going to keep the place clean.
               [6495] They were going to keep it warm.
               [6496] They weren't going to, to have wild parties.
Brenda (PS04U) [6497] Mm.
               [6498] But, but her place she had ... erm it was unfurnished erm
               ... but it was fantastic.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6499] Dave has got a point.
               [6500] And the thought has crossed my mind.
               [6501] And thank him very much for his idea and I will
Brenda (PS04U) [6502] He makes me laugh cos he often says some , when I, it's
               when I've spoken to you on the phone
Jean (PS04Y)   [6503] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6504] and I'll come back and he'll say ... has Jean thought
               about renting Bren?
               [6505] I said she don't wanna rent and he said why?
               [6506] He said if she then sold her house he said ... put the
               capital he said ... alright he said she ... with not buying a
               you know, another house now ... you know the fact is he said
               alright ... if she got one in her area or wherever.
               [6507] He said then she can put her capital he says and the
               interest on the capital
Jean (PS04Y)   [6508] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6509] that can pay the rent.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6510] Mm.
               [6511] But you see
Brenda (PS04U) [6512] And I said yeah but then she's got no house ... to lead
               to a
Jean (PS04Y)   [6513] Mm.
               [6514] And you're at the mercy of the landlord putting the rent
               up Brenda.
               [6515] I mean I know that people have been hit by the mortgage
               rise and of course in my lifetime ... I've never known anything
               like this.
               [6516] Nobody has.
Brenda (PS04U) [6517] Well like I mean I said to him I don't think, you know I
               mean ... it was just ideas I think he said I'm not saying do it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6518] Yes.
               [6519] And I'm glad of people's ideas because
Brenda (PS04U) [6520] But I said I don't think it's a good idea.
               [6521] And ... and I said he's got, you know she'd have nothing
               to leave.
               [6522] And he said yeah but both her children are
Jean (PS04Y)   [6523] Well my children are not worried about that.
Brenda (PS04U) [6524] That's what he said.
               [6525] He said they're both ... you know
Jean (PS04Y)   [6526] No they're not.
               [6527] They're not.
Brenda (PS04U) [6528] he said ... he said not knowing her children he said but
               knowing what he sort of picked up about your kids
Jean (PS04Y)   [6529] Mm.
               [6530] Mm.
               [6531] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6532] he said.
               [6533] You know to them he said it wouldn't be matter if there
               was nothing.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6534] No it wouldn't.
Brenda (PS04U) [6535] Because they're both sort of comfortable and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6536] Very.
Brenda (PS04U) [6537] you know and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6538] Very.
Brenda (PS04U) [6539] their more concerned Jean's getting on with her life
               herself now
Jean (PS04Y)   [6540] Yes.
               [6541] Yes.
               [6542] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6543] than worrying about her ... you know sort of on, on the
               doorstep saying oh you've got to look after me.
               [6544] Here's the money.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6545] Quite.
               [6546] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [6547] Look after me.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6548] They don't want that.
               [6549] They do not, no
Brenda (PS04U) [6550] You know they don't want it.
               [6551] Erm ... different if you was really ill.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6552] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6553] But I mean, you know as it stands I mean you wouldn't
               want it and they wouldn't want it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6554] Mm.
               [6555] No.
               [6556] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [6557] They, they're quite happy you letting them get on with
               their life.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6558] Yes.
               [6559] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6560] Erm ... but then you haven't got the security of renting
               I don't think.
               [6561] Like you say you're at the mercy.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6562] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6563] I mean the fact you can do things and, alright you
               haven't got the upkeep if repairs need doing ... but I think
               that keeps you going.
               [6564] You've got your house.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6565] Yes it does.
               [6566] It it gives me an interest you know?
Brenda (PS04U) [6567] I, I agree you don't need that great big house.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6568] No I don't.
               [6569] I'd be glad to get rid of the great ox ... but I can't so
               there's an end of it.
               [6570] And
Brenda (PS04U) [6571] Yeah but eventually you will.
               [6572] I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [6573] It will s , it will sell .
Brenda (PS04U) [6574] you ... leave it on the market and I mean.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6575] I mean it's not as though I've bought a house which has
               got anything ... wrong with it.
               [6576] It's not on top of a nuclear plant, it it's not next door
               to a pub.
               [6577] It it hasn't got
Brenda (PS04U) [6578] Oh it's a very sellable house in the right
Jean (PS04Y)   [6579] It's a very sellable house yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6580] but I mean, it's just ridiculous at the moment.
               [6581] Because you know you would think near Lacydere the houses
               are sellable.
               [6582] But I mean they're not.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6583] No.
               [6584] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [6585] You know and ... in this area, that's what the guy was
               saying ... houses over a hundred thousand are not selling.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6586] No.
               [6587] We're both
Brenda (PS04U) [6588] Ninety five.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6589] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6590] But people want more the sixty ... seventy thousand.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6591] Yeah.
               [6592] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6593] There's no way.
               [6594] You know I mean, you know people have got these beautiful
               big houses like Lacydere Well this is worth two hundred you know
               ... hundred and eighty five it's gotta be.
               [6595] [...] say no.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6596] A house a house is only worth er what people will give
               for it.
               [6597] I read many years ago that houses are part of the ...
               really the last true free market
Brenda (PS04U) [6598] Well
Jean (PS04Y)   [6599] where a willing buyer meets a willing seller.
               [6600] It's on a house is only worth what somebody will give.
Brenda (PS04U) [6601] But there was an , it's it's like Sylvie was telling me
               that, you know who works for the mortgage [...] she was saying,
               it was erm ... for an incident ... there was a house, you know
               The Grove, those great big Victorian houses?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6602] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6603] Now I don't know what they were worth and she was saying
               ... they must have been worth quite a bit cos they're big
               detached solid houses aren't they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6604] The Grove is a mixture.
               [6605] Some are semi's.
Brenda (PS04U) [6606] Yeah well this one was one of those big, four storeys.
               [6607] I mean enormous it might have even been fi ... but it, it
               had bedrooms and bathrooms and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6608] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6609] and it had a big basement and everything on it.
               [6610] And that she said was repossessed and it went for seventy
               five thousand.
               [6611] And then she said on the, she said I looked at houses
               like this she said
Jean (PS04Y)   [6612] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6613] and they were about a hundred and twenty five
Jean (PS04Y)   [6614] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6615] in a state.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6616] Yeah.
               [6617] Yeah.
               [6618] I could ... I could buy at the moment
Brenda (PS04U) [6619] In Guildford I mean you can buy houses at Guildford at
               sixty ... fifty five, from fifty five to seventy five.
               [6620] And there was no way you could have done that three years
               ago.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6621] No.
               [6622] Erm erm I'm keeping, I'm keeping my ... mind flexible.
               [6623] The first ... the first firm offer I get ... now and
               let's put it like this.
               [6624] I've put the, the estate agent has put a number on the
               house.
               [6625] As far as he and I are concerned it's just a number.
               [6626] And that is a hundred and two.
Brenda (PS04U) [6627] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6628] If somebody comes along and offers me ... ninety ... I
               shall say well what about ninety two?
               [6629] And they might say ... alright.
               [6630] Because people are being encouraged to offer you silly
               prices.
Brenda (PS04U) [6631] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6632] But I shall say ... what about, I shall say to the estate
               agent ... how determined are these people to move?
               [6633] What's the man's situation?
               [6634] Has he got to move because of his job or
Brenda (PS04U) [6635] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6636] whatever?
               [6637] ... Having got a.
*** 47 (Tape 015404) ***
Brenda (PS04U) [6638] But you can't, you can't say well I'm gonna go there and
               I'm gonna go there.
               [6639] You've got to
Jean (PS04Y)   [6640] You can't er you can't.
               [6641] I I must say Brenda, all this knocks years off my age.
               [6642] Because it's so funny.
               [6643] I'm old, I know I'm old and I can't do all the things
               that I used to be able to do.
               [6644] But by golly I'm living as though I were a young woman.
               [6645] All the ... erm imponderables, I mean when you're young
               you don't know quite where you're going to be or what you're
               going to do.
Brenda (PS04U) [6646] Mm.
               [6647] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6648] And I've got this ... with Neil.
               [6649] The moment I get er ... over Christmas, I'm going to be
               finding out ... where are the training courses.
Brenda (PS04U) [6650] That's it.
               [6651] Cos people, I mean now I mean you can't sort of even
               think about that till mid January ... or later.

Jean (PS04Y)   [6653] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6654] really between now and sort of Christmas ... everybody's
               interested in Christmas.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6655] Of course they are.
               [6656] They've got to be.
Brenda (PS04U) [6657] There's nothing else going on.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6658] They've got no option poor devils. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [6659] That's right.
               [6660] There's just nothing, nothing else ... I'm gonna get a
               bath otherwise we'll sit here chatting all morning.
               [6661] And

               [6667] Oh isn't this nice.

Jean (PS04Y)   [6680] Ah!

Brenda (PS04U) [6682] Ikea.

               [6685] Nineteen pounds!
               [6686] And I said it was just what I wanted.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6687] I'd love to go to Ikea.

               [6701] You've got your other bits and pieces in there.
               [6702] Otherwise you'll forget it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6703] Well I won't forget it tonight because, no I won't be
               wearing it will I, here?

               [6731] ... Do you want to take what you've got just in case you
               [...] think

Brenda (PS04U) [6738] Or change it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6739] Mm. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [6740] So I suppose what you do with Debs is er ... tell them
               you want the whole discount ... and I suppose they give you a
               card for each floor cos you can't walk around with it each floor
               can you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6741] No I er we, we'll have to start by asking as you say.
               [6742] Find out what the system is.
               [6743] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6744] If you get, like you did at John Lewis you get a card
Jean (PS04Y)   [6745] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [6746] That'd be better.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6747] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6748] We could then leave it and say we'll pick it up in an
               hour or so
Jean (PS04Y)   [6749] Yes.
               [6750] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6751] then go and do Marks and Smiths
Jean (PS04Y)   [6752] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6753] and drive the car round.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6754] Mm.

Jean (PS04Y)   [6764] What did I do with my glasses Brenda?
               [6765] I had them in my hand a moment ago.
               [6766] Oh there they are.
Brenda (PS04U) [6767] Oh look at the marks on this carpet.
               [6768] Atrocious.
               [6769] We're pulling this carpet up after Christmas.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6770] Aha.
Brenda (PS04U) [6771] We're going back to the woodblock flooring.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6772] How nice.
               [6773] Oh I love it Brenda.
Brenda (PS04U) [6774] Well I mean ... we've, those biscuits are stale now [...]

               [6778] Yeah.
               [6779] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [6780] You end up throwing them out [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [6781] [...] I don't like to throw them away without asking you.
Brenda (PS04U) [6782] No.
               [6783] But I ... I wouldn't leave them
Jean (PS04Y)   [6784] No.
               [6785] I'm going to have a little quick look at Ikea.
               [6786] Oh oh.
Brenda (PS04U) [6787] Course you can.
               [6788] The decorator ... that are in at Peter's at the moment
               ... erm ... they do everything.
               [6789] They're fantastic.
               [6790] And he was saying he said oh you've been good you've been
               feeding us with cups of teas.
               [6791] They charge seventy pound a day per person and he said oh
               we'll charge you next to nothing.
               [6792] He said in fact we'll come down ... and he said, cos the
               er it's cracked round the outside.
               [6793] He said and we'll take it up and repair it for you.
               [6794] He said we might sort of say to you right we want fifty
               quid.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6795] Mm.
               [6796] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6797] But he said we won't charge you the daily rate, we'll
               just charge you for the job.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6798] No.
               [6799] No.
               [6800] No.
               [6801] Yeah.
               [6802] Lovely.
Brenda (PS04U) [6803] And he said if it's that bad we'll strip it for you.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6804] Oh good.
Brenda (PS04U) [6805] And re-, sort of d do it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6806] Re-, re-sand yeah.
               [6807] You'll love it.
               [6808] You'll love it.
Brenda (PS04U) [6809] Well it's all in the hall and Dave said the kids are
               older now.
               [6810] We're fed up with carpets and stain.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6811] Yes.
               [6812] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6813] I mean this carpet's three years old.
               [6814] I mean it's
Jean (PS04Y)   [6815] I know.
               [6816] I know.
Brenda (PS04U) [6817] it's even going here now.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6818] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6819] And you keep washing it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6820] Yeah.
               [6821] Oh
Brenda (PS04U) [6822] And it just doesn't does it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6823] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [6824] Does nothing happens.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6825] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6826] So ... two there.
               [6827] I give you your lipstick didn't I?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6828] Mm.
               [6829] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [6830] Why have we got so many cushions?
               [6831] I said well don't worry, we're gonna have more.
Jean (PS04Y)   [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [6832] I said they even fight then, there's not enough.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6833] Yeah.
               [6834] I know.
               [6835] ... Ah I wish I could lift my carpet up.
               [6836] I hate it.
               [6837] But I must say the carpet looks better in the sitting
               room since
Brenda (PS04U) [6838] Look at this lovely stuff Dave doesn't like it
Jean (PS04Y)   [6839] we took the colour down.
Brenda (PS04U) [6840] but I love it.
               [6841] ... That's a normal skirting.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6842] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6843] This is what the decorators [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [6844] Oh yes.
               [6845] That's what I've got.
Brenda (PS04U) [6846] Yeah it's lovely.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6847] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6848] But Dave don't like it and he said the room's too small.
               [6849] ... And Peter's had that and he's had dado, and the dado
               bars!
Jean (PS04Y)   [6850] Ah!
Brenda (PS04U) [6851] They look so nice.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6852] [cough] What a lot of people are doing is ... they're not
               putting up rails but they're putting up a ... erm a border ...
               halfway up aren't they, or just not quite halfway up the wall.
               [6853] Have you seen that?
Brenda (PS04U) [6854] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6855] And perhaps with a different wallpaper below and above.
Brenda (PS04U) [6856] Below and ... above .
               [6857] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6858] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6859] Right.
               [6860] Let's just sort this out.
*** 49 (Tape 015406) ***
Brenda (PS04U) [6861] That's not very elegant, the milk on ... but never mind.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6862] [cough] I don't think that elegance is the main thing in
               my mind at the moment.
Brenda (PS04U) [6863] Oh it's really cold out there.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6864] We need it.
Brenda (PS04U) [6865] Take your book out there Jean.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6866] Yes I shall. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [6867] [shouting] Carla.
               [6868] Breakfast [] .
               [6869] ... We'll have eaten it all by the time you get in here.
               [6870] ... I've put the kettle on and then we'll have [...]
               another cup of tea in a minute.
               [6871] ... Oh it's nice to get cool isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6872] Isn't it?
               [6873] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6874] These were the things.
               [6875] I don't know if you've tried them.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6876] Oh.
               [6877] No I haven't.
Brenda (PS04U) [6878] And then with my ... tongue the way it is.
               [6879] They're the only ones that I can have.
               [6880] [...] [cereal packet rattling] they've got.
               [6881] ... Try one.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6882] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6883] And then they've got like iron and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6884] Nice. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [6885] It's got recommend , it's got the recommended daily
               amount of vitamins in it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6886] Oh.
Brenda (PS04U) [6887] And the recommended daily amount of iron in it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6888] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6889] That's what I mean with that Jean you probably won't need
               ... [laughing] vitamins [] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [6890] No you see I don't think normally people do.
               [6891] But they do say as you grow older yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6892] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6893] Cos your body isn't so efficient at processing the food
               you take in.
               [6894] No but I might, I won't
Brenda (PS04U) [6895] No but [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [6896] keep it up for ever more.
               [6897] But I thought I might have a ... a course of it.
               [6898] A month's vitamins perhaps.
               [6899] Just to ... top, make sure I'm topped up.
               [6900] But this is a good idea.
Brenda (PS04U) [6901] What's that?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6902] These, these flakes.
Brenda (PS04U) [6903] Yeah because there's a lot, I mean cereals have got a lot
               of vitamins and iron in ain't they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [6904] Well they're they're made ... that way aren't they?
Brenda (PS04U) [6905] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6906] They put them in. ... [chewing]
Brenda (PS04U) [6907] Ain't it funny this time of year, the garden always looks
               bare and scruffy and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6908] Mm.
               [6909] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6910] Got all cuttings in the bowls down there I took.
               [6911] I don't know if, I mean one's not surviving, I don't know
               if the others are gonna survive.
Jean (PS04Y)   [6912] Mm. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [6913] At people's houses I've taken cuttings of and
Jean (PS04Y)   [6914] Mm.
               [6915] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [6916] Cos Jenny is marvellous she, I mean ... next door she er
               ... she very rarely buys.
               [6917] She takes cuttings from everything she's got and

Carla (PS04X)  [7295] No if I have a box ... and like dad said put that thing
               in there.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7296] A shoe box would do it.
               [7297] Yes.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7298] Mm.

Jean (PS04Y)   [7303] Tell you what.
               [7304] Moss is the answer.
               [7305] ... Moss looks like miniature grass.
               [7306] If you can find some moss and ... dig it up and it lasts
               longer.
               [7307] It'll last.
Brenda (PS04U) [7308] Yeah.
               [7309] I don't know where you can find it though.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7310] No I haven't noticed any round here.
Brenda (PS04U) [7311] Don't think we get any.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7312] No.
               [7313] Perhaps you don't.
               [7314] Send you some from East Anglia. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [7315] Yeah [laugh] yeah.

               the different levels in, in Debenhams.

               [7330] Yes.
               [7331] Yes.

Jean (PS04Y)   [7341] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [7342] Mm that's right. ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [7343] It's been a rum old Christmas.

               [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [7345] Mm.
Carla (PS04X)  [7346] You could tell that wasn't a real Father Christmas
               though.
Brenda (PS04U) [7347] I bet Guildford though .
               [7348] I mean I haven't been to Guildford for ... oh god I don't
               know when I think probably with you the last time I went to
               Guildford.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7349] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [7350] I dunno when that was.
               [7351] Ages ago.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7352] Mm.
Carla (PS04X)  [7353] [...] I could tell that wasn't a real father Christmas at
               that ... thing.
               [7354] Cos he didn't have a beard. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [7355] No.
               [7356] Told you dad went to see the real father Christmas at
Carla (PS04X)  [7357] [laugh] he didn't have a beard on the one I went to see.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7358] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [7359] Well they have to have lots of pretends cos there's so
               many children.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7360] Mm
Carla (PS04X)  [7361] Ha.
Brenda (PS04U) [7362] And for good children the real father Christmas doesn't
               go.
               [7363] Like I told you.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7364] No quite.
               [7365] Quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [7366] So you have all these father Christmases in the shops ...
               for children that they can't miss out on Christmas but are
               sometimes naughty children.
               [7367] Cos you imagine the thousands of children there are.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7368] Mm.
Carla (PS04X)  [7369] Children?
Jean (PS04Y)   [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [7370] Children.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7371] Children. [laugh]
Carla (PS04X)  [7372] Kiddies.
               [7373] Kiddies.
Brenda (PS04U) [7374] Beg your pardon.
               [7375] Sorry.
               [7376] Erm ... and father Christmas couldn't go to every single
               child.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7377] No.
               [7378] Some years ago in, in New York I think it was ... the
               stores were taking on father Christmases.
               [7379] And they felt they were being exploited.
               [7380] You know they were only being taken on for a couple of
               months and ... they, they wanted to form a trade union but quite
               a lot of the tra er father Christmases wouldn't join a trade
               union.
               [7381] And eleven of them ... got involved in a fist fight in
               the middle of one of those [laughing] New York streets
               [laughing] .
Brenda (PS04U) [laugh]
Jean (PS04Y)   [7382] It must have been a lovely sight.
Brenda (PS04U) [7383] Lovely.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7384] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [7385] Have you watched any good videos lately?
               [7386] ... Tapes.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7387] Er ... let me think.
               [7388] Now what was the last thing I saw?
               [7389] I don't, I haven't watched many videos.
               [7390] Erm ... I say that but of course Neil borrows Arnold
               Schwarzenegger videos and I watch a bit of those .
Carla (PS04X)  [7391] He's lethal.
Brenda (PS04U) [7392] Mm.
               [7393] He's very good.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7394] He is excellent.
               [7395] But erm
Brenda (PS04U) [7396] See that's another thing you could have got Neil.
               [7397] The, the new erm kickboxer out.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7398] How much is that?
Brenda (PS04U) [7399] Ten ninety nine.
Carla (PS04X)  [7400] It's brilliant.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7401] Might consider it.
Brenda (PS04U) [7402] Lee, Lee said about it didn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [7403] Yes.
               [7404] Might consider that.
Brenda (PS04U) [7405] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7406] Yes.
               [7407] Erm but ... I haven't really watched any serious videos.
               [7408] ... The last ... erm ... quality
Brenda (PS04U) [7409] What is it you want?
               [7410] Oh Home Alone you want don't you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [7411] Oh yes.
Carla (PS04X)  [7412] No Three Men and a Little Lady as well.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7413] The last the last quality entertainment video that I
               watched was Pretty Woman but I didn't like it.
Carla (PS04X)  [7414] Oh that is brilliant.
Brenda (PS04U) [7415] Oh no I liked that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7416] Did you?
Brenda (PS04U) [7417] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7418] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [7419] I don't know why.
               [7420] I mean it was ...
Carla (PS04X)  [7421] kwa kwa kwa [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [7422] [laughing] Yeah that's what it [] .
               [7423] Erm I don't know what it was.
               [7424] I can't say
Jean (PS04Y)   [7425] Well she has a marvellously engaging ... personality.
Brenda (PS04U) [7426] Yes.
               [7427] That is what I think I liked about her.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7428] Yes.
               [7429] Mm.
               [7430] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [7431] I mean the fact ... and it, that it was, half of it was
               so true.
               [7432] I mean it's like when
Jean (PS04Y)   [7433] Some of it was.
Brenda (PS04U) [7434] she went into the ... the store.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7435] That was perfect.
Brenda (PS04U) [7436] They didn't want to know.
               [7437] But then when she went back!
Jean (PS04Y)   [7438] And when she went back and she said er ... you didn't
               serve me yesterday.
               [7439] No.
               [7440] You made a mistake.
               [7441] A big mistake.
               [7442] Huge.
               [7443] [laughing] And she's got this enormous hat box do you
               remember [] ? [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [7444] Yeah [laugh] .
               [7445] Yeah.
               [7446] Yeah no I, I don't know what, I quite liked that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7447] It irritated me a bit because ... what it ... what it was
               saying
Carla (PS04X)  [7448] [...] dirty but [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [7449] what it, what it was saying was ... in effect that the
               woman ... er so long as she's free and and open sexually then
               she can have whatever she wants.
               [7450] And of course A this is true [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [7451] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7452] and we don't like it.
               [7453] And B it isn't actually true at all because most, most
               men would simply exploit that in the situation she was in.
Brenda (PS04U) [7454] I say they wouldn't sort of spend like he did.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7455] No.
               [7456] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [7457] But I, I like you say I mean half of me
Jean (PS04Y)   [7458] There was something
Brenda (PS04U) [7459] I liked it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7460] Yeah.
               [7461] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [7462] But the other half it was crude.
Jean (PS04Y)   [7463] Yes.
               [7464] Oh yes.
               [7465] Yes it was crude but ...
Brenda (PS04U) [7466] What?
Carla (PS04X)  [7467] [...] in my book we have to make a bit like that look.
               [7468] Two lines.
               [7469] You have to put large there and little there.
               [7470] I could stick these, one of these there and put the big
               one there.
               [7471] In my book.
Brenda (PS04U) [7472] What, for your homework?
Carla (PS04X)  [7473] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [7474] Cos you gotta ... well haven't you got to write on that
               project?

               [7941] Well it's a city well isn't actually is it?
               [7942] It's a town and Neil would get more chance
Lee (PS04W)    [7943] Neil would get more chance in working.
               [7944] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [7945] Because you know there's a lot more going on in
               Guildford.
               [7946] Mind you I mean what I think Woking's going to be a lot
               more for youngsters.
               [7947] We've got the bowling alley opening in in February.
Lee (PS04W)    [7948] Yes ...
Brenda (PS04U) [7949] I don't know what kids would be able to afford it.
               [7950] So what age what age is it going to apply.
Lee (PS04W)    [7951] You see this business of Neil staying in bed all day.
               [7952] Part of it is that ... [...] interests.

               I think [...] I get well I just get I just think it's a waste of
               the day.
Lee (PS04W)    [7955] Well it is but I musn't let it annoy me Brenda because in
               a way he must know what he's doing.
Brenda (PS04U) [7956] Well that's it.
               [7957] I mean ...
Lee (PS04W)    [7958] He's probably used staying in bed as his escape.
Brenda (PS04U) [7959] Oh that's it cause you won't be so bored will you.
Lee (PS04W)    [7960] Got away from your mother and
Brenda (PS04U) [7961] The fact you're sleeping you're not thinking about it.
Lee (PS04W)    [7962] That's right.
               [7963] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [7964] And you know you try and sort of block things out.
               [7965] It's just a sort of mental
Lee (PS04W)    [7966] Yes yes
Brenda (PS04U) [7967] escape really.
               [7968] It's a sort of block out ...
Lee (PS04W)    [7969] I know that Pam Palmer said of one of her friends whose
               husband who's having he didn't like his work.
               [7970] He's not happy.
               [7971] And she said er Angela said to her oh poor Neil has to
               stays in bed until one o'clock every Saturday and then on Sunday
               he has a ... he gets up late and then he has a long rest in the
               afternoon and Pam said to me he's copping out.
Brenda (PS04U) [7972] Mm. ...
Lee (PS04W)    [7973] As you see Jerry who was at ease with [...] when he [...]
               like everybody and there were times when his job got him down.
               [7974] But his attitude ... he'd been taught to get on and do
               things so that he would be painting the back of the house or
               going on with his hobby or doing jobs on the car.
               [7975] He would just do them.
               [7976] ... Well you've got to get on with it haven't you?
Lee (PS04W)    [7977] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [7978] You can't you know.
               [7979] I'd be interested to know whether Neil did that list of
               things I asked him to do.
Lee (PS04W)    [7980] Like what?
Brenda (PS04U) [7981] Well I asked him to bring the dust bins in.
               [7982] Empty the dishwasher erm ... with Paul's help to re-hang
               the curtains.
               [7983] You know that my big the curtains to the patio?
               [7984] You know they're on brown rings with little little tiny
               screw screwed in metal rings in the brown things?
Lee (PS04W)    [7985] Hm.
Brenda (PS04U) [7986] And you thread them on the curtains through this little
               metal ring.
               [7987] Well those have started to come away.
               [7988] Now you can't just replace them.
               [7989] You've got to take the whole down.
               [7990] You've got to lift the whole lot off the wall and
               unthread the curtains and put back the right number of rings and
               hooks and it's a palaver and I haven't done it.
               [7991] I took the thing down but I haven't put it back.
               [7992] So I said the rings are in the top drawer of the bureau
               in the garage.
               [7993] If you go and get them get Paul to help you to remount
               the whole thing.
               [7994] It needs somebody with [...] or whatever you see.
Lee (PS04W)    [7995] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [7996] There's that to do.
               [7997] And what else was there?
               [7998] Oh I asked him to go to the insurance company and find
               out whether I'm covered with them for having my aerial replaced
               and I wrote a letter asking if he could be empowered to sign the
               claim form for me ...
Brenda (PS04U) [7999] Now I wonder whether he managed to do it?
Lee (PS04W)    [8000] Did you leave him a note?
               [8001] Or did you just ask him to do it?
Brenda (PS04U) [8002] I wrote it down.
               [8003] I wrote it all down I asked him as I wrote it down.
Lee (PS04W)    [8004] What did he say?
Brenda (PS04U) [8005] Well because he was half at the time it was just before I
               left at about nine to come down here you see.
Lee (PS04W)    [8006] Mm. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [8007] Having said that you don't know whether
Lee (PS04W)    [8008] You don't know
Brenda (PS04U) [8009] How he's feeling at the moment.
Lee (PS04W)    [8010] No no.
Brenda (PS04U) [8011] Oh I do know how he's feeling.
               [8012] He's feeling he's feeling defeated.
Lee (PS04W)    [8013] Well now ...
Brenda (PS04U) [8014] That's it.
               [8015] I mean the thing is.
               [8016] You try not to you know I mean.
               [8017] You think to yourself oh well.
               [8018] You know things will get better you just feel [...] Oh
               God!
               [8019] I've been through this
Lee (PS04W)    [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [8020] That's right.
               [8021] Every slightest thing is very dramatic to me.
Lee (PS04W)    [8022] Yes yes at the moment.
Brenda (PS04U) [8023] Where you know I would just take things in my stride.
               [8024] But the slightest thing is so stupid [...] .
               [8025] When I went to that stress management course we were told
               to use physical resources like deep breathing and actually
               making yourself sit down and making yourself go floppy.
               [8026] [...] and let every muscle let it relax.
               [8027] That was a power [...] ... [...] .
               [8028] That's [...] a week or so.
Lee (PS04W)    [8029] Oh marvellous.
Brenda (PS04U) [8030] When I first when I was first driving in the early 1970's
               you could park in the quarry car park any time you fancied
               except the few days before Christmas.
Lee (PS04W)    [8031] Don't they charge you?
Brenda (PS04U) [8032] Oh you you you paid but you could always get a place
               there ... I could remember a lot of parking time when I wasn't
               driving.
               [8033] As near enough all three parks were full.
Lee (PS04W)    [8034] Yes those days are over.
Brenda (PS04U) [8035] [...] again.
               [8036] They're meant to last three [...] two.
Lee (PS04W)    [8037] Oh. ... [cough] ...
Brenda (PS04U) [8038] Trees are lovely in that little [...] ...
Brenda (PS04U) [8039] There are a lot Carla she is so tired.
Lee (PS04W)    [8040] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [8041] Cause on a Friday night [...] all week she's in and
               Thursday night Friday night Saturday and Sunday it's all like
               rehearsals for the Sound of Music.
Lee (PS04W)    [8042] Yes yes ... Are you going to slacken down the dancing a
               bit when she's in secondary school?
Brenda (PS04U) [8043] Er well we'll see how she goes.
               [8044] The thing is I mean.
Lee (PS04W)    [8045] Like when she's in the first two classes it won't matter
               so but as she'll approach the G C S C
Brenda (PS04U) [8046] Yeah but I think now as she's so advanced in her dance
Lee (PS04W)    [8047] She is she's well on.
Brenda (PS04U) [8048] The fact is now I mean where like two years ago she was
               taking two and three exams at a time.
               [8049] Now ... it's just one sort of a year.
Lee (PS04W)    [8050] Yes yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [8051] Where it was twice or three times in a year.
               [8052] But now I think they don't many so it's not you know ...
               this up to sort of like thirteen they've been taught [...]
               constantly once to that age.
               [8053] I mean she's still you know less bothered about the older
               ones but it's very sort of because of the school work and
               Saturday jobs and
Lee (PS04W)    [8054] Mm yes
Brenda (PS04U) [8055] and all that I mean you know they're not hav they don't
               have to be as committed
Lee (PS04W)    [8056] [cough] No no.
Brenda (PS04U) [8057] When they're sort of younger
Lee (PS04W)    [8058] Mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [8059] Well she'll she'll I mean.
               [8060] I always find I say to Kim you know I mean you have all
               these you know it's like Shaun's giving up he's giving up his
               karate and his football and I said well you know I'm sorry but
               she shouldn't have let him.
Lee (PS04W)    [8061] No.
               [8062] I think
Brenda (PS04U) [8063] No.
               [8064] I mean it's about I mean you know I mean it's like today
               I mean Jeannie [...] said oh well you come with us shopping if
               you don't want to go dancing.
               [8065] You know I gave her the ultimatum like you can come with
               us but damn well I wouldn't have let her come.
Lee (PS04W)    [8066] No no.
Brenda (PS04U) [8067] You know I mean I sort
Lee (PS04W)    [8068] You [...] yes
Brenda (PS04U) [8069] But I mean the fact is there's no way she's got she gets
               the idea
Lee (PS04W)    [8070] You didn't hear me saying oh golly I'd love to have her
               come with us?
Brenda (PS04U) [8071] No that's it because
Lee (PS04W)    [8072] No I mean [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [8073] The fact is she's she's dedicated to her dancing.
               [8074] So
Lee (PS04W)    [8075] Mm she must be at this stage.
Brenda (PS04U) [8076] you know there's no ifs and buts skiving off because she
               wants to do something else.
               [8077] I mean the other week she wanted to go to a school disco
               and I said look hang on n get your priorities right.
               [8078] And I said okay and I said to her dance teacher in front
               of her she wants to go to a disco.
               [8079] And she said to her [...] she said er her teacher said to
               her oh you know do you ... what you were doing.
               [8080] She said well I'd like to go because it's my last year
               and her her teacher said to her well I'm sorry she said but no
               I'm not happy with you taking time off.
Lee (PS04W)    [8081] No no no
Brenda (PS04U) [8082] You've got exams coming up and I'd rather you
Lee (PS04W)    [8083] Quite quite yes yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [8084] be here.
Lee (PS04W)    [8085] Yes yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [8086] And then she said okay fair enough.
               [8087] I will.
Lee (PS04W)    [8088] Hm mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [8089] But erm
*** 54 (Tape 015505) ***
Brenda (PS04U) [8090] God that tape can't have finished.
Lee (PS04W)    [8091] Hm. ... turn itself off actually.
               [8092] It's being blooming awkward. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [8093] It's like being [...]
Lee (PS04W)    [...] ... [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [8094] It's so hot in my head. ...
Lee (PS04W)    [8095] It certainly was very hot in that house. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [8096] These shops never change in here do they?
Lee (PS04W)    [8097] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [8098] For years [...] I bet that mind you it looks quite a
               newish one that one and son.
               [8099] ... Chinese hot [...]
*** 55 (Tape 015506) ***
Brenda (PS04U)             [8100] I know it says the car park's full but I'm
                           going to try it.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8101] Yes. [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8102] Doopsey doopsey.
                           [8103] ... Normally you sit in er you know the
                           trouble is as long as the police aren't here.
                           [8104] If the police are here they make you go right
                           round and sit and wait.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8105] Oh I'll bet.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8106] This is sometimes it's a pain though it does
                           Oh my God!
Jean (PS04Y)               [8107] Blimey! ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8108] The trouble is if it's like this here it's
                           like this in all of them.
                           [8109] ... That's the only thing.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8110] What shall what what do you think of doing?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8111] Well I'll wait here for a bit I mean you'll
                           queue at the others if I turn round.
                           [8112] You see you get them.
                           [8113] See we're moving
Jean (PS04Y)               [8114] What what about the Quarry one?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8115] Where's that down at Debenhams?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8116] I don't know erm.
                           [8117] It's a bit out of the Town.
                           [8118] It's where we've just come up er ... but you
                           turn left.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8119] I think this will move Jean.
                           [8120] I mean I'm mean
Jean (PS04Y)               [8121] It seems to be moving pretty fast.
                           [8122] There's some movement.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8123] No it's cause it's it's it's only if the
                           police come they'll they'll move you on.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8124] Yes yeah.
                           [8125] A bit of excitement there. [cough]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8126] Didn't shut up. ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8127] Moving.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8128] See it normally does
Jean (PS04Y)               [8129] Mm
Brenda (PS04U)             [8130] move but ... sometimes the police will come
                           on and say I'm sorry but you've got to
Jean (PS04Y)               [8131] You're not allowed
Brenda (PS04U)             [8132] You know you've got to sort of move on.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8133] Yeah. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8134] On the whole ... [...] ... I mean there's
                           only three cars in front so ... [cough] .
                           [8135] What are those then?
                           [8136] Are they flats or are they to do with car
                           parks or what?
                           [8137] Above the [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8138] That's flats home [...] I wouldn't like to
                           live above a car park.
                           [8139] Would you?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8140] No ... Normally see I mean I'm surprised this
                           early before ten o'clock ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8141] Everybody else had the same idea.
                           [8142] Christmas shopping.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8143] You're right.
                           [8144] Imagine in December it would be absolutely
                           murder.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8145] Oh erm totally.
                           [8146] Totally out of the question. [cough] ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8147] Normally see as people as the cars come out
                           the lights change.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8148] Hm mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8149] Obviously this early is that's actually come
                           out.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8150] No no no. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8151] And the size of it I can't see it being full
                           up.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8152] No. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8153] Mention [...] ten o'clock she's got bags.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8154] Yes yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8155] I suppose a lot of people come in and they
                           know exactly what want.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8156] Yes yes .
Brenda (PS04U)             [8157] I mean I can't even know what shops we want.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8158] Yeah
Brenda (PS04U)             [8159] Rather than the
Jean (PS04Y)               [8160] And especially if they planned to go
                           somewhere else today.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8161] There's a car coming out so they should
                           change colour.
Jean (PS04Y)               [cough] ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8162] No it's on the outside.
                           [8163] No it's not on the outside.
                           [8164] Yes that's changed see? ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8165] One's gone in.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8166] Two's gone in. ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8167] Oh ha ha ha.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8168] No the police won't move us in on until we're
                           halfway here.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8169] Right.
                           [8170] Yeah [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8171] It's when you're sort of there.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8172] Hm hm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8173] She's caused more problems backing out from
                           here he's naughty behind me
Jean (PS04Y)               [8174] Yeah yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8175] cause he's come right across the
Jean (PS04Y)               [8176] The keep clear space yes yeah yeah
Brenda (PS04U)             [8177] Keep clear sign which he shouldn't have done.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8178] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8179] Even though they're coming out on the inside.
                           [8180] It's the outside they're coming out.
                           [8181] That's when the light changes.
                           [8182] It's like a magnet obviously see?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8183] On the outside?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8184] I wonder.

Jean (PS04Y)               [8278] Er

Jean (PS04Y)               [8280] Mm.

                           [8285] She says.
                           [8286] [laugh] ... I'm so thirsty.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8287] Mm.

Brenda (PS04U)             [8294] I suppose we get out of line then ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8295] When you're expecting jam and it turns out to
                           be marmalade it's quite a shock.
                           [8296] [laugh] It's marmalade.
Brenda (PS04U)             [laugh]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8297] I think it is.
                           [8298] It's very sharp ... Yeah thick cut marmalade.

                           the other day because she doesn't like to get
                           involved or say a lot but
Jean (PS04Y)               [8302] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8303] she was saying that you know mother is [...]
                           very evil and wicked.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8304] She knows?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8305] Oh yes she soon learnt.
                           [8306] She didn't want to say it but then in the end
Jean (PS04Y)               [8307] No.
                           [8308] It came out.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8309] It came out and she said you know she very
                           the way she treats you
Jean (PS04Y)               [8310] Mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8311] She's just unbelievable.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8312] Mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8313] She just couldn't believe that's the way
Jean (PS04Y)               [8314] I mean your mother tries to torment you.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8315] It just doesn't sink in any more.
                           [8316] I mean it's just you know that [...] gone
                           wrong and it doesn't
Jean (PS04Y)               [8317] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8318] I could do with a couple of those.
                           [8319] I like those stands with the marble tops.

                           practical than a lot of the traditional stuff that's
                           sold in the shops at vast expense isn't it?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8326] Mm ... [...] it's dished up in that [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8327] Mm mm. [...] .

                           ... The only the only department is the cosmetics
                           that's not ... we'll ask when we get there.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8330] Mm mm. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8331] It's not half past ten already is it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8332] Hm.
                           [8333] I was just thinking.
                           [8334] Returning from Stone Market.
                           [8335] I had a taxi at twenty past nine.
                           [8336] I arrived at the station in good time for the
                           train but I didn't have to wait more than three or
                           four minutes and I was in London at ten to eleven.
                           [8337] That's not bad going is it?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8338] No.

Brenda (PS04U)             [8340] Leave the [...] from the journey.

Brenda (PS04U)             [8342] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8343] Yeah.
                           [8344] Journeys are funny.
                           [8345] You'd think because we live on you know
                           Woking is on top of us but it's but it I notice that
                           it was quite you know a time.
                           [8346] By the time we sat down here I thought well
                           considering that we came in by car door to door
                           practically and that when the driving wasn't [...]
                           public transport it it's taken quite a time to get
                           into [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8347] It's we actually got car locked didn't we?
                           [8348] We left home at half past nine.
                           [8349] So it's taken an hour just to drop her off,
                           Get parked and get in here.
                           [8350] It's taken an hour.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8351] Mm mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8352] Like you say you could sort of travel into
                           London in that hour couldn't you?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8353] Yes yes strange isn't it?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8354] Strange how it works.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8355] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8356] ... Interesting to see people's bags [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8357] Hm .
Brenda (PS04U)             [8358] Inside of that everything else.

                           highchair smashed it ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8360] Mm mm. ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8361] Now unless you're out with your husband I
                           can't see the point of bringing your baby out on
                           Christmas shopping ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8362] It's too crowded for the kid isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8363] Mm.
                           [8364] mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8365] Mind you some people I suppose have got no
                           option.
                           [8366] That they have to.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8367] Yeah ... My preferred option would be to
                           leave the chap at home with the baby.
                           [8368] That's what I did when Ann was small ... But
                           then Jerry wasn't interested in shopping anyway.
                           [8369] He quite liked to leave it to me.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8370] No.
                           [8371] Rather be home and let you get on with it.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8372] Hm hm hm. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8373] I think you get you get either a man who
                           really likes shopping don't you?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8374] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8375] Or ones that always just totally dislike it.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8376] Yes ... That's [...] engaged to.
                           [8377] He loved shopping.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8378] Really?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8379] Woolworths Marks and Spencers [...] Discount
                           Stores [...] all the absolutely.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8380] What about the guy that she's seeing at the
                           moment?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8381] Oh I don't know.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8382] Don't know?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8383] I have only met him twice.
                           [8384] ... By the operation of sod's law I wouldn't
                           mind betting that this nice old man will turn out to
                           be a lovely companion and will treat me as I like
                           men to treat me.
                           [8385] With great respect and kindness and fun and
                           then I will sell the house and the great
Brenda (PS04U)             [8386] And they'll say that's a good scoop.
                           [8387] Getting a [...] out isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8388] Mm ...
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [8389] Sausage roll. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8390] [...] just a bit sort of all right.

Jean (PS04Y)               [8393] No.
                           [8394] [...] What was he coming over for?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8395] For the suit for Liz.

Jean (PS04Y)               [8398] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8399] But I should think knowing him he'll know
                           what it's like.
                           [8400] He normally parks down by the old A A.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8401] Oh yes
Brenda (PS04U)             [8402] And walks in ... Do you ever sort this

                           [8404] It's easy.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8405] Is it just like a mayonnaise sauce.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8406] Hm.
                           [8407] ... Yeah ...

Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [8409] Her.
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [8410] Number ten? ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8411] What time did you tell Marge?
                           [8412] Or did you not tell her a time?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8413] I said fivish.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8414] Oh.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8415] That was right wasn't it?

Jean (PS04Y)               [8420] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8421] I'd like to see what less we got off.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8422] Mm. ...

Jean (PS04Y)               [8424] Yes I in with the Debs card yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8425] When you pick your Debs card up.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8426] You'll find your Debs Card. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8427] That's it.

                           [8431] ... It's my ability to leave lose these
                           things is is wonderful.
                           [8432] Matchless. ...
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [8433] Sorry. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8434] That black top.
                           [8435] That sweatshirt top that I got [...] which
                           was seventeen ninety nine.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8436] You got that for
Brenda (PS04U)             [8437] Thirteen pounds fifty five ... erm ...
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [8438] Yes please. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8439] Thirty two pounds off.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8440] Mm.
                           [8441] That's marvellous ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8442] So it should would have been a hundred and
                           forty five.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8443] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8444] God there's a hell of a difference isn't
                           there?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8445] Yes it is.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8446] But the only thing awkward I suppose about
                           that is the fact you've got to erm carry it around.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8447] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8448] All right I mean all right she did so that
                           one of the guys would perhaps carry it around for
                           you.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8449] You don't like to ask them
Brenda (PS04U)             [8450] But you don't like to because of the fact ...
                           you know he'll be erm sort of lugging it around and
                           you'd feel you'd actually have to sort of hurry him
                           up wouldn't you?
                           [8451] You know hurry up
Jean (PS04Y)               [8452] Yes yes
Brenda (PS04U)             [8453] because ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8454] When I ... have been entertaining Shirley and
                           Terry Jones doing an evening meal on a Saturday or a
                           Sunday and sometimes both to help Shirley when she
                           was getting into the run of going back to work ... I
                           found that one of the cheapest of dinner party
                           deserts was lemon meringue pie.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8455] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8456] And everybody likes it.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8457] It always goes down well doesn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8458] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8459] Christmas time whenever.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8460] Mm. ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8461] And to take the hex off it ... I ... grate
                           the lemons the day before and wrap the grated rind
                           in cling film.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8462] Yeah you do that don't you?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8463] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8464] I know that one you made last time you were
                           down.
                           [8465] There's no waste in our house .
Jean (PS04Y)               [8466] That's right I No. [laugh] ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8467] What's [...] having.
                           [8468] Having turkey for Christmas or?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8469] Hm?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8470] They having turkey at Christmas or don't they
                           let you know?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8471] I don't know what they'll have.
                           [8472] You see Mary Ann and Mitch are vegetarian ...

Brenda (PS04U)             [8473] Are they going for dinner as well at Richard?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8474] Oh I think so.
                           [8475] Yes I think it's going to be a proper family
                           Christmas. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8476] The trouble with that if you turn it down
Jean (PS04Y)               [8477] Then that would be awful.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8478] Even this is probably this one year you could
                           probably done with
Jean (PS04Y)               [8479] I could have done with saving some.
                           [8480] I would've liked to have looked after me and
                           kept an eye on the rest with Paul.
Brenda (PS04U)             [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8481] Yes.
                           [8482] Everybody.
                           [8483] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8484] It's fairly typical though isn't it?
                           [8485] One year you could do with
Jean (PS04Y)               [8486] Mm mm mm .
Brenda (PS04U)             [8487] staying around ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8488] You mean as it is?
                           [8489] I think that Neil was a bit of a sensitive
                           area.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8490] Hm.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8491] You know I'm I'm spending money and time on
                           him that really I suppose in theory I would be
                           spending on my own grandchildren.
                           [8492] However I take the attitude that in modern
                           times people don't people are not obliged
Brenda (PS04U)             [8493] The thing is who else
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [8494] All right?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8495] to feel by duty as it were that they ought to
                           take notice of their immediate family.
                           [8496] John and Maryanne are capable of financially
                           supporting themselves.
                           [8497] So I don't worry about the money aspect.
                           [8498] And in every other way psychologically
                           emotionally morally they are able to look after
                           themselves.
                           [8499] Neil isn't.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8500] I think [...] and I think that's that's
                           saying ... you can't pick your families.
                           [8501] You can pick your friends.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8502] Mm.
                           [8503] It is true.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8504] So true.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8505] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8506] Because
Jean (PS04Y)               [8507] You found it so.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8508] You can do without that hassle and at least
                           if you've a good relationship you got a good [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)               [8509] Mm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8510] At least there's not a lot of chance to have
                           hassles.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8511] No no.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8512] But that's how relationships should be.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8513] Mm mm.
                           [8514] ... It is one of the great arguments for the
                           old fashioned sort of religion.
                           [8515] Which you could turn you could legitimately
                           turn to people and say ... why are you leaning on me
                           so hard for all this support?
                           [8516] You ought to be reading your bible saying
                           your prayers going to church and getting in touch
                           with the boss.
                           [8517] That's why I laughed when they were said
                           Terry Waite would need counselling.
                           [8518] I bet that Terry Waite was praying his head
                           off and he'd memorised masses of the bible which he
                           would be reciting to himself probably said he
                           thought two o'clock every afternoon I'll remember
                           what I can of Book of Isaiah you know.
                           [8519] I don't suppose he needed any counselling.
                           [8520] He'd do better counselling other people.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8521] That's right.
                           [8522] Yes.
                           [8523] Because I mean he's he's er needs it all.
                           [8524] Even though he's been to a prison I mean.
                           [8525] He's seen what's going on and [...] five
                           years is it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8526] Yes yes.
                           [8527] [...] voluntary bit.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8528] Thank you.
                           [8529] ... It's delicious.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8530] Beautiful stuff isn't it?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8531] I really want another.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8532] In East Anglia people either in the on their
                           pub lunches they either throw themselves on to that
                           or on to treacle pudding.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8533] Yeah but often it's a bit heavy though isn't
                           it?

                           [...] chocolate ho ho!
Brenda (PS04U)             [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8538] We've really eaten East Anglia [laugh] ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8539] Don't often see an older man in white white
                           jumpers.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8540] No.
                           [8541] He looks nice.
                           [8542] Mm. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8543] [...] they have got some nice men's clothes.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8544] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8545] They do I mean the women usually buy men's
                           clothes
Jean (PS04Y)               [8546] Yes Hm mm ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8547] Do you buy Dave's clothes for him?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8548] No I mean women buy them to wear.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8549] Oh yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8550] [...] these coats erm from men's department.
                           [8551] They just like to sort of I don't know why
                           but they just seem to sort of
Jean (PS04Y)               [8552] Well men's the fabrics of men's clothing is
                           better stronger.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8553] Hm.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8554] Because men feel cold more.
                           [8555] I mean they can wear if you think about it
                           they wear suits in the middle of summer where we're
                           into sleeveless linen dresses.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8556] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8557] Erm and er the colours for men by tradition
                           are much I think they're much subtler ... Hm.
                           [8558] ... My I hope they reopen at Bernie.
                           [8559] This isn't too bad actually but and I hope
                           you know
Brenda (PS04U)             [8560] It's quite nice.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8561] It's done done as well enough but I do prefer
                           a Bernie.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8562] [...] Do you remember that girl?
                           [8563] She was always
Jean (PS04Y)               [8564] Oh yes.
                           [8565] Lovely person .
Brenda (PS04U)             [8566] She was very cheerful very very nice.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8567] I wonder if they have come up against a
                           rapacity of the of the rates.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8568] But don't you remember they kept kept saying
                           they were going to shut us down shut us down and
                           then six months later we went there and then ah no
                           they're not shut us down and
Jean (PS04Y)               [8569] No no.
                           [8570] ... Yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8571] Goodness there's a great sort of burden off
                           isn't it all this sort of shopping er you got to go
                           [...] we finished all the shop and that's it.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8572] Mm.
                           [8573] What have we got to do next?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8574] Smiths [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8575] And I must make a real effort to find one of
                           these machines that's working.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8576] Outside the post office.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8577] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8578] Er We've got to get Smiths and we've got to
                           get.

Brenda (PS04U)             [8583] Erm Debs we've completed.

Brenda (PS04U)             [8595] And that one.
                           [8596] You can have them all.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8597] The heavy [...] doing them justice. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8598] [...] isn't it?
                           [8599] ... So is Jackie spending Christmas on her
                           own or you don't know?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8600] No I think that they'll probably go down to
                           the Mum and [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8601] Have they made any sort of new friends where
                           they are?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8602] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8603] No?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8604] There aren't any people where they are.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8605] Aren't they?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8606] No.
                           [8607] They are next door neighbours who I think are
                           very nice but I don't think that Jackie and Nev have
                           a lot in common with.
                           [8608] ... That's one house that adjoins them and
                           then a little further on it's a lane.
                           [8609] It's about as wide as this Brenda.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8610] Well what do they need?
                           [8611] What what area is it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8612] It's called Fenn Lane
Brenda (PS04U)             [8613] How much is it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8614] And it's in between St Mary and Needham
                           market.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8615] And how far is it from you?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8616] About a between ten and fifteen minutes drive
                           I suppose.
                           [8617] Ten minutes perhaps.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8618] Oh it's not far.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8619] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8620] Still doing her kitchen job?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8621] Yes and she phoned me and she said I feel as
                           though I dropped out of the bottom of the world she
                           said.
                           [8622] You know I just don't see anybody.
                           [8623] Well of course you're working on Monday.
                           [8624] You see she used to have Mondays to herself
                           and I would often go round on a Monday afternoon and
                           we could we could talk.
                           [8625] But that's gone and I said I can't run in at
                           half past five when you get home from school and
                           chat to you because Nev will be coming at six and I
                           don't want to be there all that often when he's
                           there erm ... it's just you know it's just happened.
                           [8626] And I also thought to myself and I'm probably
                           going to move a lot further away than Fenn Lane.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8627] She doesn't I mean she doesn't bother that
                           much now does she?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8628] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8629] I mean I think [...] been up
Jean (PS04Y)               [8630] She can with a true friend.
                           [8631] I'm very sorry for her because I think she
                           and Nev have made a really a quite ferocious mess of
                           their lives.
                           [8632] Nev never intended to be slaving away doing
                           kitchen fitting.
                           [8633] He wanted to wood sculpture that was his idea
                           in
Brenda (PS04U)             [8634] And slow down a bit didn't he ?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8635] Yes yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8636] Cause he's almost
Jean (PS04Y)               [8637] He's on the gallop and he looks very old and
                           worn.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8638] Does he?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8639] Mm.
                           [8640] And she never wanted to return to full time
                           teaching.
                           [8641] It's providential for her that she's got a
                           job that she's very good at and that she enjoys.
                           [8642] In an extremely nice school.
Brenda (PS04U)             [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8643] And my handkerchief such as it is if she is
                           [...] no.
                           [8644] I'll have to go to the loo or something to
                           get some paper I shan't worry about.
                           [8645] Such a perishing bore [cough] Oh bless you
                           thank you very much.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8646] Knew I had a [tape cut out] ... I hope to get
                           it.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8647] Hm mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8648] And Jackie's
Jean (PS04Y)               [8649] That's right and who knows.
                           [8650] When we go into Smith's in Woking I've got
                           myself
Brenda (PS04U)             [8651] Busy
Brenda (PS04U)             [8652] I might see something for Jackie.
                           [8653] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8654] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8655] It's only two o'clock.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8656] I'm amazed.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8657] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8658] Yeah.
                           [8659] And I really feel like going back putting my
                           feet up and chatting to you a bit more because we
                           haven't chatted enough have we?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8660] [...] we have always got the bulk [...] we
                           are only going to be in Woking an hour.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8661] Yes.
                           [8662] We haven't chatted enough [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8663] [...] will you [...] the er tapes [...] .
                           [8664] You really feel that we've really put into it
                           and really done well haven't we?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8665] Oh I couldn't have done a quarter of it.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8666] And I think I'm left with two people and
                           that's it.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8667] I couldn't have a quarter of it.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8668] No.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8669] I'd have dithered and I'd have got tired and
                           I'd gone off of
Brenda (PS04U)             [8670] Oh well I think I well I'll come back off
                           holiday
Jean (PS04Y)               [8671] That's right I'll do it again and I'll have
                           another go at it.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8672] Well I could have spent the whole week.
                           [8673] I just I just I could have spent five
                           afternoons and it was finished.
                           [8674] I could have done more [...] .
                           [8675] I don't think I would have done.
                           [8676] Cause I work at [...] cause a couple of weeks
                           ago I thought I God I'll make an effort.
                           [8677] I thought
Jean (PS04Y)               [8678] I think it makes a very big difference
                           knowing that [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8679] Yeah [...] without having to think too hard.
                           [8680] And still you make sure I mean you know for
                           that what I've spent.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8681] Oh it was well worth
Jean (PS04Y)               [8682] Oh it was well C
Brenda (PS04U)             [8683] It's got everybody.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8684] Yeah it was within you budget and you've done
                           the lot.
                           [8685] I went over budget but then I expected I
                           would.
                           [8686] Cause for one thing I was buying for more.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8687] Yes.
                           [8688] You know did you I mean none of us realised
                           you had thirty odd to buy [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8689] But I remember when you said that that last
                           year
Brenda (PS04U)             [8690] Fifty odd.
                           [8691] I think fifty three.
                           [8692] Yeah
Jean (PS04Y)               [8693] And I think the year before years before I've
                           had something like forty or thirty five.
                           [8694] In what you might call quiet years.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8695] Funny those [...] in Smiths for two pounds
                           off are lovely.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8696] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8697] And the ones we saw in Marks and all that
                           were nothing were they?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8698] And it pays to travel about ... You see the
                           problem with Jackie and Nev is always been that they
                           can't believe that you can get things in a place
                           like W H Smiths that will that will do very nicely
                           as a Christmas present.
                           [8699] They tend to go always to the top of the
Brenda (PS04U)             [8700] But it doesn't pay
Jean (PS04Y)               [8701] Oh yes yes.
                           [8702] They go a a Medici shop or Athena or whatever
                           and they're looking at the best.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8703] Well you can't afford to ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8704] See Mary Ann and Mitch are giving up on erm
                           buying Christmas presents because she says you're
                           buying things for people and they [...] everybody's
                           [...] therefore I think that tokeny things are the
                           best.
                           [8705] And that's what I've bought this year.
                           [8706] Tokeny things
Brenda (PS04U)             [8707] And is that is that what she's doing?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8708] They're buying disposable presents like
                           giving theatre vouchers and erm I don't know what
                           else but she said disposable things that people can
                           have some fun with .
Brenda (PS04U)             [8709] Good idea isn't it ?
                           [8710] Mm. ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8711] And what I'm giving is just something nice in
                           the spirit of Christmas but it hasn't broken my bank
                           or my back.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8712] Things done in one.
                           [8713] How these people go week after week after
                           week looking for bargain I mean Chris I mean we
                           picked up some bargains today but how you can go
                           week I mean it's okay yes [...] but when you're
                           Christmas shopping you can't go for [...] because
                           it's just
Jean (PS04Y)               [8714] No no you can't
Brenda (PS04U)             [8715] Because it's just so I mean that C and A is
                           so busy all the it gets it gets so claustrophobic .
Jean (PS04Y)               [8716] Mm mm yeah . ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8717] Look at this traffic coming in now.
                           [8718] ... And I think the way we did it we marked
                           down the three shops we wanted to do and make sure
                           you do those three shops. ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8719] I don't think that even though by [...] next
                           year I would be a bit better of in the sense that I
                           should have sold my house bought something cheaper
                           and have some capital invested so that I have a
                           little extra monthly income.
                           [8720] I should be living in some where that's
                           cheaper to run.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8721] You don't know you might end up with this
                           this little old chap you're with.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8722] Oh I wouldn't mind but I wouldn't marry
                           anybody [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8723] You might live with him.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8724] Mm mm on and off.
                           [8725] You don't know do you?
                           [8726] You don't know.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8727] I mean then yes you can buy a smaller even
                           more so then.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8728] Well I would.
                           [8729] I I mean I intend to keep my own roof
                           whatever.
                           [8730] Neil can be in it and look after it.
                           [8731] Yes erm ... but I don't think I'll ever again
                           buy expensive Christmas presents in the way that I
                           did in the past.
                           [8732] Spending forty and fifty pounds a head on
Brenda (PS04U)             [8733] A head?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8734] for mm
Brenda (PS04U)             [8735] Isn't it?
                           [8736] Like the gents' track suits and
Jean (PS04Y)               [8737] Yes.
                           [8738] ... No I can't er I can't think of myself as
                           doing that again.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8739] I think it's it's like those candies there's
                           lots of little things you know which people are
                           buying.
                           [8740] It's like those bags I mean le I mean I'd go
                           [...] if they bought me one of those bags.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8741] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8742] You know if er people don't oh no they're
                           only one twenty five and you can't buy someone that.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8743] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8744] But it's not not not the issue of it is it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8745] No no it isn't. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8746] Huge [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8747] Mm.
                           [8748] [...] home people Brenda and I thought
                           Guildford between us.
                           [8749] ... Yesterday we bought Camberley.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8750] Yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8751] Oh yes. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8752] [...] thing we got so many of each [laugh]
                           yes. ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8753] A bit cold.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8754] Mm ... Oh ooh [laugh] ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8755] Well I think that's a good idea though that
                           he's got boxes from Marks.
                           [8756] I bet they'll be a real seller ... those
                           boxes which [...] No wonder they call them underwear
                           boxes.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8757] Oh yes!
Brenda (PS04U)             [8758] If you had to buy a box then the tissue paper
                           then the bow
Jean (PS04Y)               [8759] Oh I know .
                           [8760] The time consumed in getting it all in.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8761] All I would do with it just to fancy it up
                           you know to buy some of that pink sheering stuff
Jean (PS04Y)               [8762] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8763] and curl it.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8764] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8765] and just tie it on the top.
                           [8766] Yeah ... You've saved on wrapping paper
Jean (PS04Y)               [8767] Yes. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8768] I've got to get some petrol ... I have to get
                           at [...] ... When did you ask me in Guildford [...]
                           B H S now?
Jean (PS04Y)               [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8769] You said it was for a B H S [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)               [8770] That's right.
                           [8771] Erm ... I can't ... It'll come to me ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8772] I like how many of those tops you got on?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8773] I've only got this one.
                           [8774] I had a cream one and it got wrecked by going
                           I think Neil put it in the wash with one of his
                           black T-shirts.
                           [8775] It came out all [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [8776] Really it's really flattering top.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8777] It is.
                           [8778] It's very soft and easy to wear and
Brenda (PS04U)             [8779] Yeah.
                           [8780] Erm [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [8781] Well I don't know erm they're warm.
                           [8782] They are warm and but it's colour I don't
                           know whether I ... perhaps if I saw cream again this
                           year I might buy it but erm I'm not sure that I want
                           to when this deep orangy colour.
                           [8783] I bought a red one in a different style but
                           the same sort of fabric in Benthalls.
                           [8784] Do you remember?
                           [8785] When I bought that black and white check
                           skirt
Brenda (PS04U)             [8786] Oh yeah .
Jean (PS04Y)               [8787] I bought a red blouse
Brenda (PS04U)             [8788] You worn that ?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8789] Yes but the sleeve [...] the wrong side.
                           [8790] I'm picking the sleeve head and trying to get
                           it together.
                           [8791] And I would have got it together if I'd had
                           time [...] had gone out to work instead of for days
                           on end being unemployed and sitting and telling me
                           about Karen.
                           [8792] Honestly Brenda you pay for being nice.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8793] Oh but he he said the same things [...] He
                           goes on and
Jean (PS04Y)               [8794] Of course he does.
                           [8795] He goes over and over yeah.
                           [8796] Doesn't listen to a word I say.
                           [8797] Like the woman's no good [laugh] ... Of
                           course I told [...] some things about Wendy.
                           [8798] But it really made yet more hair fall off the
                           top of his bald head.
                           [8799] I said fairly bluntly.
                           [8800] I said look a working woman needs a working
                           man to help support herself and her children.
                           [8801] I said no nobody is going to be able these
                           days woman not be able to support herself on twenty
                           hours a week which is what Karen does putting out
                           bread in the Asda.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8802] Is she the original one then.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8803] She's the original one.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8804] She's not the one that was coming around with
                           the baby?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8805] No.
                           [8806] It was Michelle who was coming around with
                           the baby.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8807] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8808] And I found two pairs of Michelle's knickers
                           after that and I didn't know what I shou .
                           [8809] Now I don't know how they managed this dear
                           because [laugh] she was coming round in the day with
                           little Donna with her and I was around and there you
                           are you see.
                           [8810] Indeed love will find a way.
                           [8811] Anyway erm I said to him look.
                           [8812] A women needs a man to support her.
                           [8813] I said mark the chap that she's got at the
                           moment is taking her out to discos and things and
                           she'll find that he doesn't really want to kick in
                           and help to support her.
                           [8814] I said she she might well come back to you.
                           [8815] I said she's tried to keep you on a string
                           just in case she didn't land the next fish.
                           [8816] He looked horrified.
                           [8817] You know as far as he's concerned it's all
                           love and glamour.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8818] How come she took him back then?
                           [8819] She didn't want [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)               [8820] Well I think that she was trying to keep him
                           dangling so that she'd have somebody to fall back on
                           if she didn't land another man.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8821] But wasn't she sort of playing around with
                           another man?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8822] She is now.
                           [8823] She is now yes.
                           [8824] She's now carrying on.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8825] What did he say?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8826] Erm he's seen the man going in and out of the
                           house.
                           [8827] She's told him that she's got this other man.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8828] Cause I can remember him saying before he
                           used to drive round to spy.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8829] Yes.
                           [8830] Well there is another man and she has told
                           Paul that frankly she's lapping up the attention.
                           [8831] He's taking her out for meals and they're
                           having a good time together you know.
                           [8832] Quite strange but as soon as he's paid for
                           for the goods and got the goods the chap's going to
                           go off looking for another.
                           [8833] Yes.
                           [8834] Cause he doesn't want to stay with her.
                           [8835] But I've told Paul that if he goes back to
                           Karen and [...] you know takes some his things out.
                           [8836] Then he takes all of his things out and
                           himself and he never comes back.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8837] Is he is he
Jean (PS04Y)               [8838] I've had this twice and each time it's been
                           upheaval because he's got a lot of goods which had
                           to moved in shoe horned in moved peoples belongings
                           out of one cupboard into another.
                           [8839] And the second time round it's been perfect
                           for him because he bought from Karen's house the
                           Hoover and the saucepans and everything that was
                           his.
                           [8840] Everything that belonged to him.
                           [8841] ... But he said that before ... I said why
                           was Michelle able to come in between you and Karen.
                           [8842] He said well Karen had been getting moody.
                           [8843] He said Karen is getting [...] .
                           [8844] Paul is boring.
                           [8845] She's told Paul that he's boring.
                           [8846] ... What Paul needs is this little girl who
                           doesn't care whether a man's a bit boring.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8847] Yes.
                           [8848] Because I can imagine Paul being sort of a
                           homely chap.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8849] He is.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8850] If he gets the right sort
Jean (PS04Y)               [8851] He is.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8852] league with someone who can put up with his
                           sort of
Jean (PS04Y)               [8853] quietness and
Brenda (PS04U)             [8854] conversation cause he likes to chat and this.
                           [8855] But I mean
Jean (PS04Y)               [8856] Yes yes yes He's a pleasant enough chap.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8857] He is isn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8858] Yes.
                           [8859] But he is not erm a playboy.
                           [8860] He's not going to spend money on ... like
                           Pete was forever buying Pam cheap jewellery from
                           Ratners and erm things of that nature.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8861] Did he ever get back with her?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8862] Well she tells me that she's going to throw
                           Shaun out because Shaun is boring er dun put er
                           Shaun she has no respect for she says because he
                           hasn't got a job.
                           [8863] He won't get a job he won't work.
                           [8864] And she said to me what did I think of the
                           idea of taking Pete back.
                           [8865] Once they were properly divorced taking him
                           back just as er a lover.
                           [8866] And I said that sounds to me to be a very
                           good idea.
                           [8867] I said then you're not at his mercy because
                           anybody to whose at Pete's mercy will suffer.
                           [8868] He's got a very nasty streak.
                           [8869] He's got a nasty snide way of putting things.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8870] Has he?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8871] Oh yes nasty.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8872] But he's he's quite fond of her isn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)               [8873] Oh he adores her.
                           [8874] Oh yes he wants her back.
                           [8875] And I said she said I you see I know him.
                           [8876] I said there's a lot to be said for a chap
                           that you inside out know his ways and how to cope
                           with them but never ever put yourself at his mercy
                           ... by marrying him.
                           [8877] And the house will be hers you see when
                           they're properly divorced.
                           [8878] It will be in her name.
                           [8879] So if he starts coming the old soldier she
                           can bung him out.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8880] Did she bail herself out in the end with over
                           her money situation.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8881] Oh yeah I went guarantor for that.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8882] Oh you had did you have to pay the money?
                           [8883] Because you
Jean (PS04Y)               [8884] No no she managed I told her on pain of death
                           not to tell Pete that I was backing
Brenda (PS04U)             [8885] Mm
Jean (PS04Y)               [8886] erm cause otherwise he would of sat back and
                           said oh Jean can pay that.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8887] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8888] But she knew that in the last resort that if
                           he did win [...] that I would do it but he's he's
                           paid off now.
                           [8889] ... As soon as he paid off he went on the
                           dole again.
                           [8890] ... He's quite a gypsy you know he looks like
                           a gypsy.
                           [8891] Did you meet him?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8892] No never met him.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8893] Oh!
                           [8894] ... Plausible rogue.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8895] My God!
                           [8896] Look at the queue to get into the car park.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8897] [...] Is it?
                           [8898] No?

Jean (PS04Y)               [8900] Oh you're going right oh yes you haven't got
                           your right no.

Brenda (PS04U)             [8902] What's he [...] He don't need to [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)               [8903] No.
                           [8904] Something [...] ... .
Brenda (PS04U)             [8905] No I've never sort of come across him.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8906] You might yet.
Brenda (PS04U)             [8907] You said he was sort of looked gypsified.

                           that are by Woolworths ...

                           happen to know of?
Brenda (PS04U)             [8913] Well it's just er office car park and I
                           normally use it.
                           [8914] We don't come into the I just thought as we
                           want Smiths and Intersports
Jean (PS04Y)               [8915] Mm mm.

Jean (PS04Y)               [8917] Yeah
Brenda (PS04U)             [8918] rather than walk all the way from Woolworths.
Jean (PS04Y)               [8919] Yeah.

                           get actually except er
Brenda (PS04U)             [8925] Book.
                           [8926] That's all.

                           forward.

                           forward.

                           [8933] I mean ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [8934] I'd actually I don't think I'll get a book

                           ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [8978] Well what's Marg doing now then?

                           off.

                           and an upstairs, and when that went there was
                           nothing to replace it ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [9015] Are you ready to go?
Jean (PS04Y)               [9016] Yes, I'm just, just scrobbling about Brenda
                           to see where I've put my purse.

Jean (PS04Y)               [9130] Oh I think so, yes, I think it's going to be
                           a proper family Christmas ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [9131] Probably like you say, if you turn it down
Jean (PS04Y)               [9132] Oh that would be awful.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9133] Before
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [9134] Number eleven .
Brenda (PS04U)             [9135] even this, it's probably this one year you
                           could probably eat a [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [9136] I could of done the same at home, I would of
                           liked to have looked after Neil ... and kept my own
                           electric [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [9137] [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)               [9138] Yes, everybody, yes.
                           [9139] It's fairly typical though isn't it one year
                           you
Brenda (PS04U)             [9140] Mm, mm .
Jean (PS04Y)               [9141] could do with
Brenda (PS04U)             [9142] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)               [9143] staying around ... you mean [...] .
                           [9144] I think that Neil is a bit of a sensitive
                           area.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9145] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)               [9146] You know, cos I'm, I'm spending money and
                           time on him that really has those in theory I would
                           be spending on my own grand children, however, I
                           take the attitude that in modern times, people
                           don't, people are not obliged
Brenda (PS04U)             [9147] The thing is today our
Jean (PS04Y)               [9148] To feel , by duty as it were, that they ought
                           to take notice of their immediate family, John and
                           Maryann are capable of financially supporting
                           themselves, so I don't worry about the money aspect
                           and in every other way physiologically, emotionally,
                           immorally they, they are able to look after
                           themselves Neil isn't .
Brenda (PS04U)             [9149] But I think, yeah, and I think that, that,
                           saying ... you can't pick your families, you can
                           pick your friends.
Jean (PS04Y)               [9150] Mm, this is true.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9151] So true
Jean (PS04Y)               [9152] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9153] because nine times out of ten
Jean (PS04Y)               [9154] You found it so?
Brenda (PS04U)             [9155] [eating] well you can do without without that
                           hassle, I mean, with [...] a relationship you've got
                           a good [...]
Jean (PS04Y)               [9156] Mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9157] at least, there's not a lot of types that
                           have hassle's.
Jean (PS04Y)               [9158] No, no.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9159] But that's how relationships should be.
Jean (PS04Y)               [9160] Mm, mm ... its one of the great arguments
                           from the old fashioned sort of religion, that you
                           could turn, you could definitely turn to people and
                           say ... why are you leaning on me so hard, for all
                           this to fought, you ought to be reading your bible,
                           saying your prayers, going to church and getting in
                           touch with the boss ... why I laughed when they were
                           saying that Terry Waite would need counselling, I
                           bet that Terry Waite was praying his head off and
                           he'd memorised masses of the bible which he would be
                           reciting to himself probably set himself two o'clock
                           every afternoon, I remember what I can, book of
                           [...] you know ... I don't suppose he'd needed any
                           counselling, he'd probably do better counselling
                           other people.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9161] That's right, yeah, cos I mean he's, he's
                           certainly sort of, even though he's been sort of
                           prisoner, I mean, he's seen what's going on and, and
                           he's had what five years of it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [9162] Yes, yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9163] and he's sort of life sort of gone.
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [9164] [...] .
Brenda (PS04U)             [9165] Oh thank you ... This is delicious.

Brenda (PS04U)             [9168] Really have some more ...
Jean (PS04Y)               [9169] In East Anglia, people either in, eh, on
                           their pub lunches there, how they throw themselves
                           onto that, all on too treacle pudding.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9170] Yeah, but, oh, eh, it a bit heavy though in
                           it?, sometimes it

Brenda (PS04U)             [9184] No, I meant women buy them to wear.

Brenda (PS04U)             [9186] Women [...] , erm from men's departments, cos
                           they just, like she said they, I don't know why, but
                           they just seemed to sort of
Jean (PS04Y)               [9187] Well, men, the fabrics of men's [...] usually
                           better, stronger
Brenda (PS04U)             [9188] mm.
Jean (PS04Y)               [9189] because men feel cold more, I mean they can
                           wear, if you think about it they were suits in the
                           middle of summer where were into sleeveless [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [9190] Yeah .

Jean (PS04Y)               [9194] it's done, done us well enough, but I do
                           prefer a Bernie.

Brenda (PS04U)             [9237] No.
Jean (PS04Y)               [9238] There aren't any people where they are.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9239] Aren't there?
Jean (PS04Y)               [9240] Well, there are next door neighbours, who I
                           think are very nice, but I don't think that Jackie
                           and Ned got a lot in common with them ... that's,tha
                           that's one house that adjoins them and then a little
                           further on, its a lane, its about as wide as this
                           Brenda.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9241] Oh, well why'd they moved?
                           [9242] What, what area is it?
Jean (PS04Y)               [9243] Its called Fen, Fen Lane
Brenda (PS04U)             [9244] [...] .

                           [...] .
Brenda (PS04U)             [9246] And how far is it from you?
Jean (PS04Y)               [9247] About erm, between ten and fifteen minutes
                           drive I suppose, ten minutes perhaps.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9248] Oh it's not far
Jean (PS04Y)               [9249] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9250] does she still do her kitchen job?
Jean (PS04Y)               [9251] Yes, and she phoned me and she said I feel as
                           though I dropped out of the bottom of the world she
                           said, you know, I just don't see anybody, I said
                           well of course you were working on Mondays, you see
                           she used to have Mondays to herself and I would
                           often go round on a Monday afternoon and, we, we
                           could talk, but that's gone and I said I can't run
                           in at half past five when you get home from school
                           and chat to you because Ned will be coming home at
                           six and I don't want to be there all that often when
                           he's there ... erm ... its ... you know, its just
                           happened and I also thought to myself and I'm
                           probably going to move a lot further away then Fen
                           Lane.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9252] But she doesn't, I mean she doesn't bother
                           that much now does she?
Jean (PS04Y)               [9253] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [9254] I mean I think it counts that she's not
Jean (PS04Y)               [9255] To tell you the truth Brenda, I'm very sorry
                           for her because I think that she and Ned have made a
                           ... really a quite ferocious mess of their life,
                           they've never intended to be slaving away to be
                           doing kitchen fitting, he wanted to do wood
                           sculpture that was he's idea in
Brenda (PS04U)             [9256] And slow down a bit you [...] was
Jean (PS04Y)               [9257] yes, yes , he's on the gallop and looks very
                           old and worn
Brenda (PS04U)             [9258] Does he?

               up and chatting to you a bit more, cos we haven't chatted enough
               have we?
Brenda (PS04U) [9278] No, well we've got the bulk, we were only going to be in
               Woking an hour.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9279] Yes, we haven't chatted enough [laugh] .

Jean (PS04Y)   [9281] [laugh] , oh.
Brenda (PS04U) [9282] You really feel, I mean with really sort of put into it
               and really done well haven't we?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9283] Oh, I couldn't have done a quarter of it.
Brenda (PS04U) [9284] And I get on less than two people
Jean (PS04Y)   [9285] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [9286] and that's it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9287] I think I've done a quarter of it
Brenda (PS04U) [9288] I
Jean (PS04Y)   [9289] I'd dithered, and I'd got tired and I'd gone off and been
               [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [9290] Think oh well I come back I can't [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [9291] That's right do it again, oh I have another go at it.
               [9292] Oh I could have spent the whole week, I just, I just, I
               could of spent five afternoons in Ipswich, would of done or
               Norwich
Brenda (PS04U) [9293] Mm, I think I would of done cos I, I work at the, cos a
               couple of weeks ago I thought I'd go, I'll make an effort, I
               thought
Jean (PS04Y)   [9294] I think it makes a very big difference knowing that the
               [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [9295] Yeah [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9296] [...] without having to think too hard.
Brenda (PS04U) [9297] and you still you make sure you, I mean, you know, all,
               that what I've spent
Jean (PS04Y)   [9298] Oh it was well [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [9299] It's got everybody.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9300] Yeah, its within your budget and you've done well, I went
               over budget, but then I expected I would, because for one thing
               I was buying for more.
Brenda (PS04U) [9301] Yeah, cos you had, you, I mean none of us realised you
               had thirty to odd to buy
Jean (PS04Y)   [9302] No .
Brenda (PS04U) [9303] I don't think you really realised really did you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9304] I didn't, but I remember when you said that, that last
               year when I counted up
Brenda (PS04U) [9305] Its fifty odd , I think fifty three
Jean (PS04Y)   [9306] With the er , erm, was it [...] years before that I've
               had something like forty or thirty five
Brenda (PS04U) [9307] Yep
Jean (PS04Y)   [9308] in, what you might call quite years ...
Brenda (PS04U) [9309] But those, some of those calendars in Smith with two
               pounds off were lovely
Jean (PS04Y)   [9310] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9311] and the ones we saw at Marks and all that, were nothing
               were they?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9312] Well it pays to tramp around ... you see the problem with
               Jackie and Len has always been that they cannot believe that you
               can get things in a place like W H Smith that will, that will do
               very nicely as a Christmas present, they tend to go
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9313] always to the top of the
Brenda (PS04U) [9314] Well it doesn't pay just, [...] queue up doing anything
Jean (PS04Y)   [9315] You know, they, they [...] yes, yes ... they go to the
               Madechie shops and Athena or whatever and there looking at the
               best, and you can't afford it [...] ... See Maryann and Richard
               are given up on erm buying Christmas presents because she says
               ... your buying things for people they don't really want,
               everybody [...] , therefore I think tokeny things are the best,
               and that's what I've bought this year.
Brenda (PS04U) [9316] And is that what you
Jean (PS04Y)   [9317] Tokeny things
Brenda (PS04U) [9318] is that what she's doing?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9319] there buying disposable presents, like giving theatre
               vouchers and erm I don't know what else, but she said
               disposable's things that people can have some fun with
Brenda (PS04U) [9320] Good idea isn't it ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9321] Mm ... and what I'm giving is just something nice in the
               spirit of Christmas, but it hasn't broken my bank or my back ...

Brenda (PS04U) [9322] Thing is the [...] how these people go week after week
               after week looking ... for a bargain, I mean,Christm , I mean we
               picked up some bargains today, but how you can go week, I mean
               its ok, yes, why your [...] but when your Christmas shopping you
               can't [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9323] No , no you can't
Brenda (PS04U) [9324] Because its just so, I mean that C &amp; A it was the
               same as the [...] it was
Jean (PS04Y)   [9325] Mm, mm, mm
Brenda (PS04U) [9326] it so claustrophobic
Jean (PS04Y)   [9327] yeah ...
Brenda (PS04U) [9328] look at this traffic coming in now [...] ... I think the
               way we did it, we marked down the three shops we wanted to do
Jean (PS04Y)   [9329] Mm
Brenda (PS04U) [9330] and you make, we just do those three shops
Jean (PS04Y)   [9331] Yes , yes ... I don't think that on our next buy, what
               with the [...] next year I would be a bit better off in the
               sense that I should have sold my house, bought something cheaper
               and have some capital invested so I have a little extra monthly
               income, I should be living in somewhere that's cheaper to run
Brenda (PS04U) [9332] You don't know, you might end up with this [...] chap
               your with.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9333] Oh I wouldn't marry him Bre , I wouldn't marry anybody
               Brenda
Brenda (PS04U) [9334] No, but you might live with him ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [9335] Don't know
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9336] don't know ... don't know
Brenda (PS04U) [9337] and then yes you can buy a smaller house even more so
               then.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9338] Well I would I, I mean I kept to keep my own [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [9339] But
Jean (PS04Y)   [9340] whatever your , your [...] in it, and look after it, yes,
               erm ... well I don't think I'll ever again buy expensive
               Christmas presents in the way that I did in the past.
Brenda (PS04U) [9341] No.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9342] Spending forty and fifty pounds ahead on
Brenda (PS04U) [9343] [...] don't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9344] Mm, yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [9345] Like your just tracksuits and
Jean (PS04Y)   [9346] Yes , no I can't erm, I can't think of myself as doing
               that again.
Brenda (PS04U) [9347] I agree, its, its like those [...] their lovely little
               things, don't think of buying, it's not very fair cos I mean,Mar
               , I mean I'd be over the moon if someone bought me one of those
               bags.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9348] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [9349] You know, but, people don't, they think oh know there
               only one twenty five and they can't buy someone that
Jean (PS04Y)   [9350] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9351] cos its not wro not the issue of it is it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9352] No , no it isn't ...

               them the [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9358] Oh yes.

Jean (PS04Y)   [9360] Oh no
Brenda (PS04U) [9361] then the bow
Jean (PS04Y)   [9362] the time consuming, getting it all in.
Brenda (PS04U) [9363] I think all I would do is just to wrap it up bow, yeah,
               buy some of that cheap [...] stuff
Jean (PS04Y)   [9364] Yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [9365] and curl it
Jean (PS04Y)   [9366] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9367] display it on the top [...] ... she saved on wrapping
               papers and the bows ... want to get some petrol, have to get
               some ... get some [...] ... what did you ask in Guilford to
               what, why you asked for B H S about?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9368] [...] , erm do you think [...] erm ...
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9369] It'll come to me ...
Brenda (PS04U) [9370] I don't know how many of those tops you've got on?
               [9371] Green one
Jean (PS04Y)   [9372] I've only got this one, I had a cream one and it got
               wrecked by going, I think Neil put it in the wash with one of
               his black tee shirts, and
Brenda (PS04U) [9373] Did
Jean (PS04Y)   [9374] it came out all purple bluey
Brenda (PS04U) [9375] Its really [...] top.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9376] it is, its very soft and easy to wear and.
Brenda (PS04U) [9377] Now, erm, should buy a couple more of them if you see
               them.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9378] Well I don't know, erm,
Brenda (PS04U) [9379] They warm?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9380] they are warm, er, but its colour, I don't know whether I
               ... perhaps I, if I saw cream again this year I might buy it,
               but erm, I'm not sure that I want erm there's this deep red,
               because I've, I've bought a red one in a different style, same
               sort of fabric, its very [...] do you remember?, when I bought
               that black and white checked skirt I bought a red
Brenda (PS04U) [9381] Oh yeah [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9382] blouse
Brenda (PS04U) [9383] yes, but the sleeve, the sleeve [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9384] [...] trying to get it together and I would of got it
               together if I [...] [...] for being nice [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [9385] Of course he does
Jean (PS04Y)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9386] Doesn't listen to a word I say, like, the women's no good
               [laugh] ... cos I told [...] some things about [...] which would
               really made yet more of his hair fall of the top of his bald
               head, I said [...] I said look, a working women needs a working
               man to help support herself and her children, I said, er no,
               nobody is going to be able these days, a woman not going to be
               able to support herself on twenty hours a week, which is what
               Karen does, putting out bread in the Asda.
Brenda (PS04U) [9387] Is she the original one then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9388] She's the original one
Brenda (PS04U) [9389] She's not the one that was coming round with the baby?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9390] no, it was Michelle that was coming round with the baby
Brenda (PS04U) [9391] right
Jean (PS04Y)   [9392] and I found two pairs of Michelle's knickers after that,
               I didn't know what [...] [laugh] , now I don't know how they
               manage this year [laugh] because, she was coming round in the
               day with little Donna with her and I was around, there you are,
               you see, these, they, they will love and find a way, anyway,
               erm, I said dear look, a woman needs a man to support her I said
               ... mark my words when the chap that she's got at the moment is
               taken her out to disco's and things, she'll find that he doesn't
               really want to kick in and help to support her.
               [9393] I said she, she might well come back to you I said she's
               tried to keep you on a string ... just in case she didn't land
               the next dish ... he looked horrified, you know, as far as he's
               concerned its all love and glamour.
Brenda (PS04U) [9394] How come she took him back then, they didn't want [...] ?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9395] Well I think that she was trying to keep him dangling so
               that she had somebody to fall back on if she didn't land another
               man.
Brenda (PS04U) [9396] He wasn't
Jean (PS04Y)   [9397] Why she's landed
Brenda (PS04U) [9398] was she playing around with another man [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9399] She is now , she is now yes, she's now carrying on.
Brenda (PS04U) [9400] What did he do?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9401] Erm his sleeping [...] she's told him that she's got this
               other man
Brenda (PS04U) [9402] Cos I can remember him saying before he used to drive
               round to spy
Jean (PS04Y)   [9403] Yes, well there is another man and she's told Paul
               frankly she's lapping up the attention, he's taking her out for
               meals and their having a good time together you know, why its
               great, but as soon as he's paid for, for the goods and got, got
               the goods, the chaps going to go off looking for another.
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Jean (PS04Y)   [9404] [...] yes, he doesn't want to stay with her, but I've
               told Paul that if he goes back to Karen and [...] take some of
               his things out, then he takes all of his things out and himself
               and he never comes back
Brenda (PS04U) [9405] Just er, he can't keep on
Jean (PS04Y)   [9406] I've had this twice and each time its been, its been
               other people, because his got a lot of goods [...] people's
               belongings out of one cupboard into another and the second time
               round there's been purgatory because he brought Karen's house,
               her hoover and the saucepans and everything that was his,
               everything that belonged to him ... but he said that before, I
               said why was Michelle able to jumped in between him and Karen,
               he said well Karen had been getting moody, and he said Karen was
               getting bored, Paul is boring, she's told Paul that his boring
               ... [...] boring.
Brenda (PS04U) [9407] No, cos I could imagine Paul sort of being quite a homely
               chap
Jean (PS04Y)   [9408] He is.
Brenda (PS04U) [9409] if he gets the right sort of
Jean (PS04Y)   [9410] he is
Brenda (PS04U) [9411] if someone that could put up with his sort of quite
               reservation
Jean (PS04Y)   [9412] yes
Brenda (PS04U) [9413] cos he likes to chat
Jean (PS04Y)   [9414] yeah
Brenda (PS04U) [9415] and
Jean (PS04Y)   [9416] yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [9417] but I mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [9418] He's a pleasant enough chap
Brenda (PS04U) [9419] he is, that's it
Jean (PS04Y)   [9420] yes, but he is not erm a playboy, he's not going to spend
               money on ... like Pete was forever buying Pam cheap jewellery
               from Ratners and rubbish from that nature.
Brenda (PS04U) [9421] Did he ever get back with her?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9422] Well, she tells me that she is going to throw Shaun out
               because Shaun is boring, er, Don put her, Shaun she has no
               respect for she says because he hasn't got a job, he won't get a
               job, he won't work, and she said to Lee what did I think of the
               idea of taking Pete back, once they were properly divorced take
               Pete back just as a lover and I said that sounds to me to be a
               very good idea, I said then your not at his mercy because
               anybody who's at Pete's mercy will suffer, his got a very nasty
               streak, his got a nasty snide way of putting things.
Brenda (PS04U) [9423] Has he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9424] Oh yes, nasty.
Brenda (PS04U) [9425] But his, he, is he, he's quite fond of her isn't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9426] Oh he adores her, oh yes he wants her back, and I said,
               she said, I, you see, I know him, I said there's a lot to be
               said for a chap that you know inside , know his ways and know
               how to cope with them, but I said never ever put yourself at his
               mercy, I'm marrying him, and the house will be hers, you see,
               when there properly divorced it'll be in her name so if he
               starts coming the old soldier, she can bung him out.
Brenda (PS04U) [9427] Did she bail herself out in the end with over her money
               situation?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9428] Well I, I went guarantor for that.
Brenda (PS04U) [9429] Oh you hate, did you have to pay the money, cos you had
Jean (PS04Y)   [9430] No, no she managed, I told her on pain of death not to
               tell Pete that I was backing
Brenda (PS04U) [9431] Mm
Jean (PS04Y)   [9432] erm cos otherwise he would of sat back and said oh Jean
               can pay that.
Brenda (PS04U) [9433] that's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9434] But she knew that in the last resort if he did [...] I
               would do it, but he's, he's paid off now ... as soon as he'd
               paid off he went on the dole again ...
Brenda (PS04U) [9435] I don't think quite

               you meet him?
Brenda (PS04U) [9437] No, we never met him.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9438] Oh ... plausible rogue.
Brenda (PS04U) [9439] My god, look at the queue to get in the car park.

Jean (PS04Y)   [9447] You might yet.
Brenda (PS04U) [9448] But you said he was sort of gypsyfied.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9449] Oh yes.

Brenda (PS04U) [9468] Book that's all for Jackie.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9469] If I see it.

Brenda (PS04U) [9472] I don't know though, I mean ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [9473] I'd, actually I don't think I'd get a book for Jackie

               for her English teaching and drama

Jean (PS04Y)   [9524] Yeah.
*** 60 (Tape 015602) ***
Jean (PS04Y)   [9525] Well, the thing I mainly notice when last week when Paul
               was home, not last week, the week before last I had Paul solidly
               at home, he moved himself entirely in lock, stock and barrel at
               the weekend, he was then with me waiting for his job ... and he
               went out every day and did little bit's of shopping for me, got
               him from under my feet, saved me money, cos I was only buying
               what I absolutely needed, and the amount of time that I had, I
               mean I was able to go out for the whole day with Peggy on
               Wednesday, I was able to get food prepared and, admittedly I
               didn't manage to get as much done as I thought I was going to
               do, but then I think that's with most people in life,
Brenda (PS04U) [9526] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9527] but, not to have to drag out in the car to the solar and
               buy food in the supermarkets
Brenda (PS04U) [9528] Oh it's wonderful .
Jean (PS04Y)   [9529] Oh it was glorious ... I made a note to myself actually,
               that I'm only going to go out once a week for a proper shop,
               from a list, in the solar and the rest of the time I'm going to
               go to the quite expensive little Robber's Roe, round the corner
               from me.
Brenda (PS04U) [9530] Mm, I haven't been shopping this weekend.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9531] You can't.
Brenda (PS04U) [9532] We go one, you know, if I [...] I just make do with what
               we've got.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9533] Well yes, I do a lot of that, mm, yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [9534] I'm booked tomorrow because I'm going to Blackbush at
               seven o'clock in the morning
Jean (PS04Y)   [9535] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9536] Oh my god, there's remembering things, erm ... I'm hoping
               to [...] , ok I don't, I don't want to go you know it's too
               early
Jean (PS04Y)   [9537] Mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9538] cos I'm going as a favour to give her a lift really.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9539] Yeah, yeah ... I hate people who park on the ramp and
               causes to put yourself to a hill start, they are a [...] ...
Brenda (PS04U) [9540] Joy of a, joy of a
Jean (PS04Y)   [9541] The automatic, yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [9542] automatic, yes.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9543] Yes.
               [9544] Neil of course is doing the male macho bit, oh yes it's,
               all very nice driving the automatic, but I like gears really,
               yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [9545] I like the automatic when it's a, your on hill's like
               this.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9546] Oh yes.
               [9547] Gerry was taught to drive in nineteen forty six in the
               States, where they, they gone, they'd gone over to total
               automatic, and he despised manual gears, thought they were a
               ridiculous waste of time and effort, said you want to
               concentrate on the, on the road, not on the car, but then you
               see Gerry improved himself, he was a ...
Brenda (PS04U) [9548] Look at the queue to get in there now.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9549] yeah, he was a Squadron Leader he was [...] Squadron
               Leader, being engaged in combat he done the lot, he didn't need
               to prove that he was male.
               [9550] [...] with our parking and [...] aren't we?
Brenda (PS04U) [9551] Trouble with [...] .
               [9552] Yeah.
               [9553] I've gotta, I think people are so un-organised with
               Christmas, you've got to be organised, you've got to say like,
               you know, I'm only going to those shops, you know, if like like
               now, say [...] so we went in Boots
Jean (PS04Y)   [9554] Like [...] , yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [9555] for ten minutes.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9556] Yeah, erm, also, erm,
Brenda (PS04U) [9557] But I think we could of gone down to British Home Stores,
               but we both probably would have spent more, than,
Jean (PS04Y)   [9558] Oh, but we did get everything .
Brenda (PS04U) [9559] But we got , we got what was on our list.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9560] Got something for everybody now.
Brenda (PS04U) [9561] And that's it, you've done your bit.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9562] And once you've done that, you've got spare time and
               spare money you can buy extra, but come, come down to it Brenda,
               once the Christmas Day is over
Brenda (PS04U) [9563] That's it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9564] does anybody remember particularly what they were given,
               or make a great deal about it, of a meal of it, unless you've
               given them something absolutely outstanding like a fur coat, I
               remember the fur coat I was given in
Brenda (PS04U) [9565] Or a car .
Jean (PS04Y)   [9566] Well exactly.
Brenda (PS04U) [9567] That's it.

Brenda (PS04U) [9570] Young [...] pulled right the way across and the traffic
               lights were obviously red.

Brenda (PS04U) [9586] Marvellous, it's [...]

               got some cheap fabrics on in lace or, or fine [...] material,
               and you know I very much now regret not getting some, because I
               want to dress up, remember I had a, a lace cover, a fitted lace
               cover on my kitchen [...] table

Jean (PS04Y)   [9597] Yes, oh.
Brenda (PS04U) [9598] [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [9599] That's why I'm so thankful that I'm on the reading and
               that I like sewing, I like walking and I've made some very nice
               friends within easy walking distance, I can go out and have a
               coffee with them, because I, while I'm recovering from the
               agony's of from the finance

Jean (PS04Y)   [9601] I can do all those nice things in Jan, Feb and March, and

Jean (PS04Y)   [9801] she was doing so well in the church and she died of
               cancer.

               said, well were pretty certain that your clear but I'm afraid

               they said that, it hit her again and she died.
Brenda (PS04U) [9803] Oh god, it's awful in it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9804] Mm, mm, it is.
Brenda (PS04U) [9805] And is it Marg the one who had the friend in America, or

Brenda (PS04U) [9817] Does she come up to you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9818] Yes, she comes up by train.
Brenda (PS04U) [9819] Has she never wanted to learn to drive then?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9820] No ...
Brenda (PS04U) [9821] I can't understand women that haven't learnt to drive,
               can you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9822] [yawning] No, I can't, I really can't [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [9823] Because there's always been an opport , I mean even if
               your sort of poor, there's always the opportunity, I mean I
               learnt to drive and then the driving instructor erm, lived next
               door to my mother saying, it, at the time it should of been
               three pound and erm, he let us have it for two pound
Jean (PS04Y)   [9824] Mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9825] I mean that was what, twenty one I was, so, thirteen
               years ago
Jean (PS04Y)   [9826] Mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9827] erm, and it's about what twelve pound now, eleven pound?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9828] Er I paid thirteen pounds, ninety.
Brenda (PS04U) [9829] Yeah, god.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9830] You might well say.
Brenda (PS04U) [9831] How many years, I mean, that's in thirteen, that's a
               pound a year, it's gone up.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9832] Mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9833] Good god it's a lot of money in it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9834] It is.
Brenda (PS04U) [9835] But even the test is dear isn't it now on the actual day.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9836] Seventeen I think it is, seventeen, I'm not sure.
Brenda (PS04U) [9837] I thought it was more than that.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9838] Maybe, maybe more, perhaps it's seventeen with the
               provisional licence.
               [9839] But you may reckon that anything to do with
Brenda (PS04U) [9840] But that was a pound .
Jean (PS04Y)   [9841] I know.
Brenda (PS04U) [9842] [laugh] , but wasn't it free when you had it?
               [9843] Was it
Jean (PS04Y)   [9844] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [9845] No, it wasn't, you had to pay.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9846] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [9847] I know with mine it was a pound and, I renewed mine for
               two years, well three years I think I never drove, I just wanted
               to have a provisional, but now, I think like if someone said it
               was fifteen or seventeen
Jean (PS04Y)   [9848] Mm, mm, mm , yes I think it's seventeen.
Brenda (PS04U) [9849] I don't know if that's, what's that to stop encouraging
               the children just to buy it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9850] No, it's the general audacity of the tax system, which
               was to, to ripe money of us so that it can give us [...] we can
               spend our money on rubbishing layabouts.
Brenda (PS04U) [9851] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9852] I mean, deserving cases like Neil who as he says only
               want to be taught, get next to nothing, but it seems to me that
               people like your sister Jane and Trevor get given the earth.
Brenda (PS04U) [9853] Well it, well something's wrong somewhere isn't it?
Jean (PS04Y)   [9854] I think so.
Brenda (PS04U) [9855] And then
Jean (PS04Y)   [9856] They shall never know what.
Brenda (PS04U) [9857] There's the systems ... oh I, I told you didn't I Jane
               got eh reported.
Jean (PS04Y)   [9858] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [9859] Cos erm, apparently erm Trevor was working for Bettaware
               for Avon and they had the Social Services round to say that I
               hear that your working and they do toy parties ... and they said
               no, I mean there not making a living out of it, it's was just
Jean (PS04Y)   [9860] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [9861] you know [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [9862] The odd few pounds yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [9863] And erm they said well you've got to come off it, you
               know, were not going to do you this time, but you've got to come
               straight, stop doing it all, erm, cos you've been reported and
               your on the Social Security.
*** 67 (Tape 015609) ***

               mean Tesco's when we went last night it was packed, no you
               probably didn't see it
Jean (PS04Y)   [10120] No, I didn't.
Brenda (PS04U) [10121] but it was packed ...
Jean (PS04Y)   [10122] Is that because of the food price war?
               [10123] Are they still doing that, are they still trying to keep
               there prices down?
Dave (PS04V)   [10124] They say they are Jean [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [10125] Oh I dunno, they are [...] .

Brenda (PS04U) [10129] Mm, mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [10130] and then, that week, he sell's ten pence a can, then the
               following week he still bought it ten pence, following week it
               goes up to eighteen pence, but he's still selling what [...] ,
               so I don't think it, I think [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [10131] But I still think Tesco's is the cheapest supermarket, I
               do, Waitrose is way over the top.

Brenda (PS04U) [10149] That is, it is so wrong.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10150] Yeah, I mean it's alright for people like my son John,
               who's got a [...] good salary.
Brenda (PS04U) [10151] I was gonna say he's on about thirty thousands ain't he?
Jean (PS04Y)   [10152] Oh it must be probably more than that .
Brenda (PS04U) [10153] Probably more than that , but that, he wouldn't mind if
               he had to do it.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10154] Well he does, he goes in on Saturdays very often, he
               goes in on Sundays very often, you know, goes up to have a look
               at a site or goes into the office to look over something in
               peace without the phone ringing all that's sort of thing, he
               puts in a lot of time that's not strictly accounted for, Gerry
               did, I did as a teacher, but then we were well paid.
Dave (PS04V)   [10155] People who are on six and a half thousand a year.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10156] Mm, it [...] .
Dave (PS04V)   [10157] It, it, it's [...] in the office.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10158] Roll on the common market day when the social dimension
               will stop that, it'll stop it in it's tracks, sheer exploitation
               that is.
Dave (PS04V)   [10159] [...] about the, what is, what [...] the, the ladies, I
               told you, women who work nights at
Brenda (PS04U) [10160] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [10161] Tesco's, they sent a letter out to them, and er, cos
               there open over Christmas period, er I think some of the stores
               [...] and the letter says we all get two days off, cos [...] ,
               and then like, they, they won't Christmas day [...] , twelve
               o'clock new, Christmas Eve and twelve o'clock new Christmas Day,
               they [...] twelve o'clock [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [10162] Disgusting.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10163] Disgraceful.
Dave (PS04V)   [10164] Otherwise they said [...] , I mean even with, they gotta
               do it .
Brenda (PS04U) [10165] if they don't turn up they don't get paid for the
               Christmas and Boxing Day.
Dave (PS04V)   [10166] Well [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [10167] Sacked.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10168] Mm, mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [10169] I mean most of them are only there cos there finding it
               hard with the mortgage.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10170] Quite, quite.
Dave (PS04V)   [10171] Got them over, they, they said, they said they know
               they've got them over a barrel.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10172] Mm, mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [10173] They, Tesco's is one of [...] a lot of the firms, but
               you said there dreadful the way they treat their staff .
Dave (PS04V)   [10174] Yeah , well Tesco's, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, all the
               same.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10175] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [10176] When, when you walk in the front of the shop, it all
               look's nice, got out the back.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10177] Mm, mm ...
Brenda (PS04U) [10178] But Neil he was gonna go down to Tesco's but he is,
               Ipswich, can't get down here, [...] so he can't sort of travel
               ... and you know what the hassle of having to take him and pick
               him up.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10179] Can't, I can't do it.
               [10180] When he was first with me I could belt up about seven in
               the morning, but, recently I've noticed that I feel unwell if I
               get up and rush out .
Brenda (PS04U) [10181] [yawning] Yeah, but he could probably do a two till ten
               shift, but the two would be alright [] , but you wouldn't want
               to go out ten o'clock at night and pick him up.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10182] But, I, physically I can't do it, I, I've aged up in the
               last few years.
Brenda (PS04U) [10183] Mm.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10184] My, my years have caught up with me you know.
               [10185] It's all very well keeping mentally flexible and all the
               rest of the who-har, but if you, er, my, my mother stopped and
               said to her many years ago, she said, you don't look your age,
               you don't act your age, you don't sound your age, you don't
               think your age, but you are your age, and this is absolutely
               true, as you grow older, nothing will stop the fact that your
               arteries get a little harder, so that, you know, that you get
               raised blood pressure quite easily if your agitated and you are,
               for some reason you, you have to puff a lot more, I was reading
               about this just recently, and these are changes that take place
               whatever you do, you can exercise, and you can take vitamins and
               you can keep your weight down, but you age.
Brenda (PS04U) [10186] Age, I'll fight it [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10187] Well you can fight it, I do, but you don't win all hands
               down [laugh] .
Dave (PS04V)   [10188] Cos you see I've act [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10189] Yes, yes, but erm, you know, I have had to say to the
               chaps, one of them came in and he said he'd been spoiled down at
               the cedar [...] and I said oh well, I, I've been cooking a
               breakfast for Neil of course by the operation of sods law, Neil
               suddenly goes off the idea of having breakfast, so I find myself
               cooking breakfast for this other lump, who is as idol and
               selfish as anybody ever met in all the born days, and I said to
               him just recently, I said, I, I can't get up and do breakfast's
               in the morning any more, well he says he come's down and does
               he's own, [laugh] you see they can when they feel that they want
               too.
Dave (PS04V)   [10190] Yeah, especially when it's cold and dark you don't want
               it, you can have an extra half hour in bed, [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10191] Well, it's, it's simple that if I got up at half past
               six, and took him up a cup of tea at quarter too seven, and when
               he was around at seven o'clock, I was grilling bacon and I was
               frying eggs, and I hope, I don't know whether perhaps it's my
               cold, but, I, I just used to feel terribly unwell after he'd
               gone, for about two hours and my legs were so wobbly, I was
               sitting down on the sofa, I may go back yet to cooking him
               breakfast if I feel like it, but, the, I mean if I can say to
               these chaps that, there are times when I don't feel like doing
               things, well, I reckon Dave that they are so glad to be in that
               house with the central heating, with the twenty four hour er, er
               a day water, and the comfort, there not going to argue.
Dave (PS04V)   [10192] Yeah, that's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10193] Brenda
Brenda (PS04U) [10194] Yeah.

Brenda (PS04U)             [10243] on a
Jean (PS04Y)               [10244] having ,
Brenda (PS04U)             [10245] Saturday.
Jean (PS04Y)               [10246] having been through that experience with
                           Helen, he'll be a lot more weary.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10247] Yeah cos he realise I mean, he often says oh
                           well, you know, she made me turn against my family
                           and be horrible and he says I haven't had time, he
                           says I realise how wrong I was.
Jean (PS04Y)               [10248] Neil, Neil now says, that when he meets a
                           girl, he, he waits to see if she's got any
                           characteristics in common with the dreadful Vicky ,
                           the girl that he eventually fetch her much deserved
                           slosh on the chops and was pulled into Ipswich
                           Magistrates Court, you know, oh I shouldn't laugh,
                           but erm, he says he looks for those characteristics,
                           and the moment he sees that the girl is going to be
                           this sort of neurotic, excitable, hysterical
                           creature he walks away.

               where he and the other's were all working away playing the
               Mozart Symphony or two.

Brenda (PS04U) [10337] She lives sort of on a knife edge doesn't she?
Jean (PS04Y)   [10338] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [10339] But they sort of, I mean I say, they love the kids and
               they love, you know, doing anything with them, but, they won't,
               and Dave said why don't you take, oh I'd love to do golf, and
               Dave says well bloody well do it, what's stopping you?
Jean (PS04Y)   [10340] That's right.
Brenda (PS04U) [10341] Oh and we'd love to do swimming, erm, because we'd done
               as a surprise for Carla for Christmas cos I mean we said the

               Christmas presents, going swimming ten till twelve, perhaps go

Brenda (PS04U) [10359] Brian wouldn't come, did last year, I mean I don't know
               if the kids will come this year but I'll ask Kim, because the
               single fact it breaks up the conversation a bit, doesn't it, I
               mean
Jean (PS04Y)   [10360] Oh it helps, yes, yes.
Brenda (PS04U) [10361] You know, but that is what Dave said, there highlight is
               every, like can we come over at six o'clock tomorrow.

               off, he, he would rather, I mean he wouldn't say no, it's not,
               no

Brenda (PS04U) [10365] I mean the thing, they should know, I mean like Dave
               said every couple of weeks, but ev
Dave (PS04V)   [10366] It's nice to see, it's like Christmas [...] , when our
               kids are older we'll see [...] pop in and visit them, but we
               won't ever year rang.
Brenda (PS04U) [10367] We've got to come to you, like you do .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10368] Yeah, yeah .
Dave (PS04V)   [10369] You know, like, [...] cos it's, [...] used to say now, I
               mean I'd like to, I would like to go away at Christmas
Jean (PS04Y)   [10370] Yes of course.
Dave (PS04V)   [10371] [...] work all year and if you can afford it, can't have
               a holiday in the year, say well come on kids your a bit older
               now
Jean (PS04Y)   [10372] Mm.

               mum, [...] it's nice to have your family around you [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10374] You fill obliged.
Brenda (PS04U) [10375] You are obliged.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10376] Yeah, yeah, I know, well my daughter in law, was
               practically down on the phone kissing me last year when I said
               look Myrie, wouldn't you like it this year if I didn't come to
               you, you know, she's done Christmas's for me, year in year out
               [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [10377] [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10378] she said, John and I would love to have a Christmas on
               our own, I think it
Brenda (PS04U) [10379] [...] .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10380] I think it effect they, I think they in fact invited
               there
Brenda (PS04U) [10381] Their friends.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10382] her parents, but they, they don't have their friends, in
               fact I'm not sure that they did very much at all, I think that
               Myrie meant it when she said that what they wanted was the most
               peaceful sort of Christmas that you could possibly imagine, with
               no big teas, big meals or anything
Dave (PS04V)   [10383] Or entertaining.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10384] Exactly wondering about what to eat .
Brenda (PS04U) [10385] [...] , six days a week, I mean it's like this year I
               mean he's going to be working, I'm working as well right up to
               Christmas Eve, so are you, his gonna have the Christmas Day and
               they want him back at work on the Boxing Night.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10386] Yes, quite.
Brenda (PS04U) [10387] See he get's a day and a half off, I mean it's like we,
               I mean well this is why Dave said, he said do you fancy he said
*** 71 (Tape 015701) ***
Jean (PS04Y)   [10388] Said John, well, we've got other ideas we'd like you to
               come to us for Christmas, so I thought, as I said to Brenda, you
               don't turn down an invitation from your own children [laugh]
Dave (PS04V)   [10389] That's right, yeah.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10390] But, actually I was [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [10391] You don't go every year .
Jean (PS04Y)   [10392] I certainly am not.
               [10393] I was looking forward actually to looking after Neil
Brenda (PS04U) [10394] It was one year she could of done without the invitation
               though isn't it?, if she, if she wanted her other friends and
               Neil.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10395] Definitely , yes, and you, you and Dave could have come
               up and er Carla, perhaps not Lee , but, you know, he may have
               wanted to go off somewhere else, erm, we could all have bunked
               down on what spare space there was and I was going to do a very
               primitive almost medieval, middle ages sort of Christmas
Brenda (PS04U) [10396] Well that's what we said, but , right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10397] I wasn't going to rush around buying horribly expensive
               things like smoke salmon that I couldn't afford, I was going to
               do a big family feast and I was going to get in a few games like
               the monopoly or [laughing] lotto or you know [] , I just, I
               haven't worked it out but I thought oh what fun
Brenda (PS04U) [10398] That's right.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10399] and then, invited to be a good, to be a good mum and a
               good [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [10400] No, I mean, that's what it's all about, I mean the fact
               is
Jean (PS04Y)   [10401] I shall enjoy it and I, I very touched that they [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [10402] Well one year it used to be that she come to us at
               dinner time
Jean (PS04Y)   [10403] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [10404] and then go to Lenny's in, in the evening.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10405] Mm, mm
Brenda (PS04U) [10406] You know
Jean (PS04Y)   [10407] yeah, yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [10408] and I mean it used to be the fact, oh god well we've got
               to sort of have dinner at twelve o'clock, we've got to be round
               there by four.
Jean (PS04Y)   [10409] Well do you know, when I met, I, I'm meeting old chaps
               through this very excellent marriage agency, I've never expected
               any thing like it, they are marvellous, and the sent me a nice
               old lad, but I knew I was onto a looser when he said, of course
               I go to my daughter-in-law every Saturday for lunch, she
               absolutely insists because she says, she wants to make sure that
               I'm eating properly, now this is a very healthy old man with a

Brenda (PS04U)             [10650] Might get your shoes on Wednesday. ...
Dave (PS04V)               [10651] But make sure he's got his trousers on!
Brenda (PS04U)             [10652] Why does he have to have his trousers on?
Dave (PS04V)               [10653] Well he has to put the suit on, try it on in
                           the shop, to make sure it, wear his shoes there ...
                           cos even, the shoes he's got might be alright with
                           it.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10654] But they they've got holes in.
                           [10655] He needs new school shoes.
Dave (PS04V)               [10656] Yes but if they ... are alright you know the
                           type of shoes you want. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [10657] All he's gonna wear are shoes that day.
Dave (PS04V)               [10658] Er?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10659] Are they, are they quite similar to his ...
                           school trousers?
Lee (PS04W)                [10660] Oh yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10661] The cut?
Lee (PS04W)                [10662] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10663] Cos they look, be okay with those shoes.
Dave (PS04V)               [10664] Yeah but the length.
                           [10665] It's the length you, the trousers'll be
                           alright.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10666] Have you gone for the longer length?
                           [10667] Like with your school trousers or short
                           short?
Dave (PS04V)               [10668] You couldn't te , they were long
Lee (PS04W)                [10669] Short.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10670] Eh?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10671] you can't tell because he had trainers on.
Lee (PS04W)                [10672] Short. [laugh]
Dave (PS04V)               [10673] We may, he measured, we [...] the leg he had
                           trainers on.
                           [10674] And matey done them a little bit longer.
                           [10675] He added a bit.
                           [10676] He done down to the top of the trainer
Brenda (PS04U)             [10677] Have they got turn-ups on?
Lee (PS04W)                [10678] Yeah.
Dave (PS04V)               [10679] and then down a bit more.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10680] [...] they'll cut them. ...
Dave (PS04V)               [10681] Well I should imagine they'll cut them yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10682] They, they will they won't ... they won't
                           just turn them up they'll actually cut them.
Lee (PS04W)                [cough]
Dave (PS04V)               [10683] So [...] he picked it up and he [...] shoes.

                           got it in case.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10685] Go and get your Benolin.
                           [10686] ... Or the other one.
                           [10687] How many [...] has the other one got?
Lee (PS04W)                [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10688] Four at a time?
Lee (PS04W)                [10689] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10690] So how many ti times do you take it?
                           [10691] One spoonful or one [...] ?
Lee (PS04W)                [10692] [...] two teaspoons. ... [...] ...

Lee (PS04W)                [10694] Getting old mate.
Dave (PS04V)               [10695] [laugh] .
                           [10696] Here you are.
                           [10697] If I was to pop my clogs at work or any time
                           ... you'd get fifty five thousand eight hundred
                           eighty pounds.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10698] Quick, knock him off then.
                           [10699] [laugh] . We'll knock him off quick.
Dave (PS04V)               [10700] Plus ... you get your three and a half grand
                           back.
                           [10701] Plus you would get five thousand six hundred
                           and six pounds ... a year pension.
                           [10702] ... Plus the insurance on the house would
                           pay up so you'd have, ha bloody hell, so you'd have
                           about sixty grand in the bank. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10703] Must be worth twenty five grand then.
Dave (PS04V)               [10704] No mortgage.
Lee (PS04W)                [cough]
Dave (PS04V)               [10705] Think how many shirts with that you could
                           buy then.
                           [10706] ... And at the moment ... you know when I'm
                           gonna retire Bren?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10707] When?
                           [10708] ... When is it?
Dave (PS04V)               [10709] This ain't far away.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10710] With that fifty five, yeah?
                           [10711] Fifty five grand.
                           [10712] What if you don't ... if you don't die
                           before?
Dave (PS04V)               [10713] You don't get it, do you.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10714] You don't get it? ...
Dave (PS04V)               [10715] I retire ... I'm sixty five right [...] this
                           is not far away
Brenda (PS04U)             [laugh]
Dave (PS04V)               [10716] when you say it like this.
                           [10717] On the fourth of July two thousand and
                           nineteen.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10718] Is that [...] ?
Dave (PS04V)               [10719] That ain't far away is it? ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [10720] What's that?
                           [10721] At sixty five?
Dave (PS04V)               [10722] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10723] You're sixty five in that year. ...
Dave (PS04V)               [10724] And if I, if I stayed with Tescos and got me
                           pension and that.
                           [10725] But I don't think it's with the A V C's it's
                           just the pension.
                           [10726] ... I could, if I retire at sixty five I can
                           have twenty [...] this is the best bit, twenty one
                           thousand ... pound in a lump sum.
                           [10727] ... And then I could have a pension which
                           would be seven thousand six hundred and seventy
                           three pounds a year which is ... about a hundred and
                           ... twenty pounds
Brenda (PS04U)             [10728] A month.
Dave (PS04V)               [10729] a week.
                           [10730] No a week.
                           [10731] Plus you would have that month's salary.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10732] What would you go ... you wouldn't have a
                           lump sum?
Dave (PS04V)               [10733] Oh yeah, yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10734] You'd have the lump sum as well?
Dave (PS04V)               [10735] Oh I'd have the lump, no ... you can ... it
                           would be more than that.
                           [10736] My pension, if I didn't have it ... if I say
                           I don't want the lump sum, the twenty one grand.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10737] Yeah.
Dave (PS04V)               [10738] It would probably be fourteen thousand pound
                           a year you'd work it on ... two hundred and fifty
                           pound a week.
                           [10739] But [...] if you're sixty five you haven't
                           got much longer to go have you?
                           [10740] ... You know what [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10741] If you took the lump sum and
Dave (PS04V)               [10742] Yeah.
                           [10743] If you get your lump sum out ... if you want
                           a new car you get a new car.
                           [10744] Because you get your state pension as well.
                           [10745] Which is for a couple would be eighty three
                           pounds.
                           [10746] So you'd be on ... you'd have twenty one
                           grand which you could put away.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10747] Live on the interest.
Dave (PS04V)               [10748] No you couldn't live on the interest.
                           [10749] But see the way I, the way I assume, see
                           this ... the endowment on the house is paid ...
                           [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [...]
Dave (PS04V)               [10750] So that goes [...] fifteen thousand.
                           [10751] So you'd have like twenty, well so they
                           [...] about twenty grand so you get twenty grand
                           there.
                           [10752] ... By that time we should have about ... I
                           would say at least another ten thousand pounds in
                           that account of yours.
                           [10753] So you'd have thirty grand there which [...]

Brenda (PS04U)             [10754] And those family assurance things.
Dave (PS04V)               [10755] Yeah.
                           [10756] Plus the shares ... which will be on my
                           side.
                           [10757] Plus this pension so you'd be, you'd have
                           your house paid for so you'd get a nice
Brenda (PS04U)             [10758] A nice nest egg.
Dave (PS04V)               [10759] a nice lump you can ... draw for a holiday
                           and plus have a good living between.
                           [10760] ... That's why that, at the moment I don't
                           see it ... well I don't see it ... a necessity ...
                           you to get a pension.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10761] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)               [10762] But I think
Brenda (PS04U)             [10763] You got that family assurance thing haven't
                           you?
                           [10764] And I've got my TESSA.
Dave (PS04V)               [10765] That's what I mean, yeah.
                           [10766] That's why I say to you, you say oh we've
                           got this we've got that we want that we want this
                           but ... [clears throat] er ... I tell you two
                           thousand nineteen and you're at nineteen ninety two.
                           [10767] That ain't far away though.
                           [10768] ... And plus the fact there's, I don't wanna
                           work till I'm sixty five [...] I wanna pack up about
                           [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10769] What about that pension if you want to pack
                           up before?
Dave (PS04V)               [10770] No it's, it is quite [...] reducing.
                           [10771] That's why you've gotta be er ... put all
                           your things together now.
                           [10772] ... [...] ... See even that there ... If for
                           some reason you go back there and you're not happy
                           with the suit
Lee (PS04W)                [cough]
Dave (PS04V)               [10773] right?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10774] I shall cha , you know me.
Dave (PS04V)               [10775] [...] .
                           [10776] No let him try it on.
                           [10777] Don't take the suit away.
                           [10778] Alright?
                           [10779] Listening?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10780] Right.
                           [10781] Well what if he says well, it's alright you
                           take it away and then bring it back?
Dave (PS04V)               [10782] No.
                           [10783] Well it's no good to you.
                           [10784] Alright?
                           [10785] Don't take the suit away, the only thing I'm
                           a bit dubious [...] well he said well take the suit
                           home and try it ... if it's not he said come back
                           with it, he said and ... we'll exchange it down
                           here.
                           [10786] He said there's no problem with the
                           exchange.
                           [10787] I came out that shop and I thought ... and
                           why the fucking hell didn't he let us try it on
                           there and then?
                           [10788] And if it ain't the right size he can take
                           the one that is.
                           [10789] So I thought perhaps matey only had a small
                           and large.
                           [10790] ... Not a medium so he's given him the small
                           so he's thinking if ... if it doesn't fit ... he's
                           still made the sale.
                           [10791] If you see what I mean.
                           [10792] So you have to go back and have another
                           shirt.
                           [10793] I mean he had about four or five different
                           shirts there.
                           [10794] But it has to be white.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10795] What, did you think it would be too small?
Dave (PS04V)               [10796] Well no cos matey, I don't think so cos
                           matey said he is a small.
                           [10797] Cos I said to him I said well look, he likes
                           his shirts baggy ... he said yeah but you can't have
                           a shirt too baggy with a suit.
                           [10798] So
Brenda (PS04U)             [10799] But that shirt's okay cos it, I mean he can
                           wear that to school can't he?
                           [10800] The rest of
Dave (PS04V)               [10801] Oh yeah.
                           [10802] But he's gotta try it on and make sure it's
                           not, if it's all tight he ain't gonna be happy in it
                           is he?
                           [10803] ... That's if
Brenda (PS04U)             [10804] [...] he said today he said I don't know
                           when I'm gonna wear the suit.
Dave (PS04V)               [10805] Well you said he could wear it ... well like
                           you said most people ... mm ... I'll wear it.

                           get older, I don't care how boring my life is, I
                           will never ever go round their house every week. ...

Brenda (PS04U)             [10824] I reckon she had a few last [...] .
Dave (PS04V)               [10825] I think once a month is nice.

                           say to each other.
Dave (PS04V)               [10829] We talk about
Brenda (PS04U)             [10830] [...] last night?
                           [10831] ... [...] ... I did [...] as well though.
Dave (PS04V)               [10832] What time did they leave?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10833] I should think erm long after.
Dave (PS04V)               [10834] [...] ?
                           [10835] Oh.
                           [10836] [...] seems a bit expensive.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10837] Oh no.
                           [10838] Not really Dave.
Dave (PS04V)               [10839] Yeah I know but I was thinking ... it's
                           alright but where you gonna put it?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10840] [...] .
                           [10841] At the end of her bed.
                           [10842] It's not, it's not like they said.
Dave (PS04V)               [10843] Innit?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10844] Cos the stand's only that size.
                           [10845] She could have it out and she'd have a lot
                           of fun with it and [...] on it.
                           [10846] I mean Argos does, do one.
                           [10847] Three hundred and sixty nine with the drum
                           [...] and everything.
                           [10848] And if the bloke can tape from it.
                           [10849] I mean you can't, it's not, I mean you
                           couldn't have it in like
Dave (PS04V)               [10850] What she want it for then?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10851] Er?
Dave (PS04V)               [10852] What she want it for?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10853] Who?
Dave (PS04V)               [10854] Carla.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10855] Well she can either sing in it ... play the
                           organ, sing in it and tape it as well.
                           [10856] You can have a lot of fun with them.
                           [10857] Can't erm like ... the one she's got
                           upstairs is like ... all she was quite happy with is
                           a seventy pound one.
                           [10858] Like that but a bigger version with full
                           keys.
Dave (PS04V)               [10859] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10860] But this one this bloke's got is a full key
                           like a piano.
Dave (PS04V)               [10861] Oh is it?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10862] And you've got all the tunes.
                           [10863] You've got all the [...] you've got I think
                           a hundred voices.
                           [10864] You've got jazz, ballet, all different
                           things on it.
Dave (PS04V)               [10865] Oh.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10866] I mean it's ... it's good to play [...] .
                           [10867] Well I think that's quite ... I mean I'd
                           probably knock him down to a hundred anyway.
                           [10868] ... I said to him if if, last night I said I
                           probably [...] .
                           [10869] I said I want to try it out first.
                           [10870] Leave it at your house and I'll try it out
                           ... and erm ... but Nick wouldn't sell it to you if
                           he thought it was ...
Dave (PS04V)               [10871] Oh no.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10872] not worth it.
                           [10873] ... But he, I mean that one from Argos [...]
                           seventy quid.
                           [10874] And it's not the full size keys or anything.
Dave (PS04V)               [10875] What's he flogging it for? [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10876] Been made redundant.
                           [10877] It's
Dave (PS04V)               [10878] Where did he work?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10879] it's er ... she did say.
                           [10880] It's Pete's erm, Pete!
                           [10881] Nick's sister's boyfriend.
                           [10882] ... Dunno who it is
Dave (PS04V)               [10883] Oh well we've got the cash.
                           [10884] The money's, like I said to you [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10885] Oh yeah but the thing is it's something,
                           it's the main, it's something she, it's like [...]
                           said to her last night
Dave (PS04V)               [10886] Well if she wants that you let her have it.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10887] what do you want?
                           [10888] She said I want an organ but mum would never
                           let me have one.
                           [10889] And it's worth
Dave (PS04V)               [10890] The only thing I don't like about it is the
                           noise.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10891] Ah yeah but it's not noisy noisy are they?
Dave (PS04V)               [10892] Aren't they?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10893] And the fact, what I like about it, it can
                           be battery or mains.
Dave (PS04V)               [10894] Oh [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10895] Plug it in.
                           [10896] And I mean ... she's, you've got room out
                           there to have it if it just stands.
                           [10897] ... And then that
Dave (PS04V)               [10898] I was gonna say, tell you something.
                           [10899] You [...] .
                           [10900] That's [...] .
                           [10901] Someone had an intruder.
                           [10902] I'm not sure ... but I think it was Mrs
                           Turner.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10903] Well funny enough she's, she's got a light
                           to put on now.
Dave (PS04V)               [10904] Yeah.
                           [10905] I see the bloke putting them up.
                           [10906] Because it was an old age woman, they ain't
                           give anyone's names ... old age woman was ... er ...
                           it was in the paper sort of ... met up with an
                           intruder in her house like.
                           [10907] ... and I dunno went screaming, went
                           crackers.
                           [10908] ... But then he said a neighbour ... who had
                           a dress [...] , just wearing a dressing gown ... and
                           he was married with three kids which is next door
                           ... heard what going, been going on and he ... they
                           were chasing, were chasing all through the common.
                           [10909] Virtually all the way out to ... [...] park
                           but they didn't give his name either.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10910] Must be her.
Dave (PS04V)               [10911] That's what I thought when I see her put her
                           lights up.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10912] I didn't see, I just saw them lit up last,
                           all last night lit up.
Dave (PS04V)               [10913] Yeah.
                           [10914] Yeah I just assumed I thought oh hallo.
                           [10915] I was reading it in the paper I thought oh I
                           wonder if is.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10916] And she had that paint didn't she?
                           [10917] That iffy painter?
Dave (PS04V)               [10918] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10919] Trouble is they know she lives there on her
                           own.
Dave (PS04V)               [10920] Mm.
                           [10921] ... That's what I mean.
                           [10922] We don't wanna put a lot of valuable stuff
                           out here.
                           [10923] Cos at any time I mean, if we're here I mean
                           [...] ... there's always someone in cos I'm working
                           nights so I'm here in the days.
                           [10924] ... So easy to break that
Brenda (PS04U)             [10925] [...] I'm glad I've got, broke the back of
                           it.
                           [10926] All I've got now is I haven't gotta go out
                           for a main, if I'm out ... just pick up a couple of
                           bits for him when [...] from Woking.
                           [10927] But I can go to Woking and get whatever
Dave (PS04V)               [10928] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10929] And that's like Carla.
                           [10930] I might, what you got from Argos the other
                           day, I might keep one of the things back for her
                           birthday. ...
Dave (PS04V)               [10931] Trouble is if they get so much [...] they
                           don't use it.
                           [10932] I mean it's different if it's clothes they
                           need, good.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10933] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)               [10934] But if it's toys.
                           [10935] They get all the toys and they [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10936] She needs [...] .
                           [10937] She's got nothing up there what we brought.
                           [10938] Alright that [...] but nothing [...] one
                           game ... she can actually play with.
                           [10939] It's like Lee I mean he'll have all his
                           stuff and that, he's got nothing to do.
Dave (PS04V)               [10940] [...] hasn't he?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10941] But she does still.
Dave (PS04V)               [10942] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10943] God [...] that'd be a nightmare.
                           [10944] She's got fifty presents to buy.
Dave (PS04V)               [10945] Where she going for Christmas then?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10946] Well if Vicky's in hospital she said they're
                           going for the day there.
Dave (PS04V)               [10947] Are they?
                           [10948] But if, how does [...] ?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10949] [...] she's not well enough [...] .
                           [10950] But [...] I mean I think Gill sort of
                           worries the fact I think she's, I mean nobody said
                           she'd be in there till Christmas.
                           [10951] The doctor just said
Dave (PS04V)               [10952] No well if she's eating [...] they aren't
                           going to let her out.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10953] Well she's down to six stone eleven.
                           [10954] ... She was nine four ... before this
                           started.
                           [10955] ... No she's lost four stone, she was ten
                           stone four.
                           [10956] ... And then she's been average on the last
                           three or four months she's been on eight stone.
                           [10957] But now it's gone down, but there's no ulcer
                           she had a laparotomy on Friday ... [...] the tube.
                           [10958] And there's nothing wrong with her ... it
                           was just sort of it's just nerves isn't it?
                           [10959] Strain and nerves.
Dave (PS04V)               [10960] [...] I keep thinking, I mean I can [...]
                           when I first met her [...] .
                           [10961] She ... I mean she's got all the facilities
                           about her but she don't seem
Brenda (PS04U)             [10962] She's ever so, I mean she's very quiet and
                           sort of sweet but she's got no
Dave (PS04V)               [10963] Got no idea.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10964] I mean I said to her today ... I mean there
                           was this costume there and I said here get that one
                           there I said ... french maid outfit, nurse's outfit.
                           [10965] I said get [...] that then.
                           [10966] And she went no I wouldn't wear that!
                           [10967] I said oh Dave would like that.
                           [10968] There was no ... you know no, no sort of
                           sense of humour there ... at all.
                           [10969] But erm ... you know I've, I've ... but she
                           said he's been right sort of [...]
Dave (PS04V)               [10970] Well you would be wouldn't you?
                           [10971] Tying all that money up in the house.
                           [10972] Now if he's gotta make out himself there'll
                           be a possibility he might be losing it.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10973] But you don't know how bad he is.
                           [10974] I mean he wouldn't sack his ex wife.
                           [10975] She still works with him in the shop.
                           [10976] And Gill gave her job to go and work in the
                           shop ... and he wouldn't let her go and work in it.
                           [10977] I said I thought it was you?
                           [10978] She said no he kept saying oh ... we'll
                           start you in a month, start you in a month [...] if
                           I get rid of her.
                           [10979] And he wouldn't get rid of her.
                           [10980] And that's where a lot of it ... and she
                           still think's that he's
Dave (PS04V)               [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10981] Yeah.
                           [10982] I mean he was married for quite a long time
                           to her apparently.
                           [10983] And she only lives two doors from the shop.
                           [10984] Goes round there for his lunch.
Dave (PS04V)               [10985] [laughing] Does he? []
Brenda (PS04U)             [10986] Yeah!
                           [10987] ... I mean ... you know he's made the break.
                           [10988] And she said he's just so ... you know ...
Dave (PS04V)               [10989] [...] it was one beer and that was it.
                           [10990] I couldn't believe [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [10991] Yeah.
Dave (PS04V)               [10992] [...] how come you're back in?
Brenda (PS04U)             [10993] It's just ... [...] different people aren't
                           they?

Dave (PS04V)               [10995] Oh well so all we've really gotta do now
                           then is just get out and do a shop ... for
                           Christmas.

Dave (PS04V)               [10998] Yeah all we want is a turkey.
Brenda (PS04U)             [10999] Bit of turkey and some ... drink.

                           think well, if you've gotta sort of something like

                           think well just the more the merrier.

                           done and then

                           [11057] As long as there's something
Dave (PS04V)               [11058] You open it up and you look at it and say oh
                           thanks.

                           an expense but she said but it's something ... that

                           quid.

               a tin of baked beans more than the other one on a Sunday.

Brenda (PS04U) [11770] You got maths and ... [...] .
Lee (PS04W)    [11771] All we're doing tonight is maths.
Brenda (PS04U) [11772] Oh.
Dave (PS04V)   [11773] Don't forget I'll be coming to bed [...] .
               [11774] And when the workmen start [...] ... no sounds I'm
               afraid unless they're very very low.
Lee (PS04W)    [11775] Yeah. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [11776] Thank you.
Brenda (PS04U) [11777] You don't hear them though, do you?
Dave (PS04V)   [11778] [...] I was putting the spuds on, I dunno ... twenty
               past two I think.
               [11779] I was sat on the couch ... and when I woke up, ten to
               three.
               [11780] Fuck me they'll be burnt. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [11781] Well I thought today at work ... thought there's no way
               he's gonna last out.
               [11782] I thought I bet he's fighting it.
               [11783] It's alright if you keep busy but it's ... when you stop
               and stand innit?
Dave (PS04V)   [11784] Yeah I know.
               [11785] That's what I mean, when I go to bed I should in theory
               ... [...] .
               [11786] But I say I ... went all day without nothing to eat ...
               [...] bloody starved.
               [11787] I got in there and I thought ... cos I wanted bacon and
               eggs [...] but I thought if I have breakfast I'm gonna think
               well ... [...] .
               [11788] So I went in, I just had an egg on toast [...] really
               nice.
Brenda (PS04U) [11789] And that's when you bought your meat pies?
Dave (PS04V)   [11790] Yeah I thought well he's sitting home I can't [...] .
               [11791] [...] I said to the girl give us two meat pies wrapped
               up.
Brenda (PS04U) [11792] She probably thought blinking pig!
Dave (PS04V)   [11793] [laugh] ... come in he was like a little big kid.
               [11794] I said come on get your breakfast.
               [11795] He said what you got then?
               [11796] I said ... it's in my coat.
               [11797] He said ... [...] .
               [11798] [laugh] I said do you want it I said, get out here I
               said fucking get it.
               [11799] He got out here, when he unwraps it he ... beaming like
               a little ki [laugh] . [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [11800] Did he put them in the microwave?
Dave (PS04V)   [11801] No he went off.
Brenda (PS04U) [11802] What stuck, just from Tesco [...] ?
Dave (PS04V)   [11803] Yeah.
               [11804] They was wrapped up.
               [11805] I shoved them in me coat and [...] .
               [11806] He was sitting there eating pie sandwiches [laugh] .
               [11807] Like a great big baby.
               [11808] I thought you [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [11809] [...] twenty past eight.
Dave (PS04V)   [11810] Yeah.
               [11811] Well when he, I said where do you get that from?
               [11812] He said oh I been [...] .
               [11813] I thought well, you must have rode him up there thinking
               ... you know, get him something to watch.
               [11814] I thought you'd gone up there and got it.
               [11815] I didn't realize he'd gone up and got it himself. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [11816] [...] ten past nine [...] .
               [11817] ... That tree [...] budding there [...] .
Dave (PS04V)   [11818] Yeah.
               [11819] That's ... middle [...] , that's coming up innit?
Brenda (PS04U) [11820] It's growing up nice.
               [11821] This first one's not doing much is it?
               [11822] I think it was suffocated by those others.
Dave (PS04V)   [11823] Yeah.
               [11824] That's like that little one over there, that's [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [11825] Or unless it's ... that's the height.
Dave (PS04V)   [11826] No [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [11827] Your trees are growing now aren't they?
Dave (PS04V)   [11828] Yeah.
               [11829] They've shot up actually.
               [11830] This time next year you you'll have a good ... you'll
               have a nice little hedge there then.
               [11831] That'll be up ... [...] be up at least another s ooh
               foot probably.
               [11832] ... Probably be a ... a lot higher than the sticks but
               they won't have bushed out. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [11833] Don't you have to ... do you ... no cos if you trim them
               at the top to bush out
Dave (PS04V)   [11834] Yeah you do.
Brenda (PS04U) [11835] Oh you do.
               [11836] When it's finished
Dave (PS04V)   [11837] Not ... not until you get to the height that you want.
Brenda (PS04U) [11838] You want.
Dave (PS04V)   [11839] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [11840] Where you gonna go?
               [11841] Just like er ...
Dave (PS04V)   [11842] That's ... just about the same height as the fence you
               see.
               [11843] Not the ... pointed bit but the ... gutter level.
Brenda (PS04U) [11844] I shall be glad when that privet hedge g ... privet
               hedge grows.
               [11845] And hides his bit of shed.
               [11846] ... Dunno where Mike and Barbara's gone [...] .
Dave (PS04V)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [11847] [...] .
               [11848] They're going away Saturday for a week or something.
Dave (PS04V)   [11849] Oh are they?
Brenda (PS04U) [11850] She does that [...] shift doesn't she?
               [11851] Twelve weeks on eight weeks off.
               [11852] She's semi-retired.
Dave (PS04V)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [11853] [...] would you? [cough]
Dave (PS04V)   [11854] That's what I mean.
               [11855] [...] Why don't she have decent car.
               [11856] Travel round Britain ... Scotland and that.
               [11857] Have a nice bed and breakfast.
               [11858] ... There's so many places they haven't seen or haven't
               been.
               [11859] They just don't [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [11860] They're gonna buy a new car aren't they?
Dave (PS04V)   [11861] Eh?
Brenda (PS04U) [11862] They're gonna buy a new car at Christmas, after
               Christmas.
Dave (PS04V)   [11863] Who?
Brenda (PS04U) [...]
Dave (PS04V)   [11864] [...] !
Brenda (PS04U) [11865] Yeah.
               [11866] I remember he said when you, mum got that money.
Dave (PS04V)   [11867] No.
               [11868] I dunno he said he's got this one fixed now. [...] . ...

Brenda (PS04U) [11869] He's got it fixed?
Dave (PS04V)   [11870] [...] fixed it didn't he?
Brenda (PS04U) [11871] What's the matter with him?
Dave (PS04V)   [11872] They wanna get themselves something like a one point
               eight hatchback, so it's got a little, nice sized engine
Brenda (PS04U) [11873] Automatic.
Dave (PS04V)   [11874] Yeah.
               [11875] ... Get like they are, semi-retired and why they're
               putting that great lump on the end of their house I just don't
               know.
               [11876] But that's up to them.
               [11877] Beats me.
               [11878] Cos there's never more than about two of them [...] is
               there?
Brenda (PS04U) [11879] And then he goes out doesn't he?
               [11880] Occasionally.
Dave (PS04V)   [11881] That's what I mean.
               [11882] They're gonna have a great big lump stuck on the house.
               [11883] I mean that ten grand, that's their car.
               [11884] They could keep their house.
               [11885] Use it as a base ... and travel.
               [11886] ... They could shoot off on a Tuesday or something.
               [11887] Take their time going up to Scotland.
               [11888] ... You could have a week up ... two weeks up there.
               [11889] You could come back, do a bit more work.
               [11890] [...] . By the time they pack up work they'll be so
               decrepit they won't be able to do anything. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [11891] I think your mum'll probably retire when your dad does
               won't she?
Dave (PS04V)   [11892] [...] aren't they?
               [11893] ... I dunno.
               [11894] ... Mind you, [...] criticize and say should buy this
               should buy that.
               [11895] You don't really know what sort of money they have got
               do you?
               [11896] Haven't got a clue.
Brenda (PS04U) [11897] Must have a fair bit thought mustn't they?
Dave (PS04V)   [11898] I mean I I [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [11899] When you think they're earn both earning a full wage.
               [11900] No mortgage.
               [11901] ... Haven't got no rates.
               [11902] They've got the poll tax ... and their gas and electric
               ... and the phone bill.
               [11903] That's all that comes out.
Dave (PS04V)   [11904] They probably [...] about twelve hundred, thirteen
               hundred [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [11905] [...] got a lot of money.
Dave (PS04V)   [11906] Oh I don't know.
Brenda (PS04U) [11907] Well she gets, how much does she get from her pension a
               week?
Dave (PS04V)   [11908] Oh ... that's without the pensions.
               [11909] That's just their wages.
               [11910] So they get about ... twelve [...] thirteen hundred.
               [11911] And probably picking up another ... hundred pound ...
               hundred and twenty pound between them a week.
               [11912] We'll say another five.
               [11913] No they're probably ... they're probably clearing every
               month about seventeen hundred quid. [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [11914] And what have they got to pay out?
Dave (PS04V)   [11915] Poll tax.
               [11916] Food.
               [11917] ... That's basically it really. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [11918] Think, they've got no mortgage.
               [11919] And the bills aren't that high are they?
               [11920] ... Think they've actually bought the T V now haven't
               they? ...
Dave (PS04V)   [11921] Oh yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [11922] T V and the video. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [11923] Mind you when you think of it like that when you ...
               when you say that you've got no mortgage and your kids grow up
               they don't need your money and that ... and if you're both in
               good jobs ... it is ... you do tend to think to yourself well at
               least lot ... lot longer than.
               [11924] ... Sort of, you've got your health [...] knock out
               [...] sixty seventy, right we can do it for another year.
               [11925] I mean [...] got no mortgage to pay out you can ... you
               can bank eight hundred pound of that ... every month.
Brenda (PS04U) [11926] Well they probably do but ... I mean ... right they can
               go and ... I mean what do they spend their money on?
Dave (PS04V)   [11927] Presumably perhaps they're just saving it up until they
               get to a certain ... certain age and they're gonna say right
               that's it let's ... just go.
               [11928] [laughing] But I can't see it either [] .
Brenda (PS04U) [11929] [...] no sort of well they don't do anything do they?
               [11930] I reckon she must be, by the time they get home from
               work she don't wanna do a lot.
               [11931] ... [cough] I thought she ... but I'm trying to think
               what she phoned me up for.
               [11932] ... Yeah, she phoned me up to ask me ... what she should
               do about Beryl.
Dave (PS04V)   [11933] What she should do [...] ?
Brenda (PS04U) [11934] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [11935] What do you mean what she should do about Beryl?
Brenda (PS04U) [11936] For Christmas presents.
Dave (PS04V)   [11937] [...] .
               [11938] See if [...] makes contact with her ... your mum'll
               start on her then.
Brenda (PS04U) [11939] Well I said to her ... er your mum asked me last night.
               [11940] She said ... I, will I get a bottle of wine and that?
               [11941] And I said well ... And she, well to be honest Bren she
               said, she hasn't really done anything to me and Sid has she?
               [11942] ... I said well no, you know
Dave (PS04V)   [11943] [...] I told her I said as soon as you receive gifts
               like that ... I said she knows you're a soft touch mate.
               [11944] She'll be ... she'll be
Brenda (PS04U) [11945] Yeah but she does it ... like she said though ... I mean
               if I was your mum, I said to her if I was, I would just give it
               to her.
               [11946] I said because the fact is
Dave (PS04V)   [11947] How's she gonna see her anyway?
Brenda (PS04U) [11948] Well she'll just give it to Ellie to give her.
               [11949] ... And send it up there and she said, and I mean all
               she, she buys Linda a tin of biscuits, Jane a tin of biscuits
               and Ellie.
               [11950] ... And she said well thing is if I don't do it Bren I
               don't want, you know she's bound to sort of say.
               [11951] ... I said well no cos she probably do ... expects you
               not to bother.
Dave (PS04V)   [11952] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [11953] I said just do it and I said thing is if she just
               ignores you ... I said you know not to bother next year.
               [11954] I said just get her a bottle of ... you know
Dave (PS04V)   [11955] Table wine.
Brenda (PS04U) [11956] One ninety nine Sainsbury's wine.
               [11957] I said just get something cheap, and a card.
               [11958] And she said well you know I thought we'd better.
               [11959] But she said obviously you and Dave asked me, us not to
               we won't.
               [11960] I said well it's nothing to do with me Pam.
Dave (PS04V)   [11961] Oh s .
Brenda (PS04U) [11962] I just couldn't go into it and I said you know ... it'll
               only, I mean the fact is she's, was buying Ellie and Jane ...
               Ellie and Linda.
               [11963] And should she leave Jane out?
               [11964] And I said well she ... Jane hasn't done nothing to you
               really Pam to be honest.
               [11965] I said the argument's between me not you.
               [11966] Well this is what me and Sid said. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [11967] No.
               [11968] He's at work.
Dave (PS04V)   [11969] She's starting the old [...] ain't she?
               [11970] Can you imagine that?
               [11971] Oh god!
Brenda (PS04U) [11972] She's having a ... I told you she's having a Christmas
               party now ... Sunday straight after Christmas.
               [11973] I said we've got the pantomime on the Saturday.
               [11974] She said well the following Sunday Lee's away so

Brenda (PS04U) [11976] Well she's having her party so Christmas day is the
               Wednesday ... boxing day is the Thursday ... and she [...] and
               she having her party on the Saturday, Sunday.

Brenda (PS04U) [11989] Are you?
               [11990] Why's that then?
Dave (PS04V)   [11991] So they might, they might work us.
               [11992] Well they might, it depends how busy they are obviously.

                           [12202] Cos she didn't think she would.
                           [12203] ... And like well I said to her I said well
                           then Sandy would have put it down to the fact ...
                           she did that bad in her ballet. ...
Carla (PS04X)              [12204] Has to be a reason [...] .
Brenda (PS04U)             [12205] But it's, I mean ... like Tracey said are
                           you disappointed?
                           [12206] I said well no I cos I said I expected a co
                           ... I think she deserved a more than a commended.
                           [12207] But I said it's always the way when you
                           think it's a good examiner she or ... she, she gives
                           you bad results and when it's a bad, think oh an
                           awful examiner ... I mean look at that one where you
                           got that really tough examiner and you and Jenny was
                           the only two that got honours.
                           [12208] ... But I didn't that Michelle [yawn]
Carla (PS04X)              [12209] Yeah and I know that but then ... when I get
                           the same as Jenny she goes to Leanne if we beat her
                           yeah?
                           [12210] She go she goes up to Leanne. ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [12211] Yeah but it's like Leanne.
                           [12212] I don't know how Leanne always gets ... it
                           must be the fact she's slim.
                           [12213] But Tracey said they obvious this examiner
                           ... has obviously looked ...
Carla (PS04X)              [12214] Got any scissors?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12215] for slim people.
                           [12216] Which is wrong.
Carla (PS04X)              [12217] But that's not very nice though, is it?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12218] No.
                           [12219] But that's what Tracey said.
                           [12220] That's what happened with her.
                           [12221] She went in with sl slim girls and they all
                           fa fail passed, and Tracey failed.
                           [12222] ... Because Tracey was
Carla (PS04X)              [12223] But that's not a very nice thing to do
                           though.
                           [12224] Because as they shouldn't fail ... you if
                           you're fat.
                           [12225] I'm not exactly fat.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12226] No, you're not fat.
Carla (PS04X)              [12227] It's just that I'm big build.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12228] That's right. ... [...] ...
Carla (PS04X)              [12229] Mum can I have one of these?
                           [12230] Can I use one of these? ...
Brenda (PS04U)             [12231] What is it?
                           [12232] No they're yours aren't they?
                           [12233] Where's your toys?
                           [12234] Upstairs?
Carla (PS04X)              [12235] Dunno.
                           [12236] Oh [...] back.
Brenda (PS04U)             [cough]
Carla (PS04X)              [12237] Look at this!
                           [12238] Nineteen eighty six.
                           [12239] ... Oh [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [12240] But she said ... you know, and what annoyed
                           her really she kno , she knows how much ... how hard
                           you've worked for this exam.
Carla (PS04X)              [12241] I know.
                           [12242] I tried to do it really well because it was
                           my last grade.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12243] But she, but she even said to me while you
                           was in there ... she said Carla's got the advantage
                           of the fact that she's so good at [...] .
Carla (PS04X)              [12244] But that's not the point really.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12245] No but ... yeah but the thing is Carla, be
                           honest with you ... if you'd got honours again ... I
                           mean, you imagine I mean thing is I'm happy for you
                           for what you've done.
                           [12246] You've done well to get that.
                           [12247] ... It's like Jennifer you've got to look at
                           it ... she's gotta keep up now all the time,
                           honours.
                           [12248] ... You've got honours for your tap.
                           [12249] Yes y I think you'd be more disappointed if
                           you, if you'd taken the tap this time and you'd come
                           out with a commended.
                           [12250] ... But Tracey just very cross with her
                           marks.
                           [12251] It don't look [...] good on her does it?
                           [12252] Only just passes.
                           [12253] ... This last results she only got one pass.
Carla (PS04X)              [12254] I won't get the award will I?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12255] No.
                           [12256] ... But [...] award anyway [...] medal.
                           [12257] Junior tap, yeah but you'll get the junior
                           tap.
Carla (PS04X)              [12258] Got the junior tap and the senior tap.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12259] Yeah but you'll get that next year again.
Carla (PS04X)              [12260] Why?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12261] Because you got honours didn't you?
                           [12262] In grade three. ...
Carla (PS04X)              [12263] No cos junior tap was for grade three.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12264] Have you done grade four tap?
                           [12265] ... Yeah but you won't take it by July will
                           you?
                           [12266] ... Or would you take it in May?
                           [12267] You take gold in May don't you?
                           [12268] ... But Tracey thought Lisa was good.
                           [12269] She thought she'd get a good mark.
                           [12270] ... She said she does stretch her body.
                           [12271] She has come on Lisa hasn't she?
                           [12272] She's better than Emma.
Carla (PS04X)              [12273] Mm by a long way.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12274] I said what annoys me I said er but Emma and
                           Lisa haven't even practised.
                           [12275] ... I said, I said thing is I said ... last
                           time everybody thought Carla was gonna get highly
                           commended or honours ... do you remember?
                           [12276] Everybody said you were the best.
                           [12277] They all said oh you'll do it, you'll get
                           the best.
                           [12278] And you never got the award last year for
                           it.
                           [12279] All of them got highly commended didn't
                           they?
                           [12280] Hannah and all that lot.
                           [12281] ... Annabelle.
Carla (PS04X)              [12282] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12283] And you think the drop on Hannah.
                           [12284] Grade three she got highly commended.
                           [12285] And grade four she got a pass.
                           [12286] So look at the big drop on that one.
                           [12287] Least you, that's what I said to Tracey, at
                           least you haven't dropped your mark.
                           [12288] ... If you stay on the same mark or higher
                           it's good. ...
Carla (PS04X)              [12289] Don't wanna take this exam again.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12290] It's poor old Stephanie I feel sorry for.
Carla (PS04X)              [12291] Why?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12292] She, I mean I don't think she's that bad and
                           she only ever
Carla (PS04X)              [12293] She goes to pot in exams.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12294] Does she?
                           [12295] ... She always only ever gets a pass.
Carla (PS04X)              [12296] Highest, guess what her highest mark is?
                           [12297] ... Pass plus.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12298] Is it?
                           [12299] That must be horr she must feel
Carla (PS04X)              [12300] And that was
Brenda (PS04U)             [12301] horrible.
                           [12302] Every time, well she only got a pass.
Carla (PS04X)              [12303] Mm?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12304] She only got a pass.
                           [12305] ... Where you o ... where you going?
Lee (PS04W)                [...]

Lee (PS04W)                [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [12307] Has he gone?
Lee (PS04W)                [12308] No.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12309] Oh.
Lee (PS04W)                [12310] [...] upstairs for half hour.

                           boiling anyway?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12312] I wanted a cup of tea.
                           [12313] ... When we gonna do the Christmas tree
                           then?
Carla (PS04X)              [12314] Eh?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12315] When we gonna do the Christmas tree?

Carla (PS04X)              [12319] Ow!

Carla (PS04X)              [12322] It's just [...] .
Brenda (PS04U)             [12323] Shall we have a cup of tea?
                           [12324] [...] What do you say you're never gonna do
                           exams again?
Carla (PS04X)              [12325] Yeah.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12326] Don't be stupid.
                           [12327] That's what Tracey said.
                           [12328] You mustn't get a downer cos of it. ...
Carla (PS04X)              [12329] Downer?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12330] Because she said she's ... you know ... it's
                           not your fault.
                           [12331] You deserved more. ...
Carla (PS04X)              [12332] Examiner don't think think so, do they?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12333] Mm stupid examiner.

                           marks were all the bad ones.
                           [12335] Worse in the morning.
                           [12336] She said erm her marks were all over the
                           place.
                           [12337] The worst marks she'd ever got from an
                           examiner.
                           [12338] ... Of course Tracey ... why she's upset ...
                           is because she said that she had this examiner ...
Unknown speaker (KBFPSUNK) [...]
Brenda (PS04U)             [12339] That's alright.

Lee (PS04W)                [12347] Spoilt.
Carla (PS04X)              [12348] Why you got Jean's shoes on mum?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12349] Because I've had my slippers on [...] ... to
                           wear.
Carla (PS04X)              [12350] You were saying?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12351] What was I saying?
Carla (PS04X)              [12352] I dunno. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U)             [12353] Yeah cos don't you remember Tracey on the
                           day of the exam? ... we'll do alright here, she
                           likes my style.
                           [12354] And that's, Tracey's really upset.
                           [12355] ... Cos she thinks now ... because she got
                           passes ... just mainly passes ... she thinks that
                           her school's, looks bad on her school.

                           [12388] And the ones that haven't really bothered
                           and weren't that good at it

Brenda (PS04U)             [12398] No.
                           [12399] She thought Emma might have got a commended
                           or highly commended.
Carla (PS04X)              [12400] She [...] put no effort into it in the exam.
                           [12401] She, she was
Brenda (PS04U)             [12402] Yes but
Carla (PS04X)              [12403] talking.
                           [12404] She might have put me down for talking.
                           [12405] I weren't talking.
                           [12406] Emma was talking to Lisa and she looked at
                           me.
                           [12407] ... She could have put me down for talking
Brenda (PS04U)             [12408] Mm.

                           [12410] Cos I was in the middle of Emma and Lisa and
                           they were chatting.
                           [12411] ... Right Lisa was there I was there and
                           Emma was there and them two were leaning over.
                           [12412] And when she looked [...] and she looked at
                           me.
Brenda (PS04U)             [12413] Perhaps she thought it was you chatting.
                           [12414] ... [...] ... perhaps she thought, that's
                           it, I bet ... she writes it down chatting ... in the
                           exam.

Brenda (PS04U)             [12429] No.

                           now.
Carla (PS04X)              [12431] That's what you had.

Carla (PS04X)              [12440] She keeps their ... dog inside?
Brenda (PS04U)             [12441] Because she said because he won't let the

                           inside.
                           [12442] Then when she was talking to me someone
                           knocked at the door [...] then Auntie Linda was
                           saying he won't bite you, he's alright.

               [13093] Tracey said you just tell Carla [...] and you let me
               hear anyone say anything.
               [13094] She thinks the world of you.
               [13095] Tracey does.
               [13096] And she said I'm really glad she talked to me now she
               said.
               [13097] She said I thought oh my god she's not gonna talk to me!
               [13098] And I said well she wasn't.
               [13099] I said she wanted to but you ... you didn't know what to
               say and you [...] ... yes ... mm ... mm ... yeah

Brenda (PS04U) [13110] You've got your Christmas party.
Carla (PS04X)  [13111] Jenny's horrible to me.
               [13112] She's not having hers. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [13113] Just ignore her.
               [13114] I mean why don't you just if she says why ... I mean
               she'll obviously have Sandy there and Sandy'll say ... why isn't
               Carla speaking to you?
               [13115] I shall say ... because your daughter's being nasty.
               [cough]
Carla (PS04X)  [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [13116] She won't.
               [13117] She won't [...] I guarantee it.

Carla (PS04X)  [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [13119] look ... you three got honours.
               [13120] I don't want you bragging and being bigheaded because

Carla (PS04X)  [13125] I've done it!
Brenda (PS04U) [13126] When?
Carla (PS04X)  [13127] [laugh] I swear to god.
Brenda (PS04U) [13128] You'd better have.
Carla (PS04X)  [13129] Yeah I have.
Brenda (PS04U) [13130] I don't like lies.
Carla (PS04X)  [13131] I was in a really bad mood at school.
Brenda (PS04U) [13132] You've been in a bad mood all day.
Carla (PS04X)  [13133] I know. [laugh]
Brenda (PS04U) [13134] Why?
Carla (PS04X)  [13135] Dunno.
Brenda (PS04U) [13136] Now what did I tell, see part of growing up, right ...

               I was coughing at work I felt like sitting there [...] and I
               thought ... I can't believe this.
               [13138] Why me?
               [13139] Why ... why is god being horrible to me?
               [13140] Six weeks I've been ill.
               [13141] Why?
               [13142] He's gi ... given me this, given me that.
               [13143] ... I get everything that's going and now god's given
               them to me.
               [13144] It's not fair.
               [13145] But it's life.
               [13146] You have your ups and downs.
               [13147] ... But look at Jennifer.
               [13148] Have you gotta wear glasses?
               [13149] Have you gotta wear a brace?
               [13150] ... No!
               [13151] You're lucky. ...

Lee (PS04W)    [13230] Why's she been crying?
Brenda (PS04U) [13231] Just [...] been talking to Tracey.

Brenda (PS04U) [13234] Tracey said that she's just gonna be one of these ...
               the judge either likes you or he don't like you.
               [13235] And like I said to her it's like James.

               his maths and get an A.

               [13240] And like she said ... two [...] and Jennifer's walked in
               there and they're halfway there already cos they liked the look
               of them.
Lee (PS04W)    [13241] They're just like ... James.

               ... dance the same as you
Brenda (PS04U) [13243] They haven't practised or anything but they don't need
               to.
               [13244] They just go in there and they come out with it.
               [13245] But they'll come unstuck later on.
Lee (PS04W)    [13246] His family ... it's like dad ... if he wants to better
               himself at running ... he's not a natural at it.
               [13247] He's gotta work at it.
Brenda (PS04U) [13248] We all have.
Lee (PS04W)    [13249] His family, everyone in it, we have to work at what we
               do.
Brenda (PS04U) [13250] It don't come easy to us.
               [13251] Like Tracy said they're b born with a silver spoon in
               their mouth.

Lee (PS04W)    [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [13253] That's it.
               [13254] Part of life and growing up.
               [13255] But Tracey knows you're dedicated and it's silly giving
               it up.
Carla (PS04X)  [13256] I'm not giving it up.
Brenda (PS04U) [13257] No.
               [13258] But saying right, I'm not going tomorrow night.
               [13259] Go and show them.
               [13260] Like Tracy said ... sod them all.
               [13261] If they're nasty to you ... ignore them.
               [13262] ... It's like Tracey said with you're ... I mean she did
               her gold star ... she was waiting for the letter to come
               through, Tracey.
               [13263] Thinking she got honours.
               [13264] Opened the letter and she failed.
Lee (PS04W)    [13265] Who?
Brenda (PS04U) [13266] Tracey.
               [13267] She couldn't believe it.
Lee (PS04W)    [13268] Tracey?
Brenda (PS04U) [13269] Yeah.
               [13270] She'd give it everything she's got.
               [13271] She said I worked for weeks and months on that exam.
               [13272] And she failed it.
               [13273] And do you know what age she took grade four?
               [13274] ... And got a commended?
Carla (PS04X)  [13275] She said she didn't start getting erm ... high marks and
               a commended when she, when she was fifteen.
Brenda (PS04U) [13276] Fifteen sixteen before she got a highly
Lee (PS04W)    [13277] And how old are you?
               [13278] Eleven?
Brenda (PS04U) [13279] Exactly.
               [13280] ... Eleven years old and you're in elementary now!
Carla (PS04X)  [13281] Pre-elementary.
Brenda (PS04U) [13282] Pre-element ... yeah!
               [13283] Look at Vicky.
               [13284] You're not much lower than Vicky.
               [13285] And Vicky's nearly fifteen.
Lee (PS04W)    [13286] Yeah.
               [13287] ... You'll get better than all of them.
               [13288] You'll be teaching them all soon.
Brenda (PS04U) [13289] You, like Tracey said she had to

Brenda (PS04U) [13291] Out of the school, how many of them got in at Sound of
               Music out of those hundred kids?
               [13292] Did Jennifer get in?
               [13293] Did Emma get in?
               [13294] Think how Emma must have felt.
Lee (PS04W)    [13295] How many of them Carla can dance
Brenda (PS04U) [13296] Her two sisters got in and not Emma.
Lee (PS04W)    [13297] Oi.
               [13298] How many of them can dance sing and act?
Brenda (PS04U) [13299] Exactly.
               [13300] That's what exactly what Tracey tells her.
Carla (PS04X)  [13301] Lisa. ...
Lee (PS04W)    [13302] One.
Brenda (PS04U) [13303] She's this is the first time she's got honours for an
               exam Carla.
               [13304] She's always gets a commended for tap and modern.
               [13305] That's what Tracey said.
               [13306] Emma gets away with it but Lisa doesn't.
Lee (PS04W)    [13307] Taken all my medicine now. [...]

Brenda (PS04U) [13337] Don't chew that sweater please.
Carla (PS04X)  [13338] Mm.

               [13348] That, Tracey knows, why, who, who's got picked to help
               teaching.
               [13349] They haven't.
               [13350] ... Have they?
               [13351] ... It's you the one that's been picked.
               [13352] [cough] God, is that short or what? ...
Carla (PS04X)  [13353] Bends over. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [13354] [laughing] If she bends over [] .
Lee (PS04W)    [13355] I've got [...] know that I'm going to do both the maths
               [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [13356] [cough] Eh?
Lee (PS04W)    [13357] at high level and general level.
Brenda (PS04U) [13358] On what?
Lee (PS04W)    [13359] [...] advised me ... revision [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [13360] Yeah.
Lee (PS04W)    [13361] So I'm going through all of them doing all the
               exercises.
Brenda (PS04U) [13362] Both levels?
               [13363] What just in case they put you down on maths.
Lee (PS04W)    [13364] Well I'm only gonna get ... erm half of the general
               level book done by my marks ... for maths.
               [13365] ... Gone through two chapters tonight.
Brenda (PS04U) [13366] Did he say anything about, anything about the geography?
               [13367] James?
Lee (PS04W)    [13368] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [13369] And what about the french? ...
Lee (PS04W)    [13370] What about it?
Brenda (PS04U) [13371] And you not had no revision for that?
Lee (PS04W)    [13372] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [13373] You ought to, you can help each other on that.
               [13374] [...] her talk it.
               [13375] She had a conversation with Jean the other day.
Carla (PS04X)  [13376] What?
Brenda (PS04U) [13377] [...] french, didn't you?
               [13378] ... Jean loved it because, mind you she forgot a lot of
               the words didn't she?
               [13379] ... But then she seemed in the end ... she she picked it
               up.
               [13380] ... But she was as , we were quite surprised [...] how
               much she could say.
               [13381] What was that one asking if you'd got an animal? ...
Carla (PS04X)  [13382] [...] asking. [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [13383] Do you hear her?
*** 99 (Tape 015914) ***
Lee (PS04W)    [13384] And I'll tell you ... he says I'm not telling you what
               to do.
               [13385] ... It's entirely ... your decision.
Brenda (PS04U) [13386] Do you wanna swap round and have that little one?
Lee (PS04W)    [13387] Pass me the butter please?
Brenda (PS04U) [13388] [...] big one.
Lee (PS04W)    [13389] This one?
Brenda (PS04U) [13390] Yeah.
               [13391] ... Should have [...]
Lee (PS04W)    [13392] Thanks.
Brenda (PS04U) [13393] Any phone calls today?
Lee (PS04W)    [13394] No.
               [13395] None whatsoever.
Dave (PS04V)   [13396] Right bear in mind ... you are getting over a cold.
Lee (PS04W)    [13397] Yeah.
Dave (PS04V)   [13398] Getting over a cold, right?
Lee (PS04W)    [13399] Mhm.
Dave (PS04V)   [13400] And you've been far from very well.
               [13401] And ... you are going to be going skiing January the
               fourth which is not many days away.
               [13402] ... Right?
               [13403] ... Now [...] my opinion if any [...] ... I would say
               don't sleep round James's house for one.
               [13404] Right?
               [13405] For the simple reason ... that you won't go to bed till
               ... late in the morning or whatever which would knock you back.
               [13406] Right?
Lee (PS04W)    [13407] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [13408] The other one is ... phone Pete up and tell him that
               you've been off sick for a week ... can't play football this
               week.
               [13409] Right?
               [13410] Then next week, have the weekend off.
               [13411] Still go out.
               [13412] Don't stay in, I'm not saying stay indoors, you can
               still go out ... and next week get yourself ... you decide in
               yourself to do your own ... training.
               [13413] Go to football training by all means.
Lee (PS04W)    [13414] But how can I cos I've got
Brenda (PS04U) [13415] Exams every day.
Lee (PS04W)    [13416] Yeah.
               [13417] School work.
Dave (PS04V)   [13418] But I've got work every day.
               [13419] But I still come home and do it.
               [13420] I don't wanna do it.
               [13421] ... It's if you want to do something.
               [13422] I'm I'm I'm ... it's like I said to you I'm not telling
               you to do it.
               [13423] But I tell you something now ... when you go skiing on
               January the fourth ... I've never skied but I can assure you
               this ... James I know for a fact is going to special lessons.
               [13424] ... Now if you're not fit and you're just getting over a
               cold now so there's no way your fit ... you're gonna be ... well
               an absolute disaster out there.
               [13425] ... And yet I tell you what and if you go and play
               football on Sunday and you're not a hundred percent fit from
               this cold ... you've lost all next week as well.
               [13426] But er I mean that's, that's your decision.
               [13427] I was ... you're old enough to [...] ... I'm just [...]
               .
               [13428] ... Whether it's a hard match or what it's up to you.
Brenda (PS04U) [13429] It is isn't it? [...] ...
Dave (PS04V)   [13430] Tell me something then.
               [13431] If it, if it was a ... [...] match on a Tuesday this
               week, would you have played?
Lee (PS04W)    [13432] No. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [13433] So all I'm saying is try and get rid of the whole ...
               not ... your tablets will finish up about Saturday or Sunday.
Brenda (PS04U) [13434] Tomorrow. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [13435] Get, and I mean like I said to you today you've still
               got your cough.
               [13436] So is it gonna do you any good really? ...
Lee (PS04W)    [13437] No.
Dave (PS04V)   [13438] Alright it's gonna upset Pete.
               [13439] And you probably ain't gonna wanna leave your friends
               standing around on a football field.
               [13440] I'm not trying to, don't get me wrong I'm not trying to
               say pack this in and do that.
               [13441] All I want to see you better ... back to school and back
               to your fitness again.
               [13442] ... [...] I'm not being a ... you do as I say dad.
               [13443] It's up to you mate.
               [13444] If you think that you, if you feel that you're alright
               to do it, by all means do it.
               [13445] And you can say well look I told you so dad.
               [13446] ... If you've still got that cough and that it's just
Brenda (PS04U) [13447] Do you think you'll be fit enough, you're fit enough to
               play Lee?
Lee (PS04W)    [13448] No.
               [13449] I know for a fact I'm not cos all I've done all week is
               sit on my bum and watch telly and eat a lot.
Brenda (PS04U) [13450] But by Sunday do you think you will be?
Dave (PS04V)   [13451] But [...] training [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [13452] Yeah.
               [13453] How can I get myself fit for Sunday?
               [13454] ... You can't, it's like if I went out swimming and that
               on Saturday ... or even to ride.
               [13455] Couple of swimming lessons ain't gonna get me fit for
               Sunday.
Dave (PS04V)   [13456] It's not the football that I'm worried about.
               [13457] It's the skiing.
Lee (PS04W)    [13458] No but I'm saying ... I'm not gonna be able to run
               around for eighty minutes ... being [...] .
               [13459] Alright I'll get through it ... I won't be running about
               as much as what I usually do.
Dave (PS04V)   [13460] And next week you'll be off again. ...
Lee (PS04W)    [13461] Possibly, yeah.
Dave (PS04V)   [13462] You're doing Pete no favours.
               [13463] Cos Pete [...] putting out a good, alright ... Pete
               might say [...] ... if say [...] you, you just rung up to say
               look Pete I'm sorry [...] .
               [13464] He won't tell the players and he'll say alright I
               haven't got a team so he can cancel the match.
Brenda (PS04U) [13465] I'd give him a ring tonight Lee and get, then he might
               have time to ge chance to get some players.
               [13466] Will they?
Dave (PS04V)   [13467] You've gotta get your ... think [...] but if you don't
               get yourself right you're gonna be in a right two and eight.
Brenda (PS04U) [13468] The difference last week [...] sit down [...] getting up
               to go to Blackbushe.
               [13469] Then standing out on that football pitch.
               [13470] ... Didn't do us a lot of good did it?
Lee (PS04W)    [13471] No. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [13472] The other thing we've gotta find out about is er ...
               while we're on the subject ... is what insurance has he got for
               skiing?
               [13473] ... Not taking the fact that he's gonna have an injury
               or anything but I'm just saying in case something does happen.
               ...
Brenda (PS04U) [13474] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [13475] If he could speak to Gill
Brenda (PS04U) [13476] Mm.
Dave (PS04V)   [13477] to find out from her ... if it comes to it we can
               perhaps ask the old lady ... if she can set something up where
               ...
Brenda (PS04U) [13478] I know what we've gotta do this week, or next week.
Lee (PS04W)    [13479] What?
Brenda (PS04U) [13480] Your passport.
Dave (PS04V)   [13481] Yeah that's ... yeah.
Brenda (PS04U) [13482] Otherwise you're not gonna get it done.
Lee (PS04W)    [13483] Thought it was already done.
Brenda (PS04U) [13484] Eh?
Lee (PS04W)    [13485] I said I thought it was already done and the form was
               sent away.
Brenda (PS04U) [13486] We can't, you've gotta go and do it in person.
               [13487] We can't get it.
               [13488] You've gotta be there and sign [...] .
               [13489] At a local post office.
               [13490] ... I'll phone Pete up tonight and ... tell him.
               [13491] I don't think he will be well enough.
Dave (PS04V)   [13492] I, I'd love to see him play football.
               [13493] But he'd be a complete idiot to do it.
               [13494] ... He's doing Pete no favours.
               [13495] He's doing himself no favours.
               [13496] Next week, get him ... like I said to you Lee, you've
               got to train ... doesn't matter, it's no good having me
Brenda (PS04U) [13497] He might put, cos I mean Craig's out isn't he?
               [13498] He's banned now till February.
               [13499] So he's got to try and get some other players hasn't he?
               ...
Lee (PS04W)    [13500] No he'd have enough players.
Brenda (PS04U) [13501] Who?
               [13502] How many?
Lee (PS04W)    [13503] Well he's got Stevie hasn't he?
               [13504] He plays and [...] .
Brenda (PS04U) [13505] He'll play those two instead of you and Craig. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [13506] See the weekend out on your tablets.
               [13507] And when your back to school ... get back and do it in a
               serious way.
               [13508] It's only for three weeks till you get your skiing over
               with.
               [13509] Then you drop back into your usual slot but I tell you
               what if you go skiing and your not hundred percent fit or as fit
               as you can be ... from what I've, what I've read about it and
               that your gonna be in a right two and eight out there.
Brenda (PS04U) [13510] [...] usual things.
Lee (PS04W)    [...]
Brenda (PS04U) [13511] [...] other ones.
               [13512] ... It's like James, if you imagine ... what time do you
               have to get up this morning?
               [13513] Quarter to two?
Lee (PS04W)    [13514] [...] what?
Brenda (PS04U) [13515] Your tablet.
Lee (PS04W)    [13516] Oh I was awake at quarter to two.
Dave (PS04V)   [13517] You won't be going to bed till three o'clock round
               James's house.
Lee (PS04W)    [13518] We will though.
               [13519] We did last time, we were in bed by half ten, no eleven.
Dave (PS04V)   [13520] [...] twelve.
               [13521] ... Only I've heard it all before.
               [13522] Anyhow I, I saw to you I'm not, I don't care what you
               do.
               [13523] You can go and play football.
Brenda (PS04U) [13524] And what was you going to sleep round there for then?
Lee (PS04W)    [13525] Probably gonna spend a night revising.
               [13526] ... Cos we're, we're not gonna do much revision
               Saturday, alright Saturday night maybe.
               [13527] But Saturday during the day ... we'll probably be out.
               [13528] ... All we're gonna do is just revise maths.
               [13529] Maths and physics.
               [13530] ... Cos we both wanna do well in them.
               [13531] ... But I need his help more in maths.
               [13532] Alright I can revise still in maths ... but ... it's not
               the same cos when he was round here the other night he's like
               ... in a way like the teacher.
Brenda (PS04U) [cough]
Lee (PS04W)    [13533] He seems to know what he's doing on everything.
               [13534] Even if I loo look back over my work and I still can't
               understand it ... he'll explain it. ...
Brenda (PS04U) [13535] Well see how you feel.
               [13536] If you, I mean if you're only going round there and
               you're gonna go to bed at a reasonable hour.
Lee (PS04W)    [13537] Well I'll see how I am tomorrow.
               [13538] I'm not saying anything.
Brenda (PS04U) [13539] As long as you're not going up the village
Lee (PS04W)    [13540] No.
Brenda (PS04U) [13541] and hanging around the street cos then that will
Lee (PS04W)    [13542] I know.
Brenda (PS04U) [13543] We'll have to try and get this suit organized.
Dave (PS04V)   [13544] Mm.
Brenda (PS04U) [13545] What about you're, you don't, no I suppose you don't
               feel like, will you be too tired to ... take him down tomorrow
               when you finish? ...
Lee (PS04W)    [13546] No cos that'll muck his keep fit up and that then.
Brenda (PS04U) [13547] [cough] Couldn't he do his keep fit first?
Lee (PS04W)    [13548] Why don't you go
Brenda (PS04U) [13549] And then you could go for a swim over, go and do his
               suit and you could have a swim at Guildford. ...
Dave (PS04V)   [13550] [...] bring him back then.
               [13551] He don't wanna go swimming.
Brenda (PS04U) [13552] Why?
Dave (PS04V)   [13553] Well cos he's got a cold now! ...
Lee (PS04W)    [13554] Yeah I was gonna say we could pick it up
Brenda (PS04U) [13555] He can go in a cafe.
Lee (PS04W)    [13556] in the morning.
               [13557] ... Are you going to Guildford tomorrow in the lorry?
               ...
Dave (PS04V)   [13558] You gotta go in.
               [13559] You gotta try that suit on.
Lee (PS04W)    [13560] Yeah I know.
Brenda (PS04U) [cough]
Lee (PS04W)    [13561] See how you feel tomorrow.
               [13562] If you feel [...] I'll

               [13564] ... Well if not you can come with me Saturday look.
               [13565] If you sleep round James's I'll be going about half past
               nine
Lee (PS04W)    [13566] It's alright
