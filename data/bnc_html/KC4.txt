             gravy.
             [37] You just have those in a big bowl of gravy.
None (PS1E6) [38] Ugh.

             people come in and have a bowl of sort of soup, and, well I
             suppose it's gravy in there.
             [43] And I tried it one night, it was very yummy and very filling.
             [44] ... Oh my god I don't like doing this.
None (PS1E9) [45] Pardon?
None (PS1E8) [46] And I don't like this weather.
Fred (PS1E4) [47] [laugh] Neither do I.

None (PS1E8) [49] Sometimes it's colder indoors than out actually, isn't it?
None (PS1E9) [50] It's gone on, well it is if the sun's out, and you know if
             the sun's out.

Fred (PS1E4) [54] Oh yes they are, I've got all [...] [laugh]
None (PS1E8) [55] Well move up a bit this way Fred if you don't mind.

None (PS1E9) [66] Well who the hell put an empty horseradish pot back in the
             cupboard?
None (PS1E7) [67] Do you have [...] ?
None (PS1E8) [68] [...] John.
None (PS1E7) [69] [...] Lovely.
None (PS1E8) [70] There's really no horseradish?
             [71] I found three empty jars.
             [72] Oh dear.
Fred (PS1E4) [73] Well I thought I'd put horseradish on the ... whatsit one
             week.

None (PS1E7) [91] Yes please Anna.
None (PS1EA) [92] The special touch, you might say [...] .
None (PS1E8) [93] [laugh] Are these the ones you put in when we went out?
None (PS1E7) [94] Yes.
             [95] They really ought to have got moved down to the bottom.
None (PS1E8) [96] I find it's very difficult in these ovens to, you know a
             normal oven you could sort of put things to the bottom that you've
             already done .
None (PS1E7) [97] Yes.
             [98] Well you can [...]
None (PS1E8) [99] Well you can't these, can you?
None (PS1E7) [100] you can in mine cos mine's, mine's [...]
None (PS1E8) [101] Yes but then you still have heat coming from the [...] and
             the top, top and the bottom don't you?
None (PS1E7) [102] Yes, yes you do.
None (PS1EA) [103] Then you've got the top's a grill as well so that
None (PS1E8) [104] Yes.
None (PS1EA) [105] you can get two places that are hot, and on top it's
             absolutely
None (PS1E8) [106] No, you take that out.
             [107] I take my grill out.
None (PS1EA) [108] Do you?
None (PS1E8) [109] Yes, if I'm not using the grill I take it out.
None (PS1E7) [110] It would take a long time to get our grill out because I
             don't think it would move any more. ...
None (PS1E6) [111] Can somebody pass me the new potatoes please? ... [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [112] Hang on I'll move this one.
None (PS1E8) [113] Oh my god.

None (PS1E8) [124] Oh I don't mind.
             [125] As they come.
             [126] ... Thank you.
Fred (PS1E4) [127] Do you only want one?
None (PS1E8) [128] Erm ... yes.
None (PS1EA) [129] Did you find another horseradish thing, did you?
             [130] Erm a paper top one.
Fred (PS1E4) [131] Oh, I give it, is that horseradish?
             [132] Oh yes.
             [133] Yes, that's in there John.
None (PS1E7) [134] They're all virtually empty.
             [135] I mean
Fred (PS1E4) [136] I'll, I'll, I'll have some er
None (PS1EA) [137] Thank you.

None (PS1E6) [148] Mum.
None (PS1E8) [149] Gosh, this beef is tender.
Fred (PS1E4) [150] Erm
None (PS1EA) [151] Cheers.
Fred (PS1E4) [152] Cheers everybody.
None (PS1E8) [153] Cheers John. [eating]
None (PS1E7) [154] The only problem is it's only worth buying if you're buying
             a reasonable sized piece.
None (PS1E8) [155] Mm.
None (PS1E7) [156] Can't really buy a small piece.
None (PS1E8) [157] Is this the same as a wing rib?
             [158] Or is that something different?
None (PS1E7) [159] Well I'd call it fore rib.
             [160] Then you've got little ribs after that.
             [161] Start with big.
None (PS1E8) [162] Do you have it, erm sort of boned?
None (PS1E7) [163] No.
None (PS1E8) [164] Not at all?
None (PS1E7) [165] Well I used to [...] this was two ribs [...] .
             [166] That's what fore rib's the small one.
             [167] ... The other rib, of beef I mean, to get a piece that's
             worth ... cooking cos to carve it and everything else you need at
             least three ribs and the ribs are sort of usually it's about that
             sort of size
None (PS1E8) [168] Mm
None (PS1E7) [169] and you're talking about a piece at least about eight,
             seventeen, eighteen pounds.
None (PS1E6) [170] Who did the gravy?
Fred (PS1E4) [171] Mm?
None (PS1E6) [172] There's so much fat in the gravy.
Fred (PS1E4) [173] [laugh] Lovely. ... [...]
*** 4 (Tape 006404) ***
None (PS1EA) [174] Yes this beef's come out very well hasn't it?
             [175] It's very tender.
None (PS1E8) [176] Mm.
None (PS1E9) [177] Yes, very nice.
None (PS1E8) [178] Delicious.
None (PS1EA) [179] It's not maybe as rare as you ought to have it but it ...
             really tastes nice.
             [180] ... With disasters and all it's come out reasonably well at
             the end of the day.
None (PS1E9) [181] Did it have a disaster?
None (PS1E6) [182] Yes dad.
None (PS1E7) [183] [...] Oh.
             [184] It's lovely.
             [185] Well you've created something rather nice out of your
             disaster then. ...
None (PS1E9) [186] The cornflour packet didn't have much left in it.
None (PS1E8) [laugh]
None (PS1E6) [187] The gravy's a disaster.
             [188] It's got too much fat in it.
Fred (PS1E4) [189] I didn't think it had got enough.
None (PS1E7) [190] Well I never put salt and pepper in my gravy so ...
None (PS1E8) [191] If you use cornflour ...
None (PS1E7) [192] I use cornflour and two Oxo's.
None (PS1E8) [193] Do you?
None (PS1E7) [194] Yeah.
             [195] That's what I normally use.
None (PS1E8) [196] Yeah.
None (PS1E7) [197] If I'm then doing things, if I'm doing beef gravy I put the
             beef stock cube, and either one or two Oxo's to [...]
None (PS1E8) [198] Oh.
None (PS1E7) [199] of cornflour.
             [200] And then add all the juices from the meat.
             [201] But I don't add anything else.
None (PS1EA) [202] [...] gravy we're having today.
None (PS1E7) [203] No.
None (PS1EA) [204] This is totally different.
None (PS1E7) [205] I never put salt and pepper in my gravy, I never have done.
None (PS1E9) [206] No.
             [207] That's what I like, like about mum's gravy.
None (PS1E7) [208] But I always add all the juices from the meat.
             [209] Out of the meat tin and ...
None (PS1E9) [210] How did you do this gravy then dad?
None (PS1E6) [211] With difficulty.
             [212] No, you've got Bovril, you've got, erm, Oxo's. [...] some
             garlic and pepper and some cornflour and then your mother had to
             lob in some, something else.
             [213] Because we'd run out of cornflour and it was all not thick
             enough.
None (PS1E9) [214] [...] lob in?
None (PS1E6) [...]
None (PS1E9) [215] Your use of the English language in front of the microphone
             is extremely
Fred (PS1E4) [216] What are you talking about?
None (PS1E6) [217] It's lucky I don't talk to a microphone very often.
None (PS1E9) [218] [...] a microphone over there, dad, and it's turned on.
None (PS1E6) [219] Oh no.
Fred (PS1E4) [220] Nobody'll know who's speaking.
None (PS1E9) [221] No, well.
             [222] But they will now.
Fred (PS1E4) [223] So I don't think it matters.
None (PS1E9) [224] They'll [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [225] [...] they don't know who your dad is.
None (PS1E9) [226] They do.
Fred (PS1E4) [227] They don't. [...]
None (PS1E9) [228] They know whose household this is.
Fred (PS1E4) [229] They don't.
None (PS1E9) [230] They know this is the household.
None (PS1E7) [231] They will now. [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [232] They don't.
             [233] It's under my name.
None (PS1E9) [234] They do now.
Fred (PS1E4) [235] No, it's under my name.
None (PS1E9) [236] Yeah, but they do now that it's the household. [laugh]
Fred (PS1E4) [237] [...] .
             [238] Ha.
None (PS1E9) [239] Can I have some more Yorkshire puddings please, daddy?
None (PS1E6) [240] Half a one or so I suppose.
None (PS1E8) [241] Very nice Yorkshires John.
None (PS1E6) [242] Did you do them?
None (PS1EA) [243] Well Alex mixed the mix, I put them in the oven and Sue told
             me get them out or they'll burn.
             [244] So it was a sort of a three way erm
None (PS1E6) [245] Oh I see yeah.
None (PS1EA) [246] thing really.
None (PS1E7) [247] They were only burning because you put in what was written
             on the packet.
None (PS1EA) [248] Well what's written on the packet is correct unless you have
             the grill not exactly red hot but about three eighty five.
             [249] Twenty five minutes isn't a bad time [...]
None (PS1E7) [250] Oh I never cook them for twenty, twenty to twenty five
             minutes it would be a disaster.
None (PS1EA) [251] Oh well.
None (PS1E6) [252] Nor've I. [...]
None (PS1E8) [253] I was going to say, do you cook Alexander?
None (PS1E6) [254] Yeah.

None (PS1E7) [273] And mushrooms.
None (PS1E6) [274] And mushrooms.
None (PS1E7) [275] Was there anything else?
             [276] We didn't do rice.
None (PS1E6) [277] We were going to do rice but there was [...]
None (PS1E7) [278] Stir fry veg.
None (PS1E6) [279] Yeah, stir fry veg.
None (PS1E9) [280] What, did you do all this did you?
None (PS1E6) [281] Well, me and mum.
None (PS1E7) [282] No, [...] operation.
None (PS1E6) [283] I did most of the preparation, Mum looked after what was
             cooking.
None (PS1E8) [284] [...] . ...
None (PS1E7) [285] It's the preparation that takes so long in Chinese cooking.
None (PS1E8) [286] Mm.
None (PS1E9) [287] Well there's so many different bits to it isn't there?
             [288] That's the trouble.
None (PS1E7) [289] When I do a Chinese meal
None (PS1E6) [290] It's just having everything there.
None (PS1E7) [291] Yeah.
None (PS1E6) [292] There's so many bits of sauce and
None (PS1E7) [293] I spent about two hours measuring out all the different
             things.
             [294] Then I put labels on about every single pot I could find
             that's got all these various mixes in.
             [295] And I've got sort of like ... sweet and sour with prawns
             sort of ... er raising mix for something else.
             [296] Oh gosh.
None (PS1E6) [297] That's what I don't like with Chinese, erm, everything's so
             complicated.
             [298] So what you do is
None (PS1E7) [299] It's part of the cooking.
None (PS1E6) [300] yeah.
             [301] You just ... shove everything in a pan.
None (PS1E8) [302] Do you go out to restaurants for a Chinese meal
None (PS1E6) [303] That's what, you know when I did that er [...] Chinese
             bolognese thing.
None (PS1E7) [304] what?
None (PS1E8) [305] at all?
None (PS1EA) [306] We used to, [...] .
None (PS1E6) [307] Do you remember when I did that Chinese bolognese thing?
             [308] I made half of that up.
None (PS1E7) [309] Mm.
None (PS1E6) [310] But I got the main thing off a, [...] off a TV programme.
             [311] But I couldn't get, I didn't get it all down.
None (PS1E7) [312] So you made up the rest?
None (PS1E6) [313] So I made up the rest and everyone liked it.
None (PS1EA) [314] You actually need a bigger kitchen to cook Chinese.
None (PS1E6) [315] Yeah.
             [316] Because you need to set everything out.
             [317] Like I did, when I did it I just ... [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [...]
None (PS1E6) [318] put it back ... well I put it back [...] , got that, put a
             bit of that in.
             [319] Put a bit of everything in apart from the vegetables which I
             knew what to put in.
None (PS1E8) [320] I don't think you'd like me doing that Alex?
             [321] You complain as it is about the number of dishes I use.
None (PS1E9) [322] Mm.
None (PS1E8) [323] I could imagine if I did Chinese
None (PS1E6) [324] I don't use that many dishes when I do Chinese.
             [325] I don't [...] .
             [326] I just put little drops [...] .

None (PS1EA) [330] Same argument in this household.
None (PS1E6) [331] Well I can use one bowl, but I don't I use two.
None (PS1EA) [332] Never use five bowls if one will do.
None (PS1E6) [333] When it's like pancake mix I tend, or omelettes I tend to
             use two bowls and even though I only really need to use one.
None (PS1E8) [334] Well that's silly.
             [335] Why do you do that?
None (PS1E6) [...] ...
None (PS1E9) [336] Where is [...] then?

None (PS1E7) [578] You know instead of tipping it over which would probably
             help I'd put that
Fred (PS1E4) [579] put that on top and put the two over together.
None (PS1E7) [580] Well done.
Fred (PS1E4) [581] There.
None (PS1E8) [582] Now you've got a problem. [banging]
Fred (PS1E4) [583] Hit it with a spoon.
             [584] Not hard enough to break the dish [...]
None (PS1E8) [585] Yes I do think you need to ... why don't you just try
             dishing it up out of the thing? [...]
None (PS1E8) [586] You're never going to get that out.
None (PS1E7) [587] Yes I am.
             [588] ... All you've got to do is get rid of the air.
             [589] Like that.
None (PS1E8) [590] Ah. [everyone claps]
Fred (PS1E4) [591] Oh clever dick, oh the clever trousers.
             [592] Very good.
             [593] ... Creme caramel and custard. [whistling]
None (PS1E7) [594] I've never used that before.
None (PS1E8) [laugh]
Fred (PS1E4) [595] You've had it for a few years too. ...
None (PS1E7) [596] Well that's one.
None (PS1E6) [597] Would everybody like lumpy custard?
None (PS1E7) [598] You're not supposed to make lumpy custard.
             [599] You make very very good custard normally.
None (PS1EA) [600] No.
             [601] Custard with no lumps.
Fred (PS1E4) [602] You've made lumpy custard you can eat it.
None (PS1E6) [603] O K.
             [604] ... I don't know what happened.
             [605] [...] lumpy custard.
Fred (PS1E4) [606] Oh sorry.
None (PS1E6) [607] [...] made lumpy custard.
             [608] I thought everybody liked it.
             [609] I know dad does [...] .
None (PS1E9) [...]
None (PS1E7) [610] No, I'm just putting some [...] so if it all ends up thrown
             away
None (PS1E8) [611] Oh Sue that is dreadful.
None (PS1E7) [612] I know.
Fred (PS1E4) [613] It won't get thrown away.
None (PS1E8) [614] That is dreadful.
None (PS1E7) [615] [...] get thrown away [...] always ends up getting thrown
             away.
Fred (PS1E4) [616] No it doesn't.
             [617] I'll eat it.
None (PS1E7) [618] It goes in the fridge for about four days.
Fred (PS1E4) [619] No it doesn't I jack it out sometimes.
None (PS1EA) [620] I throw it away straight away these days.
None (PS1E8) [621] Oh John that is such a terrible waste.
None (PS1EA) [622] Well what, what are you going to do with it?
             [623] It's making too much to start with.
None (PS1E9) [624] Make cauliflower cheese with that.
None (PS1E8) [625] Precisely.
Fred (PS1E4) [626] I'll make myself some cauliflower cheese tomorrow morning.
None (PS1E8) [627] Why don't you just cut it all up and put a curry sauce over
             it?
             [628] And have curried vegetables.
             [629] Delicious.
Fred (PS1E4) [630] I'll have cauliflower cheese tomorrow er lunchtime.
             [631] With the cauliflower.
None (PS1E9) [632] The rest you can fry up in the evening and have it with your
             cold beef.
None (PS1E6) [...]
None (PS1E8) [633] Exactly.
None (PS1E6) [634] I did .
             [635] It's hard to pour out.
None (PS1EA) [636] Yeah.
None (PS1E8) [637] That is dreadful.
             [638] I mean they're all usable.
None (PS1E6) [639] Can somebody pass me a towel please?
None (PS1EA) [640] Well what happened [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [641] Yes but you see when you get out of here about ... seven
             times between half past six and eight o'clock at night [laugh]
None (PS1E8) [642] Well you ha at least haven't got to do vegetables have you?
             [643] I mean they're already done for you.
             [644] Just reheat those and you're off and away.
             [645] ... I like to have a lot of vegetables left over.
             [646] I can have them fried the next day.
None (PS1E6) [...]
None (PS1EA) [647] What will we do with it?
None (PS1E6) [648] Apart from me.
None (PS1EA) [649] Er. [...] .
Fred (PS1E4) [650] Well generally there's, there's only three of us here [...]
             [too much banging]
None (PS1E9) [651] There's your custard lad.
None (PS1E7) [652] Oh lumpy!
None (PS1E6) [653] It's not.
None (PS1E8) [654] You said so.
None (PS1E6) [655] No.
             [656] I said does anybody like it.
None (PS1E8) [657] Oh.
None (PS1E6) [658] Did I actually say the words does anybody [...]
None (PS1E8) [659] You said
None (PS1E6) [660] I ... I said does anybody like lumpy custard.
None (PS1E8) [661] That's right.
None (PS1E6) [662] Does that mean that I've made lumpy custard?
None (PS1E8) [663] Yes.
None (PS1E6) [664] Why?
None (PS1E8) [665] Well because lumpy
None (PS1E6) [666] Did I actually say I [...] ?
None (PS1E8) [667] Well no you didn't actually say [...] [laugh] but one would
             presume from that that that's what you were getting.
Fred (PS1E4) [668] What you should have said is I hope everybody likes lumpy
             custard. [laugh]
None (PS1E7) [669] Well the trouble with making it in a jar is you don't get
             much skin do you?
             [670] If you put it in a basin then you can sort of
Fred (PS1E4) [671] Yeah but the sk skin's thicker.
None (PS1E8) [672] Well yeah that's true.
None (PS1E9) [...]
None (PS1E8) [673] Mm.
None (PS1E9) [674] [...] custard, oh look lumps.
None (PS1E7) [675] Very true.
None (PS1E9) [676] We're deprived these days.
None (PS1EA) [677] Eh?
None (PS1E7) [...]
None (PS1E6) [678] Pardon?
None (PS1E7) [679] [...] .
             [680] Cold bread pudding.
None (PS1E6) [681] Yeah.
             [682] It's nice.
None (PS1EA) [683] Can you eat it hot?
None (PS1E6) [684] [...] mum's done it in a sweater then it [...]
None (PS1E7) [685] Should have slipped it in the erm in the oven.
None (PS1EA) [686] You nearly said the microwave didn't you?
None (PS1E7) [687] I nearly said the microwave, but in the oven. [laugh]
None (PS1EA) [688] The other thing's behind [...] next to the erm scales.
None (PS1E6) [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [689] Er how did you manage to get two sides of that so perfectly
             straight?
None (PS1E7) [690] Well I'll get the cream out.
None (PS1E9) [...]
None (PS1E8) [691] What that?
             [692] Oh yes it was in [...] thing.
             [693] I'll divide it up between three of us.
None (PS1EA) [694] [...] other erm thing, whatever it is.
None (PS1E6) [695] Thing?
Fred (PS1E4) [696] Oh it's your bread pudding, I see.
None (PS1E8) [697] Yeah.
             [698] I made one yesterday in a meat tin and so Lynn had a lump
             and I got a lump and you here.
None (PS1E7) [699] Would anybody like some of this?
None (PS1EA) [700] We've got four, four puddings here aren't there? [...]
None (PS1E8) [701] What is it?
None (PS1E7) [702] Baked jam roll [...] .
             [703] Mincemeat.
             [704] [...] burnt it.
             [705] Sorry.
None (PS1E8) [706] No, no, no, crispy, crunchy.
None (PS1E7) [707] Who'd like what?
None (PS1E6) [708] Me please.
Fred (PS1E4) [709] I'd like a piece of Gran's thing to start with.
             [710] ... I'll have some of that.
None (PS1E8) [711] Well that's not fair Alexander is it?
             [712] Your mother said who wants what.
             [713] Alexander said ... and Fred got served first.
Fred (PS1E4) [714] Well, I'm sorry.
None (PS1E7) [715] Oh sorry, yes.
Fred (PS1E4) [716] She was trying to get rid of this that's why. [laugh]
None (PS1E8) [717] Young people have got to stand up for their rights
             Alexander.
None (PS1E6) [718] It's my favourite.
None (PS1E7) [719] I didn't get the cream.
None (PS1E6) [720] Oh yeah I'll get the cream.
None (PS1E8) [721] I mean I read according to the paper this morning young
             people have got to have a
None (PS1E9) [722] [...] elders and betters and all that.
None (PS1E8) [723] That's true. ...
None (PS1E7) [724] Young people have got to what?
None (PS1E8) [725] Stand up to their, have a say.
             [726] You've got to listen.
None (PS1E6) [727] Yeah.
             [728] Nobody listens to the young ...
Fred (PS1E4) [729] Well why not?
None (PS1E9) [730] Ah
None (PS1E7) [731] Ah, since when does nobody listen to you?
None (PS1E6) [732] At school they don't anyway.
None (PS1E7) [733] Ah
None (PS1EA) [734] Since when did they ever?
None (PS1E8) [735] I'll have a piece of that please.
None (PS1E6) [736] What do you mean?
             [737] ... Nobody will want custard [...]
None (PS1E7) [738] Nobody wants custard.
             [739] You even you're not having custard.
None (PS1E6) [740] I know but but [...] eat custard with meringue.
None (PS1E7) [741] Why not?
None (PS1E6) [742] It makes the meringue go all weird. [...]
None (PS1E6) [743] Does anybody want custard?
None (PS1E7) [744] John do you want this?
None (PS1EA) [745] No I'll have some of that please.
None (PS1E9) [746] I'll have some of that too please.
None (PS1E6) [747] I'll have some of nan's bread pudding I think. [...] .
None (PS1E8) [748] Take that back to school.
None (PS1E9) [749] [...] ought to do is to eat the things that he's saying that
             nobody wants.
None (PS1E8) [750] I think they are actually.
             [751] They're just trying to prove you
None (PS1E7) [752] What are you going to have nan?
None (PS1E8) [753] I'm going to have some cream please.
Fred (PS1E4) [754] Ah [...]
None (PS1E6) [755] [...] I'll take it to school.
None (PS1E8) [756] [...] tart.
             [757] You've got treacle bites.
None (PS1E7) [758] They don't have a lot of that there.
None (PS1E9) [759] [...] bread pudding as well.
None (PS1E6) [...]

None (PS1E7) [761] You didn't want [...] .
Fred (PS1E4) [762] Who wants the custard?

None (PS1E6) [764] Don't you want custard granddad?
Fred (PS1E4) [765] Yes I'm having custard. [...] .
None (PS1E7) [766] Ah.
             [767] The skin's gone.
             [768] Fred!
Fred (PS1E4) [769] No [...]
None (PS1E7) [laugh]
Fred (PS1E4) [770] John [...] .
             [771] Alec?
             [772] Custard?
None (PS1E9) [773] No thank you.
             [774] Oh dear
None (PS1E8) [775] Oh.
             [776] [laugh] Oh shame.
Fred (PS1E4) [777] No it's alright, that's alright.
None (PS1E9) [778] I'll save you the rest
None (PS1E8) [779] Fred's been looking
Fred (PS1E4) [780] I don't, no I haven't , I don't worry about it.
             [781] It's alright.
None (PS1E9) [782] I'll save the rest of it for you.
Fred (PS1E4) [783] Thank you Alec.
             [784] ... [...] out there.
None (PS1E8) [785] [...] long time.
Fred (PS1E4) [786] Must be like that [...] .
None (PS1E9) [787] No I've come to the conclusion that we're deprived these
             days.
             [788] We don't have any sweets much.
None (PS1EA) [789] But you're always having sweets.
None (PS1E9) [790] No.
             [791] When people ... come but otherwise we're deprived.
None (PS1E8) [792] Have a banana after [...] .
None (PS1E9) [793] [...] a banana.
None (PS1E7) [794] There was me thinking that you always [...] .
None (PS1E8) [795] Well it depends.
             [796] I think [...]
None (PS1E6) [797] We had this really nice Danish apple bar that I did last
             night.
None (PS1E8) [798] In the where?
None (PS1E6) [799] A Danish apple bar.
None (PS1E8) [800] Oh really?
None (PS1E6) [801] Mm.
Fred (PS1E4) [802] Who said this was burnt?
             [803] ... The pastry is a little crispy but ...
None (PS1E9) [804] Very nice.
Fred (PS1E4) [805] Yes very nice. ...
None (PS1E6) [806] Bottom of the meringue is [...] .
None (PS1E8) [807] Do you make many jellies?
             [808] I haven't had a jelly for ages and I got one from
             Sainsbury's.
             [809] A lemon jelly.
             [810] And I actually did it in a plastic basin.
             [811] And it has stained it so badly.
             [812] And I think well what do they put in this type of thing and
             it really wasn't that good was it?
None (PS1E9) [813] The basin or the jelly?
None (PS1E8) [814] Both.
             [815] I, I thought.
             [816] I don't know the things you eat with that much colouring in
             it erm [...]
None (PS1EA) [...]
None (PS1E8) [817] No, John [...]
None (PS1E6) [818] But she's done my [...]
None (PS1EA) [819] [...] jelly bowl.
None (PS1E8) [820] No, it wasn't a proper jelly bowl.
None (PS1E6) [821] [...] jelly bowl or my jelly bowl [...] .
None (PS1E8) [822] That's another thing you can't get now is ... very much is
             chocolate blancmange.
None (PS1E6) [823] We've got some.
None (PS1E8) [824] Well you can't in Sainsbury's.
None (PS1E6) [825] Yes we have.
None (PS1E7) [826] Not chocolate one we've not.
None (PS1E6) [827] Yes we have we've got some chocolate ones.
None (PS1E7) [828] Have we?
None (PS1E6) [829] Yes.
             [830] ... How do you make [...] then?
None (PS1E7) [831] That's chocolate and erm, you melt the chocolate and an
             orange jelly.
*** 6 (Tape 006406) ***
Fred (PS1E4) [832] Some blinking thing they're, they're needing for a er
             accents ... you know
None (PS1E6) [833] School custard's really weird.
None (PS1E8) [834] But we haven't [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [835] You know.
             [836] Some research project.
None (PS1E6) [837] Some sort of weird gross lumpy custard, very nice.
None (PS1E8) [838] Are you, I mean
None (PS1EA) [839] [...] the erm
None (PS1E8) [840] We, we haven't got accents as such have we?
None (PS1E9) [841] No.
None (PS1E8) [842] Oh, well we have but it's a London [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [843] I don't think you well [...] a month now, I mean cotton is a
             natural [...] .
None (PS1E8) [844] Yeah that's right but I mean we're just a south east London
Fred (PS1E4) [845] I don't think [...]
None (PS1E8) [846] sort of accent.
Fred (PS1E4) [847] Well I, I would call it south London.
None (PS1E7) [848] I would.
None (PS1E8) [849] Well alright then.
Fred (PS1E4) [850] Anyway, call it south London.
             [851] It's certainly not a north London accent.
None (PS1E8) [852] The north London accent is exactly the same I used to live
             there for years.
Fred (PS1E4) [853] Did you?
             [854] Oh.
None (PS1E8) [855] Yeah.
Fred (PS1E4) [...]
None (PS1E8) [856] Oh, yeah.
Fred (PS1E4) [857] Well I lived in north east London.
None (PS1E8) [858] Well it depends where you're, where you're going [...] .
None (PS1E7) [859] [...] in Scotland [...]
None (PS1E8) [860] Oh [...] to Scotland.
None (PS1E7) [861] Now there are treacle bites.
None (PS1E6) [862] I'll [...] home. [...] ...
None (PS1EA) [863] What's that treacle thing that we got from you the other
             day?
             [864] That had to be kept in the fridge [...] .
None (PS1E8) [865] I don't think so.
             [866] It was a toffee tart?
None (PS1EA) [867] Whatever it was.
None (PS1E8) [868] Why?
None (PS1EA) [869] I just wondered whether it was
None (PS1E8) [...]
None (PS1E6) [870] Yes.
None (PS1EA) [...]
None (PS1E8) [871] What John?
None (PS1EA) [872] It was in the fridge and the dog.
None (PS1E7) [873] The fridge and the dog?
None (PS1E8) [874] Was it that popular?
None (PS1EA) [875] It was, it was very nice except that Fred had a piece and
             left the last couple of slices in the tin on the side and the dog
             took a shine to it so it was in a tin and then in the dog.
None (PS1E6) [876] [...] you can't blame the dog for that.
None (PS1EA) [877] Well as far as I'm concerned it was the dog ... [...] on the
             side.
None (PS1E8) [878] Treacle pie was beautiful.
None (PS1E6) [879] Was it?
None (PS1E8) [880] Mm.
             [881] Very good.
             [882] ... I don't know why I don't eat it more often.
None (PS1E6) [...]
None (PS1EA) [883] [...] custard. [...]
None (PS1E6) [884] Nothing.
None (PS1E8) [885] [...] custard?
None (PS1E6) [886] No.
None (PS1E9) [887] [...] caramel ... it was sort of sludge.
             [888] Dirty brown sludge.
None (PS1E8) [laugh]
None (PS1E7) [889] He used to do that to me at Sunday lunchtime.
             [890] He used to sit and say all sorts of terrible things.
             [891] [...] eat their dinner.
             [892] I mean, he'd put his elbows on the table because we had the
             kitchen table [...] .
None (PS1EA) [laugh]
None (PS1E9) [893] [...] look at your father.
None (PS1E6) [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [894] Sue.
             [895] I will have a little piece of that lemon pie.
             [896] I'll have a very small piece.
             [897] That's it.
None (PS1E6) [898] [...] .
             [899] Cos we, at lunchtime we have trays and we have six to a
             table, we have three up the side and one on the end.
             [900] And sometimes it's pretty hard to get the one on the end in
             because they've, you've got jugs and things, and so you're pushing
             them all up.
             [901] We couldn't get him and he had about this much off.
             [902] And he came and he had a massive full plate of rice and
             curry and then he had custard and gooseberry pie sort of thing.
             [903] And he came in and sat down and put his elbows on the edge
             of his tray and it all went [laugh] whack over his blazer and it
             all slid down onto his trousers.
             [904] And I was sitting up, up, say this is the head of the table
             I was sitting where mum is.
             [905] And I saw it and everybody in the whole room saw it and
             burst out laughing cos it was so funny.
Fred (PS1E4) [906] Who was he?
             [907] That did it.
None (PS1E6) [908] Well just sat down.
None (PS1E7) [909] What a nice guy.
None (PS1E9) [910] [...] make a speech.
None (PS1E7) [911] Mm.
             [912] William's on drums.
None (PS1E8) [913] On drums?
None (PS1E6) [914] Mm.
None (PS1E8) [...]
None (PS1E6) [915] Yes.
None (PS1E8) [916] What he's going to be a drummer?
None (PS1E7) [917] You don't have to go to Caterham school to become a drummer.
None (PS1E7) [918] Do you see that [...] father with long hair and
None (PS1E6) [919] Yeah.
None (PS1E8) [920] Guitar.
None (PS1E9) [921] What is he then?
None (PS1E7) [922] I should think he's in the group, isn't he?
None (PS1E6) [923] Who?
             [924] Oh no, no, Philip's father, no.
None (PS1E7) [925] Well perhaps he [...]
None (PS1E9) [926] He looks like one of the you know
None (PS1E7) [927] Who was the man that gave the speech?
None (PS1E6) [928] Philip .
             [929] The one with blond hair.
None (PS1E7) [930] Yes.
None (PS1E6) [931] Philip .
None (PS1E7) [932] Right.
             [933] Well now his father
None (PS1E6) [934] His old man is, has got long blond hair but he's bald on top
None (PS1E7) [935] That's it, yeah.
None (PS1E6) [936] and he wears erm sort of grey cowboy boots.
None (PS1E7) [937] [...] .
             [938] Baggy clothes.
             [939] And he's got a silver guitar on his lapel
None (PS1E6) [940] Yeah.
             [941] But he's not a musician.
             [942] He's a
None (PS1E9) [943] I always thought he was a jazz [...]
None (PS1E6) [944] No he does, he does erm, er oh forgotten what you call it
             now.
             [945] He designs ... buildings and windows and things.
             [946] [...] An architect.
None (PS1E6) [947] Well, he's a sort of architect.
None (PS1E7) [948] A quantity surveyor?
None (PS1E6) [949] Yeah.
             [950] He doesn't design buildings
None (PS1E9) [951] But he designs windows.
None (PS1E6) [952] He designs certain bits on buildings like arches, and
             windows and things like that.
None (PS1E7) [953] He's got a very nice vehicle.
             [954] It's like erm a Range Rover isn't it?
None (PS1E6) [955] Yeah.
None (PS1E7) [956] Big.
             [957] Great big thing.
None (PS1E9) [958] Shogun sort of thing.
None (PS1E7) [959] So we sat there and we decided he was obviously a musician.
             [laugh]
None (PS1E6) [960] He likes music but he's not a musician.
None (PS1E7) [961] He looks like and I, first of all when we saw him I thought
             who the hell is that, can't be a father cos look at him, he looks
             terrible.
Fred (PS1E4) [laugh]
None (PS1E9) [...]
None (PS1E6) [962] [...] he looks terrible
None (PS1E8) [963] Did he come to the ball?
             [964] Did he come to the ball Sue?
None (PS1E6) [965] [...] should have seen [...] dad.
             [966] Did you see the one who kept running up and down in the
             weird hat?
             [967] Taking photos.
Fred (PS1E4) [968] Well that's his, that's his tribal [...] .
None (PS1E6) [969] Yes, didn't you see him?
None (PS1E7) [970] Oh what [...] yes. [...]
None (PS1E9) [...]
None (PS1E8) [971] Yes.
Fred (PS1E4) [972] He, he is a head of them, he head of the tribe.
None (PS1E6) [973] One of the main tribes of [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [974] They don't call them [...] they call them tribes or whatever
             it is [...] .
None (PS1E6) [975] [...] is French?
None (PS1E7) [976] Is it?
Fred (PS1E4) [977] And he er, well he's probably [...] French.
None (PS1E6) [978] You see his dad is basically a king.
Fred (PS1E4) [979] A ki king, that's right.
None (PS1E6) [980] A king, a kingdom, so Richard's really a prince.
None (PS1E7) [981] Oh.
None (PS1EA) [982] Doesn't mean that [...] father of his is a queen does it?
             [983] Runs up and down screaming and jumping up and down.
None (PS1E8) [984] Well when did you see her?
None (PS1EA) [985] Oh she goes to [...] matches. [...]
None (PS1EA) [986] It's an embarrassment.
             [987] You sort of creep into a corner and hope she doesn't see
             you.
None (PS1E7) [988] [...] really nice.
None (PS1EA) [989] She's alright to say hello to but then
None (PS1E7) [990] One of the nicest mums there is.
None (PS1E6) [991] Yes she is.
None (PS1EA) [992] Well she's alright.
Fred (PS1E4) [993] I think she is too Alex.
None (PS1EA) [994] You don't actually want to stand next to her though do you?
None (PS1E6) [995] She is.
             [996] When I was playing rugby and I hurt my thumb she actually
             lent me a very expensive Jaeger coat to keep me warm.
             [997] [laugh] She did and I got mud all over it [...] .
None (PS1EA) [998] [...] you can't stand any too much she's always on the move.
None (PS1E6) [999] She's nice.
             [1000] She comes to all the, all the [...] football.
None (PS1EA) [1001] Yes, she is, she's very nice but you don't actually want
             to, if you're on the, the touchline you don't want to stand next
             to her.
None (PS1E6) [1002] Why?
None (PS1EA) [1003] Well she's jumping up and down, she's screaming and
             laughing and shouting at people and hollering oh.
Fred (PS1E4) [1004] That, that's what she goes there for.
None (PS1E6) [1005] I think the worst thing is when their team [...] at
             matches.
             [1006] They were losing and she knew they were going to lose and
             their last bloke was coming in and she was cheering them on.
             [1007] [laugh] She was cheering them on.
Fred (PS1E4) [1008] Ah we, we, her and I cheered on who, who, who couldn't
             score, he never, they never got a score. [...]
None (PS1E6) [1009] Oh was that Trinity?
Fred (PS1E4) [1010] No, it wasn't Trinity, no.
             [1011] It was [...] yeah they'd come quite a long way actually.
None (PS1E6) [1012] Oh yeah, hang on, I can't think who they are but they came
             all the way [...] .
             [1013] And we're all going out on the field going come on, very
             good, we're gonna beat your team, and we got our man and we scored
             about seven tries in the first three minutes.
Fred (PS1E4) [1014] Oh not, hardly, not quite.
None (PS1E8) [1015] It's a very rough game Alexander.
None (PS1E9) [1016] Oh Alex's got some [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1017] [...] twenty seconds.
None (PS1E9) [1018] telling you the rules.
             [1019] Tell daddy what they're changing.
None (PS1E6) [1020] Oh they're going to change the rules that erm, you know
             there's two scrumhalfs start on their side of the scrum, well they
             can't come round to the other side.
             [1021] Cos you know you've got
None (PS1EA) [1022] Yeah.
None (PS1E6) [1023] in the centre of the scrum you've half [...] and you've got
None (PS1EA) [1024] So as long as you're behind the ball you can keep moving
None (PS1E6) [1025] No.
None (PS1EA) [1026] Well you, that's what you can do at the moment.
None (PS1E6) [1027] Yeah but the new rules for our age group is you have half
             of the scrum and then you have the scrumhalf and he puts the ball
             in and he goes back to his side doesn't he?
             [1028] And the other scrumhalf [...] and normally the other
             scrumhalf will come round and tackle him.
             [1029] Or push him off the ball or something
None (PS1EA) [1030] Yes.
             [1031] As long as he stays, stays behind the ball then he's
             allowed to do that.
None (PS1E6) [1032] Well they're not allowed to, they're not allowed to yeah
             but they're not allowed to do that any more.
None (PS1EA) [1033] He can't, so he can't come
None (PS1E6) [1034] No.
             [1035] And he can't, you can't do twist [...] any more.
Fred (PS1E4) [1036] Can't you?
None (PS1E6) [1037] No.
             [1038] The number eight can't pick it up.
Fred (PS1E4) [1039] Oh.
None (PS1E6) [1040] And erm I can't remember what the other one is.
Fred (PS1E4) [...]
None (PS1E6) [1041] [...] Oh you can't push more than one point four metres or
             something or other.
None (PS1E7) [1042] Oh my god!
             [1043] Do you take a tape measure with you?
None (PS1E6) [1044] No but, so if you [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [...]
None (PS1E7) [...]
None (PS1EA) [1045] [...] five minute scrum you can't push over
None (PS1E6) [1046] You can't push [...] .
None (PS1EA) [1047] That's silly isn't it?
None (PS1E6) [1048] [...] yeah.
             [1049] The reason is you've got to take [...]
None (PS1E7) [1050] [...] take out all the extra sort of strain
None (PS1E6) [1051] All of the extra strain on the [...]
None (PS1EA) [1052] I suppose the trouble is yeah if you do push, if you do go
             for that the other side [...] cos you just sort of push them into
             the [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1053] What about when you
None (PS1E6) [1054] Yeah!
None (PS1EA) [1055] in a big mangled heap.
Fred (PS1E4) [1056] what about when you, what about when you make [...]
None (PS1E6) [1057] [...] the first row.
             [1058] Oh as soon as, as soon as you, about over fifteens er is
             normal rules.
             [1059] This is all under fifteen.
             [1060] The good thing about being in the scrum is when you push
             over and they all collapse and you fall on top of them.
             [1061] Or you stand there and you walk over them.
None (PS1E8) [1062] Do they get as much pleasure about walking over you?
None (PS1E6) [1063] No cos I normally hit back. [laugh]
None (PS1E9) [1064] What was this [...] ?
None (PS1E6) [1065] Tighthead prop.
None (PS1E9) [1066] Who?
None (PS1E6) [1067] Tighthead prop.
None (PS1E8) [1068] I think that's [...] tighthead prop.
None (PS1E9) [1069] Prop forward.
None (PS1E6) [1070] That's what it's called.
None (PS1E7) [...]
None (PS1E8) [laugh]
None (PS1E7) [1071] I don't know much about rugby.
None (PS1E6) [1072] Better than golf.
None (PS1E9) [1073] [...] four ... five days really.
None (PS1E6) [1074] It's better than golf.
None (PS1E8) [1075] Don't you like golf?
None (PS1E6) [1076] No, boring.
None (PS1E7) [1077] Golf?
None (PS1E6) [1078] Yeah.
             [1079] [...] golf
None (PS1E8) [1080] Why do you say boring?
None (PS1E6) [1081] I dunno. [laugh]
None (PS1E7) [1082] Golf is [...]
None (PS1E8) [1083] Have you actually played it?
None (PS1E6) [1084] Yes.
             [1085] Lots. [laugh]
Fred (PS1E4) [1086] What golf?
None (PS1E6) [1087] Not ... I'm not very good at it.
             [1088] [laugh] Boring.
None (PS1E8) [1089] [laugh] Oh I see, as you're no good at it, it's boring.
None (PS1E6) [1090] No, cos it's, you just watch somebody smack a ball as hard
             as they can with the one wood and see how far it goes.
None (PS1E8) [1091] But you've got an objective, you've got to get it down a
             hole [...] .
None (PS1E6) [1092] Yeah, put it in a hole.
None (PS1E8) [1093] Well yes I know but [...]
None (PS1E6) [1094] That's easy!
None (PS1E8) [1095] [...] look at the money they make, golfers.
None (PS1E6) [1096] Yeah look at the money skateboarders make.
             [1097] [laugh] Do you know how much, do you know how much the
             world champion earns in one year?
None (PS1E8) [1098] No.
None (PS1E6) [1099] He will earn something like seven million dollars.
None (PS1E8) [1100] What, for skateboarding?
None (PS1E6) [1101] Yes he does.
             [1102] You ought to see his house.
Fred (PS1E4) [1103] This is America is it?
None (PS1E6) [1104] He's got wooden hall, wooden lounge
None (PS1E7) [1105] Doesn't allow any pedestrians.
None (PS1E6) [1106] No pedestrians, no cars.
             [1107] Erm he's got three videos
None (PS1E7) [1108] He skateboards all the way from the house [...]
None (PS1E6) [1109] he's got portable video TV little thing like er like the
             Sony ones on Virgin.
             [1110] He's got three TV's, computer ... video cameras,
             everything.
None (PS1E7) [1111] He's got his own skateboard ramp in his back garden and he
             video tapes what he does so that he can watch what he's doing
             wrong and all the rest of it.
None (PS1E6) [1112] And he's got [...] these twenty nine twenty eight
None (PS1E8) [1113] How ridiculous.
             [1114] On a skateboard.
None (PS1E6) [1115] Why's it ridiculous?
None (PS1E8) [1116] What's so wonderful about skateboarding?
None (PS1E7) [1117] Well because he's very skilled.
             [1118] No I accept now that it's, it's extremely skilful.
None (PS1E6) [1119] It's very skilful.
None (PS1E7) [1120] It's just as skilful as most other sports.
             [1121] Just as skilful as skiing, and, and er ice skating though
             it's not [...] phenomenal about [...] sports
None (PS1E6) [1122] It's just, you're just thinking that if there's anybody who
             skateboards just skates and like really ragged clothes because
             you're not exactly gonna go out wearing a suit skateboarding cos
             as soon as you fall off you you're gonna rip it to shreds aren't
             you?
None (PS1E8) [1123] True.
             [1124] I cannot see ... skateboarding being sports.
None (PS1E6) [1125] It's in the next Olympics.
Fred (PS1E4) [1126] Oh yeah.
             [1127] [...] they do it on these er ... they must be [...] you
             know
None (PS1E6) [1128] It's gonna be in the next Olympics.
             [1129] For speed, skating, slalom and round.
             [1130] And street style.
             [1131] Are all gonna be in the next Olympics.
Fred (PS1E4) [1132] As much a sport as you could call erm
None (PS1E8) [1133] Well I dare say but it's far more dignified to play golf
             [...] .
Fred (PS1E4) [1134] Oh what do you, you know erm [...] that sort of thing.
None (PS1E6) [1135] Why's it far more dignified?
             [1136] They're just stuck up normally.
None (PS1E8) [1137] No they're not.
None (PS1E6) [1138] Load of stuck up
None (PS1E8) [1139] To play golf erm ... it's really quite [...]
None (PS1E6) [1140] Have I got to play golf?
Fred (PS1E4) [1141] Well golf is, is hardly a sport, it's not in the, it's not
             like it's in the Olympics is it?
None (PS1E9) [1142] No.
Fred (PS1E4) [1143] No, it's a sport, but I mean it's erm ... Well to most
             people it's a pastime isn't it?
None (PS1E6) [1144] Yeah.
Fred (PS1E4) [1145] Pastime for ordinary golfers.
None (PS1E7) [1146] What there's Nick Faldo, makes a lot of money at it anyway.
Fred (PS1E4) [1147] Oh well, it's a sport for him, yes.
             [1148] But I say for most ... ordinary people who play it, it's a
             pastime.
None (PS1E8) [1149] It's not easy hitting that little ball you know.
None (PS1E6) [1150] Yes it is.
None (PS1E8) [1151] It is not.
None (PS1E6) [1152] It is.
None (PS1E8) [1153] It is not.
None (PS1E6) [1154] It is.
None (PS1E8) [1155] It is not.
None (PS1E6) [1156] It is, it is.
             [1157] I can even slice it and I've only played golf once.
Fred (PS1E4) [1158] Oh I don't know.
             [1159] If you've got, if you've got
None (PS1E6) [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1160] a good eye there's nothing hard in hitting the ball.
             [1161] It's if it goes where you want it to that's hard.
None (PS1E8) [1162] Precisely.
             [1163] Precisely.
None (PS1E6) [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1164] Well that applies to any, any sport, any kind of sport.
None (PS1E6) [1165] Apart from cricket where you just smack it as hard as you
             can.
None (PS1E7) [1166] I, I, I think there's an art to that as well.
None (PS1E6) [1167] Yeah there is.
             [1168] I can play it, sort of.
Fred (PS1E4) [1169] I dunno, cricket, cricket
None (PS1E6) [1170] I can bowl, I'm quite a bowler.
Fred (PS1E4) [1171] cricket is [...]
None (PS1E6) [1172] I'm extremely fast armed.
             [1173] Not very accurate.
             [1174] [laugh] Well I, I can't, I don't bowl them out I have to
             bowl them about that far away from the wickets [...] .
             [1175] So I get, if I get them on target I normally get a couple
             of wickets.
None (PS1E8) [1176] Mm.
None (PS1E6) [1177] Cos I'm really fast.
             [1178] Or I get an L B.
None (PS1E7) [1179] Well he is at javelin, and what was the other thing he was
             throwing, the discus?
Fred (PS1E4) [1180] Discus.
None (PS1E6) [1181] No.
             [1182] It's shot.
Fred (PS1E4) [1183] No, no, no the shot.
None (PS1E6) [1184] I don't like shot.
None (PS1E7) [1185] Oh the shot .
             [1186] Are you still doing that?
None (PS1E6) [1187] No.
Fred (PS1E4) [1188] Putting the shot.
None (PS1E7) [1189] You were good.
None (PS1E6) [1190] No.
None (PS1E7) [1191] Didn't you come second in that?
None (PS1E6) [1192] Yeah but I was just got out of it, not very good at it.
None (PS1E7) [1193] Now I can't see any sense in throwing ... whatsit, the
             javelin.
             [1194] Now honestly
None (PS1E9) [1195] We were just saying you ought to be good at that.
None (PS1E6) [1196] Well I am.
None (PS1E9) [...]
None (PS1E6) [1197] [...] spear broke, you throw it at the ground.
Fred (PS1E4) [1198] You don't you throw it at animals to kill them.
None (PS1E6) [1199] Yeah but basically downwards all the time.
             [1200] Why can't you see the point in throwing a javelin?
None (PS1E7) [1201] No I can't see much sport in that.
None (PS1E9) [1202] I can't see you do it this year.
None (PS1E6) [1203] Why not?
Fred (PS1E4) [1204] Well I think it's a lot, there's a lot of ...
None (PS1E7) [1205] What is it that, you know, it doesn't achieve anything does
             it?
Fred (PS1E4) [1206] Well of course it does.
             [1207] It, it achieves just as much as softly doing hop skip and a
             jump.
             [1208] What's the difference?
None (PS1E6) [1209] It, it achieves the same as somebody, somebody putting a
             ball in a hole with, with as least hits as he can.
Fred (PS1E4) [1210] It achieves, it achieves as much as some, as somebody
             throwing a hammer.
             [1211] Or a shot.
None (PS1E8) [1212] Oh yeah.
Fred (PS1E4) [1213] Or jumping, jumping over an eight foot fence.
None (PS1E8) [1214] Yes.
None (PS1E7) [1215] Well they're not, erm ... [...] are they?
Fred (PS1E4) [1216] Can't tell the difference.
None (PS1E8) [1217] I know, they're all the same.
             [1218] You wrap all those, all that lot up in one sort of, you
             know [...] .
Fred (PS1E4) [1219] Well I think it's very interesting.
             [1220] It it it it takes a lot of doing.
None (PS1E6) [1221] Yeah it does.
             [1222] It's got a lot of skill in it actually.
Fred (PS1E4) [1223] There's a lot of skill in it.
             [1224] There's a lot of skill in javelin throwing.
None (PS1E6) [1225] It is.
             [1226] There's more skill in that than there is the discus.
Fred (PS1E4) [1227] There is.
None (PS1E6) [1228] Discus
Fred (PS1E4) [1229] Might just as well
None (PS1EA) [1230] [...] make a good [...] as well. [laugh]
None (PS1E6) [1231] Yes.
Fred (PS1E4) [1232] There's a lot of skill in discus sonny, don't you forget
             it.
None (PS1E6) [1233] Oh yeah there is actually.
             [1234] Oh shot put's probably the easiest to do.
Fred (PS1E4) [1235] Shot put is more, is more
None (PS1E6) [1236] Brute force.
Fred (PS1E4) [1237] Brute force.
None (PS1E6) [1238] Whereas javelin is a lot of skill [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1239] I mean the hammer, the hammer is [...]
None (PS1E7) [1240] Surely javelin is brute force as well?
None (PS1E6) [1241] Yeah but it's got to spill and spin right.
None (PS1E7) [1242] It isn't brute, isn't javelin the same, it's brute force.
None (PS1E6) [1243] No.
             [1244] Because however, however much brute force you put in, it's
             how you put through the javelin.
Fred (PS1E4) [1245] It's how you put it through [...]
None (PS1E6) [1246] If you [...] it as far as far as you can you've got to,
             when you throw javelin you've got to bring your arm through right,
             you've got to twist, you've got to make sure your wrist's tight
             ... you've got to keep your erm left foot planted.
Fred (PS1E4) [...]
None (PS1E6) [1247] You've got to, oh you've just to keep it straight.
             [1248] It's very hard.
Fred (PS1E4) [1249] Very, very [...] .
None (PS1E7) [1250] Alright then, alright then.
Fred (PS1E4) [1251] You see you don't just, you don't just go [...] like this
None (PS1E8) [1252] [...] technique in in playing golf.
None (PS1E6) [1253] Yeah, there is a technique.
None (PS1E8) [1254] That's alright then.
None (PS1E6) [1255] Golf [...] technique extremely easy.
Fred (PS1E4) [1256] Yes but surely Alexander you're, you're only saying that er
             ... you don't er, the more you [...] golf.
None (PS1E6) [1257] Yeah I know but.
             [1258] I know that's all I said.
Fred (PS1E4) [1259] I mean, the, you don't get many ... You do get youngsters
             as young as you they do, they do, by, by the time
None (PS1E6) [1260] Yeah but it's no [...] .
None (PS1E8) [1261] Well they start, it it's the same way that er very young
             people er start playing snooker don't they?
None (PS1E6) [1262] Well I play snooker.
None (PS1E8) [1263] Time they get to about sixteen or seventeen you know they
             can be up in the top players.
             [1264] ... You certainly make money if you begin [...] .
None (PS1E9) [1265] Young people play bowls these days too.
None (PS1E8) [1266] [laugh] They don't make much money at it though [...] .
None (PS1E9) [1267] No, no.
             [1268] Bowls is a sport that they don't make much money.
None (PS1EA) [1269] [...] money I think it's the sport that counts.
None (PS1E8) [1270] I know but I mean [...]
None (PS1E6) [1271] Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose , it's how you play
             the game.
None (PS1E8) [1272] Oh dear. [laugh]
None (PS1EA) [1273] They make a few quid don't they at bowls?
None (PS1E6) [1274] Well they do [...] cheat or not. [...]
None (PS1E8) [1275] No [...]
None (PS1EA) [1276] [...] guys at the top [...] what is it Tony Al Tony Alcock.
None (PS1E9) [1277] Tony Alcock.
             [1278] But they don't win [...] .
None (PS1E8) [1279] Oh you cruel thing.
None (PS1E6) [1280] Cruel?
             [1281] [...] . It's a very rough sport.
None (PS1E9) [1282] What is?
None (PS1E8) [1283] I know it is.
None (PS1E6) [1284] Rugby.
None (PS1E8) [1285] I don't know why you play it.
None (PS1E6) [1286] Cos I like hitting people.
             [1287] ... I like hitting my balls ugh.
None (PS1E8) [1288] [...] streak in you.
None (PS1E8) [1289] Yeah well I take after my mum.
None (PS1E8) [1290] Do you.
             [1291] Do you have er young boys at your school?
             [1292] Do they have to do all your bidding and fetching and
             carrying and things?
None (PS1E6) [1293] No.
             [1294] They used to but they don't any more they've taken all that
             sort of brilliant stuff away.
             [1295] But they did that to me when I was their age and now as
             soon as I get to fourteen when when you can, when you can, when
             you could do that ... And now today ... it's not fair.
None (PS1E8) [1296] Mm.
None (PS1E9) [1297] [...] . ...
None (PS1E6) [1298] [...] . ...
None (PS1E8) [1299] No it's probably ... right that you don't bully the
             youngsters.
None (PS1E6) [1300] Well, they did it to me.
None (PS1E8) [1301] Yes, but you didn't like it did you?
None (PS1E6) [1302] [...] .
             [1303] N n .
             [1304] But they did it to everybody, it happened to everybody.
None (PS1E9) [1305] [...] .
             [1306] Except when you get there and they stop it.
None (PS1E6) [1307] Yeah we're not even allowed to report them any more.
             [1308] Put them on the landing.
             [1309] ... No because it's just oh no you'll get them all cold.
None (PS1E8) [1310] Where you ever put on the landing?
None (PS1E6) [1311] Mhm.
None (PS1E7) [1312] Often. [laugh]
Fred (PS1E4) [1313] What for?
None (PS1E6) [1314] Hitting people normally.
None (PS1EA) [1315] Hitting people?
None (PS1E6) [1316] Yeah with my pillows.
             [1317] We had pillow fights.
             [1318] Bed slipper fights.
Fred (PS1E4) [1319] Well you weren't the only one out on the landing then?
None (PS1E6) [1320] No everybody was.
Fred (PS1E4) [1321] There was probably more of you on the landing than there
             was [laugh]
None (PS1E6) [1322] There wasn't.
             [1323] But one night we tried to get the whole entire floor out on
             the landing.
             [1324] Well some of us swapped and the Gammas didn't want to do
             it.
             [1325] All the Alpha Betas and most of the Gammas were out on the
             landing and they ran out of room.
             [1326] And so they started putting people downstairs ...
             everywhere and shoving them in corners that nobody even [...] .
None (PS1E8) [1327] Are you sorry that your Mr 's leaving?
None (PS1E6) [1328] No.
             [1329] Well I am a little bit.
None (PS1E8) [1330] Oh.
             [1331] Was he nice to you, all you boys?
None (PS1E6) [1332] Well he, [...] , well, you know but just because he's
             leaving he he seems to think that he's got to upturn the, upturn
             the, upturn the term.
             [1333] And everything has gone to pot.
None (PS1E7) [1334] I'm very surprised at that.
None (PS1E6) [1335] Everything thing's gone all weird and nobody knows what's
             happening.
             [1336] They've changed all the things that used to be just because
             they know ... Like form twos always used to have an end of term
             leaving party.
             [1337] But now they're not just so all the people can have one
             because Mr and Mrs are leaving.
None (PS1E7) [1338] Oh well.
None (PS1E6) [1339] It was the form twos, the only thing that I, that they had
             to, they had to look forward to in the whole time they were there.
             [1340] And I've been there since Alpha and I every year I've
             looked out and watched the form twos.
             [1341] And now suddenly just as soon as I come to form twos
             they've taken that away.
None (PS1E8) [1342] What you're in form two now?
None (PS1E6) [1343] Yeah.
             [1344] They've taken all the privileges away.
None (PS1E8) [1345] Ah.
             [1346] Is it only a temporary?
None (PS1E6) [1347] No.
             [1348] We don't know.
             [1349] We don't have any [...] teachers [...] for about eighteen
             months.
             [1350] [laugh] He does look like one.
             [1351] Have you seen him?
None (PS1E7) [1352] No.
Fred (PS1E4) [1353] Has he got a long brown habit on?
None (PS1E6) [1354] No but he's got hair like one.
             [1355] He looks
None (PS1E8) [1356] Yeah but you won't be in, you [...] Alexander, will it?
Fred (PS1E4) [...]
None (PS1E6) [1357] I know it's good.
             [1358] No.
None (PS1E8) [1359] After, after er you break up in the summer?
None (PS1E6) [1360] Yeah I know that's good.
None (PS1E8) [1361] So next year form two can have their party?
             [1362] Ask if you can join them.
None (PS1E6) [1363] No.
             [1364] Wouldn't want to mix with that bunch anyway.
None (PS1E8) [1365] But you are one of them now.
None (PS1E6) [1366] What, one of the form ones?
None (PS1E8) [1367] Yeah I thought you were a form two?
None (PS1E6) [1368] Yeah but
None (PS1E7) [1369] Well what are the form ones like?
None (PS1E8) [1370] Oh I see form ones will be form two next year.
             [1371] Right.
None (PS1E6) [1372] [...] load of rabble.
None (PS1E9) [1373] Well, they're the same as you were last year aren't they?
None (PS1E6) [1374] Well yeah I know.
             [1375] But that's how the form twos thought of us last year as
             well [...] [laugh] load of rabble.
None (PS1E9) [1376] Yes.
None (PS1E7) [1377] That one year can make such a difference can't it?
None (PS1E9) [1378] [...] school he'll be [...] .
None (PS1E8) [1379] Oh you're gonna be the rabble again, aren't you?
None (PS1E6) [1380] I know, cool.
             [1381] I like being the rabble cos you never have any
             responsibilities.
             [1382] If you're form two they always look to you to, I mean we
             can't do our thing by ourselves but soon as something needs done,
             doing they look to us.
None (PS1E9) [1383] Well there you are you're the responsible lot aren't you?
None (PS1E6) [1384] I know but we can't do, we can't do anything apart from be
             told what to do by the teachers.
             [1385] We can't tell people what to do.
None (PS1E8) [1386] Well that's right.
             [1387] You shouldn't have to.
None (PS1E6) [1388] We're not allowed to wreak punishment apart from when our
             floor
None (PS1E8) [1389] That I believe is right too, why should you?
None (PS1E6) [1390] Why, because we were at, in Alpha and Beta and Gamma and
             form one we were always admitted punishment by form twos.
             [1391] Whatever they felt like they sort of
None (PS1E7) [1392] They've never had people like barks or tells [...] .
None (PS1E6) [1393] No they're called [...]
None (PS1EA) [1394] [...] alright isn't he?
None (PS1E6) [1395] Yeah I know but he admitted a lot of punishments.
None (PS1EA) [1396] Did he?
None (PS1E6) [1397] Yes.
None (PS1E7) [1398] I don't think your mum would like you sticking that [...] .
Fred (PS1E4) [1399] I was gonna say if you keep doing that you'll be getting
             some [...] .

             finishes the washing up?
None (PS1E8) [1405] Oh it's not fair that he did some [...]
None (PS1EA) [1406] [...] did all the serious bits.
None (PS1E7) [1407] You made the gravy.
None (PS1EA) [1408] Well the rest [...] .
None (PS1E7) [1409] He didn't touch any of the rest of it.
None (PS1E8) [1410] What's up with your dishwasher? [...]
None (PS1E7) [1411] It is, it is but what's there is just saucepans and things.
             [1412] ... Well, come on we'll go and sit in the other room.

             [1473] I think probably he organizes [...] .
             [1474] Coaching school and
None (PS1E9) [1475] Oh yes.
Fred (PS1E4) [1476] they, they don't play much.

Fred (PS1E4) [...]
None (PS1E9) [1484] I don't follow rugby to that extent.
Fred (PS1E4) [1485] No. [...]
*** 8 (Tape 006408) ***
None (PS1E9) [1486] That school like, Alexander goes to I mean it's a good
             place to go to isn't it?
             [1487] If you can afford to send your kids there.
             [1488] ... I would say there was more going on, going for them
             isn't there than
Fred (PS1E4) [1489] Oh yes, yes.
None (PS1E9) [1490] than the old comprehensive schools.
             [1491] Some are better than others of course but er
Fred (PS1E4) [1492] I think that a big advantage if you wanting to get in very
             large areas like London and Birmingham.
             [1493] I think that if the schools, I don't suppose that [...]
             kind of thing but erm, I mean the schools out in Surrey and all
             erm places like that.
             [1494] When you get down there [...] they're much ... much better
             than
None (PS1E9) [1495] Oh yes.
             [1496] I mean we have a local school, Hayes School which is a very
             good comprehensive
Fred (PS1E4) [1497] Mm.
             [1498] All the comprehensives.
None (PS1E9) [1499] and everybody
Fred (PS1E4) [1500] But I don't think parts of Croydon, south of Croydon,
             Birmingham [...] they're much better down there.
None (PS1E9) [1501] I mean people move in to Hayes specially so that their kids
             can go there.
Fred (PS1E4) [1502] Yes.
             [1503] ... I think generally speaking you erm schools out in the
             country are better.
None (PS1E9) [1504] Oh yes.
             [1505] Mm
Fred (PS1E4) [1506] Cos then you [...]
None (PS1E9) [1507] It's O K if your headmasters that run the school change I
             mean schools tend to change with headmasters don't they? ...
Fred (PS1E4) [1508] Cos it'd be, I mean a big disadvantage to a lot of
             particular schools around this area is the number of erm Asian and
None (PS1E9) [1509] Yes.
Fred (PS1E4) [1510] erm Indian.
             [1511] I mean, they, they probably don't speak English and they're
             at at a disadvantage to start off with.
None (PS1E9) [1512] Yes.
Fred (PS1E4) [1513] Which again is holding the others back.
None (PS1E9) [1514] Yes, yes.
             [1515] ... [...] changing headmasters at his school and they had a
             terrible reputation one time.
Fred (PS1E4) [1516] Did it?
None (PS1E9) [...]
None (PS1E6) [1517] [...] Sorry.
Fred (PS1E4) [1518] [...] your black rucksack?
None (PS1E6) [1519] My black [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1520] The one that was in, in the other room?
None (PS1E6) [1521] Yeah.
Fred (PS1E4) [1522] Well I put it in the hall
None (PS1E6) [1523] Yeah.
Fred (PS1E4) [1524] behind the hall stand but mummy must have shifted it cos,
             shifted it with that er that bag of hers so I should ask mummy
             where it is.
             [1525] Cos it was, I put it behind the hall stand.
None (PS1E6) [1526] O K.
None (PS1E9) [1527] But they had a new headmaster oh he's just retired, he's
             been there ... been there since Lynn was there when ... since she
             was ... since the er she's twice that age so I mean he must have
             been there eighteen years but when he went there he's er totally
             [...] the school from the word go
None (PS1E6) [1528] No, I got, I need to get some stuff out of the red one.
None (PS1E9) [1529] and it changed out of all recognition.
             [1530] Now it's one of the, the best schools ... for miles around.
Fred (PS1E4) [1531] Is he er ... is he due to retire or
None (PS1E9) [1532] Ye yes he's just retired.
Fred (PS1E4) [1533] He has just retired?
None (PS1E9) [1534] There's been a new headmaster for the last year I think so
             I don't know what he [...]
None (PS1E7) [1535] Bath now [...]
None (PS1E6) [1536] What did you say?
None (PS1E7) [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1537] Well you might find as he's got a good, good disciplined
             school he'll ... Unless of course he's of the opposite [...]
None (PS1E9) [1538] Well yes [...]
None (PS1E7) [...]
Fred (PS1E4) [1539] have any discipline [...] do as they like.
None (PS1E9) [1540] Mm.

Fred (PS1E4) [1542] Mm.
             [1543] I think that they should actually.
None (PS1E9) [1544] Yes.
             [1545] ... Except the sixth form, they can
Fred (PS1E4) [1546] Well no, well, well of course Alexander's school see ...
             next year he er ... he's gotta wear ... black and you know a black
             suit.

Fred (PS1E4) [1552] No no, no.
             [1553] They wear the tie.
None (PS1E9) [1554] Mm.
             [1555] But not even next year when he goes to school?
Fred (PS1E4) [1556] I don't think so, no I'll ask him when he comes down.
             [1557] I don't think so.
             [1558] Think they did away with the green
None (PS1E9) [1559] Oh.
Fred (PS1E4) [1560] the, the the green erm ... coats when they er, when they go
             up to the main school.

             [1632] Another one to pull it up.
             [1633] You'd only have to take two boards up out of the lot.
None (PS1E9) [1634] But I thought there was a gas tap there you know?
None (PS1E8) [1635] Well we put carpet down and couldn't find any place [...] .

Fred (PS1E4) [1657] The log ones ... at first as you go in they do but you get
             no smoke from them and from logs you would always get smoke.
None (PS1E8) [1658] Mm.
Fred (PS1E4) [1659] But you don't always get smoke from a, although if you put
             that low you get smoke from it don't you?
None (PS1E9) [1660] [...] very good.
None (PS1E8) [1661] It is.

None (PS1E8) [1677] Mm.
None (PS1E7) [1678] and we were on our way out and they were selling these ...
             and the girl said that they're very similar to Benson and Hedges
             but they're much milder.
Fred (PS1E4) [1679] They're so mild there's nobody smoking them.
None (PS1E7) [1680] So I said O K I'll buy them.
             [1681] But I, but it's not that they're mild, it's just that I
             don't like the flavour, the taste of them is just dreadful they
             just taste awful.
             [1682] So I've never smoked them, I've got about a hundred
             upstairs
None (PS1E8) [1683] Really!
None (PS1E7) [1684] and the other night I thought this is ridiculous I'll smoke
             these there's nothing really wrong with them.
Fred (PS1E4) [1685] Why don't you give them to somebody for a present?
None (PS1E8) [1686] Yes.
Fred (PS1E4) [1687] Get somebody you don't, somebody you don't like.
None (PS1E8) [1688] No if somebody wants to give up smoking.

None (PS1EB) [2280] What are you doing for your holidays this year, any [...] ?
Fred (PS1E4) [2281] I don't really yet.
             [2282] I was thinking of going.
None (PS1EB) [2283] Hm.
Fred (PS1E4) [2284] I was thinking of going to Austria about the end of
             September October but, if Alexander's not going abroad I don't
             know, I shall have to ... change me mind probably, I'll have to
             have a word with Sue.
None (PS1EB) [2285] [...] what's Sue doing with her holidays this year?
Fred (PS1E4) [2286] There not.
None (PS1EB) [2287] Aren't they? [laugh] .
Fred (PS1E4) [2288] Well I think there in, well they can't go together, told
             you the last time you was here, they can't go on holiday together.
None (PS1EB) [2289] Oh somebody got to business oh.
Fred (PS1E4) [2290] They can't leave the business .
None (PS1EB) [2291] They had more staff last year they could leave in.
Fred (PS1E4) [2292] [cough] pardon.
None (PS1EB) [2293] They had staff they could leave in charge last year.
Fred (PS1E4) [2294] Haven't they got anybody now?
None (PS1EB) [2295] Well they've only got one, one girl who sort of does
             clerical and stuff and reception, they haven't got a anybody who
             knows how to [...] .
Fred (PS1E4) [2296] [...] of there's.
None (PS1EB) [2297] Yeah, yeah, they haven't got anybody who knows anything
             about the business, well not enough about it.
Fred (PS1E4) [2298] [...] really expensive are now, aren't they?
None (PS1EB) [2299] Yeah ...
Fred (PS1E4) [2300] I suppose [...] got a car.
None (PS1EB) [2301] You know, moaning about these blokes like the postman going
             on strike over a seven per cent rise.
Fred (PS1E4) [2302] Oh I.
None (PS1EB) [2303] I mean, they shouldn't want more than seven per cent
             because the cost of living, you know, the inflation's gone down,
             but then when a bloke gets forty five thousand quid, you know eh,
             on a firm where they've a, they've made a profit, but he got an
             increase of forty five thousand pound which was of, no, no about
             forty per cent rather, forty per cent increase in his salary, I
             mean it's bloody, I mean, how can, how can they expect, you know,
             the ordinary working man to put up with bloody awful increase, if,
             if they go and give bosses increases like that, I mean it doesn't
             make sense.
Fred (PS1E4) [2304] Yes, but it's only, it's only people that are in these
             higher executive jobs that get these bloody monies.
None (PS1EB) [2305] Yeah, but then they shouldn't get it, they shouldn't do it.
Fred (PS1E4) [2306] I know.
None (PS1EB) [2307] I mean as I say now, how can you turn round to a ... to a
             bloke who's, well doesn't matter what his on, eh, what, what ever
             his, his rate of pay is, how can you turn round to him and say you
             can't have more than seven per cent, and his got, his got
             something like a about twenty five, thirty per cent .
Fred (PS1E4) [2308] I think, I think your find that a lot of these big, big
             money people get paid according to results, and if they get good
             results they get good money.
None (PS1EB) [2309] Yeah, but I don't think this bloke could have particularly
             good I don't think this bloke had particularly good results.
Fred (PS1E4) [2310] And if the results [...] results fall then they loose it .
             [2311] Hm.
None (PS1EB) [2312] He hadn't had good results.
Fred (PS1E4) [2313] Well as that, from my experience, they only pay ya for what
             your worth, not what [laugh] , don't pay ya because your good
             looking or anything like that ...
None (PS1EB) [2314] If a firm's not doing well they can't pay ya, can it?
Fred (PS1E4) [2315] Well [...] .
None (PS1EB) [2316] That's, our, our Nick's people would, wouldn't it, and that
             was it.
Fred (PS1E4) [2317] Hm.
None (PS1EB) [2318] They lost all the bloody trade.
Fred (PS1E4) [2319] Hm.
None (PS1EB) [2320] I, even Nick, Nick said two years ago things started going
             down hill ... The best paid jobs these days, say what you like,
             [...] don't like, is either in local government or something like
             that.
             [2321] There over paid vastly, local government.
Fred (PS1E4) [2322] Hm.
             [2323] Well I don't really know how much they get.
None (PS1EB) [2324] Pardon.
Fred (PS1E4) [2325] I don't really know how much money they get.
None (PS1EB) [2326] Well you've only got to look at adverts in the ruddy paper
             for
Fred (PS1E4) [2327] I mean [...] I no, I'm, I'm thinking more on the ordinary
             clerical and that executive stuff, not the [...] jobs .
None (PS1EB) [2328] Oh well, I was flicking the .
Fred (PS1E4) [2329] Yeah, yeah.
None (PS1EB) [2330] [...] .
Fred (PS1E4) [2331] I mean I don't think there particularly well paid, but
             they, there well paid for what they flipping well do cos they
             don't, they, they, they'll do it, but I mean eh, that's the fault
             of the bosses, they should cut down there staff.
             [2332] You can't blame, you can't blame people for hanging about
             doing nothing if they've twice as many staff as they should've,
             and there paying them, I mean, that, that's an administrative
             error, not a ... well it seems to be very rift in local government
             that there over staffed
None (PS1EB) [2333] I, I think all these, all these people in local government
             and things, and eh, it was obvious when, you see adverts for jobs,
             what a bloody salaries there paying them, for a mediocre job.
Fred (PS1E4) [2334] Well I never look at the adverts do I?
             [2335] I'm not in [laugh] .
None (PS1EB) [2336] No, I don't suppose you do now, but, but I have would off
             worked for local authorities, because at one time they were very
             poorly paid.
             [2337] But it's all changed now, there the best paid people in the
             ruddy country.
Fred (PS1E4) [2338] Hm ...
None (PS1EB) [2339] There'll have to have a ruddy cut down [...] , over this
             staff over this community charge, there've been trouble here next.
Fred (PS1E4) [2340] Hm.
None (PS1EB) [2341] Think about the money, about a quarter of the staff that
             they did have.
             [2342] Hm, there see, they are over staffed, there's no doubt
             about it, aren't they?
Fred (PS1E4) [2343] [...] .
             [2344] But I mean I say, that's not the fault of the people who
             work there, there not going to put themselves out of work.
             [2345] They should never have been taken on in the first place,
             any bet, that our, our problem should never have been taken on in
             the first place .
Fred (PS1E4) [2346] Well that's it , this is it, they, they take on staff to
             increase there own importance.

             the best direction each time, instead of travelling up to town
             he'll be travelling out.

Fred (PS1E4) [2366] Going the other way, so eh, be no problem.
None (PS1EB) [2367] Oh there's no problem as far as that's concerned.

Fred (PS1E4) [2386] and the buses, you know, the special buses run, no, the
             school doesn't run them.
None (PS1EB) [2387] No.

             them won't he?

None (PS1EB) [2462] No, no, no, no charge for schools here at all.
Fred (PS1E4) [2463] Well you see they're always talking about what we don't get
             in this country, they don't tell you what they don't bloody get
             abroad.
None (PS1EB) [2464] Yes [...] .

             about it at all.
             [2468] I mean the only country I spent a lot of time in, in, in
             Europe is Austria, and then I only stopped in remote villages, you
             know, more or less, so er, I mean they rely on eh, tourist trade,

             [2477] But I mean what the pay relative to us the cost of living
             and everything else, I don't know.
None (PS1EB) [2478] I don't think the cost of living is any cheaper than it is
             here, from what I can gather.
Fred (PS1E4) [2479] Mm, well the cost of living is certainly no cheaper in
             Austria than it is here.
             [2480] I mean, I don't know what sort of taxes they have on eh, on
             drink and that sort of thing, but I think Austria is more or less
             the same same sort of tax.
None (PS1EB) [2481] I don't know whether they have to pay income tax or what
             they have to do.
Fred (PS1E4) [2482] Oh they're bound, I think they're, well, I don't know
             whether they thought
None (PS1EB) [2483] It's only [...] not going to stay, she's coming back.

Fred (PS1E4) [2489] I'm, I'm not talking about VAT now, I'm talking about local
             tax.
None (PS1EB) [2490] No, no , yeah.
Fred (PS1E4) [2491] So everybody who, who uses the services at a place, pays
             for it, you know.
             [2492] Don't know if you get it on hotel bills, I think they have
             to pay something, yes.
             [2493] On hotel bills, they don't, but usually they put it,
             including local tax, or something like, they always use to show it
             separately at one time, it's a percentage, but now, very often
             your bill just shows it as a, including local tax.
None (PS1EB) [2494] Aye.
Fred (PS1E4) [2495] But, oh I don't know.
