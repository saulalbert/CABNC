*PHI:	Right what do you want?
*DAV:	Take one sheet.
*PHI:	I've got one sheet.
*DAV:	Take the green crayon then.
*PHI:	Right, I've got the green crayon.
*DAV:	Put it that way.
*PHI:	Hang on let me just   (.) turn the television down. (.) You   (.) you keep your eye on it so that when your tra tram programme comes on we can watch it.Right.What to do?
*DAV:	Well it's
*PHI:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	that way you need it.I want a table for this.

*DAV:	Write   (.) five on it.
*PHI:	Have I got to write five on mine?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Right.My green pen doesn't write very well.There you are.
*DAV:	Double add.
*PHI:	Double add?I'm not used to double add.Five plus plus   (.) equals
*DAV:	Equals
*PHI:	Equals, equals?Well this is a bit of a nonsense. (.) What's that?One hundred plus plus
*DAV:	Equals, equals.
*PHI:	Equals, equals.
*DAV:	Now it gets easier.
*PHI:	Mhm.
*DAV:	Now it gets really even harder.
*PHI:	Well which way is it?Does it get harder or easier? (.) Three hundred.
*DAV:	Mm.
*PHI:	Oh, three hundred and four. (.) I, I'm not understanding when you're doing plus plus when you're writing down yourself.What are you trying to prove?
*DAV:	Divide
*PHI:	Mm.Well that's, that's, that's very good for divide, but that's a square root sign.
*DAV:	A square root.
*PHI:	A square root at three hundred and four?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Haven't a clue.
*DAV:	Equals
*PHI:	Equals   (.) now what do you want me to do with all these?
*DAV:	Guess.
*PHI:	Oh I'm guessing.
*DAV:	Write your name at the top.
*PHI:	It's alright writing my name Dave but what am I doing? (.) Mm?
*DAV:	It's easier and easier.
*PHI:	Well it doesn't look easy.Look, I'll do the usual.Let me write you down some sums.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	And you, you can answer them.
*DAV:	Okay.
*PHI:	Sorry.I've put an answer in where you don't want. (.) There you are.There's a nice list of sums for you.Just get on with 
*DAV:	What 
*PHI:	those.That's it.
*DAV:	Well it isn't easy.It's the right one.
*PHI:	Bu yes, you got it right.I, I shouldn't have written that.
*DAV:	You sho  (.)  [whispering]  (        ) , five, six, seven, eight  [] .
*PHI:	Good
*DAV:	 [whispering]  (        )  [] .
*PHI:	Speak up.
*DAV:	How do you do a seven?
*PHI:	Er er, like that.You know how to do a seven.Oh here's the tram bit.Let's fli turn up the sound   (.) then we can     (.)  ((tv on)) (.) No you've done that backwards, it's seventeen not seventy one.Here we go look. (.) Oh look Dave this is great!Going   (.) back to the old trams.
*DAV:	But how can they go through the towns?
*PHI:	Well trams Dave   (.) they do both, they go on the railway lines and they go through the town centre. (.) Right.Oh dear!
*DAV:	Don't watch this  (        ) .
*PHI:	The Olympics, not that far away. (.) Right.
*DAV:	Let's see.Seven minus two is
*PHI:	Good. (.) Ah ah!That's wrong. (.) Right.I'll just turn off the television then we can concentrate on
*DAV:	I can.
*PHI:	Da David!You're not doing very well on that question and you've done harder ones.Remember how you do it.Add the four to the three
*DAV:	I have.
*PHI:	and what do you get?
*DAV:	Eighteen!
*PHI:	No you don't.Well do it, do it the way on your fingers.You've got thirteen plus four.Thirteen   (.) Got it now?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Plonker!Right.Now let's do this one.This is, this is easy. (.) Great!Now yo there you are now then   (.) now getting a little harder but you can do it in just the same way.
*DAV:	 [whispering]  (        )  [] .
*PHI:	So what's the answer? (.) Yes!You've got it right.Now this last one   (.) then we'll do something different. (.) That's right.Thirty three minus two is   (.) thirty one.That's not bad.Right what do you want to do now? (.) Mm?
*DAV:	Er er, I don't know.
*PHI:	Right.Well we can do plenty of that. (.) Have you cleared up all your toys and everything before Julie comes?
*DAV:	There's that  (        )
