*JEA:	We went over to Lavenham. •186336_186420•

*BRE:	Is it? •188370_188403•
*JEA:	Mm  You  •188429_188460•
*BRE:	What about  •188769_188794•
*JEA:	You can talk to the man who's running it. •188799_188942•
*BRE:	Is Ron still going with his ? •188942_189105•
*JEA:	Oh yes, he's still with Trudy. •189272_189357•
*BRE:	Do you reckon he'll end up getting married? •189357_190589•
*JEA:	No. •190747_190754•
*BRE:	No  what on  her side or his? •190754_191118•
*JEA:	Her side  she won't have it. •191186_191320•
*BRE:	Won't she? •191374_191414•
*JEA:	No  I've warned Ron  he's such an obstinate so and so, he won't be told! •191429_192045•
        I said that I think you'll find, Ron that Trudy  if she married would have to give up her  late husband's occupational widow's pension  so that the way you're going on now, where you go and stay with her for two or three days at a time  is far better  oh no, no, no, she'll be able to keep her pension   I said I very much doubt it  then I said  people are so jealous  that if she does marry you  and he doesn't tell the firm  I bet that one of her  dear neighbours will  oh no they're all very nice people round where she lives, I thought there's no good arguing with Ron! •192274_196939•
*BRE:	Would she lose he pension then if she got married? •197030_197423•
*JEA:	Well  mostly, yes. •197423_197689•
*BRE:	Careful when you put your cup . •197689_197888•
*JEA:	If you haven't, if you worked  if you haven't worked at sorry? •197935_198140•
*BRE:	Careful when you pick that up, it's ever so slippery. •198205_198399•
*JEA:	Oh my God! •198405_198692•
        If you get a  a pension based on the fact that you're your late husband's widow  when you are no longer your late husband's widow, but somebody's wife  they don't have to pay you that pension. •198697_199673•
*BRE:	Oh  so I suppose Trudy doesn't know either? •200265_200593•
*JEA:	No. •200660_200670•
*BRE:	Actually I can't blame her. •200737_200819•
*JEA:	No  and she doesn't want Ron  to move into her house  because there is no way that he could. •200819_201615•
*BRE:	The thing is he's so  isn't he? •201717_201985•
*JEA:	Yes. •202012_202021•
*BRE:	It doesn't, sort of, change anything  Has he organized his ? •202021_202550•
*JEA:	Sorry? •202656_202682•
*BRE:	Will he organize his ? •202730_202813•
*JEA:	No not really  no  it's still a great big  muddly tip! •202936_204000•
        You have seen it, haven't you? •204056_204158•
*BRE:	No. •204198_204221•
*JEA:	Oh  oh you must! •204221_204313•
*BRE:	Cos how old is he? •204440_204546•
*JEA:	Seventy. •204654_204687•
*BRE:	He's quite good for seventy, in he? •205139_205310•
*JEA:	Oh very  oh yes. •205323_205453•
*BRE:	The thing is now, you see there's no way  would you change him? •205634_205992•

*BRE:	So she's just happy with that relationship, is she? •209277_209527•
*JEA:	Yes  in fact, to be perfectly honest with you  the relationship is a bit more than she wants  Ron    is a bit of a pain  I told him over and over again  not to push his luck, I said for goodness sake, Ron, be  grateful for what you've got  apparently she  doesn't like to make love with the lights on  I said well if that's what she doesn't like that's what she doesn't like, you're not going to change a woman of sixty eight! •209540_212636•
        Oh   the way she and her husband went on  that's all in the past  I said yes, but it's there was an awful lot of it. •212672_213456•
*BRE:	That's right  he should really, especially at her age! •213456_213818•
*JEA:	Mm. •213881_213887•
*BRE:	He should, sort of, honour her wishes shouldn't he? •213887_214020•
