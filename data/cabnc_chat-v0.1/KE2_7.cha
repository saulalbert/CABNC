*TER:	Which page? •_•
        Eighty two. •_•
        Found that quickly didn't you? •_•
        Er  percentages is it? •_•
*DAN:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	Right. •_•
        E one. •_•
        Have you looked at this? •_•
        Let's have a look at it. •_•
        B's height is sixty percent of A side. •_•
        There's B  and it's sixty percent of A  C's height  is a hundred and twenty percent of A's height. •_•
        There's a hundred percent  so a hundred and twenty it means it's more  than A's height. •_•
        If C's height was a hundred percent of A's height  it means it was exactly the same. •_•
        If it's less than a hundred it's smaller  if it's more than a hundred  it's greater. •_•
        Now the decimal equivalent of hundred and twenty  is one point two  and there you've got nought and nought  a hundred and one  so ninety percent is point nine, eighty percent is point eight  and a hundred and ten percent is one point one, and a hundred and twenty percent is one point two. •_•
        So what you're doing, in fact  is to  if you've got a hundred and twenty  percent  if you divide that by  of a hundred  in other words, you move your decimal point two places  that's a decimal. •_•
        So a hundred and twenty percent  as a decimal fraction is one  point two. •_•
        All you do  is to  move that decimal point two places. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        So  to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of amount  to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of an amount you multiply  by  one point two. •_•
        If you wanted to calculate  eighty percent of an amount  you would multiply by point eight. •_•
        A hundred and twenty percent you are multiplying by the decimal equivalent which is one point two. •_•
        So write down  decimal equivalent of a hundred and forty percent. •_•
        That's right. •_•
        Now calculate a hundred and forty percent  of seven point five  kilogrammes. •_•
        Have you got a, you've got a calculator haven't you? •_•
        Haven't got it with you? •_•
*DAN:	No. •_•
*TER:	But you've got your own? •_•
        Scientific one? •_•
        No? •_•
*DAN:	No. •_•
*TER:	You could do with one. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        It's one of those things that you could do with really. •_•
        If you've got a birthday or something coming up and if somebody wants to know what to buy you  that's what you want! •_•
        You want one of these scientific ones. •_•
        So, you want a hundred and forty percent of seven point five. •_•
*DAN:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Let's have a look. •_•
        What is it? •_•
        A hundred and forty percent, so it's one  point four  times  seven point five. •_•
        Try it. •_•
        Use that one. •_•
        Yes you use your finger . •_•
        One  point four times •_•
*DAN:	Oh it's . •_•
*TER:	Ten point five, that's right. •_•
        Okay. •_•
        Ten point five killogrammes. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Put it on the, on the er  on that desk which probably will be better. •_•
        So, alright calculate  a hundred and thirty percent of sixty seven pounds. •_•
        That's right,, what is that? •_•
*DAN:	Eighty seven point nine. •_•
*TER:	Yeah, so it's eighty seven pounds  ten isn't it? •_•
        That's right. •_•
        Right, B  a hundred and twenty percent off thirty two metres? •_•
*DAN:	Oops! •_•
*TER:	No . •_•
        Start again. •_•
        Right, one point two metres  times  thirty two. •_•
        Yeah? •_•
        What is it? •_•
*DAN:	Thirty eight point four. •_•
*TER:	That's right! •_•
        Now, a hundred and eighty percent of seventy four metres? •_•
*DAN:	One three three eight two. •_•
*TER:	That's right. •_•
        Right! •_•
        E three A. •_•
        What are the decimal equivalents of  a hundred and sixty percent? •_•
        That's right. •_•
        A hundred and sixty three percent? •_•
*DAN:	Six six four. •_•
*TER:	Yeah, point six three. •_•
        Good! •_•
        You move that decimal point you see, in two places and it's one point three. •_•
        A hundred and six percent? •_•
*DAN:	One point nought six. •_•
*TER:	That's right! •_•
        One point nought six. •_•
        Again,you, the figure staying the same, all you do is to move a decimal point two places. •_•
        So D is •_•
*DAN:	One point three nine . •_•
*TER:	One point three nine. •_•
        Alright. •_•
        And E? •_•
*DAN:	One point nine . •_•
*TER:	One point nine   or one point nine, yes. •_•
        Right! •_•
        A factory plans to increase it's output by fifty percent next year. •_•
        So if this stands for this year's output  at a hundred percent  fifty percent of it has to be added on to give next year's . •_•
        So there's your hundred percent and you add fifty percent. •_•
        So next year's output is  to be a hundred and fifty percent  of this year's . •_•
        Because you add fifty percent to the hundred percent  and a hundred plus fifty is  a hundred and fifty. •_•
        So the output is going to be a hundred and fifty percent of what is was last year. •_•
        The decimal equivalent of a hundred and fifty percent is one point five O  or one point five. •_•
        Next year's output is to be one point five times this year's. •_•
        So you multiply this year's output  by one point five  and it'll give you next year's output. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        You add on that fifty percent  or whatever it happens to be  to the hundred percent  which gives you the new figure. •_•
        You change that into a decimal  that is what you multiply by. •_•
        So, let's have a look. •_•
        If something is increased by fifty percent  it is multiplied by one point five. •_•
        A new town plans to increase it's population by fifty percent during the next five years. •_•
        If the present population is eighty three percent  calculate the planned population in five years time . •_•
        So what are you gonna multiply that by? •_•
*DAN:	One point five. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        So it's eighty three thousand  and what do you get? •_•
*DAN:	One two four five O O. •_•
*TER:	That's right. •_•
        One hundred and twenty four thousand five hundred. •_•
        Now, calculate the new populations when these populations are increased by fifty percent ? •_•
        Now, you can give the answer in this form  you needn't write it out in full. •_•
        So, what you're gonna do is to multiply  sixty four point eight by •_•
*DAN:	Haven't got anything. •_•
*TER:	one point five  and that'll give you an answer which you will write down  followed by the word million. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        So, sixty four point eight  multiplied by one point five •_•
*DAN:	Ninety seven point two. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        Ninety seven point two. •_•
        Good! •_•
        Now this one. •_•
*DAN:	That's fifty eight point eight. •_•
*TER:	fifty eight point eight million. •_•
        And C? •_•
*DAN:	Eighty nine point seven million. •_•
*TER:	That's right! •_•
        Okay. •_•
        An airline  is to increase all it's fares by seventeen percent . •_•
        Now this erm illustrates the increase. •_•
        There's your hundred percent  it's got to go up by  one point seven to a hundred and seventeen percent. •_•
        One hundred and seventeen is one point one seven. •_•
        So you multiply your hundred by one point one seven and you get one hundred and seventeen. •_•
        The new fare is one hundred and seventeen percent of the old fare. •_•
        The decimal equivalent of a hundred and seventeen percent is one point one seven. •_•
        Move two decimal  decimal points down those two places, alright? •_•
        So to get the new fare you multiply the old fare by one point one seven. •_•
        The old fare multiplied by one point one seven gives you the new fare. •_•
        That represents a seventeen percent increase. •_•
        So at three,before the seventeen the percent increase the fare from London to Feraccas was five hundred and fifty pounds  calculate the new fare  after the increase . •_•
*DAN:	Six O three point five. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        So that's six hundred and forty three pounds  fifty pence  •_•
*DAN:	Fifty. •_•
*TER:	isn't it? •_•
        Right! •_•
        F four. •_•
        If you want to increase something by forty five percent  what do you multiply it by? •_•
*DAN:	Four point five. •_•
*TER:	One  if you're increasing it by forty five percent  if it was a hundred percent  and you increase it by forty five  hundred percent  •_•
*DAN:	Oh it'll be nought point •_•
*TER:	No. •_•
        A hundred percent plus forty five percent will be what? •_•
*DAN:	A hundred and forty •_•
*TER:	A hundred and  forty •_•
*DAN:	five. •_•
*TER:	five percent. •_•
        Right? •_•
        Now what's that of a decimal equivalent? •_•
*DAN:	One point four five. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        Alright? •_•
        So, if you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by? •_•
*DAN:	One point  erm  •_•
*TER:	four five. •_•
        Think in terms of putting a one in front of that  and then moving a decimal point two places and it's one point four five. •_•
        So okay, F four A is  one point four five. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        That's the first, that's your answer to that first question. •_•
        F four A  was one point four five. •_•
        Now  it says  No! •_•
        Just one point four five. •_•
*DAN:	Oh yeah. •_•
*TER:	A hundred and forty five percent is one point four five, alright? •_•
        So now it says increase twenty eighty pounds by forty five percent. •_•
        So you're gonna multiply the twenty eight by? •_•
*DAN:	One point four five. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        Forty point six. •_•
*DAN:	Forty pounds sixty, right. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Right! •_•
        F five, now all of these  you've got to increase something by something there so you've got to change each of those percentages  you've got to think of it as added to a hundred  and then the decimal equivalent. •_•
        So what are you gonna multiply the sixty seven by? •_•
*DAN:	One point six two. •_•
*TER:	One point six two. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Good! •_•
*DAN:	One O eight point five four. •_•
*TER:	That's right, one O eight point five four  and it is in killogrammes. •_•
        That's right. •_•
        Right. •_•
        Right! •_•
        So F six  A. •_•
        If you want to increase something by seven percent  what do you multiply it by? •_•
*DAN:	Er nought  point seven. •_•
*TER:	Sorry? •_•
        Say it again. •_•
*DAN:	Nought seven, one point nought seven. •_•
*TER:	Yeah, one point nought seven, that's right! •_•
        So  your answer to A is one point nought seven. •_•
        Good! •_•
        So now you increase sixty five pounds by seven percent. •_•
*DAN:	Sixty nine  point thirty five. •_•
*TER:	Sixty nine pound thirty five pence. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Good! •_•
        Okay, now F seven's gonna be the same. •_•
        Increase ninety two pounds by three percent. •_•
        That's right. •_•
        Nine pound four seventy six. •_•
        Good! •_•
        Right. •_•
        That's right. •_•
        Good! •_•
        Right! •_•
        Alfred's salary  is eighty thousand four hundred and twenty pounds and Alberta's is seven thousand a hundred and eighty four  Alfred has a twenty two percent increase  and Alberta a thirty eighty percent increase  who earns more after all this ? •_•
        So what you've got to do is to put down Alfred's  Alfred  and put his new salary down  and then you have to Alberta and her new salary and see which is  which is the most. •_•
        So you're going to look for •_•
*DAN:	Oh, tell me again ! •_•
*TER:	Alright. •_•
        So  •_•
*DAN:	Oh . •_•
*TER:	so right, eighty four two nought  multiplied by •_•
*DAN:	Erm •_•
*TER:	eight  that's right. •_•
        So what's that, ten  two seven two forty? •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        Put a, put the forty down cos it's forty pence. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Yep! •_•
        That's good! •_•
        Now, Alberta's. •_•
        Right! •_•
        So, earns more afterwards? •_•
*DAN:	Alfred. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        So Alfred is the answer. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Oh, we're coming to negative numbers. •_•
        Have we done negative numbers? •_•
*DAN:	No. •_•
*TER:	No. •_•
        Right. •_•
        Positive, negative numbers can be marked on a number line which extends  in both directions. •_•
        You can do some simple calculations by thinking of a number line, for example, two, minus two, plus five  means start at minus two  then go up five  so you'll finish at  three. •_•
        So minus two, plus five  equals •_•
*DAN:	Three. •_•
*TER:	plus three . •_•
        Right? •_•
        Minus three, minus two means start at minus three  then go down minus two, so minus three and minus two is  minus five . •_•
        Alright? •_•
        Now, before you right them down just tell me what they are and then we can go back and write them down. •_•
        Here you've got, minus four and plus three. •_•
*DAN:	That's minus one. •_•
*TER:	Good! •_•
        Minus four and plus six? •_•
*DAN:	Two. •_•
*TER:	Plus two, right. •_•
        Yes, two, yeah okay. •_•
        So write them down cos you obviously can do those alright. •_•
*DAN:	It's plus two minus  one   •_•
*TER:	Minus one , yeah. •_•
*DAN:	Minus •_•
*TER:	It's two. •_•
*DAN:	Yeah, two. •_•
*TER:	Now two minus five? •_•
*DAN:	Minus three. •_•
*TER:	Minus three. •_•
        Minus one minus three? •_•
*DAN:	Minus four. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        Minus six plus two. •_•
*DAN:	Minus four. •_•
*TER:	Right. •_•
        And three minus eight? •_•
*DAN:	Minus five. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        The number line method works when you have to add or subtract and ordinary positive number  plus three means go up three, minus three means go down three. •_•
        But it does not tell you how to do four  plus minus three  or seven minus, minus three, for example but it does not tell you how to do four  plus minus three, or seven minus minus three  where you have to add or subtract a negative number. •_•
        Adding a negative number. •_•
        Think what happens if you start with four  and add on different numbers. •_•
        Four plus three, as the number you add on goes down  so the answer goes down. •_•
        Four plus three equals seven  four plus two equals six, four plus one five, four plus nothing equals four, four plus minus one  is three  cos you're coming down here, three two, one, nought, minus one, minus two, minus three, minus four, minus five. •_•
        So as the numbers that you add on get one less  so the answers get one less. •_•
        So, four  plus minus one is three, four  plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nothing, four plus minus five is minus one. •_•
        What is important  is that you realise that  that number  is minus one  that number is one  plus one if you like but you don't need to say it but if any, if the sign isn't there it's assumed that it's plus. •_•
        But that number and that number are two different numbers. •_•
        They're as different as one is from three. •_•
        That is a different number from that, that is a different number from that. •_•
        And that number is minus one. •_•
        Don't think of it as taking away one  thinking of it, think of it as  minus one, a number. •_•
        That is minus two  that is minus three  that is minus four, that is minus five. •_•
        You've done some algebra haven't you? •_•
        Found out the value of X  well you can X  equals minus five. •_•
        And that is a value for X, it equals minus five  and minus five is a number. •_•
        So, try and remember that, that that is a number in it's own right. •_•
        Now when you start thinking of what to do  you've got plus four and you've got minus three  if you take the smaller digit, now that digit is four, that digit is three  if you take the smaller digit from the larger digit, you take the three from the four you get one and the answer is whatever sign that larger number is. •_•
        When you've got two numbers that are both, all pluses, four and two is six, four and one is five, four and nothing is four, four and minus one means you got  plus four minus one, is one less than four, it's three. •_•
        You've got four plus numbers, you got two minus numbers  which leaves you with two plus numbers. •_•
        Let's go on and see whether you can pick it up. •_•
        Write down the next two lines of a pattern of the bottom of the opposite page . •_•
        Notice that four plus minus one  has the same answer as four minus one. •_•
        Four plus minus two has the same answer as four minus two and so on because the plus and minus gives you a minus. •_•
        So we've got four  plus minus one is three, four plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nought, four plus minus five is minus one  what's going to be the next one? •_•
        Four plus •_•
*DAN:	Minus six •_•
*TER:	Equals? •_•
*DAN:	makes minus two. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        So write that down in your book now safely. •_•
        A is A two, write down the next two lines. •_•
        So you got four plus minus six is minus two, then you'll have four plus  minus seven is gonna be? •_•
        Minus three. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Okay? •_•
        So  let's go on. •_•
        Adding minus N is the same as subtracting N   adding the minus number  is the same as subtracting it. •_•
        So copy and complete these . •_•
        So write down A three A. •_•
        Five plus minus three  equals five minus three  equals? •_•
*DAN:	Two. •_•
*TER:	Two. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Two plus minus six is the same as two minus six  which is going to be? •_•
        You got plus two minus six •_•
*DAN:	Four. •_•
*TER:	Mm? •_•
*DAN:	Four. •_•
*TER:	You take the smaller digit from the larger digit  so you take the two  •_•
*DAN:	Eight. •_•
*TER:	from the six and it gives you four but then you give the sign of a larger  •_•
*DAN:	 (        ) 
*TER:	so it's minus four. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        Now this is minus three plus minus four  which is the same as minus three minus four. •_•
        Now you can, those are both the same sides so you're gonna add them together  and give it the sign that is common to both. •_•
*DAN:	Minus six. •_•
*TER:	Minus? •_•
*DAN:	Six? •_•
*TER:	Three and four? •_•
*DAN:	Seven, sorry! •_•
*TER:	So , alright? •_•
        Minus seven, yeah? •_•
        Happy? •_•
        Right, so A four,work these out . •_•
        Now if you can do them then just put the answer down. •_•
        Six  plus minus three is the same as six  plus and a minus give you a minus, so it's the same as six minus three  which is? •_•
        What's six minus three? •_•
*DAN:	Three. •_•
*TER:	Three! •_•
        Right! •_•
        You take the smaller digit from the larger digit, so you take three from six gives you three  you give the sign of the bigger number which is a plus. •_•
        Now this time  you've got two  minus five. •_•
*DAN:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	You take the two, the smaller digit from the larger digit  but you give the answer the sign of a larger digit. •_•
        So it's? •_•
*DAN:	Minus •_•
*TER:	Minus three! •_•
        Alright? •_•
        Yeah? •_•
        Okay, you got minus one  and a minus four. •_•
*DAN:	Minus four. •_•
*TER:	No, you got a minus one  and a minus four  they're both the same signs, cos it's minus one, minus four  they're both the same signs  so you put them together  four and one make? •_•
*DAN:	Five? •_•
*TER:	And you've got •_•
*DAN:	Minus one. •_•
*TER:	minus , so they're minus five. •_•
        Let's just have a look at  if we've got  six and four  we can have six plus four  or you can have six minus four  we can have minus six, minus four  or you can have minus six  plus four. •_•
        Now  that's a plus six and a plus four  what's the answer? •_•
*DAN:	Ten. •_•
*TER:	Ten. •_•
        Nice and straightforward. •_•
        Both the signs are the same. •_•
        So you add them together and you give it the same sign. •_•
        This one  what's the answer to that gonna be? •_•
        You've got a minus six and a minus four. •_•
        Both the same signs. •_•
*DAN:	Ten. •_•
*TER:	Can't be the same as that. •_•
        They're both minus. •_•
        Those are both plus  so we call it plus ten  these are both minus so the answer is? •_•
*DAN:	Ten. •_•
*TER:	Minus ten. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        If the signs are the same you add them together, you give the the sign that they're both the same as. •_•
        Now, here you've got six minus four  now what's six minus four? •_•
*DAN:	Two. •_•
*TER:	So that equals two. •_•
        Now here you got minus six  plus four  take the smaller from the larger  and give it the sign of a larger. •_•
*DAN:	Minus two. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        Does that help  a little bit? •_•
        Let's do another one. •_•
        Let's do erm  eight plus three  eight minus three  minus eight, minus three, and minus eight plus three. •_•
        Let's see if we can do those. •_•
        What's eight and three? •_•
*DAN:	Eleven. •_•
*TER:	Right. •_•
        What's minus eight and minus three? •_•
*DAN:	Minus nine. •_•
*TER:	No! •_•
        Minus eight and minus three? •_•
        Both the same signs. •_•
*DAN:	Minus eleven. •_•
*TER:	Minus eleven. •_•
        Now this is easy, eight minus three is? •_•
*DAN:	Five. •_•
*TER:	Five. •_•
        But this is a minus eight  •_•
*DAN:	That's five, yes. •_•
*TER:	plus three, it's minus five. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        Tear that out and keep that by your side because that gives you  all the four possibilities. •_•
        Alright? •_•
        When the signs are the same  if they're two pluses you add them and it's plus  if they're both minus you add them and it's minus  here you take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger. •_•
        Three from eight is five, that's plus five. •_•
        Three from eight is five, but that is minus, so it's gonna be minus five. •_•
        Okay? •_•
        So keep that by your side  and see how we get on. •_•
        So we've what were we doing? •_•
        A  B  D! •_•
        This one here is it? •_•
        Minus two plus minus five. •_•
        Which is minus two  minus five. •_•
        Minus two  plus the minus gives you a minus, so you got minus two, minus five. •_•
*DAN:	Er, minus seven. •_•
*TER:	Minus seven. •_•
        Right! •_•
        Now here you've got nought  and a plus minus gives you a minus, so it's nought minus four? •_•
*DAN:	Minus three. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        Good! •_•
        Three  minus three? •_•
        Three •_•
*DAN:	Nought. •_•
*TER:	minus three. •_•
*DAN:	Nought. •_•
*TER:	Nought, right! •_•
        Minus five  minus two? •_•
*DAN:	Minus three. •_•
        Erm •_•
*TER:	Minus and a minus. •_•
        Same as that one, look. •_•
        Minus two, minus five. •_•
        You got that one right. •_•
        What was that? •_•
        Minus two and minus five. •_•
*DAN:	Seven. •_•
*TER:	Is minus seven. •_•
        Right? •_•
        So here you got minus five, minus two which is? •_•
*DAN:	Minus seven. •_•
*TER:	Minus seven. •_•
        Now here you got seven  minus nine? •_•
        Take the smaller from the larger which will give you? •_•
        Seven  •_•
*DAN:	 (        ) 
*TER:	from two, nine is two  and that number is a minus so the answer's going to be a minus, so it's gonna be? •_•
*DAN:	Minus two. •_•
*TER:	Minus two. •_•
        Alright? •_•
