*PS1D0:	No you 've done . 
*PS1CX:	Mm . 
*PS1D0:	you 've done very well Have n't you really Your first your first year . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah we did well but erm we should n't have like you learn by your mistakes but we we kind of made profit and we should n't of done . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	erm and now the tax man has hammered us so hard . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	that we 're really struggling . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	And we 're really having to struggle to sort of make ends meet . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah I know what you mean You it 's a diffi it 's difficult . 
*PS1CX:	It 's wrong int it . 
*PS1D0:	just striking up that balance int it . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	Is n't it really . 
*PS1CX:	And of course now they when we originally moved in here we asked about the rates and they said oh they co they would n't raise it because it was an unfinished project . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	and nobody had paid rates and they would n't pay rates until they 'd actually finished building on the land opposite . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	Anyway when the accountant came in to do the books he said er oh he said you 've got to pay something So he said I 'll get onto them myself Anyway apparently he was told exactly the same thing as I was told . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	but of course it had kind of stirred up a hornets' nest Next thing they were down with the measuring up and we 'd just got a four thousand pound rate bill And they 've actually rated it at ten and a half thousand erm payable . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	three thousand eight and of course well Neil said there 's V A T I did n't think you had to pay V A T on rates . 
*PS1D0:	I did n't I did n't you know I do n't . 
*PS1CX:	You know . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	Er anyway so tha that 's sort of you know made . 
*PS1D0:	Mm . 
*PS1CX:	a big difference That 's suddenly four thousand a year we 've to find . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	I mean if it 's crippling us is this place . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	If it was n't for this we could be it would be quite good . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	But what can you do there 's nothing else about . 
*PS1D0:	No it 's that 's it And a lot of businesses up and down are er are in a bad way really . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	Some very sailing very close to the wind . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah They 're all finding it hard are n't they . 
*PS1D0:	Well there 's less and less work and the work that does seem to be about is that competitively priced that . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	you know it 's negible whether you can make anything even if . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	you get the work . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah And then of course er money is floating round very quickly No No I er in fact we yeah we just had a problem yesterday we started work for the Royal Scotsman and erm well we started work for them like last year and we 've been doing jobs . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	and we 've had invoices outstanding since October . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	So Neil said well these invoices were n't forthcoming so I said to them the thing the thing is if we start work and we buy a load of equipment how are we gon na sort of how long 's the cheque gon na gon na be coming in you know . 
*PS1D0:	And you have to fund it . 
*PS1CX:	So we asked for twenty thousand pound upfront . 
*PS1D0:	Tt . 
*PS1CX:	So anyway and they said and before we wi we get this twenty thousand we also want the ou October 's invoices clearing up as well So that was great Anyway we 've waited and waited we 've rung and we 've rung Eventually a cheque came instead of being like for six thousands er nearly seven thousand it came for four . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	Erm the twenty thousand eventually arrived no V A T You know . 
*PS1D0:	Yes . 
*PS1CX:	and all this sort of things So of course we were getting a little bit panicky cos what 's worrying me and it still worries me again we 've put all this time and effort in they may pay us alright we 've got this twenty they may pay us a second payment but are they gon na pay up on the third . 
*PS1D0:	Well tha that 's always the catch is n't it . 
*PS1CX:	You know . 
*PS1D0:	The last one . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah So we actually wrote down erm th the equipment that we were buying was ours until paid for in full . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	By them . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	And we sent this letter up to them Well we 've had their director on the phone phone yesterday and more or less demanded his twenty thousand back . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	and if you do n't want the work we 'll take it elsewhere and all this . 
*PS1D0:	Mm . 
*PS1CX:	Erm . 
*PS1D0:	Puts you off does n't it . 
*PS1CX:	Well I mean what on earth do you do . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Very difficult is n't it . 
*PS1CX:	You just well Ne both Neil and I have sort of felt well to be quite honest it is n't worth it . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah For what you make at the end of the day on on somebody 's . 
*PS1CX:	No it 's not worth it It . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	well it the running the business is n't I do n't think because by the time the tax man 's hammered you . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	you know the V A T man wants his money I mean the V A T man 's been paid for all these invoices . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	and I still have n't got the money in . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	You know Everything 's against you . 
*PS1D0:	Really V A T's I think and I think it should only be paid when it when the invoices . 
*PS1CX:	Exactly . 
*PS1D0:	have been cleared rather than always paying . 
*PS1CX:	Exactly . 
*PS1D0:	for that quarter . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	even if you 've not got paid . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah Exactly Erm mm I do n't know whether there 's any way round it but that 's sort of the set up that they gave us when we started and I guess I 'll have to sort of conform to that but it . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	does seem unfair . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah That 's right . 
*PS1CX:	I mean now there 's a couple of people quibbling about actually paying at the that we did . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	There 's still six hundred and odd pound outstanding Erm I ca n't honestly see us ever getting that . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	Erm the funiculars they 're quibbling about the final payment . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	About them being late and everything else Er you know it 's just a and I 've paid for that and that and . 
*PS1D0:	There 's extenuating circumstances like that . 
*PS1CX:	Oh dear . 
*PS1D0:	though is n't there As Neil said . 
*PS1CX:	Well yeah . 
*PS1D0:	Changes in specification . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	er equipment coming in late er . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	you know I mean . 
*PS1CX:	They do n't seem to want to know though I mean Neil 's tried to explain to them that they were late with drawings and everything else it put us way behind in the beginning . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	But all you know they 've just not listened to him . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	So . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	I guess it 'll . 
*PS1D0:	It 's er stal stalling they 're . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	cos that 's all it 's doing in n it . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah Well solicitor said she it sounded to her as if there 's something more to it Maybe they do n't have the money . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	And they 're stalling all the time . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	But erm you see they suggested going down for a meeting he 's up to his eyes in it . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	And . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	he ca n't honestly spare time to go down there . 
*PS1D0:	It 's costing you money is n't it . 
*PS1CX:	Well yeah . 
*PS1D0:	And chase your own what 's due to . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	you That 's that 's the . 
*PS1CX:	And we know you 're gon na have an argument So is it worth it . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	I I I personally feel that give it to solicitor and let her deal with it because . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	just not worth the hassle Alright . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	that 's gon na cost . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	but but I mean you can only make it worse by like you say you 're wasting your own time and money . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	you 're not gon na get anywhere . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah All gets . 
*PS1CX:	I mean . 
*PS1D0:	a bit acrimonious does n't it And er . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah Do n't it . 
*PS1D0:	er that sort of thing starts happening . 
*PS1CX:	Oh it 's painful . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	It really is painful . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah It 's getting ever more difficult is n't it Doing . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	business Ever more . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah You just I th all this bumph about sort of trying to help small businesses and things like that they do nothing . 
*PS1D0:	No No I know that . 
*PS1CX:	They do nothing at all . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah No it 's er as you say all all the cards are stacked i in . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	such a way that it makes it ever more difficult . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah The trouble is see you know you 've nobody you can go to you you 've nobody that sort of will listen to . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	to all this and do something about it higher up . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	I mean they just keep hammering and hammering and more and more are going out of business . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	Alright th the saying in the paper they 're talking about stopping these big companies keeping these little companies waiting there could be something they can do about that but how long is it going to be before they do something . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah It 's a . 
*PS1CX:	In the meantime there 's more and more going bust every week . 
*PS1D0:	Well the trouble is a lot of these mps and people on these committees are actually they 've got seats on the boards of a lot of these big companies . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	so it 's not in their interests to push this through The longer they can stall something . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	like that . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	er you know the better it is and particularly when you look at the the fever that there is at the moment about electioneering . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	is is no big business is n't it . 
*PS1CX:	No that 's true I mean maybe I should go and see local erm mp or . 
*PS1D0:	Local M P . 
*PS1CX:	whatever and and about the rates . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	And see you know if they can do something about that maybe it 'd be right time . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	Bu cos we 're actually the only ones that have their rate bill Barry 's has n't . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	So you know they 're . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	just expecting us to pay . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah I would . 
*PS1CX:	And it 's Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	That 's what they 're there for . 
*PS1CX:	Well yeah that 's true . 
*PS1D0:	Whether you 've voted for them or not . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	And you know in fact . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	you pay your taxes and and . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah it 's very true that . 
*PS1D0:	you know it can have . 
*PS1CX:	I might do that . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Because if if they 've singled yourself out it 's obviously it 's not right is it . 
*PS1CX:	No it 's not Well I said well I 'm not paying mine until somebody else gets theirs . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	And have to pay theirs . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	But erm I suppose next thing 'll be a court demand and how d' ya fight that . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	So . 
*PS1D0:	It 's all a worry in n it . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah int it Oh Headache stuff Never mind . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	Never mind . 
*PS1D0:	Oh well keep your head down . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah Yeah At least there is n't the same hassle as there was at Calpers . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	I mean alright yes you sort of have worries but most of the time I mean for all last year it 's run pretty well . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	It 's only just recently that we sort of starting our de we 've had bits of aggro . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Or at least like . 
*PS1CX:	So . 
*PS1D0:	with this a all the benefits are you get them personally do n't you . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	Er rather than . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	doing the same amount of hours er and somebody else benefiting . 
*PS1CX:	That 's it Yeah that 's it . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	I mean it 's like his car for instance I mean that 's always been a dream he never thought he 'd ever be able to afford a new car erm . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	you know . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	And er of course that 's like a dream come true for Neil so . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	that 's . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	why we want to make a success and he do n't lose it all . 
*PS1D0:	Well you know you 've got to have er benefits of of taking a course of action like this have n't you Because . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	otherwise you know . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	what 's the point . 
*PS1CX:	That 's it . 
*PS1D0:	What 's the point I mean i . 
*PS1CX:	That 's it . 
*PS1D0:	It 's not that people want to get rich it 's just that you make a nice living and enjoy . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	what you like doing and that 's it . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	You know . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah Yeah can well do without the sort of the hassle and the aggro I mean Calpers have made it a lot worse for us . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	They have They 've done . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	everything possible to make life difficult . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	But er hopefully they 'll leave us alone soon But it does n't help when we bring people like Geoff you see cos Geoff comes from Calpers . 
*PS1D0:	Oh I do n't oh right . 
*PS1CX:	Oh yeah He did . 
*PS1D0:	I de I did n't recognize him . 
*PS1CX:	Really angry about it because they 've had to bring somebody else in to do Geoff 's work . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah Right . 
*PS1CX:	So I mean it was Geoff 's choice . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Well this is it I mean people you ca n't make people do things I mean they 've got to . 
*PS1CX:	No . 
*PS1D0:	want to do it have n't they So . 
*PS1CX:	Yeah This . 
*PS1D0:	well . 
*PS1CX:	is it . 
*PS1D0:	we 've done very little there They ju just do n't seem to be doing any steel work at all . 
*PS1CX:	No Well everybody keeps telling us they 're not doing anything They just do n't know how they 're surviving but they keep going on . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	The man he must have plenty of money to keep it carrying it . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	as he is doing . 
*PS1D0:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS1CX:	But er . 
*PS1D0:	no doubt it 'll all come out in fullness of time . 
*PS1CX:	Well yeah . 
*PS1D0:	wo n't it . 
*PS1CX:	It will wo n't it Yeah . 
*PS1D0:	Things ca n't carry on indefinitely in any business . 
*PS1CX:	No . 
*PS1D0:	where nothing 's being produced can it . 
*PS1CX:	No Oh well he 's he 's told the lads that it 's only a matter of time I think that 's what more or less decided Geoff that yeah he would take it .
