        So, I mean, we know what we want, but  it's them and not us, I mean, it is frightening to start a business up, 'cos we don't know how much work we'll be getting, but, I mean, •703335_713425•
*JUN:	Well, it's same for anybody starting any business, ain't it, you don't know if it's gonna work  as well. •713475_718085•
*ALB:	It might go well for the first three or four months, and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months , •718375_723225•
*KAR:	Yeah. •723605_723775•
*ALB:	you could be struggling to keep it above  •724255_727935•
*KAR:	Yeah. •728125_728395•
*ALB:	and especially, you know, these bloody big firms, they do not like paying bloody bills. •728395_734605•
*KAR:	No. •734685_734955•
*ALB:	I mean, you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business will still go under. •734955_744045•
*KAR:	Yeah, because of it. •744075_745255•
*ALB:	Because of it. •745755_745855•
*KAR:	Yeah. •745905_746215•

*ALB:	Let's hope he gets off the floor. •763765_764585•
*JUN:	walking across roads a risk, ain't it. •764585_766235•
*KAR:	Yeah. •766335_766545•
*JUN:	It's just if you've got the nerve to do it. •766545_769035•
*ALB:	It's a risk with these buggers, what's in power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power. •769125_774215•
*SAS:	I got  •774215_775195•
*ALB:	I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it tough at all. •777175_782065•
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	I can tell you that, now. •782495_786595•
*JUN:	Oohh. •786975_787455•

        So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him, and he's got enough work for six, then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two of 'em. •814415_820565•
*ALB:	Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets the jobs done quicker  •820565_823815•
*KAR:	Yeah, but then you still got six wages to pay out, haven't ya. •823815_829495•
*JUN:	Yeah. •829495_829695•
*ALB:	That's it. •829695_829915•
        He probably will have six later on, if he gets it off, but  the thing is, I mean, he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half the time,you know, he'll be sat doing nothing, scratching his nose. •829915_847825•
        Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the people that want a job, but don't wanna work for it. •848155_856625•
