        It were always like, me and our Colin were more or less with me dad, and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum. •109559_110422•
        Then when they got older, me dad sort of took our John on, because our John were mechanical minded, and our Colin got pushed out a bit, 'cos our Colin weren't interested in cars. •110425_111451•
*SAS:	I found this. •111455_111529•
*JUN:	Oh yeah, oh that's what that bird. •111530_111778•
        Yuk. •111778_111824•
        And our Colin was to be off t' fair, and that, so, me dad sort of went on to our John and pushed our Colin out a little bit. •111824_112738•
*KAR:	Yeah. •112743_112770•
*JUN:	But er, me and our Colin's never been me mum's favourite. •112770_113333•

        She is  'cos she's got Margaret's lips and your nose, but out of all of you, I think your your you can see your John in it, can't you, more than anybody. •114451_115258•
*UNK:	I always think our John looks more like a Prescott, 'cos he every time I see him, I see me Uncle Bill more and more. •115264_115849•
*KAR:	Yeah, John  used to say, years ago about how much that you're, John looks like your Brian, and I don't think he looks anything like it. •115917_116705•
*JUN:	No, I don't. •116706_116777•
*KAR:	And she  again now, she says like somebody  your John look like that bloke next door. •116777_117317•
        What a load of rubbish, I thought well. •117368_117523•

*KAR:	Aye. •117629_117650•
*JUN:	our Colin's getting more and more like me dad. •117650_118063•
*ALB:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	Well, Brian  ain't it. •118063_118176•
        Brian , Brian I think don't like, er, •118176_118549•
*ALB:	they are, they're all like that. •118621_118738•
        All of them. •118766_118862•
*JUN:	And I think our John looks like me Uncle Bill. •118863_118997•
*KAR:	Yeah, I think he does. •118997_119408•
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	But then again, he did look like that photo, I think he does look like that photo, but you were younger then, •119427_120095•
*JUN:	Yeah. •120095_120105•
*KAR:	but he does look like Uncle Bill. •120105_120244•
        Mind you  Colin's getting more like your dad every day. •120258_120780•
*JUN:	I know he is. •120780_120898•
*KAR:	black welding glasses on, and he turned round and he made me jump. •120898_121232•

*ALB:	Yeah. •121869_121883•
*KAR:	I can't do it. •121883_122020•
        And right, he made me heart jump, 'cos he looked just like your dad, and then a few days later, he's in garage again, and Johnny come in and he said, God he said, he gave me a flaming heart attack out there. •122023_123013•
        I said, why, and he said, he turned round with these glasses on, then he said it was just like John's stood there. •123020_123489•
        I says, don't tell me, I said, he did the same thing to me the other day, and it were only within a couple of days of each other. •123489_124020•
        When he puts those glasses on, honestly he's his double. •124070_124300•
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*KAR:	I think it's the way he looks, like, if you know what I mean, you know like  pull his face and like, look over glasses, I mean,he did it to me when  did it to Johnny. •124300_125505•
        He probably thought  like. •125505_125588•
*SAS:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	He's like me dad, er me dad, he never had no patience, and our Colin's just like him. •125590_126316•
*KAR:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	Mind you, I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways. •126317_126682•
        I haven't got a lot of patience. •126694_126820•
        But where  where we're better off 'cos Albert, he's calm, where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered •126820_127667•
*KAR:	Yeah. •127667_127683•
*JUN:	Where, when I start, Albert's •127683_127850•
*KAR:	He, I tell you want he doesn't do, I shouldn't let you hear, but, when he, when him and me are arguing when we were younger, and me dad used to wind Colin up, and wind me up, and I'd get madder and madder, and me dad used to love it. •127856_129109•
        But looking back, you know, and now, that's what Colin does to me, he winds me bloody up,but I can't help it, because he gets me that wild, I should just, I should, I mean, how can you change his temperament. •129109_129992•

*JUN:	What they do, they look they look around and they weigh up up pros and cons up, and it it's like these insurance brokers, they ring all over to buy cheapest insurance for you, well, that's what Allied Dunbar are doing. •170185_171366•
