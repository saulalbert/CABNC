*GET:	We will move on  . •_•
*JOH:	I'm allowed to say something  pilgrimage of love  and the parish knows that too because something  that er  it's . •_•
        So the three words that's come to my mind immediately are  go and do! •_•
        And you will recognise them as the words of Jesus. •_•
        They are  direct  they're clear  they're simple  and most importantly  they are words of one syllable. •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	But they  still have a conscience  and they challenge that they . •_•
        Now the  the annual assembly  has challenged us to engage in  what is called integrated trading. •_•
        Personally, I prefer to speak about  learning together  because I think it's more  friendly use, er, user friendly  I think I understand it better  and it reminds me  that it's connected with disciple-ship. •_•
        Because I'm quite sure that  the young people  this morning  everyone would know  that the word disciple  means •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Follower  isn't it? •_•
*JOH:	Well you're all shy aren't you? •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	yes? •_•
*UNK:	Means a learner. •_•
*JOH:	Now the word disciple means learner. •_•
        So that we're all involved  disciple-ship is integrally, er, learning is integral  to our disciple-ship. •_•
        And we are involved  not just, spasmodically or occasionally  but continuously. •_•
        And learning together  as we've been reminded more than once than this morning  engages us all  irrespective of age, irrespective of experience  it engages everyone  and it's worth emphasising that the quality of learning  does not depend upon the size of a congregation! •_•
        And I say that in a right of some statistics that appear in today's agenda. •_•
        The quality of learning  depends upon the measure of our response  and of our commitments. •_•
        It involves sharing our gifts  with each other freely and generously. •_•
        It means erm  learning  with each other and learning from each other because none of us knows it all! •_•
        And I think, also, it means being open  open to one another and open  with one another. •_•
        And when you put all that together  I think we would recognise  that there is no single    of learning  that suits every congregation  because congregations differ, one from the other. •_•
        And we remind ourselves that the spirit is also  infinitely versatile and flexible in its activity. •_•
        But when we consider learning together  are a model. •_•
        To use an educational term  it's an active model  it's an active model of, model of partnership  and of sharing. •_•
        Patterns of Ministry  to my mind  can be interpreted as  patterns of sharing  and partnership is active and not fussy. •_•
        Partnership is  creative  and not rigid. •_•
        Partnership is  dynamic  and not . •_•
        And then  learning together  is a model  of dynamic  encounter  or dialogue, one with the other. •_•
        And by that, I mean  that we engage one another in a process. •_•
        We cannot all, as it already been emphasised  by the last speaker  we may not all be able to do the same things  we have not all got the same gifts or the same  responsibilities  er  within the church  but you all  have the same responsibilities  in this light of God. •_•
        And that implies that  our learning together  engages us in  dynamic encounter  dynamic dialogue  which also releases  some of those energies in various areas of life  that would otherwise be sealed  or indeed, locked! •_•
        And I were to guess that  learning together is also  a model of  rich  and diverse possibilities. •_•
        There is no one who can foresee  what are the ultimate results. •_•
        Or what is the ultimate outcome of any learning process? •_•
        There is no blueprint  that one could lay down  but with a  on  the infinite  versatility of God  to use and deploy the gifts that we are able to offer  to his service. •_•
        The Holy Spirit is also flexible  and progressive in operation. •_•
        And therefore, in learning together there are  rich  and diverse possibilities. •_•
        And I would suggest through us learning together  is a model  of effective evangelism. •_•
        For evangelism  at best is a congregation learning together. •_•
        Learning together for the word. •_•
        Learning together for the sacrament. •_•
        Learning together through prayer and worship  and all the activities of the church. •_•
        Learning together by entering, entering into  the experience of one or the other  and also  engaging the community around the church, not superficially  but er  realistically. •_•
        And it would seem to me  that unless this morning's exercise  which has been so rewarding and so  profitable  unless this morning's exercise is to dissipate  into another piece of feeling  and er  pleasurable discussion  then we ought to take quite seriously  the, the words of Jesus. •_•
        Go and do! •_•
        And see whether we can , we could put this  matter of learning together  that every member of  of our church   high on the agenda. •_•
        Well, at the next er  elders meeting  the next church meeting  the next district council  •_•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*JOH:	or whatever. •_•
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	We'll move on. •_•
        And  read the  please  six  and visions from Viscuss The first one is going to be  given a bit more time  and then the other five are going to brief. •_•
        And we'll ask Christian, who's erm  an  elder •_•
*ALA:	Yes, right. •_•
*GET:	In  Garmonchaty to share an experience of their church  in terms of using ministry. •_•
        A ministry that we don't often think of as a ministry. •_•
        Correct sir? •_•
*ALA:	. •_•
        Er, in the introductions I didn't stand up and er, introduce myself cos I felt it would steal a few minutes of my er presentation! •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALA:	This is , it is my first visit to a . •_•
        My name's Chris , I'm from the river town  URC in  just down the road. •_•
        What we've been embarking on in the  er  the URC church in Shodden is er budgeting  the title of my  talk today is budgeting for growth. •_•
        We hear about budgets in all walks of life, indeed we saw a red box only a few days ago. •_•
        I'm afraid I've only got a little red one! •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALA:	This will happen next week. •_•
        So we've had the most famous budget of all. •_•
        I suppose  you could argue that his budget was er, a budget for growth  but my discussion this morning is apolitical. •_•
        But I'll make not comment on his budget at all. •_•
        The basic principle of a budget  is straightforward  it's to forecast your   forecast your expenses  so they can make plans  for the future. •_•
        Big and , little businesses alike  budget for growth. •_•
        It enables them to make most, most cost-effective use  of their resources. •_•
        So why shouldn't a church do the same? •_•
        On this approach, following a presentation  and a discussion  led by the Reverend Bill   about eighteen months ago. •_•
        And I've written this paper, not to  give information  and details  on, how you do budget. •_•
        There are plenty of papers and books  and guidance from the URC to help you do that. •_•
        What I'd like to  share with you this morning  is  how we as a church took that challenge  and the experiences we feel we've  received  from taking that challenge. •_•
        We have begun to feel the benefit. •_•
        Well how was it at er  Shodden Well, like any other church we thought we were doing well. •_•
        We were just getting enough money in  to do  just enough in the church. •_•
        The church was helping  the spirit. •_•
        Helping in kind. •_•
        Helping the fellowship. •_•
        What more as a church could we ask for? •_•
        Well maybe they can   like any other church  was the , or is, the Annual Church the Annual General Meeting  and as John pointed out this morning  of course, we look  at what we've done in the past. •_•
        The finances  the well being of our own flock  what we have done. •_•
        But, look at the tense, it's what  have done . •_•
        It's a retrospective view. •_•
        That is important, we learn from experiences. •_•
        But it's what we've done in the past. •_•
        What about the future? •_•
        How many of us actually, in our church meeting, look forward  to what we want to do? •_•
        Where's the direction of your church? •_•
        Where's the direction of your fellowship  that they can follow? •_•
        Are there any problems that may be looming on the horizon  that perhaps you ought to be addressing before they reach the door? •_•
        We need to grow together  and enjoy the experience together. •_•
        So what changed us? •_•
        Well, the presentation by Bill  helped  in supporting  provided was the . •_•
        We've heard it all before! •_•
        But not, at any time, in the context of the church. •_•
        A number of us went to that presentation  the minister, the church secretary, myself, and the treasurer at the time  and a few of the elders. •_•
        We listened and learned  that if the church is to grow  it must consider all its resources! •_•
        Reference to that again this morning. •_•
        We must tap that wealth with talent. •_•
        I suppose really we learn by who sent us that evening. •_•
        A sense of purpose  a sense of involvement  a sense of direction  a sense of satisfaction  and a sense of achievement. •_•
        We're beginning to experience all those. •_•
        And I suppose we also experience a sixth sense. •_•
        A sense of humour   •_•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*ALA:	we've heard that again this morning. •_•
        And Bill, in there, used sense of humour  to get some of his points over. •_•
        But we've got all of those. •_•
        talk from any of you. •_•
        If you look closely at that  to what depth  to what depth do those senses reach  in your church? •_•
        Our church has money to spend on  on anything!, fabric, fellowship  worship, mission  the list is endless! •_•
        What a delightfulness to choose from! •_•
        But what priority do you sign to it? •_•
        Which one do you choose? •_•
        How much  on each of those? •_•
        One of the problems you may be facing in your church is inertia  the feeling that  we're doing fine  everything's ticking over. •_•
        But remember, the same effort  reaps the same reward. •_•
        So we returned from that evening together  and were very enthusiastic about what we heard. •_•
        The seed was sown in good soil. •_•
        The treasurer indeed, faces the same old  •_•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*ALA:	task every year  to ask church members to give a little bit more  to pay the bills. •_•
        What a depressing thing to ask for! •_•
        Just to keep up with inflation! •_•
        Just to keep the wolf from the door. •_•
        Wouldn't you generate a more positive attitude  if  you were aligned your increase  or the request for an increase  through the a  an increase in activity  in the church itself? •_•
        That, is true growth! •_•
        So what did we do? •_•
        Well, first of all we told the people  at the earliest opportunity  we told the church members what we've learnt  told them about our  of the advantages and our enthusiasm and commitment to the process. •_•
        We tried the process. •_•
        We selected a single project to just  learn  how to do it  just go through the process simply. •_•
        It took about nine months of planning from start to finish  on the one project we did. •_•
        We had a programme on four consecutive Saturdays, last October  help reach the . •_•
        At, not a significant cost. •_•
        It's a significant step for our fellowship. •_•
        And  the benefit is, we want to do it again this year, that's great! •_•
        Plus, taking , keeping it and doing it  if you see benefit in that. •_•
        So that was a benefit to  people outside  and people inside the church. •_•
        We have learnt at getting  a number of people  into our congregation. •_•
        So that was our first success when we decided  that process. •_•
        Forward planning  and setting objectives  were a good way to focus attention. •_•
        So, we set objectives  and , subsequently  planned a budget  to ensure  that it's successful. •_•
        So what's the timetable? •_•
        Well I'll take you back six months. •_•
        The elders were advised in advance that we were going to discuss  the future,. •_•
        This enabled the eldership to start thinking about  what we want to do next year  to grow together. •_•
        So, in the next elders meeting  we used a management technique, brainstormers  think the  say what you think. •_•
        And  we gathered all this information  we grouped it into those categories, admission, worship,and such like. •_•
        Then later, couple of months later when we found that list  checked that we understood what the list meant  and we presented that list  to our church meeting. •_•
        This will ensure that there's commitment  and that the direction is understood  for the next year. •_•
        So, in that presentation discussions followed  and that list of nine things, I think it was, surprise surprise the church wanted to do all nine! •_•
        Now there's a challenge! •_•
        So what we did then, is we went  to do, to do fact-finding, costs, people resources, effort  and any options that might be open to us. •_•
        And  the culmination of the production of some financial information that simply enables you to ensure  that you can meet those goals  in that coming year  if you choose to do so. •_•
        So at the Annual, Annual General Meeting  it was conducted , very much in the same way as before  presenting the previous year's activities  but this time, we presented a budget! •_•
        Very similar to the example that Bill  provided  in his hand outs. •_•
        We listed our expenditure  his forecast  we used the forecast based on experience and inflation. •_•
        Some of them are at best guesses! •_•
        But then you foil a new project to your expenditure and say look  if you want to do these  as indeed, you've expressed  then it's going to cost you so much. •_•
        If you get that agreement there  one hopes you get that commitment. •_•
        On a technicality the , the treasurer can still control it. •_•
        He can measure every clause of what the income is , against what the expenditure is  so that we have some control  to ensure  that the church life grows  and we don't stumble. •_•
        So, we have true growth. •_•
        What are, finally, what are the benefits that we've seen here? •_•
        Well  if there's a commercial activity you could argue that  but , in the , context of the church  what have we achieved? •_•
        We have focus  we have a direction  we maintain the fiscal control  we are aware of what we're doing as a church  we have the  the members commitment  indeed, we have their involvement  in what we want to do. •_•
        It is future planning  it is growth  it is commended to you all. •_•
        And I'd like to leave you with one last statement  just enough, but just enough, is not enough! •_•
        Thank you. •_•
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*GET:	We're going to   now  from  first of all  I'll say it in order and then you can come up  . •_•
        Jean  from South Wales, come on Jean! •_•
        Then Russell  from East Wales  then Henry  for North Wales  then    from West Wales  and Becky  from Mid-Wales. •_•
        Can you remember your names? •_•
        Your, •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	Okay? •_•
        Right! •_•
        It's going to be •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*GET:	Jean, you've got the floor for ten minutes! •_•
*UNK:	Oh! •_•
*GET:	Jean    . •_•
*UNK:	Er, I'm Jean  from Merthyr Tydfil  and I'm the secretary  on the committee. •_•
        Within the South Wales district  the question education can always, as well as trying to  help and support  carry I've worked in  junior churches and  many more education  churches. •_•
        It's very much concerned  with the training and Ministry of Elders  and a few weeks ago  a part of our programme  we held a very successful and lively meeting  on the subject of church membership. •_•
        It was initiated by one of our ministers  erm, who felt it would be useful for churches to share  er, their procedures for  preparation for church membership. •_•
        As he said, I know what I do with my congregation  but how do others  er, approach the subject? •_•
        Under the leadership of the Reverend Kenneth   this meeting developed into a much wider consideration  of the leaning and significance of church membership. •_•
        Does it begin with infant baptism? •_•
        Are all children and , and adults who have been baptised  members of the church?is not or you'll be actually encouraged  or pressured  to misinterpret the membership  or should we wait for them to be informed  er er, to wait for them to, to feel the ? •_•
        One or two elders   confessed that they have not been baptised! •_•
        And others were not sure whether they had! •_•
        So what about them? •_•
        We realise that this is a subject  which warrants much  consideration, as we think about the life and reverence of our churches  and look to the future for . •_•
        And we hope that our district will continue to be, be aware  of ways in, in which we may help elders and  churches in their ministry. •_•
*UNK:	Thank you. •_•
        Russell? •_•
*GET:	Russell , East Wales district. •_•
        Erm  I'd like to tell you a story  about  a vision of Ministry in East Wales. •_•
        When I'm about to tell  you a story, I thought to myself well  stories that Jesus used to tell were parables  and when I looked at them in the bible  they had a kingdom meaning to them. •_•
        And I thought to myself  yes, I'll tell you a story! •_•
        I'll tell you a story about  a place I went •_•
