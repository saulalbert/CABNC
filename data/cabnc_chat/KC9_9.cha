        No we do one like this, in this  colour, Pyrex but a big one . •562502_566622•
*GIN:	Oh that's alright. •566622_567272•

        One point five quarts. •591652_593532•
*DIN:	What's that in English? •593532_594382•
*GIN:	Well one quart is two pints. •594382_596242•
        And a half a quart is one pint. •596242_597952•
*DIN:	Right. •597952_598142•
*GIN:	That'd make it the three pints. •598202_599972•
*VIC:	So you'd want the next one up wouldn't you? •599972_601762•
        That would be that one. •601772_602082•
*DIN:	Well it's a three or four pints she's after. •602082_603592•
        It's probably a four   •603602_604372•
*GIN:	It doesn't look big enough. •604372_605442•
        Are you sure it says one point five quarts? •605502_608102•

*VIC:	one point five quart. •609472_611032•
*GIN:	Well. •611032_611292•
        Perhaps it's  perhaps they hold more than you think they do. •611442_617662•
*DIN:	I don't know.. •617692_619442•
*GIN:	What do you think Dinda? •619452_625572•
        Should I take this one? •625572_626632•
        While  •626632_626822•
*DIN:	Erm  •626822_627112•
*GIN:	they've still got it. •627572_628112•
        It's the last one. •628112_628802•
*DIN:	It's not chipped or anything is it? •628802_633312•
*GIN:	No. •635602_635662•
*DIN:	I've got my hands full and you've got your hands full. •635662_637642•

        See we might not get one more in before Christmas. •645652_648552•
*VIC:	I'll ask Gill and Maureen •648552_651212•
*GIN:	Mm. •651212_651402•
*VIC:	take that but then if you, if you really don't think that will hold what you want then you'll have to bring it back. •651402_656942•
*GIN:	It's a, it's a, it's a Christmas present . •656942_657862•
*VIC:	Oh I see yeah. •657902_658922•
        Ah. •658922_659002•
*GIN:	Three to four pints she said. •659002_661052•
*DIN:	That looks  yeah looking at it •661052_666302•
*VIC:	I think it   •666302_666762•
*GIN:	It's quite capacious, actually. •666762_667492•
*VIC:	Yeah. •667492_667992•
        I think •667992_668302•
*GIN:	It's a nice dish. •670152_675322•
*VIC:	Have you  we haven't got a measuring jug. •675322_677642•
*GIN:	Haven't got any what? •677642_679132•
*VIC:	That is right isn't it? •679132_680062•
        One pint is •680072_680442•
*GIN:	Well a quart is two pints. •680612_682462•
*VIC:	Yeah. •682462_682612•
*GIN:	And point five of a quart is one pint. •682612_684802•
        That makes it three pints. •684832_686672•
        Why they can't put three pints on instead of one point five quarts . •686672_689312•
*VIC:	But does she want a three to four one? •689312_690792•
        If she wants a three to four you gotta have the next size up. •690852_693092•
*GIN:	Three stroke four •693092_693542•
*DIN:	Well she said  three or four. •693542_694612•
*VIC:	Oh I see. •694612_694822•
*GIN:	so obviously she was easy about the size. •694822_696112•
*DIN:	I think that would be ample cos usually there's only two of them  •696112_699952•
*GIN:	There's only two of them, yes  •699952_700992•
*DIN:	to eat anything you know  •701152_702492•
*GIN:	yes, yes. •702492_703102•
        True. •703282_703452•
*DIN:	Yeah I think we should grab it while we see it actually. •703472_705542•
*GIN:	I think we should too. •705542_706222•
        It'll be half the price it is in Boot's Cookshop . •706222_708682•
*DIN:	Do you want me  Do you want me to drop it or should you drop it? •708682_710652•

*GIN:	Yes. •715842_715942•
        And that that one holds quite a lot •715952_717362•
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*DIN:	No. •717362_717412•
        No. •717412_717742•
*GIN:	Do you remember Jackie? •717742_718902•
        He used to be dark haired and worked in the  toy shop in Sandhurst. •718902_721842•
*DIN:	Yes I do. •721922_723442•
*GIN:	Yeah I thought you would. •723442_724702•
*DIN:	I knew the face. •724702_725122•
*GIN:	Used to go in for your model paints and  coloured marbles •725122_727012•
*VIC:	That's right, yeah. •728152_729842•
*DIN:	There you go. •730092_731092•
        Long time, long time ago. •731092_731832•
*VIC:	All those years I was there  •731832_732922•
*GIN:	You haven't, haven't changed . •732922_733612•
        You haven't changed. •733622_734842•
        I mean your face I knew straight out. •734852_736042•
        It was your hair that got me. •736042_737272•
*VIC:	Well the grey come through and I was just sort of I thought I can't wait all those years  with dark hair. •737272_743562•
        I had a friend who had long hair and she, she let it grow right the way through. •743562_747982•
        And for nearly seven years she looked like an old woman of eighty. •747982_751522•
*GIN:	Yes. •751522_751582•
*VIC:	And I thought I am not gonna have that. •751582_753302•
*GIN:	Well that's right. •753342_754592•
        I agree with you. •754602_755212•
*VIC:	So  I more or less had a crew cut. •755212_756562•
*GIN:	Yes. •756612_756892•
*VIC:	And er of course it's still grey now •756892_759812•
*GIN:	Yes. •759842_760182•
*VIC:	except like this bit here which er grows   •760182_762302•
*GIN:	I know, oh yes it always grows a dark bit. •762512_764072•
*VIC:	but that all took  I think, when you're older  when you go grey it's, it, you look softer and you get away with the grey coming through on white hair. •764072_770802•
*GIN:	Yes. •770802_771042•
        That's right. •771042_771392•
*VIC:	But on dark hair. •771402_771862•
        I mean for years when I was young I was jet black and that was lovely. •771862_774652•
*GIN:	Yes. •774692_774842•
        That's right. •774842_775252•
        You were. •775262_775402•
*VIC:	I never had to touch it or nothing. •775402_776392•
        But when you start going grey you look so •776392_778392•
*GIN:	It's pepper and salt then. •778392_779532•
*VIC:	And your skin changes. •779532_780172•
        I used to be right tanned skin. •780172_781832•
        And that, that even changes as you get older. •782002_784162•
*DIN:	Yeah that's right. •784162_785372•
*GIN:	Yes well I, I was very fair to start with. •785382_786962•
*VIC:	Yeah. •786962_787322•
*GIN:	And then it began to get a bit darker. •787352_789182•
        Not my eyelashes and eyebrows they're silver. •789182_791262•
        Always silver. •791272_791642•
        Absolutely silver. •791952_793032•
*VIC:	Mine are  yeah, dark still. •793342_794602•
*GIN:	But my, I thought no I'm not gonna go pepper and salt. •794952_796822•
*VIC:	That's right yeah. •796822_797482•
*GIN:	I don't mind going silver. •797482_798132•
*VIC:	That's right. •798132_798992•
*GIN:	This is natural silver on the temples. •799002_800282•

*VIC:	I mean I've got, I mean I don't mind this but  why shouldn't you do it? •803452_806932•
        And my friend she looked about eighty   •806932_808372•
*GIN:	Yes I couldn't agree with you more  •808372_810332•
*VIC:	but she still looks old for her age. •810332_812202•
*GIN:	Yes. •812372_812432•
        My best friend was your colouring and she always has a  rinse. •812532_816852•
        It's her husband. •816852_818152•
        She said I don't mind going grey but, but Paddy objects because he says it makes him feel old. •818482_822852•
*VIC:	Oh. •822952_823092•
        But the thing is  •823092_824072•
*GIN:	He' my colouring. •824072_824822•
*VIC:	also as well when you're black and you touch it up black when you're old you look hard. •824822_828542•

*VIC:	yeah. •830432_830552•
*GIN:	They usually say go to chestnut rather than keep to black. •830552_833962•

        So I wouldn't know love. •840972_842562•
