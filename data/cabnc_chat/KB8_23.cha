*DOR:	Right
*ANN:	I found that yesterday in the erm   (.) doll's pram.
*DOR:	I was gonna ask a favour, if you don't mind for tonight.
*ANN:	Yeah?
*DOR:	Would you mind having the boys for about half an hour because I would like to get Bryony's hair cut.I want about three or four inches off the bottom 
*ANN:	Mhm 
*DOR:	and I think she's gonna have an absolute screaming fit.
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) Where're you taking her?
*DOR:	Probably to the one at Staffhill if I could have an, if I can get an appointment booked.
*ANN:	Yeah 
*DOR:	It's just that, well you can imagine what she's gonna be like.But she screams so much when she gets her hair cut and she won't have 
*ANN:	I know.
*DOR:	it tied back.So even though I'd like 
*ANN:	I still haven't given, that's reminded me seeing Shona there, I, I don't think I've given her that pair of trousers and the sweatshirt and I told her that I've got them.I must look for them.
*DOR:	Right, so that'd be lovely if you don't mind having them after school.
*ANN:	Right, I'll get you these er
*DOR:	Oh I'll pick them up   (        ) if you like, cos I'm gonna go and see if I can get my shoes  (        ) 
*ANN:	Alright, well I'll, I'll give you them now cos they're here in the car.
*DOR:	Oh right!
*ANN:	I've got I've got them with me.That's erm the card with teddy bears on that Bryony wanted that she kept me 
*DOR:	Oh right last night.
*ANN:	she kept meaning to take home and kept forgetting.
*DOR:	 (        ) isn't it?
*ANN:	It is, yes.Oh she loved it.She carried it all around on er Tuesday.Right, there are your videos.
*DOR:	Right, thanks.The children have been difficult this weekend I don't know what's a matter with them, I think they're just
*ANN:	Well, the er th they seem to   (.) Richard seemed to cry a bit more or a bit easier, you know, if he bumped himself and Bryony, and I think it was, well Bryony it seemed to be a heavy cold that was making her feel miserable.
*DOR:	Yes
*ANN:	And I think maybe it was with all of them.They were just slightly under the weather.
*DOR:	And Martin has taught them to say you stupid zombie.
*ANN:	Oh great!Oh great! ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	I know, that's I'm really pleased about that.
*ANN:	Oh dear!
*DOR:	So James is going around calling everybody a stupid zombie.
*ANN:	Oh well, it makes a change from a   [laughing] stupid idiot  [] 
*DOR:	I know.It's gonna be wonderful at nursery if he goes straight up to his teacher again.
*ANN:	Oh.
*DOR:	Oh heck.
*ANN:	Again?Why?
*DOR:	You know when she told him to close the cupboard?
*ANN:	No.
*DOR:	At nursery?
*ANN:	No.
*DOR:	She was, he was going in her cupboard, Mrs  I gather he said you stupid idiot to her. ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Oh dear!Oh what a start on your first visit 
*DOR:	I know 
*ANN:	or   [laughing] a good impression  [] .
*DOR:	I know.I think that's part of the reason why she said you've got your hands   [laughing] full  [] .
*ANN:	I heard her say you've got your hands full but I didn't know why.Oh, hey.
*DOR:	And then with Richard having the screaming fits when it was time to go home.
*ANN:	Ah but that, that 
*DOR:	Very reluctant.
*ANN:	that was a good sign wasn't it?He was screaming because he had to go   [laughing] home  [] .

*ANN:	Well they're not. (.) But if they're not feeling quite well what can you expect?
*DOR:	Mm.
