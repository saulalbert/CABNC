@Comment:	conversation #11 (Tape 040804)
*FRA:	Well they seem quite tempted. •564225_565495•
*STE:	I can't remember what their names were, did you get their names again? •565495_568695•
*FRA:	No I didn't. •568845_569415•
        I know it was Princetown T V but •569515_571915•
*STE:	Yeah. •571915_572175•
*FRA:	Probably serve the prison I should think. •573675_575175•
        Well I must remember to memorize this this time. •575725_596915•
        Lovely tube on this innit? •604065_605125•
*STE:	They're pretty good sets aren't they? •605255_606855•
        Yeah. •606855_606915•
*FRA:	I should think it must be that one there or   James Wattana  •606915_618155•
*STE:	Fancy living here in preference to   •621675_623065•
*FRA:	Yeah! •623105_623655•
        He must be doing very well over here. •623955_627415•
        Very delicate. •627925_628575•
        Don't suppose he's  in his part time. •634225_639215•
*STE:	No. •639925_640235•
*FRA:	Cor he is good, there's no doubt about that, look at that, right between the two. •642735_646215•
        Whoops •646635_647145•
*STE:	Ooh! •647145_647225•
*FRA:	oh dear. •647935_648485•
        Cor  •649005_649375•
*STE:	Mm. •659875_660265•
*FRA:	Excellent. •663705_664435•
        I know Jackie  said well you shouldn't, you should try the Toshibas they're as good as gold those are. •664885_671156•
*STE:	Telling the truth there. •671186_672986•
*FRA:	It's er Hitachis are the ones he didn't er rate at all. •674946_677496•
*STE:	Oh yeah? •677836_678086•
        Hitachi as well I think. •678906_681256•
        That's a duffer innit? •681256_681936•
*FRA:	Yeah  •684216_684276•
*STE:	Still if we move them on  fifty five quid I reckon  nice set that'll tempt somebody. •684276_687736•
*FRA:	Yeah. •687866_687996•
*STE:	Or we could buy another one  then don't we? •687996_691396•
*FRA:	Yeah. •691396_691606•
        Right  Oh that's right, that's what I ordered off Eddy today, two S D seventeen ten. •701316_714376•
*STE:	Yeah. •715366_715426•
*FRA:	That one. •715476_715766•
*STE:	Quite a good set. •716086_717466•
*FRA:	Mm. •717746_718056•
        No I think I can probably make one out of two of those. •719456_721306•
*STE:	Well we'll get three of them, that price. •723676_725736•
*FRA:	Getting these done aren't we, gradually? •729286_730576•
*STE:	Yeah   •731446_731766•
*FRA:	The non-working stuff. •731796_732366•
*STE:	it helps dunnit? •732366_733436•
*FRA:	Yeah. •733616_733766•
*STE:	I mean some of these you ain't even looked at, the Panasonic and things like that, it might be •733896_737916•
*FRA:	Yeah •738006_738096•
*STE:	something simple. •739056_739626•
*FRA:	it's a bit long in the tooth that one. •739626_741026•
        Still it's worth a look probably. •741026_742166•
*STE:	It's thirty quid innit, to somebody like Jack ? •742226_744866•
*FRA:	Yeah. •744866_745066•
        Looked at the Sony  that needs erm    •745829_748329•
*STE:	Er a tuning fault or something innit? •748329_751249•
*FRA:	Yeah it's just got erm  blank  in it. •751329_754939•
        That's another Hitachi isn't it down there the same as we've got over there? •754939_771029•
*STE:	Oh yeah. •775379_775669•
        F S T Tosh there as well. •775669_780769•
        Shouldn't be too serious should it? •781139_783439•
*FRA:	We haven't looked at that have we, that one? •783439_784499•
        I'm not sure. •784499_785439•
*STE:	Don't know. •785439_785779•
*FRA:	Or is that the one that has got the burnt out bits in it? •785859_790359•
*STE:	But I can clear these out for ninety quid apiece I think I'd move them just to get rid of them don't you? •790359_839559•
*FRA:	Yeah. •851829_852059•
        Yeah. •853019_853319•
        He lives in Bradford, my goodness what a choice. •853439_892639•
        James Wattana  •892639_896739•
*STE:	In Bradford now is he? •896739_898739•
*FRA:	Yeah. •898879_899029•
        Must like the food up there I should think. •899029_907369•
        Ah that was a brave shot. •907369_909719•
*STE:	Well   they don't have a  test signal then. •910229_936899•
*FRA:	Mm. •938979_939089•
        Seems to have a bit of a  •942079_944159•
*STE:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Tried a tape in it? •944159_947849•
*STE:	No. •947849_948019•
*FRA:	Just for a joke. •948389_953759•
*STE:	Just sending out a pulse on them   stopped there. •953979_974189•
*FRA:	You can always  the tape    It's actually running. •974189_996499•
        That mains lead in front of you  wants plugging in. •998119_102902•
*STE:	Ah. •102902_102909•
        Ah right. •102909_102927•
        Stop, stop, stop •102980_103212•
*FRA:	Mm. •103226_103243•
        I really should er phone Breezy up and call his bluff and find out  •103243_103491•
*STE:	Which of these is  tuner? •103491_103703•
*FRA:	That's it. •103707_103784•
        Yeah you run the tape don't you to tune these in. •103865_104285•
        Run it without a tape I think it is to get the test signal. •104285_104626•
        Still  •104626_104655•
*STE:	Oh is it? •104675_104719•
*FRA:	you'll find it that way anyway won't you? •104719_104880•
*STE:	Should go all the way up and then back down shouldn't it? •104880_106317•
*FRA:	Yeah they do no they do go round. •106317_106496•
        Pretty sure they do anyway,Blinking slow innit that direction? •106496_108883•
        Or is it blinks fast in the other direction? •108883_109209•
*STE:	Oh I see. •109209_109417•
        Ah. •109420_109433•
*FRA:	One of them is a fast tune. •109565_109830•
        That's it, that's fast tune. •109830_110023•
