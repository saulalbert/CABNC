@Comment:	conversation #9 (Tape 040802)
*STE:	That must be the   (.) the right hand set for that   (        ) because   (.) two five five R seven B, the R is remote innit?All the others are T for    (.)  (        ) 
*FRA:	Oh yeah?
*STE:	aren't they?
*FRA:	Yeah. (.) Yet we   (        ) didn't we?So it was the wrong back then, probably. (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) wrote to them   (        ) complaints and
*FRA:	No.
*STE:	 (        ) they switched on alright anyway  (        ) .Right do you want  (        ) ?
*FRA:	Well I've tried all those, I'll see what   (.) switches on, just do one more.
*STE:	Cos the tuner se seems to be working itself dunnit   (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah I mean I assume it's the same tube in this as the er Grundig innit?
*STE:	Is it?
*FRA:	Yeah.It's a   (        ) innit?Er 
*STE:	Oh 
*FRA:	 (        )  (.) 
*STE:	Mind you I think the Grundig was a little    (.)  (        ) might require a
*FRA:	Yeah.But this is only a basic set so I mean we'll know when there's a tube    (.)  (        ) yeah  (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) seventy five and this is a basic  (        ) ?
*FRA:	Yeah. (.) Let's try a different number  (        ) 
*STE:	Tried a different number  (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah yeah
*STE:	Yeah I thought maybe number one was worn out and  (.) 
*FRA:	Yeah, it's a knackered tuner innit? (.) Oh colour's gone, why's that?
*STE:	 (        ) blank screen then for a sec. (.) 
*FRA:	Oh, that's where they   (.) that's where they are innit, round there. (.) It's either that or   (        )  (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) ?
*FRA:	No it's a little erm   (.) well I should think it's gonna be the tuner innit? (.) Mm 
*STE:	 (        ) sixty quid and one tuner, I mean you know   (.) don't mind if it's just 
*FRA:	Yeah 
*STE:	a couple of quid on them do you?And they go nice and 
*FRA:	No 
*STE:	quick.
*FRA:	Mind you it's had some spillage in here in the I F strip.Ah   (.) oh yes it has.Lots of spillage, that's probably the problem. (.) Yeah you see it   (.) you see it all round the chips
*STE:	Oh yeah, yeah   (        ) on it, yeah yeah 
*FRA:	all green, all green along there   (.) I wonder   (.) I was just thinking it's got all the bits in it to make that other one go
*STE:	It's still switched on so   (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	No it's, it's got all the power bits to make that other one go.It's got a tube that would make the   (.) the other one go.Dunno. (.) But it's losing a set that way innit? (.) 
*STE:	See the tube for the Grundig I think   (.) it won't help   (        ) 
*FRA:	No be worth trying won't it?Mm.
*STE:	And I could get   (        ) fifty five or sixty for this   (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah.
*STE:	won't tune   (.) and erm   (        ) 
*FRA:	Well I'll tr I'll try cleaning up that spillage.
*STE:	Shall I do it with a toothbrush and a  (.) ?
*FRA:	You can if you like, yeah,i it pulls out, you know, you can get at it.
*STE:	 (        ) innit?
*FRA:	Yeah.Yeah it's not underneath it's just   (.) you can take that out the way 
*STE:	 (        )  (.) Well there's twelve hundred quid in there.
*FRA:	Mm! (.) Well   (        ) a little drink  (        ) 
*STE:	All in cash.
*FRA:	Very good.Old Rex, I see he had a pile of fifties there. (.)

*FRA:	Hmm.
*STE:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	He did s yeah he did speak to her.
*STE:	Yeah?
*FRA:	Yeah. (.) 
*STE:	Well I've seen the toothbrush somewhere recently but I'm buggered if I can remember where.It's not on my desk   (        ) 
*FRA:	 (        ) Mike  will be useful next time he comes up to erm he probably knows how to connect those   (.) extension wires into th on the telephone doesn't he?
*STE:	Oh I should think so, yeah. (.) 
*FRA:	Do you want anything else to drink or are you alright for a bit?
*STE:	No thank you I'm fine. (.) 
*FRA:	Thought I'd leave that little erm portable running   (.) this afternoon.
*STE:	Yeah. (.) 
*FRA:	Nice little tube in that one innit? (.)  (        ) always good aren't they, as a rule?
*STE:	Yep. (        ) last night   (.)  (        ) 
*FRA:	And those last three portables, he talked me into those going out the door.Jim that was. (.) It won't happen again.
*STE:	 [laughing] No  [] .I don't know though, I don't think they're quite as busy as er they profess to be.
*FRA:	No   (.) not after that conversation yesterday. (.) 
*STE:	 (        )

*FRA:	Yeah. (.) 
*STE:	There's a, one of them little   (.) it's probably meant to be that colour, one of them little clay coloured things has got a black end on it there but er  (.) 
*FRA:	Oh yeah that's just erm

*FRA:	This little erm   (.) Sanyo I've got on the bench in here, I think we'll just keep that for spares then. (.) 
*STE:	Right. (        ) that, it's funny innit? (.) Oh  (.) 
*FRA:	Yeah, have a think about that one. (.) 
*STE:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Two little switches  (.) 
*STE:	That one the tuner just keeps hunting so maybe the aerial cable's not connected to the   (.) tuner, we had one of them before didn't we, where they?
*FRA:	Yeah yeah   (.) I'll just box this Sanyo up   (        ) out that way.
