@Comment:	conversation #21 (Tape 049307)
*UNK:	No wonder they're expensive! Take about   (.) over twelve months to   (.) you know, to sort of come to even leaf    (.)  (  ) leaves.
*ART:	Yes, but we've had several frosty weeks ain't we?
*EVE:	I know, but the   (.) on the kitchen window sill, I take them off
	at night. Should be alright. Well they are alright. But, the old
	ones that Tom gave me originally   (.) they've not flowered now for
	about   (.) three months   (.) yet they're not dead.
*ART: 	I've been figuring out S, A and B,wha  why   (.) you ha  , you have
	to start, you know, then I realise it's   (.) but you gotta put it
	in the way it's ready to er   (.) record  haven't
*EVE:	 Mm.
*ART:	you?
*EVE:	Is it opposite to the one we've  got
*ART:	 Mm.
*EVE:	there?
*ART:	It's not, it's not on the
*EVE:	 Oh well that's what  I said, it was no use, bothering
*ART:	  (  )
*EVE:	there's no use bothering to   (.) how ours worked   (.) you've got
	to sort of know how this one works.
*ART:	Well it's nothing to do with the working really,ma  , it's the fact that they   (.) with A facing you   (.) the spool is ready to run.
*EVE:	Yeah.
*ART: 	And then, put it the other way i  if there were nothing that side
	you'd have to put it on B because that's ready to run.
*EVE:	Mm.
*ART:	It depends on which side you start you see.
*EVE:	Well they say always start on A don't  they?
*ART:	 Oh!  Well I  mean it's nothing to do with the
*EVE:	 I mean you are now   (  )
*ART:	mechanism of it, so
*EVE:	 No.
*ART:	the fact whether, one side is full, the spool you're going to wind on is right for recording.
*EVE:	Mm.
*ART:	 Ah, and like
*EVE:	 Well we always  do ours on A for a start don't we?
*ART:	Mm.
*EVE:	You do don't you? I don't know, I never do ours.  (9.0) Anyway, are you very hungry?
*ART:	Mm. Not hungry at all really, I
*EVE:	 Well you  should be!
*ART:	such a big  breakfast.
*EVE:	 You didn't  have a big breakfast today! You only had a boiled egg and   (.) flakes.
*ART:	Well, you know what my landlady said   (.) if you want something substantial I'll boil you and egg.
*EVE:	 ((laughing)) Oh well ! This was about forty years ago!
*ART:	They we  , they were doing three days a week   (.) in the  town.
*EVE:	 Times  were hard then.
*ART:	Yeah.
*EVE:	And pe  , people did take in lodgers didn't they?
*ART:	Mm.
*EVE:	To make ends meet.  Keeps everybody   (  ) together.
*ART:	 That's, that's that's what Kath  thought.
*EVE:	No!
*ART:	We were having to make ends meet.
*EVE:	What have you got to worry about?
*ART:	Well I'm saying what  Kath's
*EVE:	 Yeah.
*ART:	worrying about, not what  I'm worrying about!
*EVE:	 Kath's not worrying about  us, she knows we've got plenty.
*ART:	Well
*EVE:	Or efficient.
*ART:	Why did she say that?
*EVE:	It was a joke!
*ART:	Oh.  She had the
*EVE:	Like you joke!  You joke and yet, you can't  take a joke!
*ART:	Yes, but  Kath's jokes have a sharp  cutting edge
*EVE:	No they haven't
*ART:	to them.
*EVE:	No they haven't! You
*ART:	My jokes are soft and  er
*EVE:	((laughing)) Ooh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh ! They're not! Your prejudiced you
	are!  (7.0) And I have, I think I made mine a bit strong!  (6.0) I
	tell you, if I have a drink, when I have a drink, a short in the
	morning   (.) it goes to my head, it's   (.) not  (  ) .
*ART:   There used to be a cafe, a cute; (.) the er   (.) you used to go in
	and have a cup of tea and that   (.) and yo  , he started selling
	jam, pots of jam with   (.) they had him in court, it was er   (.)
	it had fell off a lorry and he was selling it a bit cheap   (.) and
	er   (.) he were telling us about it. I says, what th  , he said, he
	said, well I've   (.) I told the judge everybody's got two jobs, he
	says   (.) he said to the judge, you've got two jobs. Course he were
	right weren't he!
*EVE:	Why? How had he got two jobs?
*ART:	Well they wanted to know why   (.) as he was just running a cafe, a
	cute; why he was selling  jams.
*EVE:	 Oh  I see.
*ART:	Of course, where did he get the jam from? It fell off the lorry  (
	) .  (9.0) I thought they'd find them sixty odd  (  ) . About er,
	redecorated Mrs   house. Put
*EVE:	Mm mm.
*ART:	chair rail up and encruster. It wouldn't stick. Saturday afternoon,
	I ought to have been at home   (.) it was three o'clock and I should
	have been at er, in Leicester then. There I was trying to get the
	encruster to stick. A  and then there were no trains. I got home
	about nine at night. Things I'll do for people!  (8.0) Oh it was
	useless!
*EVE:	You'll  have to start doing a few jobs for me  next week.

*EVE:	She looked  after
*ART:	 things.
*EVE:	you well.
*ART:	I were there about eight years ago. (  )
*EVE:	No. How long will that cupboard door take? I've got   (.) I've only
	got one door on that cupboard. That  sliding door.
*ART:	 Oh, the  sliding door! Oh that just wants fitting that's all.
*EVE:	I know that! One side's open to the
*ART:	Atmosphere. Well, gotta be easy one hand you get  the pots in.
*EVE:	No, well I  li  I like the two on.
*ART:	Yes.
*EVE:	I like the two on to cover i  things up, the   (.) jams one side
	and the pots the other.  (7.0) I think when we go in town I'll get
	another   (.) lot of seville oranges   (.) make another lot. Well I
	want some jars thou  , though before I can. So we've got to go to
	Maggie's or Kath's and get some.
