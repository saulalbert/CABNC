*LUC:	It had Steve Martin in it, it's a comedy
*TER:	Yeah
*LUC:	it's called Father of the Bride and it's about this wedding kind of thing
*TER:	Oh, er, I, I have to plead my ignorance I don't even know who Steve Martin is. ((laugh)) Well how can we help today?
*LUC:	I finished this book
*TER:	Did you?
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	Good   (.) so let's see what you did, who did you go to the pictures with?
*LUC:	Oh my friend Emma
*TER:	Emma? (.) So where did you go from here?
*LUC:	Yeah, where it starts in the pen
*TER:	Where it starts in the pen   (.) mm   (.) what was it? (.) Right   (.) right, so let us see what we can do shall we?Erm where do we start?
*LUC:	I need a
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	there yeah,
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	E two, now you've got to work out the average speed, right   (.) try and think roughly what the answer would be, because if you thought of that, then you would know that's a silly answer, cos look, how far is the journey?
*LUC:	A hundred and twenty miles
*TER:	Right, well say, a nice, you know just to the nearest, to the nearest erm whole number
*LUC:	A hundred 
*TER:	Right 
*LUC:	and twenty seven miles
*TER:	A hundred and twenty seven, what's that to the nearest hour?
*LUC:	Two hours
*TER:	Right, so if it goes say a hundred and twenty six miles   (.) or a hundred and twenty miles, to the nearest ten miles, it goes a hundred and twenty miles in two hours   (.) how far would it go in one hour?
*LUC:	Sixty
*TER:	Right, sixty   (.) so that can't be right can it?Right, so how are you gonna find the average speed, what do you do to find that average speed?You divide what by what?
*LUC:	Divide that by that
*TER:	Right, but, what are you gonna divide that by on a calculator?
*LUC:	Two point twelve
*TER:	No, this is the whole thing isn't it?Don't you remember look   (.) if there were a hundred minutes in an hour that would be two point one two, but there's not a hundred minutes in an hour are there?How many minutes are there in an hour?
*LUC:	Sixty
*TER:	Right, now look, it says there, so what's twelve minutes?
*LUC:	Nought point two
*TER:	Right, so what are you gonna divide that by to get the average speed?
*LUC:	Twelve point two
*TER:	No
*LUC:	Nought point  (.) 
*TER:	what's the time?
*LUC:	Erm two hours and twelve minutes
*TER:	Right, how do you write that as a decimal of an hour?What's two hours, twelve minutes?Look   (.) you've got two hours and you've got twelve minutes, now what fraction of an hour is twelve minutes?
*LUC:	Erm   (.) five
*TER:	No, what, twelve minutes is what fraction of an hour?
*LUC:	Oh, nought point two
*TER:	Right, so that equals the minutes is point two, how many hours?
*LUC:	Two
*TER:	So two hours, twelve minutes is two point two 
*LUC:	Two 
*TER:	hours
*LUC:	Yeah
*TER:	Right, so to find the average speed what you gonna do?
*LUC:	Two hours divided by
*TER:	Right, but and what that by 
*LUC:	That divide by that
*TER:	divide, come on say again
*LUC:	That
*TER:	That by, by what?
*LUC:	Two point two
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	Fifty eight  (.) 
*TER:	That's right   (.) right, well what about the next one?
*LUC:	Doesn't say
*TER:	Well how many minutes is it?
*LUC:	Nought point nine five
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	nought point nine five
*TER:	Where does fifty eight come?
*LUC:	There
*TER:	Does it?
*LUC:	No
*TER:	Right, there, so what are you gonna divide it by?
*LUC:	Mm
*TER:	That's nought point eight, nought point nine, nought point nine five, nought point nine
*LUC:	Six
*TER:	six and that's half way to it so that's nought point nine, six, five 
*LUC:	Five 
*TER:	Look, nought point nine, six, five and so you're gonna divide
*LUC:	Five
*TER:	you're gonna divide fifty point five   (.) by  (.) 
*LUC:	Fifty two
*TER:	Right   (.) right now D  (.) 
*LUC:	Well that one point two
*TER:	That's right  (.) 
*LUC:	forty two
*TER:	Right   (.) right, now, the next one
*LUC:	Er   (.) how you gonna take it out of it? (.) Three at, thirty nine
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	thirty nine  (.) 
*TER:	So what is it?
*LUC:	Two hours, thirty nine minutes
*TER:	Right, two hours, thirty nine, right  (.) 
*LUC:	Two point six, five
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	Seventy two
*TER:	Right  (.) 
*LUC:	I've got erm, how many hours and all this written down at home if you want me to bring that up
*TER:	Erm
*LUC:	write all the hours down 
*TER:	Yes you can do
