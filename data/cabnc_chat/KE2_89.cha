*MAR:	goes with that. •134125_152625•
*TER:	Yeah but what would you get with the two? •165425_183025•
*MAR:	With the two you get  Tesco's premium teabags, a hundred  plus Tesco's freeze dried gold coffee, two hundred grammes of that plus  packet of erm biscuits. •191425_428625•
        Well the teabags don't mean anything to us really   •437025_459925•
*TER:	Thought you said something about a chicken. •460225_473525•
*MAR:	Well that's if you get the, the next page  which means that you have to have twenty stamps in all. •476625_531925•
*TER:	Oh I see. •535625_542025•
*MAR:	You have to have four completed pages •542025_584425•
*TER:	Oh I see. •590025_594425•
*MAR:	and with that you would get erm •595625_623925•
*TER:	Oh well  •623925_629225•
*MAR:	I'm not likely to have that next week, that's  •629225_647725•
*TER:	No you won't get that, no. •647725_660225•
*MAR:	going to need •660225_669925•
*TER:	So you're looking at either these  chocolates or  well you don't want the premium teabags anyway •675225_750725•
*MAR:	No. •753625_754425•
        But then we don't use teabags do we? •754425_775225•
        I mean  •775225_776625•
*TER:	No. •776625_778525•
*MAR:	they could go to parish hall but I'm thinking to myself well  why bother? •778525_817925•
*TER:	Well you can always charge them, could always take the cash for that. •823625_858225•
*MAR:	But erm •880025_885525•
*TER:	So how much is the coffee? •894825_907225•
*MAR:	Well the coffee is what we got the other day. •917825_932025•
*TER:	Yeah that's about two fifty is it? •932025_946525•
*MAR:	Something like that, yeah. •948225_959125•
*TER:	And what else is  •972525_977425•
*MAR:	And I've got a spare one of those anyway haven't I? •977425_100052•
        I bought a spare one anyway. •100052_101162•
*TER:	Yeah. •101162_101442•
*MAR:	And you see other than that there's just the biscuits. •105232_107692•
*TER:	Yeah. •108592_108732•
*MAR:	And we've got plenty of biscuits there. •108732_110942•
        Premium teabags, a hundred and sixty  plus the freeze dried gold coffee  plus  erm Fox's  speciality selection biscuits. •114342_130642•
        With the four completed pages  you get a large frozen chicken er six pounds  six pounds four ounces plus  erm  party size, fourteen portions  black forest gateau  plus  a bottle of Bordeaux white wine. •134112_156012•
*TER:	Yes but you're never gonna get that, I mean that's  •157402_159022•

*TER:	So there's no, that's no point. •180942_182152•
*MAR:	No point. •182372_182772•
*TER:	It's really only a question of whether you get the extra one page or, or leave it as it is. •182772_187082•
