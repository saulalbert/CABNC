*PS05B:	Is there a lot of difference between fishing a in the evening . 
*PS05D:	I do n't know I 've not fished there in the evening yet . 
*PS05B:	That 's true . 
*PS05D:	This 'll be my first attempt I would imagine that it wo n't make a lot of difference I could be wrong . 
*PS05B:	Have you now learnt how to do this tying or do you have to go and see Terry every time . 
*PS05D:	Erm I think I 've learnt how to do it it 's fairly straightforward but er him having tied the leader on for me I wo n't have to go back to him anyway for quite some time . 
*PS05B:	So you were n't concentrating when you were watching with him . 
*PS05D:	I do n't think so th the point is I 'm not going to be called to tie a knot like this again for maybe three weeks and then by then I 'll make things up it was really more for convenience than sitting down trying to work it out myself so you know . 
*PS05B:	Is there not a book of angling knots . 
*PS05K:	It means there must places does n't it . 
*PS05D:	No he 's just practising at the moment lovey he 's practising his swing but I agree if he stood that distance he would n't be able to hit the ball would he would you . 
*PS05B:	It would n't reach it would it . 
*PS05D:	He 's right in the middle of the fairway though it 's a nice looking shot he 's got to play is n't it . 
*PS05K:	Mm .
