*HAY:	Egg diet? •166802_166827•
        I thought  •166827_166853•
*UNK:	Yes. •166853_166884•
*HAY:	they were fattening. •166884_166989•
*UNK:	No it wasn't just eggs though it was erm  like salads and there was steak, you could have one meal a day, right, but it was eggs for your breakfast, eggs for your dinner, your lunch •166989_167991•
*HAY:	Now I love eggs  but I thought eggs  •167991_168170•
*UNK:	and then it was salad  •168170_168216•
*HAY:	binded you. •168216_168238•
*UNK:	They do. •168251_168325•
        They do bind you •168355_168582•
*LYN:	But you'd have to take something to make you  •168582_168774•
*UNK:	but the thing is you can you eat fruit in between see Hayle so you're having  you know,your roughage. •168774_169233•

*UNK:	I tell you what I lost a stone and half in two weeks •169680_169933•
*LYN:	I used to have erm  •169933_170087•
*UNK:	by sticking to that. •170087_170143•
*LYN:	I'd get up in the morning I'd have my two pieces of wholemeal bread toasted with a scraping of marmalade on, right, and my butter cos I like that. •170143_170875•
        For my dinner then I'd have er jacket potato with tuna  then about four o'clock I would have an apple and an orange and maybe a Mars Bar cos  right. •170875_171758•
        And then before eight o'clock then I would make myself a big meal, I'd have a, a huge salad  I'd do tinned potatoes cos they were, on this diet tinned potatoes aren't fattening •171766_172785•
*HAY:	Aren't they? •172785_172868•
*UNK:	No they're not. •172868_172930•
*LYN:	No so I'd have tinned potatoes  •172930_172988•
*HAY:	I don't like them I don't like   •172988_173096•
*LYN:	I'd have tuna fish, I'd have ham, everything because you can eat as much meat  you could sit down and eat  cabbage, swedes, runner beans, cauliflower, peas  every vegetable  •173096_174028•
*DEB:	That's what I'm doing for him now. •174028_174215•
        But I don't like veg I don't. •174215_174314•
*LYN:	and that's not counted in your, in your calories, you can just eat that, it's all free so you can eat as much as you like of that. •174320_174777•
        Cos if I was really hungry I used to go upstairs, I'd get all the frozen veg out, I'd cook a bit of everything •174777_175302•
*HAY:	It's not so bad   •175302_175401•
*LYN:	I'd slam a pork chop under the grill and I'd just eat that. •175404_175758•
        And it used to fill me up and I'd  •175758_175958•
*UNK:	Yeah. •175958_175999•
*LYN:	that's nothing then, I could eat as much as that as I liked. •176002_176219•
        And bacon's not fattening grilled on this diet, you can eat as much bacon as you like as long as you cut the fat off and grill it. •176219_176856•
*DEB:	That's on this Slimming World diet is it? •176856_177007•
*LYN:	It's marvellous yeah, I lost weight on it. •177007_177219•
*DEB:	What we'll have to do Hayley right, when she starts now she'll have to tell us what she's eating every day  •177219_177723•
*LYN:	I've got a book in the house. •177723_177801•
