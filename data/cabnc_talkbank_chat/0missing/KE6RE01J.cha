*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah well I du n no do it all properly I must do all my bits and pieces tonight I have n't done them this week oh let's have a look at the poll tax because I thought there was one more I 'm sure there is . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Sandra was n't sure I do n't know I 'm sure there is . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah there is . 
*PS0X8:	turn on that and I 've done mine . 
*PS0X9:	But the kids are changed these days you know . 
*PS0X8:	The kids are what did you say . 
*PS0X9:	Changed . 
*PS0X8:	Well I do n't . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	not right is it . 
*PS0X9:	Like I would never of thought of . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	yeah what you talking about him next door Or thingy . 
*PS0X9:	Well both . 
*PS0X8:	Both but this one next door Bev is pushed from pillar to post . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	I mean . 
*PS0X9:	he wants loving . 
*PS0X8:	he 's a very kid where the mother 's got to go to work . 
*PS0X9:	he wants loving . 
*PS0X8:	and I mean let's face it if he is still with the old grandmother it 's that 's a different world as well in n it . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	But this kid goes haywire and a lot of them do I mean he 's all crash bang wallop is n't he There 's no . 
*PS0X9:	Wayne is though . 
*PS0X8:	Wayne yeah but she she was his neighbours and that do n't she That one down the road are n't they . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	And all that or at Betty 's or what have you I do n't think she 'd leave them with the mother-in-law . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	but she leaves them with the neighbours or a neighbour but I mean it 's all different to bringing them up yourself in n it Got ta be there a it 's a complex really because nobody will agree erm give bringing up a kid will they . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	Nobody and I do n't ever think people will bring up somebody else 's the same as they would their selves I I do n't think it 's possible for anybody to do it I mean look at Julia when she was a that childminder with that Kerry . 
*PS0X9:	No she did n't care . 
*PS0X8:	Julia did n't care a sod about that kid she 'd let her to scream on stand in the middle of the garden screaming indoors screaming and she said to me I have no feelings for her whatsoever but she took the bloody money every week and this is what 's so wrong nobody knows how she er was as that child only people like us who would hear . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	and all Julia wanted was more and more and more money there was a conflict on how many gran children she could have and sometimes she had five in there one of them which was then very small which she had to spend time feeding and that and that was Kerry . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	well those others three of those somebody else 's children plus her own ran total riot out in the garden but I mean there 's not enough people to come round and do spot checks even if they 're allowed I do n't know whether they 're allowed to but they 've . 
*PS0X9:	I do n't know if they can . 
*PS0X8:	No I do n't but nevertheless nobody knew only people like us and the neighbours how that kid was every day when her mother to the T S B and her mother according to Julia had her because it was the done thing her mother her own mother would n't have her Kerry to look after her and I know that for a fact because one time when Ross was ill Julia said I ca n't have her and she said oh god I suppose I 've got to go and beg my mother to have her now she did but the woman said to Julia I mean she would n't give up her job they had a four bedroomed house two bloody great cars eleven cats . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	and er I mean what she saw of Kerry was she dropped her here at quarter to nine she picked her up between five and half past and the rest of her she saw around kid the rest of the time she saw her own kid and er Julia was to have her until she went to school so I mean how can there be any bond there which there ca n't but the mother said herself I had her because it was the done thing so I mean it 's it 's today in n it do n't you think . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	I mean all that kid do was scream scream scream scream I mean Ross was n't the best one to be with cos he was selfish and of course in Julia 's eyes he never did any wrong but Kerry come off worse all the time and I said childminding is fine and it 's necessary but the people you know that that people ca n't know people and Julia was a spoilt brat so . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	I mean you must if you 're looking after a little girl you must in the end unless you 've low and detest children or unless you 're out purely and simply for the money I mean how can you . 
*PS0X9:	Not get a bond . 
*PS0X8:	well how can you not get somewhat attached to a child I mean of course there 's children you do n't like like adults you do n't like . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah but then you still if you see them every day . 
*PS0X8:	That 's what I mean . 
*PS0X9:	you get somewhat attached to them . 
*PS0X8:	Julia felt nothing for that child she did n't like her she did n't hate her I mean she she did n't she just felt nothing cos that 's precisely what she told me that 's her words not mine you know and I find then that she should n't be a childminder . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	that 's my instant reaction instant . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	that Julia wanted money more more money I mean he worked every hour that god gave at so his money must of been decent had to be . 
*PS0X9:	I do n't think daddy would of let them . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	oh I do n't know cos Julia was living with a bloke before that I do n't think they 'll of had any say in it . 
*PS0X9:	Oh . 
*PS0X8:	and from what I understood he was already married anyway never never was mentioned here but I did hear it whether it was true or not I 'm not say it but I was told that he was already married and divorced to marry her that was what I was told no I mean I do n't know but but I 'm damn sure that I know . 
*PS0X9:	I hope this fucking kid do n't play with that every day . 
*PS0X8:	That 's alright play with it there 's no point in saying anything to them Bev it 's now got to be proven and I say if I can get it done and I can get it sent off then they will point me in the right direction wo n't they . 
*PS0X9:	Oh yeah . 
*PS0X8:	That 's the that 's the whole point you you have to start somewhere yes I can give her a bit of paper yes she can throw it in the bin it 's made no difference in fact I think it 's getting worse since I spoke to her is n't it She 's had more people in there the dogs have been left more hours that . 
*PS0X9:	Ah that 's just her situation . 
*PS0X8:	Fair comment but this week she was on holiday did n't stop her and going and leaving them poor dogs in there barking their heads off and crying for seven and a half hours did it . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	I mean poor dogs and this I mean we 've said it all before it 's not viable four dogs and a semi that you do n't exercise four dogs that er appear particularly one of them to be housed in the same little area day in day out with a curtain on the door so that there 's not even light going in there . 
*PS0X9:	That 's so he ca n't see out in the garden . 
*PS0X8:	That 's what So that he ca n't see what 's going on cos she thinks if he do n't see what 's going on he wo n't bark but he cries but I mean she should n't have them there she 's never here so she should n't have them I mean look at the trouble Alan had to get Jessie because they worked but Emma goes home every lunch time to see to Jessie from the bank but I mean the woman one of them would n't let her have a dog one kennels which is how it should be but I mean this one breed those three herself so yeah I mean if you breed dogs yourself and you have three in the house of the same breed what the hell do you want an alsatian for as well but the whole point is she do n't have them as enjoyment she do n't have them as company . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah they 're just there . 
*PS0X8:	They 're their their animals that 's all like that chicken up the garden I mean I do n't know what it 's in might be in a run but being the place that is in behind that shed there ai n't that much space with a rabbit as well is there you know I mean there might be a run on the floor it 'll be crazy to have a run on the floor because she 's had rats . 
*PS0X9:	Oh . 
*PS0X8:	ai n't she . 
*PS0X9:	yeah . 
*PS0X8:	And she 's had rats under that shed it ai n't that long ago she said she said she had them so I mean I ca n't see anybody with an ounce of common sense letting a chicken being on the ground ground . 
*PS0X9:	Well no . 
*PS0X8:	who knows I do n't know I would n't but who knows You 're back to that situation of commonsense again ai n't you Wo n't she . 
*PS0X9:	Safe from . 
*PS0X8:	Safe from cuts good heavens . 
*PS0X9:	What . 
*PS0X8:	probably the er poll tax are . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	Right that was worth it were n't it I think oh he 's left out there his . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	Oh it 's bubbling away nice . 
*PS0X9:	Stir him again then . 
*PS0X8:	What again . 
*PS0X9:	It says stir occasionally . 
*PS0X8:	Oh watch that dish it 's a bit hot that dish right . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	no just towels good one right whip it out for me then please I 'll have to leave it there because some of this is still out there ta well that 's not bad time wise . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	Oh I bet these kids find this thrilling you know do n't you . 
*PS0X9:	God . 
*PS0X8:	Barking dogs next door barking dogs next door again so I shall plenty of material should n't we Subject to material . 
*PS0X9:	god yeah The annoying the most annoying thing about it . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0X9:	is is if she tries she can make it quiet in there . 
*PS0X8:	That 's what she 's supposed to do according to the Citizens Advice Bureau is to control them so that she do n't annoy the neighbours . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	Now Sunday when I had her about that terrific barking your father was the first to say look she stopped it . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	but she lets them bark on like she lets the kids scream on and that is today in n it I think basically what it comes down to it does n't bother her . 
*PS0X9:	So why should it . 
*PS0X8:	so she does n't care about anybody else . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	It ca n't bother her Bev because the amount of noise that we get through the walls is so bad and she 's in it she 's actually there with the animals barking so she takes no notice whatsoever of them . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	she 's probably bloody used to it after all the years she must of had them she tells . 
*PS0X9:	ca n't . 
*PS0X8:	she tells me they 're all old dogs . 
*PS0X9:	But dogs whatever age do n't . 
*PS0X8:	Well . 
*PS0X9:	make that noise . 
*PS0X8:	the way she said it that day was they 're old dogs they do n't need the exercise and they do n't bark that is the impression impression I got . 
*PS0X9:	It 's not true so . 
*PS0X8:	Now what 's that point to spend an afternoon here no point at all is there . 
*PS0X9:	Not a lot . 
*PS0X8:	Well there is n't any more is there . 
*PS0X9:	They wan na get that paper out . 
*PS0X8:	Sorry . 
*PS0X9:	Do you think that put that paper through the . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	what out in the garage . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	I du n no right let me do this and then I 'll have a look I mean I 've got to do this because I 'm not sure of it . 
*KE6PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	done now in n it . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	I would n't wan na do it tomorrow well only later afternoon but I mean if I have to put ear plugs in at night to get some sleep because of them surely the authorities have got ta say something about that . 
*PS0X9:	Well . 
*PS0X8:	well for god 's sake I mean I often wonder about people who make noise like this how they would feel if we did do the same but I still say because we 've done our polystyrene insulation she ca n't hear us it 's worked in the reverse ai n't it . 
*PS0X9:	Probably . 
*PS0X8:	Instead of us you know instead of it blocking out for our benefit I reckon it blocked out for their benefit somehow a hell of a lot of insulation in here . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	a hell of a lot really normally you would n't have the vinyl and normally I would think you would only put the tongue and groove not out of the polystyrene behind it and the vinyl I ca n't see why people want tongue and groove that they go to all those lengths would you . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	Well I do n't think so tongue and groove is is wood in n it I do n't know I mean I do n't know nothing about these things what really have to feel that we are the lot .
