*DAV:	No you've done •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*DAV:	you've done very well! •_•
        Haven't you really? •_•
        Your first  your first year. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah we did well but erm  we shouldn't have  like, you learn by your mistakes, but we  we kind of made profit and we shouldn't of done •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	erm, and now the tax man has hammered us so hard •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	that we're really struggling! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And we're really having to struggle to sort of make ends meet. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        I know what you mean. •_•
        You  it's a it's difficult  •_•
*ANN:	It's wrong int it? •_•
*DAV:	just striking up that balance int it? •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	Isn't it really? •_•
*ANN:	And of course, now they  when we originally moved in here we asked about the rates and they said oh they they wouldn't raise it because it was an unfinished project •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	and nobody had paid rates, and they wouldn't pay rates until they'd actually finished building on the land opposite. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Anyway, when the accountant came in to do the books  he said er, oh he said you've got to pay something. •_•
        So he said, I'll get onto them myself. •_•
        Anyway, apparently, he was told exactly the same thing as I was told •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	but of course, it had kind of stirred up a hornets' nest! •_•
        Next thing they were down with the measuring up and we'd just got a four thousand pound rate bill! •_•
        And, they've actually rated it at ten and a half thousand  erm  payable •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	three thousand eight, and of course, well Neil said there's V A T, I didn't think you had to pay V A T on rates? •_•
*DAV:	I didn't, I didn't, you know, I don't  •_•
*ANN:	You know? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Er  anyway  so that's sort of you know, made  •_•
*DAV:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	a big difference. •_•
        That's suddenly four thousand a year we've to find. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	I mean, if, it's crippling us is this place! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	If it wasn't for this we could be  it would be quite good. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But what can you do, there's nothing else about? •_•
*DAV:	No it's  that's it. •_•
        And a lot of businesses up and down are er  are in a bad way, really. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	Some very  sailing very close to the wind. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        They're all finding it hard aren't they? •_•
*DAV:	Well, there's less and less work  and the work that does seem to be about  is that competitively priced that  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	you know, it's negible whether you can make anything even if  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	you get the work. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        And then of course er  money is floating round very quickly. •_•
        No. •_•
        No. •_•
        I er, in fact, we, yeah, we just had a problem yesterday, we started work for the Royal Scotsman  and  erm  well we started work for them, like last year and we've been doing jobs •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	and we've had invoices outstanding since October. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	So Neil said, well  these invoices weren't forthcoming, so I said to them, the thing, the thing is, if we start work and we buy a load of equipment  how are we gonna  sort of, how long's the cheque gonna, gonna be coming in, you know. •_•
*DAV:	And you have to fund it. •_•
*ANN:	So we asked for twenty thousand pound upfront. •_•
*DAV:	Tt! •_•
*ANN:	So, anyway, and they said, and before we we get this twenty thousand we also want the October's invoices clearing up as well. •_•
        So, that was  great. •_•
        Anyway, we've waited and waited  we've rung and we've rung! •_•
        Eventually a cheque came, instead of being like, for six thousands er, nearly seven thousand it came for four! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Erm, the twenty thousand eventually arrived, no V A T. •_•
        You know •_•
*DAV:	Yes. •_•
*ANN:	and all this sort of things. •_•
        So, of course, we were getting a little bit panicky  cos what's worrying me, and it still worries me  again  we've put all this time and effort in  they may pay us  alright, we've got this twenty, they may pay us a second payment, but are they gonna pay up on the third? •_•
*DAV:	Well that's always the catch isn't it? •_•
*ANN:	You know? •_•
*DAV:	The last one. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        So we actually wrote down  erm  the equipment that we were buying was ours until paid for in full. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	By them. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And we sent this letter up to them. •_•
        Well we've had their director on the phone, phone yesterday  and more or less demanded his twenty thousand back •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	and, if you don't want the work we'll take it elsewhere and all this. •_•
*DAV:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	Erm •_•
*DAV:	Puts you off doesn't it? •_•
*ANN:	Well I mean, what on earth do you do? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Very difficult isn't it? •_•
*ANN:	You just  well both Neil and I have sort of felt well, to be quite honest it isn't worth it. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        For what you make at the end of the day on, on somebody's   •_•
*ANN:	No it's not worth it. •_•
        It  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	well it, the running the business isn't I don't think  because by the time  the tax man's hammered you •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	you know, the V A T man wants his money, I mean the V A T man's been paid for all these invoices •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	and I still haven't got the money in. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	You know. •_•
        Everything's against you! •_•
*DAV:	Really V A T's, I think, and I think it should only be paid when it, when the invoices  •_•
*ANN:	Exactly! •_•
*DAV:	have been cleared, rather than always paying  •_•
*ANN:	Exactly! •_•
*DAV:	for that quarter  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	even if you've not got paid. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        Exactly! •_•
        Erm  mm, I don't know whether there's any way round it  but  that's sort of the set up that they gave us when we started and I guess I'll have to  sort of conform to that, but  it  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	does seem unfair. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        That's right. •_•
*ANN:	I mean now there's a couple of people quibbling about actually paying  at the  that we did. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	There's still six hundred and odd pound outstanding. •_•
        Erm  I can't honestly see us ever getting that. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Erm  the funiculars  they're quibbling about the final payment. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	About them being late and everything else. •_•
        Er, you know, it's just a, and I've paid for that and that and •_•
*DAV:	There's extenuating circumstances like that  •_•
*ANN:	Oh dear! •_•
*DAV:	though isn't there? •_•
        As Neil said. •_•
*ANN:	Well yeah! •_•
*DAV:	Changes in specification •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	er, equipment coming in late, er  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	you know, I mean •_•
*ANN:	They don't seem to  want to know though. •_•
        I mean, Neil's tried to explain to them  that, they were late with drawings and everything else, it put us way behind in the beginning. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But all, you know, they've just not listened to him! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	So  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	I guess it'll  •_•
*DAV:	It's er stalling  they're  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	cos that's all it's doing innit? •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        Well solicitor said she, it sounded to her as if there's something more  to it. •_•
        Maybe they don't have the money. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And they're stalling all the time. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But erm  you see, they suggested going down for a meeting  he's up to his eyes in it! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	he can't honestly spare time to go down there •_•
*DAV:	It's costing you money isn't it? •_•
*ANN:	Well yeah  •_•
*DAV:	And chase your own  what's due to  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	you. •_•
        That's, that's the . •_•
*ANN:	And we know you're gonna have an argument. •_•
        So is it worth it? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	I, I, I personally feel that  give it to solicitor and let her deal with it, because •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	just not worth the hassle. •_•
        Alright  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	that's gonna cost •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	but, but I mean you can only make it worse by  like you say, you're wasting your own time and money •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	you're not gonna get anywhere! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        All gets  •_•
*ANN:	I mean  •_•
*DAV:	a bit acrimonious doesn't it? •_•
        And er  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        Don't it? •_•
*DAV:	er that sort of thing starts happening. •_•
*ANN:	Oh it's painful! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	It really is painful! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        It's getting ever more difficult isn't it? •_•
        Doing  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	business. •_•
        Ever more. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        You just  I,all this bumph about sort of trying to help small businesses and, things like that, they do nothing! •_•
*DAV:	No. •_•
        No I know that. •_•
*ANN:	They do nothing at all! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        No it's er  as you say, all, all the cards are stacked in  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	such a way that it makes it ever more difficult. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        The trouble is, see  you know, you've nobody you can go to, you, you've nobody that sort of will listen to •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	to all this and do something about it higher up. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	I mean they just keep hammering and hammering and more and more are going out of business. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Alright,saying in the paper, they're talking about  stopping these big companies, keeping these little companies waiting  there could be something they can do about that, but how long is it going to be before they do something? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        It's a  •_•
*ANN:	In the meantime  there's more and more going bust every week! •_•
*DAV:	Well the trouble is, a lot of these MPs and  people on these committees  are actually  they've got seats on the boards of a lot of these big companies  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	so it's not in their interests to push this through. •_•
        The longer they can stall  something  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	like that •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	er, you know, the better it is, and particularly when you look at the  the fever that there is at the moment about  electioneering •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	is, is no big business isn't it? •_•
*ANN:	No, that's true. •_•
        I mean maybe I should go and see local  erm  MP or  •_•
*DAV:	Local M P. •_•
*ANN:	whatever and, and, about the rates. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And see, you know, if they can do something about that, maybe it'd be right time. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	cos we're actually the only ones that have their rate bill  Barry's hasn't. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	So, you know, they're  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	just expecting us to pay! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        I would. •_•
*ANN:	And it's  Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	That's what they're there for! •_•
*ANN:	Well, yeah that's true! •_•
*DAV:	Whether you've voted for them or not. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	And , you know  in fact  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	you pay your taxes and, and •_•
*ANN:	Yeah, it's very true that. •_•
*DAV:	you know, it can have . •_•
*ANN:	I might do that. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Because if, if they've singled yourself out, it's, obviously, it's not right is it? •_•
*ANN:	No it's not. •_•
        Well I said, well I'm not paying mine until somebody else gets theirs. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And have to pay theirs. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But erm  I suppose next thing'll be a court demand and, how d'ya fight that? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	So •_•
*DAV:	It's all a worry innit? •_•
*ANN:	Yeah, int it? •_•
        Oh! •_•
        Headache stuff! •_•
        Never mind. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Never mind! •_•
*DAV:	Oh well, keep your head down. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah ! •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        At least there isn't the same hassle as there was at Calpers  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	I mean  alright, yes, you sort of have worries, but most of the time, I mean, for all last year it's run pretty well. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	It's only just recently that we sort of starting our we've had bits of aggro. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Or at least, like  •_•
*ANN:	So  •_•
*DAV:	with this,all the benefits are, you  get them personally don't you? •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	Er rather than  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	doing the same amount of hours er and somebody else benefiting? •_•
*ANN:	That's it! •_•
        Yeah, that's it. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	I mean, it's, like his car for instance, I mean, that's always been a dream he never thought he'd ever be able to afford  a new car, erm  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	you know? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And er, of course that's like a dream come true for Neil, so  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	that's  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	why we want to make a success and he  don't lose it all ! •_•
*DAV:	Well, you know, you've got to have er benefits of, of  taking a course of action like this haven't you? •_•
        Because  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	otherwise  you know  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	what's the point? •_•
*ANN:	That's it. •_•
*DAV:	What's the point? •_•
        I mean  •_•
*ANN:	That's it. •_•
*DAV:	It's not that people want to get rich, it's just that you make a nice living and  enjoy  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	what you like doing and that's it. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	You know? •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah, can well do without the sort of, the hassle and the aggro. •_•
        I mean,Calpers have made it  a lot worse for us. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	They have. •_•
        They've done  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	everything possible to make life difficult! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But er  hopefully they'll leave us alone soon. •_•
        But it doesn't help when we bring people like Geoff you see, cos Geoff comes from Calpers  •_•
*DAV:	Oh I don't, oh right. •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah. •_•
        He did. •_•
*DAV:	I I didn't recognize him. •_•
*ANN:	Really angry  about it because they've had to bring somebody else in to do  Geoff's work. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        Right. •_•
*ANN:	So  I mean it was Geoff's choice. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Well, this is it, I mean, people  you can't make people do things, I mean, they've got to  •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
*DAV:	want to do it haven't they? •_•
        So •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
        This  •_•
*DAV:	well  •_•
*ANN:	is it. •_•
*DAV:	we've done very little there. •_•
        They just don't seem to be doing any steel work at all. •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
        Well, everybody keeps telling us they're not doing anything. •_•
        They just don't know how they're surviving but they keep going on! •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	The man, he must have plenty of money to keep it, carrying it •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	as he is doing. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But er •_•
*DAV:	no doubt it'll all come out in  fullness of time  •_•
*ANN:	Well yeah  •_•
*DAV:	won't it? •_•
*ANN:	It will won't it? •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	Things can't carry on indefinitely  in any business •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
*DAV:	where nothing's being produced, can it? •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
        Oh well he's, he's told the lads that  it's only a matter of time. •_•
        I think that's  what more or less decided Geoff that, yeah, he would take it. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But erm •_•
*DAV:	There you go. •_•
        Well if he's , I mean, that's what you want innit? •_•
*ANN:	Well yeah. •_•
*DAV:	Somebody who can turn you  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	know, do a bit of everything. •_•
*ANN:	Well it means, you see, apparently Geoff's done all the air braking at Calpers it means that Neil can actually  some of the time, be here  rather  •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	than up there all the time with them. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Well , cos David really doesn't know anything  about the air braking or anything like that. •_•
*DAV:	Right. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*ANN:	So •_•
*DAV:	Very good! •_•
        Anyway, I'll let you get on. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah, it's nice to see you again. •_•
*DAV:	And you. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        Gotta go and see the guy on the end now. •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah! •_•
*DAV:	Haven't , haven't met him as yet. •_•
        He's  they've  opened an account with us and had a few bits and baps off us, so  •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
        Yeah, cos er, I think Neil was telling you that, they look as if they're gonna be buying plenty of gas off us if we, when we start taking the air products. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	So •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	He's seems er, he seems okay. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	But that's a big company I think. •_•
*DAV:	Right. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        Well  •_•
*ANN:	But  •_•
*DAV:	I think so, it looks  •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*DAV:	it doesn't it? •_•
*ANN:	I think we're only little one  here. •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Right. •_•
*ANN:	I mean , next door  he's a big  company based in London, so •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	And we're struggling ! •_•
*DAV:	I'll see you. •_•
*ANN:	Alright Jim. •_•
        See you! •_•
        Bye! •_•
        Neil, I hate to say it, but I don't think  Teresa'll  will stick up there long. •_•
        They've just asked her to do  more hours, she's to stay till five at night. •_•
*TRA:	Well  well she just wants to say well  •_•
*ANN:	It's not fair is it? •_•
*TRA:	you know  can  can she have some money? •_•
