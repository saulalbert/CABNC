        Bye. •234981_234990•
*REN:	Oh  •234990_234993•
*CHR:	Mum, would you just sit up there with the bike  like a twist bike. •235046_235452•
*TON:	Hurry up. •235542_235566•
*CHR:	Put the radio on now. •235631_236331•
*JAC:	Can I put the radio on? •236636_236953•
*TON:	Yeah. •237005_237033•
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*TON:	I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that I'd never driven in the dark before. •240584_240929•
*JAC:	Well yeah, it's bound to throw you, I mean its  •240990_241183•
*TON:	Mm. •241183_241189•
*JAC:	it's the first time you drove in the dark was on your driving test  wasn't it? •241199_241502•
*TON:	Yeah  I must admit I think that a little bit erm •241559_242005•
*JAC:	It was unfortunate •242005_242226•
*TON:	Yeah •242312_242349•
*JAC:	but it was . •242360_242685•
*TON:	I suppose I could have er  looking at  •242826_243315•
*JAC:	Was it as dark as this?. •243315_243520•
*TON:	By the time I'd finished, yes  it was pitch dark. •243529_243892•
*JAC:	Well the only thing you can do is hopefully your next test isn't at the same time  make it a  •243892_244993•
*TON:	Yeah. •244993_245017•
*JAC:	different time. •245017_245061•
*TON:	But in any event it would be a good idea if I had some tests  some lessons in the dark. •245146_245719•
*JAC:	Might be  I mean ask Brian, see  •245801_245986•
*TON:	Mm. •245986_245993•
*JAC:	what he can do because •245993_246115•
*TON:	Yeah •246188_246223•
*JAC:	I mean I knew  the first day I drove in the dark was the first night we had the car and it was most odd experience •246223_246979•
*TON:	Yeah. •247043_247074•
*JAC:	I mean  first day  •247074_247167•
*TON:	I found it  •247167_247218•
*JAC:	driving a brand new car and then •247233_247348•
*TON:	Yeah. •247348_247377•
*JAC:	driving in the dark for the first time, ha. •247377_247565•
*TON:	Yeah  I'd find it quite difficult  well I could see the headlights  coming up  and I was thinking  now how fast is that car coming up  I don't really know. •247565_248469•
*JAC:	Yeah  and the thing is also being  new to driving you tend to look at the headlights rather than look away from them. •248469_249203•
*TON:	Yeah. •249220_249249•
*JAC:	And that doesn't help because  I don't know, it wasn't, I don't think you'd find it was as dark as this. •249317_250034•
*TON:	Mm. •250034_250042•
*JAC:	Not at four o' clock, its not quite that dark at •250047_250326•
*TON:	 ((cough)) 
*JAC:	half past, yeah •250326_250573•
*TON:	Yeah. •250593_250602•
*JAC:	but not this dark at four, not yet. •250614_250858•
*TON:	Well he had to switch on the interior light to be able to fill out the form. •250858_251250•
*JAC:	Oh yeah, it's pretty dark but not  •251264_251729•
*TON:	Mm. •251743_251750•
*JAC:	it's not black like this. •251751_252331•
*TON:	Mm. •254185_254193•
*JAC:	Are you, what are you doing tomorrow, are you coming in with me? •254617_255298•
*TON:	Erm  yeah. •255298_255333•
*JAC:	Friday. •255381_255405•
*TON:	Yeah. •255510_255519•
*JAC:	Good. •255531_255542•
*TON:	I'm coming with you  I've got to do er  I've gotta do some prep  •255543_256020•
*JAC:	it's nice to have someone to talk to. •256021_256510•
*TON:	Yeah, but you may be recorded. •256510_256886•
*JAC:	I don't care. •256956_257146•
*TON:	Oh. •257146_257165•
*JAC:	Nice chap. •257185_257240•
*TON:	Where did he come from? •257240_257389•
*JAC:	He came out of the Harvester but it would have been nice if he'd waited  for there to be a gap in the traffic . •257389_258191•
*TON:	Yeah. •258191_258197•
*JAC:	If you see what I mean. •258197_258347•
*TON:	Yeah  Oh he wasn't gonna wait  •259032_259157•
*JAC:	. •_•
*TON:	either. •259192_259202•
*TON:	Oh dear. •259202_259399•
*JAC:	Ah  it's gonna be one of those nights tonight . •259399_259602•
*TON:	Yeah I think so  I must admit from one point of view  I'm quite glad that I  haven't  passed  cos  •259602_260609•
*JAC:	Why? •260609_260661•
*TON:	it's a bad  as you said it's a bad time to start driving now there's an awful lot of •260662_261189•
*JAC:	Idiots come out. •261189_261262•
*TON:	idiots on the road  especially coming  •261262_261492•
*JAC:	last  •261492_261499•
*TON:	up to Christmas •261565_261572•
*JAC:	Yeah, last Christmas was a real eye opener to me, cos the Christmas before •261587_262001•
*TON:	Mm. •262043_262054•
*JAC:	I didn't drive very much cos my Dad was still so bad I only did  •262054_262385•
*TON:	Yeah. •262388_262402•
*JAC:	the essential journeys •262413_262598•
*TON:	Mhm. •262634_262640•
*JAC:	and I mean I then I'd only just had my operation and to actually  drive  for longer than about  twenty minute journeys was killing  so  •262640_263728•
*TON:	Yeah. •264077_264089•
*JAC:	I only drove over to to do the shopping and to pick Christine up from School. •264099_264529•
*TON:	Yeah. •264625_264638•
*JAC:	That was all. •265054_268725•
*TON:	Yeah you're right I look at the headlights. •268725_268939•
*JAC:	Yeah you must do you see you've got to  •268939_269072•
*TON:	Mm. •269072_269081•
*JAC:	look  if you've got to concentrate on anything, concentrate on the white line or •269081_269556•
*TON:	Yeah. •269556_269562•
*JAC:	the kerb  certainly the white line if you can •269562_270212•
*TON:	Yeah. •270324_270336•
*JAC:	cos if you concentrate on the kerb you tend to drive a bit too close to it •270336_270694•
*TON:	Yeah. •270694_270700•
*JAC:	and also it's not always there for you to see easily •270760_270993•
*TON:	No. •271025_271059•
*JAC:	whereas the white line is  But if you look into the headlights it can be  not dark  erm but  it appears to be dark because •271059_272566•
*TON:	Well your pupils erm •272566_272691•
*JAC:	they react into the headlights. •272697_272871•
*TON:	react into the headlights, yeah  so it makes it seem darker. •272871_273211•
*JAC:	And you've gotta be careful as well at night not to hang on to the tail lights of the thing in from of you •276401_276910•
*TON:	Mm. •276935_276947•
*JAC:	cos it's very easy to do it because they're two little red beacons •276970_277378•
*TON:	Yes. •277403_277413•
*JAC:	you know you've still got to look ahead •277413_277631•
*TON:	Yes. •277713_277720•
*JAC:	and concentrate on what's happening •277733_277933•
*TON:	Yes. •277951_277974•
*JAC:	further up the road. •277981_278059•
*TON:	There was one point during my test when I was driving along and erm  the I was creeping forward in a stream of traffic and the person in front of me had crossed the solid white line at some traffic lights  and the lights changed and it would have been very easy to follow his lights and just carry on •278059_280081•
*JAC:	Yeah. •280081_280090•
*TON:	but I didn't I stopped   •280090_280221•
*JAC:	But you see it every day  I mean •280225_280345•
*TON:	Yeah. •280470_280482•
*JAC:	You know I've had it happen the lights have changed just as I've been crossing them so I've gone over and three cars immediately behind me have followed me. •280482_281378•
*TON:	Yeah. •281598_281609•
*JAC:	We're gonna have to get a tyre gauge I reckon  they've got a new depth of tread  one point six millimetres which is bigger than the. •281610_•
