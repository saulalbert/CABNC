@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 051603)
*FRE:	But then they have to er raise money to go.
*PET:	Right. (.) 
*FRE:	I mean it 
*PET:	I think it's only, I don't think   [laughing] he, he's   [] there's any cheap answers
*FRE:	No.
*PET:	and I know la well some time when   (.) retirement was looking on the   (.) on the horizon   (.) I was saying to him you're not alone   (.) but, you know, you've gotta be looking towards being on your own because of course 
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	mother and I hope father and I will   (.) be around to want to pick up what we can to help   (.) you've gotta start thinking about   (.) standing on your own feet, you know, because   (.) admittedly I er I, I, I   (.) could turn out to be   (.) not as bad a financial state as I anticipated but I never was stinking rich and I'm certainly not stinking rich now, so   (.) erm I mean
*FRE:	No but quite apart from that, er th there's   (.) anybody er needs to aim to be self sufficient don't they?
*PET:	Well I, I, I, I think that you've got to   (.) move in that direction rather than maintaining the status quo.So erm   (.) if, if it was er if it was a matter of   (.) oh bankrolling him out to wherever it was or   (.) supplementing his own resources    (        )  ((laugh)) okay, but the, the experience and I mean the personal experience as well as the er the skills experience
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	that
*FRE:	Yeah but he's got to want to do it.
*PET:	Quite.
*FRE:	Er erm that's the, that's the crucial bit.
*PET:	Absolutely.There is no possible way of shipping an unwilling young person out.
*FRE:	No that's right.Because even 
*PET:	I don't think there ever was.
*FRE:	e e even those that er you know are definitely wanting to go and keen can   [laughing] get homesick   [] fairly soon.
*PET:	Oh yeah.But you know erm if, if, if you look back to the days of the Raj   (.) erm it was a   (.) even within my living memory, erm people were joining the armed services or the overseas er er    (.)  (        ) corp and the civil service overseas I suppose, yeah, er at a, at a fairly   (.) humble level and would either work their way up or they drink themselves stupid or they get mixed up with someone or they, you know   (.) but it was a, a, a   (.) recognized way of, of, of going, you know, either join the services or the
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	or the church of course was another one, erm but   (.) none of these   ((cough)) traditional   ((cough)) erm   (.) avenues exist now
*FRE:	No.
*PET:	and more and more and more people are looking for experience, they're looking for vocations, they're looking for er   (.) the sort of   (.) attributes which, you know, aren't actually overflowing when you're unemployed in Wolverhampton
*FRE:	That's right.
*PET:	having failed out on two poly courses.So erm we as, we as I say are very concerned about er   (.) that can't have done Jan any good, that's
*FRE:	No no, that's right.
*PET:	She really has   (.) this er   (.) attitude which   (.) I cannot understand because erm a a as I think it was Al Reeve said, you know, erm some people can't bear children, we can't, but we like them   ((laugh)) but if you have actually borne children, you are in other words a mother, you've gotta have a   (.) attitude, not only to children in general but to your children in particular, which is very very difficult for   (.) er a male to understand and a non-father, it's gonna be very very difficult cos I personally don't have any children at all and therefore it is very very difficult for me to even comprehend but   (.) given that I can erm I can sympathize with something I do not comprehend   [whispering] it must be monumentally difficult for her
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	it really must  [] .
*FRE:	Yes, oh yes,th th that's right, there's no doubt about it.
*PET:	And erm poor Jan is   (.) saying what    (.)  [laughing] have I done, should I have done, could I have done  [] 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	and, you know, once you start into, into that er scenario yo yo yo you, you, you can't   (.) very very little erm opportunity for anything because   (.) all you can do is, is to say what do we do now, never mind what we could, should or might have done then, what do we do now because the future is that way and the past is   (.)  (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	We can be influenced by history, we can, we learn from history, we can do all sorts of things about history but what er er as far as   (.) er   (.) Christopher's concerned, what do we do now because that   (.) I just don't know!I just
*FRE:	No.
*PET:	don't know!
*FRE:	No that's right.
*PET:	And erm   (.) the really distressing thing is   (.) I think Christopher is saying what to do now   (.) I think he is saying oh you know
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	I, I've been
*FRE:	Yeah
*PET:	depending on, sponging off er whatever   (.) for however long and now he is going, is, is retiring on health grounds, you know, he really isn't going to be er able to bankroll me
*FRE:	You mean he, he's now talking about you?Yeah, yeah.
*PET:	Well I mean, yeah, he
*FRE:	Er thinking, yeah.
*PET:	he's not, he's not, he's not a, he's not stupid, Christopher, he, he's certainly not stupid, and er   (.) he must have seen, I mean I assume he keeps his bank statements, I mean I'm afraid we have one or two bank statements which show   (.) thousands of pounds that he's received from us over the last year erm and, you know, he can't   (        ) blind because they've all gone through his bank account, you know, he must
*FRE:	Yeah, quite 
*PET:	be thinking good grief, you know, I haven't had a   (.) a, a, a successful, happy   (.) year or so
*FRE:	No.
*PET:	and   (.) it has, it has represented volumes of money which the state can't or won't or doesn't   (.) carry on with.So I think he's sitting there in Wolverhampton about this time wondering what on earth he is  (.) 
*FRE:	I'm sure he must be 
*PET:	looking forward to and     (.)  ((sigh))  (.) that is a very very   (.) painful   (.) situation to be in isn't it?
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	I, I just don't know what he's, he's, he's, he's, he's seeing his future as being and erm   (.) maybe cos we haven't got  (        ) , maybe erm it's because of the   (.) generation gap, maybe it's because of communication problems either between me and him or the young and old or whatever but, you know, he just doesn't seem to have anything   (.) to   (.) volunteer er other than ah well I'll try and get a job or ah well I'll try and get some more qualifications or whatever. (.) So, yeah, that's sort of 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah 
*PET:	anoth another bit in the
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Where, whereabouts is Lyndsey in her training now?
*PET:	Oh she's erm   (.) tt   (.) she is the   (.) brighter   (.) spark on the horizon I suppose, you know? (.)  ((sigh)) It makes me cough a bit because when   (.) I came on the scene he was the one academically everything and she was the one who was academically rather   (.) disadvantaged but she, she was, you know,no not having the greatest of, of, of success but erm   (.) it was said that she wouldn't be able to be a student nurse because she wasn't bright enough but you know she   (.) clocked up the O levels and A levels like guide badges and she went off on this pre-nursing course in South Notts you know and   (.) she was in and out of the Queens on a course and    (.)  (        ) people and, you know, (        ) and   (.) she said I   (.) don't know all the answers but I've a rough idea about some of the questions, I want to be a nurse and   (.) off she went to, to, to Walsall and   (.) I'm not saying she's a brilliant student nurse but erm   (.) absolutely clear that she's better than some of the others.And er, you know, that's   (.) negative if you will but   (.) it's fact
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	and   [laughing] she's still enjoying it which is great  [] 
*FRE:	Yeah, so, so what year is she, er third year?Yeah.
*PET:	Mm.Takes her finals this, this summer.And erm not only er do I think that er she'll probably   (.) be reasonably good with, with finals   (.) I'm absolutely sure that her course reports from, you know, all the places where she's been will be   (.) better than most of the other candidates, you know, because she brings home these,the these reports, you know, and she says it looks alright, you know, (        )  (.) beginning of the course   (.) Nurse  is lacking in this or has not got that or is not, you know, you think mm pretty   (.) the end of the course    (        )  (.) Nurse  got the hang of, is very good, has done this, has done that, has supported this and you think mm pretty, well that's lovely   [laughing] you know but she   [] didn't have the experience   (.) during the whatever, she had been given the experience and the end of it   (.) brilliant
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	A or whatever it is, you know?
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	And er I, I would therefore think that i it's, it's unlikely that she'll crash out on her exams.But if she did   (.) I think she will pass out on her record because perhaps, even more delightful than someone who, you know, sitting down to an exam and, and   (.) doing reasonably well on it.So   (.) I, I, I think that er one of the, the   (.) comforting things which er   (.) I c I can see is that she has grown in self confidence, not cockiness, self confidence.She has learnt, she has absorbed   (.) inwardly digested a quantity, a consid considerable quantity of it, I think that she will be a reasonably   (.) useful   (.) nurse to have around.
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	That's lovely   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah 
*PET:	You know, they, they, they can be a bit hard, they can be a bit bitter, they can drink a bit too much, they can be a bit promiscuous, they can be all sorts of rather   (.) iffy things but I don't think Lyndsey will.I, I, I, I've got, I think all the evidence is building towards her being  (.) 
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	a good little nurse.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	What on earth she does then   (.) I dunno. (.) Erm   (.) mm I can't remember, Alan and Josie's daughter down the road, erm   (.) she   (.) passed out as a nurse from Queens a while ago and you know what students are in general, nurses in particular , there was, you would expect, one hell of a party when the exam results were public    (.)  (        ) what came out of the     (        )  (.)  [shouting] the party was when she got a job   [] as a nurse.And that is absolutely mind blowing to me
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	because I can remember, and it's not that long ago for goodness sake, that if you qualified as a nurse, and   (        ) will probably tell even the same story to an extent, there was no problem about a job, you were a certified nurse, bang.
*FRE:	That's right.Well er I mean that's   (.) not going back too far either.
*PET:	Well   (.) it ain't now
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	and er er er er the situation is that you can, in, in some of these nursing schools where they have taught you and it is their letterhead that's on your pass-out, they still aren't in a position to say oh well there's a job of course because you don't need to have passed out top, you know, to be guaranteed a job, there ain't no jobs   (.) guaranteed for no one.And er I just don't know what to do.California and Saudi Arabia are two of the, you know, destinations that come to mind but erm   (.) I don't know about that either, you know, if she doesn't  (.) 
*FRE:	What month does she take the exam?
*PET:	Oh I er er I think it's erm   (.) July or er June, July or August, it's, it's, it's it's 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	the summer.I think she maybe takes the exams in June and gets the results in July and   (.) er then we're fifty in August and then we go off to North America in September I think, you know, er I think, I, I can't quite remember the details but erm
*FRE:	You've got a holiday booked?
*PET:	Yes, yes 
*FRE:	Good.
*PET:	well we've erm   (.) we've erm   (.) we've been rather   (.) tempted by the west coast er   (.) I personally want to see the Grand Canyon and erm I'd like to see San Francisco   (.) so the package which is being offered to the Boots Association with whom we've been away several times and   (.) we lo we like it as, as a, as a background because you've got a rough idea, you know, the people you're going with   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yes.
*PET:	there are, there are very very few who are chasing women or men and there are very very few who are er   (.) requiring to be prised out of the bar erm   (.) at two o'clock in the morning.There are very very few who are er interested in finding a gambling haunt or a, you know, television or film theatre or whatever, you know, er er by and large there are a lot of people who   (.) chat to a waitress if they're a bloke or, or chat to the, the whatever it is if they're girls but er in, in a, in a friendly way, who will have a drink but will not be paralytically drunk, who may watch television or a, you know, film or theatre or something if it's appropriate but won't get twitched if it isn't, you know, and   (.) and by and large erm all the people we've, we've, we've, we've come across   (.) I came across before have been very very good company and it is, it is delightful to have the   (.) have you, cos have you been on a Si on a Signpost?
*FRE:	Yes   (.) a Signpost holiday, yeah
*PET:	Yeah.
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	Well er   (.) I think that getting away the   [mimicking] oh you live in Nottingham, oh fancy that   [] you know, you, you know where you're starting, you know, everyone either works for Boots or used to work for Boots and, you know, you've got a rough idea, you, you, you don't need to go into the   [mimicking] oh fancy that    (        )  [] you know, all that's   (.) arranged so erm I think i i it's,i i i it's the middle of September when we either go to Los Angeles, I think we go to Los Angeles, and fool around Hollywood and San Diego and places and down to   (        ) to see a   (        ) and then away off to erm Las Vegas and Flagstaff   (.) you know about this meteor crater in Flagstaff, that apparently is why you go to Flagstaff tt a meteor came, the meteor crater is there tt and then the Grand Canyon and    (        )  (.) go through   (        ) national park which   (        ) San Francisco and erm   (.) spend erm two or three days there and then come back again.Tt so erm   (.) we are thinking it will be, like everybody else, it's not a good idea to put too much off   [laughing] too far into the future  [] 
*FRE:	Oh no no, you want to go.
*PET:	I, I think, well I think so.And so er friends of ours, he's got   (.) muscular dystrophy   (.) and he's sort of in the same sort of   (        ) and so we    (        )  (.) we'll have a decrepit contingent, [laughing] he and I will   ((laugh)) sort of and the two girls who are relatively young and healthy will go charging around and   (.) taking photographs and   (.) doing the tourist thing.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	Yes. (.) Sort of on the, on the horizon for the end of the year and er   (.) I, I er don't know how we're going to   (.) do but erm   (.) I think the answer probably is to   (.) take a chunk at a time on the basis that erm one isn't going to be able to charge around as violently, actively as some people will.
*FRE:	Yeah, yes er erm that's oh you must because then you have the memories.
*PET:	Exactly.Exactly.Not only does no one want to take those away, no one can take them away
*FRE:	That's right.
*PET:	 (        ) that's er that's right, you know, and   (.) erm what I'm saying to myself is okay, you know, er   (.) maybe it will be tiring, I'm sure it will   (.) maybe it will be erm   (.) expensive, like take a taxi because    (.)  [laughing] can't walk, you know, erm   [] erm okay
*FRE:	 ((yawn)) 
*PET:	that's, that's, that's the way it is and er 
*FRE:	Yeah. (.) 
*PET:	we'll   (.) I think, be okay and, provided we don't   (        ) excessively energetic and too stupid, get too hot in the bath or   (        ) that's not a very good thing to do, or crash out with er flu or something   (.) I dare say anyone can crash out, I mean you, you, you could be a president of the United States   (        ) 
*FRE:	 [laughing] Exactly    []  ((laugh)) 
*PET:	and be in, in Japan and you can crash out but er
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	we'll see how it er   (.) What are your,wh what are you pla er er your plans?Are you, are you going on a, a ship again or  (        ) ?
*FRE:	No I, I haven't got any plans at the moment, you know I've been sort of er   (.) I usually go around this time you know, er
*PET:	It it's certainly looking    (.)  (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah I've still got swollen fingers which I am er er I've needed as much physio on these as on, on the finger that was done.
*PET:	Why was that?
*FRE:	 ((sigh)) They just swoll sw swelled up and erm I don't know why but I'm told it's not unusual.
*PET:	Mm.Because of the, the tinkering around it must do a bit of
*FRE:	And erm   (.) but as I say I, I, I have, I still haven't got full use of those. (.) 
*PET:	Are they, are they coming?
*FRE:	Yes I   (.) yes they are er but I seem to have reached a, a stage where they're not   [laughing] progressing as much as I would like   [] you know?They're, they're, oh they're vastly improved
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	to, to, I mean when I first had the er plaster off, which was for ten days it was, I could not believe it that   [laughing] these fingers were not going   [] but I'm told that that's quite usual.
*PET:	Well   (.) i it's a very complicated bit of gear and 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	it's been tinkered around with I mean I don't 
*FRE:	Yes but er I think i it's a combination of things, it's the fact that you've got your erm hand in plaster so your fingers are not moving and you lose muscle tone so quickly.
*PET:	Mm.Particularly with something which is otherwise in 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	almost continuous use
*FRE:	Ah right.
*PET:	perhaps not to a very violent er extent but it's, it's, it's moving.
*FRE:	Yeah that's right, that's right.So er to get to your question erm I've sort of not   (.) been doing anything erm I was hoping that I would be sort of fully fit round about now and then if I saw something on teletext   ((laugh)) er that was good I'd just buzz off for a week or so.Cos I   (.) I got one off teletext erm   (.) er it must have been nineteen ninety now   (.) for Tenerife   (.) four star hotel, seven days, East Midlands Airport for one hundred and fifteen pounds   (.) half board er er the following day which was fantastic.I mean everything was good, the flight, the hotel, the weather. (.) 
*PET:	Er and, and these are erm   (.) to fill up the, the exercise, the  (.) 
*FRE:	Yes they're er er
*PET:	short term
*FRE:	they're a filling up, the plane, yeah.Filling up the plane and the hotel, spaces that the, this particular company had, yeah. (.) You don't see many like that, I'm not expecting that again.
*PET:	Well.
*FRE:	Especially East Midlands Airport, it's very seldom you see an East Midlands Airport bargain. ((cough))  (.) But erm no I shall er
*PET:	Is, is, is that national   (.) nationally advertised?
*FRE:	Yes, yes
*PET:	So   (        ) 
*FRE:	so most of them are London Gatwick   (.) or Manchester.Most of them er er that are advertised are from London Gatwick. ((yawn))  (.) 
*PET:	So as it were you, you, you turn up   (.) holidays   (.) and you, you, you, you, you scroll through until you
*FRE:	Yeah.Well they, they, they scroll through themselves, I mean you have no control   (.) er they are on three five two is one of the n the numbers and er there, there's probably be about four to six pages which, you know, go er er er you have to wait, I mean they just go through I don't know about twenty seconds perhaps each
*PET:	Oh so
*FRE:	page
*PET:	there, there is time to erm
*FRE:	Oh and you can hold   (.) i i if there's one comes up you can hold it.
*PET:	Oh I see yes, yes.
*FRE:	Mm.Yeah. (.) 
*PET:	 (        )  (.) a a and yes that is, that is quite erm   (.) that is quite erm
*FRE:	You'd be interested in teletext, you must have a teletext set next time you have a set.
*PET:	Well yeah I suspect we will but erm  (.) 
*FRE:	I, I don't mean just for holidays, I, I
*PET:	 (        )  (.) i i it seems that an enormous number of people who have got it erm   (.) do   (.) find it er useful.Whether it is er   (.) particularly important to an individual depends on the individual again 
*FRE:	Mm mm
*PET:	and er I suspect most people would be   (.) only keeping an eye on the foreign exchange page, you know, when they were thinking about buying   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah but I mean there's the weather forecast including the local weather forecast erm that you can switch on any time and er   (.) news of course erm oh er er lots and lots.It's, it's amazing how much there is  ((cough)) 
*PET:	Do you get a teletext directory? (.) 
*FRE:	You
*PET:	Well you know it's gonna be page three five two but how do you know it's page three five two, do you just 
*FRE:	di did, yeah, did ori ah ah yes but er
*PET:	do you go through, through   [laughing] three five one before you got there  [] ?
*FRE:	Yeah they, they erm   (.) when you switch the teletext on it comes on to a hundred, that's the thing, and, and, and on that a hundred they'll give you   (.) er news one O two or whatever it is, you know, and so on.But also one nine nine is the index of the whole lot. (.) 
*PET:	And, and you, you, you, do you   (.) select Ceefax or, or Oracle?Or
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah you 
*PET:	does it 
*FRE:	No er yes,wha what you do er okay one is B B C One so if you put text on that, then obviously Ceefax will come up.
*PET:	Yes.
*FRE:	Now you've got to go back to T V to get
*PET:	Change to
*FRE:	to three
*PET:	I T V
*FRE:	and then you text for your Oracle.
*PET:	Oh I see. (.) Cos it's,i i it's, it's, it's, it's, it's very very clever isn't it?
*FRE:	It is very clever.
*PET:	It's, it's   (.) is it two lines the   (.) picture that have got the teletext data on them? (.) 
*FRE:	How do you mean? (.) 
*PET:	Where is it? (.) Where's the information?It must be transmitted
*FRE:	Ah yes.
*PET:	and it must be transmitted on
*FRE:	Yeah
*PET:	B B C One and I T V 
*FRE:	it's er on B B C One and B B C Two er
*PET:	The same?
*FRE:	I think they are the same but three and four are different.Er B B C Two I think B   (.) er   (.) three and four are different.
*PET:	Channels
*FRE:	Four
*PET:	three and four?
*FRE:	is different to Oracle
*PET:	Oracle
*FRE:	er is well is different to er   (.) er channel three.I think they're probably both Oracle. (.) 
*PET:	Oh so it's just 
*FRE:	Yeah but in other words what I'm saying is that there are diff 
*PET:	It's three page hundreds  (.) 
*FRE:	Yeah
*PET:	that you've got to look at.
*FRE:	Yes, yes, yes yes.Erm  (.) 
*PET:	So your 
*FRE:	but but on, no, on your er, no, on your   (.) Oracle er   (.) channel three, one nine nine   (.) what will be shown up on your index will be channel three and channel four
*PET:	Aha
*FRE:	so, and, and you will see that's, that er   (.) I don't know whether some are all the same, but erm there are different, yeah, you know, erm   (.) in other words what I'm saying is they're not on both channels. (.) 
*PET:	So they're, I don't know whether it's,i it's terribly reactionary to say that we really want one teletext   (.) cos your holidays, might they be coming up on   (.) Ceefax
*FRE:	No, no,i it's pur it's all 
*PET:	 (        ) Oracle 
*FRE:	Oracle, yeah, cos it's an advertisement, I mean the people who are   (.) er er it is er being paid for by the people who advertise it.Yeah. (.) 
*PET:	Yeah I, I think you'll find   (.) that erm when the   (.) colour er when B B C Two came along and all the aerials went to U H F, we went from a four O five line
*FRE:	That's right 
*PET:	to a six two five 
*FRE:	Something.
*PET:	line and I think you'll find that now there are in fact six two three lines of television information, and there are two lines which are dedicated to carrying teletext data
*FRE:	Oh
*PET:	and I think that's where the  (        ) , there's no sound is there? (.) 
*FRE:	No, you get the sound of the erm the programme.
*PET:	Oh really?
*FRE:	Oh yes, if you, you, no you get the sound, if I erm s say I've got Oracle erm channel three on and I switch to text, I will still get the sound of the television programme
*PET:	Ah I see.Which will be confusing.
*FRE:	Well you can mute it if you want you see.
*PET:	Yes of course, yes of course 
*FRE:	And you can mix it.You, you can have your erm   (.) if you were watching a programme and er, I've done this, erm if you're watching a programme and you want to see what the weather forecast is er you can have that superimposed on your programme.And, and the other way
*PET:	What in a, in a    (.)  (        ) 
*FRE:	No, no over the top.
*PET:	Over the top?
*FRE:	Over the top.
*PET:	Oh I see.
*FRE:	And the other thing erm which er er is good, supposing you're watching er a programme and there's a football match on and you're interested in the, the football   (.) er but you don't really want to keep, you know, switching to find out what the score is, er I'm talking about teletext as opposed to a programme, you press the update and it w er and if something's happened, you know, they've changed and there's been a score, it'll come up er   ((laugh)) er while you're watching the programme, er it'll let you know that erm there's been something happening. (.) Er it's, it's amazing. (.) 
*PET:	I don't know what that is.It's not you is it?
*FRE:	It isn't, no.Is it, it's not your er central heating is it?
*PET:	Ah   (.) might be.It might be. (.) Yes that, that sounds like it.
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*PET:	Yes the erm   (.) these things,an and can you er can you record   (.) teletext?
*FRE:	No, I tried that the other day.No. (.) Yo fr er you're talking about video?
*PET:	Yeah.
*FRE:	Yeah. (.) 
*PET:	And if you're playing a tape back   (.) which was recorded off air   (.) what happens if you push the text button? (.) 
*FRE:	Don't know.
*PET:	Because the data, you see, the two lines, I would have thought would have been recorded
*FRE:	 ((sigh)) 
*PET:	without you meaning it to be recorded 
*FRE:	Ah well I can let me er say this, er   (.) you, you know how some programmes er you can have erm   (.) oh you may not know    (.)  ((cough)) excuse me   (.) erm there are certain programmes which you can er put in eight eight eight and you get captions
*PET:	Ah ye yes,i if that's available.
*FRE:	If it's available.
*PET:	Yes, yes.
*FRE:	Erm now if you record that programme and then, on video, and then play it back you can't put in eight eight eight and get it.
*PET:	Oh. (.) Mm i it, I, I, I, I d I dunno as I say i i it, it, it seems to me to be an incredibly clever
*FRE:	You would enjoy it. ((laugh)) 
*PET:	arrangement.
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah 
*PET:	But erm     (.)  (        )  (.) The television of course i is infernally clever, I mean th there's er no doubt that the microchips that erm   (.) takes away the erm the teletext information, stores it and then spits up whatever you ask for is er   (.) two or three P now I suppose and therefore the, the television manufacturer charges hundred pounds to put it in.
*FRE:	Mm.
*PET:	It's er   (.) it's    (        )  (.) you're, you're, you're, you're quite erm   (.) hooked on it?
*FRE:	Ah well yes I wouldn't like to be without it now.Definitely not. (.) 
*PET:	And is, is there much difference between er Ceefax and Oracle?
*FRE:	 ((sigh)) Well  (.) 
*PET:	They look more or less the same do they?
*FRE:	Yeah I mean the news is very similar of course erm
*PET:	Presumably that's indicated   (.) or is it?Dunno because I think it isn't actually come to think of it   (.) B B C will do their own and I T V will do their own   (        ) 
*FRE:	Oh yeah oh it's definitely their own, yes.Yeah. (.) Yeah.So I'm a bit of a newshound so I look at both of course, see what's what.I'm er I'm not saying I, the headlines you see, so I will select the headline I'm interested in. (.) 
*PET:	And would
*FRE:	And then it'll come up, you know, I'll put in w er one O two is the headlines for Ceefax for instance and then the stories will be from one O three to about one one five or something like that you see.And er   (.) th so er if I'm interested in er George Bush's illness, you know, and that's one O four I'll put in one O four and then that will come up on the screen. (.) 
*PET:	So presumably   (.) wh wh what bank are you with? (.) 
*FRE:	What   (.) I'm with Barclays.
*PET:	Oh   (.) I suspect they're   (        ) you bank with   (.) totally ignorable.If you're with er National Westminster   (.) erm   (.) y y y y you, you, you know about these, these, these   (.) cash tills that you put a card in and
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	ask it questions, it's obviously on the telephone   (.) because you can ask what the balance is and it will tell you, and it can't possibly know that   (.) and Cleethorpes, when you put the card in the Cleethorpes thing, that, you know, your bank balance at Nottingham is   (.) so it's obviously on the telephone erm and it's on the telephone to a central computer which holds quite a lot of information, it accesses 
*FRE:	Quite.
*PET:	it very very quickly
*FRE:	That's right, yeah.
*PET:	 (        ) so   (.) why shouldn't you telephone that computer? (.) And the answer is, no reason at all.And if you're with National Westminster, you telephone a, a n a number in Manchester or Birmingham or two or three other places I guess but as far as we're concerned er the Birmingham Manchester one's the cheapest   (.) you, you ring them up and you give them A your identification number   (.) and it immediately tells you what your balance is.Immediately.What do you want to do?Well of course there's a whole range of things you can order, you know, chequebooks and bank statements, you can do all s all sorts of things 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*PET:	you can do with the till in the wall
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	but you can also say I want a transaction too and the machine then comes back to you with one of these sepulchral voices, you know, which is tone 
*FRE:	Yes 
*PET:	generated or whatever, who do you wish to pay to, and   (.) we have four erm electricity board, the gas board, the er er er   (.) credit card and the, can't remember what the fourth one is, you simply say I wanna   (.) pay number four   (.) how much do you wish to pay to the Royal Bank of Scotland   (.) and you say how much you wish to pay in, er in pence   (.) and it immediately says you wish to pay blah blah blah   (.) it will be done.Couple of days later a little note comes in the post saying that you've just paid the National West National Bank   (        ) Bank of Scotland   (.) twenty three pounds thirty   ((laugh)) and it's absolutely brilliant! (.) Barclays haven't got one yet?
*FRE:	Well er er I think not because I would have heard, I mean obviously they would've er  (.) 
*PET:	Well er Nat West have been very quiet about Action Line erm because they haven't quite got the   (.) the, the, all the   (.) firmware sorted out yet but it's absolutely fantastic, you know 
*FRE:	Mm 
*PET:	it's just, just   (        ) erm   (.) but i i i er er have you got a, a tone telephone or a pulse telephone? (.) It's probably a switch 
*FRE:	I've got several  ((laugh)) 
*PET:	Well erm probably on the back you can select whether it er sends a number by   (.) pulse, and you can tell actually cos it's very   (.) you d you'll dial   (        ) 
*FRE:	Well the old dial was pulse   (.) was  (.) 
*PET:	The twiddle dial?
*FRE:	Yeah.
*PET:	Oh yes
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*PET:	but some push button telephones send   (.) one as one pulse   (.) and two as two pulses
*FRE:	Yes.
*PET:	whereas others send wuls er one as a beep and two as a ooh
*FRE:	Ah
*PET:	in other words the pitch of the 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.I think mine are erm the pulse type, mm.
*PET:	Well usually erm modern telephones have got a switch on the back and you can switch them to pulse or tone
*FRE:	Oh?I don't think mine have. (.) 
*PET:	One of those four switches across the top is the pulse tone.
*FRE:	Oh yeah I can see that. (.) Yeah.
*PET:	But erm you bleep with one, one of ours is, is, is erm on   (.) tones now and you can tell the diff you, you, you can tell
