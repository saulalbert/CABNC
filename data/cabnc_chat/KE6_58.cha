*SAN:	No
*WEN:	I mean you have to wonder
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	I mean they all joined the club but Sue used to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	mm, anyway not only that one Emma erm   (.) been
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	she don't want to go to college or something new and erm she's doing something, must be finals I would think, think it must be finals and er Sue said to her well should she pack up
*SAN:	Yeah she's a couple of years younger so she's 
*WEN:	Mm 
*SAN:	probably got A levels this May, whatever
*WEN:	erm should she pack up her Saturday job, it pays around twenty pound and it will go up to about twenty five, and Sue and Will sat and talked about it and she got, she's surprising been interviewed for the W R A F but I mean that's not gonna be so easy these days, I mean they're gonna take the exceptionals that they need aren't they?And Sue said she's got nothing in view apart from that and she said to her you must have alternatives, she's not applied to anybody or enquired about anything
*SAN:	Police Force are recruiting
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SAN:	again
*WEN:	Are they?

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	well, erm tisn't, she's not, she wants the W R A F and nothing else and Sue said you can't be like that, you know, and er, so they've decided that she's gotta carry on with this Saturday job because she won't be able to go on the dole look, straight away will she?
*SAN:	No
*WEN:	And Income Support I think is, what did she say for her age twenty I think
*SAN:	I know

*WEN:	Mm

*WEN:	That's right
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	something , something like, like that, anyway so she said er
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	she said it's hard enough for people with jobs to exist today without all this and she's gone back to college on the flexi idea, erm, brush up her typing because she said, now whether she's thinking of future years, she said when she left here that time, although she got that job she said it wasn't easy, she said because I had no bits of paper as such, although when I did the test I passed it, she said it wasn't simple, so she's doing
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and not sure about Friday evening and er she said then she'll have trouble getting the money over that's out of them, why the redundancy because been there over two year, so I presume redundancy or holidays or both so Sue said to her well if they were so good to you in the past, but that ain't the point is it?They did all, they did
*SAN:	Mm
*WEN:	on their own back, she didn't ask for it and June ain't worked since Christmas, so er, I says I know what it's like with my sister   (.) and I mean she's been right in it ain't she?
