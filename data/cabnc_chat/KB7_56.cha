        It's a lot of money. •_•
*JEA:	I didn't think it would be that. •_•
        Well the solicitor just took that off the price of the house. •_•
*ANN:	Well that's it, they just they just see to it all. •_•
        You don't know how many, how much  •_•
*JEA:	Yeah but see they can't do that with you cos you're not selling a house. •_•

*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	You know, so  ooh they're crafty aren't they? •_•

        Not to worry, all these things come to try you. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•

        He had to put your name down on it. •_•
*JEA:	Did he? •_•
*ANN:	As you're next er his next of kin and you will   the property will become yours. •_•
*JEA:	You'll have to  •_•
*STU:	Is that alright? •_•
*JEA:	You'll have to make a will now then. •_•
*STU:	If you don't want all the  chips don't bother  •_•
*ANN:	Oh I don't want as that, I didn't want as that. •_•
        I said a couple. •_•
*STU:	Well that is a couple. •_•
*ANN:	 ((laugh))

*ANN:	Don't matter does it? •_•
*JEA:	No, but you should do. •_•
        Aye it does matter! •_•
        Does matter. •_•
*ANN:	I say I can't see you saying right  he's died today, out tomorrow can you? •_•
*JEA:	I didn't think I'd get anything anyway. •_•
*ANN:	You're his next of kin you see. •_•
*JEA:	Am I? •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	How about his father? •_•
        Yeah, how about his father? •_•
*ANN:	he didn't mention it. •_•
        Your name's on it now. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah but his father's his next of kin just as much as I am Ann. •_•
        put that out, I'll put that out  cos you'll not get any peace. •_•
        You won't get any peace Ann. •_•
        I'll put that out. •_•
*ANN:	Well your name's on it so that's it. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah but I was just saying, when you think about it. •_•
        See, there's all these complications. •_•
        If anything happens to me. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah but if you're the named person. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
        I don't know whether his father is   probably is isn't he? •_•

*STU:	For the pension purpose, for the pension plan a medical is not needed. •_•
        That is, doesn't matter. •_•
*ANN:	Oh well. •_•
*JEA:	Oh. •_•
*STU:	The only thing that I might need a medical for is my thirty thousand pound life insurance. •_•
*JEA:	Oh. •_•

*ANN:	that Stuart's done the right thing. •_•
        It's him that's signed it. •_•
*JEA:	Well why? •_•
        Why shouldn't he? •_•
*ANN:	Well  •_•
*JEA:	He's done it with you, you're, he's got  he's got you with him. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	Hasn't he? •_•
        It's not just him Ann. •_•
*ANN:	Well at least he knows with this  mortgage and that, he knows what  it's all about. •_•
        It's not like one of us going in and not  •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	understanding and just signing papers. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	At least he knows and he •_•
*JEA:	What you're doing. •_•
*ANN:	questions and he, he understands it all. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Which a lot of people would, say they go and sit down there and they say  blah blah blah sign here and  •_•
*JEA:	It's not fair but that is what happens. •_•
*ANN:	It's what happens because you don't understand all the •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*ANN:	terms and the things they use. •_•
        You don't know what they're on about. •_•
*JEA:	No you don't. •_•
*ANN:	I mean even today he'd made a mistake on that thing and you spotted it where I wouldn't have done. •_•
*JEA:	Oh my god. •_•
        He must be •_•
*ANN:	He didn't take tax relief off. •_•
        Cos Stuart will get tax relief and he hadn't put that down. •_•
        But Stuart noticed it straight away. •_•
*JEA:	is he much cop, this bloke? •_•
*STU:	I think  I mean, it's something, a pension mortgage is something that doesn't crop up  every day. •_•
*ANN:	No, not many you've got  I don't know why. •_•
*JEA:	They don't know how to cope with it. •_•
*ANN:	I don't know why it doesn't crop up because it's cheaper than an ordinary one, so why it doesn't  •_•
*JEA:	Because they don't want  yeah well you you'd better tell your mates at work that. •_•
*ANN:	Why it doesn't I don't know. •_•
        I don't understand that. •_•
        And not only does  •_•
*JEA:	Is it cheaper than an ordinary one? •_•
*ANN:	Well it is as it's  it's worked out a few pounds cheaper. •_•
*STU:	It can  it can be yeah. •_•
        It can   •_•
*ANN:	But not only that at the end he's also, as well as the house he's getting a pension as well instead of just the house. •_•
*JEA:	Well that's what I mean. •_•
        That's what I mean. •_•
        You get a just an ordinary pension, thing, you know  mortgage. •_•
        You don't get a pension at the end of it. •_•
        You're gonna get a pension as well. •_•
*ANN:	Well that's it. •_•
*JEA:	Well that's not bad. •_•
*ANN:	Well er I'd never heard of it. •_•
        I'd never heard of it. •_•
*JEA:	Not only that you see  alright the mortgage rates might go up but  I mean if you're working your wages are gonna go up Stuart. •_•
        Aren't they? •_•
        You'll have a pay rise and and you're gonna still be paying you know? •_•
        So as the years go past  •_•
*ANN:	Pay an average amount of your wage, whatever. •_•
*JEA:	As the years go past  I mean if the wages go up as they have done, you know, regularly  your mortgage is gonna gonna gonna be smaller. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah that's that's what happens with people now. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	People who are paying seventy eighty pound a month mortgage who've had them for years and then  •_•
*JEA:	Years. •_•
        That's right. •_•
        And the same thing will happen to you, see. •_•
        And then you'll be pleased. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	You've started. •_•
        I mean I know it's hard to start with. •_•
        Isn't it? •_•
        It is difficult. •_•
*ANN:	But we've got all that side sorted out haven't we? •_•
*JEA:	It's difficult. •_•
        I mean we paid eight , eight pound a month  •_•
*ANN:	Er er  •_•
*JEA:	and that was a hell of a lot of money. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah well that's it, if your wages are only eight quid a week  if you're paying a month's  •_•
*JEA:	That's right. •_•
*ANN:	one week of your wages out it's  •_•
*JEA:	We were. •_•
        I remember that. •_•
        Halifax Building Society. •_•
        Used to, I used to have to pay it. •_•
*ANN:	has to come out of his bank. •_•
        Every month. •_•
        It'll just be took automatically  •_•
*JEA:	Yeah well they didn't have them in these days Ann. •_•
*ANN:	out of your bank, won't it? •_•
*JEA:	Direct debit. •_•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	His money his money will be gone and we'll live on ours, mine. •_•
        So I mean it's just  the same whatever isn't it? •_•
*JEA:	That's it. •_•
        You can survive. •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah we'll be alright. •_•
        As I say if they took my wages into consideration they would have let us buy next door even. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*ANN:	They would. •_•
        I mean it would have been a hell of a lot of  •_•
*JEA:	I think  nice as this next door here. •_•
*ANN:	Well it would have been a hell of a lot of money. •_•
*JEA:	How about that one across the way? •_•
*ANN:	Well that's it you see. •_•
        But if if I'd have, if we'd have gone joint we'd have had enough  •_•
*JEA:	Wouldn't you, if if if if you had Ann if you had the choice of these two  what would you rather have? •_•
