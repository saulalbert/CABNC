*IAN:	Dan lived in town 
*ENI:	Mike was at university.Yes

*IAN:	Yes.I must say it's, it   (.) must be good to have somebody like that er 
*NOE:	Absolutely.
*IAN:	o over there cos it, it must be   (.) must have felt quite isolated   (        ) 
*ENI:	Yes.Oh he would if he hadn't got them 
*IAN:	Yes.
*ENI:	certainly.
*IAN:	Yes.
*ENI:	I mean it's lovely because he   (.) er he adores to get into   (        ) does Edmund and that means that he and George go about this lovely big er   (.) grounds that they've 
*IAN:	Yes.
*ENI:	got   (.) and Edmund does lots of grass cutting and er

*NOE:	 (        ) let me see, Dan is the same age as John isn't he?As Ben, no   (.) Edmund isn't he?
*ENI:	Erm
*IAN:	I think he's a bit older.

*ENI:	He's younger than John

*ENI:	Are you thirty f 
*IAN:	Thirty four.

*IAN:	Couple of years older?
*ENI:	Not as much as that.
*IAN:	 (        ) oh.
*ENI:	Well 
*NOE:	 (        ) before they were married.
*IAN:	Really?
*ENI:	Yes.
*IAN:	Gosh.
*ENI:	Yes Dan must be   (.) I would have thought it's only months probably, but it might be quite a few months.
*IAN:	Mm. (        ) 
*ENI:	Mm I don't think it's more because we soon had, started having our children didn't we?
*IAN:	Mm.
*ENI:	Erm   (.) ooh wait a minute we're saying, we're saying than Edmund aren't we?
*NOE:	Yes mm.

*IAN:	Dan was?
*ENI:	Dan was.
*NOE:	Yes.
*IAN:	Oh right.Yes.
*ENI:	Ya.So I'm v I'm a bit vague about it, you may well be right and it's two years
*IAN:	Mm.
*ENI:	because of course we've got older children than Edmund.
*NOE:	That would line him up with Edmund though wouldn't it?No
*IAN:	Yes 
*ENI:	No 
*IAN:	no   (        ) 
*ENI:	no, a couple of years you're quite right.

*IAN:	he was delightfully vague
*NOE:	 (        ) 
*ENI:	Oh   (        ) he's an absolutely 
*IAN:	 ((laugh)) but I was never really sure   [laughing] what he was doing  [] .
