*IRI:	Well you've gotta have an electric meter in every house love. •190724_191166•
*ALI:	Erm not a ten pence one? •191182_191556•
*IRI:	No. •191563_191583•
*ALI:	Oh. •191646_191666•
        I thought it was one of them. •191666_192094•
*IRI:	It means it's inside, ours is outside. •192094_192293•
*ALI:	Oh I thought it was one of them fifty pence ones. •192293_192791•
*IRI:	Well what difference does it make? •192794_192997•
*ALI:	Well I thought it'd be better if •192997_193171•
*IRI:	I don't understand the double panelled radiators not presently connected. •193220_193680•
        I don't know what it means  whether it's electric or  wait a minute there's some more. •193680_194502•
