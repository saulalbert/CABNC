*HAY:	Pair of us had panic attacks didn't we?
*DEB:	I had a panic attack, I told her, I said I'm shaking all over.And I thought if I go from behind this bar now I'll never go back behind it now.So I calmed down see and I was alright after about ten minutes.But this year it was much better because they'd let them all in because it was raining weren't it?So they couldn't leave them all standing outside.
*HAY:	Bloody stupid anyway.
*DEB:	So when they walked in here it was packed in there and it was full in the bar.
*HAY:	Even if they'd let them in let them get their seats and said look the bar is not open.
*DEB:	Well that's what they should do every year because do you know what it was much better this year.
