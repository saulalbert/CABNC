*JAN:	Well I don't know, just er, I don't know really, I don't want to mind cos he's been there five years, so if he does get made redundant he's got a chance of getting a little bit of money, not a lot, but it would help. Story of four people   ((reading)) this is a story of four people named everybody, somebody, anybody and nobody, there was an important job to be done and everybody was sure that somebody could do it, anybody could of done it, but nobody did, somebody got angry about that because it was everybody's job, everybody thought anybody could do it, but nobody would .
