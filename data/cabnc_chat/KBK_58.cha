*CHR:	Question is, how much of it do we pass on? ((laugh))  
*LYN:	Is   (  ) associate  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Yes, it's the  (.)  
*LYN:	 (  ) what have they said about the offer they've had already? 
*CHR:	Erm, yes they have,for   (.) forgive me, I'll just finish this if you don't mind, I'm, I'm almost there, one O ten point three eight. Well erm   (.) he came back on the twenty fourth, no, never mind that   ((laugh)) we   (.) we've been to-ing and fro-ing have Asian Associates and I and  (.)

I wrote back saying, get on with it, and incidentally we overestimated the shipment cost, brought it down to about half, got to be awfully careful there, because some of these bits are so big, they  (  ) , and today he said, customer will make decision only after ten days, since final size of assortment is under preparation, meantime with your offered price and revised delivery time, it looks very difficult to book this order. Price of electrodes is, seems alright, however plate prices are very high. Please offer per piece or kilo. Now   have changed it from per kilo to per piece. 
*LYN:	How had you offered  (  ) ?  ((phone rings))Would you have the choice? 
*CHR:	I don't, you'd off  offer per kilo  (  ) .
