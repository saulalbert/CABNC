*CHR:	Most most people play this er with a fairly conventional croquet stroke because the black ball's the blue ball's gonna go twice the distance of the red. Isn't it? 
*DAV:	Yes. 
*CHR:	Roughly. 
*DAV:	Yes. 
*CHR:	So really just I I always have problems, I I always tend to play it down like that, I don't know why. But most, you should really stand up and play it with fairly, (  ) play together.

*LYN:	Ivan Ivan! (  )

*CHR:	or the blue I mean the red's gone all right. But that's what we're trying to do, trying  (  )  
*DAV:	Right. Okay. 
*CHR:	 (  )  (.) play the shot like that way, but I think whatever works for you.
