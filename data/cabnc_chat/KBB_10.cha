        In fact er just before I retired they were saying, you know, my job's obsolete and that, and then  and says oh we're opening up a big depot in Japan. •169028_170224•

*TOM:	Yeah. •171694_171698•
*ART:	Cos I've been silly in the past, I've told Evelyn lots of times and  we had a new machine, a rapid nailer, it er  nailed er army er soles onto the  at five it used to do three hundred and fifty nails a minute and we made one just for  I er went out on the road, er to five hundred a minute you see, and er we were building the first half a dozen and er  er there's two pawls at the back of the machine  •171699_174753•
*EVE:	Ooh we don't want to know. •174787_174916•
*ART:	Ah but there's a rack and one goes on and holds the horn post up to the boot while it's driven, then it comes out  and there's two, one's half a tooth, so it ensures one or the other's in, and they work like that. •174916_176360•
        So I was spinning the cam round, it hadn't got pinned to the shaft, just spinning it round on the shaft and these pawls were doing this  and Les , the top one, he went to Kettering and then Don, the next top one, he went to er  •176521_177795•
*EVE:	We don't want to know all this. •177795_178095•
*ART:	er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden, and er this top one,, and his mate come out of the toilet, been for a smoke, and er walking by I said hey Les, look at this, and I spun the cam round and it went bang and stopped dead. •178099_179612•
        He said well you've got no bloody springs on the pawls, I says  so I picked a tin of springs up, we kept it for anybody who wanted a spring for their bike, any spring where, you know the hooks on each end? •179632_180814•
*TOM:	Mm. •180814_180854•
*ART:	Well they broke off in wear and when you was overhauling a machine you'd throw these springs in the tin in case you ever wanted one. •180854_181649•
        And he said er  oh he says er er there's no, your spring's broke. •181661_182088•
        I so I showed him this tin full, I says well look they do break don't they? •182088_182535•
        Anyway, do you know the easiest, er and at that time five pound were five pound, if I 'd 've gone to the foreman and then the er   •182607_183410•
*EVE:	Drawing office. •183410_183475•
*ART:	drawing office, I 'd 've got five pound on a suggestion. •183476_183804•

*ART:	near Kettering, Don went to er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden  and er I'd been there about a year and all of a sudden there was a call in for Shorteners at  so I went down on the bike and er  what er the one over me who, who was elderly, well wasn't over me but he was er  he was on my job but the senior man on it  he come in, the boss had sent him in to have a look cos the er Shorteners were complaining, and er then they rang up for one of us, he said well I'm not leaving till I've solved this problem so I had to go. •184343_188052•
        But er  all he did was, you know the two pawls that go in and out? •188052_188443•
        He made a bit of eight inch wire, like er a U piece, and the bar at, bottom bar of the U held the tail so if the springs broke the tails didn't duck under and smash the cam. •188443_189764•
        It'd smashed the cam and, and the lever and bent the shaft  colossal expense at that time. •189764_190471•

*ART:	I,but  I reckon you've got a bit of money in the in the frame. •243875_244424•
        Cos I was  •244465_244616•
*EVE:	Oh that lady who came with this, she said er  Arthur happened to say he'd just bought it, and she said how much did they charge you, twenty five pounds or thirty pounds? •244616_245652•
*TOM:	Mm. •245652_245665•
*EVE:	So I said no, only twenty. •245665_245974•
        So apparently  she said ooh he probably charges, perhaps if he's not very  he reduces the price  but  funny she said twenty five pounds. •245974_247144•
*ART:	She seemed to know about it. •247144_247269•
*JAC:	Yeah. •247272_247294•
*ART:	And it's funny they came together and she, she pushed  •247294_247517•
*EVE:	She knew, not quite together. •247517_247635•
*ART:	in while I were  with the other chap . •247635_247716•

*ART:	Well  •247961_247995•
*EVE:	oh he's come back  for the, this, to show to you. •247995_248418•
*JAC:	Mm. •248418_248435•
*EVE:	I thought perhaps he'd been to you and  sort of were you interested and he he'd come back. •248447_249004•
        But it was only a second  •249004_249064•
*EVE:	No. •249064_249067•
*EVE:	after er sort of I'd more or less half a second  and I thought oh he's come back again   •249067_249344•
*ART:	But, but I had more to do with her than Evelyn but er from what little bits I've gleaned, you know, er I'm a bit into everything like, and I seem to think, I've got a strange feeling that she's something to do with education and they're worried about children not speaking properly  •249353_251158•
*EVE:	No! •251240_251276•
*ART:	let me finish. •251292_251395•
        Er eventually they won't speak real English, with all this Asian kids in  now all the Asian children have gotta go in any school haven't they and everything, well sooner or later er this mixture of languages is gonna spoil the English language isn't it? •251419_253119•

*EVE:	No what they'll do, they'll put all the words that are used into a computer er from all these things won't they? •253261_253868•
        And then they'll see how many  are sort of used a lot and  percentage and that's what they'll do. •253887_254563•
*TOM:	Mm. •254564_254565•
        But as Arthur says though perhaps some of the Asian words will start being used by the English people. •254565_254929•
