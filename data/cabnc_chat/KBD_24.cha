*HUG:	But

*BAR:	when it prints out   (.) the bottom   (.) of like the noughts and, the bottom of the figure is missing, you can read it, it's not important, but it's done because the one, it wo it's punching onto, onto metal   (.) because that paper's not on our till receipt.

*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	 (        ) for one pub.

*HUG:	Well I, I, I, I honestly thought the bar should have done  (        ) , and I'm sure it fucking did you know.
*BAR:	Didn't have enough people in   (.) to do anything else.
*HUG:	I dunno.
*BAR:	We'd have had, they'd have had to spent about five quid a head.
*HUG:	Yeah but they were.Like the shorts were absolutely hammered!Like there were them lads    (        )  (.) they had fucking four in a glass like and, there was loads of, so many drinks like   (.) I served loads.Vod vodka   (.) Jack Daniels and   (.) some other spirit in it. (.) I ju I just wanna know how much Terri took, you know  (        ) .

*BAR:	Aha.
*HUG:	were crap or something.Kevin er, Kevin I think his name is.
*BAR:	She's just though, she's   [laughing] fucking outrageous  [] !She doesn't know what she's doing half the time! (.) Like you go, even saying I did serve quite a bit faster than her, which I do like, you know she still should o  (.) i if the bar done seven fifty she should have, she should have done what   (.) two, three and a half?
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*HUG:	At least, like.Well she, I mean, she might have done it.She should have done a bit more than that actually.
*BAR:	Mm.
*HUG:	She should have been doing three hundred. (.) Still leaves me a hundred and fifty ahead of her like, you know.Like, you didn't serve any drinks did you Barry?
*BAR:	No.No.Er 
*HUG:	So all
*BAR:	twenty, twenty quid's worth maybe at the end.Not much. (.) If it's gonna be like that we do need a glass collector don't we?We need somebody on to collect glasses.
*HUG:	But er, there wasn't really any   (.) even though it was quite, we, we, we did have quite a lot of glasses.Mind you, they would have gone and broke if we line them up.
*BAR:	Yeah, but Ka Katrin wasn't, Katrin wasn't. (        ) 
*HUG:	She'd got no, oh that's right, yeah.
*BAR:	You know
*HUG:	Well that's another thing, I think that black man as well is getting drinks as well. (.) Mind you, you wouldn't mind, you'd give him a couple like, if you 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	help us, you 
*BAR:	No.
*HUG:	know like.
*BAR:	Well that's right, I mean, you know, two or, two or three drinks to us is only costing like a quid, well it's only a quid.
*HUG:	Yeah, but she's been caught doing it as well.Ach!It's not the point, Jean put o said to me last week about the fucking  (        ) . (.) Like, and there's other people in there that are   (.) you know, they should be wrote down, and she looked at me 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	like.
*BAR:	Yeah. (.) Oh yeah, I mean, they're gonna have to be from now on cos we're not gonna be, you know, we're gonna be   (.) responsible to 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	somebody else, not just ourselves, you know.Okay, if we wa if we want to turn a blind eye to it then that's our business you know   (.) but er   (.) but when you're, when you're actually erm 
*HUG:	Answerable to someone else.
*BAR:	Yeah.Present accounts to somebody else you can't do it like that can you?You know water's looking disgusting! (.) What other results were there last night?
*HUG:	Er   (.) Forest 
*BAR:	The 
*HUG:	won four two.
*BAR:	Oh did they?
*HUG:	Doing really well. (        ) . (.) Liverpool drew one each with Bristol Rovers.
*BAR:	That don't sound right.
*HUG:	I've seen it, seen that one   (.) I've seen that match   (.) they were lucky.
*BAR:	Sunderland   (.) won, who were they playing?
*HUG:	Sunderland won.Er   (.) Oxford I think.They were winning three nil   (.) three two at the end of it.Oxford scored one on the end   (        ) 
*BAR:	Not many first division teams left is there?
*HUG:	Nine.
*BAR:	About   (.) nine is there?
*HUG:	Wrexham were unlucky against Blackburn.
*BAR:	Oh!Weren't they?Didn't they play well?
*HUG:	Yes!They've always been a 
*BAR:	I thought they played 
*HUG:	good club side   (.) Wrexham.
*BAR:	Yeah, they have but I mean, they got a lot of good skilful young lads haven't they?They're only like nineteen and twenty 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and   (.) I mean that young fullback looked brilliant!That lef 
*HUG:	Yeah.Mm mm.Quite good.Composed as well like.Talented.
*BAR:	Yeah. (.) It's a funny law that er   (.) clear chance at goal job innit?I mean it's a   (.) funny definition. (.) I must admit I, I   (.) if you could stop that deliberate foul it's   (.) I mean it's better for the game if you can stop it.
*HUG:	Send them off.
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.That's right.I mean if you're gonna do it 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	do it, do it, do it 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	consistently. (.) Cos, actually, the other thing about defenders hauling people down like that, you know, how many times when a forward's through one on one on a goal keeper does he score?It's not that often actually.
*HUG:	No.
*BAR:	I mean, okay, somebody like Besty 
*HUG:	Thing you want 
*BAR:	you could bet on
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	nine times out of ten, but 
*HUG:	But even, even against the goalkeeper they fucking lose fifty percent of the, like 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	I was saying   (.) more than fifty percent of the playing 
*BAR:	Yeah, I would, yeah.Yeah.Yeah.
*HUG:	And that's all just   (.) one on one on the goalkeeper.
*BAR:	Yeah. (.) Well that's what I mean, I mean, you know,th th the player could let him, could let him go really without deliberately fouling him because   (.) it's, it's gonna 
*HUG:	Half the 
*BAR:	be at least a fifty fifty
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	chance that the goalkeeper's gonna save it innit?
*HUG:	It's fucking gotta be straight like that, I, I, I don't fucking   (.) taking off three points for a    (        )  (.)  (        ) .At the start it seemed to improve the matches but it, they've just become too hectic now I think.
*BAR:	Mm.
*HUG:	You know, there's not as much skill involved as there was.
*BAR:	No.No, that's right.It's
*HUG:	Like the
*BAR:	incredibly passed.
*HUG:	the first, the first season like the football did seem to improve but it's not
*BAR:	That's right.
*HUG:	gonna go back now I think.
*BAR:	United have got a strange side at the moment though 
*HUG:	Oh yes.
*BAR:	I mean I don't think you can   (.) it's alright having all these players but if you   (.) he doesn't seem 
*HUG:	They don't play.
*BAR:	he doesn't seem to 
*HUG:	They 
*BAR:	have an idea of what he wants.Cos I mean 
*HUG:	No they don't.
*BAR:	every week he's got a different sort of format.
*HUG:	Well what's he supposed to do? (        ) Giggs, Semen  (        ) .
*BAR:	Well he had him 
*HUG:	Well I think he's gotta look at, and the team should be in with you 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	like.
*BAR:	He had him playing yesterday, er, but they dropped Hughes.
*HUG:	 [laughing] Yeah I know  [] .Well you don't drop Hughes for anybody!
*BAR:	And his two subs, Hughes and Sharp, I mean it does rather hamstring 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you if anything happens to a central defender dunnit?
*HUG:	Yeah.Well I don't think Hughes should ever be sub like, he should be on the team.
*BAR:	Well that's right, even if he's not scoring goals he's creating so much pressure and, and 
*HUG:	Yeah, he always done like.Good in defence as well.
*BAR:	Yeah.That's right.Well he's also summat, er I mean he's, he's one of the best   (.) at holding a ball   (.) you know 
*HUG:	Fantastic shielding the ball 
*BAR:	on his own.
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	Whitbreads are here. (.) Arsenal 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	played well.
*BAR:	Yeah. (.) The crowd were getting at them last night.
*HUG:	Were they?
*BAR:	The first goal was dreadful!My   (.) did you see it?
*HUG:	They were winning three nil weren't they?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	Did you see this goal?
*HUG:	No.I remember seeing, but I heard fucking result on News at Ten.
*BAR:	It was a long 
*HUG:	I know.
*BAR:	it was a   (.) it was full pass inside to two fullbacks   (.) er, for the   (.) Southampton player that was running on   (.) this fullback shaded it away   (.) you know, guiding him out of it, he's running to the e  (.) sa Smeichel came out to the edge of the area   (.) but he was like right on the edge   (.) as the player was coming to him, so he just let it roll a little bit further, he stopped it with his foot, the guy came and tackled him off   (.) got it   (.) instead of just picking it up with his hand, I mean he was actually in the area but like   (.) he was right on the edge and he took a step back 
*HUG:	Why the fuck didn't he  (        ) 
*BAR:	and stopped it with his foot.Yeah.
*HUG:	wait for the ball coming in? (.) I tell you Liverpool were really lucky cos er   (.) Bristol Rovers had got a penalty.
*BAR:	Mm. (.) As long they, as long as they win the league I do I don't mind. (.) Been a long time.Mind you 
*HUG:	I know.
*BAR:	Leeds are still   (.) bloody doing well though.
*HUG:	 ((laugh))  (.)  (        )  (.) They won three nil last week didn't they?
*BAR:	Yeah.Oh every week they   (.) putting it together, scoring the goals.
*HUG:	I think they were about a hundred and fifty to one I'm standing see if they can win the league.
*BAR:	Are they?
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Yeah. (.) Wouldn't be a bad that actually, cos if it did
*HUG:	Yeah, they played well the year before they held their own see they've got all the 
*BAR:	They played last year didn't they?
*HUG:	the best lads.
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean they're, they ended up about   (.) what were they, about fifth or something weren't they?
*HUG:	Yeah, last year.Aha.
*BAR:	And they bought er players didn't they?They put, you know, started to buy a few   (.) you know, like Dorego and things like that.Wallace   (.) not a bad buy.
*HUG:	Arsenal are playing terrible aren't they?
*BAR:	Mm.
*HUG:	Roecastle's started to play well again this
*BAR:	Yeah. (.) It was an awful goal that United gave away weren't it?
*HUG:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	We I mean, it was only Palaster in, in that half.And where the hell the fullbacks were!
*HUG:	In wonderland.
