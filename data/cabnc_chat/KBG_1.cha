@Comment:	conversation #1 (Tape 033601)
*SUS:	You've gotta carry it around with you. •51925_89525•
*CAR:	It's on volume ten. •90325_134725•
*SUS:	Well it says, like the microphone here look. •166125_185225•
        You've got to  put it at chest height •193525_211425•
*CAR:	Mm. •213225_216925•
*SUS:	make sure it's knocked or covered by clothing. •221225_245725•
        Cos if you have to brush  it won't break the  quality. •262125_305025•
        If you're at home you can put the machine and microphone on the table near where it will still pick up conversation. •306625_372425•
        Does that I mean work by a  from now on. •372925_389625•
*CAR:	Probably. •404325_408025•
*SUS:	Right  right and giving things away. •408925_446025•
*CAR:	There's nothing to give away. •454625_464425•
*SUS:	Where's your tapes? •464425_470225•
*CAR:	Yeah, there's a load of tapes! •476225_485225•
*SUS:	It's a lot isn't it? •485225_489925•
*CAR:	I think they're all  I think they're ninety minutes. •489925_511925•
*SUS:	Ninety minutes on each tape! •519825_528325•
        Good grief! •528325_530425•
*CAR:	Well forty , I think they're C nineties. •535725_549525•
*SUS:	Well I can talk the hind leg off a donkey, will  •549525_567725•
*CAR:	Oh  •567725_569525•
*SUS:	all that  •569525_574425•
*CAR:	God! •574425_576325•
*SUS:	! •_•
*CAR:	Yes I know. •578725_596525•
*SUS:	It makes you feel very •610825_620925•
*CAR:	No, I don't think about it, just let it run. •626525_643725•
*SUS:	Look at him! •643725_651525•
        Well I couldn't care cos I don't like taping  so I shouldn't ! •651525_680825•
*CAR:	Well  it's never stopped you before! •691025_709425•
*SUS:	 ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Mm. •711125_713225•
*SUS:	Not right now though. •726225_751325•
        Oh! •751325_754825•
        I've got a cup of tea. •756825_768625•
*CAR:	No, you were right what you said though about •776025_789925•
*SUS:	Mm. •799525_801825•
*CAR:	Matthew. •802425_808325•
*SUS:	Yeah I just  it just seems to me such a complete  and utter waste of of, his time primarily  for fifteen, I mean this being identified a year earlier which  we reckon it was  you would think that  even given  all the red tape and everything else •827825_105792•
*CAR:	I'll have to look up his records at least. •106192_107192•
*SUS:	You know it makes you  well it makes you wonder whether  something could be done without placing him, for his sake! •107432_112722•
        Cos he's never gonna achieve anything in an ordinary class. •112722_115202•
        He's just got such a downer on himself •116132_118102•
*CAR:	Mm. •118102_118212•
*SUS:	and he's he's got such a  a negative  way of looking at himself  and everybody else looks at him that way now. •118212_129552•
        Cos he he, he cannot be positive  he contributes nothing! •129552_134082•
*CAR:	It's hard being positive  •134672_135912•
*SUS:	In his own eyes. •135912_136342•
*CAR:	for him isn't it? •136992_137572•
*SUS:	Well it's, I mean I feel sorry for him  but having said  •138172_141852•
*CAR:	Well I do and I don't sometimes. •141852_142932•
*SUS:	well having said that, although I feel sorry for him I get annoyed with him! •142932_146012•
*CAR:	Yes. •146282_146602•
        Like I said he's his own worst enemy! •147102_148512•
*SUS:	Because he wastes everybody's else's time. •148512_149562•
*CAR:	And everybody else is fed up with him! •149562_151752•
*SUS:	Well this is why I think he'd be better off,his needs  are not met by a class teacher. •151752_156582•
        And I don't think they have been for this last •157732_159402•
*CAR:	Mm, we need a support teacher to go there. •159642_161232•
*SUS:	for the last year. •161232_161552•
        But , you need somebody who's gonna work with him every day  and  with an individual programme and you just can't offer that  in a class. •161712_169332•
*CAR:	Mm, it's difficult. •171252_171782•
*SUS:	The only way you can do that is if he goes to  a special unit  at Maidstone  and works  •173182_177822•
*CAR:	Well I don't think there's provision for him now you see because it's a  •178662_180912•
*SUS:	Mm. •180912_181012•
*CAR:	there's a term and a half left before he moves on. •181602_183832•
*SUS:	Well this, this is what I'm saying, if it had been picked up  and followed through  at an earlier stage he would have been ensconced  •183832_190602•
*CAR:	Oh yeah , well there must have been  •190602_191542•
*SUS:	and  •191542_191622•
*CAR:	a problem identified earlier on but er  •191622_193612•
*SUS:	Oh! •193612_193862•
        Well I think so  I think it's been identified but I don't think it's been followed through. •194042_197792•
*CAR:	Well, it's like so many other things isn't it? •197792_199752•
*SUS:	Yeah, that's always the way though innit? •199752_201432•
        I just  cos when I see children like that  and you know there's nothing you can really do for them, you can't make up for the fact  that they've got a rotten home life and that's  top and bottom line that's what it is! •201432_216652•
*CAR:	Yeah. •216652_216822•
*SUS:	You're trying to be everything  and they're pushing it away cos it's not what they really want  and they, I mean, all, all you can get from him is how marvellous, you're right, how marvellous his brothers are  and yet, what I've heard of the brothers they're not •217252_234662•
*CAR:	Not much, yeah. •234662_235052•
*SUS:	they're not all that marvellous, they're not really that much to look up  •235052_237462•
*CAR:	Ah. •237462_237602•
*SUS:	to. •237602_237662•
*CAR:	No •237792_238192•
*SUS:	And they, they've •238962_239622•
*CAR:	role model is it, really? •239622_240912•
*SUS:	No. •240912_241132•
        I suppose marvellous to the wrong things! •241132_243062•
        Oh well! •243062_243212•
        And he he was  talking  •243212_248842•
*CAR:	Was anything else  said or acted upon or  shall I use the kids who are done today ooh,that  should be  done. •248842_257722•
*SUS:	No. •258922_259152•
        I don't think so. •259352_260672•
*CAR:	Done today? •260742_261222•
*SUS:	No. •261222_261282•
        No I said erm  I had a conversation with Gillian about reading, about little bits of reading  and, I made the point that we'd said last night about him barking at print, reading through words that he didn't know  and not asking what they were  and she said she'd noticed that. •263442_281922•
        And, cos we had a bit of a laugh about it, I don't know what I'm telling you about it for cos you hear him read anyway! •281922_287962•
        But she said yes, she'd noticed, but she said they are getting more out of this  Johnny Briggs book  than the other book. •288592_295052•
*CAR:	Mhm. •295052_295472•
*SUS:	So she's quite pleased  that she's put them on to it, it is difficult. •296392_300412•
*CAR:	brilliant! •300442_300842•
*SUS:	Sorry? •302102_302352•
*CAR:	Nothing. •302842_303082•
*SUS:	Mm. •304022_304232•
        And I saw Mrs  •305402_306022•
*CAR:	Oh yes? •306202_306562•
*SUS:	in the bank, I went up to the bank  •306562_308972•
*CAR:	And what did she have to say for herself? •308972_310602•
*SUS:	She's alright. •310602_312022•
        I just don't feel that  you know, she's basically taken Robert back last night, that was very kind of her and all that, she said oh it's been nice to have him and  erm  but er  Oliver and Robert had got on really well  and erm   that's all really . •312022_330642•
*CAR:	Are you still working? •333042_334302•
*SUS:	Yeah ! •334462_334792•
*CAR:	It's alright  •335362_336132•
*SUS:	Er  •336132_336232•
*CAR:	it's just some noise I heard on the tape. •336232_337622•
*SUS:	oh and we were well we just sort of , I was just talking about the weather, she was saying how cold it was. •337872_343392•
        And erm  and I made the point that I  tipped all your lot out of I said what and   I hadn't let them go in the classroom and I said it's a new thing but  I said they got their coats on  they're too macho to wear them that's their problem, you know! •345702_358132•
        They've got their coats in school. •358132_359542•
        But they were very good about going out, I'm not going up to her again! •360962_364022•
        She's just gonna have to cry herself to sleep I'm afraid. •365122_366912•
        I've just  •366912_367502•
*CAR:	Mm. •368982_369042•
*SUS:	had enough of her now! •369222_370082•
        She's tired, she's had a busy day, so •373412_374562•
*CAR:	When was she last asleep? •375762_376682•
*SUS:	Erm  just before I came in from school  and we were home by about half three. •378052_383662•
        But she's ready to go off really, she probably would have done if Robert hadn't tipped the milk everywhere! •385362_389232•
*CAR:	Was she asleep by then? •389312_390912•
*SUS:	And then ranted and raved cos she probably just about going off then, you see it woke her up all the fuss and kerfuffle! •390912_397952•
*CAR:	Mm. •397952_398042•
*SUS:	I was so mad with him for doing it! •398042_402382•
        So silly! •402382_402582•
*CAR:	The trials and tribulations of a family life! •402582_404612•
*SUS:	Mm. •404612_404672•
        Trials and tribulations! •404672_407162•
        I tell you I said today when I was in school  cos that's like being at home with my three year old, it was just like that today being stuck in there! •408352_419242•

*CAR:	And they couldn't. •587582_588012•
*SUS:	they'd come out with half of one, they'd come out with things like  I think you're  er  I dunno  er, not barking up the wrong tree that was the wrong one, but  they'd sort of come out with half of a pun and they wouldn't finish it off, like oh , this is smashing! •588012_604422•
        , and I'd say  yeah but that's not a pun  that's only a pun if you  if you write down this is smashing  said  erm  the robber or the smash and grab, in other words the window fell in, that kind of thing, you know. •606532_620912•

*CAR:	Yeah. •650222_650282•

*CAR:	Yeah, perhaps you ought to. •137975_138062•
*SUS:	them quiet. •138212_138233•
        But the trouble was  with closing them in, not so much on the , but on the old flock  it was so warped, the wood with being damp and wet and frosty  it was freezing across every night and it was nearly taking my fingers off •138236_139786•
*CAR:	Mm. •139786_139798•
*SUS:	getting it open in the morning, that really hurt! •139798_139982•
*CAR:	Well put a little loop or something there. •139982_140123•
*SUS:	It's too, too rotten, the wood. •140125_140344•
        But I've got, what I've gotta do is repair that other coop •140345_140572•
*CAR:	Mm. •140592_140610•
*SUS:	and get that there and then it'll be a lot easier  cos mum said she struggled today to get in that door  of the , I said well what do you go in there for? •140610_141442•
        And she was going in for eggs or something, said well I usually leave them a day or two in the winter cos it doesn't hurt  and she said she struggled and struggled with that door! •141442_142311•
        She said it hasn't got any   at the minute! •142311_142656•
        I said, well no cos it was on, like strings  but er that does need fixing. •142679_143390•
        But it's just been too wet and too nasty to do anything about it so  when we've got a chance we'll have to really do. •143391_144030•
        She said she's  looking forward to the day that we get it fixed ! •144034_144398•
        Said, oh I'm sorry mum, I'll go and get you some eggs! •144398_144798•
        Cos they are quite tame, I mean that's one thing about the hens  I mean  they can't come out though, they just wander about. •144798_145465•
        And it  but the erm  the goats apparently were no problem today, they just stayed on and  gave them a few bits and pieces you know  so   that was fair enough . •145471_146790•
        Oh, I wish she'd hurry up and go to sleep! •146812_147284•
*CAR:	I think I'll have to put her down again then. •147284_147414•
*SUS:	Put her down! •147414_147977•
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SUS:	I can't understand it! •147978_148077•
        I mean she's  she's been up  and been busy and  she's had a warm bath and she's had a bottle of •148077_148763•
*CAR:	She'll start this caper again though! •148763_149123•
*SUS:	Yeah, coming in at night. •149123_149273•
        I , well she was awake in the middle of the night, I don't know what time it was but all I could hear was mummy, mummy, mummy! •149293_149813•
*CAR:	Why didn't you just put her back  into bed! •149825_150054•
*SUS:	And I lay her down and she bawls! •150054_150211•
*CAR:	Well it doesn't matter! •150211_150321•
        I didn't hear her! •150322_150427•
*SUS:	Well, I heard her! •150427_150564•
        And I feel really guilty, I think oh I better bring her in  and then she wakes me up at six o'clock bouncing on the bed! •150573_151399•
        So  And , also  when it's the day before I, I'm working  I'm very conscience that I don't want her to be upset in the morning, same with Christopher  I don't want any upsets in the morning. •151399_152559•
        I don't want her frazzled  and I don't want him upset in the morning cos I wanna  go out and have a nice  even keel then •152577_153312•
*CAR:	Mm. •153312_153339•
*SUS:	and not have to worry that  they're er  gonna be a problem for mum  •153339_153649•
*CAR:	Yeah. •153667_153676•
*SUS:	to look after you see, so  I think if that's the price we gotta pay if it's  a choice between  •153676_154358•
*CAR:	Oh yes! •154378_154415•
*SUS:	putting up with that  and me not going out  then I'm afraid we'll just have to put up with it! •154415_155021•
        Cos it's  it's too  erm  expensive to do otherwise. •155022_155662•
        That's what I reckon anyway. •155662_156063•
        Aren't you gonna turn that off yet? •156063_156283•
*CAR:	No, we'll let the first side run. •156284_156371•
*SUS:	Are we? •156371_156384•
        We'll  •156384_156535•
*CAR:	Mm. •156535_156541•

*CAR:	I think I've only said about three words in  you're doing all the chatting. •157016_157590•
*SUS:	Well you can't get a word in edgeways  can't you? •157620_157944•
*CAR:	No. •157945_157946•
        I'm used to it! •157946_158166•
*SUS:	No you're not! •158167_158354•
        Oh well of course that's making me have a parched throat you know, so you're gonna have to , go and make me a cup of tea! •158354_158940•
        Please? •159086_159106•

        Mm. •162329_162341•
*CAR:	Yeah. •162669_162677•
*SUS:	This is what could be termed in  as a   a pregnant pause ! •162680_163486•
*CAR:	Oh! •163486_163539•
        Level four, attainment target two it'll be . •163539_163995•

*SUS:	Well I had a quick look at them. •164525_164703•
        Oh no, you're doing it again, you're talking about school! •164725_164913•
        We can't talk about school, it's boring   •164927_165170•
*CAR:	No, I'm gasping for a cup of tea! •165170_165393•
*SUS:	What are we gonna do now? •165403_165479•
        Well if I go through now she's just  quietened again  just wait until , there's no noise at all from up there, give it another ten minutes. •165479_166202•
*CAR:	Okay. •166219_166228•
*SUS:	Then  and then I think hopefully she'll settle. •166371_166651•
        Has she got a dolly in her cot with her? •166651_166920•
        She does like that so  we'll have to go and get Christopher's present won't we? •167173_168068•

*SUS:	Yeah. •169342_169354•
        We'll have to encourage him to put in on the table. •169355_169564•

*CAR:	Did you tell him we were gonna do the table? •170957_171147•
*SUS:	Yep. •171175_171189•
        He said leave it don't do it yet. •171189_171353•
        I said, well we hadn't intended doing it yet cos the children being so young  that er  that's what he needs. •171353_171905•
