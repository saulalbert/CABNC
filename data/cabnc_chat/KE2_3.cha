*TER:	This is the long one, this is the five thousand
*MAR:	It says here on the six o'clock Olympics today   [reading] including live coverage of Wilf Riley's attempt to win the gold for Britain in the mens thousand short practice speed skating final   [] it's six o'clock 
*TER:	Yeah that's the final he's got three, they've got two, I think they've got two of each before that actually   (.) and that's the wide lane that's two lanes so that's the erm, when they do the long one 
*MAR:	Looks as if somebody was sort of passed over to the other
*TER:	Yeah they do they cross over from outside 
*MAR:	Any lane 
*TER:	to inside
*MAR:	I thought it were relay
*TER:	Oh was it?
*MAR:	That's what I thought because he's on the, he's by himself isn't he?
*TER:	Well if they've separated you see you get one on the inside track, one on the outside track and they can be separated by a hundred metres so that there's one, one side one 
*MAR:	No you can see 
*TER:	there's usually two racing together in this one, but they're in separate tracks and one starts at the outside track 
*MAR:	This is the end track 
*TER:	crosses to the inside track and vice versa there the other straight where they change over I think   (.) oh it's finished anyway   (.) mm
