Noel (PS090)                         [1] If you go round the other side please

Ann (PS092)                          [2] Yes ... I did call you Dominic didn't

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5] mustn't leave it there too long.
                                     [6] Do you?

Ann (PS092)                          [9] Ooh no!
                                     [10] Er indeed we've ... we hardly use
                                     that room since we had the territory room

Mollie (PS091)                       [15] [...] I should take it out now.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [16] I feel very ill!
Ann (PS092)                          [17] I will.
Noel (PS090)                         [18] What's that darling?

Mollie (PS091)                       [22] It's so useful and we've seen it and
                                     enjoy it.
Ann (PS092)                          [23] I think I'll use it [...] .
                                     [24] [...] is so very warm for it

Ann (PS092)                          [26] there ... but
Mollie (PS091)                       [27] It's simply glorious!
Ann (PS092)                          [28] Hasn't it done wonderfully!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [29] You ought to [...] in that glorious
                                     bowl!

Enid (PS08Y)                         [33] If you put them in a hot room they
                                     don't do so well.
Mollie (PS091)                       [34] Put it in there.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [35] I wonder what it would it look like
                                     in there?
Mollie (PS091)                       [36] Ooh yes, it would, it would perhaps
                                     ... I mean
Noel (PS090)                         [37] Exaggerate.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [38] Mm.
Mollie (PS091)                       [laugh]
Ann (PS092)                          [39] Oh yes, I wouldn't dare [...] !
Noel (PS090)                         [40] It's been broken twice in my
                                     lifetime.
Ann (PS092)                          [41] Yes I know.
Mollie (PS091)                       [42] Mm.

Noel (PS090)                         [44] This wine is a shot in the dark.
                                     [45] It was very much recommended by the
                                     Wine Society ... an Italian wine ... and I
                                     hope that
Ann (PS092)                          [46] I hope it's not full of this thing
                                     they're sending it all back for!
Noel (PS090)                         [47] Ooh I hope not no!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [48] [laughing] We won't try it [] !
Mollie (PS091)                       [49] Well that's lovely!

                                     cheap white.
Ann (PS092)                          [51] There are limits to what I'd dare and
Noel (PS090)                         [52] This isn't a cheap wine!
Mollie (PS091)                       [53] No, well
Group of unknown speakers (KC0PSUGP) [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [54] I can just imagine he's probably

                                     thing isn't it?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [66] Yeah.
Mollie (PS091)                       [67] Well that's the thing I have ... I

Ann (PS092)                          [77] Oh!

                                     [80] And ... the only bit of damp I've got
                                     is in one corner of the house but it came

Ann (PS092)                          [100] Well yes.

Noel (PS090)                         [103] I had to clear it all off though the

Mollie (PS091)                       [106] I think that maybe you should have
                                     done much more ... actually, but I I
                                     haven't ... argued because he's so [...] .
                                     [107] It's no good him taking the bridge

                                     ... much too wet!
Noel (PS090)                         [108] That's right.
                                     [109] Oh yes!
                                     [110] Can you manage love?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [111] Yes, thank you dear.
Mollie (PS091)                       [112] So that I'm suffering.
Noel (PS090)                         [113] The major thing I find so
Mollie (PS091)                       [114] But I , my personal suffering was
                                     erm ... in the summer, frightfully!
                                     [115] And you see, you know the ball over

Noel (PS090)                         [116] Yes.
Mollie (PS091)                       [117] well ... said it doesn't look as if
                                     it's been ... painted once since it was
                                     built!
Noel (PS090)                         [118] Oh!
Mollie (PS091)                       [119] And that's all
Enid (PS08Y)                         [120] Yep.
Mollie (PS091)                       [121] wrong!

Mollie (PS091)                       [128] Oh Anne, come on!
Ann (PS092)                          [129] No, I'm not a potato person!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [130] You slimming?

Mollie (PS091)                       [132] Well I like potatoes.

Mollie (PS091)                       [146] No, no, no, I've got crowds there!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [147] Really?
Mollie (PS091)                       [148] I've I've probably got much too

Enid (PS08Y)                         [149] Oh I think I'll leave it there the

Ann (PS092)                          [164] There's a very slight prickle with
                                     it isn't there Noel?
                                     [165] It's not supposed to be a fizzy is
                                     it?
                                     [166] They often do that don't they, you
                                     get a little funny prickle.
Noel (PS090)                         [167] What, with the wine?
Ann (PS092)                          [168] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [169] Mm.

Ann (PS092)                          [171] That's right!
Noel (PS090)                         [172] because ... it was well written up
                                     in the Wine Society ... I would descr ...
                                     describe it as nice, nice but innocuous.
Ann (PS092)                          [173] Yes it's alright, it's nice but
Enid (PS08Y)                         [174] [...] what darling?
Noel (PS090)                         [175] Nice but innocuous, I mean that's
Enid (PS08Y)                         [176] Oh I see.
Ann (PS092)                          [177] Mm, you can.
Mollie (PS091)                       [178] Surely that's not as nice as well
                                     innocuous!
                                     [179] And not nasty and innocuous.
Ann (PS092)                          [180] It has got a very slight fizziness
                                     though hasn't it?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [181] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [182] Yes.
Ann (PS092)                          [183] Very , very slight
Noel (PS090)                         [184] Yes.

Noel (PS090)                         [187] It has.
Ann (PS092)                          [188] goes out of it when it's [...] .
Noel (PS090)                         [189] Well that's
Enid (PS08Y)                         [190] Well I mean

Noel (PS090)                         [193] Italian wines they're
Mollie (PS091)                       [194] Now it's reminiscent ... a that that
                                     can't be my deja vu who, cos I don't think
                                     you can in tastes ... but it's reminiscent
                                     of something to me.
Noel (PS090)                         [195] Oh is it really?
Mollie (PS091)                       [196] But I don't know what.
Noel (PS090)                         [197] Ha.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [198] What?
Mollie (PS091)                       [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [199] Well maybe white wines are ... er
                                     ... spritzy aren't they?
Ann (PS092)                          [200] Oh yes, and this isn't
Enid (PS08Y)                         [201] I think.
Ann (PS092)                          [202] not meant to be [...] .
                                     [203] It often gets a little ... a little
                                     secondary fermentation in the bottles.
Noel (PS090)                         [204] Yes,i i it looks
Enid (PS08Y)                         [205] That's right.
Noel (PS090)                         [...]
Ann (PS092)                          [206] Mm.
Mollie (PS091)                       [207] Oh does it?
Ann (PS092)                          [208] Yeah.
Mollie (PS091)                       [209] Oh well.
Ann (PS092)                          [210] And it sort of fades.
Mollie (PS091)                       [211] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [212] You can if it's
Noel (PS090)                         [213] But that
Ann (PS092)                          [214] red one but it's very strange sort
                                     of
Noel (PS090)                         [215] I know that with the
Mollie (PS091)                       [216] Oh is that red?
Noel (PS090)                         [217] they'd already been
Ann (PS092)                          [218] I agree.
Noel (PS090)                         [219] Ya.
Ann (PS092)                          [220] That is very strange!
Noel (PS090)                         [221] It sort of erm ... [...] in Italian
                                     wine once or twice ... but ... when I
                                     ordered this I took the care to order ...
                                     up
Ann (PS092)                          [222] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [223] in the price range somewhat.
Ann (PS092)                          [224] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [225] Yes it's true.
Ann (PS092)                          [226] Actually ... you're not fond ...
                                     enough of white wine are you to
Noel (PS090)                         [227] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [228] No, I'm not either I think
Mollie (PS091)                       [229] No, no I'm not all that.
Ann (PS092)                          [230] [...] red of the two.
Mollie (PS091)                       [231] I mean I I
Noel (PS090)                         [232] You mean to say you ladies would
                                     have accepted red?
Mollie (PS091)                       [233] No. [laugh]
Ann (PS092)                          [234] Oh nice!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [235] Go and get a bottle of red.
Noel (PS090)                         [236] I'll go and get a bottle of red,
                                     quick.
Mollie (PS091)                       [237] Oh that's, no
Enid (PS08Y)                         [238] No.

                                     would kill the grass, but it won't matter

Enid (PS08Y)                         [398] Mm.

Ann (PS092)                          [670] Trouble is, if you remove moles ...
                                     you just leave an evolutionary niche for
                                     them and they're ... another lot move into
                                     the field, you can never get rid of them
                                     because if you ... remove your own private

Ann (PS092)                          [678] Well no, but they won't over-
                                     densify, they wo won't make the population
                                     too dense, you see.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [679] I see.

Noel (PS090)                         [797] Did it have a lasting effect on you
                                     Mollie?
Mollie (PS091)                       [798] Well, you can be the judge of that!
Ann (PS092)                          [799] No, [...] got it I think, yes!
Mollie (PS091)                       [800] But then [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [801] You don't like motorbikes and side
                                     cars do you Mollie?
Noel (PS090)                         [802] It's amazing really!
Mollie (PS091)                       [803] No.
                                     [804] Well I used to ride a motorbike a
                                     and ... my father had a Triumph motorbike
                                     because he bought ... I don't why he, why
                                     he bought it ... and he was terrified of
                                     it cos it was very fierce!
                                     [805] And ... my brothers used to ride it,
                                     so I used to ride it ... and I rode it for
                                     miles!
Noel (PS090)                         [806] Did you?
Mollie (PS091)                       [807] Then I rode it in a ... in an old
                                     Burberry ... and I don't how I started it,
                                     I think it was kick start.
Ann (PS092)                          [808] Mm, yes.
Mollie (PS091)                       [809] Oh it must have been.
                                     [810] And then we were at Frinton, masses
                                     of us, and we always used to go to Frinton
                                     in the summer ... because one of my uncles
                                     had a house there ... and we knew the
                                     people who erm ... dad used to play golf
                                     and mother used to knit ... on the beach,

                                     [814] And I said, yes ... you see, gave
                                     her a try ... and so she went ... if you
                                     know Frinton you could go, in those days
Noel (PS090)                         [815] Yes I know it.
Mollie (PS091)                       [816] you could go round, well it's the
                                     same now, but in those days you could go
                                     round, past the summer theatre and down
                                     Old Road where we were staying and on to a
                                     ... and do a circle you see?
Noel (PS090)                         [817] Mm.
Mollie (PS091)                       [818] And we started her off and she went
                                     round ... and as she went past the second
                                     time she said I can't stop!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [819] Oh! oh! oh!
Ann (PS092)                          [820] Oh no!
Mollie (PS091)                       [821] And then she went round again and we
                                     said ... well push so and so

Mollie (PS091)                       [824] And nobody had told her how to stop
                                     you know.
Ann (PS092)                          [825] I can remember not being able to get

Mollie (PS091)                       [826] Oh yes!
Ann (PS092)                          [827] and I ... pedalled frantically
                                     round, didn't know how to get off again
                                     cos it was much too high.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Ann (PS092)                          [828] And I remember just sort of leaping

                                     [847] ... I had an experience with a bike
                                     when I was very small ... a girl up the
                                     road ... was given a bike ... and I had
                                     quite quietly learnt how to ride a bike
                                     more or less.
Mollie (PS091)                       [848] Mhm.
Noel (PS090)                         [849] And I, I said can I have a ride?
                                     [850] And she said yes.
                                     [851] And I went up and down the road and
                                     ... miles away then came back ... and I
                                     couldn't stop because this bike was very
                                     old fashioned and you had to stop it by
                                     pedalling back
Mollie (PS091)                       [852] I know.

                                     jerky!
Noel (PS090)                         [878] That's what I thought earlier.
Mollie (PS091)                       [879] That's very sudden you

                                     they bring him back
Ann (PS092)                          [912] Yes.

Mollie (PS091)                       [923] Oh have they, good!
Noel (PS090)                         [924] Yes.
Mollie (PS091)                       [925] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [926] And that's the second one
Mollie (PS091)                       [927] Oh that's lovely!
Noel (PS090)                         [928] since the war.
Mollie (PS091)                       [929] Mm?

Mollie (PS091)                       [931] Is it?
                                     [932] Is it really?
Noel (PS090)                         [933] they had new one ... after the war.
Ann (PS092)                          [934] Why do they want another one?
Noel (PS090)                         [935] It's ... just isn't satisfactory.
Mollie (PS091)                       [936] How extraordinary.
Noel (PS090)                         [937] No.
                                     [938] John's gotta ... build a new one.
Ann (PS092)                          [939] Oh!
                                     [940] He's not complaining?
Noel (PS090)                         [941] No.
Ann (PS092)                          [942] No.
Noel (PS090)                         [943] And at your old ... stamping ground.

                                     Cathedral.
                                     [947] Mhm.

                                     [952] It's ghastly!
Noel (PS090)                         [953] I gather it is.
Mollie (PS091)                       [954] And so is the bloody Bishop there!
Noel (PS090)                         [955] Yeah but he's
Mollie (PS091)                       [956] Absolutely awful!
Noel (PS090)                         [957] very nice.
Mollie (PS091)                       [958] And ... erm ... if you wanted to

Noel (PS090)                         [962] Who is that?
Mollie (PS091)                       [963] sister.
Noel (PS090)                         [964] Oh sister!
                                     [965] Oh yes
Mollie (PS091)                       [966] And

                                     bulldoze up the erm ... aisles ... and
                                     bulldoze the sanctuary ... and he's thrown

Noel (PS090)                         [986] Oh yes.
Mollie (PS091)                       [987] the most beautiful building and ...
                                     nobody can pull it down, but [...]
Ann (PS092)                          [988] Not the chapel Mollie?
Mollie (PS091)                       [989] No, [...]
Ann (PS092)                          [990] Not [...] .
Noel (PS090)                         [991] Meeting House.
Mollie (PS091)                       [992] Meeting House
Ann (PS092)                          [993] Meeting House
Mollie (PS091)                       [994] yes.
                                     [995] And opposite her ... is where the
                                     erm ... Quakers meet now because they
                                     can't afford to run the chapel ... the erm
                                     ... Meeting
Noel (PS090)                         [996] Meeting House.
Mollie (PS091)                       [997] Meeting House ... as ... a big one
                                     and they are ... getting fewer.
                                     [998] But she says ... I sometimes just
                                     walk across the road and go to the Meeting
                                     House at ... you know
Noel (PS090)                         [999] Well I've got a theory
Mollie (PS091)                       [1000] rather than the cathedral.
Ann (PS092)                          [1001] Yeah.
Noel (PS090)                         [1002] I've got a theory ... I have a
                                     feeling there's going to be a great ...
                                     revival ... of people with a Quakered mind
                                     ... way of thinking.
Ann (PS092)                          [1003] Yes
Mollie (PS091)                       [1004] I I
Ann (PS092)                          [1005] Yes.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1006] do agree.
Ann (PS092)                          [1007] But the trouble is Noel, in the
                                     meantime ... erm ... the Quakers have
                                     fallen apart ... because the Quakers have
                                     filled themselves up with ... sort of
                                     barefooted raw carrot eaters with beads
Mollie (PS091)                       [1008] Well I know they have, yes I agree.
Ann (PS092)                          [1009] with the and haven't, but haven't
                                     ever read
Mollie (PS091)                       [1010] That's right.
Ann (PS092)                          [1011] the bible [...]
Mollie (PS091)                       [...]
Ann (PS092)                          [1012] sort of Eastern religion type,
                                     meditation and thing and it's no good at
                                     all!
                                     [1013] The old fashioned Quakers who were
                                     sikhs and everything.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1014] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1015] Now, what I have learnt at college
                                     this week which is ... rather interesting
                                     I think.
                                     [1016] Well I think you'll be interested.
                                     [1017] Erm ... in the bible ... in the new
                                     part, the new testament, there's a ... er
                                     an epistle of James.
Noel (PS090)                         [1018] Yes.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1019] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1020] Well [...] I am told that that is
                                     the earliest thing at all.
Noel (PS090)                         [1021] I'd say that.
Ann (PS092)                          [1022] That is his erm ... actually a
                                     brother of Jesus in his family
Mollie (PS091)                       [1023] Yes.
Ann (PS092)                          [1024] and so it's very much as he was
                                     thinking ... and it should be in the old
                                     testament really cos it was written ...
                                     you know, before Jesus
Noel (PS090)                         [1025] Mm.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1026] That's right.
Noel (PS090)                         [1027] before the, before the crucifixion.
                                     [1028] Erm, and it's been quickly
                                     Christianized with just two little
                                     lectures at the beginning of two chapters
                                     to Christianize so it was popped in for
                                     new testament ... and it's the nearest we
                                     can get to ... to teaching.
                                     [1029] And of course, it's totally Jewish
Mollie (PS091)                       [1030] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1031] but I'd say it's th it's th Je ,
                                     the Jewish teaching as Christ would have

Noel (PS090)                         [1095] by doctrine.

                                     orthodox really.

Ann (PS092)                          [1117] No.
Noel (PS090)                         [1118] can you?
Mollie (PS091)                       [1119] No.
Ann (PS092)                          [1120] But I know they blamed him for
                                     that.
                                     [1121] And he says you can because he says
                                     it's important for it to be a living thing
                                     that's got to change with the time.
Noel (PS090)                         [1122] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1123] In all that way he's quite correct
Mollie (PS091)                       [1124] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1125] I think.
                                     [1126] It's just that he hasn't, to me,
                                     changed enough, he's still stuck up with
                                     all these ... various things.
                                     [1127] That really
Noel (PS090)                         [1128] Well I know ... let's face it, if
                                     he, if he was ... really convinced of the
                                     ... falsity of most it he
Ann (PS092)                          [1129] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [1130] couldn't be a conscience to obtain
                                     his seat could he?
Ann (PS092)                          [1131] Well he reckons you can say it in a
                                     different way.
                                     [1132] You can say
Noel (PS090)                         [1133] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1134] it entirely symbolically and
                                     spiritually and and

Ann (PS092)                          [1138] have to have happened in fact.
                                     [1139] And that the stories were told to
                                     make a point and
Mollie (PS091)                       [1140] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1141] the trouble is, people have lost
                                     the point and kept the story!
                                     [1142] Erm, you know, it's saying that
Noel (PS090)                         [1143] Well, the earliest man who ... used
                                     to think like this was Albert .

Noel (PS090)                         [1160] That is his best book
Ann (PS092)                          [1161] chapter which is so lovely when
Noel (PS090)                         [1162] Yeah.
Ann (PS092)                          [1163] he sort of says well you still can
                                     ... spiritually meet Jesus even though you
                                     know, it's a rather lovely

Ann (PS092)                          [1164] the last chapter!
                                     [1165] I say, he moves him the more you
                                     ... search for him historically
Noel (PS090)                         [1166] Yeah.
Ann (PS092)                          [1167] but there is a ... there's
                                     something hanging about still.
                                     [1168] But in a funny way, perhaps there
                                     is.
                                     [1169] I don't know.
                                     [1170] I'm very ... very, very, very, tied
                                     up with it, I I I invariably turn ...
                                     relatively happy with it all.
Noel (PS090)                         [1171] I don't think one has to worry too
                                     much.
Ann (PS092)                          [1172] Been brought up so much, bought up

Ann (PS092)                          [1174] you just find it difficult to ...
                                     to admit that one's rather ... you know
                                     ... But certainly that epistle of James,
                                     to me, was just marvellous!
                                     [1175] Just everything!
Noel (PS090)                         [1176] I, I can't
Ann (PS092)                          [1177] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [1178] ever remember reading James, If I
                                     had, I've forgotten about it.
Ann (PS092)                          [1179] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [1180] But I shall read him tonight.
Ann (PS092)                          [1181] Well certainly, you'll enjoy it.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1182] Oh [...]
Noel (PS090)                         [1183] Did you go to

Ann (PS092)                          [1185] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [1186] Er ... I chose the reading.
Ann (PS092)                          [1187] Oh did you?
                                     [1188] Oh
Noel (PS090)                         [1189] Yes.
Ann (PS092)                          [1190] how lovely!
Noel (PS090)                         [1191] Yeah.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1192] Mm.
                                     [1193] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1194] Yep.

Noel (PS090)                         [1196] Erm
Ann (PS092)                          [1197] was very nicely done!
                                     [1198] Louis was very upset cos she forgot
                                     to erm ... have anyone to take the names
                                     ... erm
Noel (PS090)                         [1199] Well
Ann (PS092)                          [1200] so I wrote down
Mollie (PS091)                       [...]
Ann (PS092)                          [1201] as many as I could ... think of
Mollie (PS091)                       [1202] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1203] and erm ... and I asked Margaret ,
                                     they had a better view where she was
Mollie (PS091)                       [1204] Mm.
Ann (PS092)                          [1205] and she told a lot of other people
                                     and so I think we got a pretty
                                     comprehensive list actually.
Noel (PS090)                         [1206] Oh, we couldn't er ... we
Ann (PS092)                          [1207] No.
Noel (PS090)                         [1208] we couldn't go anyhow.
Ann (PS092)                          [1209] No.
                                     [1210] It was very packed in there [...]
                                     but I couldn't see a lot of anything.
Noel (PS090)                         [1211] But I was glad we couldn't because
                                     they asked me to read the lesson.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1212] No it ... it's miserable!
Ann (PS092)                          [1213] Oh yeah.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1214] It spoils everything doesn't it?
Noel (PS090)                         [1215] I'm glad to say
Ann (PS092)                          [1216] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [1217] [...] and stuck to it.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1218] I think there were some people
                                     there who didn't really know, but they
                                     maybe went because they'd got to a
                                     funeral.
Ann (PS092)                          [1219] Well it wasn't erm
Mollie (PS091)                       [1220] Oh [...]
Ann (PS092)                          [1221] it wasn't quite full enough.
Mollie (PS091)                       [1222] I think that's awful don't you?
Ann (PS092)                          [1223] I I do, I do Mollie!

Ann (PS092)                          [1229] original idea.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [1230] that's the, that's the wrong thing
                                     to do!

Stanley (PS095) [1950] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [1951] But you see you take it for granted.

                the doctor
Stanley (PS095) [1953] Yes.

Stanley (PS095) [1963] It's old trouble.
                [1964] I think
Enid (PS08Y)    [1965] I know.
Stanley (PS095) [1966] he's more interested in women than anything else!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1967] Oh!
                [1968] It's sad isn't it?
                [1969] It really is, it's sad!
Stanley (PS095) [1970] I don't know, he come, he said to me ... er we we well
                he come over, you see when I come home from hospital he sa , he
                had to report [...] to come and see me ... he was a long while
                before he did come!
                [1971] But er, he he hopped on one day and er ... had a talk
                with him and so on and ... took my temperature and pulse and
                that, this, that and other, he said well ... I'll call again he
                said, when I'm by, but he never did!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1972] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [1973] He never called!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1974] Mm.
                [1975] I don't think he
Stanley (PS095) [1976] I had to ring!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1977] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [1978] And I said to him, I said well I hope I don't mind er me
                ringing the doctor, well he said no that's what we're here for.
                [1979] But he said, I've got three hours of paperwork!
                [1980] Well that's nothing to do with it!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1981] Absolutely!
                [1982] Absolutely!
Stanley (PS095) [1983] Nothing to do with it!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1984] I mean, it doesn't stop him from going shooting and
                fishing does it?
Stanley (PS095) [1985] Oh no!
Enid (PS08Y)    [laugh]
Stanley (PS095) [1986] No, no, that's the thing.
                [1987] I think he's a little bit envious because ... er, I took
                those meadows back, you see.
Enid (PS08Y)    [1988] Possibly , yes.
Stanley (PS095) [1989] Cos he used to go shooting there and [...] and they went
                in there and they shouldn't of done because Michael told them
                I'd taken meadows back ... and he sa , he said when Tony told
                them, they, they'd been there shooting he said well they're,
                they're out of bounds!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1990] Mm.

Stanley (PS095) [1992] He said I told them ... that.
Enid (PS08Y)    [1993] Mm.
                [1994] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [1995] But they took advantage, the boys did and they don't
                care at all!
Enid (PS08Y)    [1996] Ye , yes that's right, mm.
Stanley (PS095) [1997] They take liberties [...] .
Enid (PS08Y)    [1998] Yes, they do , they do, it's a shame!
Stanley (PS095) [1999] I think ... that [...] a little bit apprehensive on
                things like that, and course when he saw Tony ... asked whether
                ga , whether he could go and Tony said no, I'm sorry Doc but
                that he said I've got my ponies and things there and I don't
                want people shooting there!

Enid (PS08Y)    [2078] People complain that these tests seem to take longer
                than they need to.
Stanley (PS095) [2079] Well I think so, yeah!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2080] Whether the hold up is at the hospital ... or in the erm

                are very lucky!
Stanley (PS095) [2128] Ha?
                [2129] Yes.

Stanley (PS095) [2145] Shingles, I had a touch
Enid (PS08Y)    [2146] Oh!
Stanley (PS095) [2147] of shingles.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2148] Gosh!
                [2149] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2150] And I said to him, he said what's the matter?
                [2151] And I told him, I said I've got shingles ... so I said
                well I got them ... he said and ... red round the stomach.
                [2152] Ha, ha, ha, he said!
                [2153] I thought to myself, not so much of the ha, ha, ha!
                [2154] That's what he's li , er, wasn't a way to tell nobody
                was it?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2155] No, it wasn't.
                [2156] You see, that's another one.
Stanley (PS095) [2157] He didn't feel it did he?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2158] No, he didn't feel, absolutely
Stanley (PS095) [2159] No!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2160] Stanley!
                [2161] No, that's not
Stanley (PS095) [2162] I thought to myself, who's this then?
                [2163] That's something I don't sa , not so matter that I could
                have told him!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2164] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2165] That isn't a way to get through to people!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2166] No it isn't!
                [2167] No it's not.
Stanley (PS095) [2168] Cos after all, we don't go private but we're paying!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2169] Tha abs
Stanley (PS095) [2170] And I've payed for years and years for myself and four
                other people besides!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2171] Mm.
                [2172] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2173] No, some
Enid (PS08Y)    [2174] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2175] of them get too ... snooty in a way.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2176] Yes , they get, they're a bit less committed.
                [2177] I think the
Stanley (PS095) [2178] And, as you say with , well if he can go fishing and
                shooting, I don't know about that, they take priority!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2179] Yes.
                [2180] Yes, that's true.
                [2181] Mhm.
                [2182] There's another very nice one there, he's the latest to
                have come ... erm ...
Stanley (PS095) [2183] .
                [2184] What in
Enid (PS08Y)    [2185] oh and he's just
Stanley (PS095) [2186] at Framlingham?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2187] Yes.
                [2188] And he's very young, he's i , I met him ... twice, when
                I was with people who ... were dying
Stanley (PS095) [2189] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2190] and erm ... in fact, yes, but both of just had died and
                we sent for ... the doctor and it's
Stanley (PS095) [2191] Aha.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2192] it was he who came ... and erm ... he was absolutely
                marvellous!
                [2193] I thought his manner was ... just right.
Stanley (PS095) [2194] Makes all the difference doesn't it?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2195] Oh yes!
                [2196] It does make a lot of
Stanley (PS095) [2197] I mean
Enid (PS08Y)    [2198] difference, yes
Stanley (PS095) [2199] a person like that ... can help another person to get
                well can't they?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2200] They can!
                [2201] They can.
                [2202] I mean,th there is something to be said for the manner
                towards you isn't there?
Stanley (PS095) [2203] Ooh yes!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2204] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2205] Yes!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2206] That's true.
Stanley (PS095) [2207] I mean, when you look forward to seeing the doctor and
                one thing and another, and saying, have a conversation with
                them, that's a different story innit?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2208] That's true.
Stanley (PS095) [2209] And buck you up a bit.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2210] Oh absolutely!
Stanley (PS095) [2211] That's something you
Enid (PS08Y)    [2212] Absolutely!
                [2213] Yes!
Stanley (PS095) [2214] if you think to yourself well if I can have a ... a
                quarter of an hour's chat with him, that'd be worth something.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2215] That's right.
                [2216] That's true.
Stanley (PS095) [2217] Yes.
                [2218] I don't know why some of them get like that, well of
                course they shouldn't be doctors any how.
                [2219] And tha tha th th a doctor should have a nice
                personality!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2220] He should.
                [2221] I think in some cases, Stanley, not only in the me ,
                medical profession ... the more people are paid ... the less
                committed they seem to be to the job!
Stanley (PS095) [2222] Yes, they do, they get independent!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2223] Yes.
                [2224] They begin to feel that the job is there so that they
                can earn a living, rather than that they are doing the job
                itself!
Stanley (PS095) [2225] That's right , yes.
                [2226] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2227] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2228] Th th er theirselves, they take priority not the
                patient!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2229] That's what I feel.
                [2230] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2231] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2232] I'm sorry about it because ... you know, how I feel
                about the ... medical profession and the nursing
Stanley (PS095) [2233] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2234] profession.
Stanley (PS095) [2235] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2236] Ye , I mean I'm passionately keen!
                [2237] But erm ... I I think some of them let us down a bit.
                [2238] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2239] Yes.
                [2240] Well there you are, I don't know whether it's wrong.
                [2241] Course, they drop onto you any old time if they come but
                if they can't
Enid (PS08Y)    [2242] Oh yes, if they want to come it doesn't matter if it's
                convenient to you or not [laughing] does it [] !
Stanley (PS095) [2243] Not a bit of it!
                [2244] Not a bit of it!
                [2245] Oh no
Enid (PS08Y)    [2246] That's true.
Stanley (PS095) [2247] not a bit of it.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2248] That's true.
Stanley (PS095) [2249] Well I mean after all they want er an appointment!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2250] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2251] But you don't get no appointment!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2252] That's right, you don't.
Stanley (PS095) [2253] Oh no!
                [2254] You see
Enid (PS08Y)    [2255] That's true.
Stanley (PS095) [2256] you take second place, definitely!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2257] Yes.
                [2258] I'm sorry
Stanley (PS095) [2259] Well
Enid (PS08Y)    [2260] it is true with some
Stanley (PS095) [2261] I mean, after all
Enid (PS08Y)    [2262] of them.
Stanley (PS095) [2263] you're, we're their customers!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2264] Ah, that's right!
Stanley (PS095) [2265] That's their living innit?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2266] That's right.
Stanley (PS095) [2267] Withou , they need er er anyone like ourselves, well, er
                er they'd have nothing to do!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2268] That's right.
                [2269] Absolutely!
Stanley (PS095) [...]
Enid (PS08Y)    [2270] And of course they're not so hard pressed as people are
                in these big cities!
Stanley (PS095) [2271] Oh no!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2272] You know, they have a nicer time of it here altogether
                don't they?
Stanley (PS095) [2273] Oh undoubtedly!
                [2274] Undoubtedly!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2275] Yes.
                [2276] They do.
Stanley (PS095) [2277] Because, I mean, there you are, look, I mean ... for
                argument's sake, now , well they have e e every Tuesday off or
                some Monday or Tuesday off don't he?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2278] Mhm.
                [2279] He does.
Stanley (PS095) [2280] The same as that Doctor used to come down and er
Enid (PS08Y)    [2281] Oh yes!
Stanley (PS095) [2282] for him.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2283] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2284] He was quite a nice fellow!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2285] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2286] So far.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2287] Yes, he's in ... Debenham now.

Enid (PS08Y)    [2291] He did.
Stanley (PS095) [2292] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2293] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2294] Do he live at Debenham now?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2295] Er, I think he does live at Debenham.
                [2296] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2297] He [...] , yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2298] I know he operates from there anyway.

Stanley (PS095) [2303] But then I mean ... come and saw me once, you see, when
                I wasn't there like that and ... he he tested from top to
                bottom, he said well ... ar ar after we sit and talked, and
                like he said well I better give you the once over, I said th
                er, certainly.
                [2304] And so he he tested and such like and ... he shook his
                head and he said well ... I don't know, I can't find anything
                wrong with you.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2305] No.
Stanley (PS095) [2306] And he said you're a better man than I am!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2307] Really?
Stanley (PS095) [2308] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2309] Aha.
                [2310] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2311] And that's what said, and that's what
Enid (PS08Y)    [2312] That's what the hospital said!

Stanley (PS095) [2318] And !
Enid (PS08Y)    [2319] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2320] I've had four doctors tell me I'm a better man than
                them!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2321] Well you wouldn't be ninety five if you were weakling
                would you Stanley?
Stanley (PS095) [2322] No I don't suppose so.
Enid (PS08Y)    [laugh]
Stanley (PS095) [2323] I don't suppose so.
                [2324] Poor old Doctor , he said you'll never wear your heart
                out.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2325] Really?
Stanley (PS095) [2326] He said, whereas an ordinary man live till they're ...
                seventy ... you'll live till you're ninety!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2327] Fancy!
                [2328] He knew, you see.

Stanley (PS095) [2340] No they don't, that's right.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2341] You see it's not thought to be the thing

Stanley (PS095) [2404] Old George used to be an old [...] ... he was always
                keen to be executor for anybody you know.

Enid (PS08Y)    [2407] That's right.
Stanley (PS095) [2408] And then on, at the back, there's a little cottage near
                the start there ... she used to live in that little cottage.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2409] Oh yes!

                because he poked his nose into everything!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2432] Mhm.
Stanley (PS095) [2433] He used to live up at The Dial.

                him you see?
                [2435] Well he said he'd take the radio.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2436] Oh good gracious!
Stanley (PS095) [2437] So he took the radio instead of, part payment you see,
                that was the first time.
                [2438] Well then, cos he was doing executor for poor old soul
                ... poor old [...] ... and er ... Ivy used to go and see her
                pretty frequently, she said do come and see me Mrs ?

                [2443] So one day she said to her ... Mrs , you haven't got a
                car have you?

Stanley (PS095) [2651] He paid for it!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2652] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2653] That's the sor ... he say, nobody need go short today!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2654] That's true.
                [2655] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2656] Other people ... what do they do?
                [2657] They take the money ... they go and buy videos, they buy
                records, they go and ... bu ba for fo football and all si
Enid (PS08Y)    [2658] Mhm.
Stanley (PS095) [2659] they spend the money in the wrong direction!
                [2660] There's no return!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2661] No.
                [2662] That's right Stanley.
Stanley (PS095) [2663] And then they
Enid (PS08Y)    [2664] It's
Stanley (PS095) [2665] say they're short!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2666] Yes.
                [2667] That's what you've been saying all the time this sort of
                bank lending's been going on haven't you?
Stanley (PS095) [2668] Yes!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2669] Mm.
Stanley (PS095) [2670] Yes!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2671] It's madness really!
Stanley (PS095) [2672] Ooh yes!
                [2673] And then
Enid (PS08Y)    [2674] Mhm.
Stanley (PS095) [2675] th a th th I mean th , all these repossessed houses ...
                they're lived far beyond their end zone!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2676] Yes , they do.
Stanley (PS095) [2677] They're ordinary working people, they wanna be
                independent gentlemen!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2678] That's right.
Stanley (PS095) [2679] And the banks and building societies have encouraged
                them!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2680] They have, I'm afraid, they have!
Stanley (PS095) [2681] Pushed the money onto them!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2682] And now of course they're paying the price too because
Stanley (PS095) [2683] Course!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2684] they're in a mess!
Stanley (PS095) [2685] It's their own fault!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2686] Absolutely!
Stanley (PS095) [2687] As you make your bed you lie on it!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2688] That's right.
Stanley (PS095) [2689] That's as simple as that!
                [2690] After all said and done, people live
Enid (PS08Y)    [2691] It is really.
Stanley (PS095) [2692] far beyond their income ... and when they get the money
                they spend it in the wrong direction
Enid (PS08Y)    [2693] That's right, because they haven't
Stanley (PS095) [2694] haven't they?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2695] had to work so hard for it perhaps, you see.
Stanley (PS095) [2696] No!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2697] They've borrowed
Stanley (PS095) [2698] You see
Enid (PS08Y)    [2699] it instead.
Stanley (PS095) [2700] you see ... go to a football match, or buying some ...
                er electrical appliance ... appeal to them far more ... than
                paying the rent!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2701] Yes, that's right.
                [2702] But a lot of people
Stanley (PS095) [2703] They don't pay the rent, no, ah ra , the tax payers have
                to make that up!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2704] That's true in many cases ... that's true.
Stanley (PS095) [2705] They've got swelled heads, people have!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2706] Yes , they have Stanley.
                [2707] It's very foolish!
Stanley (PS095) [2708] I wonder if anybody would know ... that what happened
                here ... ah er er ... two or three year ago was a ... up till
                re recently ... they know very well that couldn't last!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2709] Couldn't last, could it?
Stanley (PS095) [2710] Couldn't last!
                [2711] I know, [...]
Enid (PS08Y)    [2712] It wasn't reality.
Stanley (PS095) [2713] went and borrowed an eighty thousand pound and bought a
                house
Enid (PS08Y)    [2714] That's right.
                [2715] Mhm.
Stanley (PS095) [2716] well, he had to scrape to pay the rent at all!
                [2717] Then, on the other hand he had to go short indoors, well
                then when the ... I er th th ,th er the interest went up, cos
                he [...] !
Enid (PS08Y)    [2718] They don't work out how much they're paying for their
                money
Stanley (PS095) [2719] No, they don't!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2720] do they?
                [2721] No.
Stanley (PS095) [2722] They go to silly people like
Enid (PS08Y)    [2723] It is really!
Stanley (PS095) [2724] that!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2725] Is really.
Stanley (PS095) [2726] And the first thing they do th they go to the wo er er
                bo the boss of the firm where they work for ... and want more
                money!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2727] That's right.
                [2728] They can't manage.
Stanley (PS095) [2729] We couldn't do that!
                [2730] What do you
Enid (PS08Y)    [2731] Mhm.
Stanley (PS095) [2732] think we are!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2733] [laughing] Yes [] .
Stanley (PS095) [2734] They, and and they they've they've on the ba ba had
                their unions run the blessed country!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2735] Well they did.
                [2736] Certainly, they did.
Stanley (PS095) [2737] I sa
Enid (PS08Y)    [2738] And they will again, Stanley!
Stanley (PS095) [2739] I said
Enid (PS08Y)    [2740] If we get the wrong people in.
Stanley (PS095) [2741] that [...] Jackie will tell you the same, I told her
                mother anything from thirty to forty years ago ... I said, that
                don't matter some toss what political power they get in power
                you'll find the unions will run the country
Enid (PS08Y)    [2742] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2743] the way they're going on!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2744] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2745] They demand things!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2746] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2747] If, for argument's sake, they want fifty pound, they
                demand sixty!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2748] That's right.
                [2749] That's right.
Stanley (PS095) [2750] And they know they'll get something.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2751] That's right.
Stanley (PS095) [2752] Well
Enid (PS08Y)    [2753] Mhm.
Stanley (PS095) [2754] all that money that they keep demanding from the ... er
                th wa th wa the firms and such like that ... ought to have been
                ploughed back into the firm!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2755] That's right.
                [2756] That's right Stanley.
Stanley (PS095) [2757] If they robbed the firm, they're robbing themselves!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2758] Yes, and then they are.
Stanley (PS095) [2759] Anthony said years ago, when the rail ma men went on
                strike ... why do it?
                [2760] You'll only bring misery and distress on your own
                country!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2761] Absolutely!
Stanley (PS095) [2762] And that's as true today!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2763] Yes.
                [2764] It is!
Stanley (PS095) [2765] But they can't see it!
                [2766] All of them around ... they kill the goose that laid the
                golden egg.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2767] Well that's the trouble, they do!
                [2768] Yes.
Stanley (PS095) [2769] Yes, but then
Enid (PS08Y)    [2770] They do.
Stanley (PS095) [2771] these firms are gonna pack up!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2772] Exactly!
                [2773] Exactly, and then they lose the lot then don't they?
Stanley (PS095) [2774] [...] there's only one thought for th sa for them and
                that's for theirse [tape cuts off]
Enid (PS08Y)    [2775] I got erm ... Patsy coming in for a bite of lunch
Stanley (PS095) [2776] Oh yes.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2777] erm ... because we didn't see her last week.
Stanley (PS095) [2778] Yes.
                [2779] Well we

                [2783] Because er ... I can't bear to think of you without this
                room with that lovely fire in.
Stanley (PS095) [2784] Well, there you are.
                [2785] There's always some, look at my birds!
Enid (PS08Y)    [2786] Oh yes, the birds are there still aren't they?
                [2787] [laugh] ... Here's some fat for them.
                [2788] That's your medicine Stanley.
Stanley (PS095) [2789] Just a minute.

                [2795] That's your medicine ... there ... your eggs there.
Stanley (PS095) [2796] The instructions on them I suppose?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2797] Sorry?
Stanley (PS095) [2798] The instructions on it are
Enid (PS08Y)    [2799] Oh

                the tablets.

Stanley (PS095) [2812] the word I wanted.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2813] After you've taken those.
Stanley (PS095) [2814] Righto!
                [2815] I expect they'll tell you how many to take.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2816] I sho , I suppose so.
                [2817] Can I just check?
                [2818] I'm sure they will.
Stanley (PS095) [2819] Yes, you look , you look at them.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2820] I'm sure they will Stanley.

                [2823] Yes, that one's two tablets twice a day ... and that's
                for the water test.
Stanley (PS095) [2824] I see.
Enid (PS08Y)    [2825] Alright?
Stanley (PS095) [2826] So I gotta take them both?

Stanley (PS095) [2833] Yes, well what are these?
Enid (PS08Y)    [2834] morning and evening.

                                     the same exercise as you'd do in proper
                                     aerobics
Noel (PS090)                         [2946] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2947] but you're in the water the whole
                                     time.
Noel (PS090)                         [2948] I don't even know what proper
                                     aerobics are anyhow.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2949] Oh you just keep moving the whole
                                     time.
                                     [2950] Running on the spot and waving your
                                     arms about
Noel (PS090)                         [2951] Just seem to keep moving all the
                                     time without even running on the spot.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2952] Yeah well ... this is, this is ...
                                     you know [...] it's very difficult to run
                                     in the water
Noel (PS090)                         [2953] I know it is.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2954] cos it keeps getting round your
                                     feet and sort of
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [2955] making you drop over.
Noel (PS090)                         [2956] Yeah.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2957] And I suppose developing the
                                     muscles that keep you ... from dropping
                                     over ... it's pro can't be, can't be a bad
                                     thing.
Noel (PS090)                         [2958] I suppose it can't, no.
                                     [2959] I
Patsy (PS096)                        [2960] And then you do other exercises
                                     like lying on your back, putting your feet
                                     ... your ... from the knees downwards over
                                     the edge of the pool ... and then trying
                                     to do sit ups.
Noel (PS090)                         [2961] Good heavens!
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [2962] I'm too old for any of that.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2963] But Noel, isn't exercise against
                                     resistance is supposed to have some
                                     special benefit isn't it? ...
Noel (PS090)                         [2964] Well I'm doing that all the time,
                                     I'm doing it with you my love.
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2965] Oh come off it.
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [2966] [laugh] Erm ... I don't know, I, I,
                                     I, I ... I just feel that this is ... that
                                     sort of exercise where ... er
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2967] Ooh sorry.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2968] it only lasts an hour, it's not
                                     going to do any harm
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2969] No I'm sure it isn't.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2970] it's erm a good thing to be doing.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2971] Because swimming's
Noel (PS090)                         [2972] I think something that does do harm
                                     is jogging.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2973] Yeah well
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2974] Well yes that's a beast.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2975] I, I did a little jog this morning
                                     with the dogs cos it was too cold to walk.
Noel (PS090)                         [2976] Oh [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2977] Ah yes. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [2978] And I've got another one this
                                     afternoon I think.
Noel (PS090)                         [2979] Have you ever been in the sauna at
                                     er Woodbridge?
Patsy (PS096)                        [2980] No I haven't.
Noel (PS090)                         [2981] Er er no I haven't either.
                                     [2982] Er I one, went into one at Iceland
                                     that was ... it was lovely.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2983] I've been in a sauna in London ...
                                     I belong to a health club there.
Noel (PS090)                         [2984] Mm. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [2985] I used to play squash.
Noel (PS090)                         [2986] Mm. [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2987] That's a violent one isn't it,
                                     squash? ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [2988] Yes. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2989] I, I can't think that really
                                     violent exercise is a good thing generally
                                     is it?
                                     [2990] Something that's more measured
Patsy (PS096)                        [2991] Oh I don't think ... I don't think
                                     it hurts when you're young, I think when
                                     you're older you should only do it if
                                     you've done warming up first.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [2992] I think so too probably, and you've
                                     been used to it.
                                     [2993] That let's us off, isn't it nice?
                                     ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [2994] I think the warming up exercises in
                                     themselves are a good thing though
Noel (PS090)                         [2995] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2996] even if you don't do anything after
Noel (PS090)                         [2997] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [2998] after warming up. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [2999] The class I go to on Monday
                                     evenings ... erm ... we do warming up
                                     exercises ... and I'd be quite happy if
                                     they just stayed warming up exercises for
                                     the whole hour.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3000] Yes.
                                     [3001] ... Have you got someone properly
                                     qualified taking them?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3002] Yes, she's very good.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3003] Mm. ...
Noel (PS090)                         [3004] I went to a sauna in Iceland
Patsy (PS096)                        [3005] Mm?
Noel (PS090)                         [3006] and then was able to straight, in,
                                     in the hotel it was
Patsy (PS096)                        [3007] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [3008] straight up in the lift to my
                                     bedroom and it was lovely you know, yeah
                                     ... in the hot, in the [...] swimming pa
                                     pool
Patsy (PS096)                        [3009] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3010] or through the shower then in the
                                     swimming pool then back again ... and when
                                     I'd finished with it I went straight
                                     upstairs to my room and I went to sleep
                                     straight away, it was lovely.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3011] I was waiting for him to say he
                                     went out and rolled in the snow ...
                                     because that's the proper end isn't it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3012] Mm and you should beat yourself
                                     with twigs as well.
Group of unknown speakers (KC0PSUGP) [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3013] I'm not ... I don't know really
                                     about that.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3014] Oh you should definitely do that, I
                                     mean
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3015] That borders on the nasty I think.
                                     [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3016] They had a ... there was a sort of
                                     electric burner in the place as a whole
Patsy (PS096)                        [3017] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3018] where they kept on throwing on
Patsy (PS096)                        [3019] Water to
Noel (PS090)                         [3020] water with some erm sort of fir
                                     smelling in it.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3021] Oh yes, it made steam.
Noel (PS090)                         [3022] Mm.
                                     [3023] Fine mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3024] That's it.
                                     [3025] I should apologize for canned soup,
                                     but I spent so long talking to Stanley
                                     this morning
Patsy (PS096)                        [3026] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3027] you know sometimes you can just
                                     tell he wants you to talk to him, and erm
                                     ... so I er couldn't make a proper soup,
                                     sorry, but this is
Patsy (PS096)                        [3028] I think
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3029] good actually I think.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3030] Yes, which is it?
                                     [3031] Is it Heinz?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3032] Heinz tomato [laughing] [...] []
Patsy (PS096)                        [3033] I ... I made some stock the other
                                     day
Noel (PS090)                         [3034] Mhm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3035] and I put some of it in the freezer
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3036] Yes, ideal.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3037] in erm sort of bowls.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3038] What did you use for your stock?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3039] Some bones.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3040] And? ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3041] Oh ... some onions and ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3042] Carrot?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3043] carrot, yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3044] Celery?
                                     [3045] That gives a lovely flavour.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3046] I don't think I had any celery, I
                                     had, I had ... put in whatever I had in
                                     the house and sort of various herbs and
                                     spices and things.
Noel (PS090)                         [3047] Did you put the bones in the stock
                                     before or after the dogs had had them?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh] ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3048] During?

Patsy (PS096)                        [3050] The dogs went into it instead.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3051] Think what a luscious stock the
                                     dogs would make.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3052] No they wouldn't.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3053] Mhm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3054] Erm
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3055] All that hair.
                                     [3056] Yuk.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3057] erm ... no what happened was that
                                     he gave me some bones that were far too
                                     big for the dogs.
                                     [3058] So I made stock out of those.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3059] Where they gorgeous marrow bones?
                                     [3060] That [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3061] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3062] Oh yes, they make wonderful stock
                                     don't they?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3063] Mm.
                                     [3064] Well normally when he gives marrow
                                     bones I ask him to chop them up a bit
                                     smaller
Noel (PS090)                         [3065] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3066] but he gave them to me practically
Noel (PS090)                         [3067] Mm.
                                     [3068] ... He's an obliging chap isn't he?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3069] Mm.
                                     [3070] I always feel ... that when he's
                                     giving, [...] , because he gives them to
                                     one, doesn't charge for any
Patsy (PS096)                        [3071] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3072] er anything for the bones, one can
                                     hardly say ... erm give that another whack
                                     across the knuckle because
Noel (PS090)                         [3073] He wouldn't
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3074] the big knuckle has so much locked
                                     inside
Noel (PS090)                         [3075] He wouldn't mind.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3076] it doesn't it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3077] I do.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3078] Do you?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3079] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3080] I should really.
Noel (PS090)                         [3081] He wouldn't mind.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3082] I ought to have courage.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3083] He charges high enough prices for
                                     his other things.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3084] Yes he, you're right, mhm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3085] Erm ... when you do your stock ...
                                     do you first of all ... roast the bone?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3086] No but that is erm ... er a counsel
                                     of perfection or something isn't it?
                                     [3087] It it's a method anyway.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3088] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3089] Erm ... do you?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3090] No.
                                     [3091] Well I didn't because ... I just
                                     couldn't be bothered to put the oven on to
                                     get as hot as that for such short period
                                     of time.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3092] [...] What in fact does it do? ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3093] Oh I should think it erm melts out
                                     the marrow and does all sorts of quite
                                     good things for it.
                                     [3094] It probably gives it a good colour
                                     too.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3095] It gives it colour ... erm I'm sure
                                     because of the, of the fact that they're
                                     roasted.
                                     [3096] There's one thing that erm I
                                     sometimes do to give it colour, is once
                                     I've taken off the outside skin of the
                                     onion, the very outside
Patsy (PS096)                        [3097] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3098] I put the next one in.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3099] Mm?
                                     [3100] ... Does that, that gives it colour
                                     does it?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3101] I read that somewhere, mm. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3102] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3103] But roasting them, I wouldn't like
                                     to get them with any sort of burnt ...
                                     taste.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3104] Well I don't think it would give a
                                     burnt taste but I think, I think it
                                     probably could do quite a lot of good for
                                     it.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3105] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3106] Er I just read it in er I was
                                     reading Delia.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3107] Mm, yes.
                                     [3108] ... Oh yes she's good.
                                     [3109] ... And she tells you to do that
                                     does she?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3110] Yes. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3111] It's the matter of the moment
                                     really, you just fling them into a
                                     roasting tin don't you and put it in the
                                     oven?
                                     [3112] ... And that's alright if you've
                                     got a Rayburn but otherwise you have to
                                     start
Patsy (PS096)                        [3113] Yes, start from scratch.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3114] heating it up, mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3115] Now ... when I was away staying
                                     with my cousins
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3116] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3117] he is a G P ... in High Wycombe ...
                                     and he's a fundholder.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3118] Oh good, tell me about it.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3119] Well he's also been on hundreds of
                                     committees because they were sort of one
                                     of the early ones to be done
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3120] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3121] and they have a battery of sort of
                                     board members ... drawn from here there
                                     and everywhere, including a fair quantity
                                     of ... redundanted service people.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3122] Oh.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3123] They had an S A S officer running,
                                     running them [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3124] [laughing] Is that to get you ri to
                                     get rid of the patients he didn't want []
                                     ? [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3125] No, it was to get rid of the Health
                                     Service.
                                     [3126] He, he, he said that at one point
                                     this chap had used the phrase that ...
                                     well that they were going for controlled
                                     destabilization from the Health Service.
Noel (PS090)                         [3127] Controlled what?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3128] Destabilization.
Noel (PS090)                         [3129] Oh.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3130] The S A S man was?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3131] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3132] Why? ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3133] That's what the aim of ... the
                                     people doing it was.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3134] You mean the official government
                                     line?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3135] Mm or that's what they er ... or
                                     maybe that was his interpretation of it
                                     anyway this ... was a phrase that came out
                                     ... in, in the actual meetings.
                                     [3136] And then he told me a hilarious
                                     story about the way in which the chairman
                                     of the committee, I'm not sure quite what
                                     particular branch in the world he'd come
                                     from but ... he was looking at the
                                     figures, I suppose it was an accountant
                                     ... looking at the, the figures saying now
                                     why is it that the amount spent on
                                     district nurses has gone up?
                                     [3137] ... So he was told petrol has gone
                                     up.
                                     [3138] ... He said yes but you now have
                                     your health centre and the district nurses
                                     work from there.
                                     [3139] ... So erm they all looked at him,
                                     you know, the district nurses ... so John
                                     said to this man what ... there are some
                                     of our patients ... who are housebound ...

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3140] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3141] and some of them ... as well as
                                     being housebound, maybe aren't very well
                                     and are bedbound [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3142] [laughing] Mm []
Patsy (PS096)                        [3143] and the district nurses visit them
                                     in their homes.
                                     [3144] He had to explain it to this man.
Noel (PS090)                         [3145] Good god.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3146] Where did he fund this committee
                                     from one has to ask immediately.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3147] [...] he's not given his committee
                                     ... it's wished on him.
                                     [3148] The local authority
Enid (PS08Y)                         [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3149] the local authority creates the
                                     committee.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3150] But I, I had no idea that he then
                                     had to be ... that, being given his own
                                     funding, he then had to be ... organized
                                     by a committee.
                                     [3151] Oh that's outrageous.
Noel (PS090)                         [3152] Local council [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3153] I think it must have been some sort
                                     of
Noel (PS090)                         [3154] Yeah.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3155] thing like that, I don't know. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3156] Well it doesn't seem sensible, I
                                     thought it was the G Ps getting control.
                                     [3157] ... I mean this is what's going to
                                     happen ... to the detriment of the health
                                     service right through
Patsy (PS096)                        [3158] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3159] administration by people who don't
                                     know what it's all about.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3160] That's right. ...
Noel (PS090)                         [3161] [...] what has happened to a lot of
                                     these hospitals hasn't it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3162] Well it seems to be still going on.
                                     [3163] What do you make of this idea of
                                     building a new hospital at Norwich ...
                                     with fewer beds?
                                     [3164] I can't understand it because if
                                     they've got fewer beds why don't they,
                                     they just hide a few of the beds they've
                                     got already?
Noel (PS090)                         [3165] Absolutely. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3166] Mm why do they have to have a green
                                     field site ... and start again?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3167] Is it because they're going to
                                     incorporate a lot of high tech ...
                                     treatments?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3168] I think so, yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3169] Mm and, you see erm ... it is a
                                     fact that they need fewer hospital beds
                                     nowadays because
Patsy (PS096)                        [3170] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3171] the, the hospital stays are
                                     dramatically shorter than they were.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3172] Mm yes but we're coming up to a
                                     time when er the quantity of old people is
                                     going to be rather high ... [...] than
                                     before because we're all healthier.
Noel (PS090)                         [3173] Mm.
                                     [3174] Mm. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3175] They'll have something special for
                                     them like concentration camps.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3176] I know.
                                     [3177] Th they've got those in Ipswich
                                     already haven't they?
                                     [3178] That's what they've made the old
                                     Anglesey Road hospital into.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3179] Is that so?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3180] Mm something like that.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3181] I wonder how it really goes.
                                     [3182] I wonder ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3183] I don't know.
                                     [3184] Erm ... well it's
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3185] Oh this is disappointing because I
                                     thought that with G P who'll ... knows
                                     what he requires ... and what his patients
                                     require was going to have ... erm a pretty
                                     ... er erm
Patsy (PS096)                        [3186] Well you can't leave a G P to spend
                                     the money like he likes, you've got to
                                     have a committee for it.
                                     [3187] You think about it.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3188] You, you know?
Noel (PS090)                         [3189] Ah!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3190] Ah.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3191] Yes anyway have you heard about how
                                     they do the costing?
                                     [3192] Will was telling me about it, how
                                     [...] how [...] how they
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3193] Oh do tell me because I [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3194] how they cost erm ... something
                                     like a tonsillectomy.
Noel (PS090)                         [3195] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3196] And how do they?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3197] Well apparently they count the
                                     procedures that are involved in doing it
Noel (PS090)                         [3198] Mm?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3199] erm they have a price per procedure
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3200] Yes?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3201] and they tot it up.
Noel (PS090)                         [3202] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3203] But they haven't got it quantified
                                     to such a point where they can actually
                                     distinguish a tonsillectomy which might
                                     have a lot of procedures but actually
                                     takes about half a minute ... with er
                                     other things that are, you know, much much
                                     more complicated and the cost of
                                     tonsillectomies is unreasonably high ...
                                     compared with erm, you know, with [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3204] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3205] Really?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3206] Mm.
                                     [3207] They haven't, they haven't got the
                                     pricing right.
                                     [3208] And ... I can understand them not
                                     having the pricing right, I don't think
                                     they've spent long enough ... working out
                                     what the prices of things are.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3209] They've dearly gone on for years
                                     not knowing, let alone tonsillectomies,
                                     what
Patsy (PS096)                        [3210] Yes, they didn't
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3211] these wretched erm
Patsy (PS096)                        [3212] they didn't know
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3213] transplants costs.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3214] they didn't know what they cost ...
                                     but equally being asked to budget ...
                                     against not knowing what things cost
Noel (PS090)                         [3215] Mm mm
Patsy (PS096)                        [3216] is er equally stupid.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3217] Yes it is.
                                     [3218] Because er er ya ... absol
Patsy (PS096)                        [3219] But then, but then the er the whole
                                     thing gets knocked for six anyway because
                                     of general ... unpredictableness of, of,
                                     of illness.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3220] Well it does I suppose.
                                     [3221] It does.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3222] You can you can apply statistics to
                                     it a bit but it's very unlikely the statis
                                     st statistics ... and what really happens
                                     ... will always add up in fact.
                                     [3223] ... They, they've suddenly had a
                                     few outbreaks of polio haven't they?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3224] Oh have they?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3225] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3226] I didn't hear that.
                                     [3227] I say.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3228] Mhm.
                                     [3229] ... Yep.
                                     [3230] They've had the odd child who
                                     hasn't been erm whatnotted ... and some
                                     various
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3231] Ah!
Patsy (PS096)                        [3232] various men seem to have caught it
                                     from changing their nappies.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3233] Yes!
                                     [3234] I did hear of that.
                                     [3235] I'm sorry I wasn't relating it to
                                     erm ... to polio.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3236] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3237] Erm ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3238] Well you know, you've only got to
                                     get maybe smallpox back again and that
                                     will knock all their predictions for six.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3239] Erm
Patsy (PS096)                        [3240] They say they've wiped smallpox off
                                     the face of the earth.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3241] Yes they do you see.
                                     [3242] That's the doubtful one isn't it,
                                     because it's gone.
                                     [3243] It's supposed to be completely
                                     gone.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3244] Yeah but do they, do they inoculate
                                     children against it at all?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3245] No I don't think ... no I don't
                                     think we have smallpox inoculation er of,
                                     of children do we?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3246] Don't know we I mean we used to
                                     [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3247] Because they say it's ... it's,
                                     it's ... gone completely.
                                     [3248] Erm ... sorry love we need a fork
                                     for that.
                                     [3249] Perhaps the meat fork from the shop
                                     would do nicely.
                                     [3250] No er er ... [...] erm ... it's all
                                     in the cutting, of course it is very ...
                                     no that's pork and Noel daren't touch it
                                     so I've got two slices so that you and I
                                     could have one.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3251] That's very nice, thank you.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3252] And Noel will have the other.
                                     [3253] Erm
Patsy (PS096)                        [3254] I haven't had any pork for ages.
                                     ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3255] it's so new to them that they're
                                     bothering to cost it, but how did we go on
                                     in the older days?
                                     [3256] I'm trying to think.
                                     [3257] Did we know anything about what our
                                     operations were costing?
                                     [3258] I can't remember.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3259] Well if y you if if you go to a
                                     BUPA hospital you go pa you pay ... a sort
                                     of erm, you know, related type of [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3260] Yes a figure that's been around
                                     that anyway, yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3261] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3262] Ya. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3263] But I don't know
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3264] [whispering] I'm just having that
                                     to start with I think [] .
Patsy (PS096)                        [3265] erm ... I do I don't, I mean I
                                     don't know how accurate it is or whether
                                     it's sort of, you know, a set of figures
                                     they decided to put on.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3266] It wouldn't relate to what it costs

Patsy (PS096)                        [3267] to keep to keep to keep their
                                     profits going.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3268] Yes, that's right.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3269] Well it probably does relate
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3270] That's what it ... that'll be it.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3271] it probably does relate pretty
                                     well.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3272] I bet it doesn't relate to an
                                     actual operation in a ... general hospital
                                     because you've got so many people wanting
                                     their rake off in a private one surely?
                                     [3273] I mean haven't you?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3274] Yes.
                                     [3275] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3276] That erm
Patsy (PS096)                        [3277] Yes their profit [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3278] Ya that's right.
Noel (PS090)                         [3279] [...] rather tired ... bit fed up
                                     with private medicine at the moment. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3280] Oh because of Richard?
                                     [3281] I'm convinced that
Noel (PS090)                         [3282] [...] Richard
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3283] you know Richard ... er er ?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3284] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3285] Had he gone to a ... National
                                     Health hospital
Patsy (PS096)                        [3286] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3287] with the request to have that back
                                     thing done for him
Patsy (PS096)                        [3288] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3289] I'm convinced that at the age of
                                     seventy eight people do they would have
                                     said don't bother.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3290] Yes I'm sure they would have done.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3291] Ya.
                                     [3292] And er would have erm ... perceived
                                     that he wasn't greatly hampered by it, but
                                     once you've got a surgeon who is going to
                                     get a fat fee ... he did say to him are
                                     you sure you want this done
Patsy (PS096)                        [3293] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3294] but Richard was sure he wanted it
                                     done ... and nothing came between him and
                                     that ... intention.
                                     [3295] And you see he's, it's going to
                                     finish him.
                                     [3296] He's not going to get better.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3297] No.
                                     [3298] Erm ... but ... did he tol tell you
                                     that ... the surgeon asked him if he
                                     really wanted it done?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3299] Oh yes it's known that he did.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3300] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3301] He said er you're sure ... because
                                     it was quite a thought, for a man his age.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3302] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3303] But I think a surgeon in a National
                                     Health would have said ... look here I do
                                     not recommend this.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3304] Yeah but then the first thing he
                                     would have done would have been ... got up
                                     and gone off and got it done privately.
                                     ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3305] That is the danger.
                                     [3306] ... He would.
                                     [3307] So er the end was I suppose always
                                     connectable.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3308] Ya.
                                     [3309] ... If that's, if that's what
                                     private will do for you
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3310] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3311] Mm. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3312] I mean, I think, I hadn't realized
                                     that they would make different decisions
                                     on medical grounds. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3313] Mm ... they will, it's more
                                     permissive if you're in the private
                                     sector.
                                     [3314] ... I'm sure of that.
                                     [3315] ... It doesn't come so hea heavily
                                     loaded with advice against things. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3316] What, because it's all too good for
                                     the moneybags?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3317] Yes it's, it's I suppose human
                                     nature to want to pursue your craft ...
                                     wherever you can.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3318] Mm. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3319] But erm ... but it's been a very
                                     bad thing for him. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3320] Yes. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3321] But you see ... they've had
                                     computers in hospitals now for ... years
Patsy (PS096)                        [3322] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3323] and are, are employing and paying
                                     people to work them ... but they don't
                                     ever seem to come to any ... let's say
                                     reportable ... conclusion about the cost
                                     of operations.
                                     [3324] I think if we knew what those heart
                                     and lung transplants cost, people would be
                                     up in arms that the National Health
                                     Service is being expected to fund that.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3325] Mm.
                                     [3326] ... Well y ... they're a little bit
                                     like ... nuclear electricity in terms of
                                     erm ... the expensive end aren't they?
Noel (PS090)                         [3327] Mm.
                                     [3328] Mm. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3329] Yes I suppose that's so.
                                     [3330] ... I wish the government could
                                     really ... tellingly ... er do down these
                                     dreadful lies and scandal erm ...
                                     scaremongering things that the ... Labour
                                     opposition is putting forward.
                                     [3331] I mean they don't honestly care two
                                     hoots about people, if they can talk about
                                     the dreadful state the, the care of old
                                     people is in and ... all the rest of it
                                     and that it's going to get worse,
                                     frightening old people.
                                     [3332] That's not caring for the community
                                     at all.
                                     [3333] ... That's just erm ... politicking
                                     isn't it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3334] Yes.
                                     [3335] I can think of nothing worse than
                                     Kinnock coming into power.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3336] Oh!
                                     [3337] ... Imagine ... how people like erm
                                     ... erm ... Helmut Kohl and
Noel (PS090)                         [3338] Cook?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3339] Not Cook
Noel (PS090)                         [3340] Oh.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3341] because he's in his own party, I
                                     mean Cook yes well he's a snidey little
                                     thing, I'm talking about the erm
                                     ambassadors and the politicians, the
                                     ministers who would be
Noel (PS090)                         [3342] Oh yes, oh lord yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3343] you know, opposing him.
Noel (PS090)                         [3344] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3345] They'd just, they'd just run over
                                     him ... absolutely, whilst he was
                                     grinning.
                                     [3346] ... One can't see him in an
                                     ambassadorial role at all can one?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3347] No. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3348] It may not come to it. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3349] But this recession is quite a
                                     problem.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3350] Oh it must be. ...
Noel (PS090)                         [3351] It's a worldwide thing though.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3352] Mm.
                                     [3353] ... Yes but the trouble about it is
                                     that the English are so insular ... that
                                     lots of them don't, don't realize it or
                                     won't believe it.
Noel (PS090)                         [3354] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3355] That's true.
                                     [3356] They, they regard that as an
                                     excuse.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3357] Mm. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3358] Have some more chutney, it was
                                     given to us by our German daughter-in-law.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3359] Oh
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3360] So it will be perfect.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3361] Did she make it herself?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3362] She did.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3363] Goodness. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3364] It was our Christmas present wasn't
                                     it?
Noel (PS090)                         [3365] I forget what it was, was it her
                                     present?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3366] Mm.
                                     [3367] ... [...] ... Well has it been nice
                                     not having to go to France?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3368] Mm.
                                     [3369] ... Except of having to go to
                                     London instead.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3370] [laugh] Mm I couldn't tell how many
                                     people would agree with you about that one
                                     ... that London could be at least a bit
                                     preferable to Paris. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3371] Well ... Helen's a bit like you ...
                                     she, she sort of perks up when she starts
                                     to smell the petrol fumes [...]
Noel (PS090)                         [3372] Mm!
                                     [3373] [laugh] Ya.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3374] And she said she had a lovely time.
                                     [3375] She went to an exhibition, she ...
                                     went for a browsing sort of shop.
                                     [3376] She said the shops were empty.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3377] Mm.
                                     [3378] ... Shopping is much more
                                     comfortable now.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3379] Mm.
                                     [3380] I'd better go and try and do some
                                     some time.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3381] Mm.

                                     [3387] Smart, one could go to town or
                                     anywhere in it.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3388] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3389] Why is it you don't buy it then?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3390] Well because it's darkish in colour
                                     ... and I'd rather promised myself that if
                                     I have anything new now ... it'll be of a
                                     brighter colour.
Noel (PS090)                         [3391] Oh well go and buy the thing before
                                     somebody else does, go up this afternoon.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3392] Dearest I'm saying it's a dark
                                     colour.
Noel (PS090)                         [3393] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3394] Yeah but you could wear it with,
                                     you could wear bright things with it.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3395] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3396] Shush, don't

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3400] Very smart.
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3401] We're going to have Princess Diana.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3402] My size too.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3403] Is it?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3404] Mm.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3406] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3407] Why don't you go up and buy the
                                     thing?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3408] No.
                                     [3409] ... I'll phone her and ask her if

Patsy (PS096)                        [3411] Like the telephone woman.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3412] Mm?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3413] Like the telephone woman.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3414] Oh er isn't she oh isn't she super?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3415] I don't like the advertisements
                                     they're doing for the telephone now
                                     though.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3416] Which are they? ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3417] Oh they have this silly man who ...

                                     one of his old friends so he lapses into
                                     sort of Glaswegian.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3418] Oh no!
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3419] I haven't heard that one.

Noel (PS090)                         [3422] Lipman, Lipman.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3423] is very good on those isn't she?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3424] Mm. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3425] She's the right sort.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3428] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3429] A bit of it was on the television.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3430] Yes, I saw that bit and it wasn't
                                     good
Patsy (PS096)                        [3431] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3432] because sh Joyce Grenfell was such
                                     a lady, it came through.
                                     [3433] And ... and wh and er ... Maureen
                                     Lipman is much more earthy

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3435] and that came through and it was no
                                     good.
                                     [3436] If you've seen Joyce Grenfell you,

                                     well you could do, it could be done.
                                     [3442] Did you feel that about her on
                                     television?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3443] Well I felt, I just didn't know
                                     what it was but it lacked the sort of
                                     charm that it had before.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3444] Mm.
                                     [3445] ... Completely.
                                     [3446] Almost thought when she, when it
                                     was ... when it was erm ... er mentioned
                                     in the first place that she was going to
                                     do it
Patsy (PS096)                        [3447] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3448] I almost thought ooh ... you know
                                     I'd love to write and say oh don't, don't.
                                     [3449] [laugh] Joyce Grenfell was such a
                                     lady.
                                     [3450] You couldn't say that to her cos
                                     she didn't ... it would be insulting but
                                     ... in fact, that's the big difference.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3451] Mm.
                                     [3452] ... Talking of things like this,

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3453] Oh yes they do.
                                     [3454] Yes that's right, they do.
Noel (PS090)                         [3455] Mm.

                                     people had before all those sticky labels
                                     came [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3465] Mm yes.
                                     [3466] People who did things properly?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3467] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3468] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3469] Well ... when I was in the London
                                     office one chap who is an ... east end Jew
                                     made good, his name is Ralph , erm
                                     suddenly gasped and said gosh isn't this
                                     wonderful?
                                     [3470] So I sort of was called to look at
                                     it, and I said oh yes, all the people I
                                     know who have got those are over seventy.
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh] ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3471] [laugh] And was it one of his own?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3472] No no, someone had sent it to him.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3473] Somebody had sent to him.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3474] And he, he thought that it was ...
                                     such a touch of class about it.
Noel (PS090)                         [3475] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3476] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3477] [laughing] And I expect he's gone
                                     away to get them printed now []
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3478] [laughing] Oh probably.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3479] because I s I said, I said
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3480] How funny [] .
Patsy (PS096)                        [3481] I said well they're just what
                                     people had before ... the sticky labels.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3482] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3483] And he dragged out his sticky
                                     labels ... which, which had got blue
                                     stripes on them
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3484] No?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3485] [laughing] Yes, I thought [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3486] [laughing] No []
Patsy (PS096)                        [3487] that wasn't terribly elegant [] but
                                     anyway his blue labels had got, these
                                     little sticky labels had got blue stripes
                                     on them
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3488] [...] top and bottom. [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3489] Oh how funny.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3490] Erm ... and so I guess he's gone
                                     away to get some made.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3491] Mm [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3492] And I said ... and of course to do
                                     it really properly, you also have
                                     envelopes so that if you want to you can
                                     stick, stick the card in an envelope that
                                     will
Noel (PS090)                         [3493] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3494] fit it.
                                     [3495] Cos that's what we used to have.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3496] Mm.
                                     [3497] Oh yes it wouldn't go naked through
                                     the post would it?
Noel (PS090)                         [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3498] Well you can yes you can't
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3499] Mm

                                     quick notes
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3501] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3502] to drop on people's doorsteps
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3503] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3504] or, or
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3505] Which is useful.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3506] Yes.
                                     [3507] Or if you just want to sort of
                                     signify a, a quick thank you to someone.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3508] Mm yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3509] Or a quick come
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3510] Yes I hadn't thought about that.
Noel (PS090)                         [3511] Mm mm
Patsy (PS096)                        [3512] they're they are very useful, I've
                                     often thought of having some made
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3513] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3514] because, in fact every time I get
                                     one from someone else I always think why
                                     haven't I gone and got some of those yet?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3515] I know why, because you're not
                                     seventy. [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3516] That's right, give me another

Noel (PS090)                         [3517] We had those envelopes er and the
                                     cards for our concerts.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3518] Well they were probably erm ...
                                     invitation to a concert.
Noel (PS090)                         [3519] Yeah but they were all fixed up to
                                     go into the same envelope sort of thing.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3520] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3521] Yes [...]

                                     them though.
Noel (PS090)                         [3523] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3524] Got too much detail of where we
                                     lived and erm you know ... that it was a
                                     concert.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3525] But but these ... you know, you had
                                     your telephone number and [...] you know,
                                     just had a whole statement of everything
                                     about you.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3526] Mm mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3527] And ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3528] And all you needed was the brief
                                     message that you had to send.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3529] Yes.
                                     [3530] And it saved you hav it saved you
                                     having to do the preliminary thing of
                                     saying dear whoever you are
Noel (PS090)                         [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3531] Of course, that's right.
                                     [3532] That's right.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3533] which was sometimes quite a
                                     difficult thing to do.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3534] Well on a personal card you're not
                                     supposed to put dear anybody are you so
Patsy (PS096)                        [3535] I know but
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3536] that does make it difficult.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3537] No it made it very easy.
                                     [3538] You know, especially when perhaps
                                     you were having a mixed sort of meeting
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3539] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3540] wh I remember that when I was ...
                                     at home it was a mixed sort of meeting in
                                     which some of the people from the village
                                     were coming who you didn't really know but
                                     ... they had to be asked
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3541] Mm.
                                     [3542] Mm.

                                     could cover er cover the whole thing
                                     couldn't you?
Noel (PS090)                         [3545] Mm mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3546] Without saying dear so and so.

Noel (PS090)                         [3548] Mm.

Patsy (PS096)                        [3549] And without really having to sign
                                     it.
                                     [3550] You could just put your initial in
                                     the corner.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3551] Of course.

Patsy (PS096)                        [3596] It'll be fine.

Noel (PS090)                         [3601] Well autumn leave is the best way
                                     out of, of ... of er communicating.
                                     [3602] If I were to turn to a man on a
                                     bench
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3603] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3604] and say to him so and so and so and
                                     so he'd always answer back and say I want
                                     to do it this way
Patsy (PS096)                        [3605] Mhm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3606] and er the time was wasted, but you
                                     give an autumn leaf ... a little note
                                     saying what it, what you, what you wanted
                                     done there wasn't much chance he could
                                     argue.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3607] Yes I heard a very interesting
                                     conversation on the way down here in that
                                     programme Just a Minute ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3608] Oh
Patsy (PS096)                        [3609] you know the one I mean?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3610] I hate it but I'll tell you why in
                                     a minute.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3611] Mm mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3612] Go on.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3613] Well I don't like it very much but
                                     ... it has this very interesting
                                     discussion as to whether a fax was ...
                                     cheaper or more expensive than the
                                     telephone
Noel (PS090)                         [3614] Mm?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3615] and ... the biggest pro for a fax
                                     that I can think of is that you can send
                                     the message ... and that's that, there's
                                     no risk of it dribbling on into, into
                                     doubt [...]
Noel (PS090)                         [3616] Mm [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3617] As it would on the telephone, yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3618] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3619] How right.
                                     [3620] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3621] So I thought that was quite
                                     interesting to think
Noel (PS090)                         [3622] Mm and they can't argue with a fax.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3623] think about. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3624] I hate that programme because ... I
                                     like ... I tend to come and ... listen to
                                     the content of what they're saying
Patsy (PS096)                        [3625] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3626] and they're only saying it for the
                                     sake of keeping going.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3627] Yes [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3628] And then er so it's never, it's
                                     never worth ... serious attention is it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3629] Well just occasionally it is.
                                     [3630] Sometimes you do get something
                                     interesting.
                                     [3631] And and and and then
Enid (PS08Y)                         [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3632] and then they get interrupted and
                                     you wish, you know, you wish they hadn't.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3633] That's it, you see [...] that's
                                     full of frustration
Patsy (PS096)                        [3634] Yes it's [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3635] for me [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3636] [...] I don't like it, I, I prefer
                                     things like the news quiz
Noel (PS090)                         [3637] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3638] or ... even ... that one about that
                                     game with Mornington Crescent in it.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3639] Mornington Crescent?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3640] Yes. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3641] I've heard that phrase used but I
                                     don't know what it's for.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3642] Oh well it's, it's where ... they
                                     say ... say a sequence of underground
                                     station names or or locations
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3643] Oh
Patsy (PS096)                        [3644] in London ... in, in a sort of
                                     clever way that makes it sound as though
                                     there's some terrific good reasoning for
                                     it
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3645] Oh.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3646] and they just say it totally
                                     randomly and the last one just ... the
                                     first pers person who says Mornington
                                     Crescent is the winner ... but they've
                                     made a great big sort of ... fiction as to
                                     how ... why, when it is suitable to say
                                     Mornington Crescent
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3647] You have to come to it
Patsy (PS096)                        [3648] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3649] I, yes I see. [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3650] Th there's no logic to it at all
                                     but they play it on.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3651] How extraordinary, I've not heard
                                     that one.
                                     [3652] Mhm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3653] It's a programme where they also
                                     ... sing the songs of one tune ... wh to
                                     another tune. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3654] Oh ... you mean the programme where
                                     they do that?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3655] Mm. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3656] Erm well that's not ... that's not
                                     My Music is it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3657] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3658] No.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3661] can't remember what it's called.
                                     ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3662] Mm ... it's Jazz With Humphrey
                                     Littleton. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3663] Oh.
                                     [3664] ... I, I'm, I'm not with you on
                                     that one because erm I'm sure I'm ...
                                     vaguely at the back of my mind I think I
                                     know what it is, I have heard of it I mean
Patsy (PS096)                        [3665] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3666] or heard it
Patsy (PS096)                        [3667] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3668] but I can't bring it to mind, it
                                     won't come to the front ... as it were.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3669] Well I can't remember what it's
                                     called. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3670] Erm ... yes apart from My Music I
                                     can't think of one.
                                     [3671] I heard a very amusing thing on the
                                     radio this morning
Patsy (PS096)                        [3672] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3673] came in half way through it, at
                                     least half way erm but it was so obviously
                                     the voice of erm ... Freud, Clement Freud
Patsy (PS096)                        [3674] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3675] talking ... and he was telling
                                     about a visit he had paid to China for a
                                     whole week
Patsy (PS096)                        [3676] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3677] and how he'd seen ... prison and er
                                     they'd said they hadn't any prisons but he
                                     found one and ... erm ... hospitals and
                                     all that sort of thing ... and at the end
                                     of the week's visit erm one of the very
                                     high ups, whom he named and I've forgotten
                                     the name of him, I think I'll just use
                                     that, thank you ... erm sent for h he, he
                                     was brought before him as it were and the
                                     man said to him are there any questions er
                                     at the end of your week that you want to
                                     ask ... and he said ... well perhaps there
                                     is one ... he said erm Winston Churchill
                                     was here erm a month or two, a few months
                                     ago
Patsy (PS096)                        [3678] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3679] and he also, he like me stayed in
                                     the ... and he named the hotel in
Patsy (PS096)                        [3680] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3681] Peking ... he said can you tell me
                                     why ... his room was larger than mine
Patsy (PS096)                        [3682] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3683] and his room had three windows erm
                                     ... and I, mine only had two
Patsy (PS096)                        [3684] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3685] he said in spite of the fact that
                                     I've been in parliament for longer than he
                                     has, which surprised me cos I wouldn't
                                     have thought so ... this is the young
                                     Winston Churchill of course so the Chinese
                                     man said to him erm oh well the reason for
                                     that was that he had a famous grandfather
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3686] and so [laughing] Clement Freud []
                                     said, not to him but now on this programme
                                     this morning, that's the first time I've
                                     ever been de-grandfathered [laugh]
Group of unknown speakers (KC0PSUGP) [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3687] That was rather nice wasn't it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3688] Presumably his grandfather was
                                     Sigmund Freud was it?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3689] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3690] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3691] The Chinese didn't know.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3692] No I shouldn't think the Chinese
                                     have got much time for that sort of
                                     approach to life.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3693] I don't think they have either.
                                     [3694] I don't think they'd have been
                                     impressed even if he'd told them [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3695] No.
                                     [3696] Erm ... did you see that th
                                     they're, they're going to look for some
                                     sort of gene called the Churchill factor?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3697] No.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3698] Well they want to find out why it
                                     is that someone who smoked so much and
                                     drank [laughing] so much []
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3699] Mm!
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3700] had to live so long.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3701] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3702] Well it's obvious.
                                     [3703] It's the same sort of factor that
                                     allows anybody who smokes a lot to not get
                                     cancer and not get bronchitis and live,
                                     also live a long time.
                                     [3704] There are plenty of them.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3705] Well that's true.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3706] I it's just a question of, you
                                     know, something in your make-up that is
                                     inoculating you and other people have a
                                     weakness.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3707] Well that's right.
                                     [3708] Other people go down with it.
                                     [3709] You can't really I should think
                                     find a gene surely that's
Patsy (PS096)                        [3710] There must be something though
                                     Enid.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3711] Mm there must be.
Noel (PS090)                         [3712] His father was a very weak man
                                     wasn't he?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3713] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [3714] His mother was a character but ...
                                     [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3715] She was not nice.
Noel (PS090)                         [3716] Not nice but she had a strong
                                     character.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3717] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3718] But his
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3719] This reminds me
Patsy (PS096)                        [3720] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3721] might I just say this darling cos
                                     I've just remembered, I'll forget ...
                                     senile you see?
                                     [3722] ... Erm ... we have a video of the
                                     last programme of the Churchill series
Patsy (PS096)                        [3723] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3724] erm which a friend in London very
                                     kindly made for us because we were out
                                     with her, her mother
Patsy (PS096)                        [3725] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3726] and couldn't see it
Patsy (PS096)                        [3727] Mm.

Patsy (PS096)                        [3729] Really?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3730] Yes, she doesn't know how to work
                                     it to begin with but she
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3731] was working
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]

                                     ... the handyman chap came along and took

Patsy (PS096)                        [3733] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3734] so we can't see it.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3735] Do you want to come and see it on
                                     mine?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3736] I was going, I'm getting round to
                                     that you see aren't I?

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3738] Erm ... we feel rather badly about
                                     not returning it to this person who made
                                     it for us
Patsy (PS096)                        [3739] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3740] because it's now a fortnight since

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3777] and he may be able to see you then.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3778] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3779] So ... come Monday morning, Sunday

                                     [3780] We've got some ointment from the
                                     doctor which didn't work last time he put
                                     it out
Patsy (PS096)                        [3781] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3782] and seems to have worked this time.

                                     bother a busy man when it's feeling much
                                     better.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3784] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3785] So erm ... he didn't go

Patsy (PS096)                        [3790] So he's got an appointment?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3791] Mm ... Monday morning.
                                     [3792] ... And then he's going to call at
                                     Sotherby's.
                                     [3793] Do you know ... Sotherby's are the
                                     most dilettante people you've ever come
                                     across, they really are.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3794] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3795] With the exception of the one ...
                                     erm ... section leader that he deals with
                                     normally.
                                     [3796] At the beginning of this week a
                                     girl phoned up and said that erm ... the
                                     chap he normally deals with is away
Patsy (PS096)                        [3797] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3798] but there's an organ is Sussex they
                                     want him to look at ... and erm so he said
                                     well ... send me a photograph er they've
                                     got a photograph of it you see
Patsy (PS096)                        [3799] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3800] send the photograph and that gives
                                     me an idea whether it's worth going to
                                     look at it at all.
                                     [3801] ... That I think was about Tuesday.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3802] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3803] It never came.
                                     [3804] This is what they do, they phone up
                                     ... asking [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3805] They could have they could have
                                     even faxed it.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3806] Mm ... well we haven't got a fax.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3807] Oh no.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3808] But ... the thing is, what they do
                                     tend to do is, they suddenly find
                                     themselves in a panic because they've
                                     behaved like this about it and the person
                                     at the other end is shouting when are you
                                     coming to see this organ
Patsy (PS096)                        [3809] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3810] I was talking about how dilatory S
                                     er Sotherby's are.
Noel (PS090)                         [3811] Oh.
                                     [3812] Yes but I know the thing dear no
Patsy (PS096)                        [3813] Well of course they're not, they're
                                     not in a businesslike business are they?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3814] No ... not really, no.
                                     [3815] ... And I wonder if it seems to be
                                     that they prefer you come out of the upper
                                     drawer than come up with your brilliant A
                                     levels or whatever.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3816] They do, yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3817] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3818] Exactly that.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3819] Mm.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3820] They are erm ... a very, you know
                                     one, one of the last bastions where those
                                     sort of people can find a refuge.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3821] Yes.

                                     Kent's daughter.

                                     [3826] Does she work there?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3827] She works in art galleries or, or
                                     some art gallery
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3828] Or some art gallery.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3829] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3830] Mm.

                                     an art gallery.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3832] So he is.
                                     [3833] That's right.
                                     [3834] So he is.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3835] [...] there has to be space for
                                     these people ... though somehow I always
                                     feel that they cream it all the same.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3836] Mm I think they do cream it, yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [...] ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3837] Oh that's [...]

                                     in that case.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [3844] And then we'll arrange it with you,

Enid (PS08Y)                         [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [laugh]

Noel (PS090)                         [3851] How's your barn proceeding?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3852] Don't know, it doesn't seem to be
                                     doing anything and what the [...] was that
                                     during the week when [...] was in
                                     residence ... one night the dogs barked
                                     and he went out to see what was happening
                                     and there was a young man who worked in it
                                     ... this was in the pitch dark, was up
                                     there taking some of his stuff away.
Noel (PS090)                         [3853] Oh.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3854] Oh.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3855] So I wonder.
Noel (PS090)                         [3856] Has he run out of cash?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3857] Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3858] Why would he need to do it in the
                                     dark?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3859] Well if for instance it's
                                     approaching receivership ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3860] Oh oh oh
Patsy (PS096)                        [3861] you'd want to sort of, you know
Noel (PS090)                         [3862] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3863] Oh yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3864] get your stuff and you'd want it
                                     not to be obvious that you'd got your
                                     stuff.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3865] Oh I see, yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3866] But that's, that's only a guess
                                     though
Noel (PS090)                         [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3867] I don't know.
Noel (PS090)                         [3868] you mean the young man who actually
                                     owns it or the man who's employed working
                                     on it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3869] Well ... I don't know who exactly
                                     owns it
Noel (PS090)                         [3870] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3871] but the man who has been doing the
                                     work there who said he owned it
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3872] Oh I know, oh.

Noel (PS090)                         [3881] yes, Ann 's daughter
Patsy (PS096)                        [3882] Mhm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3883] who's got the farm up at [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3884] Mhm.
Noel (PS090)                         [3885] and there's a ... there's a farm
                                     for sale opposite there, you never saw
                                     such a wreck in all your life.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3886] Oh it is a wreck.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3887] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3888] Yes it really is.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3889] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3890] I think the vogue is dying isn't
                                     it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3891] Yes.
                                     [3892] Erm ... they're being much stricter
                                     about what you can do to them.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3893] Erm. ...
Noel (PS090)                         [3894] And how you do it perhaps.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3895] And how you do it and everything,
                                     yes.
                                     [3896] I think that erm ... across the
                                     road from me he's just mucked around.
Noel (PS090)                         [3897] Yes.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3898] He hasn't done things in the sort
                                     of, you know, the preferred way.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3899] That was the sign from the
                                     beginning wasn't it?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3900] Yes.
                                     [3901] And he hasn't had ... building
                                     inspections at the right sorts of times.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3902] Ah. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3903] So I think he's going to find
                                     himself in a lot of trouble.
Noel (PS090)                         [3904] That's good.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3905] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3906] Well he didn't, he did deserve it
                                     didn't he, really?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3907] Yep. ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3908] But he paid dearly for it in the
                                     first place didn't he?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3909] I think it's such a shame that he's
                                     gone and put that wretched wirenetting
                                     fence so close to the road
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3910] I agree.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3911] across the road from me.
Noel (PS090)                         [3912] That what?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3913] Wirenetting fence across the road.
Noel (PS090)                         [3914] Yes ... it is wretched.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3915] Cos it's so close to the road, it
                                     doesn't give me any swinging round room
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3916] Well actually if he's [...]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3917] on my side of the road.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3918] If he's having problems
Patsy (PS096)                        [3919] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3920] you may be able to get that
                                     rectified mayn't you?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3921] Ya.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3922] And say yes
Noel (PS090)                         [3923] Better arrange for the coal lorr
                                     lorry to back in to it one day.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3924] Ya I was I've been thinking of
                                     trying to have a big delivery of
                                     something. [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3925] I mean I would do you er have ?
Patsy (PS096)                        [3926] I don't have any coal delivered
                                     unfortunately.
Noel (PS090)                         [3927] Oh.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3928] I've go I've got some coal in the
                                     coal shed and it, you know,i it sort of
                                     lasts me.
Noel (PS090)                         [3929] Oh.
Patsy (PS096)                        [3930] I never seem to run out.
Noel (PS090)                         [3931] Because if you had old er ...
                                     what's his name? ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3932] Don .

Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Noel (PS090)                         [3935] er he would back his ... with a
                                     little encouragement from me he'd back his
                                     lorry right into it and [...] flatten it
                                     for you.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [3936] [laughing] Darling he's a very []
                                     nice man.
Noel (PS090)                         [3937] I know he is, that's why he'd do
                                     it.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Patsy (PS096)                        [3938] Well unfortunately if, if I did
                                     have a delivery of coal it would come in
                                     through the other entrance.
Noel (PS090)                         [3939] Oh [laugh] that needn't prevent you
                                     from ... backing in er backing into it
                                     when he turns round. ...
Patsy (PS096)                        [3940] No it's been, it's been a tough
                                     week this last week.

Noel (PS090)                         [4035] yes.

Noel (PS090)                         [4037] He signed up for three years with
                                     an option
Ian (PS097)                          [4038] Mm

Noel (PS090)                         [4041] And I think he's going to work out
                                     the other two and then go on to this ...
                                     forget the name of it at the moment, this

Ian (PS097)                          [4044] No I was sorry I missed him when he
                                     came over last year.
Noel (PS090)                         [4045] Last year, yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4046] I just had a quick phonecall with
                                     him.
Noel (PS090)                         [4047] Oh he did speak to you?
Ian (PS097)                          [4048] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4049] Yes that's right mm
Ian (PS097)                          [4050] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4051] Yes see that time went like
                                     lightning.
Ian (PS097)                          [4052] Yes.
                                     [4053] ... Such a shame.
Noel (PS090)                         [4054] Edmund is still in his job.
Noel (PS090)                         [4055] Aha.
Noel (PS090)                         [4056] He still hasn't got naturalization
                                     but he seems to be fairly ... erm fairly
                                     secure.
                                     [4057] He's a journalist of course.
Ian (PS097)                          [4058] Yes.
                                     [4059] Is he confident that he'll get the
                                     naturalization?
Noel (PS090)                         [4060] Oh yes, eventually he will.
Ian (PS097)                          [4061] Right.
Noel (PS090)                         [4062] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4063] W will that be this year or does it
                                     take much longer?
Noel (PS090)                         [4064] You can never tell
Ian (PS097)                          [4065] Really?
Noel (PS090)                         [4066] never tell, a ... girl we know went
                                     over at the same time as he did ... got it
                                     this year.
Ian (PS097)                          [4067] Really?
Noel (PS090)                         [4068] But er it's just the luck of the
                                     draw, it all depends upon the temper of
                                     the particular official that's handling it
                                     I think.
Ian (PS097)                          [4069] Yes. ...
Noel (PS090)                         [4070] I'll give you a ... funny article
                                     he wrote before you go.
Ian (PS097)                          [4071] Oh I'd like to see that. ...
Noel (PS090)                         [4072] [laugh] But er ... I'm just trying
                                     to think now er ... Ben [...] er the
                                     trouble with it is, Edmund can't leave the
                                     country ... whilst he's in a job ... until
                                     he gets naturalization because he's got to
                                     get a work permit and an entry permit and
                                     everything all the way through
Ian (PS097)                          [4073] Right.
Noel (PS090)                         [4074] and ... again er with the present
                                     state of unemployment in America it's
                                     unlikely he would get it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4075] It's very difficult.
                                     [4076] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4077] But he, he managed to ... get his
                                     extension to his permit because he had
                                     these English connections and the paper he
                                     was on ... reckoned that he was very
                                     valuable to them and so they
Ian (PS097)                          [4078] Good.
Noel (PS090)                         [4079] they held him.
Ian (PS097)                          [4080] Good.
                                     [4081] ... Well I'm sure he's
Noel (PS090)                         [4082] Are your wife and family well?
Ian (PS097)                          [4083] Yes.

                                     you even for a short visit though.
Noel (PS090)                         [4087] Oh don't be silly.

Noel (PS090)                         [whistling]
Ian (PS097)                          [4122] for twenty five minutes' journey to
                                     Waterloo.
                                     [4123] But it's got a huge garden which
                                     with the two boys I think will be
                                     marvellous.
Noel (PS090)                         [4124] Oh yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4125] It's very unusual for a ... even in

Noel (PS090)                         [4126] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4127] area.
                                     [4128] Huge garden.
Noel (PS090)                         [4129] I know Weybridge slightly.
Ian (PS097)                          [4130] Do you?
                                     [4131] Oh.
Noel (PS090)                         [4132] Mm.

                                     to make much profit on the ... on your old
                                     Chiswick house to be able to buy the
                                     Weybridge one, will that be an economic
                                     move?
Ian (PS097)                          [4134] Erm ... we save quite a lot er
                                     which is what we're trying to do, yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4135] Oh good, yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4136] Erm ... and it's er it's a good
                                     area for schools
Noel (PS090)                         [4137] It is a good area for schools, mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4138] a a and er it's you know a
                                     reasonable community
Noel (PS090)                         [4139] As a matter of fact I knew an old
                                     couple that ran a, had a nursery school
                                     there, a big one and a very successful
                                     one.
Ian (PS097)                          [4140] Yes I imagine it, it would be.
Noel (PS090)                         [4141] For a number of years they did have
                                     but er
Ian (PS097)                          [4142] It's a shame about le leaving ...
                                     Hounslow where Chiswick is
Noel (PS090)                         [4143] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4144] because they provide nursery
                                     places.
                                     [4145] And
Noel (PS090)                         [4146] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4147] so Thomas who's three is at school.
Noel (PS090)                         [4148] Oh yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4149] Whereas Surrey doesn't until
                                     they're five.
Noel (PS090)                         [4150] Oh dear.
Ian (PS097)                          [4151] So we'll have to put them
Noel (PS090)                         [4152] Even if they don't you can
                                     sometimes find that ... if you get behind
                                     the scenes that there is a way of doing
                                     it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4153] Yes.
                                     [4154] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4155] Got to spin a hard luck story,
                                     something of that sort.
Ian (PS097)                          [4156] Yeah.
                                     [4157] Yes.
                                     [4158] But erm ... we're very lucky where
                                     we are.
                                     [4159] The state schools are very good.
Noel (PS090)                         [4160] Are they, in Chiswick?
Ian (PS097)                          [4161] They do seem very good.
                                     [4162] Very pleased with them.
                                     [4163] But erm it's difficult living in
                                     London now.
                                     [4164] The erm ... you really are aware, I
                                     don't know if you get up to London much?
Noel (PS090)                         [4165] Do occasionally, yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4166] Yes but the erm ... the atmosphere
Noel (PS090)                         [4167] Oh I hate London, it's awful. [...]

Ian (PS097)                          [4168] Chris Christmas day ... I had a
                                     real chest erm ... and mouth and
                                     everything.
Noel (PS090)                         [4169] I can quite believe it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4170] And it's erm it's so oppressive and
                                     we really worry about it with the
                                     children.
Noel (PS090)                         [4171] Yes well I can see that, mm.
                                     [4172] I er I very much dislike London.
                                     [4173] We've got, still got a little house
                                     there
Ian (PS097)                          [4174] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4175] and er so it gets sort of
Ian (PS097)                          [4176] At the organ works?
Noel (PS090)                         [4177] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4178] Yeah.
Noel (PS090)                         [4179] It's a bolt hole
Ian (PS097)                          [4180] Mhm.
Noel (PS090)                         [4181] but I very seldom use it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4182] Yes.
                                     [4183] ... How, how's the er organ
                                     business going?
Noel (PS090)                         [4184] They're up to their eyes in work.
                                     [4185] Plenty of
Ian (PS097)                          [4186] Really?
Noel (PS090)                         [4187] of work.

                                     children because he thought that we were
                                     too old for them.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4246] Ya.
                                     [4247] And erm ... we just love it here of
                                     course
Ian (PS097)                          [4248] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4249] so we've got nothing to grumble
                                     about at all really.
Noel (PS090)                         [4250] Ian was saying how
Ian (PS097)                          [4251] Good.
Noel (PS090)                         [4252] he's moving out of London t to
                                     Weybridge or hoping to.
Ian (PS097)                          [4253] Hoping to.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4254] You are?
Ian (PS097)                          [4255] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4256] Oh are you?
Ian (PS097)                          [4257] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4258] That'll be nice.
Ian (PS097)                          [4259] I, I think so.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4260] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4261] It's not ... it's not out of choice
                                     entirely because er ... the business that
                                     I was has, has gone very very badly over
                                     the last eighteen months
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4262] Do you mean that type of business
                                     or that particular firm?
Ian (PS097)                          [4263] Both.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4264] Oh.
Ian (PS097)                          [4265] Yeah.
                                     [4266] But the particular firm I was a
                                     director of went into receivership
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4267] Oh dear.
Ian (PS097)                          [4268] beginning of last year, it was
                                     about
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4269] Oh that's [...]
Ian (PS097)                          [4270] a year ago now and erm ... so er I
                                     mean fortunately it was bought er as a
                                     going concern
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4271] Good.
Ian (PS097)                          [4272] erm but everyone's financial
                                     position er suffered as a result.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4273] Yes.
                                     [4274] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4275] So I'm not as, on as good a
                                     contract.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4276] You're not?
Ian (PS097)                          [4277] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4278] No.
Ian (PS097)                          [4279] But them I'm lucky to have ... have
                                     a job really.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4280] Well [cough] I mean these were the
                                     kind of jobs that weren't replaceable
                                     weren't they really?
Ian (PS097)                          [4281] Well ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4282] In a slump.
Ian (PS097)                          [4283] yes that's it.
                                     [4284] I mean there's so little business
                                     around that erm
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4285] That's right.
Ian (PS097)                          [4286] so
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4287] It was, it was ... somewhat a good
                                     thing that somebody was prepared to buy
                                     it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4288] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4289] Now I'll pull this forward a bit
                                     erm ... Ian
Ian (PS097)                          [4290] Sorry is this your seat?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4291] and ... no it isn't, no no no, not
                                     at all.
                                     [4292] Now I'm going to leave those there
Ian (PS097)                          [4293] Yes.
                                     [4294] Alright
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4295] and you'll just dive in to those
                                     won't you?
Ian (PS097)                          [4296] Oh lovely thank you.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4297] That's the thing.
                                     [4298] I'm going to sit quite near to you
                                     because I can hear better when I do.
Ian (PS097)                          [4299] Right.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4300] So.

Ian (PS097)                          [4306] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4307] that's right.
                                     [4308] Aha.
                                     [4309] So you've got to leave that now?
Ian (PS097)                          [4310] Yes.

                                     a, a phase.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4317] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4318] Things will change.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4319] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4320] I'm sure we've learnt er I've

                                     as a result of it
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4321] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4322] erm so ... positive about it.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4323] Yes.
                                     [4324] It's the only way to be really
                                     isn't it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4325] Well yeah yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4326] Have you got a house ready for you
                                     in erm Weybridge?
Ian (PS097)                          [4327] Well we're buying it from an ol
                                     elderly chap
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4328] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4329] erm he's been in it twenty years
                                     ... and er he's had it on the market for
                                     some time.
                                     [4330] It m probably not as long as a year
                                     but it's quite a while
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4331] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4332] er and he's accepted our offer
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4333] Good.
Ian (PS097)                          [4334] but he doesn't seem actually
                                     willing to move out
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4335] Oh [laugh]
Ian (PS097)                          [4336] er which I can understand really.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4337] You, one gets very fond of a house
                                     really.
Ian (PS097)                          [4338] I think he's he's split up with his
                                     wife
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4339] Oh.

                                     ... and it's obviously a very difficult
                                     time for him.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4341] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4342] Erm so he's keeping us in limbo
                                     really
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4343] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4344] which is a bit infuriating cos er
                                     Alison's due our third in ... [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4345] My!

                                     way
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4349] [...] yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4350] by then.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4351] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4352] Oh we're quite happy to rent for a
                                     while.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4353] I was going to say that's the
                                     alternative I suppose
Ian (PS097)                          [4354] Yes, yes
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4355] to, yes.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4357] And you might even have to do this
                                     er for an interim period or something
Ian (PS097)                          [4358] Yes
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4359] until he decides
Noel (PS090)                         [4360] Can you get
Ian (PS097)                          [4361] yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4362] places to rent alright?
Ian (PS097)                          [4363] Yes you can actually, yes.
                                     [4364] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4365] Mm yes, do help yourself Ian.

                                     meaning to go if he does let you
Ian (PS097)                          [4367] He wants to move down to a smaller
                                     house in Weybridge.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4368] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4369] Er which we're told shouldn't be
                                     difficult to find.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4370] Er no no.
Ian (PS097)                          [4371] So erm, you know, hopefully that
                                     will be the case.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4372] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4373] But erm ... I don't think he er
                                     realizes how difficult it is
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4374] No.
Ian (PS097)                          [4375] to set up
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4376] No.
Ian (PS097)                          [4377] a move and that really he's quite
                                     fortunate to have a buyer ... somewhere
                                     within the price he wanted.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4378] Indeed.
Ian (PS097)                          [4379] Cos we've all ... you know, we've
                                     all not got as much for our houses as we
                                     want
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4380] No that's very true.
                                     [4381] That's true.
Ian (PS097)                          [...] ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4382] Mm.
                                     [4383] Oh well let's hope that he will.
                                     [4384] I mean the thing is ... at the age
                                     of sixty he has no conception of what it's
                                     like to be your age at this period.
Ian (PS097)                          [4385] Mm.
                                     [4386] Well, you know, he hasn't bought a
                                     hou sold a house within the last ten years
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4387] Mhm mm
Ian (PS097)                          [4388] which we've done a number of times
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4389] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4390] and it's not a pleasant ... it's a
                                     very stressful business.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4391] I'm sure I'm sure it is.
                                     [4392] I don't know how we escaped it so
                                     much but we have you see.
                                     [4393] Because we lived on the business,
                                     that was
Ian (PS097)                          [4394] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4395] er a foregone conclusion and we
                                     never ... sought to move from there until
                                     he retired did we?
Ian (PS097)                          [4396] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [4397] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4398] So one doesn't know er exactly what
                                     it's like to do it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4399] No.
                                     [4400] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4401] Mm.
                                     [4402] Gosh.
                                     [4403] And tell us about the children, how
                                     old are they?
Ian (PS097)                          [4404] Harry is erm he'll be two in June
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4405] Mhm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4406] then Thomas will be four in August.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4407] Oh I see, so they're nice spaces.
Ian (PS097)                          [4408] Yes there'll be two years between
                                     all of them.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4409] Yes.
                                     [4410] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4411] So which Alison feels is erm ... er
                                     you know the right sort of time
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4412] Ideal really.
Ian (PS097)                          [4413] for her
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4414] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4415] which is obviously important.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4416] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4417] And erm they haven't had ... Thomas
                                     doesn't remember not having Harry around
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4418] That's nice.
Ian (PS097)                          [4419] whereas we've got friends who've
                                     got older children ... well a little bit
                                     there's, yeah, three or four years between
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4420] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4421] and they get er old enough to be er
                                     quite er happy that they're on ... you
                                     know,c centre of attention
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4422] Exactly.
Ian (PS097)                          [4423] which er Thomas hasn't.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4424] It sours the relationship a bit.
Ian (PS097)                          [4425] Yeah it does a bit.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4426] Yes aha.
Ian (PS097)                          [4427] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4428] Ah well I ... I [...] is this going

Ian (PS097)                          [4429] I don't know actually.
                                     [4430] [...] could be.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4431] [laugh] [...] you've got two boys
Ian (PS097)                          [4432] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4433] and so
Noel (PS090)                         [4434] [...] the last of the tribe.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4435] Oh the last of the tribe.
Noel (PS090)                         [4436] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4437] Well I think I think you know what
                                     I mean.
Ian (PS097)                          [4438] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4439] Erm that's what we did finally in
                                     desperation with Ben wasn't it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4440] [laughing] You decided to []
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4441] [laughing] He was five, number five
                                     [] .
                                     [4442] Erm it would be nice to have a
                                     little girl then now wouldn't it
Ian (PS097)                          [4443] Mm
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4444] really?
Ian (PS097)                          [4445] I'd, it's funny because I always
                                     wanted a girl
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4446] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4447] but now I, I wouldn't know, I don't
                                     feel [laughing] I'd know what to do []
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4448] Mm well ... this is just how Ruth
                                     was.
Ian (PS097)                          [4449] Yes [...]
Noel (PS090)                         [4450] [...] got no choice.

                                     [4452] No that's right.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4453] This is what Ruth er felt cos she
                                     had two boys
Ian (PS097)                          [4454] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4455] but erm and she thought I shan't
                                     know how to deal with a girl at all
Ian (PS097)                          [4456] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4457] which is a funny thing for a woman
                                     to think isn't it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4458] Well Alison feels the same, yes
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4459] Does she?
Ian (PS097)                          [4460] Yes, yes she does.
                                     [4461] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4462] It is odd isn't it?
                                     [4463] But
Ian (PS097)                          [4464] And then she had
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4465] Oh, oh she adores her, and of
                                     course she said it's wonderful, I don't
                                     have to keep struggling to get boys out of
                                     their trousers.
Ian (PS097)                          [4466] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4467] This of course is passing now
                                     because the girl's

                                     the youngest one.
Ian (PS097)                          [4474] Oh.

                                     able to put her in dresses.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4479] That's the first day at school

                                     school.
Ian (PS097)                          [4484] Oh lovely. [laugh]

                                     [4488] So Ruth I think as far as, barring
                                     accidents, will regard that as being her
                                     final [...]
Ian (PS097)                          [4489] Right.

                                     things can't be that bad
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4577] Have they?

Ian (PS097)                          [4602] All they can cope with I think.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4603] And of course he'll be bilingual.
Ian (PS097)                          [4604] Well he is.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4605] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4606] He's quite slow as a result, which
                                     is quite common apparently
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4607] Is it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4608] with er ... children who are

                                     very well to start off with.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4612] And how old is he did you say?
Ian (PS097)                          [4613] He's two and a half [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4614] Oh well it's early.
                                     [4615] It's such an advantage to them
                                     later on I think.
Ian (PS097)                          [4616] Oh well a absolutely yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4617] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4618] Er he ... because Toni, Hamish's

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4619] Mm
Ian (PS097)                          [4620] is half French ... so
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4621] Is she?
Ian (PS097)                          [4622] I'm, I'm sure he'll her pick up
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4623] Get three.
                                     [4624] Trilingual.
Ian (PS097)                          [4625] Yes.
                                     [4626] Cos they spend quite a lot of time,
                                     they spend their holidays in France.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4627] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4628] So I'm sure that confuses him even
                                     more at this stage.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4629] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [4630] Course it does.
Ian (PS097)                          [4631] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4632] Yes but in the end it does seem to
                                     work.
                                     [4633] I was always ... a bit doubtful
                                     about it
Ian (PS097)                          [4634] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4635] erm er you know, whether it could
                                     vu confuse children or not but in fact it
                                     doesn't seem to with John's children does
                                     it?
Noel (PS090)                         [4636] No no.
                                     [4637] His
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4638] They use
Noel (PS090)                         [4639] his wife is German.
Ian (PS097)                          [4640] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4641] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4642] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4643] And they use both languages quite
                                     freely.
Ian (PS097)                          [4644] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4645] In fact she gets rather ... uptight
                                     because erm ... during the year at school

                                     time
Ian (PS097)                          [4646] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4647] which is very natural, and so she

Ian (PS097)                          [4648] To put them straight.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4656] Well help yourself then if you want
                                     one.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4668] Everybody's having to cope with it.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4670] Of course.
Ian (PS097)                          [4671] everyone er
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4672] They're bound to use it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4673] bound to use anything they can
Noel (PS090)                         [4674] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4675] er any angle they can get, get a
                                     grip of.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4676] Yes.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4678] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4679] which of course have lost a lot of
                                     money in the last year or two.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4680] That's right of course.
                                     [4681] They have, they will be drawing
                                     back on most things.
Ian (PS097)                          [4682] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4683] [cough] But in fact ... they're the

                                     people on the staff?
Ian (PS097)                          [4684] Yes they are.
                                     [4685] They're much, much better.

                                     they're in recession I, I think there's
                                     ... you know in this country
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4687] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4688] we we're owned now, our company, by
                                     a French agency group ... and erm ... none
                                     of our directors are, are learning French.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4689] Isn't it extraordinary.
Ian (PS097)                          [4690] And yet you've got ... people who
                                     run restaurants, small businesses of that
                                     sort erm ... just general businessmen who
                                     want, you know, know they have to speak

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4691] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4692] And they're just doing it as a
                                     matter of course over there.
Noel (PS090)                         [4693] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4694] They all seem to have more drive
                                     than our people, what's the matter with
                                     us? ...
Ian (PS097)                          [4695] It's certainly in the, in that
                                     area, it's the cosmopolitan business
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4696] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4697] attitude er ... and also it's

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4698] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4699] you can get away with it.
                                     [4700] You know all the meetings
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4701] That's right.
Ian (PS097)                          [4702] are held in English.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4703] Mm.
                                     [4704] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4705] And er the French speak very good
                                     English
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4706] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4707] erm so there's, there's not enough
                                     incentive there.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4708] No.
Ian (PS097)                          [4709] And I have to say that er I don't.
                                     [4710] But I, I, I ... I ou really I, I
                                     know I'll have to be thrown into the
                                     situation of having to do it
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4711] You'd better get on with it and do
                                     it now.
Ian (PS097)                          [4712] Yes. [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4713] But of course the beauty of it is
                                     you've done it at school haven't you?
Ian (PS097)                          [4714] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4715] And once you've done it at school,
                                     it comes back with a bit of an effort
                                     quite quickly.
Ian (PS097)                          [4716] Yeah I've got a reasonable
                                     vocabulary
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4717] Yes.
                                     [4718] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4719] but never really spoken it at all.
                                     [4720] I mean we never did any French
                                     trips. [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4721] Didn't you?
Ian (PS097)                          [4722] was useless for languages when I
                                     was there.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4723] Was it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4724] Yes absolutely hopeless.
                                     [4725] We never did any ... trips of that
                                     nature at all actually.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4726] And what was the teaching system?
                                     [4727] Er had they ... by the time you
                                     were still at school ... come on to that
                                     new erm ... er system where you speak a
                                     lot more?
Ian (PS097)                          [4728] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4729] No.
                                     [4730] You've done it out of grammar
                                     books?
Ian (PS097)                          [4731] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4732] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4733] Yes.
                                     [4734] I remember
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4735] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4736] it was, yeah vocabulary tests and
                                     that sort of thing which
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4737] Mm.
                                     [4738] Mm.

                                     middle ages approach to [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4740] Well actually the one thing you can
                                     say about it is, it is a good grounding
                                     for what you now go on and do
Ian (PS097)                          [4741] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4742] because erm wherever you go now for
                                     ... refresher lessons, they will use the
                                     modern method.
Ian (PS097)                          [4743] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4744] And that's, that will build on that
                                     foundation.
Ian (PS097)                          [4745] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4746] You'll be astonished how quickly
                                     it'll come back.
Ian (PS097)                          [4747] Mm mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4748] You really will.
Ian (PS097)                          [4749] Hopefully.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4750] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [4751] Yes all we had when I was at school
                                     were l l yards of verbs and yards of
                                     nouns, we never knew how to put the two
                                     lots together.
Ian (PS097)                          [4752] No.
Noel (PS090)                         [laughing] [...] []
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4753] That's true.
Noel (PS090)                         [4754] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4755] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4756] The people who had the imagination
                                     or ability to do it where the ones that
                                     could speak the languages, the ones that
                                     didn't
Noel (PS090)                         [4757] Yes it was
Ian (PS097)                          [4758] made no connection at all.
Noel (PS090)                         [4759] Mm.
                                     [4760] Because I knew a lot of nouns and a
                                     lot of verbs, I could get by when I went
                                     to Algeria in
Ian (PS097)                          [4761] Mm.

                                     envied those who could really speak.

                                     or something of that sort I could provide
                                     the word and he provided the conversation.
Ian (PS097)                          [4766] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]

                                     opportunity?
Ian (PS097)                          [4770] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4771] I think probably

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4773] Mm I would imagine it's quite well
                                     led.
Ian (PS097)                          [4774] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4775] Ya.

Ian (PS097)                          [4777] Mm. [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4778] [...] Aha.
Ian (PS097)                          [4779] I'll have to give up my art classes

                                     past few years.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4784] Yes but will it rule it out
                                     altogether do you think if you've got to
                                     do the French?
Ian (PS097)                          [4785] Well A Alison goes out for one
                                     evening so that means I have to get back
                                     early for that evening
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4786] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4787] and then if I, I go out for another
                                     one, that means two evening evenings back
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4788] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4789] leaving the office at ... five

Enid (PS08Y)                         [4790] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4791] I, I can't do that more than twice
                                     a week.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4792] No.
                                     [4793] No I see.
                                     [4794] Your work itself is going to take
                                     more time than that.
Ian (PS097)                          [4795] Well yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4796] Is that just at first or is it ...
                                     regularly?
Ian (PS097)                          [4797] No I mean it's, it's always been
                                     the case.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4798] Mm.
                                     [4799] Mm.
                                     [4800] ... Ya.
Ian (PS097)                          [4801] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4802] It's tough really.
                                     [4803] It is tough.
Ian (PS097)                          [4804] It's very erratic the work as well,
                                     it's it's
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4805] Yes, is it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4806] very, you know, stop start [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4807] Yes.
                                     [4808] Is it still advertising?
Ian (PS097)                          [4809] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4810] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4811] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4812] You must be pretty good at that by
                                     now.
Ian (PS097)                          [4813] Well I've got quite a lot of
                                     experience [...] I mean I've
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4814] Yes you have.
Ian (PS097)                          [4815] I've done it since I was, well it's
                                     getting on for fifteen years now.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4816] It isn't?
Ian (PS097)                          [4817] Yeah, thirteen years in, in
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4818] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4819] the same area
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4820] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4821] [...] I've not really moved around
                                     a lot
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4822] No.
                                     [4823] No.
Ian (PS097)                          [4824] in the actual function.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4825] No.
Ian (PS097)                          [4826] Just sort of progressed up the
                                     ladder I suppose
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4827] Yes.
Noel (PS090)                         [4828] Mhm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4829] so, yes ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4830] Yes.
                                     [4831] Oh well, you can only make the best
                                     of the thing you've got and that's the
                                     best thing to do rather than
Ian (PS097)                          [4832] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4833] unless you're forced to switch er
                                     horses, you know in, in mid stream.
Ian (PS097)                          [4834] Yeah.
                                     [4835] Well i i I always say that er it
                                     always comes a surprise that I was good at
                                     anything.
                                     [4836] And I always think back to the er
                                     the time I think Edmund and I were sitting
                                     in the back garden here ... and deciding
                                     that we'd go off and join the paratroopers
Noel (PS090)                         [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4837] Really?
Ian (PS097)                          [4838] [laughing] because we weren't going
                                     to get [] any O levels.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4839] Oh!
Ian (PS097)                          [4840] And that was [laughing] about all
                                     we were good for [] .
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4841] [laugh] I'm sorry.
Noel (PS090)                         [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4842] How funny.
                                     [4843] But in fact you did get your O
                                     levels didn't you?
Ian (PS097)                          [4844] So I remember [...] well I got a
                                     handful
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4845] Yes I remember
Ian (PS097)                          [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4846] Mm.
Noel (PS090)                         [4847] And Edmund got a B A.
Ian (PS097)                          [4848] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4849] Ah but wait a minute, not until
                                     after that was it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4850] [...] yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4851] He got his O levels but that was
                                     it.
Ian (PS097)                          [4852] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4853] Decided [...] he'd had enough and I
                                     suppose you had too.
Ian (PS097)                          [4854] Mm well
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4855] Did you stay on for As?
Ian (PS097)                          [4856] Yes I did.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4857] Mm.
Ian (PS097)                          [4858] But again I ... you know I always
                                     had the ability to er to know, to scrape
                                     by
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4859] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4860] or knowing what the minimum
                                     required was
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Ian (PS097)                          [4861] and er pitching myself at just over
                                     that point I think.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4862] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4863] Which I suppose is some sort of
                                     [laughing] ability [] [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4864] Well it's a it's a, in a way that's
                                     quite true.
Ian (PS097)                          [4865] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4866] Yes it saves the er er the use of
                                     excess energy when you don't need to
                                     doesn't it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4867] Yes.
                                     [4868] That's right.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4869] Ah.
                                     [4870] Edmund was lucky because he got
                                     this chance to do ... a university you see
                                     in
Ian (PS097)                          [4871] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4872] in er New Hampshire wasn't it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4873] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4874] Erm ...
Ian (PS097)                          [4875] Well that's when er Ben and I saw
                                     him, when he was doing it
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4876] That's right, you did.
Ian (PS097)                          [4877] doing that, yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4878] You did.
Ian (PS097)                          [4879] Yeah.
                                     [4880] But I'd love to see him again.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4881] Oh yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [4882] I'd love to get a trip out there.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [4883] It would be wonderful wouldn't it?
Ian (PS097)                          [4884] Yes.

                                     we soon had, started having our children
                                     didn't we?
Ian (PS097)                          [5031] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5032] Erm ... ooh wait a minute we're
                                     saying, we're saying than Edmund aren't
                                     we?
Noel (PS090)                         [5033] Yes mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5034] Of course, I'm stupid.
                                     [5035] He was the eldest of their
                                     children.
Ian (PS097)                          [5036] Dan was?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5037] Dan was.
Noel (PS090)                         [5038] Yes.
Ian (PS097)                          [5039] Oh right.
                                     [5040] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5041] Ya.
                                     [5042] So I'm v I'm a bit vague about it,
                                     you may well be right and it's two years
Ian (PS097)                          [5043] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5044] because of course we've got older
                                     children than Edmund.
Noel (PS090)                         [5045] That would line him up with Edmund
                                     though wouldn't it?
                                     [5046] No
Ian (PS097)                          [5047] Yes
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5048] No
Ian (PS097)                          [5049] no [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5050] no, a couple of years you're quite
                                     right.
Noel (PS090)                         [5051] Mm?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5052] Couple of years older I should
                                     think.
                                     [5053] Yeah.
                                     [5054] That's it.
                                     [5055] But erm oh they're a great family
                                     they really are but I think George and J
                                     Joy's having Edmund because although Dan
                                     lives in the town er what's it called, New
                                     Haven?
Ian (PS097)                          [5056] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5057] Erm obviously he's got his own
                                     business, he's got a shop now, an
                                     outfitter's shop.
Ian (PS097)                          [5058] Yes [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5059] Did he have it that time?
Ian (PS097)                          [5060] He had something like that.
                                     [5061] He was so vague though.
                                     [5062] I mean
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5063] I know
Ian (PS097)                          [5064] he was delightfully vague
Noel (PS090)                         [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5065] Oh [...] he's an absolutely
Ian (PS097)                          [5066] [laugh] but I was never really sure
                                     [laughing] what he was doing [] .
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5067] [laughing] No []
Ian (PS097)                          [5068] Er yes I ... I thought he had a
                                     shop, maybe yes ... [...]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5069] That's er he worked in a shop ...
                                     probably at that time.
Ian (PS097)                          [5070] Yes I think so yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5071] That's it, he worked in that er
                                     fancy goods shop
Ian (PS097)                          [...]
Noel (PS090)                         [5072] That's right.
Ian (PS097)                          [5073] [...] nine years ago

Ian (PS097)                          [5075] that we went.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5076] Sorry?
Ian (PS097)                          [5077] I think it was nine years ago.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5078] Was it?
Ian (PS097)                          [5079] Yes.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5081] It doesn't seem possible really
                                     does it?
Ian (PS097)                          [5082] The year before I married.
                                     [5083] Eighty five.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5084] Good heavens.
                                     [5085] Was it really?
Ian (PS097)                          [5086] Is that no, no eighty five that ...
                                     no eighty three, that's right, yes, nine
                                     years.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5087] Was it?

Ian (PS097)                          [5089] Yes.

Ian (PS097)                          [5092] Oh it was a marvellous trip.
                                     [5093] Splendid.

                                     [5111] I'm most envious of him I am.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5112] And do you sometimes get any word
                                     from him?
Ian (PS097)                          [5113] Very rarely. [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5114] Mm well so do we.

Ian (PS097)                          [5117] I must write to him myself
                                     actually.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5118] Have you got his latest address?
Ian (PS097)                          [5119] I haven't, no.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5120] I'd better give it to you because
                                     he has

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5122] changed it.
Ian (PS097)                          [5123] I did bring my address book with

             impressed by it, I was much more interested in China.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5199] I didn't
Noel (PS090)                         [5200] Yes.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5206] And is that for children who are
                                     ... living there or just go in for the
                                     day?
Noel (PS090)                         [5207] Just go in for the day till their

                                     yeah.
                                     [5211] Aha.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5212] And what qualifications mus must

Noel (PS090)                         [5213] Erm, I don't really know at the
                                     moment, I gotta look up and see what it
                                     needs, like [...] and things ... [...] to
                                     do ... and study, things like that.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5214] Mhm.

                                     [5220] Mhm.
                                     [5221] It's all to do with GCSE coursework
                                     and ... see how we're getting on ...
                                     during the two weeks and ... we get
                                     experience for us when we leave school and
                                     go to work. [...]

Noel (PS090)                         [5223] Yeah.

Noel (PS090)                         [5225] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5226] I think it's one of the best jobs
                                     for a girl that there are don't you?
Unknown speaker (KC0PSUNK)           [5227] Well I think so, I think ... erm

                                     children ... and then ... they've got the
                                     time when they can leave off and come, but
                                     it's having the whole time, well then
                                     they've children all their life haven't
                                     they?

                                     children!

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5313] Because of all the trimmings.
Unknown speaker (KC0PSUNK)           [5314] Well it's ... not very good this

                                     of our own garden all the year round but
                                     ... they didn't do very well this year did
                                     they?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5318] No.

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5320] Why's that?
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5321] the worst garden had for years!
                                     [5322] It's a dry summer time.

                                     cauliflowers weighing nearly five and
                                     seven pound, but this year I shan't have
                                     ... one weight two pound!
Enid (PS08Y)                         [5327] Is that because of the dry winter?

Enid (PS08Y)                         [5333] They didn't get a hold, didn't get
                                     a start.

                                     my shirt.
Noel (PS090)                         [6303] Well when Panda , when you were
                                     peeling potatoes she sort of lying on your
                                     back when you was bending there like that.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6304] [laughing] Yeah that's it [] !
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6305] [laughing] Yes [] !
                                     [6306] A good place to be!
Noel (PS090)                         [6307] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6308] I I like cats better than dogs
                                     because
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6309] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6310] I think ... dogs want a fuss made
                                     of them, cats don't really.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6311] No, no no
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6312] The , there's a way of
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6313] they don't like , they don't like
Unknown speaker (KC0PSUNK)           [6314] They're independent.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6315] a lot of fuss.
Unknown speaker (KC0PSUNK)           [6316] No.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6317] They're much more independent.
Unknown speaker (KC0PSUNK)           [6318] Yes.
Mollie (PS091)                       [6319] Apparently, she sort of
Enid (PS08Y)                         [...]
Mollie (PS091)                       [6320] lays on that hearth ...
Enid (PS08Y)                         [...]
Mollie (PS091)                       [6321] right, and right in front of the
                                     fire and their ... two feet sort of on
                                     guard sitting, and his down like that.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6322] Feeling the fire.
Mollie (PS091)                       [6323] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6324] [laughing] Yes [] !
Mollie (PS091)                       [6325] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)                         [6326] Let's see how you've been getting
                                     on.
*** 11 (Tape 033502) ***
Enid (PS08Y)   [6327] Do you get at school any erm ... any sort of music
               lessons?
Mollie (PS091) [6328] Erm ... yes.
               [6329] On Thursdays I go to music lesson ... and erm, we have
               this singing contest ... erm, we come second out of the ...
               first years, and we sung Mole in a Hole.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6330] Good!
Mollie (PS091) [6331] Erm ... at dinner times you can go into the music room
               ... erm ... you can play on any music instrument you like ...
               there's ... keyboards ... erm, violins ... guitars erm ...
               drums.
               [6332] I tried to play on the drums, I'm not too good at that.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6333] [laugh] They make a terrible noise don't they [] ?
Mollie (PS091) [6334] Yeah.
               [6335] Erm ... Only trouble, there's a snare drum ... you can
               turn it onto snare or ordinary but when you have it on snare, if
               you play [...] or anything it rattles!
Enid (PS08Y)   [6336] Is it erm, is a snare the thing that co , the sort of
               wire that goes across it?
Mollie (PS091) [6337] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6338] And what does that do?
Mollie (PS091) [6339] Erm, well ... it makes erm ... a lighter so , makes the
               drum sound to a lot of ... lighter sounds.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6340] Oh I see.
Mollie (PS091) [6341] But erm, when you play music and you keep it on snare the
               wires keep rattling.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6342] Ah yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6343] So, you have to erm ... pull this ... erm, little lever
               at the side ... and that ... that'll ... turn the snare bit off
               ... they can play on there ... erm ... there's ... the choir,
               erm
Enid (PS08Y)   [6344] Are you in the choir?
Mollie (PS091) [6345] Erm, no I don't know much about it yet, we haven't ...
               I've only just ... been told about it by a friend who I sit next
               to on the bus.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6346] You've only been there ... I think a ba , a term haven't
               you?
Mollie (PS091) [6347] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6348] So tha , yes.
               [6349] Mhm.
Mollie (PS091) [6350] So we don't know much about it yet, but on Thursdays we
               ... get, we've got taught how to play ... erm ... a keyboard and
               been taught a little bit about reading music.
               [6351] But
Enid (PS08Y)   [6352] Good!
Mollie (PS091) [6353] erm, I can't read it too well cos I've only had about ...
               couple of lessons on it.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6354] Yes.
               [6355] It needs practice doesn't it?
Mollie (PS091) [6356] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6357] Of course, being in the choir it gives you practice
               reading music ... because you just have one line to follow
Mollie (PS091) [6358] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6359] and that's a good start isn't it?
               [6360] Aha
Mollie (PS091) [6361] I have heard erm ... some choir, the choir sing a little
               bit ... cos erm ... we got a corridor near the ... music hall
               ... and erm ... they sing up pretty loud so you can hear it.
               [6362] Cos there's erm ... er ... machine in there ... what you
               can get erm fo food from right, so I go down there sometimes
Enid (PS08Y)   [6363] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6364] get something out the machine and listen to the ... music
               in there.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6365] Nice!
               [6366] Good!
               [6367] I think it's a good school don't you?
Mollie (PS091) [6368] Yeah, it's pretty good ... but erm ... the older ones
               think they run it a bit!
Enid (PS08Y)   [6369] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6370] But, there's, some of them are alright.
               [6371] I got some ... erm ... friends up there who are in fourth
               and fifth year
Enid (PS08Y)   [6372] Mm!
Mollie (PS091) [6373] so and they ... then erm ... I have got ... some friends
               I used to know as ... the little school but they've left now.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6374] Oh!
Mollie (PS091) [6375] Erm, they just went on to their fifth form
Enid (PS08Y)   [6376] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6377] so ... don't see them around much.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6378] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6379] Erm ... I know a boy ... erm ... Rickie who just lives up
               our road
Enid (PS08Y)   [6380] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6381] erm ... ho , I know him so I go and see him sometimes.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6382] That's good!
               [6383] Mhm.
Mollie (PS091) [6384] But I don't see him that much because he go and play
               sports ... on the
Enid (PS08Y)   [6385] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6386] field.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6387] Yes.
               [6388] And then they're just not available to play ... at home
               ... th those
Mollie (PS091) [6389] No.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6390] times.
               [6391] No, that's right.
               [6392] You always find wherever you are that the people who've
               been there a long time ... get sort of erm ... a bit uppity,
               they think that they're
Mollie (PS091) [6393] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6394] the bosses of everything.
               [6395] But of course, one of these days you'll be at the top of
               the school [laughing] won't
Mollie (PS091) [6396] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6397] you [] !
Mollie (PS091) [6398] A lot of erm ... them, cos erm ... we're up, we're in the
               upper sort of thing, we're in the upstairs ... in a form room,
               so when we walk downstairs to erm ... down to a lesson ... they
               come barging up there and pushing out of the way!
Enid (PS08Y)   [6399] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6400] And that's the only trouble about it.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6401] That's not very nice when you're a bit smaller than they
               are.
Mollie (PS091) [6402] No.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6403] Aha.
Mollie (PS091) [6404] Erm ... they ... try and erm ... erm ... sort of push you
               out the way and tell you to get lost!
Enid (PS08Y)   [6405] Yes.
               [6406] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6407] But erm
Enid (PS08Y)   [6408] Well when you're big, that's the thing to remember and
               you won't push
Mollie (PS091) [6409] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6410] the little ones around perhaps
Mollie (PS091) [6411] No.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6412] will you?
Mollie (PS091) [6413] I got to , when I was going to the little school I got
               told [...] the little ones.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6414] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6415] But they erm ... I was used to it, used to it cos erm
Enid (PS08Y)   [6416] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6417] I got a lot of ... little cousins and that
Enid (PS08Y)   [6418] Oh of course, yes!
               [6419] So you know what it's like being small
Mollie (PS091) [6420] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6421] too.
               [6422] And what about all this gardening then?
               [6423] I was very interested when you were talking about
               gardening this morning.
               [6424] Erm
Mollie (PS091) [6425] Well
Enid (PS08Y)   [6426] you don't do any gardening, I suppose at school?
Mollie (PS091) [6427] Erm, no, I wish we could have a garden, sort of thing,
               like we mi , where ... mum used to go and have a garden but it
               don't
Enid (PS08Y)   [6428] Mm mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6429] now.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6430] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6431] Erm
Enid (PS08Y)   [6432] But still, you don't need ... a a garden at school,
               you've got the, really the whole of that garden at home.
Mollie (PS091) [6433] Yeah, so
Enid (PS08Y)   [6434] Because your father can't do much now can he?
Mollie (PS091) [6435] Erm no, he does help me a few things but ... I do all the
               digging for him because he can't bend down too much.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6436] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6437] Erm ... I told him he ought to get erm, one of these ...
               rotovators and a plough underneath
Enid (PS08Y)   [6438] [laughing] Ah ha ha [] !
Mollie (PS091) [6439] but he said it's too much money cos they're
Enid (PS08Y)   [6440] Yes.
               [6441] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6442] a few thousand pound now.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6443] I suppose so!
               [6444] And really and truly you've got to have a very big piece
               of ground to need one of those haven't you?
Mollie (PS091) [6445] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6446] I think you're a very good ... forker and spader really!
Mollie (PS091) [6447] Yeah, ah well ... erm ... when I was younger I used to
               watch dad ... so when he put his seeds out I used to erm get the
               erm ... erm ... erm, spade and sort of keep digging them up,se
               seeds up
Enid (PS08Y)   [laugh]
Mollie (PS091) [6448] so I got, I got to know how to use them by then ... then
               ... then erm ... while I've got older dad got another piece of
               ground what he's given up now
Enid (PS08Y)   [6449] Mhm.
Mollie (PS091) [6450] erm ... he , we used to go up there.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6451] Where was that ... er
Mollie (PS091) [6452] Erm
Enid (PS08Y)   [6453] Ben?
Mollie (PS091) [6454] up our road and ... very first house, number one, he had
               a big bit of garden
Enid (PS08Y)   [6455] Oh I see.
Mollie (PS091) [6456] erm ... but ... after a few months dad gave it up cos it
               was ... erm ... too ... wet and that where weeds could grow
               easily
Enid (PS08Y)   [6457] Ah yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6458] and we keeps erm ... digging it up and ... weeds keep
               growing.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6459] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6460] We had potatoes in there for a time but we had to keep
               hoeing all the weeds out.
*** 12 (Tape 033503) ***
Enid (PS08Y)   [6461] No, and of course the weeds will have a
Mollie (PS091) [6462] Yeah, they [...]
Enid (PS08Y)   [6463] a fine old time won't they?
Mollie (PS091) [6464] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6465] Aha.
               [6466] But your ground, I ... imagine you've kept it fairly cre
               , free of weeds ... for quite a
Mollie (PS091) [6467] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6468] time now?
Mollie (PS091) [6469] Erm ... on our ... some of our small plants ... we don't
               use any erm ... sprays or [...]
Enid (PS08Y)   [6470] No.
Mollie (PS091) [6471] we use erm ... a rake ... or a [...] and we draw across
               the seeds and ... that'll ... ra , bring out the weeds.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6472] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6473] I done that ... on my wheat this afternoon ... erm ...
               but we have to use fertiliser on ours cos
Enid (PS08Y)   [6474] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6475] we don't have to sort of, ain't gotta take really too
               much muck
Enid (PS08Y)   [6476] Mm.
               [6477] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6478] cos we do ... half, we muck erm ... I've grown pretty
               well
Enid (PS08Y)   [6479] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6480] so it gives the plants a boost
Enid (PS08Y)   [6481] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6482] so we don't have too much muck so, and like ... put some
               fertiliser on the other bits.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6483] I see.
               [6484] Because, in fact, you can't put that compost ... on the,
               or that muck on the, when you say muck, do you mean the compost
               that you make with the vegetables?
Mollie (PS091) [6485] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6486] Yes.
               [6487] Erm, you can't put that on till it's really broken down
               can you?
Mollie (PS091) [6488] No.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6489] So it's erm ... you use up probably quite quickly what
               you've got.
Mollie (PS091) [6490] Yes, erm ... all our ... sort of cabbage stalks and ...
               beans stalks go onto ... the muck heap ... to turn into a sort
               of compost, but ... other people they just sort of burn [...] or
               take them away and buy a bag of compost.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6491] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6492] But erm ... bought bags of compost aren't so good ... cos
               if you use all er, stuff you're growing you put erm ... it back
               onto the ground
Enid (PS08Y)   [6493] Mm.
               [6494] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6495] what's come off the ground.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6496] Mm, yes.
               [6497] Yes, it seems reasonable doesn't it, to put it all back?
               [6498] It's all been natural stuff hasn't it?
Mollie (PS091) [6499] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6500] Aha.
               [6501] Which bit of the gardening do you like best?
Mollie (PS091) [6502] Well erm ... the best bit, I like harvesting, I don't
               like ... the digging is alright but it hurt your back so
Enid (PS08Y)   [6503] Yes.
               [6504] You get ... yo wo once you've done a lot you suddenly
Mollie (PS091) [6505] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6506] feel it don't you?
               [6507] But the hoeing is nice and easy
Mollie (PS091) [6508] Yeah, okay.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6509] more or less.
               [6510] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6511] We got erm ... various sorts of hoes.

Mollie (PS091) [6629] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6630] Aha.
Mollie (PS091) [6631] Cos erm ... well if you leave them lying about they'll
               rust easily.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6632] Yes.
               [6633] Now that's quite true.
               [6634] Well you're quite an experienced gardener, it seems to me
               Ben!

Enid (PS08Y)   [6642] Mhm.
Mollie (PS091) [6643] Erm, so it sort of originated in our family.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6644] That's right, a family thing, you hand it down from
               generation to generation
Mollie (PS091) [6645] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6646] don't you?

Enid (PS08Y)   [6670] Aha.
Mollie (PS091) [6671] erm ... when we've dug them up I ... I didn't think they
               looked like carrots until we had
Enid (PS08Y)   [6672] No.
Mollie (PS091) [6673] them.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6674] [laugh] ... That's right they, and they must be a bit
               fiddly to peel mustn't they?
               [6675] To scrape, rather.
Mollie (PS091) [6676] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6677] Instead of a nice long scrape, you've got to go round
               corners haven't you?
Mollie (PS091) [6678] Yeah I keep, when I ... I I always scrape the vegetables
               sometimes but when I do though I keep cutting my fingers!
Enid (PS08Y)   [6679] Ugh, yes, yes!
Mollie (PS091) [6680] So I gave them to dad to do.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6681] Ha!
               [6682] What's the idea of those little carrots?
Mollie (PS091) [6683] I don't know.

               grown them
Enid (PS08Y)   [6685] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6686] so I don't know much about them yet.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6687] Did you like the taste of them?
Mollie (PS091) [6688] Yes they're, they're nice and sweet.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6689] Are they?
               [6690] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6691] Erm ... other carrots, erm they don't grow that well, I
               don't think so anyway.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6692] No.
               [6693] Well there's so many things that get into carrots aren't
               there?
               [6694] There's a wa , a wire worm or something?
Mollie (PS091) [6695] Yes erm
Enid (PS08Y)   [6696] And carrot fly.

Mollie (PS091) [6708] Erm ... so when you sort of dig the ground up you have to
               chuck them out the way.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6709] Yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6710] Cos they'll, they'll work their way back in.

Mollie (PS091) [6717] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6718] [laugh] ... So I don't bother!

Mollie (PS091) [6723] Erm, that will sa , that will stick to them and erm ...
               they will ... that will make them ... feel ill so they

               have erm ... the chimney sweep at ours for ... quite a long time
Enid (PS08Y)   [6730] No.
Mollie (PS091) [6731] and he hadn't got any.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6732] You'll have to get some more soot.
               [6733] You'll have to get him along and you can have some more
               soot.
Mollie (PS091) [6734] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6735] I've forgotten what they used to use so soot especially.
               [6736] My father used it, but I've forgotten what it was.
Noel (PS090)   [6737] Never use it on vegetables, around vegetables [...] to
               stop ... insects creeping too.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6738] Does it?
Noel (PS090)   [6739] It'll stop them from ... crawling across, [...]

Mollie (PS091) [...]
Enid (PS08Y)   [6779] measuring an an ... yes.
Mollie (PS091) [6780] Yes erm ... I'm not looking forward to doing the [...]
               cos they've told me about it and he used to get headaches and
Enid (PS08Y)   [6781] Really?
               [6782] Well I think that you wear masks now don't you, when you
               use it?
Mollie (PS091) [6783] Erm, yes, erm ... if you haven't got a [...] tractor you
               have to, but if you've got [...] you don't have to so much.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6784] I see.
Mollie (PS091) [6785] But erm ... if I, when I go to a farm I don't want [...]
               spray.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6786] No?
               [6787] Well it would, not very good for you would it really,
               because of your
Mollie (PS091) [6788] No.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6789] chest?
Mollie (PS091) [6790] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6791] Yes.
               [6792] Aha.
Mollie (PS091) [6793] Erm ... I don't mind fertiliser, that's okay.
Enid (PS08Y)   [6794] Mm.
Mollie (PS091) [6795] And ... but
*** 14 (Tape 033505) ***
Enid (PS08Y) [6796] What we were talking about, or what I think is interesting
             is ... your experience from your early days in horse shoeing ...
             has stood you in good stead for the revival of interest in driving
             ... erm ... if you'd like to tell us a bit more about that I'd
             love to hear it cos I'm never tired of that.
Ann (PS092)  [6797] Yeah well er ... the shoeing today is ... completely
             different to what it was when I started ... nearly sixty year ago.
             [6798] In them days ... horses were ... they were all working hors
             , driving horses ... you hardly ever see a riding horse.
             [6799] Er ... the ones they did ride were the ones they used to
             drive at erm ah, down the two jars ... but er ... and that was a
             completely different ... way of life then ... to what that is now.
             [6800] Er
Enid (PS08Y) [6801] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [6802] er the horses that are shod today, you see they all ...
             riding horses, no ... very few working horses.
Enid (PS08Y) [6803] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6804] Er ... but now the
Enid (PS08Y) [6805] It's, and that's your hobby isn't it?
Ann (PS092)  [6806] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [6807] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6808] Er ... where before that was ... the horse ... was
             equivalent for a motor today.
Enid (PS08Y) [6809] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6810] So that was a living.
John (PS093) [6811] It did the
Ann (PS092)  [6812] Er
John (PS093) [6813] job of a tractor, it did the
Ann (PS092)  [...]
John (PS093) [6814] job a van ... a lorry
Ann (PS092)  [6815] Lorry.
John (PS093) [6816] a car, everything!
Ann (PS092)  [6817] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [6818] Yes.
John (PS093) [6819] Ah , every form of transport
Ann (PS092)  [6820] Transport.
John (PS093) [6821] when you think about it.
Enid (PS08Y) [6822] Yes.
             [6823] Mhm.
             [6824] And is it
Ann (PS092)  [6825] But now
Enid (PS08Y) [6826] different type of horse that makes it different for
             shodding
Ann (PS092)  [6827] Oh yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [6828] today?
Ann (PS092)  [6829] Oh yeah!
Enid (PS08Y) [6830] Not the question of the same horses doing a different job.
Ann (PS092)  [6831] No, that's a different type of horse er
Enid (PS08Y) [6832] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6833] er, the old fashioned working horses ... er ... practically
             extinct.
Enid (PS08Y) [6834] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6835] And the shires are still there fairly strong, still ... er
             ... some of course has now gone onto the ... rare breeds.
Enid (PS08Y) [6836] Mm!
Ann (PS092)  [6837] Er ... registered you see.
             [6838] Er ... Welsh colts ... and ... things of that nature are
             coming back a bit now, they are ... building up now ... er ... but

John (PS093) [6839] But would I be right in saying that ... the everyday
             working horse, the sort of, general purpose working horse that
             people used years ago, people such as carriers, they would use
             horses which were crossbreeds wouldn't they?
             [6840] Not
Ann (PS092)  [6841] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6842] not a purebred anything.
Ann (PS092)  [6843] Not a pure , no!
John (PS093) [6844] They'd be good old heavy, honest, rough
Ann (PS092)  [6845] Yeah.
             [6846] Yeah, yeah.
John (PS093) [6847] hard working horses.
Ann (PS092)  [6848] That's right.
John (PS093) [6849] Not things of beauty really at all.
Ann (PS092)  [6850] No.
             [6851] No, ooh no, no!
John (PS093) [6852] And you hardly ever see that type now do you?
             [6853] Gypsies
Ann (PS092)  [6854] No.
John (PS093) [6855] have them.
             [6856] You still
Enid (PS08Y) [6857] They were
John (PS093) [6858] see gypsies with that sort.
Enid (PS08Y) [6859] built for strength
John (PS093) [6860] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [6861] for the
Ann (PS092)  [6862] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [6863] jobs.
John (PS093) [6864] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6865] Work.
John (PS093) [6866] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [6867] Were they?
Ann (PS092)  [6868] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6869] Purely for
Ann (PS092)  [6870] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6871] work and hardiness.
Ann (PS092)  [6872] And they're ornaments today, they aren't working horses.
Enid (PS08Y) [6873] That's right.
Ann (PS092)  [6874] You put these horses into hard work today they'd be dead
             within three months!
Enid (PS08Y) [6875] Would they?
Ann (PS092)  [6876] Ooh yes!
             [6877] Yeah!
John (PS093) [6878] Yes, the whole scene has altered.
             [6879] And er, as I say, observing this and watching Hector's work
             and how things have gone on over the years, er as you know,
             there's been a tremendous revival of interest in driving, so many
             people ... have er, restored carts or had new ones built ... and
             erm ... the young farriers who've never had the experience with
             driving horses, they have run into problems with erm, keeping them
             going soundly and overcoming problems which crop up when horses
             are driven on the road a lot.
Ann (PS092)  [6880] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [6881] Mm.
John (PS093) [6882] Would you like to tell us a bit more about that?
Ann (PS092)  [6883] Well, yeah that is, I'm [...] I mean that's a completely
             different ... er er laxing of the, it's completely different.
             [6884] Er ... when you're riding a horse, you see the weight is
             all on the back ... er ... whichever tendency ... do and what we
             call the gait ... er
Enid (PS08Y) [6885] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6886] is the hind legs in the front
Enid (PS08Y) [6887] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6888] they have a tendency to open them ... make them wider apart

Enid (PS08Y) [6889] Oh yes!
Ann (PS092)  [6890] by the backs.
Enid (PS08Y) [6891] G A I T.
John (PS093) [6892] That's right, that kind of gait.
Ann (PS092)  [6893] By the back and swop them you see.
             [6894] Well ... er, with a driving horse that's completely
             opposite because yo ... your vehicle behind the horse ... is
             pushing ... against it
Enid (PS08Y) [6895] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6896] and have a tendency to ... punt the back
Enid (PS08Y) [6897] Really?
Ann (PS092)  [6898] so that pushes the ... legs fo ... closer together, do you
             see?
Enid (PS08Y) [6899] Good heavens!
John (PS093) [6900] They're more likely to [...]
Ann (PS092)  [6901] And then they're more likely to hit, they're more likely to
             hit
John (PS093) [6902] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [6903] the ... front legs with the back legs
Enid (PS08Y) [6904] Really!
Ann (PS092)  [6905] when they're going, especially going down hill.
John (PS093) [6906] And of course, there's a word in the trade for that isn't
             there?
Ann (PS092)  [6907] Yeah.
             [6908] Forging.
Enid (PS08Y) [6909] What is it?
John (PS093) [6910] It's what, now there's a
Enid (PS08Y) [6911] Forging?
John (PS093) [6912] completely
Ann (PS092)  [6913] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6914] different use for the word forging.
Enid (PS08Y) [6915] Now, is it related to forging ahead ... in any way?
             [6916] Oh do , is that where forging ahead comes
John (PS093) [6917] I
Enid (PS08Y) [6918] from?
             [6919] When you're really pushing?
Ann (PS092)  [6920] Yeah, yeah, pushing.
John (PS093) [6921] It might well be.
             [6922] It might
Enid (PS08Y) [6923] Yes.
John (PS093) [6924] well be.
             [6925] I would say the term
Ann (PS092)  [6926] And, and then they can
John (PS093) [6927] forging ahead has come from ... the use of that word in
             relation to horses.
Enid (PS08Y) [6928] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6929] Yes.
John (PS093) [6930] I would say, because that
Ann (PS092)  [6931] Yeah, probably.
John (PS093) [6932] dates back many, many years doesn't
Ann (PS092)  [6933] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6934] it?
Ann (PS092)  [6935] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6936] Yes.
             [6937] Because they
Ann (PS092)  [6938] That's it.
John (PS093) [6939] do do it when they're pushing ahead
Ann (PS092)  [6940] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6941] they, they hit the front foot with the hind one.
Enid (PS08Y) [6942] Good Lord!
John (PS093) [6943] Occasionally you
Ann (PS092)  [6944] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6945] hear them do it
Enid (PS08Y) [6946] Oh!
John (PS093) [6947] when they're driving, it's quite a sharp
Ann (PS092)  [6948] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
John (PS093) [6949] crack you
Ann (PS092)  [6950] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6951] hear.
Enid (PS08Y) [6952] It's amazing!
Ann (PS092)  [6953] Mm.
John (PS093) [6954] Er ... so that's, that's completely different do you see?
             [6955] So the styling of shoeing ... is different.
Enid (PS08Y) [6956] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [6957] Completely different.
John (PS093) [6958] If they do it too much then the farrier's not doing a good
             job
Ann (PS092)  [6959] Job.
John (PS093) [6960] and his job
Enid (PS08Y) [6961] Really?
John (PS093) [6962] is to re-balance the shoe so that er, it just misses
Ann (PS092)  [6963] Miss.
John (PS093) [6964] the front foot as it comes forward.
             [6965] If the
Enid (PS08Y) [6966] Right.
John (PS093) [6967] if the horse is travelling fast on the road he's at the
             trot, I mean it isn't
Enid (PS08Y) [6968] Yes.
John (PS093) [6969] the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on
             the road, they never ever should.
Enid (PS08Y) [6970] No.
John (PS093) [6971] Erm, but at the trot, when th the the legs are moving the
             diagonals are moving so of course the front and the hind foot come
             very close together
Enid (PS08Y) [6972] Ah that's it!
John (PS093) [6973] at one point in the gait
Ann (PS092)  [6974] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6975] and if the
Enid (PS08Y) [6976] Yes.
John (PS093) [6977] shoe is slightly wrongly balanced, or the foot is slightly
             wrongly trimmed, then you get these troubles, you
Ann (PS092)  [6978] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6979] also get what we call, brushing don't you?
Ann (PS092)  [6980] Brushing.
             [6981] When they
John (PS093) [6982] Tell Edith about that.
Ann (PS092)  [6983] when they hit both legs together ... like the hind legs
             when they ... they'll hit each other they'll hit one hind leg
John (PS093) [6984] They really, they
Ann (PS092)  [6985] with other one you see.
John (PS093) [6986] They really
Enid (PS08Y) [6987] Ooh!
John (PS093) [6988] wear
Ann (PS092)  [6989] They give it a [...] .
John (PS093) [6990] a a a sore place
Enid (PS08Y) [6991] Ooh yes!
John (PS093) [6992] on the
Ann (PS092)  [6993] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [6994] Like us banging our ankles like that.
Ann (PS092)  [6995] That's it.
John (PS093) [6996] Yes.
             [6997] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [6998] Yeah.
John (PS093) [6999] They do it on what we call the coronet
Ann (PS092)  [7000] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7001] which is of course the little ... junction between the skin
             and the hair.
Ann (PS092)  [7002] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7003] Ooh!
John (PS093) [7004] Very tender place.
             [7005] It's like the quick of our nail
Enid (PS08Y) [7006] Ooh yes!
John (PS093) [7007] where the
Enid (PS08Y) [7008] I can imagine!
John (PS093) [7009] tissue grows from.
             [7010] And they do
Ann (PS092)  [7011] And on the front
John (PS093) [7012] damage their coronet.
Ann (PS092)  [7013] On the front one they do it on the knee which is the ... er
             ... do you see, which is higher up.
Enid (PS08Y) [7014] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7015] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7016] But the knee comes sort of out
Ann (PS092)  [7017] Out.
Enid (PS08Y) [7018] doesn't it?
             [7019] Er inside
Ann (PS092)  [7020] Yeah.
             [7021] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7022] there's a
Ann (PS092)  [7023] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7024] nobble
Ann (PS092)  [7025] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7026] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7027] on the, yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7028] Yeah, yeah.
John (PS093) [7029] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7030] Yeah so, and that's what they call cutting.
John (PS093) [7031] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7032] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7033] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7034] Really?
John (PS093) [7035] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7036] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7037] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7038] You'd never dream!
             [7039] And so people who go and, usually into horses ... need to
             know all these or else they're going to be very unfair to the
             horse.
Ann (PS092)  [7040] Well er
John (PS093) [7041] They should know about it!
Ann (PS092)  [7042] They should know it.
John (PS093) [7043] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7044] They should know it.
             [7045] But er
John (PS093) [7046] But it , mainly it's the farrier's job to know.
Enid (PS08Y) [7047] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7048] But course, they don't er
John (PS093) [7049] It's his responsibility.
Ann (PS092)  [7050] they don't do enough work to really ... create any problems
             today, do you see what they're to do ... somebody will say ooh
             we'll go out for a ride
Enid (PS08Y) [7051] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7052] they're out, half an hour?
Enid (PS08Y) [7053] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7054] Hey?
             [7055] We'll go out for a drive ... probably out an hour, whereas
             years ago the horse used to come out the stable at seven in the
             morning ... he wouldn't go back till probably five at night.
Enid (PS08Y) [7056] Course!
Ann (PS092)  [7057] Probably later than that!
Enid (PS08Y) [7058] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7059] He'd go ... the driving horses, they'd probably go to
             Wickham market Monday ... do you see, the sale on the Monday ...
             they'd go to Ipswich on the Tuesday ... er ... Wednesday they'd go
             to Bury ... er ... and Ailsworth
Enid (PS08Y) [7060] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [...]
John (PS093) [7061] And they really earned their
Ann (PS092)  [7062] Then they'd go to Norwich.
John (PS093) [7063] keep!
Enid (PS08Y) [7064] Full time job!
John (PS093) [7065] Ooh they worked hard!
Ann (PS092)  [7066] And then they'd go to Norwich on the Saturday.
Enid (PS08Y) [7067] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7068] I mean they'd, they'd, they'd be doing probably ...
             anything up to forty mile a day weren't they?
Enid (PS08Y) [7069] Would be.
             [7070] Yeah.
Ann (PS092)  [7071] Yes.
             [7072] And I mean, that was six days a week!
Enid (PS08Y) [7073] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7074] But now they do ... er ... twenty minutes they think they'd
             have done wonders!
John (PS093) [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y) [7075] Yes.
John (PS093) [7076] [laughing] Or go from pub to pubs
Ann (PS092)  [7077] You know.
John (PS093) [7078] that's about it [] !
Ann (PS092)  [7079] Yeah.
John (PS093) [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y) [7080] And you think of these [...] , for instance Prince
John (PS093) [7081] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7082] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7083] Phillip, who is
John (PS093) [7084] Yeah.
             [7085] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7086] presumably those horses don't do long spells of that sort
Ann (PS092)  [7087] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7088] of driving?
Ann (PS092)  [7089] No.
             [7090] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7091] They'll be exercised in other ways I imagine will they?
Ann (PS092)  [7092] Exercised, yeah, they're exercised, normal exercise during
             the week and then ... when they do these events do you see?
             [7093] But of course, if you go back far enough do you see ... on
             these four in hands were ... were going from town to town weren't
             they?
             [7094] I mean, they were ... they were mail originally weren't
             they?
Enid (PS08Y) [7095] On the stage coaches, yes.
John (PS093) [7096] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7097] Stage coaches
John (PS093) [7098] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7099] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7100] Er ... on the horses ... that's understandable, they can
             start off and probably don't knock theirself ... but there's a
             time they'd done twenty or thirty mile pulling a load.
John (PS093) [7101] They're tired, [...]
Ann (PS092)  [7102] They're tired
John (PS093) [7103] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7104] er, and then they start ... and that's when the trouble
             starts.
Enid (PS08Y) [7105] Just as we do, walking a bit less
John (PS093) [7106] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7107] carefully.
Ann (PS092)  [7108] Yeah.
             [7109] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7110] Yes.
             [7111] Yes, the same
Ann (PS092)  [7112] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7113] thing applies.
Enid (PS08Y) [7114] Mm!
John (PS093) [7115] Exactly!
Enid (PS08Y) [7116] Mm!
John (PS093) [7117] And
Enid (PS08Y) [7118] What about ... er, in those days ... er, possibly a few
             still, when erm ... let's, you said gypsies didn't you?
Ann (PS092)  [7119] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7120] or let's say just erm ... odd tradesmen had ... a horse or
             a pony or whatever it was ... pulling a cart ... round the streets
             with vegetables or with, with er coal
Ann (PS092)  [7121] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7122] or something ... what about the ... amount of ... care they
             would get from a farrier, those horses?
Ann (PS092)  [7123] Well they ... they got reasonable care because, like I
             said, that was, that was the ... the owner knew that er ... that
             was his livelihood then
Enid (PS08Y) [7124] That's the thing I suppose, yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7125] and he treated his horse ... well I mean a lot of these
             horseman, good horseman ... treated the horse better than they did
             the wife!
Enid (PS08Y) [7126] [laughing] I wouldn't be surprised about that [] !
Ann (PS092)  [7127] Ooh yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [7128] Living in the East
Ann (PS092)  [7129] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7130] End, I wouldn't be surprised
Ann (PS092)  [7131] Mm mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7132] at that!
Ann (PS092)  [7133] Oh yes!
             [7134] Er ... and they thought of, I mean they thought the world
             of their ... their animals and ... but
Enid (PS08Y) [7135] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7136] er ... when ... you were in the trade like ... mine ... if
             you didn't do a good job ... the man never come back to you, there
             was a, there was a blacksmith farrier in every village!
Enid (PS08Y) [7137] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7138] Some villages had two
Enid (PS08Y) [7139] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7140] And if you didn't do the job properly you didn't get the
             job and if you didn't get the job you went hungry!
Enid (PS08Y) [7141] Course!
Ann (PS092)  [7142] So that er ... that made you do it properly!
Enid (PS08Y) [7143] Yes.
John (PS093) [7144] Yes, they were a
Ann (PS092)  [7145] And there was no ... there was no ... if you hadn't ...
             earned a shilling ... you'd got nothing to eat had you?
Enid (PS08Y) [7146] That's right.
             [7147] Necessity being a good driver.
John (PS093) [7148] Absolutely!
Ann (PS092)  [7149] Well, yeah!
             [7150] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7151] Erm, Hector often quotes one particular instance which
             illustrates that very well ... er ... a as recently as your time,
             after you were er er shoeing
Ann (PS092)  [7152] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7153] in your own business and everything, er people often say
             what did you used to charge?
             [7154] And it was six and eight pence for a set of shoes on a
Ann (PS092)  [7155] Six and eight pence, yes.
John (PS093) [7156] heavy horse, a land horse ... such as a Suffolk, as most of
             them were, erm ... but ... times were so tight that there was a
             farmer who used to send his horse with his horseman right past
             here and go another mile down the road to, to the next village to
             Kettleborough where there was ano , there were two farriers there
Ann (PS092)  [7157] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7158] and one of them was doing them a halfpenny cheaper!
Enid (PS08Y) [7159] Ooh!
John (PS093) [7160] Six and seven pence halfpenny.
Ann (PS092)  [7161] Halfpenny
John (PS093) [7162] And the farmer thought that it would [...]
Ann (PS092)  [7163] [cough] Payed him to do it.
John (PS093) [7164] to send them an extra mile each way and the extra
Enid (PS08Y) [7165] Really!
John (PS093) [7166] time that took ... to get them shod a halfpenny cheaper!
             [7167] And things were as tight as that!
Enid (PS08Y) [7168] As tight as that?
Ann (PS092)  [7169] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7170] Yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7171] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7172] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7173] Mm.
John (PS093) [7174] So
Enid (PS08Y) [7175] I suppose, now would, could that possibly be called a false
             economy?
             [7176] What was he using up
John (PS093) [7177] It probably was.
Enid (PS08Y) [7178] [...] time?
Ann (PS092)  [7179] Well if that was, I meant ... that would be today
Enid (PS08Y) [7180] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7181] but er ... in them days there was no such thing as ...
             false economy, I'd and I, economy didn't come into it
John (PS093) [7182] No.
Ann (PS092)  [7183] else he'd of ... I mean
John (PS093) [7184] No.
Ann (PS092)  [7185] er
John (PS093) [7186] People didn't set the same ... cost value on time as they
Ann (PS092)  [7187] Time.
Enid (PS08Y) [7188] I was going to say, time
John (PS093) [7189] do now.
Enid (PS08Y) [7190] didn't count in the same
Ann (PS092)  [7191] No and er
John (PS093) [7192] It really didn't seem to
Enid (PS08Y) [7193] No.
John (PS093) [7194] it's very funny that!
Enid (PS08Y) [7195] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7196] If you're ... if you hadn't earned the money well ... you
             didn't go into it in detail and ... get the time and motion study
             man
Enid (PS08Y) [7197] No.
Ann (PS092)  [7198] in to look at the job did you?
             [7199] Just thought
Enid (PS08Y) [7200] That's right.
Ann (PS092)  [7201] well ... we'd better pull ourselves together and see if we
             can put this right!
Enid (PS08Y) [7202] That's right.
Ann (PS092)  [7203] Er ... you never really went into it to see where you had
             lost the money.
Enid (PS08Y) [7204] No.
             [7205] No.
Ann (PS092)  [7206] Er ... but you just grabbed a little harder so that you
             made ends meet
Enid (PS08Y) [7207] That's right.
             [7208] By the result you
Ann (PS092)  [7209] Yeah.
             [7210] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7211] would see that you had to work a bit
Ann (PS092)  [7212] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7213] harder and [...]
Ann (PS092)  [7214] There was no ... no working out to see how you could do
             anything cheaper.
Enid (PS08Y) [7215] No.
             [7216] No.
Ann (PS092)  [7217] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7218] Aha.
John (PS093) [7219] But any economy that was made ... or in the early days of
             Hector's er ... business, I know, was always saving material
             rather than time.
Ann (PS092)  [...]
Enid (PS08Y) [7220] Yes.
John (PS093) [7221] Erm ... and the instinct remains doesn't it?
Ann (PS092)  [7222] Oh yeah!
John (PS093) [7223] Your your instinct is to save
Ann (PS092)  [7224] [...] a bit harder.
John (PS093) [7225] an odd bit of se steel or iron off a bar which the modern
             man would say well there's
Ann (PS092)  [...]
John (PS093) [7226] no point in saving that because by the
Enid (PS08Y) [7227] That's right.
John (PS093) [7228] time you've looked
Ann (PS092)  [7229] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7230] for it and found it when you want it ... er, it would have
             paid you to cut a bit off a new bar.
Enid (PS08Y) [7231] That's it.
             [7232] Time costing as much
John (PS093) [7233] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7234] as it now does.
John (PS093) [7235] Time now
Ann (PS092)  [7236] Yeah, that's right.
John (PS093) [7237] is er, is the main driving thing but ... in your early days
             it was material every time.
Ann (PS092)  [7238] Oh material every time!
John (PS093) [7239] Erm ... tell Edith
Ann (PS092)  [7240] Labour
John (PS093) [7241] about some of the er er oh normal economies that were made,
             like, erm making odd links
Ann (PS092)  [7242] Well, oh well the horse
John (PS093) [7243] into staples and all that sort of thing.
Ann (PS092)  [7244] well the horse shoes you see, we used to ... we used to
             weld ... one and a half ... old horse shoes together in the fire
             ... to make one new one again.
Enid (PS08Y) [7245] Really?
Ann (PS092)  [7246] Ooh yes!
             [7247] They weren't thrown
Enid (PS08Y) [7248] One turned the other way on top
Ann (PS092)  [7249] We
Enid (PS08Y) [7250] of the other?
Ann (PS092)  [7251] used to ... get one shoe and a ... ta , in the middle so
             that, so that cut the ... half new one
Enid (PS08Y) [7252] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7253] turn it over on itself ... then the other one we used to
             half
Enid (PS08Y) [7254] Oh!
Ann (PS092)  [7255] and put the other ... piece in between the two and make a
             sandwich
Enid (PS08Y) [7256] Golly yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7257] so you'd got a piece that shape, half ... new one
Enid (PS08Y) [7258] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7259] and that was all welded together in the fire ... into a
             straight bar
John (PS093) [7260] And then you'd start all over again!
Ann (PS092)  [7261] and then you'd start all over again!
Enid (PS08Y) [7262] Oh I see.
             [7263] You didn't use
John (PS093) [7264] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7265] that as a shoe ... you then
John (PS093) [7266] Re
Enid (PS08Y) [7267] made it an a new
John (PS093) [7268] Re-shape it.
Enid (PS08Y) [7269] piece of metal?
Ann (PS092)  [7270] Yes.
             [7271] And then
John (PS093) [7272] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7273] yeah, and then re ... re-used it to shoe.
Enid (PS08Y) [7274] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7275] Made another shoe out of a
Enid (PS08Y) [7276] That's right
Ann (PS092)  [7277] er
Enid (PS08Y) [7278] yes.
John (PS093) [7279] And that was a genuine economy then.
Ann (PS092)  [7280] Oh yeah!
             [7281] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7282] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7283] Yes.
             [7284] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7285] Er
John (PS093) [7286] Erm
Ann (PS092)  [7287] old cart tyres we used to split them up the middle and made
             shoes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7288] Did you?
Ann (PS092)  [7289] Oh yes!
             [7290] Er
Enid (PS08Y) [7291] Because they were made of the right kind of iron?
Ann (PS092)  [7292] Yeah.
             [7293] Er
John (PS093) [7294] And erm
Ann (PS092)  [7295] [...] you see, we used to ... when old shoes do you see,
             you could only use them ... a certain number of times by ...
             welding them up
Enid (PS08Y) [7296] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7297] er ... after they got so you ... hadn't got no more life in
             them we used to ... weld short bits onto ... [...] .
Enid (PS08Y) [7298] Really?
John (PS093) [laugh]
Ann (PS092)  [7299] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7300] Still all done in the fire.
Ann (PS092)  [7301] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7302] Wired?
Ann (PS092)  [7303] Old chains
John (PS093) [7304] And
Ann (PS092)  [7305] when they wore thin on the end ... and we had to put a new
             link in ... we never threw the two halves of the link away, we
             pointed them and made them into staples.
Enid (PS08Y) [7306] Really?
Ann (PS092)  [7307] Because the middle part of the link wasn't worn you see,
             that was still a good bit of metal in it.
Enid (PS08Y) [7308] Yes, course.
Ann (PS092)  [7309] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7310] Isn't it ... tragic to think how far from that we've moved?
John (PS093) [7311] Yes , it is really.
Ann (PS092)  [7312] Yeah, mm.
John (PS093) [7313] Yes, it's
Enid (PS08Y) [7314] And it's so wasteful u
John (PS093) [7315] it's all throw away
Ann (PS092)  [7316] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7317] now isn't it?
Enid (PS08Y) [7318] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7319] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7320] It seems morally wrong.
Enid (PS08Y) [7321] It hurts us
Ann (PS092)  [7322] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7323] who've known
John (PS093) [7324] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7325] the other thing doesn't it?
John (PS093) [7326] Yes it does!
Ann (PS092)  [7327] Yeah, yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7328] Mm.
John (PS093) [7329] It goes against the grain terribly!
Ann (PS092)  [7330] And I am ... if at five minutes to five, or five minutes to
             leaving off time ... whatever it was ... and you wouldn't say well
             ... we'll get ready to go home ... you had to pick a half a link
             up ... make it into a staple and throw it in the box.
Enid (PS08Y) [7331] Yes.
             [7332] That was ready for next time and you've saved
Ann (PS092)  [7333] That was ready for when ... Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7334] that time.
John (PS093) [7335] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7336] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7337] Yes.
John (PS093) [7338] I forget what it was you used to make old horse rasps into
             because for
Ann (PS092)  [7339] Ooh yes!
John (PS093) [7340] farrier has a, has a file ... with very, very coarse teeth
             on one side
Enid (PS08Y) [7341] That's right.
John (PS093) [7342] and slightly less coarse on the other
Enid (PS08Y) [7343] Yes.
John (PS093) [7344] is used for rasping the the hoof ... erm ... I can't
             remember what you used
Ann (PS092)  [7345] We used to use all sorts of things.
John (PS093) [7346] used the old ones for.
Ann (PS092)  [7347] Hooks, flashers.
John (PS093) [7348] Because that's a special hard ... steel isn't it?
Ann (PS092)  [7349] It's hard steel, now.
John (PS093) [7350] It's not ordinary iron is it?
Ann (PS092)  [7351] They used to use, make them into flashers and hooks for
             hedge cutting and
John (PS093) [7352] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7353] hoes for chopping out sugar
John (PS093) [7354] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7355] beet.
Enid (PS08Y) [7356] Yes, because of course you had all the equipment to shape
             it up anew
Ann (PS092)  [7357] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7358] didn't you?
Ann (PS092)  [7359] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7360] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7361] You could make whatever sort of shape you wanted from it
             [laughing] I should
Ann (PS092)  [7362] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7363] imagine [] .
Ann (PS092)  [7364] Yep!
John (PS093) [...]
Enid (PS08Y) [7365] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7366] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7367] That's an i ,i interesting thing talking about the names of
             the tools too erm ... flashers and hooks, now in other parts
Ann (PS092)  [7368] Now you never hear that.
John (PS093) [7369] of the country you would probably hear them called a
             slasher and a ... what?
Ann (PS092)  [7370] I mean, nearly all people ... think a hook is a hook don't
             do, for hanging
Enid (PS08Y) [7371] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7372] things on?
John (PS093) [7373] Mm.
             [7374] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7375] Well in Suffolk you see, a hook is a thing for cutting the
             hedge.
Enid (PS08Y) [7376] Yes
Ann (PS092)  [7377] A hooker.
Enid (PS08Y) [7378] a a curved scy a sickle type
Ann (PS092)  [7379] A [...] , yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7380] shaped thing.
Ann (PS092)  [7381] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7382] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7383] Or a chopper.
John (PS093) [7384] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7385] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7386] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7387] I see.
             [7388] And you just call that a hook?
Ann (PS092)  [7389] A hook, yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7390] So you di , did you call the thing you were doing hooking
             ... or not?
Ann (PS092)  [7391] What er
Enid (PS08Y) [7392] Wi with hook, would you say
John (PS093) [7393] When you were using it
Enid (PS08Y) [7394] that you were hooking
Ann (PS092)  [7395] No you'd be
Enid (PS08Y) [7396] the hedge or not?
Ann (PS092)  [7397] You'd be hedging.
Enid (PS08Y) [7398] You're hedging.
Ann (PS092)  [7399] Yeah, hedging them.
Enid (PS08Y) [7400] Yes, I see.
Ann (PS092)  [7401] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7402] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7403] Yeah,
Enid (PS08Y) [7404] The tool was a separate name?
Ann (PS092)  [7405] Yeah.
             [7406] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7407] Really?
             [7408] Aha.
Ann (PS092)  [7409] Yeah.
             [7410] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7411] And did you have to repair things, well you probably did,
             er farm instruments, I don't mean the big implements but things
             like their scythes and what
Ann (PS092)  [7412] Oh yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [7413] have you?
Ann (PS092)  [7414] We used to ma , we used to buy the scythe blade and
John (PS093) [7415] Well that was the blacksmith's bread and butter, that kind
             of thing.
Ann (PS092)  [7416] and do all the other ... iron work on it, you see, yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7417] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7418] Oh yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [7419] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7420] Yeah.
             [7421] Hoes and ... things like that were all ... er ... hand
             made.
Enid (PS08Y) [7422] Ha!
Ann (PS092)  [7423] Spuds, dock spuds ... thistle spuds.
John (PS093) [7424] Have you come across a spud?
Enid (PS08Y) [7425] Now how do you spell that, S P A D
John (PS093) [7426] It would be G D.
Enid (PS08Y) [7427] G E.
Ann (PS092)  [7428] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7429] I think it would be S P U D
Ann (PS092)  [7430] D, yeah.
John (PS093) [7431] Yes?
Enid (PS08Y) [7432] Oh just a s
John (PS093) [7433] Yes?
Ann (PS092)  [7434] Spud.
John (PS093) [7435] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7436] Sped?
             [7437] Spud.
John (PS093) [7438] I think so.
             [7439] I think so.
Enid (PS08Y) [7440] Really?
Ann (PS092)  [7441] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7442] Th , it's a dialect word really.
Enid (PS08Y) [7443] Oh not erm, not a spadge Yo er
Ann (PS092)  [7444] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7445] I heard the name spadge when I was [...]
John (PS093) [7446] No, it would be spud wouldn't it?
Ann (PS092)  [7447] No, [...] spud.
Enid (PS08Y) [7448] Really?
Ann (PS092)  [7449] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7450] It's probably in the dialect book, I haven't looked it up.
Ann (PS092)  [7451] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7452] Yes.
John (PS093) [7453] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7454] I'm rather
John (PS093) [7455] And another good old word is the crome, now er that was one
             I came across for the first time when I came into Suffolk, the
             crome.
             [7456] I jolly soon learnt what a crome was, I didn't ask I waited
             to find out. [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y) [7457] [laugh] ... [...] learn a foreign language
John (PS093) [7458] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7459] isn't it?
John (PS093) [7460] Yes.
             [7461] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7462] What, what was that?
Ann (PS092)  [7463] Well a a
John (PS093) [7464] Mm mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7465] crome is a
John (PS093) [7466] He couldn't believe I didn't know what a crome was!
Ann (PS092)  [7467] that's ooh ah
Enid (PS08Y) [laugh]
Ann (PS092)  [7468] well either two or four times ... er ... turned down on a
             long handle ... for pouring ... things ... er ... out of the, I
             mean like, when I used to
John (PS093) [7469] I know what it is now.
Ann (PS092)  [7470] when they used to put er ... the muck on the fields ...
             they used to put so many loads of eight and so many heaps of the
             [...] ... well, when they pulled it out of the [...] room ...
             they'd pulls out the crome.
John (PS093) [7471] Like a fork bent at right angles.
Ann (PS092)  [7472] Angles.
Enid (PS08Y) [7473] Oh!
John (PS093) [7474] It's the ideal thing for that
Enid (PS08Y) [...]
John (PS093) [7475] job
Ann (PS092)  [7476] Yes.
John (PS093) [7477] you see.
Ann (PS092)  [7478] Yes.
John (PS093) [7479] A fork , only ... bent over.
Enid (PS08Y) [7480] I see!
John (PS093) [7481] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7482] And the old
Enid (PS08Y) [7483] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7484] the real old ... gardeners ... and I mean well every house
             had one ... because they used to grow their own vegetables didn't
             they?
Enid (PS08Y) [7485] That's right.
Ann (PS092)  [7486] Well when they dug the garden, after they'd dug it they
             always cromed it down with a crome before they planted anything.
Enid (PS08Y) [7487] Really?
Ann (PS092)  [7488] Used the crome as the rake.
John (PS093) [7489] Aha.
Enid (PS08Y) [7490] Now could that be
John (PS093) [7491] Mm mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7492] the same sort of thing that Noel bought last year when he
             saw one of the men in the village, using it to pull out a lot of
             weed from undergrowth, really
Ann (PS092)  [7493] I expect so.
John (PS093) [7494] I expect so.
Enid (PS08Y) [7495] it's er,i and it's got three prongs ... like that, and
             there's, I think, an arrowhead shape on each prong.
Ann (PS092)  [7496] Ah that'd be the modern ones.
John (PS093) [7497] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7498] Yes, that would be
John (PS093) [7499] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7500] the modern
Ann (PS092)  [7501] The modern one, but er
Enid (PS08Y) [7502] adaptation.
Ann (PS092)  [7503] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7504] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7505] That'd be the modern one.
John (PS093) [7506] Similar principle.
Enid (PS08Y) [7507] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7508] Sim sim
John (PS093) [7509] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7510] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7511] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7512] It is
John (PS093) [7513] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7514] erm, for getting up ... a lot
John (PS093) [7515] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7516] of weed?
John (PS093) [7517] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7518] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7519] The old style crome would be a thing about as wide as that
Ann (PS092)  [7520] Yeah, about ten
Enid (PS08Y) [7521] What about
Ann (PS092)  [7522] ten inches wi and the
Enid (PS08Y) [7523] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7524] [...] would be
John (PS093) [7525] Yes and ... and the [...] would be parallel
Ann (PS092)  [7526] Parallel.
John (PS093) [7527] four times, wouldn't they?
Ann (PS092)  [7528] Four.
John (PS093) [7529] And e , equally distanced.
Ann (PS092)  [7530] Fo for that work.
Enid (PS08Y) [7531] Ah yes!
John (PS093) [7532] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7533] But for ... pulling the muck out of the tumble ... they
             only have two.
Enid (PS08Y) [7534] Oh!
Ann (PS092)  [7535] Two tines.
Enid (PS08Y) [7536] Did they?
Ann (PS092)  [7537] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7538] More like a pitch fork bent at right angles then?
Ann (PS092)  [7539] But bent at right angles.
Enid (PS08Y) [7540] Yes.
John (PS093) [7541] That would be a muck crome?
Ann (PS092)  [7542] That'd be a muck
John (PS093) [7543] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7544] crome.
             [7545] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7546] And was a lot of straw in with that?
Ann (PS092)  [7547] Oh that was all straw, do you
Enid (PS08Y) [7548] Ah!
Ann (PS092)  [7549] see?
Enid (PS08Y) [7550] Because otherwise you couldn't have pulled
Ann (PS092)  [7551] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7552] er, sort of muck without
Ann (PS092)  [7553] No no.
John (PS093) [7554] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7555] straw could you?
Ann (PS092)  [7556] No , no.
John (PS093) [7557] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7558] But straw
Ann (PS092)  [7559] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7560] of course.
Ann (PS092)  [7561] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7562] Mhm.
Ann (PS092)  [7563] Yeah.
             [7564] And the tines on a muck crome are flat, whereas the ones on
             an ordinary one for ... all the work were either round or square.
Enid (PS08Y) [7565] I see.
Ann (PS092)  [7566] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7567] Yes.
John (PS093) [7568] So I came across these things you see when we were first
             married because I used to write out all Hector's bills for him, by
             hand before we had a typewriter
Enid (PS08Y) [7569] Mhm.
John (PS093) [7570] and of , I'd come across these words you see, I'd think
             crome?
             [7571] Crome, what is that?
             [7572] [laughing] You know [] !
Enid (PS08Y) [7573] Yes.
             [7574] Even to spell it
Ann (PS092)  [7575] And gradually the
Enid (PS08Y) [7576] in the first place
John (PS093) [7577] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7578] you needed
John (PS093) [7579] So I had to
Enid (PS08Y) [7580] to know.
John (PS093) [7581] yeah, so I did have to guess a great deal
Enid (PS08Y) [7582] Mm.
John (PS093) [7583] because no good looking in the dictionary for a lot of
             these things.
Enid (PS08Y) [7584] No.
John (PS093) [7585] No, no, no
Ann (PS092)  [7586] Mm.
John (PS093) [7587] no.
Enid (PS08Y) [7588] no.
John (PS093) [7589] No.
             [7590] I assumed that a crome was C R O M E, and I still do!
             [laugh]
Ann (PS092)  [7591] Yes.
John (PS093) [7592] cos I've never come across anything else!
Ann (PS092)  [7593] Well I mean all the, all the ... all the dialect words are
John (PS093) [7594] Phonetic really
Ann (PS092)  [7595] spelt
John (PS093) [7596] aren't they?
             [7597] They have to be!
Ann (PS092)  [7598] They're spelt as you say them.
John (PS093) [7599] They have to be!
Enid (PS08Y) [7600] They are , that's true.
John (PS093) [7601] Mm mm!
             [7602] They are phonetic.
Ann (PS092)  [7603] They're spelt how you say them so they can be spelt ... er
             ... ten different ways in the same village!
John (PS093) [7604] And still be right!
Enid (PS08Y) [7605] That's right, I see.
John (PS093) [7606] Because there's no ... there's no dictionary spelling
Ann (PS092)  [7607] Cos I mean, I'd
John (PS093) [7608] for a lot of them.
Ann (PS092)  [7609] well I I spells how I say it.
John (PS093) [7610] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7611] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7612] Er ... somebody up the road ... er ... hundred yards ...
             would spells how he
John (PS093) [7613] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7614] say it.
John (PS093) [7615] I I used to notice that
Ann (PS092)  [7616] And there's just that little bit of
Enid (PS08Y) [7617] It was phonetic spelling!
John (PS093) [7618] Yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7619] Yeah!
             [7620] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7621] When the cards were, from the ... er, the workshop would
             come in ... which the lads had done their work, I mean, one of
             them, I know dear old Pete, in particular, he'd write for crome, C
             R double O M, because that's how he'd say it.
Enid (PS08Y) [7622] Croom.
John (PS093) [7623] Yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7624] Yeah , croom.
John (PS093) [7625] Yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [7626] Yes.
John (PS093) [7627] But it's still right.
             [7628] Yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [7629] And very often the O, in the Suffolk dialect goes to an ooh
             doesn't it?
John (PS093) [7630] Ooh yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7631] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7632] Yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [7633] Yes.
John (PS093) [7634] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7635] Home.
John (PS093) [7636] Eith either a long ooh, or a sort ooh, like er, like in
Ann (PS092)  [7637] It's as a
John (PS093) [7638] room or [...]
Ann (PS092)  [7639] mostly a short one because
Enid (PS08Y) [7640] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7641] that's a ... lazy language the Suffolk dialect innit?
John (PS093) [7642] I suppose it is in a way.
Enid (PS08Y) [7643] I suppose a lot
Ann (PS092)  [7644] You cu
Enid (PS08Y) [7645] of dialect is.
Ann (PS092)  [7646] cut out this
John (PS093) [7647] Yes ... it is isn't it?
Ann (PS092)  [7648] cut everything short don't you?
Enid (PS08Y) [7649] Yes.
John (PS093) [7650] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7651] Oh yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7652] Yes you do.
John (PS093) [7653] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7654] But it's quite different from the unpleasantly lazy speech
             that you get now, for instance, Lancashire ... i it's
John (PS093) [7655] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7656] not true Lancashire that's spoken up there, it's a lazy ...
             you
John (PS093) [7657] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7658] know up the city [said without the t]
John (PS093) [7659] Yes
Ann (PS092)  [7660] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7661] yes, yes, yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7662] that sort of thing.
             [7663] Nothing like over
John (PS093) [7664] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7665] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7666] here
Ann (PS092)  [7667] No.
Enid (PS08Y) [7668] dialect.
John (PS093) [7669] Yeah, same as the erm ... what you get from the outskirts
             of London, the home counties, I call
Enid (PS08Y) [7670] Yes.
John (PS093) [7671] that ugly too!
Enid (PS08Y) [7672] It is!
John (PS093) [7673] True cockney is a treat to listen to.
Enid (PS08Y) [7674] That's right.
John (PS093) [7675] But there's a lot of adulterated cockney in the home
             counties, I used to hear it a lot in Hertfordshire.
Enid (PS08Y) [7676] Yes.
John (PS093) [7677] Erm, especially in the war because the evacuees of course,
             would come along and of course
Ann (PS092)  [7678] Yes.
John (PS093) [7679] all the local children picked it up, of course they did!
             [7680] [laughing] And we'd all go home talking like them and our
             mothers complained [] !
Enid (PS08Y) [laugh]
John (PS093) [7681] Er, but it was interesting all the same.
             [7682] It was interesting to hear them.
Enid (PS08Y) [7683] Indeed!
John (PS093) [7684] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7685] But that a thousand [...] do you see a ... the dialects are
             going
Enid (PS08Y) [7686] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7687] and they'll soon be gone ... and one thing which annoyed me
             ... er ... a Scotsman ... or a Welshman ... or an Irishman ... can
             go on television ... they'll accept them ... and they can talk
             their
John (PS093) [7688] You mean as a newsreader or a a presenter of programme
Ann (PS092)  [7689] lingo, as a newsreader, as a presenter
John (PS093) [7690] don't you?
Enid (PS08Y) [7691] Exactly!
John (PS093) [7692] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7693] and yet, if anybody go on there with a southern dialect
             they wouldn't ... well they wouldn't have them there!
Enid (PS08Y) [7694] That's true, isn't it?
Ann (PS092)  [7695] Cos they aren't talking the queen's English!
John (PS093) [7696] It's taking a
Enid (PS08Y) [7697] Yes.
John (PS093) [7698] long time for dialects to be accepted but I think ... I
             think that boundary is giving way
Enid (PS08Y) [7699] Well I hope
John (PS093) [7700] frankly.
Enid (PS08Y) [7701] it will universally because
John (PS093) [7702] Mm mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7703] I feel the Scots make a tremendous fuss about their
John (PS093) [7704] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7705] speech and
John (PS093) [7706] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7707] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7708] their traditions!
John (PS093) [7709] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7710] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7711] You never hear on the whole ... the Englishman saying ...
             but I'm English!
John (PS093) [7712] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7713] No.
John (PS093) [7714] No you don't.
             [7715] We're
Enid (PS08Y) [7716] Do you?
John (PS093) [7717] We're too
Ann (PS092)  [7718] No, no.
John (PS093) [7719] self-effacing aren't we?
Ann (PS092)  [7720] And yet they'll a
Enid (PS08Y) [7721] But they
Ann (PS092)  [7722] they'll accept the big proposals
John (PS093) [7723] Mm.
Ann (PS092)  [7724] of television and radio
John (PS093) [7725] Yes!
Enid (PS08Y) [7726] Yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7727] and that [...] .
John (PS093) [7728] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7729] That's right.
Ann (PS092)  [7730] Top jobs for them!

Enid (PS08Y) [7737] That's very true!
John (PS093) [7738] It is extraordinary!
Enid (PS08Y) [7739] It's also true that up in
John (PS093) [7740] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7741] Scotland ... they don't like to hear English accents on
             their television and news.
John (PS093) [7742] Well I never!
Enid (PS08Y) [7743] They much prefer to have their own people.
John (PS093) [7744] Ooh!
Enid (PS08Y) [7745] But how often do we listen to a Scottish accent?
Ann (PS092)  [7746] Scot yeah!
Enid (PS08Y) [7747] And every time a trade unionist comes on.
John (PS093) [7748] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7749] I'm afraid
Ann (PS092)  [7750] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7751] we've got a little phrase, another
Ann (PS092)  [7752] Yeah.

Ann (PS092)  [7754] Yeah.

Ann (PS092)  [7770] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7771] Yes.
             [7772] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7773] So we've been perhaps a little
John (PS093) [7774] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7775] bit erm ... reticent
Ann (PS092)  [7776] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7777] about our dialects.
Ann (PS092)  [7778] Yes.
John (PS093) [7779] Er Yes, yes.
             [7780] I I
Ann (PS092)  [7781] But er
John (PS093) [7782] think it's ... time they
Ann (PS092)  [7783] But I'm not gonna change, if anybody don't, but if they
             can't accept me
John (PS093) [7784] [laughing] No, I don't really think so [] !
Ann (PS092)  [7785] well they must er ... [...]
John (PS093) [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y) [7786] Well er , you can't say that it's hard to understand
             because I'm a Londoner and
Ann (PS092)  [7787] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7788] for a long time I have been
Ann (PS092)  [7789] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7790] and you never say anything that I don't understand, unless
             you were to use a word like crome.
John (PS093) [7791] Well quite
Ann (PS092)  [7792] Oh yeah.
John (PS093) [7793] a word, an
Ann (PS092)  [7794] Yeah
John (PS093) [7795] actual word
Enid (PS08Y) [7796] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7797] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7798] that you've never come across.
Ann (PS092)  [7799] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7800] Mm.
John (PS093) [7801] But after all, once is enough, and once you know, you know
             don't you?
Enid (PS08Y) [7802] Exactly!
John (PS093) [7803] You don't forget.
Enid (PS08Y) [7804] No!
Ann (PS092)  [7805] No.
John (PS093) [7806] Erm
Enid (PS08Y) [7807] You don't.
John (PS093) [7808] No.
             [7809] No I
Ann (PS092)  [7810] That's right.
John (PS093) [7811] I found coming into Suffolk from Hertfordshire I hadn't
             heard the, any East Anglian dialect before at all ... erm ... I
             didn't find it difficult, there were only two cases and I can
             remember thinking ... there were two people ... er, one of whom is
             still alive, er who I had great difficulty in understanding and I
             thought when I can ... follow both of them without any difficulty
             I shall know I really belong.
Enid (PS08Y) [7812] Yes.
John (PS093) [7813] And, it didn't take long with one of them, that was Dennis
Ann (PS092)  [7814] Mm, Dennis .
John (PS093) [7815] and the other one, I don't know whether you knew him, I
             think he lived in Earlsome for a time didn't he?
Ann (PS092)  [7816] No, well Monksome
John (PS093) [7817] Didn't he?
             [7818] Monksome
Ann (PS092)  [7819] Monksome
John (PS093) [7820] Erm, a chap called Ben ... erm
Ann (PS092)  [7821] No, I don't
Enid (PS08Y) [7822] No.
Ann (PS092)  [7823] I expect he was days before
John (PS093) [7824] and my word he was difficult to follow!
Enid (PS08Y) [7825] Was he?
Ann (PS092)  [7826] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7827] Yes.
             [7828] Er ... he spoke fast, that was the problem, most
Enid (PS08Y) [7829] Oh yes!
John (PS093) [7830] Suffolk people don't.
Enid (PS08Y) [7831] No, they don't.
John (PS093) [7832] They give you time to listen and time to think
Enid (PS08Y) [7833] They do.
John (PS093) [7834] but he spoke quickly ... with a very strong accent and that

Enid (PS08Y) [7835] Yes.
John (PS093) [7836] took me a lot of years before I could ... and I was so
             pleased when once I was able to say to you ... I've ... Ben had
             been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we?
Ann (PS092)  [7837] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7838] You and me and him and Joe , was another
Ann (PS092)  [7839] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7840] one ... and we'd had a chat for a long, long time and I
             said to him afterwards, I was able to understand everything he
             said!
Enid (PS08Y) [7841] Wonderful!
John (PS093) [7842] [laughing] I was so pleased [] !
Enid (PS08Y) [7843] [laughing] That's an achievement [] !
John (PS093) [7844] [laughing] Yes [] !
Enid (PS08Y) [laugh]
John (PS093) [laugh]
Enid (PS08Y) [7845] You know one thing that's striking me at this moment ...
             actually, when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you
John (PS093) [7846] Mm mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7847] met ... er, Hector and ... you told me once before you had
             no eyes for anyone else there.
John (PS093) [7848] That's right.
             [7849] Perfectly true!
Enid (PS08Y) [7850] Erm , in these days when ... er, so large a proportion of
             marriages breaks down
John (PS093) [7851] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7852] erm ... it seems to me that ... the marriage that has an
             interest to your occupation, let's say, in the man's hands
John (PS093) [7853] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7854] if you like
John (PS093) [7855] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7856] er, although you've got your own artistic contribution
             which you also ... combine with
John (PS093) [7857] True, yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7858] Hector's work
John (PS093) [7859] That has ... been a great
Enid (PS08Y) [7860] erm
John (PS093) [7861] strength to us.
Enid (PS08Y) [7862] Oh, I think that's a ... a tremendous
John (PS093) [7863] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7864] strength to a marriage!
John (PS093) [7865] Yes.
             [7866] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7867] I feel the same with Noel
John (PS093) [7868] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7869] if there's something really interesting that you have
John (PS093) [7870] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7871] between the two
Ann (PS092)  [7872] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7873] of you
John (PS093) [7874] Yes.
Ann (PS092)  [7875] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7876] erm, you don't give up at the first little hurdle.
John (PS093) [7877] Course you don't!
Ann (PS092)  [7878] No, No.
             [7879] No
John (PS093) [7880] It makes an incredible bond ... doesn't it?
Enid (PS08Y) [7881] Doesn't it?
John (PS093) [7882] Absolutely!
Ann (PS092)  [7883] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7884] I feel that.
John (PS093) [7885] Yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7886] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7887] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7888] Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage.
John (PS093) [7889] Ooh yes!
Ann (PS092)  [7890] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7891] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7892] It really does!
John (PS093) [7893] And I th , I think about a great deal because ... it's a
             very strange, it's a very strange thing to talk about but ... when
             I came to Suffolk, I might have told you this before ... er, I had
             hardly been away from home at all, I was only seventeen when I
             first met him
Enid (PS08Y) [7894] Mm.
John (PS093) [7895] and I had a very sheltered life, I was an only child, I
             hadn't been around much, I hadn't stayed away from home ... erm
             ... and ... I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was
             working at Brandeston Hall ... and erm ... she at that time was
             expecting to get engaged to ... a chappy in the village here who
             was, and still is a friend of Hector's and ours, and ... they
             didn't marry in the finish ... but she at that time wanted me to
             come up to Suffolk to see her ... and to meet this chappy who she
             thought she was going to marry ... and erm ... so, it was ...
             holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well ... why
             not?
             [7896] I'll erm, I'll venture and, and my parents said yes, that
             would be alright and so er ... so I came along and erm ... of
             course, it happened that he was in the ... he was in the forge
             talking to Hector on the first evening I came ... and that was how
             we met.
Enid (PS08Y) [7897] Mm.
John (PS093) [7898] And erm,i it was an extraordinary thing!
             [7899] But ... added to that, I can well remember ... staying at
             Kettleborough Chequers ... erm ... and ... er ... walking along
             ... from Kettleborough to Brandeston erm ... th the very next
             morning after I'd come here ... and I think it was before ... I
             think it was quite likely before we had ... we had actually met, I
             don't know whether it was the first day or the second
Ann (PS092)  [7900] Yeah, [...]
John (PS093) [7901] that we met in in the shop there
Ann (PS092)  [...]
John (PS093) [7902] but ... the strong impression I had is walking over the
             hill from Kettleborough where the gun club now is ... walking down
             into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the
             village nestling in the hollow ... and I can remember feeling a
             ... extraordinarily strong sensation that ... I could easily live
             there
Enid (PS08Y) [7903] Yes.
John (PS093) [7904] I could belong there
Enid (PS08Y) [7905] Yes.
John (PS093) [7906] and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt
             it since!
Enid (PS08Y) [7907] Isn't that wonderful!
John (PS093) [7908] But it, there was something that felt right.
Enid (PS08Y) [7909] I yes, I really believe in that
John (PS093) [7910] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7911] feeling!
             [7912] A sense of belonging.
John (PS093) [7913] Most extraordinary!
Enid (PS08Y) [7914] I belong here.
John (PS093) [7915] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7916] Yes.
John (PS093) [7917] Because I hadn't been around much, I hadn't been away from
             home
Enid (PS08Y) [7918] Really?
John (PS093) [7919] and i it was quite forcible!
Enid (PS08Y) [7920] Yes.
John (PS093) [7921] And er
Enid (PS08Y) [7922] Marvellous!
John (PS093) [7923] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7924] I think if one's receptive to things like that
John (PS093) [7925] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7926] you know, it si , it
John (PS093) [7927] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7928] it strikes you
John (PS093) [7929] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7930] doesn't it?
John (PS093) [7931] Yes
Ann (PS092)  [7932] Mm.
John (PS093) [7933] It does.
Enid (PS08Y) [7934] And er
John (PS093) [7935] There was a rightness about it.
Enid (PS08Y) [7936] And you don't forget it because
John (PS093) [7937] No!
Enid (PS08Y) [7938] you're young enough to be so impressed by it.
John (PS093) [7939] Mhm.
             [7940] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7941] Yes.
             [7942] That's wonderful!
John (PS093) [7943] Yes, there was a rightness about it.
Enid (PS08Y) [7944] Right.
John (PS093) [7945] [laughing] Okay [] .
Ann (PS092)  [7946] Ha.
John (PS093) [7947] Erm ... and er ... I've felt that same ... sense of
             rightness ... at many times ... over these years, this is now our
             ... thirty seventh year?
Ann (PS092)  [7948] Thirty seven, yeah I
John (PS093) [7949] Nineteen
Ann (PS092)  [7950] think so.
John (PS093) [7951] No, thirty eight.
Ann (PS092)  [7952] Thirty eight.
John (PS093) [7953] This is nineteen ninety two.
Ann (PS092)  [7954] Yeah.
John (PS093) [7955] This'll be our thirty eighth year in December.
             [7956] So it's several.
             [7957] Erm ... there have been times doing work which we have ...
             er, worked on together ... different jobs ... when I have thought,
             yes ... this is what I'm here for.
Enid (PS08Y) [7958] Yes.
John (PS093) [7959] Very, very strongly!
Enid (PS08Y) [7960] Yes.
John (PS093) [7961] And never, never more so than, of course, working on the
             sword stand.
Enid (PS08Y) [7962] Yes.
John (PS093) [7963] Never more so than that!
Enid (PS08Y) [7964] That was wonderful
John (PS093) [7965] I thought
Enid (PS08Y) [7966] wasn't it?
John (PS093) [7967] I ... the work I'd done in the past ... the training I've
             had ... the experience I've had with Hector and his work ... that
             was all leading up to that.
Enid (PS08Y) [7968] All coming to it.
John (PS093) [7969] It all came together.
Enid (PS08Y) [7970] Yes.
             [7971] I can quite see that really.
John (PS093) [7972] It all came together.
Enid (PS08Y) [7973] Because
John (PS093) [7974] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7975] that was a whole thing wasn't it?
John (PS093) [7976] It was the culmination.
Enid (PS08Y) [7977] Connection with the
John (PS093) [7978] Yes.
Enid (PS08Y) [7979] city.
John (PS093) [7980] It was!

Enid (PS08Y) [7982] Er
John (PS093) [7983] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7984] the ancientness of the
John (PS093) [7985] Mm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7986] actual
Ann (PS092)  [7987] Yeah.
Enid (PS08Y) [7988] thing
John (PS093) [7989] Mhm.
Enid (PS08Y) [7990] you were copying.
John (PS093) [7991] The significance of what it was for.

John (PS093) [7994] Yes.
             [7995] Everything
