*CAR:	It needs  practice. •212543_212779•
*CAR:	Yes. •212806_212855•
*CAR:	Well, because it's, it's rather a case of the blind leading the  the blind, erm •212855_213466•
*CAR:	I think they're both  separately, but they •213466_213805•
*CAR:	Yes, now you, you played stuff just as difficult as this, and  there's no, no problem, don't do it too quickly though, and, I don't mind if it's not finished next week, or the week after, it's the quality we want, so, so, don't, don't rush it. •213825_215251•
        Just, if I were you I'd just do a little on it, every time you practised, and then put it away. •215322_215774•
*CAR:	Mhm. •215840_215859•
*CAR:	But, what, insist on, on left hand especially the little finger being really firm, so I shall leave you with that, that piece  •215859_216745•
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	and wait excitedly, you know next week. •216801_217152•
*CAR:	Mm. •217229_217235•
*CAR:	How one pages the other six. •217239_217417•
*CAR:	That's it. •217713_217861•
*CAR:	Right. •217861_217877•
*CAR:	 ((cough)) 
*CAR:	Done it separately. •217877_217990•
*CAR:	Oh yes,, then  except miracles. •218015_218331•
*CAR:	No I, no, I mean you really respond very well, that Tchaikovsky was lovely, I understand at the present you can't do as much and admirable as you're still doing. •218331_219442•
*CAR:	Well I have to have something to do by myself. •219524_219831•
*CAR:	Yes, well yes surely make that or otherwise you, if you give up everything. •219831_220144•
*CAR:	Yeah, even if it's only ten minutes a day, at least it's something. •220192_220470•
*CAR:	Oh yes, yes, I think we all need, even, even if, plain, life is full of playing games and the game can help you get through the day sometimes. •220470_221602•
*CAR:	That's right. •222089_222230•
*CAR:	So, right let's hear the right hand. •222252_222859•
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	Yeah, just erm, that was fine, fingering here, erm, why do you put a, put a four on that, I, I would of thought that, that is more sensible, you put  into the next note down, let's try that, er mm  •222889_224257•
