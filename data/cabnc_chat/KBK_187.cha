@Comment:	conversation #187 (Tape 002810)
*CHR:	I didn't show you this David.That's that's what it's about.
*DAV:	The Longman Treasury of Spoken English
*CHR:	And they're simply recording an awful lot of people in conversation.
*DAV:	Oh yes.
*CHR:	Erm and they will keep them in the archives and I suppose transcribe them or something of the sort.
*DAV:	Yes interesting.
*CHR:	Yes, yes it is rather intriguing.They just knocked at the door and said how would you care to take part?
*EVE:	 (        ) just   (        ) stroke.
*DAV:	 (        )  ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Oh yes, and of course when you have it for two days you can't actually guard your language all the time  ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	I don't suppose they really want you to, do they?
*CHR:	No I'm certain they don't.That's the last thing they want.
*EVE:	Hardly ever.What never.Well hardly ever.I'm always criticizing on the B B C and I T V.
*DAV:	About the English?
*CHR:	Oh yes.There's certainly plenty to criticize there, isn't there?
*EVE:	I've got a bee in my bonnet about it.
*CHR:	Isn't it a good job we're perfect, eh? ((laugh)) 
*EVE:	 (        ) And there's the controversy, which I don't approve of controversy and they   (        ) rather roll their tongues around and in and out of words and   (.)  ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Don't you think that's one of the beauties of English though?
*DAV:	The problem is slightly in that
*EVE:	Formidable isn't she.Formidable.
*CHR:	Yes formidable I agree.
*DAV:	But word word pronunciations gets changed just by common usage don't they?
*CHR:	Yes they do.They do indeed.Yes. ((laugh)) 
*EVE:	Peculiar day for the first of June, isn't it?
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	It's National Croquet Day did you remember that?
*EVE:	National Croquet Day?
*DAV:	Mmm.
*EVE:	Is it?
*DAV:	Yes.
*EVE:	Who told you that?
*DAV:	Er I think I learnt that when I went to the meeting of the South East Croquet Federation earlier in the year.
*EVE:	Oh yes, when I was  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes you said David that in fact it was arranged a little late and some clubs didn't manage to fit it into their programme.
*DAV:	Well no.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	We we had an open day last Sunday, or Sunday before, I forget.
*CHR:	Yes yes fair enough but
*DAV:	We could have held it today if we thought
*CHR:	Right.
*EVE:	When was it held?
*DAV:	The open day?You you  (        ) 
*EVE:	No I don't mean how  (        ) 
*DAV:	Oh no.Do you mean the  (.) 
*EVE:	You said you went on the ticket  (.) 
*DAV:	Oh South East Croquet Federation Committee Meeting.Yes.That was in Steven's house I think that was
*DAV:	The other one Caterham the other one
*EVE:	Was that the A G M or
*DAV:	Er   (.) no that was   (        ) A G M.Where David  used to live
*EVE:	Oh really?
*DAV:	who founded the South East Croquet Federation.Yes he moved to France.
*CHR:	Is that David  the designer?
*DAV:	No.
*CHR:	No.
*EVE:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Northern France.But I can't remember the name of the
*EVE:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Oh yes.
*EVE:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	He still is involved with croquet because you see he organizes this week at erm   (        ) later in the year.
*EVE:	Oh yes  (        ) 
*DAV:	Yes, that's right yes.
*EVE:	 (        )  (.) navigation.
*DAV:	Who?
*EVE:	My daughter.
*DAV:	Oh is she?
*EVE:	Oh yes.I'm going down in about a month's time. (        ) 
*BIL:	Italian coast   (.)  (        ) .
*DAV:	Yes.
*EVE:	 (.) David   (        ) not as far as St Tropez where  (        ) 
*DAV:	Horrible aren't they those oil slicks they're dreadful.Have you always lived in this area, Evelyn?
*EVE:	Yes, (        )  (.) home town. (        )  (.) 
*DAV:	Sorry which is your home town?
*EVE:	Bournemouth.
*DAV:	Oh lovely yes I like Bournemouth
*EVE:	 (        )  (.) thank you so much very kind of you.
*DAV:	Pleasure.
*EVE:	Thanks awfully.
*CHR:	Nice to meet you Evelyn.
*EVE:	 (        )  (.) Thank you very much.
*CHR:	Ah.Well you may see me again you never know   ((laugh)) I shall look forward to it.Cheerio.
*DAV:	Funny old thing.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	Not a clue I don't think  (.) 
*CHR:	Really?
*DAV:	Ah   ((laugh)) what she gets out of it I just don't know.Companionship I suppose.
*CHR:	Yes yes.
*DAV:	Shame.Oh well I suppose it's something isn't it?If she gets that out of it.
*CHR:	Yes yes and it's fresh air gentle exercise, isn't it?
*DAV:	Yes yes and it means she does get out and does see other people.
*CHR:	Yes yes indeed.Does she tend to walk down when she goes?
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Oh does she?
*DAV:	She did drive until last year but I would imagine that she's probably no longer safe driving.
*CHR:	Sure
*DAV:	She's had two or three accidents in  (        ) .She's a goodly age, you know.
*CHR:	Yes.Well I really enjoyed that David.
*DAV:	Did you?Good!
*CHR:	Yes, yes.It's a  (.) 
*DAV:	Do you want to come again? (        ) think about it
*CHR:	Yes yes.
*DAV:	You'll need come a good few times and give it three four six months.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	I think the books recommend really most players eighteen months to two years before you can come.
*CHR:	Before you can call yourself a player?
*DAV:	Well before you can start setting up a break.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	I mean that does vary enormously. (.) When you come down from twenty to eight or nine in a season, you know
*CHR:	Golly!
*DAV:	 (        ) I know.I mean he plays a lot of croquet.He only works three days a week anyway because of lot of tournaments  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes yes
*DAV:	I mean he started at roughly about the same time as me.I think he's about five and a half five something like that.
*CHR:	My goodness!Yes.
*DAV:	He's probably even less.He's an amazing player to watch, bordering on breaking down all the time.
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	Some of the shots he pulls off are fantastic.
*CHR:	Really?Yes.
*DAV:	Rather excitable that's the only problem.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	Comes from Barnsley.
*CHR:	Oh yes.What is his name?
*DAV:	Edward .
*CHR:	Ah yes.So how do you think the Eden Park problem is going to be resolved?
*DAV:	What we really need to do is to find some land to play on.I've almost given up on the London Borough of Bromley because the land, the areas that they've offered us have been quite impractical and although we've got, you know, croquet is a cheap sport.No clubs have very much money.I mean we've got something like five or six hundred pounds
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	sitting doing nothing.
*CHR:	But that doesn't go very far, does it?
*DAV:	No.No it doesn't.I did go to   (        ) Park Manor.I might go back there again.
*CHR:	That a good idea.
*DAV:	Because they've got the land, but I just didn't get on.What about the Bromley Cricket Club, Tennis Club, Hockey Club complex?
*CHR:	I honestly don't know David.I genuinely do not know.
*DAV:	I really feel in a borough as big as Bromley, which is the biggest  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes
*DAV:	they must have somewhere where we can play, but erm perhaps I ought to   (.) trouble is that you get fobbed off you know.The Mayor, Mayoress said to me well we'll find you something but
*CHR:	Yes
*DAV:	So you you bandy her name about.People jump about for a bit but then having offered you
*CHR:	Yes yep.They've done what they feel they should be doing
*DAV:	They say well we've offered you three blocks and you've turned them all down and you say well yes but you've offered us blocks not not
*CHR:	Not suitable for the purpose.Yes yes
*DAV:	It's not just the erm the fact the area round you need it's also the location that's involved
*CHR:	Yes indeed.
*DAV:	That was part of the problem.We could have gone back to the   (        ) where we started and then we only paid a couple of hundred pounds a year for the land that they used to keep the grass cut and everything but the problem was really the area.We'd never have been able to build a club up.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	And we we really decided that we would be much better not having all the hassle and just all joining   (        ) or joining another club.
*CHR:	Yes quite quite.
*DAV:	It's much easier just belonging to a club and not having  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes absolutely yes absolutely.
*DAV:	Go there when you want and play and  (.) 
*CHR:	It was very nice being there this afternoon and being able to walk straight on to the lawn.
*DAV:	Yes yes well I think you will find that with most croquet clubs
*CHR:	Really yes yes
*DAV:	I think perhaps the top clubs like   (        ) I don't I've never been there.They are supposed to have the best lawns in the country.
*CHR:	Are they?Yes
*DAV:	Very good membership.They spend a lot of money. (        ) 
*BIL:	In terms of lawns it's the biggest club in the world.
*CHR:	Is it?Yes.
*DAV:	They've got twelve thirteen lawns there.
*CHR:	Gosh!
*DAV:	They haven't got the membership.
*CHR:	Shame.
*DAV:	And of course the upkeep these days is quite high.
*CHR:	Yes indeed.There's a sort of general Dulwich Sports Club ground keeping facility I assume
*DAV:	Yes.
*CHR:	for that ground?Yes.
*DAV:	I think that perhaps, that croquet is a poor relation, but erm to the club itself, I don't know.But I would have thought probably the squash or the bowls strictly probably generate more money
*CHR:	And the ground is more intensively used perhaps for that?
*DAV:	Well that's yes.I think that that that perhaps again one of the problems with croquet.It uses up quite an area doesn't it for er mm
*CHR:	Well is it any more than a tennis court?
*DAV:	Well I suppose a game of tennis doesn't last as long
*CHR:	No it doesn't.You can get several games in  (        ) 
*DAV:	It is possibly no worse than the cricket  (.) 
*CHR:	Sure.
*DAV:	area because they have twenty two players, haven't they?
*CHR:	Yes  (        ) 
*DAV:	Though they are only eleven twelve or thirteen on at any one time.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes I mean if it is possible to provide that huge acreage I mean the space per player or whatever is   ((laugh)) rather less for croquet than for cricket, isn't it?
*DAV:	Yes, except you need a more perfect lawn that's more perfect area
*CHR:	Well there are there are green keepers aren't there?I know a guy who bowls at the Bromley Bowling Club in    (        ) exactly and he told me that they have professional green keepers who look after lots of different greens and they come into them once a week or whatever.
*DAV:	Do they?Well that's interesting because we were wondering who we could get to have a look at our lawns and tell what's wrong with it because they are not very good are they?
*CHR:	No no that one we were playing on certainly wasn't the greenest and grassiest
*DAV:	It's a problem.You will find with a lot of croquet lawns
*CHR:	Is it?Yes yes.
*DAV:	Well you know somewhere like Bromley Bowling Club would have a very good membership.So there's a lot of money coming in they could they could afford to have somebody like that
*CHR:	Absolutely.
*DAV:	looking after their lawns.
*CHR:	Absolutely yes.
*DAV:	And London Borough of Bromley have got a spare bowling green in   (.) I forget the name of the road but it's in the Beckenham area which unless they're doing work to any of the main bowling greens just lies fallow through the summer.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	They obviously keep it cut and keep it up to scratch.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	But they were willing to let us play on it because croquet wouldn't have done any real harm.The money they wanted for us to use it even just a weekend was absolutely ridiculous which to me seems in opposition to the whole idea of the borough.
*CHR:	Quite.
*DAV:	The borough's providing spaces for people to enjoy themselves.
*CHR:	Yes exactly, exactly.
*DAV:	But the problem being now of course that I think in line with most London boroughs there is club which tennis club which has tennis courts on Local Authority land.They actually enter into a lease or tennis agreement with the London Borough  (.) 
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	for a period of five or ten years and lease it off them and then have to maintain it.And of course if you want to use somewhere like the bowling green for bowls or croquet then you've got to pay the going rate.
*CHR:	Yes indeed yes.
*DAV:	But I did feel that perhaps they could have bent the rules a little.
*CHR:	Yes and there are different going rates for different things as there are with property, aren't there?
*DAV:	I would have thought so.But I suppose as a bowling green then you   (.) but he said that we've already cut the    (        )  (.) stick their neck out will they?
*CHR:	No no no no no.They are far too liable to have it chopped off.Or they think they are.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	I must admit that I got fed up with pursuing it and I think it's like banging your head against a brick wall in the end.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	Didn't really have the energy to pursue it.
*CHR:	Yeah.No I don't blame you.If it did say locate to the Bickley area or something like that would you change the name?
*DAV:	Probably.If they did locate then I could get quite a good membership
*CHR:	Yes.Oh yes.
*DAV:	ith croquet you know where the croquet players are and where they live.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes.
*DAV:	And even in quite a wide area   (.) not perhaps the garden croquet players you wouldn't know about the people who play in the back garden but you know the people who play in tournaments.Or people who belong to other clubs.
*CHR:	Yes indeed.Yes   (.) Yes.
*DAV:	It's odd I suppose because I mean I could be much happier to play a lot more if there was a subscription towards croquet.It didn't particularly bother me.
*CHR:	Aha.
*DAV:	I would think one gets a lot out   (        ) membership  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes yes.
