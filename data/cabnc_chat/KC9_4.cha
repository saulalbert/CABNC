*KEI:	 (        ) 
*DIN:	 (        ) I don't know what had happened.Whether she had had a warning or what.But the thing is it's an open plan office and if you're gonna give a girl a warning you don't do it   (        ) office do you?
*GIN:	No.
*DIN:	Not if you've got any sensitivity at all.
*KEI:	Did did did, did somebody do that then?
*DIN:	Well, we don't know what happened.All we know   (        ) twenty past five she threw a wobbly and  (        ) .No she's a nice girl.
*KEI:	Was anybody talking to her?

*KEI:	Oh you, you've got the day off?
*DIN:	I'm off till Tuesday now.Isn't that nice?And Steve  hates my guts.
*GIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*DIN:	He signed my form a month ago and, and so he said to me 
*KEI:	Are you going to   (.) take us down then?
*DIN:	I can't.
*GIN:	Christmas shopping.
*DIN:	I've got Christmas shopping, I'm doing it tomorrow night.I'm taking mummy. (        ) . Steve  who signed my form   (.) so he said to him Darinda's got tomorrow off remember?And he looked at me and he said oh no you haven't.Cos we're a bit overworked and understaffed.
*KEI:	Yeah.
*DIN:	He said oh dear that really puts us in the shit and I said er   (.) well    (        )  ((laugh)) I'm not.And I said to Zoe for god's sake don't tell him I've got Monday off as well.
*KEI:	John, John  at work's got tomorrow off  (        ) .
*DIN:	Oh has he?
*KEI:	 (        ) 
*DIN:	So what did your man say?
*KEI:	I've put a vertebrae out.It was still out when he did it.
*DIN:	Vertebrae?
*KEI:	He said it's   (.) you know it's it's   (.) it's not easily done but he's seen them quite a lot.
*DIN:	Ah!Now what I put out is my discs. (.)  (        ) 
*KEI:	Well he 
*GIN:	Vertebrae is bone and disc is the cartilage between.
*DIN:	 (        ) 
*KEI:	He was worried that it was a disc.And he   (        ) pretty sure it's not the disc.
*GIN:	 (        ) vertebrae then?
*DIN:	What's the worst?
*GIN:	I don't know   (        ) disc I would think.
*DIN:	Well why, why do I, why does  (        ) ?
*GIN:	 (        ) that's your vertebrae.
*KEI:	That's just, that's just   (.) that's just releasing.
*DIN:	Just releasing.
*KEI:	And obviously what he did to me  (        ) 
*DIN:	I'm seeing  (        ) 
*KEI:	Are you really?
*DIN:	 (        ) gentle with me.
*KEI:	What time?
*DIN:	Six.
*KEI:	I'll try and get there  (        ) .
*DIN:	No it's alright.What I'll do I'll leave at five fifteen.Then I'll park my car where you said and I'll sit there till  (        ) 
*KEI:	No.I I I I'll, I'll meet you here.I will be here at quarter to six.
