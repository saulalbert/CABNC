*PS009:	We will move on . 
*PS008:	I 'm allowed to say something pilgrimage of love and the parish knows that too because something that er it 's So the three words that 's come to my mind immediately are go and do And you will recognise them as the words of Jesus They are direct they 're clear they 're simple and most importantly they are words of one syllable . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS008:	But they still have a conscience and they challenge that they Now the the annual assembly has challenged us to engage in what is called integrated trading Personally I prefer to speak about learning together because I think it 's more friendly use er user friendly I think I understand it better and it reminds me that it 's connected with disciple-ship Because I 'm quite sure that the young people this morning everyone would know that the word disciple means . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	Follower is n't it . 
*PS008:	Well you 're all shy are n't you . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	yes . 
*KB0PSUN:	Means a learner . 
*PS008:	Now the word disciple means learner So that we 're all involved disciple-ship is integrally er learning is integral to our disciple-ship And we are involved not just spasmodically or occasionally but continuously And learning together as we 've been reminded more than once than this morning engages us all irrespective of age irrespective of experience it engages everyone and it 's worth emphasising that the quality of learning does not depend upon the size of a congregation And I say that in a right of some statistics that appear in today 's agenda The quality of learning depends upon the measure of our response and of our commitments It involves sharing our gifts with each other freely and generously It means erm learning with each other and learning from each other because none of us knows it all And I think also it means being open open to one another and open with one another And when you put all that together I think we would recognise that there is no single of learning that suits every congregation because congregations differ one from the other And we remind ourselves that the spirit is also infinitely versatile and flexible in its activity But when we consider learning together are a model To use an educational term it 's an active model it 's an active model of model of partnership and of sharing Patterns of Ministry to my mind can be interpreted as patterns of sharing and partnership is active and not fussy Partnership is creative and not rigid Partnership is dynamic and not And then learning together is a model of dynamic encounter or dialogue one with the other And by that I mean that we engage one another in a process We can not all as it already been emphasised by the last speaker we may not all be able to do the same things we have not all got the same gifts or the same responsibilities er within the church but you all have the same responsibilities in this light of God And that implies that our learning together engages us in dynamic encounter dynamic dialogue which also releases some of those energies in various areas of life that would otherwise be sealed or indeed locked And I were to guess that learning together is also a model of rich and diverse possibilities There is no one who can foresee what are the ultimate results Or what is the ultimate outcome of any learning process There is no blueprint that one could lay down but with a on the infinite versatility of God to use and deploy the gifts that we are able to offer to his service The Holy Spirit is also flexible and progressive in operation And therefore in learning together there are rich and diverse possibilities And I would suggest through us learning together is a model of effective evangelism For evangelism at best is a congregation learning together Learning together for the word Learning together for the sacrament Learning together through prayer and worship and all the activities of the church Learning together by entering entering into the experience of one or the other and also engaging the community around the church not superficially but er realistically And it would seem to me that unless this morning 's exercise which has been so rewarding and so profitable unless this morning 's exercise is to dissipate into another piece of feeling and er pleasurable discussion then we ought to take quite seriously the the words of Jesus Go and do And see whether we can no we could put this matter of learning together that every member of of our church high on the agenda Well at the next er elders meeting the next church meeting the next district council .

*PS007:	We 'll move on And read the please six and visions from Viscuss The first one is going to be given a bit more time and then the other five are going to brief And we 'll ask Christian who 's erm an elder . 
*PS007:	Yes right . 
*PS009:	In Garmonchaty to share an experience of their church in terms of using ministry A ministry that we do n't often think of as a ministry Correct sir . 
*PS007:	Er in the introductions I did n't stand up and er introduce myself cos I felt it would steal a few minutes of my er presentation . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS007:	This is re it is my first visit to a My name 's Chris I 'm from the river town urc in just down the road What we 've been embarking on in the er the urc church in Shodden is er budgeting the title of my talk today is budgeting for growth We hear about budgets in all walks of life indeed we saw a red box only a few days ago I 'm afraid I 've only got a little red one . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS007:	This will happen next week So we 've had the most famous budget of all I suppose you could argue that his budget was er a budget for growth but my discussion this morning is apolitical But I 'll make not comment on his budget at all The basic principle of a budget is straightforward it 's to forecast your forecast your expend expenses so they can make plans for the future Big and lit little businesses alike budget for growth It enables them to make most most cost-effective use of their resources So why should n't a church do the same On this approach following a presentation and a discussion led by the Reverend Bill about eighteen months ago And I 've written this paper not to give information and details on how you do budget There are plenty of papers and books and guidance from the urc to help you do that What I 'd like to share with you this morning is how we as a church took that challenge and the experiences we feel we 've received from taking that challenge We have begun to feel the benefit Well how was it at er Shodden Well like any other church we thought we were doing well We were just getting enough money in to do just enough in the church The church was helping the spirit Helping in kind Helping the fellowship What more as a church could we ask for Well maybe they can like any other church was the an or is the Annual Church ge the Annual General Meeting and as John pointed out this morning of course we look at what we 've done in the past The finances the well being of our own flock what we have done But look at the tense it 's what have done It 's a retrospective view That is important we learn from experiences But it 's what we 've done in the past What about the future How many of us actually in our church meeting look forward to what we want to do Where 's the direction of your church Where 's the direction of your fellowship that they can follow Are there any problems that may be looming on the horizon that perhaps you ought to be addressing before they reach the door We need to grow together and enjoy the experience together So what changed us Well the presentation by Bill helped in supporting provided was the We 've heard it all before But not at any time in the context of the church A number of us went to that presentation the minister the church secretary myself and the treasurer at the time and a few of the elders We listened and learned that if the church is to grow it must consider all its resources Reference to that again this morning We must tap that wealth with talent I suppose really we learn by who sent us that evening A sense of purpose a sense of involvement a sense of direction a sense of satisfaction and a sense of achievement We 're beginning to experience all those And I suppose we also experience a sixth sense A sense of humour . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS007:	we 've heard that again this morning And Bill in there used sense of humour to get some of his points over But we 've got all of those talk from any of you If you look closely at that to what depth to what depth do those senses reach in your church Our church has money to spend on on anything fabric fellowship worship mission the list is endless What a delightfulness to choose from But what priority do you sign to it Which one do you choose How much on each of those One of the problems you may be facing in your church is inertia the feeling that we 're doing fine everything 's ticking over But remember the same effort reaps the same reward So we returned from that evening together and were very enthusiastic about what we heard The seed was sown in good soil The treasurer indeed faces the same old . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS007:	task every year to ask church members to give a little bit more to pay the bills What a depressing thing to ask for Just to keep up with inflation Just to keep the wolf from the door Would n't you generate a more positive attitude if you were aligned your increase or the request for an increase through the a an increase in activity in the church itself That is true growth So what did we do Well first of all we told the people at the earliest opportunity we told the church members what we 've learnt told them about our of the advantages and our enthusiasm and commitment to the process We tried the process We selected a single project to just learn how to do it just go through the process simply It took about nine months of planning from start to finish on the one project we did We had a programme on four consecutive Saturdays last October help reach the At not a significant cost It 's a significant step for our fellowship And the benefit is we want to do it again this year that 's great Plus taking keeping it and doing it if you see benefit in that So that was a benefit to people outside and people inside the church We have learnt at getting a number of people into our congregation So that was our first success when we decided that process Forward planning and setting objectives were a good way to focus attention So we set objectives and sub subsequently planned a budget to ensure that it 's successful So what 's the timetable Well I 'll take you back six months The elders were advised in advance that we were going to discuss the future This enabled the eldership to start thinking about what we want to do next year to grow together So in the next elders meeting we used a management technique brainstormers think the say what you think And we gathered all this information we grouped it into those categories admission worship and such like Then later couple of months later when we found that list checked that we understood what the list meant and we presented that list to our church meeting This will ensure that there 's commitment and that the direction is understood for the next year So in that presentation discussions followed and that list of nine things I think it was surprise surprise the church wanted to do all nine Now there 's a challenge So what we did then is we went to do to do fact-finding costs people resources effort and any options that might be open to us And the culmination of the production of some financial information that simply enables you to ensure that you can meet those goals in that coming year if you choose to do so So at the Annual Annual General Meeting it was conducted i very much in the same way as before presenting the previous year 's activities but this time we presented a budget Very similar to the example that Bill provided in his hand outs We listed a our expenditure his forecast we used the forecast based on experience and inflation Some of them are at best guesses But then you foil a new project to your expenditure and say look if you want to do these as indeed you 've expressed then it 's going to cost you so much If you get that agreement there one hopes you get that commitment On a technicality the bu the treasurer can still control it He can measure every clause of what the income is against what the expenditure is so that we have some control to ensure that the church life grows and we do n't stumble So we have true growth What are finally what are the benefits that we 've seen here Well if there 's a commercial activity you could argue that but i in the chu context of the church what have we achieved We have focus we have a direction we maintain the fiscal control we are aware of what we 're doing as a church we have the the members commitment indeed we have their involvement in what we want to do It is future planning it is growth it is commended to you all And I 'd like to leave you with one last statement just enough but just enough is not enough Thank you . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS009:	We 're going to now from first of all I 'll say it in order and then you can come up Jean from South Wales come on Jean Then Russell from East Wales then Henry for North Wales then from West Wales and Becky from Mid-Wales Can you remember your names Your yo . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS009:	Okay Right It 's going to be . 
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS009:	Jean you 've got the floor for ten minutes . 
*KB0PSUN:	Oh . 
*PS009:	Jean . 
*KB0PSUN:	Er I 'm Jean from Merthyr Tydfil and I 'm the secretary on the committee Within the South Wales district the question education can always as well as trying to help and support carry pe I 've worked in junior churches and many more education churches It 's very much concerned with the training and Ministry of Elders and a few weeks ago a part of our programme we held a very successful and lively meeting on the subject of church membership It was initiated by one of our ministers erm who felt it would be useful for churches to share er their procedures for preparation for church membership As he said I know what I do with my congregation but how do others er approach the subject Under the leadership of the Reverend Kenneth this meeting developed into a much wider consideration of the leaning and significance of church membership Does it begin with infant baptism Are all children and me and adults who have been baptised members of the church is not or you 'll be actually encouraged or pressured to misinterpret the membership or should we wait for them to be informed er er to wait for them to to feel the One or two elders confessed that they have not been baptised And others were not sure whether they had So what about them We realise that this is a subject which warrants much consideration as we think about the life and reverence of our churches and look to the future for And we hope that our district will continue to be be aware of ways in in which we may help elders and churches in their ministry . 
*KB0PSUN:	Thank you Russell . 
*PS009:	Russell East Wales district Erm I 'd like to tell you a story about a vision of Ministry in East Wales When I 'm about to tell you a story I thought to myself well stories that Jesus used to tell were parables and when I looked at them in the bible they had a kingdom meaning to them And I thought to myself yes I 'll tell you a story I 'll tell you a story about a place I went .
