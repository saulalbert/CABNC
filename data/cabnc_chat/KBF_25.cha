*BRE:	 and  you know   (.) why?  (.) And he said well I'm pretty sure, but he said fifty, fifty and I said to him, well I said   (.) you know, you think about it   (.) but I'd already, sort of, made up my mind that I wasn't gonna, sort of , next year anyway 
*JEA:	No, no. 
*BRE:	 that  that that is it! 
*JEA:	I mean 
*BRE:	As soon as his  (  )

*BRE:	I said because, you know, I've had enough 
*JEA:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	of us being used over and over! 
*JEA:	Erm   (.) what difference will it make to your life   (.) to have Carla at the secretary. 
*BRE:	I think I'm not   (.) she will then come in and let herself in, I  have to be in at three   
*JEA:	 Of course, yes, yes yes   
*BRE:	o'clock 
*JEA:	Yes. 
*BRE:	and for somebody to let her in, but 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	when she gets   (  ) she's actually in thirteen 
*JEA:	Yes, that's  right. 
*BRE:	 so  she's old enough to have a key. 
*JEA:	Yes   (.) yes. 
*BRE:	Yes, I still would like to be in the house, but   
*JEA:	 Yeah. 
*BRE:	if I'm not 
*JEA:	It's  not disastrous. 
*BRE:	 she's old enough   
*JEA:	That's right. 
*BRE:	to let herself in. 
*JEA:	And you can work locally   (.) pick up jobs locally. 
*BRE:	That's right, you know, and I still  pop in. 
*JEA:	 I mean  by   (.) by the time all that happens then that'll be next October. 
*BRE:	Yes  it's in   
*JEA:	 Well   
*BRE:	October. 
*JEA:	by then I may have sold the house   (.) and, I mean, as soon as I sell the house 
*BRE:	mm. 
*JEA:	You can have a   (.) couple of thousand for a diner. 
*BRE:	Yeah. 
*JEA:	You know   (.) you said that Rob is very good on 
*BRE:	Yes   (.) he is   (.) but the thing is cars at the moment are so cheap 
*JEA:	They are. 
*BRE:	I can pick  them up   
*JEA:	 They are. 
*BRE:	because, I mean   (.) it  it's like anything at the moment  it it   
*JEA:	 Yes. 
*BRE:	it's sold so cheap. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	That erm, made me laugh because he said to his secretary   (.) erm   (.) you know, I I honestly don't think your time is   (  ) she is so down in the mouth. 
*JEA:	And he had,did  didn't you say to him, haven't you got eyes in your head, couldn't you  see how   
*BRE:	 Well   
*JEA:	ill I was! 
*BRE:	still I think it's the fact   (.) erm   (.) you know   (.) y  you're not   (.) she's got a problem on her mind   (.) she's not been well   (.) you're not taking her  serious   
*JEA:	 Mm   mm   
*BRE:	 you  ought to cut the leash a bit  
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	which cos I think 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	and 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	she's obviously, you know, when you think what she does for you, marvellous! 
*JEA:	Mm, mm, mm. 
*BRE:	 Erm    (.) and she said an  also I think she wants to ask you something   (.) and   (.) you know   (.) she asked you before and you've taken no  notice! 
*JEA:	 Mm  mm. 
*BRE:	And   (.) and he said well   (.) do you think I ought to give her, you know, what about two pound a week? 
*JEA:	Ah! 
*BRE:	And she said well look   (.)  all I'm, all I'm   
*JEA:	 Brenda! 
*BRE:	saying is that, all I'm is erm   (.) why don't you erm   (.) ke  don't think of the money because how valuable is she to you? 
*JEA:	Quite   (.) quite. 
*BRE:	And it it really shook him up and she turned round and said   (.) he turned round and said, very valuable. 
*JEA:	Mm, of course. 
*BRE:	And he said well happens, she said what happened if she   (.) walked out   (.) tomorrow?  (.) He said I could never replace her   (.) he said e  nobody is to   (  ) she is   (.) he said I just couldn't, he said I'd   (.) you know, I'd pay what I'd have to 
*JEA:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	he said we'll be realistic 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	he said, you know   (.) fifteen pounds a week, and I said to him   (.) what about the petrol?  (.) I said, you know, it's costing fifteen pound a week in a  , a least and you  you're you're paying ten   (.) and he said, no he said, he said I think that's ample, he said. 
*JEA:	It isn't   (.) because I keep on going down and filling up the metro with ten pounds worth of petrol and I'm not making a   (.) a trip back and forth to work every day. 
*BRE:	Go on, I put that in on Wednesday and I've got to about a quarter of a tank  again. 
*JEA:	 Mm. 
*BRE:	So  it'll be   
*JEA:	 Mm. 
*BRE:	tomorrow   (.)  I put it in  (  ) . 
*JEA:	 And it's an automatic, isn't it?   (.)  They use it up. 
*BRE:	 They use a lot  yeah   (.) the ch  I put it in my   (  ) I mean, I said yesterday to him, we've got the decorators in   (.) and then co  they turned round and said   (.) he is meant to be a businessman and they said   (.) he cannot believe   (.) they've never met tha  such a penny pinching guy 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	in all our  life! 
*JEA:	 Mm    (.) yeah   (.)  yeah. 
*BRE:	 They  come in, he said somebody with a house like this, the money you've got, the cars that   (  ) got 
*JEA:	Mm, mm. 
*BRE:	and he turned round penny pinching, saying that   (.) you know, why has this cost me thirty quid, why can't I   
*JEA:	 Ooh! 
*BRE:	get it for twenty? 
*JEA:	Oh yes, yes   
*BRE:	 They  nearly walked out last week! 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	They just honestly couldn't believe  that   
*JEA:	 Yeah. 
*BRE:	somebody could be  like that. 
*JEA:	 But some people  are appallingly mean   (.) did I tell you about that Ned   being done out of six hundred pounds by an indian doctor and a her husband? 
*BRE:	No. 
*JEA:	He put in a kitchen   (.) and he thought there was something funny about these people   (.) erm   (.) they didn't want to give him money up front for   (.) the fabric, you know, the woods and things and he wasn't asking the full amount anyway   (.) and   (.) he said, you know, a   (.) things are very tight in business and I do not want to run up any more debts   (.) if you will let me have   (.) some of   (  ) cash, some of the cash fo  for the wood   (.) as soon as the wood's delivered I'll come and do the job, it's not as though your money is going to be   (.) tied up in any way   (.) and there was a bit of a face pulling   (.) and saw this woman drop to, sort of, always hovering around   (.) always putting her motty in   (.) and erm   (.) when th  when the job was nearly completed   (.) madam steps forward with the cries of   (.) that isn't quite right and that isn't quite right and Nev was putting hours doing   (.) nit-picking   (.) fussing about getting things   (.) absolutely perfect   (.) got it absolutely perfect but when it came to the final bill   (.) they knocked off six hundred because there was the tiniest little scratch   (.) on one of the panels! 
*BRE:	Oh     (.)  (  )  (.) he couldn't do anything about  it? 
*JEA:	 No  it was fi  it was fixed in. 
*BRE:	Perhaps   (  )  they're fiddling   
*JEA:	 Ah. 
*BRE:	a bit. 
*JEA:	Yes. 
*BRE:	That's one way to put it, anyway   (.) and he said that   (.) and he said he lost out on six  hundred pounds? 
*JEA:	 Six hundred  yes. 
*BRE:	Did he not, sort of, think to take them to court? I suppose it would have cost him more in court fees! 
*JEA:	Well I think he can   (.) go through the small claims court for   (.) five hundred   (.) but I suppose six hundred was just over, it's probably something very crafty that they thought up between them, this pair! 
*BRE:	It's awful isn't it? 
*JEA:	Tis awful   (.) I was taught as a child in catechism   (.) the labourer is worthy of his hire   (.) there are four sins that cry out to heaven for justice   (.) one of them is a oppressing the widow and orphan and the other   (.) is defrauding the labourer of his hire   (.) because the labourer is worthy of his hire   (.) that's a sin that   (.) cries to heaven for justice, that's what I was taught as a child. 
*BRE:	I bet he was really, sort of angry? 
*JEA:	 Oh they  were, they felt sick! 
*BRE:	But the er it's does he still see them or? 
*JEA:	Oh no, I mean the  these were clients and they could never be friends after doing that   (.) I've come to the conclusion you can either keep your money or you can keep your friends, but you're not going to do both. 
*BRE:	No. 
*JEA:	In life. 
*BRE:	Right, shall we make tracks? 
*JEA:	Yep.
