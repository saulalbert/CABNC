*JOH:	 Yeah  which one? 
*JAN:	There's only one in the top ten at the moment  (.)

*JAN:	No I don't want to. (.)  
*JOH:	 ((sigh))  (  ) 
*JAN:	Oh I'm sorry, but there was only that one which is all, it's got her latest stuff on it, I'm not really keen on anything else, it's got those last, you know the sort of her last few records of it, on it I should say   (.) I didn't know there was any others around, when I told you I wanted the Cher one, it was the one that was out now not the old ones. 
*JOH:	 ((shouting)) This one's out now . (.)  
*JAN:	No, what I mean is er the new one sort of thing, the new Cher, it's in the top thirty, it was about number three a month about a month or so ago   (.) I didn't know there was anything  else

*JOH:	Shut up   (.) and since when did you ever listen to me? (.)
