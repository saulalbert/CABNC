Gordon (PS1AA)             [1802] I've never
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1803] That's right.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1804] been in the Leigh Arms in my life.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1805] Go for a pint and a fight!
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1806] [laughing] And you won't go in again I'll
                           tell you [] !
Kevin (PS1AD)              [belch]
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1807] Terrible in there!
                           [1808] It's dreadful!
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1809] I've never been in my life, I wouldn't know.
                           [1810] Haven't you been in either?
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1811] Rough.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1812] It's rough.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1813] You have to have a fight!
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1814] Next to the Bo [...] , palatial.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1815] But you have to have a fight to get in!
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1816] That's right.
                           [1817] It's like the Greyhound.
                           [1818] The Greyhound's shut now at Bartington?
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1819] Yeah.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1820] But th you've got the Temple ... just down
                           the road.
                           [1821] No problem.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1822] Oh yeah.
                           [1823] Well that's a great one innit?
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1824] Just go for a pint and then go for a ... a
                           monster curry.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1825] Yeah.
                           [1826] Yeah.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1827] We'll get a doggy bag for Elaine.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1828] Don't want a doggy bag.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1829] I could put it in a double one.
                           [1830] [cough] [sigh] ... Trying to think what else
                           you'd need to take for ... [...] .
                           [1831] I mean like ... do you take a lot of stuff
                           every time you go to the van?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1832] No.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1833] So you'd get the pram in the boot okay?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1834] Oh aye.
                           [1835] Get th the pram in there alright, yeah.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1836] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1837] I've only gotta take [...] that's all.
                           [1838] Bit of food.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1839] Cos that's [...] when we had to stay wasn't
                           it?
                           [1840] You had a high chair and a pram, the, baby
                           cot
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1841] Oh aye.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [...]
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1842] We don't need it now do we?
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1843] No.
                           [1844] Be good actually if he does sleep in the bed
                           cos then we can go in the summer.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1845] Yeah.
                           [1846] You just let me try it out.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1847] Well I'm just saying, see th it's a shame you
                           can't get something you know to prop up, to, like an
                           L-shaped piece of wood.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1848] I know.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1849] What d'ya call it
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1850] To slip under the bed.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1851] has them.
                           [1852] Carole's got a sa a bed thing.
                           [1853] You know that you clip onto the side of your
                           bed to stop them rolling out.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1854] Really?
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1855] Carole's got one.
                           [1856] She said I can have it.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1857] Really?
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1858] You just reminded me.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1859] Sue had one I think.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1860] Mm.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1861] Yeah.
                           [1862] It's just
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1863] for er
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1864] like a, it's just like a, a piece of mesh int
                           it?
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1865] That's right, yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1866] At the sides, it clips on the side.
                           [1867] It just means if they do roll towards the
                           edge it stops
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1868] Yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1869] the ... I mean, they can get over it ... and
                           they can get
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1870] Yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1871] round it that way and that way, but it just
                           stops them ... in their sleep.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1872] There's something there.
                           [1873] Yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1874] Yeah.
                           [1875] I'll ask her.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1876] Yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1877] Remind me to ... to ask.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1878] Yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1879] Hopefully, I'll get [...] by then.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1880] Mm mm.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1881] So what will you, will you sleep with mother
                           then?
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1882] I don't know.
                           [1883] Oh God [laughing] mother [] !
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1884] Urgh!
Elaine (PS1AG)             [laugh]
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1885] Wurgh!
*** 5 (Tape 071905) ***
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1886] Did you watch that on Hanratty?
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1887] Yeah.
                           [1888] Yeah it was good.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1889] It was good.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1890] I know what i i ... [sigh] ... I suppose it
                           is a good case though.
                           [1891] And close to the end a few people that were
                           hanged a are innocent.
                           [1892] But I think if you did bring back hanging
                           it'd cut out some of these flaming crimes.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1893] I do as well.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1894] You know, I mean, for all the
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1895] Well there should be some
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1896] if
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1897] degrees of it shouldn't there?
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1898] I mean if, if it means that th th there's
                           less, there's less people murdered or whatever then,
                           I know it sounds easy to
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1899] Yeah but if you're one of the innocent ones.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1900] I know, I said that to Kevin, if you're part
                           of the family
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1901] Yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1902] of the innocent
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1903] It's
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1904] one.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1905] very difficult.
                           [1906] It was funny case though Hanratty weren't it?
                           [1907] Because sh I mean she was a eye witness and
                           she picked him out.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1908] I know, but she picked the wrong one out at
                           first.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1909] At first
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1910] So
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1911] yes, but er, you can understand the confusion
                           really.
                           [1912] I don't know really.
                           [1913] I have very mixed feelings about it.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1914] But the whole, the whole case was ridiculous.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1915] I think he was up, er, I mean that Alfons Al
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1916] Alfonso.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1917] Alfonso [clears throat] I think he was the
                           guilty one really.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1918] Aha.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1919] I do.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1920] But like in the statement she said he was erm
                           ... a, original statement she said he was
                           approximately thirty years of age.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1921] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1922] I know.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1923] And then it was changed to twenty five!
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1924] Mm.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1925] Mm.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1926] Things like that.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1927] The battle for him though has been going on
                           for years ... ain't it Gordon?
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1928] I think it's sad that, I mean, even now, his
                           name was cleared and e ... his parents
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1929] It's no good.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1930] wouldn't know, and he wouldn't know and
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1931] Mm.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1932] It's too
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1933] Yeah.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1934] far too late int it?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1935] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1936] Well his brothers are still alive.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1937] Well, yes.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1938] But I don't know really.
                           [1939] It's erm ... difficult to say.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1940] Mm mm.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1941] I thought it was good.
                           [1942] But
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1943] Is that on every week something like that?
                           [1944] Or ... is
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1945] No.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1946] that a one-off?
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1947] No.
                           [1948] They'd obviously
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1949] It's a one-off.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1950] that was just one-off.
                           [1951] That was just one-off.
                           [1952] Well there's murders
Kevin (PS1AD)              [1953] I don't know.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1954] a on, on, on a, on a Monday night now it's a
                           True Crimes ... that have never been solved.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1955] Er with Edward Woodward or something?
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1956] Yes.
                           [1957] Well this week, it's Freddie Mills.
                           [1958] Now he was a very well known boxer when we
                           were ... young, in our teens weren't we Gordon?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1959] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1960] And he was the first ... er, really, er boxer
                           who became a celebrity.
                           [1961] You know, like Henry Cooper is
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1962] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1963] now?
                           [1964] Well he mixed with all the stars ... and of
                           course, I suppose part of the underworld, but er ...
                           they reckon that he didn't kill himself, I mean they
                           did bring it in as suicide but er ... they reckon
                           that ... you know, there's people think he was
                           murdered.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [1965] Oh I see, so
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1966] He was a good boxer weren't he Gordon?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [1967] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [...]
Audrey (PS1A9)             [1968] He really was.

                           [1970] He was pla he, I said go on you can go out.

                           standard.

Kevin (PS1AD)              [2662] They're not.
                           [2663] They're absolutely
Elaine (PS1AG)             [2664] [laughing] I'm sure they'll be pleased to
                           hear him say that [] !
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2665] And all the, all they are er ... they
                           constantly get done up for beating people up in
                           pubs.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [2666] Mm.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2667] They're just dic er er aggressive.

Kevin (PS1AD)              [2669] Very fit, very aggressive.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [2670] Dickheads.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2671] Basically.

                           they talk to them after the game.
                           [2676] They just, they can't construct a sentence.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [laugh]
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2677] It's like their contrast mu contracts must be
                           amazing!
                           [2678] Most probably Xs
Audrey (PS1A9)             [2679] Thick headed.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2680] just Xs at the bottom of the contract.
                           [2681] They can't write.
                           [2682] ... Crazy!
                           [2683] But they do, they get paid a lot of money but
                           only for a short period of time.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [2684] Yeah.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2685] And because they get paid a lot of money
                           they'll put a lot more into it.
                           [2686] I mean there's people my size that are
                           probably faster than our fastest bloke at the club.

                           [2723] They could never win no matter what.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [2724] No.

Kevin (PS1AD)              [2793] I don't often look at what's in the garden.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [2794] I know.
                           [2795] Hopeless!

                           [2805] Right in the middle of the lawn.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2806] Oh aye.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [2807] Did you?
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2808] Big puddles.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [2809] Did you?
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2810] It's very hard round that area.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [2811] But it looks alright because it's a big lawn.
                           [2812] You know, it's
Gordon (PS1AA)             [2813] Terrible condition that lawn.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [2814] I can't stand ours.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [2815] It has, it's got worse
Audrey (PS1A9)             [2816] No grass on ours.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [2817] over the years.
                           [2818] The more I put into it the worse it goes.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2819] I think it does, d'ya, I think like when you
                           scarify it and things like that ... all you do is
                           produce open ground for weeds to grow in.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [2820] Well no, you have to scarify it and then you
                           have to ... you have to carry on the work, you can't
                           sort of do it and then think, ooh I'll leave it for
                           a couple of months.
Kevin (PS1AD)              [2821] Well [...] .

                                     lace over it, it'll tone the lilac down.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3196] Down.

                                     the napkins to match, but she said they
                                     don't come in with the napkins.

Iris (PS1AH)                         [3548] I said, they're just coming down
                                     the road, I said the first thing your
                                     father'll say, has it got a plug on it?
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3549] Yeah.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3550] Cos that's the first thing.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3551] Yeah.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3552] Funny enough, it hadn't got a plug
                                     on it.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3553] It hadn't?
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3554] No!

Iris (PS1AH)                         [3556] Well I, I thought that.
                                     [3557] I said to Lyndsey I'm sure they're
                                     supposed to have plugs on.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3558] I don't think it comes into force
                                     till nineteen ninety three.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3559] Ah!
                                     [3560] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3561] Well, it's bad.

Iris (PS1AH)                         [3565] Yes.

                                     trouble with it, kept breaking down and
                                     it'd go away for three weeks and she'd be
                                     without it
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3573] Yeah.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3574] so she's got two, I think now.
                                     [3575] And, she said the plug that goes
                                     into the ... from the answer machine goes

                                     went wrong.
                                     [3578] So she can't take the plug off.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3579] Tt.
                                     [3580] Oh!
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3581] You cannot take the plug off at
                                     all.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3582] No they're moulded on aren't they?

                                     things ... expensive for people.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3587] Yes.

Iris (PS1AH)                         [3597] had come a bit loose
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3598] Yes.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3599] so all it needed was ... the plug
                                     undoing
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3600] Yeah.

Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3607] It's outrageous what they charge.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3608] You know for people on low incomes,
                                     how can they cope with
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3609] No.

Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3611] They can't.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3612] I mean, seven pounds to have, I
                                     mean they're not gonna probably have an
                                     answer machine, but ... you know for
                                     things ... if things are going to be like
                                     that
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3613] Yeah.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3614] how the hell can they afford it?
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3615] I know.

Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3620] No thanks.

                                     [3623] Yeah.

Iris (PS1AH)                         [3632] But I think that's making things a
                                     bit ridiculous.

                                     [3924] I know what you mean.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3925] And I think, I think they're a bit
                                     pale.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3926] Yeah.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3927] His are always true coloured.
                                     [3928] You can tell what you're wearing
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3929] Yes.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3930] it's the right colour.
                                     [3931] You know.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3932] Yeah.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3933] But er, they're not bad.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3934] They're very, oh!
                                     [3935] They're good.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3936] Well I, yeah, yeah.

                                     [3940] Erm ... dunno
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3941] I've only got to get changed and
                                     ... put some make up on.
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3942] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3943] Are these the cards off her Iris?
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3944] Oh yes.
                                     [3945] Wait a minute.

                                     [3947] Oh yes.
                                     [3948] One from Honolulu, well no, one, I
                                     thought I'd have one from Beverly Hills
                                     ... Hotel actually.
                                     [3949] Erm ... where's that one from?
                                     [3950] Oh that's from New Zealand.
                                     [3951] That's from Margaret and Jim.
                                     [3952] Oh Hawaii.
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3953] Oh my God!
Iris (PS1AH)                         [3954] Hawaii, and they're just on their
                                     way to Pearl Harbour or something.
                                     [3955] That's the other one of New
                                     Zealand.
                                     [3956] New Zealand looks nice.
                                     [3957] Well New Zealand looks like [...]
                                     ... country and
Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3958] Yes.

Audrey (PS1A9)                       [3963] Eh!
                                     [3964] She wants to be careful if the Japs

Audrey (PS1A9) [3972] Yeah, I think you're probably right there.
               [3973] Yes.
               [3974] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA) [3975] Was it between someone running off like that bloke in

Audrey (PS1A9) [3976] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA) [3977] whatever it was?

Audrey (PS1A9) [3979] I know.

Gordon (PS1AA) [3981] I don't like that.
Audrey (PS1A9) [3982] No I don't.
               [3983] I don't.
Gordon (PS1AA) [3984] Yes.
Audrey (PS1A9) [3985] I've noticed that though before.
Gordon (PS1AA) [3986] Have you?
Audrey (PS1A9) [3987] Yeah.
               [3988] Yes I have.
               [3989] Or if anybody is sort of slightly backward
Gordon (PS1AA) [3990] Yes.
Audrey (PS1A9) [3991] portraying someone who's slightly backward.
Gordon (PS1AA) [3992] Or maybe brilliant or a
Audrey (PS1A9) [3993] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA) [3994] erm ... a swot.
Audrey (PS1A9) [3995] Yes.
               [3996] Yeah.
               [3997] I think it's all wrong.
Gordon (PS1AA) [3998] I don't actually, I don't know why they do it because, I
               mean, half the people are listeners int it?
               [3999] I mean it's
Audrey (PS1A9) [4000] Course they do.
Gordon (PS1AA) [4001] blooming horrible!
Audrey (PS1A9) [4002] I think a lot more these days, and a lot that you don't
               know that's wearing contact lenses.
Gordon (PS1AA) [4003] That's right.
               [4004] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9) [4005] I must listen to this.

Audrey (PS1A9)             [4006] Again!
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4007] Yeah but, he said, you know, is that your mum
                           there?
                           [4008] I said, no it's not, and then say the place.
                           [4009] Just on the other side.
                           [4010] Well should have been really ... taking two
                           of her strong tablets she says, you know, and she
                           has [...] .
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4011] Oh dear!
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4012] She thinks it's because she was carrying
                           Gemma.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4013] Oh yes.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4014] Yeah.
                           [4015] On that side.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4016] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4017] It sounds like a [...] .
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4018] Oh dear!
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4019] She went to see chiropractors, you know when
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4020] Yeah.
                           [4021] Oh heck!
                           [4022] And that is bad news!
                           [4023] What, did she mention anything about the
                           card?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4024] No, I didn't.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4025] And didn't you?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4026] No.
                           [4027] ... I'm not having it er ... she didn't do
                           the, when she said to me I want to speak to you
                           about it, she said, you know, she wasn't involving
                           me at all was she?
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4028] No.
                           [4029] I'm thinking of writing myself you know, to
                           Karen.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4030] Oh no you can't do that!
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4031] I, I can.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4032] Because I don't mind if Karen writes and
                           bloody blames us ... that it's our bloody fault, I'm
                           not bothered.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4033] No, I just feel that er
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4034] You don't wanna do that.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4035] I mean we
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4036] It'll upset her that.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4037] she's obviously er very upset, and I, I mean,
                           I just don't want that, she's such a nice girl.
                           [4038] You know, like I really don't ... I, I just
                           thought perhaps a note from me ... you know,
                           apologizing.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4039] Why not, [...] get a note from Karen
                           apologizing for being a, I had the hump.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4040] [sighing] Yeah [] .
                           [4041] I thought, well a note from both of us
                           really.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4042] Well I don't think she, and she, Karen
                           wouldn't want that because ... well it, it's nothing
                           to do with us.
                           [4043] Is it?
                           [4044] We're sticking our er oar in where we
                           shouldn't.
                           [4045] And so the other ... [talking from other
                           room] he's there if you want isn't he?
                           [4046] I mean
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4047] Well I know that.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4048] You can't stick your oar in like that to her
                           at any old time can you, really?
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4049] No.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4050] Well you could have stuck, you know, seven or
                           eight years of age you couldn't even do it then in
                           case it hurt the kid's mother or something like
                           that, or whatever it was.
                           [4051] ... She's nearly an adult.
                           [4052] Well and truly!
                           [4053] Getting an old man now, never mind [...] .
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4054] Well I know that.
                           [4055] I know, but
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4056] Well it's, it's not our, it's not our er,
                           we'll be just sticking our nose in where it's not
                           necessarily wanted.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4057] Yes but it was our mistake in the first
                           place.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4058] Well it wasn't really was it?
                           [4059] Obviously, I mean I know you're arguing with
                           her but er ... but if he'd, if he'd have go if we
                           got a christian name that night it wouldn't have
                           gone down as either of those ... Karen or ... Fran.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4060] I know well we could have found out ... quite
                           easily.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4061] Oh aye.
                           [4062] That's a different story.
                           [4063] Yes.
                           [4064] We could have found out.
                           [4065] We could have phoned Amy and found out there
                           and then virtually, but I think we said oh, I,
                           summat like i i it's not worth bothering about,
                           don't matter just put [...] .
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4066] But it did matter didn't it?
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4067] It did matter but we didn't know that at the
                           time did we?
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4068] Oh no we didn't.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [4069] It'll be worse now, in retrospect, it'll
                           worse ... phoning Amy up at that moment ... and
                           asking what the name was.
                           [4070] And he could have put it down while he was
                           here.
                           [4071] Cos he didn't know the name that night [...]
                           .
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4072] Oh I know he didn't.
                           [4073] I know that.
                           [4074] But the thing was, what I, what I was ge
                           [door bell] getting to last night, is that we didn't
                           bring the name into it, the surname.
                           [4075] ... Get out! [laugh]

                           this it would revert back ... because it has such a
                           sa a strong P H balance in Head and Shoulders it has
                           the same effect as reversing it.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4652] I, I, a hairdresser told me that years ago
                           Elaine.
Elaine (PS1AG)             [4653] She said we would try, had a trial run.
                           [4654] She said we did a ... an experiment and we
                           tried to perm a girl's hair with Head and Shoulders
Audrey (PS1A9)             [4655] Yeah.

                           slightly it just opens up.

                           worried myself but ... I don't know, I think he

Audrey (PS1A9)             [5058] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5059] And I think he's lost weight but I don't like

Audrey (PS1A9)             [5060] I do.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5061] him.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5062] I do.

                           think he has.

                           mean ... erm
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5068] I know that.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5069] he comes home at, at nine o'clock and he, he
                           doesn't have a thing to eat and he goes out playing
                           squash, then he's not eating his main meal till

                           notice of me.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5074] [talking in other room] He hasn't anything to
                           eat [...] time to eat anything.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [5075] No.

Audrey (PS1A9)             [5085] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5086] But there's always somebody wanting him you
                           know, at that shop.
                           [5087] They always seem to ... erm
Gordon (PS1AA)             [5088] [...] ?
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5089] Yes.
                           [5090] No Gordon, they're in the side cupboard
                           there.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [5091] Oh.
                           [5092] That'll do.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5093] In the side cupboard love.
Gordon (PS1AA)             [5094] Yeah.
                           [5095] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5096] He doesn't get a lot of peace.
                           [5097] There's always somebody
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5098] I'm sure.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5099] either on the phone or in the shop, you know.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5100] Mm mm.
                           [5101] I know it's er ... oh I know, I think he
                           works very hard indeed, he just sort of
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5102] He does.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5103] worries me ... that ... he really can't carry
                           on like that.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5104] No.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5105] And I don't know er, what the solution
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5106] No.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5107] is.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5108] Well, it'll perhaps improve when he doesn't
                           have so far to go won't it
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5109] Mm mm.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5110] you know?
                           [5111] Er
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5112] That'll help a great deal.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5113] I think, I don't know if, I'm finding it
                           quite difficult at the moment because he, he's sort
                           of neither one thing nor the other and we're out a
                           lot sort of
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5114] Yes.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5115] doing things er and then we're both going
                           home and, I don't know, it is awkward int it?
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5116] It is.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5117] It's quite stressful [laughing] really [] .
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5118] I'm sure it is Rosie.
                           [5119] Have you got your hu your honeymoon booked up
                           though now?
                           [5120] That's go I'm glad about that.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5121] Yeah.
                           [5122] I've been getting er ... quite worried about
                           that.

Audrey (PS1A9)             [5257] It's because we're at loggerheads, Rosie.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5258] Well I gathered there was some problem.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5259] Eh er i no I really don't know what I've
                           done.

Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5261] No.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5262] I phoned her ... er whe whe when was it
                           Gordon?
                           [5263] Ma in the middle of last year wasn't it?
                           [5264] I didn't
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5265] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5266] receive, not this Christmas, but the
                           Christmas before Rosie, I didn't receive a Christmas
                           card from her
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5267] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5268] which is most unusual
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5269] Mm mm.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5270] and I erm, my brother didn't ... and we said
                           well there must be something wrong.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5271] Yeah.
                           [5272] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5273] So I left it for a while, and I thought I
                           will phone her and find out.
                           [5274] And when I got through I knew immediately by
                           the tone of her voice that she was, there was
                           something wrong.
                           [5275] So I said, I asked her what was the matter
                           and she said well I feel as though er, that you've
                           er, you and Arthur have ignored me.
                           [5276] I said but we haven't!
                           [5277] You know, and er, she said well I feel as
                           though you have.
                           [5278] And she was going on!
                           [5279] So I said oh well, I said er ... if you we
                           really want to get the nitty-gritties I said you
                           know we didn't receive a Christmas card from you I
                           said but we sent them to you.
                           [5280] So she said er, no I know you didn't she said
                           because I didn't send you one.
                           [5281] So I said, oh I said, well, you know if
                           that's how you feel I said, but I will tell you I
                           said I'm now a grandma and I said and er ... Carl is
                           getting married to Rosie.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5282] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5283] And, so she said oh, right.
                           [5284] And I knew that was the end of the
                           conversation.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5285] [laughing] Oh [] !
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5286] So, I, I thought well we will send her a card
                           then she's got er, and invitation [...]
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5287] Oh yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5288] so then she's not going to, she's not got
                           anything to moan about.
Unknown speaker (KBCPSUNK) [5289] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9)             [5290] But I thought the reply was abs I thought it
                           was utterly disgraceful!
                           [5291] And she's done it to spite me Rosie.
                           [5292] And I apologize.

               Conservatives haven't done this, that and the other, he must be
               able to do them now mustn't he?
Audrey (PS1A9) [5882] Who must?
Gordon (PS1AA) [5883] John Smith.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5884] Well erm, they, they don't know whether they can do it or
               not do they?
Gordon (PS1AA) [5885] No, but he's criticizing the Conservative policies and
               all that, and what we will do is this.
Audrey (PS1A9) [whispering] [...] []
Gordon (PS1AA) [5886] I know ... for investment
Audrey (PS1A9) [5887] Yes but they all say that
Gordon (PS1AA) [5888] industry
Audrey (PS1A9) [5889] don't they until they get into power?
Gordon (PS1AA) [5890] I know.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5891] And the and then ... they all
Gordon (PS1AA) [5892] They do.
               [5893] Back down.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5894] They do.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5895] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5896] They'll say they, they probably haven't got the finances
               to back up what they ... what they said they would do.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5897] Yeah but a lo a lot of [...] quotes gonna be made to them
               after aren't there?
               [5898] You know, like you said this and you haven't done it, you
               said that and you haven't done it and all that sort of.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5899] Yes but once they're in power there's nothing you
Gordon (PS1AA) [5900] Well
Audrey (PS1A9) [5901] can do about it.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5902] oh admittedly no.
               [5903] No.
               [5904] But they must feel a bit stupid to er
Audrey (PS1A9) [5905] Well I can't ... well I mean there's an awful lot, I mean
               ... would, no, no matter which political party ... it is, they
               all make promises, but they don't carry them all out.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5906] No.
               [5907] Course not.
               [5908] But I mean these are, these are major things.
               [5909] Getting the economy right.
               [5910] Now John Smith
Audrey (PS1A9) [5911] But er ... well John may have
Gordon (PS1AA) [5912] we'll get the economy right.
               [5913] Now if he doesn't get the economy right he's gonna end up
               with egg on his face and
Audrey (PS1A9) [5914] Of course he is.
               [5915] But you tell me how ... just how is he going to do it?
               [5916] I mean, ee, they don't explain to you how they're going
               to do it do they?
Gordon (PS1AA) [5917] No.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5918] They, they just come out wi a er
Gordon (PS1AA) [5919] With statements.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5920] glibly with these, these statements.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5921] Mm.
               [5922] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5923] I'm sure that e e if there is an easy way of doing it the
               Conservatives would have found out ... and done it.
               [5924] I don't think there's any ... any easy way.
               [5925] I don't see how they're going to do it.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5926] No.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5927] I really don't.
               [5928] ... I mean where are they going, where are they going to
               get the extra money from ... er to pay for the old aged
               pensioners' er ... eight pound rise?
Gordon (PS1AA) [5929] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5930] Or so they say, we'll get eight pound.
               [5931] Somebody's got to pay for it.
               [5932] So it'll be the working people, er, probably the ... the
               national er, health stamp'll have to go, go up.
               [5933] ... It'll be a sorry day if they get in.
               [5934] ... It will Gordon.
               [5935] [laugh] ... Oh!
               [5936] I don't know.

               he was only thirty four and he had a stroke ... and they were
               saying ... he, they er, they were asking him, they said well how
               did it happen?
               [5942] They said, did you have any warning?
               [5943] And he said no.
               [5944] None at all he said.
               [5945] I was gardening ... and he said er er ... I bent over to
               do something and he said I just went dizzy, he said, and I fell
               over ... he said and then I realized my right side was
               paralysed.
               [5946] And he said I was completely confused and ... I couldn't,
               he said I was trying to shout ... my wife ... and erm ... and,
               er, you know my mouth wouldn't work, he said, but she said
               fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and
               they took him to hospital.
               [5947] And they were saying, they were saying that, you know,
               you associate strokes with older people, but there's ... a
               hundred young people a week ... have strokes!
Gordon (PS1AA) [5948] Tt.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5949] Aye.
               [5950] And he said erm ... like it's ... the clots to your
               brains that erm ... that cause it, you know.
               [5951] They said, well did you have any warning about it?
               [5952] And he said er, no, he said I didn't think I had he said,
               but now, he said I realized that how I, was forgetting er ...
               I'd be talking and I'd forget sort of ... what I was just
               talking about that split second.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5953] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5954] And now the stroke has affected him that way.
               [5955] He can be talking, say about a ... well, you know, about
               any er, about sa say a, a video recorder or something like that
Gordon (PS1AA) [5956] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5957] and for a minute he can forget that he's talking about
               it.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5958] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5959] You know, but erm ... he sa he's recovered reasonably
               well in the same, you know, but

               really?
Gordon (PS1AA) [5970] No.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5971] It's terrible!
               [5972] But a hundred young people a week!
               [5973] I mean, I, I couldn't believe it when they were saying
               that.
Gordon (PS1AA) [5974] That's terrible!
Audrey (PS1A9) [5975] It is.
               [5976] ... It's an awful thing.

               you.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5978] What do you mean?

               whatsoever.
Audrey (PS1A9) [5980] Ah well, and Aun I mean Aunty Lilly was like that Gordon.

Audrey (PS1A9) [5990] Oh no!
               [5991] Oh no!
               [5992] It wasn't months Gordon.

Gordon (PS1AA) [6016] Did we, we go to Edith's to see her then did we not?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6017] No, but I went to Park Hospital to see her.
               [6018] Because Edith ... now Edith was going away for some
               unknown reason, I don't know, she must have been going on
               another holiday anyhow.
               [6019] No, she was in Park Hospital a long time.
               [6020] That was it, because ... Edith was going on another
               holiday and she was er, she wanted someone to go and visit ...
               er Lilly, and I said well I'll go.

Gordon (PS1AA) [6080] Soon after that.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6081] Yes.

Gordon (PS1AA) [6083] And you were driving that about.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6084] That's right.
               [6085] That's right.

Audrey (PS1A9) [6088] I did.
               [6089] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6090] Well it's ser te it was later than seventy one you see.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6091] Mm.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6092] And you had that car about two years didn't you?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6093] Oh yes.
               [6094] Perhaps a bit longer.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6095] Two years?
               [6096] Yeah.

Gordon (PS1AA) [6102] [yawning] Yeah [] .
               [6103] Blimey!
               [6104] Do you mean, must be about twenty years ago then?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6105] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6106] Yeah about twenty.
               [6107] ... This is why you know, I, I think you should keep di I
               keep diaries from years ago because ... I know you don't like
               nostalgia, and I don't, but it's interesting
Audrey (PS1A9) [6108] Mm mm.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6109] to look up.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6110] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6111] Er, events.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6112] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6113] I mean I've got no diaries dating back that long.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6114] No, I know.
               [6115] Well I haven't.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6116] I have no record of anything
Audrey (PS1A9) [6117] No.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6118] happening then.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6119] No.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6120] But just one line of things that ... you know, I don't
               mean a diary where you write a page every night, but just two
               lines ... you know.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6121] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6122] All, and what you did and ... when I got the car, the
               date and ... when you got that Triumph then.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6123] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6124] You know, little, just a line.
               [6125] And then when you look at it er ca you can recall then
Audrey (PS1A9) [6126] Oh yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6127] other things.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6128] That's right.
               [6129] The one line sort of sets it all off, you can remember.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6130] That's right.
               [6131] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6132] Mm.
               [6133] Yes but I remember, I can remember Edith phoning me and,
               and saying, you know she was going away, you know is, you know
               could I go down?
               [6134] And I said yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6135] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6136] I, cos I remember coming, coming back, I got lost.
               [6137] You know where er ... that circle is where there's the
               shops, well instead of taking ... I know, instead of taking one
               road I took another and I got completely lost!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6138] Mm.
               [6139] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6140] I wouldn't now, but then I, I, I didn't know er round
               that area.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6141] No that's right really, I mean if you don't know the area
               you don't know which road to take on the islands.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6142] I know.
               [6143] ... But I mean, you wouldn't have thought that Ed er
               Lilly, I mean, she had no weight on her or anything like
Gordon (PS1AA) [6144] No.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6145] that did she?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6146] No.
               [6147] She's always been active all her life.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6148] All, been active all her life.
               [6149] ... No, you can't understand how these things happen.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6150] Well they give you all these bloody tips and papers about
               what to do, to avoid this and avoid that.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6151] And what to eat and everything but
Gordon (PS1AA) [6152] This bloody footballer, I mean it's a
Audrey (PS1A9) [6153] I know!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6154] a really fit man.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6155] I know.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6156] He's, er, one artery was seventy percent blocked, it was
               in the paper.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6157] Yeah.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6158] And the other artery was ninety percent blocked.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6159] Was it really?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6160] Yeah!
               [6161] Yeah!
Audrey (PS1A9) [6162] Good God!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6163] I mean, he could have gone an any time.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6164] Graham Sounness, I mean he's only thirty eight!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6165] Could have gone any time with ... with nothing through
               his bloody arteries!
Audrey (PS1A9) [6166] Good God!
               [6167] But that's incred I didn't know it was that bad.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6168] It was in the paper this morning.
               [6169] And er
Audrey (PS1A9) [6170] Goodness me!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6171] Well he's a, he, he didn't smoke.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6172] No.
               [6173] He was an athlete.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6174] He's been an athlete.
               [6175] He obviously ate like everybody else.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6176] Mm.
               [6177] And he
Gordon (PS1AA) [6178] I mean
Audrey (PS1A9) [6179] wasn't overweight in any way.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6180] Wasn't overweight, what more [...]
Audrey (PS1A9) [6181] No.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6182] the bloody hell do you have to do!
Audrey (PS1A9) [6183] That's incredible that!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6184] See they say it was a ma it's hereditary.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6185] Well
Gordon (PS1AA) [6186] Cos his father had a bypass didn't he?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6187] Oh did he?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6188] I think some other relative died er
Audrey (PS1A9) [6189] Oh.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6190] youngish.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6191] Yes.
               [6192] Oh well ... I bet, I think perhaps it is really.
               [6193] [radio on] ... [break in tape] I know.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6194] It's still going?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6195] I know.
               [6196] Yeah, and you can't, you can't understand it can you
               really?
               [6197] Well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety
               one!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6198] That's right, yeah.
               [6199] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6200] And she does all her own shopping.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6201] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6202] You know, I mean, she keeps stopping but she's, she's
               remarkable!
               [6203] She really is.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6204] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6205] But they're few and far between aren't they?
               [6206] When th you're like that.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6207] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6208] Mm.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6209] But what I couldn't understand with this Soun this fella
               that
Audrey (PS1A9) [6210] This Sounness?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6211] Aye.
               [6212] He, he found out cos he went for, to, for a check up and
               they took his blood pressure.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6213] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6214] And tha well lots of people go and have blood pressure
               taken, they find it's high, and they
Audrey (PS1A9) [6215] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6216] give them tablets.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6217] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6218] Go home.
               [6219] Why did they take it a stage further with him?
               [6220] He'd got high blood pressure, he wasn't in any pain ...
               he's living a normal life.
               [6221] Similar to what I was when I went.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6222] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6223] And they just give me tablets.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6224] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6225] Now why, what made them take it to the stage
Audrey (PS1A9) [6226] Well ... er well, first
Gordon (PS1AA) [6227] where, he wanted a heart bypass?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6228] first and foremost he was in a private scheme.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6229] Well,pro probably that's it then.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6230] Yeah.
               [6231] A and probably because i because of his father and er ...
               the rela the other relative ... having the bypasses done.
               [6232] So they took it
Gordon (PS1AA) [6233] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6234] a step further, but I think probably, it's because he was
               in er ... er a private scheme.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6235] Very likely innit?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6236] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6237] So there's a lot of people walking about with just taking
               bloody tablets who probably really should have a by bypass.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6238] Ah well I, well, [laugh] ... I wouldn't say that really
               Gordon.
               [6239] I mean I think ... er, when your blood pressure was found
               out and you'd been taking tablets ever, so, I think it's kept it
               all under control and you've, you, we eat a sensible diet.
               [6240] The only, the only er ... thing I complained about with
               you is, is the butter.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6241] Mm.
               [6242] I don't have that much now.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6243] But I think everything in moderation, but you don't eat
               as much butter now as what you used to.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6244] I don't eat that much bread you see.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6245] No.
               [6246] So I, I think really, and I think ... what I think with
               him, I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme
               and plus that his own family, it runs in the family.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6247] Mm mm.
               [6248] Must be hell of a shock being told
Audrey (PS1A9) [6249] Oh God!
               [6250] It must have been.
               [6251] ... See how much it's costing?
               [6252] Two hundred and fifty pounds a night!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6253] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6254] Phworgh!
               [6255] That's without the operation.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6256] Yeah.
               [6257] Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year
               then.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6258] Oh I know.
               [6259] And plus he's, he, he, he, he married an heiress you
               know.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6260] Did he?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6261] Er him er,sh they live in Spain now.
               [6262] Oh er he, he's worth a pretty penny is Sounness.
               [6263] He went in Carl's shop the other, the other week.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6264] Did he?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6265] Yes!
               [6266] Mm.
               [6267] Must have been looking for a house.
               [6268] Carl said he, he looked er well er, his face did, it were
               very ... he's got a very poxy skin.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6269] Has he?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6270] You kno mm.
               [6271] Yes.
               [6272] ... He was having it done this afternoon weren't he?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6273] Yeah.
               [6274] Some time today.
               [6275] Aye.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6276] I tell you what, that's quick int it though Gordon?
               [6277] With only going in last night and
Gordon (PS1AA) [6278] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6279] having it done today.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6280] It is indeed.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6281] We I wonder how quick they would have got him in though
               if he wouldn't have been in a private scheme.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6282] He could wait six months couldn't he?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6283] Well he could have been dead by then.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6284] Well er, yeah,e exactly that's what they're moaning about
               int it?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6285] Terrible!
Gordon (PS1AA) [6286] Put them on a list and wait.
               [6287] ... I've never heard so much talk about health ... as we
               do nowadays.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6288] Oh I know.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6289] When I was young I co I don't remember talking all the
               time about bloody ... health and ... what you should do and what
               you shouldn't do.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6290] No I know.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6291] Did you?
Audrey (PS1A9) [6292] No.
               [6293] But we weren't educated in, in, in health though.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6294] We just li we just lived and that was the end of it.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6295] Yes but then you see, in the ol in the old days Gordon, I
               mean, you we you were very fortunate if you got three meals a
               day ... and i and whatever you got you were glad of ... and used
               to eat it all.
               [6296] Now ... we're much more affluent ... and people are
               educated we er
Gordon (PS1AA) [6297] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6298] as regards their health.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6299] Mhm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6300] Well th having said that Gordon, your mother lived to a
               good old age, and my mum, and my father did.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6301] Yeah.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6302] And [laughing] they ate all the wrong stuff didn't they
               [] ?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6303] According to wha according to what they say now they did.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6304] Mm.
               [6305] I know.
               [6306] ... Don't know who to believe really.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6307] When you look at, when you look at the ... some, all
               these, a lot of these composers and artists who died long ago
               ... and you look the birth range ... there's a hell of a lot at
               seventy five, seventy six
Audrey (PS1A9) [6308] Yes.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6309] a oh there's a few at forty odd.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6310] Mm.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6311] But there's a hell of a lot ... well into their
               seventies.
               [6312] You know, and they were born early eighteen hundreds.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6313] Yes.
               [6314] Yes.
               [6315] Yeah.
               [6316] I know.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6317] I know we're living longer now generally but ... I wonder
               how much
Audrey (PS1A9) [6318] I don't know I
Gordon (PS1AA) [6319] I wonder
Audrey (PS1A9) [6320] you know
Gordon (PS1AA) [6321] how much, how much, I don't really know.
               [6322] Cos there's more people now than there was in those days.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6323] Yeah, there's a lot more people.
               [6324] ... It's not anyhow, I mean, it's alright living longer
               if you, if you, if you've got all your faculties.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6325] Mm.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6326] And you've got good health and everything.
               [6327] It's no use living like a cabbage, I don't think so
               anyhow.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6328] No, that's
Audrey (PS1A9) [6329] And when I see these people in nursing homes all sat
               round a wall in chairs ... oh God!
               [6330] I'd hate to end up like that.
Gordon (PS1AA) [6331] Somebody's [...] .
Audrey (PS1A9) [6332] Pardon?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6333] Left the gate open.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6334] Did you?
               [6335] ... I wonder who's that?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6336] I'll check.
               [6337] Has a leaflet come through.
Audrey (PS1A9) [6338] Yes.
               [6339] I bet there has.
               [6340] Tell you what, the Conservative candidate's not been
               round has he?
Gordon (PS1AA) [6341] No he daren't.
Audrey (PS1A9) [laugh]
