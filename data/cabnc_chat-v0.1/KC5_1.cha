*ALI:	When she comes in keep this out right? •105967_106156•
*GAI:	Yeah. •106156_106163•
*ALI:	And when she comes in, what's that one, put her left foot on it, right? •106179_106510•
*GAI:	Yeah. •106662_106673•
*ALI:	And if, if her foot overlaps it all, take them back, cos you might be better off just getting two anyway •106673_107236•
*GAI:	Yeah. •107348_107381•
*ALI:	cos Scott's, Scott's in a two football boot, there  sort of thing innit? •107381_107713•

*ALI:	She's gonna wear her thick socks with them,dangling  aren't they? •107719_107993•
*GAI:	Yeah. •107993_108004•
*ALI:	That's what I'd be inclined to do   so •108009_108605•
*GAI:	 (        ) 
*ALI:	on top of the telly, and say just put your foot on here a minute, now, they look quite thin now, but, that's what I was looking at, yeah, cos her feet are fat, yeah, but they, that do like that don't they? •108737_109808•

        Try her foot on it and if it don't, if her foot overlaps •111399_111584•
*GAI:	Yeah. •111584_111590•
*ALI:	then take them back up and get a two. •111590_111797•
        Cos the thing is as well, I might be inclined to get a two anyway, because she wants it to last a little while don't she? •111797_112194•
*GAI:	Anyway , yeah. •112194_112227•
*ALI:	They're not gonna last very long not a  like that is it? •112245_114334•
        Is that how it was? •114334_114394•

*GAI:	Yeah.. •115523_115532•
*ALI:	If erm •116865_116892•
*GAI:	Go on. •116892_116983•
*ALI:	if her foot's wide, wider than that would it matter? •117005_117251•
*GAI:	Well yeah, cos it ought to be tight on her, across. •117359_117642•
*ALI:	But if her foot's wider, you'll get the bigger size it'll take it up on the length bit. •117642_118120•
*GAI:	Yeah. •118150_118170•
*ALI:	So I'd be more inclined, let me have a look at her when she comes in, send her up. •118301_118626•
