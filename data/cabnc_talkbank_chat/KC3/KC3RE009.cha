*PS0AF:	Sorry I ca n't really sort of say I must admit I could n't really see why they should be like that really cos I mean it is a bit puzzling cos if they 've only just done anything they 've only been tampering with this finger so .  384975_395175

*PS0AF:	Mm .  428455_428515
*PS0A8:	she is one wanting er referrals from Mr so she 's not going to say oh well you know there 's something wrong there you know .  429085_436070
