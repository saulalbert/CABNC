               [277] How much were these Gail?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [278] Sixteen ninety five.
Alison (PS0AL) [279] They're alright ... They look alright.
Gail (PS0AJ)   [280] Alright, aren't they?
Alison (PS0AL) [281] Yeah. [...] .
Gail (PS0AJ)   [282] Not really.
Alison (PS0AL) [283] [...] the same.
Gail (PS0AJ)   [284] If I put hers [...]
Alison (PS0AL) [285] Tell you how to do, see, right Gail?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [286] It's an hour [...] .
Alison (PS0AL) [287] Put her foot on it when she comes in [...] , that's her
               school bus, bus thirteen, do they fit her?
               [288] Do they fit her?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [289] Yeah ... only just, that's [...] .
Alison (PS0AL) [290] When she comes in keep this out right?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [291] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [292] And when she comes in, what's that one, put her left foot
               on it, right?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [293] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [294] And if, if her foot overlaps it all, take them back, cos
               you might be better off just getting two anyway
Gail (PS0AJ)   [295] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [296] cos Scott's, Scott's in a two football boot, there [...]
               sort of thing innit?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [297] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [298] She's gonna wear her thick socks with them, [...] dangling
               [...] aren't they?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [299] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [300] That's what I'd be inclined to do ... [...] so
Gail (PS0AJ)   [...]
Alison (PS0AL) [301] [...] on top of the telly, and say just put your foot on
               here a minute, now, they look quite thin now, but, that's what I
               was looking at, yeah, cos her feet are fat, yeah, but they, that
               do like that don't they?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [302] Yeah, that, yeah , [...] spreads out to the side anyway,
               don't it?
Alison (PS0AL) [303] Yeah, put these [...] .
               [304] Try her foot on it and if it don't, if her foot overlaps
Gail (PS0AJ)   [305] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [306] then take them back up and get a two.
               [307] Cos the thing is as well, I might be inclined to get a two
               anyway, because she wants it to last a little while don't she?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [308] Anyway , yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [309] They're not gonna last very long not a [...] like that is
               it?
               [310] ... Is that how it was?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [311] Yeah. [...] ...
Gail (PS0AJ)   [312] That was quick [...] .
Alison (PS0AL) [313] Yeah [...] .
Gail (PS0AJ)   [314] Yeah.
               [315] I'm not going to do no housework today.
Alison (PS0AL) [316] [...] , see mum and dad on Saturday at [...] .
Gail (PS0AJ)   [317] Yeah. [...] ... [...] .
Alison (PS0AL) [318] If erm
Gail (PS0AJ)   [319] Go on.
Alison (PS0AL) [320] if her foot's wide, wider than that would it matter?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [321] Well yeah, cos it ought to be tight on her, across.
Alison (PS0AL) [322] But if her foot's wider, you'll get the bigger size it'll
               take it up on the length bit.
Gail (PS0AJ)   [323] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [324] So I'd be more inclined, let me have a look at her when
               she comes in, send her up.
Gail (PS0AJ)   [325] Yeah ...
Alison (PS0AL) [326] [...] see, is it, I mean sometimes Scott's foot too wide
               for a [...] both sides.

               they fit alright.
Gail (PS0AJ)   [329] Yeah.
Alison (PS0AL) [330] They're not tight, that's why I went for a one cos I
               thought it's like a trainer innit?
Gail (PS0AJ)   [331] Yeah ... yeah ...
Alison (PS0AL) [332] You look quite a way [...] . [...]

                           ones that have something to feel shameful about.
                           [957] They go because they need to cover some sort
                           of guilt, I'm convinced of that now, the more people
                           that I know I mean fib of all people fib is now

                           couldn't smoke when I was pregnant, I, it made me
                           feel sick, I couldn't stand the smell of it, I had
                           no urge to smoke at all, I went right off smoking, I
                           [...] respect, I was lucky, but I do feel sorry for
                           these people that smoking at present cos it must be
                           ever so hard.
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1233] Yeah, I didn't smoke for the first six months
                           and then I finished work and I was at home
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1234] And you got bored.
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1235] yeah, and I used to go round and see our
                           Trace every day, and she was still smoking
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1236] [...] .
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1237] and er, so I used to, I started again and
                           then I didn't smoke until I come out of ho , when I
                           come out, I didn't smoke
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1238] Mm.
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1239] for about a month, six weeks, cos I had so
                           much on me mind
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1240] [...] .
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1241] yeah, there's only three weeks between Nat

                           you feel, sometime you think that makes you think
                           well, it didn't affect, you know,
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1246] No.
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1247] but there again everybody's different aren't
                           they?
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1248] I think they have got a point, I think it
                           might, it might ,

                           it's doing to yourself
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1252] Yeah, I think it must have some effect there
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1253] And seeing you've got another life inside you
                           , it must be doing something to them mustn't it?
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1254] It's bound to harm, I mean I know what you
                           said when he had all that problem, he sort of said
                           reckon cos I smoke.
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1255] You know I think you always bring the blame
                           back don't you?

                           you at the end of the day.
Gail (PS0AJ)               [1260] Yeah , yeah ...
Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1261] It must be difficult, like I said I was lucky
                           in the respect that I had, it never ever appealed
                           to, to [...] the minute I got pregnant, from the
                           minute [...] .

Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [1265] That really turned my stomach, even if, I
                           mean I remember when I was carrying, when I was
                           carrying the twins, [...] and he used to go out
                           [...] huge things you know, [...] and so much so
                           that if he came home in the night, right, and I was
                           already in bed asleep, I would be able to er, he
                           would wake me in the bedroom cos I could smell smoke
                           on him, but he didn't smoke, but where he'd been the
                           pub or a night club, I smelt

                           was, strip off and go in the shower and [...] ,

                           was, I'd put his clothes downstairs in the washing
                           basket not even in the bedroom one [...] .

Unknown speaker (KC5PSUNK) [laugh]
None (PS0AM)               [2647] But I I thought I had to sort of do
                           something.
                           [2648] And I said the Leeds have told her [...] I
                           said that it was ... [...] you know something might
                           come this afternoon.
