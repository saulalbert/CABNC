*ANN:	Why? What about yesterday? 
*MAT:	With all the walking we did. 
*ANN:	Oh! The walking? 
*RIC:	 (  ) 
*MAT:	 (  ) with our two feet. ((laugh))  
*ANN:	Aren't you used to walking that far? 
*MAT:	No. 
*RIC:	We walked further than that when we went to Crackside. 
*ANN:	Aye. You walk a long way when you go to, across Crackside.  (9.0) Would you like to go to Crackside Richard?  (9.0) He is. Tired I think, just nodding his head isn't he? 
*MAT:	Aha.
