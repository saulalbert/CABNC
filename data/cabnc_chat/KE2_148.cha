*TER:	Yeah, both out, yeah 
*MAR:	sort of 
*TER:	So we just wanna go and park somewhere don't we really?
*MAR:	Well really it's about it   (.) I'll have to see if there's a carrier    (.)  (        ) 
*TER:	I think there is one in the box, yes.
*MAR:	If we put one back in again. (.) I haven't got as much room in this one to put the bag.
*TER:	Have you not?No. (.) 
*MAR:	Gosh  (.) 
*TER:	Mm   (.) Oh the moor is   ((cough)) visible again.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) Oh well perhaps   (.) the fog and erm    (.)  (        ) got a appointment on the Saturday hasn't she?
*TER:	Has she?For hair 
*MAR:	 (        ) hair
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	and erm   (.) well perhaps   (.) young Bob and Jess can go on the moor on Saturday.
*TER:	Yes 
*MAR:	If it, I mean if it were like today it will be lovely.
*TER:	Yeah. (.) Yes well I hope we get the opportunity.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) 
*TER:	Gosh that car looks a bit rusty doesn't it?That's a Fiat of course you see.
*MAR:	Oh yes, yeah
*TER:	It's like Richard's old car, you remember that, Fiat?
*MAR:	 (        ) Fiat one two seven like that one is.
*TER:	Yeah that's right. (.)  ((laugh))  (.) Oh no he's coming off on, off the lorry so that's no good. (.) 
*MAR:	Well it would be a bit tight to get in I feel. (.) 
*TER:	There's nowhere up there is there?No she's just got in 
*MAR:	It's very difficult to get in 
*TER:	Yeah.Well we will just hope for the best, he's not going up there so that's one less.
*MAR:	 (        ) wondered if   (        ) 
*TER:	Yes I did too.
*MAR:	Oh look, we've just got one there.
*TER:	Oh yes.Great. (.) 
*MAR:	Oh look it's one of these that's nice because   [laughing] you can just sort of nothing can come in behind you and   (.) that sort of thing.
*TER:	Mind the disabled person just coming past you here, that's it.Good, right, so I will do what I've got to do, you will do what you've got to do  (.) 
*MAR:	This is all mucky at the back, what happened to it? (.) 
*TER:	You got a bag there? (        ) Oh.
*MAR:	Oh that will be alright
*TER:	Yes.
*MAR:	 (        ) very strong.

*TER:	Erm  (.) 
*MAR:	This one will be alright. (.)  (        )  (.)

*TER:	 ((cough)) 
*MAR:	so   (.) I was wrong   (        ) 
*TER:	Yes.Cos the other thing I was gonna do was to go into Lloyds, I must do that some time about this interest on that account   (.) cos I reckon it's very low
*MAR:	Oh yes.
*TER:	and I still haven't, I keep on forgetting that.
