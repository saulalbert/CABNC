Frederick (PS0A8)                    [18] Let me come quite clean ... on that
                                     and tell you that you, at the very moment
                                     I hope you are being recorded. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [19] Good heavens.
                                     [20] ... [...] a cross section. ...

Peter (PS0AA)                        [22] Well I suppose it's erm
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [23] Sounds quite an interesting
Peter (PS0AA)                        [24] an interesting idea.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [25] Yeah, I thought so. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [26] I'm not convinced ... that ... we can
                                     establish ... exactly what we're after ...
                                     erm ... the sort of conversation or
                                     communication
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [27] What
Peter (PS0AA)                        [28] that people use.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [29] Yeah, it seems to me that erm ...
                                     they are ... it's er going to be a
                                     comparative thing [cough] from ...
                                     nineteen ninety two, and then in, we'll
                                     say nineteen ninety seven for argument's
                                     sake. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [30] The trouble is
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [31] Or, or or gradually er on. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [32] increasingly I think nowadays ...
                                     people ... converse in ... not a foreign
                                     language, because the ... terms that
                                     people use are ... familiar but meanings
                                     that they ... intend ... are not, and th
                                     th th the computer people are the worst
                                     because they use ordinary words ... which
                                     mean completely different things in the
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [33] Than
Peter (PS0AA)                        [34] context of,o o of people just
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [35] Yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [36] talking
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [37] Yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [38] and ... there they, they talk about a
                                     database ... which is a ... it's not an
                                     English word
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [39] No a computer
Peter (PS0AA)                        [40] so what on earth does it mean?
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [41] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [42] Well ... I used the word to mo er in
                                     a report I was writing [sigh] [whispering]
                                     years ago [] ... it was ten years ago ...
                                     and I knew what I meant but I hadn't sat
                                     down and defined what I meant, perhaps I
                                     should have done.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [43] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [44] Since then a ... [sigh] program's
                                     been written called Database One which
                                     means something completely different ...
                                     which has been updated to Database Two and
                                     Three and may be Four, which mean
                                     different things, that's why they've got
                                     different numbers, they do more clever
                                     things ... and ... nowadays you talk, you
                                     hear people talking about databases and
                                     they all mean different things.
                                     [45] They usually mean ... a file ... of
                                     information which is processed by
                                     different, completely different
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [cough]
Peter (PS0AA)                        [46] computer systems.
                                     [47] One, as it were, to pick out
                                     addresses, one to pick out ... socio-
                                     economic groups, one to pick out motor
                                     cars, one to pick out number of bedrooms,
                                     one to pick out whatever, and ...
                                     trivially or, or superficially everyone
                                     says the same thing, a database, it's on
                                     the database, now
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [48] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [49] the file is there, that's a computer
                                     term, or ... exactly that, a l a, a
                                     listing of names, addresses and houses and
                                     cars and everything else, and a file is a
                                     defined computer term, what you do with it
                                     is the next thing
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [50] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [51] and ... the way in which you do what
                                     you do with it ... depends on what you put
                                     in.
                                     [52] If you only put people in who are
                                     owner-occupiers then you will not have all
                                     the information, all the people, who are
                                     in rented accommodation.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [53] Yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [54] If you only put in people who live in
                                     houses, you'll not have all the people who
                                     live in maisonettes and flats
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [55] Mm yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [56] [...] .
                                     [57] If you are ... not eligible to be put
                                     in if you don't have a motor car then
                                     you're discounting an enormous number of
                                     people who may have motorcycles or motor
                                     caravans or, you know, something which is
                                     perfectly valid but it invalidates the
                                     information that you think you are getting
                                     out of the file because you only put in
                                     ... certain ... perfectly reasonable,
                                     groups of er of things and i in, in, in
                                     Boots there's a, there's a er there's a
                                     ... a wonderful expression or ... [...]
                                     actually is, is the one I'm particularly
                                     thinking about, you know we, we sell ...
                                     shall we say a million bottles of aspirin
                                     a year, it is in fact considerably more
                                     than that, and that is perfectly
                                     reasonable and valid and ... mm ... but
                                     ... in the definition of that we obviously
                                     only included what Boots the Chemists sold
                                     because that's all the people who
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [58] Yeah, that's
Peter (PS0AA)                        [59] sold bottles
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [60] Yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [61] of aspirin
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [62] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [63] made by Boots.
                                     [64] But now of course there's Crooks and
                                     that means, not bottles of aspirins, bad
                                     example, but Strepsils the lozenges for
                                     example, are now sold in an enormous range
                                     of private pharmacies which are not Boots
                                     and they are therefore completely outside
                                     the term output, it may be a restricted
                                     term, it may not be the one we want, but
                                     that is what it was meant and that is what
                                     the number is generated from.
                                     [65] ... Now of course er ... we've sold
                                     the er chain of chemists in Canada who
                                     might have sold bottles of aspirin but,
                                     before we sold the chain, there was
                                     another enormous quantity of bottles of
                                     aspirin which wasn't defined, it was ...
                                     something which was introduced after, long
                                     after we defined what we meant by outputs
                                     of aspirin.
                                     [66] And ... the rate of change of, of, of
                                     ... society ... no the background to what
                                     we're doing, shifts the ... goalposts is
                                     the fashionable term but what you thought
                                     you meant you no longer mean, and of
                                     course, if one is meticulously methodical,
                                     one adjusts the definition as the
                                     circumstances change
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [67] Yes, yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [68] [...] we don't do that.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [69] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [70] Not with a thing like a outputs of
                                     aspirin, I mean everyone in Boots knows
                                     what the outputs of aspirin are ... just
                                     strange that they are in fact three times
                                     what we'd thought they were and we've
                                     [...] course there's Crooks, course
                                     there's this, course there's that ...
                                     tremendous discernment, tremendous
                                     understanding but if you haven't got that
                                     tremendous understanding, you've just
                                     joined the company, you [laughing] think
                                     you know [] something and you don't
                                     because ... [...] not what they think they
                                     are
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [71] Mm, mm
Peter (PS0AA)                        [72] and er ...
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [73] Anyway, how are you? ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [74] I, I'm not too bad.
                                     [75] ... I feel that er ... it's been a, a
                                     slightly peculiar month really.
                                     [76] ... Sort of, when we went to see
                                     Jan's mother for Christmas, I was saying
                                     to myself yeah, mm ... this time last year
                                     ... I was on holiday from work
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [77] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [78] now I am retired and er ... yes last
                                     year I was feeling a bit decrepit, you
                                     know I used to go for a full wal walk
                                     round [...] after lunch, after dinner,
                                     around where she lives and ...
                                     [whispering] it's much harder now [] .
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [79] Mm, how long is it since you [cough]
                                     knocked off work ... sick?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [80] Well I got flu in February last year
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [81] February ninety one?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [82] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [83] S so ... ah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [84] And I never went back.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [85] Yeah.
                                     [86] But you were presumably feeling not
                                     well before then?
                                     [87] ... Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [88] Well you, you, you, you, you know
                                     the, you know the, the scenario that ...
                                     [sigh] everything goes wrong, you know,
                                     everything goes wrong you know from time
                                     to time and you say to yourself oh it'll
                                     get better
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [89] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [90] it gets better ... and you say ooh
                                     I'm tired
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [91] Yes, that's right.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [92] oh I've had a bit of a day or erm
                                     ooh, whatever it is, and erm ... I ...
                                     said to myself I am making allowances for
                                     being tired and getting, getting on a bit,
                                     you know, and [sigh] that went on for
                                     quite a while actually until I said to
                                     myself [laugh] [laughing] I'm making up
                                     allowances you know, I'm []
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [93] Yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [94] there is something seriously,
                                     seriously queer ... you know maybe it's a
                                     brain tumour, you know, maybe it's er I'm
                                     going potty, maybe it's all sorts of
                                     things, and fortunately I er I s I went to
                                     the vet and erm ... [laugh] two weeks
                                     before he retired [laugh] but you know he,
                                     he was full of experience, that's really
                                     what I'm saying, he wouldn't be retiring
                                     otherwise
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [95] Yeah, yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [96] and er he said to himself there's
                                     something I, I, I don't know what it is
                                     necessarily but there is something, go to
                                     a specialist and the specialist was very
                                     very good ... you know blah blah blah blah
                                     you want some te I want some tests, you
                                     know, so I had some tests, you know and
                                     ... the crew that were doing the tests
                                     they knew what they were looking for and
                                     they either found it or they didn't, don't
                                     know.
                                     [97] But in due course ... er ... when I
                                     was still off with flu, erm back to the
                                     specialist [...] another test, you know,
                                     and ... that was er ... March, April of
                                     last year and the result of it was that
                                     there is something in there which is
                                     characteristic of what's, what we call
                                     multiple sclerosis which ... seems to me
                                     is about as broad as it's long, you know,
                                     it's, it's a very large [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [98] Yes i i i it's one of those erm
                                     illnesses that erm ... the average person
                                     knows of it and, and knows ... just a
                                     little bit but doesn't know very much.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [99] Well an an an and I, it seems to me
                                     that the, the er I mean you go, you go to
                                     the er to the M S Society and you find ...
                                     just about everybody there, you know, you
                                     find people who, who are in wheelchairs,
                                     you find people who are walking around,
                                     you find people who are ... er ...
                                     controlling their diet ... you find people
                                     who are obs s taking extreme ... dietary
                                     ... precautions, no, not precautions, no
                                     they are taking extreme care of their
                                     diet, er er I mean [...] on gluten-free
                                     diets and you know what that means
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [100] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [101] you can't have anything which has
                                     any
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [102] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [103] wheat or barley or anything
                                     connected ... and you find other people
                                     who are walking around relatively ...
                                     independently and you find people who are
                                     walking around ... slowly [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [104] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [105] and you find erm ... people like
                                     Lynn you know, bless her, who now, who ...
                                     isn't too bad when she's not too bad and
                                     isn't too good when she's not too good,
                                     you know, and ... it is such a very very
                                     [...] ... Not only can you not put
                                     anything visibly in ... in common with
                                     everyone that's got it, even the people
                                     [laughing] that have got it can't say [] I
                                     cannot do this ... period, they say oh
                                     well I'm not too good [...] now but maybe
                                     last week or maybe next week
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [106] Yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [107] So it's erm ... it's all a bit
                                     peculiar.
                                     [108] ... You now have to get, in er er,
                                     because there was a sort of erm gradation
                                     from being off ill, which wasn't familiar,
                                     to being off long term sick which you
                                     can't have any experience of ... to erm
                                     early retirement on health grounds and you
                                     just can't have any experience of that
                                     either ... erm to being retired and it's,i
                                     i it's, it's quite interesting
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [109] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [110] [laughing] going from one to the
                                     other in a year [] [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [111] Yeah, I thought it was longer than
                                     that you know.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [112] Well erm the er ... th th th the
                                     first and most ... horrific incidence was
                                     I think ... in the May, no no no it wasn't
                                     May, it was ... when we went down to s to

                                     going through nineteen ninety, but it
                                     wasn't until nineteen ninety one ... and I

                                     rich tapestry
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [laugh]
Peter (PS0AA)                        [115] and erm

                                     go back to work yet?
                                     [118] Er obviously she's not fit at the
                                     moment.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [119] Well
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [cough]

Frederick (PS0A8)                    [121] She has?
                                     [122] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [123] and erm in fact she was back all the
                                     ... all the, all the summer
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [124] No I meant ... fairly recently
Peter (PS0AA)                        [125] No.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [126] is it since she er was not well, mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [127] Erm we had gone down to, to, to ...
                                     Bognor to the christening of her, our ...
                                     nephew and ... she wasn't too,th that was
                                     in November, it was sort of middle of
                                     November, and ... something was going
                                     wrong there and so when I, when I was
                                     retiring on the twenty seventh of November
                                     she couldn't come in and er ...
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [128] Was that to Boots?
                                     [129] D
Peter (PS0AA)                        [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [130] yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [131] month of December was sort of off
                                     and ... trying to do odd things and then
                                     she ... went down with this, this flu er
                                     ... which was ... progressively worse
                                     since the new year.
                                     [132] So, you know what these girls are,
                                     they sort of I personally, you know, as it
                                     were a trained scientist, a certified
                                     chemist who [...] ... you tend to, to take
                                     a, a slightly ... er diagnostic view of
                                     things, but that's not quite right, but
                                     you take a slightly ... objective view of
                                     things and I, I, I, I've been thinking to
                                     myself ... [sighing] ah it is [] rotten
                                     unfair on girls because sometimes sort of
                                     between about fifteen and twenty five, but
                                     now I suppose because they're all growing
                                     up so much earlier it's between ten and
                                     twenty, they have a pretty monumental
                                     change, they, and, and ... it's not a
                                     bundle of laughs but they can talk to
                                     their friends, they can see their friends
                                     and talk to their mothers, they can get a
                                     vague way it's gonna affect them and they
                                     can ... you know, sort of, let's say
                                     twenty, twenty five ... settle into a
                                     routine which has ... variations every,
                                     during the four weeks and they vary
                                     between individuals, I mean ... it's well
                                     known
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [133] Yeah, that's right.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [134] you know that s some don't really
                                     have a great deal of problem, others
                                     really do have a sort of off work for two
                                     or three days every month and it's not a
                                     bundle of laughs because, you know, that
                                     really must be difficult, but ... they,
                                     they get a rough idea of how it ... for
                                     them
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [135] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [136] and it goes through their, for the
                                     rest of their twenties, the rest of their
                                     thirties and most of their forties and
                                     then suddenly [shouting] bang [] maybe
                                     something ghastly seems to be happening
                                     which they are absolutely unaware of, you
                                     know, they don't know why they are ...
                                     crying or, or ... er unable to cope with
                                     whatever they can't cope with ... and
                                     that's it, that's them off and they start
                                     worrying about er osteoporosis and you
                                     know an enormous number of, of now
                                     medically defined problems of the
                                     menopause, and they may start going on to
                                     all sorts of things like hormone
                                     replacement therapy or even primrose oil
                                     or whatever the hell ... and they're
                                     sitting there ... at an age when they are
                                     ... fairly loaded up with experience and
                                     maturity and all the rest of it
                                     [whispering] and they don't know what they
                                     are doing [] .
                                     [137] ... All the ... wisdom of er in, in
                                     writing and doctors and everything else
                                     says [laughing] oh it all varies you know
                                     some do this and some do that [] some go
                                     straight through in a regal dignified way
                                     and they just carry on into relatively old
                                     age, you know, smooth as ... relaxed,
                                     nothing to worry about, away.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [138] Mm, mm
Peter (PS0AA)                        [139] And ... tt Jan was er was ... er
                                     wondering ... during last year and went on
                                     to hormone replacement therapy because she
                                     was ... and the doctor was a bit concerned
                                     about possible osteoporosis which is erm
                                     brittle bone [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [140] Yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [141] i it's, it's obviously a thing
                                     which, if one can possibly avoid it's a
                                     good idea to [laugh] ... and erm ...
                                     [sigh] I must say it helped but it ... you
                                     don't know what is helping because you
                                     know [laughing] we don't know what her
                                     symptoms are going to be [] .
                                     [142] Maybe H R T was helping what her
                                     symptoms would have been if she hadn't
                                     taken them, maybe they were worse because
                                     she was, maybe they were the same in spite
                                     of it, but I dunno.
                                     [143] Er anyhow th th the, the eventual
                                     thing was maybe her blood pressure was
                                     going up higher than it should and maybe
                                     ... whether the cumulative stress of
                                     having a husband off in my state, maybe
                                     ... [sigh]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [144] Yeah what
Peter (PS0AA)                        [145] [...] her, you know maybe [...] all
                                     sorts of things [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [146] Yeah well this is,th this is it I
                                     mean th th there are often a lot of things
                                     happening at the same time er er some of
                                     which as you just sort of hinted at are
                                     sort of er erm ... of a psychological er
                                     er have a psychological factor in them
                                     which all add to it don't they?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [147] Well ... my feeling is that ... you
                                     know if yo if you're car doesn't run ...
                                     tinker with the carburettor [...] and if
                                     it still isn't running right, tinker with
                                     something else, if you like, the fatal
                                     thing is [laughing] to tinker with both []
                                     because then you just don't know what
                                     you've got, and erm she's been on, on ...
                                     this hormone replacement which is er er
                                     ... no big deal but, you know, hormones
                                     are [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [148] Well th
Peter (PS0AA)                        [149] big things.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [150] I, I, I've met ladies who have, have
                                     really benefited
Peter (PS0AA)                        [151] Oh yeah
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [152] from it.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [153] oh yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [154] Yeah. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [155] Erm ... her blood pressure was
                                     being, being depressed ... er by some
                                     other, you know, blood pressure regulator
                                     and erm ... one of the side effects of
                                     hormone replacement may be, yeah, [laugh]
                                     that ... people's ... susceptibility to
                                     migraine is heightened.
                                     [156] ... So y y y you, you, you, you've
                                     got at least three things which are all
                                     sort of brewing up there and you think
                                     good grief what a, what a, what a state to
                                     be in because the poor doctor doesn't know
                                     what on earth to do, poor Jan doesn't
                                     know, well it's worse for Jan cos she's
                                     sitting there thinking I'm going potty or,
                                     you know, can't stand properly or you know
                                     is leaning over or, or ... numb down one
                                     side of her face or, or ... or ...
                                     whatever it was, it was i i it was the,
                                     the dizziness I think actually which ...
                                     which was most alarming.
                                     [157] And so erm ... [...] get flu on top
                                     of it all erm [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [158] Quite.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [159] It really is a very difficult,
                                     difficult erm
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [160] Yeah there's quite a bit of flu
                                     about at the moment isn't there?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [161] Yeah.
                                     [162] ... Well what ... I know the answer
                                     is ... is to say don't worry ... be
                                     concerned but don't worry because worrying
                                     doesn't do you no good, it doesn't do the
                                     condition no good and it doesn't do
                                     everybody else any good either because
                                     they just say oh she's ... you know what
                                     she is, depressed by whatever it is and
                                     that's, as it were, objectively logical
                                     but ... wh wh what seems to me to be the
                                     absolutely ... overwhelming is to say he's
                                     not worried, he's desperately concerned,
                                     he's more concerned than humans can
                                     possibly be but ... if god isn't worried,
                                     what on earth are we burning up our
                                     resources worrying about because if he's
                                     not worried ... concerned yes, but he's
                                     not worried.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [163] Who are you talking about now?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [164] God.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [165] Oh god, yeah.
                                     [166] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [167] I mean he is desperately concerned,
                                     I mean he, he loves us all with a concern
                                     which just er er ... er er i is greater
                                     than anything we can understand, so [...]
                                     concern at the ... at the slightest ... er
                                     doubt about, I can't understand how
                                     concerned he is but er ... I totally relax

Frederick (PS0A8)                    [168] Yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [169] but if the god of heaven is
                                     concerned ... that's fine, he's not
                                     worrying because he created the whole
                                     thing, therefore it seemed to me pretty
                                     good ... reason to be concerned [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [170] Concerned but not worried.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [171] but not worried, and I'm certainly
                                     not
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [172] Yeah I, well I'm with you mm
Peter (PS0AA)                        [173] you know, lying awake at nights you
                                     know ... cos er th three and four in the
                                     morning ... everything's quiet, you know,
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [174] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [175] the heating's off [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [176] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [177] I think people who are ... liable to
                                     worry about their condition ... have a
                                     very very difficult time at three and four
                                     in the morning and er ... old ladies are
                                     particularly vulnerable I think.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [178] Well I, I had a period of waking up
                                     at four
Peter (PS0AA)                        [179] Isn't it [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [180] and not going off again.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [181] Isn't it
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [182] Mind you
Peter (PS0AA)                        [183] demoralising?
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [184] Yeah but I'd far sooner do that than
                                     not get off to sleep at night.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [185] Yeah I think that's ... that's
                                     right, you know.
                                     [186] That's where everyone's different of
                                     course but erm I, I think it is, it is ...
                                     it is ... a factor that erm ... one can
                                     watch television or can listen to the
                                     radio or one can go for a walk or do all
                                     sorts of things as it were before
                                     [laughing] noon and midnight but three or
                                     four in the morning, you know, when
                                     everything is []
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [187] Mm
Peter (PS0AA)                        [188] at a very low level I think it's a
                                     very potentially demoralising thing
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [189] Mm al although
Peter (PS0AA)                        [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [190] Yeah although it didn't, it didn't
                                     ... I w I wasn't too concerned about it, I
                                     thought well you know I'm resting er and
                                     er I'm the sort of person who only needs
                                     about six hours, if I get six hours I'm
                                     okay ... erm, you know, on a regular basis
                                     I'm talking about.
                                     [191] So er I mean it didn't really affect
                                     me too much.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [192] But it's ... a low time isn't it?
                                     [193] And it can be
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [194] Mm.
                                     [195] Well
Peter (PS0AA)                        [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [196] er well er here again I think er
                                     it's the old old story of erm it affects
                                     different people different ways.
                                     [197] Where some people are ... better a
                                     at night ... I'm erm I'm now talking about
                                     before going to bed
Peter (PS0AA)                        [198] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [199] th than first thing in the morning
                                     ... erm ... whereas I, I think probably I
                                     am probably better as soon as I get up
                                     than last thing at night. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [200] Yes er I, I, I, I think [...] ...
                                     one's either an owl or a ... some other
                                     bird which,wh wh which doesn't at night
                                     but does by, by, by day you know.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [cough]
Peter (PS0AA)                        [201] Yeah I, I, I think that er ... the,
                                     the, the M S Society have er er say that
                                     we've got eighty thousand members in the
                                     United Kingdom, Great Britain, Northern
                                     Ireland ... only problem is they appear to
                                     have eighty thousand different conditions
                                     [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [202] Yeah yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [203] That's absolutely right.
                                     [204] Every doctor will say you know
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [205] Yeah yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [206] people do differ
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [207] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [208] and some of them differ so much from
                                     others who you put in the same box and you

Frederick (PS0A8)                    [209] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [210] think well maybe we've got the box
                                     wrong.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [211] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [212] I think, I think that's it and er
                                     ... tt
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [213] You mentioned Christopher , what er
                                     the last time ... it's, I'm going back a
                                     little while, the last time I was talking
                                     with Janet ... he, she was a bit unhappy,
                                     I think he was in er a teaching practice
                                     at the time ... and she was wondering how
                                     he was going to go on. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [sigh]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [214] That must be the best part of the
                                     year ago I should think though now.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [215] Yeah.
                                     [216] ... Well the, the, the, the, the
                                     sort of, the sort of background as I have
                                     seen it [...] he never ... struck me as
                                     being particularly clever or bright ...
                                     it's just that he always seemed to be very
                                     well taught and academically successful
                                     and exams never seemed an undue problem,
                                     and so ... he went off to ...
                                     Wolverhampton Poly which he selected for,
                                     you know, all the usual reasons,
                                     reasonable place, reasonable course, a
                                     reasonable this a reasonable that, [...]
                                     tt ... erm to do computer science which of
                                     course all the kids want to do now ... erm
                                     twentieth centu no it isn't it's a sort of
                                     nineteen eighties version of wanting to be
                                     an engine driver isn't it?
                                     [217] They all want to be ... so he went
                                     off to be a computer scientist and ...
                                     either ... he was too interested in ... er
                                     ... what he describes as cult television
                                     which you think [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [yawn]
Peter (PS0AA)                        [218] but it's not [...] television,i i
                                     it's, it's Doctor Who and, and Prisoner
                                     and, you know ... er very ... interesting
                                     and very easy for enthusiasts to ...
                                     direct a lot of their time and energy to
                                     ... maybe I don't ... maybe there was a
                                     ... increased pressure to work and study
                                     ... which was erm self motivated rather
                                     than being externally imposed, maybe he
                                     ... [...] maybe there was a [cough]
                                     fundamental ... [sigh] ... lack of
                                     enthusiasm in him for ... what is
                                     described as the hardware of computing,
                                     the, the, the, the, the instruments, the
                                     machines ... maybe there was a less than
                                     [cough] comprehensive understanding of
                                     what is known as the firmware, that's to
                                     say I mean ... operating systems that are
                                     built into the thing to make it work,
                                     you've got to understand ... the firmware
                                     because otherwise you don't understand
                                     what the machine will ... think you mean
                                     and what that will do and ... I would have
                                     thought that whereas superficially you can
                                     ignore the firmware, it's all in there, it
                                     understands ... as you, I would have
                                     thought, grew into a ... er a graduate
                                     computer scientist you've got to have some
                                     idea about that.
                                     [219] Er maybe he was, I think, a little
                                     superficial in his enthusiasm for what is
                                     referred to as the software, that's to say
                                     that's the computer programs that you
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [220] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [221] write, you write and er ... feed
                                     into the thing which it operates along the
                                     rules defined by its firmware which
                                     someone else has put into it.
                                     [222] Anyhow, whatever it was, maybe ... a
                                     little, as Jan says, he also had a f a bad
                                     flu bug at a bad time ... anyhow he
                                     crashed out of the computer science course
                                     ... and he announced that he was ... only
                                     regarding the computer science course as
                                     being a stepping stone to being a teacher
                                     so the sensible thing to do would be to go
                                     on to the teacher training course at
                                     Lancashire, an education course, cos
                                     that's what he wanted to do.
                                     [223] So that cost an awful lot of money
                                     because he was on a grant of course and
                                     he, he spent er about a year as a trainee
                                     teacher and we thought that was great
                                     because he was, he was dealing with, with
                                     er ... [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [224] Wasn't he i in juniors yeah yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [225] Well I can't remember what the terms
                                     are, infants er
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [226] There's infants and juniors isn't
                                     there?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [227] Yeah it,i it's the very young ones
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [228] Ah infants.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [229] it was the very young ones and er
                                     ... the vast majority of ... infant
                                     teachers are girls
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [230] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [231] and so he had a ... a degree of
                                     uniqueness and er in the area that he was
                                     ... vast numbers of ... ethnic minorities
                                     ... so he was er he was ... a white male
                                     vegetarian
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [laugh]
Peter (PS0AA)                        [232] and I would have thought it was
                                     absolutely great, you know, [laughing] he
                                     really, I would have though [] had a

                                     his fees, his this [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [sigh]
Peter (PS0AA)                        [233] I was therefore ... a little
                                     surprised and very disappointed when he
                                     failed his teaching practice.
                                     [234] Erm ... I was, I was a bit erm ...
                                     [...] about that, you know, I just though
                                     what on earth now?
                                     [235] ... He is unemployed and receiving
                                     state benefit as employed which
                                     [whispering] isn't very much []
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [236] Is he at home or is he down there?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [237] He wants, wants to stay with us
                                     forever [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [238] Yeah quite.
                                     [239] Quite. ...

                                     it makes me ... cough a bit to go to the

Peter (PS0AA)                        [243] [...] large, not generous but I

                                     [244] I agree the state is picking up his,

Frederick (PS0A8)                    [245] Yeah, yeah.
                                     [246] It's a very bad time.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [247] It is bad
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [248] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [249] So he's, he's now doing er A level
                                     psychology and G S C E sociology at ...
                                     night school ... whilst he is keeping his

                                     is not easy anywhere
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [250] Right.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [251] it is ... no easier in greater
                                     Wolverhampton, and if you have eczema and
                                     a congenitally weak back you aren't
                                     actually falling over yourself in
                                     prospects for ... the best ... chances.
                                     [252] So erm we're both ... very
                                     concerned, not worried, very concerned
                                     about what on earth he is doing and what
                                     he is going to do.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [253] Yeah quite.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [254] You know he's twenty two, twenty
                                     three years old, you know, you know ...
                                     whatever he's doing he's liable to be with
                                     him for a few years yet ... and what can
                                     one see ... [whispering] [...] []
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [255] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [256] You know?
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [257] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [258] There just doesn't seem to be
                                     anything ... on the, on the ... horizon.
                                     [259] So after he's, he's sat these two
                                     exams ... erm
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [260] Is he doing them this year?
Peter (PS0AA)                        [261] Yeah,
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [262] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)                        [263] he may be eligible to be on a
                                     [cough] training course, for what we don't
                                     know, but er after you've been unemployed
                                     six months you are either required to or
                                     you have the opportunity to, or you can
                                     ... go on a state training course but what
                                     they train you for or to do we, we haven't
                                     actually got ... defined yet.
                                     [264] And ... possibly ... either after
                                     that or ... simultaneously with that or
                                     ... to transfer there, he might go up to
                                     ... live in his father's house up in
                                     Yorkshire, Mytholmroyd ... er er I dunno
                                     but it seems to me that if there is a
                                     worse place to be unemployed than
                                     Wolverhampton, West Riding has gotta be
                                     erm ... a [laughing] competitor []
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [265] Yeah, yeah
Peter (PS0AA)                        [266] and Hebden Bridge and Sowerby Bridge
                                     seem to be, you know, on each side of M
                                     Mytholmroyd, you know, on a railway line
                                     from Halifax which goes through to [...]
                                     and Todmorden and places.
                                     [267] Beautiful part of the world, you
                                     know, maybe that's exactly what you wanna
                                     do, you wanna kick out Wolverhampton and
                                     go for Mytholmroyd particularly if you've
                                     got a house or if your father's got a
                                     house there which is [...] there maybe a
                                     lot, a lot , a lot going for it but ...
                                     you're looking for this long term

Frederick (PS0A8)                    [268] Yeah quite er it doesn't sound too
                                     good. ...
Peter (PS0AA)                        [269] So er I [sigh] I thought to myself
                                     well ... I dunno, I dunno ... all these
                                     Newton girls have been off to Sri Lanka or

                                     that great?
                                     [270] Don't really want to ... he's not
                                     very keen on the prospect of going [...] V

                                     [271] And then I say to myself oh come on,
                                     oh don't say when I was your age I wanted
                                     ... did ... nearly or whatever.

Frederick (PS0A8) [273] But then they have to er raise money to go.
Peter (PS0AA)     [274] Right. ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [275] I mean it
Peter (PS0AA)     [276] I think it's only, I don't think [laughing] he, he's []
                  there's any cheap answers
Frederick (PS0A8) [277] No.
Peter (PS0AA)     [278] and I know la well some time when ... retirement was
                  looking on the ... on the horizon ... I was saying to him
                  you're not alone ... but, you know, you've gotta be looking
                  towards being on your own because of course
Frederick (PS0A8) [cough]
Peter (PS0AA)     [279] mother and I hope father and I will ... be around to
                  want to pick up what we can to help ... you've gotta start
                  thinking about ... standing on your own feet, you know,
                  because ... admittedly I er I, I, I ... could turn out to be
                  ... not as bad a financial state as I anticipated but I never
                  was stinking rich and I'm certainly not stinking rich now, so
                  ... erm I mean
Frederick (PS0A8) [280] No but quite apart from that, er th there's ... anybody
                  er needs to aim to be self sufficient don't they?
Peter (PS0AA)     [281] Well I, I, I, I think that you've got to ... move in
                  that direction rather than maintaining the status quo.
                  [282] So erm ... if, if it was er if it was a matter of ...
                  oh bankrolling him out to wherever it was or ...
                  supplementing his own resources [...] [laugh] okay, but the,
                  the experience and I mean the personal experience as well as
                  the er the skills experience
Frederick (PS0A8) [283] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [284] that
Frederick (PS0A8) [285] Yeah but he's got to want to do it.
Peter (PS0AA)     [286] Quite.
Frederick (PS0A8) [287] Er erm that's the, that's the crucial bit.
Peter (PS0AA)     [288] Absolutely.
                  [289] There is no possible way of shipping an unwilling young
                  person out.
Frederick (PS0A8) [290] No that's right.
                  [291] Because even
Peter (PS0AA)     [292] I don't think there ever was.
Frederick (PS0A8) [293] e e even those that er you know are definitely wanting
                  to go and keen can [laughing] get homesick [] fairly soon.
Peter (PS0AA)     [294] Oh yeah.
                  [295] But you know erm if, if, if you look back to the days
                  of the Raj ... erm it was a ... even within my living memory,
                  erm people were joining the armed services or the overseas er
                  er ... [...] corp and the civil service overseas I suppose,
                  yeah, er at a, at a fairly ... humble level and would either
                  work their way up or they drink themselves stupid or they get
                  mixed up with someone or they, you know ... but it was a, a,
                  a ... recognized way of, of, of going, you know, either join
                  the services or the
Frederick (PS0A8) [296] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [297] or the church of course was another one, erm but ...
                  none of these [cough] traditional [cough] erm ... avenues
                  exist now
Frederick (PS0A8) [298] No.
Peter (PS0AA)     [299] and more and more and more people are looking for
                  experience, they're looking for vocations, they're looking
                  for er ... the sort of ... attributes which, you know, aren't
                  actually overflowing when you're unemployed in Wolverhampton
Frederick (PS0A8) [300] That's right.
Peter (PS0AA)     [301] having failed out on two poly courses.
                  [302] So erm we as, we as I say are very concerned about er
                  ... that can't have done Jan any good, that's
Frederick (PS0A8) [303] No no, that's right.
Peter (PS0AA)     [304] She really has ... this er ... attitude which ... I
                  cannot understand because erm a a as I think it was Al Reeve
                  said, you know, erm some people can't bear children, we
                  can't, but we like them [laugh] but if you have actually
                  borne children, you are in other words a mother, you've gotta
                  have a ... attitude, not only to children in general but to
                  your children in particular, which is very very difficult for
                  ... er a male to understand and a non-father, it's gonna be
                  very very difficult cos I personally don't have any children
                  at all and therefore it is very very difficult for me to even
                  comprehend but ... given that I can erm I can sympathize with
                  something I do not comprehend [whispering] it must be
                  monumentally difficult for her
Frederick (PS0A8) [305] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [306] it really must [] .
Frederick (PS0A8) [307] Yes, oh yes,th th that's right, there's no doubt about
                  it.
Peter (PS0AA)     [308] And erm poor Jan is ... saying what ... [laughing] have
                  I done, should I have done, could I have done []
Frederick (PS0A8) [309] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [310] and, you know, once you start into, into that er
                  scenario yo yo yo you, you, you can't ... very very little
                  erm opportunity for anything because ... all you can do is,
                  is to say what do we do now, never mind what we could, should
                  or might have done then, what do we do now because the future
                  is that way and the past is ... [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [311] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [312] We can be influenced by history, we can, we learn from
                  history, we can do all sorts of things about history but what
                  er er as far as ... er ... Christopher's concerned, what do
                  we do now because that ... I just don't know!
                  [313] I just
Frederick (PS0A8) [314] No.
Peter (PS0AA)     [315] don't know!
Frederick (PS0A8) [316] No that's right.
Peter (PS0AA)     [317] And erm ... the really distressing thing is ... I think
                  Christopher is saying what to do now ... I think he is saying
                  oh you know
Frederick (PS0A8) [318] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [319] I, I've been
Frederick (PS0A8) [320] Yeah
Peter (PS0AA)     [321] depending on, sponging off er whatever ... for however
                  long and now he is going, is, is retiring on health grounds,
                  you know, he really isn't going to be er able to bankroll me
Frederick (PS0A8) [322] You mean he, he's now talking about you?
                  [323] Yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [324] Well I mean, yeah, he
Frederick (PS0A8) [325] Er thinking, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [326] he's not, he's not, he's not a, he's not stupid,
                  Christopher, he, he's certainly not stupid, and er ... he
                  must have seen, I mean I assume he keeps his bank statements,
                  I mean I'm afraid we have one or two bank statements which
                  show ... thousands of pounds that he's received from us over
                  the last year erm and, you know, he can't [...] blind because
                  they've all gone through his bank account, you know, he must
Frederick (PS0A8) [327] Yeah, quite
Peter (PS0AA)     [328] be thinking good grief, you know, I haven't had a ...
                  a, a, a successful, happy ... year or so
Frederick (PS0A8) [329] No.
Peter (PS0AA)     [330] and ... it has, it has represented volumes of money
                  which the state can't or won't or doesn't ... carry on with.
                  [331] So I think he's sitting there in Wolverhampton about
                  this time wondering what on earth he is ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [332] I'm sure he must be
Peter (PS0AA)     [333] looking forward to and ... [sigh] ... that is a very
                  very ... painful ... situation to be in isn't it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [334] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [335] I, I just don't know what he's, he's, he's, he's, he's
                  seeing his future as being and erm ... maybe cos we haven't
                  got [...] , maybe erm it's because of the ... generation gap,
                  maybe it's because of communication problems either between
                  me and him or the young and old or whatever but, you know, he
                  just doesn't seem to have anything ... to ... volunteer er
                  other than ah well I'll try and get a job or ah well I'll try
                  and get some more qualifications or whatever.
                  [336] ... So, yeah, that's sort of
Frederick (PS0A8) [337] Yeah, yeah
Peter (PS0AA)     [338] anoth another bit in the
Frederick (PS0A8) [339] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [340] Where, whereabouts is Lyndsey in her training now?
Peter (PS0AA)     [341] Oh she's erm ... tt ... she is the ... brighter ...
                  spark on the horizon I suppose, you know?
                  [342] ... [sigh] It makes me cough a bit because when ... I
                  came on the scene he was the one academically everything and
                  she was the one who was academically rather ... disadvantaged
                  but she, she was, you know,no not having the greatest of, of,
                  of success but erm ... it was said that she wouldn't be able
                  to be a student nurse because she wasn't bright enough but
                  you know she ... clocked up the O levels and A levels like
                  guide badges and she went off on this pre-nursing course in
                  South Notts you know and ... she was in and out of the Queens
                  on a course and ... [...] people and, you know, [...] and ...
                  she said I ... don't know all the answers but I've a rough
                  idea about some of the questions, I want to be a nurse and
                  ... off she went to, to, to Walsall and ... I'm not saying
                  she's a brilliant student nurse but erm ... absolutely clear
                  that she's better than some of the others.
                  [343] And er, you know, that's ... negative if you will but
                  ... it's fact
Frederick (PS0A8) [344] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [345] and [laughing] she's still enjoying it which is great
                  []
Frederick (PS0A8) [346] Yeah, so, so what year is she, er third year?
                  [347] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [348] Mm.
                  [349] Takes her finals this, this summer.
                  [350] And erm not only er do I think that er she'll probably
                  ... be reasonably good with, with finals ... I'm absolutely
                  sure that her course reports from, you know, all the places
                  where she's been will be ... better than most of the other
                  candidates, you know, because she brings home these,the these
                  reports, you know, and she says it looks alright, you know,
                  [...] ... beginning of the course ... Nurse is lacking in
                  this or has not got that or is not, you know, you think mm
                  pretty ... the end of the course [...] ... Nurse got the hang
                  of, is very good, has done this, has done that, has supported
                  this and you think mm pretty, well that's lovely [laughing]
                  you know but she [] didn't have the experience ... during the
                  whatever, she had been given the experience and the end of it
                  ... brilliant
Frederick (PS0A8) [351] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [352] A or whatever it is, you know?
Frederick (PS0A8) [353] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [354] And er I, I would therefore think that i it's, it's
                  unlikely that she'll crash out on her exams.
                  [355] But if she did ... I think she will pass out on her
                  record because perhaps, even more delightful than someone
                  who, you know, sitting down to an exam and, and ... doing
                  reasonably well on it.
                  [356] So ... I, I, I think that er one of the, the ...
                  comforting things which er ... I c I can see is that she has
                  grown in self confidence, not cockiness, self confidence.
                  [357] She has learnt, she has absorbed ... inwardly digested
                  a quantity, a consid considerable quantity of it, I think
                  that she will be a reasonably ... useful ... nurse to have
                  around.
Frederick (PS0A8) [358] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [359] That's lovely [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [360] Yeah, yeah
Peter (PS0AA)     [361] You know, they, they, they can be a bit hard, they can
                  be a bit bitter, they can drink a bit too much, they can be a
                  bit promiscuous, they can be all sorts of rather ... iffy
                  things but I don't think Lyndsey will.
                  [362] I, I, I, I've got, I think all the evidence is building
                  towards her being ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [363] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [364] a good little nurse.
Frederick (PS0A8) [365] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [366] What on earth she does then ... I dunno.
                  [367] ... Erm ... mm I can't remember, Alan and Josie's
                  daughter down the road, erm ... she ... passed out as a nurse
                  from Queens a while ago and you know what students are in
                  general, nurses in particular , there was, you would expect,
                  one hell of a party when the exam results were public ...
                  [...] what came out of the [...] ... [shouting] the party was
                  when she got a job [] as a nurse.
                  [368] And that is absolutely mind blowing to me
Frederick (PS0A8) [369] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [370] because I can remember, and it's not that long ago for
                  goodness sake, that if you qualified as a nurse, and [...]
                  will probably tell even the same story to an extent, there
                  was no problem about a job, you were a certified nurse, bang.
Frederick (PS0A8) [371] That's right.
                  [372] Well er I mean that's ... not going back too far
                  either.
Peter (PS0AA)     [373] Well ... it ain't now
Frederick (PS0A8) [374] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [375] and er er er er the situation is that you can, in, in
                  some of these nursing schools where they have taught you and
                  it is their letterhead that's on your pass-out, they still
                  aren't in a position to say oh well there's a job of course
                  because you don't need to have passed out top, you know, to
                  be guaranteed a job, there ain't no jobs ... guaranteed for
                  no one.
                  [376] And er I just don't know what to do.
                  [377] California and Saudi Arabia are two of the, you know,
                  destinations that come to mind but erm ... I don't know about
                  that either, you know, if she doesn't ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [378] What month does she take the exam?
Peter (PS0AA)     [379] Oh I er er I think it's erm ... July or er June, July
                  or August, it's, it's, it's it's
Frederick (PS0A8) [380] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [381] the summer.
                  [382] I think she maybe takes the exams in June and gets the
                  results in July and ... er then we're fifty in August and
                  then we go off to North America in September I think, you
                  know, er I think, I, I can't quite remember the details but
                  erm
Frederick (PS0A8) [383] You've got a holiday booked?
Peter (PS0AA)     [384] Yes, yes
Frederick (PS0A8) [385] Good.
Peter (PS0AA)     [386] well we've erm ... we've erm ... we've been rather ...
                  tempted by the west coast er ... I personally want to see the
                  Grand Canyon and erm I'd like to see San Francisco ... so the
                  package which is being offered to the Boots Association with
                  whom we've been away several times and ... we lo we like it
                  as, as a, as a background because you've got a rough idea,
                  you know, the people you're going with [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [387] Yes.
Peter (PS0AA)     [388] there are, there are very very few who are chasing
                  women or men and there are very very few who are er ...
                  requiring to be prised out of the bar erm ... at two o'clock
                  in the morning.
                  [389] There are very very few who are er interested in
                  finding a gambling haunt or a, you know, television or film
                  theatre or whatever, you know, er er by and large there are a
                  lot of people who ... chat to a waitress if they're a bloke
                  or, or chat to the, the whatever it is if they're girls but
                  er in, in a, in a friendly way, who will have a drink but
                  will not be paralytically drunk, who may watch television or
                  a, you know, film or theatre or something if it's appropriate
                  but won't get twitched if it isn't, you know, and ... and by
                  and large erm all the people we've, we've, we've, we've come
                  across ... I came across before have been very very good
                  company and it is, it is delightful to have the ... have you,
                  cos have you been on a Si on a Signpost?
Frederick (PS0A8) [390] Yes ... a Signpost holiday, yeah
Peter (PS0AA)     [391] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [392] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [393] Well er ... I think that getting away the [mimicking]
                  oh you live in Nottingham, oh fancy that [] you know, you,
                  you know where you're starting, you know, everyone either
                  works for Boots or used to work for Boots and, you know,
                  you've got a rough idea, you, you, you don't need to go into
                  the [mimicking] oh fancy that [...] [] you know, all that's
                  ... arranged so erm I think i i it's,i i i it's the middle of
                  September when we either go to Los Angeles, I think we go to
                  Los Angeles, and fool around Hollywood and San Diego and
                  places and down to [...] to see a [...] and then away off to
                  erm Las Vegas and Flagstaff ... you know about this meteor
                  crater in Flagstaff, that apparently is why you go to
                  Flagstaff tt a meteor came, the meteor crater is there tt and
                  then the Grand Canyon and [...] ... go through [...] national
                  park which [...] San Francisco and erm ... spend erm two or
                  three days there and then come back again.
                  [394] Tt so erm ... we are thinking it will be, like
                  everybody else, it's not a good idea to put too much off
                  [laughing] too far into the future []
Frederick (PS0A8) [395] Oh no no, you want to go.
Peter (PS0AA)     [396] I, I think, well I think so.
                  [397] And so er friends of ours, he's got ... muscular
                  dystrophy ... and he's sort of in the same sort of [...] and
                  so we [...] ... we'll have a decrepit contingent, [laughing]
                  he and I will [laugh] sort of and the two girls who are
                  relatively young and healthy will go charging around and ...
                  taking photographs and ... doing the tourist thing.
Frederick (PS0A8) [398] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [399] Yes.
                  [400] ... Sort of on the, on the horizon for the end of the
                  year and er ... I, I er don't know how we're going to ... do
                  but erm ... I think the answer probably is to ... take a
                  chunk at a time on the basis that erm one isn't going to be
                  able to charge around as violently, actively as some people
                  will.
Frederick (PS0A8) [401] Yeah, yes er erm that's oh you must because then you
                  have the memories.
Peter (PS0AA)     [402] Exactly.
                  [403] Exactly.
                  [404] Not only does no one want to take those away, no one
                  can take them away
Frederick (PS0A8) [405] That's right.
Peter (PS0AA)     [406] [...] that's er that's right, you know, and ... erm
                  what I'm saying to myself is okay, you know, er ... maybe it
                  will be tiring, I'm sure it will ... maybe it will be erm ...
                  expensive, like take a taxi because ... [laughing] can't
                  walk, you know, erm [] erm okay
Frederick (PS0A8) [yawn]
Peter (PS0AA)     [407] that's, that's, that's the way it is and er
Frederick (PS0A8) [408] Yeah. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [409] we'll ... I think, be okay and, provided we don't [...]
                  excessively energetic and too stupid, get too hot in the bath
                  or [...] that's not a very good thing to do, or crash out
                  with er flu or something ... I dare say anyone can crash out,
                  I mean you, you, you could be a president of the United
                  States [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [410] [laughing] Exactly [] [laugh]
Peter (PS0AA)     [411] and be in, in Japan and you can crash out but er
Frederick (PS0A8) [412] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [413] we'll see how it er ... What are your,wh what are you
                  pla er er your plans?
                  [414] Are you, are you going on a, a ship again or [...] ?
Frederick (PS0A8) [415] No I, I haven't got any plans at the moment, you know
                  I've been sort of er ... I usually go around this time you
                  know, er
Peter (PS0AA)     [416] It it's certainly looking ... [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [417] Yeah I've still got swollen fingers which I am er er
                  I've needed as much physio on these as on, on the finger that
                  was done.
Peter (PS0AA)     [418] Why was that?
Frederick (PS0A8) [419] [sigh] They just swoll sw swelled up and erm I don't
                  know why but I'm told it's not unusual.
Peter (PS0AA)     [420] Mm.
                  [421] Because of the, the tinkering around it must do a bit
                  of
Frederick (PS0A8) [422] And erm ... but as I say I, I, I have, I still haven't
                  got full use of those. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [423] Are they, are they coming?
Frederick (PS0A8) [424] Yes I ... yes they are er but I seem to have reached a,
                  a stage where they're not [laughing] progressing as much as I
                  would like [] you know?
                  [425] They're, they're, oh they're vastly improved
Peter (PS0AA)     [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [426] to, to, I mean when I first had the er plaster off,
                  which was for ten days it was, I could not believe it that
                  [laughing] these fingers were not going [] but I'm told that
                  that's quite usual.
Peter (PS0AA)     [427] Well ... i it's a very complicated bit of gear and
Frederick (PS0A8) [428] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [429] it's been tinkered around with I mean I don't
Frederick (PS0A8) [430] Yes but er I think i it's a combination of things, it's
                  the fact that you've got your erm hand in plaster so your
                  fingers are not moving and you lose muscle tone so quickly.
Peter (PS0AA)     [431] Mm.
                  [432] Particularly with something which is otherwise in
Frederick (PS0A8) [433] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [434] almost continuous use
Frederick (PS0A8) [435] Ah right.
Peter (PS0AA)     [436] perhaps not to a very violent er extent but it's, it's,
                  it's moving.
Frederick (PS0A8) [437] Yeah that's right, that's right.
                  [438] So er to get to your question erm I've sort of not ...
                  been doing anything erm I was hoping that I would be sort of
                  fully fit round about now and then if I saw something on
                  teletext [laugh] er that was good I'd just buzz off for a
                  week or so.
                  [439] Cos I ... I got one off teletext erm ... er it must
                  have been nineteen ninety now ... for Tenerife ... four star
                  hotel, seven days, East Midlands Airport for one hundred and
                  fifteen pounds ... half board er er the following day which
                  was fantastic.
                  [440] I mean everything was good, the flight, the hotel, the
                  weather. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [441] Er and, and these are erm ... to fill up the, the
                  exercise, the ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [442] Yes they're er er
Peter (PS0AA)     [443] short term
Frederick (PS0A8) [444] they're a filling up, the plane, yeah.
                  [445] Filling up the plane and the hotel, spaces that the,
                  this particular company had, yeah.
                  [446] ... You don't see many like that, I'm not expecting
                  that again.
Peter (PS0AA)     [447] Well.
Frederick (PS0A8) [448] Especially East Midlands Airport, it's very seldom you
                  see an East Midlands Airport bargain.
                  [449] [cough] ... But erm no I shall er
Peter (PS0AA)     [450] Is, is, is that national ... nationally advertised?
Frederick (PS0A8) [451] Yes, yes
Peter (PS0AA)     [452] So [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [453] so most of them are London Gatwick ... or Manchester.
                  [454] Most of them er er that are advertised are from London
                  Gatwick. [yawn] ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [455] So as it were you, you, you turn up ... holidays ...
                  and you, you, you, you, you scroll through until you
Frederick (PS0A8) [456] Yeah.
                  [457] Well they, they, they scroll through themselves, I mean
                  you have no control ... er they are on three five two is one
                  of the n the numbers and er there, there's probably be about
                  four to six pages which, you know, go er er er you have to
                  wait, I mean they just go through I don't know about twenty
                  seconds perhaps each
Peter (PS0AA)     [458] Oh so
Frederick (PS0A8) [459] page
Peter (PS0AA)     [460] there, there is time to erm
Frederick (PS0A8) [461] Oh and you can hold ... i i if there's one comes up you
                  can hold it.
Peter (PS0AA)     [462] Oh I see yes, yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [463] Mm.
                  [464] Yeah. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [465] [...] ... a a and yes that is, that is quite erm ...
                  that is quite erm
Frederick (PS0A8) [466] You'd be interested in teletext, you must have a
                  teletext set next time you have a set.
Peter (PS0AA)     [467] Well yeah I suspect we will but erm ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [468] I, I don't mean just for holidays, I, I
Peter (PS0AA)     [469] [...] ... i i it seems that an enormous number of
                  people who have got it erm ... do ... find it er useful.
                  [470] Whether it is er ... particularly important to an
                  individual depends on the individual again
Frederick (PS0A8) [471] Mm mm
Peter (PS0AA)     [472] and er I suspect most people would be ... only keeping
                  an eye on the foreign exchange page, you know, when they were
                  thinking about buying [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [473] Yeah, yeah, yeah but I mean there's the weather
                  forecast including the local weather forecast erm that you
                  can switch on any time and er ... news of course erm oh er er
                  lots and lots.
                  [474] It's, it's amazing how much there is [cough]
Peter (PS0AA)     [475] Do you get a teletext directory? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [476] You
Peter (PS0AA)     [477] Well you know it's gonna be page three five two but how
                  do you know it's page three five two, do you just
Frederick (PS0A8) [478] di did, yeah, did ori ah ah yes but er
Peter (PS0AA)     [479] do you go through, through [laughing] three five one
                  before you got there [] ?
Frederick (PS0A8) [480] Yeah they, they erm ... when you switch the teletext on
                  it comes on to a hundred, that's the thing, and, and, and on
                  that a hundred they'll give you ... er news one O two or
                  whatever it is, you know, and so on.
                  [481] But also one nine nine is the index of the whole lot.
                  ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [482] And, and you, you, you, do you ... select Ceefax or, or
                  Oracle?
                  [483] Or
Frederick (PS0A8) [484] Yeah, yeah you
Peter (PS0AA)     [485] does it
Frederick (PS0A8) [486] No er yes,wha what you do er okay one is B B C One so
                  if you put text on that, then obviously Ceefax will come up.
Peter (PS0AA)     [487] Yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [488] Now you've got to go back to T V to get
Peter (PS0AA)     [489] Change to
Frederick (PS0A8) [490] to three
Peter (PS0AA)     [491] I T V
Frederick (PS0A8) [492] and then you text for your Oracle.
Peter (PS0AA)     [493] Oh I see.
                  [494] ... Cos it's,i i it's, it's, it's, it's, it's very very
                  clever isn't it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [495] It is very clever.
Peter (PS0AA)     [496] It's, it's ... is it two lines the ... picture that
                  have got the teletext data on them? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [497] How do you mean? ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [498] Where is it?
                  [499] ... Where's the information?
                  [500] It must be transmitted
Frederick (PS0A8) [501] Ah yes.
Peter (PS0AA)     [502] and it must be transmitted on
Frederick (PS0A8) [503] Yeah
Peter (PS0AA)     [504] B B C One and I T V
Frederick (PS0A8) [505] it's er on B B C One and B B C Two er
Peter (PS0AA)     [506] The same?
Frederick (PS0A8) [507] I think they are the same but three and four are
                  different.
                  [508] Er B B C Two I think B ... er ... three and four are
                  different.
Peter (PS0AA)     [509] Channels
Frederick (PS0A8) [510] Four
Peter (PS0AA)     [511] three and four?
Frederick (PS0A8) [512] is different to Oracle
Peter (PS0AA)     [513] Oracle
Frederick (PS0A8) [514] er is well is different to er ... er channel three.
                  [515] I think they're probably both Oracle. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [516] Oh so it's just
Frederick (PS0A8) [517] Yeah but in other words what I'm saying is that there
                  are diff
Peter (PS0AA)     [518] It's three page hundreds ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [519] Yeah
Peter (PS0AA)     [520] that you've got to look at.
Frederick (PS0A8) [521] Yes, yes, yes yes.
                  [522] Erm ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [523] So your
Frederick (PS0A8) [524] but but on, no, on your er, no, on your ... Oracle er
                  ... channel three, one nine nine ... what will be shown up on
                  your index will be channel three and channel four
Peter (PS0AA)     [525] Aha
Frederick (PS0A8) [526] so, and, and you will see that's, that er ... I don't
                  know whether some are all the same, but erm there are
                  different, yeah, you know, erm ... in other words what I'm
                  saying is they're not on both channels. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [527] So they're, I don't know whether it's,i it's terribly
                  reactionary to say that we really want one teletext ... cos
                  your holidays, might they be coming up on ... Ceefax
Frederick (PS0A8) [528] No, no,i it's pur it's all
Peter (PS0AA)     [529] [...] Oracle
Frederick (PS0A8) [530] Oracle, yeah, cos it's an advertisement, I mean the
                  people who are ... er er it is er being paid for by the
                  people who advertise it.
                  [531] Yeah. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [532] Yeah I, I think you'll find ... that erm when the ...
                  colour er when B B C Two came along and all the aerials went
                  to U H F, we went from a four O five line
Frederick (PS0A8) [533] That's right
Peter (PS0AA)     [534] to a six two five
Frederick (PS0A8) [535] Something.
Peter (PS0AA)     [536] line and I think you'll find that now there are in fact
                  six two three lines of television information, and there are
                  two lines which are dedicated to carrying teletext data
Frederick (PS0A8) [537] Oh
Peter (PS0AA)     [538] and I think that's where the [...] , there's no sound
                  is there? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [539] No, you get the sound of the erm the programme.
Peter (PS0AA)     [540] Oh really?
Frederick (PS0A8) [541] Oh yes, if you, you, no you get the sound, if I erm s
                  say I've got Oracle erm channel three on and I switch to
                  text, I will still get the sound of the television programme
Peter (PS0AA)     [542] Ah I see.
                  [543] Which will be confusing.
Frederick (PS0A8) [544] Well you can mute it if you want you see.
Peter (PS0AA)     [545] Yes of course, yes of course
Frederick (PS0A8) [546] And you can mix it.
                  [547] You, you can have your erm ... if you were watching a
                  programme and er, I've done this, erm if you're watching a
                  programme and you want to see what the weather forecast is er
                  you can have that superimposed on your programme.
                  [548] And, and the other way
Peter (PS0AA)     [549] What in a, in a ... [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [550] No, no over the top.
Peter (PS0AA)     [551] Over the top?
Frederick (PS0A8) [552] Over the top.
Peter (PS0AA)     [553] Oh I see.
Frederick (PS0A8) [554] And the other thing erm which er er is good, supposing
                  you're watching er a programme and there's a football match
                  on and you're interested in the, the football ... er but you
                  don't really want to keep, you know, switching to find out
                  what the score is, er I'm talking about teletext as opposed
                  to a programme, you press the update and it w er and if
                  something's happened, you know, they've changed and there's
                  been a score, it'll come up er [laugh] er while you're
                  watching the programme, er it'll let you know that erm
                  there's been something happening.
                  [555] ... Er it's, it's amazing. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [556] I don't know what that is.
                  [557] It's not you is it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [558] It isn't, no.
                  [559] Is it, it's not your er central heating is it?
Peter (PS0AA)     [560] Ah ... might be.
                  [561] It might be.
                  [562] ... Yes that, that sounds like it.
Frederick (PS0A8) [563] Yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [564] Yes the erm ... these things,an and can you er can you
                  record ... teletext?
Frederick (PS0A8) [565] No, I tried that the other day.
                  [566] No.
                  [567] ... Yo fr er you're talking about video?
Peter (PS0AA)     [568] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [569] Yeah. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [570] And if you're playing a tape back ... which was
                  recorded off air ... what happens if you push the text
                  button? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [571] Don't know.
Peter (PS0AA)     [572] Because the data, you see, the two lines, I would have
                  thought would have been recorded
Frederick (PS0A8) [sigh]
Peter (PS0AA)     [573] without you meaning it to be recorded
Frederick (PS0A8) [574] Ah well I can let me er say this, er ... you, you know
                  how some programmes er you can have erm ... oh you may not
                  know ... [cough] excuse me ... erm there are certain
                  programmes which you can er put in eight eight eight and you
                  get captions
Peter (PS0AA)     [575] Ah ye yes,i if that's available.
Frederick (PS0A8) [576] If it's available.
Peter (PS0AA)     [577] Yes, yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [578] Erm now if you record that programme and then, on
                  video, and then play it back you can't put in eight eight
                  eight and get it.
Peter (PS0AA)     [579] Oh.
                  [580] ... Mm i it, I, I, I, I d I dunno as I say i i it, it,
                  it seems to me to be an incredibly clever
Frederick (PS0A8) [581] You would enjoy it. [laugh]
Peter (PS0AA)     [582] arrangement.
Frederick (PS0A8) [583] Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peter (PS0AA)     [584] But erm ... [...] ... The television of course i is
                  infernally clever, I mean th there's er no doubt that the
                  microchips that erm ... takes away the erm the teletext
                  information, stores it and then spits up whatever you ask for
                  is er ... two or three P now I suppose and therefore the, the
                  television manufacturer charges hundred pounds to put it in.
Frederick (PS0A8) [585] Mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [586] It's er ... it's [...] ... you're, you're, you're,
                  you're quite erm ... hooked on it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [587] Ah well yes I wouldn't like to be without it now.
                  [588] Definitely not. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [589] And is, is there much difference between er Ceefax and
                  Oracle?
Frederick (PS0A8) [590] [sigh] Well ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [591] They look more or less the same do they?
Frederick (PS0A8) [592] Yeah I mean the news is very similar of course erm
Peter (PS0AA)     [593] Presumably that's indicated ... or is it?
                  [594] Dunno because I think it isn't actually come to think
                  of it ... B B C will do their own and I T V will do their own
                  [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [595] Oh yeah oh it's definitely their own, yes.
                  [596] Yeah.
                  [597] ... Yeah.
                  [598] So I'm a bit of a newshound so I look at both of
                  course, see what's what.
                  [599] I'm er I'm not saying I, the headlines you see, so I
                  will select the headline I'm interested in. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [600] And would
Frederick (PS0A8) [601] And then it'll come up, you know, I'll put in w er one
                  O two is the headlines for Ceefax for instance and then the
                  stories will be from one O three to about one one five or
                  something like that you see.
                  [602] And er ... th so er if I'm interested in er George
                  Bush's illness, you know, and that's one O four I'll put in
                  one O four and then that will come up on the screen. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [603] So presumably ... wh wh what bank are you with? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [604] What ... I'm with Barclays.
Peter (PS0AA)     [605] Oh ... I suspect they're [...] you bank with ...
                  totally ignorable.
                  [606] If you're with er National Westminster ... erm ... y y
                  y y you, you, you know about these, these, these ... cash
                  tills that you put a card in and
Frederick (PS0A8) [607] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [608] ask it questions, it's obviously on the telephone ...
                  because you can ask what the balance is and it will tell you,
                  and it can't possibly know that ... and Cleethorpes, when you
                  put the card in the Cleethorpes thing, that, you know, your
                  bank balance at Nottingham is ... so it's obviously on the
                  telephone erm and it's on the telephone to a central computer
                  which holds quite a lot of information, it accesses
Frederick (PS0A8) [609] Quite.
Peter (PS0AA)     [610] it very very quickly
Frederick (PS0A8) [611] That's right, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [612] [...] so ... why shouldn't you telephone that computer?
                  [613] ... And the answer is, no reason at all.
                  [614] And if you're with National Westminster, you telephone
                  a, a n a number in Manchester or Birmingham or two or three
                  other places I guess but as far as we're concerned er the
                  Birmingham Manchester one's the cheapest ... you, you ring
                  them up and you give them A your identification number ...
                  and it immediately tells you what your balance is.
                  [615] Immediately.
                  [616] What do you want to do?
                  [617] Well of course there's a whole range of things you can
                  order, you know, chequebooks and bank statements, you can do
                  all s all sorts of things
Frederick (PS0A8) [618] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [619] you can do with the till in the wall
Frederick (PS0A8) [620] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [621] but you can also say I want a transaction too and the
                  machine then comes back to you with one of these sepulchral
                  voices, you know, which is tone
Frederick (PS0A8) [622] Yes
Peter (PS0AA)     [623] generated or whatever, who do you wish to pay to, and
                  ... we have four erm electricity board, the gas board, the er
                  er er ... credit card and the, can't remember what the fourth
                  one is, you simply say I wanna ... pay number four ... how
                  much do you wish to pay to the Royal Bank of Scotland ... and
                  you say how much you wish to pay in, er in pence ... and it
                  immediately says you wish to pay blah blah blah ... it will
                  be done.
                  [624] Couple of days later a little note comes in the post
                  saying that you've just paid the National West National Bank
                  [...] Bank of Scotland ... twenty three pounds thirty [laugh]
                  and it's absolutely brilliant!
                  [625] ... Barclays haven't got one yet?
Frederick (PS0A8) [626] Well er er I think not because I would have heard, I
                  mean obviously they would've er ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [627] Well er Nat West have been very quiet about Action Line
                  erm because they haven't quite got the ... the, the, all the
                  ... firmware sorted out yet but it's absolutely fantastic,
                  you know
Frederick (PS0A8) [628] Mm
Peter (PS0AA)     [629] it's just, just [...] erm ... but i i i er er have you
                  got a, a tone telephone or a pulse telephone?
                  [630] ... It's probably a switch
Frederick (PS0A8) [631] I've got several [laugh]
Peter (PS0AA)     [632] Well erm probably on the back you can select whether it
                  er sends a number by ... pulse, and you can tell actually cos
                  it's very ... you d you'll dial [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [633] Well the old dial was pulse ... was ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [634] The twiddle dial?
Frederick (PS0A8) [635] Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [636] Oh yes
Frederick (PS0A8) [637] Yeah, yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [638] but some push button telephones send ... one as one
                  pulse ... and two as two pulses
Frederick (PS0A8) [639] Yes.
Peter (PS0AA)     [640] whereas others send wuls er one as a beep and two as a
                  ooh
Frederick (PS0A8) [641] Ah
Peter (PS0AA)     [642] in other words the pitch of the
Frederick (PS0A8) [643] Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.
                  [644] I think mine are erm the pulse type, mm.
Peter (PS0AA)     [645] Well usually erm modern telephones have got a switch on
                  the back and you can switch them to pulse or tone
Frederick (PS0A8) [646] Oh?
                  [647] I don't think mine have. ...
Peter (PS0AA)     [648] One of those four switches across the top is the pulse
                  tone.
Frederick (PS0A8) [649] Oh yeah I can see that.
                  [650] ... Yeah.
Peter (PS0AA)     [651] But erm you bleep with one, one of ours is, is, is erm
                  on ... tones now and you can tell the diff you, you, you can

                                     [786] But it took her such a long while
                                     before she would sit ... in one of these.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [787] No I don't know.

Joan (PS0AB)                         [794] But we had two, two chairs, one
                                     there and one there and that one was the

Heidi (PS0AD)                        [930] No I was biting this one.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [931] So it's that one that needs filing?
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [932] They both need filing.

Vicki (PS0AC)                        [934] Well suppose he was having a shower

                                     Jenny.

Joan (PS0AB)                         [1449] Well she didn't persuade me but she
                                     said she thought it was a very good idea
                                     because it was ... on all the new sets and

Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1484] The thing that you you have to
                                     remember, which you tend not to at the
                                     beginning ... [cough] is that Ceefax is B
                                     B C for instance, so on one and two [sigh]
                                     now if you change channel ... if you're on
                                     teletext and you want to go onto Oracle
                                     which is on three
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1485] Three.

Joan (PS0AB)                         [1487] To change.

                                     teletext
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1489] Oh.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1490] you can't go direct.
                                     [1491] And that's er something that you
                                     tend to forget er initially, even, I mean
                                     I still sometimes still do.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1492] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1493] I was reading my instructions
                                     though and it said before you start
                                     pressing knobs
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1494] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1495] Please read the instructions.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1496] read it because you can do a lot of
                                     damage pressing the wrong things.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1497] Mm.

                                     granddaughter fiddle around with it?

Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1536] Thirty.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1537] two ... is it thirty or thirty two
                                     channels on it?
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1538] Thirty I think because it started
                                     at thirty when we pressed and went down
                                     [...]

Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1540] looking at the channels, I think
                                     that was only thirty channels.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1541] What make have you got?

                                     my Mitsibushi is.

Joan (PS0AB)                         [1549] Yes because on the remote control
                                     it's for a video as well you see
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1550] Mm.

Joan (PS0AB)                         [1551] but it doesn't work my video.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1552] You know if you have the telly on
                                     number eight ... so you were on the video
                                     channel?
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1553] Mm?
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1554] Do you use your video remote
                                     control?
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1555] Mm.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1556] That's okay then, I won't muck it
                                     up.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1557] Yes you can.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1558] But you can't use the video
                                     controls on the television panel
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1559] Not the video, you mustn't use the
                                     video bit

Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1562] No but you're on the video channel.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1563] No you must use the video remote
                                     control that goes with the video.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1564] That's what I mean.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1565] Yeah, yeah.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1566] If you're on the video channel and
                                     you want to change the channel
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1567] When Nana's got her Mitsibushi
                                     video then you can use it all on one.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1568] Then you use your video remote
                                     control, oh

Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1570] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1571] you must have the two separate
                                     ones.
                                     [1572] I don't want you messing it up.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1573] Yes, yes yes, yes!

Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1576] No [...] then I'll have that one.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1577] Do you know what she said Fred

                                     and becomes really famous ... and that
                                     special person's Michael Caine, it looked
                                     quite good.

                                     himself into a person.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1757] It was himself that changed.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1758] I thought it was a bit stupid cos

Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1797] But I'm thinking, I'm think I've
                                     got this terrible feeling I'd have to come
                                     on with the princess, if we've just got
                                     married
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [cough]

Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1803] Well perhaps you can.
                                     [1804] ... Princess and then, just shortly
                                     afterwards, Aladdin.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1805] Cos in Tom Sawyer ... we came on
                                     together didn't we?
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1806] Mm.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1807] Which wasn't too bad. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1808] I'll save you a bit
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1809] I thought she might have said
                                     something last year cos I was leaving.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1810] Well perhaps she thought you might
                                     change your mind. ...
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1811] Perhaps she thought you wouldn't
                                     really leave.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1812] She was wrong then. ...
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1813] Well are you making a guest
                                     appearance then?
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1814] Yeah.
                                     [1815] Cos she'd been wanting to do
                                     Aladdin for a couple of years but it was
                                     on at The Playhouse
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1816] And then it was on at the Theatre
                                     Royal.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1817] so she did Tom Sawyer, out of
                                     Huckleberry Finn.
                                     [1818] So that's the best one we've ever
                                     done
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1819] Huckleberry Finn, it was good
                                     wasn't it?
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1820] and then last year we did Peter Pan
                                     and I said right I'm leaving ... but she's
                                     always wanted
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1821] To do it.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1822] to do Aladdin so when she thought
                                     she'd do it this year she wanted me for
                                     Aladdin.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1823] Come on then, jump
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1824] For some silly reason [...]
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1825] come on then ... come on then ...
                                     come on.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1826] So we now have singing er
                                     rehearsals, you know er
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1827] But I cannae not sing
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1828] You can if you think about it.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1829] Not in tune to that one.
                                     [1830] [laughing] I was singing it []
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1831] Well we'll just have to get the
                                     music and
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1832] I was singing it in, not in my feet
                                     I was going [...] [singing very low] I was
                                     me going to do all the words
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1833] We'll see if we can get some music
                                     from the library, see if our library's got
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1834] [...] went down [...] into town
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1835] Yes but you, you have to buy the
                                     whole album and they hadn't got that in,
                                     they'd just sold out.
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1836] Did you see The Phantom music?
                                     [1837] I'd look at that.
                                     [1838] But it would be a bit hard.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1839] They hadn't any of er Lloyd
                                     Webber's music.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1840] Where did you try? ...
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1841] Foxes.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1842] Mm I was just wondering erm
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1843] Is there anywhere else?
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1844] Windblowers
Heidi (PS0AD)                        [1845] Shermans
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1846] Oh I
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1847] [...] seem to have gone down the
                                     drain a bit.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1848] Windblowers is right up [...] Road
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1849] Yes
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1850] isn't it?
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1851] The best thing to do is to ring
                                     first.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1852] I'll tell you where I had terrific
                                     service once, I can't remember what it was
                                     for now, it's ... it's a shop, it's called
                                     Arcade Records because originally it was
                                     in the arcade, but it's now just above the
                                     Cannon Cinema in between you know on
                                     Chapel Bar on the left hand side.
                                     [1853] And I wanted a particular tape, oh
                                     I know it was a tape I'd heard ... a coach
                                     driver using on the er on a coach trip
                                     that I was on ... so I got to know what it
                                     was ... erm and er I went round the usual
                                     shops no joy
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1854] Nothing.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1855] and no sort of interest in ... in
                                     trying to do anything about it
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1856] Yes that's the attitude isn't it,
                                     in the main.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1857] I went in to this fella ... er er
                                     er he seemed to know what I was talking
                                     about to start with
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1858] That's a good start, yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1859] and he said ah no problem I can
                                     order it for you if you'd like me to so I
                                     said I would and he said he'd phone me
                                     when er
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1860] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1861] when he er got it.
                                     [1862] And he either phoned me the
                                     following morning or if it wasn't the
                                     following morning it was the one after
                                     that.
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1863] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1864] That's good then.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1865] Mm I was very impressed.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1866] I can't remember seeing erm a music
                                     shop [...]
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1867] No you w

Vicki (PS0AC)                        [1870] [...] very often.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1871] You don't erm the other day I
                                     thought to myself ... I'll walk up, see if
                                     that shop's still there and by the time,
                                     you know er I was dreaming obviously, and
                                     I'd walked by, I'd got time actually, I
                                     was killing time so er ... I thought oh

                                     er found out, so I went back and it is
                                     there but it's not some, it's not a shop
Joan (PS0AB)                         [1872] That you'd notice.
Frederick (PS0A8)                    [1873] No, I mean he's got things that er
                                     he's got er CDs and things in the window

Frederick (PS0A8) [2401] Yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2402] I'm sure they will let you know. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2403] Cos when it first started I used to ... check in the
                  Sunday paper every day but er I dunno [laughing] it's a waste
                  of time [] .
                  [2404] They've got the address, they're supposed to let you
                  know when
Frederick (PS0A8) [2405] Yeah
Joan (PS0AB)      [2406] you come up.
                  [2407] ... I have a niece who ... erm she had quite a few,
                  she's won several times.
                  [2408] ... And it's a case of coals, taking coals to
                  Newcastle [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [2409] [laughing] Yeah [] yeah. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2410] But it would be quite nice to collect on, on
                  something.
                  [2411] But you get quite a lot of these ... erm I suppose
                  they're trying to promote what they're say selling ... you
                  are, you have been picked out of Nottingham
Frederick (PS0A8) [2412] [laughing] Yeah []
Joan (PS0AB)      [2413] to have these er four numbers, a chance to win about
                  twenty thousand.
                  [2414] ... I keep sending them back but [laughing] I haven't
                  got the twenty thousand [] yet.
                  [2415] ... Ah I did win s ... it was before, before Tasha and
                  John got married it was er one of these catalogues that came
                  through you see ... anyway I sent the thing back and I got
                  the catalogue and they wanted some things out and you get
                  twenty five pounds off whatever you ordered, the first order,
                  so quite alright ... but I did win something out of that draw
                  ... [laughing] twenty five P []
Frederick (PS0A8) [laugh]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2416] they sent me a cheque for twenty five P and I was
                  going to tear it up ... I thought well no I might as well put
                  it in the ... in the bank ... twenty five P.
                  [2417] And I waited till I'd got a few ... bit more money to
                  put in and sort of hid it amongst all these others, mm.
                  [2418] Yeah twenty five P I won on that one.
                  [2419] ... [talking to dog] What have you got your nose there
                  for?
                  [2420] ... But talk about a hassle ... they wanted, they,
                  well they picked the be the pr you know the present that you
                  c you claim erm, a deep fryer ... and I think it was in March
                  time ... and by July it still hadn't come in spite of ringing
                  and writing and everything else
Frederick (PS0A8) [2421] Really?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2422] and then they informed me that it was out of stock so
                  I wrote them rather a ... a polite [laughing] letter []
                  saying that it took them a long to realize it was out of
                  stock when it had been ordered in March ... and erm ... I
                  thought their communi communicative system in their office
                  was er non existent.
                  [2423] Anyway they said what else would they like and they
                  had some, a set of luggage, well it's only this nylon stuff
                  but it was very useful for them to take away with them ... it
                  did a bit of good the [...] and I, I put in this letter ... I
                  shall no longer order, I shall ... what was it?
                  [2424] I shall be very wary of having any contact with your
                  firm [laughing] again [] .
                  [2425] They're still pestering me, sending me letters and ...
                  we haven't heard from you recently
Frederick (PS0A8) [laugh]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2426] what would you like from [laughing] the catalogue sort
                  of thing [] and I only had this catalogue to [...] ... Cos I
                  pa you know I paid for it ... what di did they have?
                  [2427] Oh I think an electric drill ... it was in the sixties
                  ... so with the twenty five pounds off ... it brought it down
                  a bit and I, I paid for it with one cheque so I wasn't having
                  it on the weekly er ... er it worked out [...] I think Vicki
                  gave some of it towards it.
                  [2428] ... But I thought if that's how they run a business
                  ... So then when they, they moved house I realized they were
                  using an ordinary saucepan to do their chips in ... and I had
                  visions of fat boiling over and ... cos it's gas ... so I
                  bought them one a ... very nice deep fryer as a housewarming
                  present.
                  [2429] ... It came in very useful because they were quite a
                  while before the gas was connected.
                  [2430] ... But you've only got, if you w if you put ... chips
                  in a basket in a ... chip pan if it, the fat boils up you can
                  at least lift the chips out straight away but if you're
                  putting them straight into the pan there's no hope of
                  stopping it coming over.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2431] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2432] Oh I kept thinking of this fire hazard ... thought I
                  can't, I can't [laughing] live with that any longer
Frederick (PS0A8) [laugh]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2433] with the thought of them using a saucepan.
                  [2434] ... Cos they hadn't seen any danger to it I suppose.
                  [2435] ... So then John, he tries all sorts of things out,
                  you know doughnuts and ... things like that and it's a
                  thermostatically controlled
Frederick (PS0A8) [2436] Yeah
Joan (PS0AB)      [2437] one so he knows what the temperature's going to be and
                  er he's ... I think he's quite enjoyed experimenting with it.
                  [2438] ... They've got quite a nice ... it's not a large
                  house but it's a good size ... lounge and dining room and
                  kitchen.
                  [2439] The bathroom is downstairs but there are three
                  bedrooms so it's quite a decent ... size for them.
                  [2440] ... But the base of the bed is still in the dining
                  room, they can't get it up [laughing] up the stairs [] ...
                  although i although it folds up, you know, it's [laughing]
                  it's standing like this in [] in the dining room.
                  [2441] ... The cat er likes it there, it goes and sits on the
                  top of it.
                  [2442] ... [shouting] You're not cooking are you?
                  [2443] ... Vicki [] ?
                  [2444] ... Sh she got the door closed? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [2445] Sounds though er soun well
Joan (PS0AB)      [2446] She gets in that kitchen you know and
Frederick (PS0A8) [2447] sounds like ...

Vicki (PS0AC)     [2453] No.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2454] Oh.
                  [2455] What are you busy doing?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2456] I've just washed the wine glasses out.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2457] Oh well I would have come and done those [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2458] Ah there's only four.
                  [2459] I've done them now.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2460] Oh right.
                  [2461] ... Being lazy.
                  [2462] I had such a lazy week ... Christmas week ... I went
                  down to er Northamptonshire to my son's.
                  [2463] All I did was [laughing] wash up [] and we didn't do
                  anything else.
                  [2464] Talk about being lazy.
                  [2465] They wouldn't let me do a thing.
                  [2466] ... Never went out till Friday because it was, they
                  went walking but it was so windy cos ... they're here and the
                  garden's sort of down to a field and then it's all fields and
                  fields and fields and the wind just ... comes across like
                  gales all the time.
                  [2467] ... I think I've never spent such a lazy week. ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [2468] Were you here at Christmas?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2469] No.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2470] You were down there?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2471] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2472] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2473] Went on the Saturday.
                  [2474] They came up to view Heidi's riding display then I
                  went back with them and Vicki and Malcolm diverted from
                  Barford on the Sunday where they'd been for lunch and picked
                  me up Sunday afternoon the sort of following weekend.
                  [2475] ... First time I hadn't spent Christmas with Vicki I
                  think since they were married.
                  [2476] ... We went to the theatre in London on the Friday
                  night.
                  [2477] ... They have erm ... what's called the players'
                  theatre, I don't know whether you've heard of it at all erm
                  they belong, they're members of it.
                  [2478] It's only the ground floor, really, and it is set out
                  with a bar at the back and refreshments like the old music
                  halls used to be with every so often, every few seats there
                  is a table so that it's a thing to have your drink and
                  refreshments to hand at the table.
                  [2479] And before the proceedings you drink the health to
                  Queen Victoria
Frederick (PS0A8) [2480] [laughing] Oh yes []
Joan (PS0AB)      [2481] and it's a, an old fashioned music hall, more often
                  than not well ... when we went it was a pantomime but the
                  first ... part of the evening was an o a music hall
Frederick (PS0A8) [2482] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2483] type of entertainment, then it was a pantomime, Beauty
                  and the Beast, but they keep as near to the original script
                  as they can always, well it was written eighteen fourteen or
                  something.
                  [2484] [...] quite entertaining.
                  [2485] ... And you sing chorus so you know they give you a
                  song sheet and you sing then.
                  [2486] ... It's very expensive to ... for what it is, I mean
                  it's fifteen pounds a ticket but if you, if you're a member
                  of course you get in reduced
Frederick (PS0A8) [2487] Yes.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2488] But you've got to, Terence said it's so dear to be a
                  member you have got to keep going to get your, your money
                  back.
                  [2489] ... But it's, it's a nice homely ... it's all been
                  refurbished in the last year.
                  [2490] ... And they've made a very nice restaurant on the top
                  floor.
                  [2491] Only a very small one but it's very nice ... nice
                  food.
                  [2492] ... Then when we came out we s went ... [...] around
                  London to see the sights but ... the decorations but why we
                  went I didn't think anything to them at all this year.
                  [2493] ... Cos we didn't get ou we didn't ... fin it didn't
                  finish till about
Frederick (PS0A8) [cough]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2494] well half past ten ... if not later so we were late
                  getting home.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2495] Mm. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2496] But they pop down to London as though it's ... down
                  [laughing] into town but [] ... They're quite near the
                  motorway so it's useful.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2497] Yes well I've often said Northampton's about the right
                  distance.
                  [2498] Er y y
Joan (PS0AB)      [2499] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2500] you can, it's within striking distance isn't it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2501] Yes.
                  [2502] ... It doesn't take them long at all to get in the
                  outskirts of London, it's weaving your way
Frederick (PS0A8) [2503] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2504] through when you've got there.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2505] Yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [laugh] [...] ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2506] Well her mum's knee wasn't there so she thought she
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2507] Ah!
Joan (PS0AB)      [2508] she might as well sit on her gran's
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2509] Her mum's knee will be back.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2510] on her gran's knee.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2511] Mum's knee will be back.
                  [2512] Ah! [...] somebody else's knee?
                  [2513] ... Don't want [...] do you Luce? ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2514] Is his eye running again?
                  [2515] I think he must have a bit of cold in it or something.
                  [2516] Have you still got a hair in ... from your
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2517] Haircut.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2518] haircut?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2519] This weather's enough to give anybody a cold eye isn't
                  it?
                  [2520] Mm?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2521] Well we set out with the good intention of taking her
                  for a long walk this morning but er ... we changed our mind
                  didn't we? ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2522] Didn't do, didn't think it would do you any good did
                  we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2523] Oh it was so damp and ooh and miserable
Frederick (PS0A8) [2524] Oh it was miserable yeah.
                  [2525] Yesterday it was very cold but it was very nice
Joan (PS0AB)      [2526] Yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2527] and dry wasn't it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2528] Yes I, I walked from er where was it, Langmere Lane?
                  ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2529] Walked from ... [...] road ... [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2530] Well wasn't, isn't that Langmere Lane where you park
                  the car?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2531] No Langmere Lane's the other side of the garage. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2532] Well what's that lane called then? ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2533] Tt that goes into Compton Acres doesn't it?
                  [2534] I don't know what that's called. [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2535] [...] car conked out so Vicki stayed with the car and
                  her who we were going to take a walk in Ruddington, and I
                  walked home with her to get Malcolm to ... go over with the
                  other car.
                  [2536] And it was quite ni actually although I was hurrying
                  because I thought of them sitting in the car erm it was very
                  pleasant walking, very slippery though along by Walford
                  cemetery and all down there.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2537] You really stepped out.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2538] Yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2539] Nice crisp morning wasn't it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2540] It was a pleasant morning for walking, it would have
                  been quite ... nice [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2541] But it was cold [...] waited.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2542] Well you were frozen weren't you waiting?
                  [2543] Cold day, it was me that ... but I think with hurrying
                  so, quite a good walk.
                  [2544] It's alright when I first got in then after a while my
                  legs [laughing] all started going wobbly [] .
Frederick (PS0A8) [2545] Oh yeah. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2546] But Saturday mornings we usually [cough] drop Heidi
                  don't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2547] Yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2548] [cough] And then go in the
Joan (PS0AB)      [2549] The building and leisure centre
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2550] park.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2551] leisure park at Ruddington and they've got a quite a
                  lot
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2552] Paths and
Joan (PS0AB)      [2553] yes of intersecting paths haven't they?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2554] And it's just opposite where we drop Heidi, we used to
                  walk along the road ... it doesn't really lead anywhere only
                  to a couple of farms does it?
                  [2555] But if we go in the park she can run more, or in the
                  summer we go down by the old railway track don't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2556] Yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2557] Go through the farm and ... go along there.
                  [2558] See the flowers and listen to the birds.
                  [2559] Don't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2560] But you had a walk on your lead yesterday didn't you?
                  [2561] ... And this morning we got as far as [...] didn't we?
                  [2562] Went in for a hot chocolate and that was it we didn't
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2563] And then we just
Joan (PS0AB)      [2564] well we did [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2565] we walked outside didn't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2566] Yeah
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2567] So she could come off the lead.
                  [2568] But it was so damp and cold and not nice was it? ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2569] She enjoys herself cos she chases around all the beds
                  doesn't she there and
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2570] She doesn't go far she just, she just ... doesn't
                  bother anybody else.
                  [2571] ... Do you?
                  [2572] ... And Heidi was going to phone to say what time she
                  wanted collecting and so we'd got to be back ... couldn't be
                  out too long could we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2573] No.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2574] And leave the
Joan (PS0AB)      [2575] We needn't have bothered though need we?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2576] No!
                  [2577] By the look of it.
                  [2578] ... Cos she asked last night, I was supposed to be
                  taking Jenny and then when Fay came she asked me if I'd take
                  Fay as well today so ... it looks as though Charlotte's mum
                  did everybody took everybody home.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2579] Mm.
                  [2580] Well it's an awkward time to ... ask people to go and
                  fetch them when they're ... if they're preparing dinner isn't
                  it?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2581] Most people don't have a Sunday dinner as they ...
                  used to.
                  [2582] I don't think it is a traditional
Frederick (PS0A8) [2583] Not ... I don't think it is.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2584] No.
                  [2585] It is
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2586] Mind you [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2587] when you go to our morning service it is. [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8) [2588] [laughing] Exactly [] .
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2589] Well we always used to have what I call a traditional
                  Sunday dinner
Joan (PS0AB)      [2590] Yes we did.
                  [2591] Father used to [laughing] like that so []
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2592] but ... well sometimes we still do but sometimes we
                  have something else ... instead don't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2593] Totally different, yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2594] Yes. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2595] Lives have changed.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2596] Yeah, all changed.
                  [2597] ... But I think there are a lot of people that don't
                  have a Sunday dinner, whatever ... form.
                  [2598] ... Think there are a lot of children that just have,
                  well I think they must just live on snacks, they just ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [2599] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2600] [...] something here, beans on toast, open a packet of
                  this, tin of that and ... or a take away or ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2601] Pizza or
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2602] mm. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2603] We went to church last ... Sunday didn't we?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2604] Mhm
Frederick (PS0A8) [yawn]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2605] Well it's the first time I've been
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2606] This year.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2607] Well you're right yes, it would be this year ... but I
                  didn't go much at the end of last year did I? ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2608] No well you were away ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [2609] I was away and then I had that awful little cough ...
                  first thing in the morning ... erm ... and I think I, to be
                  quite honest, I lost interest in going. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2610] Well last Sunday it seemed to be going quite nicely to
                  start with, trying to think what it was, communion
Joan (PS0AB)      [2611] It was Carole
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2612] [...] communion yes
Joan (PS0AB)      [2613] Carole [...] she's normally very interesting but she
                  was ... very hard to hear.
                  [2614] Carole .
                  [2615] Malcolm said it was
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2616] .
                  [2617] Well she was
Joan (PS0AB)      [2618] very good didn't he?
                  [2619] But he was sitting underneath her.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2620] Yeah but we'd got erm tt oh, Leo at the side of us ...
                  so he was, do you know the that do christian [...] ?
Frederick (PS0A8) [2621] No I know of them.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2622] Yeah what's her name?
                  [2623] Sandra
Joan (PS0AB)      [2624] Sa Sandra ... Sandra I think it is, Sandra ... [...]
                  ... You couldn't hear anything could you?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2625] He was chattering away, dad was replying to him, he
                  was up and down the steps, shuffling on the carpet and
Joan (PS0AB)      [2626] They were having this game, you know, one hand on top
                  of the other so
Frederick (PS0A8) [2627] Oh!
Joan (PS0AB)      [2628] it was clapping and
Frederick (PS0A8) [2629] [laughing] Oh dear []
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2630] And you just ... But as we were saying er talking to
                  Janet afterwards ... there was another little one down at the
                  side, erm mum was getting a bit irate with him, but you see
                  they don't take anything for the children to do.
                  [2631] I mean you can't expect them to be quiet, just sit and
                  do nothing all that time.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2632] That's right.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2633] It didn't finish till five to twelve did it last ...
                  Sunday?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2634] Well that's ... early, I should have thought it was
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2635] Was it after that?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2636] Well I thought it was, yes.
                  [2637] It might have been [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2638] Well you can't expect them to just ... sit.
                  [2639] I mean fair enough you can't expect them to be quiet.
                  [2640] But ... I think the parents should ... take something
                  for them to do, I mean we used to take colouring books and
                  books for the children to look at and
Frederick (PS0A8) [2641] Yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2642] whatever so there was something to keep them occupied
                  and erm ... you know have a bag and as soon as they got fed
                  up with that right you'd get something else out to take their
                  interest and
Joan (PS0AB)      [2643] Well Peter did remark to this lady didn't he?
                  [2644] Who's child was making a dickens of a commotion
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2645] Noise, that the creche was in the [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2646] Yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2647] and she did actually take him out at one time
Joan (PS0AB)      [2648] But she looked
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2649] she looked absolute daggers when she took him out
                  didn't she?
                  [2650] And then she came in.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2651] Yes and he
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2652] And he'd got a car
Joan (PS0AB)      [2653] that he'd got out of the creche I think, cos he hadn't
                  got it when he went out.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2654] No, and of course he was running that along the seat
Joan (PS0AB)      [2655] And dropping [laughing] it [] .
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2656] and dropping it off the seat and whatever.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2657] But Leo hadn't got anything but he certainly made
                  enough noise, oh dear.
                  [2658] So what with Carole's soft voice and that we didn't
                  get a lot of ... and it seemed as though it was well like
                  that, several times I went last year and I really got ... a
                  bit cheesed off.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2659] Oh er yes I was going to say we suddenly heard a
                  chorus didn't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2660] Oh yes that was it.
                  [2661] Oh well we've got [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2662] There are quite a few children in here, let's have
                  some choruses.
                  [2663] ... I don't like that.
                  [2664] ... You're all in the mood and [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2665] along this line and then all of a sudden it's ... yes
                  that's right it was before
Joan (PS0AB)      [2666] Communion, yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2667] we'd had the collection ... and then it was all
                  choruses and then it was oh where were we, he'd, then he'd
                  forgotten his glasses, couldn't find his glasses, what page
                  were we
Joan (PS0AB)      [2668] Didn't know where he was.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2669] [laughing] Oh dear [] .
                  [2670] And then we went back to the prayer after the
                  collection didn't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2671] Mm.
                  [2672] ... Where are my glasses?
                  [2673] So somebody had to tell him he'd left them at the
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2674] Altar.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2675] altar. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2676] So it was ... we'd got distractions and then we
                  suddenly chip in with all these choruses ... er ... no!
                  [2677] Didn't go down too well with me that didn't [...] .
                  [2678] On a family service fair enough, when you've got the
                  family service and it's all
Frederick (PS0A8) [2679] Yeah, mm, right.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2680] you know, bits of this and bits of that but there
                  again I think the family service ought to be a lot shorter
                  than it is
Joan (PS0AB)      [2681] Well it certainly should be because it's for the
                  families, for the young children and they, they can't
                  understand what it, all of it is about so ... it should be
                  kept as simple and as short as possible.
                  [2682] ... And the ch and the children should have their own
                  address.
                  [2683] Er well one address that is suitable for children.
                  [2684] Grown ups can sit and listen to it all close their
                  ears.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2685] Probably get far more response from the grown ups
Joan (PS0AB)      [2686] Erm but some of these childrens' addresses that we've
                  had at St Paul's ... they are very interesting and you get
                  something out of them.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2687] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2688] I miss going to St Paul's really.
                  [2689] Well we did go there one Sunday didn't we?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2690] Mm.
                  [2691] Was that when Malcolm was away?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2692] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2693] We could have gone today.
                  [2694] We went on poppy day.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2695] That was it.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2696] Didn't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2697] We used to go once a month you know when the girls
                  were in the Guides, used to go for their parade service and
                  if you were at Auckley, Malcolm and I used to go up with
                  Heidi didn't I?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2698] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2699] Walk up.
                  [2700] ... And we got to know all the people there.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2701] Mm.
                  [2702] ... And we went there for the Christmas one didn't we?
                  [2703] ... The midnight service.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2704] Well I didn't cos I wasn't here.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2705] Oh no.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2706] No that's one thing I missed about Christmas.
                  [2707] ... Going to [...] .
                  [2708] Well Jane did say ... no I don't think there's one in
                  the village but if you want to go to one I'll take you to ...
                  [...] Daventry would be nearest, yes, but she said I'll take
                  you to one if you want to go. ... [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2709] Yeah I think we went in November to er St Paul's
                  didn't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2710] Mm.
                  [2711] Well you can fit so much in to an hour ... I mean it's
                  not rushed.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2712] And it's for the children. [cough]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2713] But it never lasts more than an hour whatever he does.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2714] Yes Peter goes on and on and on.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2715] Yes er and of course i if er rather like it seems as
                  happened last week, if he seems to have got a bit of time he
                  seems to need to have to extend it
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2716] Fill it.
Frederick (PS0A8) [2717] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2718] Yes he's not going to finish before twelve o'clock at
                  the earliest, choose what.
                  [2719] ... I don't know whose idea it is that it goes on and
                  on.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2720] Yeah the eight thirty, the eight o'clock service is a
                  lot more ... seems a lot more compact, I know you haven't got
                  the hymns, but it seems to erm start, go on and finish, you
                  know it
Frederick (PS0A8) [2721] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2722] it's all there
Joan (PS0AB)      [2723] But that Sat Sunday when Hazel was here ... and I, and
                  she didn't want to go so I said I'd stay with her and cook
                  the dinner ... when y when you came back you said it's a good
                  job you didn't come, it didn't finish till half past ...
                  twelve and you came straight home and you were here about
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2724] Oh that's right.
                  [2725] What ha what was that Sunday? [...] and then something
                  extra, yes.
                  [2726] That was a long one wasn't it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2727] I know when you came in you said well it's a good job
                  you didn't come.
                  [2728] ... Can't remember, cos I don't think you stayed for
                  coffee and you didn't get home till ... it was about ten to
                  one wasn't it?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2729] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2730] Cos everything was cooked when you
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2731] Mm can't remember now.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2732] when you got here.

                  long their services go on, it's about three hours, but he

                  walk out and have a break if they want to [laughing] and then
                  go back in [] .

Vicki (PS0AC)     [2826] Well that bluey-green does go.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2827] It does, if you can get anything else to match it.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2828] Well I'll see if I can get some candles ... that
                  colour.

Joan (PS0AB)      [2840] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2841] For our old age, this is.
                  [2842] ... The other one was getting a bit low for us.
                  [2843] Wasn't it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2844] Yes.
                  [2845] ... It wasn't that the springs had gone it was just
                  low when y when you had it wasn't it?
                  [2846] Keep still Lucy. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2847] Oh [laugh] and, well it must've been since we were at
                  Malton so we'd've had it, what, about four ... three or four
                  ... years when we went to Malton?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2848] Yo you had it in Slay Drive didn't you?
                  [2849] No, not Slay Drive, at er Paddock, The Paddocks.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2850] No we'd only had it three or four years [...] when we
                  went to Malton ... and Pam said then ... ooh if ever you get
                  rid of this just let me know, it's just right for me cos
                  she's only short isn't she?
Joan (PS0AB)      [2851] She's only short you see.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2852] And she said so many chairs are so deep that my legs
                  are dangling, she said whereas this one, it's so comfortable
                  and I can get my feet on the floor.
                  [2853] Erm ... and it must have been ... oh I don't know, two
                  or three years ago ... must be at least two or three years
                  ago when we were talking about, umm-ing and ah-ing, and she
                  said well don't forget if ever you want to lose this just let
                  me know.
                  [2854] [phone rings] Erm, yes, right, no we ... shan't be
                  losing it and of course when we decided, rang her up, oh
                  great, so at last I can have my [laughing] chair [] . [goes
                  to answer phone]
Frederick (PS0A8) [laugh]
Joan (PS0AB)      [2855] Well she was gonna have the three piece suite actually
                  but she lives in a bungalow and of course the settee was a
                  six foot settee which they don't make now
Frederick (PS0A8) [2856] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [2857] and she found that she couldn't get the settee and the
                  chairs in because, if you remember, they were sort of open
                  armed, they, they were very wide.
                  [2858] So anyway she had the er settee and brought a friend
                  with her with a ... well I think it was one of these Range
                  Rovers that you can seat erm, you know, about seven and he
                  dropped the seats down and got the settee in, I don't know
                  how he managed it.

                  erm ... was it the homeless, was it Shelter, one of those
                  organizations and they came and picked them up.
                  [2860] Which, gonna say the chairs, they went to an
                  organization didn't they?
                  [2861] It was ... Samaritans, no.

                  [2871] When we first had it, when we sat on it [] .
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2872] But it's not as hard as one that we tried cos we
                  wanted a firm one, she wanted something firm but nice and
                  high.

                  the one we tried in the shop didn't feel like this but
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2877] And you can just put your head back and close your
                  eyes and that's it.

                  about her, is she allowed on the settee now.
                  [2888] I said oh goodness yes, that's why they bought a
                  leather one [laughing] so she could go on it [] .
Vicki (PS0AC)     [2889] Well no, it wasn't really! ...

                  and he said it was the best type of ... covering if you've
                  got dogs ... or cats. ...

Vicki (PS0AC)                        [3017] Perhaps perhaps her mother used to
                                     sing it to her did she?
Joan (PS0AB)                         [3018] Who?
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [3019] Your mother's mother used to sing

Joan (PS0AB)                         [3023] Not that I can sing but it was er
                                     an apology for singing.
Vicki (PS0AC)                        [3024] [laughing] Well perhaps that's why

                  it's not as late as that is it ... eighteenth, nineteenth,
                  twentieth, twenty one ... about the twenty second, something
                  like that.
                  [3070] ... It's usually the last Saturday of the half term
                  because then she can have them during the week to practise.

Joan (PS0AB)      [3072] Well the, all the others go on a Saturday but Heidi
                  said she would be in it if she didn't have to go on Saturday,
                  every Saturday, because she goes riding you see at nine
                  o'clock ... nine till ... four ... so er Wendy said oh she'll

                  [] but when it got going a bit it was better but ... the
                  whole moral of the story was that nowhere is perfect to live

                  to []

                  beforehand and the, the answers are always written out for
                  them ... erm ... but I, I wouldn't have thought all the
                  answers because some of them come over quite spontaneously.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3173] Yeah, yeah bu yeah, but they are rehearsing for
                  [laughing] two and a half hours [] .
                  [3174] They don't see the person ... they don't see the er
                  ... the they're kept separate but erm the they are ...
                  rehearsed.
                  [3175] So er,y you know.
                  [3176] An an and I could erm ... I, I erm her name was
                  Barbara erm ... Actually it was rather interesting there a oh
                  have you remembered the name of that club?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3177] No.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3178] I would know it if you told me.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3179] Well I can see it on [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3180] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3181] Yeah.
                  [3182] A anyway it doesn't matter.
                  [3183] Er but she's a member and we went there for lunch and
                  it was the ideal place, you know, cos there weren't any, many
                  people around and so we had quite a nice lunch ... and erm
                  whilst we were there we then had a drink in er in the bar and
                  erm her ... the, the secretary of the club, a lady, came to
                  talk to Barbara and she mentioned that she'd seen her on
                  Blind Date you see, and so I got to know more by listening to
                  them two speaking er and er that's where I learnt about er
                  that.
                  [3184] Erm ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3185] Well some of the questions you think erm ... you think
                  erm ... you know, aren't they a bit well way out or ... what
                  made them ask that.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3186] Well I've said all along
Frederick (PS0A8) [3187] Yeah and so and some of the answers.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3188] how do they think up those answers in such a
Frederick (PS0A8) [3189] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3190] short time but er
Frederick (PS0A8) [3191] Yeah, yeah yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3192] now we know.
                  [3193] ... It takes some of the erm ... tt ... oh what's,
                  what's the word?
                  [3194] When er
Vicki (PS0AC)     [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [3195] No.
                  [3196] When you, when you think that they're racking their
                  brains and it
Frederick (PS0A8) [3197] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3198] seems far more interesting than knowing that they've
                  rehearsed for hours on end.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3199] I think sometimes the odd er the odd times people are
Joan (PS0AB)      [3200] Putting a bit more
Frederick (PS0A8) [3201] Yeah,a and in fact in the programme I ... th the one
                  that Barbara was in, I can remember the er, as it happens, I,
                  I was out er when that programme came on and I taped it so I
                  s I, I've still got that particular programme, and the lady
                  at the end ... er on one of her questions she'd obviously
                  forgotten what she was going to say er and sort of made
                  something up and er she turned to er as they were just
                  panning away from her, she turned to her next door neighbour
                  and more or less said ... I forgot what I was going to say,
                  you know.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3202] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3203] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3204] Cos they don't have any notes or anything do they?
                  [3205] So
Frederick (PS0A8) [3206] No, no, no, oh no I mean er ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3207] It's supposed to look natural [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3208] Yes, yes a and erm ... oh yes I mean some of the
                  things that, especially the er the more senior people now ...
                  th those people on the erm programme last night, did you see
                  it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3209] Yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3210] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3211] Yeah,
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3212] Clarence.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3213] Yeah ... er they, they wouldn't have come out with
                  some of the things about er ... I can't remember what was
                  said that erm you know er wouldn't mind meeting you in the
                  bath or
Joan (PS0AB)      [3214] Yes or under the shower, yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3215] we w that, that, that s you know that s yeah, that
                  sort of thing erm ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3216] I think they are a bit er ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [3217] Yes.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3218] I suppose that's just [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3219] I mean it, oh yes I mean actually
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3220] Make it lighthearted.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3221] actually erm the, the er it is a very good, from the
                  television people's point of view, it is an excellent
                  programme because i y people are interested aren't they?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3222] Yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3223] A and furthermore they're interested in, in the way
                  out somebody and that, in fact I think
Joan (PS0AB)      [3224] Looks a little bit different.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3225] they sometimes manipulate [laughing] the questions so
                  that the person picks
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3226] To make them [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3227] the right one that they would like to be picked [] .
                  [3228] Do you know what I mean?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3229] [...] yeah yeah, could be.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3230] Erm oh did you, did you see the one with that, it was
                  last week when they came back I think, that naive bloke, lad
                  from Devon?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3231] Oh yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3232] [sigh] Dear oh dear oh dear!
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3233] Was that the one where the girl was a
Frederick (PS0A8) [3234] Nurse.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3235] A nurse or d yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3236] and she was only a bit older?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3237] Yeah.
                  [3238] That's the one
Joan (PS0AB)      [3239] Yes his
Frederick (PS0A8) [3240] that's the one.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3241] He was eighteen and she was nineteen or something
Joan (PS0AB)      [3242] And she kept saying how childish he was.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3243] Yeah, oh it was predictable that wasn't go to work.
                  [3244] He was wasn't he?
                  [3245] Very immature. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3246] How ... far ... in front of us seeing it is it erm
                  recorded?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3247] Erm ... I think Barbara, I think it was July when she
                  did it.
                  [3248] ... So that would be, and that would be about either
                  November or December wouldn't it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3249] Yes. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3250] Cos I suppose they do so many recordings and then
                  screen them don't they?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3251] Yeah, yeah
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3252] Sort of for the series and then, then there's a break.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3253] Well Cilla Black's one of the highest paid ... erm ...
                  presenters isn't she?
                  [3254] On the television.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3255] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3256] Esther Rantzen for the B B C and Cilla Black I think
                  on the A T V.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3257] The erm ... did you see the one where ... this was er
                  er for the more senior ones again, er about the fifty mark,
                  where the fellow was a hypnotist and ... a very nice fella
Joan (PS0AB)      [3258] I can remember now you say hypnotist but I can't
                  remember what happened in the programme but I can remember
                  him.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3259] and er she was er the one he
Joan (PS0AB)      [3260] Because they were on about, in the answers, about him
                  hypnotizing them, one of them was especially.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3261] Oh, and the, the trip they had was to er ... the
                  Middle East, erm ... in the desert
Joan (PS0AB)      [3262] I didn't see that.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3263] Oh you didn't see it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3264] Ah.
                  [3265] Oh well er what I was going to say is that er ... I
                  thought I'd summed the person up that he'd selected and I, I
                  thought oh she i er it's not gonna be easy for him, and it
                  wasn't, you know, she was a bit of a ... bit of a so and so I
                  think really.
                  [3266] ... Full of her own importance, you know?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3267] Yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3268] I often wonder if, when they've selected ... a person
                  say right, I'll choose number three, when number one goes by
                  and number two goes by afterwards if they think oh you know,
                  no, I would have preferred number two.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3269] Oh they would, I'm sure a lot of that's done.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3270] Well do they
Joan (PS0AB)      [3271] Wonder if they have a, a, a chance
Vicki (PS0AC)     [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [3272] of meeting up with them.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3273] afterwards.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3274] Well I heard, I, I wondered about that, and ... erm I
                  think they must have contact because ... erm one of them who
                  came back ... bearing in mind there must be a, a, a, about a
                  three month gap, had had a proposal from one of the persons
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3275] One of the others.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3276] who er she didn't pick.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3277] Oh.
                  [3278] ... Mm. ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3279] But sometimes you can see ooh that one and that one
                  who just go together and they don't choose each other
Frederick (PS0A8) [3280] Yeah, yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3281] and then when they
Joan (PS0AB)      [3282] And you're sitting here going oh choose so and so, you
                  choose him [laughing] don't you [] ?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3283] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3284] Yeah [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3285] But, but from the programme producer's point of view,
                  I should think he, he doesn't want too many that are okay, he
                  wants the er
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3286] But it would be nice to get [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3287] Yeah yeah, yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3288] I mean just lately they seem to ... they really slang
                  each other don't they?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3289] Mm, mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3290] I of er, was it last week erm, yeah it must have been
                  where the ... the coloured lad
Joan (PS0AB)      [3291] Yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3292] cos he was back last night wasn't he?
                  [3293] Two white lads and a coloured one and er it was a
                  white girl and I often wonder if that's a good idea ... er
                  whether they should all be the same colour.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3294] Oh I think so because it must be an awful shock ...
                  for the girl to ... go round the screen and they're faced
                  with a coloured ... although they don't bother so much these
                  days do they?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3295] No.
                  [3296] She said he wasn't ugly enough didn't she?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3297] [laugh] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3298] But a few ... well I was gonna say a few weeks ago, it
                  might be longer than that, there was that very ... large
                  coloured girl that was on
Frederick (PS0A8) [3299] That's a few years ago, never mind a few months.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3300] No er [laughing] there was one [] not so very ... I'm
                  sure not so ve not, not years ago but it was
Frederick (PS0A8) [3301] Yo do you there was one ... very bonny lass and she
                  was on the er, they, they had erm ... composite programme the
                  other ... the other week and she was on that again.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3302] Oh is that where I saw her?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3303] Maybe.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [3304] I mean fancy being erm confronted with somebody like
                  ... like that.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3305] And in and actually in that programme it was a
                  Nottingham fella who er [laughing] was confronted with her []

Joan (PS0AB)      [3306] Was it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3307] Yeah.
                  [3308] So, yeah, she's a real extrovert.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3309] And then there's that er one who was a pu
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3310] That was a little while ago, that was big [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [3311] she was big but she was wasn't coloured was she?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3312] No, but she ran a pub or something
Joan (PS0AB)      [3313] So she was [...] .
                  [3314] Somewhere, yes.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3315] managed a pub and she was all ... all over.
                  [3316] ... Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3317] But one, one of the coloured chaps where Tasha works
                  said he was ... he'd been to one of these Blind Dates, he was
                  on but we haven't come across him yet have we? ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3318] But he only said that a little while ago didn't he?
                  [3319] So if there's a three month
Joan (PS0AB)      [3320] Yes, he might be
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3321] gap. ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [3322] Actually erm ... Barbara took, went with her niece to,
                  for the audition and er what I'm not sure of,a a and [laugh]
                  Barbara got on and her niece didn't, what I'm not sure is
                  whether, when she went down, she was thinking that, of sort
                  of er an audition for herself or whether they approached her
                  because apparently they, they don't get too many of the
                  senior people.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3323] Oh.
                  [3324] ... No it's, it's not often really that you get a ...
                  senior
Frederick (PS0A8) [3325] In fact Barbara was saying to me er [laughing] wh why
                  don't you [] er but it's not the thing that I'd want to do.
                  ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3326] Nice to have them now and again.
                  [3327] ... Mm [...] ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3328] Did you see erm Wendy?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3329] No she, I think she was coming in and out cos the car
                  door was open.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3330] So you don't know what time Heidi's
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3331] Half past four.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3332] Half past four.
                  [3333] Oh she's
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3334] And erm
Joan (PS0AB)      [3335] late this week is she?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3336] Well she was only early ... was it last week or the
                  week before?
                  [3337] Whenever she was early because there was a christening
                  erm on and they were using the hall afterwards.
                  [3338] And you know the door they go in
Joan (PS0AB)      [3339] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3340] to er ... that little side door?
                  [3341] Well there were all blue and white balloons hanging up
                  in the hall and by the door just these rows and rows of blue
                  balloons and the door opens outwards
Frederick (PS0A8) [laugh]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3342] and Wendy was saying how was she going to get the door
                  open without all these balloons
Joan (PS0AB)      [3343] Going.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3344] coming out, yeah. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3345] So no doubt it was a boy ... that was being
                  christened.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3346] I would think so, blue, yeah.
                  [3347] So they decided that once the ... christening party
                  was in the hall which was gonna be three o'clock, they didn't
                  stand much chance of erm
Joan (PS0AB)      [3348] Doing anything.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3349] No, so that's why they had it two till three that ...
                  day.
                  [3350] But it's now back to half past two till half past four
                  and whoever's playing the dame arrived just in front of us
Joan (PS0AB)      [3351] Oh.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3352] so he's there.
                  [3353] ... Tt what did Malcolm say?
                  [3354] It was five ... five weeks, four weeks on Friday till
                  half term?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3355] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3356] Four weeks on Friday, that's all she's got to ...
                  [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [3357] Yeah
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3358] sort it out. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3359] Oh if I go into town ... perhaps Tuesday ... to get
                  her tape ... try to get her tape
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3360] Well she said it's in H V M.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3361] erm ... I'll perhaps give ... Wind , what are they
                  called?
                  [3362] Windblowers a ring and see if they've got
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3363] For the music.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3364] Mm.
                  [3365] ... I could [...] actually tomorrow to see if it's in
                  the library couldn't I?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3366] Mm and then just photocopy it.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3367] Oh you're not allowed to are you?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3368] Well they won't know will they?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3369] Oh well [...] yeah I'd have to bring it home to have
                  it done.
                  [3370] [...] ... Breaking the law, isn't it?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3371] Well I think it's only if you ... want to do er ...
                  you know like [...] doing it for some, something or other
                  isn't it? ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3372] No when [...] used to get music for the Women's Own
                  choir to do for Mothering Sunday, she used to say keep quiet
                  where you got the copy from.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3373] Mm, I think it's when you want a lot.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3374] Or say if you've got a ... [...] ten or eleven running
                  off.
                  [3375] ... Anyway I'll go in and steal it.
                  [3376] ... We walked past that place didn't we?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3377] H V M?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3378] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3379] We were on our way down to [...] ... but we weren't
                  actually sure
Joan (PS0AB)      [3380] What it was called.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3381] Mm, so it wouldn't have been any good going in.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3382] Although you'd of probably recognized it.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3383] Well I said I thought it was called Seriously
                  Orchestral.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3384] Well that's what it is isn't it?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3385] Mm.
                  [3386] ... Were you buying this erm newspaper last week by
                  any chance?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3387] Oh!
Frederick (PS0A8) [3388] Why?
Joan (PS0AB)      [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3389] Get to France for a pound.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3390] Oh yes I saw it on the er box, mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3391] She's keeping, keep the coupons for Malcolm to send
                  off haven't you?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3392] You collect er well all you've really gotta do is buy
                  the paper Monday to Friday ... collect four coupons
Joan (PS0AB)      [3393] Is that empty?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3394] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3395] [...] better move it.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3396] Collect four coupons and each ... set of coupons
                  allows you to claim up to four tickets and ... it was a pound
                  a ticket wasn't it?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3397] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3398] A pound a ticket, and you could go, there were three
                  routes you could go ... and any time up to March the twenty
                  eighth
Frederick (PS0A8) [3399] Oh.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3400] and that was your fare from, you could go, Dover to
                  ... Calais
Joan (PS0AB)      [3401] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3402] Newhaven to Dieppe or ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3403] Dunno what the other one was.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3404] way down, was it Southampton somewhere? [...] and that
                  was your ... ferry fare over for the day.
                  [3405] ... So erm we thought we might go for a day didn't we?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3406] Might do yes, the end of March.
                  [3407] ... He'd, I think he would have liked to have gone the
                  four hour trip [laughing] over [] ... I didn't think you'd
                  like that.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3408] Well that one was the most restrictive because that
                  you had to go, you could go any time between ... was it eight
                  and eleven in the morning, but you could only come back
                  either something like ... quarter to five, quarter to, no
                  quarter to six was it?
                  [3409] Or quarter to two in the morning, there were only two
                  you could come back on.
                  [3410] Whereas ... the Dover to Calais you can go any time
                  between this time and that time and come back any time
                  between this time and ... that time.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3411] Yeah.
                  [3412] Yeah.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3413] But going to ... Dieppe it docks on the quay or
                  whatever is sort of right in the heart of erm the town so
                  once you are off the ferry, you're there.
                  [3414] Well I suppose it depends what you ... want to go for.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3415] Well he, he was asking me which I'd prefer and I said
                  ... I think you ought to consider Vicki not me ... on the
                  crossing.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3416] Well if you go ... if you stay till quarter to one in
                  the morning how can you be sure there's gonna be anything
                  open to
Joan (PS0AB)      [3417] To do.
                  [3418] Well that's it.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3419] to do.
                  [3420] So therefore if you come back
Joan (PS0AB)      [3421] Paris nightclub.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3422] if you could come back before
Joan (PS0AB)      [3423] Stripping club.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3424] if you come back on the one before you've only got
                  about three and a half hours so you've got four hours on the
                  ferry, three and a half there and then four hours back again
                  haven't you?
                  [3425] Anyway we'll see what [...]
Joan (PS0AB)      [3426] Well Vicki's not very keen on crossing the water are
                  you?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3427] No.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3428] So I thought the shorter journey would be ... better.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3429] And if we don't go we've only lost a pound ticket.
                  [3430] ... So we'll see.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3431] [...] snow ... that day.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3432] [laugh] ... Well I think they're going to repeat the
                  offer aren't they?
                  [3433] They're supposed to be doing it again. ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3434] Well we, at the erm school play we were talking to,
                  who did you say, Mr ?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3435] Mm.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3436] And he was telling, you know erm ... it was the er
                  Christmas thing, he was t saying he'd been to France on a
                  cheap ticket hadn't he? [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3437] Through the Daily Ma oh Express.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3438] The Express wasn't it?
                  [3439] Or The Mail?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3440] Daily Express.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3441] It was one of the better papers.
                  [3442] I mean The Sun is absolutely ... [...] [laughing] I
                  mean [...] [] ... I did tr have a go at reading the first one
                  and I thought well I can't read this trash any longer, think
                  I read two pages.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3443] Yes what did he, how much did it cost him?
                  [3444] Fifteen pounds did he say? ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3445] [...] they had, they went for ... the weekend didn't
                  they?
                  [3446] ... No not for the, I don't think they went for the
                  day.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3447] Think it was.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3448] Was it? ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3449] Thought he said it was a day.
                  [3450] But they, they sailed sort of first thing in the
                  morning and didn't come back till last thing at
Joan (PS0AB)      [3451] Night.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3452] night.
                  [3453] Thought it was only a day, and they were talking to
                  somebody else on the ferry who said they did this trip every
                  year didn't they?
                  [3454] And what good value it was, it was only costing them
                  ... [...] hundred and ...
Joan (PS0AB)      [3455] Well I really can't remember the figures.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3456] oh I thought he said a hundred and something pounds
                  didn't he?
Joan (PS0AB)      [3457] Mm.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3458] And it had cost them about fifteen or something.
                  [3459] Mr said he didn't have the heart to tell them how, you
                  might think it's good value but he didn't when he'd only paid
                  fifteen pounds fifty a ticket.
                  [3460] ... Have you got any more ideas for holidays or? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [3461] Not erm I've sort of got several things that I'd like
                  to do
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3462] In your mind that you'd like to do.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3463] I'm ever so disappointed that I've not been to
                  Yugoslavia, I wanted to go to Dubrovnik, you know, it's been
                  on the sort of list but I've never got round to it.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3464] It's a bit late now till things are sorted out.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3465] Yeah I'm afraid afraid so, and of course it's been
                  damaged anyway now.
                  [3466] ... Egypt ... er ... is on my list.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3467] Oh up the Nile? [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3468] Yeah.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3469] Mind you don't get in with the Carry On crew.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3470] Erm ... yes there er, there are ... I was talking to
                  er ... tt do you know June ?
                  [3471] She's ... she's about my age I should think and she
                  sometimes, once a month she does the coffee ... wears glasses
Joan (PS0AB)      [3472] I'd perhaps recognize, yes tell by
Frederick (PS0A8) [3473] anyw anyway erm I was talking to her on the bus not
                  too long ago and, I don't know how it came up but she was
                  talking about Egypt, and er she'd been apparently oh some ...
                  a year or two back cos she did a, an evening course on
                  Egyptology and she went through that, but she was telling me
                  about a friend or friends of hers who'd been er and told me
                  about the trip.
                  [3474] Erm then she put, he had done a newsletter to his
                  friends which is beautifully done er and had sent her one and
                  so she put it through my door so it was quite interesting.
                  [3475] On that holiday they er ... they'd also been to Cairo
                  as well as, and I mean some of the erm ... trips erm are ...
                  they go to Luxor and you board a erm er the ship from Luxor
                  to Aswan ... and you don't get to Cairo and I think if you're
                  going to Egypt you really want to go to Cairo
Joan (PS0AB)      [...]
Vicki (PS0AC)     [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3476] as well as.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3477] Oh yes, certainly. ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [3478] Er you know I, I, it's, it's on my list.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3479] It's mulling around up there.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3480] Now if you want to know what I'd like, which holiday
                  I'd like and I probably will never do it, mind you I ne I
                  need the person to go with because definitely you need a
                  person to go with, I'd love to go on the Orient Express.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3481] You know I was wai I thought oh I wonder if it'll be
                  the Orient Express, yeah.
                  [3482] Mm on the train.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3483] But er yeah ... erm ... but you er but it's so
                  expensive ... erm to do it properly
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3484] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3485] er to go right the way through to Venice and you've
                  got to stay at Venice for at least a couple of days so oh and
                  it, er, I think er, you're talking about two thousand at
                  least just for that four days, you know?
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3486] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3487] [sigh] So
Joan (PS0AB)      [3488] [...] do that when we go, we shan't go that way to
                  Venice when we go shall we?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3489] So it's the sort of thing where if somebody said to me
                  right
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3490] You can have whatever holiday you like
Frederick (PS0A8) [3491] No, no, no, no ... you could only do that, I want you
                  to go on the Orient Express, yes.
                  [3492] If they said you can go anywhere you like it would,
                  that would cause ... I would, I would ... have difficulty
                  deciding.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3493] Be debating which yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3494] Yeah I've got another trip which I saw on telly, again
                  which I shall never do I think, er which sounded pretty good,
                  you flew, flew to er
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3495] [sneeze] Oh pardon me.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3496] Calgary, took a train over the Rockies to Vancouver
                  and then a cruise ship up to Alaska and, and back via
                  Vancouver and you saw the erm ice floes er dropping off and
                  er er seals and that, dolphins and that and it looked pretty
                  good.
Joan (PS0AB)      [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3497] But then you flew back from Calgary I think [...] or
                  it may have been Vancouver.
                  [3498] Now that was er ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3499] That looked worthwhile.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3500] That was about fifteen hundred two or three years ago
                  so that'll be two thousand at least.
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3501] A lot of money when you think it's just for, a
                  holiday's just for, you know, short times.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3502] Yeah, yeah.
                  [3503] ... Yes I mean er when I s er you know when I was on
                  the Q E Two and was chatting with a fella ... and er ... he,
                  they'd been, he'd obviously been cruising before and was on
                  this cruise and er they were going on the er another Cunard
                  ship a few months later, and it turned out that he was a
                  hotelier who'd bought a hotel in Swanage some years ago, I
                  think he'd had about seven bedrooms when he bought it and he
                  gradually extended it, I forget how many he did tell me, and
                  then he had a bit of a heart er ... attack and er his doctor
                  told him to, you know, well if I were you I'd just pack in
                  your job which he did and that was about fifteen years ago he
                  was ... I dunno if he was eighty or he was approaching eighty
                  if he wasn't and was in pretty good form, he was dancing, and
                  er, you know, I mean there money's no object.
                  [3504] Er the er the lady ... he was a widower and his, er
                  his f er he was with a lady who was a widow and erm I know
                  for a fact that she'd not spent a penny, she hadn't p you
                  know for a you know, of the trip or, or ... [...] he just
                  wouldn't let her, I mean, I mean you, you've got to have some
                  money haven't you to to keep
Joan (PS0AB)      [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3505] to keep going like that? ...
Vicki (PS0AC)     [3506] Hmm.
                  [3507] Well I'll have to keep doing these pools.
Joan (PS0AB)      [3508] That's right.
                  [3509] ... Well I keep sending these coupons off that come
                  through the door
Frederick (PS0A8) [laugh]

                  [3521] Does your hand hurt?
                  [3522] Are you not happy about it? ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [3523] Well I still
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3524] It's still solid isn't it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3525] I still, I s it's still swollen and I still haven't
                  got my full grip, I'm seeing the surgeon again today
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3526] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3527] but er I'm having physio er privately you know on, on
                  the thing
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3528] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3529] but I'm, I'm rapidly running out of the allowance erm
                  ... she appears to be ... satisfied
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3530] Right.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3531] but obviously [laugh] I, I'd like somebody else's
                  opinion really
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3532] Yes, yes.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3533] and I'm seeing the surgeon today and erm ... and I met
                  somebody the other day who'd had it done and his fingers
                  weren't affected, you know, so I mean it's just the luck of
                  the draw I think.
                  [3534] However ... I thought well I'm, I'm er
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3535] Mind you it does look better than when I saw it last.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3536] Oh yes it is.
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3537] Isn't it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3538] Oh it is, it is, oh it is
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3539] Yeah it's improving, yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3540] it's not er although the, the inflammation ... it was
                  not good at the weekend.
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3541] Oh.
                  [3542] Perhaps you're doing too much Fred and not resting it.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3543] Say again?
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3544] You're doing too much, you're not resting it. [laugh]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3545] Well no I'm not I mean this is it erm you don't know
                  er how much to do
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3546] No.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3547] and how much not to do really.
                  [3548] Oh.
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3549] Oh right ... hope the surgeon might be able to provide
                  you with [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3550] Mm well ... I, I mean really I want him to tell me ...
                  I mean she implies that I'm gonna get, you know, back ...
                  fully back to normal but ... I ... I'm beginning to wonder
                  myself
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3551] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3552] er I, I mean I really can't doubt her but erm, you
                  know, you, how you have hunches.
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3553] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3554] I feel as though I'm on a plateau at the moment
                  although sh sh when I said that she said well ... i it is
                  getting better so the
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3555] There's a physio.
                  [3556] [shouting] Trish [] ... I've got a patient for you
                  Trish if you've got five minutes to spare please. [laugh]
Trish (PS0AF)     [3557] Oh dear.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3558] Er he's ever such a nice patient though
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3559] It's not serious.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3560] Oh great!
Frederick (PS0A8) [3561] he's ever such a nice patient.
                  [3562] You didn't have the pleasure of meeting him when he
                  used to work here.
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3563] [laugh] This is Fred, he used to, he used to work in
                  [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3564] Hello.
                  [3565] [...] contracture.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3566] Is that what you've got?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3567] Opera no, I've had it.
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [3568] He's had an operation.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3569] Mm.
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3570] No no, I won't say that.
                  [3571] Operation the sixth of December ... on the little
                  finger ... er and my other fingers swelled up [...]
Trish (PS0AF)     [3572] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3573] and are still not down.
                  [3574] ... Really what I'm wanting you to tell me is how
                  normal is that and
Trish (PS0AF)     [3575] [sigh] To be honest I'm not, I erm ... not quite sure
                  really.
                  [3576] I mean have, have you been back to, to, to clinic
                  following [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3577] Oh yeah yeah yeah.
                  [3578] Well I had it done on the insurance you know
Trish (PS0AF)     [3579] Right yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3580] so I'm seeing the surgeon again today
Trish (PS0AF)     [3581] Are you?
                  [3582] You
Frederick (PS0A8) [3583] but of course he's the one who's done it
Trish (PS0AF)     [3584] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3585] so even if he sort of made a, a bodge, I'm not
                  suggesting he has [laughing] he's not likely to, to [] say
                  yes that's because of that.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3586] So is the finger better then?
                  [3587] I mean
Frederick (PS0A8) [3588] Well ... erm it, oh well I mean it is better in as
                  much as it was sticking out like that
Trish (PS0AF)     [3589] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3590] and I can [laughing] whereas I [] couldn't get a glove
                  on now I can now.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3591] Right.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3592] I haven't got all that much movement.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3593] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3594] Well you know I mean it's not too bad I suppose.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3595] No I'd just be, I mean I must admit I've, I've not
                  really seen one for years and years and years.
                  [3596] You get quite sort of specialized.
                  [3597] I think
Frederick (PS0A8) [3598] Yeah quite.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3599] undoubtedly I think you need to ask him, you know,
                  that erm just say to him that you're very concerned about the
                  fingers
Frederick (PS0A8) [3600] Yeah, yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3601] and, you know, what can, what can [...] do about it.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3602] Now the physio, I'm I'm having the, I'm having physio
Trish (PS0AF)     [3603] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3604] and I was just saying to Yvonne er I'm rapidly running
                  out of my physio allowance, you know, because of the amount
                  that
Trish (PS0AF)     [3605] Yes, yeah, yeah perhaps you're not
Frederick (PS0A8) [3606] she's doing erm and she seems to imply that er it will
                  get back to normal but, you know, I ... I just, I'm not er
                  happy about that myself.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3607] Well I would have thought so but really erm I think
                  you just need to sort of
Frederick (PS0A8) [3608] I, I, I mean it really has been swollen and er
                  inflamed
Trish (PS0AF)     [3609] So it's down a bit?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3610] Oh yes.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3611] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3612] Oh yes, yes yes yes.
                  [3613] Oh yes and I had er pressure sores, you know?
Trish (PS0AF)     [3614] Mm.
                  [3615] Yeah, no I think you just need to be frank with him
                  and you know say ... you're happy about the finger, fine, but
                  just, you know, [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3616] I'm more concerned about these
Trish (PS0AF)     [3617] Yeah.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3618] because these were okay [laugh]
Trish (PS0AF)     [3619] Right
Frederick (PS0A8) [3620] than, than this.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3621] Yeah, well no I would be direct with him and say, you
                  know
Frederick (PS0A8) [3622] Yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3623] you're really worried about these
Frederick (PS0A8) [3624] Yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3625] and, and just see, sort of see what, what he says
                  really
Frederick (PS0A8) [3626] Mm.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3627] and if you're having physio that's, that's good but
                  like you say [...]
Yvonne (PS0AE)    [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3628] No I mean I, I don't know how much.
                  [3629] It, the bill was hundred and thirty eight quid last
                  month ... and it'll be more than that this month and I think
                  my yearly allowance is about three hundred, you know, so I'm
                  rapidly running out.
                  [3630] ... Anyway thanks for your, no no
Trish (PS0AF)     [3631] Sorry I can't really sort of say I must admit I
                  couldn't really see why they should be like that really cos I
                  mean it is a bit puzzling cos if they've only just done
                  anything, they've only been tampering with this finger so
Frederick (PS0A8) [3632] The, the, the the other thing er I, I have the feeling
                  in this finger of, not pins and needles, but just a slight
                  difference he's obviously cut some nerves I should imagine.
                  [3633] But er you know I'm, as I say, I'm more concerned
                  about those ...
Trish (PS0AF)     [3634] How annoying.
                  [3635] But I must admit I haven't seen an I haven't seen, you
                  know it's years well it'll be years [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3636] You see what what I'm up against is, I mean the physio
                  who, who, I mean she's private of course
Trish (PS0AF)     [3637] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3638] she is one wanting er referrals from Mr so she's not
                  going to say oh well you know there's something wrong there,
                  you know?
Trish (PS0AF)     [3639] Mm.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3640] Is she?
Trish (PS0AF)     [3641] No.
Frederick (PS0A8) [3642] You see.
                  [3643] Er er and er ... I'm not saying that there is
                  necessarily, but even if there was she's not going to because
                  she wants to preserve her, her referrals.
                  [3644] Don't want me [...]
Trish (PS0AF)     [3645] Well I'd just say you're really worried about these
                  fingers
Frederick (PS0A8) [3646] Yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3647] and that, you know, [...] and you just say, you know
                  ... you know, what, what are you [laughing] gonna do about
                  this []
Frederick (PS0A8) [3648] Yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3649] you know, should it, should it actually be like [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3650] Yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3651] Then if you get some answers then you can always say
                  to him well this is what, you know, this is what
Frederick (PS0A8) [3652] Yeah well I mean I saw him what, either a fortnight or
                  three weeks ago, three, probably about three weeks, and at
                  that stage my plaster that I'd had on after the er op had
                  only been off perhaps a fortnight, it was Christmas
                  intervening you see, so he had every sort of right to say,
                  you know, oh well yeah ... it should be okay, yeah. [...]
Trish (PS0AF)     [3653] Think the only thing you can do is as I say be honest
                  and say that, you know, you're very worried about your
                  fingers
Frederick (PS0A8) [3654] Yeah, yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3655] [...] I know it's not a lot of help but erm
Frederick (PS0A8) [3656] No well you, you
Trish (PS0AF)     [3657] I'm, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to say whether
                  it was [...] or not so [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3658] Yeah, yeah, well that, that's fine, that's all I
                  wanted to know, I'm pleased you popped in,i it
Trish (PS0AF)     [3659] [laughing] Sorry []
Frederick (PS0A8) [3660] yes but i it's sort of erm
Trish (PS0AF)     [3661] Even if it's only to give you the confidence you know
Frederick (PS0A8) [3662] Yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3663] to sort of
Frederick (PS0A8) [3664] Yeah.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3665] It's awful I [...] , I'm the same if I'm going to see
                  a doctor, I think ooh
Frederick (PS0A8) [3666] Well when you've got
Trish (PS0AF)     [3667] you forget what you were going to ask [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3668] Yes but when you've been, when you've been in the work
                  as I have over many years with doctors, I was a mental
                  welfare officer so I mean I know ... er, you know, you can be
                  fobbed off.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3669] That's right.
                  [3670] No go for it. [laugh] ...
Frederick (PS0A8) [3671] Right.
Trish (PS0AF)     [3672] [...] [laugh] Well I hope it is [...] but they're not
                  good are they?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3673] Well if that,th
Trish (PS0AF)     [...]
Frederick (PS0A8) [3674] Yes I'm, yeah, yeah I mean I can drive
Trish (PS0AF)     [3675] But that's it?
Frederick (PS0A8) [3676] er but I haven't got, I haven't got a grip. ...
