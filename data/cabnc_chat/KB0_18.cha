*MAR:	Mm.
*JOH:	and I'll bring one on Friday with me.I did ask, I did mention it to Granville on Saturday.
*MAR:	Aha.
*JOH:	Because, you know, he said what it was gonna cost him in the future.So if we can save some cost
*MAR:	Mm.
*JOH:	 (        ) But it's   (.) once you get more than twenty copies  (        ) 
*MAR:	Yes.
*JOH:	and that   (        ) makes the copying quite reasonable.
*ALA:	Oh I see, it's not an ordinary photocopier?It, it 
*JOH:	Oh yeah.But they've got two.This one's called an, an offset
*ALA:	Mm.
*JOH:	printer.You you've got an ordinary photocopier and an offset.The ordinary photocopier works out a bit more expensive.
*ALA:	Mm.
*JOH:	But you see, using the offset    (.)  (        ) that case be I don't know what's   (        ) 
*MAR:	Well he'll generally want about seventy copies.
*JOH:	Yeah.In that way it works out much better.
*MAR:	Mm.
*JOH:	Because there's an example there, you know, hundred   (.) two hundred, whatever you want. (.) There's an example there.
*MAR:	Mm.
*JOH:	Like, I just   (        ) really that   (.) we could reduce the scale of costing.A little bit.
*MAR:	Well why not?
*JOH:	You know? (        ) It's gonna help my school and it will help us as well.It will do two things won't it? (.) 
*ALA:	Oh it's the school do does it?
*JOH:	It's the school does it.Erm because we've got a printing system for the school   (.) th they're, they're now letting out their printing services to others in the community.
*ALA:	Mm.
*JOH:	Erm   (.) so i if you like it's, it's officially done because therefore they're advertising it   (.) in our last newsletter we send to every parent
*MAR:	Mm.
*JOH:	this advert went on the back of it.So if anybody locally wanted  (        ) .So basically all I would have to do is take them with me and   (.) I'd bring them home on the same day.
*MAR:	Mm.
*JOH:	So it's done there and then. (.) 
*ALA:	Apart from that I've got all the information we want here  (        )

*ALA:	Er no it's, it's   (.) no we haven't had two sides  (        ) 
*JOH:	If you have two sides it'll be quite a few won't it?And sixty copies will be three pound.
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	Cos some of these places   (        ) in town, people have to charge you VAT as well don't they?Which is 
*ALA:	Oh yes, yes.
*JOH:	what pushes   (.) well if you go to somebody it pushes the cost up doesn't it?
*MAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	And a lot of the commercial ones charge you about ten pence a
*JOH:	Oh some of them charge you ten plus VAT don't they?
*ALA:	Mm.

*ALA:	And a computer you've got a spellchecker.

*MAR:	Yes.
*ALA:	Whereas with the electronic typewriter you've got to do it er 
*MAR:	Oh yeah.Yes  (        ) .It's really a better, faster ty ordinary typewriter in a way.
