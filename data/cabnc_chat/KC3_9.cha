*FRE:	Is that  (.)  
*JOA:	Let me er I can  I'll get my glasses. (7.0)  
*FRE:	It's come away from the zip er er I don't know whether it's er  (.)  
*JOA:	Oh! 
*FRE:	repairable is it? (.)  
*JOA:	Well that's easy, it only wants sewing up there Fred. 
*FRE:	Oh does it? 
*JOA:	Yes, do you want me to do it for you? 
*FRE:	If you would I'd be glad. 
*JOA:	Do you want it now or  or later? 
*FRE:	 No, no  no, any time. 
*JOA:	Yes, that's simple. Simple. Have you got a zip in?  (.) Oh yes your zip's the other, the other  side. 
*FRE:	 Ah  yeah. 
*JOA:	Yes, will do.  (.) It wouldn't take long to do it now but   ((laughing)) I can't be  bothered    
*FRE:	 No  don't. (.)  
*JOA:	being lazy.  (.) Oh peace after Heidi! Sh  she   (.) was it the week, the new year's weekend? She was away at Malcolm's cousin's   (.) from the Sunday till the Wednesday evening   (.) and we hadn't realized how much noise she makes until she came home  on the Wednesday evening. 
*FRE:	  ((laugh))  
*JOA:	Three lovely peaceful days    ((cough))  ((laughing)) then she comes in    (.) peace is shattered, ((laughing)) oh dear . She's so full of life, whereas Tasha could be around and you'd 
*FRE:	Yeah. 
*JOA:	you, you didn't know she was er here, she'd have a book or some  (  )  
*FRE:	Yeah. (.)  
*JOA:	But the other night when Heidi, when she was practising her song, she's so dramatic all the time going   (.) you know if only she'd do that when she's on the stage   (.) you know put erm action into her singing. (.)  
*FRE:	When's it taking place? (.)  
*JOA:	Erm it's the last Saturday of half term so I should think it's about erm   (.) when's half term? Eighteenth on the Monday I think   (.) so it'll be twenty   (.) erm it's the fifth is it when I, no it won't   (.) it's not as late as that is it   (.) eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty one   (.) about the twenty second, something like that.  (.) It's usually the last Saturday of the half term because then she can have them during the week to practise. 
*FRE:	Yeah. (.)  
*JOA:	Well the, all the others go on a Saturday but Heidi said she would be in it if she didn't have to go on Saturday, every Saturday, because she goes riding you see at nine o'clock   (.) nine till   (.) four   (.) so er Wendy said oh she'll have her up on a Sunday afternoon   (.) the two or three principals.  (11.0) And this erm play we went to   (.) in The Haymarket, it was, it was difficult for children to understand but er   (.) the scenery, the way they use the scenery, it was absolutely fantastic, you know, to make the   (  ) of a desert and a 
*FRE:	Yeah. 
*JOA:	all the satellites hanging down   (  ) it was very good the way it had all been done in, in that respect but   (.) what I found was the first bit was very boring, ((laughing)) I found  but when it got going a bit it was better but   (.) the whole moral of the story was that nowhere is perfect to live   (.) but it's hard for y   ((laughing)) young children  like this to    
*FRE:	 Yeah.  Yeah  quite. 
*JOA:	 to know  what it's all about, yeah. 
*FRE:	 Quite. (6.0)  
*JOA:	Gosh that was quick   (  )  (.)  
*VIC:	Well straight up, Wendy was there so   (.) straight up. 
*JOA:	Oh, it makes a change that Wendy's there on time. She's a teacher at the school, you know, Wendy  . I don't know whether you've come across her at all. That's how er Heidi started going to her drama classes. 
*FRE:	Er no   (.) I was trying t  do you know I can't remember er Mrs   's christian name. 
*VIC:	Irene. 
*FRE:	Irene. Yeah, I know it as well as anything but er er 
*VIC:	At times you just 
*FRE:	er er I don't know why I was thinking about it yesterday for some reason, oh probably because I got erm   (.) the official invite to the er thing on Friday. (.)  
*VIC:	Another cup of coffee Fred? 
*FRE:	Er no thank you. 
*VIC:	Would you like another cup? 
*JOA:	No thank you dear.  (.) Is Wendy bringing her back? (.)  
*VIC:	 Er   
*FRE:	 Which  is Wendy? Wh  what's she look like? 
*VIC:	Erm   (.) well I'd say it's curly sort of   (.) oh it's dark hair, curlyish 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*VIC:	with glasses. 
*JOA:	And she never stops talking. 
*VIC:	Never stops talking. Takes the younger age, reception age  er   
*FRE:	 What  was the name of the   (.) teacher   (.) tended to be on the slim side, longish hair, at the   (.) do at Christmas? She was with the children er er, looking at the stage, to the left.  (.) Forty fiveish, fifty? 
*VIC:	Was she wearing trousers? 
*FRE:	Can't remember. 
*JOA:	Kay? 
*VIC:	 (  ) 
*JOA:	She was with  the children. 
*FRE:	 Don't kn   tell me the er if you tell me the 
*VIC:	Kay    (.)  
*FRE:	 (  ) in  fact she s    
*VIC:	 Maybe I don't know her. 
*FRE:	she spoke to me as er er as though  
*JOA:	No Lucy. 
*FRE:	as though she'd known me, you know, but I couldn't even remember seeing her before.  (.) Don't think it was Kay. 
*VIC:	No, trying to think who else was there. (.)  
*JOA:	Well it wouldn't be Heather   cos she's dark and short and young. (6.0)  
*VIC:	Small? No. 
*FRE:	Well 
*VIC:	Small erm 
*FRE:	not 
*VIC:	not particularly small  (  )  
*FRE:	Is it er I, I mean I ca  I'm 
*JOA:	I, I've no idea. 
*FRE:	I would have said she was medium height   (.) slim build, possibly 
*VIC:	It's the only one I can think of  that could   
*FRE:	 and er   (.)  
*JOA:	  (  ) remember seeing somebody in trousers. 
*VIC:	 Yeah Kay, down to about her ears? Yes.  That was Kay wasn't it? (  )   
*JOA:	 I, I don't  I don't know Kay. 
*FRE:	Ch  what was the surname again? 
*VIC:	 
*FRE:	 , may have been her.  (8.0) The funny thing was I was asking Irene who she was because I couldn't remember seeing her and then, later on, she came up to me   ((laughing)) as though she'd known me, you know ? 
*VIC:	Yeah.  (.) It was very good wasn't it? The er 
*FRE:	Yeah, mm. 
*JOA:	And an unusual slant 
*FRE:	Yeah. 
*JOA:	on the story. 
*FRE:	Yeah. (.)  
*VIC:	And then was it er a little while after that Malcolm and I went to see the  (.)  
*JOA:	Racing Demons? 
*VIC:	No, the parents'  panto   
*JOA:	 Oh yes.  Oh I didn't go. You got me a ticket but I didn't go did I.  (.) A cheese. What was that called? 
*VIC:	Crumple Stilton or something wasn't it? The parents at the school all get together and do a pantomime for the children. Erm   (.) I think they, I think they do that during the day and then in the evening it's on for   (.) anybody else who wants to see that   (.) take-off on cheeses. That was quite good. Yeah we went to see Racing Demons at the beginning of December didn't we?  (.) Cos we went with  Margaret and Roger. 
*JOA:	 Mm I suppose, yes. 
*VIC:	Mm. It was quite   (.) quite good, at the Theatre Royal. (.)  
*FRE:	Oh we got sidetracked er erm about erm tt Blind Date didn't I?  ((laughing)) I, I said I was sp  you were speaking to an expert  er so we went off at a blind   (.) tangent. But they, they er   (.) I mean you don't have to be too bright to realize that the questions have been given them and the answers have g  been given them. 
*JOA:	Well somebody, it was Hazel wasn't  it? 
*VIC:	 Mm. 
*JOA:	She erm said well of course they know the questions beforehand and the, the answers are always written out for them   (.) erm   (.) but I, I wouldn't have thought all the answers because some of them come over  quite spontaneously. 
*FRE:	 Yeah, yeah bu   yeah, but they are rehearsing for   ((laughing)) two and a half hours . They don't see the person   (.) they don't see the er   (.) the  they're kept separate but erm the  they are   (.) rehearsed. So er,y  you know. An  an  and I could erm   (.) I, I erm her name was Barbara erm   (.) Actually it was rather interesting there a  oh have you remembered the name of  that club? 
*JOA:	 No. 
*FRE:	I would know it if you told me. 
*JOA:	Well I can see it on    (  )   
*VIC:	 Mm. 
*FRE:	Yeah. A  anyway it doesn't matter. Er but she's a member and we went there for lunch and it was the ideal place, you know, cos there weren't any, many people around and so we had quite a nice lunch   (.) and erm whilst we were there we then had a drink in er in the bar and erm her   (.) the, the secretary of the club, a lady, came to talk to Barbara and she mentioned that she'd seen her on Blind Date you see, and so I got to know more by listening to them two speaking er and er that's where I learnt about er that. Erm  (.)  
*VIC:	Well some of the questions you think erm   (.) you think erm   (.) you know, aren't they a bit well way out or   (.) what made them ask that. 
*JOA:	Well I've said  all along   
*FRE:	 Yeah and so  and some of the  answers. 
*JOA:	how do they think up those answers  in such a   
*FRE:	 Yeah. 
*JOA:	short  time but er   
*FRE:	 Yeah, yeah  yeah. 
*JOA:	now we know.  (.) It takes some of the erm   (.) tt   (.) oh what's, what's the word? When er 
*VIC:	 (  ) 
*JOA:	No. When you, when you think that they're racking their brains  and it   
*FRE:	 Yeah. 
*JOA:	seems far more interesting than knowing that they've rehearsed for hours on end. 
*FRE:	I think sometimes the odd er the odd times people are 
*JOA:	Putting a bit more 
*FRE:	Yeah,a  and in fact in the programme I   (.) th  the one that Barbara was in, I can remember the er, as it happens, I, I was out er when that programme came on and I taped it so I s  I, I've still got that particular programme, and the lady at the end   (.) er on one of her questions she'd obviously forgotten what she was going to say er and sort of made something up and er she turned to er as they were just panning away from her, she turned to her next door neighbour and more or less said   (.) I forgot what I was going to say, you know. 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*FRE:	Mm. 
*JOA:	Cos they don't have any notes or anything do they? So 
*FRE:	No, no, no, oh no I mean er  (.)  
*JOA:	It's supposed to look natural    (  )   
*FRE:	 Yes, yes a   and erm   (.) oh yes I mean some of the things that, especially the er the more senior people now   (.) th  those people on the erm programme last night, did you see it? 
*JOA:	 Yeah. 
*VIC:	 Yeah. 
*FRE:	Yeah, 
*VIC:	Clarence. 
*FRE:	Yeah   (.) er they, they wouldn't have come out with some of the things about er   (.) I can't remember what was said that erm you know er wouldn't mind meeting you in the bath or 
*JOA:	Yes  or under the shower, yes. 
*FRE:	 we  w  that, that, that s   you know that s  yeah, that sort of thing erm  (.)  
*JOA:	I think they are a bit er  (.)  
*FRE:	Yes. 
*JOA:	I suppose that's just    (  )   
*FRE:	 I mean it, oh yes I mean   actually   
*VIC:	 Make it  lighthearted. 
*FRE:	actually erm the, the er it is a very good, from the television people's point of view, it is an excellent programme because i  y  people are interested aren't they? 
*JOA:	Yes. 
*FRE:	A  and furthermore they're interested in, in the way out somebody  and that, in fact I think   
*JOA:	 Looks a little bit different. 
*FRE:	they sometimes manipulate   ((laughing)) the questions so that the person picks   
*VIC:	 To make them   (  )   
*FRE:	the right one that they would like to be picked . Do you  know what I mean? 
*VIC:	  (  ) yeah  yeah, could be. 
*FRE:	Erm oh did you, did you see the one with that, it was last week when they came back I think, that naive bloke, lad from Devon? 
*JOA:	Oh yes. 
*FRE:	 ((sigh)) Dear oh dear oh dear! 
*VIC:	Was that the one where the girl was a 
*FRE:	Nurse. 
*JOA:	A nurse or d  yes. 
*VIC:	and she was only a bit older? 
*FRE:	Yeah.  That's the one   
*JOA:	 Yes his   
*FRE:	that's the one. 
*VIC:	He was eighteen and she was nineteen or  something   
*JOA:	 And she  kept saying how childish he was. 
*FRE:	Yeah, oh it was predictable that wasn't go to work. He was wasn't he? Very immature. (.)  
*VIC:	How   (.) far   (.) in front of us seeing it is it erm recorded? 
*FRE:	Erm   (.) I think Barbara, I think it was July when she did it.  (.) So that would be, and that would be about either November or December  wouldn't it? 
*JOA:	 Yes. (.)  
*VIC:	Cos I suppose they do so many recordings and then screen them don't they? 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah   
*VIC:	 Sort of for the series and then, then there's a break. 
*JOA:	Well Cilla Black's one of the highest paid   (.) erm   (.) presenters isn't she? On the television. 
*FRE:	Mm. 
*JOA:	Esther Rantzen for the B B C and Cilla Black I think on the A T V. 
*FRE:	The erm   (.) did you see the one where   (.) this was er er for the more senior ones again, er about the fifty mark, where the fellow was a hypnotist and   (.) a very nice fella 
*JOA:	I can remember now you say hypnotist but I can't remember what happened in the programme but I can remember him. 
*FRE:	and er she was er  the one he   
*JOA:	 Because they were on  about, in the answers, about him hypnotizing them, one of them was especially. 
*FRE:	Oh, and the, the trip they had was to er   (.) the Middle East, erm   (.) in the desert 
*JOA:	I didn't see that. 
*FRE:	Oh you  didn't see it? 
*JOA:	  (  )  
*FRE:	Ah. Oh well er what I was going to say is that er   (.) I thought I'd summed the person up that he'd selected and I, I thought oh she i  er it's not gonna be easy for him, and it wasn't, you know, she was a bit of a   (.) bit of a so and so I think really.  (.) Full of her own importance, you know? 
*JOA:	Yeah. 
*VIC:	I often wonder if, when they've selected   (.) a person say right, I'll choose number three, when number one goes by and number two goes by afterwards if they think oh you know, no, I would have preferred number two. 
*FRE:	Oh they would, I'm sure  a lot of that's done. 
*VIC:	 Well do they   
*JOA:	Wonder if they  have a, a, a chance   
*VIC:	  (  )  
*JOA:	of meeting up with them. 
*VIC:	afterwards. 
*FRE:	Well I heard, I, I wondered about that, and   (.) erm I think they must have contact because   (.) erm one of them who came back   (.) bearing in mind there must be a, a, a, about a three month gap, had had a proposal from one  of the persons   
*VIC:	 One of the others. 
*FRE:	who er she didn't pick. 
*JOA:	Oh.  (.) Mm. (.)  
*VIC:	But sometimes you can see ooh that one and that one who just go together and they don't choose each other  
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. 
*VIC:	and then when  they   
*JOA:	 And you're  sitting here going oh choose so and so, you choose him   ((laughing)) don't you ? 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
*VIC:	Yeah    (  )   
*FRE:	 But, but from the  programme producer's point of view, I should think he, he doesn't want too many that are okay, he wants the er 
*VIC:	But it would be nice to get    (  )   
*JOA:	  (  )  
*FRE:	 Yeah  yeah, yeah. 
*JOA:	I mean just lately they seem to   (.) they really slang each other don't they? 
*FRE:	Mm, mm. 
*VIC:	I of  er, was it last week erm, yeah it must have been where the   (.) the  coloured lad   
*JOA:	 Yes. 
*VIC:	cos he was back last night wasn't he? Two white lads and a coloured one and er it was a white girl and I often wonder if that's a good idea   (.) er whether they should all be the same colour. 
*JOA:	Oh I think so because it must be an awful shock   (.) for the girl to   (.) go round the screen and they're faced with a coloured   (.) although they don't bother so much these days do they? 
*VIC:	No. She said he wasn't ugly enough didn't she? 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) Yeah. 
*JOA:	But a few   (.) well I was gonna say a few weeks ago, it might be longer than that, there was that very   (.) large coloured girl that was on 
*FRE:	That's a few years ago, never mind a few months. 
*JOA:	No er   ((laughing)) there was one  not so very   (.) I'm sure not so ve  not, not years ago  but it was   
*FRE:	 Yo  do you  there was one   (.) very bonny lass and she was on the er, they, they had erm   (.) composite programme the other   (.) the other week and she was on that again. 
*JOA:	Oh is that where I saw her? 
*FRE:	Maybe. 
*VIC:	  (  )  
*JOA:	 I mean fancy being  erm confronted with somebody like   (.)  like that. 
*FRE:	 And in  and actually in that programme it was a Nottingham fella who er   ((laughing)) was  confronted with her    
*JOA:	 Was it? 
*FRE:	Yeah. So, yeah, she's a real extrovert. 
*JOA:	And then there's that er one who was a pu   
*VIC:	That was a little while ago, that was big  (  )  
*JOA:	she was big but she was  wasn't coloured was she? 
*VIC:	No, but she  ran a pub or something   
*JOA:	 So she was  (  ) .  Somewhere, yes. 
*VIC:	managed a pub and she was all   (.) all over.  (.) Yeah. 
*JOA:	But one, one of the coloured chaps where Tasha works said he was   (.) he'd been to one of these Blind Dates, he was on but we haven't come across him yet have we? (.)  
*VIC:	But he only said that a little while ago didn't he? So if there's a three month 
*JOA:	Yes, he might be 
*VIC:	gap. (.)  
*FRE:	Actually erm   (.) Barbara took, went with her niece to, for the audition and er what I'm not sure of,a  a  and   ((laugh)) Barbara got on and her niece didn't, what I'm not sure is whether, when she went down, she was thinking that, of sort of er an audition for herself or whether they approached her because apparently they, they don't get too many of the senior people. 
*JOA:	Oh.  (.) No it's, it's not often really that you get a   (.) senior 
*FRE:	In fact Barbara was saying to me er  ((laughing)) wh  why don't you  er but it's not the thing that I'd want to do. (.)  
*VIC:	Nice to have them now and again.  (6.0) Mm   (  )  (.)  
*JOA:	Did you see erm Wendy? 
*VIC:	No she, I think she was coming in and out cos the car door was open. 
*JOA:	So you don't know what time  Heidi's   
*VIC:	 Half past  four. 
*JOA:	Half past four.  Oh she's   
*VIC:	 And erm   
*JOA:	late this week is she? 
*VIC:	Well she was only early   (.) was it last week or the week before? Whenever she was early because there was a christening erm on and they were using the hall afterwards. And you know the door they go in 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*VIC:	to er   (.) that little side door? Well there were all blue and white balloons hanging up in the hall and by the door just these rows and rows of blue balloons and the door opens outwards 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*VIC:	and Wendy was saying how was she going to get the door open without all these balloons 
*JOA:	Going. 
*VIC:	coming out, yeah. (.)  
*JOA:	So no doubt it was a boy   (.) that was being christened. 
*VIC:	I would think so, blue, yeah. So they decided that once the   (.) christening party was in the hall which was gonna be three o'clock, they didn't stand much chance of erm 
*JOA:	Doing anything. 
*VIC:	No, so that's why they had it two till three that   (.) day. But it's now back to half past two till half past four and whoever's playing the dame arrived just in front of us 
*JOA:	Oh. 
*VIC:	so he's there.  (.) Tt what did Malcolm say? It was five   (.) five weeks, four weeks on Friday till half term? 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*VIC:	Four weeks on Friday, that's all she's got to    (.)   (  )   
*JOA:	 Yeah   
*VIC:	sort it out. (.)  
*JOA:	Oh if I go into town   (.) perhaps Tuesday   (.) to get her tape   (.) try to get her tape 
*VIC:	Well she said it's in H V M. 
*JOA:	erm   (.) I'll perhaps give   (.) Wind  , what are they called? Windblowers a ring and see if they've got 
*VIC:	For the music. 
*JOA:	Mm.  (.) I could   (  ) actually tomorrow to see if it's in the library couldn't I? 
*VIC:	Mm and then just photocopy it. 
*JOA:	Oh you're not allowed to are you? 
*VIC:	Well they won't know will they? 
*JOA:	Oh well   (  ) yeah I'd have to bring it home to have it done.  (  )  (.) Breaking the law, isn't it? 
*VIC:	Well I think it's only if you   (.) want to do er   (.) you know like   (  ) doing it for some, something or other isn't it? (.)  
*JOA:	No when   (  ) used to get music for the Women's Own choir to do for Mothering Sunday, she used to say keep quiet where you got the copy from. 
*VIC:	Mm, I think it's when you want a lot. 
*JOA:	Or say if you've got a    (.)  (  ) ten or eleven running off.  (.) Anyway I'll go in and steal it.  (.) We walked past that place didn't we? 
*VIC:	H V M? 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*VIC:	We were on our way down to    (  )  (.) but we weren't actually sure 
*JOA:	What it was called. 
*VIC:	Mm, so it wouldn't have been any good going in. 
*JOA:	Although you'd of probably recognized it. 
*VIC:	Well I said I thought it was called Seriously Orchestral. 
*JOA:	Well that's what it is isn't it? 
*VIC:	Mm.  (.) Were you buying this erm newspaper last week by any chance? 
*JOA:	Oh! 
*FRE:	Why? 
*JOA:	  (  )  
*VIC:	 Get to France  for a pound. 
*FRE:	Oh yes I saw it on the er box, mm. 
*JOA:	She's keeping, keep the coupons for Malcolm to send off haven't you? 
*VIC:	You collect er well all you've really gotta do is buy the paper Monday to Friday   (.) collect four coupons 
*JOA:	Is that empty? 
*VIC:	Mm. 
*JOA:	 (  ) better move it. 
*VIC:	Collect four coupons and each   (.) set of coupons allows you to claim up to four tickets and   (.) it was a pound a ticket wasn't it? 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*VIC:	A pound a ticket, and you could go, there were three routes you could go   (.) and any time up to March the twenty eighth 
*FRE:	Oh. 
*VIC:	and that was your fare from, you could go, Dover to   (.) Calais 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*VIC:	Newhaven to Dieppe or  (.)  
*JOA:	Dunno what the other one was. 
*VIC:	way down, was it Southampton somewhere? (  ) and that was your   (.) ferry fare over for the day.  (.) So erm we thought we might go for a day didn't we? 
*JOA:	Might do yes, the end of March.  (.) He'd, I think he would have liked to have gone the four hour trip   ((laughing)) over    (.) I didn't think you'd like that. 
*VIC:	Well that one was the most restrictive because that you had to go, you could go any time between   (.) was it eight and eleven in the morning, but you could only come back either something like   (.) quarter to five, quarter to, no quarter to six was it? Or quarter to two in the morning, there were only two you could come back on. Whereas   (.) the Dover to Calais you can go any time between this time and that time and come back any time between this time and   (.)  that time. 
*FRE:	 Yeah.  Yeah. 
*VIC:	But going to   (.) Dieppe it docks on the quay or whatever is sort of right in the heart of erm the town so once you are off the ferry, you're there. Well I suppose it depends what you   (.) want to go for. 
*JOA:	Well he, he was asking me which I'd prefer and I said   (.) I think you ought to consider Vicki not me   (.) on the crossing. 
*VIC:	Well if you go   (.) if you stay till quarter to one in the morning how can you be sure there's gonna be anything open  to   
*JOA:	 To  do. Well that's it. 
*VIC:	to do. So therefore  if you come back   
*JOA:	 Paris nightclub. 
*VIC:	if you could  come back before   
*JOA:	 Stripping club. 
*VIC:	if you come back on the one before you've only got about three and a half hours so you've got four hours on the ferry, three and a half there and then four hours back again haven't you? Anyway we'll see what    (  )   
*JOA:	 Well Vicki's  not very keen on crossing the water are you? 
*VIC:	No. 
*JOA:	So I thought the shorter journey would be   (.) better. 
*VIC:	And if we don't go we've only lost a pound ticket.  (.) So we'll see. 
*JOA:	 (  ) snow   (.) that day. 
*VIC:	 ((laugh))  (.) Well I think they're going to repeat the offer aren't they? They're supposed to be doing it again. (.)  
*JOA:	Well we, at the erm school play we were talking to, who did you say, Mr  ? 
*VIC:	Mm. 
*JOA:	And he was telling, you know erm   (.) it was the er Christmas thing, he was t  saying he'd been to France on a cheap ticket hadn't he? (  )   
*VIC:	 Through the Daily Ma   oh Express. 
*JOA:	The Express wasn't it?  Or The Mail? 
*VIC:	 Daily Express. 
*JOA:	It was one of the better papers. I mean The Sun is absolutely     (.)  (  )  ((laughing)) I mean     (  )  (.) I did tr  have a go at reading the first one and I thought well I can't read this trash any longer, think I read two pages. 
*VIC:	Yes what did he, how much did it cost him? Fifteen pounds did he say? (.)  
*JOA:	 (  ) they had, they went for   (.) the weekend didn't they?  (.) No  not for the, I don't think they went for the day. 
*VIC:	Think it was. 
*JOA:	Was it? (.)  
*VIC:	Thought he said it was a day. But they, they sailed sort of first thing in the morning and didn't come back till last thing at 
*JOA:	Night. 
*VIC:	night. Thought it was only a day, and they were talking to somebody else on the ferry who said they did this trip every year didn't they? And what good value it was, it was only costing them    (.)  (  ) hundred and  (.)  
*JOA:	Well I really can't remember the figures. 
*VIC:	oh I thought he said a hundred and something pounds didn't he? 
*JOA:	Mm. 
*VIC:	And it had cost them about fifteen or something. Mr   said he didn't have the heart to tell them how, you might think it's good value but he didn't when he'd only paid fifteen pounds fifty a ticket.  (6.0) Have you got any more ideas for holidays or? (.)  
*FRE:	Not erm I've sort of got several things  that I'd like to do   
*VIC:	 In your mind that you'd like  to do. 
*FRE:	I'm ever so disappointed that I've not been to Yugoslavia, I wanted to go to Dubrovnik, you know, it's been on the sort of list but I've never got round to it. 
*JOA:	It's a bit late now till things  are sorted out. 
*FRE:	 Yeah I'm afraid  afraid so, and of course it's been damaged anyway now.  (.) Egypt   (.) er   (.) is on my list. 
*VIC:	Oh up the Nile? ((laugh))  
*FRE:	Yeah. 
*JOA:	Mind you don't get in with the Carry On crew. 
*FRE:	Erm   (.) yes there er, there are   (.) I was talking to er   (.) tt do you know June  ? She's   (.) she's about my age I should think and she sometimes, once a month she does the coffee   (.) wears glasses 
*JOA:	I'd perhaps recognize, yes tell by   
*FRE:	 anyw   anyway erm I was talking to her on the bus not too long ago and, I don't know how it came up but she was talking about Egypt, and er she'd been apparently oh some   (.) a year or two back cos she did a, an evening course on Egyptology and she went through that, but she was telling me about a friend or friends of hers who'd been er and told me about the trip. Erm then she put, he had done a newsletter to his friends which is beautifully done er and had sent her one and so she put it through my door so it was quite interesting. On that holiday they er   (.) they'd also been to Cairo as well as, and I mean some of the erm   (.) trips erm are   (.) they go to Luxor and you board a erm er the ship from Luxor to Aswan   (.) and you don't get to Cairo and I think if you're going to Egypt you  really want to go to Cairo   
*JOA:	  (  )  
*VIC:	  (  )  
*FRE:	as well as. 
*JOA:	Oh yes, certainly. (.)  
*FRE:	Er you know I, I, it's, it's on my list. 
*JOA:	It's mulling around up there. 
*FRE:	Now if you want to know what I'd like, which holiday I'd like and I probably will never do it, mind you I ne  I need the person to go with because definitely you need a person to go with, I'd love to go on the Orient Express. 
*VIC:	You know I was wai  I thought oh I wonder if it'll be the Orient Express, yeah. Mm  on the train. 
*FRE:	 But er  yeah   (.) erm   (.) but you er but it's so expensive   (.) erm to do it properly 
*VIC:	Mm. 
*FRE:	er to go right the way through to Venice and you've got to stay at Venice for at least a couple of days so oh and it, er, I think er, you're talking about two thousand at least just for that four days, you know? 
*VIC:	Mm. 
*FRE:	 ((sigh))  So   
*JOA:	  (  )  do that when we go, we shan't go that way to Venice when we go shall we? 
*FRE:	So it's the sort of thing where if somebody said to me right 
*VIC:	You can have whatever holiday you like 
*FRE:	No, no, no, no   (.) you could only do that, I want you to go on the Orient Express, yes. If they said you can go anywhere you like it would, that would cause   (.) I would, I would   (.)  have difficulty deciding. 
*VIC:	 Be debating which  yeah. 
*FRE:	Yeah I've got another trip which I saw on telly, again which I shall never do I think, er which sounded pretty good, you  flew, flew to er   
*VIC:	  ((sneeze)) Oh pardon me. 
*FRE:	Calgary, took a train over the Rockies to Vancouver and then a cruise ship up to Alaska and, and back via Vancouver and you saw the erm ice floes er dropping off and er er seals and that, dolphins and that and it looked pretty good. 
*JOA:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	But then you flew back from Calgary I think   (  ) or it may have been Vancouver. Now that was er  (.)  
*VIC:	That looked worthwhile. 
*FRE:	That was about fifteen hundred two or three years ago so that'll be two thousand at least. 
*VIC:	A lot of money when you think it's just for, a holiday's just for, you know, short times. 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.  (.) Yes I mean er when I s  er you know when I was on the Q E Two and was chatting with a fella   (.) and er   (.) he, they'd been, he'd obviously been cruising before and was on this cruise and er they were going on the er another Cunard ship a few months later, and it turned out that he was a hotelier who'd bought a hotel in Swanage some years ago, I think he'd had about seven bedrooms when he bought it and he gradually extended it, I forget how many he did tell me, and then he had a bit of a heart er   (.) attack and er his doctor told him to, you know, well if I were you I'd just pack in your job which he did and that was about fifteen years ago he was   (.) I dunno if he was eighty or he was approaching eighty if he wasn't and was in pretty good form, he was dancing, and er, you know, I mean there money's no object. Er the er the lady   (.) he was a widower and his, er his f  er he was with a lady who was a widow and erm I know for a fact that she'd not spent a penny, she hadn't p  you know for a  you know, of the trip or, or    (.)  (  ) he just wouldn't let her, I mean, I mean you, you've got to have some money haven't you to  to keep   
*JOA:	  (  )  
*FRE:	to keep going like that? (.)  
*VIC:	Hmm. Well I'll have to keep doing these pools. 
*JOA:	That's right.  (.) Well I keep sending these coupons off that come through the door 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	en  entering competitions but   ((laughing)) I don't get anything .
