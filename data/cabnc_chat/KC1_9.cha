@Comment:	conversation #9 (Tape 040802)
*STE:	That must be the  the right hand set for that  because  two five five R seven B, the R is remote innit? •171848_172601•
        All the others are T for    •172601_172708•
*FRA:	Oh yeah? •172774_172820•
*STE:	aren't they? •172820_172874•
*FRA:	Yeah. •172874_172898•
        Yet we  didn't we? •173149_173282•
        So it was the wrong back then, probably. •173282_174341•
*STE:	wrote to them  complaints and •174669_174846•
*FRA:	No. •174846_174891•
*STE:	they switched on alright anyway . •175081_175170•
        Right do you want ? •175338_175417•
*FRA:	Well I've tried all those, I'll see what  switches on, just do one more. •175446_175915•
*STE:	Cos the tuner seems to be working itself dunnit   •175915_176139•
*FRA:	Yeah I mean I assume it's the same tube in this as the er Grundig innit? •176162_176593•
*STE:	Is it? •176593_176632•
*FRA:	Yeah. •176641_176660•
        It's a  innit? •176660_176771•
        Er  •176798_176805•
*STE:	Oh  •176805_176857•
*FRA:	 (        )  (.) 
*STE:	Mind you I think the Grundig was a little   might require a •176878_178849•
*FRA:	Yeah. •178874_178915•
        But this is only a basic set so I mean we'll know when there's a tube   yeah  •178939_179515•
*STE:	seventy five and this is a basic ? •179620_179782•
*FRA:	Yeah. •179829_179835•
        Let's try a different number  •179857_180058•
*STE:	Tried a different number  •180094_181847•
*FRA:	Yeah yeah •181904_183277•
*STE:	Yeah I thought maybe number one was worn out and  •183294_183815•
*FRA:	Yeah, it's a knackered tuner innit? •184160_184647•
        Oh colour's gone, why's that? •184683_185282•
*STE:	blank screen then for a sec. •185282_185576•
*FRA:	Oh, that's where they  that's where they are innit, round there. •185820_187352•
        It's either that or   •187396_187469•
*STE:	? •_•
*FRA:	No it's a little erm  well I should think it's gonna be the tuner innit? •187681_190894•
        Mm  •190997_191009•
*STE:	sixty quid and one tuner, I mean you know  don't mind if it's just  •191023_191317•
*FRA:	Yeah  •191317_191349•
*STE:	a couple of quid on them do you? •191349_191528•
        And they go nice and  •191528_191583•
*FRA:	No  •191602_191609•
*STE:	quick. •191623_191633•
*FRA:	Mind you it's had some spillage in here in the I F strip. •191633_191831•
        Ah  oh yes it has. •191831_192139•
        Lots of spillage, that's probably the problem. •192139_192579•
        Yeah you see it  you see it all round the chips •192618_192789•
*STE:	Oh yeah, yeah  on it, yeah yeah  •192789_193027•
*FRA:	all green, all green along there  I wonder  I was just thinking it's got all the bits in it to make that other one go •193027_194161•
*STE:	It's still switched on so   •194161_194384•
*FRA:	No it's, it's got all the power bits to make that other one go. •194511_194973•
        It's got a tube that would make the  the other one go. •194973_195320•
        Dunno. •195320_195437•
        But it's losing a set that way innit? •195449_195949•
*STE:	See the tube for the Grundig I think  it won't help   •195992_196433•
*FRA:	No be worth trying won't it? •196433_196687•
        Mm. •196687_196695•
*STE:	And I could get  fifty five or sixty for this   •196695_196902•

*STE:	won't tune  and erm   •196917_197056•
