*MAR:	Here gigantic   (.) gi , we use to have a word of the day when erm Ian was here, use to put word of the day up on the board
*TON:	Mm, mm.
*MAR:	What we do is take the, the day of the week and the, the calendar date, it might be the   (        ) say it was the fourth day of the week Thursday
*TON:	Yeah.
*MAR:	And it was July, it's got to  (        ) .It was the third day in July, page four, seven, three and then I had to find a word that I'd never heard off before and put it up on the board.
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*MAR:	Like gromwell, (        ) . ((laugh)) .
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) .
*MAR:	And then people would put up there suggestions of what a gromwell was   ((laugh)) .
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) .
*MAR:	It was good fun, we won't, I won't re-institute that one.
*UNK:	Yeah that's good.
*MAR:	Ginormous, where are we, ginormous, erm, no it's not in here and er G Y or J I or J Y so no it doesn't   (        )  (        ) .
*TON:	No , but eh, another word that was   (.) I've heard used, and it was, actually it was quite annoying because the chap used it, used it wrongly, but I didn't know that he'd used it wrongly at the time.
*MAR:	Mm, mm.What   (        ) .
*TON:	It was paradigm.
*MAR:	Paradigm?
*TON:	Yes.
*MAR:	Yeah, paradigm that, that's a bit like a paradox but completely different
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*MAR:	What, what is it   (        ) as a paradigm .
*TON:	You, you, you can't, yeah , you said you can't use er money as a paradigm for energy.
*MAR:	Ah.
*TON:	And what he really meant to say was, you can't use money as a er a   (.) as a sort of parallel to energy, but paradigm doesn't mean parallel, it means something, something different.
*MAR:	It does, doesn't it?
*TON:	Yeah.
*MAR:	I mean it's not   (        ) they way you expect it either, yeah, paradigm means example of pattern of, reflection of noun, hence parasite, big  (        ) .
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) .
*MAR:	No, I don't think I believe   (        ) at all.
*TON:	No, but, he was using it as, as a fancy word for parallel and he wasn't using it properly.The trouble is I didn't know because I've never heard the word before.
*MAR:	So, you could off asked him, what's he mean by the word paradigm.
*TON:	Yeah.
*MAR:	Because I've never used that word before, he'll say something completely pathetic.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
*MAR:	At least you'll know what he meant by it.
*TON:	 ((laugh)) .
