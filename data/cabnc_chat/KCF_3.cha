(        ) 
*HER:	Well the thing is if he can get four hundred quid why doesn't he get one of them new bikes that Sinclair's brought out? (.) Well, they run for an hour on a battery   (.) without pedalling, three hours if you pedal.
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	It's a bike   (.) it's electric. (.) It's a battery.It's a bike and you go   (.) like that to get it going and then you, it rides along.Isn't it?

*ALI:	Oh that's not bad is it?Cos you can pay that for a blooming mountain bike.
*HER:	Yeah.And it'll run for an hour   (.) without pedalling.If you pedal you can get as much as three hours.A penny   (.) it costs a penny to recharge it, it recharges in an hour. (.) So if you go

*HER:	No but if you go from here to work isn't it?Plug it in   (.) in the what's name, pull lead off it and plug it in   (.) and then it'll
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*HER:	 (        ) a penny, say here's a penny.And then he's ready to come back home again isn't he? (.) Plug it in here   (.) give your mam a penny.

*HER:	Ah but you've got a British passport. (.) You're not a resident of Gambia. (.) You're a British  (.) 
*ALI:	 (        ) they don't know.And you can vote loads of times there.You're not on a register.
*HER:	They put a stamp on you.
*ALI:	Stamp on where?
*HER:	On your hand.
*ALI:	Well it must be able to wash off.
*HER:	Well aye   (        ) 
*ALI:	And you don't have to be twenty one either.
*HER:	You don't have to here, it's only eighteen here.
*ALI:	No but   (        ) twenty one aren't you?You've got to be twenty one to vote there but if you're, you're eighteen and you go in and somebody else says you're twenty one you can vote. (.) 
*HER:	The   (.) why the Pakistanis can vote in this country   (.) they've got a British passport.

*HER:	 (        ) the empire we allowed them to have British passports didn't we?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*HER:	They can get them because they are British.
*ALI:	Pakistan's British?
*HER:	Well it was, it was in the empire.It's in the commonwealth isn't it?And Indians and all this.And this is why we're trying to stop them coming in. (.) There's ten thousand a week coming in. (.) 
*ALI:	Every week?
*HER:	 ((laugh))  (.) They're coming in from everywhere.And this is what the, the   (        ) what's name now   (.) that when it's opened in nineteen ninety two   (.) the communist block will be able to come through Germany this way in.Straight into this country.And be doing all our   (.) they will be gonna come and do all the jobs that we don't want like in, in   (.) catering and, and things like that.All the rough jobs.They get in here   (.) then they bring their families and then they're gonna   (.) fill the country up aren't they?It's only a little tiny country.The Conservatives are trying to stop it.Th they're trying to get it through, the bill through. (        ) 
*ALI:	And Labour won't stop them?
*HER:	No, Labour will allow them in.Course, what you've got to think of, Conservatives are the one that started it in the first place.So they've gotta try and kill it off now.But the Labour won't.But they didn't start it.Some things are very complicated   (        ) Alison.You've got to   (.) thingybob all through everything. (.) Anything else you wanna know?

((laugh))  (.)  [laughing] and then    (        )  [] and then he said when he turned the wine, they would say well we wanted white wine not red wine. ((laugh)) 
*ALI:	Well it is true though isn't it?Whoever it, whoever it is it's not gonna be right for everybody.
*HER:	 ((laugh)) Oh god!But it, that was on here.Because he was   (.) doing complaining and all that then this, this one   (.) er Roger said that. [laughing]  (        ) wouldn't be any salt and vinegar. (.) Or somebody would have said well we wanted brown bread, not white bread  [] . (.) Well Alison let's go and get    (        )  (.)
