*PS04U:	Mm .  2158273_2158333
*PS04Y:	He pays the small amount and in fact I keep on meaning at the back of my brain to get hold of him and say has he been paying it Cos when when he was down at Andy 's Aerials I think he used to go on foot to the post office every week When he got his giro I think he used to pay then and there It 's only about a pound eighty a week or something for him .  2158983_2184803
*PS04U:	Mm .  2184803_2184863

*PS04U:	Can they afford to stay .  2209653_2210803
*PS04Y:	Marginally now that Shirley has got a job That .  2211943_2214573
*PS04U:	So they just sort of put it on the market to see if it would sell .  2215233_2217583
*PS04Y:	Well at the time they put it on the market we we all three thought that it would be a good idea if if both families sold up and moved into something smaller and perhaps moved near to each other .  2218173_2230603
*PS04U:	each other 0 . 
*PS04Y:	in Stowmarket But now I I just do n't think that 's going to happen I I do n't I honestly Brenda I do n't know whether I 'm going to come back down here Whether I 'm going to move to Norwich Whether I 'm going to stay in Stowmarket So to be truthful Brenda I 'm happier not thinking about it .  2232153_2250493
*PS04U:	You 've just got ta what mood the mood sort of takes you .  2250623_2254213
*PS04Y:	Exactly Er at the moment I 'm I mean I 'm even thinking of of redecorating my bedroom .  2254213_2260253
*PS04U:	Dave even came up with an idea we was talking about the other day And he said what why does n't Jean rent Put your money in the capital rent and live on the capital Let the interest rent .  2261243_2273573
*PS04Y:	Well I have thought about that vaguely Brenda It 'll all depend on what the situation is when I sell .  2276033_2282593
*PS04U:	He said that cos then you know he said she she would have no upkeep of the house .  2283213_2286193
*PS04Y:	Mm That 's right That 's right But I I do n't know whether Dave has I mean you see my friend Pam whose husband Steve is an airline pilot she knows quite a bit about this because Steve was an illegitimate child in London in West Ham His mother was an office cleaner and she conceived Steve by a married man Erm a poor working class man No question of a divorce and marriage she just had to get on with it She was able to keep Steve because where she lived within the er there was a little coronet of little tatty houses that have since been pulled down and she was related to fifteen in fifteen out of the twenty two houses she had a relative .  2286943_2338135
*PS04U:	Mm .  2338795_2338855
*PS04Y:	So she could always dump the baby on somebody .  2339005_2341205
*PS04U:	Mm .  2341205_2341275
*PS04Y:	She 'd got built-in babysitting facilities And Steve knows a lot about being poor And Pam said that Steve said to her that when he was at West Ham grammar school boys grammar school everybody knew that the people who were best off were the council house people .  2341335_2357465
*PS04U:	Mm .  2358505_2358625
*PS04Y:	If you were in private accommodation you were noth you were nothing like so well off You see I have lived in private rented accommodation with my mother in the late nineteen thirties .  2358625_2371495
*PS04U:	I 'll just open these doors cos it 'll be too cold to go out there once we go out so cold with the glass .  2371915_2380085
*PS04Y:	Mm .  2380245_2380415
*PS04U:	and the trouble is if you do n't have the here .  2382235_2385655
*PS04Y:	Yes .  2386845_2386935
*PS04U:	to circulate and .  2387165_2391455
*PS04Y:	And the trouble is that the the the English landlord has a name for being greedy And it it was n't very nice Brenda because landlords are entitled to inspect where you live Or they were .  2391455_2406795
*PS04U:	Yeah but you would n't b I mean like Dave said because er .  2406795_2409525
*PS04Y:	Because it was n't very comfortable You ca n't do exactly what you want in in a rented place You ca n't go putting up shelves and things .  2409735_2416135
*PS04U:	Yeah but in searching I mean Sorry .  2416135_2417165
*PS04Y:	You ca n't go putting up shelves If you put shelves on the wall in a rented house those those shelves immediately belong to the landlord .  2417165_2426535
*PS04U:	Mm .  2426535_2426855
*PS04Y:	That was the law then It may not be so now .  2429545_2431965
*PS04U:	No I was gon na say yeah because I know Cheryl and Andy they they had er erm th they rented a four bedroom detached house And they even actually decorated The landlord said to him you know she she she sort of took a lease out for three years on it .  2431965_2449335
*PS04Y:	Yes But until recently there has n't been a lot of rented accommodation And landlords have probably been quite pleased to get a decent tenant When my Mary-Ann had her rented rooms in Herne Hill they had the top floor of a of a three floor house And their landlord who was Polish was ever so delighted with them And he said you know he talked to them and he said you can do whatever you like because Mary-Ann and Mitch were superior people They were going to keep the place clean They were going to keep it warm They were n't going to to have wild parties .  2449335_2489725
*PS04U:	Mm But but her place she had erm it was unfurnished erm but it was fantastic .  2489725_2497355
*PS04Y:	Dave has got a point And the thought has crossed my mind And thank him very much for his idea and I will .  2497355_2504005
*PS04U:	He makes me laugh cos he often says some when I it 's when I 've spoken to you on the phone .  2504005_2508445
*PS04Y:	Yeah .  2508585_2508675
*PS04U:	and I 'll come back and he 'll say has Jean thought about renting Bren I said she do n't wan na rent and he said why He said if she then sold her house he said put the capital he said alright he said she with not buying a you know another house now you know the fact is he said alright if she got one in her area or wherever He said then she can put her capital he says and the interest on the capital .  2508675_2530715
*PS04Y:	Mm .  2530715_2530795
*PS04U:	that can pay the rent .  2530815_2532095
*PS04Y:	Mm But you see .  2532095_2532795
*PS04U:	And I said yeah but then she 's got no house to lead to a .  2534615_2538465
*PS04Y:	Mm And you 're at the mercy of the landlord putting the rent up Brenda I mean I know that people have been hit by the mortgage rise and of course in my lifetime I 've never known anything like this Nobody has .  2538465_2550685
*PS04U:	Well like I mean I said to him I do n't think you know I mean it was just ideas I think he said I 'm not saying do it .  2550825_2556275
*PS04Y:	Yes And I 'm glad of people 's ideas because .  2556275_2558015
*PS04U:	But I said I do n't think it 's a good idea And and I said he 's got you know she 'd have nothing to leave And he said yeah but both her children are .  2558025_2565365
*PS04Y:	Well my children are not worried about that .  2565365_2566575
*PS04U:	That 's what he said He said they 're both you know .  2566575_2568335
*PS04Y:	No they 're not They 're not .  2568335_2569195

*PS04Y:	Mm Mm Mm .  2574615_2575215
*PS04U:	he said You know to them he said it would n't be matter if there was nothing .  2575215_2578005
*PS04Y:	No it would n't .  2578205_2579175
*PS04U:	Because they 're both sort of comfortable and .  2579175_2580595
