*TRA:	Also, we ordered the armature, it came through a couple of days ago, we put it, but it's going the opposite direction. •09425_51825•
*ANN:	 ((cough)) 
*TRA:	It actually er one going into in detail, there's one load of armature's the wrong way. •62325_101025•
*DAV:	Turn it over. •105625_110925•
*ANN:	 ((cough)) 
*TRA:	Eh? •111825_113925•
*DAV:	Turn it over. •117025_126025•
*TRA:	We we've tried to pull , but if you pull all the , swap the  the leads round  or shove the brush leads round which is the obvious thing to do in that case, you know, er  in that  no they're successfully sparking excessively. •126025_221925•
        So, we're gonna have to obviously send the armature back for  at er •227925_270625•
*DAV:	And they can also switch one. •270625_284125•
*TRA:	No, I would  recognize the   you know  •287725_311425•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*TRA:	. •_•
        There's a colour code on them. •320925_333125•
*DAV:	What three more? •333125_342425•
*TRA:	No, it won't be that long. •342425_366025•
*DAV:	Well see, if you're desperate for a machine I'll lend you one •366025_394125•
