*LYN:	I used to take them every day and I was like that right, and then what I used to do   (.) on a Sunday I wouldn't take one cos I used to think right I like my Sunday dinner and I will never give up my Sunday dinner when I'm dieting right 
*DEB:	Oh no.
*LYN:	I'll always have my Sunday dinner 
*HAY:	Oh I tell you what
*LYN:	so on a Sunday I used to say right I'm not gonna take my tablets today because it's a waste of a tablet if you're gonna eat   (.) like that, and on a Sunday I used to be absolutely exhausted   (.) because you take them all the time and they keep you going and then when you stop taking them   (.) they've just, you wind down 
*DEB:	When you stop taking them altogether now do you mean?

*LYN:	She, exactly
*HAY:	Yeah.
*LYN:	I'm, I'm like that.I'm all   (        ) look, that's all fat.I haven't got fat legs really, I mean I put stockings on and a short skirt and I put something long on and   (.) from the back Russell said you look skinny he says, when you turn round and you see   (.) that
*DEB:	Yeah.

*LYN:	Yeah but you're on cloud nine.
*HAY:	Yeah I am.
*LYN:	And when I took those   (        ) I didn't come down for a, and that frightened me, I said to Russell I will never ever take speed   (.) because it's if, I was er we were in the pub right on a Sunday morning and I was there but I wasn't there, I was somewhere else. (.) And people were just saying to me what's the matter?
*HAY:	I've taken speed as powder right   (.) and   (.) erm   (.) it had an effect   (        ) like these ones. (.) 
*LYN:	It's a   (        ) thirty   (.) have a look on the bottle if they're thirty 
*HAY:	Thirty mils yeah.
*LYN:	They're thirty mils, they're the strongest ones see.
*HAY:	Yeah.
*LYN:	You can get twenty five.
*HAY:	Get fifteen too isn't there, sometimes you can 
*LYN:	Yeah.You can get erm a red and a grey one   (.) I think that's the fifteen, then you can get a yellow and a grey one, that's the twenty five.
*HAY:	And the all yellow ones are the thirty.
*LYN:	Are the thirty.
*HAY:	Yeah.Perhaps I'm going a bit too strong see. (.) Cos I mean for someone like me, I was saying that like, before I used to say to you   (.) I wouldn't eat all day, right?But then, when I le left you and went to work I'd eat those pasties and crisps and then perhaps I'm still hungry, sometimes I'd go and have a Chinese all at the wrong time, that's what all that is innit?
*LYN:	When I lost 
*HAY:	And then lying on it.
*LYN:	 [yawning] when I lost my weight with slimming we were try I was losing two pounds   [] a week and I weren't starving, I was still drinking   (.) and it come off and I lost, I lost about   (.) I think it was about eighteen pounds, it was over a stone.I s I was still only down to sort of eleven stone, but if I get to like ten stone 
*HAY:	 (        ) 
*DEB:	Yeah.
*LYN:	something   (.) but I'm not a small person.I mean like you're quite small framed aren't you so, if you went up to ten stone you'd look huge
*HAY:	Yeah.
*LYN:	but ten stone something 
*UNK:	I used to be eleven stone.
*LYN:	and I look quite slim because I'm not a small person.
*HAY:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	I used to be eleven stone, when I was eighteen, nineteen I was eleven stone Hayle.And that's honest to God.
*HAY:	Never well you must've looked big Deb cos you're small.
*UNK:	Oh I was massive man I had a double chin an'all.My arms were massive.
*LYN:	I don't remem  (        ) remember you like that.I never remember you like that.
*UNK:	No well I wasn't.I moved to   (        ) from Nelson and that's when I was big.
*LYN:	And how did you lose all your weight then?You just lost it?
*UNK:	I went on an egg diet   (.) with the girls in work 
*HAY:	Egg diet?I thought 
*UNK:	Yes.
*HAY:	they were fattening.
*UNK:	No it wasn't just eggs though it was erm   (.) like salads and there was steak, you could have one meal a day, right, but it was eggs for your breakfast, eggs for your dinner, your lunch
*HAY:	Now I love eggs   (        ) but I thought eggs 
*UNK:	and then it was salad 
*HAY:	binded you.
*UNK:	They do.They do bind you
*LYN:	But you'd have to take something to make you 
*UNK:	but the thing is you can you eat fruit in between see Hayle so you're having   (.) you know,you your roughage.
*LYN:	Yeah your roughage with that yeah.
*HAY:	Oh I see.
*UNK:	As well like in between.
*LYN:	When I went to slimming I used to get   (        ) 
*UNK:	I tell you what I lost a stone and half in two weeks
*LYN:	I used to have erm 
*UNK:	by sticking to that.
*LYN:	I'd get up in the morning I'd have my two pieces of wholemeal bread toasted with a scraping of marmalade on, right, and my butter cos I like that.For my dinner then I'd have er jacket potato with tuna   (.) then about four o'clock I would have an apple and an orange and maybe a Mars Bar cos   (        ) right.And then before eight o'clock then I would make myself a big meal, I'd have a, a huge salad   (.) I'd do tinned potatoes cos they were, on this diet tinned potatoes aren't fattening
*HAY:	Aren't they?
*UNK:	No they're not.
*LYN:	No so I'd have tinned potatoes 
*HAY:	I don't like them I don't like   (        ) 
*LYN:	I'd have tuna fish, I'd have ham, everything because you can eat as much meat   (.) you could sit down and eat   (.) cabbage, swedes, runner beans, cauliflower, peas   (.) every vegetable 
*DEB:	That's what I'm doing for him now.But I don't like veg I don't.
*LYN:	and that's not counted in your, in your calories, you can just eat that, it's all free so you can eat as much as you like of that.Cos if I was really hungry I used to go upstairs, I'd get all the frozen veg out, I'd cook a bit of everything
*HAY:	It's not so bad   (        ) 
*LYN:	I'd slam a pork chop under the grill and I'd just eat that.And it used to fill me up and I'd 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*LYN:	that's nothing then, I could eat as much as that as I liked. (.) And bacon's not fattening grilled on this diet, you can eat as much bacon as you like as long as you cut the fat off and grill it.
*DEB:	That's on this Slimming World diet is it?
*LYN:	It's marvellous yeah, I lost weight on it. (.) 
*DEB:	What we'll have to do Hayley right, when she starts now she'll have to tell us what she's eating every day 
*LYN:	I've got a book in the house.
*HAY:	Yeah.
*DEB:	and then we can do the same.
*LYN:	I've got a book in the house.
*DEB:	And we can always 
*LYN:	Well I'll have a new book now when I go, right, and you can have my old one.
*HAY:	Thing is it is healthier and I mean this tablet lark now more I'm thinking about it, right
*DEB:	Oh Hayley it's not doing you any good at all.
*HAY:	it w I, it can't be, I, (        ) 
*LYN:	Hayley I tell you what, have a word with my mother because my mother's done it for years, always taken tablets, and I reckon this is half her problem now cos she's got to her old age   (.) she's on the change, and these things have affected her throughout her life now.Cos my mother has taken slimming tablets, I can remember a kid, being a kid and my mother always used to take slimming tablets to lose weight.She's done it all her life and 
*HAY:	She stopped me in town funny enough erm oh a good couple of weeks ago like, she says to me   (.) oh have you heard, cos I was saying about oh we'd seen something in the shop, it was ever so nice, I said oh I'm too fat for that she said ooh have you seen, she must be erm infat you know bloody infatuated with dieting
