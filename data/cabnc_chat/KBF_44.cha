        Erm I mean he he he's bought, I mean  the presents he's bought to be honest I mean I think oh my god what a waste. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•

*BRE:	they'll like something like this. •_•
        I mean stupid •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	but I mean  you don't think erm  cos he said to me he said oh I suppose I'd better buy you a Christmas present and I said yeah buy me something that I'd use. •_•
        He said what I said well if you're gonna me anything, buy me a tin of biscuits. •_•
*JEA:	Mm quite. •_•
*BRE:	He said  tin of biscuits? •_•
        I said •_•
*JEA:	I think that's a most acceptable present. •_•
        It really is. •_•
*BRE:	Because  you know it's stupid things like that •_•
*JEA:	I know that Bob and Glynis will be delighted to have some because he's been out of work. •_•
        Alright, he invested the money that he received as a  gratuity from British Telecom when he was made redundant. •_•
        And he gets in about three thousand six hundred a year  on that. •_•
        It's a lot of money. •_•
        I think they paid him out  thirty thousand or something like that. •_•
        He'd been with them for twenty seven years. •_•
*BRE:	God. •_•
*JEA:	He joined when he was seventeen or sixteen. •_•
        Made redundant. •_•
        He cannot get another job. •_•
*BRE:	We were saying that Ron in number four  he was a builder. •_•
        He had his own business, van, the whole lot he had staff working for him. •_•
        And he hurt his back last year and the doctor said well  you'll either be dead within six months. •_•
        You've gotta give up the building work. •_•
        He's only thirty odd  thirty seven, thirty eight. •_•
        Given it up and he said oh well  got no kids you know they live in this house, got no kids. •_•
        And they always have a holiday abroad and they go out a lot, good social life. •_•
        They eat out once a week, you know. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	And, because she can't have children  and er  this was what, last June it all happened? •_•
        He said oh alright, I'll do something you know, cement or milkman •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	or something just casual, couple of hours. •_•
        Couldn't get nothing. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        No. •_•
*BRE:	Absolutely nothing. •_•
        And say he's round about the fortyish  age and we spoke to him last week and  I said you got a job yet? •_•
        He said no and I'm getting worried now he said me, my wife works full time and we could cope on the money but  he said now we don't go out. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	You know, once a fortnight. •_•
        He said we're not getting the luxuries like we could when we were both working full time. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	He said we're surviving. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        Oh yes. •_•
*BRE:	Cos they've got a next to nothing mortgage. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	But er •_•
*JEA:	Yeah it's like with me, I mean of course don't forget that I've got a good two hundred pounds to come  on about the fifth of December from the British Legion's savings. •_•
*BRE:	Oh of course you have. •_•
*JEA:	I've been saving five pounds a week  for practically the whole of the year. •_•
        And that will be chucked into the building society  so that I can, when I get my Marks and Spencers debt come through, I can pay a great wodge off. •_•
*BRE:	Off that. •_•
*JEA:	But I shall still have to draw on some capital Brenda, nevertheless. •_•
*BRE:	You will. •_•
        I mean you have to Christmas time though don't you? •_•
*JEA:	Well erm  I have thought now what shall I do after Christmas? •_•
        Because you know I like January. •_•
        I've achieved a Christmas. •_•
        I've made everybody happy. •_•
*BRE:	That's right. •_•
*JEA:	And  I thought that sewing machine is really going to get out to work. •_•
        And I'm not going to buy any fabric. •_•
        I'm going to make up the fabric I've got. •_•
        And it's, I'm going to do things for the house  like I want to make erm  Chris  has put back the rail over my windowsill. •_•
        I don't whether you remember I had a bamboo pole. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	And I made a, a thing and it looked awful •_•
*BRE:	I know you said. •_•
*JEA:	and I took it down. •_•
        But I bought some  beautiful crimson bias binding from Laura Ashley  don't laugh but I'm taking the valance of Paul's bed •_•
*BRE:	I remember you saying. •_•
*JEA:	because it's a white valance. •_•
        And I'm going to have this white  frill  er erm roll, and I'm going to roll the fabric  I'm going to leave all the pleating, not cut into that, but cut the valance platform and fold it over if you understand me and make it go over the  the pole. •_•
*BRE:	That's a good idea. •_•
*JEA:	Erm so that I'll have oh plenty of gathers you see but the pole will be smooth. •_•
        My mistake was to  to spread something through that went into horrid, nasty gathers on the pole. •_•
        Didn't look anything, just looked messy. •_•
        So I thought have it smooth over the pole and then all frilly underneath and this lovely line of  soft crimson. •_•
        And I thought you know I mean when, when erm Philip goes and I'm in the en suite in, in the en suite bedroom. •_•
        Everybody says it does pay you to have the house looking fresh. •_•
        That room  the paint to my eye has either faded or changed colour or something. •_•
        Now I noticed this with  in the sitting room this year I got John , friend of Nev's to repaint the walls because do you remember they were called soft peach? •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	And I looked at them and I thought, that isn't soft peach any more. •_•
        That's a glaring pink. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	I suspect that Dulux emulsion paint changes colour. •_•
*BRE:	Oh yeah it does. •_•
        Tell you what I've got, it's a marvellous thing. •_•
        The decorators at Peter's works  cos they, they erm  tradesmen they've got a colour card. •_•
*JEA:	Ah yes I've got that. •_•
*BRE:	Have you  this is the tradesmen's card. •_•
*JEA:	Which one is it? •_•
*BRE:	It's a Dulux but you can't get it from the shop. •_•
        It's tradesmen. •_•
*JEA:	No that's right. •_•
        Erm Anthony  Anthony got me that. •_•
*BRE:	Got one, yeah? •_•
        Marvellous aren't they •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	cos you got every single •_•
*JEA:	Which year is it? •_•
*BRE:	Now. •_•
        This year. •_•
*JEA:	Oh I haven't got the up to date one. •_•
        Let's have a quick gander through. •_•
        Erm  so I thought  what have I got? •_•
        I've actually got a great load still of gardenia and white mixed which is what  was put on the walls in the sitting room. •_•
        I thought I'll put that on the walls in the bedroom. •_•
        I'm not going to bother to go out and buy new paint when I've got a damn great tub •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	of this lovely soft pale cream. •_•
        Erm  I don't know whether I was with you when I bought er rolls of  •_•
*BRE:	Borders. •_•
*JEA:	Borders. •_•
        I've got a very pale grey. •_•
*BRE:	Remember that in Marks and Sparks a couple of months back they were selling borders off and I bought a beautiful aqua one. •_•
        And they were fifty p each on a background  •_•
*JEA:	I wonder if they're still doing them? •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
        They were just, it was just a one day I went round there shopping and they had, and I bought some beige ones for the kitchen. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Erm  and it cost me two quid I think for the four. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	And I mean I haven't put them up yet. •_•
        I thought I'll wait to, I sort of really, like the bathroom I want to  it's got the wallpaper starting to peel off. •_•
*JEA:	speaking of wallpaper, I am going to paper the en suite. •_•
        Er I only need two rolls. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	Possibly even one. •_•
        So I'm going to look in the, in the bin. •_•
        And I shall make some more little cushions for the bedroom and I'm going to use this idea of  terribly ordinary cotton •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	there's nothing wonderful about the cotton, but the cushions look absolutely superb because  there were just thin lines of the, you can tell it was when you looked at it quite cheap ribbon  but just arranged in a beautiful square and then a little bit of lace. •_•
*BRE:	like those tissue boxes. •_•
        Now I've got a friend of mine that makes them. •_•
        Now that was seven ninety nine that you bought for Rosemary. •_•
        Now that was  Marks, they're nice ones. •_•
        Now she gets them and she sells them for ten quid. •_•
*JEA:	I say. •_•
*BRE:	And they're not, I mean they're pretty but they're not  that magnolia range in Marks is lovely. •_•
*JEA:	That's lovely yes. •_•
*BRE:	And  but she sells them. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	You know she does parties as well, but •_•
*JEA:	Yeah, yeah. •_•
*BRE:	she said she  she's losing the profit  at selling them at ten pounds. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Because the lace, the time. •_•
        She said tissue •_•
*JEA:	Do you remember when we tried to make fluffy dogs? •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	And we found we just  were were wasting our time. •_•
*BRE:	Wasting our time . •_•
*JEA:	You're up against the factory conveyor belt system of sewing when you, one person does only ears and the other does bodies and •_•
*BRE:	That's right. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Yes that is lovely. •_•
*BRE:	It's good isn't it? •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	I think we ought to get some kip. •_•
*JEA:	I think so. •_•
        I hate to but erm  •_•
*BRE:	talk  for tonight. •_•
*JEA:	I must. •_•
*BRE:	I wanna  in a minute. •_•
*JEA:	No and we must. •_•
*BRE:	It's quarter past twelve. •_•
*JEA:	I don't like going up late, nor do you. •_•
*BRE:	Right   •_•
*JEA:	But we'll have plenty of sleep. •_•
        I mean I think five, six hour's sleep is absolutely enough. •_•
*BRE:	Oh yeah. •_•
        I'll get Dave to set the alarm and then we can have breakfast before we sort of rush out. •_•
        Otherwise I'll sleep through. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        Well that's partly what did me today. •_•
        I was , you see I, I have to set a good example to Neil. •_•
        And I was determined that everywhere although not absolutely superbly glittering, everywhere was going to be tidy before I left. •_•
        So I went through every blessed room. •_•
        Tidy tidy tidy. •_•
        Throwing away rubbish  you know what it is. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	Bitsy bitsy bitsy of this and that and the other. •_•
        Came out without anything inside me and then had this ghastly experience of not, I was, I was banking on being able to get a hot cup of coffee on the train. •_•
        No coffee. •_•
        And then  this wretched journey. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	And I got thoroughly upset. •_•
*BRE:	Oh you could tell right on the phone you were sort of all keyed up with it. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	Do you need a drink of water or anything? •_•
*JEA:	No thanks dear. •_•
*BRE:	You're alright. •_•
        You might hear Dave switch that off in the morning. •_•
        Erm but he probably won't. •_•
