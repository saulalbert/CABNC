*ALI:	Slightly younger than me erm, no, but he'd mentioned that and he said erm 
*BOB:	 (  ) 
*ALI:	if he wanted to book again that she could let her, his, her villa. So it's free for October, the complete month of October and erm he hasn't booked a flight yet because the fares are so expensive. 
*BOB:	 (  )  (.) Did he tell you how much they charge? 
*ALI:	Yes. The last time you saw Raymond, remember he said it was erm, how much further. I think there's gonna be six this time. There's Raymond and his wife and his wife Sherry's I think brother and his wife and little baby and then somebody else. So there'll be six people. So they've got to book the flight but they might book it nearer the time when hopefully they'll get a cheaper flight. He's tried direct flights and so on but he thought four hundred pounds, four hundred and fifty was a bit much although he'll get the villa so cheaply. 
*BOB:	Yeah. 
*ALI:	So he goes in October   (  ) you went and er  same time as us   
*BOB:	 Quiet, Annabel   
*ALI:	September the thirtieth, first two weeks in October, Bobby. First two weeks in October. 
*BOB:	 (  ) 
*ALI:	But, that's what he wants just now but if he can get the flight then it, it could end up being the second and third or the third and fourth week. But Ann says it's  free the whole month   
*BOB:	  (  )  
*ALI:	well he can't cos he's self-employed. A lovely young chap, Bobby. He's a nice young man, I like him. Very sweet chappy.
