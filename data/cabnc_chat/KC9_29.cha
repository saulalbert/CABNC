*GIN:	 (        ) .
*UNK:	Oh doesn't   (        ) look funny with the hand bag  (        ) .

*UNK:	 (        ) .

*GIN:	You could give him a book token let him do his own   (        ) .
*VIC:	Well that's a good idea , the thing, you see the thing is she says oh, we, I read anything, you know, buy anything, well I said well suppose you've already got it, you know, it's erm, and also we offered him some, some author's names so he didn't like this, and he didn't want that, you see, so, erm, but, in one hand he's saying buy me anything and the other hand he's saying I don't like this and I don't like that
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	Yes, yes that's right, yes.
*GIN:	For a few hours.
*VIC:	Yeah, Yeah, you've got
*GIN:	Do you think that's true?
*VIC:	Yeah, would you, but a couple of years because John was busy he bought us all tokens, erm, he bought the others tokens from Woolworths and me token from a body shop and we all, (        ) and I we had great fun looking and seeing what we wanted to buy with, with the book tokens, er, maybe, maybe I mention it providing we can't find anything.
*GIN:	It's   (        ) pleasure of going around   (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah , and, and looking themselves, yeah.The other thing he mentioned for his birthday was, would you believe, was a shirt with  er, with sleeves that you can put erm cuff links in, would you believe?He said I've not been able to get one, and I went to   (        ) he said I thought with an old 
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah, quite often they do don't, well they used to I don't know if they do .
*GIN:	 (        )  (        ) .
*VIC:	Yes, but erm
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	No, no, cuff links look nice don't they?And I said to Polly they must make them, yeah 
*GIN:	The only thing you can do is  (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah.Polly's got some nice ones, yeah, yeah.
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah   (        ) got some nice one's
*GIN:	I get  (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Yes, I think they're   (        ) for myself, (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Yes, that's right, I see, but I said to him we'll try Alder's and the Army & Navy   (.) But I 
*GIN:	 (        )  (        ) shirts even if they're only Marks & Sparks   (        ) .
*VIC:	Yes, I've got yeah I know they did, but I think after a while they stopped doing that I think the latest ones you'll find don't, don't do that, they gave, you know, after a while they gave that up, but I, I must check on that, I must check on  (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        )  (.) if he wears a long sleeve shirt, as soon as he takes his jacket off, he won't go around with his shirt   (        ) 
*VIC:	No ,
*GIN:	roll his sleeves up.
*VIC:	roll his sleeves up, yeah Tom's like that, yes .
*GIN:	Even   (        ) , (        ) .
*VIC:	Yes, yes, well I mean, that's, that's, if, I mean if we can get him one for his birthday that, get the problem of our shoulders sort of thing, that's his then, then he, he has to take his  (        ) .
*GIN:	We  (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	 (        ) , what can you give him a  (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	Well that's a good idea, as you say, erm, oh I must put  (        ) .
*GIN:	I mean it could be a bottle of Gin  (        ) 
*VIC:	Oh he's not.
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	He was doing so well for three months.
*GIN:	When he saw the  (        ) 
*VIC:	Yes.
*GIN:	and he said you're  (        ) .
*VIC:	Yes, that's right, after three months, yes, and he did that?
*GIN:	Yes.
*VIC:	Oh, and he's still, he's going to do that right up to Christmas?
*GIN:	But he won't eat the meat with potatoes
*VIC:	No.
*GIN:	the only time he has meat he has to have green salad or maybe a raw vegetable salad.
*VIC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	But I mean , yeah, yeah
*VIC:	 (        ) , calorie   (        ) and then for another meal he'll have   (.) he'll have this other stuff with a  (        ) 
*VIC:	Mm.
*GIN:	he can't  (        ) .
*VIC:	No, no, (        ) doesn't it?
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Yeah, well John always swore by a   (        ) diet whether he   (        ) I don't know.
*UNK:	That thing I got, you know the Raptou use to
*VIC:	Oh yes, yes,
*UNK:	help me with the vegetables, all the vegetables, I get so tired chopping
*VIC:	yes
*GIN:	I don't think it's gonna work, I  (        ) .
*VIC:	Oh why's that Iris?It, it, looked alright, I, you know doing it on the telly, it did everything they said.
*GIN:	But   (        ) didn't see it on the telly, only saw it on the  (        ) .
*UNK:	Oh it was on quite a lot.
*VIC:	Sorry I've  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh no, (        ) interest.Why do you think it won't work?
*UNK:	This I read  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh, that's
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	My   (        ) are like that, going from the
*VIC:	 (        )  (.) oh er, he said I've taken, taken them out, (        ) 
*GIN:	Have you tried it?
*UNK:	No.I haven't even   (        ) it.
*GIN:	Oh.
*VIC:	I looked at the illustration and I thought no way is that ever going to do any thing that chops
*GIN:	Yeah, it
*VIC:	it never slice, or make chips
*GIN:	 (        )  (.) oh it, they showed you pictures of things coming out the squares
*UNK:	Yes, (        )  (.)  (        ) chip  (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Doesn't take a chunky chop does it?
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	Well how can it, because it, it, I think it's got to go through the thing here, if you see what I mean, it, it, the chop you'd have to push it through a little bit and then have a,
*GIN:	Yeah, a blade.
*VIC:	a, yeah, (        ) .
*GIN:	What's that then? (        ) plate, oh I don't
*VIC:	Oh that's the thing that you put behind it.
*GIN:	She could use that without putting  (        ) .
*VIC:	What, what, what, how can you stop it, how, how, how can you  (        ) , ((laugh)) .
*GIN:	Got to  (        ) .
*VIC:	 (        )  (.)  (        ) bigger than  (        ) .
*GIN:	But I can't see any thing here  (        ) .Push  (        ) .
*VIC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*VIC:	That sliced then, that is slicing, (        ) , nothing's got to stop them haven't they?
*GIN:	The fact that you've come to the end of the    (        )  (.) the  (        ) .
*VIC:	I can't think of any thing that would be of
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	It  (        ) .
