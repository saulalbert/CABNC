@Comment:	conversation #5 (Tape 071905)
*AUD:	Did you watch that on Hanratty? •1875_2785•
*ELA:	Yeah. •2785_3095•
        Yeah it was good. •3435_4055•
*AUD:	It was good. •4055_4625•
*ELA:	I know what I suppose it is a good case though. •5335_7905•
        And close to the end a few people that were hanged are innocent. •8245_10605•
        But I think if you did bring back hanging it'd cut out some of these flaming crimes. •10915_15925•
*AUD:	I do as well. •16565_16985•
*ELA:	You know, I mean, for all the  •17435_18155•
*GOR:	Well there should be some  •18155_18745•
*ELA:	if  •18795_18855•
*GOR:	degrees of it shouldn't there? •18855_19915•
*ELA:	I mean if, if it means that there's less, there's less people murdered or whatever then, I know it sounds easy to •19915_24585•
*AUD:	Yeah but if you're one of the innocent ones. •25015_28915•
*ELA:	I know, I said that to Kevin, if you're part of the family  •28915_31865•
*AUD:	Yeah. •31865_31925•
*ELA:	of the innocent  •31925_32345•
*AUD:	It's  •32345_32435•
*ELA:	one. •32435_32605•
*AUD:	very difficult. •32605_33455•
        It was funny case though Hanratty weren't it? •34205_36465•
        Because I mean she was a eye witness and she picked him out. •36465_39075•
*ELA:	I know, but she picked the wrong one out at first. •40235_41675•
*AUD:	At first  •42245_•
*ELA:	So •42725_42815•
*AUD:	yes, but er, you can understand the confusion really. •42815_46335•
        I don't know really. •47445_48295•
        I have very mixed feelings about it. •48295_50025•
*ELA:	But the whole, the whole case was ridiculous. •50025_52035•
*AUD:	I think he was up, er, I mean that  •52035_53245•
*ELA:	Alfonso. •54275_54595•
*AUD:	Alfonso  I think he was the guilty one really. •54595_57795•
*ELA:	Aha. •57795_57935•
*AUD:	I do. •58885_59325•
*ELA:	But like in the statement she said he was erm  a, original statement she said he was approximately thirty years of age. •59625_65475•
*AUD:	Yeah. •65505_65765•
*GOR:	I know. •65765_65855•
*ELA:	And then it was changed to twenty five! •65855_67545•
*AUD:	Mm. •67775_68015•
*GOR:	Mm. •68015_68075•
*ELA:	Things like that. •68785_69455•
*AUD:	The battle for him though has been going on for years  ain't it Gordon? •70745_74545•
*ELA:	I think it's sad that, I mean, even now, his name was cleared and his parents  •74545_78875•
*GOR:	It's no good. •79395_79675•
*ELA:	wouldn't know, and he wouldn't know and  •79675_81485•
*GOR:	Mm. •81485_81585•
*ELA:	It's too  •82615_82885•
*AUD:	Yeah. •82885_83005•
*ELA:	far too late int it? •83005_83965•
*GOR:	Yeah. •83985_84155•
*AUD:	Well his brothers are still alive. •84805_86265•
*ELA:	Well, yes. •86505_87365•
*AUD:	But I don't know really. •87905_89225•
        It's erm  difficult to say. •89225_92565•
*ELA:	Mm mm. •93915_94285•
*AUD:	I thought it was good. •94285_97105•
        But  •97105_97195•
*ELA:	Is that on every week something like that? •97195_98725•
        Or  is  •98725_99175•
*AUD:	No. •99175_99235•
*ELA:	that a one-off? •99235_99675•
*AUD:	No. •99675_100025•
        They'd obviously  •100025_100375•
*GOR:	It's a one-off. •100375_100845•
*AUD:	that was just one-off. •100845_101345•
        That was just one-off. •101345_103625•
        Well there's murders  •103625_104405•
*KEV:	I don't know. •104405_105115•
*AUD:	on, on, on a, on a Monday night now it's a True Crimes  that have never been solved. •105115_109955•
*ELA:	Er with Edward Woodward or something? •110275_111405•
*AUD:	Yes. •111405_111585•
        Well this week, it's Freddie Mills. •111585_113045•
        Now he was a very well known boxer when we were  young, in our teens weren't we Gordon? •113435_118535•
*GOR:	Mm. •118565_118715•
*AUD:	And he was the first  er, really, er boxer who became a celebrity. •118725_123275•
        You know, like Henry Cooper is  •123665_126345•
*ELA:	Yeah. •126345_126685•
*AUD:	now? •126775_127025•
        Well he mixed with all the stars  and of course, I suppose part of the underworld, but er  they reckon that he didn't kill himself, I mean they did bring it in as suicide but er  they reckon that  you know, there's people think he was murdered. •127025_142365•
*ELA:	Oh I see, so •142365_143235•
*AUD:	He was a good boxer weren't he Gordon? •143235_146175•
