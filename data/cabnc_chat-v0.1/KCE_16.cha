*HEL:	 (        ) 
*AND:	Except that this is highly highly illegal information   •124294_124417•

        Heat the thread of the bulb very carefully to melt the glue, remove thread slowing drawing out the filament, do not break the  electrical  or filament will, just won't work  pour the liquid into the bulb and slowly lower the filament back  dipped in some . •126190_127308•
        Redo the thread back on and turn it into a socket frequently used by the victim and get the hell out. •127362_127786•
*HEL:	and like what accent people are talking at •127815_127975•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Yeah. •127975_127982•
        Well it's how we, it's how we usually talk isn't it? •127992_128123•

*HEL:	What? •128393_128402•
*MAR:	We don't  that much  •128432_128491•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	No but I mean   conversation, it's conversation with my friends and conversation with my parents  •128498_128801•
*AND:	When the victim switches the switch he will be in for a big surprise. •128825_129130•
        Basically you've killed him. •129268_129340•
        It just blows the whole room up. •129340_129560•
        Have fun it says underneath . •129683_129832•
*HEL:	till tomorrow. •130530_130574•
        I've only done three tapes, he gave me twenty. •130574_130745•
*MAR:	He gave you twenty tapes? •130745_130855•
*AND:	Yeah here you are this is a good one, calcium carbine bomb . •130855_130997•
        This is extremely dangerous. •131002_131081•
*MAR:	And they wanted you to do all of them? •131081_131178•

        You only have to do as many as you can. •131185_131304•

*AND:	and put it in a glass jar with some water, put a lid on tightly. •132439_132640•
        The carbine will react with the water to produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in cutting torches. •132640_133214•
        Eventually the glass will explode from internal pressure, it will leave a burning ragged hole and you get a nice fire ball. •133214_133713•
