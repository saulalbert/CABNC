*UNK:	Well it says jeans and a jumper or trousers and a jumper. •247238_247595•
        I mean it it well no it says thick trousers and a warm cardigan or a jumper. •247854_248527•
        Erm I mean I should think you want to take some shorts in case it's warm do you. •248541_249201•
*CLA:	Yeah. •249201_249214•
*HEL:	You going to take your white trousers? •249270_249431•
        Your new white ones? •249534_249612•

*HEL:	Are you going to wear those at the disco? •249612_249923•
*CLA:	Yes. •249923_249939•
*HEL:	Rather than your black ones? •250150_250209•
*CLA:	Yes. •250553_250568•
*HEL:	I thought you could probably take both. •250816_251318•
        I don't think it's been very erm generous with out of school wear but you can change when you get back. •251318_252018•
        I think you'd better take your Scots Park jumper and your red cardigan in case you manage to spill •252018_252936•
*CLA:	yes •252936_252945•
*HEL:	all your dinner down your Scotch Park jumper or something •252945_253186•
*CLA:	Yeah •253218_253224•
*HEL:	because you haven't got two. •253280_253356•
*CLA:	 (        )  (.) 
*HEL:	Well you've got that one that Daddy put on in the wash and washed too hot. •253359_254539•
*CLA:	Yeah  •254618_254624•
