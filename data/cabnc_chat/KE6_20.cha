*WEN:	She said she didn't hear them.Yesterday afternoon, well it started off on Saturday   (.) and he ended up outside that house   (.) I'm outside ours   (.) there was three cars in the drive which you cannot get!Right?So one went right across the pavement.
*SAN:	Terrible!Yeah.
*WEN:	Now added to that   (.) by our wall   (.) there was this ruddy great lorry again   (.) it's a great bit thing with an open back right?We a long
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	open back.So they park that up on the   (.) pavement outside our wall   (.) didn't come to our gate   (.) but, and then   (.) didn't it obstruct Alan's because they had it on the pavement, so anybody going down the pavement
*SAN:	Out in the road.
*WEN:	had to go out in the road!So I said to Mick   (.) I'm sure that's illegal.Well he don't know!Anyway, so   (.) banging doors   (.) people galore!So come yesterday   (.) there was   (.) people going and all this business   (.) and it ended up   (.) with just   (.) her car and one red one   (.) then the red one goes out   (.) she goes with the woman   (.) they're outside there   (.) two of those bloody King Charles!And they were in the front room going wild!Then the afternoon, we'd had lunch   (.) anyway   (.) I'd got up out the chair, I was so bloody livid!I got up out the chair and er   (.) went out the front door   (.) and   (.) I said to her for God's sake it's Sunday!What do you mean?I said well hell well you've got them going in there full pelt   (.) you don't go in there to stop it!And she said I can't hear them when I'm outside.And I said, everybody can hear when they're walking down the pavement!And er   (.) I said to her, you know, you must realise that   (.) when we're in here we can hear, no, you'd of thought they was in   (.) around our feet!Well I can't hear them!She had the door open at the moment   (.) with these bloody dogs yapping   (.) and she looked at me and said I can't hear them!So, I said to her right, I said   (.) you wanna be in here   (.) live in here   (.) I said I'll invite you in!And she went in and shut the door!Well wha , that's it!Mick said to me, what did she say?What did she say?So I told him!And I said, you know, quite honestly Sandra she does nothing   (.) to stop these dogs.
*SAN:	She's deaf is she?
*WEN:	Well I wonder if she's got a hearing problem, she'd never says she has.But you think come on!I mean  (        ) ! ((lorry noise))
*WEN:	I mean she had the door, the front door open!At that
*SAN:	I'm surprised she couldn't even hear!
*WEN:	Oh!
*SAN:	I mean we have double glazing.The idea if you've got double glazing
*WEN:	So have I!
*SAN:	And yes, I can hear at my front door next door but one   (        ) the window.If somebody goes up their path and she barks you can hear it!
*WEN:	Well, I said to Mick, he's just got up now.Oh, I said to him look   (.) I said she obviously a person that takes no notice  (        ) , but she lives out in the country.Because she's in there!When it goes on inside, she's in there!
*SAN:	I'm su sure she can't hear it.
*WEN:	She said I can't 
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	hear it when I'm out here.So I said, well that's it!I know he don't this Sandra   (.) and I don't care a sod!Bloody had a gutful of her!I mean, for a start I don't think she should have four dogs shout out   (.) in there all the hours that they are!And er   (.) I'm not saying they're ill treated   (.) cos they're probably not, but there's different ways of ill treating isn't there?
*SAN:	I mean they don't look scruffy 
*WEN:	Certainly!
*SAN:	you get fed but that's about it!And they're in the warm you can't say they're
*WEN:	No.
*SAN:	they're not  (        ) .
*WEN:	Well I haven't seen her.I saw her that one night look   (.) take one of those little ones   (.) going up the road   (.) but I've, I mean   (.)  (        ) .All these people there this weekend and I've not seen one dog go out!And I mean you don't just stand at your window   (.) but   (.) at some time or other
*SAN:	Well she's probably sharing a room   [laughing] with the dogs  [] !
*WEN:	Well they must be!
*SAN:	It's like living in a dog's kennel!
*WEN:	It's only a three bedroomed bloody semi after all!
*SAN:	Well like living in a dog's 
*WEN:	Yeah!
*SAN:	kennel!
*WEN:	Yep!So I said to him, right   (.) I said we either   (.) go   (.) I mean I keep saying to him you've gotta do something about this!Either this plaster board holes or whatever the house   (.) well the trouble is it costs   (        ) such a lot of money
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	you know, and we are, we have got that insulating lot.Oh it's   (.) she's cantankerous!She's   (.) whatever you say   (.) don't wanna know!Well I was bloody livid!I was really livid!
*SAN:	Who's the other side   (.) of her?
*WEN:	Well th the bloke   (.) but I mean he's not attached.But he's out.He's out
*SAN:	I was gonna say the people on the other si I know 
*WEN:	No!
*SAN:	they're not joined, so the other side never

*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	and there's the one that linked right round.I mean that was   (.) they   (.) dimmed the lights so that they're not all erm   (.) silvery grey   (.) at one stage.I mean, it was a job to say which one 
*SAN:	I was gonna say,i it's that one.
*WEN:	Yeah, that's the one that went over 
*SAN:	And then   (        ) 
*WEN:	that was the fair.But erm   (.) but the whole the point about this show was   (.) three partners had stopped near the door   (.) the whole ice was covered with people who   (.) and er   (.) apart from the juggler an and you know   (.) bits 
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	like that, but   (.) but that isn't the woman.That isn't the woman.It was a blonde haired woman.
*SAN:	Oh!
*WEN:	But obviously she was the star when they  (        ) .But the actual   (.) main star     (.)  (        )  (.) is this one.He was  (        ) . (.) Lovely when they  (        ) !You know, the production?
*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	I'm sure they did do it well. (.) All that time   (.) must of had a ball! (        ) I thought that was    (        )  (.) so this is  (        ) , we had a bad night's sleep!I would have said while I was putting out my washing cos I did it last night on purpose for the gas man coming in.They're all asleep next door!
*SAN:	Yeah, they don't have to get up!
*WEN:	No!No!Anyway, (        ) and I have one for Connie, that's the little girl over  (        ) .
*DOR:	Oh right!
*WEN:	Yeah.Was one, there's two now.And   (        ) so she's on medicine.Erm   (.) I know, like you do these   (.) and er   (.) I mean I, I've heard about Alan and Sue for a long time, I know they're having a lot of bother, you know with the   (.) decorating and all that.But she's got in there, well I hope Alan and Sue can settle now.Apparently, a lot of the trouble they had was her father!He says   (        ) him to go to work and look after the kid.Well they got two kids now but the , it was then, you know?And er   (.) Alan apparently wants to go to Spain   (.) and Alan said well I'm not bloody working there, as he said, I don't wanna earn money like that!And course, they had, (        )  (.)  (        ) with us you know   (.) at one time   (.) and now they've got that   (        ) holiday again now, so I mean none of them would of been cheap   (.) when they did it.
*DOR:	No.
*WEN:	And er   (.) I didn't realise that   (.) you know, the father had   (.)  (        ) . (        )  (.) said about it.
*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	I didn't bloody know, I   (.) worked it out.Well he knows he can er, start off
*DOR:	Without any hassle.
*SAN:	Oh!
*WEN:	Oh! (        ) Doreen?
*DOR:	Oh!Oh!I haven't.
*WEN:	Beautiful it was!Really was!Well but we go  (        ) .
*DOR:	Oh lovely!
*WEN:	Fifteen   (.) fifteen quid seats we had.Two.
*SAN:	Oh!
*WEN:	And we had a nice coach this time.
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Oh!Somebody called Freeway Which is a lot of
*SAN:	Kingston.
*WEN:	Oh yeah, Kingston, yeah.It was Kingston.
*DOR:	And you didn't look out the    (        )  (        ) 
*WEN:	No.And it was a beautiful warm   (.) comfortable.Last time we went up,la last year was when erm      (.)  (        )  (.)  (        ) no heating like.
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	And it was an old coach.I mean, alright the heating didn't go wrong   (.) but it wasn't that, the coach itself was   (.) you know, really rattled!Rattled all the time!
*SAN:	Yeah some are quite  (        ) .They've got a, I think they've one   (        ) ones.
*WEN:	We had one   (.) good one when we went to Bournemouth.
*SAN:	They've got a double decker they use for the school run and that is absolutely on it's last legs by the look of it!
*WEN:	Yeah, we had a double decker one time when we went to Bournemouth but I can't remember who it was.But that wasn't   (.) old.Cos that was when Helen and   (.) Tommy  's erm   (.) wife left their clothes on there thinking it was staying there but it never, it came back.It was on another run, we got another coach   (.) come back   (.) so they had to go out to where the one it was to
*SAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	pick up their clothes!But I tell you what though that erm   (.) ice rink place   (.) it wasn't half full!They fill them up!Masses and masses amounts of people!But that is, if you go up under your own steam I mean even dearer than the way we did it.
*SAN:	Mind you it's getting to the end of the run as well isn't it now?
*WEN:	Then it's
*SAN:	London.
*WEN:	Yeah.
*DOR:	Mm.
*WEN:	Then it's London.
*SAN:	Er   (.) you know   (.) most of those it's sort of pre-Christmas and round Christmas.
*WEN:	That's right.You know, like the pantos innit?Yeah, we certainly found it was a  (        ) .But er, it was very good!
*SAN:	Yeah, years ago my granddad   (        ) remember, he used to take me to a   (.) pantomime something 
*WEN:	Yeah.
*SAN:	like that.
*DOR:	Well I suppose it's just 
*WEN:	We used to go with   (        ) 
*DOR:	 (        ) go into the Brownies and   (.) I used to go Windsor every year actually with my two.
*WEN:	Yeah.

*SAN:	Perhaps her manager or something.
*WEN:	whoever was in 
*SAN:	She had her sister 
*WEN:	there, it was good!
*SAN:	the other sister as well.
*WEN:	That was   (.) skating all around, you know   (.) it turned.And the eyes went up and down and then they were going up and down.
*SAN:	Mm!
*DOR:	Really  (        ) !
*WEN:	Almost, you know   (.) and   (.) they said they were better  (        ) , we were right looking at the stage over this time.Last time we were over here and when it came down it   (.) ever such a big thing!And they just go down like   (        ) 
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	Yeah!

*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	 (        ) she's got  (        ) , but I liked those. (        ) . And of course, being so   (        ) in the back seat they sort of when they, they she 
*SAN:	Mm.
*WEN:	landed they, they   (        ) 
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	they don't 
*SAN:	Yeah.
*WEN:	as though they, as though they just going off  (        ) !

*WEN:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	I used to do rollering a bit.
*SAN:	though my kids both ice skating.
*WEN:	They came down, they were altogether like that but at one point those red ones came down the ice altogether.You weren't allowed to take photographs.I took the camera, but I never used it.
*DOR:	Mm.
*WEN:	But people were popping off again like last year.And he specifically said this bloke   (.) none 
*DOR:	Well   (        ) 
*WEN:	allowed   (        ) 
*DOR:	No she didn't!
*WEN:	Don't take any notice if they don't want.
*SAN:	It just said no photographs inside and yet 
*WEN:	 (        )  (        ) .But it was, really was 
*DOR:	It's one of   (        ) things things on television   (.) about it, you know, I mean   (        ) 
*WEN:	Yeah, what the video?
*DOR:	you see them   (.) things going and you wonder 
*WEN:	Ya, but yeah.
*DOR:	if they're told not to or whether they're allowed to.

*DOR:	They make the bloody things with roller skates like that.
*SAN:	Yeah.
*DOR:	If it was me I'd go straight 
*SAN:	Yeah.
*DOR:	over.Jason's obviously   (        ) down when they've, you know well   (.)  (        ) .
*SAN:	 ((cough)) 
*DOR:	A bit more.

*WEN:	That's much better.I mean th the Around the World in Eighty Days was good.
*DOR:	Mm.
*WEN:	But this was more    (.)  (        ) 
*SAN:	 ((cough)) 
*WEN:	somewhere   (.) it says about the am amounts that was spent on the costumes.Must of been   (.) loads   (.) and they're opening, there's a new   (.) new stadium 
*DOR:	Yes.
*SAN:	Yeah, in Switzerland. (        ) .

*DOR:	Yeah. (        ) 
*SAN:	Erm, Switzerland.
*DOR:	Mm.
*WEN:	But somewhere it says about the amount it cost, but I mean if must be   (        ) like that.Must be bad!I mean, even one's like this.
*DOR:	Yeah.
*WEN:	You know?But he was magnificent!Tremendous that one! (        ) . But it was, it was very good!But it shows the difference between last year and this year.When we went up to th , we had coffee and Mick had a   (.) bottle of beer   (.) erm, before we went in and   (.) and last year, well you wouldn't of go , dreamed of getting a seat in that   (.) restaurant area,yo you wouldn't!Now, this year we   (        ) 
*SAN:	 ((cough)) 
*WEN:	and there was a spare table.

*WEN:	Yes.
*SAN:	You didn't go earlier last year?
*WEN:	Well I don't think so.I'd have to ask Mick but   (.) I don't think so.
*SAN:	I mean generally they   (.) you know, I, that's one of the things people cut back though isn't it? (        ) 
*WEN:	Oh certainly!
*DOR:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Certainly, because erm   (.) I say it's   (.) you know, it's sort of an extra innit? something   (        ) innit?
*SAN:	Yeah.
