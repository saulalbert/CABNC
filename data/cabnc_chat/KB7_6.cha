*ANN:	How would you like that? •203305_205285•
        Order's not completed you've got to stay till it is. •207605_210045•
*STU:	Up yours mate. •213245_214135•
        I'm going home. •215755_217485•
        Ten o'clock and that's it. •217485_221415•
        Or whatever. •221415_223505•
*ANN:	Not many would. •223535_225165•
        Very rare. •225215_225495•
*STU:	Not often. •225495_225975•
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*STU:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*ANN:	Oh my god! •226725_227295•
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	I had that yesterday. •227295_232955•
        What's our post code? •232955_236575•
*STU:	P E fourteen seven P G.  •238155_263375•
*ANN:	They was looking for it on a list. •263375_265845•
*STU:	Mm. •266005_266065•
*ANN:	Said I know it's P fourteen, I don't know the rest of it. •266065_268935•
        And he looked on a list he had and he put seven something. •268935_282805•
*STU:	Seven P G. •289965_290535•
        I can always remember it. •292115_293065•
*ANN:	Well you're good at remembering numbers. •293535_295115•
*STU:	Well yeah but I just think P E fourteen, half of fourteen is seven and then T. •295285_301735•
        G. •303985_304045•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Yes darling. •304285_304675•
*STU:	So that's how I remember it. •306095_308835•
        Funny innit? •310085_311515•
*ANN:	Yes very strange but you are strange. •311515_314835•
*STU:	I know yes. •314835_315115•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Very strange, yeah, very strange. •315345_317025•
*ANN:	You always remember numbers. •318795_321735•
        Don't you? •322835_323165•
        Car numbers and telephone numbers and •323355_325305•
*STU:	Car numbers I remember more by the letters than the numbers. •325535_328275•
        Because there are specific set numbers. •329465_331145•
        Once I see  •335315_335615•
*ANN:	When they come round at work and says  this car blocked in I say oh go and ask Stuart he'll probably know. •335675_341245•
        Give you a blooming it's a blue something or other and this is the number. •343335_347335•
        Go and ask . •347495_348115•
        I said go and Stuart or Bill they, they know most of them. •349535_354545•
        I wouldn't know one from another. •358165_359485•
*STU:	associated the letters with the car and the letters with the car go together. •360715_364465•
        And then the numbers, the numbers I don't remember that well. •364465_369075•
        Some of them I do. •369075_370025•
        now with them changing the  the changeover cos they always used to be  the letters followed by the numbers. •374035_380555•
        Now they've got  the initial letter  followed by the number then the letters. •380555_384955•
        Rather than so  As I say you associate the car and the number together. •390705_393445•
*ANN:	I don't. •393445_393595•
*STU:	It would probably throw me completely If you   •394375_398935•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	it would throw me completely if you put, if you changed some of the number plates over. •399045_402885•
        If you put Tina's number plate  on another car  and visa versa  that would throw, I I'd probably look at it and think  you know, oh somebody's got a new car or that looks familiar but it's not the right car so I wouldn't think about it. •404185_426485•
        Even though I know Tina's is C two one one Y C L  if it was on a different car  I'd probably look at it  and think •426705_434545•
*ANN:	Oh that's not right. •434545_436725•
*STU:	it's not right, it's not Tina's. •436725_437865•
        And so I wouldn't think that that  I  probably  Just a  just a trait of personality. •437865_448645•
*ANN:	I wonder how she is if she's  at work or at home. •448645_452305•
*STU:	Don't really   don't really care to tell you the truth in a way but  •452595_461025•
*ANN:	Oh that's nice. •461205_462125•
*STU:	Well no I care  I care if Tina's not well and hope she gets better soon but  I don't care if   •464565_470955•
*ANN:	You don't care about work getting in a muddle  •470985_472625•
*STU:	I don't care about work and them being in a muddle, no not at all. •472865_476205•
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (        ) 
*STU:	Let them get on with it. •477635_480295•
*ANN:	That's not very nice. •481285_482385•
*STU:	It is. •483385_483775•
*ANN:	No it isn't. •484115_484605•
*STU:	Well it is. •484605_487655•
        Why isn't it? •488155_488845•
*ANN:	Cos it isn't. •491485_492265•
*STU:	Well •496135_496445•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	if  a lot of others were off we'd have to cope somehow wouldn't we? •497685_501235•
        So  there you go. •503535_508265•
        Just cos we're off. •509275_509965•
        And possibly Tina and that is off so  they'll just have to struggle on as if we were there and  a lot of others were off. •512925_522655•
        Don't you agree? •526955_527455•
*ANN:	Yes darling. •528365_534745•
*STU:	Right. •540985_541365•
        So what's on the agenda for today? •541365_542575•
*ANN:	Well you know very well. •542575_545235•
        We are going shopping. •545235_546105•
*STU:	Where are we going shopping? •546105_547055•
*ANN:	Whenever you're ready to take me shopping. •547605_549105•
*STU:	But where  are we going shopping? •549395_550475•
*ANN:	Well  probably Wisbech. •551575_552235•
        No point in going to Lynn if we're going to mum's. •552275_554455•
*STU:	No but where? •554915_555525•
*ANN:	Wherever you wish to take me. •557255_558115•
*STU:	Where would Ann want to go? •559005_560795•
*ANN:	I don't mind. •563875_564395•
        Haven't got a lot of choice. •564395_565435•
        I don't like Tescos at Wisbech cos it's . •565455_566635•
*STU:	Right. •566885_567025•
*ANN:	So it's Gateway Gateway or blooming Rainbow. •567025_570415•
        Suppose we could go down the Rainbow and have a look at that microwave. •574535_577715•
        But I'll have to go into town first. •577715_582375•
        Cos I don't think they'll give me the shopping for nothing and there's no bank down Rainbow. •582375_587705•
        Well there is, a Co-op bank but I don't think they'll let me have some money out of it. •587705_593675•
*STU:	Mm. •593675_593755•
        Maybe not. •593755_594115•
*ANN:	And seeing as I haven't got an account with them I don't think they'll say well you can  have some anyway. •594215_599235•
*STU:	No. •599235_599595•
*ANN:	No. •601665_601755•
*STU:	And then we're going into town? •602385_605845•
        Well we've got to go into town  •605845_607195•
*ANN:	Got to see the estate agents and see if we can  view something today. •607195_610535•
*STU:	Mm  •610855_611485•
*ANN:	other ones that we are  definitely interested in and underneath the ones that we are  not so interested in. •611755_620945•
*STU:	Yeah  there's one down, that one down Elizabeth Terrace. •620945_624165•
        I was just trying to figure out which one it is. •624415_625895•
        Hundred and twenty. •626185_629435•
*ANN:	I don't know if that isn't  erm what they call it who died not long ago? •629455_637265•
        Hazel's mum's. •637505_639975•
        Cos perhaps the dad's moved out or you know . •640965_644465•
        Quite close to her. •644465_645995•
        Oh what was her name? •645995_652685•
        Old Hazel's mother. •652685_655515•
*STU:	Hazel's mother. •655515_657855•
*ANN:	The little old lady who went to Salvation Army, always wearing a little hat. •658255_662585•
        Oh what was her name? •662585_663405•
        Cos you know her as well. •664315_664945•
        And I said oh my god she's died and you said  oh I know her. •665195_668125•
*STU:	What used to go to the Salvation Army? •668125_677375•
*ANN:	She was  to Salvation Army. •677375_679265•
        Ever so small little lady. •681235_682125•
        or something. •682125_688067•
        I can remember her kids and I can't remember her name. •688067_690627•
        Terrible. •690627_690717•
        Hazel and Terry, mother-in-law's brother Terry  fire officer at Wisbech, it's his mother-in-law  laws. •695517_701257•
        And she died not more than a few months ago. •701257_704787•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh it's awful. •705817_708597•
        It's dreadful I mean  quite fond of her. •708597_713497•
*STU:	Just trying to think which one it was anyway . •713497_719087•
*ANN:	I think it's her house. •719087_719867•
*STU:	Yeah but I'm trying think which one it is. •719867_721337•
        Cos I say I know that  I know Elizabeth Terrace well. •721337_725457•
*ANN:	Yeah I know cos I think you called on her cos you knew her. •725457_728487•
        When she died you said  oh I know her well . •728487_731577•
*STU:	Hundred and twenty. •731577_731697•
        Let's go and have a look. •732877_736947•
        Oh it's in here somewhere innit? •736957_752827•
*ANN:	I put a ring round it so I know  •754947_760207•
*STU:	Oh yeah here we are, hundred and twenty. •760207_766697•
        Ah the one  one in from the end. •766697_768417•
        Yeah, I know the one now. •768417_771077•
        One in from the end. •783047_788477•
*ANN:	I think that is her house. •788807_789987•
        Mind she had a husband but  should think he  living with one of the kids. •793207_805957•
*STU:	Can't think who lived there now. •808087_810707•
        God, cos I used to call on that one. •810717_814217•
        perhaps. •814247_814367•
        The only trouble down Elizabeth Terrace  parking. •814367_822207•
*ANN:	 (        )  (.) 
*STU:	That's the only trouble. •822467_823517•
        The only consolation  if •823897_825167•
*ANN:	the college. •825167_829527•
*STU:	if that was a possibility  or if that became a possibility  mum only live round the corner. •831077_839117•
        Not that far away is she? •839537_840767•
        Few hundred yards. •840767_842587•
*ANN:	She drives. •842887_843117•
*STU:	And I could leave the car in her driveway. •843177_847747•
*ANN:	Then there's the college. •847747_848917•
        Lot of people park in the college. •852007_854547•
        Don't they? •854597_857567•
*STU:	So that is a I was just wondering which one it was cos I say I know  some of them are a bit you know •857567_864327•
*ANN:	Yeah. •864417_864477•
*STU:	a bit dodgy. •867127_867187•
        I knew there there they had a lot of trouble with one of them but  nearer Helen's end. •867187_871847•
        There was one there that was empty and  for a long long while. •873197_877117•
        The builders started building, knocking it about •877117_879427•
*ANN:	And it fell to bits. •879427_881227•
*STU:	And then it •881227_882377•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	and then, no the  ran out of money. •882377_884337•
        The builder ran out of money  and the  it was just a shell. •884337_887807•
        You know, nothing in it. •887807_889587•
        No windows no doors no nothing er you know, completely gutted it  to make it all, to renovate it and then ran out of money and then it just stood there completely empty. •890787_901997•
        And can you imagine a house in the open air in winter? •901997_909777•
*ANN:	Do it a lot of good would it? •909777_912327•
*STU:	It wouldn't do it a lot of good, no exactly. •912327_913677•
*ANN:	Woodwork and •913677_913927•
*STU:	exactly. •913927_914027•
*ANN:	and even the brickwork. •914027_915547•
*STU:	No. •916987_917237•
*ANN:	damp and  If you get me back to mum's for about three o'clock time at the latest to take her to Osborne House. •917367_926077•
*STU:	Well that's what she's that's what she's  she's, she just sort of she didn't mean it but •926077_931207•
*ANN:	No it  •931207_931367•
*STU:	it was her thought that we were •931367_933657•
*ANN:	Yeah cos I mean you'd probably run her back, rather than her biking. •933657_935577•
        As I say I mean we, if we could make an appointment say three fifteen or three thirty to see Sefton Avenue. •935577_946777•
        Cos we'd be up there anyway. •946907_953407•
*STU:	Yeah. •953417_953427•
*ANN:	Wouldn't we? •953427_953867•
        Before it gets dark and you couldn't see anything anyway. •953867_961247•
*STU:	Oh we'd have to go and have a look in the light. •961247_963537•
*ANN:	Well that's it. •963537_963777•
*STU:	Definitely. •963777_963867•
*ANN:	cos you can't see a lot. •963867_966487•
        Cos there won't be electricity on. •966817_969067•
        Anyway you wanna have a good look round  seriously consider it. •969067_973057•
        Cos I think now we  haven't heard from Mr  and I think that means  he's not prepared to take it so he's not bothered about coming. •973057_987380•
        Yeah? •987390_987400•
        Is that the  way you're reading it? •987400_994280•
*STU:	That's the way I'm reading it. •994960_996320•
        I'm  •996320_996560•
*ANN:	Ignore it cos the man might  just leave him in there renting it until or when forever it goes up. •996570_100247•
        But we can't afford it to go up. •100247_100521•
*STU:	I'm disappointed that he's not been back  •100521_100819•
*ANN:	Yeah I am. •100819_100843•
*STU:	to discuss it. •100848_100942•
*ANN:	Yeah I am. •100942_100995•
*STU:	And to put the position to him. •100995_101229•
        Look the market's not very good I know but  we're sitting tenants. •101229_101538•
        We're quite happy to take it on. •101576_101919•
        We'd like to take it on. •101919_102164•
        If we leave have you got another tenant to come in? •102164_102546•
        You're gonna lose two hundred and fifty pound a month. •102546_102772•
        And a good two hundred and fifty pound a month. •102772_103057•
*ANN:	Exactly. •103057_103063•
*STU:	You know, not one that he has any hassle in getting. •103063_103316•
*ANN:	That's it. •103316_103376•
        He don't have to keep calling and wandering around after us. •103376_103570•
        But I'm not prepared to go on renting it. •103570_104223•
*STU:	No no. •104223_104238•
*ANN:	As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off  a place of our own is is just  I mean if  I have to rent it well I'll have to rent one. •104238_105478•
        If we can't get anything else and we can't afford anything else we've just got to go on paying it but •105479_105915•
*STU:	But •105915_105922•
*ANN:	when there's so much other  •105922_106174•
*STU:	as I say you look at  I mean this is two fifty. •106174_106430•
        You look here in the paper and see how much they are. •106430_106743•
*ANN:	Yeah I know. •106775_106812•
        Some of them are terrible. •106812_106916•
*STU:	You're talking two sixty, two eighty. •106916_107108•
*ANN:	I know. •107108_107159•
        Three hundred. •107159_107226•
*STU:	To let. •107226_107250•
        Three seventy. •107250_107283•

*STU:	Yeah but I mean the times I've seen her it's been this end of town rather than that end of town. •120228_120921•
        Which has made, which which just makes me think  •120921_121200•
*ANN:	I don't really, I just presume she lives down Victoria Road somewhere but I don't really know. •121200_121460•
*STU:	And she walks to work. •121460_121519•

*ANN:	She could be. •122256_122301•
        But that weren't a bedsitter that I was in . •122307_122688•

*STU:	No  but yeah •122741_122816•
*ANN:	but it was a kitchen and bedroom and living room. •122828_123301•
        They're only tiny like an alcove bedroom but •123310_123480•
*STU:	Oh yeah I've been in one of them. •123480_123766•
        You know I've seen them. •123766_123815•
*ANN:	I mean it was the only one with a  with its own kitchen. •123867_124250•
        The one that I was gonna have. •124250_124567•
*STU:	Yeah. •124567_124593•
*ANN:	This was right up the top and there were  a tiny attic bedroom thing was made into a  not very salubrious but it had a cooker and a sink. •124601_125478•
*STU:	Yeah. •125478_125484•
*ANN:	And as I say that was fifty or something a week and it wasn't  wasn't worth it really. •125484_126658•
*STU:	No. •126658_126697•
*ANN:	Furniture wasn't that posh but then er but the only thing I thought about it was safe and it was clean. •126698_127636•
        Needed a bit of personalizing but it was  it was old-fashioned furniture but it was polished. •127653_128370•
        It was clean. •128392_128475•
        Had a reasonable carpet on the floor and, and so on. •128475_128722•
*STU:	Mm. •128915_128951•
*ANN:	But it wasn't worth fifty pound a week. •128951_129458•
        Definitely not. •129458_129493•
*STU:	But that's what they're going for though isn't it? •129494_130639•
        If they can get them for that   •130806_130886•
*ANN:	people do . •130886_130902•
        People are desperate to buy and they'll have whatever and they have to pay. •130902_131229•
*STU:	Yeah. •131230_131231•
*ANN:	When you think that one   what was thirty three thousand two hundred and sixty a month or something wasn't it? •131231_132233•
        Well that's gonna be about two hundred and forty, two hundred and fifty a month for that one down . •132233_132738•
        Cos thirty three worked out two sixty didn't it? •132738_133303•
*STU:	Oh the mortgage you mean? •133325_133442•
*ANN:	Mortgage. •133467_133478•
        So you can say two hundred and fifty pound a month to buy a place. •133479_133868•
*STU:	Oh yeah. •133876_133935•
*ANN:	And yet they want two eighty to rent one. •133935_134334•
        Seems quite ridiculous. •134334_134379•
*STU:	Well that's if you're prepared to  buy a flat. •134379_135097•
        That's the only thing isn't it? •135097_135297•
        If you're prepared to buy a flat. •135297_135580•
*ANN:	Yeah but at least you've got, actually got the property haven't you? •135580_136028•
        You're not just paying somebody else to have a  Cos if you're moving if you can't sell it you can always rent it again. •136028_137029•
        Which is what a lot of people are doing   houses especially. •137038_137519•
        They buy a house cos they've had a child or something. •137519_138128•
        They can't afford to  they can't sell that one so they rent that out which pays the mortgage for it and start again on another mortgage. •138128_138749•
*STU:	You've got to be a bit careful when you're renting out though. •138749_139055•
*ANN:	Oh yes. •139055_139104•
        Got to be careful of your tenants. •139104_139273•
        pay. •139275_139284•
*STU:	Tenants. •139296_139306•
*ANN:	That's why it's best to go through an agency or er something like White and Eddies because they have people that collect them and they have people who have to take up references and  •139323_140188•
*STU:	Yeah but not only that but I mean if you  •140194_140604•
*ANN:	And they have they have proper leases. •140604_140701•
        I mean after that they're out and  •140701_140854•
*STU:	Yeah . •140854_140857•
        well I mean all, all well it counts towards your income as well. •140857_141097•
*ANN:	Oh yeah I know. •141130_141220•
        Oh yeah income tax on it. •141220_141434•
*STU:	Counts counts towards your income. •141434_141869•
*ANN:	But a lot of people are doing it. •141869_142038•
*STU:	Mm. •142201_142212•
        Oh I know. •142212_142256•
        Well there's  for one. •142256_142555•
        sell   •142555_142558•
*ANN:	Lot of people are doing it because they just can't  well circumstances. •142558_142943•
        It's either the job or something means they've gotta go away or  they can't afford, they can't sell them so they   I don't know if that would make your income different if you were still paying a mortgage . •142943_144462•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Even though your, all the money  •144551_144611•
*STU:	Think   •144611_144630•
*ANN:	you were getting in was getting paid out again? •144637_144973•
*STU:	I think you'll find it counts towards your income. •144973_145232•
        So I mean if you had a job  •145232_145375•
*ANN:	Paying them more tax. •145497_145534•
*STU:	You, you got a job say you're earning  •145534_146187•
*ANN:	But I think the expenses when you're  •146187_146283•
*STU:	earning ten thousand a year. •146283_146411•
        And you're going, you're getting two hundred and fifty pound a month  as well in rent •146436_146900•
*ANN:	Yeah but you, you'd be able to claim expenses. •146900_147310•
*STU:	I think so, yeah. •147310_147362•
*ANN:	You wouldn't pay the whole of it taxable if it was  you know you would claim expenses for one thing and another. •147362_147879•
*STU:	Oh I don't know but I mean I wouldn't have thought so. •147897_148063•
        Yeah. •148063_148066•
*ANN:	Otherwise  probably that's why they are dear because they have to do things like that. •148066_148596•
*STU:	That's probably why they're the price they are, two eighty. •148596_149092•
*ANN:	That's it. •149092_149119•
*STU:	Because people take   •149119_149189•
*ANN:	Pay fifty and thirty quid a week more is a bloody what they get stopped off them. •149189_149592•
*STU:	and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina. •149592_149776•
        And to pay off the mortgage they've got to charge so much   •149776_150269•
*ANN:	I mean Tina's got that little house . •150277_150413•
        I mean now you'd get it two hundred and , I mean Tina pays two hundred and forty eight er pound a week, a month. •150416_150936•
        Three hundred and forty eight pound a month mortgage on that little house. •150955_151342•
*STU:	Yeah. •151342_151370•
*ANN:	I mean that was bloody thirty nine thousand, or was it forty one when she had it. •151370_152104•
        It was  •152104_152121•
*STU:	I know. •152129_152185•
*ANN:	forty one I think. •152185_152239•
        I mean now they're going for thirty two. •152239_152458•
        We can afford one like that. •152458_152523•
*STU:	Yeah we could  isn't it? •152529_152747•
*ANN:	Mm. •152747_152775•
        They don't sell now. •152775_152964•
        Not selling at all. •152965_152986•
        There's a few renting now cos they can't sell them. •153294_153803•
        So  It's a nice enough little house but  I'm not awfully keen on it are you? •153803_154762•
*STU:	I don't like the, I don't like the bedroom •154763_155327•
*ANN:	No I don't  •155327_155381•

*ANN:	That's it. •157712_157857•
        That's why Tina doesn't like people smoking in her house because it gets into her bedroom. •157857_158117•
*STU:	Yes. •158117_158132•
        Exactly. •158132_158161•
        The smoke would just rise straight up and •158164_158392•
*ANN:	Yeah. •158429_158435•
*STU:	straight up into the bedroom. •158435_158540•
