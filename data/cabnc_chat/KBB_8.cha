        Luckily, Taffy returning from his annual holiday remembered that there was a complete Tacker in the factory of a local manufacturer  still being operated. •208563_209530•
        The directors of the firm kindly gave B U permission to borrow a Tacker for the exhibition and after Leicester branch arranged a temporary replacement, Taffy began working, cleaning up the machine to showroom condition. •209599_210982•
        Taffy spent five days cleaning, polishing, painting  he copied the motives which were missing from and old nineteen hundred and eight B U machinery catalogue  which he examined with a watchmaker's glass. •211116_212479•
