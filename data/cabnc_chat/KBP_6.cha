@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 026507)
*CLA:	Oh yes I noticed   (        ) yeah.Well   (        ) 
*NIN:	The only thing I   (        ) only I don't know all the names of some of the people.
*CLA:	Oh I wouldn't know any of them. (.) 
*NIN:	But   (.) apart from that it's not a very difficult one.
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Let's have a look what's what.
*CLA:	Is it based on the contents of   (.) of rather the erm 
*NIN:	Yes.It is.
*CLA:	people on the box?
*NIN:	It is.
*CLA:	Oh crikey, [laughing] I w definitely wouldn't know  [] .
*NIN:	Pardon?
*CLA:	I definitely wouldn't know, no. (        ) 
*NIN:	Oh you would.
*CLA:	up my nose it's erm   (.) quite erm 
*NIN:	I know.I went in there and I thought something was burning.Don't let me forget there's a cake in the oven will you?
*CLA:	Not a bun but a cake.Right. (.)  (        ) 
*NIN:	You know what I'm like.I forgot it completely last week.
*CLA:	Well what time   (.) do I remind you?
*NIN:	Remind me at half past   (.) half past if I don't remember myself.
*CLA:	Half past six?
*NIN:	Yes.
*CLA:	Yeah.Well it's quarter past six now.
*NIN:	I know what it is now but 
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	I'm quite capable of forgetting in about five minutes.
*CLA:	Mm. [laughing] Well it wouldn't take me that long   (        )  [] .
*NIN:	Oh dear. ((laugh))  (.) 
*CLA:	Quite a bit more   (        ) today anyway.
*NIN:	Oh well yes.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	It's a hard slog   [laughing] isn't it  [] ?I wish we'd got a bit further really but it's hard work.
*CLA:	There's a lot of work.But we, we're getting there slowly.Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Let's have a look and see what's what.
*CLA:	 (        ) you see the doors are different, quarter inch difference in size.
*NIN:	You wouldn't, I wouldn't have thought that. (        ) the same.
*CLA:	No it didn't surprise me cos they usually   (.) no, they put the casing up, the door casing.
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	And then the chippie erm   (.) cuts the door to fit. (        ) it, you know?Very seldom you get it a perfect fit when you
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	just   (        ) it in. (.) Fortunately it is the right way round.
*NIN:	Mm.I don't think they, I would have thought that everything was more or less
*CLA:	Well it is more or less.
*NIN:	spot on 
*CLA:	No.No.
*NIN:	size.When the houses were built at the same time and 
*CLA:	They possibly are today.Erm   (.) a lot of stuff's factory er
*NIN:	Is that the sort of job that er Ken would be doing?
*CLA:	On the building site, yeah.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	Mm.Yeah.
*NIN:	Mm. (.) Did you hear Josie was saying about er
*CLA:	What?
*NIN:	 (        ) ?He's busy on this building project now but he doesn't know after.
*CLA:	Oh she said a few days ago about   (        ) some bungalow or something he's   (.) he's helping to build.He, he's a brickie isn't he?Yes that's right.
*NIN:	Yes.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	Whereabouts?
*CLA:	I haven't the faintest idea.
*NIN:	Oh.
*CLA:	Not the faintest. (.) 
*NIN:	So it   (.) they, he'll be worried if   (.) oh mind you er   (.) anything in the building trade is a bit iffy isn't it?I can't see Ken 
*CLA:	 (        ) yeah.
*NIN:	getting a a job really, can you?Certainly not now. (        ) 
*CLA:	I'd have thought he's going to find it extremely difficult down here to find a job.
*NIN:	Because I don't   (        ) 
*CLA:	Of any sort.Never mind just in the building trade.
*NIN:	Yes, I don't think he'll rush down  (        ) .But he's so used to being  (        ) .
*CLA:	Well he's got all his mates  (        ) .And he er I don't think he's got the confidence to  (        ) .
*NIN:	No.I don't.
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	And then again he's getting older, I mean   (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	it's more difficult as you get older  (        ) .
*CLA:	See I did see there's that place erm   (.) erm   (.) oh it's going, it's   (.) Tearscross direction. (.) Erm 
*NIN:	Erm 
*CLA:	they advert 
*NIN:	 (        ) ?
*CLA:	Well, they advertise in the paper every week. (.) Advertise   (        ) carpenters and joiners.But   (        ) 
*NIN:	The thing is er where he is now
*CLA:	Mhm.
*NIN:	er when, mind you he's been in his job for a while now.
*CLA:	Mm.Mm.
*NIN:	But I mean   (.) when the jobs have finished   (.) he's always 
*CLA:	Well he 
*NIN:	managed to get on to another one pretty well straight away.
*CLA:	See hang on no no no.The job's been never finished   (.) never will be finished   (.) with the corporation on it.It's amazing  (        ) . [laughing] Specially there  [] .
*NIN:	No but I mean, I don't mean wh I don't mean where he's been working for the corporation, I mean   (.) before when he's had these various jobs and they've finished and he's had, you know, the job's finished and they've had to go somewhere.
*CLA:	Oh the shopfitting and mm mm mm.Mhm.Mhm.
*NIN:	He's always been   (.) quick at picking another job up   (        ) 
*CLA:	Oh to be fair to him, yes he has.He's been very quick at that.
*NIN:	But as you get older that's not so easy is it?
*CLA:	No, precisely.No.No.
*NIN:	And he might not find it so easy here.Cos there's so many more people in pretty much the same trade. (.) 
*CLA:	I would have thought so.Yes.I would have thought so.
*NIN:	Mm.And it just isn't commonsense to commute 
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	to Manchester is it?
*CLA:	Oh he'd never do it.It's ridiculous.
*NIN:	Mind you, the only thing that I was thinking of, do you know when he was commuting  (.) 
*CLA:	Ah.
*NIN:	that firm he was working for
*CLA:	Yeah, can't
*NIN:	to Sw was it Swansea?
*CLA:	It probably was Swansea area.I think it was, yeah.
*NIN:	Yes it was Swansea area.
*CLA:	Go on.
*NIN:	He seemed to like that, although he did get fed up with it  (        ) .
*CLA:	Ah yes but it was quite a different run you see Nina.That was motorway nearly all the way.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	And he could do it in   (.) less time.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	It was a straight run.There was no driving involved.You just point the car in the right direction   (.) press the   (        ) pedal and you're there  (        ) . (        ) 
*NIN:	It was still a long way.
*CLA:	It's a longish way but erm   (.) for Ken it's not quite the same as erm   (.) the A roads and B roads and 
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	oh no.
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	Cos he doesn't really like driving.
*NIN:	No he doesn't.
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	And it is a bit of a tedious journey.
*CLA:	He'd never do Mike's job.Well   ((laugh)) he'd never do Mike's job anyway but 
*NIN:	Oh no.
*CLA:	you know, the driving side  (        ) .
*NIN:	No but Mike enjoys it doesn't he?
*CLA:	Mm. (.) 
*NIN:	He covers a a rattling   (.) big area.
*CLA:	He's got a big area to cover, Mike   (.) if you think about it. (        ) 
*NIN:	He seems to enjoy the job doesn't he?
*CLA:	Seems to yes.Mark you he wouldn't crack on if he didn't.No he wouldn't say very much about  (        ) .
*NIN:	Well   (.) no I don't suppose so.
*CLA:	No.No. (.) 
*NIN:	But goi reading between the lines, you can usually have a a rough working idea   (        ) 
*CLA:	Oh yes he obviously likes it better than when he was at er at that erm what do they call themselves? (.)  (        ) 
*NIN:	Oh I can't remember now.Erm oh well you see 
*CLA:	Mm.Oh a hi fi firm.
*NIN:	he doesn't l like being tied to the bench does he?
*CLA:	Oh no.He'd sooner be out.
*NIN:	And I think I think he does his job well anyway.
*CLA:	I'm quite sure he does his job extremely well, yeah.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	So all is well.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	It, it's a sha I feel sorry for young married couples these days.
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	It's very hard going isn't it?
*CLA:	Oh yes.Mm.Oh yes. (.) Well 
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Go on.
*NIN:	Mm.I was gonna say something, I've forgotten. ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	As is my wont.
*CLA:	Well you usually mm. (.) 
*NIN:	Mm but I can't see, I don't think Carolyn would have much difficulty. (.) 
*CLA:	Er no I d particularly   (.) in view of her experience
*NIN:	Cos   (.) yeah
*CLA:	I don't think she would.
*NIN:	Exactly.
*CLA:	Quite as much anyway.
*NIN:	No I don't.
*CLA:	She might have to wait a wee while but I think she'll get on, yes.
*NIN:	I think so.
*CLA:	And possibilities for Carolyn
*NIN:	Yes.
*CLA:	came now.I don't   (.) we may be completely wrong.But as far as this exchange business is concerned.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	You'd never get erm   (.) you'd never get an exchange.
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	I don't think we operate that scheme now.
*NIN:	Larry have you got any books out from the library?
*CLA:	No.
*NIN:	That needs taking back?
*CLA:	No, no.
*NIN:	I was just looking at that, going right off the subject but er that Uri Geller?I bet that's interesting?
*CLA:	It's er moderately interesting so far, yes.
*NIN:	Yes.I wouldn't mind reading that.
*CLA:	No I thought you might.That's one, another reason I got it out from the library.Erm it rabbits on quite a lot up to now.
*NIN:	Yeah.
*CLA:	About all the er astonishment, amazement   (.) the English press and public and the Swedish press and the public and the American press and public, you know?Push push push all the time.
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	Erm
*NIN:	 (        )  ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Yes well of course you can only assume that what he says is correct.He's quoting various   (.) er authorities on the subject  (        ) .I've only just started the damn thing really.
*NIN:	How did he er y  (.) how did he first find out that he w he had this    (.)  (        ) 
*CLA:	Well he that's why he wanders on a bit.Erm keeps giving little bits   (.) erm   (.) It was when he was a child apparently, he claims to have been aware of it, you know?Mm.
*NIN:	A ch as a child?
*CLA:	Mm.
*NIN:	How young?How old?
*CLA:	Oh that I don't know. (        ) 
*NIN:	Oh it doesn't give any particular age?
*CLA:	Mm. (.) He admits to wanting to be a showman, you know?
*NIN:	Mm.
*CLA:	A film star and god knows what.
*NIN:	Oh well   (        )  ((laugh)) .Loads of children do that don't they?

*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	I can't think of any   (.) TV quizzes or panel games or  (.) 
*NIN:	Well that er that's not. (        ) 
*CLA:	You don't think it is?
*NIN:	I don't think so, no.
