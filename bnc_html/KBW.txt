Tim (PS088)                          [81] Why will the fish go into the jug?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [82] Be careful because they don't want to
                                     be in a thunder storm.
                                     [83] ... Hello fish.

                                     water?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [98] Well what do you think would happen
                                     to the poor things if left them in that
                                     water?
Christopher (PS089)                  [99] I don't know.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [100] Do you know that fish can't breathe
                                     unless they're in water?
                                     [101] ... So if they're out of the water
                                     they die just like if we're under the
                                     water ... too long we die.
                                     [102] ... Right, I think we should stop
                                     now and get them out of there.
                                     [103] Stop Tim.

Tim (PS088)                          [187] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [188] It needs to go in the oven really.
                                     ...
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [189] Pardon?

                                     [194] Really tatty.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [195] What?
                                     [196] Oh you mean the stones.
                                     [197] Yeah.
                                     [198] It's quite ... it's quite erm
Tim (PS088)                          [199] Are the fish tatty?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [200] It's a long time, no no no, it's a
                                     long time we since we er cleaned them.
                                     [201] It's just dirty really rather than

                                     [202] Whoops. ...

Dorothy (PS087)                      [204] Pardon?
Christopher (PS089)                  [205] Tim's throwing water at me.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [206] Tim, what are you doing?
                                     [207] ... Can you come in here Tim so I

                                     [211] ... What are you doing?
                                     [212] You're not throwing water are you?
Tim (PS088)                          [213] No.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [214] No we'll all get wet if you do.
                                     [215] Cos we're not, we don't want a bath.
                                     ...
Tim (PS088)                          [216] Why [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)                      [217] Why what?
Tim (PS088)                          [218] Why do you need to wash the [...] ?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [219] Cos they're ... cos they're messy.
                                     [220] Look you can see it's all brown.
                                     [221] Ugh.
                                     [222] ... If we just wipe round the
                                     outside of the tank though, I think that
                                     will help.
                                     [223] ... Cos it's gone all funny inside,
                                     can you see? ...
Tim (PS088)                          [224] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [225] Whoops.
                                     [226] ... Ugh look at that.
Christopher (PS089)                  [227] Ugh. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [228] I think it's the kind of food we're
                                     using cos it's different food from the ...
                                     food that we had at the beginning.
                                     [229] It didn't seem to get as bad as this
                                     at the beginning.
Christopher (PS089)                  [230] Why didn't it seem to get as bad as
                                     this?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [231] I don't know.
                                     [232] It just did n't. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [233] Is it because mummy
Dorothy (PS087)                      [234] Pardon?
Christopher (PS089)                  [235] Is it because we've given them a
                                     different ... have we already used a pot
                                     up?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [236] Yes we used the little pot and then
                                     we bought that box.
Tim (PS088)                          [237] Mummy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [238] Hello.
Christopher (PS089)                  [239] Where's the little pot mummy?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [240] What's your problem?
                                     [241] ... You alright?
Tim (PS088)                          [242] I wanted to put water in there.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [243] You want to put water in?
                                     [244] Well we'll just give them one more
                                     swish.
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [245] Little pot mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [246] What little pot?
                                     [247] The fish food you mean?
                                     [248] ... Well the thing was, because we
                                     bought a box and the box ... was a bit
                                     flimsy, I thought we would put the new
                                     fish food into the old pot, you see.
                                     [249] So the old pot has still got some in
                                     ... but it's really the new food.
                                     [250] Do you see? ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [251] Why didn't you keep it in the box?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [252] There's still some food in there as
                                     well.
                                     [253] ... Right, okay.
                                     [254] If you want to put your jug of water
                                     in now, this is your moment.
                                     [255] Do you want to get a jug ... full.
                                     [256] Do you want to get some from the
                                     tap?
Christopher (PS089)                  [257] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [258] You can if you want to.
                                     [259] ... Because it'll probably need more
                                     than what's in the bucket anyway.
                                     [260] Tim, do you want to carry this?
Tim (PS088)                          [261] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [262] Do you want to carry this?
Tim (PS088)                          [263] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [264] This tank.
Tim (PS088)                          [265] Want to [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [266] Can you manage?
                                     [267] Don't drop it will you?
                                     [268] Shall I hold the cup.
                                     [269] Don't drop it whatever you do.
Christopher (PS089)                  [270] Mum, do you want it up to
Dorothy (PS087)                      [271] Fill it up to the number one there
                                     look.
                                     [272] That means one pint.
Christopher (PS089)                  [273] Mum could you
Dorothy (PS087)                      [274] What?
Christopher (PS089)                  [275] turn it on.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [276] Okay. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [277] I've done it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [278] There we are.
                                     [279] Put the dinner in.
                                     [280] Ooh.
                                     [281] Oh well done.
                                     [282] Right, away you go, see if you can
                                     get it in the
Tim (PS088)                          [283] Can I have the cup now? ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [284] Oh Tim don't make hole will you?
Tim (PS088)                          [285] No.
Christopher (PS089)                  [286] Right do it like this. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [287] Oops.
Christopher (PS089)                  [288] Tim's made a hole.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [289] I think you're doing it a bit
                                     roughly Tim.
                                     [290] Can you do it more gently so the
                                     stones don't move. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [291] Don't just pour it in one place.
                                     [292] You're making another hole.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [293] Put, tip it on to the bridge and
                                     then you won't make a hole cos the bridge
                                     will be in the way.
                                     [294] ... Oop!
                                     [295] What a dilly.
                                     [296] [laugh] ... Ah no.
                                     [297] If you're gonna do it like that
                                     we're gonna have to stop you from doing
                                     it.
                                     [298] ... Come on.
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [299] Mind the fish.
                                     [300] ... Poor things.
                                     [301] ... That's better Tim.
                                     [302] Oh no!
                                     [303] Disaster.
                                     [304] Move the video quick.
                                     [305] ... Make sure it's dried.
Christopher (PS089)                  [306] It is dried.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [307] Oh!
                                     [308] Now just watch it with those fish
                                     please ... while I get a cloth. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [309] The bridge is under water.
                                     [310] ... The bridge is under water now,
                                     what will you do?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [311] Yeah.
                                     [312] So is our room look. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [313] No it's not under water.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [314] It's a good job it's just water and
                                     not orange squash.
Tim (PS088)                          [315] Oh!
                                     [316] I caught a fish.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [317] A fish went in.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [318] [laughing] Oh Christopher be careful
                                     []
Dorothy (PS087)                      [319] That was quite clever really.
Tim (PS088)                          [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [320] As long as you didn't hurt him.
                                     [321] There you go mister fish you can go
                                     for a swim now.
                                     [322] Now look we've got a fish in there
                                     and a fish in there Tim so we must be
                                     careful now because otherwise we're gonna
                                     hurt them.
Christopher (PS089)                  [323] No there's only one in there.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [324] I think I'd better fish that one out
                                     do you?
Christopher (PS089)                  [325] Yeah.
                                     [326] ... There's already one in there Tim
                                     now.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [327] Yeah.
                                     [328] So when you pour the water don't go
                                     tipping it
Christopher (PS089)                  [329] There's already one in there.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [330] on top of him cos he'll get a shock.
                                     [331] Let's have this weed out.
Christopher (PS089)                  [332] [...] one in there already.
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [333] You gonna help the weed?
                                     [334] ... Whoops.
                                     [335] Alright.
Tim (PS088)                          [336] I can't take all of it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [337] Woo er ... alright wait a minute now
                                     cos mummy's gonna fish this fish out.
Tim (PS088)                          [338] Er Mum, how do you think I caught
                                     it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [339] Oh look at all the bits in there.
                                     [340] I don't know how you caught it love.
                                     [341] It was rather clever really.
Tim (PS088)                          [342] Yeah because when you catch
Dorothy (PS087)                      [343] You've just got to be careful
                                     because
Tim (PS088)                          [344] fish then
Dorothy (PS087)                      [345] if you're not careful you'll hurt
                                     them you see because if you ... touch
                                     their tails or their fins or something.
                                     [346] There we are.
                                     [347] Right now when you're tipping it in
                                     now I should use a cup now Christopher cos
                                     the jug will be too much water for them.
                                     [348] ... Alright?
                                     [349] Now just gently now.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [351] Well watch where you're pouring Tim.
                                     [352] Not on top of the fish please. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [353] [...] use that but it's got dirty
                                     now.
                                     [354] I'm gonna use that bit.
                                     [355] [...] . I'm gonna pour it over
                                     there.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [356] Go on then.
Christopher (PS089)                  [357] But that isn't in the way of the
                                     bridge.
                                     [358] Oh Tim.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [359] Whoops.

                                     car.
                                     [361] Unless it's a visitor.
                                     [362] What do you think?
                                     [363] Got a white one look. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [364] Will that be enough water yet?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [365] Er ... bit more I think.
                                     [366] ... Gently does it.
                                     [367] That was a good one Tim, well done.
                                     ...
Tim (PS088)                          [368] Oh no. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [369] See if you can tip it without the
                                     bits going in then.
                                     [370] Whoop ... whoop.
Tim (PS088)                          [371] I did.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [372] What?
Tim (PS088)                          [373] I did put a bit in.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [374] Oh well.
                                     [375] Never mind.
                                     [376] It will come out next week. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [377] What happens if you put a bit in
                                     mum?
                                     [378] ... The fish might think it's food?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [379] Well er I think those bits that are
                                     in there are really just bits of weed.
                                     [380] I don't think it's anything too
                                     awful.
                                     [381] What's this thing?
                                     [382] ... Ooh.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [399] I think we must stop before we get
                                     right to the top.

                                     [460] Are they dry, your hands?
Christopher (PS089)                  [461] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [462] Yeah?
                                     [463] Go on then.
                                     [464] ... No not too much. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [465] Anyway I can't get too much really.
                                     ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [466] You watch underneath Tim, see if
                                     they come up to the top. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [467] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [468] Are they coming? ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [469] Is that enough?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [470] I should think so.
Christopher (PS089)                  [471] Tiny bit more.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [472] Go on then.
                                     [473] Just a little spot. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [474] That's lovely.
Tim (PS088)                          [475] Is that going to come up? ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [476] They come up?
                                     [477] No. [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh] ...
Tim (PS088)                          [478] They did.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [479] Well they're probably a bit shocked
                                     now cos they've got clean water. [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [480] And their bridge is in the same
                                     place.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [481] Not quite.
Christopher (PS089)                  [482] Yeah their bridge was there, yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [483] Was it?
                                     [484] Oh it doesn't matter. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [485] Oh!
Dorothy (PS087)                      [486] Good.
                                     [487] That's that done.
Tim (PS088)                          [488] There's a er I just saw one eating
                                     food.
Christopher (PS089)                  [489] Yes it's gone up.
                                     [490] Is that eating the food or eating
                                     the weed?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [491] [laugh] I don't know.
                                     [492] I'm never sure if they eat this weed
                                     cos it doesn't look as if it's going
                                     anywhere. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [493] Mum, can we watch [...] ?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [494] Can you watch what?

Christopher (PS089)                  [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [497] Pardon?
Christopher (PS089)                  [498] I haven't watched before.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [499] There isn't anything new, no.
                                     [500] I haven't got round to videoing
                                     today cos I was out teaching this
                                     afternoon.
Christopher (PS089)                  [501] What about the [...] , the morning?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [502] Er ... I was out at Tesco's this
                                     morning.
                                     [503] In fact I went to wave goodbye to
                                     grandma.
                                     [504] I took her to the train.
                                     [505] You'll never guess, when we got to
                                     the train station
Christopher (PS089)                  [506] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [507] when we got to the train station,
                                     guess what erm ... grandma had to catch?
Christopher (PS089)                  [508] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [509] A bus. [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [510] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [511] Because the trains weren't running.
                                     [512] They're erm electrifying the line.
                                     [513] You know they're putting up the
                                     electric ... lines
Christopher (PS089)                  [514] Mm.

                                     [516] ... Well, they've got to have a bus
                                     to get to Barnet Green I think.
Christopher (PS089)                  [517] Is that nearly finished?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [518] Er ... no.
                                     [519] I think it's nineteen ninety three
                                     before it opens.
                                     [520] It's nineteen ninety two

Christopher (PS089)                  [530] No it's not very very long.

                                     [543] [...] the microphone.
                                     [544] You just pulled it down, it's
                                     supposed to sit on there.
Tim (PS088)                          [545] Mum.
Christopher (PS089)                  [546] Why have you have you got it on?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [547] Well a man came earlier on today and
                                     he said please would we record
                                     conversations that we have all the time.
                                     [548] So you don't have to touch it, you
                                     just have to talk to me and just leave it
                                     sitting there.
                                     [549] It doesn't matter.
Christopher (PS089)                  [550] Why do you [...] ?
Tim (PS088)                          [551] Mummy.

Tim (PS088)                          [553] Mummy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [554] Mm.

                                     jumper?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [557] It just picks up your voice.
                                     [558] You know like in church?
Christopher (PS089)                  [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [559] You know when we go to church and
                                     you have a microphone on, and it makes
                                     your voice go round all the church?
                                     [560] ... Well it's a bit like that but
                                     instead of making it go round all the
                                     church it goes on to the tape.
Christopher (PS089)                  [561] This?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [562] So it records.
                                     [563] Yes.
                                     [564] There's there's a tape in my pocket
                                     look.
Christopher (PS089)                  [565] Where?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [566] In there.
Christopher (PS089)                  [567] Why do you have to ... let's have a
                                     look at it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [568] We'll have a look at it later on.
                                     [569] Oh very, very tuneful Tim.
Christopher (PS089)                  [570] Why do you have to have it ... Why
                                     do you have to have it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [571] Because ... there are some people
                                     that want to ... listen to what we say in
                                     our house, and what we say to each other.
                                     [572] And then they can think about
                                     language and how people use language. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [573] [playing instrument] That's a funny
                                     sound.
Christopher (PS089)                  [574] What about in France?
                                     [575] Well if you can [...] in Fr
Dorothy (PS087)                      [576] In France?
                                     [577] ... No, it won't pick up our voices
                                     in France.
                                     [578] But in France if they did the same
                                     thing they would be talking in French down
                                     their machine.
                                     [579] Hello.
                                     [580] ... Ooh, what a lovely tune.
Tim (PS088)                          [581] That's a funny one.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [582] Mm.
Tim (PS088)                          [583] [playing instrument] That's a funny
                                     one.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [584] It is a funny one.
                                     [585] Now it's five o'clock.
                                     [586] What time do you think daddy is
                                     going to get home today?
                                     [587] Shall we guess? ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [588] Sixty one.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [589] Sixty one.
Christopher (PS089)                  [590] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [591] That will be a funny time.
Christopher (PS089)                  [592] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [593] There's no such time as sixty one.
Christopher (PS089)                  [594] Sixty one minutes.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [595] In sixty one minutes?
                                     [596] That will be another hour and one
                                     minute, which will make it one minute past

                                     yesterday so he might not be.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [609] I'll tell you what, when I was in

                                     and there, hanging in a classroom, was a
                                     skeleton made out of cardboard.
                                     [610] And all the children had made all
                                     the different bones and it was all hanging
                                     together.
                                     [611] It looked really funny.
                                     [612] ... Hello.

                                     [723] He probably was k feeling kind
                                     because he thought he was giving you a

                                     you know, and Ian found a stick and then
                                     he thought Tim would like one. ...

                                     pricked?

Christopher (PS089)                  [748] No, he didn't prick himself.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [749] Who?

Dorothy (PS087)                      [753] Well I expect he just handed it to
                                     Tim and Tim picked it up thinking it was
                                     smooth.
                                     [754] Turned out ... turned out to be

                                     the right ... he put it on the floor and
                                     Ian pricked him.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [758] Oh, could be.
                                     [759] Don't know.

                                     tasted the bread.

Christopher (PS089)                  [1192] I only don't want any carrots.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1193] Oh alright then.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1202] [laugh] It's hardly worth it.
Tim (PS088)                          [1203] Oh.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1212] Well I'm sorry.
                                     [1213] It's a bit difficult to get the
                                     tomato out cos it's all chopped in with
                                     the mince you see.
Christopher (PS089)                  [1214] I'll have the tomato. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1215] I'm sorry it's not cordon bleu dear

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1235] Well, we're not supposed to do
                                     exercises after we've just had our tea so

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1249] Mm.

Andrew (PS08A)                       [1253] Oh well it was just this er meal we
                                     went out to in the evening.
                                     [1254] [...] bar ... hotel restaurant

                                     they can't afford a tablecloth or
                                     whatever.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [1256] Mum.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1257] What's supposed to be so attractive

                                     means [...] a cafe

Andrew (PS08A)                       [1262] without er tablecloths.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1263] It's like that place with that cow
                                     pie.
                                     [1264] I thought that was the most boring
                                     meal I [...] .
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1265] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1266] Trying to be totally different and

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1270] Did it take a long time?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1271] Yeah cos we ordered when it was
                                     [...] .
                                     [1272] About an hour later it arrived but
                                     we were standing at the bar when we had er
                                     ... ordered it.
                                     [1273] But that was, we were standing
                                     there for about an hour I should think it
                                     was.
                                     [1274] And eventually they told us to go
                                     upstairs and sit down at the table.
                                     [1275] So we did and eventually [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1276] [laugh] Was it any good?
                                     [1277] When it came?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1278] It was quite nice actually.
                                     [1279] Yes it was.
                                     [1280] Yes it was very tasty.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1282] And this wasn't the hotel or
                                     anything.
                                     [1283] Well obviously it was a restaurant.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1284] This wasn't the hotel, the hotel
                                     was very posh yes.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1285] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1286] Presumably felt they couldn't
                                     afford [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1287] Couldn't afford a hotel meal.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1406] Well it's all called tea really.
                                     [1407] You have a first course and a
                                     second course and ... could call it all
                                     ... I don't know what you call it really,
                                     I never do know what to call it all.
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [1408] Toast, just toast instead of

Andrew (PS08A)                       [1409] No.
                                     [1410] It's a bit like that, the same with
                                     porridge isn't it?
                                     [1411] It's called that but ... eating
                                     breakfast.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1412] [laugh] That's confusing.
                                     [1413] ... Right.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1414] Right.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1415] We'll sit down and eat soon.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1416] Yes. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1417] Ah.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1418] Well what did you get up to this
                                     morning [...] in your ... few minutes of
                                     freedom?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1419] Or was it very hectic [...] ?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1420] Well it was a bit hectic cos of
                                     having this phone call to say I've got to
                                     teach in the afternoon.
                                     [1421] I thought I'd better do all my jobs
                                     which I thought was going to be spread
                                     across the d the day.
                                     [1422] So I went to Tesco's first thing
                                     straight back from the nursery and guess
                                     what I forgot to do?
                                     [1423] Take me list with me
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1424] Take your money.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1425] No I'd got me money, but not the
                                     list.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1426] So you did it from memory?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1427] Mm.
                                     [1428] And anything might happen. [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [1429] Feel sick. ... [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1430] I checked it off when I got back
                                     and it's not too bad.
                                     [1431] Forgot about three or four things
                                     [...] .
Tim (PS088)                          [1432] What's that?
                                     [1433] What's that?
Christopher (PS089)                  [1434] The juice.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1435] The juice. ...

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1437] And then, after I'd gone round to
                                     Tesco's I went to see ... to collect
                                     grandma to take her to the train.
                                     [1438] Which wasn't a train, it was a bus.
                                     ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1439] [...] Was that alright?
                                     [1440] [...] . She got on the bus alright?

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1444] Mm.
                                     [1445] She's going to Manchester.
Tim (PS088)                          [1446] Oh.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1447] To see ... Irene.
                                     [1448] Do you remember Irene?
Tim (PS088)                          [1449] [...] Sunday.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1450] Mm.
                                     [1451] She'll still be in Manchester.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1452] Yeah, we won't see her on Sunday.

                                     [1455] It'll be funny won't it?
Christopher (PS089)                  [1456] Was she mea ... were we meant to go
                                     to her house?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1457] Yes, we were.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [1458] So next time we have to stay at her
                                     house again?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1459] [laughing] I don't know [] .
Christopher (PS089)                  [1460] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1461] We haven't really decided that but
                                     yes, I suppose we could.
Tim (PS088)                          [1462] Yeah [...] grandma's house.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1463] You think we'll go to grandma's
                                     house?
Tim (PS088)                          [1464] Because we miss it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1465] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1466] Mm.
                                     [1467] Did miss it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1468] We'll see what she says when she
                                     comes back.
                                     [1469] Anyway, arrived at the station and
                                     there was this great coach standing there
                                     waiting to take them all to [...] .
                                     [1470] It was blocking the whole of the
                                     car park.
                                     [1471] ... So this car that was trying to
                                     ... get out was sitting there waiting and
                                     there was no driver in sight and people
                                     were rushing about all over the station
                                     trying to ... [laughing] find the driver
                                     [] .
                                     [1472] Anyway it didn't worry us cos we
                                     were behind the coach.
                                     [1473] But I did feel sorry for the man
                                     who was trying to get out cos ... he must
                                     have been in there for ages.
                                     [1474] ... I suppose they thought that
                                     there wouldn't be anybody trying to get
                                     out cos the train
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1475] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1476] wasn't due out.
                                     [1477] ... So I just left her getting on
                                     the bus.
                                     [1478] I didn't sort of wait till the bus
                                     had gone or anything.
                                     [1479] ... I finally managed to get a ...
                                     a card for the wedding ... in Tesco's.
                                     [1480] ... You know, I sent them a card,
                                     Mark and Trish.

                                     wedding when she goes away?
                                     [1486] That's why she's gone away. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [1487] Why do you have to go away?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [1488] Well that's where the wedding is.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1492] Beg your pardon?
Christopher (PS089)                  [1493] When you get to the station to

                                     [1502] Except she didn't get a train to
                                     Birmingham, she got a bus.
                                     [1503] Well, she got a bus to Barn Green
                                     And a train at Barn Green to Birmingham.
                                     [1504] ... Christopher knew earlier on

                                     the electrification was finished.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [1506] Did you, I mean, discuss this
                                     before?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [1507] No.

                                     your duvet up at night times it means that

                           vase ... on the side.
Christopher (PS089)        [2433] Where's one blown over?
Dorothy (PS087)            [2434] There look. ...
Christopher (PS089)        [2435] A new one?
Dorothy (PS087)            [2436] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2437] Mm.
                           [2438] It's so windy at the moment.
                           [2439] March winds.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2440] The others seem to have stood up quite well
                           over on the other side.
Tim (PS088)                [2441] Where?
                           [2442] Where?
Christopher (PS089)        [2443] One of them's dead.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2444] Which one's dead?
Christopher (PS089)        [2445] The one which is f ... pointed erm straight
                           ahead.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2446] Mm.
                           [2447] See what you mean.
Christopher (PS089)        [2448] It's a bit dead.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2449] It is.
                           [2450] Looks as if it ... and the wind's got it
                           again. ...
Christopher (PS089)        [2451] Mum, it's not very nice when the wind hits it
                           is it mum?
Dorothy (PS087)            [2452] No.
                           [2453] Still, we can always pick them and bring them
                           inside. ...
Christopher (PS089)        [2454] I remember doing that once.
                           [2455] I remember

Dorothy (PS087)            [2457] Mm.
Christopher (PS089)        [2458] So where is it now?
Dorothy (PS087)            [2459] It will be dead by now.
                           [2460] You're talking about last year aren't you?
                           [2461] ... Last year's flowers aren't around now.
                           ...
Tim (PS088)                [2462] Here you are.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2463] Right.
                           [2464] Thank you.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2465] These are the same bulbs though that have
                           made a new flower this year.
Tim (PS088)                [2466] Where's the marmalade?
                           [2467] I took a bit.
Christopher (PS089)        [2468] Why they keep on making new bulbs?
Dorothy (PS087)            [2469] They do it, well ... they do it every year.
Christopher (PS089)        [2470] Can I have some marmalade please?
Tim (PS088)                [2471] Ah. ...
Dorothy (PS087)            [2472] The daffodils over there in that little bed
                           ... seem to be a bit later than all the others, I
                           don't know.
Tim (PS088)                [2473] Have some marmalade.
                           [2474] Have some marmalade.
Christopher (PS089)        [2475] I'm doing it a funny way this time.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2476] I'd of thought they would have got just as
                           much sun ... and rain as everything else. ...
Tim (PS088)                [2477] That's a little one. ... [...]

Dorothy (PS087)            [2488] Oh good.

Christopher (PS089)        [2494] Daddy hasn't seen the new Rosie and Jim.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2495] True.

                           Wednesday.

                           show.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2507] I haven't seen one about a puppet show.
                           [2508] Is that where
Dorothy (PS087)            [2509] Mm.

Andrew (PS08A)             [2514] Stratford?

Tim (PS088)                [2517] And a and a lion [...] . ...
Christopher (PS089)        [2518] He took an omelette.

Andrew (PS08A)             [2520] An omelette? ...
Dorothy (PS087)            [2521] It was quite good actually.

Dorothy (PS087)            [2525] Pardon?
Christopher (PS089)        [2526] Skinlid.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2527] The skin?
Christopher (PS089)        [2528] Well he's called Skinlid.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2529] Is he?
                           [2530] I don't know.
                           [2531] I didn't watch it that ... closely.

Tim (PS088)                [2533] [...] ate it all up.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2534] Mhm.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2535] So if it's a puppet show did Rosie and Jim do
                           some puppeting? [...] puppet.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2536] No.
                           [2537] They were in the audience shouting and
                           cheering from what I saw.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2538] Where they?
Christopher (PS089)        [2539] Mhm.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2540] Then they went round the back though didn't
                           they?
                           [2541] Did they [...] ?
Christopher (PS089)        [2542] Mm.
                           [2543] They run round the back and played with the
                           ... puppets.
Dorothy (PS087)            [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)        [2544] When the show was ended
Dorothy (PS087)            [2545] Nobody mentioned that they were puppets
                           themselves. [laugh]
Andrew (PS08A)             [2546] That's what I call a miracle. ...
Tim (PS088)                [2547] [...] I do that.
                           [2548] ... I don't think they like it.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2549] Mm.
                           [2550] It was nice to see Stratford.
                           [2551] I wonder if that ... they filmed that at the
                           time when the boat was in Stratford.
                           [2552] Do you remember when we went to
Christopher (PS089)        [2553] Yeah.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2554] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2555] we nearly went to see it but we missed.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2556] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2557] Cos it had moved by the time we got there.
Christopher (PS089)        [2558] So it might be then they might have taped it?
Dorothy (PS087)            [2559] Mm.
                           [2560] It could well have been.
Christopher (PS089)        [2561] But mum it's a bit late from that.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2562] Well it's always takes a long time.
                           [2563] They ... they do these things ... months
                           beforehand.
                           [2564] And then it comes on the television ... later
                           on.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2565] How to get to know about these things.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2566] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2567] This chap we were sitting next to involved in
                           all these canal projects [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)            [2568] Oh yes, that's right.
                           [2569] He was.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2570] Apparently he's a director of various canal
                           preservation bodies and things.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2571] Oh.
                           [2572] ... He was certainly into canals in a big
                           way.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2573] Yeah.
                           [2574] Yeah he is. ...
Dorothy (PS087)            [2575] Mm.

Andrew (PS08A)             [2577] No, he's at Solihull .
Dorothy (PS087)            [2578] Oh Solihull.
                           [2579] ... What was he called?
Andrew (PS08A)             [2580] Jonathan.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2581] Jonathan.
                           [2582] ... He was a pleasant chap I thought.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2583] Oh yes.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2584] As these chaps go. [laugh] ...
Andrew (PS08A)             [2585] It was interesting discussing various chaps
                           ... after [...]

Dorothy (PS087)            [2595] [...] surprising.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2596] Like I had to give her some top priorities
                           yesterday ... as she wasn't going to be about.
                           [2597] Actually she did very well on one of those
                           [...] .
                           [2598] She did far better
Dorothy (PS087)            [2599] Did you tell her?
Andrew (PS08A)             [2600] Oh yes.
                           [2601] Yes.
                           [2602] Well I made sure my boss told her, that's
                           [...] .
                           [2603] Cos he was desperate for [...] cos he needed

Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [2604] It's going to be thinking about science.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2605] Dave's erm wife produced a baby last week
Dorothy (PS087)            [2606] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2607] so he's having a week off you know to change
                           nappies or whatever.
Christopher (PS089)        [2608] It might be or it might not. [...]
Dorothy (PS087)            [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)        [2609] Mum, is the video on?
                           [2610] I just, I only pressed hold ... nothing else.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2611] Well you're not to
Dorothy (PS087)            [2612] Well since someone else switched it off I
                           should think.
Christopher (PS089)        [2613] Why?
Andrew (PS08A)             [2614] I'm not quite sure what happens you see.
                           [2615] That's why
Christopher (PS089)        [2616] I just pressed but cos there's a little line.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2617] [...] hear the sound of the video.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2618] When?
Andrew (PS08A)             [2619] Well I can hear it now.
Dorothy (PS087)            [2620] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2621] Yeah I'm wondering whether it's playing to
                           itself, with the television off.
                           [2622] Do you think that's likely?
                           [2623] Or does it not do it?
Dorothy (PS087)            [2624] No, cos it's not got the aerial ... it would
                           do.
                           [2625] It would do.
Andrew (PS08A)             [2626] Would it?

                    [2993] A big tall one.
                    [2994] ... Let's try that shall we?
                    [2995] Shall we put a roof on?
Tim (PS088)         [2996] Yeah there's a roof on here.
Dorothy (PS087)     [2997] How do you do the roof?
                    [2998] That way do you think?
Tim (PS088)         [2999] [...] the roof.
                    [3000] [...] . Have to do without the roof.
                    [3001] Have to do that to the
Dorothy (PS087)     [3002] Then we'll make it come down now ... this side.
                    [3003] Are you doing some more whoops a daisy.
Tim (PS088)         [3004] Whoops.
Dorothy (PS087)     [3005] If you're going to make it go out that way ... then
                    you'll have to make it go out that way at the bottom
                    otherwise it won't fit ... when you try to put the other
                    wall up.
Tim (PS088)         [3006] Ooh.
Dorothy (PS087)     [3007] And the problem with that one is ... is it's not
                    sort of fitting the edge there.
Tim (PS088)         [3008] It is.
                    [3009] Look.
                    [3010] ... Need one of these.
Dorothy (PS087)     [3011] Then this comes down the side look.
Tim (PS088)         [3012] Need one of these.
Dorothy (PS087)     [3013] Oh no, that's not right.
                    [3014] Look at that ... it's got things sticking out.
                    [3015] ... Do you think you've got to have it down the edge
                    there, haven't you?
                    [3016] This time.
                    [3017] ... And how do we fix this on now?
Tim (PS088)         [3018] Look, I show you.
                    [3019] ... Er there
Dorothy (PS087)     [3020] And could we take this yellow one off ... we'll find
                    it fits in like a wall, like that look.
Tim (PS088)         [3021] Oh!
                    [3022] [...] That goes on.
Dorothy (PS087)     [3023] [...] try that .
                    [3024] That's good.
                    [3025] Oh.
                    [3026] Oops.
Tim (PS088)         [3027] Oh.
                    [3028] I'm gonna make it.
Dorothy (PS087)     [3029] There you are.
                    [3030] Now what are we gonna do with this yellow piece? ...

Tim (PS088)         [3031] I know ... [...]
Dorothy (PS087)     [3032] Wonder if we can put that on the bottom, can't we
                    ... somewhere?
Tim (PS088)         [3033] [...] that be the floor.
Dorothy (PS087)     [3034] Yeah.
                    [3035] This doesn't feel quite right here somehow.
                    [3036] It's all wobbly.
                    [3037] ... Shall we, just let's see if we can turn this
                    round so it makes it ...
Tim (PS088)         [3038] We need one of these. ...
Dorothy (PS087)     [3039] When Ellie did it it didn't seem to fall to pieces
                    like ours is Timothy.
Tim (PS088)         [3040] That's it. ...
Dorothy (PS087)     [...]
Tim (PS088)         [3041] We [...] the floor now.
                    [3042] ... Is it ready?
Dorothy (PS087)     [3043] Think the eggs probably are but I don't think the
                    whole lunch is yet.
                    [3044] Are you hungry?
Andrew (PS08A)      [3045] Is it possible to lay the table do you think, for
                    me?
Dorothy (PS087)     [3046] I think we might manage that.
Tim (PS088)         [3047] It's ready.
*** 7 (Tape 022201) ***
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3048] I don't mind burnt toast.
                                     [3049] ... Adds to the flavour.
                                     [3050] ... Mm.
                                     [3051] Me mum and dad seem to have had
                                     trouble with their toaster don't they?
                                     [3052] Judging by their letter.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3053] Did you see their toaster?
                                     [3054] What make
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3055] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3056] was it?
                                     [3057] I don't remember seeing it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3058] It was a new one. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3059] [...] they had it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3060] Where they had it?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3061] No, [laughing] why they had it [] .
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3062] [laughing] Why they had it [] .
                                     [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [3063] Mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3064] Well we had it in the evening.
                                     [3065] You know when I used to have my
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3066] Oh yes [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3067] toast and marmalade and
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3068] Was that nice? [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3069] But that was where the trouble was
                                     because it didn't toast properly.
                                     [3070] Because you turned it up to number
                                     five ... and it was pale.
                                     [3071] And turn it down to number one ...
                                     and it [...] .
Tim (PS088)                          [3072] [...] have any of that. [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3073] I haven't had either.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3074] Right.
                                     [3075] What do you want on yours?
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [3076] Erm
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3077] They're planning on taking it back
                                     so [...]
Group of unknown speakers (KBWPSUGP) [...]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3078] It's the cheese we've been having
                                     at work this week [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [3079] Mum, help.
Christopher (PS089)                  [...]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3080] It's called dutch.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3081] I've been having it?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3082] You've been having some of that,
                                     yeah.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3083] Mm it's nice.
                                     [3084] [...] have that bit dad.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3085] Yeah.
                                     [3086] The trouble is this has ... erm ...
                                     crusts, sort of rind on it, that's all.
                                     [3087] Do you want a piece? ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3088] It's called Edam.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3089] It's a bit different from [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3090] We don't usually have Edam do we?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3091] Did I have it with my Marmite?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3092] Yes, you've had it with your
                                     Marmite.
                                     [3093] That much?
                                     [3094] Is that alright?
Tim (PS088)                          [3095] I want a bit of it.
                                     [3096] ... With my bread.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3097] He's got cream cheese on there
                                     dear.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3098] Right. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [3099] I like it better with Marmite.
                                     [3100] ... Can I have Marmite and cheese
                                     please?

Tim (PS088)                          [3104] Fold it over.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [3105] You

Christopher (PS089)                  [3108] Oh!
Tim (PS088)                          [3109] I can't do it.
                                     [3110] ... Why is there not very much left
                                     in?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3111] Because I had it all when we had
                                     breakfast.
                                     [3112] ... Anyway, we've had it a lot
                                     haven't we?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [3113] We've had Marmite a lot.
                                     [3114] I had it ... for my dinner at
                                     school a lot actually.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3115] Mm.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [3118] Right, what's on the agenda for
                                     this afternoon then?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [3119] Dad, it's not all over.
Tim (PS088)                          [3120] What's that?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [3121] What's that?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [3122] Mum, what's that? ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3123] It looks like a sandwich going up
                                     and down to me.
Tim (PS088)                          [3124] No.
                                     [3125] ... It's a ... lid.
                                     [3126] ... It's a lid.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3127] Oh. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3128] What about you?
                                     [3129] ... A rest I suppose.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3130] I dunno really.
                                     [3131] My body feels inactive, but my mind
                                     feels ... fed up, [...] .
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3132] [...] ... [...] this week. [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [3133] Dad, I like the cheese better than
                                     the Marmite. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3134] That's why I like Saturday's and
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3135] Potter about. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3136] Do the garden or ... walking or
                                     whatever it is.
                                     [3137] ... Something very different. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [3138] Why did you toast [...] bread?
                                     [...] toast.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3139] No, there won't be any more now.
                                     ... [...] ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3140] And that dozen in our garden can't
                                     decide ... which way to face.
                                     [3141] ... Have you noticed?
                                     [3142] [laugh] ... Cos in the morning they
                                     get the sun from that direction, then they
                                     don't see the sun again for a bit and then
                                     it turns up suddenly from over there.
                                     [3143] They don't know whether to face
                                     over there or over there.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3144] Mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3145] Hello.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3146] What ... and then we had a lot of

Andrew (PS08A)                       [3192] If you peel one I'll peel the
                                     other.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [3218] Those satsumas we had or whatever
                                     they were ... clementines were ... they
                                     were quite nice for tea all this week.
                                     [3219] Have you had one?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3220] [...] very difficult to peel.
                                     [3221] One day I had them and they were
                                     full of pips.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3222] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3223] Did you have that problem?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3224] Oh no we've never had that problem.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3225] Mm.

Christopher (PS089)                  [3227] I've had that problem.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3228] With lots of pips in?
                                     [3229] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3230] Did you have one at school with
                                     lots of pips in?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3231] Mm.
                                     [3232] Sorry about that.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3233] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3234] You just couldn't tell from the
                                     outside.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3235] Beg your pardon.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3236] I had that problem once.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3237] I kept looking in mine when I ...
                                     when I had it once I thought ooh.
                                     [3238] And now I'm going to have a look in
                                     my orange before I eat it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3239] [laugh] Very wise.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3240] So I don't know whether this one
                                     will have pips in it, so be careful.
Tim (PS088)                          [3241] Daddy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3242] I would think the oranges will have
                                     pips in won't they?
                                     [3243] Usually do.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3244] Oh they usually do.
Tim (PS088)                          [3245] I think these have pips in.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3246] Mm.
                                     [3247] Orange pips are slightly bigger
                                     than satsuma pips so you can see them. ...

Christopher (PS089)                  [3248] Yeah but sat ... the satsuma pip
                                     was really big.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3249] They were quite big.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3250] Actually I got it in my mouth.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3251] Did you?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3252] [laugh] That's alright.
                                     [3253] You spit it out again did you?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3254] Yeah.
                                     [3255] ... Mum what's that hard thing?
Tim (PS088)                          [3256] [...] half.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3257] [...] everybody was eating ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3258] Do other people get satsumas at
                                     school?
Tim (PS088)                          [3259] [...] half please.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3260] No.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3261] Yeah.
                                     [3262] No?
                                     [3263] ... What do they have?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3264] Half.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3265] Sorry. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [3266] Dad ... give them into little bits.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3267] Just check there's no pips Tim.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3268] Yeah.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3269] And I'll check mine.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3270] You're checking yours are you?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3271] I'll check mine myself.
                                     [3272] ... All I do is look in the [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [3273] I think there's no pips in mine.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3274] Just as well innit?
                                     [3275] Seeing's you've eaten it.
                                     [3276] ... Whoops careful.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3277] Slow down a bit.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3278] Just go slowly Tim.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3279] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3280] Cos they're big slices, it's not
                                     like satsumas.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3281] Chew them properly.
Tim (PS088)                          [3282] [...] ... [...] Daddy.

Tim (PS088)                          [3288] I rescued you [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [3289] Mrs and Mrs and Mrs don't cut them
                                     properly.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3290] Don't they?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3291] If I had an orange mum
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3292] Mhm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3293] and they cut it all that [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3294] They leave the skin on?
                                     [3295] ... You don't have to eat the skin,
                                     surely?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3296] No, but all they do, they leave the
                                     orange in the skin.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3297] Oh I see, they don't peel it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3298] And you have to suck it out?
                                     [3299] Oh.
                                     [3300] ... That's probably cos it would
                                     take them too long to ... peel everybody's
                                     oranges wouldn't it?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3301] There's no skin on yours. ...

Dorothy (PS087)                      [3369] You definitely pay the penalty
                                     don't you, for leaving your children?
                                     [3370] [laugh] Cos other people say you
                                     don't do things your way.
                                     [3371] ... It must be a problem if people
                                     sort of leave their children in nurseries
                                     all the time cos ... it's nice for a short
                                     time but ... for a long long time ...
                                     they're just not yours are they any more?
                                     [3372] ... Yeah.
                                     [3373] ... It seems a pity but it's not
                                     for very long.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3374] He's been chucked out a lot
                                     recently hasn't he?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3375] He has yeah.
                                     [3376] That's why I'm feeling as if I
                                     ought to stay in tonight really.
                                     [3377] ... What do you think?
                                     [3378] ... Think I'm just chickening out?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3379] I think it's a bit of both.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3380] I am chickening out cos I don't
                                     feel as if I've ... learnt an awful lot.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3381] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3382] Well do you want to chicken out?
                                     [3383] ... Instead.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3384] I think I ought to go.

Andrew (PS08A)                       [3386] I ought to go.

                                     [3389] Just because you've said you'll go
                                     or because you think [...] ?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3390] I think [...]

                                     before.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3393] And do you think I ought to go
                                     then?
                                     [3394] ... Well I mean there might well be
                                     something
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3395] I don't mind.
                                     [3396] Well there might be.
                                     [3397] But I can understand
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3398] gripping and of interest but at the
                                     same time ... my priorities at this moment

Dorothy (PS087)                      [3401] It doesn't seem very fair.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3402] Fair on who?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3403] Him.

                                     [3407] I wondered what that was there.
                                     [3408] Must be the oranges do you think?

Andrew (PS08A)                       [3815] [...] I should imagine it's a new
                                     car.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3816] Very posh isn't it?
                                     [3817] Is it new?
                                     [3818] I mean

Tim (PS088)                          [3823] It won't mummy.
                                     [3824] I don't think it will.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [3825] If it doesn't mum ... anyway it
                                     wouldn't fit in the garage because there's
                                     another car in there.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3826] Oh that's a point.
                                     [3827] That's a bit tricky.
                                     [3828] Well we think that that might be a
                                     new car.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3829] Yeah, we think it's [...]

Dorothy (PS087)                      [3832] [laughing] We're not nearly there.
                                     [3833] We haven't even started [] . ...
Tim (PS088)                          [3834] Nearly there.
                                     [3835] ... Got to be quick.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3836] [...] did you actually go to sleep
                                     mummy?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3837] I did.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3838] Did you? [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3839] I was absolutely whacked out.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3840] You've done very well [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3841] Well I haven't.
                                     [3842] You've done all the meals. [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [3843] Dad, could you walk it to
                                     MacDonalds?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3844] Well you could.
                                     [3845] It would be a little bit far for
                                     us.
                                     [3846] But we could if we needed to.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3847] Wouldn't be too bad cos you'd go
                                     down by the Jolly Farmer.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3848] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3849] You'd have to walk like Gemma walks
                                     to school wouldn't you?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3850] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3851] Where does Gemma live?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3852] Gemma lives ... Oakenshaw
Christopher (PS089)                  [3853] Yeah, near MacDonalds.
                                     [3854] Near MacDonalds dad.
                                     [3855] She lives right near MacDonalds
                                     doesn't she?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3856] She does actually.
                                     [3857] [laugh] Wonder if she goes to
                                     MacDonalds every night for her tea?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3858] No.
                                     [3859] ... But she could walk it from her
                                     house couldn't she?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3860] She could. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [3861] Because it's not far.
                                     [3862] Yeah all she has to do is go ... go
                                     round her bit ... round just a normal
                                     road, across the road ... down a little
                                     bit ... and she's there.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3863] Mm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3864] It's not very far daddy, is it
                                     daddy?
                                     [3865] A teeny [...] bit.
                                     [3866] It's only round the corner ... from
                                     her isn't it mum?
                                     [3867] ... It's only [...] . [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [3868] [cough] I found it ... over here.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3869] I can't see it.
                                     [3870] There it is.
Tim (PS088)                          [3871] There it is.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3872] There's a lot of people there.
                                     [3873] Do you think we'll get a seat?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3874] Ooh there's a lot of cars.
Tim (PS088)                          [3875] I see MacDonalds.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3876] There's not normally that many
                                     people there are there?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3877] No.
                                     [3878] It's
Christopher (PS089)                  [3879] What?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3880] it's a bit full.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3881] Oh it looks crowded.
                                     [3882] Perhaps there's a party. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [3883] It's not a party. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [3884] Perhaps there's only one person in
                                     each car at MacDonalds.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3885] [laugh] That's true.
                                     [3886] I can't think that one person in a
                                     car on their own would want to go to
                                     MacDonalds too often. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [3887] Like a mum or a dad or [...] ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3888] Everybody must have thought what a
                                     dismal day this is.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3889] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3890] Let's got to MacDonalds for our
                                     tea.
                                     [3891] ... Mm it is quite full though.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3892] How do you know which way
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3893] It is.
                                     [3894] Are we gonna get i I don't think
                                     we're gonna get in.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3895] Course we are.
Tim (PS088)                          [3896] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3897] I've never known it that full
                                     before. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3898] Where to park? [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [3899] There's a space.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3900] There aren't any spaces.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3901] Well just keep going round.
                                     [3902] There was some space at the other
                                     end actually.
Tim (PS088)                          [3903] There's a space.
                                     [3904] Just missed a space.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3905] I don't think we did Tim .
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3906] No there weren't any.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3907] No.
                                     [3908] I think there's one just over here.
                                     [3909] ... Oh [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [3910] How you [...] space?
Christopher (PS089)                  [3911] Where?

                                     [3913] That's the one I saw when I was
                                     coming in.
                                     [3914] Don't know if you're meant to use
                                     it.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3915] Well [...]

Andrew (PS08A)                       [3917] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3918] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3919] [...] I'd better get out this side
                                     I think.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3920] Why?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [3921] No, your side I mean.
                                     [3922] Cos it's flowers and things.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh] ...

Tim (PS088)                          [3928] I'm going out here.
Christopher (PS089)                  [3929] Who is dead?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3930] [laughing] Ronald MacDonald [] .
                                     [3931] Isn't he dead, Ronald MacDonald?
                                     [3932] ... Or perhaps it's sort of some
                                     dressed up character.
Tim (PS088)                          [3933] Don't!
Dorothy (PS087)                      [3934] Okay.

                                     you going to sit here to have your meal?
                                     [3936] Just wait Tim cos there's lots of
                                     cars.

                allowed in this place ... not even ... erm historians who write
                about famous buildings, even they had been refused access!

Andrew (PS08A)  [4169] Somewhere in Oxfordshire.
Dorothy (PS087) [4170] Oh!
                [4171] ... They don't know where?
Andrew (PS08A)  [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4172] Oh ... [...] .
                [4173] ... So
Andrew (PS08A)  [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4174] this was about last week's episode?
Andrew (PS08A)  [4175] I think it was about last week's epi , but they seem to
                e ... imply that it was last week's episode that would
Dorothy (PS087) [4176] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4177] do it.
Dorothy (PS087) [4178] We seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it
                watched before Wednesday.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4179] Alright.
                [4180] ... Well that's the only chance.
Dorothy (PS087) [4181] Oh yeah cos we're going to Maryland tomorrow.
                [4182] [...] your dad.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4183] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087) [4184] Erm ... not it wasn't about your dad, it was about my
                birthday ... cos
Andrew (PS08A)  [4185] Cos yo
Dorothy (PS087) [4186] he'd realized that it was my birthday, and wha , what
                did I want?
                [4187] ... So I said send me a cheque and I'll go and shop.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4188] And?
Dorothy (PS087) [4189] And ... [...] last week cos she's ... quite generous
                isn't she?
Andrew (PS08A)  [4190] She is a bit but it's [...] .
Dorothy (PS087) [4191] No, I didn't say anything.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4192] I think that's the thing.
Dorothy (PS087) [4193] So your dad sent a cheque.
                [4194] [laugh] ... Anyway I asked her if she'd heard from your
                dad, and she has heard from your dad ... apparently on Friday
                ... he went ... to the ... consultant
Andrew (PS08A)  [4195] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087) [4196] and next week he's got his first ... well she didn't
                know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
                [4197] ... And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or
                three times a week now.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4198] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087) [4199] I don't know how long it's going to go on for, or what
                it is exactly but I thought ... it would be a good idea to ring
                your dad up ... and see.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4200] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087) [4201] [...] ... But at least things have moved, and at least
                they've gone round.
                [4202] ... So I'm pleased really, are you?
                [4203] ... Interesting that they've done it so quickly isn't
                it?
                [4204] After seeing him, because he thought that once ... he'd
                seen the consultant it would then take some time to ... get the
                treatment started, but they must have got themselves over that.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4205] Yeah.
                [4206] ... Well I mean everyone [...] .
Dorothy (PS087) [4207] Yeah.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4208] I think [...] .
Dorothy (PS087) [4209] Gotta get moving.
Andrew (PS08A)  [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4210] And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him ...
                has had tha , upset that thrombosis again.
                [4211] ... I don't know whether to ring him tonight, oh it's
                too late tonight now.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4212] It's much too late.
Dorothy (PS087) [4213] Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the
                children are up?
                [4214] ... Well they love talking to them on the phone don't
                they?
Andrew (PS08A)  [4215] I know they do.
Dorothy (PS087) [4216] We could can prime them up on what to say ... and types
                of things to talk about ... so they don't get ... moaned down
                or something [...] !
                [4217] ... Bogged down [...] !
Andrew (PS08A)  [4218] So he's had to go in, what did you say?
                [4219] Three times a week?
Dorothy (PS087) [4220] I don't know ... she just said
Andrew (PS08A)  [4221] Something like that
Dorothy (PS087) [4222] a few times a week ... and I think it sounded like three
                ... cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and
                everything.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4223] Mm ... a trial!
Dorothy (PS087) [4224] Well ... I hope not ... I mean no he won't be able to
                drive
Andrew (PS08A)  [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4225] but presumably your mum can do that for, they've got
                hundreds of people there, he's always driving people everywhere

Andrew (PS08A)  [4226] That's right.
Dorothy (PS087) [4227] so I don't see why they can't drive him!
                [4228] ... I'm sure they will
Andrew (PS08A)  [4229] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087) [4230] cos they're very good aren't they?
                [4231] I mean look at that woman doing her ... er ... [...]
                from the ... from the church.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4232] At times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer
                ... could help out.
Dorothy (PS087) [4233] It would nice if we lived there but we can't so ...
                [...]
Andrew (PS08A)  [4234] It's ... about [...] .
Dorothy (PS087) [4235] And write as well.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4236] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087) [4237] Double dose.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4238] Yes.
                [4239] ... And pulled out.
Dorothy (PS087) [4240] Well it's sort of pulled out, but at least it's [...] .
Andrew (PS08A)  [4241] We'll be paying for it as well.
Dorothy (PS087) [4242] And it's hard as well.
Andrew (PS08A)  [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4243] We've been paying anyway, so it must of ... you know.
                [4244] ... What does erm ... you see ... er ... Eileen's [...]
                ... and she's having chemotherapy isn't she?
                [4245] By me , by medication, is
Andrew (PS08A)  [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4246] that right?
Andrew (PS08A)  [4247] Well she takes all these tablet things.
Dorothy (PS087) [4248] That's right ... she has a sort of ... massive dose
                every now and then.
                [4249] ... And that makes her feel ... what?
                [4250] ... She's not in pain [...] is she?
                [4251] More sort of ... dopey.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4252] I wouldn't care if they made me dazed [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4253] Yeah.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4254] [...] !
Dorothy (PS087) [4255] Yeah.
                [4256] ... I dunno.
Andrew (PS08A)  [4257] Not gonna [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4258] Difficult to know.
Andrew (PS08A)  [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [4259] Oh yes, that was it!
                [4260] ... I wonder how bad it is, that feeling's like, we
                don't really know ... how bad it is do we?
Andrew (PS08A)  [4261] No.
Dorothy (PS087) [4262] Perhaps he will be able to say, you know?
                [4263] ... But whether he'd tell us over the telephone, [...]
                you think ask.
                [4264] ... I think he would wouldn't he?
Andrew (PS08A)  [4265] I think so.

Tim (PS088)         [4646] you coming back?
Dorothy (PS087)     [4647] it's meant to be a bonsai tree which looks like a
                    tree but it's only very small ... like that high.
                    [4648] ... But at the moment I think there's lots and lots
                    of seeds.
                    [4649] ... I think there could be about fifteen trees in
                    there, so far.
Tim (PS088)         [...]
Dorothy (PS087)     [4650] That fish came zooming up to the top then, to see
                    what you were doing.

Dorothy (PS087)     [4652] Now then Tim, not too much, alright?
                    [4653] ... These are fish, not sharks.

Dorothy (PS087)     [4832] the playground.

                    Verona ... and guess what happened?

Christopher (PS089) [4839] He was looking where he was going!
Tim (PS088)         [4840] These are [...] .
Christopher (PS089) [4841] And he said it was my fault, but it wasn't!
Dorothy (PS087)     [laugh]
Christopher (PS089) [4842] Was it mummy?
Dorothy (PS087)     [4843] Well I don't, I presume it wasn't.
Tim (PS088)         [4844] Need a bin..
Dorothy (PS087)     [4845] Mind you, if you were going the same way as he
                    wanted go, and he was going the way you wanted to go
Tim (PS088)         [4846] Need a bin.
Dorothy (PS087)     [4847] and nobody wanted to move, then you would bang, and
                    it
Tim (PS088)         [4848] Need a bin!
Dorothy (PS087)     [4849] would be both people's fault.
                    [4850] ... You do need a bin, you're right, it's over
                    there.
Tim (PS088)         [4851] Is she in the [...]
Christopher (PS089) [4852] Darren just

Dorothy (PS087)     [4855] Well that's [...]
Tim (PS088)         [4856] Mummy!
Dorothy (PS087)     [4857] what he was doing too.
Tim (PS088)         [4858] If you look after these, and I
Dorothy (PS087)     [4859] I'll look after those.
Tim (PS088)         [4860] with the bin.
Dorothy (PS087)     [4861] And while you're at it with the bin get yourself a
                    tissue as well, to wipe your nose.
                    [4862] ... The trouble is, you see, if Christopher's doing
                    what he wants to do, you're doing what you all want to do
                    ... and then both ... both of you crash in the middle ...
                    it's nobody's fault particularly is it? [laugh]
Christopher (PS089) [4863] It ... I didn't go like that.
Dorothy (PS087)     [4864] Well what you've got to do, you've both got to
                    learn.
Christopher (PS089) [4865] I was ... I was ... there
Dorothy (PS087)     [4866] You've both got to learn
Christopher (PS089) [4867] and I was there ... Jemima was there ... I was
                    there, and Jemima there
Dorothy (PS087)     [4868] Mm.
Christopher (PS089) [4869] Chris was there
Dorothy (PS087)     [4870] Mm.
Christopher (PS089) [4871] and I went round there and he went straight into me.
Dorothy (PS087)     [4872] Oh there we go.
                    [4873] ... I suspect that one day, you'll both learn to
                    look where you're going ... and both move ... out of the
                    way.
Tim (PS088)         [4874] Can you get a nice [...] .

                    [4881] ... Erm ... number one ... [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)     [4882] Ah you've ... already wiped your nose, you've wiped
                    it over your cheek!
                    [4883] ... Yuk!
                    [4884] ... Urgh, what a mess!
                    [4885] ... Right, what are we doing now, sharpening this?
Tim (PS088)         [4886] Yeah.
                    [4887] ... Cos it's you ... cos we've had blue.

Christopher (PS089) [4898] No.
Dorothy (PS087)     [4899] No.
                    [4900] ... I think you should, do you?
Christopher (PS089) [4901] But I don't know where it is.
Dorothy (PS087)     [4902] Hello dear.

Dorothy (PS087)     [4924] I suppose as long as you bring them back, it won't
                    matter.

Dorothy (PS087)     [4930] I suppose for ... hours ... cos I had loads from
                    when I was teaching so wi ... that, I've donated those cos
                    ... our own children would never get to mark them.

Tim (PS088)         [4955] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)     [4956] Cos he's thinking about Jesus.
                    [4957] ... I think he's going to the dentist or something,
                    and he's a bit frightened ... so he thinks, he thinks of

Tim (PS088)         [5148] Mummy!
Dorothy (PS087)     [5149] you know, sometimes people, sort of, look as if
                    they've just got out of bed!
Andrew (PS08A)      [5150] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)     [5151] Probably they had!
                    [5152] ... They seemed sort of keen and enthusiastic today.
                    [5153] ... That's nice
Tim (PS088)         [5154] I don't want that there!
Dorothy (PS087)     [5155] it sort of inspires everybody to be keen and
                    enthusiastic then.
                    [5156] ... There seem to be ... large quantities of path
                    finders going up and down like those.

Dorothy (PS087)     [5158] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)      [5159] You see, I know ... [...]
Dorothy (PS087)     [5160] Well, I asked them you know, and they said

Dorothy (PS087)     [5162] oh yes, it went very jollily.
Tim (PS088)         [5163] I don't want this bit!
Dorothy (PS087)     [5164] Well I'm not surprised when it's been in your mouth,
                    and then you threw it out again!
                    [5165] ... You were a bit silly to put it all in at once,
                    weren't you really?

                    [6405] ... Are you capable of getting to the library ...
                    Christopher?

                    then you stay with me and we'll potter around ... the shops
                    and the little library.
                    [6407] ... Actually that'll be quite good cos that'd be
                    nice to see whether you can ... get out and about without
                    keeling over!
                    [6408] ... And then you can come home and have a rest when

Dorothy (PS087)     [6413] To school you mean?
                    [6414] ... I thought we might just keep an eye open for
                    Margaret and Beth
Tim (PS088)         [6415] Beth!
Dorothy (PS087)     [6416] walking up the road, we can tell them.

Dorothy (PS087)     [6423] Is it? ... [...] if it was James ... to give them a
                    message at school.
Christopher (PS089) [6424] It might be, I don't think it is James.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6425] Certainly somebody singing and dancing.
Christopher (PS089) [6426] Er no it isn't James.
                    [6427] ... No!
Dorothy (PS087)     [6428] Mhm.

                    with the church ... I went to scramblers.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6448] Yes you did, that was yesterday when we went to
                    church and scramblers, but Christopher didn't go to [...]
                    cos he wasn't very well was he?
Tim (PS088)         [6449] That's [...] !
Christopher (PS089) [6450] It was a good job I didn't go because I would be
                    sick there.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6451] Yeah, we didn't want you being sick in [...] .
Tim (PS088)         [6452] And you went
Christopher (PS089) [6453] Because

Christopher (PS089) [...]
Tim (PS088)         [6458] the guitar.

Tim (PS088)         [6460] It's not in the guitar ... oh! ... [...] ... over
                    here.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6461] I think we'll just have a nice quiet day today ...
                    erm ... there's a little bit of a snag because I don't
                    quite know what we're going to do about all these children
                    that like to go to the library.
                    [6462] ... We usually have them all in the car. [playing
                    guitar]
Dorothy (PS087)     [laugh]
Tim (PS088)         [6463] Where's my plectrum now?
Dorothy (PS087)     [6464] I don't know where your plectrum is, I expect it's
                    on the floor somewhere waiting for my hoover to get it!
Tim (PS088)         [6465] No!
                    [6466] ... I want it for my guitar!
Dorothy (PS087)     [6467] Well it's alright I'll keep my eyes open and if I
                    see it I'll pick it up.
Tim (PS088)         [6468] No, I want to spin it.
                    [6469] ... Have to remind me cos
Christopher (PS089) [6470] What does he want?
Tim (PS088)         [6471] I have to ... go do on the floor
Christopher (PS089) [...]
Dorothy (PS087)     [6472] Right, have you done your teeth this morning
                    sunshine?
Tim (PS088)         [6473] And ... I haven't.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6474] You haven't, right well go and do yours then, then
                    we'll know it's done.
Tim (PS088)         [6475] He ... he hasn't.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6476] Yes he has, he's just been up there to do them cos
                    he thought he might be going to school ... now he's decided
                    he's not so we'll put the school clothes away again.
                    [6477] ... It's all very tricky to know isn't it?
                    [6478] Whether to go or not.
                    [6479] ... It's ... and it's a bit of a ... an exhausting
                    day if you don't feel too well.
Christopher (PS089) [6480] Mum why did you ... bring some more clothes?
Dorothy (PS087)     [6481] I didn't
Tim (PS088)         [6482] Whoops!
Dorothy (PS087)     [6483] these are yesterday's.

                    [...] ... no, it's not in there.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6486] Have we seen Margaret coming along yet?
Christopher (PS089) [6487] I've not seen them.
Dorothy (PS087)     [6488] No, I haven't either.
                    [6489] You keep your eyes open, see if you can see her.
                    [6490] ... Will you see her from down there?
                    [6491] ... Tim would you like to come and do your teeth?
                    [6492] ... Please.
Tim (PS088)         [6493] Not yet!
Christopher (PS089) [6494] Why do they call her Margaret?
Dorothy (PS087)     [6495] Well that's her name, ha!
                    [6496] ... I expect her mum called it her, when she was a
                    little baby.
*** 19 (Tape 022403) ***
Dorothy (PS087) [6497] Right Tim, watch my lips ... please could you go

Dorothy (PS087)            [6712] No love, it's not lunch time.
                           [6713] Are you hungry?
                           [6714] ... I think you must be getting better,
                           myself.
Christopher (PS089)        [6715] I'm hungry because I haven't had ... lunch.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6716] Well you didn't eat anything yesterday did
                           you, except half a hot cross bun which is a funny
                           thing to eat, but never mind!
Christopher (PS089)        [6717] Because I ... wanted to [...] having another
                           one ... but I [...]
Dorothy (PS087)            [6718] You fell asleep!
Christopher (PS089)        [6719] Oh [...] !
Dorothy (PS087)            [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)        [6720] I didn't!
Dorothy (PS087)            [6721] You did, you went were fast asleep!
                           [6722] ... You ate your hot cross bun and then you
                           fell fast asleep on the settee.
Christopher (PS089)        [...]
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6723] Who?
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6724] This ... dinner.
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6725] Oh yes!
                           [6726] ... Are you alright?
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6727] Yes ... it's ready for anything!
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6728] Yeah he seems to be.
Christopher (PS089)        [6729] Mummy, my head hurts!
Dorothy (PS087)            [6730] Your head hurts?
Christopher (PS089)        [6731] Over there.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6732] Oh dear!
                           [6733] ... I thought that might happen
Christopher (PS089)        [...]
Dorothy (PS087)            [6734] as we got a bit nearer to the library.
                           [6735] ... Well not to worry cos we're nearly there
                           so we can have a sit down
Tim (PS088)                [6736] [...] you got a headache.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6737] You sit down and have a rest, and we'll pop
                           in the chemist and get some Calpol, cos we're
                           running out.
                           [6738] ... And a dose of Calpol will sort you out
                           ... and a nice rest when we get home.
                           [6739] ... Good job
Christopher (PS089)        [6740] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6741] we didn't go to school after all, isn't it?
Christopher (PS089)        [6742] What?
Dorothy (PS087)            [6743] Good job we didn't go to school after all,
                           cos you'd of run round in the playground, you'd of
                           been shattered! ... [...] ... oops, too late!
Christopher (PS089)        [6744] What's that bin?
Dorothy (PS087)            [6745] I don't know ... it's a bin!
Tim (PS088)                [6746] Well why is the bin over there?
Dorothy (PS087)            [6747] I don't know, it looks as if it's got some
                           grit in it for when it gets icy ... I suppose you
                           have to put he grit down there.
Christopher (PS089)        [6748] But there's only one plate mum ... [...] in
                           the ground.
Tim (PS088)                [6749] But Teddy's still
Dorothy (PS087)            [6750] Mm.
Tim (PS088)                [6751] sad!
Dorothy (PS087)            [6752] Teddy's still sad?
                           [6753] ... I don't know what you're gonna do to
                           cheer him up.
Tim (PS088)                [6754] No.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6755] You'll have to give him lots of love.
Christopher (PS089)        [6756] [...] didn't he?
                           [6757] ... He normally gets to ... [...] .
Christopher (PS089)        [6758] This door's open.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6759] Mhm.
Tim (PS088)                [6760] I can [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)            [6761] Did you?
                           [6762] Another dream?
Tim (PS088)                [6763] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6764] What was that?
                           [6765] ... A funny one this time, or a scary one?
Tim (PS088)                [6766] It was a dream that Mrs was there again.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6767] [laughing] Mrs [] !
Tim (PS088)                [6768] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6769] [laughing] Well what did Mrs say [] ?
Tim (PS088)                [6770] It's not [...] ... about her.
                           [6771] ... It was the morning then ... [...] coming
                           ... [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)            [6772] [laughing] Oh I see [] !
                           [6773] ... And what did she do?
                           [6774] ... Was it a nice day?
                           [6775] ... Everything go funny?
Tim (PS088)                [6776] What?
Dorothy (PS087)            [6777] Sometimes in dreams everything goes most
                           peculiar doesn't it?
Tim (PS088)                [6778] But it wasn't very sad.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6779] No, it was a pleasant dream.
                           [6780] Sometimes dreams are quite pleasant, you
                           think, ooh I like that dream, I'd like that one
                           again.
                           [6781] ... It never quite works out like that.
Christopher (PS089)        [6782] No because you forget it in the end
Dorothy (PS087)            [6783] [laughing] Oh yeah
Christopher (PS089)        [6784] lots of dreams like that.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6785] that's right [] .
Christopher (PS089)        [6786] Because when you remember it, it might come
                           again.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6787] [laughing] Yeah [] !
Christopher (PS089)        [6788] Then you remember it and it ... starts to
                           come a bit true doesn't it?
Dorothy (PS087)            [6789] Mm mm.
Tim (PS088)                [singing] [...] []
Dorothy (PS087)            [6790] Well ... I don't think they come true really
                           ... it just sort of feels real.
Tim (PS088)                [singing] [...] []
Christopher (PS089)        [6791] Mm.
Tim (PS088)                [singing] [...] []
Dorothy (PS087)            [6792] Sometimes you can wake up and you think, ooh
                           that was very real and then when you think about it
Tim (PS088)                [singing] [...] []
Dorothy (PS087)            [6793] you think, ooh that was most
Tim (PS088)                [singing] [...] []
Dorothy (PS087)            [6794] odd!
                           [6795] ... Couldn't possibly of been real!
Tim (PS088)                [...] ... [singing] [...] []
Dorothy (PS087)            [6796] I think the night was full of dreams for all
                           sorts of people [...] .
Christopher (PS089)        [6797] But mummy ... [...] ... that ... I sort of
                           thought Adele would act ... [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)            [6798] [laugh] ... But really you were in bed.
Christopher (PS089)        [6799] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6800] Mm mm.
                           [6801] ... But sometimes when you're not very well
                           and you get very very hot you get funny dreams, I
                           think you had a very funny dream in the middle of
                           last night didn't you?
                           [6802] ... Do you remember?
                           [6803] You were very frightened, we had to get you
                           up ... read you a story ... have a cuddle ... put
                           the light on.
Christopher (PS089)        [6804] I couldn't remember when, I don't think.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6805] It was something like half past two in the
                           morning!
                           [6806] ... Anyway it didn't matter cos you were very
                           good, and you went back to sleep again in the end
                           ... then you didn't wake up till after daddy had
                           gone to work this morning! [road works in
                           background]
Christopher (PS089)        [6807] No ... because then, I just looked ... over
                           all those things that ... I went ... and ... [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)            [6808] Oh right.
Christopher (PS089)        [6809] And then, I knocked at the [...] very ...
                           weak ... leg.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6810] Aha.
Christopher (PS089)        [6811] And when I looked at the clock, I was on time
                           ... and [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)            [6812] [laugh] ... Didn't matter, we were glad you
                           had a good long sleep, cos it makes you
Tim (PS088)                [6813] [shouting] Mummy [] !

Tim (PS088)                [6816] Mummy!
Dorothy (PS087)            [6817] may we ask?
                           [6818] ... Oh dear!
                           [6819] ... Come on or else you'll miss the story,
                           it's nearly time.
                           [6820] ... Only two minutes to go!
Tim (PS088)                [6821] I'm ready to have a

Dorothy (PS087)            [6828] Well walk round!
Tim (PS088)                [6829] I can't do it mummy!
Dorothy (PS087)            [6830] Well you did it the other day but then you
                           didn't have a teddy in your hand did you?
Tim (PS088)                [6831] You hold the teddy, cos I have a teddy in my
                           hand.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6832] I'll hold the teddy.
Tim (PS088)                [6833] And you have a ... [...] I can't

Tim (PS088)                [6836] Yeah, I did it!
Dorothy (PS087)            [6837] There you go.
Tim (PS088)                [6838] There's more there.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6839] I know, I don't know what they're doing
                           there, do you?
Christopher (PS089)        [6840] They're doing it there, and they go up the
                           way.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6841] Well they're digging everywhere round here at

Christopher (PS089)        [6871] Mummy.

Christopher (PS089)        [6947] Mhm.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6948] I thought we'd do it in the fresh air rather
                           than in the car, cos it just means
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6949] What is that?
Dorothy (PS087)            [6950] Oh yes, attached to it, and you've just had
                           yourself taped by the way.

                           after they got home ... you know how we're very
                           susceptible to these market research [...] types?
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6954] Oh yes.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6955] And erm ... it's all to do with language in
                           the nineteen nineties ... to go to be ...
                           transcribed for posterity and used ... to see the
                           change and development of languages
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6956] Oh I see.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6957] and the dictionary people [...] ... so I have
                           to tape myself conversing with people

Dorothy (PS087)            [6958] for a week .
                           [6959] ... Which is all very entertaining!
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6960] Yes.

Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6962] [laughing] [...] [] !
Dorothy (PS087)            [6963] things like that, but I'm sure they'll sort
                           it out.
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087)            [6964] I presume that's why it's for a week, you
                           know?
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6965] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6966] Out of twenty tapes surely they'll be one
                           that

Dorothy (PS087)            [6967] wouldn't ... [laughing] will [...] [] !

                           first, and then we'll come back and ... get bits and
                           pieces on the way Christopher.
                           [6970] ... Goes through phases of being quite ...

Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6971] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6972] and then other times of being
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6973] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6974] pathetic!

Dorothy (PS087)            [6986] by ... just a pathetic little effort
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6987] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6988] really, for me, I suppose.
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6989] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)            [6990] But Martin's been alright has he then?
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK) [6991] He's just a little bit hot, but he's not

Dorothy (PS087)                      [7273] Is it important?

                                     up off the shelf.
Christopher (PS089)                  [7275] What does that say?
                                     [7276] ... Mum, what does that

Christopher (PS089)                  [7279] Wa ... Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [7280] Probably because ... he's an author
                                     ... or she's an author.
Christopher (PS089)                  [7281] He's an author.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [7282] He, it says ... John Wainwright,
                                     there we are ... if you want to ... pick

                                     shelves.

                                     on!
Dorothy (PS087)                      [7287] Oh ... that's probably because they
                                     want you to look for yourself.
                                     [7288] ... Can't remember if I've read
                                     this one or not.

Christopher (PS089)                  [7292] No, it sounds like Ian.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [7293] Actually you're right, it does
                                     [laughing] sound like Ian [] !

                                     [8634] Cos if you eat biscuits and stuff

Christopher (PS089)                  [8663] Can you see the grass is cut?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8664] You've been cutting the bottom part
                                     of the grass?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8665] We have.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [8671] Seems like an appropriate thing to

                                     came just as I was about to take my first
                                     mouthful of cereal.
                                     [8738] It was about quarter to eight
                                     before everybody, well ... after that
Christopher (PS089)                  [8739] No but it wasn't.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8740] What time did you get up?
                                     [8741] ... What time did you go?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8742] I left at twenty to eight.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8743] Mm.
                                     [8744] It was about ... ten to eight
                                     [eating] when Christopher got up.
                                     [8745] ... But Tim was still asleep ...
                                     till about quarter past eight [] .
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8746] Oh.
Tim (PS088)                          [8747] And I shouted for daddy.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8748] Did you?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8749] Which is unheard of.
                                     [8750] Yes you did shout for daddy.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8751] You shouted for daddy?
                                     [8752] I was already at work.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8753] There was no daddy.
                                     [8754] He'd gone to work already.
                                     [8755] ... So then we had a bit of a
                                     wonder whether or not Christopher should
                                     go to school.
                                     [8756] And I decided he was, should stay
                                     at home. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8757] It's probably just as well cos
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8758] Mm.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [8760] He was a bit sort of wobbly on his
                                     legs at the beginning of the day but he's
                                     been

Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8769] We did go down to the library.
                                     [8770] Cos I thought it would, it was such
                                     a warm day I thought it would be quite
                                     nice for him to have a walk ... see if he
                                     ... was alright.
                                     [8771] Anyway managed to walk to the
                                     library and walk down the shops [...] .
                                     [8772] But when we got back we had to lie
                                     down in front of the video for a bit.
                                     [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [8773] Mum [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [8774] Mum, can I [...] for a minute
                                     please.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8775] Mhm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8776] So you just did your own private
                                     trip to the library [...] ?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8777] Yeah I rang up and said I wasn't
                                     gonna go ... [...] the children.
                                     [8778] Anyway it turned out we met Ann and
                                     ... erm both Martin and Ian are ... been
                                     having a similar trauma.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8779] Have they?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8780] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8781] Oh.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8782] Ian's been sort of talking about
                                     all sorts of strange things in his sleep
                                     and
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8783] Really?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8784] delirious and hot ... hot
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8785] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8786] [...] fever.
                                     [8787] ... So
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8788] It's odd.
                                     [8789] A bug they're passing around.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8790] Mm.
                                     [8791] Must be.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8792] Child to child.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8793] And she said Martin was hot but
                                     nothing too traumatic.
                                     [8794] A bit like these two really.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8795] Mm. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8796] But Ian had been sick as well. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8797] So it's likely they picked it up
                                     from them.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8798] I should think so.
                                     [8799] Although Christopher didn't really
                                     see much of them did he?
                                     [8800] Oh he did on Thursday didn't he?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8801] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8802] I would have thought Tim would have
                                     had it worse from ... contact erm wise.
                                     [8803] ... These things don't work like
                                     that do they?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8804] No.
                                     [8805] ... And is the parentage alright?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8806] Mm. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8807] Only strikes children.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8808] Yeah.
                                     [8809] Well it certainly did ... in both
                                     these cases.
                                     [8810] ... Although I met Theresa on the
                                     way back from erm ... school and she said
                                     Alec was at the doctors cos ... not the
                                     way back from school, way back from the
                                     library.
                                     [8811] And she said Alec was at the
                                     doctors cos he was feeling ... under the
                                     weather.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8812] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8813] So I don't know what that's in aid
                                     of. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8814] Julia [...] ill so she
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8815] Was she?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8816] won't be at work tomorrow.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8817] Oh dear.
                                     [8818] What's the matter with her?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [8819] I don't want the meat.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8820] [laugh] What's the matter with her?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8821] Sore throat.
Tim (PS088)                          [8822] I don't want the meat.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8823] You don't want the meat?
Tim (PS088)                          [8824] No.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8825] You usually like meat.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8826] It probably needs chopping up.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8827] Mm.
                                     [8828] Let's chop it for you.
Tim (PS088)                          [8829] No I don't want it chopped.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8830] Tim listen.
                                     [8831] I'm going to chop you
Tim (PS088)                          [8832] I don't want
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8833] I'm going to chop you one piece of
                                     meat okay?
                                     [8834] We'll take away the other piece.
Tim (PS088)                          [8835] A big pieces.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8836] Yeah.
                                     [8837] There you go.
                                     [8838] It'll be nice now.
                                     [8839] Nice and tasty.
                                     [8840] ... Well done Christopher.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8841] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8842] You alright?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8843] Must be getting better.
                                     [8844] ... So, it's been a nice warm day
                                     has it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8845] Well it has really.
                                     [8846] It's been a bit sort of muggy this
                                     afternoon but we went out in the garden
                                     and we sort of just pottled around you
                                     know?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8847] Better than the weekend weather
                                     that I saw?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8848] Yeah.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8849] [laugh] It's amazing how the worst
                                     weather we've had recently has been on ...
                                     Saturdays and Sundays isn't it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8850] Mm.
                                     [8851] It's certainly very wet out there.
                                     ...
Tim (PS088)                          [8852] We had a go on the swing.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8853] Did you?
                                     [8854] You've been on the swing?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8855] Apart from her sore throat was
                                     Julie okay?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8856] Seemed alright.
Tim (PS088)                          [8857] I [...] wobbly.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8858] Mm?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8859] Yeah.
                                     [8860] ... No it was a fairly quiet day
                                     really.
                                     [8861] Not many people seemed to be at
                                     work.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8862] Oh.
                                     [8863] Where are they all?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8864] Some at meetings [...] .
                                     [8865] Like you know all
Tim (PS088)                          [8866] Yeah
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8867] the people who went to Pontepool
                                     last week?
                                     [8868] Well they're all off in Bromsgrove
                                     this week [...] .
Tim (PS088)                          [8869] Potato.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8870] Mm. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8871] [...] and big Patrick and Sue [...]

Dorothy (PS087)                      [8872] Oh yeah, in Bromsgrove yeah.
                                     [8873] Mm.
                                     [8874] What do they do?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8875] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...] ...
Tim (PS088)                          [8876] You gave me lots.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8877] I did not.
Tim (PS088)                          [8878] You did.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8879] I certainly didn't give you lots of
                                     meat.
Tim (PS088)                          [8880] I'm full.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8881] Oh that's alright.
                                     [8882] You don't need to have anything
                                     else. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [8883] I want my pudding.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8884] Oh no.
                                     [8885] If you're full you won't need
                                     pudding.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8886] No it'll be a tiny pudding if
                                     you're ... not gonna eat er finish all
                                     that. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [8887] It's too much.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8888] Well that's okay.
                                     [8889] You can leave it but you just don't
                                     get pudding as well. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8890] You eat just a little bit more.
                                     [8891] Cos then you can have a little
                                     pudding.
                                     [8892] That's it, you eat just a little
                                     bit more. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8893] That's very tasty mummy.
                                     [8894] [...] Certainly looks as though
                                     it's a ... Rosemary Conley type thing.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]

Andrew (PS08A)                       [8936] Yes.
Tim (PS088)                          [8937] we saw a boat, the big boat.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8938] About a big boat.
                                     [8939] What's the big boat?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [8940] He tells me
Tim (PS088)                          [8941] You know you you told me about the

Dorothy (PS087)                      [8943] Oh, right.
                                     [8944] I think that was a different boat
                                     to the one that they showed you on the

Andrew (PS08A)                       [8945] I was telling you about the Queen
                                     Mary.
                                     [8946] Because it was on the back of ...
                                     something which he was making recently.
                                     [8947] You know he was cutting out some

Dorothy (PS087)                      [8948] Mm.
                                     [8949] He showed me what it was.
                                     [8950] But I couldn't tell that it was the
                                     Queen Mary at the time because he'd
                                     already cut it out.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [8951] and I was saying that it's a big
                                     boat that used to go across the world.
                                     [8952] And when I was a little boy just a

                                     it was very busy, there were lots of
                                     people going through the tills.
                                     [9157] ... So anyway this girl eventually
                                     she said she was, it was her coffee break
                                     but she would come er in passing and sort
                                     us out.
Tim (PS088)                          [9158] But mummy ... mummy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9159] [laughing] So she came down, it was
                                     so embarrassing [] .
Tim (PS088)                          [9160] [shouting] Mummy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9161] I explained about the Rice Crispies
                                     she said ah
Tim (PS088)                          [9162] Mummy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9163] I think there must be some in here.
                                     [9164] There was another great big box but
                                     instead of being up high it was down below
                                     and I could easily
Tim (PS088)                          [9165] Mummy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9166] have helped myself [laughing] to it

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9172] They must have been unpacking Rice
                                     Crispies.
Tim (PS088)                          [9173] Mummy
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9174] They were a bit away from the Rice
                                     Crispie hole type of thing but ... if I'd
                                     have used my eyes I would have noticed
                                     where they were.
Tim (PS088)                          [9175] Mummy [] mummy.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9180] Come on.
                                     [9181] Let's hear it.

                                     [9183] Something about going to the shops?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9184] Or something about going to the
                                     library?
                                     [9185] Who do you take to the library with
                                     you?
                                     [9186] ... No.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9187] Oh, didn't Christopher go to the
                                     library?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9188] Well he did but ... we didn't sort
                                     of take Christopher.
                                     [9189] He just came.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9190] Oh.
                                     [9191] Somebody else came did they?
                                     [9192] Did you?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9193] Who did you take to the library
                                     with you?
                                     [9194] In your hand, who did you have? ...

Christopher (PS089)                  [9199] He chose [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9200] We hadn't actually heard anything
                                     about this library experience but when I
                                     asked him he wouldn't say anything.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9201] [...] don't know what [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9202] We don't quite know what happened.
Tim (PS088)                          [9203] [...] to teddies.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9204] What did you do with them when you
                                     got in there? ...
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [9205] What was it called?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9206] You had a biscuit?
                                     [9207] Mm.
                                     [9208] We saw the biscuit
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9209] A picnic.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9210] a picnic!
                                     [9211] ... You had a picnic?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9212] A picnic for teddies?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9213] Well well.
                                     [9214] A pretend picnic?
                                     [9215] ... Mm.
                                     [9216] He came out with a a a biscuit
                                     covered in desiccated coconut.
                                     [9217] Which he didn't like to eat so
                                     [laughing] Cider ate it in the end.
                                     [9218] Cider the dog [] .
Andrew (PS08A)                       [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [9219] You can guess what happened ... he
                                     gave it to me.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9220] Yes.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9221] Mummy dropped it when she was
                                     giving it to me.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [9222] And then we had to pick it up and
                                     put it near Cider and Cider ate it.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9223] Cider likes coconut.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9224] However we still don't know what
                                     happened.
                                     [9225] Did you have some stories with this
                                     teddy?

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9232] A teddy went in the dump?
                                     [9233] Oh dear.
                                     [9234] Did they get him out again?
                                     [9235] ... Mm.

Christopher (PS089)                  [9247] Didn't they?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9248] Mm could have been that one.
                                     [9249] Did you have any more stories about

                                     [9264] Did the owl catch him?

                                     [9274] ... No.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9289] Well they didn't tell us why.
                                     [9290] ... Just said it wasn't.
                                     [9291] ... I think they're just a bit
                                     shortstaffed because ... the girl that's

                                     weeks, Josie.
                                     [9292] They've had the girl that's
                                     normally in there on a Saturday ... during
                                     the week.
                                     [9293] ... Perhaps she's ill. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [9294] What did you say?
                                     [9295] ... What did you say mother?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9296] I said there's normally a different
                                     lady in the ... in the library.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9297] For what?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9298] On a Monday.
                                     [9299] The lady that was in there today
                                     ... not Rosie the one that does the
                                     stories, she's always there ... well, when
                                     she's there.
                                     [9300] The other lady, Josie, she's
                                     normally ... in there.
                                     [9301] But she hasn't been there for a few
                                     weeks now so I think she might be ill.
                                     [9302] Or on holiday or something.
                                     [9303] No she can't be on holiday all that
                                     length of time.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9304] She's back now. [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9305] No she wasn't today.
                                     [9306] There was a lady there but that's
                                     the lady that normally goes on a Saturday.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9307] But why didn't she go on a Saturday
                                     then?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9308] Well I suppose she does go on a
                                     Saturday as well.
                                     [9309] They probably had to rake her in to
                                     ... hold the fort.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9310] I expect she didn't go [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9311] I don't know.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9312] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9313] I don't know whether she did or
                                     not. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [9314] I've got a [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [9315] We've got a train.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9316] Actually mummy
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9317] Mm.
Tim (PS088)                          [9318] We've got a train.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9319] Playbus said about a horse which
                                     goes slowly.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9320] Oh.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9321] They're all about animals really
                                     that do things.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9322] [...] think about.
                                     [9323] You'll enjoy that, it's all about
                                     eggs.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9324] Is it?
Christopher (PS089)                  [9325] [...] animals.
                                     [9326] ... Yes but you can't see that till
                                     after Rosie and Jim now.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9327] [laugh] Should you ever want to
                                     watch it all.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9328] I don't think I've got time to
                                     watch all these things.
                                     [9329] It's too exciting isn't it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9330] It's all very gripping.
                                     [9331] ... Well there won't be any time
                                     tomorrow to watch anything.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9332] There's three things.
                                     [9333] ... Well there's four things.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9334] I've arranged with my
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9335] Oh definitely tonight.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9336] [laugh] I've arranged with my
                                     mother to er take her home after tea.

Christopher (PS089)                  [9339] instead of Bump.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9340] She was quite happy to.
                                     [9341] She said ... she wanted to really.
                                     [9342] And she said
Christopher (PS089)                  [9343] Mum, there's something
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9344] she'd got to ... do Wednesday
                                     night.
                                     [9345] And I've just realized I'm supposed
                                     to do Wednesday night as well.
                                     [9346] I'd forgotten.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9347] Mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9348] So I'll have to prepare it tomorrow
                                     morning.
Tim (PS088)                          [9349] Mummy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9350] Or tonight, I could do.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9355] It's not been Bump for a week or
                                     two.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9356] Oh so it's something new now?
Tim (PS088)                          [9357] Yeah.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9358] Not Bump.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9359] Was it Poddington Peas? ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [9360] Oh it was something about peas.
                                     [9361] I don't know what it was.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9362] Yeah.

                                     called creepy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9367] Oh right.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9378] Oh dear.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9379] Why don't we start right at the
                                     beginning of the ... tape?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9380] Because we're not bothering
                                     watching any more now.
                                     [9381] That's it [...]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9382] I'm gonna wash up now.

                                     stories won't it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9384] I think so.
                                     [9385] It'll be bed time.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9386] Right.
                                     [9387] Okay.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9388] It's quarter past six already.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9389] But you were going to play
                                     tummyache.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9390] I expect you can play tummyache
                                     while I do
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9391] True.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9393] Yeah.
                                     [9394] Unless you want to play tummyache?

Andrew (PS08A)                       [9401] so daddy does the washing up.
                                     [9402] Except it looks as though I won't
                                     be washing up something here. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [9403] Sometimes we have [...] do the
                                     washing up.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9404] Why ... why is he not eating it up?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9405] It's pie.
                                     [9406] He doesn't like pie does he?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9407] He's always eaten it before.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9408] Has he?
                                     [9409] ... Are you gonna finish it?
                                     [9410] So is it okay if I eat it all?

Christopher (PS089)                  [9411] Mum, we were going to watch Rosie

Andrew (PS08A)                       [9412] Oh Tim, no.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9413] weren't we?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9414] Well we were, but only with daddy.
                                     [9415] We can always do it another day.
                                     [9416] Cos you know, as long as it's on
                                     there.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9417] Yeah.
                                     [9418] Cos last week I didn't see Rosie
                                     and Jim until ... nearly the end of the
                                     week. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9419] He doesn't mind do you daddy?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9420] No I don't mind as long as it's not
                                     wiped off.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9421] Not seeing it right at the minute.
                                     [9422] Well it won't be wiped off dear.
                                     [9423] ... Never wipe Rosie and Jim off
                                     for a long time.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9424] Tim!
Christopher (PS089)                  [9425] Yes you have, you wiped the jelly
                                     one off when it was ... very new.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9426] True.
                                     [9427] Sorry about that.

                                     rest through the week.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9451] Oh.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9452] Did I once?
                                     [9453] So I missed a few Playbuses.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9454] Mm.
                                     [9455] I don't think you do re miss it
                                     really.
                                     [9456] ... You see them in the end.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9457] I see them ... one day.

                                     haven't seen the racing.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9459] Do other people have so much
                                     trouble with their videos [...] ?
                                     [9460] [laugh] I wonder if other people
                                     have so much trouble videoing videos as we
                                     do?
Tim (PS088)                          [9461] The racing cars.

                                     [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9472] Do you think it'll wear off?
                                     [9473] You know as the newness of the
                                     video wears off.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9474] The racing lorry

                                     [9481] Come and watch this mummy.
                                     [9482] So I thought I would.
Tim (PS088)                          [9483] You haven't watched the racing
                                     cars.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9484] I haven't watched it.
                                     [9485] No I haven't seen it.
Tim (PS088)                          [9486] You watched none of them.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9487] I've not watched any videos or
                                     television all day because I've been hard
                                     at work.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9488] What might be more interesting is
                                     if re Christopher reads you his reading
                                     book from the library cos it's really good
                                     fun.
                                     [9489] You'll enjoy the story.
                                     [9490] Cos it was a surprise to us wasn't
                                     it?
Christopher (PS089)                  [9491] Yeah, it's not really about my mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9492] It's not about your mum the the
                                     window cleaner?
Christopher (PS089)                  [9493] No, it's about [...]

                                     [9497] Go and get it now cos he'll enjoy
                                     it.

                                     [9503] Right. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [9504] It's not long, that story.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9505] Isn't it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9506] And then we can play tummyache
                                     without any ... interruption.

                                     [9513] I watched that one as well.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9514] I think that might have gone
                                     actually this morning.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [9515] Right.

                                     [9576] See if you can be as clever as you
                                     were yesterday.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9577] Oh.

                                     somewhere.
                                     [9598] There it is.
Tim (PS088)                          [9599] Where?
                                     [9600] There ... there it is.

                                     [9610] That's very good.
Tim (PS088)                          [9611] That one and that one.

Tim (PS088)                          [9613] And that one.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9614] I think we'll only need three of
                                     them because daddy's
Tim (PS088)                          [9615] Yeah.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9622] Thankyou.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9623] So we don't need that plate then?
Tim (PS088)                          [9624] No.
                                     [9625] I'm gonna start.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9626] [...] in the middle.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9633] It's meant to be you really.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9634] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9635] Oh no it isn't.
                                     [9636] It's meant to be me.
                                     [9637] Clockwise.
                                     [9638] Beg pardon.
Tim (PS088)                          [9639] Cos I was going that way round.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9640] A carrot mm.

                                     haven't we?
                                     [9643] Ugh
Christopher (PS089)                  [9644] Ugh ...

Tim (PS088)                          [9647] Ooh [raspberry]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9648] It looks like flowers.
                                     [9649] ... A horrible fish.
                                     [9650] Ooh horrible things.
                                     [9651] Oh!
                                     [9652] I've got some nice peas.
                                     [9653] What shall I have, peas or carrots?
                                     [9654] I'll have peas.
                                     [9655] There you go Christopher if you'd
                                     like some carrots, some nice carrots you
                                     may.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9656] Instead of that horrible ... stuff
                                     and no-one will pick that will they.
                                     [9657] That's a nice thing.
                                     [9658] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9659] Oh jacket potato there Tim. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [9660] Mum, you're gonna win in the end.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9661] I hope so.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9662] I hope I'm gonna win.
                                     [9663] But I don't think Tim's going to
                                     win.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9664] You've got that upside down Tim.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9665] I don't think Tim's gonna win.
                                     [9666] ... Do you?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9667] No.
Tim (PS088)                          [9668] I'm going ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [9669] Mm.

                                     [9671] That's just what I fancy.
Tim (PS088)                          [9672] Your turn.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9673] Well I would if I wasn't full.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9674] Mm a nice drink.
                                     [9675] ... We like this, we get everything
                                     nice and he gets everything horrible.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9676] Well there he has got some nice
                                     tomatoes.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9677] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9678] What you doing? [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [9679] No, will I have to keep that? ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9680] And then I could do with a nice
                                     pudding.
                                     [9681] Oh.
                                     [9682] Oh that'll do.
                                     [9683] Mashed potatoes.
                                     [9684] Look at that, mashed potatoes ...
                                     pie and peas.
                                     [9685] ... What have you got?
                                     [9686] ... Oh fish fingers.

                                     [9688] Do you have fish fingers with
                                     carrots?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9689] Well you can do.
Tim (PS088)                          [9690] Have to shuffle these.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9691] Why?
Tim (PS088)                          [9692] Cos look ... I've made a mess.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9693] Oh I see.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9694] But if he does we might get the bad
                                     things.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9695] Doesn't matter.
                                     [9696] Come on.
Tim (PS088)                          [9697] If I have a horrible thing

Christopher (PS089)                  [9703] Not sure it is [...] cos it's
                                     baking.

Christopher (PS089)                  [9717] You want beans.
                                     [9718] You love beans.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9719] You're gonna have beans instead of
                                     tomatoes, yeah?
Tim (PS088)                          [9720] Cos I like these.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [9872] Horrid little flowers to eat.
                                     [9873] Ooh mashed potato.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9874] You've nearly won mummy.

Christopher (PS089)                  [9877] Oh all I need now is a fork.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9878] Oh you just need a nice fork.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9879] And all you need now
Tim (PS088)                          [9880] Ooh!
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9881] What's that one? ...
Tim (PS088)                          [9882] Nice.

Christopher (PS089)                  [9886] Look, that's what I had left.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9887] I don't think I'll have that.
                                     [9888] Oh a nice pudding.
                                     [9889] What shall I have?
                                     [9890] Oh I think I'll have the jelly.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9891] Yeah, jelly's nicer.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9892] There you are.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9893] Jelly jelly jelly.
Tim (PS088)                          [9894] Because look, see that in there?
Christopher (PS089)                  [9895] Right now
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9896] Well it's quite nice that is
                                     there's sultanas in it.
                                     [9897] ... Oh, what are you gonna do,
                                     jacket potato or chips?
Christopher (PS089)                  [9898] I ... you don't usually have that
                                     and that do you?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9899] Er ... dunno really, it varies. ...

Christopher (PS089)                  [9900] No, no chips.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9901] You're gonna leave the chips are
                                     you?
Christopher (PS089)                  [9902] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9903] Keep the jacket potato.
                                     [9904] Right Tim, are you having those
                                     chips?
                                     [9905] You need some chips.
                                     [9906] ... Oh well, boiled potatoes,
                                     they'll do.
Christopher (PS089)                  [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [9907] Chips. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9908] Right, let's have a nice drink
                                     please.
                                     [9909] Oh dear.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9910] Ugh, a horrible.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9911] Tadpoles in the drink.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9912] Tadpoles?
                                     [9913] Oh they don't look like tadpoles.
                                     [9914] No, no that's a broken one.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9915] Mhm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9916] I don't think I'll have ... I like
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9917] You can have it look Tim and you've
                                     won.
                                     [9918] ... Oh that was a silly thing to
                                     do.
Tim (PS088)                          [9919] I want that horrible [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9920] No no that's silly.
                                     [9921] That's not the rules of the game.
                                     [9922] You can't do that.
                                     [9923] You can only swap it for nice
                                     things.
Tim (PS088)                          [9924] I want this one.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9925] No.
                                     [9926] ... Sausages!
                                     [9927] Ooh I'll have that instead of
                                     those.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9928] [laugh] ... I think I'll have ...
                                     no I'm going to keep that
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9929] Hold on Tim.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9930] instead cos I don't want [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9931] Right Tim.
                                     [9932] Put that down.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9933] No.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9934] That's yours.
                                     [9935] You don't want that cos you've
                                     already got a nice one haven't you?
                                     [9936] Come on I want a nice drink please.
                                     [9937] Oh beans.
                                     [9938] Oh I'll have sausage and beans.
                                     [9939] ... Makes a change.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9940] Yeah sausage and beans is very
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9941] There you go, do you want some
                                     peas.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9942] Ah yes.
                                     [9943] ... I've won.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9944] Just right.
                                     [9945] You've won.
                                     [9946] Again.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9947] Again. [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [9948] And you [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9949] Well you could have won but you
                                     were daft and didn't take the right card.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9950] No. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9951] Oh you've won now.
                                     [9952] You're second.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9953] [laugh] Now mummy's
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9954] Let's see how long it takes for
                                     mummy.
Tim (PS088)                          [9955] I'm gonna give this.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9956] Well you want that don't you?
Tim (PS088)                          [9957] I I don't need a biscuit.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9958] Mm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9959] Mm.
                                     [9960] [laugh] Now.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9961] Oop another horrid drink.
                                     [9962] Come on, there must be a nice drink
                                     in there somewhere.
                                     [9963] There it is.
                                     [9964] A nice drink of water.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9965] So mummy was last.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9966] As ever.
Tim (PS088)                          [9967] I don't want that pudding.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9968] Don't you?
                                     [9969] There aren't many other nice
                                     puddings.
                                     [9970] You'll have to have that baking
                                     apple then with the sultana in it. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [9971] Ah.
                                     [9972] Have a horrible pudding.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9973] Ah!
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [9974] That's the one you had with
                                     tadpoles in it.
                                     [9975] Mum, do you like tadpoles?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9976] Oh I like tadpoles but not in my
                                     drink.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9977] [laugh] Did you have to have this
                                     one?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9978] I did.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9979] Why did you have to have it?
Tim (PS088)                          [9980] I I had this one.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9981] It was the first one I picked up.
                                     [9982] If it's the first one you pick up
                                     you've got to have it.
Tim (PS088)                          [9983] I I had this one.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9984] Well why can't you put it back?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9985] Well I did in the end.
                                     [9986] I put it back instead of a milky
                                     drink or something.
Christopher (PS089)                  [9987] But why do you have to keep it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9988] You have to keep the horrible thing
                                     if you haven't got anything else in the
                                     space.
                                     [9989] That's the rule of the game.
                                     [9990] Otherwise there's no game is there?

Group of unknown speakers (KBWPSUGP) [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [9997] Not necessarily in the game, just
                                     anywhere.
                                     [9998] What's your very favourite food?
                                     [9999] ... Nothing, not listening to me.
Christopher (PS089)                  [10000] Oh that's nice.
                                     [10001] Mm.
                                     [10002] I like this mum.
                                     [10003] And
Tim (PS088)                          [10004] Chips and horrible pudding.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [10005] I really need some chips.
                                     [10006] Yes.
                                     [10007] I need some, oh yes
Tim (PS088)                          [10008] [...] I want ... I need some
Christopher (PS089)                  [10009] I'll have some sausages.
                                     [10010] Sausages where are you?
                                     [10011] Come here.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [10012] Well I had sausages [...] .

                                     [10017] Think I'll have a jelly for

Christopher (PS089)                  [10065] I didn't drop him.
                                     [10066] I was putting him down.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [10067] [laughing] Well you'll have to put

Dorothy (PS087)                      [10077] A fly?
Tim (PS088)                          [10078] I've just seen one but
Dorothy (PS087)                      [10079] Well I wouldn't worry if it's out
                                     there.
                                     [10080] It'll go to the light.
                                     [10081] Flies always like the light.
                                     [10082] So it'll be flying round the light
                                     so it's no trouble to you.
Tim (PS088)                          [10083] Why do they always like light?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [10084] He won't come in here.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [10087] No.

                                     light do flies, so it's no trouble.
Tim (PS088)                          [10089] Why don't they go and fly near the
                                     dark?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [10090] I don't know, but they just don't.
                                     [10091] Come on, lie down.
                                     [10092] I think there's somebody else at

Dorothy (PS087)                      [10120] I didn't know it was Dawn coming
                                     at the door.
                                     [10121] I thought it was a stranger.
                                     [10122] I just heard somebody knocking
                                     instead of ringing the bell.
                                     [10123] And I thought somebody's at the
                                     door.
Christopher (PS089)                  [10124] And you thought it was ... Dawn?

                                     down here and there's the cup.
                                     [10135] Right?
Christopher (PS089)                  [10136] Do I have to keep getting down?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [10137] Yes.
                                     [10138] Unless you can lean over without
                                     falling out of bed. ...

                                     her?
                                     [10158] I'm impressed I must say.
Dawn (PS0XK)                         [10159] Yeah.
                                     [10160] And so as soon as she mentioned
                                     clairvoyants ... that was it.
                                     [10161] I turned me back, I walked out.
                                     [10162] And I'd got all me bits, different
                                     books out preparing for the crucifixion.
                                     [10163] And I'd got the Know me God
                                     Personally cos the words really stand out
                                     on that little green book.
                                     [10164] And I made sure it was where it
                                     couldn't be missed soon as she brought her
                                     cup out to the kitchen.

Dawn (PS0XK)                         [10165] And the next time she mentioned it

Jane (PS0XJ)    [10301] Yes it was a bit.

                soon.
Dawn (PS0XK)    [10314] Not to worry.
Dorothy (PS087) [10315] What with one thing and another.
                [10316] So far we've not been ... it's not been like this has
                it?
Dawn (PS0XK)    [10317] No.
Dorothy (PS087) [10318] Until today.
                [10319] So that's pretty good going.

Dawn (PS0XK)    [...]
Dorothy (PS087) [10325] Again.
Dawn (PS0XK)    [10326] Again.
Dorothy (PS087) [10327] I just want to check your fingers.
                [10328] [laugh] As I wasn't watching first time round.
                [10329] And this time instead of speeding it up so we're ...
                whooshing off like a [laughing] like a bee ... okay [] .
Dawn (PS0XK)    [10330] I thought we were going on a bit.
                [10331] Going [...] .
                [10332] We'll go a bit slower shall we?
Dorothy (PS087) [10333] We'll go a little, trifle slower but rather than no
                it's not so much a trifle slower as ... steadily.
                [10334] If we're gonna set off fast then we carry on fast.
Dawn (PS0XK)    [10335] Fast.
                [10336] If you're gonna start slow stay ... [...] .
                [10337] Right.
Dorothy (PS087) [10338] But also there's a word here and it says
Dawn (PS0XK)    [10339] [whispering] Ooh lightly [] .
Dorothy (PS087) [10340] lightly.
                [10341] That means do not thump on the piano.
                [10342] [laughing] Right? []
                [10343] Butterfly, okay.
Dawn (PS0XK)    [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087) [10344] Just let me switch this thing off cos they don't want
                to hear our piano lesson do they?
Dawn (PS0XK)    [10345] Oh no, I don't think so.
Dorothy (PS087) [10346] And I don't think we want

Dawn (PS0XK)    [10380] Don't blame him for washing it himself or the fairies
                will never come.
Dorothy (PS087) [10381] I know, well they did.

                                     [11309] Just leave it and come and sit on
                                     your seat.
Tim (PS088)                          [11310] Ooh. ...
Group of unknown speakers (KBWPSUGP) [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11311] Come on.
                                     [11312] Sit in on your seat.
                                     [11313] ... You do need your seatbelt on.
                                     [11314] Put it on please.
                                     [11315] I know it's not very far, but even
                                     so.
                                     [11316] ... If we have an accident you'll
                                     need it.
                                     [11317] ... [...] bump into another car.
Tim (PS088)                          [11318] [...] put my stick in the porch.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11319] You've put your stick in the
                                     porch?
                                     [11320] Right, that's okay.
Tim (PS088)                          [11321] I've forgotten it.
Christopher (PS089)                  [11322] Mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11323] It's still there isn't it?
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [11324] Why do you [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11325] It doesn't matter.
                                     [11326] Don't worry, just leave it there.
                                     [11327] Have you got yours in?
                                     [11328] Is your seatbelt on?
Christopher (PS089)                  [11329] No.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11330] You'd best put it on quickly.
                                     [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [11331] Mum [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11332] Well in the garage it's a little
                                     bit different because ... there's only the
                                     garage to hit isn't there?
                                     [11333] ... So if you hit the garage
                                     you're going very very slowly and you
                                     might just give yourself a jolt but you
                                     wouldn't hurt yourself quite so much. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [11334] Mum what's the noise?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11335] What's what noise?
Christopher (PS089)                  [11336] That noise. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11337] The car.
Tim (PS088)                          [11338] Car.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11339] It's cos you're travelling in a
                                     Metro.
                                     [11340] You're used to travelling in a
                                     Rover.
                                     [11341] ... [laugh] You're used to
                                     travelling in a Rover.
                                     [11342] This one's all shaky.
                                     [11343] It's so old.
                                     [11344] ... But it does the job.
                                     [11345] Gets us there.
Christopher (PS089)                  [11346] [...] too old.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11347] Ah hey. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [11348] [...] too old.
                                     [11349] Think it's got too old.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11350] No it's fine.
                                     [11351] ... There we are, there's Mark's
                                     house.
                                     [11352] ... Right.
                                     [11353] Now have you got all your things
                                     Christopher that you need?
                                     [11354] ... You stay there Tim.
                                     [11355] Don't go undoing things. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [11356] I want to go in Christopher's
                                     seat.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11357] No you just stay there cos you can
                                     get on Christopher's seat when we come
                                     home cos he won't be here.
                                     [11358] Come on.
                                     [11359] ... Can you shut the door.
                                     [11360] ... Shut the door.
                                     [11361] ... Sounds like [...] in the
                                     bedroom up there. ...
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [11362] Sorry [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11363] Ha thank you very much Mark. ...
                                     [door knock]
Yvonne (PS0XL)                       [11364] Come in.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11365] Thank you so much.
Yvonne (PS0XL)                       [11366] Don't be silly.
                                     [11367] Stop it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11368] Sounds as though you're lively
                                     this morning.
Yvonne (PS0XL)                       [11369] Aah!
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11370] I think he's alright. [laugh]
Yvonne (PS0XL)                       [11371] Are you better?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11372] He was sick on Sunday.
                                     [11373] By the time yesterday came round,
                                     by lunchtime he could have come really but
                                     ... [laugh] .
                                     [11374] You never quite know do you, how
                                     they're gonna [...]
Yvonne (PS0XL)                       [11375] Oh no, no
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11376] He's gonna go swimming anyway so
                                     that'll put him back if [...]
Yvonne (PS0XL)                       [11377] [laughing] Yeah [] .
                                     [11378] Okay.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11379] Bye.
Yvonne (PS0XL)                       [11380] Ta ta. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [11381] Christopher hasn't shut the door.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11382] Has he not shut the door?
                                     [11383] Perhaps he's going to wave to us.
                                     [11384] ... No I think they have shut the
                                     door, haven't they?
Tim (PS088)                          [11385] They haven't.
                                     [11386] ... They haven't.
                                     [11387] They haven't. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11388] We'll go to Tesco's today.
                                     [11389] I want to get some petrol. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [11390] Yeah. ... [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11391] Mm.
                                     [11392] ... I wonder what you'll do at
                                     nursery today.
Tim (PS088)                          [11393] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11394] I wonder what you will do at
                                     nursery today.
Tim (PS088)                          [11395] Hope it's still games.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11396] Games?
                                     [11397] There'll be some games there.
                                     [11398] What's your favourite game?
Tim (PS088)                          [11399] Postman Pat.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11400] Postman Pat snap? [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [11401] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11402] You haven't played that for a bit
                                     have you? ...
Tim (PS088)                          [11403] Where's it gone?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11404] It'll be in the drawers I expect.
                                     [11405] You can always go and get them
                                     out, if you want to.
Tim (PS088)                          [11406] Where's it gone?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11407] It'll be in the drawer.
Tim (PS088)                          [11408] Well where's it gone in the
                                     drawer?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11409] Well I don't know.
                                     [11410] Have you looked for it?
Tim (PS088)                          [11411] No.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11412] Well if you go and look for it I
                                     expect you'll find it.
                                     [11413] ... Do you think it'll be sand or
                                     water today?
Tim (PS088)                          [11414] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11415] Do you think it will be sand or
                                     water today?
Tim (PS088)                          [11416] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11417] Do you think there'll be sand ...
                                     or water ... today?
Tim (PS088)                          [11418] Think it will be sand.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11419] You think it'll be sand.
                                     [11420] Why do you think it's sand today?
                                     [11421] ... It was water last week wasn't
                                     it?
                                     [11422] So it probably will be sand this
                                     week I would think. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [11423] Yeah I think it will be sand.
                                     [11424] ... Cos the water [...] soaking
                                     wet.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11425] No, you won't get soaking wet with
                                     sand.
                                     [11426] Hopefully. [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [11427] Cos with sand you don't get
                                     soaking [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11428] No.
Tim (PS088)                          [11429] We put water in our sand.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11430] Do you?
                                     [11431] ... What, so that it sticks
                                     together then it makes things?
Tim (PS088)                          [11432] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11433] Mm.
                                     [11434] If it's dry it sort of won't stick
                                     together will it?
                                     [11435] It won't make things.
                                     [11436] ... Mind you it's nice for
                                     pouring. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [11437] You don't have to have sand but
                                     it's rather nice. ...

                 [11628] The Jolly Farmer?
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11629] Oh.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11630] And wait in the car park down there.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11631] Oh.
                 [11632] Round that [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [11633] Cos that'll save me five minutes.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11634] I can't remember which way I go.
                 [11635] Do I turn left?
Dorothy (PS087)  [11636] Well, you know when you get up the top ... you come
                 out the school gates
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11637] Turn right.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11638] and you turn right.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11639] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11640] And then instead of turning left down towards where we
                 park the car,
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11641] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11642] keep going.
                 [11643] Straight on.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11644] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11645] There's a path goes down a slope.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11646] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11647] You follow your nose down to the bottom of there.
                 [11648] Then you turn,
Marjorie (PS0XR) [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [11649] well you just follow the path.
                 [11650] It turns right ... and into the car park.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11651] Oh so we follow the path and don't go over that bridge
                 over the road?
Dorothy (PS087)  [11652] No.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11653] Don't go towards that, just keep on the path ...
                 towards the Jolly Farmer?
                 [11654] I've been round there but
Dorothy (PS087)  [11655] Yeah?
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11656] I've forgotten it [...] .

Dorothy (PS087)  [11660] Well I should think so. [laugh]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087)  [11661] I don't think the Jolly Farmer does meals.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11662] [cough] No.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11663] But I thought if you do that then I can turn in that
                 car park
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11664] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11665] at the Jolly Farmer.

Dorothy (PS087)  [11670] And it'll just save us a few minutes because it'll be
                 ... tight squeeze I expect.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11671] It will if we're not quick because erm
Dorothy (PS087)  [11672] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11673] we don't want to rush them eating it do we?
Dorothy (PS087)  [11674] Oh no.

                 from usual and ... and er delays here and do you know what it
                 was?

Marjorie (PS0XR) [11854] [...] and it sounded as though it was on the railway
                 but it wasn't the railway it was a big factory at the side.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11855] Mm.

Marjorie (PS0XR) [11858] And they're going to lay some coaches on.
                 [11859] Because this train is going to avoid Banbury.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11860] Mm.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11861] To get to wherever it was going.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11862] Mm.

                 when we do and you'll be alright.

                 he's gone to but it's nearly finished, altering it.
                 [11993] And and in a sense it's been a blessing in disguise.
Dorothy (PS087)  [11994] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [11995] Because you go in and they've got this new entrance
                 hall.

                 school.
                 [11998] And then you go into
Dorothy (PS087)  [11999] They had a fire at Saint Leonards and they've been
                 saying that really it's been a good thing.
                 [12000] Cos they've had to rethink what they want.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12001] What's ... where yes.

Marjorie (PS0XR) [12007] Yes, yeah but when it gets burnt down you, I mean they
                 can't [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [12008] [laughing] There's no preservation [...] [] .
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12009] So and er we got there fairly early, cos the taxi well
                 the taxi man got lost, that's another story.
                 [12010] The taxi man got lost in Manchester.
                 [12011] Anyway we got, we got there in time
Dorothy (PS087)  [12012] Oh no wonder he wanted you to set off early.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12013] Eh?
Dorothy (PS087)  [12014] No wonder he wanted you to set off early, he didn't
                 know where he was going.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12015] [...] anyway we had a nice trip up past [...] and back
                 through Prestwich and all round.
                 [12016] Till we found out that and he said oh I know where I
                 am now.

Marjorie (PS0XR) [12019] No, he took some off.
                 [12020] Fortunately.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12021] Oh that was nice.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12022] He said ooh he said it was my fault.
                 [12023] So he took [...] anyway ... er ... [...] I'm getting
                 mixed up with me stories I think.
                 [12024] ... And at this church ... we got there early and the
                 [...] soon as we walked in there the, the church warden says
                 ... toilets are there.
                 [12025] Thanks very much we said.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12026] [laugh] You must have looked the type.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12027] So we we [...] .
                 [12028] You know we said where we'd come from, that sort of.
                 [12029] So they let us look all round, they said [...] .
                 [12030] So we did you see.
                 [12031] Because er ... it's marvellous what they've been able
                 to do.
                 [12032] It's not quite finished.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12033] I expect it was packed was it?
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12034] It was full [...] .
                 [12035] And er the thing was, we found out afterwards why
                 they'd done it.
                 [12036] The organ pipes are in the middle of the chancel and
                 you couldn't see the east window at the [...] .
Dorothy (PS087)  [12037] No.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12038] Oh well they said that's because they'd not got that
                 section finished
Dorothy (PS087)  [laugh]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12039] and [...] .
                 [12040] But the old gargoyles off the church were saved and
                 they've stuck them up all over the ... on the erm dividing
                 piece between the church and this new ... er ... section.
                 [12041] They've got a lovely new kitchen [...] .
                 [12042] Very nice.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12043] I bet [...]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12044] Oh yes they said.
                 [12045] But we've had a very very ... well we've still got him
                 ... a good ... treasurer.
                 [12046] Who knew what to do and instead of
Dorothy (PS087)  [12047] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12048] instead of saying, telling the er insurance people
                 that they'd give them the bills and they could pay them as
                 they came in, he said they'd got a lump sum.
                 [12049] ... And he's been able to invest it
Dorothy (PS087)  [12050] Mm.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12051] himself.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12052] Mm.
                 [12053] Mm.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12054] And he wanted, he was a man that knew what he was
                 doing.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12055] Knew where to get extra
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12056] Get extra money.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12057] interest.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12058] And he said er ... he's paid, he's paid for
                 everything.
                 [12059] Just a little bit more money they wanted then he
                 shoots off home.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12060] I'm sure, you know, with Alan and this new building,
                 he's been very good.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12061] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12062] Because he's known the right people.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12063] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12064] And when things have turned up and they've not been
                 quite right he's known ...
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12065] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12066] There's something sort of practical about him.
                 [12067] You know the ...
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12068] Yeah that's what he, they said he's been marvellous,
                 this treasurer.
                 [12069] They said we wouldn't have got
Dorothy (PS087)  [12070] No.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12071] but they've gotta let him.
                 [12072] You see.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12073] Mm.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12074] But he, he said to the insurance people no I don't
                 want you just to keep on paying the bills.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12075] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12076] He said we'll have a lump sum.
                 [12077] And he got the lump sum and they was investing it and
                 just drawing out when he ... needed it.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12078] That's it. ...
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12079] Course it was very nice and we got a proper dinner ...
                 at this erm ... mind you we were absolutely famished by the
                 time we got there.

Marjorie (PS0XR) [12095] It took him three quarters of an hour to get us there.
                 [12096] So anyway we'd had a good look round and this ch
                 church warden said hey ... you'd better go and get some seats
                 cos it's going to get [...] .

                 said and you'll see everything.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12098] Yeah. [...]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12099] Cos they only booked seats for the immediate family.
                 [12100] So we sat on this row and it was ... Paul and his
                 young lady and David ... all in the row with us.

Dorothy (PS087)  [12110] Yeah.
                 [12111] Just pleased you'd got that extra space.
                 [12112] You're not worrying about rushing off.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12113] Well I would have been rushing off.
                 [12114] Anyway it wouldn't have been fair to Irene really
                 [...] cos we went [...] Sunday afternoon. [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [12115] Well you've got nothing to rush off t for have you
                 really?

Dorothy (PS087)  [12118] Yeah.
                 [12119] ... Have they found out any more about ... how it
                 started?
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12120] Absolute shell.
                 [12121] I don't know, they've, no well they're investigating
                 aren't they?
                 [12122] It's a shame.
                 [12123] [...] you know, you know what it looked like.
                 [12124] But he had made a mess of it.
                 [12125] Are you taking me to the er
Dorothy (PS087)  [12126] I'm taking you to the Jolly Farmers.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12127] Oh, are you?
Dorothy (PS087)  [12128] Which will give you just about the right amount of
                 time then to walk up.
                 [12129] ... You'll have a nice walk ready for your lunch.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12130] Thank you very much.
                 [12131] I've already had a walk this morning.
                 [12132] I went out, there was nobody in the queue for the ...
                 I said what's the matter?
                 [12133] She said I don't know, it's a quiet morning.
                 [12134] Well she said quiet time of the year this a bit.
                 [12135] Oh I said there's none ... they're all queuing for
                 papers and cigarettes.
                 [12136] Nobody at the counter for the ... post office.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12137] Okay now, if you go on th this path ... whoops it's
                 gone.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12138] Eh?
Dorothy (PS087)  [12139] It'll be underneath the floor.
                 [12140] Wait a minute.
                 [12141] ... Good job I brought you. ...
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12142] Where's the path gone?
Dorothy (PS087)  [12143] Well it's under the floor.
                 [12144] I mean it's erm ... you go, the underpass is there you
                 see.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12145] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12146] Can you see the grass there?
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12147] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12148] If you walk straight across that bit of grass there
                 you'll come to the ... path.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12149] I don't have to go on the underpass do I?
Dorothy (PS087)  [12150] Well there's no point really cos you have to go
                 backwards and go under the underpass and then up there you
                 see.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12151] So I'm going left aren't I?
Dorothy (PS087)  [12152] You're going, yeah.
                 [12153] Well the underpass takes you left if you see what I
                 mean.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12154] Yeah we're not going back to the underpass do
Dorothy (PS087)  [12155] But you don't, no.
                 [12156] You want to go u ... you see where that big tree is
                 there?
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12157] Yeah.
                 [12158] So
Dorothy (PS087)  [12159] You want to go across the grass and you'll hit a path
                 which goes left up there, past those houses.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12160] I think I've done it once before.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12161] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12162] When I used to wander round with erm
Dorothy (PS087)  [12163] Oh.
                 [12164] Just that [...]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12165] Oh sorry.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12166] No it's alright, go on.
                 [12167] You walk up towards it and [...] ... when I see you
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12168] And I'll come back ... tell me
Dorothy (PS087)  [12169] disappearing round the path.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [12170] Yes right.
Dorothy (PS087)  [12171] You'll see the path across there.

Dorothy (PS087) [12172] Can I tell you what we're going to do, cos we're gonna
                do something nice.

                Christopher from, from school.

                school ... for the afternoon.

Tim (PS088)     [12184] Why?
Dorothy (PS087) [12185] and then we go back home with grandma.
Tim (PS088)     [12186] Why?
Dorothy (PS087) [12187] Because today Christopher's not having his lunch at
                school.
                [12188] He's gonna have it with us instead.
                [12189] But he still has to go back and work ... in the
                afternoon.

                [12191] ... Who?
Dorothy (PS087) [12192] Who?
                [12193] What do you mean, who?
                [12194] Christopher has to go back to work this afternoon. ...
Tim (PS088)     [12195] Why?
Dorothy (PS087) [12196] Because it's school time.
                [12197] It's school time till three o'clock. ...

Dorothy (PS087) [12199] I'm going a different way aren't I?
Tim (PS088)     [12200] Supposed to be going the right way.
Dorothy (PS087) [12201] Don't worry we'll get there.
                [12202] It's just a different way home, that's all.
                [12203] ... Cos there's lots of different ways from the
                nursery.
                [12204] ... Going to pass the water tower. ...
Tim (PS088)     [12205] We haven't.
                [12206] ... We haven't.
Dorothy (PS087) [12207] We haven't what?
Tim (PS088)     [12208] Passed the water tower.
Dorothy (PS087) [12209] It's there.
Tim (PS088)     [12210] Water tower.
Dorothy (PS087) [12211] That's it.
Tim (PS088)     [12212] [crying] We ... we didn't go past the water tower [] .
Dorothy (PS087) [12213] Ooh.
                [12214] What's the matter with you?
                [12215] You're all stroppy.
*** 36 (Tape 022608) ***
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12216] Did James put sand in your eye?
                                     [12217] Oh dear.
                                     [12218] Was that an accident?
                                     [12219] ... You're always getting sand in
                                     your eye aren't you?
                                     [12220] ... I think you must rub your
                                     hands in your eyes or something.
Tim (PS088)                          [12221] I did.
                                     [12222] And it didn't come out properly.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12223] No.
                                     [12224] Did Lily help you?
Tim (PS088)                          [12225] No.

Tim (PS088)                          [12232] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12233] Is it still in your eye now?
Tim (PS088)                          [12234] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12235] Oh dear.
                                     [12236] If you blink a lot that helps to
                                     wash it out.
Tim (PS088)                          [12237] No.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [12240] Well it's a bit tricky to put
                                     water in your eye.
                                     [12241] Just blink a lot cos that helps.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [12244] that washes your eye anyway.
                                     [12245] Here they are look. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [12246] Oh ... we go past them.

Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12250] Are you going to go round?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12251] Be quick.
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12252] Eh?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12253] Who's gonna go round?
                                     [12254] He can climb through the middle.
                                     [12255] Have you had a good morning?
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12256] Erm we discovered we could have
                                     come through this road here
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12257] Oh.
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12258] instead of going on that grass.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12259] That would have been quicker would
                                     it?
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12260] I think, yes we're going to have
                                     to go back that way [...] .
                                     [12261] It depends which way you're
                                     coming. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12262] Have you had a good morning sir?
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12263] That was quite quick.
                                     [12264] I was there before it ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12265] It is, it's not very far.
                                     [12266] Did you have to wait for ages?
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12267] No.
                                     [12268] I had a good look and some of his
                                     class came to wave to me.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12269] Oh [laugh] .
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12270] Isn't it amazing how they know

Christopher (PS089)                  [12282] I don't know who it was.
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [12283] No but somebody came ... behind us
                                     didn't they?
                                     [12284] Cos they'd brought a little dog to

                                     [12344] We could have one of those.

                                     to the toilet before we go into the cafe.

                                     [12356] It was a bit cheating.

                                     that's what I want my kids to go through
                                     as well, you know, somebody who's gonna do
                                     their best
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12935] because it rubs off on them
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12936] mm
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12937] it's, it's everybody around them
                                     got to try hard
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12938] that's right , that's right
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12939] you know the stuff I mean they
                                     will
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12940] yeah
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12941] know that's there expect
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12942] that's right and you know that if
                                     the staff has put theirselves out to make
                                     a decent crash in their environment
                                     they're gonna go mad at the children if
                                     they muck it up, so therefore, you know,
                                     you're gonna have that
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [...]

Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12944] I think that one of the ... things

                                     keeping, it's very bad
Dorothy (PS087)                      [12945] mm
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12946] I mean they stroll in at quarter
                                     to nine and I think

Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12948] I think that

                                     that it's not fair for the
Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [12952] I think [...] the day you get

Tim (PS088)         [14313] Mummy
Andrew (PS08A)      [14314] So we're gonna get the original magazine or have
                    you already got it?
Marjorie (PS0XR)    [14315] You can buy it yes
Dorothy (PS087)     [14316] Well I, I think they will give it to us, cos er,
                    Martin what's his name said that we'd get complimentary
                    copies, yeah you mustn't touch those Tim cos those are
                    matches and children never, never touch matches do they?
Tim (PS088)         [14317] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)     [14318] Because if they suddenly catch fire guess what
                    would happen?
Marjorie (PS0XR)    [14319] We shall lose him
Andrew (PS08A)      [14320] All the house will be burnt down
Dorothy (PS087)     [14321] And you as well
Andrew (PS08A)      [14322] and be very, very sad
Dorothy (PS087)     [14323] and you'd get very sad and it would hurt a lot.
Tim (PS088)         [14324] All day
Andrew (PS08A)      [14325] Yes
Dorothy (PS087)     [14326] Mm ...
Tim (PS088)         [14327] And all of us wanna be burnt
Dorothy (PS087)     [14328] Yes
Andrew (PS08A)      [14329] Yes all of us could get burnt
Dorothy (PS087)     [14330] and all our things
Andrew (PS08A)      [14331] and your guitar, everything
Tim (PS088)         [14332] But even if we ran out [...]
Dorothy (PS087)     [14333] Well we [...] but the house wouldn't would it?
Marjorie (PS0XR)    [14334] It would be sad if we lost everything wouldn't it?
                    ...
Andrew (PS08A)      [14335] So you won't play with matches?
Tim (PS088)         [14336] If you get a match and you strike it on something
                    else it would still
Dorothy (PS087)     [14337] Yes, it can do
Marjorie (PS0XR)    [...]
Tim (PS088)         [14338] And we get out all the way
Christopher (PS089) [14339] [...] even the box if you strike it on that, that
                    will
Dorothy (PS087)     [14340] But it strikes on particular things, it strikes on
                    something rough, but you never quite know, know what, not,
                    no good trying it out because you never quite know whether
                    it's going to strike or not, when you get to be older,
                    we'll allow you to strike a match, but you have to be quite
                    older to do that
Christopher (PS089) [14341] Mummy
Dorothy (PS087)     [14342] we'll show you how it works ...
Marjorie (PS0XR)    [14343] It's best to know isn't it?

Christopher (PS089) [14927] I can do it, how can you tell the difference?
Dorothy (PS087)     [14928] Well there's two different wholes aren't there?
                    [...] chop toast [...] you can chop either that way or that
                    way ...
Christopher (PS089) [14929] The one with you chop the chop and then there will

Dorothy (PS087)     [14930] That's right, there will be four then, four bits,
                    life is so complicated.
Christopher (PS089) [14931] Mum, but it's tricky [...] because when, when you
                    chop that way, and then that way ... chop it that way it's
                    all

                    thing and there's Rice Krispies everywhere, [...]

                 more you look at [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [15271] It's a luxury though, I mean you know, you don't need
                 it, the fact that we got one for Christmas it was very nice,
                 but
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15272] Well I was only thinking that there's not much on the
                 television so
Dorothy (PS087)  [15273] No, and so, but you can choose what you want to use,
                 to watch the video I mean I find it particularly good with
                 children, we'd

                 [15287] No.
Dorothy (PS087)  [15288] This little friend?
                 [15289] No, he kept waking up constantly, you, didn't you?
                 [15290] You kept shouting for mummy or daddy or somebody
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15291] What you keep waking up for?

Dorothy (PS087)  [15293] You're a silly [...]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15294] You go to bed to sleep
Tim (PS088)      [15295] I waked up [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [15296] He seemed to be awake for a long time, I think, you
                 know like you wake up and you don't know what to do with
                 yourself, I think it was like that, so every quarter of an
                 hour or so he kept me, shouting for a drink he didn't know
                 quite what to do with himself ...
Tim (PS088)      [15297] Yeah.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15298] Your mother used to sleep like a log
Tim (PS088)      [...]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15299] and she still [...]
Tim (PS088)      [15300] [...] that ...
Dorothy (PS087)  [15301] Oh that's a very nice letter, I was just thinking that
                 maybe erm Jill hasn't got her birthday card cos she's the type
                 of person who would write and say thank you, you know to me
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15302] She has got your address?
Dorothy (PS087)  [15303] She has got it and it was a lengthy letter so, but I
                 thought it would be included in my birthday present
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15304] Oh no
Dorothy (PS087)  [15305] but she's not, she's done it separate, in fact I think
                 that second class stamp
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15306] Has she got gone going to school?
Dorothy (PS087)  [15307] Oh yeah

                 you can leave and then you can leave after that if you prefer
Tim (PS088)      [...]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15320] [...] give you a date and that was it.
Dorothy (PS087)  [15321] Right ...
Tim (PS088)      [15322] Still got it
Dorothy (PS087)  [15323] I was lucky, cos I had the summer holidays
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15324] Right
Dorothy (PS087)  [15325] included in mine, so it meant that they paid me for
                 the summer holidays cos I didn't officially really
Tim (PS088)      [15326] No
Dorothy (PS087)  [15327] I hadn't officially stopped work till the first of
                 September.
Tim (PS088)      [15328] Catch, catch

Tim (PS088)      [15339] [...] , see I've got it.
Dorothy (PS087)  [15340] That's because [yawning] I didn't have time to sit and
                 colour with him [] so he decided he'd do it all blue himself
                 didn't you?

Marjorie (PS0XR) [15366] He's not really not really mentioned it
Dorothy (PS087)  [15367] Mm, I think they have a system whereby they have it in
                 the classroom for a week
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15368] And then somebody else has it
Dorothy (PS087)  [15369] and then somebody else has it, so it's sort of once a
                 month or something it turns up and they have sort of an
                 extensive thing on it, I think that's the way it works.

                 desperate, everybody rings me when I'm [...] [laugh]
Marjorie (PS0XR) [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087)  [15571] well I don't want too much, see what I mean
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15572] Mm
Dorothy (PS087)  [15573] having told them to stay at home with Tim, I don't
                 want to be
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15574] it's not fair to him, I mean when he's old enough to
                 understand
Dorothy (PS087)  [15575] Well it's quite fun just going off for the odd day cos
                 then he goes off to see Ian, he enjoys that ... but it was two
                 afternoons last week cos I did Thursday afternoon and Friday
                 afternoon
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15576] It's not bad really normally
Dorothy (PS087)  [15577] I've a , well she's dumped hers on me
Marjorie (PS0XR) [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [15578] I mean she's got two children to dump on me so, I
                 don't feel bad about that ... in, that we know, we decided
                 that's what we, we didn't mind doing and there no trouble, if
                 fact they're less trouble cos they're together than they are
Tim (PS088)      [15579] You going to go teaching?
Dorothy (PS087)  [15580] no, we're just talking about when I did last week ...
                 remember when I went teaching last week and you went to Ian's
                 house didn't you?
                 [15581] Went in two afternoons
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15582] Has Martin got chickenpox then?
Dorothy (PS087)  [15583] Yeah ... anyhow I think she's hoping to come to [...]
                 tomorrow ... cos erm, idea in the air that on Maundy Thursday
                 instead of having an ordinary mums and toddlers we'll have a
                 [...] in church for half an hour and then a run around cups of
                 coffee with the big toys in the hall, [...] a good idea
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15584] Mm
Dorothy (PS087)  [15585] That'll be a nice idea, it's a bit tricky, you
                 remember the Chris [...] what we did at Christmas, that went
                 really well, and we thought perhaps something similar book for
                 Easter, yeah, don't know what we'll do but [...] ... cos
                 people like John and [...] , so he's not teaching full time,
                 in fact some of the schools have holiday aren't they?
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15586] Mm ... that's why I thought you wasn't doing anything
                 on that day, [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [15587] Well she wasn't going to and then the elections got in
                 the way.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15588] Got to, are we having that thing?
Dorothy (PS087)  [15589] Well we still don't know about that, and it said in
                 the paper that they're having election in the church hall,
                 nobody in the church knows about it.
Marjorie (PS0XR) [15590] Mm, can't get it if they don't [...]
Dorothy (PS087)  [15591] So if they don't act, they've had it, but, if they
                 wrote and asked quick then [...]

                                     broad stem and a round head, now Mark what

                                     you could put cork

Dorothy (PS087)                      [15859] then you need to write cork next
                                     to it, draw a picture of it and then write
                                     it.

Unknown speaker (KBWPSUNK)           [15872] Sink

Dorothy (PS087)                      [17503] I think we'll put some of that
                                     away, do you?
Tim (PS088)                          [17504] No.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17505] [...] going to have Weetabix as

Tim (PS088)                          [17506] Yeah.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17507] [...] she'll never manage all
                                     that.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17508] [...] in that case you can't cope
                                     all all that.
                                     [17509] So we'll put some of that in
                                     there.
                                     [17510] ... There you are.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [17521] no.
Tim (PS088)                          [17522] my milk.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17523] Pardon?
Tim (PS088)                          [17524] When I'm drinking
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17525] There isn't any in there yet.
                                     [17526] We're waiting for you to sit down
                                     properly then we'll start giving you
                                     things like milk.
                                     [17527] Cos it starts going all over the

                                     that one?
                                     [17537] ... Please may I have some tea?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17538] Certainly my dear.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17539] Thank you.

Andrew (PS08A)                       [17541] Work work and more work.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17542] Oh.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17543] [...] suppose Julia will be there.

Andrew (PS08A)                       [17546] Don't suppose Julia will be there.
                                     [17547] My boss is getting to the position
                                     where he wants lots of information from
                                     me.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17548] Last night, before I came home ...
                                     he dragged me into his office to ... work
                                     out how much money ... we spend [...]
                                     Pontypool ... delivering parts to
                                     Solihull.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17549] And do you know?
                                     [17550] No, so you had to sit and work it
                                     out.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17551] We had, we had to work it out.
                                     [17552] Yeah.
                                     [17553] I sat with a price list.
                                     [17554] He sat with a calculator.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh] ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17555] He only did that simply because he
                                     gets asked questions.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17556] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17557] Thing I don't approve of is the
                                     fact that ... when I ask questions
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17558] You don't get
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17559] that he needs and he needs to
                                     speak to his boss, he doesn't get answers
                                     from his boss.
                                     [17560] But when his boss chases him for,
                                     you know ... information or whatever you
                                     know [...] . ...

Christopher (PS089)                  [17563] today.

Christopher (PS089)                  [17565] Four sultanas today.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17566] Oh dear. [...] ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17567] There's lots of Alpen in here but
                                     not very many sultanas.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17568] Really?
                                     [17569] They're probably all at the
                                     bottom.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17570] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17571] They are probably all at the
                                     bottom.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17572] [...] ... You say they're always
                                     at the top.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17573] [laugh] ... Actually they do tend
                                     to be, don't they?
                                     [17574] They tend to be at the top and
                                     then there's sort of little bits and
                                     pieces go at the bottom.
                                     [17575] So perhaps you'd had it.
                                     [17576] Perhaps you won't get any sultanas
                                     now.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17577] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17578] Till the end of the Alpen.
                                     [17579] ... I don't know.
                                     [17580] I'm just guessing. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17581] I'm afraid the toast wasn't very
                                     square shaped.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17582] Somebody must have sat on the loaf
                                     or something.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17583] Probably squashed it on the way
                                     home from Tesco's.
Tim (PS088)                          [17584] [...] you squash it.
                                     [17585] Then [...]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17586] Well it did get squashed.
                                     [17587] Did you see?
                                     [17588] What's happened to the loaf?
                                     [17589] Somebody must have sat on it, or
                                     pulled it or ... [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [17590] [...] if you do that

Andrew (PS08A)                       [17592] No.
                                     [17593] You'll find your sandwiches at
                                     work will be a little, your sandwiches at
                                     school will be a little bit squashed.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17594] Well he works.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17595] He works at school.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17596] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17597] Daddy told, said when your
                                     sandwiches are at work. ...
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17598] You know what I meant.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17599] He meant at school.
                                     [17600] But then he said you do work at
                                     school so it's alright.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17601] Course he does.
                                     [17602] Works very hard. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17603] Oh, it's a big fat one, this. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [17604] Be careful ... [shouting] stop.

Andrew (PS08A)                       [17606] [...] And I had to spend a whole
                                     hour in a meeting not not an hour, two and

Andrew (PS08A)                       [17609] To listen to the French to say

                                     [17610] You know
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17611] the French say non.
                                     [17612] Except they didn't quite say non,
                                     one word.
Tim (PS088)                          [17613] And I haven't.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17614] They said it in a round about way
                                     for two and a half hours.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17615] Look at mine.

Andrew (PS08A)                       [17617] We knew they were coming to say
                                     non.
                                     [17618] That's why the meeting had been
                                     arranged.

Andrew (PS08A)                       [17758] He didn't ask for it.
                                     [17759] He just said where is it.
                                     [17760] ... Just say, please can I have
                                     it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17761] [...] say please may I have the
                                     marmalade.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17762] Peas.
Tim (PS088)                          [17763] He didn't.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17764] [laugh] I said peas.
                                     [17765] ... Not please, I didn't say
                                     please.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17766] Oh.
                                     [17767] Well say thank you when you get
                                     it.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17768] Thank you.
                                     [17769] I said
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17770] That's it.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17771] peas ... instead of please.
                                     [17772] I said peas
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17773] Timothy, how did you manage to get
                                     on your knees again?
Tim (PS088)                          [17774] What?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17775] [laugh] Easy.
                                     [17776] Easy-peasy.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17777] He must have got a spring.
                                     [17778] Automatic spring in there.
Tim (PS088)                          [17779] What?
Christopher (PS089)                  [17780] What?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17781] You're supposed to sit down to eat
                                     Tim.
                                     [17782] Remember?
Tim (PS088)                          [17783] I've ... finished.
                                     [17784] There.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17785] Right.
                                     [17786] Thank you. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [...]
Christopher (PS089)                  [17787] Is he sitting down mum?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17788] No he's kneeling up. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [17789] [...] my milk. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17790] [...] ... Yes he is kneeling up.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17791] So, this afternoon
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17792] Mhm.
                                     [17793] When we go to the dentist.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17794] we gather at the dentist at four
                                     o'clock.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17795] [...] [singing] Shall we gather at
                                     the dentist [] .
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17796] You'll get there just before.
                                     [17797] Erm ... will you be able to take
                                     some money?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17798] A chequebook, I'll take.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17799] Right.
                                     [17800] Cos it costs so much now.
                                     [17801] I think they put the rate up
                                     didn't they?
                                     [17802] Recently.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17803] Did they?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17804] Yeah. [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17805] So how much is it now, for
                                     children?
Christopher (PS089)                  [17806] It's Ruth's birthday today.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17807] It is Ruth's birthday today.
                                     [17808] That's very clever.
                                     [17809] How do you know that?
Christopher (PS089)                  [17810] Mm mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17811] He just remembers these things.
                                     ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17812] Mm.
Tim (PS088)                          [17813] It's not your birthday [...]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17814] No, Ruth's.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17815] No not mine.
                                     [17816] Ruth's
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17817] Your cousin.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17818] Cousin Ruth.
                                     [17819] ... Remember Ruth?
                                     [17820] Went to stay with them and [...]
                                     Ruth came to read to you in the morning.
                                     [17821] Oh no, Ann came to read to you in
                                     the mornings didn't she?
                                     [17822] Ruth wasn't with us in the
                                     mornings. [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [17823] Ruth.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17824] Yes, you remember.
                                     [17825] Ruth ... and Ann
Dorothy (PS087)                      [...]
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17826] and Uncle David and Auntie Gwen.
                                     [17827] Do you remember them?
                                     [17828] We went to stay in their house one
                                     weekend.
                                     [17829] ... And we went with them to the
                                     zoo.
                                     [17830] Do you remember?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17831] Oh yes.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17832] Remember going to the zoo?
                                     [17833] We went on a little steam train as
                                     well.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17834] And you and me nearly ... nearly
                                     didn't get on the train.
                                     [17835] Do you remember the train?
                                     [17836] They were all waiting for us.
                                     [17837] ... We had to run quick.
Tim (PS088)                          [17838] Why?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17839] I can't remember what we were
                                     doing.
                                     [17840] Probably weeing up a tree
                                     somewhere.
Group of unknown speakers (KBWPSUGP) [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [17841] [...] because, think the train
                                     nearly went.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17842] Yes.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17843] Everybody else was sitting on the
                                     train.
                                     [17844] We had to run quick to get on it.
Tim (PS088)                          [17845] Because, because the little train
                                     nearly without us.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17846] Mm.
                                     [17847] Did nearly go without us.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17848] If it went without you
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17849] We'd have to catch the next one.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17850] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17851] That's right.
                                     [17852] Cos there's only one train.
                                     [17853] It was going round and round
                                     wasn't it?
Christopher (PS089)                  [17854] Mm. ...
Tim (PS088)                          [17855] We'd have to wait for the next one
                                     then.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17856] Mm.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17857] So are we all being ... examined
                                     today?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17858] We are, this is a family trip.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17859] Right. ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17860] Because [...] said, are the
                                     children coming for a check up too.
Tim (PS088)                          [17861] Well, I have some Marmite.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17862] Cos otherwise it's silly if we go
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17863] Yeah.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17864] and then they go and ... they
                                     never know where they are.
Tim (PS088)                          [17865] Can I have some Marmite on this?
                                     ... [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17866] Are the children supposed to go
                                     every six months?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17867] Something like that.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17868] Well that's okay.
                                     [17869] So it ought to work out twelve and
                                     a six month [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [17870] Mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17871] so that we go every twelve and
                                     they go every six.
Tim (PS088)                          [17872] Can you chop it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17873] But somehow or another it got out
                                     of sequence.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [...]
Tim (PS088)                          [17874] Can you chop No ... chop it.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17875] Oh chop, sorry.
                                     [17876] I'm not listening to you am I?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17877] Presuming that our dentist still
                                     wants to do National Health Service work.
                                     [17878] Cos most of them are threatening
                                     to give up aren't they?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17879] Are they?
Tim (PS088)                          [17880] No.
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17881] Yeah. [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17882] And do what?
                                     [17883] Private?
Tim (PS088)                          [17884] [shouting] Mum ... mum [] .
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17885] Private work.
                                     [17886] Cos they say they don't get paid
                                     enough money for the N H S.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17887] So people like, except the
                                     children you mean?
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17888] No.
                                     [17889] For everybody.
                                     [17890] ... The vast majority of dentists
                                     have threatened to [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17891] Well how come when we're paying so
                                     much?
                                     [17892] Do you want
Andrew (PS08A)                       [17893] Well because you'd have to pay
                                     even more ... if you did it privately.
Tim (PS088)                          [17894] My throat hurts.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17895] Oh I see.
Tim (PS088)                          [...]

Tim (PS088)                          [17898] Yeah. ...

                                     [17904] I can't wear my new shoes this
                                     morning can I?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17905] Why not?
                                     [17906] Oh no you can't cos it's school.
                                     [17907] ... You can wear them when you get
                                     home.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17908] Mm.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17909] And walk to the dentist.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17910] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17911] And walk to the dentist in your
                                     new shoes. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17912] And at the dentists.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17913] Yeah.
                                     [17914] Well you don't take your shoes off
                                     at the dentists.
Christopher (PS089)                  [laugh]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17915] He doesn't look at your feet, he
                                     only looks at your teeth.
                                     [17916] He'll get a shock when he sees
                                     your teeth won't he?
                                     [17917] ... Four of them have changed
                                     since you last came.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17918] Is it today?
                                     [17919] ... Is it today?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17920] Mhm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17921] Oh.
                                     [17922] It feels funny when she ... you do
                                     it.
                                     [17923] Mum.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17924] Yeah. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17925] Is it ... are you going to be
                                     checked?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17926] Yes.
                                     [17927] Mummy and daddy and you two.
                                     [17928] ... We're all going, family trip.
                                     ...
Tim (PS088)                          [17929] And me?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17930] Mhm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17931] At the bed time?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17932] Yes and you.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17933] At bed time? ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17934] No, four o'clock it is.
Tim (PS088)                          [17935] I'm gonna look at my teeth.
Christopher (PS089)                  [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17936] It's a little, it's a little ploy
                                     to get daddy home early. [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [17937] What?
Tim (PS088)                          [17938] [...] gonna look at my teeth?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17939] Daddy'll have to come home a bit
                                     early to have it done.
Tim (PS088)                          [17940] [...] gonna look at my teeth?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17941] Yes.
                                     [17942] Will you let him?
                                     [17943] ... Yes?
                                     [17944] Will you sit on the chair, open
                                     your mouth, let him stick a mirror in?
                                     [17945] Aah.
Tim (PS088)                          [laugh] ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17946] Stick a mirror in?
                                     [17947] ... We don't
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17948] I seem to remember last time you
                                     got two stickers didn't you, cos you had
                                     super clean teeth?
                                     [17949] I bet you only get one sticker
                                     this time.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17950] Why?
Tim (PS088)                          [17951] You think I'm gonna get two?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [laugh]
Christopher (PS089)                  [17952] You'd have to clean them out very
                                     [...] did that.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17953] I think you were a bit lucky to
                                     get two stickers.
                                     [17954] ... I would have thought one
                                     sticker would be sufficient really. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17955] It was when Mrs was there then
                                     wasn't it mummy?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17956] Was it?
Christopher (PS089)                  [17957] Mrs was there.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17958] Mm probably.
                                     [17959] Mm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17960] It was.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17961] Oh you went to school didn't you?
                                     [17962] There was a dentist came to
                                     school, remember?
                                     [17963] ... And we had a letter home
                                     saying something about you need to go to
                                     the local dentist or something for
                                     treatment.
                                     [17964] Poss no possible treatment.
                                     [17965] And I think it was cos of the
                                     wobbly front tooth when ... you bent it
                                     back when you fell over my foot.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17966] But next time it won't
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17967] So we didn't bother going because
                                     we were regularly going anyway.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17968] What? ...
Dorothy (PS087)                      [clears throat]
Christopher (PS089)                  [17969] You didn't bother going cos we
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17970] No.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17971] were regularly going?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17972] Yeah.
                                     [17973] Well I didn't see much point
Christopher (PS089)                  [17974] What does regularly mean?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17975] Regularly means that we go in
                                     anyway t ... every six months you go and
                                     have your teeth checked to see if they're
                                     okay.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17976] Every six
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17977] So just when some ... some bod
                                     comes to school and ... opens your mouth
                                     and says ooh, this looks interesting,
                                     there's not much point because ... our own
                                     dentist knows about it. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17978] So you don't really need to be
                                     checked at school? [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17979] No I wouldn't have thought so.
                                     [17980] But some people don't go to the
                                     dentist regularly, so they need to be
                                     checked at school.
                                     [17981] ... People like Michelle probably
                                     never set eyes on a dentist normally.
                                     [17982] ... It's probably a good thing for
                                     a dentist to have a look at her teeth and
                                     see what needs doing. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17983] Because her mum ... and her mum
                                     doesn't [...] ?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17984] Mm probably. ...
Christopher (PS089)                  [17985] They've never been?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17986] Probably not.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17987] Why?
Tim (PS088)                          [17988] We have.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17989] I'm just guessing.
                                     [17990] We've been, yeah.
                                     [17991] But not everybody does.
                                     [17992] Well not everybody likes dentists
                                     and they think that something
Tim (PS088)                          [17993] Well well we
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17994] awful's gonna happen to them.
                                     [17995] They're wrong
Christopher (PS089)                  [17996] What?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [17997] cos it's nice isn't it, at the
                                     dentist? ... [clears throat] ...
Tim (PS088)                          [17998] Think everyone goes.
Christopher (PS089)                  [17999] To the dentist.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18000] Well everybody ... ought to go to
                                     the dentist if they want to keep their
                                     teeth nice and healthy.
                                     [18001] But not everybody does cos some
                                     people get frightened of dentists and they
                                     think ooh I don't want to go there.
                                     [18002] But that's silly cos there's
                                     nothing to be frightened of is there?
                                     [18003] It's nice at the dentist.
Tim (PS088)                          [18004] No no-one can get frightened.
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18005] Mm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [18006] But they won't get stickers will
                                     they?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18007] True.
Tim (PS088)                          [18008] They won't get stickers dad.
Christopher (PS089)                  [laugh]
Tim (PS088)                          [18009] If they go
Christopher (PS089)                  [18010] [...] got toothbrushes to give you
                                     [...] ... but the [sounds like he's got
                                     his fingers in his mouth] [...] ... [...]
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18011] Mm.
Christopher (PS089)                  [18012] can't see that can you?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18013] No, you can't see that.
                                     [18014] That's why you need a mirror.
Tim (PS088)                          [18015] Could I have one of those [...] ?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18016] Can you have what?
Tim (PS088)                          [18017] Have one of those things.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [18545] Mm.
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [18546] I like it when you come and we

Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [18550] Mm erm ... what was it?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18551] It was called real cheese ...
                                     turned into a spread.
                                     [18552] ... So it's not cream cheese in a
                                     spread.
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [18553] It's ordinary che proper cheese in
                                     a spread?
Dorothy (PS087)                      [18554] Mm.
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [18555] Oh.

Dorothy (PS087)                      [18557] I don't know what they've done to
                                     it to make it spread, but still.
Marjorie (PS0XR)                     [18558] Melted it. [laugh] ...

                                     [19084] Now you need to go round your nose
                                     because that's a real mess there. ...

                                     [19661] Subtract the number you throw from
                                     ten and, that looks fun.
                                     [19662] Yeah that looks our sort of thing
                                     doesn't it?
