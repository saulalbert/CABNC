*STU:	 (        )

*STU:	It's the only thing you wanted really.
*ANN:	Yes.
*STU:	Mm. ((pouring))
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	No   (        ) I'm sure we are   (.) Yes we certainly are dear.
*ANN:	All seems to have happened in such a rush.
*STU:	Well yeah but
*ANN:	There's so much to think about.
*STU:	I know.
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	But we had to really because 
*ANN:	No because we wouldn't have got that fifteen hundred pounds   (.) they hadn't agreed to do us a service.
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	I wanna get it through.
*STU:	Well they said they'd wait, I mean fifteen hundred pound ain't he would pa put a deposit down, it's only five percent   (.) innit?Fifteen hundred pound   (.) if he was prepared to put a deposit down   (        ) or something that would have been fifteen hundred quid.
*ANN:	Yes.
*STU:	So   (.) we got it.
*ANN:	He must have been looking for   (        ) bathroom.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Otherwise he wouldn't have accepted without any
*STU:	Without any quibble.
*ANN:	No.
*STU:	I thought it was worth pushing for the extra   (.) I mean when he said a thousand, I thought it would be 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	worth pushing for an extra five hundred, and did get it.
*ANN:	Yeah well he said a thousand because he knew he could get   (.) he'd carpet that   (.) er er   (        ) for a thousand.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	That's why he mentioned that sort of figure   (.) if all you wanted was a or , a fridge, a cooker   (.) and some carpets, you could do that easy on a thousand.
*STU:	Yeah   (.) but now we got the extra   (.) five hundred and which I say is th is, makes up for the   (.) which is five percent of the purchase price   (.) we've got   (.) an extra to play with   (.) and get a bit more.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Not too bad.
*ANN:	Gotta be careful when I'm cooking, I shall have to have the window open   (.) me I've got smoke alarms all over the place darling   (.) which is good in a flat.
*STU:	True, true.
*ANN:	Mm but erm   (.) you get steam up in the cooking area and er

*ANN:	Ding a ling a ling a ling a ling a ling   ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Right   (        ) yeah.
*ANN:	You think bloody hell, what the hell's   [laughing] going on here  [] ! (.) There is a smoke alarm in the airing cupboard   (.) in case that overheats and there's one
*STU:	In the hall  (        ) ?
*ANN:	No.
*STU:	I've only seen one, I haven't   (.) seen any more than one at
*ANN:	There's supposed to be one in the airing cupboard.
*STU:	Seen that one.
*ANN:	Case the airing cupboard overheats, but it says on the spec   (.) one airing cupboard when it, will have  (        ) , hot water tank and smoke alarm.
*STU:	Oh! (.) Ooh, ooh, ooh!
*ANN:	In case you let it   (.) hot water tank starts playing up.
*STU:	Mhm   (.) It says it doesn't, but   (.) like I say,i in a way it usually starts 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) .
*ANN:	Oh yeah   (.) Fire services, recommend everybody to have it
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	especially in an upstairs flat.
*STU:	Mm   (.) mm.
*ANN:	It's a    (        )  (.) and plenty of warning to get out.
*STU:	Mhm.
*ANN:	That's why he's had them put in   (.) cos the flat's more than house in in   (.) the only thing is I would say to you to let a   (.) heat from the kitchen and the 
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	smoke and steam they do tend to   (.) keep going.
*STU:	Set them off.
*ANN:	Ha ha   (.) and everybody starts running out the door   (.) and all you're doing is frying some breakfast   [laughing] or something! (.) Burning the toast  [] ! (.) I'll be dissuaded buying a pussy cat altogether now won't I?
*STU:	Ha ha   (.) Yeah it is 
*ANN:	Once it starts   (        ) that upstairs flat.
*STU:	It is a little bit er

*STU:	Oh yeah   (.) can't jump on the window to get in or anything.
*ANN:	Mm, no they wanted to be in, but you not hear it   (.) no I think pussy cat is   (.) gonna be a no no about us   (.) you'll have to  (        ) .
*STU:	Well it's certainly gonna be   (.) certainly won't let it  (        ) .
*ANN:	Looks like a  (        ) 
*STU:	It's gonna be a little bit tricky isn't it really, having a
*ANN:	I think I would just about give up over that.
*STU:	It's a shame.
*ANN:	 (        ) , but I mean a downstairs one wouldn't be quite so bad
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	but those stairs won't   (.) like, I mean, I wouldn't like it that if it was just indoors forever   (.) would you, honestly?
*STU:	Not really.
*ANN:	It's not fair on an animal even.
*STU:	It's not natural   (.) no.
*ANN:	Cats or something.
*STU:	Not really is it?
*ANN:	No I know and I don't fancy litter trays and things either.
*STU:	We might do one day or   (.) see
*ANN:	Yeah but   (.) but not while we're there, I don't think it's    (        )  (.) must get another budgie sometime   (.) get Steven's budgie or something.
*STU:	Yeah a cat's a little bit out on dashing upstairs now innit really? (.) It's a shame, but, there you go.
*ANN:	Definitely is up here, it's 
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	not fair on a animal as I say, he's bound to   (.) be trapped at the bloody door for hours before anybody come in and
*STU:	It ain't fair.
*ANN:	No.
*STU:	Actually that's something we'll have to   (.) negotiate with our   (.) er   (.) opposite neighbour
*ANN:	The stair carpets.
*STU:	stair carpet.
*ANN:	Hadn't thought of that, well that's gonna be noisy anybody coming home late at night   (.) wooden stairs.
*STU:	Don't know who you got   (.) we'll have to wait and see who we get.
*ANN:	Well fling that rug out the hall it'll be a start, bung it out on the landing   (.) for a start.
*STU:	Yeah   (.) yeah.
*ANN:	So at least there's something up there at the doors to wipe your feet on and what not, but   (.) I'm not splashing out on stair carpet   (.) until somebody else has been 
*STU:	Oh no.
*ANN:	in   (        ) as well.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Well there's something that will have to be will be 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	needed eventually.
*STU:	I say a negotiation with   (.) next door neighbour   (.) or something like that.
*ANN:	But you come home late at night when people are asleep
*STU:	Start banging up the stairs and
*ANN:	and you lot, and stroll in after half past four an five o'clock in the morning, you know, you do.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	If I don't get up till nine, it's a bit 
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	It won't be very nice   (.) so we'll have to just   (.) manage   (.) as for as   (.) the stall light   (.) the hall lighting   (.) who is responsible for that? (.) Cos the staircase has gotta be lit, I mean you can't get
*STU:	There is a light out there isn't there? (.) I noticed that.
*ANN:	I mean who who cares for the electricity? (.) It's gotta be on someone's electric hasn't it? (.) You can't, one flat's not gonna be responsible for having the hall lit up all night long which it will be and then   (.) length of time, unless it's on a timer switch.
*STU:	Mm   (.) that is something we will have to investigate.
*ANN:	I know.
*STU:	 (        )  (.) di discuss with our
*ANN:	I mean with
*STU:	 ((cough)) 
*ANN:	Steven's flat the council are responsible for lighting hallways but we   (.) th they're not  (        ) 
*STU:	No, no   (.) that's right.
