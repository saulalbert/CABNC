*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JIM:	and stuff and they'd be shouting down   (        ) they were all like, they were all real East End barrow boys   (.) and, and just, it was exactly like the film, just talking talking talking all the time on two phones and like, and like   [laughing] I was just so scared to go in there   [] because I, if you do anything wrong they just shout immediately.
*UNK:	 ((laugh))
