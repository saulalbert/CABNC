@Comment:	conversation #25 (Tape 041005)
*FRA:	Yeah, the front just  hinges off at the top. •220750_221047•
*STE:	It's not at the back of the  here is it? •221061_221336•
*FRA:	It , it may do, why? •221336_221407•
        Have you spotted something? •221448_221556•
*STE:	Dunno if it's the second one  down that way or not, but there's a crack across there. •221556_221992•
        Or is is it a crack or a scratch? •222082_222186•
        This is the right one. •222718_222782•
*FRA:	Yeah, that's the right one. •222889_222976•
        Oh I'll get my  magnifier. •223281_224191•
        Thing is, you're actually using, your eyes are not too good! •224191_224645•
*STE:	Well I get the magnifier to read the bloody  magazine sometimes! •224645_225023•
        It's ridiculous! •225068_225142•
        I'm going back to the  opticians with , the new glasses I got are still flipping worse than these! •225142_225581•
*FRA:	No, it's just a scratch I think. •226150_226244•
        Mm, somebody's been  working on this though haven't they? •227153_227445•
        The sound chip's in the wrong place. •227724_227867•
*STE:	Crikey! •228459_228481•
        Well this  is high enough! •228481_228586•
*FRA:	Yeah, it's probably worth changing the control innit, to see what happens? •228647_230383•
        They've evidently looked  you can see where they've scratched to get a screwdriver through there  to try and get the sound  the sound out. •230697_231384•
*STE:	Couldn't you tell with the meter er  the control whether it's worth it or not? •231423_231696•
*FRA:	Yeah, you should be able to. •231777_231870•
*STE:	Yeah, but I don't think the  it'll do what you want . •231870_232436•
*FRA:	Yeah, you'll have to. •233303_233462•
        Mm! •233465_233477•
*STE:	Want a , want a screwdriver there? •233481_233904•
*FRA:	I got one there, yeah. •233952_234786•
*STE:	? •_•
*FRA:	Yeah, I got one, yes. •234839_235170•
*STE:	Gonna turn it as well? •235170_235320•
*FRA:	Yeah. •235358_235364•
        If you can  oh, let's put it on. •235364_236139•
*STE:	around from one end to the other that is. •236148_237863•
*FRA:	Yeah! •237873_237884•
        Right! •237884_237896•
*STE:	Right now  one end to the other. •237896_238147•
*FRA:	Is it? •238147_238179•
        Oh! •238179_238190•
        Go that way. •238190_238220•
*STE:	No. •238220_238226•
*FRA:	Well that's . •238226_238431•
        I'll get there eventually! •238432_238784•
        That's not reading through anything that one. •238784_239156•
*STE:	That won't read through ? •239186_239231•
*FRA:	Yeah , I think so. •239231_239346•
        Now, one end is joined  so  a bit. •239346_239672•
        Okay? •239843_239856•
        Nothing! •240048_240059•
*STE:	No. •240564_240603•
*FRA:	So it was circuit then. •240635_240703•
        Just try the one above cos I think they're  oh wait a minute! •240703_241284•
        I'm not looking at  •241284_241343•
*STE:	You don't want to go there. •241343_241416•
*FRA:	I'm not   silly sod ! •241416_241510•
        Right! •241510_241521•
*STE:	Right, that moves. •241535_241582•
        Not much there. •241787_242128•
*FRA:	It should go right  across at one end. •242333_242561•
*STE:	No! •242561_242579•
        No that's •242643_242811•
*FRA:	Oh it is open circuit then. •242812_242870•
*STE:	Yeah, it's trying to go that  •242981_243187•
*FRA:	Yeah. •243204_243217•
*STE:	way. •243217_243236•
*FRA:	See if I reflected to this one I'll show you what the affect is. •243236_243549•
*STE:	turn  •243549_243563•
*FRA:	 •243743_•
*STE:	that ? •243758_243768•
*FRA:	Yeah, turn that one, yep! •243768_243852•
        Even the . •243852_243989•
        Remember where you can get it back to that's the only thing. •243989_244231•
*STE:	Oh! •244243_244252•
        Oh it's back where it was. •244398_244519•
        at one end. •244519_244667•
*FRA:	What are you doing this? •244667_245178•
*STE:	Ah ha, let me just twiddle it. •245238_245338•
        Hang on check this up and twiddling time. •245338_245539•
*FRA:	Yeah, see this is the wiper this should  well assure itself back to that one. •245698_246101•
*STE:	Goes when you touch it there. •246101_246251•
*FRA:	Yeah, just touching the ends together. •246251_246430•
*STE:	Oh! •246430_246461•
*FRA:	Mm! •246474_246477•
        I'll try the other one  cos I've got that in bits. •246682_246956•
        If you can  twiddle that one I'll er  •246956_247680•
*STE:	Yep! •247680_247694•
*FRA:	second one down. •247694_247921•
        It  reads totally different. •247966_248236•
        That's it! •248236_248449•
        Up one end  down the other. •248449_248832•
*STE:	More positive that one as well. •248832_249276•
*FRA:	Yeah. •249276_249309•
        That's  •249323_249377•
*STE:	Yeah. •249378_249379•
*FRA:	what it should read like. •249449_249707•
        So it's definitely on the circuit. •249722_249932•
*STE:	So it's down to the chip  and we haven't had the chance of being . •249956_250691•
*FRA:	We might have to, we might be able to get away without having to take the board out, if I  if I use the old de- solderer  might be able to just hook it out and put the next one in. •250691_260576•
        Yeah but , that's what they did change, you looking for the fault? •260656_265215•
*STE:	Yeah. •265649_265665•
        Mm mm mm mm mm mm   Ah ah! •265665_266131•
        What was that in the ? •266147_266310•

*FRA:	Oh my good God! •268160_268201•
*STE:	I've done the old  all been done in the packing! •268305_271920•
*FRA:	Oh yeah? •271942_272043•
        Do you know this bloody thing's jammed in the works somewhere, this control, it's fallen over! •272043_272523•
        It won't come out! •272523_272669•
        Swine! •272674_272682•
*STE:	What a duff! •272922_272955•
*FRA:	Oi! •272955_272964•

*FRA:	Oh is it? •274569_275764•
*STE:	Brushed it off. •275764_275817•
        have to come off with it. •275817_280561•
*FRA:	Mm. •280613_280622•
*STE:	Oh that's probably what's wrong is it, oh? •280622_281327•
