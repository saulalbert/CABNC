@Comment:	conversation #27 (Tape 010314)
*UNK:	No, it'll take a while •91625_96325•
*TON:	Yeah . •96325_96925•
*JAC:	it'll come suddenly. •126725_141725•
        What all you need know is a polishing off. •141725_171725•
*TON:	Mm. •175625_179425•
*JAC:	You know, you, it's, that's what it is it's getting the flow  •180125_216825•
*TON:	Yeah. •217225_220225•
*JAC:	and that takes the one off •228225_242925•
*TON:	Erm, but, he sorted something out for me, I, I said, cos of course now •242925_297125•
*JAC:	Carry on drying your hair can you? •297125_309425•
        You've got it all  . •309425_314325•
*TON:	Yes of course, you carry on drying your hair. •314625_347725•
        erm, so what happens now, is that er  I'm coming off the er, coming off the clutches as  before the corner •347725_454025•
*JAC:	Yeah. •458725_460425•
*TON:	and if it's a tight one, and you're going round it in first, really tight one, then what you need to be doing really is slipping the clutch  •472925_568625•
*JAC:	Yeah. •605125_607025•
*TON:	if it's really tight, slipping the clutch in first  and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to control it on the accelerator, you can't do it. •632025_727025•
*JAC:	You'll be able to, but you can't at the moment. •741225_764625•
*TON:	Mm. •767325_768325•
*JAC:	And that  •768325_777625•
*TON:	And it's much easier to try and control it on the clutch. •777625_802725•
*JAC:	Yeah. •806225_807325•
*TON:	So he , I said to him is it alright, says am I in danger of coasting if I've got my foot on the  if, if I'm taking the corner in first and  I'm slipping and  I got the clutch, I'm using the engine but I've, not much •820125_991725•
*JAC:	Yeah. •100812_100872•
*TON:	and he said oh no that's not coasting. •100872_102672•
*JAC:	No. •103622_103692•
*TON:	It's only if you've got the clutch right in. •103692_106182•
*JAC:	Yeah. •106182_106252•
*TON:	But, erm,in second my foot should be flat on the floor. •108442_113582•
        He took me round that blooming Argyle Road three times. •114482_117482•
*JAC:	Oh, the horrible corner. •118282_119702•
*TON:	Yeah, cos I told that was one, I said that's, that's the one I, I over slowed on my test. •119942_124952•
*JAC:	Yeah. •124952_125132•
*TON:	And he's told me that it's first gear, right. •127122_130142•
*JAC:	Yeah. •130422_130522•
*TON:	So what I was doing I was coming into it, I was coming in too fast for the gear, not too fast for the corner, but too fast for the gear. •130732_139252•
*JAC:	Yeah. •139472_139712•
*TON:	Shoving it in, shoving it into first, bring the clutch up quickly and the car goes weer and virtually stops  •139942_147942•
*JAC:	Yeah , yeah, yeah . •148252_150662•
*TON:	so it wasn't the fact I was trying to lose too much speed, it was that I changed into first and didn't have •150932_158862•
*JAC:	Enough revs on the engine to keep it going  •159992_161092•
*TON:	enough revs on the engine , he'd be going and when I lift, raised the clutch, whereas if I had brought the clutch up part way  •161092_169182•
*JAC:	The car would of slowly slowed down to be at the speed that the engine  •172472_176432•
*TON:	Yeah . •176432_176492•
*JAC:	was going on, yeah  yeah. •176972_179662•
*TON:	Well as I actually had to going round the corner, to get myself round the corner, I had to come off the brake and onto the accelerator •181432_187542•
*JAC:	Yeah. •187592_187682•
*TON:	to actually get myself round the corner. •188142_190302•
*JAC:	Yeah. •191542_191732•
*TON:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*JAC:	Yes, because you see,, I don't remember, I, I think I take that one in second you see. •199922_207102•
*TON:	Mm. •207102_207302•
*JAC:	But, •207442_207732•
*TON:	I took it, I, he said well try it and we went round it in first and I went and it went rrah  •208052_213582•
*JAC:	Yeah. •213582_214282•
*TON:	and, and, so erm, we  er, then I came round and I did it in second, he said there you went too wide there •214422_223222•
*JAC:	Yeah. •223712_223902•
*TON:	you came close to the white line. •224032_225502•
*JAC:	Yeah. •226592_226772•
*TON:	Yes, course there's always a car parked on the corner isn't it?. •228232_230642•
*JAC:	There's always a car parked on the corner  •230642_233162•
*TON:	 [laughing] 
*JAC:	. •_•
        I must admit I'd always cheat at that corner, when I'm coming up to it, I don't do it suddenly •234792_239902•
*TON:	Mm. •240002_240332•
*JAC:	I'm then coming up to it, I move fractionally out into the road •240702_243892•
*TON:	yeah. •244052_244602•
*JAC:	then you've got more room to get round  If you sit glued to the pavement it's a hell of a job to get round •244682_253552•
*TON:	Mm. •253552_253842•
*JAC:	whereas if your fractionally out further into the road it's easier to, got slightly different  •254352_257832•
*TON:	I didn't have that excuse because there's a car parked before the turning •257832_263252•
*JAC:	oh, so you've had to get out  •263382_264792•
*TON:	I had to be out wide and then turn in  •265042_268162•
*JAC:	yeah. •268432_268632•
*TON:	and there's a car on the opposite side of the road as you turn in  aha, so you go outside work and then round and ha, ha, oh  •268842_280052•
*JAC:	You'll get it. •284272_284822•
*TON:	But, that slipping the clutch is blimey useful. •285482_289582•
*JAC:	It is. •289582_289782•
*TON:	I beginning to find how useful, cos I can keep the revs going  •290292_293462•
*JAC:	Yeah. •295252_295322•
*TON:	When, when I'm not sure what's happening, and people are sort of weaving about and things like that, you can use that and you can just tick over and your ready to move if you need to and you can stop quite quickly if you need to as well. •295322_308112•
*JAC:	Yeah, yeah, I see. •309742_311362•
*TON:	I mean, we've, I've, there was a  situation  these are the roads he's taking me around now, he had me reverse round the corner which was practically blind, couldn't see what was round the corner, so I was edging round, and it was on a hill so I had to do it, every time I stopped I had to put the handbrake on so I didn't roll •312202_334702•
*JAC:	Yeah. •336402_336552•
*TON:	And  edging round the corner, checking all ways, there was a parked car, there's a van parked the opposite side of the road so anything turning in had to come over into my, the path of me •337062_350572•
*JAC:	Yeah. •351582_351682•
*TON:	and a, coming out of that there were some cars parked, some other cars trying to drive through, I was coming out trying to turn right, there was another car waiting to turn left, and he couldn't come in cos I was coming out. •351682_366552•
*JAC:	Yeah. •367012_367262•
*TON:	So I had to drive out past him, pull over to the other side of the road as much as possible to let him come through and the other cars come through, then I could  come . •367822_377682•
*JAC:	Yeah. •377872_378072•
*TON:	And doing that, to have the clutch sort of half way up in first you just sort of, you just  •380252_387712•
*JAC:	you need help  , •387712_388022•
*TON:	sort of kick on  and it's quite nice and you've got it all under control and if you get a chance to go you can and if you've got to stop it's no problem. •388402_396562•
*JAC:	yeah  •396912_397042•
*TON:	And then I got myself in a knot  cos there was a car coming up the road •404302_412692•
*JAC:	Yeah •412692_412782•
*TON:	between a lot of parked cars and there was a, I was coming down the road and all I needed to do was to actually stop where I was  cos there was enough room on his side of the road for him to come past the parked car and round me •414132_430752•
*JAC:	Yeah. •432262_432372•
*TON:	I sort off, parked car there and I came up and he had room to do that •432372_437982•
*JAC:	Yeah. •438432_438492•
*TON:	and what I did was, there was a gap here, and I drove into the gap nose first, and I did do a hell of a lot of steering to get myself out •439342_449732•
*JAC:	Yeah, but  that means that they still do occasionally •449732_455372•
*TON:	Yeah. •456432_456672•
*JAC:	I mean, that, very, very occasionally you'll do something and you'll think, erm why didn't I do that  you think that's stupid, you know , •457062_466522•
*TON:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	and you think oh. •466522_468112•
*TON:	yeah . •468162_468402•
        There's no need, no need to do that he said. •468402_471712•
*JAC:	No, occasionally I'll do something like that mind you . •471822_474732•
*TON:	There's plenty of room, yeah there's plenty of room for him to get passed in. •474732_482582•
*JAC:	Yeah  I was annoyed, up at Christine's school the other day, I was waiting for Anita, and there's driveways all along that road •484542_491562•
*TON:	Mm, mm. •491562_491872•
*JAC:	so there's stops where you can park on those  •491872_494032•
*TON:	Yeah  •494032_494332•
*JAC:	driveways, it was pouring down with rain one day so I was going up to meet her and we, I'd got up there, I've learnt now, I leave home  at quarter past three if it's raining •494432_507842•
*TON:	mm. •508022_508302•
*JAC:	I go up to meet Anita, anyway you can get a parking space up there, so I've turned, drove up there  they say I haven't left as early, it was while I was learning  •508302_520972•
*TON:	Yeah. •521212_521522•
*JAC:	when the erm, so it, a car parked across a drive  and a car, the car behind him which was in a space was going •522232_535332•
*TON:	Mm. •535662_535952•
*JAC:	and it was in quite a big space, I could off got in behind him and then changed if I'd reversed in  but when I saw this other chap sat in his car and then he indicated he wanted to pull out, so I let him go •536572_548532•
*TON:	Mm. •548922_549132•
*JAC:	Then I drove into his space  well then somebody else came and drove in behind me  and the car in front then was sort of, oh yeah, then somebody else came and reversed in in front of him, so the car in front it was across the drive was boxed in by this time, I didn't box him in I just  •549362_572832•
*TON:	No . •572832_572992•
*JAC:	parked behind, but then somebody else came and parked in front of him, and he was there and sort, you could see him looking you know, he looked at the driveway and he looked, he was looking in his rear view mirror and then he turned round and looked like this, then he looked at the front, and he was thinking my god I can't get out of here, and all of a sudden a little car comes up the road stops, goes beep, beep on the horn, wanna get in the drive, this bloke went ha, ha, ha, ha  and he couldn't do anything   •572992_601682•
*TON:	. •_•
*JAC:	So, so, he looked, he looked round at me, he looked at the  the other group waiting in front and he was, he flashed his lights at them so that, they realised what was going on by then, they moved forward a bit , I moved back a bit and he just had enough room he reversed right up close to me and then got out but he just had enough room to get out, and since then I won't park over the driveway up there, cos you can bet your life the one driveway along that road and you parked in front is the one that somebody wants to get into. •604692_632732•
*TON:	Ah . •634232_634262•
        Yeah. •634372_634682•
*JAC:	Oh right, I'd better go actually. •636032_638032•
        Mother eh be er complaining. •638862_640602•
*TON:	Yeah, okay. •641702_642522•
*JAC:	Where have you been, you said half past three. •642692_645902•
*TON:	Well it's twenty five to four, what does that . •645902_652762•
*JAC:	It'll be twenty to by the time I get round there.. •652962_657482•
*TON:	Better do this washing up hadn't I? •661252_665892•
*JAC:	I can't  •666732_667652•
*TON:	I'd put  •667652_668012•
*JAC:	believe it when he took the . •668012_670412•
*TON:	I put in for the eh, my driving test again. •670522_673172•
*JAC:	Oh good. •673532_673832•
*TON:	Okay. •674342_674522•

*TON:	Sometime in the New Year now. •677332_678572•
*JAC:	What date did you put on the form, not before •679402_682112•
*TON:	Well he's put a month from the last  test. •683112_687632•
*JAC:	Mm. •689852_689912•
*TON:	Well you won't have it around Christmas, after between Christmas and the New year . •689952_693242•
*JAC:	No , no. •693282_694582•
*TON:	It'll be erm, January time I suppose . •694582_698112•
*JAC:	I, I said to him I, I don't want, I know I can't have a test soon, but I don't really want another one  that soon. •698112_707842•
*TON:	No  but now all that your doing is polishing your drive better off •710892_716392•
*JAC:	Mm. •716962_717292•
*TON:	unfortunately that can be a very painful business  •717422_719612•
*JAC:	Mm. •720102_720322•
*TON:	Depends •720772_721352•
*JAC:	Yeah. •721732_721972•
*TON:	You might find it easy •721972_722992•
*JAC:	Yeah. •723522_723802•
*TON:	easier. •724312_724452•
*JAC:	What  •724712_724832•
*TON:	But. •724832_724932•
*JAC:	we doing tomorrow? •724932_725772•
*TON:	Tomorrow well, trainee to wash and a hoover   •726242_733052•
*JAC:	Mm. •734312_734652•
*TON:	This is yet, Tesco's open as well, we've lost our •736632_739372•
*JAC:	Yeah. •739592_739882•
*TON:	little driving spaces now. •739882_741482•
*JAC:	Yeah, okay. •741482_742462•
*TON:	Masterline's open,are open. •742712_744352•
*JAC:	Yeah, so I can't •744932_747412•
*TON:	You can have a drive round actually, round by the Coca Cola factory there maybe somewhere •747412_751412•
*JAC:	Mm. •751412_751622•
*TON:	you can go. •752412_753382•
*JAC:	I think I, what, what I'm thinking is that this sort of  are there's er any, any driving would be good •753382_764552•
*TON:	Yes it would. •764902_765522•
*JAC:	No matter what I do. •768252_768342•
*TON:	Yeah. •768402_768482•
*JAC:	But checking this slipping the clutch in first. •772672_776552•
*TON:	Yeah. •777752_777812•
*JAC:	Cos, when you try, if you try and control it on the accelerator it's very, it's really jerky •777882_782952•
*TON:	Yeah. •783572_783662•
*JAC:	or it's very difficult to keep it smooth •783662_785662•
*TON:	Yeah . •785662_785752•
*JAC:	I won't say it's really jerky, but it •785752_788002•
*TON:	I can do it, but I've been driving for two and a half years •788002_790342•
*JAC:	Yeah, yeah  •790342_791272•
*TON:	and then it's  •791272_791692•
*JAC:	I  •792092_792272•
*TON:	And I can only just do it •792272_793362•
*JAC:	Yeah •793512_793782•
*TON:	It's very, I mean the foot control is very, very . •793782_796592•
*JAC:	And it's so much easier to put some reeves on than use the clutch . •796622_800802•
*TON:	It is. •802132_802782•
*JAC:	It is . •802782_803072•
*TON:	But then again, you've got to feel a bit careful there because it can misconstrued totally •803242_810392•
*JAC:	Mm. •810392_810632•
*TON:	if, but I mean if your obviously doing it and you  more moving the clutch up and down •810802_816512•
*JAC:	Mm. •817102_817192•
*TON:	then fair enough. •817312_818792•
*JAC:	Mm. •819272_819352•
*TON:	You know? •819352_819802•
*JAC:	He said something and I couldn't make sense of it •820172_822812•
*TON:	What did he say? •822892_823872•
*JAC:	because he said  that  when I came into that corner I pulled in  I'd slowed too much  and then had to drive round, drive round the corner with my left foot flat on the floor  and I thought oh, shouldn't your left foot be flat on the floor when you corner and that's probably what he was getting at, as I could off been slipping the clutch. •824312_859702•
*TON:	Yeah   •862612_862792•
*JAC:	But when he said it, I thought  oh I thought I had to have my left foot flat on the floor when I cornered, cos in second you have too. •862822_870582•
*TON:	Yeah. •871282_871442•
*JAC:	In second it's cut and dry •871962_873352•
*TON:	Yeah. •874112_874292•
*JAC:	You've got to have your foot flat on the floor before you corner. •874362_877062•
*TON:	That corner is an absolute horrible •877342_880052•
*JAC:	Yeah I know. •880522_880972•
*TON:	it does, on the corner •880972_882942•
*JAC:	Yeah •883132_883392•
*TON:	and that one you've got to drive it definitely than most corners •883792_887942•
*JAC:	Yeah. •888102_888332•
*TON:	so you, you can't treat that as an ordinary left handed turn, •888332_892182•
*JAC:	No. •892182_892252•
*TON:	it is very  •892252_892532•
*JAC:	But if you can't cope with it. •893082_894262•
*TON:	You've got to be able to cope with it . •894262_896022•
*JAC:	You've got to be able to cope with it. •896022_897032•
*TON:	Yeah. •897562_897782•
*JAC:	But you've got to treat it as a special case •897932_899862•
*TON:	Yeah. •900452_900562•
*JAC:	and you've got to  •901882_902272•
*TON:	No, I , I won't tell you how I was taught to do it because I was taught to do it very differently. •902272_906002•
*JAC:	Mm. •906702_906992•
*TON:	I was taught to do it in first and use the accelerator. •907232_910952•
*JAC:	Mm. •911872_912172•
