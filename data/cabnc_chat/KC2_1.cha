*FRE:	yeah   (.) yes I wondered if David would be on bus, I saw Wendy having a   (.) he worked later today because he's got so much done on front of the er   (.) that weather he couldn't er, do any decorating outside   (.) still we never got nobbled down street providing the er   (.) canvassers
*FLO:	They'd all got too cold and run home I expect
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	this morning, but 
*FRE:	Yeah 
*FLO:	it was thick cold
*FRE:	He said there were three er, down there canvassing for the main parties and er, well quite a lot of people there and of course rich pickings for, providing they can get anybody to stop and talk to them   (.) don't know, they'd drive around
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	I expect so   (.) this is that
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	said that people are losing all interest in the election and they've got no faith in any of parties they all seemed to much alike and all fund ranges
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	well, er in a, in a sense it, it's, it, it been known since
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	Who?
*FRE:	they're talking none about the, the economy and turn up before the end of the year, this, the, the, they've been hanging on and on and on, and er slagging one another off all the time
*FLO:	Yeah
*FRE:	they've
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRE:	but er
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	well both the Liberal Democrats put a candidate up anyway  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	Yes, I remember seeing any
*FRE:	Well they didn't do
*FLO:	if they, well, be having, well, didn't have any meetings
*FRE:	They left it a bit late didn't they
*FLO:	Yeah 
*FRE:	really? (.) Maybe they had problems getting it 
*FLO:	I wouldn't mind going to hear it if they do have a meeting
*FRE:	Well she's er, I don't know whether she still teaches, she did teach at Corby 
*FLO:	Corby , yeah I saw a bit in the paper
*FRE:	well if she still does it didn't make it clear, and she lives at Knilton 
*FLO:	Where's Knilton?
*FRE:	Well it's near
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	I've, I've never been there, I mean years back when we went cricket in the football one, we, we went to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	playing football, but in those days Corby steel works
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	And you're only a village 
*FRE:	And you're only, still a village
*FLO:	Yeah
*FRE:	yeah, but it's a, a fair size down, but er Middleton I've never been there, I don't know where it is, but it must be near Corby   (.) that worth finding on the er map
*FLO:	What?
*FRE:	We can find it on the map
*FLO:	Yes I expect so
*FRE:	To tell you the truth I've never heard of it
*FLO:	No
*FRE:	I just think that, there weren't many small villages in Northamptonshire that er well I didn't hear of, if, you know, I didn't know of, even if I hadn't visited them, but erm 
*FLO:	Wonder if she'll be staying in Wellingborough, at least she'll have to travel
*FRE:	Pardon?
*FLO:	a lot to this constituency during the next few weeks won't she?
*FRE:	Did she what?
*FLO:	I wonder whether she would be staying in Wellingborough or
*FRE:	No telling, how she's got to, we all obviously she has to 
*FLO:	Well these days in a car it's not many minutes drive is it 
*FRE:	Yeah, no, no 
*FLO:	from Corby and Wellingborough
*FRE:	makes several
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	unless we get a usual three inches of wet snow and that'll stop everything  ((laugh)) , you never know do you? (.) There's one thing a man
*FLO:	No snow now
*FRE:	Pardon?
*FLO:	Hope we've finished with the snow now
*FRE:	But there's one thing you've got to 
*FLO:	 ((yawn)) 
*FRE:	I've said to many years now about English weather in a sense it's, it, it, it's got a something of endearing quality, you don't like going through the bad weather, but the fact is that we do get generally good weather 
*FLO:	Yeah 
*FRE:	at times
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	well there's so many areas in the world where they get lots and lots of er
*FLO:	Yes you know, you know what the weather's going to be like 
*FRE:	Well you know what it's going to be like, it's sort of a set piece each, each season
*FLO:	Yeah
*FRE:	but er, you can't say that er   (.) the British are
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	well we can do that we had some lovely spring, that day we went up to the park it was what spring like weren't it?
*FRE:	Oh yeah 
*FLO:	Now it feels cold again
*FRE:	It were March, February too weren't it?
*FLO:	That's right
*FRE:	Yeah, fantastic
*FLO:	the snowdrops there
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	you know I remember ever so clearly, when I worked down the Totexas, Dentons 
*FLO:	Mm
*FRE:	all those years back, in the late fifties were it?
*FLO:	It was the fifties yeah 
*FRE:	I was down there in the late fifties 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	it was nineteen forty nine
*FRE:	and I remember one particular February, it will always stand out in my mind because er, it's a fairly long walk done to the factory from, from here and every day after the midday meal, when I set out to walk down there as quick as I could it had been cloudy since, it was raining, every day without fail I used to get to work soaked, first
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	What February used to be sort of reckoned for rain didn't it?
*FRE:	Yeah
*FLO:	The way, the way they talk about March winds it was February rain they
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	well
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	you see, first in
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	yeah
*FRE:	when I got there, several times he used to scruffle into the er packing room and come out with those two, three of those well a couple of those large sheets of brown paper that they pack, yeah, pack the few boxes in 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	and I'm not used to that, shove them up 
*FLO:	and, but, but 
*FRE:	shove them up their trousers and pull the trousers up, expose the leg and wrap round paper around and that was a amazing 
*FLO:	was that keep
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	and it dried the trousers out, and dried the leg and, it were lovely and cosy after
*FLO:	 ((cough)) 
*FRE:	half an hour or so
*FLO:	backward a bit when you walked
*FRE:	Aye it did, but
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	it were a, it were a efficient way of er getting dry   (.) mm and the next day there would of
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	this evening
*FLO:	Does what?
*FRE:	I wondered if David had got this evening to catch a bottle of wine
*FLO:	Perhaps not
*FRE:	could be   (.) the two of them they just, when er, when Lee set out   (.) on a Saturday evening with er Kevin   (.) and they often sit there and er have a, er a bit of a snack, supper, light supper and er
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	Well, although you get a 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	in the evening anyway don't you?
*FRE:	Yeah, but a lot of the time 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	have a main meal waiting   (.) probably, have a lighter snack later on, have a glass of wine with it  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Derby and Joans pair
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	how old is Wendy?Is she older than David?
*FLO:	Wendy, she's just a little bit older than David
*FRE:	Is she?
*FLO:	four or five years I think
*FRE:	Ooh I didn't realize that   (.) so Dave's forty one?
*FLO:	Forty , forty last June, he's coming up to forty one this year
*FRE:	forty one in May?
*FLO:	Yeah  (.) 
*FRE:	And Wendy's er
*FLO:	Wendy must be forty five at least 
*FRE:	Ah, oh I didn't realize she was
*FLO:	unless she was, she's quite a bit older   (.) than Dave 
*FRE:	at least she's older, but er not to that extent
*FLO:	I wasn't very happy about it at the time, anyway, I was, her being, I think he was only   (.) when were they married? (.) Seventy   (.) three, the end of seventy three   (.) and he was twenty   (.) twenty two wasn't it they were married? (.) She'd already been married and divorced and she was quite a bit older than him and I, I wasn't very happy about it to start, but they seem to have settled down alright
*FRE:	Well she's made David a good wife actually  (.) 
*FLO:	Well they've never had any more youngsters go
*FRE:	Told me, she actually told me once that she considered herself lucky to er, have met David, I reckon she did because er, she, she was divorced then and er   (.) of course, didn't she have a son?
*FLO:	She has got a son, yeah, I don't think she sees him much now, he did come here to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	that she sees much of him, he's er   (.) about twenty or more now
*FRE:	Yeah   (.) I was surprised that er Kathleen is it, when Kathleen told us down street about her, her son
*FLO:	He went in the army
*FRE:	Yeah, or rather
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	that's the older one, the one who's friend of Mat's?
*FRE:	That's right yeah, for a little bit, I was on about the reference to er Embassy Service though  (.) 
*FLO:	He'd a, he had some sort of operation or something, it's not, but at Debbie's wedding, Andrew weren't there because he   (.) some operation on his jaw or something that, can't remember now what it, what he'd had done   (.) were having his jaw bone 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Oh yes I remember him, yeah, they were a bit concerned, well I would have been, and then
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	lucky with their
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	I was gonna say
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	jolly lucky   (.) whether they er, whether they all turn up on Friday to er, have a word with Eileen I don't know  (.) 
*FLO:	Ah yes I think they all know he's coming now.
*FRE:	Does Steve know? (.) 
*FLO:	Well we told her last 
*FRE:	Oh was she so 
*FLO:	when she came up last Saturday
*FRE:	Oh did you?Oh, thank god for that   (.) Michael knows, Michael's manager he knows, did you tell him?
*FLO:	Yeah I told Michael, I phoned him this morning
*FRE:	Brian knows
*FLO:	Yes  (.) 
*FRE:	come here
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	I've got some bits in there for her   (.) a few kittens in there for a couple of days I, so they'd go up, pick them up and they get left  (.) 
*FRE:	Well we'll pop down, oh we can't pop down tomorrow unless we go before, get in the morning, before we go to work   (.) across to Steve's, if it's fine it'll be a good walk over there 
*FLO:	No I don't mind walking if it's fine, I said to Sandra 
*FRE:	so, we take 
*FLO:	providing it's not raining
*FRE:	we'll take, we will take that she ought to go 
*FLO:	won't it be muddy?
*FRE:	well we know I shall go through the fields, but we can still take the short er cut through the estate up Bedford Road, by the cemetery
*FLO:	Yeah, doesn't
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	pass up by there?So you go through the cemetery
*FRE:	I well, you can go through the cemetery, yes, you can go through there 
*FLO:	Well I didn't know where it was near a path 
*FRE:	and then you go 
*FLO:	well is it likely to be in the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	you go in at the top of 
*FLO:	the church is 
*FRE:	top of the road, what road's that running off from er High Street, South
*FLO:	Mm, yeah 
*FRE:	can't remember
*FLO:	Stones Lane, I'd got used to Manners Lane, they call it something quite
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	since they've built up there, Mannings, Mannings Street or Mannings 
*FRE:	You, you put down that you 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	escape there and
*FLO:	yeah
*FRE:	and that's the best way, it'll er, oh you'll save   (.) ten minutes easy, it's a fair walk it, on the main road
*FLO:	I was hoping when they got that link road through they might connect up, but I don't suppose it, sort of roads gotta put parking towards the long piece of 
*FRE:	Oh no, it won't be a 
*FLO:	major road
*FRE:	it's just
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRE:	no I'm afraid there'll be no footpath there, in fact, it hurts me a bit that because they're cutting straight, they're cutting along in line with that pub public 
*FLO:	Yeah 
*FRE:	footpath
*FLO:	One thing if they 
*FRE:	it's nothing wrong with 
*FLO:	if they put a cycle path along the edge of each road when they build them
*FRE:	No, they're not as sensible as they are you   (.) remember in Prestley when we went there   (.) so what er, perhaps, especially for solid places, solid with the roads in Germany
*FLO:	Oh in Germany yes there's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	you've got priority there,
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	statue and cross over.
*FRE:	I mean it, it's incredible in
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	we, we went to, we travelled about a bit while we were there   (.) went into Holland and er came via through Belgium and Holland just to get there, and look how tidy 
*FLO:	But before we went down into the 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	the towns were
*FLO:	tried to borrow a bike for us so that we could bike round, but when she 
*FRE:	Oh 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	she probably failed to er look
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	it's not as if there's anywhere where you can hire a bike I'm sure   (.) you know, but, I suppose you're going along on the road, across the road I  (.) 
*FRE:	 ((sniff)) course that's, that's the beauty of er biking it up the hill, that's some, there's so much scope for not being on the road, you've got special baths for someone
*FLO:	Yeah
*FRE:	the only one I want to know in this area is a, you can 
*FLO:	the one between the 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	that's it
*FLO:	they put that there when they built that new school 
*FRE:	they did that for the school children
*FLO:	so that the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	children could find the school  (.) 
*FRE:	yeah and that's the only one I know of   (.) it's incredible to me   (.) either  (.) 
*FLO:	Is it raining again?
*FRE:	No it could do in a moment or two though it er, it looks a bit ominous, you rub one or two er doubts, they are similar colour to these actually
*FLO:	Is that, that the first one that's opening a creamy coloured one?
*FRE:	Yes   (.) oh this Ellerdor is er playing around a bit now
*FLO:	Yeah  (.) 
*FRE:	but it's not as spectacular, not a very spectacular sight is it?
*FLO:	What that erm
*FRE:	Ellerdor 
*FLO:	Oh it said in the, in the book when I read about it, it said it had green flowers, you say is that green flowers
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	I didn't even know there were any green flowers  (.) 
*FRE:	I'd never even noticed the one next door, but the herb must have come from that
*FLO:	No, er Jane spotted cos she said that's where the seed must have come from 
*FRE:	Yeah 
*FLO:	she said they seed freely, so we'll have to watch we shall have them all over the garden next year 
*FRE:	Oh when you , when they've flown
*FLO:	Yeah
*FRE:	she's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	cos er she said she's only got one she'd like another, and
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	that we've got two, she should have this, smaller one down here
*FLO:	Yeah
*FRE:	I'll dig it out for her
*FLO:	 ((yawn)) 
*FRE:	What time we taking
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	I don't know, when you like,
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	back over with you, I'll sort something out while I've got some small change in me purse now I've been shopping, I'll sort it out  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	there's another five, there's another five
*FRE:	Mm, you've 
*UNK:	 (        )  (        )  (.) 
*FLO:	Is there two?
*FRE:	You've got some er, have much have you got upstairs to change?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	You've got er nine upstairs to change haven't you?
*FLO:	Yes I know I'll take it when I go down to the post office and I keep forgetting, don't like bothering with it on Thursday because they've always got a shop full and I   (.) go
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	any other day  (.) 
*FRE:	These tomatoes are a bit hard, did you know?
*FLO:	They're what?
*FRE:	The tomatoes you bought down the market
*FLO:	They're what?
*FRE:	They're a little bit hard
*FLO:	Well there was some marked firm tomatoes, then there were the others, I had some of the others
*FRE:	It looks more
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	well I skinned them
*FRE:	if they were firmer than these
*FLO:	I'll have skinned a couple of them
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	well these, these are, there, I mean in, they, they'll are
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	without er, the other fruit 
*FLO:	No , the ones at the front of the store were for seventy P and they were marked firmed tomatoes, the others at the back were sixty P and they didn't say firm on them so I thought well, firm probably means hard, I'll get the, get the others, so I'll skinned a couple of them for tea
*FRE:	Oh they're alright though
*FLO:	anyway, I've got to go upstairs, oh
*FRE:	I saw some nice Cox's orange on the market two pounds for a pound
