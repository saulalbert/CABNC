*NOR:	Busy road to live on this isn't it?
*CHR:	Yes it is actually.Too fast.
*NOR:	Does she find it busy?
*CHR:	Perhaps she can sell them a few sleeping policeman, I can't remember her saying so as such.I spoke to Tony  today.
*NOR:	Oh yeah, on what?
*CHR:	Oh, scientific instrumentation.Got a chap in Japan who wants some.He's a bit woolly about what he wants.Tony gave him the name of his, pal of his, who is professor of biochemical engineering as in University College, London.
