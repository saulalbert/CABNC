*LUC:	Elizabeth had won the essay competition and was just about to stand up when Jessica got up  and she walked  up to Mr   and she asked  and he asked her what magazine she wanted for the year  and she said Rock Seventeen  Jessica knew what magazine Elizabeth wanted and she just said Rock Seventeen. •12885_355485•
        Then she had to stay behind and got Jessica's detention  and was late for her next lesson  and got another  detention  for running in the main building. •366285_487785•
        But the trouble was they were both at the same time after school where she was meant to be decorating the hall for the disco after school that night. •493385_565085•
        Then, she got Jessica's C for her cooking class instead of the A Jessica got off hers. •576685_635385•
        But, after school she went to her detention with Mr   and course, the note said  going to the dentist, sudden toothache. •648185_722249•
        So she went to  her other detention and there was another note saying, had to pick up my child from school. •729149_792149•
        So, she went to decorate the hall and got sent out with people saying  she was Jessica. •802449_850049•
        Elizabeth slammed the kitchen door and dropped her  bag. •869949_910449•
        What's wrong said Jessica? •914849_937149•
        So Elizabeth told her everything that had happened today  and after half an hour they decided to tell everyone what they had done at the disco that night. •938449_103734•
        So that night, at the disco  they told them and at last they believed them  and sorted out the magazine thing and changed the magazine to  Mysteries from Around the World. •104124_113104•
        And then, they changed the cookery marks. •113104_115944•
        And Jessica said, I'll race to the cake  and the twins were back to normal . •116364_124694•
*TER:	Mm! •124694_124904•
        Now  right! •125344_130614•
        Well I am going to have to look at them both. •130834_132454•
        And see if I, I like them both. •132454_134464•
        There's, there's a lot of work gone into those . •134464_135974•
        Erm  if I'm honest I think I found  Holly's easier to understand  on a first reading  but that may be because I think perhaps read it. •137464_152054•
        Perhaps, in a slightly more clearer way than you did. •154724_156824•
        That doesn't mean that yours isn't as good. •157054_158724•
        So I, what I want to do now, and I have do take time to do it, I can't do it just now when you're here. •159094_163774•
        But I want to look at them both  and I will go through them as well and mark them for spelling and for  for your punctuation and everything else. •164614_170294•
        But, really you both put a tremendous amount of work in! •170374_173184•

*TER:	to her. •629913_630703•
        Well, for instance, that she lived in a in an old vicarage, cos her husband had been a  a, no a , priest in the Church of England and er  her house was haunted  and she was telling us stories and she quite often saw the ghost, she was never worried, she never  cos it never frightened her it wasn't vicious or anything like that and she often saw it  quite matter of fact . •630703_651223•
        As a matter of fact, she often saw this ghost. •652893_655223•
        But, she was telling the story of a man who was travelling over the moor  and it was many years ago   on horseback  and er he  was completely lost and , it was getting dark and he wanted to  stay somewhere for the night  and he sort of travelled and couldn't see anywhere and eventually down a long drive he saw a house , blazing with lights  so he went down this house  and er, all the windows were alight, you know  were lit up  and he knocked at the door and knocked at the door, and knocked at the door and couldn't get any answer, no one ever came to the door  so in desperation he thought well this is no good! •655223_686783•
        So he went back up onto the main road and very little further on, in fact, he in fact found a village  and spent the night at the hostelry  and he said to the man in the hostelry  you know,that he'd been lost and that a  a little bit back on the road he'd seen this big house all alight and he had erm, you know, gone in the drive and tried to get  get a room there but  couldn't make anybody hear  and the erm  the inn keeper said, no he said er  you wouldn't make anyone hear there, he said and if you go back there tomorrow  the house won't be there! •686993_720673•

*ADR:	I I knew that erm  I , I understand some of it but some of it I find a bit hard to understand  like  this bit, it says  be careful, sometimes the unknown side is  is the longest side and sometimes it is not. •110496_111908•
        But I , I I can't, I know that you have to take it away. •111967_112345•
*TER:	Yes but  the thing is this  in a right angle triangle •112366_112637•
*ADR:	Mm. •112637_112661•
*TER:	the longest side is called what? •112661_112899•
        Cos it  •112899_112952•
*ADR:	The hypotenuse. •112952_113066•
*TER:	The hypotenuse, right! •113066_113140•
        So the longer side is always the hypotenuse. •113140_113356•
*ADR:	Yeah. •113356_113365•
*TER:	Right? •113365_113426•
        Now, what is the formula  for your Pythagoras theorem? •113485_113920•
*ADR:	The sum of the erm I I don't, I know, my dad's taught me a different one to Miss , she  she taught me that erm  the, oh hang on! •113943_114999•

        Erm, if I can find it! •115746_116094•
        The right angle triangle. •116094_116477•
        The areas and squares on the  two short sides  add together to equal the area on the square of the hypotenuse. •116488_117331•
*TER:	Right! •117331_117340•
        The square on the hypotenuse •117340_117651•
*ADR:	Yeah. •117651_117668•
*TER:	equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides. •117668_118118•
*ADR:	Yeah. •118118_118141•
*TER:	The square on the hypotenuse  equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides. •118141_118818•
*ADR:	Okay. •118818_118840•
*TER:	Alright? •118840_118878•
*ADR:	Yeah. •118973_118992•
*TER:	And the hypotenuse is always the longest side. •119061_119455•
        It's the side opposite the right angle. •119534_119866•
*ADR:	Mhm. •119866_119893•
*TER:	So  there's your right angle  that is the hypotenuse and the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares, that's the , the area of that square and the area of that square add together the sum of the squares on the other two sides. •119933_121341•
*ADR:	Okay. •121358_121403•
*TER:	Alright? •121544_121558•
        The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. •121558_122162•
        So  what they're saying is this  that  the square on that side •122162_123282•
*ADR:	Mm. •123282_123327•
*TER:	is thirty six, so what's the length of that side? •123398_123758•

        So the  that side must be six centimetres •125338_125552•
*ADR:	Yeah. •125552_125599•
*TER:	The square is six times six which is thirty six. •125638_125910•
        That is four square centimetres. •125910_126144•
*ADR:	Mm. •126144_126205•
*TER:	It's four centimetres and the square is sixteen  so, what must be the area of that square? •126313_126940•
*ADR:	Twenty. •126940_126969•
*TER:	Twenty. •127011_127055•
