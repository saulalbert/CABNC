*GIN:	Yeah they're much cheaper than Safeway.

*GIN:	 Christmas   (  )  bananas. I'm nearly out of feverfew. Better get some.  (.) Oh I never find it.  (.) It's in a box like that.  (.) Then one of the girls comes over and says here it is, straight away.

*DIN:	Hang on. You haven't done that very well have you? 
*GIN:	 ((laugh)) Oops. 
*DIN:	Oh mother! Hang on.  Put it in there. 
*GIN:	 Well I've only  got one hand as well.  (.) Should have had a basket.  (.) Eggs, new era, camomile tea.  (.) Christmas cards. In there   (  ) you've put bananas in there. Erm   (.) where's your eggs gone? 
*JAC:	Eggs? 
*GIN:	Mm. 
*JAC:	Just there. To your left.

*GIN:	Yes. 
*UNK:	Thankyou. 
*GIN:	I don't think anyone ever wants the receipts. 
*UNK:	No.  Goodbye. 
*GIN:	 Thank you very  much my dear. Bye bye. I hope you've got my gloves? 
*DIN:	Yeah I've got them. Your gloves and your brolly. 
*GIN:	I got Keith some rice mixture yesterday and   (.) he didn't eat it. He wanted   (.) come on then.  (10.0) It's warm enough to have the door open. (  )   
*DIN:	 What do you  need here? 
*GIN:	Christmas cards. 
*DIN:	They're er   (.) they're in there. 
*GIN:	They're good aren't they?  (.) Oh no that's, that's where I usually get them. In that   (.) bin. 
*DIN:	These are thirty p. They're quite  (  ) . And then robins on the front. 
*GIN:	Oh they're nice aren't they? How many to a pack, six? 
*DIN:	I don't know. Er 
*GIN:	Looks quite a lot. 
*DIN:	Ten. That's not bad.  For thirty p. 
*GIN:	 Jesus  incredible. Isn't it? 
*DIN:	That's good isn't it? 
*GIN:	I suppose they're all alike but they've put different ones on the outside. 
*DIN:	Well they must be similar. 
*GIN:	Erm   (.) casseroles. They probably won't have any cos it's winter now. They only sell casseroles and things in the summer. Oh look.  (.) There's one but it's not a, not a three pint. 
*DIN:	Three or four pints she said. 
*GIN:	Mm. 
*DIN:	Is that Pyrex? 
*GIN:	Well it's, it's the French equivalent. 
*DIN:	Is it? 
*GIN:	Mm. Arcal crystau d'arc yes. 
*DIN:	I don't know. 
*GIN:	Or crystau d'arc whatever you like to call it. 
*DIN:	 (  ) 
*GIN:	No, she said   (.) well she means an oven dish. Still they're very nice. I wish they'd got a bigger one. 
*DIN:	What size are they then? 
*GIN:	Two   (.) one and a half to two pint I would think. 
*DIN:	Oh they're not very big are they? 
*GIN:	And   (.) that's a water set.  (.) Hello love! 
*VIC:	Hello. 
*GIN:	You haven't got any larger casserole dishes have you? 
*VIC:	No  (  ) . You want the great big one  (  )  
*GIN:	Mm 
*VIC:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	about a three pinter. 
*VIC:	Yeah.  (  ) ten pound one. No we do one like this, in this   (  ) colour, Pyrex  but a big one  . 
*GIN:	 Oh that's alright.  But you haven't got one? 
*VIC:	But no, it's that one there. That's the size up from that one. 
*GIN:	Yeah. That's what we want, yes. 
*VIC:	Yeah.  (.) But   (.) haven't got one. 
*GIN:	Oh you rotten thing. 
*VIC:	Actually ask the girls and if they get them, go up the warehouse next week   (.) they'll bring you one. (.)  
*GIN:	They're nice, those. 
*VIC:	They're ever so popular. We sell a lot of them. 
*DIN:	One point five Q T it's got on there. Quarts is it? One point five? 
*GIN:	Quarts? One point five quarts. 
*DIN:	What's that in English? ((laugh))  
*GIN:	Well one quart is two pints. And a half a quart is one pint. 
*DIN:	Right. 
*GIN:	That'd make it the three pints. 
*VIC:	So you'd want the next one up wouldn't you?  That would be that one. 
*DIN:	 Well it's a three  or four pints she's after. It's probably a four    (  )   
*GIN:	 It doesn't  look big enough. Are you sure it says one point five quarts? 
*DIN:	Well it says it on there somewhere. 
*VIC:	 (  ) one point five quart. 
*GIN:	Well. Perhaps it's   (.) perhaps they hold more than you think they do. 
*DIN:	I don't know. (  ) . 
*GIN:	What do you think Dinda? Should I take this one?  While   
*DIN:	 Erm   
*GIN:	they've still got it. It's the last one. 
*DIN:	It's not chipped or anything is it? 
*GIN:	No. (.)  
*DIN:	 (  ) I've got my hands full and you've got your hands full. (.)  
*GIN:	Three pint. See we might not get one more in before Christmas. 
*VIC:	I'll ask Gill and Maureen 
*GIN:	Mm. 
*VIC:	 (  ) take that but then if you, if you really don't think that will hold what you want then you'll have to bring it back. 
*GIN:	It's a, it's a, it's a Christmas present  (  ) . 
*VIC:	Oh I see yeah. Ah. 
*GIN:	Three to four pints she said. 
*DIN:	That looks   (.) yeah looking at it 
*VIC:	 I think it   (  )   
*GIN:	 It's quite  capacious, actually. 
*VIC:	Yeah.  (.) I think 
*GIN:	It's a nice dish. 
*VIC:	Have you   (.) we haven't got a measuring jug. 
*GIN:	Haven't got any what? 
*VIC:	That is right isn't it? One pint is 
*GIN:	Well a quart is two pints. 
*VIC:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	And point five of a quart is one pint. That makes it three pints. Why they can't put three pints on instead of one point five  quarts  . 
*VIC:	 But does she  want a three to four one? If she wants a three to four you gotta have the next size up. 
*GIN:	Three stroke four 
*DIN:	Well she said   (.) three or four. 
*VIC:	 Oh I see. 
*GIN:	 so obviously  she was easy about the size. 
*DIN:	I think that would be ample cos usually there's only  two of them   
*GIN:	 There's only two of them, yes   
*DIN:	to eat anything you know  (  )  
*GIN:	yes, yes.  True. 
*DIN:	 Yeah I think  we should grab it while we see it  actually. 
*GIN:	 I think we  should too.  It'll be half the price it is in Boot's Cookshop  . 
*DIN:	  ((laugh)) Do you want me   (.) Do you want me to drop it  or should you drop it? 
*VIC:	I don't know. 
*GIN:	 ((laugh)) Do you remember Jackie, he used to be 
*VIC:	 (  ) another one look. 
*GIN:	Yes. And that that one holds quite a lot 
*VIC:	  (  )  
*DIN:	 No. No. 
*GIN:	Do you remember Jackie? He used to be dark haired and worked in the   (.) toy shop in Sandhurst. 
*DIN:	Yes I do. 
*GIN:	Yeah I thought you would. 
*DIN:	 (  )  I knew the face. 
*GIN:	 Used to go in for your  model paints and   (.) coloured marbles 
*VIC:	That's right, yeah. 
*DIN:	There you go.  Long time, long time ago. 
*VIC:	 All those years I was there   
*GIN:	 You haven't, haven't changed  . You haven't changed. I mean your face I knew straight out. It was your hair that got me. 
*VIC:	Well the grey come through and I was just sort of I thought I can't wait all those years   (.) with dark hair. I had a friend who had long hair and she, she let it grow right the way through. And for nearly seven years she looked like an old woman of eighty. 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*VIC:	And I thought I am not gonna have that. 
*GIN:	Well that's right. I agree with you. 
*VIC:	So   (  ) I more or less had a crew cut. 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*VIC:	And er of course it's still grey now 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*VIC:	except like this bit here which er grows    (  )   
*GIN:	 I know, oh yes it always grows a dark bit. 
*VIC:	but that all took   (.) I think, when you're older   (.) when you go grey it's, it, you look softer and you get away with the grey coming through on white hair. 
*GIN:	Yes. That's right. 
*VIC:	But on dark hair. I mean for years when I was young I was jet black and that was lovely. 
*GIN:	Yes.  That's right. You were. 
*VIC:	 I never had to touch it or nothing.  But when you start going grey you look so 
*GIN:	It's pepper and salt then. 
*VIC:	And your skin changes. I used to be right tanned skin. And that, that even changes as you get older. 
*DIN:	Yeah that's right. 
*GIN:	Yes well I, I was very fair to start with. 
*VIC:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	And then it began to get a bit darker. Not my eyelashes and eyebrows they're silver.  Always silver.  (.) Absolutely silver. 
*VIC:	  (  ) Mine are   (.) yeah, dark still. 
*GIN:	But my, I thought no I'm not gonna go pepper and salt. 
*VIC:	That's right yeah. 
*GIN:	I don't mind going silver. 
*VIC:	That's right. 
*GIN:	This is natural silver on the temples. 
*VIC:	That's right. Yeah, like, look here you see look. 
*GIN:	Yes, yes you've got a silver. 
*VIC:	I mean I've got, I mean I don't mind this but   (.) why shouldn't you do it? And my friend she looked about eighty    (  )   
*GIN:	 Yes I couldn't agree with you more   
*VIC:	 (  ) but she still looks old for her age. 
*GIN:	Yes. My best friend was your colouring and she always has a   (  ) rinse. It's her husband. She said I don't mind going grey but, but Paddy objects because he says it makes him feel old. 
*VIC:	Oh. But the  thing is   
*GIN:	 He' my colouring. 
*VIC:	also as well when you're black and you touch it up black when you're old you look hard. 
*GIN:	Yes. They usually say go paler. 
*VIC:	 (  ) yeah. 
*GIN:	They usually say go to chestnut rather than keep to black. Mm. 
*VIC:	Actually I wish I'd gone like this years ago  cos you get   
*GIN:	 Yes. 
*VIC:	you know much more fun  than when you   (  )   
*GIN:	  ((laugh)) You reckon?  I don't know cos I've never been brunette, Jackie. So I wouldn't know love. 
*VIC:	 ((laugh)) Oh yeah, I think, I think it's because I   (.) I had that severe hair style   (  )  I think, you know I looked hard. 
*GIN:	 Well I was severe. I had a severe style. 
*VIC:	That's right. You always had yours    (  ) didn't you? 
*GIN:	 The neat pleat mm. 
*VIC:	Yeah that's right yeah. 
*GIN:	Mm the neat pleat. But it was lovely for parties  with a black velvet bow and   (.) sequins down the back. 
*VIC:	 Oh yeah. I loved it yeah. Well when you go on holiday  swimming. Everyone was upstairs rolling up their hair 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*VIC:	and  (  ) . And you could swim, just dry it and then just pull it back.  (  ) big scarf and you were made weren't you? 
*GIN:	 Yes. That's right. Yeah. That's right.  Yeah it was very useful. 
*VIC:	Yeah. 
*DIN:	Right. 
*GIN:	Right. 
*DIN:	We will go round this way or round that way? 
*GIN:	Cor look at that bas   oh no it's fine   
*VIC:	 She ain't got that problem yet. You wait till   
*GIN:	No. 
*VIC:	She's probably saying oh this is so boring this conversation but when she gets to our age that'll be the same. 
*DIN:	  ((laugh))  
*GIN:	 Well   (.) well she'll just  she'll just go silver. She was silver when she was little so   (.) I suppose she'll go back to silver. Anything else you want to look at Dinda? 
*DIN:	No I don't think so. It's probably about quarter to  (  )  
*GIN:	Yes I expect it probably is. Hello love. We'll grab this casserole because   (.) erm 
*DIN:	Hopefully I won't  (  )  
*GIN:	what's her name wasn't sure if you'd get any more in of the next size up so 
*UNK:	Right. 
*GIN:	I thought better grab it while it's there. 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*GIN:	It's much, it holds much more than you'd think doesn't it? 
*UNK:	Yeah, they hold quite, yeah they do these, don't they? Yeah.   (  ) just put it in a bag for you. 
*DIN:	  (  ) seven pounds   (  )   
*GIN:	So's   (.) so's people don't think we've nicked it.  (.) Mind you they   (.) they know we haven't nicked it.  (.) Sorry my love, you want? 
*UNK:	Seven please.  (  ) come back has it? 
*GIN:	Mm.  (.) I'm counting, I'm counting five   (.) isn't it silly they put on there one point five quarts? 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	They couldn't put on three, three pints. 
*UNK:	No, no. Yeah, that's right  (  )  
*UNK:	European import. 
*GIN:	Next week when I come in you'll have the next size up.
