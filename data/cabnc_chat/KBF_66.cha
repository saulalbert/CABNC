*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	she was doing so well in the church and she died of cancer.She had cancer and it was cured and they, you know, they said, well were pretty certain that your clear but I'm afraid you've got to wait five years, four years and six months after they said that, it hit her again and she died.
*BRE:	Oh god, it's awful in it?
*JEA:	Mm, mm, it is.
*BRE:	And is it Marg the one who had the friend in America, or was that Jacky?
*JEA:	That's right,

*BRE:	Does she come up to you?
*JEA:	Yes, she comes up by train.
*BRE:	Has she never wanted to learn to drive then?
*JEA:	No  (.) 
*BRE:	I can't understand women that haven't learnt to drive, can you?
*JEA:	 [yawning] No, I can't, I really can't  [] .
*BRE:	Because there's always been an opport , I mean even if your sort of poor, there's always the opportunity, I mean I learnt to drive and then the driving instructor erm, lived next door to my mother saying, it, at the time it should of been three pound and erm, he let us have it for two pound
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	I mean that was what, twenty one I was, so, thirteen years ago
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	erm, and it's about what twelve pound now, eleven pound?
*JEA:	Er I paid thirteen pounds, ninety.
*BRE:	Yeah, god.
*JEA:	You might well say.
*BRE:	How many years, I mean, that's in thirteen, that's a pound a year, it's gone up.
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	Good god it's a lot of money in it?
*JEA:	It is.
*BRE:	But even the test is dear isn't it now on the actual day.
*JEA:	Seventeen I think it is, seventeen, I'm not sure.
*BRE:	I thought it was more than that.
*JEA:	Maybe, maybe more, perhaps it's seventeen with the provisional licence.But you may reckon that anything to do with 
*BRE:	But that was a pound .
*JEA:	I know.
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) , but wasn't it free when you had it?Was it
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	No, it wasn't, you had to pay.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	I know with mine it was a pound and, I renewed mine for two years, well three years I think I never drove, I just wanted to have a provisional, but now, I think like if someone said it was fifteen or seventeen
*JEA:	Mm, mm, mm , yes I think it's seventeen.
*BRE:	I don't know if that's, what's that to stop encouraging the children just to buy it.
*JEA:	No, it's the general audacity of the tax system, which was to, to ripe money of us so that it can give us   (        ) we can spend our money on rubbishing layabouts.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	I mean, deserving cases like Neil who as he says only want to be taught, get next to nothing, but it seems to me that people like your sister Jane and Trevor get given the earth.
*BRE:	Well it, well something's wrong somewhere isn't it?
*JEA:	I think so.
*BRE:	And then
*JEA:	They shall never know what.
*BRE:	There's the systems   (.) oh I, I told you didn't I Jane got eh reported.
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	Cos erm, apparently erm Trevor was working for Bettaware for Avon and they had the Social Services round to say that I hear that your working and they do toy parties   (.) and they said no, I mean there not making a living out of it, it's was just
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	you know   (        ) .
*JEA:	The odd few pounds yes.
*BRE:	And erm they said well you've got to come off it, you know, were not going to do you this time, but you've got to come straight, stop doing it all, erm, cos you've been reported and your on the Social Security.
