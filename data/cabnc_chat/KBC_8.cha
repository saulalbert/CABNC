*GOR:	She went to see chiropractors, you know when 
*AUD:	Yeah. Oh heck! And that is bad news! What, did she mention anything about the card? 
*GOR:	No, I didn't. 
*AUD:	And didn't you? 
*GOR:	No.  (6.0) I'm not having it er   (.) she didn't do the, when she said to me I want to speak to you about it, she said, you know, she wasn't involving me at all was she? 
*AUD:	No. I'm thinking of writing myself you know, to Karen. 
*GOR:	Oh no you can't do  that! 
*AUD:	 I, I  can. 
*GOR:	Because I don't mind if Karen writes and bloody blames us   (.) that it's our bloody fault, I'm not bothered. 
*AUD:	No, I just feel that er 
*GOR:	You don't wanna  do that. 
*AUD:	 I mean  we 
*GOR:	It'll upset her that. 
*AUD:	she's obviously er very upset, and I, I mean, I just don't want that, she's such a nice girl. You know, like I really don't   (.) I, I just thought perhaps a note from me   (.) you know, apologizing. 
*GOR:	Why not, (  ) get a note from Karen apologizing for being a, I had the hump. 
*AUD:	 ((sighing)) Yeah . I thought, well a note from both of us really. 
*GOR:	Well I don't think she, and she, Karen wouldn't want that because   (.) well it, it's nothing to do with us. Is it? We're sticking our er oar in where we shouldn't. And so the other    (6.0)  ((talking from other room))he's there if you want isn't he? I mean 
*AUD:	Well I know that. 
*GOR:	You can't stick your oar in like that to her at any old time can you, really? 
*AUD:	No. 
*GOR:	Well you could have stuck, you know, seven or eight years of age you couldn't even do it then in case it hurt the kid's mother or something like that, or whatever it was.  (6.0) She's nearly an adult. Well and truly! Getting an old man now, never mind  (  ) . 
*AUD:	Well I know that. I know, but 
*GOR:	Well it's, it's not our, it's not our er, we'll be just sticking our nose in where it's not  necessarily wanted. 
*AUD:	 Yes but it  was our mistake in the first place. 
*GOR:	Well it wasn't really was it? Obviously, I mean I know you're arguing with her but er   (.) but if he'd, if he'd have go  if we got a christian name that night it wouldn't have gone down as either of those   (.) Karen or   (.) Fran. 
*AUD:	I know well we could have found out   (.) quite  easily. 
*GOR:	 Oh  aye. That's a different story. Yes. We could have found out. We could have phoned Amy and found out there and then virtually, but I think we said oh, I, summat like i  i  it's not worth bothering about, don't matter just put  (  ) . 
*AUD:	But it did matter didn't it? 
*GOR:	It did matter but we didn't know that at the time did we? 
*AUD:	Oh no we didn't. 
*GOR:	It'll be worse now, in retrospect, it'll worse   (.) phoning Amy up at that moment   (.) and asking what the name was. And he could have put it down while he was here. Cos he didn't know the name that night  (  ) . 
*AUD:	Oh I know he didn't. I know that. But the thing was, what I, what I was ge   ((door bell))getting to last night, is that we didn't bring the name into it, the surname.  (7.0) Get out! ((laugh))
