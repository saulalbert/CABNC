@Comment:	conversation #12 (Tape 029101)
*PHI:	Shoppers creche  that must  er, registered. •0305_3545•
        What does registration mean? •5295_7055•
        It means that when you go along to the social services, register and it's above board  children's work that you are doing. •7385_14785•
        But they have a right  within the law  to carry out, to check all persons who are offering help in caring. •15695_25875•
        And registration may be denied anyone who has been convicted of any certain types of offense. •27205_36175•
        It's the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that all those leading groups  are people of good standing. •36175_45125•
        The church must make every effort to  achieve the highest standards. •47365_52815•
        And the church as  bible road to fame  in alerting us to  our responsibilities. •53835_60325•
        Now there's one thing that I have to alert us all to  the rest may not have been important, perhaps only to some of  the larger churches  but groups are advised  and churches are advised to make sure that in buildings that are used  ah, for many different groups  that young children under the age of eight  do not come into contact with any casual  people who may be using that building. •61495_95335•
        Now that is quite an implication when you think about it! •96705_101345•
        There is need to emphasise the importance of  encouraging people to , receive some sort of training when they come forward and offer to be involved  in the work of our under eights and young people. •104415_121675•
        I don't think there's any need for me to spell out any more at this point what that may mean  but the  responsibility in  as churches to ensure that we care for the under eights. •123025_134345•
        I will, in fact erm  answer any questions afterwards. •134345_139595•
*UNK:	Thank you Nanette. •141165_141765•
        An introduction that is important. •141765_143165•
        There are  a number , of areas in the state legislation that have been aligned to the church, or will affect the running of the church. •143955_148495•
        One is the children act  one will be something on  on on the  preparation of food, another will be one affecting the way in which  charities have to keep  registered accounts  er, financial accounts  which means that  an example  erm   is responsible  for registering the accounts of congregations  by law. •149225_175245•
        And another will be  erm  the responsibility to  er, the minister, the  alterations to listed buildings  which  might be landed on the, on the churches. •175245_187365•
        What Nanette has said has been an important introduction and if , if what you have prepared altogether  is legible then perhaps  give it to Eileen and it can go out in the Synod papers  that will be helpful. •188695_198185•
        Erm, and in the faith and life  department of URC we'd better preparing a pack on the children rights. •201425_208295•
        Other information on whatever . •208685_213525•
        We move now   we move now to er, faith and life  is on  we're on page  thirty five. •214395_221655•
        moderator and friends  of faith and life. •228375_235045•
        In the very short  space of time that we have  available this afternoon  there are three subjects that I need  simply to bring to the attention of Synod. •235155_245825•
        The first the little report  under the heading of faith and life, on page five  of your reports  the  second  is the report of the provincial advocate which is on page six  and the third, the report of the Youth Secretary which is on page twenty. •247645_267555•
        Erm  all those because subjects come under the general umbrella of faith and life, and I think  er, moderator, probably the correct thing is to do  is to be formal and to begin by  er, proposing that these three reports be received for discussion. •268875_286025•
*UNK:	Then I'll receive the reports of faith and life  and the  Youth Secretary and  the new secretary for discussion, yes. •287095_295365•
*UNK:	Thank you. •296135_296595•
        Er, to take then  first the report which you will find on page five  you will see that faith and life on this occasion has concentrated on one subject  and that is our   •296595_307395•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	weekend that we are  arranging this summer as we have done annually for a number of years. •308865_313975•
        Er, there is a  a little orange leaflet which has been placed on the seats  during the day  that many of you, I hope, already have  er, for anyone who hasn't  may I  perhaps place these  on the front table, there's a  , there's another supply over there and, could I please ask that  some responsible representative from each district would please take a few more of these away with you so that they are distributed in district meetings  in the near future, and attention drawn to them there  er, if there are not enough copies  er, then I'm sure the provincial office on receiving a, a request from you will make sure there's more   that passed on to you. •314505_358085•
        Now, if you had an opportunity of glancing at the leaflet already you will have seen that the leader  for this July's  er,weekend is is Mr Henry   and, I don't think I can do any better than to spend two minutes of the time that we've got in asking Henry if he would  say a word or two of introduction to the theme  for this year. •359545_379547•
*UNK:	Ignatius of Loyal er or    er, more  properly known  to me in church history was the scourge of the wrath of the, of the council of reformation and  inside of consumism but  I think regards some years ago in  on Ignatius spirituality of  bibles  which I'm delighted to see John has mentioned in his prologue for the er  for his introduction to Holywell the the the association's there  came to discover who  Saint Ignatius  er, helping to sort of tap greater spiritual depths and er  resources  and consequently trained as spiritual director  er  in Ignatian things. •387647_424377•
        The spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyala have once, were once described as a sort of a spiritual  from which people of past   men, put together again. •425527_434677•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Erm  that is not the aim of Trabecca  •435207_440327•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Er, to start off with they do the full spiritual exercise of Ignatius Loyal all takes thirty days in silent retreat  with a  with an individual  er  under individual guidance with a, with a, a director  or  it could take anything from nine months to eighteen months to do  in er living  in open sort of retreat. •440667_462027•
        What I hope to do is simply  to share with you the life of Idigo and in experiences  and to walk alongside him  and also to help us reflectively to look  and examine our own journey  where are we with God? •463997_480667•
        Where's God in our life, where has he been and where is he directing us? •481117_484797•
        And so it'll be a gentle, I hope and  er, reflective  type of weekend  and er  using some of the tools of Ignatius  and other tools, cos Ignatius was very  er, adaptable  er, you know in  in methods of prayer  and reflection and contemplation. •485587_504157•
        I,. •506317_506617•
*UNK:	Thank you. •511777_512147•
        And I I, I hope that I, I hope there's a good variety of people will again, as you always have done  will turn up  er, this year to share fellowship  , on this  theme which er, is  is a refresh theme I think for, for many of us. •512147_525637•
        Now, the other two subjects I'm really only dealing because the  people responsible are, are not  here in the flesh this afternoon  but Alyd  the provincial advocate and I I think of Bill  that's also gone too, er yes he he has, he has had to leave  this afternoon. •527657_546290•
        Erm, so what I promised to do in er  er, a moment or two if people are to ask specific questions or comments to make  arising from either of those  printed reports on page six and page twenty  erm, if you would make your point or ask your question  now  er, it will be recorded and transmitted to the officers responsible and they will take any necessary action or give any  reverent replies to those questions. •546290_577610•
        This doesn't preclude any private questions in conversation with those people at any stage during the life of the church. •579380_584920•
        So if, if there are any formal concerns that anybody would wish to bring  formally  before Synod and erm to either  Alyd  or Bill  then perhaps  state them. •585990_598580•
        Right. •600880_601000•
*UNK:	Right, yes I shall happy to convey to the moderator that Synod was er  totally satisfied with the reports that are here before me and give them one hundred percent support in the work . •604440_612970•
        Thank you. •613260_613560•
*UNK:	Bill  is  is erm  with the group of young people who are  having a weekend in . •616430_622805•
        Er, those were the people that  walked in and walked out! •623365_627375•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	We come now to the final committee report which is on page thirteen  of the  page thirteen. •628105_631795•
        Did you want to stand up for a minute? •631795_634555•
*PHI:	Yes. •634955_635055•
*UNK:	 (        )

        No. •667175_667455•
        Well it's very simple, who knows the Peruvian Glory? •667795_670255•
*UNK:	Woops! •671475_671795•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Will you please come here with me. •672365_673385•
        Erm, who else knows it? •673385_674905•
*UNK:	 (        )

        Anybody else know it? •677195_677965•
        So this is how it goes. •677965_679545•
*UNK:	I think so! •679645_680305•
*UNK:	I think it goes  I'm not sure. •680515_684205•
*UNK:	Have we got an organ in here? •686005_690195•
*PHI:	Yes, I think . •690195_691355•
*UNK:	 ((cough))  ((organ music))
*UNK:	Okay, sing that. •691445_692275•
*UNK:	Glory to God, Glory to God  •692825_696935•
*UNK:	Right. •696965_697265•
*UNK:	That's glory in the highest. •698475_702665•
*UNK:	glory in the highest  •702665_705365•
*UNK:	The next line is to God be glory forever. •705365_710135•

*UNK:	and the rest of you will be the people. •745975_750055•

        So the  sings the first line  erm  you know, Glory to God  glory to God in highest  and then you respond  and then you sing  to God be the glory, to God be the glory  and you respond. •751845_762985•
        And then you sing  halleluja  and we all sing halleluja, halleluja, halleluja  okay? •763785_768715•
*UNK:	Glory to God, •770115_771615•

*UNK:	Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest, Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest, to God be glory forever, to God be glory forever, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen . •823295_849575•
*UNK:	High notes! •849645_850175•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Very good! •850175_850425•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Well I must admit I'm gonna have to  present a  finance report which is received by an overture. •850425_857665•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	And  first of all  before we er  we put the reports we , there are a number of er, there's one alteration and a number of er, additions  obviously alteration or I should say a an amendment is something  an important place on page fifteen  er, at the tope of the page referring to  December nineteen ninety two  I've put, which is agreed by GP committee  with the exception of young  these representatives, that we ask them to bring thirty pounds towards the cost  that should be twenty five. •858205_906465•
        That's the actual figure. •907935_909965•
        Erm  one difficulty with with  giving a financial report is so many things seem to  happen quickly  and a erm  apart from the fact that there was a, a major finance resources comes from   , as well you see  that I have to tell you now  these have been done  on the  red letter assembly side  and you may want to alter one  there  er  according to reform  I see the cost per  erm  person attending  is not a hundred and twelve pounds, but a hundred and fourteen pounds  and that means that we have forty representatives we've got to try and find four thousand five hundred and sixty . •910265_949415•
        Now, I hope I've got these facts right and I'm sure  that not, that Eileen may correct me that er  we have er forty hundred pounds in the budget,budget  for this  er the erm South Wales congregation  has, has kindly  erm  given us grant of a thousand pounds  and I understand from the secretary of , Cardiff congregation , and he's also offered a thousand pounds  I don't know whether  we've got that yet? •951215_979875•
        But then   •981505_982255•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	That will be, it is thousand so that's er  that's three thousand four hundred  short of a four by sixty. •983085_988925•
        And what the difference is that  er, we thought that you could have one young person per district  and that they only have to pay thirty two pounds each, but I think these are only purely •988955_997795•
*UNK:	Yes, er, I have them  for those who  received that incorrect information from me, I must apologise  erm  young people who are going  as delegates  as representatives of their district must be treated  as adult  representatives and they have to pay full price. •997795_101927•
        Er  for  , for people who are going to  group  and and, for any young people who are going observers  there are special arrangements to be made which doesn't relate to our official represented district, I'm sorry about that! •101927_102885•
*UNK:	So that means that er, in  the total we do have to pay  in some way or another, is four thousand pounds with sixty  but we'll say  we've already got three thousand four hundred, if all the , forty people go and they pay twenty five pounds each, that's another thousand, so we've got a  I think I've got it right,, we're only a hundred and sixty short. •102893_105100•
        Fairly reasonable! •105352_105418•
        I hope we get that from somewhere. •105418_105748•
        So er er that  that is if we're up-to-date on the financial . •105781_105964•
        Now, the most  er, serious business  the er, Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety two  and the Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety three. •106016_106783•
        At the meeting  er, of the  Financial Resources Committee that I attended on Wednesday  the first thing we discussed was the  er  the giving so far, up to the end of February  from the various provinces  and we, by the end of February  er, the total was up to thirty thousand pounds less than we required  er  which could mean that  the end of the year  it could be a hundred and eighty thousand pounds less than required  but  er  of all the   •106797_110338•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	all the provinces, bar one  have balances which could be used to make that up, so  the money is fairly short and we're bear  er, for pains, the   •110356_111441•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	ten and a half thousand  from the first of July onwards for this year. •111473_112050•
        Now  erm  in Wales, and I'm sorry to say, our figure  er, we should of produced ninety thousand pounds  and we , er, produced  er, eighty three thousand two hundred and nine  that means we are  er, six thousand eight hundred down in two months! •112091_113770•
        Now, we have a balance as it already tells you  er, in er earlier in the paragraph of this paper that that we had a er balance of sixteen thousand pounds  , in the  ministry last year  so, if we knock sixteen thousand pounds   •113862_115479•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	what we're likely to  be short of  it seems to me we could end up being twenty four thousand pounds short at the end of the year. •115525_116392•
        Now, there are quite a number of reasons for this  and the good news, I think, that I bought good news again this morning  is that presentations both about budgets  er, and about what we do with the small churches  is, er, could be some of our salvation. •116402_118208•
        Question of budgets  our   I was almost  said halleluja! •118224_118726•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	If only, all our churches could do that  we would really be getting somewhere! •118796_119342•
        The biggest problem of all  is that we can't look forward  and that a lot of the problems, being problems are happening now, and happened since  the er  the first of January  that should of happened  they should of happened in , in , in the er at least the three months before the end of last year, if not more! •119342_121071•
        So, er, we're getting people saying it's impossible to pay this  even though they were asked if they could pay it  at the the the time it was given  sometime last July. •121109_122217•
        Well that's one  the other reason, of course we have got  a large number of , very small churches  in fact, looking at our , ministry figures nineteen ninety  there were thirty churches that didn't pay anything to the maintenance  and a lot of these, I think, maybe   •122238_123917•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	that both  Gethwyn and Russell sorted out  er  who up  on on those extremes that  you get in a group  that, that maybe feel they that they really have nothing to, hardly anything to do with us  they've don't receive ministry  and why should that be, and after be asked each year, has to go up? •123980_125833•
        And they see  I just wonder whether they just pile letters in the wastepaper basket! •125854_126283•
        And therefore, if it can really come to this possibility of ministry  a sort of, Young Farmers Club idea of getting themselves about  that could be  a a a a, a, a marvellous boost. •126291_127522•
        So, the, the other thing which is er erm, a real problem, partly because of that, is, is when one talks about an increase in  in giving, increase in percentage , or a contribution of the church is  in er, we were talking about twenty percent , twenty one percent last year  that would be alright if everybody gave twenty one percent! •127614_129597•
        Those who did nothing, they can , easily increase their giving by twenty one percent, it's still the same! •129742_130234•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	It means  that the other people have to give more  that's why some of the churches, I think they've found that their  er, requests for their er  er  their er contributions, have gone up enormously! •130244_131392•
        So, er, those are the , those are a lot of the problems that we are, we are facing  now, will we really  er  will we end up at twenty four thousand down at the end of the year? •131392_132707•
        That , all I can say is that my, that's my best guess at the moment. •132725_132963•
        We know there are some churches which er, will probably only pay quarterly, so they haven't paid yet, so that's money that's coming in. •133054_133641•
        On the other hand we know there are some churches that are finding great difficulty in meeting  er, what they've said they can  •133674_134251•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	and are doing their best to do it. •134251_134403•
        So that's on the down side. •134403_134586•
        So  er, at the moment they're saying  all I can see  is that er, we would have to use up the whole of our balance, that's sixteen thousand  and the twenty four thousand arrears. •134586_135732•
        Now, that as the picture  er, leads me onto the next er, stage which is what in ministry, er what can we do in nineteen ninety three? •135743_136929•
        Erm  a letter was sent to all district secretaries, who I think in , most cases sent these round to churches to see if we could get some idea from you as to what sort of increase in contributions could be possible for nineteen ninety three. •136948_138230•
        That's quite difficult to do because where there's so many churches not being sure whether they're going to make it this year  how can they say what's going to happen next year? •138271_139165•
        On the other hand  er, if we did what our friend from Cheltenham is doing  we would have , we would be looking forward like that all the time  we would have some idea. •139165_140028•
        Now, I'm pleased to say we have had quite a number of  of er  replies from churches  on what they think they can , do. •140081_140930•
        On the other hand, some of these er  are good  positive replies and some of them, some are negative! •140957_141699•
        And, it seemed to me  that when I, as the er  your representative on Provincial Finance Committee is asked to make a , commitment for this, for this   for  er  for nineteen ninety three I could say no better than what we had as out target this year and  that was hard! •141706_143561•
        Cos clearly we've only er  reached something like five hundred, three thousand, four thousand  er  then it's gonna be a  a big jump to get to the five hundred and forty! •143590_144627•
        Now, nobody er  er,at this stage at the er  Financial Resources Committee er, challenge us on this figure, I think we will just  stage of  of doing arithmetic of adding it up, but no doubt that the staff will be  comparing what going to be, er what within a  but have prepared  for next year with what we're supposed to do this year  and ours is an increase of another percent. •144734_146979•
        We look at all the other conferences, the lowest after that was the Northern Provence which is in a very similar position to ourselves  and they were offering a five percent increase. •147024_147937•
        Er, a few others were offering seven to nine  and most of the others were offering between ten and fifteen percent. •148066_148660•
        So we're way down on all the others!so, that then falls three hundred thousand pound short  of what is required to  er, give ministers an increase to twelve thousand next year. •148668_150036•
        There seem to be  our two groups er, in one of our provinces  and they say that the rich and poor but the rich  er er are not so rich and others  . •150050_151468•
        That, in fact, er  there are three provinces who are already now contributing more than anyone else  that, they feel that the churches should go forward to try and raise the minister's  to what was proposedly that the  assembly last year, they should be paid thirteen thousand two hundred  but in order to do that  see another six hundred thousand pound raised  and it is likely that this will be put as a challenge to the churches  at assembly. •151493_154339•
        Now  if I could just remind you of what's happened at the Lyndford Haven er  er, Synod, last March  erm, the Financial Committee have suggested that we should go for a target of five hundred and ten thousand  but  er, this is  we are not gonna be able to  even start looking at the eleven and a half thousand if if er  all the provinces do it for months and more  and we, I think very bravely or foolishly whatever way you , look at it, proposed that we should got to five hundred and forty thousand  and it looks as thought we're gonna end up  certainly nearer to five ten than five forty. •154351_157957•
        Erm, but if we er are are going to  ensure that ministers can get  er, at least twelve a  of twelve thousand next year then we have to er  erm  there has to be further offers from provinces. •158102_159503•
        As I say, there are three provinces who'd like to go further  and than that be even  er, more increases. •159561_160202•
        Now, I have  put down reports  about the finance committee  er  as it were but I think the responses from the churches and districts   sort of calculator will be there, we think that it would seem as though we should only offer the same amount as last year. •160202_162203•
        But, I think if we have further discussions with churches and districts that we might see that we can break that  a bit further  for that reason when we come to  er, come to the resolutions I would advise you  er er propose a minor amendment with the second thing. •162203_165412•
        But I think that  er . •165412_165644•
*UNK:	We can now receive this report for the . •165644_165816•
        Any questions or comments on  paragraphs that are not erm  relating to those ? •165816_166225•
        So any questions or comments on paragraph one  on page thirteen? •166225_166609•
        Or paragraph two  or paragraph three  or paragraph five  or paragraph  that's it! •166609_167909•
        Yes. •168013_168027•
        So, if there are no questions or comments on those paragraphs  erm we move to the other resolutions. •168134_168709•
*UNK:	be amended ? •168709_169152•
*UNK:	I think so, yes. •169174_169287•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Yes. •169287_169296•
*UNK:	Er, what I would like to propose  the erm  that resolution two of course, was put down  at the time it had to be put down er, and is clearly going to be affected by, that it happened at the  the financial services  in March  and what I have suggested  is that you might prefer this be a a a second resolution  it is or  and turn to the  to add on the end of that resolution  thus urging local churches to through their consultations with district treasurers and finance committee  to increase their contributions to the Ministry of Mission Fund in nineteen ninety three in such a way that provincial , commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two . •169382_174074•
        But , the thing is that it looks as though it is going to be a fairly ongoing thing that's going to  it may be well on  certainly  er a  beyond assembly when we have to come to a conclusion, and therefore we ought to know the picture er, of, within reform churches far more clearly in giving more time. •174173_176268•
        But, clearly we need to have the authority that the  that er  to having discussed  to  a form of . •176316_177284•
*UNK:	And, If I understand this now •177599_177740•
*UNK:	Mm. •177752_177765•
*UNK:	er, we have a choice  the resolution before us,endorse the action taken by the provincial treasurer  in the level of commitment he has made to the MMF fund in nineteen ninety three on behalf of the . •177797_179128•
        And that commitment which Alan has made, I'm right Alan? •179128_179331•
*UNK:	Yes. •179331_179343•
*UNK:	Is a nought percent increase •179401_179490•
*UNK:	It's nought percent. •179490_179545•
*UNK:	over our commitment. •179545_179651•
        Erm  would you like to take that resolution first  and make this a sort of a, an extra resolution  •179891_180606•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Right, okay then. •180606_180656•
        I think that will be  that will be clearer. •180656_180981•
        First of all if we debate now whether or not the Synod endorses the action taken by judicial moderator •181078_181605•
*UNK:	Treasurer. •181675_181696•
*UNK:	in the level of commitment he has made to the MMF fund of nineteen ninety three on behalf of the provence  and we now know  that that's  a commitment, was a commitment of a nought percent increase. •181749_182833•
        We'll debate that first. •182833_183087•
*UNK:	It's gotta be done first. •183102_183930•
*PHI:	Mm? •183941_183954•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	David? •183954_183960•
*ENA:	Can I just clarify •183992_184084•
*UNK:	Stand up please! •184084_184209•
*ENA:	David , can I just clarify that this resolution now supersedes  what is said in the report? •184209_185082•
*UNK:	No, er   we're proposing  that we just do, take this , in other words, if you endorse the fact that I say I I committed the •185082_185993•
*ENA:	But what do you say about  •186110_186238•
*UNK:	Yes. •186238_186267•
*ENA:	the ones you've written down? •186267_186327•
*UNK:	Yeah, that's right, yes. •186327_186457•
*UNK:	The, because  this report has been written  •186482_186669•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	three or four weeks ago  before Alan was able to vet all the information. •186669_186980•
        And in view of the information he had when he went to London for a meeting last Wednesday  and that was when he  consulted with other people  deciding that he should offer a nought percent increase. •186980_188277•
        Okay? •188422_188457•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	So  that's right. •188475_188630•
        Erm, one can then •188704_188815•
*UNK:	. •_•
*UNK:	perhaps cure  the provincial credit   brought to us . •188900_189498•
        And following that recommendation  we accepted a rash  amendment on the floor  of . •189498_190473•
        Increasing the commitment with the treasurer     and  not to be rash with it  but the people understand   people who are mostly killed in churches and   and either way    should not pass to amend a resolution for the Council . •190473_193804•
        You're not with it ! •193804_194017•
*UNK:	at the er   the ministry  but maybe the ministry er  will be . •194017_194499•
*ENA:	Could we not have er  I think procedure is  could we not have the er er  resolution for the  at first and now that a ministry is in motion? •194576_195542•
*UNK:	Erm  I think we need to endorse the action taken by the judicial treasurer  and then  if we was then to go onto  second bits, which is urging the churches to give  five percent more than that in the past  you could debate that separately. •195789_197604•
        Investigative procedure will follow  and we keep the two things clear  we're making  the  the treasurer is erm  suggesting that this provence of the URC makes no , makes   not to increase. •197650_199174•
        There's no  to increase over this year 's commitment. •199174_199527•
        That's what we've proposed. •199534_199929•
*UNK:	 ((noseblow))
*UNK:	Er  Bob? •199929_199957•
*UNK:	I've got a question on  •200206_200323•
*UNK:	Bob! •200336_200346•
*UNK:	does that mean that  the assessment for each church will remain the same  for a couple of years? •200346_201108•
        Is that the  er, is that the implication? •201125_201342•
*UNK:	Erm •201345_201374•
*UNK:	But does it still need, somehow  •201468_201636•
*UNK:	No, I can't  •201636_201747•
*UNK:	or other if the assessment will increase? •201748_201905•
*UNK:	It will vary because er  erm  er we we remember that we have a formula which will expose to what your  er erm, nominated income was in previous years  what the membership, you know, these have all changed  so it could be  I wouldn't like to say it's exactly the same  could be a bit of a problem! •201941_204111•
*UNK:	But also there you can  ministers  because er churches they count for more than two years  stop being central funds  and therefore, if we had too many  •204192_205095•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	churches that  entered  •205108_205264•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	a third year of vacancy  next year that puts  •205271_205624•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	more of a burden on churches with ministers. •205624_205790•
*UNK:	Mm. •205790_205824•
*UNK:	So it just depends on •205834_205951•
*ENA:	Thank you. •206005_206140•
        May I  ask one more thing? •206441_206487•
*UNK:	By, by very special  •206487_206602•
*ENA:	Oh! •206611_206626•
*UNK:	! •_•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	Erm  in order to meet a commitment which is the same as this year commitment  then last   here increasing last year  because this year's commitment we will not reach this year  therefore, we'll be into deficit! •206626_208740•
        Therefore, to pay  that commitment again the churches must be asked to give more  and ask the treasurer to make a further commitment  and the churches must  find more again! •208894_210123•
        So it can't be the same as in churches  even if it stays in the profit? •210136_210689•
*UNK:	Any other comments? •210824_210908•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	Keep them coming! •210908_211014•
*UNK:	to say  from what we . •211023_211342•
*UNK:	Right. •211342_211348•
*UNK:	Cos I don't mind taking this action  erm, I think the  the thought is that I would like to propose that we have a word with the government. •211417_212168•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Because I think that they  and that we can only say   the same again next year when our own , everything goes up  and, I think it's very sad  that the church can't ! •212235_213742•
*UNK:	Is that a formal  amendment? •213743_214389•
*UNK:	Yes it is. •214434_214587•
*UNK:	Is there a seconder to that formal amendment. •214587_214684•
        Does anybody want to speak for that amendments now? •214826_215051•
        That we add the words with sadness  to the resolution? •215074_215346•
*UNK:	Could I, say also with sadness that in that that, yes things are going up but one thing isn't going up and , that's our membership. •215370_216385•
*UNK:	Yes. •216419_216456•
*UNK:	Mm. •216550_216561•
*UNK:	And that is  as  one of the members of, we have a  I think we can afford to have member on the finance of churches  who are called at the assembly of the URC  who er  •216561_217478•
*UNK:	Good, yes! •217478_217496•
*UNK:	in fact, erm anybody that says a lot of sensible things and says look  if people are asked to  er, to er  increase their giving by nought percent that , it probably means the church might have to be   •217517_218669•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	cos the membership has gone down! •218677_218794•
*UNK:	Mm  mm. •218794_218866•
*UNK:	Thanks. •218866_218874•
*UNK:	Mm mm. •218874_219012•
*UNK:	The amendment to add the word with sadness  to this resolution number two on page sixteen is before you  those in support of the amendment that we add the words with sadness to the resolution please show. •219199_220489•
        And those against the amendment please show. •220621_221053•
        The amendment is carried. •221053_221255•
        So the resolution before us now  is that the Synod endorses  english grammar writing ! •221272_221949•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Synod endorses with sadness the action taken by the provincial treasurer  in the level of commitments  he has made to MMF in nineteen ninety three. •221949_222902•
        We'll be making that resolution. •222902_223089•
        If there are no other further comments  or  questions set before you  would you show if you're in favour of resolution two of page sixteen ? •223277_224352•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	In favour? •224352_224644•
        Those against? •224677_224768•
        We now move to the  erm  sort of, two A which I will now as   and this will be that Synod urges local churches  through their consultations with district treasurers and the finance committee  to , increase their contribution to MMF in nineteen ninety three  in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two budgets  targets sorry! •224774_228291•
        Targets! •228360_228378•
        I'll read it again  that we, that Synod urges local congregations through their consultations with district treasurers and finance committee  to  increase their contributions to MMF in nineteen ninety three  in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by , by at least five percent  over the nineteen ninety two targets. •228420_230954•
        If anybody would like to speak. •231422_231539•
*UNK:	Could I just say a ? •231583_231659•
*UNK:	Yes. •231663_231680•
*UNK:	I think I should while you're putting the words in such a way so it wasn't a  er, it wasn't thought that everybody just increased everything by five percent. •231741_232433•
        But as I say the  the people who did not  five five percent  er, therefore, others may not have given more! •232481_233086•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Others may give less because they've got a lot of members  so that therefore it's  so that the provence as a whole  could be advised. •233199_234187•
        And I would have thought us giving five percent and, and there are other provinces that are giving more will ensure at least the  the  on twelve thousand we pay next year  and therefore, starting with eleven and half thousand we paid this year  and that   provinces  and in ourselves went further than that it is possible . •234204_236212•
*UNK:	Not very good! •236495_236545•
        Surely, John   erm, at home  would like today off fishing! •236708_237738•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	. •_•
        How much longer moderator  can we in the Welsh provence accept  being the poor relationship  within the denominations? •237868_238998•
        Indeed, how much longer can we expect the other provinces to continue carrying us? •239049_239863•
        We are no poorer than some of the •239875_239991•
*UNK:	Mm. •239991_240002•
*UNK:	noble provinces! •240012_240091•
*UNK:	No. •240091_240099•
*UNK:	Because we hear great  erm  shouts,cackulations of joy from those provinces that can afford to increase their giving  shouldn't allow us to sit on our morals! •240242_241440•
        I think it's a great tragedy that Wales  considers itself to be the poor relation  within the United Reform Church  and the answer can only lie within Wales! •241559_242600•
        I can't come , elsewhere  we have to support this motion too! •242600_242905•
*UNK:	Any other comments? •243280_243345•
        The motion is before that Synod urges local churches  through their consultations with district treasurers and the finance committee  to increase their contribution to MMF in nineteen ninety three  in such a way that , that the provincial commitment  may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two targets. •243659_245755•
        For those in favour please show? •245901_246402•
        And those against please show? •246411_246709•
        And that's carried. •246709_246989•
        So we move to resolution three on page  sixteen. •246989_247762•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	I think erm  er  I know there has been some discussion of  I I  about   er  and I put  er, in this report I think all the documentation that the ministers and  ministers that had already seen it  and  I've explained that the big issue is that er  the URC, I think  a weekly account ah of all other informations  has er, worked out very  on the basis of five thousand and I was  been tugging  you pay your car off to get that   and  . •247788_252753•
        The church in Wales  er   and  and from a  a survey of  one church in Church of England  in Hemel Hempstead, I discovered that their rate seemed to be about thirty two P per mile. •253063_254433•
        You've got to work it out on the basis of ten miles  not on the basis of five miles. •254512_254874•
        I think also  er, and this  er, it may be that the er  er URC does not want to be pushed round   er, we got up  er, to how many ministers this applies  but I do know there are quite a number of ministers  which  who need their own cars  and  a a  at the church that pays the  er, insurance, the road license and even something for the maintenance. •255006_257530•
        Now, clearly if you were paid say  six hundred pounds for that  and you only did twelve hundred miles, you're getting fifty P a mile anyway! •257635_258468•
        And they've got, I think the odds are that people are  giving more perhaps  er    and that er, if they were paid at fifty four P per mile  and  and got  how that would affect the churches  er  contributions they make? •258557_260182•
        And therefore, er our proposal is that we should adopt the figures at the bottom of the page which are actually those which the  the er  er, Inland Revenue have recognised in ones where you don't have to  er, put in a tax return for.. for . •260213_262196•
*UNK:	So resolution three isbefore you  for discussion . •262214_262369•

*UNK:	Reading for our , I mean er, I supply my own car, my church  has recognised that  whether I'm   probably if I pay the tax and the insurance   erm  and I just  thirty two, thirty five  that's   but  when I'm in  business or I'm in provinces and I'm allowed to pay what, ten fifteen  •263101_265880•

*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	or be subsidised, you know I mean I think that's  consistency. •266209_266374•
*UNK:	Well I I shall leave you to go through the questions for a few minutes. •266476_266846•
*UNK:	from from , erm I'm rather concerned about what  the  er, provence here is intending to do! •266884_268003•
        Erm, I've worked for ten and a half years within this county of Clwyd as a  social worker, regarded as an extensional   and every year my employers  er, who are based in London would like the county to know what were the recommended mileage  rates  for the reimbursel to a business car mileage? •268003_269733•
        Now, if Clwyd or Gwynedd or any other county for that matter, within Wales or in England  er, decided that in themselves that they would not implement the national recommendation  er, then there duly would be  all hell to pay, and rightly so! •269859_271243•
        And certainly now that of course, ministers don't have a union  unfortunately! •271257_271675•
        Er  •271675_271682•
*UNK:	No. •271682_271717•
*UNK:	they would allow me half   now erm I've been looking at one particular church, one denomination  er, which is the Methodist Church, although it has been said already here this afternoon, or this morning rather  there are an overall erm  joint  style with Methodist and with United Reform Church  and  erm  I have personally the Methodist  of last year, last September  where it gives  and also  erm, mileage recommendations. •271717_274754•
        I'll be viewing the Methodist Church in quite a different way, but I think it's very important for us to be  made aware of how they do it  erm  for example, if you have  erm  a a  or or and I don't think any church has, are provided  within that   and gets  alike. •274755_276533•
        In addition to that you get depreciation  of one thousand one hundred and forty four pound per year  which, by my reckoning is ninety five pound a month  in addition to that, as a Methodist Minister you get a standing charge of five hundred and twenty eight pound per year which is  forty four pound  er, per month  and then  you also through in the year if you have a major repair needed on your car you get a hundred and eight pound  now, if in fact, I had , I have a Vauxhall Nova, and let me take these figures as you are   at twenty four P  a mile, or twenty four point  five P a mile  and if that's all we are recommended, recommending, in other words, there's no lump sum at all er, that would mean that I would be getting forty nine pound  but   Methodist , this colleague in Llandudno if he did •276607_281913•
