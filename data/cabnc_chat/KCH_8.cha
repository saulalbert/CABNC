        I'm taking some ones. •156645_160005•
*PHI:	Oh I see. •160175_163465•
        That's how you set that up to do that is it? •163695_167395•
*DAV:	Yeah. •167395_167665•
*PHI:	Who showed you that? •168205_169255•
*DAV:	Mrs . •169255_169505•
*PHI:	Well I didn't know that. •170025_172461•
        But •172461_172671•
*DAV:	She's getting a job at a different school now. •172811_175251•
*PHI:	Cor! •175251_175361•
        Has she? •175731_176111•
*DAV:	Getting a job. •176111_176851•
*PHI:	But, you don't need a machine to do that. •176851_179801•
        You can count just like that. •179801_182131•
*DAV:	And, and, well I'm just showing you them. •182171_184971•
*PHI:	Right. •184971_185061•
        So •185511_185871•
*DAV:	Here. •186011_186221•
*PHI:	Yes. •186751_187031•
*DAV:	Seven twos. •187331_188571•
        That's two, I got, got it, got it. •188891_196311•
*PHI:	Right. •196881_196941•
        But you can count in twos. •197241_198401•
*DAV:	Of course I can! •199681_200051•
        Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve. •200051_201331•
*PHI:	After twelve? •201331_202951•
*DAV:	Fourteen. •202991_203401•
*PHI:	Then? •203781_204121•
*DAV:	Sixteen. •204651_204961•
*PHI:	Then? •206371_206831•
*DAV:	Eighteen. •207211_207451•
*PHI:	Then? •207861_208041•
*DAV:	Twenty. •208631_208891•
*PHI:	Then? •209511_209701•
*DAV:	Twenty two. •210001_212261•
*PHI:	Mm. •212261_212361•
        You're having to think about it. •212791_213941•
        Off then. •213941_216241•
*DAV:	Clear. •216391_216531•
*PHI:	So can you do ninety nines? •218301_220051•
        Keep adding ninety nines together? •220051_223291•
*DAV:	Wait! •223361_223721•
*PHI:	What's two ninety nines? •223771_227081•
        That's right. •227121_232331•
        Oh! •232411_232561•
        now it gets useful doesn't it? •233551_235381•
        When you're dealing in bigger figures •235401_237051•
*DAV:	All the •237051_237941•
*PHI:	than you can do in your mind. •238041_238961•
*DAV:	all the, all the numbers. •238961_240091•
*PHI:	Mm. •240611_240791•
        Right, read me that number. •240791_243231•
*DAV:	Two hundred and sixty nine. •243231_246481•
*PHI:	Start again. •246481_247651•
*DAV:	A hundred and two sixty nine. •247651_249551•
*PHI:	How do you get that? •249551_251901•
        number one is, what does it say at the end? •251931_254451•
*DAV:	Nothing there. •255481_255731•
        Full stop. •256711_257621•
*PHI:	It says, two, O, seven, nine. •257931_262871•
*DAV:	Oh. •263351_263741•
        Two O seven nine. •264411_265151•
*PHI:	Which is? •265501_266011•
        What does that make? •266011_266751•
*DAV:	It's the number of a steam engine I've got. •266751_268801•
*PHI:	I'm not bothered whether it's a number of a steam engine but  how do you pronounce that number? •269091_273361•
*DAV:	Two hundred  •273501_275401•
*PHI:	No. •276151_276181•
        No. •276181_276651•
*DAV:	two. •277101_277321•
*PHI:	If it was that number it would be hundreds. •277321_278831•
        It's bigger than hundreds, so what's that? •278831_281211•
*DAV:	Er thousands. •281251_284671•
*PHI:	Right. •284671_285021•
        So how many thousands? •285661_286341•
*DAV:	Two thousand and seventy nine. •286341_289711•
*PHI:	Well you got there in the end didn't you? •289711_291821•
*DAV:	Right. •291981_292081•
*PHI:	Right. •292081_292191•
*DAV:	Now it's even more difficult. •293611_295211•
        Even more difficult. •295751_304991•
        Equals •304991_305341•
*PHI:	Yeah, very clever. •305341_312391•
        You can add up in, what are you doing up, in tens? •312391_315671•
*DAV:	Tens. •315671_316151•
*PHI:	You can do that. •316241_317571•
        Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, can't you? •317571_319431•
*DAV:	Yes. •319431_319571•
*PHI:	What comes next? •319821_320551•
*DAV:	Fifty, sixty. •320551_323041•
*PHI:	Then? •323131_323341•
*DAV:	seventy, eighty, ninety, twenty •323341_324301•
*PHI:	Ah ah! •324621_325781•
        Ninety? •325781_326201•
*DAV:	A hundred. •326301_327591•
*PHI:	That's better. •327591_328861•
        And add up in hundreds now. •328861_330521•
*DAV:	A hundred, twenty •330521_331201•
*PHI:	No. •332791_332991•
         •334141_•
*DAV:	a hundred  •335161_335221•
*PHI:	No, start off  •336581_337721•
*DAV:	Erm  •337721_337791•
*PHI:	with a hundred and then add another hundred what do you get? •337791_339821•
*DAV:	I'm trying to work my way to the end. •339821_342431•
*PHI:	Now you're being a pickle! •342431_343541•
        Not, not with the machine. •343541_345641•
        Using your own head. •345641_347871•
        Add, add hundreds up. •347871_349891•
        Come on. •350021_350421•
        What do you start with? •350421_353031•
*DAV:	A hundred, a hundred and one, and  •353031_355901•
*PHI:	No. •355901_355991•
        No, no, no, no! •355991_356851•
        I was, I wasn't meaning you to go up in single numbers I was meaning, go up in hundreds. •356851_360411•
        Start off with a hundred. •360411_362521•
*DAV:	Yes. •362521_362741•
        A hundred. •362741_362981•
*PHI:	Then add, add the same again. •363271_365721•
*DAV:	Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred, ten hundred. •365721_376971•
*PHI:	But what's ten hundred? •376991_378331•
*DAV:	A thousand. •378331_380371•
*PHI:	Right. •380401_380871•
        So why didn't you say that? •381141_382171•
*DAV:	You didn't   •382221_384451•
*PHI:	I, I did. •385431_385861•
        I was expecting you to count, nobody says ten hundred. •385861_388171•
        Do they? •388171_389531•
*DAV:	No! •389531_389781•
        It always goes onto the next number. •390731_392811•
        Every number always goes up to nine. •392931_395461•
*PHI:	Then it triggers over into another one doesn't it? •395701_398751•
*DAV:	Yes. •398751_398811•
*PHI:	Now what were we saying the other day? •399001_400501•
        You have, units  tens, hundreds, thousands •400501_407761•
*DAV:	But Dad  •408401_409131•
*PHI:	don't you? •409131_409531•
*DAV:	but   three er  there. •409761_412591•
        Check that number. •412681_415581•
        Ha! •415661_415991•
        That was stupid. •416601_416961•
        Yeah. •417391_417681•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •420111_420311•
        So Mrs  was showing you how to do this? •420311_424932•
*DAV:	Right. •424932_425132•
        Yes. •426762_427002•
*PHI:	What, what else have you learnt to do with a calculator? •427212_429582•
        If you had four things •429582_433902•
*DAV:	Yes. •434002_434482•
        If I give them •434762_435912•
*PHI:	and you wanted to divide them among four people •435912_438532•
*DAV:	Yes. •438532_439122•
*PHI:	how many would each person get? •439862_441622•
*DAV:	But I I, I, I didn't quite get the question. •441622_444452•
*PHI:	If you had four things and you wanted to divide them between four people •445102_450682•
*DAV:	Yes. •450682_451262•
*PHI:	how many would each person get? •451382_453242•
*DAV:	Two. •453242_453502•
        No, one. •453892_455162•
*PHI:	That's better. •455162_456432•
        Now you did that without a calculator didn't you? •456432_458642•
*DAV:	Oh I see. •458642_458772•
*PHI:	Right, now this time do it with the calculator. •459942_461352•
        So you've got •461352_464092•
*DAV:	Four  turn it on. •464092_467322•
*PHI:	Turn it on. •467322_468202•
        You run out of light? •468202_473012•
        There are. •473012_473972•
        Now you're on. •473972_474682•
        Which figure do you want? •474682_478962•
        No. •478962_479082•
        No. •479082_479452•
        You're dividing. •480912_481572•
*DAV:	Which one's divide? •481572_484242•
*PHI:	That one. •484552_485682•
        Divide by •485682_489092•
*DAV:	Four. •489132_489462•
*PHI:	Yes. •490682_490742•
        That's right. •491002_491602•
        Equals? •491642_491922•
        Right. •493172_493732•
        Now that that time, that's easy. •495632_496842•
        That just proves what you already know. •496862_498962•
*DAV:	Right dad, I'll show you something else. •498962_500412•
*PHI:	No. •500412_500572•
        I was going to do more   •500572_501312•
*DAV:	But I I want to show you something, that's all. •501312_503272•
*PHI:	Go on then. •503382_504562•
        Nine, fifty six  square root. •504562_510562•
*DAV:	Er •510562_510962•
*PHI:	Who taught you that? •511032_513142•
*DAV:	Well, I no one. •513142_515012•
        It's Mrs  said to Mark  •516552_518815•
*PHI:	Just a minute. •518815_520807•
*DAV:	he, he, he was getting the  controls wrong. •520807_523617•
        He pressed square root instead of equals . •523617_525897•
*PHI:	Yes. •525897_526547•
        And so you've discovered  •527057_528147•
*DAV:	Eh! •528147_528687•
*PHI:	the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine. •528687_532637•
        But do you know what square root means? •532747_534937•
*DAV:	What? •534937_535247•
*PHI:	Well the square root of a number •535607_538717•
*DAV:	Yes. •538717_539177•
*PHI:	is the number which if multiplied by itself •539177_543377•
*DAV:	Yes. •543377_543937•
*PHI:	gives you back the number you started with. •544247_548377•
        Take, for , the easiest one is  four. •548377_550877•
        The square root of four is two. •551527_555487•
        Try it on your machine. •555537_557207•
*DAV:	Right. •557207_557587•
        What do I press? •559127_560317•
*PHI:	Four  four, square root  and it gives you two. •560317_565997•
        Because two times two  gives you four. •565997_569907•
        Try the square root of nine. •569907_571917•
        Just press clear. •571917_579287•
*DAV:	Yeah, I just press this one. •579737_581387•
*PHI:	Yes. •581457_581547•
        Clear that bit. •581547_582347•
*DAV:	Cos it clears the whole mind. •582347_583527•
*PHI:	Right. •583527_583997•
*DAV:	What shall I press? •584737_588267•
*PHI:	Nine  square root  is three. •588267_591937•
        So if you multiply three times three  you get nine. •592017_595067•
        Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen •595067_598157•
*DAV:	Yes. •598157_598977•
*PHI:	the square root is four. •598977_600697•
*DAV:	Yes. •600697_601227•
*PHI:	And if you go to twenty five the square root is five. •601977_604547•
        That's the number which multiplied by self •604647_607767•
*DAV:	Right. •608467_608817•
*PHI:	gives you the number. •609577_610167•
        Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six. •610167_613167•
*DAV:	Oh yes. •613167_613577•
*PHI:	Try and find the square root of six. •613697_616047•
        What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be. •616047_618227•
        Don't, don't press the button. •618227_619927•
        Six. •619927_620077•
*DAV:	Er er •620767_621107•
*PHI:	What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six? •621107_624077•
*DAV:	Three. •624077_624337•
*PHI:	No. •624407_624497•
        Three times three is? •626007_627307•
*DAV:	I six, six. •627307_627907•
        It's three. •630947_635697•
*PHI:	No. •635917_636137•
        Three times three. •636387_637727•
*DAV:	I don't know the answer! •637787_639557•
*PHI:	Well look  three  three  and three. •639557_644407•
        So how many have you got? •644487_645687•
*DAV:	Ten. •645687_646017•
*PHI:	No! •646837_647167•
        Plonker ! •647547_647997•
        You've got nine. •648057_649197•
*DAV:	I'm just going  •649197_650877•
*PHI:	Anyway  •651197_651337•
*DAV:	to check. •651337_651717•
*PHI:	So, there you are. •651717_654287•
        It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half. •654287_658227•
        Which isn't quite right. •658227_660127•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time. •660127_667417•
        That gets very difficult. •667417_668957•
*DAV:	Right. •668957_669447•
*PHI:	Right. •670977_671087•
        So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do. •671907_675007•
*DAV:	Right, I'll show you. •675237_677597•
        Ten  square root  is •680037_683617•
*PHI:	Three point one six two two seven seven six. •684557_687267•
*DAV:	Right. •687267_687717•
        Eh eh. •688187_690947•
*PHI:	Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six. •691157_700607•
        Very clever. •700607_701627•
        Useless for you though. •701627_703887•
        You don't really need that information do you? •703887_705947•
*DAV:	Well dad! •705947_707757•
*PHI:	So what, what, what sort of information do you need? •707987_711667•
*DAV:	Tt. •711667_711757•
        Counting information. •711837_714927•
*PHI:	Well, if you went out doing your favourite hobby. •714997_721127•

*DAV:	Getting in an engine. •724837_726037•
*PHI:	Driving an engine. •726657_727327•
        Now how would sums come into that? •727327_730437•
*DAV:	What! •730437_730637•
        You can't get sums in an engine's smoke box. •731737_733847•
*PHI:	Mm. •734057_734227•
        You could if they would burn. •735707_736867•
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	Well you  •736927_743097•
*DAV:	I, I want to get clever with you. •743177_745117•
*PHI:	Oh I thought you had been. •745117_746917•
