*UNK:	Contrast. 
*JUL:	Contrast. I got you a  single like a small box   
*BET:	 Single didn't you  ? 
*JUL:	And they had a double box for three pounds six or something and there are what at Woolies they're about three fifty six so you're saving fifty P. 
*BET:	 Oh not a lot  . 
*UNK:	 But still   
*JUL:	But you're saving something. You save fifty P. I mean if you'd rather get them if you'd rather save fifty P. You'd get them in there wouldn't ya? 
*BET:	Well yeah I suppose so 
*JUL:	Rather than get them in  . 
*BET:	Yeah if you want to save yeah yeah. Oh well. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*JUL:	I mean if you don't get much of an item off an item you'd know that is well in date. 
*BET:	Hmm Hmm. If it's that cheap 
*JUL:	It's either that or there's not a lot about. If there's not a lot there then they won't put the price tags down. 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*JUL:	But if they're got a lot they will. 
*UNK:	Well I mean well I don't mean   (  ) you'll sort it out yourself. But there ain't nothing on that   (  ) pack. 
*BET:	Hmm. 
*UNK:	And luckily enough 
*BET:	I don't   (  ) bloody know. 
*UNK:	So when I've been fussing about in there  (  )  
*UNK:	What are they called? 
*UNK:	Erm 
*BET:	I heard it when I come in didn't I? 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*BET:	 (  ) isn't it. It begins with a B. 
*UNK:	You can see the packet there orange packet. 
*BET:	Yeah I can see it   (  ) packet. 
*BET:	Yeah   ((laugh))  (  )  
*UNK:	Ah! I don't like them. 
*BET:	And chocolates all round like. 
*EDN:	I'd like   (  ) we had more Cadbury's in Birmingham once. I'm going back years. I'm going back a bit there  (  ) . 
*JUL:	Well they had tea coffee and sandwiches cakes. They had fruit juices for kids  (  ) . Now I got one lot of fruit juices and I said to   (  ) go and get some more   (  ) and there were six empty on the thing then I chucked them in and then there were another six empty like. 
*EDN:	I suppose you can get can you get so many up   (  ) you can in a lot of places can't you? 
*DAV:	No I know you used to have a price. 
*JUL:	But it worked out that they spent twenty thousand pounds on letting families go round for these three weeks. 
*BET:	It would be better to 
*EDN:	 (  ) they didn't have the machinery like you got. 
*UNK:	No it was all hands all done by hand no automation. 
*EDN:	Yeah yeah. And the villages all round there are pretty out there. 
*JUL:	Ours ours can't be done automated. 
*BET:	That's right. 
*JUL:	You can't have a computer put the eggs in the pans because it's got to be it's got to be done manually by a worker. 
*EDN:	Yeah but chocolate's got so expens   
*JUL:	My dad's   (  ) he didn't understand before he seen the mini eggs why they're so dear. 
*BET:	There's a lot of work there. 
*JUL:	It takes thirty two hours before they can be packed. They got to be stored for thirty two hours. It takes so long. So basically all they're saying it takes thirty two hours to do one egg. 
*BET:	Yeah. 
*JUL:	As with Double Decker it can take the most two hours  Crunchie takes the most two hours   
*EDN:	 As with Crunchie   (  ) are there no Crunchies there now? 
*JUL:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	There were Crunchies yesterday. 
*BET:	No no it weren't yesterday. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*BET:	Huh? 
*DAV:	 (  ) packs  (  )  
*JUL:	What packs of Crunchies? 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Loose one you mean? 
*JUL:	No I went Thursday. 
*DAV:	No. 
*JUL:	I went. 
*DAV:	There weren't any loose one. 
*JUL:	Thursday morning there was packs of Crunchies 
*EDN:	No I don't 
*BET:	I likes a Crunchie. 
*UNK:	I don't mind a Crunchie. 
*BET:	It's light isn't it? It doesn't stick in your gob  ((laugh))  
*JUL:	I likes a Crunchie  (  )  
*UNK:	I's eat all the chocolate first and the inside afterwards 
*JUL:	More than that now though. 
*UNK:	Oh aye. Yeah but you can buy it  (  )  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	You could buy it in a penny packet bloody great  (  )  
*JUL:	I used to get a lot of it when I was in 
*UNK:	And it used to be dark brown. It used to be darker than   (  ) bloody  (  ) . 
*BET:	They made it different then didn't they? 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*BET:	It's bloody mass produced now isn't it? 
*UNK:	So before my work out this morning I said to Joe he's in the bathroom. Done Joe's bedroom and er the Hoover was up there the dusters was up there so I thought shall I shall I. No I've got dinner before one and I thought well 
*JUL:	 Well   
*UNK:	  (  ) properly   
*JUL:	with Crunchie right? They set on a big conveyor belt. There's got to be about eight foot wide  and er   
*BET:	 I'd seen  that being done on the telly the other night. (  )  
*JUL:	A hundred and fifty degrees C that's what it comes out at. Right and it goes like these great funnels spread it   (  ) Now as it goes down it gets caught down. And when it gets cut. It's got cut like boiling hot oil a laser of oil. 
*BET:	Oh oh. 
*JUL:	And we got told now I didn't know this. We got told that that laser of oil can cut through concrete just like that. Just as quick as it goes through a Crunchie. 
*UNK:	Bloody hell. 
*JUL:	So they have so much problems with it like they'll never ever experiment with that again. They'll keep it for Crunchie but never use it for anything else again because they've had so much trouble with it. 
*BET:	Blimey! 
*UNK:	 (  ) Charles   (  ) with Christmas presents. 
*BET:	 ((whispering)) Oh did you? 
*BET:	I had to give him his paper and his  (  )
