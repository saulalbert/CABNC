*PS0W7:	Yep This one . 
*PS0W2:	Well I think perhaps what we 'll do cos you 've missed quite a few of these out so I think what we 'll do erm is to leave that what you 're doing there for a moment we 'll go through this mark this and the one 's you have n't done we 'll do so that you 've got this one straight Okay . 
*PS0W7:	Okay There 's only one I did n't do That one . 
*PS0W2:	Oh yes So there is Well well anyway we 'll do do that and see see what the other 's like You 've been caught Right This one posts are erected at a hundred metre intervals on a motorway how many posts are there in a distance of four thousand seven hundred kilometres . 
*PS0W7:	Twenty seven . 
*PS0W2:	No As I say you have been caught in a little trap Posts are erected . 
*PS0W7:	Forty sev six posts . 
*PS0W2:	posts are erected every hundred metres right . 
*PS0W7:	Mm . 
*PS0W2:	There 's a hundred metres there 's two hundred metres there 's three hundred metres how many posts in three hundred metres . 
*PS0W7:	Four Sorry . 
*PS0W2:	Mm . 
*PS0W7:	Yeah . 
*PS0W2:	Right Because at no metres there 's one post and at the end of a hundred metres you 've got two posts so you got one post more . 
*PS0W7:	So it must be forty six . 
*PS0W2:	distance . 
*PS0W7:	That 's what I say forty eight . 
*PS0W2:	Forty eight right Got it Always . 
*PS0W7:	Okay . 
*PS0W2:	be wary of that And the same thing applies posts are a hundred metres apart . 
*PS0W7:	Mm . 
*PS0W2:	If you are at the fifth post how far have you gone from the start . 
*PS0W7:	Six hundred metres . 
*PS0W2:	How far have you gone from the start . 
*PS0W7:	Four hundred . 
*PS0W2:	Right Fifth post one two three four five the fifth post you have gone four hundred metres . 
*PS0W7:	Oh . 
*PS0W2:	So wherever you get that sort of question just stop and think . 
*PS0W7:	Okay . 
*PS0W2:	because it 's either one more or it 's one less The only time that that does n't apply is if you are thinking in terms of posts in a fence around a square field or round a circular field . 
*PS0W7:	Okay . 
*PS0W2:	Because now after one hundred metres you 've got two posts after two hundred metres you 've got three posts after three hundred metres you got four posts after four hundred metres you 've got five posts but after you 've five hundred metres you 've only got five posts cos that one doubles up . 
*PS0W7:	Yeah . 
*PS0W2:	So you got one two three four five spaces and you got one two three four five posts . 
*PS0W7:	Mhm . 
*PS0W2:	but on a straight line your . 
*PS0W7:	Yeah . 
*PS0W2:	spaces are one less than the number of posts Alright . 
*PS0W7:	Okay . 
*PS0W2:	So just remember that That 's why I said you have been caught That 's a ste one of those little trap questions . 
*PS0W7:	Yeah . 
*PS0W2:	Now this one four hedges together have a mass of two hundred grams how many have a mass of two and ha .
