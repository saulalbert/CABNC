        Space Man. •_•
        Sunday night  •_•
*BOB:	Come on, Grant. •_•
*GRA:	It was Sunday night and Scott was watching Space Man on television. •_•
        Scott had watched him get into the rocket many times and he dreamed about going with Space Man. •_•
        It would be fun if I could get into the, that rocket too, thought Scott. •_•
        It would be fun to go far out into space. •_•
        That was the one thing  •_•
*ALI:	Full stop. •_•
*GRA:	Scott thought about. •_•
        He was fast asleep before Space Man had finished his trip. •_•
        Scott began to dream. •_•
*ALI:	Good. •_•
*GRA:	The time had come for Space Man Scott to go to the moon! •_•
        He would be the first boy to land on the moon. •_•
        Scott walked outside and looked up at the rocket. •_•
        The rocket was as tall as seven houses. •_•
        It was as tall as seven houses. •_•
        This rocket was, this  Scott said that that would take him to the moon. •_•
        Scott climbed inside the rocket. •_•
        The men were getting ready for blast off. •_•
        Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! •_•
        Blast off ! •_•
        Space Man Scott began  has •_•
*BOB:	His. •_•
*GRA:	his trip to the moon. •_•
        On and on into space went Scott Seven. •_•
        Then a part of the rocket fell away. •_•
        When Scott looked out, he could see the stars and many flashing lights. •_•
        Part of the time Scott talked on the rocket's radio. •_•
        Part of the time he just looked out into space. •_•
        The rocket came to a stop at Space Station. •_•
        Some works at the station  •_•
*BOB:	Some workers. •_•
*GRA:	some workers at the station took Scott inside. •_•
*ALI:	New line. •_•
*GRA:	They asked him  •_•
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*GRA:	they asked him to remember all the things he could about the trip from earth. •_•
        Then the men talked about other rocket •_•
*BOB:	About the other. •_•
*GRA:	about the other rocket would take him •_•
*BOB:	That would take him. •_•
*GRA:	on to the moon. •_•
        They helped Scott get ready. •_•
        In the morning, Scott, three other men got into the moon rocket. •_•
        Again he were ready to go. •_•
        Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! •_•
        Blast off ! •_•
        Away went the rocket with Scott and his friends inside. •_•
        Away it went on its long trip to the moon. •_•
        As last •_•
*BOB:	At. •_•
*GRA:	it, at last they landed on the moon. •_•
        Scott and the men got out and looked around. •_•
        What a strange place it was. •_•
        Look here, look here Scott, said one men •_•
*BOB:	Man. •_•
*GRA:	one one, said one man. •_•
        Do you see that big brown thing that looks a boat? •_•
        You live on that boat. •_•
        That's the earth. •_•
        That's what your home looks like from up here on the moon. •_•
        How strange it was for Scott to see. •_•
        That  •_•
*BOB:	His. •_•
*GRA:	his home was a round planet far out in space. •_•
        One man had a shovel. •_•
        He wanted to take some things from the moon back to earth with him. •_•
        The other men looked around and talked on the radio. •_•
        Scott  followed the men. •_•
        He was not looking where he was going  •_•
*BOB:	He was, he was looking . •_•

*BOB:	And. •_•
*GRA:	and he fell  down. •_•
        Down, down, down Scott fell. •_•
        The dream was over and so was Scott's trip to the moon. •_•
        Well, said his mother, what are you doing down there on the floor? •_•
        Scott laughed I just fell off the moon. •_•
        He said what a dream I had . •_•

*BOB:	Lost a Lego? •_•
*ALI:	when Sheila was here last week and Linda, and Linda's little boy Christopher and he's only about a month younger than Annabel and erm she feels the bits would be too tiny for him. •_•
        He would eat them. •_•
        Cos one day we found him and he was choking to death practically and erm er Tam, Linda's husband turned him upside down and smacked his back, he'd eaten a one pound coin. •_•
*BOB:	Blimey! •_•
*ALI:	Now he could've choked and died! •_•
*BOB:	Hey, you're damaging that, Annabel. •_•
*ALI:	So  the last time, remember  •_•
*BOB:	Don't do that to it! •_•
*ALI:	remember the last time Linda was here she came on her own and her father  •_•
*BOB:	Okay, okay  •_•
*ALI:	dropped her and then her husband picked her up and the Reverend   •_•
*BOB:	 ((cough)) 
*ALI:	the Reverend Peter  came that day? •_•
*BOB:	Yeah •_•
*ALI:	And erm well he came to the door and Linda and the little, the little boy Christopher they were upstairs. •_•
        But previous to that Linda had said that she was terrified  to get Lego for the little boy. •_•
        She was terrified when him and Annabel was playing it. •_•
        I said she's okay and she can handle it beautifully, and she's never eaten any little parts yet and some of the arms, Bobby, are tiny! •_•
        So she thought, well she saw Annabel handle it so beautifully she thought she might get some for Christopher for his Christmas. •_•
        But obviously she hasn't got them because erm she would have said when she was here last week. •_•
        She  last week. •_•
        But   •_•
