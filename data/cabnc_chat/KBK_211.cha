@Comment:	conversation #212 (Tape 002920)
*CHR:	Do you think the world will ever get get the balance right feeding the starving?
*NOR:	No never.One apple and one banana, toffee apple if you've got no banana.One of each please
*LYN:	Yes.Yes.You want coffee afterwards?
*NOR:	Yes please.
*LYN:	Two coffees
*NOR:	Strange little creature.
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*NOR:	Well it's always been an awful lot worse than it is now.
*CHR:	Why is it  (        ) 
*NOR:	No it is communication that tells us that it is so awful now.I don't think it's any worse now, it's just that we've written no about it.
*CHR:	Well, I don't know if that's true or not.
*NOR:	But it's nonsense flying in food to Ethiopia Bangladesh and all the rest of it
*CHR:	Isn't it better to do nothing?
*NOR:	Let them die.
*CHR:	Why why is that better?
*NOR:	Because that is the way of the world, they're living in very very marginal areas that do not sustain life.You will never ever stop sending food to areas like that.They're areas that people should not be living.
*CHR:	Is that a bad thing?I mean if if presumably people go on being born there surely we should leave them.It doesn't really matter to human beings   (        ) as long as they have   (        ) nourishment.If you worked in this country and for some reason and were starving you wouldn't care if they fed you.
*NOR:	The individual of course wants feeding needs feeding but should all resources of this area that area be rife to that particular point, every two to three years?
*CHR:	Well why should they not?
*NOR:	Because that's what happened to Bangladesh.
*CHR:	Why should they not?
*NOR:	Because they don't have any genuine effect.It happens over and over and over again.Nobody ever learns anything
*CHR:	Maybe we should be   (        ) when your budget   (        ) for all nations have plenty of food and plenty of resources should automatically make this sort of money and food available to nations without it.Maybe that's the answer.
*NOR:	Maybe it is.
*CHR:	Maybe it should be an emergency aid    (        )  (.) those that have given and those that have not.I mean if that's the only way that people were kept in reasonable health. (        ) the money comes from   (        )  (.) 
*NOR:	I don't think we are talking about kept in reasonable health dear I think it is a question of living in an environment which does not genuinely support over any sensible period of time normal human life.
*LYN:	Have you order?
*NOR:	We have thank you yes.
*LYN:	Have you order coffee as well?
*NOR:	As well.
*LYN:	Yes.You like coffee now or later?
*NOR:	Later please.
*LYN:	You want coffee now?
*NOR:	No later later.
*CHR:	Yes they've always been like that and they always will be like that.They're the same, let them die.That's not normal.Because there'll just be more people.Otherwise they would have died out long ago.
*NOR:	Well I mean may be there's there's there's an argument on teaching contraception measures.
*CHR:	I'm sure there is as well.That never the full answer because pushing people into that   (        ) is one thing they should have.
*NOR:	Yes.
*CHR:	I mean six to one is you know that. (        )  (.) 
*NOR:	Sure.
*CHR:	People with no money and no home always seem to end up having children.Whereas if you and I didn't have a roof over our head
*NOR:	Mm
*CHR:	I mean the last thing we'd think about is excluding children.
*NOR:	But they do.Yes.How right you are.
*CHR:	It would be a good idea if you do teach them the ways of contraception available it's never going to stop people having babies.I mean in China they   (        ) families   (        ) and what have they got?They've not denied the situation at all have they?
*NOR:	No.No.
*CHR:	Or families where they kill a child
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	for being the wrong sex.
*NOR:	Yes.
*CHR:	Only children growing up in the lap of luxury   (        )  (.) 
*NOR:	Yes.
*CHR:	And mothers are supposed to sink all their hopes ambitions   (        ) in the one child.Watching their education.
*NOR:	Mm.
*CHR:	Strange thing they'll have two and three.
*NOR:	They're a nation of super brats.
*CHR:	Whereas mothers at home aren't their usual selves because they've their children to look after.I mean   (        ) but interesting but not the ideal answer.
