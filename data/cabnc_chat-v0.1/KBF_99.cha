*LEE:	And I'll tell you  he says I'm not telling you what to do. •206074_206579•
        It's entirely  your decision. •206579_206771•
*BRE:	Do you wanna swap round and have that little one? •206778_207123•
*LEE:	Pass me the butter please? •207123_207271•
*BRE:	big one. •207630_207956•
*LEE:	This one? •207982_208091•
*BRE:	Yeah. •208091_208101•
        Should have   •208101_208189•
*LEE:	Thanks. •208331_208347•
*BRE:	Any phone calls today? •208347_208409•
*LEE:	No. •208409_208427•
        None whatsoever. •208500_208694•
*DAV:	Right bear in mind  you are getting over a cold. •208893_209406•
*LEE:	Yeah. •209469_209475•
*DAV:	Getting over a cold, right? •209475_209610•
*LEE:	Mhm. •209619_209640•
*DAV:	And you've been far from very well. •209680_210123•
        And  you are going to be going skiing January the fourth which is not many days away. •210238_210949•
        Right? •210949_210966•
        Now  my opinion if any   I would say don't sleep round James's house for one. •210966_212522•
        Right? •212612_212625•
        For the simple reason  that you won't go to bed till  late in the morning or whatever which would knock you back. •212625_213323•
        Right? •213361_213383•
*LEE:	Mm. •213441_213468•
*DAV:	The other one is  phone Pete up and tell him that you've been off sick for a week  can't play football this week. •213512_214677•
        Right? •214836_214847•
        Then next week, have the weekend off. •214990_215173•
        Still go out. •215254_215304•
        Don't stay in, I'm not saying stay indoors, you can still go out  and next week get yourself  you decide in yourself to do your own  training. •215304_216543•
        Go to football training by all means. •216711_216889•
*LEE:	But how can I cos I've got •216929_217044•
*BRE:	Exams every day. •217044_217148•
*LEE:	Yeah. •217205_217220•
        School work. •217229_217283•
*DAV:	But I've got work every day. •217384_217561•
        But I still come home and do it. •217605_217727•
        I don't wanna do it. •217751_217998•
        It's if you want to do something. •218070_218209•
        I'm I'm I'm  it's like I said to you I'm not telling you to do it. •218209_218537•
        But I tell you something now  when you go skiing on January the fourth  I've never skied but I can assure you this  James I know for a fact is going to special lessons. •218540_219637•
        Now if you're not fit and you're just getting over a cold now so there's no way your fit  you're gonna be  well an absolute disaster out there. •219658_220817•
        And yet I tell you what and if you go and play football on Sunday and you're not a hundred percent fit from this cold  you've lost all next week as well. •220967_221616•
        But er I mean that's, that's your decision. •221743_222179•
        I was  you're old enough to   I'm just . •222428_223026•
        Whether it's a hard match or what it's up to you. •223366_223741•
*BRE:	It is isn't it? •223741_224132•
*DAV:	Tell me something then. •224536_224608•
        If it, if it was a   match on a Tuesday this week, would you have played? •224608_225128•
*LEE:	No. •225173_225199•
*DAV:	So all I'm saying is try and get rid of the whole  not  your tablets will finish up about Saturday or Sunday. •225447_226083•
*BRE:	Tomorrow. •226101_226124•
*DAV:	Get, and I mean like I said to you today you've still got your cough. •226362_226674•
        So is it gonna do you any good really? •226708_226873•
*LEE:	No. •227108_227127•
*DAV:	Alright it's gonna upset Pete. •227170_227294•
        And you probably ain't gonna wanna leave your friends standing around on a football field. •227408_227901•
        I'm not trying to, don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say pack this in and do that. •227901_228191•
        All I want to see you better  back to school and back to your fitness again. •228344_228728•
        I'm not being a  you do as I say dad. •229002_229415•
        It's up to you mate. •229462_229525•
        If you think that you, if you feel that you're alright to do it, by all means do it. •229599_230170•
        And you can say well look I told you so dad. •230208_230341•
        If you've still got that cough and that it's just •230717_230986•
*BRE:	Do you think you'll be fit enough, you're fit enough to play Lee? •230989_231327•
*LEE:	No. •231327_231335•
        I know for a fact I'm not cos all I've done all week is sit on my bum and watch telly and eat a lot. •231342_231744•
*BRE:	But by Sunday do you think you will be? •231828_231960•
*DAV:	But  training . •232040_232116•
*BRE:	Yeah. •232119_232130•
        How can I get myself fit for Sunday? •232130_232319•
        You can't, it's like if I went out swimming and that on Saturday  or even to ride. •232708_233205•
        Couple of swimming lessons ain't gonna get me fit for Sunday. •233253_233467•
*DAV:	It's not the football that I'm worried about. •233595_233769•
        It's the skiing. •233777_233839•
*LEE:	No but I'm saying  I'm not gonna be able to run around for eighty minutes  being . •233975_234520•
        Alright I'll get through it  I won't be running about as much as what I usually do. •234564_234968•
*DAV:	And next week you'll be off again. •235053_235161•
*LEE:	Possibly, yeah. •235379_235441•
*DAV:	You're doing Pete no favours. •235526_235651•
        Cos Pete  putting out a good, alright  Pete might say   if say  you, you just rung up to say look Pete I'm sorry . •235696_236301•
        He won't tell the players and he'll say alright I haven't got a team so he can cancel the match. •236318_236904•
*BRE:	I'd give him a ring tonight Lee and get, then he might have time to chance to get some players. •237221_237599•
        Will they? •237761_237832•
*DAV:	You've gotta get your  think  but if you don't get yourself right you're gonna be in a right two and eight. •237836_238590•
*BRE:	The difference last week  sit down  getting up to go to Blackbushe. •238889_239218•
        Then standing out on that football pitch. •239262_239460•
        Didn't do us a lot of good did it? •240286_240431•
*LEE:	No. •240476_240482•
*DAV:	The other thing we've gotta find out about is er  while we're on the subject  is what insurance has he got for skiing? •240563_241755•
        Not taking the fact that he's gonna have an injury or anything but I'm just saying in case something does happen. •241986_243017•
*BRE:	Mm. •243301_243310•
*DAV:	If he could speak to Gill •243310_243481•
*BRE:	Mm. •243505_243517•
*DAV:	to find out from her  if it comes to it we can perhaps ask the old lady  if she can set something up where  •243554_244193•
*BRE:	I know what we've gotta do this week, or next week. •244661_244881•
*LEE:	What? •244881_244900•
*BRE:	Your passport. •244961_245024•
*DAV:	Yeah that's  yeah. •245206_245309•
*BRE:	Otherwise you're not gonna get it done. •245320_245446•
*LEE:	Thought it was already done. •245446_245649•
*BRE:	Eh? •245711_245714•
*LEE:	I said I thought it was already done and the form was sent away. •245729_246053•
*BRE:	We can't, you've gotta go and do it in person. •246097_246242•
        We can't get it. •246258_246324•
        You've gotta be there and sign . •246324_246422•
        At a local post office. •246623_246695•
        I'll phone Pete up tonight and  tell him. •247103_247223•
        I don't think he will be well enough. •247335_247597•
*DAV:	I, I'd love to see him play football. •247716_247859•
        But he'd be a complete idiot to do it. •247951_248122•
        He's doing Pete no favours. •248364_248488•
        He's doing himself no favours. •248508_248634•
        Next week, get him  like I said to you Lee, you've got to train  doesn't matter, it's no good having me •248779_249351•
*BRE:	He might put, cos I mean Craig's out isn't he? •249351_249555•
        He's banned now till February. •249555_249677•
        So he's got to try and get some other players hasn't he? •249716_250005•
*LEE:	No he'd have enough players. •250086_250364•
*BRE:	Who? •250380_250397•
        How many? •250397_250447•
*LEE:	Well he's got Stevie  hasn't he? •250629_250792•
        He plays and . •250844_250973•
*BRE:	He'll play those two instead of you and Craig. •251146_251305•
*DAV:	See the weekend out on your tablets. •251756_251943•
        And when your back to school  get back and do it in a serious way. •252108_252556•
        It's only for three weeks till you get your skiing over with. •252556_252976•
        Then you drop back into your usual slot but I tell you what if you go skiing and your not hundred percent fit or as fit as you can be  from what I've, what I've read about it and that your gonna be in a right two and eight out there. •252985_254307•
*BRE:	usual things. •254313_254376•
*LEE:	 (        )

*DAV:	You won't be going to bed till three o'clock round James's house. •256311_256662•
*LEE:	We will though. •256662_256698•
        We did last time, we were in bed by half ten, no eleven. •256730_256993•
*DAV:	twelve. •257639_257662•
        Only I've heard it all before. •257662_257757•
        Anyhow I, I saw to you I'm not, I don't care what you do. •257757_257959•
