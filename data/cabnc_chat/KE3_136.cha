*CHR:	What  I've just rubbed it all out. •124822_124954•
*TON:	on a bit of paper. •124954_125011•
*JAC:	Yep I need a separate bit of paper. •125011_125182•
*CHR:	Daddy I have in my bag can you get that out? •125182_125594•
        A little spotted bag. •125652_125739•
*MAR:	 ((cough)) 
*JAC:	I can't find a bit that   Give me the pencil and let me show you. •125739_127416•
*CHR:	I'll get  you'll have to go just go right to the back  just at the back  otherwise you're gonna be flipping through millions of pages. •127416_128591•
*JAC:	Okay. •128591_128610•
        Can I do it on there? •128627_128714•
*CHR:	Yes  yes okay. •128743_128835•
*JAC:	Look you start off and you've got  your trunk okay? •129050_129509•
*CHR:	Yeah. •129509_129521•
*JAC:	What haven't you got  you got two or three perhaps  two big ones  •129644_130319•
*TON:	Can you turn that up. •130328_130424•
*JAC:	coming off at the trunk  see like that •130468_130949•
*CHR:	Mm. •130949_130963•
*JAC:	and you   •130963_130987•
*CHR:	Oh I see what you mean now. •130987_131064•
*JAC:	another one like that  and then what happens is you've got smaller branches  lots of smaller branches  coming off of piece •131064_131865•
*CHR:	Yeah and then it joins up together doesn't it? •131901_132184•
*JAC:	and then you've got smaller branches coming off of the smaller branches •132205_132534•
*CHR:	Mm. •132534_132577•
*JAC:	and it makes twigs. •132593_132760•
*CHR:	Yeah. •132760_132781•
*JAC:	So you've got  this this branch will keep going  perhaps  until it gets really tiny. •132801_134057•
*CHR:	It's incredible cos all the little bits join together I mean what's that? •134100_134537•
*TON:	No  they don't they cross over  and they tangle up  but once a branch starts off  it doesn't join on to another one. •134537_135712•
*CHR:	I didn't mean that  I meant  when you look at a tree it's sort of got •135712_136712•
*TON:	A cris-cross. •136724_136832•
*CHR:	yeah sometimes you get a tree like  with a little bit coming off the side •136832_137392•
*TON:	Mm. •137392_137411•
*CHR:	and then it's sort of joined together onto another branch and then there's a branch there. •137411_137847•
*TON:	No  I don' know what you mean. •137847_138010•
*CHR:	Er it's hard to explain I can't explain that. •138010_138321•
*MUM:	As Daddy says once they come out they don't join onto another. •138321_138723•
*TON:	You see that one would sort of  •138723_138898•
*CHR:	Mhm. •138917_138939•
*TON:	carry on  going and that one would go up behind it. •138939_139263•
*JAC:	Look Christine if I draw it  •139263_139491•
*CHR:	Yeah. •139491_139507•
*JAC:	as a diagram rather than as a tree. •139507_139672•
        Right you've got one branch •139683_139762•
*CHR:	Yeah. •139762_139784•
*JAC:	you start off with one branch like that •139784_140030•
*CHR:	Mm. •140049_140062•
*JAC:	now that branch will divide into to two  or you'll get one  one bit coming off the side  you might get another one up here •140252_141373•
*CHR:	Mm. •141373_141383•
*JAC:	right? •141396_141423•
        So they're going to go  see then you get other branches coming off of that one •141502_141960•
*CHR:	Mm. •141965_141979•
*JAC:	the same  and other branches coming off of that one  and other branches coming off of that one  it's sort of gets smaller and smaller and is gets •141979_143160•
*CHR:	Mm. •143165_143182•
*JAC:	so you  you've got  perhaps two off of there  and then another one off of the side of there  and as you go it gets  it gets slightly smaller each time  see what I mean? •143182_145407•
*CHR:	Yes  and it comes to just to to the  •145419_145786•
*JAC:	to the  •145823_145867•
*CHR:	light one then you stop don't you? •145867_146057•
*JAC:	Yeah  that's right  see  see what I mean? •146067_146710•
*CHR:	Yeah. •146777_146805•
*JAC:	It it you just sort of keep going until it  stops   •146814_147792•
*CHR:	Right  I'll clean that up and start again  this is brilliant! •147804_149537•
*TON:	Mhm. •149537_149574•
*CHR:	Have you seen that? •149574_149823•
*MUM:	Yeah. •149831_149844•

*MUM:	I never did it. •152564_152728•
*CHR:	What happened? •152853_152896•
*MUM:	Did it work then did it? •152896_153120•
*JAC:	Yeah it literally  it's like sticking a sticking plaster on your legs and pulling it off. •153120_153575•
*MUM:	and tearing it off  urgh! •153575_153667•
*JAC:	Only it holds onto the hairs so much that it rips them out  so that you end up with  legs with no hairs on it but  ah! •153682_154390•
        It's best done very quickly. •154390_154602•
*MUM:	My legs have never been hairy. •154632_154887•
