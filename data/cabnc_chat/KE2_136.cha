*TER:	Good gracious! •228619_228705•
        Times may be tough but it seems we're taking less care of our money than ever before. •228870_229270•
        According to the Royal Mint around twenty three thousand pounds of coins a day disappear! •229389_229929•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Some is taken home by tourist and some is lost in the street and down the backs of sofas. •230142_230543•
        But amazingly we are just as careless when it comes to bank notes. •230584_230874•
        Last November the old style fiver with the Duke of Wellington was withdrawn yet there are still sixty million missing ! •230912_231703•
*MAR:	You can understand sort of you know,the coppers and that that  as they say get down behind sofas and what have you  but erm  it is quite amazing  where notes get to isn't it? •232861_234515•
*TER:	Sixty million's a lot isn't it? •234523_234674•
*MAR:	Yes. •236563_236576•
*TER:	That's quite interesting that! •236910_237018•
        There's a mutilated notes department as well that you can  send really  screwed up notes to. •237018_237664•
*MAR:	Yeah. •237980_237992•
        Haven't you heard before about that then? •238280_238472•
        But how I know, that's what somebody told me. •238474_238741•
        to send  some notes in  •238756_238899•
*TER:	Yeah. •238941_238971•
*MAR:	you know, put them in the washing machine. •238988_239421•
        They  they have  in there  and they take out bank notes and coins from the washing machine. •239568_240148•
        But, so long as you  first. •240148_240417•
        Erm •240417_240423•
*TER:	Oh that's right, well they detail here exactly what you need to have. •240423_240761•
*MAR:	But, you know, that's how I knew there was a department somewhere because they do   •240796_241667•
*TER:	I think  just, if you've got the number you can take it into an ordinary bank. •241714_242040•
*MAR:	Yeah. •242040_242047•
*TER:	Amazing! •242369_242424•
        Yeah ! •242711_242787•
        Yes, I know how we got talking to this  girl in the Post Office cos I erm  I asked her for some stamps as well, you see, I wanted some  cos I happen to be sending stuff of for Germany  tomorrow. •243102_244354•
        And I haven't got any second class stamps so I thought well I'll get five  and it was, you know, dealing with that that erm •244354_245231•
*MAR:	Yeah. •245231_245283•
*TER:	it cropped up. •245288_245370•
*MAR:	You didn't say anything about  school  did you? •245370_246716•
*TER:	Oh no , no! •246716_246760•
*MAR:	But, I mean that's why  Victor came away wasn't it? •248347_248670•
*TER:	That's right. •248673_248695•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	She was really upset about it. •248695_249045•
*MAR:	Bet you were surprised to hear Monsignor  on the phone weren't you? •249082_250192•
*TER:	I was , yeah! •250192_250273•
