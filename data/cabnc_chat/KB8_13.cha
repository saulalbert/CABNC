*JAM:	Who brought bread to feed 
*ANN:	Yes.
*JAM:	the ducks?Yes.Yes well, that's right.
*ANN:	I think she must have been   (.) quite well off some time, had fallen on   (.) really hard times.I mean, she told me   (.) oh, a couple of years ago that she was eighty.And, I better get this dinner out.And erm   (.) she always thought of her husband as daddy.
*JAM:	Mhm.
*ANN:	And her daughter   (.) I think she must have been getting on because   (.) around the time she told me that she was eighty, she happened to mention that her daughter was forty.
*JAM:	She had no grandchildren   (        ) 
*ANN:	I know, her daughter, er her daughter's not married.Well I haven't seen her feeding the ducks   (.) for about three or four months.I wonder if she's died or she's ill?
*JAM:	She's always going to jumble sales.
*ANN:	I know.All, all her clothes came from jumble sales.Everything.She wa she was buying, long after nylon shirts went out of fashion, there we there was a pile of nylon shirts, and she said I'm, I'm just looking to see if this   (.) if these will be suitable for daddy.I can't remember   (.) er, she gave me the reason why she wanted these for   (.) oh, he, he, he always wears his cuffs out or something. (.) She was quite pleasant to talk to, I liked listening to her.I don't think I know her name.So, I couldn't even ask anyone.
