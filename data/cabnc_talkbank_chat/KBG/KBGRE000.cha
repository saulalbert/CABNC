*PS052:	0 . 
*PS051:	Yes I know .  57873_59653
*PS052:	It makes you feel very .  61083_62093
*PS051:	No I do n't think about it just let it run .  62653_64373

*PS051:	No you were right what you said though about .  77603_78993
*PS052:	Mm .  79953_80183
*PS051:	Matthew .  80243_80833
*PS052:	Yeah I just it just seems to me such a complete and utter waste of of his time primarily for fifteen I mean this being identified a year earlier which we reckon it was you would think that even given all the red tape and everything else .  82783_105793
*PS051:	I 'll have to look up his records at least .  106193_107193
*PS052:	You know it makes you well it makes you wonder whether something could be done without placing him for his sake Cos he 's never gon na achieve anything in an ordinary class He 's just got such a downer on himself .  107433_118103
*PS051:	Mm .  118103_118213
*PS052:	and he 's he 's got such a a negative way of looking at himself and everybody else looks at him that way now Cos he he he can not be positive he contributes nothing .  118213_134083
*PS051:	It 's hard being positive .  134673_135913
*PS052:	In his own eyes .  135913_136343
*PS051:	for him is n't it .  136993_137573
*PS052:	Well it 's I mean I feel sorry for him but having said .  138173_141853
*PS051:	Well I do and I do n't sometimes .  141853_142933
*PS052:	well having said that although I feel sorry for him I get annoyed with him .  142933_146013
*PS051:	Yes Like I said he 's his own worst enemy .  146283_148513
*PS052:	Because he wastes everybody 's else 's time .  148513_149563
*PS051:	And everybody else is fed up with him .  149563_151753
*PS052:	Well this is why I think he 'd be better off hi his needs are not met by a class teacher And I do n't think they have been for this last .  151753_159403
*PS051:	Mm we need a support teacher to go there .  159643_161233
*PS052:	for the last year But yo you need somebody who 's gon na work with him every day and with an individual programme and you just ca n't offer that in a class .  161233_169333
*PS051:	Mm it 's difficult .  171253_171783
*PS052:	The only way you can do that is if he goes to a special unit at Maidstone and works .  173183_177823
*PS051:	Well I do n't think there 's provision for him now you see because it 's a .  178663_180913
*PS052:	Mm .  180913_181013
*PS051:	there 's a term and a half left before he moves on .  181603_183833
*PS052:	Well this this is what I 'm saying if it had been picked up and followed through at an earlier stage he would have been ensconced .  183833_190603
*PS051:	Oh yeah well there must have been .  190603_191543
*PS052:	and .  191543_191623
*PS051:	a problem identified earlier on but er .  191623_193613
*PS052:	Oh Well I think so I think it 's been identified but I do n't think it 's been followed through .  193613_197793
*PS051:	Well it 's like so many other things is n't it .  197793_199753
*PS052:	Yeah that 's always the way though in n it I just cos when I see children like that and you know there 's nothing you can really do for them you ca n't make up for the fact that they 've got a rotten home life and that 's top and bottom line that 's what it is .  199753_216653
*PS051:	Yeah .  216653_216823
*PS052:	You 're trying to be everything and they 're pushing it away cos it 's not what they really want and they I mean all all you can get from him is how marvellous you 're right how marvellous his brothers are and yet what I 've heard of the brothers they 're not .  217253_234663
*PS051:	Not much yeah .  234663_235053
*PS052:	they 're not all that marvellous they 're not really that much to look up .  235053_237463
*PS051:	Ah .  237463_237603
*PS052:	to .  237603_237663

*PS052:	And they they 've .  238963_239623
*PS051:	role model is it really .  239623_240913
*PS052:	No I suppose marvellous to the wrong things Oh well And he he was talking .  240913_248843
*PS051:	Was anything else said or acted upon or shall I use the kids who are done today ooh tha that should be done .  248843_257723
*PS052:	No I do n't think so .  258923_260673
*PS051:	Done today .  260743_261223
*PS052:	No No I said erm I had a conversation with Gillian about reading about little bits of reading and I made the point that we 'd said last night about him barking at print reading through words that he did n't know and not asking what they were and she said she 'd noticed that And cos we had a bit of a laugh about it I do n't know what I 'm telling you about it for cos you hear him read anyway But she said yes she 'd noticed but she said they are getting more out of this Johnny Briggs book than the other book .  261223_295053
*PS051:	Mhm .  295053_295473
*PS052:	So she 's quite pleased that she 's put them on to it it is difficult .  296393_300413
