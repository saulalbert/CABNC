*PS09T:	If I worked magic things that were tragic would have no place beneath my waving wand With great magicians I 'll sit and converse the whole universe would seem like a little pond deer would swim by and as it swam by ravage by war neglect and in great pain I 'll take it out just to wipe its poor face clean and then quietly put it back again if I worked magic magic .  1227863_1283923
