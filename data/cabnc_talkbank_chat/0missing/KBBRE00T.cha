*KBBPSUN:	Those Were The Days was quite good this week . 
*PS03S:	Yes very good is it working . 
*PS03T:	Yes I think so did n't you like it today . 
*PS03S:	yes . 
*PS03T:	did n't know about that fish did you . 
*PS03S:	well I 've read I seem to remember something about it . 
*PS03T:	I mean you 've got ta remember all those years back all those things can you . 
*PS03S:	mind you for yea when old Charles 's said we crawled out the sea . 
*PS03T:	yes but it seemed a bit far fetched if they said that . 
*PS03S:	but any then look at it like this . 
*PS03T:	if that 's been caught now why has n't that changed . 
*PS03S:	well it 's the stoppage in evolution . 
*PS03T:	well in sixty nine or whatever . 
*PS03S:	but er you look at it like this then if we did n't crawl out of the sea and er evolve then did we just appear like a flash of lighting . 
*PS03T:	no no I 'm not saying that we did we did evolve . 
*PS03S:	oh . 
*PS03T:	but . 
*PS03S:	we must evolved somehow . 
*PS03T:	why has n't that fish that they caught recently evolved . 
*PS03S:	yes well I used to read a lot of story books travel avidly and I think I forget all about the author and the story but I remember one portion where they discovered a depression in the middle of a continent where it was in excess of and they 'd grown quite a different specie . 
*PS03T:	of what men . 
*PS03S:	the human human 's you know I know it 's only a story . 
*PS03T:	I know several stages I know that . 
*PS03S:	eh but er . 
*PS03T:	I mean there were several stages before they got to present day man but . 
*PS03S:	yes but they do know le let's go back a bit further but they do know at the beginning of the world most of it is water . 
*PS03T:	yes . 
*PS03S:	so it 's quite feasible . 
*PS03T:	oh it is . 
*PS03S:	if if if it was three quarters water er human 's must of been in the water to start with . 
*PS03T:	well not human 's but . 
*PS03S:	well whatever we comes . 
*PS03T:	antecedence of humans mm I do n't know . 
*PS03S:	I mean we 've still got a barren at the back somebody kicks you at the back on that barren and er in the skeleton that 's exactly like the barren in a monkey 's tail . 
*PS03T:	mm . 
*PS03S:	so at one time the theory is we our we did have a tail . 
*PS03T:	mm yes but we did n't have a tail in the sea then did you . 
*PS03S:	and then another thing you got . 
*PS03T:	fish do n't have . 
*PS03S:	fin finger nails well surely millions of years ago they were claws . 
*PS03T:	possibly . 
*PS03S:	then you 've got your two prominent teeth they could of been the tiger 's two teeth . 
*PS03T:	mm . 
*PS03S:	and then there 's another theory with your feet you know that bit of skin between your toes they claim that was web at one time . 
*PS03T:	well is n't you do n't know much of . 
*PS03S:	not know of course there 's a wears away with lack of use but when you 're in the water you want web feet because there . 
*PS03T:	yeah . 
*PS03S:	the water I 'll go through your fingers . 
*PS03T:	mm mm . 
*PS03S:	this this skin here . 
*PS03T:	yeah I know that . 
*PS03S:	it 's not pronounced in mine but some er they say that with where it 's gone away you know there 's all sorts of things that can prove it I mean the obvious thing is we came from somewhere did n't we we did n't just drop here with a flash of light and er they 've studied plants and other animals and they evolved . 
*PS03T:	Yes but plants evolved with men 's man 's . 
*PS03S:	I hope that they they had had on their own for . 
*KBBPSUN:	0 . 
*PS03S:	a million years the plants did . 
*PS03T:	I do n't know probably several hundred million years mm ca n't really understand them can you . 
*PS03S:	well you 'd go mad if you tried would n't ya like that man said the other week er you human 's invented god well they did did n't they . 
*PS03T:	mm did you take that tape out in the other room . 
*PS03S:	yeah to cut cut a in that . 
*PS03T:	oh did you know . 
*PS03S:	and the other thing . 
*PS03T:	do you know where it is because it i n't in this . 
*PS03S:	yes I left it there to call off . 
*PS03T:	oh I see . 
*PS03S:	well if I 've left it there to call off I 'm not gon na put it in the case and shove it away . 
*PS03T:	well I know well you want to label it so you know what 's on it just reminding you you say oh you 'll say you did n't remind me to write it down . 
*PS03S:	yes cos you always right you remind me at the wrong time and the wrong thing . 
*PS03T:	no I do n't . 
*PS03S:	yes you do oh I was gon na say something you put me off now . 
*PS03T:	mm I 'm always putting you off I put myself off you do n't concentrate . 
*PS03S:	well you 're alr the point it 's greater the things they find it that er three quarter of the world were water once . 
*PS03T:	yes I know you said that you going to have the Antiques Roadshow at . 
*PS03S:	and then there 's another thing yeah if you like another thing Evelyn you know when they give these rock foss fossils out of rocks . 
*PS03T:	yes . 
*PS03S:	big sand stone rocks they find things that fish today er had had got other pediments that million years back same thing but not not not the same as they are today you know well they must of got hold of it to be different from a million years ago . 
*PS03T:	mm . 
*PS03S:	those shell fish things they 're always on about in they get out the rocks . 
*PS03T:	five thirty Antiques Roadshow on B B C one it 's in Cleethorpes . 
*PS03S:	ten minutes then . 
*PS03T:	huh from Cleethorpes I should n't think they 'd get much from there oh they might get some ships might they . 
*PS03S:	yes do n't . 
*PS03T:	they might get erm . 
*PS03S:	true then there 's another thing about religion I 've often wondered they say you go to heaven do n't they well so well . 
*PS03T:	well no . 
*PS03S:	no but some sort of place well when when you look at these pictures now the satellites been going twelve months still going through . 
*PS03T:	two or three years . 
*PS03S:	well where 's heaven then in all that lot . 
*PS03T:	no . 
*PS03S:	and how 'd how 'd ya get there when you 're dead . 
*PS03T:	well you do n't that 's just . 
*PS03S:	well then why do they carry it all on . 
*PS03T:	well they do n't really so much today people . 
*PS03S:	yes but you talked listened to a parson on telly he 's convinced what he 's saying true yet it 's only what he 's been told in it . 
*PS03T:	mm . 
*PS03S:	with all this killing of children and that and burning them alive with flame throwers what what if this higher high of command why do n't he interfere . 
*PS03T:	there is n't .
