*TON:	So it's not for me to sort of sit quietly and listen to, record other people, so it's my conversation they want.

*JAC:	M F I.
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	And it's, it's the colour she wants, and not only has she got drawers, but she's got shelves down that side as well.

*TON:	Ok.
*JAC:	But we can get her, that   (        ) Christine   (.) Christine.
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Come and see, you know originally you wanted a white desk, not a black one.
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Do you like the look of that with book shelves down the side there?
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Yeah, you've got three doors which is more storage space than the other one, cos the other one only had a cupboard down   (        ) had no drawers, what's the matter?
*TON:	Doesn't like it, you prefer the other one?
*CHR:	Yeah, I do.
*JAC:	It's just that you, your better of space if you have that one and you can books down there or on them whatever you want too   (.) and if you had that one, you'd be able to have a, erm another cupboard as well probably.Is it cheaper?
*TON:	Well .
*JAC:	It's only cheaper because it's in a sale, it's been reduced down from forty pounds, it was forty pounds before.
*TON:	No, if, if she didn't like it then we  (.) 
*JAC:	Well you can go and have a look if you like  (.) 
*TON:	A .
*JAC:	If you don't like it it's up to you .
*CHR:	No I'm .
*TON:	What's up?
*CHR:	Nothing.
*JAC:	What's up? there is, we can tell, what's the matter?Tell us.
*CHR:	I like that one and now you've put me in a difficult position cos I like that one, have that one, but I like the lockable cupboard on the other one.
*TON:	Lockable cupboard? there isn't a lockable cupboard .
*JAC:	Yes there is .
*CHR:	Yes there is .
*TON:	Is there.
*JAC:	Yeah .
*CHR:	Yeah .
*JAC:	Yeah, but the other one, remember it was a choice of two wasn't it?
*TON:	I thought we were getting her the one with the drawers   (.) one with a lockable cupboard is,
*JAC:	Well , is a bigger one.
*TON:	is a bigger one.
*JAC:	Yeah  (.) 
*TON:	I thought we were getting her the one, but the only thing is the other has got drawers both sides hasn't it? if I remember rightly.
*JAC:	Just one side   (.) I tell you what, let's take you, don't do that, or you'll break it off, let's take you and you can have a look at this one.Why do you want a lockable cupboard? (.) we don't   (        ) well it's very  (        ) , so why do you need a lockable cupboard?
*CHR:	Cos I just need one, I just like it  (.) 
*JAC:	Well I don't think that one will fit in your bedroom in any case, having looked at the size of the wardrobes and the site of the gap that you've got.
*TON:	No it was the other one, with the t , with the drawers that, that would er
*JAC:	That we thought was best  (.) 
*TON:	Smaller one  (.) 
*JAC:	Well let's have a think, we'll, we'll have a think and then have a look, if we go up there it's a huge furniture place, they won't have just one they'll have more than one ok?How about that?
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I said, they won't just have one designer desk will they?
*TON:	No, we'll have a look around, and see what they've got.
*JAC:	If they   (        ) just furniture ok, whereas Argos do a lot of other things as well, so if we take you over there you can have a look see if there's anything you really fancy.I know it's awful   (        ) making you actually have to   [laughing] decide for yourself  [] .
*CHR:	I, I .I like the one with the lockable cupboard door, but I like that one as well.
*JAC:	I don't think that one will fit in .Yes.
*CHR:	If they took out one of these drawers and have a lockable cupboard I'd have it no questions.
*JAC:	Yeah, well let's go and have a look, ok.
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAC:	Don't make up your mind one way or the other, cos were have to take our tape measure.
*CHR:	 (        ) that bit of icing.
*JAC:	No.
*TON:	What's that?
*CHR:	Go on.

*JAC:	She's asked for the icing of off our cake not our cake and she's not having it.Do you want a gingerbread man with your cup of tea?
*CHR:	 (        ) .
*JAC:	Oh, told you, got to eat all her dinner, oh, wow, gee 
*TON:	Well, she had a chocolate biscuit, she had one of those snack things and an orange chocolate biscuit
*JAC:	Mm.
*TON:	and I said well if you have that now, you better eat your dinner.
*JAC:	Ah.
*TON:	And that was well erm,ha about an hour ago now.
*JAC:	I see, torturing that child again aren't you? ((laugh)) .
*TON:	That's right, I've been exceedingly cruel to her.
*JAC:	Childline, Childline   (.) Den got us a Hovis loaf it looks   (        ) than the other one.
*TON:	Mm.
