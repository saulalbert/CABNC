*TIM:	  (  )  
*DOR:	Come on. Let's be getting going. Are we having this story?  (.) Are you ready?  ((reading)) Timmy the catcher mouse was a little black cat. Timmy the catcher mouse was a very long name for a very little cat so everyone called him   (.) Tim. 
*TIM:	Tim. 
*DOR:	Tim lived in a hole under the steps of a very old house. He lived there with his mother   (.) and his sister Tessa .

*TIM:	Pegs. ((laugh))  
*DOR:	That's right.  (.)  ((reading)) One day Pegs was going out. You can play in the garden while I'm away she said. But remember this. A magician lives in the house   (.) everyone says that he's very grumpy so if you meet the magician you must be very polite. I'll remember said Tim . (.)  
*TIM:	Tim   (.) er 
*CHR:	Mum, that's    (  )   
*DOR:	 Tim and   
*TIM:	Pegs. 
*DOR:	That's right.  (.)  ((reading)) Pegs went out. She ran across the garden to the old iron gate. She crept under the gate and out into the lane . (.)  
*TIM:	Pegs.  (.) Er Pegs said

*TIM:	Pegs went out.

*CHR:	Mum that's seven. 
*DOR:	It is, yes. 
*TIM:	Pegs went out. 
*DOR:	Mhm. 
*CHR:	Mum, to do a seven you have to go across and then down. 
*DOR:	You do, you're right. 
*TIM:	 Mummy. 
*CHR:	And then up. 
*DOR:	 ((reading)) Tim looked at his sister. She was fast asleep. 
*CHR:	I used to do it that way  (  )  
*DOR:	Tim jumped on her to wake her up but she only said go away, and went back to sleep again .  (.) What does this bit say? Do you remember? (.)  
*TIM:	Tim   (.) er 
*DOR:	Jumped. 
*TIM:	Tim jumped. 
*DOR:	That one bit says Tim and that bit there says jumped. Tim jumped. (.)  
*CHR:	That's five isn't it? 
*DOR:	Yes.  (.) Whoops, we've missed, I lost our page there  (  ) .  ((reading)) Tim got out of the hole. The sun was shining and the sky was blue. Tim went out into the garden . 
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Hold on. You've got to say this bit first. 
*TIM:	Tim went out. 
*DOR:	Very good. That was a bit clever. 
*CHR:	Is that all done? Are they all done now? 
*DOR:	 ((reading)) Tim saw a tree  well   (.) er they look all done to me. 
*TIM:	Tim saw a tree. 
*DOR:	That's right.  ((reading)) The tree was growing near the house . 
*TIM:	He's gonna go up there in the   (  ) the house. 
*DOR:	Do you want to try that one? 
*CHR:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	It's a bit like what we've been doing before where you've got to look at the money. It said   ((reading)) how much for both? Tick the money you will need . You have to tick off. It's going to be nine p and one p. That makes ten p altogether and you have to tick off the ten pence   (.) by doing a five and a five. So you have to add this bit up  first. 
*TIM:	 Mummy. 
*DOR:	Three p and five p and write down what it comes to.  (.) What will that be? 
*CHR:	So you have to tick  that one off? 
*TIM:	  ((shouting))  (  )  
*DOR:	Wait a minute. Well find that first of all. Three p and five p makes? (.)  
*TIM:	Read it. 
*DOR:	Jus  can I just show Christopher what to do with this page? Cos once he's got going he can get on with it himself then. 
*CHR:	Eight. 
*DOR:	That's right. So put your eight p down there.  (.) And then you have to work out the coins that you'll need  for eight p   
*TIM:	 Mummy. 
*DOR:	or three p and five p. 
*TIM:	Mummy.  Mummy. 
*DOR:	 So which ones will you need?  Just tick them off, the bits that you'll need. 
*TIM:	 Tim went    (.) ran up  the tree. 
*CHR:	 Erm   
*DOR:	Nearly. Tim ran to the tree. 
*TIM:	Ran to  to the tree. 
*CHR:	 Will I need two  and two and one? 
*DOR:	Will you need what love? 
*CHR:	Two two and one. 
*DOR:	Two two and one. That would make five. And then you need another three. Why don't you have the fi  look for the three p first   (.) and tick that off and then look for the five p next and tick that off. (.)  
*CHR:	Tick five p off?  Tick five p off. 
*TIM:	 I don't know this bit. 
*DOR:	Mm.  Cos you know that five p and three p are gonna make eight p don't you? 
*TIM:	 Mummy   (.) mum.   (.) Does that  say   
*CHR:	 Five p   (  )  
*DOR:	Just hold on Tim while I just sort him out. Cos if  (  )

*TIM:	Mummy. (.)  
*DOR:	 ((reading)) Tim climbed to the very top of the tree. He looked down and saw the house. The roof of the house was very close to the top of the tree . (.)  
*CHR:	Three. 
*TIM:	Tim 
*CHR:	You haven't got a three  p.

*TIM:	Tim   (.) fell in. 
*DOR:	Well done.  (.)  ((reading)) The magician woke up with a yell of pain. He saw Tim standing on his knee. Where on earth did you come from? He asked. I fell in said Tim. Then you'd better fall out again said the magician. Take your claws out of my knee and go away . (.)  
*TIM:	Tim
