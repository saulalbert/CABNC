*TIM:	my milk. 
*DOR:	Pardon? 
*TIM:	When I'm  drinking   
*DOR:	 There isn't  any in there yet. We're waiting for you to sit down properly then we'll start giving you things like milk. Cos it starts going all over the place.  (.) Come on.  (.) Timothy. (.)  
*TIM:	There. 
*DOR:	Ooh. 
*TIM:	I drink that    (  )   
*DOR:	 I shall have your  guts for garters one day.  (.) Oh, good job I don't wear glasses isn't it? ((laugh))  (.)   (  )

*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*AND:	Last night, before I came home   (.) he dragged me into his office to   (.) work out how much money   (.) we spend   (  ) Pontypool   (.) delivering parts to Solihull. 
*DOR:	And do you know?  No, so you had to sit and work it out. 
*AND:	 We had, we had to work it out.  Yeah. I sat with a price list. He sat with a calculator. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*AND:	He only did that simply because he gets asked questions. 
*DOR:	Mm. 
*AND:	Thing I don't approve of is the fact that   (.) when I ask questions 
*DOR:	You  don't get   
*AND:	 that he needs  and he needs to speak to his boss, he doesn't get answers from his boss. But when his boss chases him for, you know   (.) information or whatever you know  (  ) . (.)

*DOR:	  (  ) information.

*DOR:	Oh dear. (  )  (.)  
*CHR:	There's lots of Alpen in here but not very many sultanas. 
*DOR:	Really? They're probably all at the bottom. 
*CHR:	What? 
*DOR:	They are probably all at the bottom. 
*CHR:	 (  )  (.) You say they're always at the top. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh))  (.) Actually they do tend to be, don't they? They tend to be at the top and then there's sort of little bits and pieces go at the bottom. So perhaps you'd had it. Perhaps you won't get any sultanas now. 
*CHR:	Why? 
*DOR:	Till the end of the Alpen.  (.) I don't know. I'm just guessing. (.)  
*AND:	I'm afraid the toast wasn't very square shaped. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*AND:	Somebody must have sat on the loaf or something. 
*DOR:	Probably squashed it on the way home from  Tesco's. 
*TIM:	  (  )  you squash it. Then    (  )   
*AND:	 Well it did  get squashed. Did you see? What's happened to the loaf? Somebody must have sat on it, or pulled it or    (.)   (  )   
*TIM:	  (  )  if you  do that   
*CHR:	 I   (  ) one. 
*AND:	No. You'll find your sandwiches at work will be a little, your sandwiches at school will be  a little bit squashed. 
*DOR:	  ((laugh))  
*AND:	Well he works. 
*DOR:	He works at school. 
*CHR:	What? 
*DOR:	Daddy told, said when your sandwiches are at work. (.)  
*AND:	You know what I meant. 
*DOR:	He meant at school. But then he said you do work at school so it's alright. 
*AND:	Course he does. Works very hard. (.)  
*CHR:	Oh, it's a big fat one, this. (.)  
*TIM:	Be careful    (.)  ((shouting)) stop.  (.) You're having all of it .

*AND:	Yes. 
*DOR:	Everybody else was sitting on the train. We had to run quick to get on it. 
*TIM:	Because, because the little train nearly without us. 
*DOR:	Mm. Did nearly go without us. 
*CHR:	If it went without you 
*DOR:	We'd have to catch the next one.

*TIM:	We'd have to wait for the next one then. 
*DOR:	Mm. 
*AND:	So are we all being   (.) examined today?

*TIM:	 Can I have some Marmite  on this? (.)  (  )  
*DOR:	Are the children supposed to go every six months? 
*AND:	Something like that. 
*DOR:	Well that's okay. So it ought to work out  twelve and a six month   (  )   
*TIM:	 Mum. 
*DOR:	so that we go every  twelve and they go every six.

*TIM:	 No. 
*AND:	 Yeah. (  )  
*DOR:	And do  what? Private? 
*TIM:	  ((shouting)) Mum   (.) mum . 
*AND:	Private work. Cos they say they don't get paid enough money for the N H S. 
*DOR:	So people like, except the children you mean? 
*AND:	No. For everybody.  (.) The vast majority of dentists have threatened  to   (  )   
*DOR:	 Well  how come when we're paying so much?  Do you want   
*AND:	 Well because  you'd have to pay even more   (.)  if you did it privately. 
*TIM:	 My throat hurts. 
*DOR:	Oh I see. 
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Is it dear? Do you want two  (  ) ? 
*TIM:	Yeah. (15.0)  
*CHR:	Mm mm mm. A   (  ) please. 
*DOR:	  (  )  
*CHR:	 A messy   (  ) . A  (  ) ? What's a  (  ) ? I can't wear my new shoes this morning  can I? 
*DOR:	 Why not?  Oh no you can't cos it's school.  (.) You can wear them when you get home. 
*CHR:	Mm. 
*DOR:	And walk to the dentist. 
*CHR:	What? 
*DOR:	And walk to the dentist in your new shoes. (.)  
*CHR:	And at the dentists. 
*DOR:	Yeah. Well you don't take your shoes off at the dentists. 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	He doesn't look at your feet, he only looks at your teeth. He'll get a shock when he sees your teeth won't he?  (.) Four of them have changed  since you last came. 
*CHR:	 Is it today?   (.) Is it today? 
*DOR:	Mhm. 
*CHR:	Oh. It feels funny when she   (.) you do it. Mum. 
*DOR:	Yeah. (.)  
*CHR:	Is it   (.) are you going to be checked? 
*DOR:	Yes. Mummy and daddy and you two.  (.) We're all going, family trip. (.)  
*TIM:	And me? 
*DOR:	Mhm. 
*CHR:	At the bed time? 
*DOR:	Yes and you. 
*CHR:	At bed time? (.)  
*DOR:	No, four o'clock it is. 
*TIM:	 I'm gonna look at my teeth. 
*CHR:	  (  )  
*DOR:	 It's a little, it's a little  ploy to get daddy home early. ((laugh))  
*CHR:	What? 
*TIM:	 (  ) gonna  look at my teeth? 
*DOR:	 Daddy'll have to come home  a bit early to have it done. 
*TIM:	 (  ) gonna look at my teeth? 
*DOR:	Yes. Will you let him?  (.) Yes? Will you sit on the chair, open your mouth, let him stick a mirror in? Aah. 
*TIM:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*CHR:	Stick a mirror in?  (.)  We don't   
*DOR:	 I seem to  remember last time you got two stickers didn't you, cos you had super clean teeth? I bet you only get one sticker this time. 
*CHR:	Why? 
*TIM:	You think I'm gonna get two? 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	You'd have to clean them out very   (  )  did that. 
*DOR:	 I think you  were a bit lucky to get two stickers.  (.) I would have thought one sticker would be sufficient really. (.)  
*CHR:	It was when Mrs   was there then wasn't it mummy? 
*DOR:	Was it? 
*CHR:	Mrs   was there. 
*DOR:	Mm probably.  Mm. 
*CHR:	 It was. 
*DOR:	Oh you went to school didn't you? There was a dentist came to school, remember?  (.) And we had a letter home saying something about you need to go to the local dentist or something for treatment. Poss  no possible treatment. And I think it was cos of the wobbly front tooth when   (.) you bent it back when you fell over my foot. 
*CHR:	But next time  it won't   
*DOR:	 So we  didn't bother going because we were regularly going anyway. 
*CHR:	What? (.)  
*DOR:	 ((clears throat)) 
*CHR:	You didn't bother going  cos we   
*DOR:	 No. 
*CHR:	were regularly going? 
*DOR:	Yeah. Well I  didn't see much point   
*CHR:	 What does regularly  mean? 
*DOR:	Regularly means that we go in anyway t   (.) every six months you go and have your teeth checked to see if they're okay. 
*CHR:	Every six 
*DOR:	So just when some   (.) some bod comes to school and   (.) opens your mouth and says ooh, this looks interesting, there's not much point because   (.) our own dentist knows about it. (.)  
*CHR:	So you don't really need to be checked at school? (  )   
*DOR:	 No I  wouldn't have thought so. But some people don't go to the dentist regularly, so they need to be checked at school.  (.) People like Michelle probably never set eyes on a dentist normally.  (.) It's probably a good thing for a dentist to have a look at her teeth and see what needs doing. (.)  
*CHR:	Because her mum   (.) and her mum doesn't  (  ) ? 
*DOR:	Mm probably. (.)  
*CHR:	They've never been? 
*DOR:	Probably not. 
*CHR:	Why? 
*TIM:	We have. 
*DOR:	I'm just guessing. We've been, yeah. But not everybody does. Well not everybody likes dentists  and they think that something   
*TIM:	 Well well we   
*DOR:	awful's gonna happen to them.  They're wrong   
*CHR:	 What? 
*DOR:	cos it's nice isn't it, at the dentist? (.)  ((clears throat))  (.)  
*TIM:	Think everyone goes. 
*CHR:	To the dentist. 
*DOR:	Well everybody   (.) ought to go to the dentist if they want to keep their teeth nice and healthy. But not everybody does cos some people get frightened of dentists and they think ooh I don't want to go there. But that's silly cos there's nothing to be frightened of is there? It's nice at the dentist. 
*TIM:	No no-one can get frightened. 
*DOR:	Mm. 
*CHR:	But they won't get stickers will they? 
*DOR:	True. 
*TIM:	They won't get stickers dad. 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TIM:	If  they go   
*CHR:	  (  )  got toothbrushes to give you    (  )  (.) but the     ((sounds like he's got his fingers in his mouth)) (  )  (.)  (  )  
*DOR:	Mm. 
*CHR:	can't see that can you? 
*DOR:	No, you can't see that. That's why you need a mirror. 
*TIM:	Could I have one of those  (  ) ? 
*DOR:	Can you have what? 
*TIM:	Have one of those things. 
*DOR:	What things? 
*TIM:	Those pink things that af  after we had our lunch. 
*DOR:	Pink things? 
*TIM:	Yeah. Er those things in that bottle. 
*DOR:	Oh I know what you mean. For your throat? 
*TIM:	Yeah. 
*DOR:	Yes you can do, just wipe your hands  first. 
*CHR:	 Why? 
*DOR:	Well he's got his sore throat here. (.)  
*CHR:	I've got a sore throat too. 
*DOR:	 Have you? Right. 
*TIM:	 And you. 
*DOR:	You can have one each. 
*CHR:	Where are they? 
*DOR:	In the kitchen. 
*CHR:	Would I spot it? 
*DOR:	I don't know. 
*TIM:	Think I'm going to get them because   (.)  I   (.) I   (  )
