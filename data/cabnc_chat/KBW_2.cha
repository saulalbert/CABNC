So this car that was trying to   (.) get out was sitting there waiting and there was no driver in sight and people were rushing about all over the station trying to    (.)  ((laughing)) find the driver . Anyway it didn't worry us cos we were behind the coach. But I did feel sorry for the man who was trying to get out cos   (.) he must have been in there for ages.  (.) I suppose they thought that there wouldn't be anybody trying to get out cos the train 
*AND:	Mm. 
*DOR:	wasn't due out.  (.) So I just left her getting on the bus. I didn't sort of wait till the bus had gone or anything.  (.) I finally managed to get a   (.) a card for the wedding   (.) in Tesco's.  (.) You know, I sent them a card, Mark  and Trish.
