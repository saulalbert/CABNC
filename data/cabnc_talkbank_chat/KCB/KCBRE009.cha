*PS0DY:	Oh really .  968735_968885
*PS0DX:	Wha what this is in the management side .  968885_969765
*PS0E2:	Oh yeah er well be a different one to that to start with but it 'll be earlier What 's actually happened is first of all Tracey 's leaving she 's been promoted to Area Telesales Manager for Talking Pages so she 's going up to Slough and Michelle will be going for that position and one other girl and the two others that are on management development one is now leaving cos she 's like burnt out she does n't want to do it any more and the other one 's going into the field so it 's literally just me and this other girl and Michelle but I 'm obviously just starting but next time around it 'll just be me again Di and Dianna is good at her work .  969825_1007756
*PS0DY:	Mm .  1007756_1007866
*PS0E2:	but she jus just has n't got a personality .  1007866_1010866
*PS0DY:	Yeah .  1011216_1011286
*PS0E2:	Erm she 's a very aggressive person .  1011296_1012476
*PS0DX:	Oh right .  1012596_1013836
*PS0E2:	And manner .  1014196_1014586
*PS0DY:	Oh yeah .  1014586_1015496
*PS0E2:	not not even like in the right situation she 's like just aggressive all the time and nobody particularly gets on with her or likes her because of this And they do say that they do n't feel that unless she changed her personality .  1015496_1028806
*PS0DX:	Mm .  1028826_1029046
*PS0E2:	she probably would n't become a manager because usually you think you can change and develop but I think she 'll be then be able to become a manager and she 'll sort of learn but she 'd have to actually change her personality for it .  1029046_1039606
*PS0E3:	Would she have to change her personality or not .  1039636_1044416
*PS0E2:	Shut up But er so hopefully Michelle will get this next Tracey 's position and obviously sort of in in the meantime and providing her position comes up they are bringing in a Telesales County Secretary which was n't gon na come in for about a year cos they wanted to sort of like trial it but now they 've decided if that 's what they want the position to do erm it 'll probably happen in the next two months and they said for me to go for it from our division so I said right okay .  1044696_1069526
*PS0E3:	Oh she wo n't like that .  1069526_1071776

*PS0DX:	Good .  1075976_1076066
*PS0E2:	Well it 's actually just basically the team it 's a new position that they 've actually made within each team now within each division which is like you 're dealing with higher accounts but a different type of account as well .  1076076_1089326
*PS0DX:	Oh jolly good .  1090516_1091596
