@Comment:	conversation #220 (Tape 003003)
*CHR:	It looks as if over there stuck on the wall they've got a   (.) rechargeable for hoover for taking crumbs off the tables.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Well as it's used in other muckier places I tend not to use it over cleaning table white cloths   (.) aah
*NOR:	I'm very well fed.
*CHR:	I'm very well fed too, I think I shall ask them for the bill  (.) 
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes I did. (        ) to clobber in Black Heath village   (.) I notice it didn't say that the premises are now called the age centre.
*NOR:	No   (.) today you see a lot of people wearing large earrings don't you?
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Is that why you wear such small ones?
*CHR:	As  so claims   (.) that was a rather naff comment actually, I can't imagine that, well I can imagine other people wearing big earrings because they're super confident.
*NOR:	Then you obviously had a   (.) you did say    (        )  (.) such a lot of   (        ) in the Radio Times somewhere I was reading today about er colours you wear.
*CHR:	Oh yes.
*NOR:	And how people who wear red   (.) go in in business situations go in to assert power   (.) you know I mean
*CHR:	You do mean women in red suits presumably not men in red ties!
*NOR:	No, men in red ties as well.
*CHR:	Oh really?
*NOR:	Yes   (.) When I put on red one day, I mean I don't think I have anything in red do I, but when I put on my clothes in the morning
*LYN:	Would you like some more coffee?
*CHR:	No thank yo would you like some more coffee?
*NOR:	No thank you.
*CHR:	Could we have the bill please?
*LYN:	Yes.
*NOR:	Erm   (.) I'm influenced by all kinds of things   (.) but I'm sure I'm not influenced by wishing for certain power or not.
*CHR:	You don't need to.
*NOR:	No, but I mean there are other such reasons   (.) I mean there may be   (        ) initially choosing clothes or something like that, but when I put them on in the morning   (.) I usually put them on to suit the weather   (.) and what's clean and what I've got tights to match.
*CHR:	Yes. ((laugh)) 
*NOR:	Which shoes are comfortable today.
*CHR:	Mhm.
*NOR:	Or clean today.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Whether I've got painting on them.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Erm   (.) what I wore yesterday and the day before   (.) and also practical things like that.
*CHR:	Yep.
*NOR:	I think you need a lot of room for  (        ) 
*CHR:	Very true.
*NOR:	Whether its going to influence me or not  (        )
