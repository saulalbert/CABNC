*BRE:	But it's, I mean   (.) like Tracey said are you disappointed?I said well no I cos I said I expected a co  (.) I think she deserved a more than a commended.But I said it's always the way when you think it's a good examiner she or   (.) she, she gives you bad results and when it's a bad, think oh an awful examiner   (.) I mean look at that one where you got that really tough examiner and you and Jenny was the only two that got honours. (.) But I didn't that Michelle   ((yawn))

*BRE:	Yeah but it's like Leanne.I don't know how Leanne always gets   (.) it must be the fact she's slim.But Tracey said they obvious this examiner   (.) has obviously looked  (.) 
*CAR:	Got any scissors?
*BRE:	for slim people.Which is wrong.
*CAR:	But that's not very nice though, is it?
*BRE:	No.But that's what Tracey said.That's what happened with her.She went in with sl slim girls and they all fa fail passed, and Tracey failed. (.) Because Tracey was
