@Comment:	conversation #7 (Tape 051801)
*VIC:	I know you can get sport, weather, news whatever on   (        ) but I wouldn't know what else you can get or what page.
*JOA:	Oh well I haven't got as far as that because I
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*VIC:	So how do you know just what is available?
*JOA:	Erm   (.) I shall have to sit one afternoon   [laughing] and go through it all  [] .
*FRE:	Yes well i if you're on one 
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*JOA:	 (        ) I think it was erm   (.) when John was tt playing with it 
*VIC:	Fiddling around 
*JOA:	I, I noticed
*FRE:	Yeah.
*VIC:	He just stood there   (        ) 
*JOA:	Ernie's Ernie's winning numbers.
*VIC:	Ernie's winning numbers?Ah.Bet it wasn't ours was it?
*JOA:	I don't know what mine are to tell you the truth.
*VIC:	Well you'll have to have yours glued erm tt to the side of the television set when Ernie's numbers comes up you can
*JOA:	Well they're supposed to let you know aren't they if erm   (.) if you win?
*VIC:	They are supposed to tell you.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*VIC:	I'm sure they will let you know. (.) 
*JOA:	Cos when it first started I used to   (.) check in the Sunday paper every day but er I dunno   [laughing] it's a waste of time  [] .They've got the address, they're supposed to let you know when
*FRE:	Yeah
*JOA:	you come up. (.) I have a niece who   (.) erm she had quite a few, she's won several times. (.) And it's a case of coals, taking coals to Newcastle   (        ) 
*FRE:	 [laughing] Yeah   [] yeah. (.) 
*JOA:	But it would be quite nice to collect on, on something.But you get quite a lot of these   (.) erm I suppose they're trying to promote what they're say selling   (.) you are, you have been picked out of Nottingham
*FRE:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] 
*JOA:	to have these er four numbers, a chance to win about twenty thousand. (.) I keep sending them back but   [laughing] I haven't got the twenty thousand   [] yet. (.) Ah I did win s  (.) it was before, before Tasha and John got married it was er one of these catalogues that came through you see   (.) anyway I sent the thing back and I got the catalogue and they wanted some things out and you get twenty five pounds off whatever you ordered, the first order, so quite alright   (.) but I did win something out of that draw    (.)  [laughing] twenty five P  [] 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	they sent me a cheque for twenty five P and I was going to tear it up   (.) I thought well no I might as well put it in the   (.) in the bank   (.) twenty five P.And I waited till I'd got a few   (.) bit more money to put in and sort of hid it amongst all these others, mm.Yeah twenty five P I won on that one. (.)  ((talking to dog))What have you got your nose there for? (.) But talk about a hassle   (.) they wanted, they, well they picked the be the pr you know the present that you c you claim erm, a deep fryer   (.) and I think it was in March time   (.) and by July it still hadn't come in spite of ringing and writing and everything else
*FRE:	Really?
*JOA:	and then they informed me that it was out of stock so I wrote them rather a   (.) a polite   [laughing] letter   [] saying that it took them a long to realize it was out of stock when it had been ordered in March   (.) and erm   (.) I thought their communi communicative system in their office was er non existent.Anyway they said what else would they like and they had some, a set of luggage, well it's only this nylon stuff but it was very useful for them to take away with them   (.) it did a bit of good the   (        ) and I, I put in this letter   (.) I shall no longer order, I shall   (.) what was it?I shall be very wary of having any contact with your firm   [laughing] again  [] .They're still pestering me, sending me letters and   (.) we haven't heard from you recently
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	what would you like from   [laughing] the catalogue sort of thing   [] and I only had this catalogue to    (        )  (.) Cos I pa you know I paid for it   (.) what di did they have?Oh I think an electric drill   (.) it was in the sixties   (.) so with the twenty five pounds off   (.) it brought it down a bit and I, I paid for it with one cheque so I wasn't having it on the weekly er   (.) er it worked out   (        ) I think Vicki gave some of it towards it. (.) But I thought if that's how they run a business   (.) So then when they, they moved house I realized they were using an ordinary saucepan to do their chips in   (.) and I had visions of fat boiling over and   (.) cos it's gas   (.) so I bought them one a   (.) very nice deep fryer as a housewarming present. (.) It came in very useful because they were quite a while before the gas was connected. (.) But you've only got, if you w if you put   (.) chips in a basket in a   (.) chip pan if it, the fat boils up you can at least lift the chips out straight away but if you're putting them straight into the pan there's no hope of stopping it coming over.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*JOA:	Oh I kept thinking of this fire hazard   (.) thought I can't, I can't   [laughing] live with that any longer 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	with the thought of them using a saucepan. (.) Cos they hadn't seen any danger to it I suppose. (.) So then John, he tries all sorts of things out, you know doughnuts and   (.) things like that and it's a thermostatically controlled
*FRE:	Yeah
*JOA:	one so he knows what the temperature's going to be and er he's   (.) I think he's quite enjoyed experimenting with it. (.) They've got quite a nice   (.) it's not a large house but it's a good size   (.) lounge and dining room and kitchen.The bathroom is downstairs but there are three bedrooms so it's quite a decent   (.) size for them. (.) But the base of the bed is still in the dining room, they can't get it up   [laughing] up the stairs    []  (.) although i although it folds up, you know, it's   [laughing] it's standing like this in   [] in the dining room. (.) The cat er likes it there, it goes and sits on the top of it. (.)  [shouting] You're not cooking are you? (.) Vicki  [] ? (.) Sh she got the door closed? (.) 
*FRE:	Sounds though er soun well
*JOA:	She gets in that kitchen you know and
*FRE:	sounds like  (.) 
*JOA:	 [shouting] Vicki
*VIC:	 [shouting] Hello  [] 
*JOA:	you're not cooking are you  [] ?
*VIC:	I can't hear with the washer going.
*JOA:	You're not cooking are you?
*VIC:	No.
*JOA:	Oh.What are you busy doing?
*VIC:	I've just washed the wine glasses out.
*JOA:	Oh well I would have come and done those   (        ) 
*VIC:	Ah there's only four.I've done them now.
*JOA:	Oh right. (.) Being lazy.I had such a lazy week   (.) Christmas week   (.) I went down to er Northamptonshire to my son's.All I did was   [laughing] wash up   [] and we didn't do anything else.Talk about being lazy.They wouldn't let me do a thing. (.) Never went out till Friday because it was, they went walking but it was so windy cos   (.) they're here and the garden's sort of down to a field and then it's all fields and fields and fields and the wind just   (.) comes across like gales all the time. (.) I think I've never spent such a lazy week. (.) 
*FRE:	Were you here at Christmas?
*JOA:	No.
*FRE:	You were down there?
*JOA:	Mm.
*FRE:	Mm.
*JOA:	Went on the Saturday.They came up to view Heidi's riding display then I went back with them and Vicki and Malcolm diverted from Barford on the Sunday where they'd been for lunch and picked me up Sunday afternoon the sort of following weekend. (.) First time I hadn't spent Christmas with Vicki I think since they were married. (.) We went to the theatre in London on the Friday night. (.) They have erm   (.) what's called the players' theatre, I don't know whether you've heard of it at all erm they belong, they're members of it.It's only the ground floor, really, and it is set out with a bar at the back and refreshments like the old music halls used to be with every so often, every few seats there is a table so that it's a thing to have your drink and refreshments to hand at the table.And before the proceedings you drink the health to Queen Victoria
*FRE:	 [laughing] Oh yes  [] 
*JOA:	and it's a, an old fashioned music hall, more often than not well   (.) when we went it was a pantomime but the first   (.) part of the evening was an o a music hall
*FRE:	Mm.
*JOA:	type of entertainment, then it was a pantomime, Beauty and the Beast, but they keep as near to the original script as they can always, well it was written eighteen fourteen or something. (        ) quite entertaining. (.) And you sing chorus so you know they give you a song sheet and you sing then. (.) It's very expensive to   (.) for what it is, I mean it's fifteen pounds a ticket but if you, if you're a member of course you get in reduced
*FRE:	Yes.
*JOA:	But you've got to, Terence said it's so dear to be a member you have got to keep going to get your, your money back. (.) But it's, it's a nice homely   (.) it's all been refurbished in the last year. (.) And they've made a very nice restaurant on the top floor.Only a very small one but it's very nice   (.) nice food. (.) Then when we came out we s went    (.)  (        ) around London to see the sights but   (.) the decorations but why we went I didn't think anything to them at all this year. (.) Cos we didn't get ou we didn't   (.) fin it didn't finish till about
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*JOA:	well half past ten   (.) if not later so we were late getting home.
*FRE:	Mm. (.) 
*JOA:	But they pop down to London as though it's   (.) down   [laughing] into town but    []  (.) They're quite near the motorway so it's useful.
*FRE:	Yes well I've often said Northampton's about the right distance.Er y y 
*JOA:	Yeah.
*FRE:	you can, it's within striking distance isn't it?
*JOA:	Yes. (.) It doesn't take them long at all to get in the outskirts of London, it's weaving your way
*FRE:	Yeah.
*JOA:	through when you've got there.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*VIC:	 ((laugh))  (        )  (.) 
*JOA:	Well her mum's knee wasn't there so she thought she 
*VIC:	Ah!
*JOA:	she might as well sit on her gran's 
*VIC:	Her mum's knee will be back.
*JOA:	on her gran's knee.
*VIC:	Mum's knee will be back.Ah! (        ) somebody else's knee? (.) Don't want   (        ) do you Luce? (.) 
*JOA:	Is his eye running again?I think he must have a bit of cold in it or something.Have you still got a hair in   (.) from your
*VIC:	Haircut.
*JOA:	haircut?
*VIC:	This weather's enough to give anybody a cold eye isn't it?Mm?
*JOA:	Well we set out with the good intention of taking her for a long walk this morning but er   (.) we changed our mind didn't we? (.) 
*VIC:	Didn't do, didn't think it would do you any good did we?
*JOA:	Oh it was so damp and ooh and miserable 
*FRE:	Oh it was miserable yeah.Yesterday it was very cold but it was very nice
*JOA:	Yes.
*FRE:	and dry wasn't it?
*JOA:	Yes I, I walked from er where was it, Langmere Lane? (.) 
*VIC:	Walked from    (.)  (        ) road   (.)  (        ) 
*JOA:	Well wasn't, isn't that Langmere Lane where you park the car?
*VIC:	No Langmere Lane's the other side of the garage. (.) 
*JOA:	Well what's that lane called then? (.) 
*VIC:	Tt that goes into Compton Acres doesn't it?I don't know what that's called. (        ) 
*JOA:	 (        ) car conked out so Vicki stayed with the car and her who we were going to take a walk in Ruddington, and I walked home with her to get Malcolm to   (.) go over with the other car.And it was quite ni actually although I was hurrying because I thought of them sitting in the car erm it was very pleasant walking, very slippery though along by Walford cemetery and all down there.
*VIC:	You really stepped out.
*JOA:	Yes.
*VIC:	Nice crisp morning wasn't it?
*JOA:	It was a pleasant morning for walking, it would have been quite   (.) nice   (        ) 
*VIC:	But it was cold   (        ) waited.
*JOA:	Well you were frozen weren't you waiting?Cold day, it was me that   (.) but I think with hurrying so, quite a good walk.It's alright when I first got in then after a while my legs   [laughing] all started going wobbly  [] .
*FRE:	Oh yeah. (.) 
*VIC:	But Saturday mornings we usually   ((cough)) drop Heidi don't we?
*JOA:	Yes.
*VIC:	 ((cough)) And then go in the
*JOA:	The building and leisure centre 
*VIC:	park.
*JOA:	leisure park at Ruddington and they've got a quite a lot 
*VIC:	Paths and 
*JOA:	yes of intersecting paths haven't they?
*VIC:	And it's just opposite where we drop Heidi, we used to walk along the road   (.) it doesn't really lead anywhere only to a couple of farms does it?But if we go in the park she can run more, or in the summer we go down by the old railway track don't we?
*JOA:	Yes.
*VIC:	Go through the farm and   (.) go along there.See the flowers and listen to the birds.Don't we?
*JOA:	But you had a walk on your lead yesterday didn't you? (.) And this morning we got as far as   (        ) didn't we?Went in for a hot chocolate and that was it we didn't
*VIC:	And then we just
*JOA:	well we did   (        ) 
*VIC:	we walked outside didn't we?
*JOA:	Yeah
*VIC:	So she could come off the lead.But it was so damp and cold and not nice was it? (.) 
*JOA:	She enjoys herself cos she chases around all the beds doesn't she there and
*VIC:	She doesn't go far she just, she just   (.) doesn't bother anybody else. (.) Do you? (.) And Heidi was going to phone to say what time she wanted collecting and so we'd got to be back   (.) couldn't be out too long could we?
*JOA:	No.
*VIC:	And leave the
*JOA:	We needn't have bothered though need we?
*VIC:	No!By the look of it. (.) Cos she asked last night, I was supposed to be taking Jenny and then when Fay came she asked me if I'd take Fay as well today so   (.) it looks as though Charlotte's mum did everybody took everybody home.
*JOA:	Mm.Well it's an awkward time to   (.) ask people to go and fetch them when they're   (.) if they're preparing dinner isn't it?
*VIC:	Most people don't have a Sunday dinner as they   (.) used to.I don't think it is a traditional
*FRE:	Not   (.) I don't think it is.
*JOA:	No.It is 
*VIC:	Mind you   (        ) 
*JOA:	when you go to our morning service it is. ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	 [laughing] Exactly  [] .
*VIC:	Well we always used to have what I call a traditional Sunday dinner 
*JOA:	Yes we did.Father used to   [laughing] like that so  [] 
*VIC:	but   (.) well sometimes we still do but sometimes we have something else   (.) instead don't we?
*JOA:	Totally different, yeah.
*VIC:	Yes. (.) 
*JOA:	Lives have changed.
*VIC:	Yeah, all changed. (.) But I think there are a lot of people that don't have a Sunday dinner, whatever   (.) form. (.) Think there are a lot of children that just have, well I think they must just live on snacks, they just  (.) 
*FRE:	Mm.
*VIC:	 (        ) something here, beans on toast, open a packet of this, tin of that and   (.) or a take away or  (.) 
*JOA:	Pizza or
*VIC:	mm. (.) 
*JOA:	We went to church last   (.) Sunday didn't we?
*VIC:	Mhm
*FRE:	 ((yawn)) 
*JOA:	Well it's the first time I've been
*VIC:	This year.
*JOA:	Well you're right yes, it would be this year   (.) but I didn't go much at the end of last year did I? (.) 
*VIC:	No well you were away  (.) 
*JOA:	I was away and then I had that awful little cough   (.) first thing in the morning   (.) erm   (.) and I think I, to be quite honest, I lost interest in going. (.) 
*VIC:	Well last Sunday it seemed to be going quite nicely to start with, trying to think what it was, communion 
*JOA:	It was Carole 
*VIC:	 (        ) communion yes
*JOA:	Carole   (        ) she's normally very interesting but she was   (.) very hard to hear.Carole .Malcolm said it was 
*VIC:	.Well she was 
*JOA:	very good didn't he?But he was sitting underneath her.
*VIC:	Yeah but we'd got erm tt oh, Leo  at the side of us   (.) so he was, do you know the  that do christian  (        ) ?
*FRE:	No I know of them.
*VIC:	Yeah what's her name?Sandra
*JOA:	Sa Sandra   (.) Sandra I think it is, Sandra     (.)  (        )  (.) You couldn't hear anything could you?
*VIC:	He was chattering away, dad was replying to him, he was up and down the steps, shuffling on the carpet and
*JOA:	They were having this game, you know, one hand on top of the other so
*FRE:	Oh!
*JOA:	it was clapping and
*FRE:	 [laughing] Oh dear  [] 
*VIC:	And you just   (.) But as we were saying er talking to Janet afterwards   (.) there was another little one down at the side, erm mum was getting a bit irate with him, but you see they don't take anything for the children to do.I mean you can't expect them to be quiet, just sit and do nothing all that time.
*FRE:	That's right.
*VIC:	It didn't finish till five to twelve did it last   (.) Sunday?
*JOA:	Well that's   (.) early, I should have thought it was
*VIC:	Was it after that?
*JOA:	Well I thought it was, yes.It might have been   (        ) 
*VIC:	Well you can't expect them to just   (.) sit.I mean fair enough you can't expect them to be quiet.But   (.) I think the parents should   (.) take something for them to do, I mean we used to take colouring books and books for the children to look at and
*FRE:	Yeah.
*VIC:	whatever so there was something to keep them occupied and erm   (.) you know have a bag and as soon as they got fed up with that right you'd get something else out to take their interest and
*JOA:	Well Peter did remark to this lady didn't he?Who's child was making a dickens of a commotion 
*VIC:	Noise, that the creche was in the   (        ) 
*JOA:	Yes.
*VIC:	and she did actually take him out at one time 
*JOA:	But she looked 
*VIC:	she looked absolute daggers when she took him out didn't she?And then she came in.
*JOA:	Yes and he
*VIC:	And he'd got a car
*JOA:	that he'd got out of the creche I think, cos he hadn't got it when he went out.
*VIC:	No, and of course he was running that along the seat
*JOA:	And dropping   [laughing] it  [] .
*VIC:	and dropping it off the seat and whatever.
*JOA:	But Leo hadn't got anything but he certainly made enough noise, oh dear.So what with Carole's soft voice and that we didn't get a lot of   (.) and it seemed as though it was well like that, several times I went last year and I really got   (.) a bit cheesed off.
*VIC:	Oh er yes I was going to say we suddenly heard a chorus didn't we?
*JOA:	Oh yes that was it.Oh well we've got   (        ) 
*VIC:	There are quite a few children in here, let's have some choruses. (.) I don't like that. (.) You're all in the mood and   (        ) 
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	along this line and then all of a sudden it's   (.) yes that's right it was before
*JOA:	Communion, yes.
*VIC:	we'd had the collection   (.) and then it was all choruses and then it was oh where were we, he'd, then he'd forgotten his glasses, couldn't find his glasses, what page were we 
*JOA:	Didn't know where he was.
*VIC:	 [laughing] Oh dear  [] .And then we went back to the prayer after the collection didn't we?
*JOA:	Mm. (.) Where are my glasses?So somebody had to tell him he'd left them at the
*VIC:	Altar.
*JOA:	altar. (.) 
*VIC:	So it was   (.) we'd got distractions and then we suddenly chip in with all these choruses   (.) er   (.) no!Didn't go down too well with me that didn't  (        ) .On a family service fair enough, when you've got the family service and it's all 
*FRE:	Yeah, mm, right.
*VIC:	you know, bits of this and bits of that but there again I think the family service ought to be a lot shorter than it is
*JOA:	Well it certainly should be because it's for the families, for the young children and they, they can't understand what it, all of it is about so   (.) it should be kept as simple and as short as possible. (.) And the ch and the children should have their own address.Er well one address that is suitable for children.Grown ups can sit and listen to it all close their ears.
*VIC:	Probably get far more response from the grown ups 
*JOA:	Erm but some of these childrens' addresses that we've had at St Paul's   (.) they are very interesting and you get something out of them.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*JOA:	I miss going to St Paul's really.Well we did go there one Sunday didn't we?
*VIC:	Mm.Was that when Malcolm was away?
*JOA:	Mm.
*VIC:	We could have gone today.We went on poppy day.
*JOA:	That was it.
*VIC:	Didn't we?
*JOA:	We used to go once a month you know when the girls were in the Guides, used to go for their parade service and if you were at Auckley, Malcolm and I used to go up with Heidi didn't I?
*VIC:	Mm.
*JOA:	Walk up. (.) And we got to know all the people there.
*VIC:	Mm. (.) And we went there for the Christmas one didn't we? (.) The midnight service.
*JOA:	Well I didn't cos I wasn't here.
*VIC:	Oh no.
*JOA:	No that's one thing I missed about Christmas. (.) Going to  (        ) .Well Jane did say   (.) no I don't think there's one in the village but if you want to go to one I'll take you to    (.)  (        ) Daventry would be nearest, yes, but she said I'll take you to one if you want to go. (.)  (        ) 
*VIC:	Yeah I think we went in November to er St Paul's didn't we?
*JOA:	Mm.Well you can fit so much in to an hour   (.) I mean it's not rushed.
*VIC:	And it's for the children. ((cough)) 
*JOA:	But it never lasts more than an hour whatever he does.
*VIC:	Yes Peter goes on and on and on.
*FRE:	Yes er and of course i if er rather like it seems as happened last week, if he seems to have got a bit of time he seems to need to have to extend it 
*VIC:	Fill it.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*JOA:	Yes he's not going to finish before twelve o'clock at the earliest, choose what. (.) I don't know whose idea it is that it goes on and on.
*VIC:	Yeah the eight thirty, the eight o'clock service is a lot more   (.) seems a lot more compact, I know you haven't got the hymns, but it seems to erm start, go on and finish, you know it
*FRE:	Mm.
*VIC:	it's all there
*JOA:	But that Sat Sunday when Hazel was here   (.) and I, and she didn't want to go so I said I'd stay with her and cook the dinner   (.) when y when you came back you said it's a good job you didn't come, it didn't finish till half past   (.) twelve and you came straight home and you were here about 
*VIC:	Oh that's right.What ha what was that Sunday? (        ) and then something extra, yes.That was a long one wasn't it?
*JOA:	I know when you came in you said well it's a good job you didn't come. (.) Can't remember, cos I don't think you stayed for coffee and you didn't get home till   (.) it was about ten to one wasn't it?
*VIC:	Mm.
*JOA:	Cos everything was cooked when you
*VIC:	Mm can't remember now.
*JOA:	when you got here.
*VIC:	Oh it's ridiculous I think. (.) So what service is it next week?Don't know. (        ) today wasn't it? (.)  (        ) 
*JOA:	Peter was saying, you know Peter ? (.) Yes his name is  isn't it?I always
*VIC:	
*JOA:	, Peter    (        ) 
*VIC:	Peter  and  (        )
