*BAR:	No one is allowed to go to sleep during this talk
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	simply because we want you to stay awake, physically and this will help you spiritually.But staying awake sometimes is very, very difficult to do isn't it?You'd recognize this if you are a driver and especially a driver who maybe has the opportunity of travelling long distance, now years ago when I was younger and perhaps some of you in the audience when you were younger, you could go from here to the South of England with no trouble, without a break and you'd head on down the motorway and you, you'd be alert and alive and er ready to meet up with all sorts of emergencies and you'd drive quite well all the way down, non stop down the South of England, but if you're like me now, when I get to Stafford on the motorway   ((laugh)) you're beginning to feel as if you've had enough and it's difficult to try and keep your concentration as you used to years ago, and that's how it can be in the truth sometimes, when we've been with it a long time   (.) that, we grow older   (.) not only physically, but spiritually too we become very experienced in the truth and we become very sort of fat spiritually, we can live off of that fat can't we?And er we can get by on lots of things and when an emergency does come, sometimes we can cope with it if it's not too big a one, but other times it can catch up with us, simply because we are only sort of half awake   (.) so the purpose of the talk today is to try and help us all to see various ways in which we can stay awake in the truth physic er, er spiritually speaking.We say don't we that, that the new ones that come along and then they really say to the truth, they're alive aren't they?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	They are spiritually awake and they sometimes put us to shame because they seem to make strides so fast that we have a job to keep up with them, they want to do this, they want to do that, they get baptized they want to auxiliary pioneer and before you know where the, where you are they're in the regular pioneer ranks, and that's lovely to see isn't it?But as we said earlier that some of us who have been in the truth for a long time we were like that years ago, but somewhere along the line we've become drowsy and a little sort of halfhearted and maybe dozing a little bit as we go down that sort of motorway er of spirituality and that, that the longer you go it can become more difficult because other things come along don't they?Like physical ailments and er our, our, our physical body doesn't work like it used to, and as you do get older there is a tendency to more to, to need more rest, we can't do what the young ones er do, and we would love to do that and that goes along with what the council and the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	doesn't it?It, do it now while you're young, while you've got your strength, because there will come days when you look around and you think well I just wish I could do that again, and that's the way we're made, and that's the way it will always be in this system of things, but there's lots of little things that we, you and I, can work on to help us to stay spiritually alert, vigilant and awake.Now in the scriptures, we're gonna have a look at a few because the scriptures counsel us time and again, er that we are living in difficult times, we know that and it can become difficult to stay spiritually alert and awake and that's why constantly throughout the scriptures you'll find that we're er counselled and encouraged to stay awake, stay awake and as we sang stand firm and, and grow mighty spirits, the first one is in Romans chapter thirteen. (.) Most of the scriptures we'll be looking at today is very familiar with us   (.) we know them and some of them we may be able to recite without even looking at the words, but er, if we can try and get you to think a little bit about them, then we've achieved something, if we can get you to think that, you know, well am I dozing or am I really awake as I should be, then we'll achieve more, in verse eleven it speaks there about er, you people knowing the season, well what people are we talking about?Us isn't it?It's within the congregation, Paulo was writing, not to those outside but to those dedicated baptized brothers and sisters in the trees, said   [reading] you know the season that it is already the hour for you to awake   [] so he was speaking to spiritual people, spiritually minded people and yet here he is telling them to be awake, awake from sleep or slumbers, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became the leavers, and that's true with us all if you came into the truth yesterday, the time that much nearer now isn't it?Because you can never go back to yesterday, if you came in last year or five years ago, ten years ago or longer, some of you have been in the truth for many, many years   (.) and it is nearer now than it ever was when you first came along and joined Jehovah's people and as it says   [reading] the night is well along   [] and if any of us have ever worked on the night shift, I think we're all well aware aren't we that when the night is well along and
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	you're coming near to the end of your shift   (.) you're not waking up because it's getting near morning whereas everybody else is, you're finding it much more difficult to carry on because you've gone through the whole night working, the night is well along and it becomes increasingly more difficult to stay awake so physically, spiritually, whatever way you look at it, it is certainly very difficult to stay awake in the truth today, but it isn't that difficult and it isn't er a hurdle that none of us can overcome, Jehovah says that his load is light, Jesus echoed that didn't he and it is true that if we do Jehovah's   (.) will, Jehovah's way, then it will be made light for us, he will help us to stay awake, but he's not going to allow us to slumber and drift off into obscurity, but it all comes back in hinges upon us and that's why the counsel is in verse thirteen   [reading] as a day, as in a day time look, let us walk decently   [] so we have to do something don't we?Walking means exercise, walking means effort, you and I have to do something to keep ourselves spiritually awake, going back to our illustration again about the car driver on the motorway, you find yourself after so many miles just dozing off because the road is so straight, not much traffic around, not much to think about apart from the countryside that goes by and you're there foot on the accelerator, no braking, no gear changing, nothing at all and you get to the point where you're driving one-handed by the thing, that's the time when you get so relaxed isn't it?That you can easily lose your concentration and go off to sleep   (.) and so it is in the truth, so we need to stay awake, stand firm for almighty, be vigilant and again in the scriptures we could look up half a dozen scriptures in the Christian Greek scriptures to show that we need to keep spiritually awake and it uses different terminology   (.) you've heard me use some already, remember the one in verse Peter four, verse seven?It tells us there to be vigilant, vigilant with a view to prayers, isn't that staying awake?Anyone who's vigilant knows what's going on and they're aware of what's happening, so again it, it shows that we must do something as they said on that motorway, the thing to do when you feel yourself going into drow drowsiness is, is stop the car perhaps, get out and have a walk round, do something, I know I, er in the past when I've felt myself going off to sleep in those situations, I've been pinching myself and, and really making yourself do something rather than just sitting there doing nothing, cos that's the way we just go off and get lowered into sleep and our lives are involved in this, we've read and heard about people that have gone to sleep on motorways haven't they?Where have they finished up?Crashing the car, taking someone else's life with them, terrible situations, terrible tragedies can come about because a person physically goes to sleep   (.) so it can be in a spiritual sense that we can nod off to sleep and not only our lives are involved, but our fellow brothers' and sisters' too,
*DON:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	especially if we have a, a responsible position within the congregation, because if we nod off, those of us who are elders, than others lives can be   (.) terrifically involved can't they?Because we are not doing what we should be doing, we'll hear a little bit more about that later, another one in Matthew twenty six and verse forty one, keep on the watch and pray continually, notice our New Year's text is all about prayer isn't it?Rejoice in the hope I had, that's lovely isn't it?Thinking about the, the, the hope ahead but what have we got to do?We've got to persevere in prayer, which means effort doesn't it?So in everything that we do and staying spiritually awake, we have to do something, it all comes back to you and I at the end of the day, no one else can do it for us   (.) we sometimes think well, well, so and so can help, I mean this is true to a degree, but at the end of the day it all comes back to us doesn't it?We're the ones that have said to Jehovah I am dedicating my life to you, I am going to do this, do that and the other and it's up to us as to whether we do it, so it requires effort, first  (        ) , five, six, also says   [reading] let us stay awake, keep our senses   [] first Peter, five, eight   [reading] keep your senses, be watchful   [] and then first Corinthians, ten, twelve which I think the song was based on   [reading] let him think that he is standing, beware, beware, beware that he does not fall  [] , if you think things are going along nicely and you're in a comfortable little corner, a little niche in the truth, and it's just how you like it, and it's just the way you want it to be and there's the time we need to be aware because there's an opening for Satan to get into to make us fall.Now going back into the Hebrew scriptures, you'll find there that this sort of staying awake counsel, an idea was there long before the days of Jesus and the Apostles and people's lives were involved in its state, even in those days, let's just let us have a look at one, Isaiah forty two   (.) eighteen to twenty   (.) now this terms it slightly different, but when you look at it and analyze it, you realize he's talking about exactly the same thing, it's regarding the nation of Israel who turned away from Jehovah, they weren't doing what they should be doing, or should've been doing as he's pleading with them look there, that look here, here you deaf ones, well we know the nation of Israel weren't all physically deaf, they were like we are, perhaps had a few deaf individuals amongst them, but
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	generally speaking the nation had good ears, they knew what was what and they listened quite well, hear you deaf ones he's describing them and look forth to see you blind once   (.) verse twenty it was a case of seeing many things, but you did not cheat watching and Daniel, verse twenty five, look it says there a little phrase near, half way through that he took no note, the nation took no note of what was happening at that time, but we know what happened to them, many of them, thousands, a million of them lost their lives didn't they?Because they were overthrown and the others were taken off into captivity into battle life, and what a life they had, the one of slavery, so at that time because they took no note, because they were destiny instructions to Jehovah for his word and again want to see, they had eyes, but they just didn't want to see it   (.) they knew, all the whys and wherefores and what the responsibilities were, but they didn't measure up to them and because of that many of them lost their lives, and if they didn't they were taken into captivity, Jeremiah four, in verse twenty two, again another prophecy sent to them exactly over the same message, the same reasons   (.) describes to them as being a, er people that is foolish and of me they have taken no notice Jeremiah four and verse twenty two.In Noah's day, if you go back to Noah's day it was exactly the same now, isn't that what Jesus said justice in the days of Noah, so it will be in there somewhere, they were eating and drinking and marrying and doing all the things that you, you know, you and I do today isn't it?And what is it, they took no note and the flood came and swept them all away.So it's been no different dying through time, the counsel has been there because Jehovah knows that we're all of falling flesh aren't we?We're all prone to do that, were all prone to take the line of least resistance and you find this not just in the truth but in any sort of community in life, in any area of life that wish to go, you, you may find this at work or at school, you youngsters, there's always a little Johnny at the back isn't it, that, that will fit in the back row and think if I'm back here teacher won't notice you see, were act were actually tuck himself up in the corner and er think well if I'm, if I'm up here nobody will notice me and see the day goes by and er we don't have so much to do, those are the type of people that in, in, in a physical life er sort of going to sleep aren't they, they don't want to accept responsibility and we, we find even in the truth, you'll always find it in congregations like we have here in our congregation, we're not different, we're all the same aren't we, we're all flesh and we're all imperfect and we're all prone to doing or wanting to do the things that are different or   ((laugh)) you know than, than what Jehovah wants us to do and we all want to tuck ourselves up a little corner sometimes and yet we shouldn't be like that and this is what the scriptures tell us and warn us about to put ourselves headlong into the truth, be whole sole, be awake, be alert, be vigilant to the things that are going on and there's a lot going on in the truth at this particular time, things are changing, the scriptures tell us that the scene of the world is changing and that's true isn't it?It changes so fast and here's we have a job to keep up with it.Did you know Jehovah's organizations always changes, not with it, but to combat it   (.) that way it comes to work, it keeps us alive, it keeps us on our toes, and so we could go on and on in saying well look keep away, stay awake and do everything that we should and, and we can stand here for the rest of the talk saying well do it, do it, do it   ((laugh)) but that's easy for me to do that isn't it?To tell you what to do   (.) but it's also knowing how to do it, because sometimes especially if we knew in the truth, we don't always know what to do and if we're very young you see, we're, it's, it's one
*DON:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	thing being told isn't it?But another thing to be shown how to do it and that's what, really what we want to try and do for the rest of the talk is to not just keep preaching at you and telling you what to do, but to show you how, so that's the purpose of the talk from now on, now in this outline there are, I've got about fourteen different points here and it'll highlight ways in which we can er stay awake, what I'm going to do is to read straight through them and then we'll go back and pick a couple out, because it's impossible to concentrate on the entire er amount, so we'll do that, it's er a number of things we can do to keep virtually awake   [reading] keep up with the food at the proper time from Jehovah's organizations   [] that's studying and things like that isn't it?They come up to meetings which erm, this goes on to say   [reading] determine not to miss a single spiritual meal   [] both private study, meeting attendance are urgent for all, there's nothing new here brothers it's all things that we've heard before and this is why sometimes we can sort of nod off because we, we sort of think well I've heard all this before, [reading] follow theocratic ways, procedures and policies   [] not always easy to do, but it can be done, [reading] recognizing the organization that Jehovah is using   (.) keep awake by finding your place in God's arrangement   [] that isn't that little corner up there, by the way, we're not talking about that one, but finding our place where we can work for Jehovah wholeheartedly    (.)  [reading] do not quibble about assignments and arrangements   [] I think we're all guilty of that at some time aren't we? [reading] Perform well whatever assignments you have, trust God's angels to remove and replace where necessary   [] when things aren't being done in a congregation as you think that they might be or should be done, or you might think well the, why don't the elders do something about this, we'll leave it, leave it to Jehovah and the angels, if there's anything wrong, they'll sort it out and they'll make the elves sort it out as well, they have ways and means, again coming back to this new text here   [reading] persistence in prayer shows you are awake the spirituals   [] so there's another way Jesus was outstanding in its constantly regarding prayers   [reading] keep awake by field ministry   [] and here's a rare one in any public talk   [reading] financial contributions   [] financial, we don't hear that very often in public talks, we, we always say that there's, er people come to the meetings, there's no collection, no mention of money, the seats are free, you're
*DON:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	free to come and go and er there is a contribution that's held at the back, but here in, in the talk it's highlighting their various ways, this is one of them that we can keep spiritually awake is by being aware of the need for financial contributions, Jehovah has done much for us through his organization and we can show love for him by full support with our time and finances and then another one look   [reading] stay awake by showing love to you and act loyal   [] sometimes it's easier to show love to some in the congregation than others, we naturally have an affinity for one another and certain types of personalities seemed to gel with others don't they?And it's easier to get along with brother so and so and sister so and so, but for goodness me I find, I find it ever so difficult to talk to sister so and so and there's an area perhaps that we can er think about, [reading] stay awake by being respectful and obedient   [] and that's something that is very important because it's completely opposite in the world today, respect for all authority and obedience to it is absolutely gone by the ways I find   [reading] refrain from criticism and careless talk    []  (.) so there are the main points, but as we say we can't go into them all, well, so what we're going to do is to try and just highlight one or two little areas which we could er enlarge on or put the magnifying glass on, so shall we do that?We mentioned about determining not to miss a single spiritual meal, Matthew chapter five and verse three well known to us all I think   (.) it's in those
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	as some people call them   (.) sermon on the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	chapter five of Matthew, [reading] happier those conscious of the spiritual needs since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them   [] and we're encouraged to do that aren't we?What does it mean to be conscious of our spiritual need?Well if you have the footnote bible like I've got here, you look down the bottom and speaks about those who are beggars, beggars for the spirit and just at the bottom of our road where we live er there's a little area there which quite busy and er there's a man who parades up and down there daily, he's there nonstop every day of the week, you can go by there any time, any day and he's there begging and he has no shame at all, and if you refuse him once he'll catch you another day and he'll ask you again, and you'll see him there backwards and forwards and he'll even   (.) when the traffic lights turn red  ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	and the cars stop, he'll even go over to one of the cars and if they've got their window open and just er say can you give me, have you got ten P for me?I, I need it to help me to get to Hanley or something like that and, and he does this all the time, and I look at him and I think well you know fancy being like that, surely we're in a welfare state, there's no need for that, I don't know what his circumstances are, he may be homeless, I don't know where he comes from and he just appears there and he carries on as if he loves the job, and that's only in this country, but if you go abroad, many of you have been abroad haven't you?And they go even further than that don't they?People do all sorts to their bodies don't they?To, to make people feel sorry for them and they have no shame at all in breaking limbs and distorting their features and all so that kind to make themselves look as pitiful as they possible can because they're going to live a life of a beggar and they tell us it's very profitable being a beggar in some lands, people can make in this country they reckon up to in places like London a hundred pounds a day being a beggar   ((laugh)) that's more than you earn a day isn't it?Most of you   (.) simply because they have no shame, now bringing it round to a spiritual thing, how can we show that we, where it describes there beggars for the spirit, it really means having no shame whatsoever in the truth, never hold back in demanding really, what your requirements are in the way of spiritual things and a good mirror to this is analyze yourself and ask yourself what am I like, am I really a beggar in spirit, what am I like when the magazines come?And maybe you have er a nice
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	announcement every time there's a delivery and the brother who's giving the announcements on a Tuesday or a Thursday, whenever they meet, he, he says that we have new magazines tonight brothers and he may hold them up and said you know, that they're this and that and lovely, beautiful magazines Jehovah doing so well now through his organization and he's presenting us with, with erm marvellous erm appealing literature, he holds them up and says we're, we're, we're able to get your magazines tonight and er we would like you to get them straight out at me, and they're still there two or three weeks later, your magazines, this is a way we can stay spiritually awake, is by going and getting them straight away, not for the benefit of the brothers, poor old brother who is on the job and he's wondering why, are they gonna come and fetch my magazines or not, but because we need to devour that spiritual feeling, we need to keep up to date with everything that Jehovah's providing us with.Really if we, if we're not on top of these things, then what we're saying is that Jehovah is like saying to a high squad who lays out a beautiful meal for us and saying well there you are, it's yours for the taking and you saying well I don't feel like that today   (.) I'll just have some chips down the road. (.) These are little signs and areas that show up as to whether or not we're really conscious of our spiritual need, alright you go and get them, you say alright I'll go and get them, as soon as they come on there, the first one there, but what do you do with them when you get them home?Do they go in a cupboard somewhere and stay there until the day comes when you're in the ministry and you think oh those new magazines I'd better get them, because we're going to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	that's no good at all, we need to read them and digest them and know what's in them, simply to show not only that we're conscious of our spiritual need, but to encourage others to become conscious of their spiritual needs, so can you see what we said earlier about our lives being involved in other people's too?Not just elders and brothers in the congregation is it?It's us and people out there, there is still people out there sighing and crying and groaning under the detestable things that are going on in this world, I've no doubt you've met many, but, when they say I don't know what the world's coming to, well if you know what's in your magazines and then your literature   (.) and the reasoning book, all these lovely provisions, because you've devoured it, you've eaten it like that scroll that John was given, it was sweet to him wasn't it?And it's sweet to others as well who want to receive it, but it's also bitter to those who don't, but what a wonderful provision that is from Jehovah, so are we conscious of our spiritual needs, no question we could just ask in passing, you notice the kingdom ministry is changed?Did you notice that?
*UNK:	Mm
*BAR:	Some of you are nodding, if you're thinking what is he talking about, what does he mean, then I'd advise you to go and have a look, because you might be dozing off spiritually if you're not aware of what's happening in kingdom ministry at this moment in time.We also mentioned   (.) don't quibble about assignments and arrangements, now in Romans chapter twelve, which this text is taken from, if you just go to the previous verses, this is from verse twelve isn't it?Erm   (.) Romans verse   (.) and verse four   (.) you notice this text is taken from verse twelve, rejoice in the hope and then persevering prayer, but if you go into verse four, what it's speaking about there, but just as we have in one body many, members, but the members do not all have the same function and then in six to eight he goes on to describe that we all have gifts don't we differing according to the undeserved kindness given to us, whether   (        ) er so forth and so faith, ministry, erm teaching, exhorting, all these different gifts, though sometimes if a particular brother or sister doesn't have a particular gift and we think well you know that's a bit hard going I can't seem to listen to them, that's an area perhaps where we could erm be quivering couldn't we, or complaining, especially about assignments, you might get speakers that come here from other congregations, and some are better than others aren't they?And you think when, when you get one that's not as good, you think well why do they   (.) why is it that that speaker can't give such a good talk, why is he giving a talk?Well should we quibble about that, not as individuals should we?The elders in the congregation will take careful note of what's happening in the circuit with regards to these figures and the standard of er talks and so forth and the standard of teaching, well it's not for us to quibble about it is it?And what about those assignments you see that erm, we get from the theocratic ministry school overseer, you've all had them haven't we?And we look at the slip and we think oh yeah,
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	and you go home and you look it up, I can't give this, I'd be highly embarrassed to give this, whatever has he given me this one for?And so you go back and you say to your brother I just cannot give this, it's impossible you see, well should we be like that?I'm sure very, very few brothers ever do that, sometimes if a mistake is made you might get an assignment like that, which is dealing with er maybe er marital problems or, or certain areas er with, within that sphere, where it's given to youngsters then, then that would be wrong wouldn't it?Er sometimes that has been known and it would be right to, for a youngster to sort of through their mother and father to take it back and say well look er can we have another one, but that would only be on a rare occasion, but if we're given an assignment in the congregation then, especially in a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	shouldn't we use, try every effort to try and carry it off, perhaps that's one that Jehovah's looked at and said well there's an area that they need to learn about, that need to understand a little more, they know nothing about that particular area, in the scriptures, now that's a good one for them to have, we'll make sure they get that, that way they're going to learn, so if ever we always get the easy ones, the ones we know, the ones we've done before, we think I can handle this, you never learn anything do we?So isn't it good for us rather than quibbling, rather than criticizing, and recognizing that we've all got different abilities and perhaps if you hadn't got one of those abilities there, the, the body that it speaks about, you see every part plays a part doesn't it on our physical body and so we are in accommodation, we all have a part to play, and that's the way we, we grow you see and we mature and we become better, able, equipped to go out and tell others, gives us confidence as well if we know what we're talking about, that way we can learn, so never quibble about assignments and arrangements, never criticize brothers and sisters in the congregation.If you've got something to say about anybody, make sure it's good, there's nothing wrong with gossip as long as it's healthy innit?Rather than degrading, why not upgrade brothers and sisters for a change.Perform well whatever assignments you have, have you noticed the Watchtower that were studying today, we've all got it with you I think, just turn to page twenty six   (.) turn to page twenty two, you'll see what it's about, it's about a brother Roy , who has always advocated   (.) sticking close to Jehovah's organization, guide to organization, give you a life story, and it's quite interesting reading, and again it's a test of your alertness, your vigilance, whether or not your spirits be awake or not, is this the first time you've seen that article? ((laugh)) If it is then you need to think carefully about what we're talking about today, and I hope everyone here has read it already cos that shows your spirit alone.Under the heading on page twenty six the

*BAR:	another one he had during his work and he says straight away look I was put to work splitting wood, do you see that in the, paragraph on the right hand side, the next day I was told to report to the dairy barns to help milk cows, then he worked in the garden, he also took care of the bees, harvested honey for the  family, then in nineteen fifty three I was transferred to the cheese making farm, now here's a spiritual brother thinking he's going into the battle to do all sorts of spiritual things, and yet these were his assignments, there's a lesson here for you and I.Down the bottom there in, number page twenty six it speaks about another modest man who became a role model for me who's name's John  now a member of the governing body of Jehovah Witnesses and he's been quoted over the years as saying it's not so much where you serve, but who you serve that is truly important, can you see that?And then you've got him on the right hand side look making cheese, this is brother  again, that's not brother .In nineteen eighty three from nineteen fifty three after thirty years of making cheese, they changed his job, I think many of you are ahead of me already, he said I was given a job change and I began working in landscaping, how nice   (.) while being interviewed some time ago I was asked what I thought about being giving a job change after thirty years of making cheese and he said well it didn't bother me, I noted, frankly because I didn't like making cheese anyway
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	so can you see the point of that brothers?If we're given an assignment, whatever it is, perform it well, don't think that I would make a better magazine servant than that brother over there and I don't like it on the accounts, why do they always use me as a hall servant?Why am I always given the responsibility of looking after the microphones, I've done this for years   (.) well think about this brother here, he made cheese for years and he didn't like the job one bit, now isn't that strange, do you know why?Because he had the right attitude, he didn't quibble, he didn't moan   (.) he didn't criticize, he just got on with the job, and isn't that a little area that we can all work on somewhere, it comes down to that little bit of territory even, doesn't it, if we're given in the ministry and we say oh not there again, I worked that last time, I know that person in that house they're all working, called on them and when they, I just don't get, I just don't get on with them, they're not me at all, you see, we, we can go on and on in   (.) all kinds of areas can't we in the truth, but what an attitude to have and I thought this was a lovely expression here, look, erm, on page twenty seven, just about a third of the way down on the right hand side, he says   [reading] as I have opportunity, I encourage new ones at that, that would take advantage of all privileged service, they're given, and to learn to be content, and happy with it   [] and just in the next paragraph at the end he says   [reading] be happy and content in your present circumstances and blossom in a spiritual way in the soil where you are planted   [] isn't that a lo a lovely expression, doesn't that show a man who is spiritually alive and alert and awake, and isn't that how we should be, wouldn't the congregation flow and move along forward, so much better and more unitedly if we all have that lovely attitude that Jehovah service, no matter what it is, we can't all be public speakers, we can't all be giving a public talk at the district assembly can we?It's only one that can do it at a time   (.) we all have a role to play, we're all part of that body aren't we that we've looked at in some, what a lovely description it is, and some of us don't look quite as good as the other part do we?And er some of us seemed to be more awkward than others, I mean some people's feet when you look at them and, and areas like that, that, you think well why did Jehovah make them like that, they're so ugly   ((laugh)) and yet without them where would we be?And isn't that how the congregation is?Some of us seemed to be awkward and the truth, new and the truth, inexperienced, others seemed to be so polished don't they?And they're, they could cope with any situation, but isn't that a little part we all have to play?That's how Jehovah wants things isn't it?And that's how his whole organization worldwide is moving ahead, that's why awake, Jehovah's organization is moving and Christendom's lagging behind, in fact they're, they're falling apart aren't they?Because they are spiritually deaf   (.) the brother   (.) Rutherford I think it was years ago described then as dumb dog, what does that
