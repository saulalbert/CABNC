*CHR:	it's nice it's just like, it's a sleeveless top, white, they had it in like lilac, jade and navy, erm and it's got, it's navy shorts with it
*JAN:	Mm
*CHR:	and like a big tie through the, the waist and the top is like white edge with navy and it's got like a sailor collar at the back
*JAN:	oh lovely
*CHR:	with like a navy stripe and erm an anchor on each side, it's quite nice cos she's got, I thought it would do for her holidays
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	but the top she could wear with like, she's got, well it's only cotton you see, shorts are only cotton 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	but she's got some really smart erm navy shorts
*JAN:	yeah
*CHR:	that I thought this top would look nice to wear 
*JAN:	very nice this 
*CHR:	at night, it's a smart set rath er rather than in the day
*JAN:	oh lovely
*CHR:	so I'm just looking for er a T-shirt or something for Lisa   (.) no you can't have the pen it's too sharp   (.) yeah, you're crafty you are aren't you, you can get zips open now   (.) mm  (.) 
*JAN:	So when you going in to sign the contracts?
*CHR:	Not heard anything yet 
*JAN:	Not heard anything yet
*CHR:	Velma called on Monday, erm, because I rang her up on Sunday to tell her what was happening, cos I mean she didn't know it, we signed our contract and erm I said to her well if we get a date this week, I said could, cos she's going back to Wales tomorrow, she won't be back till after Easter
*JAN:	No
*CHR:	so I said could Mike go in and do the fencing you see at the side, to keep the dog out
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	so,sh oh she said you, oh first of all she said you can go and get the key, so I said oh no I'm not bothered about the key I said if you could just leave the side gate open, so erm
*JAN:	Has it got a lock then?
*CHR:	yeah I think, I don't, she must lock it from the inside window back through 
*JAN:	Back out 
*CHR:	you see, so er anyway when we got off the phone Mike said yeah but what about bloody power you see
*JAN:	Oh
*CHR:	so, anyway, she must of thought about this, so she called on Monday, and she said oh I've been thinking Michael'll need electric for the drill
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	so she said what I'll do she said is I'll leave the key to the garage under two bricks at the side of the garage
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	she said and then he can use the power in there
*JAN:	mm, mm
*CHR:	so as long as we've got a date by Saturday he can go and do it, if we still haven't got a date he won't be able to go and do it
*JAN:	you can't do anything 
*CHR:	we've got the fencing well no, no you can't Jane because you're not insured you see until 
*JAN:	no 
*CHR:	you actually exchange, as soon as you've exchanged contracts we've got to get insured you see   (.) but erm   (.) I mean on the letter we got from the solicitor on Saturday it said, it, it looks as though your purchaser's ready to exchange contracts in the forthcoming week
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	so we've just wait and see.
*JAN:	she's doing everything by the book I think, so 
*CHR:	Oh I've never even seen anything of her Jane
*JAN:	no
*CHR:	I really thought I would see her round Sale, I've never seen anything of her 
*JAN:	no 
*CHR:	but, erm   (.) it might of taken longer than what she thought as regards her London ends you see 
*JAN:	start again 
*CHR:	really, that's what it is
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	well I think Dawn is quite happy now, I mean I think she felt as though she'd been rushed at first, but I mean
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	that was her choice really 
*JAN:	that's right 
*CHR:	I mean she said to me on Monday something about, I mean it's her that wanted to be in, in, by the middle of March, now I never said the woman wanted to be in by March 
*JAN:	no 
*CHR:	we were just discussing it
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	but, I, Miss  never actually said well I 
*JAN:	no 
*CHR:	want to be in by the end of March 
*JAN:	no 
*CHR:	I think she just assumed because she was coming down here with her job
*JAN:	she was ready to move in 
*CHR:	that she'll be ready to move in you see 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	but I said well at least you've got it all done, you don't have to rush around at the last minute.
*JAN:	that's right.How much money did she make in the end on er garage thing?
*CHR:	She didn't say and I, I never thought to ask her, no she didn't say   (.) so we're just, that's why really as I say I don't, I think at first she was quite happy for us to go in and maybe take stuff in, but I don't think she was happy about us doing structural things on it 
*JAN:	Mm 
*CHR:	cos I think her solicitor must of said something to her you see 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	but I mean even, even if we, if we get a date for next week Jane, we can't get in, cos I'm not going to get a key and go in when she's not there
*JAN:	no
*CHR:	if it'd happened a couple of weeks ago when she was about I would of kept going over like she said I could do 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	but we'll just leave it now 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	to the day
*JAN:	you might as well 
*CHR:	er, we'll get it all sorted, you know what you like, you sit there and you think oh I want it, to get it all sorted before I go and move, it'll just have to be in a tip for a while.
*JAN:	yeah, you can't though can ya?I mean you've got, it takes you so long to place things and 
*CHR:	No you don't this is it, we'll just dump everything, I said to Mark we'll just dump everything in the back room and we'll stay in the back room till we've sorted the front room 
*JAN:	mm 
*CHR:	out and then we'll move into the front room 
*JAN:	into the front room you've got Easter hopefully to go out and to sort out 
*CHR:	Well I hope so.
*JAN:	your, your front room though   (.) I think you just want to get everything
*CHR:	Well I think that's what it is Jane, but you can't 
*JAN:	tidy, but you know, you know in your own mind you can't 
*CHR:	you know in your own mind you can't
*JAN:	no
*CHR:	but
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	and Creg's on Monday   [laughing] with the carpets  [] , oh we shall have a right laugh with them two blokes, aye, they both go oh God not you again   [laughing] you know   [] and do I have a
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	have you thought of any that you like?
*CHR:	Oh we do like that one in the window
*JAN:	That's the
*CHR:	that's the one Mike's mad on, and when I went in on, er
*JAN:	that particular colour or a different colour?
*CHR:	yeah it looks lovely in the square, yeah because I thought it was quite light, but it isn't actually
*JAN:	It's the pinky one int it there 
*CHR:	it's erm, you shut up, no I went in, I've never been in Weeks, to go in and have a look and everything, it was Hamish that was in that time and you can have a right laugh with him, he's the one that came and sorted the hall and stairs 
*JAN:	Oh 
*CHR:	out for me and erm, when he went in on Monday, erm it was the other one the lad that actually owns it, so I was in there for about bloody half an hour and we came home with some samples and one that I quite liked it was up on the wall and he said that is my best selling Axminster that I had, and it was like, it was maybe it was a bit too busy, it was, it was greyey and it was all different other colours in it, but it was a lot of flowers on it, it wasn't a traditional Axminster you see Mike loves these traditional Axminsters and he doesn't really, he won't really entertain anything else, erm, anyway I brought that sample home   (.) and what else?Oh yeah that's the only one I brought home, on Tuesday it was, well as soon as he saw, I brought it in and me dad looked at it and he goes yeah it's alright, I knew he didn't like it and then when Mike got in, he said oh I don't like that, so I said why?Well you take it back I said and you pick the carpet
*JAN:	Mm where's this for then?
*CHR:	so, this is the front room
*JAN:	The front room
*CHR:	so er, he goes off and he comes back with three samples then, well one of them, it has been in the window as well, but it's a very definite diamondy shape
*JAN:	More
*CHR:	no quite big shaped diamond but it's in like pastel pink and pastel blue and it's very, very pastely colours  (.) 
*JAN:	Can't remember those 
*CHR:	but I would imagine down on a floor it would look very, the diamonds would be too much if you 
*JAN:	hit ya mm
*CHR:	know wha what I mean, he brought that one home and he brought another quite nice traditional one, but it tended to be quite browny, and then another one and, er
*JAN:	You're not ripping that up?
*CHR:	and then you know the one that was in the window?
*JAN:	Yeah
*CHR:	He didn't bring a sample home of that cos he, he brought the same design but in a different colour, but it was more greeny
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	so, anyway, I just, we've got it down on the floor and I says if we had a brown suite
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	that would be ideal
*JAN:	yeah
*CHR:	even though there was a bit of grey in it, it was the, really the brown that predominated it, I said it, it, the grey suite wouldn't go with it
*JAN:	so you're gonna have the front room with your grey suite in it?
*CHR:	yeah 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	then shall I
*JAN:	You thought, have you thought of any colours for your back room?No, this is, you're thinking this is for your front room now your carpet?
*CHR:	Yeah, er, well, so I brought the sample of that one home
*JAN:	Mm
*CHR:	the one that's in the window
*JAN:	right it's the pink squares 
*CHR:	and it's the and, yeah, me and Joanne weren't very keen on any of the carpets either and as soon as she saw that she said oh that's lovely
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	she said now I do like that, cos it looks nice and warm cos there's loads of colours in it, there's pink, there's burgundy, there's blue, green, every colour you can think of, you've bro 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	oh, you're determined to have that you are, aren't ya?If he got a
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	wouldn't do him any harm, but it wouldn't half make him go ah, cos it's dead minty
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	what are ya? (.) What are ya?Leave my handbag alone   (.) but you see when it was in the window Jane I thought it looked a bit too light, but I think what makes it look like that is they've got the light shining 
*JAN:	Yeah 
*CHR:	right on it
*JAN:	I've seen it down Chris and I love it
*CHR:	when you actually see it on the floor, it looks totally different
*JAN:	Glenys has got it, very, very sim very, very similar, there's very, there's not a lot in it, I'll take those magazines off
*CHR:	you see, oh Christ, erm  (.) 
*JAN:	but she got it in the greens
*CHR:	yeah, well I, Mike says I brought that one home when we were looking for a hall instead, but I said no I said it was one very similar, but he said we couldn't have it because erm 
*JAN:	no 
*CHR:	with them being the squares you'd lose a hell of a lot coming down the stairs 
*JAN:	mm 
*CHR:	you know on the turn and everything 
*JAN:	it would spoil it I mean
*CHR:	it would, you've got to have a big spread really haven't ya?
*JAN:	yeah, yeah I mean I'd thought about it for ours 
*CHR:	But 
*JAN:	but I remember what you said about the squares
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	I'd like it in here
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	I really would 
*CHR:	it would go lovely with this
*JAN:	I know
*CHR:	because even though 
*JAN:	it's got all the colours hasn't it?
*CHR:	even though this is erm not a plain, it's not dead busy is it?
*JAN:	No 
*CHR:	If you know what I mean.
*JAN:	but that, it's not, it doesn't, I don't see that carpet as being a particularly patterned car I know it has got a pattern 
*CHR:	It is it's a definite square, it's definite true, what your colours 
*JAN:	but to me I look at the, I call patterned carpets all the flowers and 
*CHR:	mm 
*JAN:	rounded patterns
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	d'ya know what I mean but 
*CHR:	yeah 
*JAN:	to me this is, a square doesn't look the same as the round 
*CHR:	no 
*JAN:	you know
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	I know it sounds stupid, but I like
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	I don't like the round
*CHR:	no 
*JAN:	flowery carpets
*CHR:	no
*JAN:	er or the ones that have got leaves going into
*CHR:	mm
*JAN:	you know that sort you have 
*CHR:	yeah 
*JAN:	to me that's patterned
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	but that carpet that you're talking about to me is a plain
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	but it's a plain square.
*CHR:	yeah, as I say Mike says, reckons I 
*JAN:	Liked it 
*CHR:	brought the green one home cos I brought the three samples home, the one that we've got down and another one   (.) and another one for the hall and stair, but I said I'm sure it wasn't the same as that, but it might have been, but I have to say he always said we would   (        ) 
*JAN:	Mike said   (        ) 
*CHR:	but you see the fortunate thing about it Jane, with that one, most of the carpets are only twelve foot wide
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	which would mean, cos the room's thirteen foot wide
*JAN:	oh is it?
*CHR:	we would of had to
*JAN:	Have another piece
*CHR:	buy an extra five square yards
*JAN:	yeah
*CHR:	cos it was only twelve foot wide, anyway, they do that one in fifteen foot wide
*JAN:	Oh do they?
*CHR:	so it, we've got to have twenty one something square yards, I think he worked it out at
*JAN:	Is it thirteen foot wide then the room?
*CHR:	Yeah into the alcove
*JAN:	Yeah
*CHR:	the back room isn't, the back 
*JAN:	no 
*CHR:	room's only about eleven and a half, because you get the back room, the front room and then it goes in a bit
*JAN:	right
*CHR:	to the back room
*JAN:	to the kitchen
*CHR:	to the kitchen you see
*JAN:	yeah.
*CHR:	where it's
*JAN:	So what's the length of the front room?
*CHR:	Er fourteen ten, by
*JAN:	It's bigger than what it looks really 
*CHR:	though it's bigger than what you think really
*JAN:	I think it's deceiving because it's got such high ceilings
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	the high ceilings sort of seems to take it off with 
*CHR:	yeah 
*JAN:	I know it sounds silly, but perhaps if the ceilings was lower it would look big
*CHR:	yeah, yeah
*JAN:	higher that
*CHR:	I think it's just maybe er how you have it as well 
*JAN:	mm 
*CHR:	I mean if you look at it now without the dining table 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	it looks totally different
*JAN:	yeah
*CHR:	I mean, Mike really likes that as a front room, he keeps saying that's gonna be our room, you know
*JAN:	mm I like a front room 
*CHR:	he's, he's funny he does like a front room, so I thought well sod it, I hate picking carpets Jane, so I thought sod it he can pick 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	the carpet and if it's not right he can
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	I don't think you can go wrong, far wrong with that one
*CHR:	No, it is nice
*JAN:	thinking of pink and grey in there
*CHR:	yeah, and he wants to, he came home this morning and he said, he must of been thinking about it, and he said well we could emulsion the walls, he said erm, why don't we do an apricot white, I says well that's peach, I said the 
*JAN:	Yeah 
*CHR:	the carpet's pink
*JAN:	yeah and, the suite
*CHR:	it wouldn't, it wouldn't look right, I mean we have got apricot white on the walls in the back room now, but I said, he, I think he feels as though, a definite pink is not the right colour for a room, do you know what I mean?
*JAN:	Mm
*CHR:	And yet it, I was quite happy with it to be honest 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	Jane because I think it looks quite warm
*JAN:	yeah, you can only put another colour into your curtains and bring it out with your carpet 
*CHR:	Yeah, well what I think he, I think he will emulsion over it cos I mean the ceiling's a bit, as you say she'd been a smoker
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	and the ceiling in that front room is a very deep, deep pink I think, if I can remember rightly, I think we'll go over, we'll probably will go over it and 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	erm we're not gonna go mad knocking picture frames down in that room, it's too much of a big job
*JAN:	Yes it is, innit?
*CHR:	I'm just gonna put a border round it
*JAN:	Mm
*CHR:	seen like a border in perhaps like a bit of pink and bit of grey on it and it's like sort of scalloped edging
*JAN:	Mm that'll look nice 
*CHR:	so put that over
*JAN:	yeah
*CHR:	at the top of the erm
*JAN:	in
*CHR:	of the picture frame
*JAN:	yeah
*CHR:	it sort of brings the ceiling down a little bit as well 
*JAN:	yeah 
*CHR:	cos to be honest, the more Mike goes over there, the more he keeps saying he doesn't really want to pull the picture frames down 
*JAN:	no well with them being such a tall ceilings, they're probably 
*CHR:	I don't know why, yeah and I think he feels as though you, he says well if you decorate it right you can blend it in with the wallpaper 
*JAN:	mm 
*CHR:	anyway you know, so 
*JAN:	of course you will.
*CHR:	I don't know I see I think we'll 
*JAN:	So what will you paint the picture rails white?
*CHR:	Same colour as the walls
*JAN:	Yeah
*CHR:	I think, so it just blends in with the border round
*JAN:	yeah, it'll look nice
*CHR:	and then it'll just, it'll just be titivated up really, so we can live in it and then the back room can just be done at our own time.
*JAN:	I, I'll definitely have those curtains for you this weekend, I'm gonna get them done.
*CHR:	Well as I say Jane
*JAN:	Well then you can put them straight up then can't you?
*CHR:	well no she's already got them up.
*JAN:	Mm, well what are they like?
*CHR:	Well they're not very nice, but I mean er I'll leave them up till I come to actually er get everything done
*JAN:	Mm, no I meant when you've dec once you've, you know painted in there and got your carpet down 
*CHR:	Yeah 
*JAN:	the grey curtains would go with your suite wouldn't they?
*CHR:	Oh they would match up with it yeah, yeah well I, okay then if you want   (        ) 
*JAN:	I've been mean I've been, I would of done it last weekend, but, I don't, I had a load of washing and it depends 
*CHR:	Yeah, it is 
*JAN:	getting it all done
*CHR:	you've gotta get up in the mood Jane, I did Saturday morning 
*JAN:	Mm 
*CHR:	it was fine, I thought right get up and get them bloody curtains washed, I had 'em on the line, but do you think our Mike noticed them, well when he came home from work, because I thought of having to put 'em back up again, I just 
*JAN:	Yeah 
*CHR:	got straight in from work 
*JAN:	oh 
*CHR:	and I had Mike ironing them while I was putting 'em up, I said right stand here and watch me hang this curtain, so I'm showing him how to iron it, so while I'm upstairs putting 'em up he's ironing 
*JAN:	He's ironing 
*CHR:	'em, so I had 'em put back up again for quarter to six,
*JAN:	That's alright that, I must have done six loads of washing, for some reason I just didn't seem to have enough to do me loads
*CHR:	Yeah
*JAN:	but then come Saturday morning
*CHR:	it's all accumulated
*JAN:	I had to, I was doing two what I call mid washes, this sort of colour
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	and then I was doing two these colours and I'd 
*CHR:	yeah 
*JAN:	got about three lots of er white it's unbelievable 
*CHR:	yeah, I've done that Jane you sort of look one day and you think there's hardly anything 
*JAN:	Stop it.
*CHR:	there, I'll leave it
*JAN:	Yeah 
*CHR:	and then you'll regret it the next day 
*JAN:	I know 
*CHR:	cos the bloody basket's full to the brim
*JAN:	I'm determining to keep it, I'm just putting bits in now
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	but a white load's there that I must put in and must get that put out this afternoon
*CHR:	mm
*JAN:	but er, oh dear   (.) I wanted to get them down and me others up while John's been in
*CHR:	mm
*JAN:	cos I didn't want to have no curtains up on me front
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	so I shall definitely get him to give us a lift 
*CHR:	yeah 
*JAN:	with them.
*CHR:	well as I say don't worry about it cos that first week I won't even bother anyway cos I'll leave up what I've got
*JAN:	Yeah
*CHR:	cos he said, you see I've, I think it's a picture, I think it's erm, what do you call it?A pelmet, I think 
*JAN:	right 
*CHR:	she's got wooden pelmets on everything
*JAN:	Has she?
*CHR:	so I'll want to take them down
*JAN:	Yeah
*CHR:	so they'll, that'll have to come down anyway
*JAN:	yeah  (.) 
*CHR:	You see I hate choos that's another thing I hate choosing Jane 
*JAN:	Those windows are so big that you've got though, I mean I do I, they, they probably will fit, I think it will be a tight fit though
*CHR:	They're twelve foot, I know that one in the front room is twelve foot wide, by seventy two drop
*JAN:	Yeah, well I don't know   (.) there more than seventy two aren't they?
*CHR:	Mm
*JAN:	But erm, they only really just go in my bay
*CHR:	yeah
*JAN:	there's no, there's not a lot of gathering there at all, what?You're not having the pen  (.) 
*CHR:	cos like Joanne's bedroom I'd measured that, that's sixty six drop   (.) so I ended up getting seventy two drop curtains
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	and Pam was gonna shorten them and then I said no I think I'll leave them
*JAN:	yeah
*CHR:	cos it was only like sort of eight inches difference and I thought well when I wash 'em they might shrink anyway
*JAN:	mm
*CHR:	and er, it'll, it'll
