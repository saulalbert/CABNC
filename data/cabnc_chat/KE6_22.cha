*BEV:	The first ones always can be the worst one!
*WEN:	Ay?
*BEV:	Well, the first one's always gonna be the worst one!

*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Well I think it's    (        )  (.) If you want it.
*BEV:	Oh, I'll be alright now.
*WEN:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	I shall be alright now cos of Val.
*WEN:	Yes, that's right.I mean, as I say, you might get there and you might hate it anyway.
*BEV:	Yeah, I might not even get it bu 
*WEN:	No.No, another he said was that bloke came in later.What was that man's name?
*BEV:	Clive    (.)  (        ) 
*WEN:	Clive?Clive?
*BEV:	I dunno, it was either Clive or Richard I think.
*WEN:	I mean unless they get a temp from an agency   (.) they gonna want somebody aren't they?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	Sounds to me as though they're just   (.) sell stuff, I I don't know!But it sounds to me as though it's taking something off the telephone, which is simple innit?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	And erm   (.) a bit of   (.) couple of letters typed.I mean, the re  (.) at the least you could go and have a look I suppose if
*BEV:	Is it somewhere  (        ) ?
*WEN:	He never said.He honestly never said. (.) It seemed to me it were the type of place you could sit and do your knitting.
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	If she's sat watching them    (        )  (.) she's pregnant but   (.) if she'd have sat watching Neighbours   (.) and she weren't able to     (.)  [laughing]  (        ) was she  [] ?And he did say to me   (.) well he has spoken to me about it, he did say answering   (.) the telephone.He said that.
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	As I say, I've only met her the once.And she come up in the car for him once. (.) But I mean the first step is always the hardest.I mean, if   (.) that don't only apply to you.
*BEV:	No.
*WEN:	But er   (.) if you want it an and it's   (.) then   (.) no harm in going and having a look!Is there?Like I say, the choice is yours hundred percent!You don't have to.
*BEV:	I want it but
*WEN:	Well the butt of it then has gotta be go over.
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	I mean if, if she wanted you to go out there today, just if   (.) then the sensible is to pick up a taxi.
*BEV:	Yeah.Well, then I know where it is.
*WEN:	Certainly!I mean I went, I'm i if it's the place where we said it is   (.) then, I mean it   (.) I know we went through Thicket  (        ) , yes I do!Cos I saw their horses and which I think are Moira's.But I mean   (.) you know what I'm like in a car I just sit there and then then   (.) your father turned in   (.) and there was all these, where we went to get the carpet, you know?And that is as much as I can   (.) sort of remember.But I really don't take much notice   (.) anyway, sat in a car.
*BEV:	No.
*WEN:	I don't. (.) Still as I say, no,th it's, it's a fair comment to say it's to be expected.But if you can overcome that   (.) you know, by saying ah what the hell!It's either this or nothing which, which it is   (.) and if you want it   (.) I mean Lesley's not bothered about it cos he's giving her seven hundred quid a blooming   (.) month!Well neither would you if yo , somebody give you seven hundred quid a month!Neither would I!For God's sake!I wouldn't get up at six, put the washing out and then go up there!
*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Thinking  (        ) .
*BEV:	But there again, one week you might, one month you might get a   (.) one month he might give her that and   (.) bugger all the next month!
*WEN:	Well she says it's guilt money and that is possible.
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	But, I think you're quite right in what you say.Quite right! (.) No doubt about that.You never know   (.) with what she said anyway.Unpredictable.But I mean, knowing her   (.) the   (.) the the sa , the money she's had   (.) she will   (.) erm   (.) certainly look after.
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	You know?I mean she's been living off what   (.) seventy three odd quid has she?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	So I mean there isn't anyway in the world that she's gonna bank   (.) seven hundred quid a month!No way at all!She'll er   (.) make the most of that because she won't   (.) possibly   (.) money for erm
*BEV:	Mhm. (        ) 
*WEN:	she'll want money for the deposit and   (.) and   (        ) whatever she gets. (.) Has there been much noise today?
*BEV:	No, but   (.) their dogs and that. (.) Got a lot done this morning then?
*WEN:	Well I did it on the way   (.)  (        ) .Why not?And stupid git there should of popped those   (        ) in there!Really stupid! (.) Could of done that easily couldn't I?
*BEV:	Yeah.
