*HEL:	Well it doesn't like vinyl paper for some reason.
*NON:	No, it'll dry out  (        ) .
*HEL:	Yeah   (.) It wasn't that   (.) it wasn't the lumps that bothered me it was the uhum, the fact that the edges just doesn't stay down.
*NON:	Yeah.
*HEL:	I think I might cut another piece of paper, the side won't stay flat.
