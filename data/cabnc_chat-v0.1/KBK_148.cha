@Comment:	conversation #148 (Tape 002618)
*CHR:	And erm, they've got some new system of a little plastic card, which they stick into the machine each time. •798885_806905•
*DAV:	so they give you a credit. •807035_808365•
*CHR:	It, well it notches up points for Argos. •808615_811185•
*DAV:	Well I bet you . •811385_812625•
        Argos . •813325_813625•
*CHR:	Oh are they? •815455_816005•
*DAV:	Yes. •816095_816315•
*CHR:	Oh I see. •816385_816875•
*DAV:	Yeah. •816875_817005•
*CHR:	Yes. •817265_817395•
*DAV:	When you've saved up a card, I don't know how many there are in it you got a pound worth of gifts at •817775_821315•
*CHR:	It  it's all rather ironic when you think that Argos grew out of Green Shield. •821865_825225•
*DAV:	Yes, yes, that's right. •825745_827925•
*CHR:	It's, it's the same system  eventually isn't it? •827925_829945•
*DAV:	It is yes. •829945_830715•
        With Green Shield Stamps it's amazing how quickly they went out just like that, didn't they? •831075_836525•
*CHR:	Yes, I believe what did it was Tesco's  them out. •836525_842225•
*DAV:	Ah. •842775_843245•
*CHR:	Tesco were the grocery chain and the Green Shield Stamps and it was the kiss of death for Green Shield when they did that. •843555_851155•
*DAV:	Did they pull out? •851155_851895•
*CHR:	They staggered on for a year or two after that, but Tesco's had a big, big change of policy they were no longer high and kick them out cheap, they decided to promote a quality in which stamps did not go for  and erm •852105_862565•
*DAV:	You can get Green Shield Stamps again in some garages can't you? •864065_867925•
*CHR:	I don't know. •867925_868215•
*DAV:	I'm sure, I thought the one down the bottom did Green Shield, or is that something else they do? •868215_871865•
*CHR:	I, I don't, that's ahead of us you mean? •873215_875035•
*DAV:	No, just here. •875035_875535•
        There it is. •875535_875875•
*CHR:	Yeah, oh really,. •875875_876185•
*DAV:	You'll have that recorded on your er •888995_892625•
*CHR:	Yes, yes. •892625_893135•
*DAV:	Any noise. •893135_893325•
*CHR:	I, I pity the poor typist has to transcribe this as and when if it happens, ha, ha she's going to get some very strange noises, including me having a pee and flushing the loo before lunch, what have you, I forgot to switch it off. •893495_904025•
*DAV:	So you obviously can't edit it can you, or you shouldn't it'll be pointless  •905655_909035•
*CHR:	Well I , I can, I mean if, if somebody erm, objects to the fact that being recorded and let's say erm private business meeting or something in that sense  •909035_917835•
*DAV:	Oh, that, that switches off completely? •917835_919155•
*CHR:	That's right. •919155_919745•
*DAV:	Yes. •919765_919975•
*CHR:	That's right. •919975_920445•
*DAV:	Presumably. •920525_920735•
*CHR:	But if somebody, and they say to you, try, try not to tell people in advance because it inhibits them, I, I'm not at all certain about that, but still, erm •920735_929465•
*DAV:	Some people might object to it. •929465_931525•
*CHR:	But if people object when you tell them afterwards, you're at liberty to erase and, so  •931525_936315•
*DAV:	Yes  •936565_936625•
*CHR:	on and so forth, so, •936625_937805•
*DAV:	you tend to tell them first? •937805_940255•
*CHR:	Well, not necessarily, sometimes I don't tell them at all or they comment on it and I explain, it's a, but it's only been yesterday and today you see really. •940255_947445•
*DAV:	Yeah. •947445_947625•
*CHR:	They, they asked that it be done on a Friday and a Saturday and that they appeared on Thursday with it, erm, I'm getting on with it. •947625_955115•
        It was quite entertaining yesterday, today's becoming a bit of a bore because the tapes only last forty five minutes, so you've got to  •955575_967325•
*DAV:	Course, yes . •967325_967555•
*CHR:	change, change over and change the tapes and all that sort of thing and erm they give you packets of batteries and your supposed to change the batteries every two to three tapes, every four sides in other words. •967885_979765•
        So you're fiddling around with it and that. •979785_982685•
*DAV:	Yes, yes. •982945_983595•
*CHR:	It's a proper Sony Walkman. •986095_987085•
*DAV:	Yes. •987085_987515•
*CHR:	It's certainly good quality recording. •988085_989345•
*DAV:	Mm. •989355_989835•
        I've just got it hooked on the mouth here you see. •990395_992935•
*CHR:	Oh it is, yes . •993175_994855•
        Make the exercise worthwhile. •995195_996655•
*DAV:	Mm. •996655_997075•
        Cos language does change doesn't it? •997075_100043•
        I mean •100057_100068•
*CHR:	Very much so, yes. •100068_100136•
*DAV:	words certainly do go out, you forget, when you go to use a word that hasn't been in use sometime and the younger person says to you what does that mean? •100136_100915•
*CHR:	Yes indeed. •100958_101038•
*DAV:	Words , with the old coinage have completely well not completely gone, but they don't have the same meaning do they ? •101038_101726•
*CHR:	I can remember several years ago bringing in a seventeen year old baby sitter to sit with Susannah, and I heard thirty bob. •101733_102468•
*DAV:	Yes. •102472_102495•
*CHR:	And she said, well what's is it? •102519_102806•
        She had not a clue. •102855_103016•
*DAV:	No. •103026_103072•
*CHR:	Not a clue. •103087_103168•
*DAV:	Well I suppose  like that it's not worth tuppence really. •103168_103459•
*CHR:	Yes. •103484_103504•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	But they will say two pence these days won't they? •103526_104024•
        Not tuppence. •104024_104064•
*DAV:	Yeah, not tuppence . •104064_104143•
        No. •104173_104191•
*CHR:	And, and look at you as if you're an old fogey if you say tuppence I expect. •104260_104579•
        And do you remember as a child, people used to talk of four and twenty and five and twenty past? •104579_105203•
*DAV:	Yes. •105203_105257•
*CHR:	That's totally disappeared hasn't it? •105277_105463•
*DAV:	Yes, I, I mean, they talk about twenty past the hour, twenty to four. •105463_105812•
*CHR:	Yes, but instead of twenty five past, they've said five and twenty past  •105812_106206•
*DAV:	They did  •106206_106235•
*CHR:	quite often. •106235_106265•
*DAV:	yes. •106265_106319•
*CHR:	And eh, curious twist that. •106390_106773•
*DAV:	Yes, I, I think really that's why it's a lot easier to read the time on an analogue display than it is on a digital display. •106773_107437•
        You virtually have to read that and register it. •107437_107621•
*CHR:	That's right and the point really is with time, you're not interested that it's two twenty four. •107621_108055•
*DAV:	No. •108055_108090•
*CHR:	You, are, are, am I early , •108090_108297•
*DAV:	but  •108297_108319•
*CHR:	am I on time, am I late , •108319_108444•
*DAV:	yes  •108444_108470•
*CHR:	have I to, how long is it till I'm due, whatever. •108470_108712•
*DAV:	, you glance at your watch and discover that it's not half past isn't it? •108712_108970•
*CHR:	That, that's right, you've still got time or you'd better get a move on, it's that sort of reaction that your brain makes isn't it? •108970_109519•
*DAV:	You're not really worried about the time to the last minute, I mean •109519_109878•
*CHR:	No. •109878_109890•
*DAV:	twenty five past is nearer. •109913_110023•
*CHR:	That's right, that's right, I, I tend to keep my watch to the minute if I possibly can, but that's bad habit or really habit from the days when I was catching trains every day, and I'd never caught a train with any time to spare, erm •110023_111477•
*DAV:	Well with  watch they don't . •111609_111821•
        They don't very much anyway do they? •111822_112124•
        Or yours do? •112124_112212•
*CHR:	Mine's a good old fashioned proper mechanical wind up job yes. •112213_112815•
*DAV:	Wind up, yes . •112843_112909•
*CHR:	My father gave it to me for my seventeenth birthday. •112909_113066•
*DAV:	Oh really and you still wear it daily? •113073_113271•
*CHR:	I do indeed, yes, yes, it's the only watch I own, and it's the only watch I've ever had, no, no, that's true, er not true I should say I've got a half hunter. •113271_114101•
*DAV:	Yes. •114103_114136•
*CHR:	Which eh, if I put this in for cleaning, or . •114176_114381•
*DAV:	That's unusual isn't it, because I always think, I mean I, this is really only about the second watch I've ever had  good one. •114396_115421•
        First good watch I had was for my twenty first, I've still got, it still goes  •115421_115959•
*CHR:	Yes  •115965_115988•
*DAV:	quite well. •116026_116083•
*CHR:	yes. •116153_116165•
        Well my father was a commercial traveller in jewellery, silver ware •116383_116718•
*DAV:	Oh was he? •116718_116774•
*CHR:	watches , and this is actually one of his samples. •116774_116998•
*DAV:	Yeah. •116998_117031•
*CHR:	And this is a Sotino which is a quality brand in those days, I, I, don't know if it still is, I assume it is, erm, which was not advertised at all, and although the Rolex's and so on in this world have been heavily advertised as they came on the market, Sotino's never really was, so my father had a  struggle I suspect selling. •117076_119569•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yeah. •119569_119605•
*DAV:	Where do you take it when it needs erm, there aren't that many places are there? •119685_120261•
*CHR:	No there aren't , I had it done last year at erm, oh what's it called,, Sidcup. •120261_120626•
*DAV:	Oh I know. •120959_121182•
*CHR:	Do you know the ? •121182_121417•
*DAV:	Yes, little tiny place  •121449_121562•
*CHR:	Beyond the station  •121562_121595•
*DAV:	yes  •121595_121611•
*CHR:	yes tiny little place, and it was, it wasn't totally satisfactory initially in that they erm, they left it with some sort of erm cock up, I couldn't wind it up, there was something wrong with the crown click, or something of the sort, when I got it back, so I had to take it back again, but otherwise they seemed to be people who are well aware of watches in the best sense and eh, he said this is a  an excellent movement and eh far better than the ones I normally see. •121611_125054•
*DAV:	Mm. •125054_125086•
*CHR:	Erm, but, I mean it doesn't look very special does it? •125138_125507•
        But absolutely everything of course other than the movement changed since I was seventeen. •125507_125861•
*DAV:	Yes. •125861_125903•
*CHR:	New case, new dial, new hands, new everything. •125933_126132•
*DAV:	Really? •126148_126212•
*CHR:	And, and I suspect that'll be jolly difficult to get that sort of thing done these days. •126224_126572•
*DAV:	I think a new face would be very expensive . •126585_126875•
*CHR:	Mm, mm. •126909_127001•
        Oh yes, but I, I think as I recall I got it without too, without too much trouble. •127001_127579•
        But I mean, going back to the fact it's my one and only watch, I should think Susannah has had eight or ten watches . •127579_128505•
*DAV:	I, I think people must do because the number of them that are sold . •128530_128817•
*CHR:	She, she, looks upon them as a thoroughly disposable commodity. •128817_129107•
*DAV:	Yes, yeah. •129107_129177•
*CHR:	Five or ten pounds is the price that has to be paid for them and they last six months and they move on to the next, extraordinary approach. •129279_130080•
*DAV:	They use Swatch watches don't you. •130097_130417•
*CHR:	Yes, yes, she's, she's had, she's had one of those and I haven't seen that for a long time. •130422_130879•
        She's got some stupid thing at the moment with, with a flip top of Thomas the Tank Engine. •130879_131292•
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	When Stephanie's mother died we found in the bungalow a watch, it must of been given I would of thought to her father probably for his twenty first and I took it to a jewellers in Elton, well that's all he does is watches actually apart from jewellery . •131366_132938•
*CHR:	Yes , yes. •132954_132995•
*DAV:	And eh, he seemed very knowledgeable, I mean we got a job to find him, he hasn't actually got a shop, he's just got a premises. •133005_133693•
*CHR:	Oh yeah. •133705_133795•
*DAV:	It's the place, that if you take your watch into the average shop they take it to him I think. •133795_134350•
*CHR:	I see, yes, yes, oh next time I need one I shall ask you then. •134350_134743•
*DAV:	Yes, he was very knowledgeable, very helpful. •134743_135016•
*CHR:	Mm, Mm. •135016_135080•
*DAV:	Eh  •135080_135092•
*CHR:	Yes in somewhere like that it's not a place you leave your  •135120_136290•
*DAV:	Oh  •136290_136302•
*CHR:	watch in confidence is it? •136306_136407•
*DAV:	gosh, no, I mean all they do now these days is sell them, they don't repair them. •136407_136728•
*CHR:	That's right, that's right, yes  •136728_136859•
*DAV:	that's a slight, mistake to call them jewellers, cos they're not really, that at all are they? •136867_138475•
*CHR:	Yes, yes, I know  even, even Ratner himself called them tat or •138475_138811•
*DAV:	Yeah. •138811_138844•
*CHR:	crap or something didn't he? •138893_139000•
*DAV:	He did that to get publicity, cos in fact they found that it wasn't eh, rubbish he was selling in there. •139000_139554•
*CHR:	Well it, it, at least it's gold, I mean, I, I, I was in the jewellery trade when I first left school, between school and national service I worked at a manufacturing jewellers in Birmingham and I've never really gone along with the idea that nine carat is actually gold. •139559_141021•
        If something is only three eights •141043_141227•
*DAV:	Yes. •141227_141285•
*CHR:	gold, how can you call it gold? •141342_141589•
*DAV:	Yes. •141589_141633•
*CHR:	The essence of  is copper alloy, it's got more than fifty percent copper in it. •141633_142026•
*DAV:	Yes. •142026_142032•
*CHR:	That's the way I always thought, and if it's only got thirty seven and a half percent of gold in it, how on earth can you call it gold? •142032_142668•
*DAV:	So nine carat is only •142668_142817•
*CHR:	It's nine twenty fourths. •142817_142958•
        Pure gold is twenty four carat. •142958_143148•
*DAV:	Ah, yes of course it is. •143148_143254•
*CHR:	So you get nine carat which is thirty seven and a half, eighteen carat which is seventy five percent and twenty two which is, ha, ha, ha, whatever it is. •143254_144081•
*DAV:	Yeah. •144081_144100•
*CHR:	A little over ninety per cent I suppose, and erm, I'm not sure if you got fourteen or fifteen carat, so fourteen I think is used with the continental standard and the lowest continental standard now are fifteen used to be our inbetween standard, very rarely used. •144185_145664•
*DAV:	But nine and eighteen are the most common in this country? •145664_146091•
*CHR:	Yes, they are, yes, definitely. •146091_146191•
*DAV:	The trouble is the more you get, the more, is the softer is the jewellery. •146238_146601•
*CHR:	That's, that's true, eh, I mean the alloy in the other ones have to be quite crafty when you get up to twenty two carat for example and eh, very eh, eh, large chunk of gold in it, and it can indeed be very soft, but then you see that's an eighteen carat ring that I've had for, worn, all the time for twenty four years •146601_148696•
*DAV:	Yes. •148696_148750•
*CHR:	and it really was pretty much like that when I had it, so eh, it's probably a bit more rounded than it was. •148843_149279•
*DAV:	Yes, yes. •149279_149373•
*CHR:	So they, they do last. •149407_149517•
*DAV:	Yeah. •149517_149572•
        Oh, yes, because rings come in to quite a bit of wear don't they? •149844_150091•
*CHR:	Yes, oh yes, yes, yes, no with doubt. •150103_150438•
        I had one repaired for Susannah, it had been left to her by an aunt and she had managed to smash it against a  post or something and broke the shank and knocked out one of the erm, stones, so on and so forth, and eh, together with some repairs on a charm bracelet I had to pay thirty seven pounds for the whole jolly lot. •150438_152961•
*DAV:	Did you really, yes, yes. •152961_153073•
        But it's, I think when you look at the cost of labour  these days, it's not surprising any sort of repairs are expensive. •153089_153889•
*CHR:	It's very true. •153889_153996•
*DAV:	They've got to pay for the premises  •153996_154132•
*CHR:	Yes  •154132_154162•
*DAV:	and eh •154162_154190•
*CHR:	yes, absolutely. •154215_154277•
*DAV:	It's a fairly, well it is a skilled trade isn't it? •154308_154639•
*CHR:	And I took it to the people up on Royal Parade, who are constantly having burglaries, no, that's that's true, they have had several quite chunky burglaries •154639_155438•
*DAV:	Mm. •155447_155511•
*CHR:	and erm, eh, they have  must be absolutely horrific, you have to pay for all that sort of thing don't you? •155511_156471•
*DAV:	Yes of course you do, yes. •156471_156629•
*CHR:	It doesn't work on Saturdays eh? •156656_157044•
*DAV:	It doesn't work at all at the moment. •157044_157192•
*CHR:	Oh really. •157192_157282•
*DAV:	I don't think. •157282_157390•
*CHR:	I see, yes, it's not the most stimulating job in the world is it? •157402_157941•
*DAV:	No. •157941_157956•
        Stretch your money in small amounts like that. •158006_158388•
        prepared to do it, there's quite a few cars . •158388_158688•
