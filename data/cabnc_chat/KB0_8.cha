*NOE:	 (        )  (.) Now   (.) so much more time has been released for us   (.) to be the church   (.) but at the same time we have nowhere to hide   (.) and nothing to blame! (.) It has meant, that churches   (        ) need to be bold   (.) and be young   (.) or a threat to what we belong to   (.) as the edges between church and   (.) and community have blurred   (.) we are now much more vulnerable. (.) Somebody said, like a tortoise without a shell. (.) And we need a greater trust in God. (.) It has also meant a greater love for one another as we can share our faith   (.) and come face to face with who we are.
*UNK:	I'm glad that Pat used the word   (.) exciting   (.) but all the story you've heard this morning are exciting! (.) But, it does Pat, doesn't it   (.) also danger! (.) It also means fear, it also means pain. (.) I don't know no any more what church is   (.) I don't know any more and I'm supposed to come this morning and help to discover what unity is! (.) It blurred so much   (.) and in the blurring   (.) we have discovered our own vulnerabilities. (.) And having raised our banners of church   (        ) proudly   (.) a change is all     (.)  (        )  (.) what changes should have been! (.) I see now narrow mindedness   (.) I see the deathedness  (.) I see suspicion of other communities   (.) I see jealousies. (.) However, I am discovering that the church   (.) probably not the community   (.) but more a communion   (.) and that's perhaps an answer to what Nanette   (        ) ? (.) Or within the communion of our Lord Jesus Christ   (.) in word and sacrament   (.) and that living out of his love is his body   (.) and finding community. (.) Communion   (.) actually the Holy Communion   (.) has become so much more important to us   (.) and so much more exciting to us   (.) because we're not just celebrating the living Christ   (.) we're also celebrating the crucified Christ   (.) and we're simply meeting our pain and our joys   (.) together   (.) in communion with him. (.) I once watched a film on the telly   (.) it was a pretty crap film really! (.) It was American   (.) no, sorry it's not!
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	See   (.) yes   (.) the thing about community  (        ) . (.) It was a simple story, and I would of forgotten it   (.) er, about a woman struggling to bring up a family in a depression. (.) The story was that her husband in the deep south   (.) was killed by some young hoodlums who were black. (.) She was left to bring up a family   (.) she had to go the banks for money   (.) the banks were all    (        )  (.) and they refused her money   (.) to keep the farm going. (.) She took on a black lad   (.) and because she did that she was ostracised from the rest of the community. (.) He eventually was driven off the farm   (.) but the respectable white people who went to church. (.) The story, of course, was a happy ending, that she struggled on and she did it. (.) But for some strange reason, and I don't know whether they direct it to Christian   (.) the last shot of the film, almost unnoticeable because the credits were going up   (.) she went back into church   (.) and it was a communion service   (.) and all you saw was her receiving the bread and passing the plate   (.) and the plate was to the young black lad on the farm   (.) and you thought, he's come back! (.) But then, no   (.) he passed the plate then   (.) to the woman's husband   (.) who had been killed! (.) And then the plate was passed from him to his murderer   (.) and it was passed round until it was passed to the bank manager who wouldn't give her the money   (.) and then back to her. (.) And somehow, but I can't explain it   (.) in that moment   (        ) that what community's about   (.) it's about the not yet   (.) as well your  (        ) . (.) About the journey   (        ) being on   (.) and the reconciliation o , of them  (        ) . (.) And that's where we are    (        )  (.) and   (        ) this morning. (.) Thank you.
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*GET:	We thank you to everybody who's contributed to   (.) to our speaking this morning   (.)  (        ) . (.) There's a lot for you to talk about over lunch. (.) And on the journeys home. (        ) . (.) Just a reminder that erm, expenses and apologies should be given to Suzanne or Eileen. (.) Erm   (.) if any   (        ) have been   (        ) those elders or ministers   (.) will advise us the days they are going to come, those ministers who are    (        )  (.) and seen, if we do so that we can remember whom our chosen  (        ) . (.) Downstairs there is a bookstall and there's a  (        ) , today upstairs  (        ) . (.) Bon appetit!
