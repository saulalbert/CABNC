James (PS1C7)              [212] I mean ... yesterday after I had me dinner I
                           dropped off to sleep for a couple of hours cos
Patricia (PS1C8)           [213] that could cause feeling [...]
James (PS1C7)              [214] [...] and you're awake now
Patricia (PS1C8)           [215] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [216] Last night ... I was sitting er what was I
                           watching?
                           [217] ... Forget what was on now

                           that's when I fell asleep
Patricia (PS1C8)           [221] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [222] I fell asleep just after eight o'clock and I
                           was er, well after ten when I woke up
Patricia (PS1C8)           [223] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [224] and I was saying to myself, why should I be
                           dropping off to sleep like this, it's gotta be fumes
                           you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [225] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [226] like Jimmy next door, he's always dropping off
                           and he got a vent put in at the bottom of his door,
                           they took the pipe [...] out and behind ... you had
                           a big open
Patricia (PS1C8)           [227] yeah
James (PS1C7)              [228] which should of been bricked right the way in
Patricia (PS1C8)           [229] that one's got a brick opening like that, that
                           isn't bricked in
James (PS1C7)              [230] No, well that's supposed to be bricked right
                           in, so it doesn't allow the fumes to accumulate
                           inside
Patricia (PS1C8)           [231] it's it's a good size [...] as well
James (PS1C7)              [232] Yeah
Patricia (PS1C8)           [233] that size
James (PS1C7)              [234] and that's what they've done, all then that
                           [...] done ripped it
Patricia (PS1C8)           [235] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [236] they clamped a big label on, well they didn't
                           clamp one on ours so I take it was
Patricia (PS1C8)           [237] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [238] supposed to be alright
Patricia (PS1C8)           [239] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [240] but over the years you sit there and ya ...
                           you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [241] well it must be the fumes
James (PS1C7)              [242] yeah
Patricia (PS1C8)           [243] and what this thing up ... what's that up
                           there?
James (PS1C7)              [244] in the summer it doesn't happen.
                           [245] Well that's supposed to be a vent
Patricia (PS1C8)           [246] Er, that's the vent is it?
James (PS1C7)              [247] it carried the fumes away
Patricia (PS1C8)           [248] Oh I see
James (PS1C7)              [249] any surplus fumes around
Patricia (PS1C8)           [250] aha, have, have you got one like that?
James (PS1C7)              [251] Oh aye but when the bloke went next door to
                           Jimmy's, he, he said where's your vent and Jimmy
                           says there it is up there, ah, and he got up there
Patricia (PS1C8)           [252] I thought
James (PS1C7)              [253] he says I see you've got a towel up there
Patricia (PS1C8)           [254] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [255] regarding a fire it's no good whatsoever, he
                           says your trouble you're not getting a draught from
                           your
Patricia (PS1C8)           [256] yeah, aha
James (PS1C7)              [257] from your front door coming through and
                           carrying the fumes away
Patricia (PS1C8)           [258] cos it'd have to be circulating around
                           wouldn't it?
James (PS1C7)              [259] this part of the fire, he says, Jimmy says
                           well I'll put a label on it then, well [...] why
                           don't ya?

Patricia (PS1C8)           [261] well that's commonsense
James (PS1C7)              [262] he said well that's the trouble you could
                           break the
Patricia (PS1C8)           [263] I would say that's dangerous
James (PS1C7)              [264] then he says you want a vent in the bottom of
                           your door

                           says ... I'll have to take the door off, so he says
                           can you give a hand to hold it, cos he had to cut er

                           of the door you know with
Patricia (PS1C8)           [282] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [283] six inch [...]
Patricia (PS1C8)           [284] put one of them metal things in
James (PS1C7)              [285] and you put a grid on each side like a plastic
                           grid, you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [286] oh yeah, mm, mm I know
James (PS1C7)              [287] and there was only these er little screws,
                           more like a nail with a, a little spiral on
Patricia (PS1C8)           [288] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [289] and what you doing, you didn't screw them in
                           you just break them in
Patricia (PS1C8)           [290] oh yeah
James (PS1C7)              [291] and the spiral grips the wood you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [292] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [293] so he says I tell he says, er, he put the card
                           up where the machine is, which he bore a hole in,
                           I've got one of them mach er cutters, you know, a, a
                           saw with a little braid on
Patricia (PS1C8)           [294] oh yeah
James (PS1C7)              [295] and you can cut all different shapes you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [296] mm, mm mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [297] and he, when you drill a hole in the corner
                           ... each corner and he just put it on he just oh it
                           were real lovely and it was as simple as that
Patricia (PS1C8)           [298] ah yes yes, yeah, aha

                           didn't
Patricia (PS1C8)           [300] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [301] when he put the grid in that, that caused
                           [...]
Patricia (PS1C8)           [302] I see
James (PS1C7)              [303] you know, took an hour down and he just got
                           that done, but I, I've meant to ask him if those
                           have made any difference, you know, having done in
Patricia (PS1C8)           [304] yes
James (PS1C7)              [305] the, griding that brick in
Patricia (PS1C8)           [306] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [307] but er, that is the trouble, half of these are
                           not been put in properly and the fumes are coming
                           back over
Patricia (PS1C8)           [308] well it, it could cause the [...] many a [...]

                           [322] So, this tiler were there with that you know,
                           I says well why, you know ... and er ... I went back
                           in and I turned the fire off altogether
Patricia (PS1C8)           [323] Well it's sensible cos it's certainly [...]
James (PS1C7)              [324] cos it wasn't, it wasn't that cold you know in
                           the room, so I says well I, I wanna create more
                           fumes, which one am I locking up?
Patricia (PS1C8)           [325] it seems fairly warm [...] I still think it's
                           nice and warm
James (PS1C7)              [326] Well you don't get much draught cos the fr
                           well the front door see that's the [...] door here
Patricia (PS1C8)           [327] yeah, mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [328] you come in our front door there, that was a
                           passage, when you get a draught from the front door,
                           it passes this door and it goes straight to the
                           back, down the stairs and back
Patricia (PS1C8)           [329] it's what you call straight through to the
                           very end of the [...] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [330] you see
Patricia (PS1C8)           [331] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [332] door, one door to another door
Patricia (PS1C8)           [333] that's right
James (PS1C7)              [334] you get a straight through draught, from the
                           front door through the passage, then it doesn't
                           [...] into here
Patricia (PS1C8)           [335] not do
James (PS1C7)              [336] and then it goes through to the back, now his,
                           although it looks
Patricia (PS1C8)           [337] similar
James (PS1C7)              [338] the same as our house ... when you open the
                           door here
Patricia (PS1C8)           [339] mm
James (PS1C7)              [340] his front door, the same, you've got er the
                           stairs going up there
Patricia (PS1C8)           [341] mm
James (PS1C7)              [342] but, when you go into the passage ... his
                           door, he's got the door into the front room, same as
                           ours, on the left, but when you get into the bottom
                           of the passage, there's a brick wall in front of ya,
                           and it comes round and his door to the back dining
                           room is on this side here
Patricia (PS1C8)           [343] oh yeah, mm
James (PS1C7)              [344] so he doesn't get a straight through draught
                           like me
Patricia (PS1C8)           [345] no you not do
James (PS1C7)              [346] by having that wall at the bottom
Patricia (PS1C8)           [347] that's right of course
James (PS1C7)              [348] the draught always follows where there a, you
                           know, two doors
Patricia (PS1C8)           [349] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [350] two windows open
Patricia (PS1C8)           [351] that's true ...
James (PS1C7)              [352] but when ya, when you stand at the front door
                           and er there's a blower breeze [...] and it's cold,
                           if you put your hand round the door like that, you
                           can feel a draught, you can feel it colder than the
                           [...] you know and the letter box, the draught ...
                           but if you take that and put a curtain up, it'll
                           keep the cold out, you've stopped the draught so
                           you're gonna win
Patricia (PS1C8)           [353] The draught from that's, yeah so you're not
                           sure whether you're doing the right thing or not
James (PS1C7)              [354] Yeah so you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [355] so it's true mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [356] I said I dunno what to do for the best so, I
                           just leave things the way they are and er hopefully
                           that er you get some warm days where you needn't
                           have the fire on, so you don't have fumes you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [357] true mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [358] if
Patricia (PS1C8)           [359] well you're better again Jim, you've got the
                           fire er so you put the fire, you put the fire off,
                           well this central heating comes from the back of
                           that fire doesn't it, so if you've got the central
                           heating on and you've got it on full
James (PS1C7)              [360] Aye
Patricia (PS1C8)           [361] blast for the water, won't you get the fumes
                           just the same as what you do from the fire?
James (PS1C7)              [362] No, because because the fire at the back is
                           ... actually at the bottom of the chimney
Patricia (PS1C8)           [363] Ah I see yeah, yeah
James (PS1C7)              [364] if this here is in the room innit?
Patricia (PS1C8)           [365] mm, that's right
James (PS1C7)              [366] So you'll have fumes
Patricia (PS1C8)           [367] of course it is that's right and so, where the
                           fumes from the central heating
James (PS1C7)              [368] coming back through the side here
Patricia (PS1C8)           [369] go?
                           [370] By the side here
James (PS1C7)              [371] They got your central heating for your water
Patricia (PS1C8)           [372] Yeah
James (PS1C7)              [373] in, behind the wall there
Patricia (PS1C8)           [374] yes of course that's right and that's in the
                           front
James (PS1C7)              [375] you know the fuse
Patricia (PS1C8)           [376] it's come [...]
James (PS1C7)              [377] oh your fuse is all at the back the
Patricia (PS1C8)           [378] yeah
James (PS1C7)              [379] pull it up the chimney
Patricia (PS1C8)           [380] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [381] now that's the difference
Patricia (PS1C8)           [382] yeah
James (PS1C7)              [383] I mean
Patricia (PS1C8)           [384] that's right
James (PS1C7)              [385] you can
Patricia (PS1C8)           [386] it's er coming into the room isn't it?
James (PS1C7)              [387] you can tell er what a draught is like in that
                           room, I shall tell you when [...] comes
Patricia (PS1C8)           [388] Mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [389] and they'll be here half an hour or three
                           quarters of an hour, he smoked four cigarettes, now
                           it takes all day and all night to get rid of them
                           fumes of his cigarettes
Patricia (PS1C8)           [390] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [391] they travel up the stairs ... your, you knew
                           this room and when, with being in it all the time
                           you, you know you, your nose gets [...]
Patricia (PS1C8)           [392] mm, yeah
James (PS1C7)              [393] well if you went out the back for ten minutes
Patricia (PS1C8)           [394] and it's strong
James (PS1C7)              [395] and you come back, er and you come back in
                           here you would smell it again
Patricia (PS1C8)           [396] that's right, of course you would, mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [397] and that's how you can tell there's no draught
                           because the smoke can't go out anywhere
Patricia (PS1C8)           [398] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [399] it's trapped, I mean I, I open me front ...

Patricia (PS1C8)           [432] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [433] no ... if I remember rightly, during the war
                           when the only cigarette that had the filter and it
                           wasn't a filter, oh it was a
Patricia (PS1C8)           [434] You'd have to suck
James (PS1C7)              [...]
Patricia (PS1C8)           [435] yes, that's right
James (PS1C7)              [436] no, it wasn't a filter, all it was on the end
                           of a cigarette what you put in your mouth, it was a
                           cork tip, but there was no filter, no filter inside
                           it, the tobacco come right to the end
Patricia (PS1C8)           [437] that's right
James (PS1C7)              [438] all that cork tip was for was to stop it on
                           your lips
Patricia (PS1C8)           [439] stop it sticking to your lips yeah that's
                           right, [laugh]
James (PS1C7)              [440] cos you know er [...] you know
Patricia (PS1C8)           [441] yes, that's right I think it were the first

James (PS1C7)              [442] really, yeah er, er [...] introduced er later
                           on, but the one filter all it was, was a cork tip

                           in ... I think that now that, tobacco er vegetables
                           all the likes of that ... is different now what it
                           was forty, fifty years ago
Patricia (PS1C8)           [447] Oh [...]
James (PS1C7)              [448] because they're treating all these things that

Patricia (PS1C8)           [471] mm, mm
James (PS1C7)              [472] she said well it happened to me, it's the
                           chemicals on the skin of the fruit and the tomatoes,
                           that's what brought your spots on ... and after a
                           couple of days or whatever they went away.

                           getting round about Christmas, they had brought them
                           in, they had polished them and put that spray on to
                           make them look shiny

James (PS1C7)              [478] mm
Patricia (PS1C8)           [479] if they'd keep for Christmas that's why they
                           charged so much for them, those Mackintosh reds and
                           that, and I mean it told you then in one of those
                           magazines that were, John was reading that he said
                           make sure that you wash those apples before you eat
                           them. ...

                           erm, I was gonna make a salad when I realized that I
                           didn't like corned beef
James (PS1C7)              [798] No
Patricia (PS1C8)           [799] our Susan does, I didn't ... and I thought
