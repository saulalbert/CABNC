*CLA:	Mm and they shouldn't be   (.) can't, rather it can't be down to lack of   (.) contact I wouldn't have thought.
*NIN:	No.
*CLA:	In part I suppose it's due to   (.) erm   (.) complete contrast of lifestyle between Jill and Steve's way and our way. (.) Could be. (.)  (        ) She was just like an automated   (.) programmed doll, oh god.Poor kids can't help it of course but  (        )

*NIN:	Oh she has done already hasn't she?She's better than she was.
*CLA:	Oh indeed yes.Yes.Certainly has.Mm. (.) I mean it's most unnatural for a child not to be   (.) chatting away in the presence of grandparents isn't it? [laughing] Unless the grandparents are a couple of weirdies  [] .Perhaps she thinks we're two weird, no I'm weird anyway. (.) Could be right. (.)

*CLA:	No. (.)  (        ) very brief   (        ) this morning I think.We were due for better weather today which we've had. (.) And then I think more rain tonight  (        ) .But as the girl in the   (.) post office said erm   (.) it's usually different here than the weather forecast which is probably is, the gulf stream
