*PHI:	Excuse me. •_•
        Run out of. •_•
*CHR:	Dee dee dee dee . •_•
*JAN:	Oh I thought it was informal. •_•
*PHI:	I'd like to believe that er •_•
*JAN:	David! •_•
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	David wants to go to bed. •_•
*PHI:	I know he does. •_•
*CHR:	 ((humming)) 
*PHI:	Do you want to go to bed David? •_•
*DAV:	 ((mimicking snoring)) 
*JAN:	I think you're as well on, on the sofa with er •_•
*PHI:	Why what's up? •_•
*JAN:	the rug. •_•
*DAV:	Go to bed. •_•
*PHI:	Go on then. •_•
*DAV:	Mhm. •_•
*PHI:	Not, not like him to ever want to go to bed truly. •_•
*CHR:	 ((humming)) 
*JAN:	He had a late night  •_•
*PHI:	Do you want your tea over there or do you want it •_•
*JAN:	No I'll bring it, I wanna go over there. •_•
        We're going to be late to dinner tonight aren't we I think? •_•
*PHI:	Ah. •_•
*JAN:	The time's . •_•
*PHI:	Nothing's boiling. •_•
*JAN:	Well that's true. •_•
*CHR:	 ((humming)) 
*JAN:	If we  were you thinking of going to Health Chardonne? •_•
*PHI:	Well  yes, because er A  •_•
*JAN:	Only I thought  •_•
*PHI:	if they deliver it it's  cheaper than going to Scunny or  •_•
*JAN:	Well yes, but we've still got the problem of erm •_•
*PHI:	But if, if we go in my car to fetch it I can't take the kids. •_•
*JAN:	I know. •_•
        I know. •_•
        Well, which means I can't come. •_•
        I thought it'd be nice if we all went together. •_•
        But you mean go during the week some time? •_•
*PHI:	No, I wasn't thinking of any time. •_•
        Erm  you could take two cars if you want to. •_•
*JAN:	No, I think that's a bit of a waste. •_•
        I thought you might have time during the week to pop into Hull that was all. •_•
        A lunchtime  •_•
*PHI:	No. •_•
*JAN:	or something. •_•
        I could come with you. •_•
*PHI:	Well I don't know. •_•
        I really don't know. •_•
*JAN:	You don't know what a normal week is now do you? •_•
*PHI:	Anyway popping into Hull is a thing of the past isn't it? •_•
*JAN:	I suppose it is. •_•
        Well how much are their delivery charges? •_•
*PHI:	Well I don't know. •_•
        Ten, fifteen quid I should think. •_•
*JAN:	Ee ooh! •_•
        Well it's worth asking anyway isn't it? •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
        If they'd left one of these out •_•
*JAN:	Oh. •_•
*PHI:	when we were down in B & Q  •_•
*JAN:	Oh while we were there the other day. •_•
*PHI:	wouldn't have had to spend those hours •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
*PHI:	finding somebody. •_•
        Twenty two to, Hardpool Star garden compost . •_•
        That's thirty four ninety nine. •_•
*JAN:	You see. •_•
        I mean, all these, these grass cuttings erm from what Chris is doing now could go in. •_•
        It's a shame just to waste it isn't it? •_•
*PHI:	B & Q growing bags. •_•
        The only thing is, you can't find them. •_•
*JAN:	Cos you're filling up the weeder bin and I want  well  anyway,we've got to get sorted out compost for it. •_•
        There's some baby sweet corn left erm  oh I might get  •_•
*PHI:	They, they won't be very good. •_•
*JAN:	I'll put them in a chicken casserole tomorrow. •_•
        I can use all these peppers up as well. •_•
        With the sauce. •_•
        Oh I need some more tomatoes. •_•
        I guess Chrissy's coming in for something to eat. •_•
*PHI:	Well I called him but  I didn't think there was a rush. •_•
*JAN:	No there isn't. •_•
        Saturdays are going to take some, they always take some getting used to when the football season's first finishing. •_•
        I don't know   •_•
*PHI:	The erm  •_•
*JAN:	ah I've got loads of mushrooms left, put those in the casserole, that's what I've got left . •_•
*PHI:	The B & Q conservatory, that one you were in the other day •_•
*JAN:	Oh yes. •_•
*PHI:	which comes in one size, twelve foot four by ten foot two. •_•
*JAN:	Oh! •_•
        Want one bigger than that. •_•
*PHI:	Three thousand six hundred and ninety nine. •_•
        Not bad. •_•
*JAN:	Oh! •_•
        Erm  talking about conservatories  for which you need , I've read about the quiz. •_•
        Yes, it starts at, it says on the front it starts at seven, and then at the back  it says the actual quiz starts at seven thirty. •_•
        Seven thirty to eight fifteen, then there's an interval which you have pie and peas, which is always good at the town hall  erm, and then it's nine to nine thirty part two of the quiz. •_•
        So really it sounds the sort of thing that'll be nice for you and I to go really just to get away from the children. •_•
        Or do you want to go on your own so you don't have to get a sitter? •_•
        But I need to be knowing cos if we're going out I'll have to •_•
*PHI:	That's right. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	let the other  man, the conservatory man know, it's not fair to  not be here to . •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
        He's gonna be a pain in the neck! •_•
*JAN:	I know love. •_•
*PHI:	I mean  there's no intention of letting somebody like that have a go. •_•
        I was gonna do it myself. •_•
*JAN:	Well if there's no intention I may as well cancel him altogether. •_•
        There's no point in wasting his time either. •_•
*PHI:	Well we're not are we? •_•
*JAN:	Well if we're not I'll ring him up and say  I'll say  er •_•
*PHI:	Hey we're going out and be,we're going to have them build us one, I mean  er  my intention is I might get  Stuart  or somebody to put the bricks at the bottom. •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
        Sort of a semi do-it-yourself. •_•
*PHI:	But it'll, I'll assemble it myself. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
        Okay. •_•
        Cos Johnny can come up and give us a hand can't he? •_•
*PHI:	I could do the lot actually if it comes down to it. •_•
*JAN:	Are you okay with what I've put out? •_•
        That ham and potato and salad. •_•
*PHI:	Yeah! •_•
        More than enough thanks. •_•
*JAN:	I'll warm some of these, well I won't warm all of them. •_•
*PHI:	 ((whistling)) 
*JAN:	Right. •_•
        Davey! •_•
        Come on. •_•
        Do do you want some ham and some peppers? •_•
        If you get a jacket potato? •_•
*DAV:	I'll do it mum. •_•
        Is it, is it old, old? •_•
*JAN:	Yes, it's the same sort of thing, and then it warms them up. •_•
*DAV:	No thanks. •_•
*JAN:	No? •_•
        Oh! •_•
*DAV:	 ((talking from other room)) (        ) 
*PHI:	Chrissy! •_•
*CHR:	I'm not finished yet. •_•
*PHI:	Lunchtime. •_•
        Stop it. •_•
*JAN:	He's done very well hasn't he? •_•
*PHI:	Stop the mower. •_•
        Oh I haven't shown you how to do that. •_•
        Chris! •_•
        Oh what the heck! •_•
*JAN:	Well as long as he doesn't hurt himself. •_•
        It's alright Chris. •_•
        Dad's saying you haven't you've done very well. •_•
*CHR:	That's still going but er    •_•
*JAN:	But it  •_•
*CHR:	come back to all the grass now. •_•
*JAN:	I can see, can you can you go and  get all the grass off your socks ! •_•
        Ah ah! •_•
        He, says he's been in the wheelie bin and jumped on the grass Phil . •_•
*PHI:	Who? •_•
*JAN:	He says, he's filled the wheelie bin and it's he's been in it and jumped on the top, so course  his track suit is   •_•
*PHI:	Well it's not  it's not bad what you've done. •_•
*JAN:	got covered in grass. •_•
*PHI:	Pardon? •_•
*CHR:	I didn't do that much. •_•
*PHI:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	I thought you had to push it? •_•
*PHI:	Oh no. •_•
        . Erm  take your gloves and just shake them outside. •_•
*CHR:	What's that? •_•
*PHI:	No I'll, I'll have another go later. •_•
*JAN:	I'll warm those up. •_•
        I think I'll warm all those up because we might eat  •_•
*PHI:	Bye. •_•
*JAN:	them all. •_•
        Ooh it's cold! •_•
*PHI:	Well he's coming in. •_•
        David! •_•
        Come on! •_•
*JAN:	I shall hoover you to get that grass off. •_•
        Thank you, cleaning these up. •_•
*PHI:	Hands washed boyo. •_•
*JAN:	I bet it's come again and I was dashing in to, I had about two minutes to  Sunday  •_•
*PHI:	Hey! •_•
*JAN:	night. •_•
        And I as it was I was in the bread queue. •_•
*CHR:	Aargh! •_•
*JAN:	And queue up soon and get in there. •_•
*PHI:	Who complained? •_•
        Either way, that's too late for the kids. •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
*PHI:	But the thing you won't like it, it'll probably be John there. •_•
*JAN:	John? •_•
*PHI:	. •_•
        Well he will be. •_•
*JAN:	Well  aha  •_•
*PHI:	and Simon and things. •_•
        Yes, well, if you go, if just you and I go we're likely to end up with somebody who knows us. •_•
*JAN:	We have to make up a team though don't we? •_•
        I mean, we can't do it on our own? •_•
*PHI:	But you, probably wouldn't want to be with John. •_•
*JAN:	Well  yes but it  will  Ruth be going? •_•
        And how are we going to make a team? •_•
*PHI:	I would doubt Ruth will be going. •_•
*JAN:	But it sounds as if it's a sort of family evening though doesn't it? •_•
        I mean  shall we take somebody with us? •_•
        I mean, would Dave and Wendy want to go? •_•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •_•
        I don't know. •_•
        I don't really know what it is. •_•
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	But I'll read it again. •_•
        Hang on. •_•
*JAN:	Read it again. •_•
        We ought to be making our minds up. •_•
        Cos if that, if you go on your own that's fine, but if I'm going we've got to get a sitter. •_•
*PHI:	Well it says, entrants may take part as individuals or as teams of up to four persons. •_•
*JAN:	Oh well, oh you and I can do a  •_•
*PHI:	So we don't need •_•
*JAN:	you and I can do a team on our own then. •_•
*CHR:	Can I come as well? •_•
*JAN:	I'd like to take you Chris but it is a school night, I think it's going to be,it'll be ten o'clock before we got home. •_•
*PHI:	The quiz will contain some sixty questions covering general knowledge and not just railways. •_•
        So there is nothing for a family to be afraid of . •_•
*JAN:	If it was er space then we need Chris because •_•
*CHR:	Mm mm mm. •_•
*JAN:	we need Chris as our space expert. •_•
*DAV:	And me! •_•
        As my  •_•
*JAN:	Oh! •_•
        And you, aren't you being  •_•
*PHI:	What are you an expert on? •_•
*JAN:	What are you an expert on? •_•
*DAV:	Railways. •_•
*JAN:	Well that's true, yes. •_•
*PHI:	Yes, you're not bad are you? •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
*DAV:	They don't even know who built the first engine? •_•
*PHI:	Who don't? •_•
*DAV:	The people at the quiz. •_•
*JAN:	Oh I'm sure •_•
*PHI:	Oh I should think they will do. •_•
*CHR:	The person who's . •_•
*JAN:	Definitely. •_•
*DAV:	Yes. •_•
        Like you go  number one,. •_•
*CHR:	Number one, who's Richard ? •_•
        A person . •_•
*PHI:	Where from? •_•
*DAV:	Now, number two, he's a  •_•
*CHR:	England. •_•
*DAV:	he's a Cornish man. •_•
*PHI:	Very good. •_•
        Very good. •_•
        What was his inside leg measurements? •_•
*DAV:	That's English. •_•
        It's English though isn't it? •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	Who wants a tiny bit  •_•
*PHI:	Yes, Chris. •_•
*JAN:	of cheese? •_•
*PHI:	But actually he built his first engine, I think, for a  quarry in •_•
*DAV:	Pennydaryn Pennydaryn. •_•
*JAN:	Wales. •_•
*PHI:	That's right. •_•
        And where was that? •_•
        Yes. •_•
*CHR:	Wales. •_•
*PHI:	Chrissy's got it. •_•
*JAN:	For a six year old you know a lot about engines. •_•
        The potato's ready in a moment kids. •_•
*DAV:	Dad. •_•
*PHI:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	If anyone wants a little bit of cheese I'll do it. •_•
*DAV:	I know he, he broke the rails  •_•
*JAN:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	he broke in rails because some silly man was talking to him in Wales! •_•
*JAN:	cholesterol level . •_•
        Actually I'll do a little bit more than that. •_•
*DAV:	Well that's Richard  's fault. •_•
*PHI:	No, no it wasn't he put on too many weights sunshine  •_•
*JAN:	Oh no you can't have much cheese. •_•
*PHI:	The engine was just too heavy. •_•
*DAV:	Yes. •_•
*JAN:	What happened? •_•
*PHI:	Er er  what? •_•
*DAV:	It it broke, it broke  •_•
*JAN:	To, to, to the engine? •_•
*DAV:	the track, it split the rails. •_•
*JAN:	Did it? •_•
*DAV:	Yeah. •_•
*PHI:	Well yes  •_•
*JAN:	I don't know much about this sort of thing. •_•
        You don't want  •_•
*PHI:	because the  •_•
*JAN:	any cheese do you Phillip? •_•
*PHI:	No thanks. •_•
        The plate, the plate ways, the railways they had then  were built for horses to pull trucks on. •_•
*JAN:	Thank you. •_•
*PHI:	And they  •_•
*DAV:	They fell off. •_•
*PHI:	they didn't know a lot about steel, they were made out of iron. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
        You can have a   •_•
*PHI:	And when he built his first engine it was made out of erm  iron and stuff and was extremely heavy. •_•
*JAN:	I haven't done enough peppers. •_•
        What am I thinking of there? •_•
*CHR:	Is steel lighter than iron? •_•
*PHI:	Well not necessarily Chris. •_•
        Erm •_•
*CHR:	Is it stronger but  •_•
*PHI:	It's, it's stronger weight for weight, you see, or  well it can be in certain circumstances. •_•
*JAN:	Grab a chair there. •_•
*PHI:	Steel tends to be a bit more elastic. •_•
*CHR:	Oh. •_•
*PHI:	Iron iron, certainly the stuff they used then, cast iron, was very brittle and •_•
*CHR:	Aha. •_•
*PHI:	so it won't stand shocks. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*PHI:	So if you put a big heavy engine going down a cast iron railway  which won't  •_•
*CHR:	That might hit the railway, •_•
*PHI:	which won't be made  properly •_•
*CHR:	Ah. •_•
*PHI:	it'll go  and crack it. •_•
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*PHI:	But I mean, having said that, there's lots of cast iron bridges around still,the one at Stamford Bridge is er •_•
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*PHI:	cast iron and I mean, it's no problem in that  situation. •_•
*DAV:	And get a shock. •_•
        Ah ah! •_•
        The steam engine  coming through . •_•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •_•
*DAV:	And that railway that, little railway is made of cast iron. •_•
        In the middle. •_•
*JAN:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	I just said that. •_•
        The one at Stamford? •_•
*JAN:	 (        )  (        ) 
*DAV:	Near the old railway bridge. •_•
*PHI:	Which one David? •_•
*CHR:	The walk on one? •_•
*JAN:	Which one? •_•
        Over there? •_•
*PHI:	Oh! •_•
        This one here. •_•
        No, that'll be steel. •_•
        That was only cos you came  •_•
*JAN:	Ham David? •_•
*DAV:	Yes please. •_•
*PHI:	in the, in the sixties Chris it wasn't erm so  •_•
*JAN:	I didn't make any coleslaw, you like coleslaw don't you? •_•
*PHI:	So it's a comparatively modern bridge. •_•
*JAN:	I'll have some lettuce  •_•
*PHI:	 •_•
*JAN:	though. •_•
*PHI:	there used to be a level crossing there. •_•
*DAV:	Mm mm. •_•
        Oh yeah. •_•
*PHI:	Eastgate used to go right through down to join •_•
*DAV:	Hey! •_•
*PHI:	erm •_•
*JAN:	That's right. •_•
*PHI:	Anderson Street. •_•
*JAN:	Ooh! •_•
*PHI:	But you see that would have given, one, two, three, four crossings on that, within half a mile in Driffield, so they closed that one and put a footbridge over and erm  thanks. •_•
*JAN:	I'll take that. •_•
        I'll take that one for you. •_•
*CHR:	And three crossings in about five hundred metres. •_•
*PHI:	Well, that's about right, yes. •_•
        So, you can imagine what it'll be like cos erm  twenty years ago in the summer, well no, twenty five years ago •_•
*DAV:	That one. •_•
*PHI:	Saturdays and Sundays there would be trains every ten minutes going to Brid. •_•
*JAN:	Are you going to put butter on that yourself  •_•
*DAV:	 •_•
*JAN:	darling? •_•
*DAV:	Attlington. •_•
*PHI:	Pardon? •_•
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	You've got your mouth full. •_•
        Just wait. •_•
*JAN:	That's not right. •_•
        So do, erm I'll get you some butter in a minute. •_•
*CHR:	They go every half hour now don't they? •_•
*PHI:	Hang on a minute, it's •_•
*JAN:	I think so. •_•
*PHI:	 ((sneeze)) 
*JAN:	They don't take long. •_•
*PHI:	Oh excuse me! •_•
        That's the damp grass. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*DAV:	Dad. •_•
*PHI:	Yeah. •_•
        Erm  no they  •_•
*DAV:	Dad I said er  •_•
*PHI:	well er, I'm, excuse me David I'm talking to Chris. •_•
        Yeah, they're normally every half  hour, but •_•
*CHR:	In the sixties  •_•
*PHI:	when it used to be summer Saturdays and Sundays they were excursions, they weren't  service trains. •_•
        Some weekends like erm, not Easter, bank holidays, August bank holiday and stuff, you'd have as many as they could get in. •_•
*CHR:	You know I don't •_•
*JAN:	I'm sorry, I was just, I was gonna pass that to daddy. •_•
*PHI:	And did you know that when, when they used to go to Bridlington you know, you know where the big signal box is at Bridlington, near B & Q? •_•
*CHR:	Yeah, yes  •_•
*PHI:	Where the bus, and you know where the buses park and everything, that used to be all sidings  right under that bridge that's got the weight limit on •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*PHI:	for storing the engines and the coaches  for the excursions  •_•
*DAV:	And trucks. •_•
*PHI:	and they used to get so many •_•
*DAV:	And trucks. •_•
*PHI:	And trucks Dave. •_•
        Well they didn't have trucks for excursions, they didn't take any sheep and cattle to the seaside for a day. •_•
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	But •_•
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	they erm •_•
*JAN:	The donkeys were already there. •_•
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	they used to, they used to travel them back to Driffield if they were full and keep the empty coaches  in two sidings. •_•
        It used to be down to Meadow Road. •_•
        And they used to keep them there until it was time for people to go out and then they'd run them back up to Brid. •_•
        So it was that crowded. •_•
*DAV:	How did you know? •_•
*JAN:	You know, you'd think things had changed a long time ago but erm  I remember having Chrissy in that yard when he was a baby in his pushchair  where  and there was the coalman's horse and erm •_•
*PHI:	Oh at Brid? •_•
*JAN:	cart at Bridlington. •_•
        You know, and guess what, I remember •_•
*CHR:	I can remember that. •_•
*JAN:	it was Edgar. •_•
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	You can remember? •_•
        That's very impressive! •_•
