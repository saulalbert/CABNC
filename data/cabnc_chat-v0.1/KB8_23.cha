*DOR:	I was gonna ask a favour, if you don't mind for tonight. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah? •_•
*DOR:	Would you mind having the boys for about half an hour because I would like to get Bryony's hair cut. •_•
        I want about three or four inches off the bottom  •_•
*ANN:	Mhm  •_•
*DOR:	and I think she's gonna have an absolute screaming fit. •_•
*ANN:	Where're you taking her? •_•
*DOR:	Probably to the one at Staffhill if I could have an, if I can get an appointment booked. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah  •_•
*DOR:	It's just that, well you can imagine what she's gonna be like. •_•
        But she screams so much when she gets her hair cut and she won't have  •_•
*ANN:	I know. •_•
*DOR:	it tied back. •_•
        So even though I'd like  •_•
*ANN:	I still haven't given, that's reminded me seeing Shona there, I, I don't think I've given her that pair of trousers and the sweatshirt and I told her that I've got them. •_•
        I must look for them. •_•
*DOR:	Right, so that'd be lovely if you don't mind having them after school. •_•
*ANN:	Right, I'll get you these er •_•
*DOR:	Oh I'll pick them up  if you like, cos I'm gonna go and see if I can get my shoes  •_•
*ANN:	Alright, well I'll, I'll give you them now cos they're here in the car. •_•
*DOR:	Oh right! •_•
*ANN:	I've got I've got them with me. •_•
        That's erm the card with teddy bears on that Bryony wanted that she kept  •_•
*DOR:	Oh right last night. •_•
*ANN:	she kept meaning to take home and kept forgetting. •_•
*DOR:	isn't it? •_•
*ANN:	It is, yes. •_•
        Oh she loved it. •_•
        She carried it all around on er Tuesday. •_•
        Right, there are your videos. •_•
*DOR:	Right, thanks. •_•
        The children have been difficult this weekend I don't know what's a matter with them, I think they're just •_•
*ANN:	Well, the er they seem to  Richard seemed to cry a bit more or a bit easier, you know, if he bumped himself and Bryony, and I think it was, well Bryony it seemed to be a heavy cold that was making her feel miserable. •_•
*DOR:	Yes •_•
*ANN:	And I think maybe it was with all of them. •_•
        They were just slightly under the weather. •_•
*DOR:	And Martin has taught them to say you stupid zombie. •_•
*ANN:	Oh great! •_•
        Oh great! •_•
*DOR:	I know, that's I'm really pleased about that. •_•
*ANN:	Oh dear! •_•
*DOR:	So James is going around calling everybody a stupid zombie. •_•
*ANN:	Oh well, it makes a change from a  stupid idiot  •_•
*DOR:	I know. •_•
        It's gonna be wonderful at nursery if he goes straight up to his teacher again. •_•
*ANN:	Oh. •_•
*DOR:	Oh heck. •_•
*ANN:	Again? •_•
        Why? •_•
*DOR:	You know when she told him to close the cupboard? •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
*DOR:	At nursery? •_•

*DOR:	I know  •_•
*ANN:	or  a good impression . •_•
*DOR:	I know. •_•

*ANN:	I heard her say you've got your hands full but I didn't know why. •_•
        Oh, hey. •_•
*DOR:	And then with Richard having the screaming fits when it was time to go home. •_•
*ANN:	Ah but that, that  •_•
*DOR:	Very reluctant. •_•
