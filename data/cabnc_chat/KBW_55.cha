*AND:	Certainly my dear. •_•
*DOR:	Thank you. •_•
        So what's on the agenda for you today then dear? •_•

*DOR:	Oh. •_•
*AND:	suppose Julia will be there. •_•
        boss   •_•
*DOR:	Suppose the what, sorry? •_•
*AND:	Don't suppose Julia will be there. •_•
        My boss is getting to the position where he wants lots of information from me. •_•
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*AND:	Last night, before I came home  he dragged me into his office to  work out how much money  we spend  Pontypool  delivering parts to Solihull. •_•
*DOR:	And do you know? •_•
        No, so you had to sit and work it out. •_•
*AND:	We had, we had to work it out. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        I sat with a price list. •_•
        He sat with a calculator. •_•
*DOR:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*AND:	He only did that simply because he gets asked questions. •_•
*DOR:	Mm. •_•
*AND:	Thing I don't approve of is the fact that  when I ask questions •_•
*DOR:	You don't get  •_•

*CHR:	Four sultanas today. •_•
*DOR:	Oh dear. •_•
*CHR:	There's lots of Alpen in here but not very many sultanas. •_•
*DOR:	Really? •_•
        They're probably all at the bottom. •_•
*CHR:	What? •_•
*DOR:	They are probably all at the bottom. •_•
*CHR:	You say they're always at the top. •_•
*DOR:	Actually they do tend to be, don't they? •_•
        They tend to be at the top and then there's sort of little bits and pieces go at the bottom. •_•
        So perhaps you'd had it. •_•
        Perhaps you won't get any sultanas now. •_•
*CHR:	Why? •_•
*DOR:	Till the end of the Alpen. •_•
        I don't know. •_•
        I'm just guessing. •_•
*AND:	I'm afraid the toast wasn't very square shaped. •_•
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*AND:	Somebody must have sat on the loaf or something. •_•
*DOR:	Probably squashed it on the way home from Tesco's. •_•
*TIM:	you squash it. •_•
        Then   •_•
*AND:	Well it did get squashed. •_•
        Did you see? •_•
        What's happened to the loaf? •_•
        Somebody must have sat on it, or pulled it or    •_•
*TIM:	if you do that  •_•
*CHR:	I  one. •_•
*AND:	No. •_•
        You'll find your sandwiches at work will be a little, your sandwiches at school will be a little bit squashed. •_•

*TIM:	Look at mine . •_•
*AND:	We knew they were coming to say non. •_•

        Will you let him? •_•
        Yes? •_•
        Will you sit on the chair, open your mouth, let him stick a mirror in? •_•
        Aah. •_•
*TIM:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*CHR:	Stick a mirror in? •_•
        We don't  •_•
*DOR:	I seem to remember last time you got two stickers didn't you, cos you had super clean teeth? •_•
        I bet you only get one sticker this time. •_•
*CHR:	Why? •_•
*TIM:	You think I'm gonna get two? •_•
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	You'd have to clean them out very  did that. •_•
*DOR:	I think you were a bit lucky to get two stickers. •_•
        I would have thought one sticker would be sufficient really. •_•
*CHR:	It was when Mrs  was there then wasn't it mummy? •_•
*DOR:	Was it? •_•
*CHR:	Mrs  was there. •_•
*DOR:	Mm probably. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*CHR:	It was. •_•
*DOR:	Oh you went to school didn't you? •_•
        There was a dentist came to school, remember? •_•
        And we had a letter home saying something about you need to go to the local dentist or something for treatment. •_•
        no possible treatment. •_•
        And I think it was cos of the wobbly front tooth when  you bent it back when you fell over my foot. •_•
*CHR:	But next time it won't  •_•
*DOR:	So we didn't bother going because we were regularly going anyway. •_•
*CHR:	What? •_•
*DOR:	 ((clears throat)) 
*CHR:	You didn't bother going cos we  •_•
*DOR:	No. •_•
*CHR:	were regularly going? •_•
*DOR:	Yeah. •_•
        Well I didn't see much point  •_•
*CHR:	What does regularly mean? •_•
*DOR:	Regularly means that we go in anyway every six months you go and have your teeth checked to see if they're okay. •_•
*CHR:	Every six •_•
*DOR:	So just when some  some bod comes to school and  opens your mouth and says ooh, this looks interesting, there's not much point because  our own dentist knows about it. •_•
*CHR:	So you don't really need to be checked at school? •_•
*DOR:	No I wouldn't have thought so. •_•
        But some people don't go to the dentist regularly, so they need to be checked at school. •_•
        People like Michelle probably never set eyes on a dentist normally. •_•
        It's probably a good thing for a dentist to have a look at her teeth and see what needs doing. •_•
*CHR:	Because her mum  and her mum doesn't ? •_•
*DOR:	Mm probably. •_•
*CHR:	They've never been? •_•
*DOR:	Probably not. •_•
*CHR:	Why? •_•
*TIM:	We have. •_•
*DOR:	I'm just guessing. •_•
        We've been, yeah. •_•
        But not everybody does. •_•
        Well not everybody likes dentists and they think that something  •_•
*TIM:	Well well we  •_•
*DOR:	awful's gonna happen to them. •_•
        They're wrong  •_•
*CHR:	What? •_•
*DOR:	cos it's nice isn't it, at the dentist? •_•
*TIM:	Think everyone goes. •_•
*CHR:	To the dentist. •_•
*DOR:	Well everybody  ought to go to the dentist if they want to keep their teeth nice and healthy. •_•
        But not everybody does cos some people get frightened of dentists and they think ooh I don't want to go there. •_•
        But that's silly cos there's nothing to be frightened of is there? •_•
        It's nice at the dentist. •_•
*TIM:	No no-one can get frightened. •_•
*DOR:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	But they won't get stickers will they? •_•
*DOR:	True. •_•
*TIM:	They won't get stickers dad. •_•
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TIM:	If they go  •_•
*CHR:	got toothbrushes to give you   but the     •_•
*DOR:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	can't see that can you? •_•
*DOR:	No, you can't see that. •_•
        That's why you need a mirror. •_•
*TIM:	Could I have one of those ? •_•
*DOR:	Can you have what? •_•
*TIM:	Have one of those things. •_•
*DOR:	What things? •_•
*TIM:	Those pink things that after we had our lunch. •_•
*DOR:	Pink things? •_•
*TIM:	Yeah. •_•
        Er those things in that bottle. •_•
*DOR:	Oh I know what you mean. •_•
        For your throat? •_•
*TIM:	Yeah. •_•
*DOR:	Yes you can do, just wipe your hands first. •_•
*CHR:	Why? •_•
*DOR:	Well he's got his sore throat here. •_•
*CHR:	I've got a sore throat too. •_•
*DOR:	Have you? •_•
        Right. •_•
*TIM:	And you. •_•
*DOR:	You can have one each. •_•
*CHR:	Where are they? •_•
*DOR:	In the kitchen. •_•
*CHR:	Would I spot it? •_•
*DOR:	I don't know. •_•
*TIM:	Think I'm going to get them because  I  I   •_•
*DOR:	No Tim. •_•
