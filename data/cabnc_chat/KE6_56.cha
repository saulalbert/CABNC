*WEN:	Must of done   (.) tonight.Cos, I say the car was down the road.I've never known that!Never!
*BEV:	Do you know what?
*WEN:	Mm?
*BEV:	I know it's a horrible thing to say
*WEN:	Mm?
*BEV:	but   (.) it's a shame nobody else
*WEN:	Mm?
*BEV:	got woken up last night.Sort of somebody's put the   (        ) the road.If somebody wanted to get out quickly
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	and couldn't
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	and they went to the wrong door   (.) and said is this car anything
*WEN:	Well tha , that's right!I mean erm   (.) I
*BEV:	Because say   (.) Gail and Keith go got woken up at three o'clock in the morning
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	and said 
*WEN:	That's right!
*BEV:	is that your car outside? (        ) 
*WEN:	Yeah.Well Alan did it here one, one time.
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	And it wasn't us.
*BEV:	No, but you know what I mean?
*WEN:	Yes I do know what you mean.Well
*BEV:	It'll be unfortunate for the couple that, whoever got woken up
*WEN:	Yeah.But it might do something.I know what you're meaning.
*BEV:	Cos you dunno what Alan might have done.
*WEN:	Ay?
*BEV:	You dunno what Alan might have done.
*WEN:	Well 
*BEV:	If that car was there and
*WEN:	Yeah.It, I think he got out and I I do   (.) he , I said to you and your father how he got out I just dunno!Cos it's a very difficult road this.
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	But I think he did   (.) probably just, because when I got up   (.) er   (.) when I co , you see when I come down the stairs I can see through that window look
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	and   (.) Alan's light was on in the hall, call it the hall   (.) and the car was there   (.) well a little while later   (.) he went.I think he got out   (.) but I don't think it would have been easy, there's   (.) that time this morning.And, I've never known these people   (.) put the car down by George's!So, knowing Alan, do you remember somebody   (.) used to park their car in front of Alan's gate when they went to London?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	And he left a note on the windscreen.But I mean Alan has to go up to London!It's not long after six o'clock in the morning that he leaves. (.) But er   (.)  (        ) , I fully understand what you're saying.Really!
*BEV:	Well I say   (.) some   (.) let's say Sandra wanted to get out
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	and couldn't   (.) and can't 
*WEN:	Yeah!Yeah!
*BEV:	Right?
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	And she should be able to.
*WEN:	But another thing is you see   (.) where Sandra lives, you saying that   (.) where she lives is apparently   (.) erm   (.) P C , now I don't know him, but she does   (.) he lives up the same road   (.) and when people park   (.) didn't she tell you this when we were coming down?
*BEV:	No , I don't mean that Sandra, I meant this one!
*WEN:	Oh Sandra over here?
*BEV:	Right?
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	Let's just say she couldn't out
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	and she went to Claire and George tonight
*WEN:	Yeah.
*BEV:	and said is   (.) anybody staying with you?
*WEN:	Oh yeah, that'd do it!
*BEV:	That would do it wouldn't it?
*WEN:	But, what I was gonna say was   (.) concerning them blocking these pavements   (.) if the 
*BEV:	I know as we  (.) I was there when she 
*WEN:	You were there when she said about P C .Well if we had some   (.) I know there's two policemen up round the corner here.Cos they walk down here, here 
*BEV:	Is there any one in  (        ) ?
*WEN:	Well P C  I think   (.) is an older policeman.
*BEV:	Yeah, that's what I meant.
*WEN:	Mm.These are two young-uns I reckon they lodge up here somewhere.Not this road   (.) but round   (.) where Colin and 
*BEV:	 (        ) any policemen isn't she?
*WEN:	Ay?You what?
*BEV:	The lodger, policeman.
*WEN:	Who did?
*BEV:	Linda.
*WEN:	Yeah, she did didn't she?
*BEV:	A nice one.
*WEN:	I forgot that.Yeah.Yeah.But you see somebody like P C , being an older person   (.) he does it properly I suppose, is what 
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	the answer is.He goes and knocks people's door and says you're blocking the pavement!Well if he'd have come down here that night, or that day   (.) when there was three cars in   (.) in the drive and one   (.) right across the pavement, and then that   (.) that big lorry on the pavement   (.) he'd have had them wouldn't he?
*BEV:	Yeah.
