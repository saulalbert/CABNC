Wendy (PS04E)              [893] No not up there no but down [...]

                           said George this old man he's said I'm going to give
                           this to the manager like he said because I've been
                           brought all these trolleys back.
                           [901] She said put it in your pocket. [...]
Julie (PS04F)              [902] She said that's your perk that's one of the
                           perks of your job.
                           [903] You're out there in the cold [...]

Julie (PS04F)              [907] To the till desk.
Betty (PS04B)              [908] No they're all clipped together
Wendy (PS04E)              [909] Yeah?
Betty (PS04B)              [910] And to get them unclipped you got to push a
                           pound coin in one way and the clip comes out the
                           back
Wendy (PS04E)              [911] And it comes out the other yes.
Betty (PS04B)              [912] So when you take your trolley back and clip it
                           back up the pound comes out the front again.
Julie (PS04F)              [913] Oh dear!

                           manager.

                           with it?
Wendy (PS04E)              [922] He'll put it in his pocket.
Betty (PS04B)              [923] He'll put it in his bloody pocket wouldn't he?

                           gorging he's always eating something like you know.
                           [938] She says and we can't get a bloody sweet she
                           says.

                           of the cupboard you know?
Julie (PS04F)              [1028] And yet the stores is covered for any erm one
                           who pinches and that.

Julie (PS04F)              [1050] Why you doing two to ten tomorrow?

                           getting up have you?
Maggie (PS04G)             [1069] Well I said I sort of trundle down the stairs
                           and have me breakfast [...]
Betty (PS04B)              [...] [...]
Maggie (PS04G)             [1070] Well that's it that's it.
                           [1071] I said no bloody way am I working on a
                           Sunday.
                           [1072] I said these daft buggers that come in and do
                           it it's up to them. [...]
Julie (PS04F)              [1073] I don't know I don't know.
                           [1074] I suppose if people wants to go to the
                           shopping centres they [...] .
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [1075] I wouldn't go to the shops on Sunday.
Betty (PS04B)              [1076] No I wouldn't.
                           [1077] I wouldn't go on a Sunday. [...]
Sally (PS04H)              [1078] I mean there's seven days in the week isn't
                           there?
Wendy (PS04E)              [1079] I mean I mean how can people afford to do it
                           Bet?
                           [1080] I mean [...] .
                           [1081] I mean to my mind if they're opening on a
                           Sunday they should bring their prices down ...
                           because they're opening that extra day they're going
                           to be taking extra revenue.
Betty (PS04B)              [1082] Yeah of course they are.
Maggie (PS04G)             [1083] So they should be made to bring their prices
                           down.
                           [1084] That is why they put that freeze on
Betty (PS04B)              [1085] That is why that man said you will not get
                           any more special offers on a Fri Saturday night
                           because they can't sell it on a Sunday so you used
                           to see them selling things off on a Saturday five
                           o'clock.
                           [1086] No more.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [...]
Maggie (PS04G)             [1087] Because they're opening on a Sunday and
                           hoping that you'll go in
Betty (PS04B)              [1088] That's it.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [1089] Mm
Maggie (PS04G)             [1090] and buy.
Betty (PS04B)              [1091] So you won't be able to find out nothing
                           [...]
Betty (PS04B)              [1092] You won't forget that.
                           [1093] And I reckon they'll carry on down to
                           Christmas.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [1094] Well they reckon that the British Standard
                           people are going to have

              there's something in Littlewoods [...] and she's got money in her
              pocket and she's got a washing machine.

Sally (PS04H) [1110] That will be fine great brilliant.
Julie (PS04F) [1111] That's what she said.
              [1112] She said it's none of my business
Sally (PS04H) [1113] She wants washing machine [...]
Sally (PS04H) [1114] Because if I can I'd rather get it off her than get it out
              of our club because then I can get some Christmas presents out of
              their lot.
Julie (PS04F) [1115] Yeah.

              [1119] Well they just went back and said they couldn't want
              something that much ... maybe she's gone over her limit.
Julie (PS04F) [1120] Yeah.
              [1121] That's right.
              [1122] ... [...] gone over her limit and I'm not interested in
              her amount.

Julie (PS04F) [1137] It doesn't need to go out because I took that out.

Sally (PS04H)              [1150] I don't know.
Betty (PS04B)              [1151] Something to do with that bottom light [...]

                           happening ...
Betty (PS04B)              [1154] Stupid.

Betty (PS04B)              [1157] Oh great [...]
Sally (PS04H)              [1158] It just went off.
Betty (PS04B)              [1159] That's strange.
Julie (PS04F)              [1160] Don't know what it was.
Betty (PS04B)              [1161] Never known it to go off before.
Julie (PS04F)              [1162] No I've never known it to go off before
                           either.
Betty (PS04B)              [1163] Stupid.
Sally (PS04H)              [1164] I wouldn't worry about it anyway we're [...]
                           Oh it's the football pools.
Betty (PS04B)              [1165] I don't think we've done it.
Sally (PS04H)              [1166] Billy!
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [1167] Yeah.

Sally (PS04H)              [1170] Yes.
                           [1171] ... Here you are.
                           [1172] ... [door opening] [door closing] [...] all
                           you'd have had to get is all you'll have had to get
                           is an element.
                           [1173] That's the thing that so easy with electric
                           cookers is that you just have to buy the element.
                           [1174] So with that if one of them goes you just
                           have to buy that as an element just slot it it comes
                           ... it's like a light bulb.
Betty (PS04B)              [1175] Oh I see [...] take it out and
Sally (PS04H)              [1176] Slots slots out and you slot another one in.
Betty (PS04B)              [1177] Oh I see.
Sally (PS04H)              [1178] It's a lot easier with gas.
                           [1179] Our mum's several times her rings has gone on
                           her cooker she's had to buy a new element and she's
                           switched to gas.
Betty (PS04B)              [...]
Sally (PS04H)              [1180] And you've switched over to electric.
                           [1181] I'd rather have ... when it comes to safety
Betty (PS04B)              [1182] Gas cookers are [...]
Sally (PS04H)              [1183] When it comes to safety when it comes to
                           safety I would rather have an electric cooker.
Betty (PS04B)              [1184] But gas cooking is nice.
                           [1185] It tastes different.
                           [1186] It's nice.
                           [1187] But I suppose you've like [...] on I suppose
                           you've got used to it.
Sally (PS04H)              [1188] Yeah.
                           [1189] Now you've got used to it.
                           [1190] I mean you know how to cook with it now.
Betty (PS04B)              [1191] I didn't have this one when you come here did
                           I?
Sally (PS04H)              [1192] No
Betty (PS04B)              [1193] Or did I?
Sally (PS04H)              [1194] You had the old bleeding white gas cooker the
                           dangerous one.
                           [1195] It used to get
Betty (PS04B)              [1196] Yeah that's right .
Sally (PS04H)              [1197] they said sorry I not going to let anyone use
                           this.
Betty (PS04B)              [1198] Because we didn't know how long we've had it.
Sally (PS04H)              [1199] Oh.
                           [1200] Was it the council found it dangerous?
Betty (PS04B)              [1201] Yeah the gas man weren't it?
Sally (PS04H)              [1202] Yeah.
                           [1203] He said it's dangerous.
Betty (PS04B)              [1204] Yeah he said I should get my husband to
                           divorce it and chuck it

                           [1210] Because you had the old white one when I came
                           here.
                           [1211] And it was just over four years ago that I
                           came here.

Julie (PS04F) [1425] Yeah but ... if she was proper vegetarian she wouldn't eat
              cheese.
Sally (PS04H) [1426] Well if she was a vegan she wouldn't eat cheese.
              [1427] She can't eat cheese if you're a vegan.

Julie (PS04F) [1447] It looks like it's a really deep cut by looking at it now.
              [1448] It's sort of like open there.
              [1449] All it was first of all was a little graze on top of the
              skin.
Betty (PS04B) [1450] Mm.
Julie (PS04F) [1451] Because where I was making boxes it was pulling the skin
              and was torn apart wasn't it?
Betty (PS04B) [1452] Yeah it kept going there all the time.
              [1453] They do though don't it? ...

              [1457] And erm the next day I had er it was all white there
Betty (PS04B) [1458] Was it?
Julie (PS04F) [1459] and I took every little last bit out.
              [1460] But I never noticed it er
Betty (PS04B) [1461] Serious.
Julie (PS04F) [1462] It was not funny because what I did.
              [1463] I was cleaning out knives and the metal thing that goes
              over the knives there was something there and it was a nail and I
              just pushed and I caught it.
              [1464] So I took a nick out of my finger and ended up with [...]
              from the top of my finger.
Betty (PS04B) [1465] Mm.
              [1466] Nasty. [...] ...
Julie (PS04F) [1467] [...] blood enough goes over my fingers [...] cut his
              thumb and and all he did was just sort of bathed it put [...] on
              it.
              [1468] It was a deep cut [...] and ended up [...]
Betty (PS04B) [...]
Julie (PS04F) [1469] And a good cover up job.
              [1470] It didn't make it heal just good stuff [...] [laugh]

Julie (PS04F) [1474] [laugh] She was had on a full stomach.
              [1475] She had to do it before she ate anything.
              [1476] ... She said most of it was it wasn't the actual looking
              at the hole it was that she was hurting him ... pushing it in.
Betty (PS04B) [1477] Mm.
Julie (PS04F) [1478] And it weren't hurting him at all but it was making her
              feel sick thinking that she was hurting him like.
*** 10 (Tape 009110) ***
Julie (PS04F)              [1479] Dunno.
                           [1480] He just won't go. [...]

Julie (PS04F)              [1481] It being her first child [...] .
                           [1482] I don't know what I'd be like.
Betty (PS04B)              [...]
Julie (PS04F)              [1483] And he sleeps in a normal bed.
Betty (PS04B)              [1484] Do he?
                           [1485] Yes.
                           [1486] That's good for a baby.
Julie (PS04F)              [1487] He sleeps in a normal bed all right.
                           [1488] She was packing his stuff and I was bringing
                           him upstairs to his room like away from her like.
                           [1489] Like he knows she's in the house and he wants
                           to go wherever she goes.
                           [1490] But if she's not in the house it doesn't
                           worry him.
                           [1491] If he knows she's not there.
                           [1492] So I can go upstairs and put him in his
                           rocking chair.
Betty (PS04B)              [1493] [...] rocking chair.

                           [1496] And she said yeah.

                           [1498] I never knew a child of one could sleep in a

                           sort of try and climb up.
                           [1512] Well he climbed up the bloody first stair.

                           behind him like you know well it gives his legs a
                           bit more like movement.

                           [1745] Any rate Spark comes and Spark thinks like
                           Dave.
Betty (PS04B)              [1746] Ah!
Betty (PS04B)              [1747] So any rate me and Ann were looking and
                           Spark's fiddling about and he's making faces at Dave
                           see behind his back [laugh] .

                           [1749] He couldn't look at me and Ann cause we was
                           laughing [laugh] . [...]

Betty (PS04B)              [1755] [laugh] so Spark looked up at Tony and said
                           you sure you're a fucking fitter.
                           [1756] [laugh] And [...] he played with all the
                           knobs.
Julie (PS04F)              [1757] We keep saying that to Steve if he can't
                           figure out something me and Marie look up and say

Betty (PS04B)              [1759] Cos Dave was there trying to do a fiddle.
                           [1760] With all the buttons and all the knobs see.
                           [1761] And I looked up at Dave and said here Dave
                           and he said what?
                           [1762] Is that right that you were a security guard
                           before you were made up to reception manager.
                           [1763] Yeah.
                           [1764] I said I'm glad you weren't a fucking fitter
                           then.
                           [1765] Oh that was it.
                           [1766] Ann was screaming wasn't she.
                           [1767] She nearly fall down on her face.
Betty (PS04B)              [1768] Oh my gawd what a night you had!
Betty (PS04B)              [1769] It's what this what I said to Dave.
                           [1770] I said oh you've got Sally with you next week
                           haven't you Dave?
Betty (PS04B)              [1771] Oh! [laugh]
Betty (PS04B)              [1772] He said Yeah.
                           [1773] I said I feel sorry for you.
                           [1774] He just started laughing.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [1775] [...] every day.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [1776] Gotta learn about [...] haven't we [...] .
                           [1777] So I've got me jeans on and the first word I
                           says to him is so why have you shaved your moustache
                           off Dave?
                           [1778] Because your hair [...]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [laugh]
Betty (PS04B)              [1779] The best crack though was when he come
                           doubled back short Friday and designer stubble round
                           here.
                           [1780] He hadn't shaved.
                           [1781] Dave always shaves unless he got up late like
                           so he started whingeing at me and Ann because we got
                           our jeans on.
                           [1782] I said here Dave and he said what?
                           [1783] [...] I'll have you [...] .

                           window up.

                           nagged so much that she had to let him go.

Julie (PS04F)              [2152] Did Lorraine come out or stayed in there?
Betty (PS04B)              [2153] Stayed in there and I thought what
Julie (PS04F)              [2154] She's probably embarrassed as you are.
                           [2155] And she's probably embarrassed as you are
                           [...]
Betty (PS04B)              [2156] I'm all right with when he's talking to her.
                           [2157] But I feel stupid
Betty (PS04B)              [2158] Cos I went in this morning I'd better [...]
                           on the piss last night.
                           [2159] He left his car in the car park see?
Julie (PS04F)              [2160] Well if they do it again you should say come
                           in and have a cup of tea .
Betty (PS04B)              [2161] And I looked in and thought I wonder if
                           that's Clayton in there or not.
                           [2162] I'm going to walk in anyway.
                           [2163] So I walked in and she went oh morning love.
                           [2164] And I went do you want a cup of tea.
                           [2165] And she said oh yeah I said tea or coffee.
                           [2166] Tea'll do.
                           [2167] Put's the kettle on.
                           [2168] I thought I'd better make a cup of coffee
                           [...] .
                           [2169] So I went in and asked her if she wants a
                           smoke.
                           [2170] Give her a smoke.
                           [2171] She said what's this?
                           [2172] I said Wills.
                           [2173] Oh I don't that.
                           [2174] I'll smoke my own.
                           [2175] So at any rate then please yourself.
                           [2176] [whispering] she was smoking like that [] so
                           I made her a cup of tea took it in and put it on the
                           stool.
                           [2177] I said I'm going back now do you want me to
                           leave the kitchen light on?
                           [2178] No.
                           [2179] All right turn it off. [laugh] .

Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2184] [...] cup of tea.
Julie (PS04F)              [2185] Coming in for a cup of tea?
Betty (PS04B)              [2186] I'd feel so embarrassed.
Julie (PS04F)              [2187] She probably feels as embarrassed as you do
                           Bet.
                           [2188] ... And she always stays in that [...] .
Betty (PS04B)              [2189] I know.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2190] She doesn't come out?
Betty (PS04B)              [2191] No. ...
Julie (PS04F)              [2192] I said to Sally I said I wouldn't be
                           surprised if they two get married.
                           [2193] I wouldn't be surprised.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2194] [...] big plans to buy Christmas presents
                           [laugh] shudder. [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2195] About one hundred of them.
Betty (PS04B)              [2196] Hmm.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2197] Second children.
Betty (PS04B)              [2198] Yeah.
                           [2199] As you say.
                           [2200] So they're second partners and their Mum and
                           Dad.
Julie (PS04F)              [2201] Boy you think
Betty (PS04B)              [2202] Ten grand kids
Julie (PS04F)              [2203] You think what my Aunty Carol's got to buy
                           for.
                           [2204] Now out of the family of family
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2205] Oh don't talk to me.
Julie (PS04F)              [2206] [...] included there are about ten.
Betty (PS04B)              [2207] Ann's got a [...] head on ain't she?
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2208] Why?
Betty (PS04B)              [2209] Her sister ... I think put her [...] .
                           [2210] Was moaning about she had to buy three
                           Christmas presents and she only got two kids ... So
                           Ann turned round and said oh you're fucking well mad
                           I got to buy five presents and I've only got two
                           kids.
                           [2211] And she said not only that whenever my kids
                           babysit for you you only give em a fiver each.
                           [2212] Oh she had to buy five presents and she only
                           had two kids.
                           [2213] That's right.
                           [2214] And Ann said well if you going to fucking be
                           like that don't bother to buy my kids anything.
                           [2215] I won't buy your kids anything.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2216] Yeah.
Betty (PS04B)              [2217] She says and I will spent that extra couple
                           of quid on my kids.
                           [2218] So said if you're going to be like that be
                           like that.
                           [2219] So she said don't you fucking worry I am.
Betty (PS04B)              [2220] Yeah.
Betty (PS04B)              [2221] She said bollocks on you lot for Christmas.
                           [2222] I ain't buying nothing.
                           [2223] Oh she said oh you spent money on the shirts
                           for the kids.
Edna (PS04K)               [2224] That's it you can't [...] these days
Julie (PS04F)              [2225] The kids come first isn't it ?
Betty (PS04B)              [2226] Well they were going with their [...] at the
                           beginning of the year up for register and they're
                           catching up on it now.
Edna (PS04K)               [2227] Oh.
                           [2228] That's it.
                           [2229] I mean we've got kids and the kids got to
                           come first and the adults come second
Betty (PS04B)              [2230] like Ann said .
                           [2231] It's all right for them because their kids
                           can go on holiday with them so they've got no
                           problems.
                           [2232] But because their kids can't go abroad [...]
                           then they get a letter through to say like you know
                           they are going on camp would they be interested.
                           [2233] Of course Ann sends off and says yeah.
                           [2234] But that's three hundred pounds for them to
                           fit the bill.
Betty (PS04B)              [2235] Oh yeah!
Betty (PS04B)              [2236] Hundred and fifty pound each.
                           [2237] That's a fortnight mind.
Betty (PS04B)              [2238] Yeah.
Betty (PS04B)              [2239] And that's everything.
                           [2240] That's all their spending money involved and
                           their day trips off the lot.
                           [2241] She's got no worries.
                           [2242] ... Her and her old man stays at home and has
                           a fortnight together.
                           [2243] Then they go at camping school or whatever
                           wherever the school's going.
                           [2244] The kids do that.
                           [2245] And then they go on holiday with Ann and the
                           old man.
                           [2246] And when they go on holiday with Ann and the
                           old man they used to get through a hundred pounds a
                           day and they go for a week.
                           [2247] That's seven hundred pounds like sometimes
                           more.
                           [2248] But she said I don't mind because I would
                           like to take my boat but I can't.
                           [2249] When we went abroad I know we've spent three
                           or four grand when we're over there with the holiday
                           as well like you know.
                           [2250] She said so it's got to be done really she
                           said and I feel so sorry for them she says because
                           even when they get older they still won't be able to
                           go abroad.
Betty (PS04B)              [2251] Yeah.
Edna (PS04K)               [2252] Well I mean I don't see why they
Betty (PS04B)              [2253] And they've had so many operations
Edna (PS04K)               [2254] I can't see why they can't go on a camping
                           holiday in France.
                           [2255] I mean they can go on the ferry.
                           [2256] Take the car out there.
                           [2257] They've got their own car.
Betty (PS04B)              [2258] Yeah but they go to somewhere bloody they go
                           to the same place every year and they have a real
                           good time.
                           [2259] And she says might just as well be with the
                           kids like so.
                           [2260] She ain't really worried.
                           [2261] She says the only trouble is when they get
                           older
Julie (PS04F)              [2262] I mean I am ... I mean I'm quite surprised
                           that your floor.
                           [2263] Whatever floor that Ann's been on hasn't done
                           something like put some money in so that they can
                           take em somewhere else something like over in France
                           or something like that.
Betty (PS04B)              [2264] She wouldn't accept it .
Betty (PS04B)              [2265] She's not that type is she ?
Betty (PS04B)              [2266] She'd say don't be silly [...] . [laugh]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2267] Simple isn't she?
Betty (PS04B)              [2268] [...] [laugh] and they don't want nothing for
                           their kids.
Betty (PS04B)              [2269] She puts them first don't she?
Betty (PS04B)              [2270] Oh yeah.
                           [2271] Whatever they want they gets.
Betty (PS04B)              [2272] [...] my darling please?
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2273] She bought them a telly.
Julie (PS04F)              [2274] I reckon they should have next year a long
                           weekend
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2275] Purple [...]
Betty (PS04B)              [2276] All that money in your pocket haven't you?
                           [2277] Let's have a look .
David (PS04J)              [2278] There covers
Julie (PS04F)              [2279] Even if they all go in bed and breakfast and
                           take them two kids to Euro Disney.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2280] She erm [...] little T V each.
                           [2281] It was T V between them.
                           [2282] So many hours and so many nights and [...] .
                           [2283] But I would have bought them one each.
David (PS04J)              [...]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2284] Yeah.
Betty (PS04B)              [2285] But they're only having one big present each
                           this year.
                           [2286] And that's it.
Betty (PS04B)              [2287] That's it.
                           [2288] Yeah .
David (PS04J)              [...]
Julie (PS04F)              [2289] Yeah I know.
                           [2290] I'd go mad.
Betty (PS04B)              [2291] She said that fucking last year I said.
Betty (PS04B)              [2292] What's the girl [...] ?
Betty (PS04B)              [2293] No.
                           [2294] Boy thirteen and a girl eleven.
Betty (PS04B)              [2295] Oh.
Betty (PS04B)              [2296] Or twelve that's either two years or a year
                           between them.
                           [2297] And don't fight.
Betty (PS04B)              [2298] No?
                           [2299] Of course boy and a girl don't [...]
Betty (PS04B)              [2300] They only argue.
                           [2301] They don't fight they only argue but they
                           can't fight cause of their ears.
                           [2302] And I think the boy suffers from asthma as
                           well.
Julie (PS04F)              [2303] Well there you are.
                           [2304] It's different with a boy and a girl cos
David (PS04J)              [2305] You got your washing out mind you.
Betty (PS04B)              [2306] Because when
David (PS04J)              [2307] You been out there?
Betty (PS04B)              [2308] Her boy went out on this work experience
                           thing for his school like.
                           [2309] He must be older than thirteen.
                           [2310] He must be fourteen .
Betty (PS04B)              [2311] He must be fourteen hmm .
Betty (PS04B)              [2312] Yeah.
Betty (PS04B)              [2313] Anyway they paid him I told you didn't I?
                           [2314] They paid him and the reason they ain't going
                           to have nobody back there any more back to this firm
                           cos [...] safety rules.
                           [2315] And erm she was saying that when he was there
                           a bloke come round start giving them a little
                           verbal.
                           [2316] She'd never had nothing in his ears to
                           protect his ears.
                           [2317] So he's shouting it the boy like.
                           [2318] And of course the old man was there and he
                           come over and grabbed the bloke by the throat and he
                           said don't you ever shout at my son like that again.
                           [2319] Course he was frightened to death weren't he
                           [...] .
                           [2320] And he said well he should know better than
                           to [...] blah blah blah
Betty (PS04B)              [2321] Hmm
Betty (PS04B)              [2322] He said my son's fucking deaf you idiot.
                           [2323] Well well that is why he don't need to put
                           anything in his ears.
                           [2324] Because he can't hear nothing stupid.
                           [2325] Well he's still have to put it in his ears.
                           [2326] You're going to put your fucking eyes out.
Betty (PS04B)              [2327] Hmm.
                           [2328] I bet he got all upset.
Betty (PS04B)              [2329] Well everybody knew when they're up.
                           [2330] [...] daft anyway and nine times out of ten
                           you've got to look at him and speak to him and that
                           because he can't understand and er bloke gave him
                           the verbal.
                           [2331] He was nearly crying wasn't he.
Betty (PS04B)              [2332] Ah!
Betty (PS04B)              [2333] We didn't know what to say.
Betty (PS04B)              [2334] It's got to be tumble dried.
Betty (PS04B)              [2335] He didn't know he had to give him a little
                           verbal back.

Julie (PS04F)              [2369] It's either that or there's not a lot about.
                           [2370] If there's not a lot there then they won't
                           put the price tags down.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [cough]
Julie (PS04F)              [2371] But if they're got a lot they will.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2372] Well I mean well I don't mean [...] you'll

Betty (PS04B)              [2389] And chocolates all round like.
Edna (PS04K)               [2390] I'd like [...] we had more Cadbury's in
                           Birmingham once.
                           [2391] I'm going back years.
                           [2392] I'm going back a bit there [...] .
Julie (PS04F)              [2393] Well they had tea coffee and sandwiches
                           cakes.
                           [2394] They had fruit juices for kids [...] .
                           [2395] Now I got one lot of fruit juices and I said
                           to [...] go and get some more [...] and there were
                           six empty on the thing then I chucked them in and
                           then there were another six empty like.
Edna (PS04K)               [2396] I suppose you can get can you get so many up
                           [...] you can in a lot of places can't you?
David (PS04J)              [2397] No I know you used to have a price.
Julie (PS04F)              [2398] But it worked out that they spent twenty
                           thousand pounds on letting families go round for
                           these three weeks.
Betty (PS04B)              [2399] It would be better to
Edna (PS04K)               [2400] [...] they didn't have the machinery like you
                           got.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2401] No it was all hands all done by hand no
                           automation.
Edna (PS04K)               [2402] Yeah yeah.
                           [2403] And the villages all round there are pretty
                           out there.
Julie (PS04F)              [2404] Ours ours can't be done automated.
Betty (PS04B)              [2405] That's right.
Julie (PS04F)              [2406] You can't have a computer put the eggs in the
                           pans because it's got to be it's got to be done
                           manually by a worker.
Edna (PS04K)               [2407] Yeah but chocolate's got so expens
Julie (PS04F)              [2408] My dad's [...] he didn't understand before he
                           seen the mini eggs why they're so dear.
Betty (PS04B)              [2409] There's a lot of work there.
Julie (PS04F)              [2410] It takes thirty two hours before they can be
                           packed.
                           [2411] They got to be stored for thirty two hours.
                           [2412] It takes so long.
                           [2413] So basically all they're saying it takes
                           thirty two hours to do one egg.
Betty (PS04B)              [2414] Yeah.
Julie (PS04F)              [2415] As with Double Decker it can take the most
                           two hours Crunchie takes the most two hours
Edna (PS04K)               [2416] As with Crunchie [...] are there no Crunchies
                           there now?
Julie (PS04F)              [2417] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2418] There were Crunchies yesterday.
Betty (PS04B)              [2419] No no it weren't yesterday.

David (PS04J)              [...]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2423] Loose one you mean?

Julie (PS04F)              [2426] I went.
David (PS04J)              [2427] There weren't any loose one.
Julie (PS04F)              [2428] Thursday morning there was packs of Crunchies
Edna (PS04K)               [2429] No I don't
Betty (PS04B)              [2430] I likes a Crunchie.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2431] I don't mind a Crunchie.
Betty (PS04B)              [2432] It's light isn't it?
                           [2433] It doesn't stick in your gob [laugh]
Julie (PS04F)              [2434] I likes a Crunchie [...]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2435] I's eat all the chocolate first and the
                           inside afterwards
Julie (PS04F)              [2436] More than that now though.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2437] Oh aye.
                           [2438] Yeah but you can buy it [...]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [...]
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2439] You could buy it in a penny packet bloody
                           great [...]
Julie (PS04F)              [2440] I used to get a lot of it when I was in
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2441] And it used to be dark brown.
                           [2442] It used to be darker than [...] bloody [...]
                           .
Betty (PS04B)              [2443] They made it different then didn't they?
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2444] Mm.
Betty (PS04B)              [2445] It's bloody mass produced now isn't it?
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2446] So before my work out this morning I said to
                           Joe he's in the bathroom.
                           [2447] Done Joe's bedroom and er the Hoover was up
                           there the dusters was up there so I thought shall I
                           shall I.
                           [2448] No I've got dinner before one and I thought
                           well
Julie (PS04F)              [2449] Well
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2450] [...] properly
Julie (PS04F)              [2451] with Crunchie right?
                           [2452] They set on a big conveyor belt.
                           [2453] There's got to be about eight foot wide and
                           er
Betty (PS04B)              [2454] I'd seen that being done on the telly the
                           other night. [...]
Julie (PS04F)              [2455] A hundred and fifty degrees C that's what it
                           comes out at.
                           [2456] Right and it goes like these great funnels
                           spread it [...] Now as it goes down it gets caught
                           down.
                           [2457] And when it gets cut.
                           [2458] It's got cut like boiling hot oil a laser of
                           oil.
Betty (PS04B)              [2459] Oh oh.
Julie (PS04F)              [2460] And we got told now I didn't know this.
                           [2461] We got told that that laser of oil can cut
                           through concrete just like that.
                           [2462] Just as quick as it goes through a Crunchie.
Unknown speaker (KBEPSUNK) [2463] Bloody hell.
Julie (PS04F)              [2464] So they have so much problems with it like
                           they'll never ever experiment with that again.
                           [2465] They'll keep it for Crunchie but never use it
                           for anything else again because they've had so much
                           trouble with it.
Betty (PS04B)              [2466] Blimey!
