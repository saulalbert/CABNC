*PS18H:	That 's right .  1390690_1391500
*PS18L:	To achieve this quality assurance should mean that when the patient feels his care is not good he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately And that 's these things here There 's patient questionnaires complaints da da er ba la visitor inspections complaints patient questionnaire there 's a basically all the same kind of thing or relative survey Patient questionnaire So basically what they 're saying there 's all these things that they 'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care is n't right he knows what channels to go through to complain My criticism of that being is .  1391510_1430770
*PS18L:	But what if it 's not carried out .  1430770_1432750
*PS18L:	it 's it 's al the quality 's not there to start with How can you .  1432800_1435850
*PS18J:	He da he wo n't know what what quality of care is though .  1435850_1439070

*PS18L:	he expects good nursing care .  1442200_1443940
*PS18J:	But his views are n't really gon na be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people would n't know .  1443940_1448000
*PS18L:	No everybody 's individual And to get what it says here to get quality assurance the patient 's views and the care-giver 's views have to be in agreement What say you 're the care-giver and I 'm the .  1448010_1457470
*PS18J:	Yeah .  1457470_1457590
*PS18L:	patient what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care .  1457590_1461160
*PS18J:	But what you know is not gon na be the same .  1461160_1462500
*PS18L:	It has to be the same for quality assurance .  1462550_1463180
*PS18J:	But it 's not gon na be the same .  1463180_1464890

*PS18L:	Yeah cos you .  1465170_1466490
*PS18M:	I tell you what I think .  1466490_1467160

*PS18E:	I sha n't ask anything .  1475360_1478500
*PS18M:	But will it tell me the truth .  1478500_1479840
*PS18H:	Well see for one is she 's not erm as bad as that You know some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital .  1479840_1490080
*PS18L:	Mm .  1490080_1490170
*PS18H:	and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them but it 's not If you 're taking all .  1490330_1495570

*PS18L:	0 . 
*PS18H:	busy and they 're angels and they 're that and the other that they wo n't complain .  1500850_1504620
*PS18L:	Well that 's the only way that this can be assessed is by so that the patient blah blah la when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry But complaining I mean if he 's got ta complain it means that quality assurance is n't there .  1504620_1520310
*PS18J:	But .  1520310_1520710
*PS18L:	This is only thing if they 've got something to complain about .  1520710_1523860
*PS18J:	if you were the patient nurse .  1523860_1526000
*PS18H:	So there 's nothing to actually say .  1526000_1527240

*PS18H:	So if it .  1530100_1530510
*PS18L:	says .  1530510_1530600
*PS18H:	Yeah .  1530600_1530660
*PS18L:	erm meaning ha blah blah and action taken It should also mean that when Mr that 's it says the nurses were marvellous the nurses are able to say in all evidence and with evidence to support their opinion yes .  1530660_1543394
*PS18E:	We were crap .  1543394_1544264

*PS18L:	0 . 
*PS18E:	But like if you take like .  1552324_1553604
*PS18E:	0 . 
*PS18E:	like er le let me if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse like you would n't have a clue whether it was er .  1553604_1560184
*PS18H:	Exactly .  1560744_1560814
*PS18E:	good or not because as long as it was pretty clean .  1560814_1562734
*PS18L:	Let's have a look what examples they 're using .  1562734_1564364
*KBUPSUN:	0 . 
*PS18H:	Well that 's what I was trying to say because all the patient does n't know what to expect anyway .  1564364_1570384
*PS18L:	I mean the patient would n't know whether it was like clean .  1570384_1572544
*PS18L:	Well these are the criteria leaves for tests and investigations for tests and investigations for example good facilities up-to-date working equipment nice staff competent qualified staff .  1572544_1579474
*PS18M:	Well I 'm not nice .  1579474_1582274
*PS18L:	written and verbal information appropriate tests no complications But not necessarily the procedure itself If you if you were the patient you might say it 's wrong because erm she does n't look like she knows what she 's doing or there 's a mistake or something gets missed .  1582274_1596374
*PS18E:	Yeah .  1596374_1596424
*PS18L:	You know .  1596424_1597444
*PS18M:	But I mean on that well I think it 's .  1597934_1601014
*PS18E:	Well I think the whole point of it is .  1601014_1602834
*PS18M:	erm the patient 's not gon na know that I 'm first of all not gon na know anything about nurses .  1602834_1607924
*KBUPSUN:	Yeah .  1607924_1608014
*PS18M:	Because he did n't he stayed cos they class him as an A person .  1608134_1613284
*PS18L:	And he might take a personal dislike to one of nurses .  1613284_1615604
*PS18L:	Yeah .  1616234_1616504
*PS18E:	They can only evaluate the care that they 've had .  1616644_1619644
*KBUPSUN:	0 . 
*PS18E:	ca n't they At the end of their stay Whether they they feel they feel better and whether that 's because the nurses have done a good job or not .  1619644_1626554

*PS18M:	Yeah .  1633124_1633174
*PS18E:	things in question .  1633284_1635204

*PS18M:	list right .  1655774_1655894
*PS18L:	Mm .  1655894_1656144
*PS18M:	That 's one thing here will get them in and out but I 've spoken to patients who say they do n't get the care here and on the surface it looks a brilliant hospital it gets them in and out you know it does everything it 's got all the facilities but it does n't give them the care .  1656154_1670854
*PS18L:	Mm I think the biggest .  1670854_1672784
*PS18E:	0 .

*PS18M:	That 's right .  1673494_1674404
*PS18L:	it says quality can only be assured if both patient 's view and care-giver 's view are in agreement cos that 's gon na be really hard to achieve is n't it .  1674404_1680604
*KBUPSUN:	Yeah .  1680604_1680864
*PS18L:	Where 's it say that Make sure I 've written it down .  1680864_1683734
*PS18E:	Yes but quality does n't just co erm take into account the care that 's given it takes into erm what equipment you 've got on whether th er the equipment 's used properly .  1683734_1691594
*PS18H:	I mean but that that is what I was pointing out and we have some say you have somebody qualified to go and visit each patient .  1692124_1709244

*PS18E:	my article 's about raising the standards of health care in the hospitals It 's all the same really And it it looks upon nurses feel about their own standard of care and the article then goes on about .  1759694_1775134
*PS18E:	Standard they provide .  1776014_1777434
*PS18E:	standard they provide for .  1777434_1778304
*PS18E:	Mm .  1778374_1778744
*PS18E:	the patients And then the it goes on about setting up the single but dynamic standards a setting system it 's called divided into local level groups like a tier system you get the Managing Director on the top and the ones at the bottom And they 're called quality assurance or standard setting teams made up of volunteers .  1778744_1798354
*PS18E:	0 . 
*PS18E:	from the local wards The main base made up of volunteers from the local wards like nurses and well I mean nurses and auxiliaries like that But it 's bring it says things about care and assessing that quality care 's being met on their ward and the hospital itself and about once every six months to meet up with .  1798354_1826174
*PS18E:	0 . 
*PS18E:	other hos members of other hospitals in the area and discuss different aspects of raising the standards of care .  1826214_1833254
*KBUPSUG:	0 . 
*PS18E:	And the introduction about about care is passed up the three tiers like a triangular system 's .  1834144_1843174
*PS18L:	Mm .  1843294_1843384
*PS18E:	passed up a three tier system And if the ideas are good then er incorporated into the care they 're incorporated into the hospital 's manifesto if you want if you like But there 's one one fault really it takes approximately fifteen to eighteen months for them to pass anything like that and that could be one .  1843384_1862574
*PS18E:	Downfall .  1862714_1863054
*PS18E:	downfall one criticism about .  1863324_1865184
*PS18M:	Yeah cos this one says it 's immediate .  1865184_1869834
*PS18E:	Yeah Well this one takes fifteen to eighteen months and that 's to me that 's just ridiculous really .  1869994_1874914
*PS18E:	And then it would take another however to implement any changes that they decided upon .  1874914_1881114
*PS18L:	Basically they they just provide the ideas which get passed .  1881114_1885344
*PS18E:	They provide the er .  1885344_1886904
*PS18L:	to the top of the ladder .  1886904_1888094
*PS18E:	That 's it .  1888094_1888254
*PS18L:	and then .  1888254_1888624
*PS18E:	And they 're the ones in the situation so they get pa they 're the ones who are actually on the ward at the bottom and then pass it up It 's like .  1888624_1893674
*KBUPSUN:	Yeah .  1893674_1893874
*PS18E:	being in parliament really you have to pass everything up .  1893874_1895694
*PS18E:	Well the thing is though people at the top do n't necessarily see the problems that you see as problems .  1895694_1899124
