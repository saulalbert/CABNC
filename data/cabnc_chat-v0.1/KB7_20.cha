*ANN:	Oh  boys on it. •135582_143472•
*STU:	Well here are, one, two, three on the bounce and I thought well  you know that's a fairly good start, jack, queen, king  king high was a bit dodgy    you never know do you? •143472_172142•
*ANN:	Oh I've got a handful of bloody  pairs here, wait a minute  got I've only got three  feels like a bloody handful of them! •172142_185522•

*STU:	Is that what you're playing? •203202_208602•
*ANN:	Well I have to, I ain't got nothing else. •208602_213922•
*STU:	Three fours  eight, nine, ten  queen high  the pairs stuck at the end though dear. •213922_221922•
*ANN:	Oh   not one flush. •221922_224162•
*STU:	Must of been  •225522_226012•
*ANN:	Yeah but then it split the bloody pairs all in bits. •226272_228762•
*STU:	Yeah, I know, I know  yes. •233412_236142•
*ANN:	Couldn't make a lot with that , could I really? •236142_238292•
*STU:	Not really no. •238292_242932•
*ANN:	there for three pairs which was just as well I stopped you on the last one. •250632_268732•
*STU:	Ooh! •273892_274152•
        Ooh! •274562_275252•

*ANN:	Oh I want card for run   and I bet I can't bloody do owt with this lot. •278642_284772•
*STU:	No neither can I. •286162_290172•
*ANN:	Can't even  bloody hell! •292572_299822•
        Ain't got eight  ha ha. •300022_307362•
*STU:	Nope  No how's it going? •307362_313392•
*ANN:	I don't bloody know  how to play ! •314112_316052•
*STU:	Wanna play one, two, three, four, five, six and  haven't you? •320962_325132•
*ANN:	Yes. •325252_325782•
*STU:	Or five six seven and  that's what you wanna do innit? •325982_335432•
*ANN:	Oh yeah. •335502_335962•
*STU:	No  no I wouldn't do that  I always do it like this  if I was playing that hand  three well you could go well  you got a choice  you can go  take a chance on your last hand, not getting through  or  you can go two, three, five, six, seven  two three four, ace  finish them  which is what I'd probably do. •335962_358062•
*ANN:	Oh I didn't see that, oh  •359082_360132•
*STU:	One more try •360132_360952•
*ANN:	I didn't see that love •361172_363002•
*STU:	three queens  jack flush  ace high, so I mean you wouldn't get any it anyway. •363002_368362•
*ANN:	I didn't see that last flush, I couldn't , I couldn't sort them out. •368362_371522•
*STU:	Yeah but I mean it's  it makes you one, two, three, you wouldn't of had a one two three to start with  •371792_375402•
*ANN:	I know that  •375402_375832•
*STU:	but you had a eight  to finish with which is  finishing  and a one, two, three  might not be  and a  better run  so  I think I would have been tempted to finish with the ace flush there  try and stop me rather than trying to win it  cos you had nothing else did you? •375972_395222•
        No  you didn't have  you didn't have a finishing hand, you didn't really have a brilliant first two hands  and then the pick of the one, two, three bouncer  I might  I might have been persuaded to play the one, two, three bouncer and hope that that got through  but to finish with an ace flush  but good. •395262_438942•
*ANN:	Oh I don't know  I ain't got nothing. •439072_442632•
*STU:	Neither have I. •447512_450912•
