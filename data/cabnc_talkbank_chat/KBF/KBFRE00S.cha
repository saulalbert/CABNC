*PS04Y:	Mm .  867765_867865
*PS04U:	They just honestly could n't believe that .  867865_869165
*PS04Y:	Yeah .  869165_869395
*PS04U:	somebody could be like that .  869435_870345
*PS04Y:	But some people are appallingly mean did I tell you about that Ned being done out of six hundred pounds by an indian doctor and a her husband .  870345_878185
*PS04U:	No .  879525_879635
*PS04Y:	He put in a kitchen and he thought there was something funny about these people erm they did n't want to give him money up front for the fabric you know the woods and things and he was n't asking the full amount anyway and he said you know a things are very tight in business and I do not want to run up any more debts if you will let me have some of cash some of the cash fo for the wood as soon as the wood 's delivered I 'll come and do the job it 's not as though your money is going to be tied up in any way and there was a bit of a face pulling and saw this woman drop to sort of always hovering around always putting her motty in and erm when th when the job was nearly completed madam steps forward with the cries of that is n't quite right and that is n't quite right and Nev was putting hours doing nit-picking fussing about getting things absolutely perfect got it absolutely perfect but when it came to the final bill they knocked off six hundred because there was the tiniest little scratch on one of the panels .  879635_954565
*PS04U:	Oh he could n't do anything about it .  955385_958295
*PS04Y:	No it was fi it was fixed in .  958295_959385
*PS04U:	Perhaps they 're fiddling .  961495_963465

*PS04U:	a bit 0 . 
*PS04Y:	Yes .  963835_963925

*PS04Y:	Six hundred yes .  970095_970825
*PS04U:	Did he not sort of think to take them to court I suppose it would have cost him more in court fees .  971795_974925
*PS04Y:	Well I think he can go through the small claims court for five hundred but I suppose six hundred was just over it 's probably something very crafty that they thought up between them this pair .  974925_987265
*PS04U:	It 's awful is n't it .  989405_990425
*PS04Y:	T is awful I was taught as a child in catechism the labourer is worthy of his hire there are four sins that cry out to heaven for justice one of them is a oppressing the widow and orphan and the other is defrauding the labourer of his hire because the labourer is worthy of his hire that 's a sin that cries to heaven for justice that 's what I was taught as a child .  990425_1017435
*PS04U:	I bet he was really sort of angry .  1017955_1019535
*PS04Y:	Oh they were they felt sick .  1019535_1021085
*PS04U:	But the er it 's does he still see them or .  1022295_1024895
*PS04Y:	Oh no I mean the these were clients and they could never be friends after doing that I 've come to the conclusion you can either keep your money or you can keep your friends but you 're not going to do both .  1024895_1035265
*PS04U:	No .  1035425_1035485
*PS04Y:	In life .  1036715_1037165
*PS04U:	Right shall we make tracks .  1038005_1039115
