*TON:	Yeah. (.) . Make us some tea okay?
*JAC:	Okay.
*TON:	No the course went alright today.
*JAC:	Good.Are they a reasonably nice group?
*TON:	Mm.
*JAC:	They're not, you haven't got any troublemakers?
*TON:	No.One or two a bit odd.
*JAC:	A bit odd!
*TON:	But they're alright.
*JAC:	What do you mean a bit odd?
*TON:	Erm   (.) there's one girl who's a bit erm
*JAC:	Weird?Define odd   ((laugh)) 
*TON:	Er   (.) She's very   (.) very sure of herself.
*JAC:	Oh one of those. (        ) 
*TON:	But she's wrong. ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	Yeah.Oh well I'm sure you can knock her into shape.
*TON:	Oh yeah. (.)  (        ) say 
*JAC:	Find it a bit easier now you've done   (        ) three as well?
*TON:	I, I feel more confident, yeah.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	I just sort of say   (.) no, er  ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	Yeah. (.) . Must turn that radio off.It's driving me nuts actually.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	You can have too much of a good thing.
*TON:	Or a bad thing as the case may be.
*JAC:	Yeah.I've been listening to it   (.) for a while.
*TON:	Mhm.
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*TON:	I've got a   (.) oh I've got a carol practice tomorrow.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	So I'm not gonna be able to get to the building society until Wednesday.
*JAC:	Well that's their tough luck.It's their mistake.
*TON:	Yeah okay.
*JAC:	So
*TON:	So long as you feel like that.
*JAC:	I'm not that brokenhearted and I'm, no I'm annoyed.Does the standing order form say what day of the month it's to be taken out on?Do you have to fill that in? (.) On the such and such day of the month innit?
*TON:	Don't think it does. (.) Cos I filled it all out and I don't remember having to   (.) if there had been anything like that I'd have asked you about it.
*JAC:	No I'm fed up with them.This is twice now they've done this to us.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	You know.They
*TON:	Yeah.Well I'll go in and see them and sort it out. (.) But
*JAC:	Only I've got a horrible feeling   (        ) if it's 
*TON:	not until Wednesday 
*JAC:	not done   (.) by now 
*TON:	It won't be right this month either.
*JAC:	It won't be right this month either, but if that's the case
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	we can write an extra cheque.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	You know?
*TON:	That's right.
*JAC:	But I'd rather if you didn't mind that you did go in and sort it out cos she said   (.) well put a cheque in the envelope with the standing order form but I mean
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) That's just   (.) they've already   (.) putting it frankly cocked it up once.
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Another opportunity for them to do it again.
*TON:	That's right. (.) 
*JAC:	What cheque!
*TON:	Yeah.I didn't see a cheque!
*JAC:	There wasn't a ch , just a standing order form, that's all we got.You know?
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	 [shouting] Cheque number blah blah blah   [] written on
*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	It doesn't make any difference, it's just   (.) you know   (.) hassle.
*TON:	Yeah. (.) 
*JAC:	This skirt is horrible. (.) I was keeping it for cleaning the car.And I'm having to resort to
*TON:	Oh. (.) 
*JAC:	 (        ) some paint splashes  (        ) . (.) I'm looking forward to our tour round the chocolate factory next Wednesday.
*TON:	Yeah it'll be nice.
*JAC:	Be interesting.
*TON:	Next Wednesday?
*JAC:	Yeah.Erm 
*TON:	Right.
*JAC:	We'll go out and see Auntie Bettie before then.So
*TON:	Mm.I'm not in class next Wednesday.
*JAC:	Oh great. (.) The only fly in the ointment is if it starts at seven, it's going to be a bit of a rush.Cos you don't usually get home until ten to six.
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	And after all the fuss that's been going on in work I don't really like to ask to go early.
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	If you see what I mean.
*TON:	Mhm.
*JAC:	But. (.) 
*TON:	I got two Helens in the group.
*JAC:	Oh that's nice.Helen, yes yes  ((laugh)) .
*TON:	Luckily they've sat themselves on opposite sides of the room.
*JAC:	Oh that's good.So you look at one.
*TON:	Yeah.So I can look at one and say Helen?
*JAC:	When they sit together you've got problems.
*TON:	Yeah!Fine.
*JAC:	Er.
