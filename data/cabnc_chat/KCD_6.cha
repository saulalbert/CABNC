*UNK:	Right I think that Salisbury's is probably the best place for a back pack do you. •225842_229032•
*CLA:	Shall we go there first? •229032_230212•
*HEL:	Yes. •231502_231712•
        Do you want a new washing bag and a salon to take with you or are you not bothered? •231762_238972•
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Mm? •241212_241302•
*CLA:	I've got plenty. •241302_241972•
*AMY:	You can't take mine. •242142_245502•
*HEL:	You can't have Amy's. •245942_246872•
        You've only got the one. •247632_248682•
        What? •248922_249172•
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Oh nothing. •249722_250782•
        I just thought you'd like a new one. •250912_252512•
        Oh right. •255442_255842•
        In that case. •257082_257792•
*CLA:	All we've got to have is •257792_261292•
*HEL:	Well I certainly wouldn't bother taking any shampoo if you can't have a hair drier. •261382_265892•
*CLA:	Well Charlie'll have to so we can all wash our hair. •271672_276082•
*HEL:	Well Charlie's not going. •276082_279102•
        Why is hers very long •279172_280052•
*CLA:	Yes  •281282_281402•
*HEL:	She can sit on it can she? •288032_291572•
*CLA:	Yeah easily. •291572_291922•
        It comes down to about here. •291922_292962•
*HEL:	Hmm. •293142_293232•
        How often does Amy wash hers then? •293612_297312•
*CLA:	What •297312_297542•
*HEL:	How often does Amy wash •297542_311512•
*CLA:	Every day. •312862_313432•
*HEL:	Every day? •313432_313822•
        Oh gosh. •313822_315202•
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Oh careful. •315202_315572•
        It's getting worse this road. •315572_316252•
        Look at all this lot. •316252_317412•
