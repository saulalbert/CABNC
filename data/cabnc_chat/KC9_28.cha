*GIN:	Hello. •_•
*TUR:	very lucky if she'll give it to you. •_•
        . I haven't trained her yet. •_•
*GIN:	Hello darling. •_•
        Come and say hello. •_•
        There's a love. •_•
        Can't be left out can she? •_•
*TUR:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*GIN:	And bouncy there gets all the fuss doesn't she because she's so  she's so full of life. •_•
        But your an old love. •_•
        Look at her . •_•
*TUR:	Yeah. •_•
        You're always dopey aren't you? •_•
        Eh? •_•
*GIN:	Oh she  •_•
*TUR:	Suppose she's nice cos she's handier, don't have to bend down, •_•
*GIN:	That's right. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*TUR:	Sally! •_•
        Now stop it. •_•
        Gosh  end of the walk. •_•
        You should be tired. •_•
        Ah. •_•
*GIN:	Well I'll have to have it if I want to throw it. •_•
*TUR:	No she  this is what she does. •_•
*GIN:	She wants you to chase her. •_•
        I can't chase you I'm far too old. •_•
        Ha  got it. •_•
*TUR:	about three sticks on the way round so when we get here I've got one to throw. •_•
        As she brings up one I've got another one to throw and she drops what she's got. •_•
        And this is how we're going . •_•
        She's been playing with the . •_•
        I thought well that's good •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	she doesn't need the extra  belting around. •_•
*GIN:	Are you limping? •_•
*TUR:	Erm  my arthritis is playing me up this week. •_•
*GIN:	Ooh. •_•
*TUR:	Don't know why. •_•
        Whether  what's caused it. •_•
*GIN:	Cold? •_•
        A chill? •_•
*TUR:	My other knee got bad all of a sudden. •_•
        I mean I only had one bad knee but then this time I got two. •_•
*GIN:	Oh that's rough. •_•
*TUR:	It is . •_•
        Sal! •_•
        Sally . •_•
        You do not   •_•
*GIN:	I'll squeeze your paws. •_•
        I will. •_•
        I'll squeeze your paws. •_•
*TUR:	Now I keep trying that with you. •_•
        oops    Might be the weather. •_•
        I don't know. •_•
*GIN:	Have you strained? •_•
*TUR:	I did  gardening. •_•
*GIN:	Oh. •_•
*TUR:	Digging. •_•
        Could have been that. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Finds your weakest spots doesn't it? •_•
*TUR:	It sure does. •_•
        I'm not supposed to dig. •_•
*GIN:	Aren't you? •_•
*TUR:	Not really no. •_•
        Cos it aggravates the hip. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	what annoys me cos I love gardening. •_•
*GIN:	I used to do, well I, I still do all, all the gardening that gets done. •_•
        I used to spend hours gardening. •_•
*TUR:	That's what I like. •_•
        You go out there and you don't realize how long you've been out there. •_•
*GIN:	No. •_•
        No you don't. •_•
        I don't do so much now. •_•
        I'm more a fair weather gardener. •_•
*TUR:	Well I keep going out there trying to  keep the leaves down. •_•
*GIN:	That's impossible round here. •_•
*TUR:	Well we've got an oak out the front  and I've swept, I've got two bags . •_•
*GIN:	Oh I can imagine. •_•
*TUR:	The rest I've put in the gutter  off the path and of course the wind's blown them all back off again. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        It's funny whichever way the wind blows  my back door and my front door both get covered with leaves. •_•
*TUR:	Yeah. •_•
        I want  •_•
*GIN:	It's magic. •_•
*TUR:	really a continuous, strongish wind  to blow in one direction for quite a few hours. •_•
        It may blow them all into one spot. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Never happens like that though does it? •_•
*TUR:	We've got one corner of the garden out the front and if the wind's in the right direction it neatly puts them all together. •_•
*GIN:	Oh that's  •_•
*TUR:	Cos the wall stops them. •_•
        And they're much easier to pick up that way. •_•
*GIN:	That's right. •_•
*TUR:	. •_•
        But she's still got a load of leaves on her, the old oak. •_•
        There's still a lot more to come. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Oh yes there are. •_•
        I saw a gadget the other day in a magazine. •_•
        It was just like two dustbin lids. •_•
        Pick up a heap of leaves at one point. •_•
*TUR:	Oh yeah. •_•
*GIN:	I thought well you could use dustbin lids instead of sending of ten pounds to get two of their pieces of   •_•
*TUR:	I use my dust pan. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        I do. •_•
*TUR:	Because that's smashing for just scooping up. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        And you can hold them with a  with a brush or the broom. •_•
*TUR:	Well I scooped it up and I got  there. •_•
        You can always •_•
*GIN:	Yeah. •_•
*TUR:	always wear rubber gloves anyway. •_•
        So often I just scoop a  to put in. •_•
        And I even use it when  I wanna shift snow. •_•
        I just, if it's a light snow  •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        That's a good idea. •_•
*TUR:	I just scoop it up with that. •_•
        I found it a lot easier . •_•
        I mean I bought a lovely wide broom. •_•
        I thought oh that'll be smashing for the snow just sweep  •_•
*GIN:	It's hard work. •_•
*TUR:	And of course you do about a yard and then you're stuck. •_•
*GIN:	You can't move. •_•
        No I find the best thing for snow cos  we've got an eight car driveway so you can imagine how much •_•
*TUR:	Yeah. •_•
        That's like we have to. •_•
*GIN:	snow I have to shift. •_•
        I get a thin, long board and use that. •_•
*TUR:	It's definitely easiest. •_•
*GIN:	As long as the board itself isn't too heavy. •_•
*TUR:	Well this is it. •_•
        I have to, cos with the  with the pan although I'm bending, it's, it's not too bad because it's not too heavy for me. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Well I get a board about here  and just walk and push. •_•
*TUR:	Oh right. •_•
        It's alright, somebody had their erm window smashed yesterday. •_•
*GIN:	I know. •_•
        A gentleman stopped me as I was coming back and he said  do you own a white Austin Metro. •_•
        And it's funny because the last car that I saw the fellow's from  I saw the fellow's who did it. •_•
*TUR:	Oh you did? •_•
*GIN:	And got their car number. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*TUR:	Oh you have? •_•
*GIN:	And the police came and interviewed me about it. •_•
        That was a white Austin Metro. •_•
        Don't think it's the same young woman. •_•
        He said oh the car's been broken into  •_•
*TUR:	No because it was funny cos we were talking  to the lady. •_•
        She's got a red setter. •_•
        And  she'd just arrived. •_•
        And she apparently . •_•
        She said, do you know she said we'd gone off to the woods and I suddenly  remembered I'd left my purse in the car. •_•
*GIN:	Oh no. •_•
*TUR:	She said so I went back and got my purse. •_•
        She said now  apparently they've got a horse somewhere round here and she said when she came back there was this car about half hour later after they'd left here  a car been broken into. •_•
        She said er it makes me wonder if I'd left my purse in the car if it had of been our car that might have been dumped. •_•
*GIN:	Yeah. •_•
*TUR:	Well  they'd gone off and before  Anthea had gone and I was still fiddling about getting the windows clean. •_•
        This car drew in there and a chap got out and I thought, what dog's he got? •_•
        You know   •_•
*GIN:	That's what I always think. •_•
        I look for the dog or the jogging suit and if they haven't got a dog or a jogging suit  I think what are they up to? •_•
*TUR:	Well see he, he was quite tall and when he got out he was a bit scruffy looking, and his shirt was hanging out below his jacket. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	And he got out  I can't see any dog . •_•
        But he walked very purposefully erm straight up there and then I noticed he'd got a hook •_•
*GIN:	Yes? •_•
*TUR:	instead of a right hand. •_•
*GIN:	That's useful for breaking into things isn't it? •_•
*TUR:	And I, and I thought to myself  oh no perhaps he's legitimate. •_•
        He's just going for a walk . •_•
*GIN:	No it's odd. •_•
*TUR:	But it's a maroony  dirty maroony  and black I think it was car. •_•
        And it was a W M X, the letters were. •_•
*GIN:	Didn't you tell the police? •_•
        You should give them a ring and tell them if you saw a strange man. •_•
*TUR:	Well yeah I I mean he disappeared from sight whereas the others •_•
*GIN:	Well he would if you were waiting around here. •_•
        Of course you look as though  •_•
*TUR:	Ah I dunno. •_•
        One morning when I came here there was a car arrived here and it was a  a dirty yellow one and two women and a bloke got out all dressed in  black jeans and black jumpers. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	So I thought now that's odd. •_•
        They didn't look the sort to go  for a ramble  •_•
*GIN:	perhaps. •_•
*TUR:	And they come out and they sort of were looking around  and there was a load of cars here. •_•
        And I thought I don't like the look of that. •_•
*GIN:	Mm. •_•
*TUR:	So I was standing there and I thought to myself pretend I'm looking at my watch and I'm waiting for someone. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	And they hung about and hung about and then they came across here, looked at the board and they kept turning round and looking where I was. •_•
        And I was still hanging there. •_•
        Then they walked down there, but not out of sight  of the cars. •_•
        Then they came back, read the notice board again. •_•
        I must have been there about five or ten minutes? •_•
*GIN:	neat haircuts? •_•
*TUR:	They looked quite  quite presentable. •_•
*GIN:	 (        ) 
*TUR:	One woman was very fat. •_•
        And I still stood there so I got in the car and wrote the number down. •_•
*GIN:	Good for you. •_•
*TUR:	Cos I thought I'm never gonna remember it. •_•
        And eventually they got in and went off. •_•
        But they were, they kept on looking at me to see if I was gonna move and I thought I'm not gonna move till you move. •_•
*GIN:	Mm. •_•
*TUR:	Cos the fact that they only went down there, came back and were milling around  waiting I wouldn't have been a bit surprised cos the car was a filthy old car. •_•
*GIN:	You should have told you should have told the police. •_•
        Any car number you can  •_•
*TUR:	They hadn't done anything. •_•
*GIN:	No. •_•
        But any car number you can get if they're acting suspiciously please tell them. •_•
        That's what they keep telling me. •_•
*TUR:	Oh I see. •_•
        Cos they had er  •_•
*GIN:	Because they came and interviewed me. •_•
        If you see anything suspicious. •_•
        The last time I phoned up I said  the bicycle that was hidden in the bushes. •_•
        Obviously been stolen. •_•
        Down there  that erm Davey  and I found together. •_•
        His dog erm found it, you know Sam? •_•
        Erm  next day it was still there  although he'd phoned the police. •_•
        So I phoned them up in the afternoon and I said the bicycle that  my friend Mr  reported yesterday afternoon is still in the bushes. •_•
        I said and I have a feeling that there was somebody there watching me  I could feel it. •_•
        I said and as I came back up what I call the straight path parallel with the road there were two men loitering in the bushes against the car park. •_•
*TUR:	Oi! •_•
*GIN:	Both very well dressed. •_•
        Jeans, but clean and spruce and I said  I have a feeling they could have been police. •_•
        And he burst out laughing and said you're quite right madam, they were police. •_•
*TUR:	No these didn't give me the feeling of being police. •_•
*GIN:	No. •_•
        But there's one I thought how stupid. •_•
        It's alright to park erm a non police car but there was a policeman actually sitting in the car while two of them loitered in there. •_•
        They were obviously staking out the place. •_•
        But while there's a man sitting respectably in a car no-one's gonna break into the other cars. •_•
*TUR:	I know. •_•
*GIN:	Not if they're witnessed, are they? •_•
*TUR:	No I mean because I mean erm •_•
*GIN:	So the other police should have gone into the other  should have gone away somewhere. •_•
*TUR:	I didn't  I didn't cotton on to these two er these three. •_•
*GIN:	And yet you feel uneasy? •_•
*TUR:	Erm  it was the way they sort of checked all the way round the car park as if they were looking to see which would be the best. •_•
        And I mean they did get out and have a little mooch around the car park. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	And I thought to myself no I'm not gonna go out, I did start to go out the park and I thought no. •_•
*GIN:	Yeah. •_•
        I'm like you. •_•
*TUR:	Because  what if  they do break in. •_•
        Perhaps I'm, I'm misjudging but perhaps  what if they did, how would I feel? •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	So I thought no I'll wait and see. •_•
*GIN:	Oh you should give the police that number. •_•
        Just to be on the safe side. •_•
*TUR:	I've lost it now cos I've chucked the matchbox out. •_•
*GIN:	Oh what a shame. •_•
*TUR:	But it was a yellow car and it had like soft toys and that in the back. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	On the back window ledge. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	Cos I thought to myself well I'll never remember the make of car. •_•
        I mean I'm, I'm hopeless with cars. •_•
        But I thought to myself oh you do  you do look suspicious. •_•
        And then I was talking to somebody about this and  they and they burst out laughing and said well we've got a friend, a male friend   a mate of mine he said and he loves walking. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	He said and what he often does  is because he lives over this area. •_•
        He'll often cut through  this way to go over to Wellington into Crowthorne and walk all the way round. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	He said he often walks through the woods on his own. •_•
        I had to laugh. •_•
        He must forgive us ladies  do a sidestep . •_•
        He said he is legitimate. •_•
        He just loves walking. •_•
*GIN:	Oh yes. •_•
        But the police would much rather you told them  when there's no •_•
*TUR:	Yes. •_•
*GIN:	nothing to be  nothing wrong with it than that you didn't tell them and there might be something wrong with it. •_•
*TUR:	Oh I'll have to keep my eyes open. •_•
        Cos I thought well the couple had only just walked up there and I thought to myself oh well  he might meet up with them, you know. •_•
*GIN:	The young, the young officer who came to me he said  of course we're so glad you got the number, you're quite right it's a car that's been doing the same thing in Wokingham. •_•
        We only know that they live somewhere in the Wokingham area. •_•
        It's lads who earn their living at this. •_•
*TUR:	Yeah, yeah. •_•
*GIN:	They go from car park to car park. •_•
        He said er but of course the thing is they don't expect elderly ladies  to notice their car numbers and remember them. •_•
        Now I may not remember always the make  first glance off unless I look at it. •_•
        But this was an eastern European car so they didn't expect me to know the make. •_•
        But I do remember numbers. •_•
*TUR:	Oh I've got a terrible memory. •_•
*GIN:	And I scratched it on there to make sure that I didn't forget it. •_•
*TUR:	Oh I see. •_•
*GIN:	And as soon as I got home I wrote it down. •_•
        I put it on there with my key. •_•
        # or whatever it was. •_•
        It's probably still there now. •_•
        It is  it's still there. •_•
        . It's still there. •_•
*TUR:	Oh this was  this was  er W M X. •_•
        I remembered that because  what did it remind me of? •_•
        W M X.  •_•
*GIN:	Like a B M X bike I expect. •_•
*TUR:	Yeah or a volkswagen or something. •_•
*GIN:	Mm. •_•
*TUR:	Something clicked as I looked at the number. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	It's like with a lot of number plates. •_•
        Sometimes it  oh that's so and so's. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	I mean a lot of mine I can't even remember me own number plate. •_•
*GIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*TUR:	But I . •_•
        No I went back and got in the car and was fiddling about and I wrote it down on a matchbox you see. •_•
*GIN:	Yes good idea. •_•
*TUR:	But the funny thing is by the time I got home I still remembered it. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Cos you'd written it down. •_•
        If you hadn't written it down you wouldn't have. •_•
*TUR:	No. •_•
        Er this is, I mean I've just got that way. •_•
        I thought to myself well if I don't write it down now  cos that's why I got back in my car. •_•
*GIN:	You should have told the police  they'd have been interested. •_•
*TUR:	Oh well then, another time then I'll remember that. •_•
*GIN:	Cos you see I said why, why can't you trace the car? •_•
        I mean the number's quite, I said you, you reaffirmed that the number was the same one that had been doing the same thing in, in Wokingham. •_•
        He said  the car belonged to an elderly lady in Wokingham. •_•
        We've traced it that far. •_•
        She had sold it and she hadn't told the erm Swansea people, you know? •_•
*TUR:	Yeah. •_•
*GIN:	The vehicle licensing people. •_•
        It's so easy to just write the slip  and say I've sold my car to mister so and so. •_•
        I always do it. •_•
        Erm  and then that person she'd sold it to she knew their address. •_•
        They went to him and he had sold it as well and they couldn't •_•
*TUR:	Yeah cos since they've done away with the log book. •_•
*GIN:	And it hadn't been registered. •_•
*TUR:	Where you used to have to send the  •_•
*GIN:	Exactly. •_•
*TUR:	log book in and it would come back. •_•
*GIN:	It hadn't been registered so they'd got, the police have got no way of tracing it. •_•
*TUR:	No. •_•
*GIN:	Except keep driving round Wokingham looking for it. •_•
*TUR:	I mean they  at least they could pick you up cos they'd had the log book. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	In the old days. •_•
*GIN:	Yeah. •_•
        It was good wasn't it? •_•
*TUR:	Yeah. •_•
        And each car they knew where they were didn't they? •_•
*GIN:	That's right. •_•
        And the previous owner and the previous owner. •_•
*TUR:	That's it. •_•
        Cos it was all written down. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
*TUR:	Oh all these  barred stuff. •_•
*GIN:	They've got everything on computers now and it doesn't work half the time does it? •_•
*TUR:	Well it's only as good as the person putting it in. •_•
*GIN:	Yeah too true. •_•
*TUR:	That's what they used to say. •_•
        Still  human error. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        Oh yes. •_•
*TUR:	Until you get a computer for computing a computer. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        With a mind of it's own. •_•
        An intelligence. •_•
*TUR:	That's what I mean. •_•
        Then that's frightening. •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
        It is isn't it? •_•
*TUR:	Oh I couldn't take that. •_•
*GIN:	Well. •_•
        I love your accent. •_•
        Where do you come from? •_•
*TUR:	Me? •_•
        Originally  London. •_•
        Chiswick. •_•
*GIN:	I wouldn't  don't hear any London. •_•
*TUR:	Erm  well  sometimes it might come out is a bit of Devonshire. •_•
*GIN:	Devonshire? •_•
        Yes. •_•
        That's what it is. •_•
*TUR:	I only spent six years of my childhood there during the war years. •_•
*GIN:	Well I can hear it. •_•
        It's a lovely soft  soft accent. •_•
*TUR:	Oh thank you. •_•
        Very proud of being  •_•
*GIN:	Yes. •_•
