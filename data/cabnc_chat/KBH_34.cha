*CAR:	Yes, that, that was almost that you have a complex about it. •181367_181771•
*CAR:	Still not right. •181772_181832•
        Well I didn't have, •181832_181922•
*CAR:	, but you do now. •182009_182089•
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Erm, it's, it's fine, it's, they were little slips, are you practising your left hand on it's own? •182142_182711•
*CAR:	Eh, I haven't been this week. •182711_182964•
*CAR:	I would. •182971_182987•
*CAR:	I've just been doing it together. •183029_183178•
*CAR:	I think just a few times •183178_183322•
*CAR:	Mhm. •183364_183385•
*CAR:	would  would help it, it's it's not quite secure enough, because it might have been before I arrived, but all the weaknesses show up  •183401_184248•
*CAR:	Yes I know. •184248_184280•
*CAR:	you know, so erm, I, I think a little left hand practice would solve it, I noticed that you put a five on that, I think it's better if you put a four. •184314_185266•
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Yes. •185313_185366•
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Whether you will or not is another matter, that, try it again, and no faster than that, very, very sturdy, very sturdy. •185401_186404•
