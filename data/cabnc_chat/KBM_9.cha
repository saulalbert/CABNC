*STE:	Yeah
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	when you're baptized 
*STE:	it's your own decision
*DAV:	when you're baptized it's like a pool of water  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Three or four of us start, er three or four of us talking yesterday, day before yesterday, erm, about   (.) the attitude generally of erm students in the, the sixth form, years twelve and thirteen, and 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	and erm, it struck us that erm possibly in this year's lower sixth erm there, there are one or two people, boys and er lads and girls, erm who are not aware 
*CHR:	Boys and lads and girls 
*UNK:	of what sixth form courses entails, now, erm, three or four of us thought it might be worth our while, or your while if you just briefly said what I'm going to say now, that erm, the, the 
*CHR:	It's a bit vague innit?
*UNK:	work you do up to G C S E is very difficult, that it should be very different from erm, when you're in the sixth form
*CHR:	Why?
*UNK:	Because until G C S E you are fed, the school is fed, in that you are told fairly quickly what you have to do and although I know that a number of you spends the right amount of time or a lot of time on homework, you are told usually, er you have erm a night or two nights in which to do this particular piece of work   (.) now once you get into the sixth form 
*CHR:	I can tell I'm not gonna like this 
*UNK:	you are given very much more freedom or independence would be a better word, and erm 
*CHR:	Shit 
*UNK:	you'd be expected to, to do a lot of work by yourself, and that's reflecting the fact that erm you'll probably have four or five lessons in each of your three subjects, but most people would choose three subjects for A level, and that means that er, when you're not having lessons, you've got a lot of time that is not accountable for, you will have been, or going to a general studies period and stuff like that, but there will be a fair number of private study periods, erm, there are some people I think who, who go overboard, and you've got such a different approach erm from er the lower sixth, people don't use the time that they have, erm, what I'm really saying is that if you go into the sixth form   (.) and you spend less school time in the sixth form you don't need to be prepared 
*CHR:	Well what's   (        ) 
*UNK:	to, to make wise use of your non-teaching 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	time, erm presumably going into a library quite a lot.You would also be expected to for example to prepare for 
*CHR:	Eh I'm not going into a library, fuck that
*UNK:	for certain lessons, I just give you an example with literature it would work with erm science and er other things as well, you might be told in the next lesson we are going to discuss, for example the first act of a particular play, or we're going to discuss which particular scientific experiment or the cause of whatever it is 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	you will be expected to have done some research, done some preparation before coming along to the lesson, if you go along to the lesson not having done that, you will be able to play back certain tips from what the other people say, but you will not er, you will find that   (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	anywhere near   (        ) as if you were prepared, because if you were prepared there are bound to be one or two things that you would want to ask for, own by the standard of interpretation of whatever it is, or a particular word if it's a language and so on, erm and that is something that er I think people erm come across as   (        ) 
*CHR:	Oh yeah, sure 
*UNK:	and the other, the other, the other thing, I don't want to make this sound a lecture or anything like that, but the other thing is that erm erm you have 
*CHR:	You can stuff your lecture 
*UNK:	twenty one months in the sixth form, please don't think that everybody has two years, erm and those, those 
*CHR:	Oh okay 
*UNK:	short two years may make a big difference at this stage now, erm
*CHR:	 ((sigh)) 
*UNK:	A levels   (        ) only happen when the most, a month, more from school and then they have study leave as you are, now erm   (.) when you consider the, the year since September has gone very, very quickly, those who have done very little work in that first year, year twelve, will find that   (        ) been packed in there and that first year in the sixth is just like your year ten ought to have been, perhaps, one or two of you are are realizing 
*CHR:	Oh oh 
*UNK:	that you could have done a bit more last year
*CHR:	That's likely
*UNK:	and it's even more noticeable once you go into the, the year twelve, that first twelve months is crucial, if you just kick your heels and do nothing, you'll find it very very difficult to work to pull up   (        ) 
*CHR:	Is he finished this?Finished this?
*UNK:	but whichever work you study 
*CHR:	Yeah, all of it?
*UNK:	you know that is the, erm two or three things there, you're working by yourself in your, your personal preparation   (        ) prepa preparation are crucial parts, erm, if any of the people were thinking of going to erm, erm, a college, erm, the same sort of thing will arise and I suppose the big difference for   (        ) if you don't have lessons then I think I'm right in saying you don't necessarily have to go in, I don't know whether that still applies, erm, you would be expected of course to erm, erm, to turn up at school here, erm, now there are advantages and disadvantages, you may feel that you prefer, knowing on your own what you're like, you'll prefer erm some fairly rigid rules, erm, because if there weren't rules you might think you'd take advantage of us
*CHR:	You got rules here
*UNK:	erm, only that sort of rules, probably a big advantage I think of staying in er sixth form is that erm you know the staff, you know the system and it and they know you, erm if you go to   (        ) 
*CHR:	A big problem man 
*UNK:	you will take you a matter of months of course for you to settle in, and those first few months are crucial, again, I maybe just mention this that you are aware of   (        ) okay so that's   (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	Okay, let's go  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	eh?What?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	was a bit out of order    (        )  (.) we have nothing to do with it   (        ) hmm  (        ) 
*DAV:	What?It was an accident
*CHR:	hair, leave the hair  (        ) 
*DAV:	it was an accident  ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Cor I bet
*STE:	You'd been planning it for about   (        ) 
*DAV:	It just came out   ((laugh))  (.)
