*DAV:	Well I think you should join up because something's put  in the middle but depends   (.) in a game   (        ) If I was playing against a level player you might just have a very hard crack together, but just to join up gently in the middle.
*CHR:	Right right fine.
*DAV:	If you miss , you're still playing  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes
