*STA:	It's old trouble. •357102_358312•
        I think  •358312_358552•

*STA:	he's more interested in women than anything else! •358692_360962•

*STA:	And I said to him, I said well I hope I don't mind er me ringing the doctor, well he said no that's what we're here for. •393552_399282•
        But he said, I've got three hours of paperwork! •399282_401572•
        Well that's nothing to do with it! •401572_403612•

*STA:	That isn't a way to get through to people! •724632_726592•
*ENI:	No it isn't! •726592_727032•
        No it's not. •727032_727502•

*STA:	of them get too  snooty in a way. •737532_739782•
*ENI:	Yes , they get, they're a bit less committed. •739782_741592•
        I think the  •741592_741942•
*STA:	And, as you say with , well if he can go fishing and shooting, I don't know about that, they take priority! •741942_747842•
*ENI:	Yes. •748082_748352•
        Yes, that's true. •748352_749392•
        Mhm. •749672_749822•

        And he's very young, he's , I met him  twice, when I was with people who  were dying •758802_764402•
*STA:	Yes. •765232_765722•
*ENI:	and erm  in fact, yes, but both of just had died and we sent for  the doctor and it's •765722_771942•
*STA:	Aha. •772002_772112•
*ENI:	it was he who came  and erm  he was absolutely marvellous! •772112_776172•
        I thought his manner was  just right. •776172_779392•
*STA:	Makes all the difference doesn't it? •779392_780392•
*ENI:	Oh yes! •780392_780792•
        It does make a lot of  •780792_781642•
*STA:	I mean  •781642_781942•
*ENI:	difference, yes  •781942_782072•
*STA:	a person like that  can help another person to get well can't they? •782072_785252•
*ENI:	They can! •785252_786202•
        They can. •786202_786392•
        I mean,there is something to be said for the manner towards you isn't there? •786392_789162•
*STA:	Ooh yes! •789352_790112•
*ENI:	Yes. •790112_790452•
*STA:	Yes! •790522_790742•
*ENI:	That's true. •790752_791072•
*STA:	I mean, when you look forward to seeing the doctor and one thing and another, and saying, have a conversation with them, that's a different story innit? •791072_797332•

*ENI:	Absolutely! •801442_801762•
        Yes! •801762_801822•

*ENI:	That's right. •806402_807052•
        That's true. •807062_807332•
*STA:	Yes. •807472_807602•
        I don't know why some of them get like that, well of course they shouldn't be doctors any how. •807602_812492•
        And a doctor should have a nice personality! •812492_814552•
*ENI:	He should. •816302_816992•
        I think in some cases, Stanley, not only in the , medical profession  the more people are paid  the less committed they seem to be to the job! •816992_825192•
*STA:	Yes, they do, they get independent! •825402_827272•
*ENI:	Yes. •827332_827492•
        They begin to feel that the job is there so that they can earn a living, rather than that they are doing the job itself! •827492_833882•
*STA:	That's right , yes. •833892_834482•
        Yes. •834482_834542•

        Yes. •838792_838892•
*STA:	Yes. •838892_839022•

*STA:	Well I mean after all they want er an appointment! •863462_866542•
*ENI:	Yes. •866542_866742•
*STA:	But you don't get no appointment! •866742_868622•
*ENI:	That's right, you don't. •868632_869342•
