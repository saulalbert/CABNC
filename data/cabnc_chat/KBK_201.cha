@Comment:	conversation #201 (Tape 002909)
*CHR:	They're busy little bees in here  (        ) 
*NOR:	The restaurant's nice.
*CHR:	It is indeed.When you've had a day in the open air you have a sort of
*NOR:	Glow.
*CHR:	glow. (        )  (.) 
*NOR:	 (        ) it really was chilly by the time I  (        ) 
*CHR:	Well I mean you can relax on that score because you had a very good half hour run with me.She wasn't in frantic form but she was zipping hither and dither.
*NOR:	She insisted on coming
*CHR:	Galloped around the outside.I was absolutely steaming by the time I got back to the car.
*NOR:	It was very hot.And the very erm   (        ) she was very anxious to come with me when I went out into the park.To get me into the car so I let her come.
*CHR:	Good.To get the what?
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Oh yes.
*NOR:	And she had to come in the car while I  (        ) 
*CHR:	There's a take away here. (        ) a bag for somebody.
*NOR:	A doggy bag.
*CHR:	No.A great big carrier bag you can't see it it's just outside.
*NOR:	It all seems rather a shame really you know to do a take away  (        ) .I mean that rather a nice Chinese restaurant in the high street does take away.
*CHR:	We had one last week.
*NOR:	 (        ) but if you're going to pay a lot of money for your take away
*CHR:	I wonder if they charge the same prices for their take away as for sitting at the table.
*NOR:	I think they really must.My mother
*CHR:	I know I know in the past I have er   (        ) ten percent or something.But I may be going back far too long for the evening.
*NOR:	Well you'd think they could because you are not paying for the service are you?
*CHR:	That's right.Yes I think I could become really absorbed in croquet.I don't know if I'd become good at it but I think
*NOR:	Why not?
*CHR:	but I think it'd be a game that one could become absorbed in.It's not physically demanding other than in stamina concentration terms.It's hardly physically demanding is it?And the course that David went on before he was asked to coach on it was for advanced people anyway  (        ) .And he said ah er I misunderstood this and er and I said well you know when is it?Who knows may be I could baah aah aah.And he said, er er.Just possible that you   (        ) standard because he obviously seemed to think that I was that I had some great possible qualities but
*NOR:	But?
*CHR:	Well I would I, he would say you know you know you don't croquet that and it's a short bom bom and it's
*NOR:	It's the first time you've done it.
*CHR:	Oh! (        ) what does he mean by that?And so on and so forth.
*NOR:	But he must be quite good unusual to start by playing a whole game?
*CHR:	Well I mean he showed me how er er he showed me how the mallet is operated.There's no standard grip you
*LYN:	Alright?
*NOR:	I have mine.
*LYN:	Thank you.
*CHR:	I notice that you do takeaways here?
*LYN:	Yes we do.
*CHR:	Do you charge the same prices as in the restaurant?
*LYN:	Oh no.It's cheaper than the restaurant.Yes yes
*CHR:	Ah!I'm I'm pleased to hear that.That's interesting we were
*LYN:	One moment.I give you our menu you know.
*CHR:	Yes thank you.I would be interested.
*LYN:	 (        ) except V A T.
*CHR:	Yes.
*LYN:	You can charge more   (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	Well they're not receiving   ((gasp)) excuse me the service and the pleasure of the table and the atmosphere.
*LYN:	You see when you want to get home I charge more.The people why they want here they can have cheaper right here.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes.Yes.
*LYN:	I give you one menu, okay?
*CHR:	Thank you. ((laugh)) And it always smells good here doesn't it?It always smells super. ((cough)) Who is the tall thin chap sitting next to Diane?
*NOR:	I don't know darling.Probably their family or something   (        ) I don't know.
*NOR:	Do you remember being here with  (        ) ?
*CHR:	Yes I do.We sat there.
*NOR:	Ham and Eve
*CHR:	Ham and Eve! (        ) And they enjoyed it didn't they?
*NOR:	Yes.
*CHR:	Unfortunately you chose the ginger beetle, the toffee beetle or something of the sort it had a gingery look to it.
*NOR:	 (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	Oh is that what it's called?Yes.
*NOR:	It was very feathery.Not gingery feathery.Did you notice in the front of the back   (        ) so you must remember to take back.Somebody has started a boat on the river.The article on the front page.
*CHR:	I haven't seen it no.
*NOR:	The cook from the Spread Eagle.
*CHR:	Oh yeah.
*NOR:	Chef who is no longer there?
*CHR:	Chefette yes?
*NOR:	He has acquired a boat. (        ) or somewhere.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes.Yes.Which he uses for parties rather than as a restaurant.
*NOR:	And you can hire it out.
*CHR:	Somebody had a super birthday party for their husband.
*NOR:	 (        ) And the cheapest menu was thirteen pounds.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Based on O'Hagen sausage.
*CHR:	Yes.Yes.Yes I thought that was rather good.
*NOR:	Sounded rather fun.
*CHR:	Yes it did.
*NOR:	Quite pricey actually
*CHR:	Yes well it was pricey.But then you're paying for the use of the boat as well aren't you?
*NOR:	Yes but then when I came here with you.The meal was thirteen pounds ten
*CHR:	Right.
*NOR:	plus the wine.
*CHR:	But that was, a year ago two years ago.
*NOR:	A year and half ago anyway.Nearly two years ago.Erm she said   (        ) six months ahead.
*CHR:	Oh really?
*NOR:	She said when you came and I rang to confirm it all she said you're very lucky because he agreed thirteen pounds and we don't do it for under fifteen pounds now.
*CHR:	Really?
*NOR:	And I said oh dear!I hope you're not going to be feeling mean about it you know because
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	because they weren't, were they?
*CHR:	No.No.No they were not.They were not they were honest.They were honest and straightforward and jolly good stuff.
*NOR:	It was really thanks to Linda and Graham because I never would have done it otherwise.
*CHR:	No.You learn about these things in different ways don't you? it's all very
*NOR:	I think Linda and Graham were the only people there who had been before have any other common
*CHR:	Quite probably.The only local people in Essex probably.
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Is that our Dim Sum.Goody goody.Yes please.Thank you.Thank you.
