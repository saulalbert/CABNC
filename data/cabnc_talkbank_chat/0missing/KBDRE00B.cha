*KBDPSUN:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	And and wrought iron it yeah you know . 
*PS03W:	Well wrought iron 'd look it 'd look quite good for the functions trade as well cos you can get . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	the artificial plants up it . 
*KBDPSUN:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	and whatever else .

*PS03W:	Mm . 
*KBDPSUN:	big open wide .

*KBDPSUN:	Well all you do right you have gates . 
*PS03W:	Well I mean . 
*KBDPSUN:	then they 're open so that at half nine you close them there or at ten o'clock you close them there and you say when they come through if you 're going out that . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	way or whatever . 
*PS03W:	Yeah I mean I I think you just have to but . 
*KBDPSUN:	It 's something that you 've got ta be . 
*PS03W:	You 'd have to play it by ear I think Yes . 
*KBDPSUN:	thinking ahead . 
*PS03W:	Yeah Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	You know you 're thinking well . 
*PS03W:	Let's . 
*KBDPSUN:	at first you could just wrought iron it round and and just give it that . 
*PS03W:	As you say if somebody 's been in there from bloody five o'clock and wants to stay till eleven . 
*KBDPSUN:	Well that 's it . 
*PS03W:	or twelve then fine let them I mean I th I would n't I would n't mind that . 
*KBDPSUN:	No . 
*PS03W:	you know I mean . 
*PS03W:	So you could either come in half eight half nine or . 
*PS03W:	That 's right You know . 
*KBDPSUN:	But really you know . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	what you do At half nine you put someone on the door here to take money anyone who comes in whether they come into here or go into there . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*KBDPSUN:	anyone who 's been drinking all afternoon if you want to er wander across . 
*PS03W:	Yeah I mean what you what you 'd have to be careful of is is sooner or later people 'll catch on to . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	coming in at quarter past nine . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS03W:	buying one extra drink and erm getting a you know cheaper than saving theirselves two and a half quid then . 
*PS03W:	pint they buy and if they buy five pints . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	they can have a three er er a three pound voucher . 
*KBDPSUN:	Can you imagine Polly organizing that all . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*KBDPSUN:	0 . 
*PS03W:	We 're getting complicated are n't we . 
*KBDPSUN:	Why ca n't we do it to me cost effective . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*KBDPSUN:	Torture . 
*PS03W:	Complicating issues . 
*PS03W:	I remember at the Uni when we used to give we used to put stamps on people you know . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	for pass outs and that or anything . 
*KBDPSUN:	So does Broadway . 
*PS03W:	and er I bloody I said I said in the end I 've what we ought to do is lop some part of their anatomy off like a little digit or something then we can prove they 've been in . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*PS03W:	eventually after about two years when you get this sort of armless legless cor . 
*KBDPSUN:	Oh oh . 
*PS03W:	body oh he 's a good customer We 'll let him in for free He gets a free free ticket . 
*PS03W:	Well it 's like like a all you want to do is . 
*KBDPSUN:	0 . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*KBDPSUN:	That 's what you get you just got ta stand or you went downstairs to another bar . 
*PS03W:	Yeah th the trouble is you 're . 
*KBDPSUN:	and got a stamp . 
*PS03W:	you . 
*KBDPSUN:	and they would . 
*PS03W:	you you 're doing it in the same room . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	are n't you That 's the . 
*KBDPSUN:	That is as well . 
*PS03W:	But I I du n no I see it 's not once you 're u actually up here looking I think it 's different when you 're up here looking back as when you 're over there looking up here . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	It 's not quite as cold and empty as . 
*KBDPSUN:	If it got going you 'd probably use mo another another half of area you know . 
*PS03W:	Yeah yeah you want . 
*KBDPSUN:	you do n't wan na close it off But like you say maybe just just a bit of wrought . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	ironwork . 
*PS03W:	Yeah I think so . 
*KBDPSUN:	to just . 
*PS03W:	I think you do I think that would look good anyway and . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	and it would also enable you to quickly and easily do something on the erm on the on the private functions night to make it look different . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	I mean I would n't suggest putting . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*PS03W:	plants up and everything for our normal you know rock nights I mean we just have the wrought iron up and whatever but . 
*KBDPSUN:	I mean with them sort of then . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	once you got erm tied into these you can . 
*PS03W:	Oh yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	do whatever to the thing . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	But it would give you affect . 
*PS03W:	That 's right I mean those are just we just went out and chucked a few fucking trees down . 
*KBDPSUN:	They 're not real then Barry . 
*PS03W:	No the trees are the er things tied on to them are n't . 
*KBDPSUN:	Oh . 
*PS03W:	But er . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah I think it 's quite actually it needs a bit of character . 
*PS03W:	I mean that 'll cover . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	if you did that in quite a few places . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	throughout the room it would cover your cracks and your holes . 
*PS03W:	Ye 0 . 
*PS03W:	and your your . 
*PS03W:	I mean what we initially wanted to do with all this was cover this whole area in in greenery and have this as a sort of restaurant ta type . 
*KBDPSUN:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	I mean again it 's ideas when you 're sat . 
*PS03W:	It 's ideas . 
*PS03W:	planning before you 've actually moved in and get . 
*PS03W:	It is Yeah yeah that 's right . 
*PS03W:	and get and then then you start . 
*KBDPSUN:	0 . 
*PS03W:	that 's that 's the other thing when there 's only two of you involved and you we were opening for that first sort of eighteen months five six days a week just keeping on top of a day to day business does n't allow you to sit back . 
*KBDPSUN:	No I know that . 
*PS03W:	and expand it and whereas you know that that 's one area that 'd be great with having yo your involvement . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	that you go in and say well you know . 
*PS03W:	It sounds like this sort of thing . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*KBDPSUN:	When did you paint all this green . 
*PS03W:	It was when I was working for Walt Disney so it 'll be two years ago Two years . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	ago I was over in Belfast and I came back and it were green It was alri it 's it 's actually lasted reasonably well considering it had n't been . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	for two years . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	But again it was all done it was all literally done in a weekend . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	It was like a virtually an all night blitz job and so bits of it you know it was n't like totally completed you know you 've got and as Scouse was doing some of it it was er the paintwork leaves something to be desired in areas . 
*KBDPSUN:	Something there Barry little bit in there look . 
*PS03W:	Just coming down a little bit They just need brushing back up . 
*KBDPSUN:	It 's got a few you 've got the . 
*PS03W:	Not a problem . 
*KBDPSUN:	roof repaired have n't you This . 
*PS03W:	Yeah The heating 's very efficient as well It 's very hot gas heating . 
*PS03W:	Yes . 
*PS03W:	Erm . 
*PS03W:	They did do it like you say it was more or less just covering for itself now and then use . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	you build up up and up do n't you . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	So .

*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	But we need a full . 
*PS03W:	Yeah I mean we can we can start by we I mean we can get people set up for doing things from the first of March ca n't we . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	The little bits and pieces that we talked about . 
*PS03W:	Well we well we we can start if you wan na start with the . 
*PS03W:	Or we can think about doing something about . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yes . 
*PS03W:	this . 
*PS03W:	We can start giving it a lick of paint if you wan na start giving it a lick of paint . 
*PS03W:	You see now the more you think about it I mean the more you you do n't actually use this . 
*KBDPSUN:	No . 
*PS03W:	very much I mean you look at it if everybody was seated in this area that could be seated I mean you 're only talking about bloody . 
*PS03W:	I . 
*PS03W:	thirty people . 
*PS03W:	I do n't think it 's too bad actually I do n't think the carpet 's too bad at all really . 
*PS03W:	Well th there 's areas I mean . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	tha the licens . 
*PS03W:	Oh yeah . 
*PS03W:	the licensing people would pull us up on that . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	if they came . 
*KBDPSUN:	But maybe if you could cut it off from there . 
*PS03W:	That 's what I mean you got ta and then do it clear it and then clear all that . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	and just left that area . 
*KBDPSUN:	Clear all that . 
*PS03W:	and they 're obviously they 're gon na say . 
*KBDPSUN:	Come right up to the right up to bar really are n't you . 
*PS03W:	Yeah I mean th th er the other thing psychologically is it 's you know . 
*PS03W:	Blue Rhapsody . 
*PS03W:	Blue Rhapsody If you wanted to cha if you want to change it slightly you 've got a problem . 
*KBDPSUN:	You know I think it I think it 's something that you can say well you know that 'd be one of our objectives . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*KBDPSUN:	once we get it going but le . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*KBDPSUN:	alright we we 've got . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*KBDPSUN:	a few bob in the kitty . 
*PS03W:	Right . 
*KBDPSUN:	let's or we can go to brewery for another five grand we 'll do the carpet . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*KBDPSUN:	now . 
*PS03W:	I reckon the first thing really is is get your salary . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	Get your salary that you feel that I 'm doing this and I 'm getting it right . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	Is that the right sort of if our I mean from our objective is to get more sales . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	right now . 
*PS03W:	That 's right That 's right . 
*PS03W:	And we 've got ta . 
*PS03W:	That 's right . 
*PS03W:	manipulate people to say well how do we get them drink more And you say like five pound a head when they they come in . 
*KBDPSUN:	How bad 's the seating though . 
*PS03W:	Sit there till .

*PS03W:	It 's it 's if it needs doing . 
*KBDPSUN:	Oh it needs doing does it . 
*PS03W:	You know . 
*PS03W:	If you 've got a guy gathered I 'm not saying try but if you got somebody who who did the job and gathered it in like they would do . 
*PS03W:	Oh yeah Yeah Yeah But it i . 
*PS03W:	An upholster . 
*PS03W:	It 's a perpetual patching up job at the moment . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS03W:	Because because it is only patched up it 's . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	it create more problems o you know cos people stand on it and . 
*PS03W:	Get an upholsterer just to come and tidy it up . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	and fill in where there 's been . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	some damage done . 
*PS03W:	Yeah that 's right I mean there 's . 
*PS03W:	Just just tart it up really . 
*PS03W:	There 's a bit of structural damage to the support . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	and things like that that start the seating going and things . 
*KBDPSUN:	Right Okay . 
*PS03W:	Oh this this actual stuff anyway we 'll go we 're putting that with that is alright to that . 
*PS03W:	Oh yes .

*PS03W:	alright . 
*PS03W:	Oh yeah . 
*PS03W:	0 . 
*PS03W:	There 's a few of them damaged but but erm I think we 've repaired most of them You see we did get it all completely repaired when we moved in cos it was in a hell of a state from Peter Cos Peter had this place . 
*PS03W:	Yeah That 's right . 
*KBDPSUN:	Well we we we know . 
*PS03W:	We knew . 
*KBDPSUN:	about that . 
*PS03W:	about that . 
*KBDPSUN:	0 . 
*PS03W:	How Did he . 
*KBDPSUN:	Cos we . 
*PS03W:	owe you money . 
*KBDPSUN:	we gone . 
*PS03W:	Well . 
*KBDPSUN:	and got it actually . 
*PS03W:	Did you . 
*KBDPSUN:	Bloody right . 
*PS03W:	God You must be one of the few people . 
*KBDPSUN:	It were quite good cos what we had we had th the the other partner who was you know the other partner is Michael . 
*PS03W:	He was called what was he called Ken . 
*PS03W:	No no . 
*KBDPSUN:	No . 
*PS03W:	No that 's . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yes . 
*PS03W:	that 's John . 
*PS03W:	But what do you call him That erm . 
*PS03W:	I know who you mean I met him yeah . 
*PS03W:	Cos the other guy was a was a bar manager Duncan or . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	Der summat like that and his wife had a baby at the same time as Elaine 's so she our midwife would come and er so the she kept in touch really of of what they were because they wanted to I 'll take the place off they wanted to take it over I do n't think they was er as bad a . 
*PS03W:	No . 
*PS03W:	shower of shit . 
*PS03W:	No . 
*PS03W:	as he were . 
*PS03W:	No . 
*PS03W:	tended to . 
*PS03W:	No . 
*PS03W:	be But er in the end they never got the license back Because what they did try and do is buy the catholic club did n't they Top of Lancasters Next to the . 
*PS03W:	Cos the . 
*PS03W:	Alex . 
*PS03W:	The Alex . 
*PS03W:	They tried to get behind there the catholic . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	club . 
*PS03W:	Right . 
*PS03W:	Then they got they did n't get it past . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	But er he actually owed .

*PS03W:	He did n't half go for a lot again . 
*KBDPSUN:	Yes we did seem to be quite lucky to keep . 
*PS03W:	Yeah But I I I 'm amazed that breweries keep lending him money . 
*PS03W:	I know . 
*PS03W:	I mean it 's unbelievable you know th er he 's done so many breweries and yet why they do n't talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one another . 
*KBDPSUN:	Because you get people like Ben who 's giving his money he does n't really give a toss . 
*PS03W:	He do n't give a toss . 
*PS03W:	Mm . 
*PS03W:	As long as he 's got an installation going in and if it . 
*PS03W:	Yeah . 
*PS03W:	if it gets written off or . 
*KBDPSUN:	Gets bigger . 
*PS03W:	or someone has to take a a bi a co company has to take a big lot off .
