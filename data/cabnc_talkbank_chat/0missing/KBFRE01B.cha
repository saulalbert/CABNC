*PS04U:	Right so erm M and S we 'll put in . 
*PS04Y:	Yes I 'd love to think that I can struggle back with the tree But I 'm not sure that I could . 
*PS04U:	With what . 
*PS04Y:	I 'm very tempted By the time everything is packed into that bag that 's going to be heavy but on the other hand I 'm going to have taxis On Waterloo on Sunday I 'll be able to get a taxi very easily . 
*PS04U:	yeah . 
*PS04Y:	Erm if they can tie a a handle on to the tree If they 're selling them in Guildford Marks If they 're selling those imitation trees and if they 've got that wonderful one that looks like a real tree if they can say to me yes we can rope it up for you in such a way that it 's got a handle on it I could carry it back . 
*PS04U:	Well it has In the box it 's got a handle It 's one of those plastic boxes . 
*PS04Y:	Oh well there Yeah And what I 'll do is I 'll not only pack my Christmas presents into that I 'll also pack everything that 's in that little black little black bag Everything I 've brought with me . 
*PS04U:	You wo n't get it all in that . 
*PS04Y:	Well I think that probably Neil 's clothes will have to go back in a Marks and Spencers . 
*PS04U:	Right . 
*PS04Y:	one of those bags do n't you think . 
*PS04U:	Mm . 
*PS04Y:	0 . 
*PS04U:	Well I think see cos you 're gon na get alright tomorrow they 're all little things . 
*PS04Y:	They 're tiny . 
*PS04U:	Tiny things Erm see how you pack it See what you get tomorrow I mean the tree 's not desperate to get You can get it if you 've got . 
*PS04Y:	If the worst comes to the worst I can do without that I can er either buy one in Asda or somewhere or forget about it and have a fresh tree But I 've had fresh trees since I 've been in in Stowmarket and I 've I 've come to hate them They 're you know you you get the earth you Richard usually goes and gets the earth for me Drops half of it all over the carpet as he 's bringing it in . 
*PS04U:	Yes Too much bloody mess . 
*PS04Y:	And have you ever put a tree a Christmas tree in a tub and packed earth round it and got the bloody thing to stand up straight . 
*PS04U:	No No . 
*PS04Y:	Not on your nelly . 
*PS04U:	But that I mean where do you nearest M and S . 
*PS04Y:	Norwich is the best Ipswich is the nearest Norwich is the better bet because Ipswich is being redeveloped and only about a third of the space at the moment is being used for the for shopping I do n't know whether they 'll have managed by Christmas to get it all done They were expanding . 
*PS04U:	The thing to do perhaps tomorrow morning to phone Ipswich Marks to see if they 've got them in stock . 
*PS04Y:	Good idea Yeah . 
*PS04U:	But I think you 're gon na have enough to carry back . 
*PS04Y:	I think so . 
*PS04U:	without lugging that big box . 
*PS04Y:	I I do n't think I could manage it I can see fits being had by party . 
*PS04U:	presents than worry about the tree at the moment . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	Cos you 've got ta I mean . 
*PS04Y:	I love that tree I fell in love with that . 
*PS04U:	I know you did dear But you ca n't even leave it down here and pick it up later . 
*PS04Y:	No . 
*PS04U:	because it 'll be too late . 
*PS04Y:	No I I want it for Neil and Paul and even for .
