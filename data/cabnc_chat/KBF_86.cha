        And I'd go highly commended and I'll go, I'll go what do you get? •401752_407052•
        And she goes  honours and  I go well done and she goes  •407172_411132•
*BRE:	What, with her lips? •411992_413402•
*CAR:	Yeah. •413402_413512•
*BRE:	Yeah she will but I said to Tracey I said one day Carla will beat her and she said I know she will. •413512_419682•
*CAR:	And I'll do that. •419682_424092•
*BRE:	What? •424092_424302•
*CAR:	I'll do that. •424382_424862•

*CAR:	So am I. •428272_428662•
*BRE:	Tracey's very surprised. •429252_430382•
        Cos she didn't think she would. •430982_431952•
        And like well I said to her I said well then Sandy would have put it down to the fact  she did that bad in her ballet. •431952_438822•
*CAR:	Has to be a reason . •439142_440612•
*BRE:	But it's, I mean  like Tracey said are you disappointed? •440982_446212•
        I said well no I cos I said I expected a I think she deserved a more than a commended. •446212_450182•
        But I said it's always the way when you think it's a good examiner she or  she, she gives you bad results and when it's a bad, think oh an awful examiner  I mean look at that one where you got that really tough examiner and you and Jenny was the only two that got honours. •450732_468852•
        But I didn't that Michelle   •469192_470532•
*CAR:	Yeah and I know that but then  when I get the same as Jenny she goes to Leanne if we beat her yeah? •470932_475482•
        She she goes up to Leanne. •475542_476322•
*BRE:	Yeah but it's like Leanne. •477432_478632•
        I don't know how Leanne always gets  it must be the fact she's slim. •478632_482412•
        But Tracey said they this examiner  has obviously looked  •482742_486072•
*CAR:	Got any scissors? •486312_488022•
*BRE:	for slim people. •488952_491022•
        Which is wrong. •491202_492052•
*CAR:	But that's not very nice though, is it? •492102_493602•
*BRE:	No. •493602_493892•
        But that's what Tracey said. •493892_495182•
        That's what happened with her. •495532_496382•
        She went in with slim girls and they all passed, and Tracey failed. •496432_499702•
        Because Tracey was  •501802_502542•
*CAR:	But that's not a very nice thing to do though. •502542_505102•
        Because as they shouldn't fail  you if you're fat. •505102_507382•
        I'm not exactly fat. •507392_509752•
*BRE:	No, you're not fat. •510562_511592•

        You've got honours for your tap. •595672_598172•
        Yes I think you'd be more disappointed if you, if you'd taken the tap this time and you'd come out with a commended. •598172_604722•
