*PS0BS:	Oh .  300223_300513
*PS0BK:	Hey Nance Nance Nance Nance you know you were telling me that you thought someone had died at work I I sort of heard Debbie and Chris talking the other day and I might have got it totally mixed up but I reckon I heard Chris saying that well basically what I gathered was that Andy might have a different father to Chris and it was Andy 's father that 's died right Cos Chris was saying things like oh his yeah he 's been to the funeral and erm he 's all of a sudden found that he 's got loads of cousins he did n't even know about .  301443_331923
*PS0BS:	0 . 
*PS0BL:	What so he did he did n't .  331923_336423
*PS0BK:	But I wonder if I wonder if Chris and Andy cos Chris and Andy 's half brother is Steven who 's Debbie 's husband I 'm wondering if they knew that they had different fathers Cos they do n't call each other they 're half brothers .  336433_347023
*PS0BS:	Maybe yeah Well Andy 's look how Andy 's got ginger hair .  347023_355713
*PS0BK:	Mm Chris is dark and sort of like totally does n't look anything like Andy Not even one similarity Totally like .  355713_365033
*PS0BL:	And what they 're supposed to be half brothers are they .  365033_366523
*PS0BK:	No they 're supposed to be brothers .  366523_367753
*PS0BS:	But I reckon they 've probably lived like brothers from a young age Cos look how much .  367753_371203
*PS0BK:	Yeah oh yeah .  371203_371753
*PS0BS:	older Chris is than Andy as well Well he is n't that much but he 's a good nine years Nine ten eleven years older than Andy .  371753_378663
*PS0BK:	So maybe they did know .  379063_380043
*PS0BS:	Yeah I reckon they did .  380043_381693
*PS0BK:	And just sort of like did just called people .  382773_384573
*PS0BS:	Or Andy may er Andy Andy may be adopted or something like that .  384573_387293
*PS0BK:	Yeah maybe But it 's just strange that Steven 's called their half brother and they 're called brothers Do you know what I mean .  387683_393403
*PS0BS:	Well maybe yeah but maybe Steven is er is a half brother through a third marriage erm at a later stage to when they his mum er they 're er Chris' mum may have remarried who Andy calls mum erm remarried when Andy was you know fifteen and Chris was twenty five and then they and Steve was o old as well Steve was quite however o however how old Steve is he .  393403_417153
*PS0BK:	So then he 'd be a stepbrother .  417303_418173
*PS0BS:	Oh mixed up .  421743_422403
*PS0BK:	Maybe we do n't know Maybe we 're just gossiping .  422693_424953

*PS0BK:	It was funny cos I could hear them talking and I was really sort of like .  427443_430933

*PS0BK:	Yeah .  439763_439823
*PS0BS:	Cos Chris does n't seem that bothered really does he Maybe he would n't know him .  440293_444013
*PS0BK:	Mm Maybe Andy did n't know him And he just went because it was his father 's funeral But then why would he have to go to the morgue for an identification he would n't know what he looked like Maybe he 's next of kin .  444013_454943
