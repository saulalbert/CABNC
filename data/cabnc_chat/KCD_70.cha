*HEL:	Hello my pet, I don't like to see you like this. I say it's a good job we're not going to Joseph's tonight. 
*AMY:	Mhm. (  ) . 
*HEL:	Mm   (.) I think you're a bit, think you're a bit hot, that's probably what's wakening you up  (  ) . 
*AMY:	Mm. 
*HEL:	I think you've got a slight temperature, not a lot, but, just a little bit, do you think you can manage a drink of orange? Well you ought to drink something, it'll bring your temperature down and it'll help make you feel better. The only thing is to drink. 
*AMY:	Can I a little bit of orange?
