*DAV:	Yeah, I mean it's a bit, a bit naughty in a way innit? •163483_163898•
*FLO:	Yeah  •163898_163904•
*DAV:	There could be a few older people that could make  •163904_164137•
*FLO:	it could be confusing cos people •164137_164246•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Here you get •164246_164406•
*FLO:	Although it does now say on paper what party they are, it never used to •164406_164766•

*FLO:	but it does now, it does have a party as well as a name on the election paper •164803_165221•
*FRE:	Well, a lot of old folk er, I don't think they're much bothered what they say, they know the name of the candidates and they seemed to  •165293_165939•
*DAV:	that's for the name, yeah ,, some of them will be confused, but not enough for them to have any problems I shouldn't have thought. •165939_166411•
        Did you get •166711_166776•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	I think they hold the balance at the end don't they? •167002_167279•
*FRE:	Oh I think •167298_167352•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	getting in this er, seat it er •167352_167607•
*DAV:	I bet it, as regards it cut down to about five •167607_167820•
*FRE:	five, probably less •167829_168104•
*DAV:	and Freda will get in as well  •168304_168384•
*FRE:	There's no doubt who the majority will go  well most of it •168418_169216•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Powell will lose his seat •169256_169455•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	but Freeman Fry will be •169561_169694•
*FRE:	But I don't like the way he'd er, all this, all about er  how you'll be annually taxed under Labour because the truth is that even under the Conservatives, all the years they've been in, and all the years they've been reducing tax, taxes from time to time, indirect taxation increased •169923_171874•
*DAV:	Oh I know, you only got to look at the VAT ain't you for starters  •171874_172050•
*FRE:	Yeah , taxation now if anything is harder than it was in seventy nine •172050_172466•
*DAV:	Yeah •172466_172484•
*FRE:	they shouldn't talk •172654_172758•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	I, I, I'd would teach them to stand up and tell them the truth, there don't appear to be too many of them about these days •172769_173421•
*DAV:	Well it's just brought out a budget to paper over a few cracks and make it look good because they knew that, they've got no more chances this is it innit? •173453_174117•
        I think  •174123_174143•
*FRE:	Well do you think this really impress er Lisa? •174553_174763•
*DAV:	I'll have a word with her when she's awake, she's still on a third dream I should think at the moment  but she's er, certainly good talking, I could, I could try and get her without her knowing about it and see what happens, just dinner time I'll take it down and try it, oh you're gonna take it round Steve's ain't you? •174782_176786•
        Today •176880_176905•

*FRE:	Steve, you see, they often get •180798_180946•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Why, why bother about the football this afternoon? •180946_181135•
*FRE:	See he'll watch it and all •181310_181420•
*DAV:	Man City and Southampton ain't it? •181446_181657•
*FRE:	Yeah •181657_181668•
*DAV:	Yeah, don't bother me none  as long as Southampton win mind you •181668_182325•

*DAV:	He said that's half the reason that Brian Tolbrook took over at Tettron ain't it?, •191761_192094•
        I think he had his eyes, he'd got his eyes on Tettron replacing  •192136_192449•
*FRE:	Yeah  •192449_192456•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	in the league  •192456_192486•
*FRE:	he probably looked into the future a bit and decided that er  •192486_192735•
*DAV:	yeah  •192735_192756•
*FRE:	well it cost them a hundred thousand to do it, but, I mean he's never been able to afford the •192756_193281•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	yeah and he's deciding that Adam and he's deciding that Adam weren't worth it and •193281_193678•

*FRE:	went for it, but •193792_194000•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	well he apparently spoke to erm, he had quite a lengthy conversation with Ron Atkinson apparently, cos Atkinson used to be the manager of Tettron didn't he? •194009_194847•
        And he was telling them you know what a  a good club it could be, it's the ground •194970_195342•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	they opened their own ground as well you see, but that was •195342_195557•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*DAV:	and, I mean don't, he's upset that •195557_196061•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	a wound up, I mean if there was a league team like Kettering, Kettering like the fourth division, that would be brilliant  be nearer to go wouldn't it? •196061_196726•
*FRE:	Why they all have such a large ground •196726_196889•
*UNK:	 (        )

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	near a ten, near the ground size of Kettering's •199662_199923•
*DAV:	but they've got to, I remember when Rhys played in that, the F A bars quarter final, two seasons ago down here, they got well over a thousand down there then, and you just couldn't move, that were brilliant, all the way round the ground there were about four of five people deep •200041_201450•
*FRE:	there's •201450_201491•
*UNK:	 (        )
