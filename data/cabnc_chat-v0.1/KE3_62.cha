*UNK:	I'm still learning, so many things to think about when I'm driving. •204722_205147•
*JAC:	There are. •205247_205351•
*TON:	Yeah. •205390_205423•
*JAC:	For I'm afraid my  •205547_205625•
*TON:	I  •205625_205639•
*JAC:	love there are, till it becomes automatic , •205639_205864•
*TON:	Mm . •205864_205870•
*JAC:	it could take a little while. •205870_206034•
*TON:	I pulled up fairly tight behind a car •206034_206320•
*JAC:	Yeah. •206359_206374•
*TON:	and then I was trying to come out and I started to pull out into a gap and Brian said oh know, don't pull out  I said oh okay, he said the thing is your fairly tight so your gonna have to come out slowly so you need a bigger gap than otherwise. •206492_208611•
*JAC:	Yeah. •208876_208902•
*TON:	And the gap wasn't really big enough, do you know what I mean? •209270_209615•
*JAC:	Yeah. •209633_209649•
*TON:	It would off been okay if I just been able to pull out and drive down the road •209793_210210•
*JAC:	Yeah. •210269_210292•
*TON:	because I had to pull out round the stationery vehicle as well, I would off taken too long getting out •210292_210908•
*JAC:	Yeah. •210908_210921•
*TON:	and I'd have caused the other one to slow down. •211174_211365•
