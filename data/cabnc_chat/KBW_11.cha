*AND:	That's right.

*AND:	Are you? (.) Oh well  (        ) 
*DOR:	So that fits in quite well   (.) I couldn't remember what I was doing on Monday   (.) but we said, sort of tentatively Monday would be probably quite a good day   (.) I think. (.) Better than Thursday anyway. (.) So could Tuesday night be Inspector Morse night?

*DOR:	I don't think she watches it normally.
*AND:	No, she probably doesn't like it. (.) A bit spicy!
*DOR:	I bet she would, she loves anything like that! (.) Bit of a body! (.) Mind you, it might be   (.) too complicated!
*AND:	It was   (.) I remember reading in the paper   (.) that it's been   (.) it's been filmed at a house   (.) which no one 's ever been allowed to go in   (.) even the great   (.) sort of   (.) one of these country mansions, it was not Bradley Hall 
*DOR:	Right.
*AND:	And   (.) even people who write about   (        ) 
*DOR:	 [laughing] If it was not Bradley Hall , it can't be Bradley Hall  [laughing] again, they're always going in there  [] !
*AND:	Well that's fine. (.) It was some country mansion in Oxfordshire   (.) you know?
*DOR:	Mm.
*AND:	It's as you come off the  (        ) 
*DOR:	And how did 
*AND:	and 
*DOR:	they get permission then?
*AND:	They somehow managed to persuade the owners, apparently it was   (        ) and it was   (.) and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place   (.) not even   (.) erm historians who write about famous buildings, even they had been refused access!
*DOR:	Where is it?
*AND:	Somewhere in Oxfordshire.
*DOR:	Oh! (.) They don't know where?
*AND:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	Oh   (.)  (        ) . (.) So
*AND:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	this was about last week's episode?
*AND:	I think it was about last week's epi , but they seem to e  (.) imply that it was last week's episode that would
*DOR:	Oh.
*AND:	do it.
*DOR:	We seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it watched before Wednesday.
*AND:	Alright. (.) Well that's the only chance.
*DOR:	Oh yeah cos we're going to Maryland tomorrow. (        ) your dad.
*AND:	Mm.
*DOR:	Erm   (.) not it wasn't about your dad, it was about my birthday   (.) cos 
*AND:	Cos yo 
*DOR:	he'd realized that it was my birthday, and wha , what did I want? (.) So I said send me a cheque and I'll go and shop.
*AND:	And?
*DOR:	And    (.)  (        ) last week cos she's   (.) quite generous isn't she?
*AND:	She is a bit but it's  (        ) .
*DOR:	No, I didn't say anything.
*AND:	I think that's the thing.
*DOR:	So your dad sent a cheque. ((laugh))  (.) Anyway I asked her if she'd heard from your dad, and she has heard from your dad   (.) apparently on Friday   (.) he went   (.) to the   (.) consultant
*AND:	Mm.
*DOR:	and next week he's got his first   (.) well she didn't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy. (.) And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now.
*AND:	Mm.
*DOR:	I don't know how long it's going to go on for, or what it is exactly but I thought   (.) it would be a good idea to ring your dad up   (.) and see.
*AND:	Mm.
*DOR:	 (        )  (.) But at least things have moved, and at least they've gone round. (.) So I'm pleased really, are you? (.) Interesting that they've done it so quickly isn't it?After seeing him, because he thought that once   (.) he'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to   (.) get the treatment started, but they must have got themselves over that.
*AND:	Yeah. (.) Well I mean everyone  (        ) .
*DOR:	Yeah.
*AND:	I think  (        ) .
*DOR:	Gotta get moving.
*AND:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him   (.) has had tha , upset that thrombosis again. (.) I don't know whether to ring him tonight, oh it's too late tonight now.
*AND:	It's much too late.
*DOR:	Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up? (.) Well they love talking to them on the phone don't they?
*AND:	I know they do.
*DOR:	We could can prime them up on what to say   (.) and types of things to talk about   (.) so they don't get   (.) moaned down or something  (        ) ! (.) Bogged down  (        ) !
*AND:	So he's had to go in, what did you say?Three times a week?
*DOR:	I don't know   (.) she just said 
*AND:	Something like that
*DOR:	a few times a week   (.) and I think it sounded like three   (.) cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything.
*AND:	Mm   (.) a trial!
*DOR:	Well   (.) I hope not   (.) I mean no he won't be able to drive 
*AND:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	but presumably your mum can do that for, they've got hundreds of people there, he's always driving people everywhere 
*AND:	That's right.
*DOR:	so I don't see why they can't drive him! (.) I'm sure they will 
*AND:	Yes.
*DOR:	cos they're very good aren't they?I mean look at that woman doing her   (.) er    (.)  (        ) from the   (.) from the church.
*AND:	At times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer   (.) could help out.
*DOR:	It would nice if we lived there but we can't so   (.)  (        ) 
*AND:	It's   (.) about  (        ) .
*DOR:	And write as well.
*AND:	Yes.
*DOR:	Double dose.
*AND:	Yes. (.) And pulled out.
*DOR:	Well it's sort of pulled out, but at least it's  (        ) .
*AND:	We'll be paying for it as well.
*DOR:	And it's hard as well.
*AND:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	We've been paying anyway, so it must of   (.) you know. (.) What does erm   (.) you see   (.) er   (.) Eileen's    (        )  (.) and she's having chemotherapy isn't she?By me , by medication, is 
*AND:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	that right?
*AND:	Well she takes all these tablet things.
*DOR:	That's right   (.) she has a sort of   (.) massive dose every now and then. (.) And that makes her feel   (.) what? (.) She's not in pain   (        ) is she?More sort of   (.) dopey.
*AND:	I wouldn't care if they made me dazed   (        ) 
*DOR:	Yeah.
*AND:	 (        ) !
*DOR:	Yeah. (.) I dunno.
*AND:	Not gonna   (        ) 
*DOR:	Difficult to know.
*AND:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	Oh yes, that was it! (.) I wonder how bad it is, that feeling's like, we don't really know   (.) how bad it is do we?
*AND:	No.
*DOR:	Perhaps he will be able to say, you know? (.) But whether he'd tell us over the telephone, (        ) you think ask. (.) I think he would wouldn't he?
*AND:	I think so.
