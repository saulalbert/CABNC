@Comment:	conversation #4 (Tape 006404)
*NON:	Yes this beef's come out very well hasn't it?It's very tender.
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	Yes, very nice.
*NON:	Delicious.
*NON:	It's not maybe as rare as you ought to have it but it   (.) really tastes nice. (.) With disasters and all it's come out reasonably well at the end of the day.
*NON:	Did it have a disaster?
*NON:	Yes dad.
*NON:	 (        ) Oh.It's lovely.Well you've created something rather nice out of your disaster then. (.) 
*NON:	The cornflour packet didn't have much left in it.
*NON:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	The gravy's a disaster.It's got too much fat in it.
*FRE:	I didn't think it had got enough.
*NON:	Well I never put salt and pepper in my gravy so  (.) 
*NON:	If you use cornflour  (.) 
*NON:	I use cornflour and two Oxo's.
*NON:	Do you?
*NON:	Yeah.That's what I normally use.
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	If I'm then doing things, if I'm doing beef gravy I put the beef stock cube, and either one or two Oxo's to  (        ) 
*NON:	Oh.
*NON:	of cornflour.And then add all the juices from the meat.But I don't add anything else.
*NON:	 (        ) gravy we're having today.
*NON:	No.
*NON:	This is totally different.
*NON:	I never put salt and pepper in my gravy, I never have done.
*NON:	No.That's what I like, like about mum's gravy.
*NON:	But I always add all the juices from the meat.Out of the meat tin and  (.) 
*NON:	How did you do this gravy then dad?
*NON:	With difficulty.No, you've got Bovril, you've got, erm, Oxo's.   (        ) some garlic and pepper and some cornflour and then your mother had to lob in some, something else.Because we'd run out of cornflour and it was all not thick enough.
*NON:	 (        ) lob in?
*NON:	 (        ) 
*NON:	Your use of the English language in front of the microphone is extremely
*FRE:	What are you talking about?
*NON:	It's lucky I don't talk to a microphone very often.
*NON:	 (        ) a microphone over there, dad, and it's turned on.
*NON:	Oh no.
*FRE:	Nobody'll know who's speaking.
*NON:	No, well.But they will now.
*FRE:	So I don't think it matters.
*NON:	They'll  (        ) 
*FRE:	 (        ) they don't know who your dad is.
*NON:	They do.
*FRE:	They don't. (        ) 
*NON:	They know whose household this is.
*FRE:	They don't.
*NON:	They know this is the  household.
*NON:	They will now. (        ) 
*FRE:	They don't.It's under my name.
*NON:	They do now.
*FRE:	No, it's under my name.
*NON:	Yeah, but they do now that it's the  household. ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	 (        ) .Ha.
*NON:	Can I have some more Yorkshire puddings please, daddy?
*NON:	Half a one or so I suppose.
*NON:	Very nice Yorkshires John.
*NON:	Did you do them?
*NON:	Well Alex mixed the mix, I put them in the oven and Sue told me get them out or they'll burn.So it was a sort of a three way erm
*NON:	Oh I see yeah.
*NON:	thing really.
*NON:	They were only burning because you put in what was written on the packet.
*NON:	Well what's written on the packet is correct unless you have the grill not exactly red hot but about three eighty five.Twenty five minutes isn't a bad time  (        ) 
*NON:	Oh I never cook them for twenty, twenty to twenty five minutes it would be a disaster.
*NON:	Oh well.
*NON:	Nor've I. (        ) 
*NON:	I was going to say, do you cook Alexander?
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	You're interested in cooking?
*NON:	 (        ) 
*NON:	 (        ) Chinese meal the other day, didn't you?
*FRE:	Yes.
*NON:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Very   (.) very nice Chinese meal.
*NON:	What made at home, or
*NON:	Mm.
*FRE:	Yes, oh yes 
*NON:	or sent for?
*FRE:	No, he made it.
*NON:	 (        )  ((talking with mouth full))
*NON:	What stir fry and all that stuff?
*NON:	Mhm. (        ) 
*NON:	 (        ) sauces, soy sauces and things like that.
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	Then what was it?It was braised prawns   (.) er we had erm lamb, marinated lamb   (.) bits with erm erm garlic and cinnamon as well 
*NON:	Well garlic and spring onions.
*NON:	spring onions. (.) And we had erm   (.) chicken noodles with bamboo shoots.
*NON:	And mushrooms.
*NON:	And mushrooms.
*NON:	Was there anything else?We didn't do rice.
*NON:	We were going to do rice but there was   (        ) 
*NON:	Stir fry veg.
*NON:	Yeah, stir fry veg.
*NON:	What, did you do all this did you?
*NON:	Well, me and mum.
*NON:	No, (        ) operation.
*NON:	I did most of the preparation, Mum looked after what was cooking.
*NON:	 (        ) . (.) 
*NON:	It's the preparation that takes so long in Chinese cooking.
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	Well there's so many different bits to it isn't there?That's the trouble.
*NON:	When I do a Chinese meal
*NON:	It's just having everything there.
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	There's so many bits of sauce and 
*NON:	I spent about two hours measuring out all the different things.Then I put labels on about every single pot I could find that's got all these various mixes in.And I've got sort of like   (.) sweet and sour with prawns sort of   (.) er raising mix for something else.Oh gosh.
*NON:	That's what I don't like with Chinese, erm, everything's so complicated.So what you do is
*NON:	It's part of the cooking.
*NON:	yeah.You just   (.) shove everything in a pan.
*NON:	Do you go out to restaurants for a Chinese meal 
*NON:	That's what, you know when I did that er   (        ) Chinese bolognese thing.
*NON:	what?
*NON:	at all?
*NON:	We used to, (        ) .
*NON:	Do you remember when I did that Chinese bolognese thing?I made half of that up.
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	But I got the main thing off a, (        ) off a TV programme.But I couldn't get, I didn't get it all down.
*NON:	So you made up the rest?
*NON:	So I made up the rest and everyone liked it.
*NON:	You actually need a bigger kitchen to cook Chinese.
*NON:	Yeah.Because you need to set everything out.Like I did, when I did it I just    (.)  (        ) 
*FRE:	 (        ) 
*NON:	put it back   (.) well I put it back  (        ) , got that, put a bit of that in.Put a bit of everything in apart from the vegetables which I knew what to put in.
*NON:	I don't think you'd like me doing that Alex?You complain as it is about the number of dishes I use.
*NON:	Mm.
*NON:	I could imagine if I did Chinese 
*NON:	I don't use that many dishes when I do Chinese.I don't  (        ) .I just put little drops  (        ) .
*NON:	We have the same argument in this household.
*FRE:	Mhm.
*NON:	You have the what?
*NON:	Same argument in this household.
*NON:	Well I can use one bowl, but I don't I use two.
*NON:	Never use five bowls if one will do.
*NON:	When it's like pancake mix I tend, or omelettes I tend to use two bowls and even though I only really need to use one.
*NON:	Well that's silly.Why do you do that?
*NON:	 (        )  (.) 
*NON:	Where is   (        ) then?
*NON:	 (        ) 
*NON:	 (        ) oh yeah.
