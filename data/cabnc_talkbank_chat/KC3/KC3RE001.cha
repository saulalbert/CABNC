*PS0A8:	No but quite apart from that er th there 's anybody er needs to aim to be self sufficient do n't they .  82885_91715
*PS0AA:	Well I I I I think that you 've got to move in that direction rather than maintaining the status quo So erm if if it was er if it was a matter of oh bankrolling him out to wherever it was or supplementing his own resources okay but the the experience and I mean the personal experience as well as the er the skills experience .  91815_134785

*PS0A8:	No no that 's right .  289815_291875
*PS0AA:	She really has this er attitude which I can not understand because erm a a as I think it was Al Reeve said you know erm some people ca n't bear children we ca n't but we like them but if you have actually borne children you are in other words a mother you 've got ta have a attitude not only to children in general but to your children in particular which is very very difficult for er a male to understand and a non-father it 's gon na be very very difficult cos I personally do n't have any children at all and therefore it is very very difficult for me to even comprehend but given that I can erm I can sympathize with something I do not comprehend it must be monumentally difficult for her .  292465_359055

*PS0AA:	and you know once you start into into that er scenario yo yo yo you you you ca n't very very little erm opportunity for anything because all you can do is is to say what do we do now never mind what we could should or might have done then what do we do now because the future is that way and the past is .  384475_417795
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  421195_421385

*PS0AA:	and it has it has represented volumes of money which the state ca n't or wo n't or does n't carry on with So I think he 's sitting there in Wolverhampton about this time wondering what on earth he is .  526845_548905
*PS0A8:	I 'm sure he must be .  549055_551995
*PS0AA:	looking forward to and that is a very very painful situation to be in is n't it .  551995_564895
*PS0A8:	Mm .  565045_565105
*PS0AA:	I I just do n't know what he 's he 's he 's he 's he 's seeing his future as being and erm maybe cos we have n't got maybe erm it 's because of the generation gap maybe it 's because of communication problems either between me and him or the young and old or whatever but you know he just does n't seem to have anything to volunteer er other than ah well I 'll try and get a job or ah well I 'll try and get some more qualifications or whatever So yeah that 's sort of .  565855_621635
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  621955_622325
*PS0AA:	anoth another bit in the .  622325_623905
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  625455_625605
*PS0AA:	0 . 
*PS0A8:	Where whereabouts is Lyndsey in her training now .  625815_629845
*PS0AA:	Oh she 's erm tt she is the brighter spark on the horizon I suppose you know It makes me cough a bit because when I came on the scene he was the one academically everything and she was the one who was academically rather disadvantaged but she she was you know no not having the greatest of of of success but erm it was said that she would n't be able to be a student nurse because she was n't bright enough but you know she clocked up the O levels and A levels like guide badges and she went off on this pre-nursing course in South Notts you know and she was in and out of the Queens on a course and people and you know and she said I do n't know all the answers but I 've a rough idea about some of the questions I want to be a nurse and off she went to to to Walsall and I 'm not saying she 's a brilliant student nurse but erm absolutely clear that she 's better than some of the others And er you know that 's negative if you will but it 's fact .  630255_740455
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  740465_740475
*PS0AA:	and she 's still enjoying it which is great .  740625_743765
*PS0A8:	Yeah so so what year is she er third year Yeah .  744105_746935
*PS0AA:	Mm Takes her finals this this summer And erm not only er do I think that er she 'll probably be reasonably good with with finals I 'm absolutely sure that her course reports from you know all the places where she 's been will be better than most of the other candidates you know because she brings home these the these reports you know and she says it looks alright you know beginning of the course Nurse is lacking in this or has not got that or is not you know you think mm pretty the end of the course Nurse got the hang of is very good has done this has done that has supported this and you think mm pretty well that 's lovely you know but she did n't have the experience during the whatever she had been given the experience and the end of it brilliant .  746935_825735
*PS0A8:	Mm .  825845_826015
*PS0AA:	A or whatever it is you know .  827685_830915
*PS0A8:	Mm .  830955_831025
*PS0AA:	And er I I would therefore think that i it 's it 's unlikely that she 'll crash out on her exams But if she did I think she will pass out on her record because perhaps even more delightful than someone who you know sitting down to an exam and and doing reasonably well on it So I I I think that er one of the the comforting things which er I c I can see is that she has grown in self confidence not cockiness self confidence She has learnt she has absorbed inwardly digested a quantity a consid considerable quantity of it I think that she will be a reasonably useful nurse to have around .  831025_900325
*PS0A8:	Mm .  900665_900755
*PS0AA:	That 's lovely .  900755_902395
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  902405_902735
*PS0AA:	You know they they they can be a bit hard they can be a bit bitter they can drink a bit too much they can be a bit promiscuous they can be all sorts of rather iffy things but I do n't think Lyndsey will I I I I 've got I think all the evidence is building towards her being .  903225_925665
*PS0A8:	Mm .  925755_925815
*PS0AA:	a good little nurse .  925955_931415
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  931615_931735
*PS0AA:	What on earth she does then I du n no Erm mm I ca n't remember Alan and Josie 's daughter down the road erm she passed out as a nurse from Queens a while ago and you know what students are in general nurses in particular there was you would expect one hell of a party when the exam results were public what came out of the the party was when she got a job as a nurse And that is absolutely mind blowing to me .  932645_981315
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  981525_981645
*PS0AA:	because I can remember and it 's not that long ago for goodness sake that if you qualified as a nurse and will probably tell even the same story to an extent there was no problem about a job you were a certified nurse bang .  981645_998635
*PS0A8:	That 's right Well er I mean that 's not going back too far either .  998635_1004165
*PS0AA:	Well it ai n't now .  1004165_1006765
*PS0A8:	Mm .  1006775_1006785
*PS0AA:	and er er er er the situation is that you can in in some of these nursing schools where they have taught you and it is their letterhead that 's on your pass-out they still are n't in a position to say oh well there 's a job of course because you do n't need to have passed out top you know to be guaranteed a job there ai n't no jobs guaranteed for no one And er I just do n't know what to do California and Saudi Arabia are two of the you know destinations that come to mind but erm I do n't know about that either you know if she does n't .  1006785_1055175
*PS0A8:	What month does she take the exam .  1055555_1058265
*PS0AA:	Oh I er er I think it 's erm July or er June July or August it 's it 's it 's it 's .  1058265_1066745
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1066755_1066765
*PS0AA:	the summer I think she maybe takes the exams in June and gets the results in July and er then we 're fifty in August and then we go off to North America in September I think you know er I think I I ca n't quite remember the details but erm .  1066835_1084165
*PS0A8:	You 've got a holiday booked .  1084165_1086755
*PS0AA:	Yes yes .  1086755_1087155
*PS0A8:	Good .  1087155_1087515
*PS0AA:	well we 've erm we 've erm we 've been rather tempted by the west coast er I personally want to see the Grand Canyon and erm I 'd like to see San Francisco so the package which is being offered to the Boots Association with whom we 've been away several times and we lo we like it as as a as a background because you 've got a rough idea you know the people you 're going with .  1088415_1141365
*PS0A8:	Yes .  1141515_1141525
*PS0AA:	there are there are very very few who are chasing women or men and there are very very few who are er requiring to be prised out of the bar erm at two o'clock in the morning There are very very few who are er interested in finding a gambling haunt or a you know television or film theatre or whatever you know er er by and large there are a lot of people who chat to a waitress if they 're a bloke or or chat to the the whatever it is if they 're girls but er in in a in a friendly way who will have a drink but will not be paralytically drunk who may watch television or a you know film or theatre or something if it 's appropriate but wo n't get twitched if it is n't you know and and by and large erm all the people we 've we 've we 've we 've come across I came across before have been very very good company and it is it is delightful to have the have you cos have you been on a Si on a Signpost .  1141565_1218715
*PS0A8:	Yes a Signpost holiday yeah .  1219025_1222745
*PS0AA:	Yeah .  1222745_1223425
*PS0A8:	Mm .  1223475_1223875
*PS0AA:	Well er I think that getting away the oh you live in Nottingham oh fancy that you know you you know where you 're starting you know everyone either works for Boots or used to work for Boots and you know you 've got a rough idea you you you do n't need to go into the oh fancy that you know all that 's arranged so erm I think i i it 's i i i it 's the middle of September when we either go to Los Angeles I think we go to Los Angeles and fool around Hollywood and San Diego and places and down to to see a and then away off to erm Las Vegas and Flagstaff you know about this meteor crater in Flagstaff that apparently is why you go to Flagstaff tt a meteor came the meteor crater is there tt and then the Grand Canyon and go through national park which San Francisco and erm spend erm two or three days there and then come back again Tt so erm we are thinking it will be like everybody else it 's not a good idea to put too much off too far into the future .  1223875_1321375
*PS0A8:	Oh no no you want to go .  1321375_1323945
*PS0AA:	I I think well I think so And so er friends of ours he 's got muscular dystrophy and he 's sort of in the same sort of and so we we 'll have a decrepit contingent he and I will sort of and the two girls who are relatively young and healthy will go charging around and taking photographs and doing the tourist thing .  1323945_1357215
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1357215_1357295
*PS0AA:	Yes Sort of on the on the horizon for the end of the year and er I I er do n't know how we 're going to do but erm I think the answer probably is to take a chunk at a time on the basis that erm one is n't going to be able to charge around as violently actively as some people will .  1357295_1395325
*PS0A8:	Yeah yes er erm that 's oh you must because then you have the memories .  1396525_1403565
*PS0AA:	Exactly Exactly Not only does no one want to take those away no one can take them away .  1403565_1411165
*PS0A8:	That 's right .  1411165_1411705
*PS0AA:	that 's er that 's right you know and erm what I 'm saying to myself is okay you know er maybe it will be tiring I 'm sure it will maybe it will be erm expensive like take a taxi because ca n't walk you know erm erm okay .  1411705_1435055
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	that 's that 's that 's the way it is and er .  1435395_1441865
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1442085_1442165
*PS0AA:	we 'll I think be okay and provided we do n't excessively energetic and too stupid get too hot in the bath or that 's not a very good thing to do or crash out with er flu or something I dare say anyone can crash out I mean you you you could be a president of the United States .  1443105_1477305
*PS0A8:	Exactly .  1477305_1477365
*PS0AA:	and be in in Japan and you can crash out but er .  1477425_1481615

*PS0AA:	It it 's certainly looking .  1502585_1503795
*PS0A8:	Yeah I 've still got swollen fingers which I am er er I 've needed as much physio on these as on on the finger that was done .  1503805_1514515
*PS0AA:	Why was that .  1514515_1515265
*PS0A8:	They just swoll sw swelled up and erm I do n't know why but I 'm told it 's not unusual .  1515455_1523815
*PS0AA:	Mm Because of the the tinkering around it must do a bit of .  1524835_1529255
*PS0A8:	And erm but as I say I I I have I still have n't got full use of those .  1529255_1534685
*PS0AA:	Are they are they coming .  1534685_1539675
*PS0A8:	Yes I yes they are er but I seem to have reached a a stage where they 're not progressing as much as I would like you know They 're they 're oh they 're vastly improved .  1539675_1552655
*PS0AA:	0 . 
*PS0A8:	to to I mean when I first had the er plaster off which was for ten days it was I could not believe it that these fingers were not going but I 'm told that that 's quite usual .  1552655_1566635

*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1572455_1572925
*PS0AA:	it 's been tinkered around with I mean I do n't .  1572925_1574795
*PS0A8:	Yes but er I think i it 's a combination of things it 's the fact that you 've got your erm hand in plaster so your fingers are not moving and you lose muscle tone so quickly .  1574805_1586345
*PS0AA:	Mm Particularly with something which is otherwise in .  1586585_1590875

*PS0AA:	Channels .  1984235_1984805
*PS0A8:	Four .  1985225_1985535

*PS0A8:	is different to Oracle .  1986495_1987995
*PS0AA:	Oracle .  1988425_1988775
*PS0A8:	er is well is different to er er channel three I think they 're probably both Oracle .  1988775_1994935
*PS0AA:	Oh so it 's just .  1994935_2005475
*PS0A8:	Yeah but in other words what I 'm saying is that there are diff .  2005475_2008725
*PS0AA:	It 's three page hundreds .  2008725_2009485
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  2009485_2010055
*PS0AA:	that you 've got to look at .  2010885_2011935
*PS0A8:	Yes yes yes yes Erm .  2011935_2014605

*PS0AA:	Aha .  2032705_2032845
*PS0A8:	so and and you will see that 's that er I do n't know whether some are all the same but erm there are different yeah you know erm in other words what I 'm saying is they 're not on both channels .  2034265_2050625
*PS0AA:	So they 're I do n't know whether it 's i it 's terribly reactionary to say that we really want one teletext cos your holidays might they be coming up on Ceefax .  2050625_2068055
*PS0A8:	No no i it 's pur it 's all .  2069835_2072725
*PS0AA:	Oracle .  2072965_2073105
*PS0A8:	Oracle yeah cos it 's an advertisement I mean the people who are er er it is er being paid for by the people who advertise it Yeah .  2073135_2082185
*PS0AA:	Yeah I I think you 'll find that erm when the colour er when B B C Two came along and all the aerials went to U H F we went from a four O five line .  2083795_2106435
*PS0A8:	That 's right .  2106575_2107165
*PS0AA:	to a six two five .  2107165_2108695
*PS0A8:	Something .  2108695_2108845
*PS0AA:	line and I think you 'll find that now there are in fact six two three lines of television information and there are two lines which are dedicated to carrying teletext data .  2108955_2125755
*PS0A8:	Oh .  2126475_2126645
*PS0AA:	and I think that 's where the there 's no sound is there .  2126645_2130015
*PS0A8:	No you get the sound of the erm the programme .  2130015_2135895
*PS0AA:	Oh really .  2135895_2137475
*PS0A8:	Oh yes if you you no you get the sound if I erm s say I 've got Oracle erm channel three on and I switch to text I will still get the sound of the television programme .  2137475_2150755
*PS0AA:	Ah I see Which will be confusing .  2151315_2155075
*PS0A8:	Well you can mute it if you want you see .  2155075_2157795
*PS0AA:	Yes of course yes of course .  2157795_2158145
*PS0A8:	And you can mix it You you can have your erm if you were watching a programme and er I 've done this erm if you 're watching a programme and you want to see what the weather forecast is er you can have that superimposed on your programme And and the other way .  2159035_2180905
*PS0AA:	What in a in a .  2180905_2181835
*PS0A8:	No no over the top .  2181835_2183755
*PS0AA:	Over the top .  2183755_2184585
*PS0A8:	Over the top .  2184585_2185375
*PS0AA:	Oh I see .  2185375_2185895
*PS0A8:	And the other thing erm which er er is good supposing you 're watching er a programme and there 's a football match on and you 're interested in the the football er but you do n't really want to keep you know switching to find out what the score is er I 'm talking about teletext as opposed to a programme you press the update and it w er and if something 's happened you know they 've changed and there 's been a score it 'll come up er er while you 're watching the programme er it 'll let you know that erm there 's been something happening Er it 's it 's amazing .  2185895_2226125
*PS0AA:	I do n't know what that is It 's not you is it .  2226715_2238515

*PS0AA:	Ah might be It might be Yes that that sounds like it .  2244275_2255985
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  2255985_2258015
*PS0AA:	Yes the erm these things an and can you er can you record teletext .  2258885_2266475

*PS0A8:	Do n't know .  2294105_2301015
*PS0AA:	Because the data you see the two lines I would have thought would have been recorded .  2301015_2309375
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	without you meaning it to be recorded .  2309615_2314675
*PS0A8:	Ah well I can let me er say this er you you know how some programmes er you can have erm oh you may not know excuse me erm there are certain programmes which you can er put in eight eight eight and you get captions .  2314675_2338965
*PS0AA:	Ah ye yes i if that 's available .  2339165_2341735
*PS0A8:	If it 's available .  2342515_2343355
*PS0AA:	Yes yes .  2343355_2343895
*PS0A8:	Erm now if you record that programme and then on video and then play it back you ca n't put in eight eight eight and get it .  2344885_2357575
*PS0AA:	Oh Mm i it I I I I d I du n no as I say i i it it it seems to me to be an incredibly clever .  2357575_2370845
*PS0A8:	You would enjoy it .  2373465_2374975
*PS0AA:	arrangement .  2374975_2375215
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah yeah .  2375255_2375975
*PS0AA:	But erm The television of course i is infernally clever I mean th there 's er no doubt that the microchips that erm takes away the erm the teletext information stores it and then spits up whatever you ask for is er two or three P now I suppose and therefore the the television manufacturer charges hundred pounds to put it in .  2375975_2416585
*PS0A8:	Mm .  2416855_2416975
*PS0AA:	It 's er it 's you 're you 're you 're you 're quite erm hooked on it .  2417385_2426415
*PS0A8:	Ah well yes I would n't like to be without it now Definitely not .  2426415_2431175
*PS0AA:	And is is there much difference between er Ceefax and Oracle .  2431175_2439295
*PS0A8:	Well .  2439335_2439485
*PS0AA:	They look more or less the same do they .  2443375_2446175
*PS0A8:	Yeah I mean the news is very similar of course erm .  2446365_2450275
*PS0AA:	Presumably that 's indicated or is it Du n no because I think it is n't actually come to think of it B B C will do their own and I T V will do their own .  2450585_2460835
*PS0A8:	Oh yeah oh it 's definitely their own yes Yeah Yeah So I 'm a bit of a newshound so I look at both of course see what 's what I 'm er I 'm not saying I the headlines you see so I will select the headline I 'm interested in .  2460835_2479725
*PS0AA:	And would .  2479725_2483525
*PS0A8:	And then it 'll come up you know I 'll put in w er one O two is the headlines for Ceefax for instance and then the stories will be from one O three to about one one five or something like that you see And er th so er if I 'm interested in er George Bush 's illness you know and that 's one O four I 'll put in one O four and then that will come up on the screen .  2484035_2511135
*PS0AA:	So presumably wh wh what bank are you with .  2511195_2519315
*PS0A8:	What I 'm with Barclays .  2519655_2523345
*PS0AA:	Oh I suspect they 're you bank with totally ignorable If you 're with er National Westminster erm y y y y you you you know about these these these cash tills that you put a card in and .  2523345_2545845
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  2547105_2547185
*PS0AA:	ask it questions it 's obviously on the telephone because you can ask what the balance is and it will tell you and it ca n't possibly know that and Cleethorpes when you put the card in the Cleethorpes thing that you know your bank balance at Nottingham is so it 's obviously on the telephone erm and it 's on the telephone to a central computer which holds quite a lot of information it accesses .  2547575_2574425
*PS0A8:	Quite .  2574425_2574635
*PS0AA:	it very very quickly .  2574635_2575935
*PS0A8:	That 's right yeah .  2575935_2576805
*PS0AA:	so why should n't you telephone that computer And the answer is no reason at all And if you 're with National Westminster you telephone a a n a number in Manchester or Birmingham or two or three other places I guess but as far as we 're concerned er the Birmingham Manchester one 's the cheapest you you ring them up and you give them A your identification number and it immediately tells you what your balance is Immediately What do you want to do Well of course there 's a whole range of things you can order you know chequebooks and bank statements you can do all s all sorts of things .  2576805_2625455
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah yeah .  2625615_2625935
*PS0AA:	you can do with the till in the wall .  2625935_2629485
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  2629485_2630025
*PS0AA:	but you can also say I want a transaction too and the machine then comes back to you with one of these sepulchral voices you know which is tone .  2630025_2641485
*PS0A8:	Yes .  2641945_2642105
*PS0AA:	generated or whatever who do you wish to pay to and we have four erm electricity board the gas board the er er er credit card and the ca n't remember what the fourth one is you simply say I wan na pay number four how much do you wish to pay to the Royal Bank of Scotland and you say how much you wish to pay in er in pence and it immediately says you wish to pay blah blah blah it will be done Couple of days later a little note comes in the post saying that you 've just paid the National West National Bank Bank of Scotland twenty three pounds thirty and it 's absolutely brilliant Barclays have n't got one yet .  2642105_2702565
*PS0A8:	Well er er I think not because I would have heard I mean obviously they would 've er .  2702585_2707345
*PS0AA:	Well er Nat West have been very quiet about Action Line erm because they have n't quite got the the the all the firmware sorted out yet but it 's absolutely fantastic you know .  2707495_2723645

*PS0AA:	it 's just just erm but i i i er er have you got a a tone telephone or a pulse telephone It 's probably a switch .  2723855_2736465
*PS0A8:	I 've got several .  2736465_2736975
*PS0AA:	Well erm probably on the back you can select whether it er sends a number by pulse and you can tell actually cos it 's very you d you 'll dial .  2736975_2754225
*PS0A8:	Well the old dial was pulse was .  2754245_2755875

*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  2759475_2759975
*PS0AA:	but some push button telephones send one as one pulse and two as two pulses .  2760245_2770335
*PS0A8:	Yes .  2770335_2770785
*PS0AA:	whereas others send wuls er one as a beep and two as a ooh .  2770995_2776915

*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah yeah yeah I think mine are erm the pulse type mm .  2780375_2784305
*PS0AA:	Well usually erm modern telephones have got a switch on the back and you can switch them to pulse or tone .  2785055_2791675
*PS0A8:	Oh I do n't think mine have .  2791675_2794435
*PS0AA:	One of those four switches across the top is the pulse tone .  2798755_2803275
*PS0A8:	Oh yeah I can see that Yeah .  2804115_2812345
