*CHR:	Happy with it all?
*CHR:	I don't know but to be truthful I am not hundred percent sold on any of it.
*LYN:	Oh I'm sorry about that.Because I like them all.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	That's correct.
*CHR:	May I look at that please?
*CHR:	With the pads in I feel square on the top.If I could take them out.
*LYN:	Just a moment, may I?They don't look harsh.
*CHR:	To me they are too wide.
*LYN:	Alright to me they don't look harsh.You know they don't sort of poke up in the air like shoulders sometimes do.
