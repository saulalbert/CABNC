*MAR:	Oh •52775_52925•
*TER:	so I got four more, had a look round thought I saw it, but Traygo was heaving  I tried to park by the erm garden centre, but to not only were there people all parked there, there was a great articulated lorry delivering stuff, so you went in and you couldn't even then get out, go and park further up •53935_82445•

*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	I am Mrs  who's sort of the secretary and books, does the booking for the hall, he couldn't get that, anyway it occurred to me afterwards it must of been the grandmother of that girl that bought the erm, cos he kept on talking a Michelle and  that's the girl that bought our suite and I reckon it's her child's birthday party, she said erm  you know my, you know my son-in-law, I said do I? •133585_172449•
