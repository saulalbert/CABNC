*CLA:	It's not too bad finding  where you want to go •562092_565252•
*NIN:	Mm. •565412_565472•
*CLA:	when it comes to looking for x-ray or path lab or whatever it is  but finding your way out. •565472_570912•
        Very seldom they have continuing  er continuity  of markers saying exit, you know, or this way out. •570912_579952•
*NIN:	Wouldn't it, it's stupid that  •579952_582042•
*CLA:	Mm. •582042_582182•
*NIN:	isn't it? •582182_582552•
        You can't get out quick enough can you, usually? •582552_584112•
*CLA:	Not short on the emergency exit signs, but yeah exactly. •584112_587212•
        Mm. •587212_587512•
        I mean  once you've got in. •588652_593672•
        But once you've gone down and turned left then turned right and gone ahead   •593672_597072•
*NIN:	Mm. •597072_597272•
*CLA:	It's like a labyrinth  you know . •597302_599442•
*NIN:	I know. •599442_599772•
        Certainly if you've not been before. •599772_601582•
*CLA:	Mm. •601582_602002•
        Mm. •602002_602362•
        Exactly. •602362_602812•
        I asked somebody the way out  and she offered to show me . •604022_614342•
        Mm. •614342_614492•
*NIN:	Oh! •615202_615332•

*CLA:	Yes I remember you saying. •625462_626342•
        Oh it would be of course, yeah. •626342_627612•
        Mm oh it would be. •629632_631562•
        It's quite a, it seems at least quite a pleasant hospital. •632122_634272•
        Quite a pleasant atmosphere. •634272_635662•
*NIN:	Mm. •635662_636102•
*CLA:	Mm. •636382_636612•
*NIN:	I shouldn't imagine they have the problems that they do at erm Withamshaw and   •636802_643462•
*CLA:	oh  no, they won't of course. •644092_645342•
        Oh no. •645462_645672•

*CLA:	What? •649612_649852•
*NIN:	when Carolyn was working there they had this intruder. •651852_654292•
*CLA:	Well they're often having intruders,go on  •654292_657342•
*NIN:	I can't remember all the details. •657342_660122•
        There was quite a to-do about it in the paper. •660122_662882•
*CLA:	Mm. •663392_663492•
*NIN:	I, I know Carolyn said that they  in the end •663522_671592•
*CLA:	Yeah. •671592_671672•
*NIN:	they refused to work on their own •671672_674272•
*CLA:	Oh that's right I remember. •674292_674802•
        Yes yes. •675832_676272•
        Yeah. •676272_676392•
*NIN:	because they were so way out. •676392_677212•
        There was no way •677212_678172•
*CLA:	Mm. •678172_678412•
*NIN:	that they could have summoned help or anything else. •678412_680802•
*CLA:	Mm. •680802_681222•

*NIN:	Pardon? •686652_687022•
*CLA:	Didn't she well, to get from A to B  didn't she have to leave the building somewhere? •687092_692582•
*NIN:	Yes. •693032_693362•
        Yeah. •693442_693812•
*CLA:	Yeah I thought so. •693952_694432•
        Mm. •694432_694532•
        They're not too bad here but at Withamshaw it'd be a   different kettle of fish altogether . •695822_704002•
*NIN:	Er yes. •704082_704632•
*CLA:	Mm. •704632_704692•

*NIN:	Wasn't he? •755752_756452•
*CLA:	Mm. •756462_756472•
*NIN:	And Nicky wanted to, it was only  a cock's stride down the road. •756692_762432•
        Andrew was in bed and she just whipped out so Nicky could say goodnight to her daddy. •762432_766552•
*CLA:	Oh yes, that's right . •766552_768272•
        Mm. •768282_768292•

*NIN:	Mm. •778152_778162•
        It's very handy. •778162_779562•
        Having to go to the end of the road, well it's daft now. •779592_781872•
        That's if you can find one working. •781982_783472•
*CLA:	Not too bad here from what I've seen. •783472_785812•
*NIN:	No. •785822_785832•
*CLA:	No. •785832_786102•
*NIN:	No but I mean in Manchester it was shocking wasn't it? •786412_788762•
*CLA:	Oh well! •788772_788862•
        It was a very pleasant surprise if there is one working. •788862_794942•
        Mm. •796602_796972•
*NIN:	You know I was just thinking •801382_815752•
*CLA:	Were you? •815782_816432•
        Jolly good. •817092_817302•
*NIN:	That well  Lil and Nev going up on the mini break •817902_820802•
*CLA:	tomorrow is it they go? •820852_822612•
*NIN:	Yeah Wednesday to Saturday, yes. •822702_824782•
*CLA:	Mm go on. •824782_826012•
*NIN:	I'll bet they hear of these mini breaks through the I can't remember  •826012_829802•
*CLA:	She probably  •829922_830162•
*NIN:	her name. •830162_830662•
*CLA:	Was it Carol? •830662_831352•
        No it's not Carol. •831352_832242•
*NIN:	No. •832242_832402•
        No it's •832402_833062•
*CLA:	I don't know what her name is but  I know the one you mean. •833062_834802•
        The travel agency girl? •834802_835552•
*NIN:	Mm. •835552_835882•
*CLA:	Young woman, yeah. •836052_836582•
*NIN:	I wouldn't be surprised. •837002_838322•
*CLA:	Probably. •838322_838522•
        Mm. •838522_839102•
        Mm. •840012_840272•
        I'm wondering what  made them change their mind  over the er knock through into the garage. •840872_851512•
*NIN:	Well I suppose they thought it was a bit too much. •851512_854572•
        I mean the place they've got there, it er  it would mean  •854832_858692•
*CLA:	Oh I'm not  •858692_859052•
*NIN:	that them decorating  •859072_860092•
*CLA:	I know. •860092_860562•
*NIN:	the whole lot again wouldn't it? •860562_861982•
*CLA:	Mm. •861982_862112•
*NIN:	Oh no way. •862112_862792•
*CLA:	Yes but surely they thought that through before they got to the stage that  I mean even with the mortgage  •862792_867822•
*NIN:	Well that's probably why they've decided against it. •867822_870312•
*CLA:	No. •870312_870372•
        Before  they got to the stage of asking for quotes because Nev had moved all his tools and tackle and stuff  to clear it. •870372_879772•
*NIN:	Had they really had a quote? •879772_881912•
*CLA:	I don't know. •882462_882832•
        I really don't know. •882832_883482•
*NIN:	Mm. •883482_883542•
*CLA:	They were due to get one. •883542_884752•
        Any time. •884752_885942•
*NIN:	They might have had one and found out what  it was going to cost and were decided against . •885942_888802•
*CLA:	Possibly. •888802_889182•
*NIN:	They're having a mini break instead. •889182_891092•
*CLA:	Oh possibly  again it's just possible actually that  the construction of the bungalow didn't lend itself properly well to  knocking through. •891092_897982•
*NIN:	Well I think  oh well it's so beautiful I mean as it is in there, they don't need anything doing to, I mean  •898142_904562•
*CLA:	Well  •904562_904792•
*NIN:	they've got it nice. •904792_905412•
        They've got it  so they don't get sort of minimum  you know? •905412_909092•
*CLA:	Labour. •911152_911422•
*NIN:	Yes. •912222_912412•
        So I shouldn't imagine that erm  I mean once we've got through this one I'm blowed if I'm going to do it  •913912_922232•
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	just for the sake of doing it. •922232_923392•
        It'll have to really need it before we start again . •923392_924652•
*CLA:	Well mm. •924652_925332•
        Oh yeah I know. •925412_926122•
        But they, they are a little bit inclined to what shall we spend some money on next, aren't they? •926122_929252•
*NIN:	Mm. •929252_929332•
*CLA:	Mm. •929332_929412•
*NIN:	Well if it's there fair do. •931572_932922•
*CLA:	Oh! •932922_933192•
        Fair do, I know but er  it's up to them what they do with their money I know but  mm. •933402_936472•
*NIN:	What's happened to the rest of the paper Larry? •937412_946562•
        There's only half of it there. •946562_947782•
*CLA:	Well which paper ? •947782_948332•
*NIN:	The Telegraph. •948332_949782•
        Last week's Telegraph. •949872_950872•
        There's only one  •950872_951662•
*CLA:	I haven't the faintest idea. •951662_952252•
*NIN:	sheet there. •952252_952552•
        Just one  •952602_952822•

*CLA:	Oh. •955492_955972•
        I don't know . •956162_956472•

*NIN:	It's just disappeared. •958602_959002•
*CLA:	I haven't moved it at all. •959002_960002•
        Not knowingly anyway. •960262_961622•
        No. •961622_961782•
        It's possible I've used it but I don't erm  don't recall. •963062_968452•
        Never had an occasion to use, well the only time I've used a newspaper as far as I know  this afternoon when I emptied the bag. •968452_973602•
        And that was •973602_975142•
*NIN:	Because we were going to phone up •975142_976112•
*CLA:	Yeah I know. •976112_976302•
*NIN:	the piece at  with the  •977032_979512•
*CLA:	Yes. •979512_979572•
*NIN:	housing in. •979572_980122•
*CLA:	Yes for the er •980262_981052•
*NIN:	We were going to phone up and that seems to have  •981052_982942•
*CLA:	the two bungalows yeah. •982942_983712•
        Mm. •983712_983842•
        It is incidentally . •983842_984192•
        It's where I thought it was. •984192_985522•
*NIN:	Is it? •985522_986082•
*CLA:	On the left hand side  and erm  it's  pretty near the main road. •986082_992572•
*NIN:	Mm. •992572_992872•
        Oh I know where you mean. •993492_994742•
*CLA:	Oh you do? •994812_995642•
*NIN:	I think I do anyway. •995642_996332•
*CLA:	The area . •996332_996642•
*NIN:	Mm. •996642_997002•
        I thought it was on the main road? •998992_999882•
*CLA:	It is on the main road. •999882_100108•
*NIN:	Oh I see what you mean, the front's pretty near the main road? •100108_100406•
        Would that bother them do you think, being so close to the main  •100430_100655•
*CLA:	I don't know Nina. •100655_100713•
        I haven't the faintest idea. •100713_100831•
*NIN:	Cos it looks quite a decent  reasonable bungalow. •100831_101024•
        I wonder how much they want for it? •101024_101156•
*CLA:	I I could only glanced at it as I drove past cos the traffic was  moving fairly quickly for the lights there you know. •101156_101626•
        But  •101632_101652•
*NIN:	Mm. •101652_101672•
        I bet the layout's something similar to that one we saw  further . •101672_101880•
*CLA:	Probably. •101983_101998•
        There's not much of a difference between •102002_102186•
*NIN:	No, it looks the same shape somehow doesn't it? •102188_102450•
*CLA:	No. •102456_102470•
        Mm, yeah yeah. •102470_102821•
        fairly tight. •102821_102866•
*NIN:	But that, they're, the one that •102866_103061•
*CLA:	Sorry, go on. •103061_103298•
*NIN:	we went to er look at, four of them, in the middle of er the three. •103298_103689•
*CLA:	Oh yeah. •103698_103731•
        Whereabouts was that? •103770_103812•
*NIN:	There was four  four it was in the middle. •103835_104004•
        The girl that works at the garage,next door to that. •104071_104288•
*CLA:	Oh not a bungalow, a house you mean? •104302_104492•
        Sorry, yeah. •104492_104555•
*NIN:	A house. •104566_104586•
        Well that one, I mean everybody said oh  that's too near to the main road so if that was too near to the main road so will this one be. •104586_105293•
*CLA:	Well did Carolyn say that? •105293_105454•
        I can't remember. •105454_105483•
*NIN:	No Dawn said. •105548_105593•
        Neither can I. •105593_105649•
*CLA:	Well Dawn thought it was. •105649_105807•
        I certainly thought it was. •105807_105917•
        But then  •105917_105943•
*NIN:	I know. •105956_106015•
        I didn't. •106015_106039•
*CLA:	I don't like traffic noise. •106040_106175•
*NIN:	It yes it, I'd, it wouldn't have bothered me that. •106175_106386•
*CLA:	Mm. •106420_106443•
        Mm. •106443_106454•
*NIN:	But it, I can quite see that it would bother some people. •106454_106671•
*CLA:	Mm. •106676_106723•
        Mm. •106738_106771•
*NIN:	But it's not as if it's a main road like •106790_107199•
*CLA:	Oh crikey, no. •107206_107390•
*NIN:	in Manchester is it ? •107390_107521•

*NIN:	Mm? •160475_160505•
*CLA:	the name of the manufacturer and possibly the  say the model like the  that particular paper's  erm category  name. •160624_161391•
        But it had  at about oh eighteen inch intervals, something like that? •161471_161890•
        Little marks, sometimes an arrow  sticking out. •161890_162212•
        When you, when you put the next roll on you married up the arrow. •162212_162460•
*NIN:	Oh. •162460_162475•

*NIN:	Oh yes. •164368_164411•
*CLA:	Mm. •164436_164439•
*NIN:	Things have changed a bit. •164439_164793•
*CLA:	Yes. •164802_164805•
        I don't quite know why they put that edge on in the first place. •164813_165176•
*NIN:	No. •165176_165205•
*CLA:	Unless it was, in those days, they didn't have the shrink wrap stuff did they? •165205_165769•
*NIN:	I think they used to overlap them one edge didn't they? •165769_166060•
*CLA:	Oh didn't I was just thinking yeah. •166061_166122•
*NIN:	That's right. •166137_166233•
*CLA:	Oh it was standard to, yeah a standard practice job that, yeah. •166234_166417•

*CLA:	Oh yes of course. •166546_166562•

*CLA:	Oh god . •166906_166946•
*NIN:	about a mile don't they? •166946_167083•
*CLA:	Well this particular paper, you  you've got to be very  •167084_167408•
*NIN:	I don't like it. •167456_167501•
*CLA:	otherwise it crushes  very easily. •167501_167593•
*NIN:	Mm. •167668_167693•
        I don't like it. •167693_168030•
*CLA:	Mm. •168053_168065•
        No. •168065_168071•
        It's not my favourite  by any means. •168071_168163•
*NIN:	We'll have to go and be having a look at  at erm •168181_168668•
*CLA:	What? •168708_168720•
*NIN:	choose a paper for the room where we're doing now. •168720_169017•
*CLA:	Yes, there's a bit more plastering to be done yet. •169017_169241•
*NIN:	Not a lot though is there? •169241_169380•
*CLA:	Not a lot, no. •169388_169442•
        I want to skim that corner, ceiling and the top of the wall. •169442_169728•
        Erm •169728_169734•
*NIN:	And strip all the little   •169734_170130•
*CLA:	and  there's also there's a  usual crack between the plasterboard and ceiling over the door and a little crack running down to the door. •170154_170803•
*NIN:	Is there? •170803_170826•
*CLA:	yeah. •170826_170832•
        It's worth doing. •170853_170914•
*NIN:	Oh yes. •170914_170953•
*CLA:	Mm. •170953_170965•

*CLA:	Mm. •171170_171193•
        Oh yes. •171339_171405•
        And there's all the burning off and  mm. •171405_171625•
        And also I want to, while the  carpet's up, investigate the run of the cable. •171908_172347•
        So it's  •172347_172524•
*NIN:	And have you any idea yet? •172524_172624•
*CLA:	About? •172624_172638•
*NIN:	Where the cable runs? •172638_172919•
*CLA:	Yes. •172919_172941•
        Yeah, yeah. •172941_172992•
        I think it's a spur coming off  that runs into the er  But I don't think it's a proper immersion heater circuit. •173004_173776•
*NIN:	You're joking? •173804_173843•
*CLA:	Well it doesn't have to be. •173939_174132•
*NIN:	Should it be? •174132_174165•
        Oh. •174165_174171•
*CLA:	No it doesn't have to be. •174171_174224•
        No no no. •174224_174258•
        No. •174258_174274•
        No. •174333_174344•
*NIN:	There's a  a mark on the wall, you know where the switch is  where you switch the pump on and off? •174432_175227•
*CLA:	Er  yes. •175227_175340•
*NIN:	Well there's a mark on the wall. •175340_175487•
        Something's been on the wall that was round. •175487_175653•
*CLA:	Yes. •175653_175693•
        That would be erm  the junction box. •175789_175994•
        Mm. •175994_176013•
*NIN:	Why would they need another junction box there then? •176154_176455•
        Cos there's one down at the bottom. •176461_176667•
*CLA:	To feed I would suspect the immersion heater. •176667_176871•
        Mm. •176908_176927•
*NIN:	Oh. •177027_177046•
*CLA:	Mm. •177143_177146•
*NIN:	Well what have they taken it off for then? •177193_177425•
        Oh they wouldn't need, they wouldn't  mm. •177425_177500•
*CLA:	Because you, when you have your cable up to the junction, hang on up to your junction box •177500_177745•
*NIN:	Yeah. •177770_177790•
*CLA:	and from the junction box to the actual immersion heater itself •177790_178006•
*NIN:	Yeah. •178006_178051•
*CLA:	you have erm  a heatproof cable called er systaflex I think it's called. •178193_178549•
*NIN:	Mm. •178552_178564•
*CLA:	Yeah. •178607_178613•
        Er  it's sort of a white, braided stuff that goes over. •178630_179200•
*NIN:	Mm. •179200_179224•
*CLA:	Heat resistant. •179229_179304•
*NIN:	Mm. •179304_179336•
*CLA:	So you'd need a junction box to erm connect the  •179439_179652•
*NIN:	Well you know how they've  you know where the pipe comes out of the  cupboard? •179652_179974•
*CLA:	Hang on. •180016_180062•
        There are a lot of pipes. •180062_180106•
*NIN:	No, the the pipe that I I think  supposedly leads to the radiator. •180106_180584•
*CLA:	Erm •180594_180662•
*NIN:	And it comes down under that little •180772_180963•
*CLA:	do you mean the one with the pump in? •180963_181112•
*NIN:	Yes. •181114_181121•

*NIN:	By the wall, and it  •181412_181618•
*CLA:	Oh. •181618_181629•
*NIN:	comes into that little erm  ooh the sort of semi  skirting board thing. •181629_182191•
*CLA:	Erm •182193_182220•
*NIN:	That stands away from the wall. •182276_182388•
*CLA:	offhand I can't say yes I do but  •182395_182736•
*NIN:	Well it it's flat and then it comes down. •182736_182920•
        You've got your skirting board •182923_183038•
*CLA:	Flat and then it comes down . •183038_183189•
*NIN:	It houses  pipes. •183230_183319•
        And it's  •183380_183621•
*CLA:	Oh you you mean in the room? •183622_183696•
*NIN:	Yeah. •183696_183729•
*CLA:	Yes but I mean which pipe you mean, no. •183729_183854•
*NIN:	Well I don't know the pipe. •183863_183985•

*CLA:	Oh it's in the  oh sorry, go on. •184115_184240•
        Carry on. •184240_184281•
*NIN:	No. •184281_184287•
        This thing  but er er the pipe comes from the  cupboard. •184287_184569•
        You can see it  •184569_184691•
*CLA:	If there's a pipe or pipes  cupboard yeah. •184691_184904•
*NIN:	I dunno but it  you can see it coming through •184909_185164•
*CLA:	Mm. •185164_185175•
*NIN:	and it  into that housing •185176_185290•
*CLA:	Yeah. •185314_185363•
        Yeah. •185377_185393•
*NIN:	and then it comes right round to the radiator •185463_185606•
*CLA:	Yes I know, yeah. •185606_185710•
*NIN:	and goes right to that wall doesn't it? •185710_185830•
*CLA:	Yes. •185830_185838•
        Yeah yeah. •185838_185857•

        Yeah. •185865_185871•
*NIN:	Well why would it need  if that, if  it does that, when it gets to the radiator •185878_186415•
*CLA:	Oh it's not just for the radiator. •186427_186620•
*NIN:	Oh. •186620_186657•
        I see   •186716_186741•
*CLA:	It's the hot water to the tap in the kitchen. •186741_186878•
*NIN:	Oh I see. •186878_187063•
*CLA:	That's right, yeah. •187082_187120•
*NIN:	As well. •187120_•
        Well what I was looking at this afternoon  was your radiator  comes through the floor. •187209_187988•
        And yet all these pipes are here. •187999_188181•
        Why isn't  why  wouldn't they take erm  your radiator pipe  the water, the pipe that feeds the radiator? •188181_188824•
*CLA:	Mm. •188824_188860•
        Mm. •188860_188868•
*NIN:	Why wouldn't it come through  that little housing? •188868_189088•
        Instead of coming under the floor? •189226_189335•
*CLA:	Well again that's not original is it? •189335_189492•
        The central heating  system is er  a later addition to the house isn't it? •189492_190107•
*NIN:	Oh. •190197_190203•
*CLA:	And those pipes were where the circs where the, the  where the pipe run to the hot water tap in the kitchen. •190203_190781•
        And to the bathroom. •190781_190839•
*NIN:	Oh. •190839_190875•
*CLA:	Mm. •190916_190919•
        And quite probably the cold water supply to the bathroom too. •190980_191385•
        Mm. •191385_191391•
*NIN:	Mm. •191535_191549•
*CLA:	And I think  not the kitchen, that's on the rising main. •191549_191902•
        Cos your stop tap is  underneath the er •191902_192266•
*NIN:	Mm. •192266_192269•
*CLA:	sink top there. •192269_192444•
        . But that one there is er   fed, I'm pretty sure  from  the, yes it is. •192444_193467•
        Yeah because the pipe goes up there. •193467_193710•
        Mm. •193714_193724•
*NIN:	Oh yes of course. •193745_193868•
        It goes right through to the bathroom doesn't it? •193907_194140•
        That's it. •194140_194165•
*CLA:	And, if you think about it, there's a header tank  in the loft. •194168_194418•
*NIN:	Yes. •194418_194439•
*CLA:	the cold water from somewhere. •194466_194678•
*NIN:	Mm. •194684_194727•
*CLA:	So it'll come from there  across the ceiling •194738_195045•
*NIN:	Mm. •195045_195088•
*CLA:	across the ceiling  up through the erm  cupboard •195103_195481•
*NIN:	Yeah. •195537_195568•
*CLA:	into the into the loft and . •195611_195767•
*NIN:	Mm. •195785_195802•
*CLA:	Mm. •195925_195950•
        So  you'll have the hot water pipe  to supply the hot tap •195950_196310•
*NIN:	Mm. •196310_196319•
*CLA:	taps. •196319_196336•
        And the cold water feeds by the er header tank in the loft. •196342_196726•
*NIN:	Mm. •196726_196741•
        Well why wouldn't they take them underneath the floor? •196800_196989•
        They could of, couldn't they, up there? •196996_197349•
*CLA:	Yes they certainly could. •197357_197645•
        But at the time of building I think it was  just continued practice from the victorian days to run it round on the top. •197645_198286•
        Mm. •198297_198313•
        Pretty sure. •198420_199027•
        There has been, or appears to have been, a hole in the wall that's been plastered up rather badly but  above that housing, that cover •199039_200101•
*NIN:	Mm? •200113_200141•
*CLA:	on the  bathroom wall •200141_200460•

*NIN:	Yeah. •200828_200838•
*CLA:	from the back bedroom  in the bottom there's been a hole about the size of a pipe •200838_201144•
*NIN:	Was there? •201151_201175•
*CLA:	about three quarter pipe, yeah. •201214_201316•

*NIN:	What time is it? •203324_203402•
