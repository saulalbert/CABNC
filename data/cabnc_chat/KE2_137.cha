*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	to have a lunch out

*MAR:	erm she's got a family Margaret, she said she won't go there any more   (.) she I, I don't know whether that er Jean does   (.) so   (.) Didn't she just cotton on quickly, ((laugh)) she said do you know that, I said why do I want anybody wandering in my house and my kitchen, I said it's a bit like it's clean, why should I have somebody sort of, well I mean just because I'm doing cooking, she said you wouldn't stop fancy one, you never know, she said well unless you want to stop at the, please don't, you'll let me still have your jam won't you?
