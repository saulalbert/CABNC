@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 002002)
*CHR:	Lynda wasn't here yesterday when er    (.)  (        ) out.Sorry?
*NOR:	You'll have to warn her about it.
*CHR:	Well I don't think it actually needs warning about.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Well I believe it does.I think it inhibits some people but   (.) she will explain.You saw the sheet didn't you?
*NOR:	Well I didn't really look.
*CHR:	It's irritating cos the clip won't go on the shirt.
*NOR:	Which clip's that  (        ) ?
*CHR:	Well this microphone clip   (        ) shirt.
*NOR:	Is that the kind they wear on the television?
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Why do you  (        ) , why doesn't it work then?
*CHR:	Well it's, the shirt just seems to be too fine for it.
*NOR:	Wear a tough shirt  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes.Playing a tough game tomorrow.
*NOR:	What are you playing tomorrow?
*CHR:	Croquet.
*NOR:	Oh that's Saturday not Sunday is it?
*CHR:	Yes.Very irritating because er   (.) if only I'd approached David earlier as I'd intended to.Previous weekend they had an open day at er Dulwich Croquet Club. (.) So all were invited to go along.
*NOR:	You were busy last  (        ) 
*CHR:	Of course I was on Sunday, yes indeed.Indeed indeed indeed. (.) Yes I couldn't fit in much croquet then could I? (.) The implication was that it was going to be a bit warmer today wasn't it?
*NOR:	I think the sun might come out a little later, I don't know about warmer but
*CHR:	Mm.
*NOR:	it's certainly going to be overcast now. (.) 
*CHR:	 (        ) have breakfast? (.) Thank you. (.) David and   (        ) were agreeing last night how much they like the road.
*NOR:	Made up you mean?
*CHR:	Yes.Yes.But er
*NOR:	I must say I don't think twice now about opening that window whereas before I only did it   (.) reluctantly because of all the dust   (        ) .
*CHR:	Because of the dust flying in .Yes, yes.
*NOR:	Yeah.
*CHR:	She too was saying that she had an urge to go down with her broom and sweep up the   (        ) these building works. (.) Right. (.) I'm gonna have some breakfast, aren't you?
*NOR:	That's an idea.They started off on grapefruit down there.
*CHR:	Eating it, or
*NOR:	No no, preparing.
*CHR:	Oh, right.Shall I finish it?
*NOR:	Yes please.
*CHR:	Oh, god bless our daughter. ((crockery noise))Hello dear.
