*JAC:	We'll have to apologise  say there was a an accident. •192958_193316•
*TON:	Yeah. •193432_193452•
*JAC:	It is true. •193585_193634•
*TON:	Yeah  it didn't hold us up but there was an accident. •193728_194038•
*JAC:	It did hold us up  I mean we would have been down there a lot quicker if we hadn't had to •194068_194575•
*TON:	Yeah. •194762_194787•
*JAC:	five minutes. •194787_195060•
*TON:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	What? •196561_196596•
*TON:	It's alright. •196674_196715•
*JAC:	What? •196754_196777•
*TON:	I would have slowed down a lot more than that . •196928_197173•
*JAC:	Well you're learning to drive, I'm not . •197285_197635•
*TON:	Yeah  that's right  no reflection on you  it's just that I'm thinking  oh  I I just can't see the time when I would ever drive through a gap like that that confidently that's all. •197635_199051•
*JAC:	My foot went on the  •199208_199316•
*TON:	But it'll come. •199329_199369•
*JAC:	accelerator. •199369_199397•
*TON:	Ah yeah you eased off  that's all. •199418_199687•
*JAC:	That  •199724_199759•
*TON:	Only I would have probably braked, changed down  ended up in second and crept past it  on the inside  and then speeded up again. •199807_200837•
        I don't  perhaps not that bad but  I would have definitely braked  and not just eased off on the accelerator. •201245_202682•
*JAC:	You'll have to give these brakes a bit more welly  •203011_203719•
*TON:	Mm. •203741_203748•
*JAC:	they are er  in need of a •203754_203958•
*TON:	A service. •204241_204277•
*JAC:	Oh Neil's complaining it's started  oh I haven't got enough money. •204715_205264•
*TON:	Ah. •205269_205274•
*JAC:	He's just moved into a new house you know •205527_205785•
*TON:	Yeah. •205785_205803•
*JAC:	about a fortnight, three weeks ago •205820_205992•
*TON:	Mm  modification to lifestyle •206423_206583•
*JAC:	Yeah. •206769_206778•
*TON:	needed. •206778_206796•
*JAC:	And his girlfriend got the sack from her job not too long ago. •207170_207704•
*TON:	Oh no. •207704_207811•
*JAC:	So she does  she's a florist  flowers  •207811_208029•
*TON:	Yeah. •208029_208076•
*JAC:	so she does a lot of flower arrangements and that privately •208185_208484•
*TON:	Mhm. •208499_208530•
*JAC:	but as she said you  if you make twenty arrangements and you sell half of them you just about break even with the flowers you've bought to do them. •208614_209325•
*TON:	Yeah. •209391_209425•
*JAC:	You know? •209491_209511•
*TON:	Yeah. •209577_209604•
*JAC:	Leadless plumber  not legless,leadless oh  You know I'm sure that the  this roof rack  I'm sure you can feel the difference  in the car sometimes  well not feel the difference but you can hear it, it makes an awful noise at times when the winds blowing. •209916_214809•
*TON:	Mm. •214867_214875•
*JAC:	You know? •214900_214928•
*TON:	Yeah. •215188_215197•
*JAC:	You think  urgh! •215211_215335•

*TON:	Mm. •216085_216091•
*JAC:	It sounds like fire engines going off above your head. •216091_216417•
