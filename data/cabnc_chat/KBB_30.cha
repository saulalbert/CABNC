*EVE:	not the right size.
*ART:	Aye but   (.) well it's the right size   (        ) sort of thing it's, but it's er   (.) to double up with the picture you can't do it.
*EVE:	So you've just got to draw natural?
*ART:	Well, well   (        ) not being twice the size.See twice the size, it wants twice   (.) say the   (.) it's nine inch and you want it twice the size   (.) the canvas wants to be eighteen inch doesn't it?
*EVE:	Oh it's not that big is it?
*ART:	You see?And er   (.) it's either, I think it's an inch and a quarter bigger than that.So you've either gotta have a border and paint something in it or   (.) you know?So that's what I'm working out. (.) There'll be east top and bottom superfluous to the er what I'm painting. (        ) 
*EVE:	Well you can put a bit more in can't you?
*ART:	Oh yeah, of course, fill it in.

*EVE:	 (        ) finish that pudding.
*ART:	I have a quiet feeling that this no reading and no a add up and all that stuff co co stems from the music they're always listening to. (.) 
*EVE:	No it's not, it's the teachers.
*ART:	They walk by with headphones on don't they?
*EVE:	I know.No a lot of it's these young teachers.And probably the training colleges.

We had screens on wheels in latter years at, last few years at school and er   (.) he used to go down to the tea room for a cup of tea half way down the stairs, the teachers' room and perhaps go toilet as well, and er   (.) the one at the back was a foot out from the screen and every now and then he'd have a look to see if he was coming and er we, what had   (        ) had a big case with birds in and the lads who were doing it looked in this, saw the reflection and shh he's coming.So er er after a bit you see he changed them round, he, he guessed somebody were   (.) and of course I got the job  (.) 
*EVE:	I'm glad I'm getting rid of all the Christmas remnants.I've only got one round case and about two vol au vents

*ART:	 (        ) with all this  (.) 
*EVE:	 [whispering]  (        )  [] 
*ART:	with all this   (.) you arguing and telling me I'm wrong when I'm right and right when I'm wrong.
*EVE:	No I'm not! (.) In fact I felt tired and when I went to change I er
*ART:	Went on the bed.
*EVE:	No I felt like going on.
*ART:	Oh if you'd shouted down I'd've g come with you.
*EVE:	Oh no you wouldn't.No I didn't but I just changed and came down here and put my feet up here. (.) 
*ART:	Yeah we're getting on now so 
*EVE:	I keep going cold.

*EVE:	Pardon?
*ART:	woodwork, windows, anything. (.) 
*EVE:	Do you want a chocolate biscuit?
*ART:	No, full up    (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*EVE:	Such as?
*ART:	 (        ) have to burn it up when you're    (        )  (.) Feels as if only just gone.

*EVE:	They clean oh, oh I've put all the bones in the er dustbin.
*ART:	I see they cleared it all up. (.)  (        ) 
*EVE:	And I didn't cut, you know I didn't cut it up, I just left it.
*ART:	About another three weeks we should be out of the real winter shan't we?
*EVE:	Should be.Although March can be   (.) pretty cold.
*ART:	 (        ) February.
*EVE:	February's usually the worst.
*ART:	February you get wet snow and rain.
*EVE:	Mm. (.) 
*ART:	Mind you don't burn that ch table.
*EVE:	Well you pushed the table nearer the fire.It was, you left the back door open that's what's made it, the room cold. (.)

*ART:	Do you think I ought to finish the ship first of all or do the oil painting? (.) 
*EVE:	Well if you've got to go in the garage, it's too cold to go in there to finish the ship off so you'd better paint in the house hadn't you? (.) 
*ART:	Well if I want to turn something   (        ) I've gotta keep walking in and out and I don't wanna do that.
*EVE:	Well then leave that till warmer weather. (.) It's not ready for rigging yet is it?
*ART:	Will you take that to Tom's or not?
*EVE:	Who?
*ART:	Your Tom. (.)

*ART:	Do a pennorth do a pennorth of it can't you?
*EVE:	 ((laugh)) 
*ART:	Perhaps Maggie's got some bright ideas of
*EVE:	I doubt it.
*ART:	Cath I know who could fill it up, Cath.
*EVE:	 [laughing] Cath  [] .Well we've got to go round there if we're out to   (        ) because erm we've still got Penny's   (        ) 
*ART:	Well it'd show willing if we did get a bit of all on wouldn't it?
*EVE:	A few more. (.) 
*ART:	I mean if, if they had,ha had nursery rhymes.
*EVE:	 [laughing] No don't be silly   [] they just want vocabulary, they don't want things like that, they want to know   (.) a person's vocabulary a to cer you know, at a certain age. (.) I think the  (.) not doing very well with some sixteen year olds.
*ART:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	No!Tim's got that lady friend.
*ART:	I know he w she were on about a room weren't she?
*EVE:	No!Why would Tim want to come and live here?
*ART:	I didn't say he would but Cath might want him to.
*EVE:	No course she wouldn't! (.) Anyway Tim's paying a lot towards that house.
*ART:	Mm.
*EVE:	You know he paid for it to be  (        ) 
*ART:	Well that   (        ) very much when you live there does it?
*EVE:	Well
*ART:	Look what we pay   (        ) 
*EVE:	 (        ) 
*ART:	Look what we
*EVE:	And then the double glazing cost over a thousand.
*ART:	Mm.Glad we didn't have it then.
*EVE:	Well it is about, about a thousand for one bay window so she's had the whole house done   (.) so it's probably nearer three.
*ART:	But can you honestly say you've been cold in this house?
*EVE:	No. (.) 
*ART:	I've been in digs 
*EVE:	Well where lots of people   (        ) 
*ART:	I've been in digs where you went to bed and you've had to put your top coat on the bed.
*EVE:	Mm.There are lots of people let the windows go and it was a case of either having new wood windows
*ART:	 ((cough)) Yeah or get glazed.
*EVE:	or, or paying the bit extra and have it double glazed.
*ART:	Yes but you can't open your windows in the summer.
*EVE:	Well you can with double glazing, some   (        ) 
*ART:	 ((cough)) 
*EVE:	but you can have vents. (.) But while our wood frames are in condition
*ART:	Yeah what sort of problem is it when you, say a kid broke the window like they broke ours, what sort of problem is it as opposed to these?
*EVE:	Well you get it done on the insurance, your insurance covers that.
*ART:	I don't mean that I mean it w is it a bigger job or s 
*EVE:	Well of course it would be.
*ART:	Well then.That, you take that into consideration an'all.
*EVE:	If you get it done on the insurance I don't suppose people worry.
*ART:	There's always a debit side.
*EVE:	Anyway it's always   (.) er   (.) they're tougher than ordinary glass anyway, even if footballs do
*ART:	Mm.It's not footballs is it, it was er
*EVE:	Well stones or whatever.
*ART:	it was a stone or half a brick. (.) Or even somebody who went berserk with a hammer, that's been known.
*EVE:	Oh yeah I know. (.) 
*ART:	One thing they seem to be giving the skateboards a rest aren't they?
*EVE:	Mm. (.) 
*ART:	I mean how wh er how the parents can let them
*EVE:	Yes, yes but, but it's not the time 
*ART:	come down three abreast I don't know.
*EVE:	of year for skateboards so you, that's no criteria is it?
*ART:	No but why, how parents can let 
*EVE:	Yeah.
*ART:	let them come down three abreast
*EVE:	Mm.
*ART:	and say that they've got, have every right to do it.
*EVE:	Well
*ART:	Well you wouldn't say that if you got knocked down and broke your thigh would you?Look at your dad, he died in three days.
*EVE:	No he didn't. (.) Three weeks.
*ART:	Well   (.) three something or other. (.) Then there was your Aunt Nell, she, she broke her 
*EVE:	 [whispering]  (        )  [] 
*ART:	Mm?What'd you say?
*EVE:	 [whispering]  (        )  []  (.)

*ART:	I'll get it.
*EVE:	You go and get it.
*ART:	It's annoyance value.
*EVE:	No I don't want any more.

*ART:	But I mean i it's beyond belief innit?If I wanted somebody to   (.) buy what I'd got I'd be scrupulous about that, wouldn't you?
*EVE:	Well it's the people they employ, probably, not the people who are   (.) who er  (.) 
*ART:	Do you, do you think
*EVE:	want the business.
*ART:	well if it's er if it's kids say, you know, youths   (.) do they leave their own father's gate open like

*ART:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	No they keep open till eight. (.) You go to the front door.
*ART:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	You go to the front door but it's probably   (.) next door but one the alarm went, go to the front door.It's not the fire.
*ART:	Yeah but listen. (.) Can hear it somewhere but, still it don't make a difference does it?
*EVE:	Not really.

*EVE:	Well we'll go on the corporation, wait for a corporation   (.) you wouldn't wait for a corporation, I said wait, wait for the big bus.
*ART:	I mean if we go, we're sitting on the outside and invariably they're a bit over into the gangway   (.) well if a chap kept pushing against us as the car went round corners   (.) it wouldn't be very nice would it?Some might like it, some might object.
*EVE:	Well they wouldn't get on again if they objected would they?
*ART:	But I mean it could've been made a bit bigger than that couldn't it, for the seat   (        )
