*ANN:	Are you ready for your dinner? •160347_160485•
        I've made the tea. •160521_160591•
        I forgot to put those in the freezer. •160744_162084•
        I think I'll do the bedrooms this afternoon. •162137_162523•
*JAM:	Especially Bryony's bedroom. •162855_163478•
        And those begonias are doing well now. •163827_164795•
*ANN:	Which? •164990_165022•
        Where? •165048_165084•
        In the front room? •165126_165186•
*JAM:	Yes. •165243_165259•
*ANN:	How many have grown? •165324_165431•
*JAM:	Er  •165471_165481•
*ANN:	Sometimes you look at them. •165481_165627•
        It doesn't matter, you don't need to look. •165795_166123•
        Get on with your dinner! •166140_166233•
        You'll be late. •166233_166304•
*JAM:	Mm. •166511_166532•
        There's four in the sitting room, there's one well advanced that's doing quite well, there's one upstairs that's just about ready for  er, repotting, and there are  two more that have sprouts on. •167226_169284•
        Only   •169290_169302•
*ANN:	So that's seven out of ten, was it? •169427_169678•
*JAM:	Oh yeah. •169678_169688•
        Yeah. •169728_169734•
        About seven. •169734_169825•
*ANN:	Well that's not bad for one ninety nine. •169933_170120•
        There's erm  I know they'd be, probably be better quality  but there are  nine, I think it is, advertised in  today's paper that say, erm for er eleven ninety nine. •170246_171764•
        So even, we get  seven for one ninety nine, it's a bargain. •172117_172479•
*JAM:	Depends what they flower like though. •172876_172970•
*ANN:	I hope they're different colours. •173196_173317•
*JAM:	And how long they last. •173402_173586•
        And if we •173914_173978•
*ANN:	Well they go on flowering for quite, you you've got  •173988_174193•
*JAM:	No, no, I mean, how long  you put  •174193_174377•
*ANN:	Oh yeah, you'll have to leave the children's. •174377_174534•
*JAM:	I know that. •174569_174641•
        But  if we keep them for the next ten years they're a  a real bargain, if, if, if  •174745_175229•
*ANN:	Aha. •175229_175238•
*JAM:	they're all no good next year, well  it'll be just a  an ordinary bargain. •175238_176967•
*ANN:	I don't think, I dunno  that  I wonder if we should put some gravel under that umbrella tree. •177498_178324•
        Or if it should even be near that radiator. •178327_178907•
        In Australia, you know they grow into great big huge trees in Australia, Mrs  told me. •178907_179416•
*JAM:	Yes. •179522_179538•
*ANN:	She said er, Derek  has them in his garden. •179538_180124•
*JAM:	Well it's a bit better climate out there. •180124_180409•
        Well I don't know if it's a better climate, but it's a warmer climate. •180409_181098•
*ANN:	Well it must get hotter  than it does in this house for a start! •181098_181526•
*JAM:	It is hotter. •181526_181570•
*ANN:	I was freezing last night in bed! •181570_181849•

*ANN:	How can I, it, I was on my side. •183315_183485•
*JAM:	Well you still snore, er you snore on your side. •183485_183714•
