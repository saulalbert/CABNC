*UNK:	I'll just have a look round there again Barry.
*BAR:	Yeah okay.Do you wanna
*UNK:	Can I see the back?
*BAR:	play with those figures again?
*BAR:	Dunno.
*BAR:	Before we get started doing it.
*UNK:	Well yeah, doing the cellar.Do you wanna have a look in the cellar now?
*BAR:	Oh yeah.Okay. (        ) gonna have a look round the back is he?
*BAR:	Yeah.I'm just, I mean   (.) I reckon you could, I dunno if you can just pull them in.Draw them up   (        ) and we used to do   (.) the   (        ) would be quicker  (        ) .
*BAR:	Oh ta.
*BAR:	 (        )  (.) you're gonna be really talking about next week aren't you?
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*BAR:	It looks like it.
*BAR:	Yeah if you can.Definitely.
*UNK:	 ((whistling)) 
*BAR:	See   (.) not that easy.
*UNK:	No.I'm just thinking of that exit there.This, this is good.I mean if you put that 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	the nearest one 
*BAR:	You mean, it's a fire exit so that's the problem so you're not gonna be able to leave anything in it   (.) that would obstruct.
*UNK:	But   (.) ah, so this, it's the actual fire exit for here int 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	it?Yeah.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	That leads downstairs don't it?
*BAR:	Yeah.It goes out next to the cellar.
*UNK:	I suppose like you say at nine thirty once the music starts no one 's gonna want to 
*BAR:	Oh er, if you put, if you put   (.) if you put wrought iron gates   (        ) gates decorated type of thing round there
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and then   (.) somebody stands there, two fifty   (.) that's what I were thinking, an admission from here.
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	And, and wrought iron it, yeah, you know.
*BAR:	Well wrought iron'd look   (.) it'd look quite good for the functions trade as well cos you can get 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	the artificial plants up it 
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	and whatever else 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	when you do 
*BAR:	Get   (        ) climbing plants 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	You can get it, it will soon cover 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	cover it actually.
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.
*UNK:	I mean close that area down.
*BAR:	And that, that would do double job cos that would do the job of your blinds as well wouldn't it?
*UNK:	Yeah.Yeah. (.) And then they'll cause the atmosphere rather than 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	big open wide 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	club.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	 ((sniff)) 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	Get your wrought, your gates there, or something like that to be 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	round the back, which entrance would they come in?They wouldn't come in that end. (        ) 
*UNK:	Well all you do right, you have gates 
*BAR:	Well I mean 
*UNK:	then they're open   (.) so that at half nine   (.) you close them there, or at ten o'clock you close them there   (.) and you say when they come through   (.) if you're going out that 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	way   (.) or whatever.
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean I   (.) I think you just have to   (.) but
*UNK:	It's something that you've gotta be 
*BAR:	You'd have to play it by ear I think.Yes 
*UNK:	thinking ahead.
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.
*UNK:	You know, you're thinking well 
*BAR:	Let's 
*UNK:	at first you could just wrought iron it round and, and just give it that 
*BAR:	As you say, if somebody's been in there from bloody five o'clock and wants to stay till eleven 
*UNK:	Well that's it.
*BAR:	or twelve, then fine, let them.I mean I   (.) th I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind that
*UNK:	No.
*BAR:	you know, I mean
*BAR:	So you could either come in half eight, half nine or   (        ) 
*BAR:	That's right.You know 
*UNK:	But really, you know 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	what you do?At half nine you put someone on the door here to take money, anyone who comes in, whether they come into here or go into there
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	anyone who's been drinking all afternoon   [laughing] if you want to er, wander across   [] 
*BAR:	Yeah, I mean, what you, what you'd have to be careful of is, is sooner or later people'll catch on   (.) to 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	coming in at quarter past nine 
*UNK:	Yeah.Yeah.
*BAR:	buying one extra drink and erm   (.) getting a   (.) you know   (.) cheaper than saving theirselves two and a half quid then.
*BAR:	 (        ) pint they buy, and if they buy five pints
*BAR:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] !
*BAR:	they can have a three, er er   (.) a three pound voucher.
*UNK:	Can you imagine Polly organizing that all!
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	We're getting complicated aren't we?
*UNK:	Why can't we do it, to me, cost effective.
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Torture.
*BAR:	Complicating issues.
*BAR:	I remember   (.) at the Uni when we used to give   (.) we used to put stamps on people, you know,
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	for pass outs and that or anything 
*UNK:	So does Broadway.
*BAR:	and er   (.) I bloody, I said, I said in the end I've, what we ought to do is   (.) lop some part of their anatomy off, like a little digit or something then we can prove they've been in
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	eventually, after about two years when you get this sort of   (.) armless, legless cor 
*UNK:	Oh oh! ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	body   (.) oh he's a good customer! [laughing] We'll let him in for free!He gets a free, free ticket  [] !
*BAR:	Well it's like, like a   (.) all you want to do is  (        ) 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	That's what you get, (        )  (.) you just gotta stand or you went downstairs to another bar
*BAR:	Yeah,th the trouble is you're 
*UNK:	and got a stamp 
*BAR:	you 
*UNK:	and they would
*BAR:	you, you're doing it in the same   (.) room 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	aren't you?That's the  (        ) .
*UNK:	That is as well.
*BAR:	But I   (.) I dunno, I   (.) see it's not   (.) once you're u actually up here, looking   (.) I think it's different when you're up here looking back as when you're over there looking up here.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	It's not quite as cold and empty as 
*UNK:	If it got going you'd probably use mo  (.) another, another half of area, you know 
*BAR:	Yeah, yeah, you want 
*UNK:	you don't wanna close it off.But, like you say maybe just   (.) just a bit of wrought 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	ironwork
*BAR:	Yeah.I think so.
*UNK:	to just 
*BAR:	I think you do I think that would look good anyway   (.) and 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and it would also enable you to   (.) quickly and easily do something on the erm   (.) on the, on the private functions night to make it look   (.) different.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	I mean, I wouldn't suggest putting 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	plants up and everything   (.) for our normal   (.) you know, rock nights, I mean we just   (.) have the wrought iron up and whatever, but
*UNK:	I mean, with them sort of then 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	once you got erm tied into these you can 
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*UNK:	do whatever to the thing.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	But it would give you affect.
*BAR:	That's right.I mean, those are just   (.) we just went out and chucked a few fucking trees down.
*UNK:	They're not real then Barry?
*BAR:	No, the trees are   (.) the er   (.) things tied on to them aren't.
*UNK:	Oh.
*BAR:	But er
*UNK:	Yeah. (.) I think, it's quite actually, it needs a bit of character.
*BAR:	I mean, that'll cover 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	if you did that in quite a few places 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	throughout the room it would cover your cracks and your holes 
*BAR:	Ye 
*BAR:	and your, your  (        ) .
*BAR:	I mean, what we initially wanted to do with all this was cover this whole area in, in greenery and have this as a sort of restaurant ta type.
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	I mean, again, it's ideas when you're sat 
*BAR:	It's ideas.
*BAR:	planning, before you've actually moved in and get 
*BAR:	It is.Yeah, yeah, that's right.
*BAR:	and get   (.) and then, then you start
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	that's, that's the other thing when there's only two of you involved   (.) and you, we were opening for that first sort of eighteen months   (.) five, six days a week   (.) just keeping on top of a day to day business doesn't allow you to sit back
*UNK:	No, I know that.
*BAR:	and expand it, and whereas, you know, that, that's one area that'd be great with having yo your involvement
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	that you go in and say well   (.) you know
*BAR:	It sounds like this sort of thing 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	When did you paint all this green?
*BAR:	It was when I was working for Walt Disney, so it'll be   (.) two years ago.Two years 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	ago.I was over in Belfast and I came back and it were green.It was alri it's, it's actually lasted reasonably well considering it hadn't been 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	for two years.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	But again, it was all done, it was all literally done in a weekend.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	It was like a   (.) virtually an all night blitz job and   (.) so bits of it, you know, it wasn't like, totally completed, you know, you've got   (.) and as Scouse was doing some of it it was er    (.)  [laughing] the paintwork leaves something to be desired in   (.) areas  [] .
*UNK:	Something there Barry   (.) little bit in there look.
*BAR:	Just coming down a little bit.They just need brushing back up.
*UNK:	It's got a few   (.) you've got the 
*BAR:	Not a problem.
*UNK:	roof repaired haven't you?This 
*BAR:	Yeah.The heating's very efficient as well.It's very hot gas heating.
*BAR:	Yes.
*BAR:	Erm
*BAR:	They did do it, like you say it was more or less just covering for itself now   (.) and then use 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	you build up, up and up don't you?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	So
*BAR:	Yes.
*UNK:	Let us have a look at cellar and then we'll, d'ya wanna, and then we'll, ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	then we can say we've to looked at everything and then we know where   (.) you know 
*BAR:	Yeah.Okay.
*UNK:	and then we can er   (.) we can start, you know, we can, at least we can say look, we've got fifteen grand coming in and th it  (        ) .
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	But we need a full  (        ) .
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean, we can, we can start by   (.) we I mean we can get people set up   (.) for doing things from the first of March can't we?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	The little bits and pieces that we talked about.
*BAR:	Well we, well we, we can start if you wanna start with the 
*BAR:	Or we can think about doing something about 
*UNK:	Yes.
*BAR:	this.
*BAR:	We can start giving it a lick of paint if you wanna start giving it a lick of paint.
*BAR:	You see, now the more you think about it, I mean the more you   (.) you don't actually use this
*UNK:	No.
*BAR:	very much.I mean, you look at it, if everybody was seated in this area that could be seated   (.) I mean, you're only talking about bloody 
*BAR:	I 
*BAR:	thirty people.
*BAR:	I don't think it's too bad actually.I don't think the carpet's too bad at all really.
*BAR:	Well th there's areas, I mean 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	tha the licens 
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*BAR:	the licensing people would pull us up on that 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	if they came.
*UNK:	But maybe, if you could cut it off from there.
*BAR:	That's what I mean, you gotta   (.) and then do it, clear it, and then clear all that
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	and just left that area 
*UNK:	Clear all that 
*BAR:	and they're obviously, they're gonna say
*UNK:	Come right up to the   (.) right up to bar really aren't you?
*BAR:	 ((sigh))  (.) Yeah.I mean th th er, the other thing psychologically is it's, you know
*BAR:	Blue Rhapsody.
*BAR:	Blue Rhapsody.If you wanted to cha if you want to change it slightly you've got   (.) a problem.
*UNK:	You know   (.) I think it, I think it's something that you can say well   (.) you know, that'd be one of our objectives 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	once we get it going, but le 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	alright,we we've got 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	a few bob in the kitty
*BAR:	Right.
*UNK:	let's, or we can go to brewery for another five grand, we'll do the carpet 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	now.
*BAR:	I reckon the first thing really is, is get your salary.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	Get your salary, that you feel that I'm doing this and I'm getting it right.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	Is that the right   (.) sort of, if our   (.) I mean from our objective is to get more sales 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	right now.
*BAR:	That's right.That's right.
*BAR:	And we've gotta 
*BAR:	That's right.
*BAR:	manipulate people to say well, how do we get them drink more?And you say like five pound a head when they   (.) they come in
*UNK:	How bad's the seating though?
*BAR:	Sit there till 
*UNK:	Is it, is it that bad?
*BAR:	It's, it's, if, it needs doing
*UNK:	Oh it needs doing does it?
*BAR:	You know.
*BAR:	If you've got a guy gathered, I'm not saying try but if you got somebody who, who did the job and gathered it in   (.) like they would do.
*BAR:	Oh yeah.Yeah.Yeah.But it i 
*BAR:	An upholster.
*BAR:	It's a perpetual patching up job at the moment 
*UNK:	Yeah.Yeah.
*BAR:	Because, because it is only patched up, it's 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	it   (.) create more problems o you know   (.) cos people stand on it and 
*BAR:	Get an upholsterer just to come and   (.) tidy it up 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and fill in where there's been 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	some damage done.
*BAR:	Yeah, that's right.I mean there's 
*BAR:	Just, just   (.) tart it up really.
*BAR:	There's a bit of structural damage to the support 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and things like that, that   (.) start the seating going and things.
*UNK:	Right.Okay.
*BAR:	Oh this   (.) this   (.) actual stuff anyway we'll go, we're putting that with that is alright to that
*BAR:	Oh yes.
*BAR:	the back's have been 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	alright.
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	There's a few of them damaged but, but erm   (.) I think we've repaired most of them.You see, we did get it all completely repaired when we moved in, cos it was in a hell of a state from Peter !Cos Peter  had this place.
*BAR:	Yeah.That's right.
*UNK:	Well we, we, we know 
*BAR:	We knew 
*UNK:	about that.
*BAR:	about that.
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	How?Did he 
*UNK:	Cos we 
*BAR:	owe you money?
*UNK:	we gone 
*BAR:	Well 
*UNK:	and got it actually.
*BAR:	Did you!
*UNK:	Bloody right!
*BAR:	God!You must be one of the few people
*UNK:	It were quite good cos what we had, we had th the   (.) the other partner   (.) who was, you know, the other partner is Michael.
*BAR:	He was called, what was he called?Ken ?
*BAR:	No, no.
*UNK:	No.
*BAR:	No, that's
*UNK:	Yes.
*BAR:	that's John  (        ) .
*BAR:	But what do you call him?That erm
*BAR:	I know who you mean, I met him, yeah.
*BAR:	Cos the other guy was a, was a bar manager   (.) Duncan or
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	Der summat like that, and his wife had a baby at the same time as Elaine's so she   (.) our midwife would come and er, so the   (.) she kept in touch really of   (.) of what they were    (        )  (.) because they wanted to, I'll take the place off  (        ) , they wanted to take it over.I don't think they was er   (.) as bad a
*BAR:	No.
*BAR:	shower of shit 
*BAR:	No.
*BAR:	as he were 
*BAR:	No.
*BAR:	tended to 
*BAR:	No.
*BAR:	be.But er, in the end they never got the license back.Because what they did try and do is buy the catholic club didn't they?Top of Lancasters.Next to the 
*BAR:	Cos the 
*BAR:	Alex.
*BAR:	The Alex.
*BAR:	They tried to get behind there, the catholic 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	club.
*BAR:	Right.
*BAR:	Then they got, they didn't get it past.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	But er   (.) he actually owed 
*BAR:	Yeah, that used to be
*BAR:	about five grand at one stage and got it down to three and half, and then he got to six hundred and eighty   (.) and they went to court 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	and then they got   (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) He paid it.
*BAR:	Paid it   (.) through the court.
*BAR:	Well that was   (.) remarkably
*UNK:	Lucky.
*BAR:	lucky.
*UNK:	Yeah I know.
*BAR:	He didn't half go for a lot again.
*UNK:	Yes we did seem to be quite lucky to keep    [laughing]  (        )  [] .
*BAR:	Yeah.But I, I, I'm amazed that breweries keep lending him money!
*BAR:	I know.
*BAR:	I mean, it's unbelievable, you know th er, he's done so many breweries and yet why they don't talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one another.
*UNK:	Because you get people like Ben  who's giving his money he doesn't really give a toss!
*BAR:	He don't give a toss.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	As long as he's got an installation going in and if it
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	if it gets written off or
*UNK:	Gets bigger.
*BAR:	or someone has to take a, a bi a co company has to take a big lot off.
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	It's par for the course really.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	Well, you know.
*BAR:	Dreadful innit?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	Well he's got that much money to burn Barry that's what it is.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	You've gotta burn to, to cover all   (.) they've just laid three hundred and thirty management staff off   (.) management, not dray lads, not   (        ) brewery lads.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	Three hundred and thirty managers   (.) where 
*BAR:	I think it's your, that's your T V thing is it?
*BAR:	Yeah.T V, video projection.
*BAR:	How do you work that thing?How do you work that thing?
*BAR:	From behind there.
*BAR:	And where's it come there?
*BAR:	That one.
*BAR:	That just puts on
*BAR:	At the moment we use
*UNK:	Rock videos.
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean, Mark's got some   (.) great stuff of the sixties er er   (.) er, ex, ex movies of the so er trailers of ex movies, you know
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	sizzling, sexual and all these sort of and,wha what was really outrageous in the sixties looks so tame, but 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	it's on in black and white and fifties, it looks quite good fun.
*UNK:	Well that   (        ) on a Thursday 
*BAR:	It's 
*UNK:	night could be a sixties night then.
*BAR:	I mean when we get, when
*UNK:	A fifties night even, you know.
*BAR:	when you get tho when you get the half the er   (.) when you get sort of well like the scooterist dos and th the DJs bring it up, I mean they bring in a hard core
