*PS19L:	I think the Labour Party 's heart is in the right place they want to take a positive approach and do what they can to help industry to train to put more money into training youngsters for industry then we have a skill work force not a cheap not a cheap unskilled labour force er you know which is what we what 's happening now because we 've just not been trained they 're cutting the training but it 's all the same anyway you know I I I do n't know you say what can I do for ya well er in the short run not much except to help the the people who are on lower income and the children through the budget er which will be introduced it 'll be that why er through er child benefits and through er high high benefits and through er er lower taxes for the everybody up to er twenty odd twenty five thousand year or something so erm I mean that 's in the short run and little that can be done it 's not as much as anybody would like you put more and more into into er into training er more money into industry to help them to invest er you know you can have a sort of regional development banks to help industry to invest these in in each of the regions but I mean the these are the positive plans and not like this one who 's just letting things go .  933_81363
