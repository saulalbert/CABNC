@Comment:	conversation #12 (Tape 002012)
*CHR:	I was rather irritated yesterday because I had a phone call from    (.)  
*LYN:	Yes? 
*CHR:	And he called Gary   saying we don't have the P elevens. And I   (.) I said oh well that's fair enough so I dug them out and sent them to him. And after I'd stamped and sealed the envelopes   (.) he rang back he said I haven't got the copy VAT certs either. I was not pleased at that! And I, wouldn't have occurred to me to send the P elevens. 
*LYN:	Actually that's not true either because I sent the P elevens to Steve and Matthew   (.) for his approval before we sent them off. 
*CHR:	And he sent them back again? 
*LYN:	Erm.  (.) I don't know whether he sent them back. I sent  (  ) , I didn't send him the originals I sent a copy. 
*CHR:	Oh right. 
*LYN:	I doubt that he sent them back. 
*CHR:	Oh well, I I've sent the ones from the drawer 
*LYN:	Fine. 
*CHR:	off and said I want them back! 
*LYN:	Oh right. 
*CHR:	And he said fine. 
*LYN:	We haven't got copies of them  (  ) . 
*CHR:	No. That that, well   (.) you know if there's a query in the next fortnight we know where they are don't we? But I was annoyed and I thought well that's fair enough because I wasn't aware that those particular documents were required by the accountants to sort things out, but 
*LYN:	Why were they required? 
*CHR:	I don't know. I didn't ask him but he said he required them. But I know that copy VAT certs, the VAT certs, VAT payment return, returns that's what they're called aren't they, are required. And so we hadn't sent them. (.)  
*LYN:	Oh. 
*CHR:	Down to our   (  ) that is. 
*LYN:	Well where were they? 
*CHR:	Well they're here in the   (.) drawer where they're kept. There's there's a VAT file in there and that's where they get put.  (.) Bit silly isn't it?  (.) This is a unhelpful   (  ) because   (.) it's winding that way yet it looks as if it's winding that way, doesn't it? 
*LYN:	What onto the spool here? 
*CHR:	It looks as if it's reeling on to that spool. 
*LYN:	Yes.  But it's reeling onto that one? 
*CHR:	 It's not it's reeling  through there. Very confusing and the fact that they've stuck that label on there doesn't help very much either. 
*LYN:	No, so, when it's full you have to put another tape in, does it 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*LYN:	click or does it? 
*CHR:	I don't know. I thought it would actually reversed on the first side. Erm 
*LYN:	And do the other side. 
*CHR:	Yes and I thought it was mucking it up so I just swapped it over the way it was. Erm we shall see. We shall see. 
*LYN:	It doesn't tell you  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Well it it tells you quite a lot, but it doesn't actually mention that bit  (  ) . I've got, I have got oodles of instructions here.
