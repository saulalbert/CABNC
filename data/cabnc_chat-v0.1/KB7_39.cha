*ANN:	Well, that's all that ready  just popped it in the oven. •227098_227454•
*STU:	Okay. •227454_227463•
*ANN:	Are you ready      •227682_228280•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	well. •228638_228678•
*STU:	It's the only thing you wanted really. •228678_230158•
*ANN:	Yes. •230158_230182•
*STU:	Mm. •230182_230188•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	No  I'm sure we are  Yes we certainly are dear. •230188_233063•
*ANN:	All seems to have happened in such a rush. •233791_234003•
*STU:	Well yeah but •234044_234103•
*ANN:	There's so much to think about. •234103_234248•
*STU:	I know. •234478_234501•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	But we had to really because  •234991_235140•
*ANN:	No because we wouldn't have got that fifteen hundred pounds  they hadn't agreed to do us a service. •235140_235650•
*STU:	No. •235721_235734•
*ANN:	I wanna get it through. •235734_235846•
*STU:	Well they said they'd wait, I mean fifteen hundred pound ain't he would put a deposit down, it's only five percent  innit? •235846_236567•
        Fifteen hundred pound  if he was prepared to put a deposit down  or something that would have been fifteen hundred quid. •236596_237037•
*ANN:	Yes. •237204_237216•
*STU:	So  we got it. •237216_237373•
*ANN:	He must have been looking for  bathroom. •237393_237572•
*STU:	Yeah. •237620_237641•
*ANN:	Otherwise he wouldn't have accepted without any •237697_237901•
*STU:	Without any quibble. •237936_237986•
*ANN:	No. •237986_237992•
*STU:	I thought it was worth pushing for the extra  I mean when he said a thousand, I thought it would be  •238232_238559•
*ANN:	Yeah. •238559_238570•
*STU:	worth pushing for an extra five hundred, and did get it. •238589_238784•
*ANN:	Yeah well he said a thousand because he knew he could get  he'd carpet that  er er  for a thousand. •238784_239348•
*STU:	Yeah. •239355_239375•
*ANN:	That's why he mentioned that sort of figure  if all you wanted was a , a fridge, a cooker  and some carpets, you could do that easy on a thousand. •239410_240388•
*STU:	Yeah  but now we got the extra  five hundred and which I say is is, makes up for the  which is five percent of the purchase price  we've got  an extra to play with  and get a bit more. •240441_241941•
*ANN:	Yeah. •241962_241968•
*STU:	Not too bad. •242308_242434•
*ANN:	Gotta be careful when I'm cooking, I shall have to have the window open  me I've got smoke alarms all over the place darling  which is good in a flat. •243254_245877•
*STU:	True, true. •246011_246102•
*ANN:	Mm but erm  you get steam up in the cooking area and er •246151_246601•
*STU:	Yeah. •246605_246632•
*ANN:	Ding a ling a ling a ling a ling a ling   •246632_246810•
*STU:	Right  yeah. •246843_247216•

        There is a smoke alarm in the airing cupboard  in case that overheats and there's one •247711_248678•
*STU:	In the hall ? •248678_248746•
*ANN:	No. •248855_248861•
*STU:	I've only seen one, I haven't  seen any more than one at •248861_249319•
*ANN:	There's supposed to be one in the airing cupboard. •249378_249577•
*STU:	Seen that one. •249609_249649•
*ANN:	Case the airing cupboard overheats, but it says on the spec  one airing cupboard when it, will have , hot water tank and smoke alarm. •249667_250456•
*STU:	Oh! •250492_250497•
        Ooh, ooh, ooh! •250497_250750•
*ANN:	In case you let it  hot water tank starts playing up. •250780_251067•
*STU:	Mhm  It says it doesn't, but  like I say,in a way it usually starts  •251067_252364•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	. •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah  Fire services, recommend everybody to have it •252486_252815•
*STU:	Mm. •252839_252845•
*ANN:	especially in an upstairs flat. •252845_252993•

*ANN:	It's a   and plenty of warning to get out. •253199_253543•
*STU:	Mhm. •253593_253611•
*ANN:	That's why he's had them put in  cos the flat's more than house in in  the only thing is I would say to you to let a  heat from the kitchen and the  •254115_255557•
*STU:	Yeah. •255557_255573•
*ANN:	smoke and steam they do tend to  keep going. •255573_255742•
*STU:	Set them off. •255742_255854•
*ANN:	Ha ha  and everybody starts running out the door  and all you're doing is frying some breakfast  or something! •255854_256932•
        Burning the toast ! •256973_257119•
        I'll be dissuaded buying a pussy cat altogether now won't I? •258405_258785•
*STU:	Ha ha  Yeah it is  •258793_258990•
*ANN:	Once it starts  that upstairs flat. •258990_259203•
*STU:	It is a little bit er •259251_259339•
*ANN:	With a deadlock on the front door so he  can't get in and out or anything. •259465_259845•
*STU:	Oh yeah  can't jump on the window to get in or anything. •259859_260138•
*ANN:	Mm, no they wanted to be in, but you not hear it  no I think pussy cat is  gonna be a no no about us  you'll have to . •260182_261079•
*STU:	Well it's certainly gonna be  certainly won't let it . •261178_261552•
*ANN:	Looks like a  •261558_261602•
*STU:	It's gonna be a little bit tricky isn't it really, having a •261606_261898•
*ANN:	I think I would just about give up over that. •261898_262226•
*STU:	It's a shame. •262226_262462•
*ANN:	, but I mean a downstairs one wouldn't be quite so bad •262466_262894•
*STU:	Yeah. •262894_262902•
*ANN:	but those stairs won't  like, I mean, I wouldn't like it that if it was just indoors forever  would you, honestly? •262980_263643•
*STU:	Not really. •263740_263793•
*ANN:	It's not fair on an animal even. •263825_263940•
*STU:	It's not natural  no. •263940_264014•
*ANN:	Cats or something. •264027_264231•
*STU:	Not really is it? •264245_264421•
*ANN:	No I know and I don't fancy litter trays and things either. •264421_264648•
*STU:	We might do one day or  see •264855_265061•
*ANN:	Yeah but  but not while we're there, I don't think it's   must get another budgie sometime  get Steven's budgie or something. •265061_265894•
*STU:	Yeah a cat's a little bit out on dashing upstairs now innit really? •266133_266900•
        It's a shame, but, there you go. •266923_266991•
*ANN:	Definitely is up here, it's  •266991_267235•
*STU:	Yeah. •267271_267277•
*ANN:	not fair on a animal as I say, he's bound to  be trapped at the bloody door for hours before anybody come in and •267277_268101•
*STU:	It ain't fair. •268332_268542•
*ANN:	No. •268542_268550•
*STU:	Actually that's something we'll have to  negotiate with our  er  opposite neighbour •268550_269120•
*ANN:	The stair carpets. •269120_269201•
*STU:	stair carpet. •269201_269275•
*ANN:	Hadn't thought of that, well that's gonna be noisy anybody coming home late at night  wooden stairs. •269275_269898•
*STU:	Don't know who you got  we'll have to wait and see who we get. •270044_270296•
*ANN:	Well fling that rug out the hall it'll be a start, bung it out on the landing  for a start. •270509_271012•
*STU:	Yeah  yeah. •271044_271056•
*ANN:	So at least there's something up there at the doors to wipe your feet on and what not, but  I'm not splashing out on stair carpet  until somebody else has been  •271180_271942•
*STU:	Oh no. •271942_271952•
*ANN:	in  as well. •271952_271958•
*STU:	Yeah. •271983_271989•
*ANN:	Well there's something that will have to be will be  •272004_272377•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	needed eventually. •272377_272436•
*STU:	I say a negotiation with  next door neighbour  or something like that. •272511_273020•
*ANN:	But you come home late at night when people are asleep •273030_273266•
*STU:	Start banging up the stairs and •273266_273589•
*ANN:	and you lot, and stroll in after half past four five o'clock in the morning, you know, you do. •273589_274068•
*STU:	Yeah. •274302_274308•
*ANN:	If I don't get up till nine, it's a bit  •274336_274464•
*STU:	Yeah. •274600_274606•
*ANN:	It won't be very nice  so we'll have to just  manage  as for as  the stall light  the hall lighting  who is responsible for that? •274643_276585•
        Cos the staircase has gotta be lit, I mean you can't get •276775_276962•
*STU:	There is a light out there isn't there? •277052_277324•
        I noticed that. •277324_277366•
*ANN:	I mean who who cares for the electricity? •277366_277502•
        It's gotta be on someone's electric hasn't it? •277779_277932•
        You can't, one flat's not gonna be responsible for having the hall lit up all night long which it will be and then  length of time, unless it's on a timer switch. •277932_279259•
*STU:	Mm  that is something we will have to investigate. •279603_279827•
*ANN:	I know. •279827_279839•
*STU:	discuss with our •279859_280070•
*ANN:	I mean with •280090_280232•
*STU:	 ((cough)) 
*ANN:	Steven's flat the council are responsible for lighting hallways but we  they're not  •280234_280669•
*STU:	No, no  that's right. •280698_280792•
*ANN:	They must be on some sort of a  one of the meters or somebody's meter or somewhere. •281084_281570•
*STU:	Yeah. •281570_281583•
