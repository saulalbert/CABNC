*WEN:	Well 
*BEV:	years.
*WEN:	yeah, not so, so confident but if you don't make the attempt

*WEN:	And you've done this all before under worse circumstances.
*BEV:	Yes.
*WEN:	Oh well  (        ) , I really do!But I think sometimes   (.) I mean you've either got to do what you do   (.) coming back from Germany   (.) I think you have to take the bull by the horns don't you?
*BEV:	Oh yeah!
*WEN:	And I tell you, I don't know what this is.
*BEV:	Well I don't.
*WEN:	Or if it's gonna occur   (.) but it seems to me   (.) it would, or sounds like   (.) it would be a simple let in   (.) to the 
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	to the situation.
*BEV:	Mm. (        ) .
*WEN:	Erm   (.) that's only what I heard, that's all!I don't think it's a   (.) massive place that   (.) you know, I I just think it's like   (.) a warehouse thing.A  (        ) .
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	A   (        ) might be the word.I don't know!But it was no different from me starting work up here   (.) that time
*BEV:	After so long
*WEN:	after so long, which it was a long time.Course it isn't!It ju it's just the same.But in the end I had to do it   (.) didn't I?
*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Well you have to do it.If the circumstances are such   (.) you have to do it.And er   (.) I say, that   (.) well purely taking the bull by the horns innit?Really?
*BEV:	I know.
*WEN:	It's for your own benefit because 
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	whatever it pays if it's, if it's better   (.) will pay more than   (.) obviously what you're gonna get from either or.Then go in or
*BEV:	Well I shall still get his.
*WEN:	Yeah, I know you still get his.
*BEV:	But   (.) I won't 
*WEN:	Well you ca 
*BEV:	I won't get the income.

*WEN:	and that's where it should be nice   (.) made a change didn't they?
*BEV:	Yeah.
*WEN:	You know?That's where it made a difference   (.) but I was   (.) sticking in all the blinking week   (.) I'll save that till he gets home but   (.) apart from 
*BEV:	That's rubbish innit?
*WEN:	Well apart the radio   (.) but I expect they're gonna   (.) a radio of sorts you know?But er   (.) no I say, the choice is yours.Certainly!Well that, the first step's some when   (.) will have to be taken
*BEV:	Well the longer I leave it the worse it'll get.
*WEN:	Certainly will!But then, I mean a actually I mean as I said, Lesley ain't that bothered   (.) because of what he's giving her
*BEV:	Mm.
*WEN:	but at the same time   (.) she's got all lethargic   (.) cos 
*BEV:	Yeah.
