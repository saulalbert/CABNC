*LYN:	Yes. •_•
        He looks like Sean Connery. •_•
        I offered to carry, pleaded  •_•
*CHR:	Oh Lynda! •_•
        Yes, well you'd be cramping his style wouldn't you? •_•
        Yes. •_•
*LYN:	And er  he had a partner, an equal partner who I don't know if he'd ever met him, I think he had. •_•
        Well he was out playing golf  fairly recently he just dropped dead. •_•
        Forty eight. •_•
        keeled over and died. •_•
        So I'm amazed this guy's •_•
*CHR:	I hope it wasn't on the green. •_•
*LYN:	So do I. •_•
*CHR:	Dent, dent the turf. •_•
        Gosh. •_•
        I hope he didn't bleed or anything like that. •_•
*LYN:	I think he, you know, quite clean corpse. •_•
        From what I gather. •_•
        I would have thought it would have put his partner off playing golf for life. •_•
*CHR:	Yes. •_•
        You'd have thought so wouldn't you? •_•
        Still I imagine many men would say what a way to go. •_•
*LYN:	Yes. •_•
*CHR:	I wouldn't. •_•
        Far better way to go than that but  •_•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Who knows I might even get a chance to try one of these days. •_•
*LYN:	As long as you don't die with bells on your ankles. •_•
*CHR:	. •_•
        Well then at least I'm  they'd bury me with bells on my ankles then. •_•
*LYN:	bills have my name, it's obviously hiding. •_•
*CHR:	Now erm  you did bring a  a very good point there Lynda . •_•
        Erm which was that erm  what was it  •_•
*LYN:	Pensions  •_•
*CHR:	Yes. •_•
        Absolutely. •_•
*LYN:	remember what, what he said last. •_•
        But I'll see if I can find  . •_•
*CHR:	I would have thought that he would have been down slightly more  less  •_•
*LYN:	Illegible   •_•
*CHR:	proportions, yes. •_•
