*HUG:	Mm.American stuff.
*BAR:	through the, yeah, I'm gonna 
*HUG:	Mhm.
*BAR:	the thing is, you see, if we do it an American flavour   (.) I mean, people expect heavy rock music in an 
*HUG:	Mm.
*BAR:	American bar don't they?
*HUG:	Mm.
*BAR:	I mean, you expect to be going in and listening to Bon Jovi and, and   (.) Free, and you know   (.) in the background don't you?
*HUG:	You have  (        ) .
*BAR:	Yeah.Well I mean
*HUG:	Put in jukeboxes.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*HUG:	I mean, you could be up with the fucking   (        ) couldn't you?For 
*BAR:	Well that's, well, well, well, we're thinking of opening 
*HUG:	Just as a pub like.
*BAR:	yeah, we're gonna open as a pub during the summer   (.) erm
*HUG:	What about all these Barry?
*BAR:	No, we'll keep those for su you never know.
*HUG:	Yeah, okay.Put them in here?
*BAR:	So we have   (.) and erm   (.) we're gonna open up the top bar, top bar   (.) and ripping up the carpet 
*HUG:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	in the main room, and lino in the main floor   (.) right, in, in sort of 
*HUG:	Which one?
*BAR:	probably blue 
*HUG:	The   (        ) one?
*BAR:	Yeah.And redoing the stage floor.And I'm   (.) carpeting   (.) I think I'll carpet tile 
*HUG:	Have you had a price on what it's gonna cost to put that down?
*BAR:	Not that much, cos we're getting the lino off Pete you see, and get the discount off   (        ) to do the, just for the lino 
*HUG:	Oh right!Yeah, course.
*BAR:	and then make it 
*HUG:	Rhona's husband?
*BAR:	Yeah.Ex-husband, yeah.Erm, and having a carpet tile   (.) because we can then do it red, white, and, not white, but red and blue   (.) you know.
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	And, if you 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	damage a tile, then you're only replacing a tile.And just sort of carpet the two top areas, two raised areas, and have the other, the rest of it as a sort of lino   (.) floor.
*HUG:	Mm.
*BAR:	So then, then it, allows to dance as well, and basically   (.) hardly anybody sits in that area until the club's full anyway
*HUG:	Mm mm.
*BAR:	so that they all go in the  (        ) .Erm, going to somehow, at the moment we're thinking of   (.) well Jean'll wanna do it, but I'm   (.) I'm thinking of doing some kind of   (.) I mean, we're agreed on what we're gonna do, but it's how we do it, I want some ka er, some kind of grilling around the top, the cocktail bar area, so you can open it as a, as a bar, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere in itself, so we open that as a pub type of thing, you know.
*HUG:	Oh right!Yeah, yeah, yeah. (        ) 
*BAR:	Leave the big screen on and that and we can put   (.) erm   (.) and get, you know, as I say, if you 
*HUG:	Do you 
*BAR:	you get, see if we can get hold of like, I mean you won't be able to get hold of a Wurlitzer because nowadays they're like gold dust, but you might be able to get hold of parts, you see.If you could just get hold of say, the rainbow
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	effect of a Wurli I mean, that's the beauty about it   (.) you, you'll never get hold of a Harley Davidson, but you might get hold of a petrol cap.
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	You know, or things 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	like that, you know 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and you just bang those around the place.Er, a few handlebars and whatever else and, but, but   (.) but don't do it like the British bikers, do it like an American   (.) bar, so it can be cleaned and
*HUG:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	I mean it can look nice and 
*HUG:	Yeah.
*BAR:	sparkling and fiftiesey, and   (.) lots of   (.) pictures and
*HUG:	Not the dirty bloody smell and greasy  (        ) .
*BAR:	No, that's right, yeah.That's right.You see, and then if, if, if, if, if sort of people are, you know, holiday makers come in, and it's an American theme, they expect it.
*HUG:	Mm.
*BAR:	As I say, they expect I've got music, it's not gonna come as a shock to them.
*HUG:	They've got   (        ) 
*BAR:	You know, and it'll, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I think.And, and it won't cost a lot to do, cos all you do instead of green, you'll paint that red   (.) and you've got the white pick out anyway, and a blue, seated blue carpet.
*HUG:	I wondered what those fucking  (        ) !
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*HUG:	No, where am I gonna be able to get rid of this?
*BAR:	I don't know.
*HUG:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	I think we'll have to, I think we've got to keep it cos I think it's part of the fixtures and fittings unfortunately.
*HUG:	 ((laugh))  ((cough)) 
*BAR:	And I'm gonna do er, you know, lots of   (.) promotions and stuff   (.) promotions   (        ) on that 
*HUG:	And then your promotions, yeah?
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.We well what I think I'm gonna do is next Thur not this Thursday, we'll just have to live through this Thursday, but next Thursday, erm   (.) I'm gonna get   (.) get Stella back on, and I'm just gonna sell it as cost, whatever it is, sixty P a pint or whatever.
*HUG:	 (        ) ?
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean, cos at the end of the day if you've got the, if you've got, if you can get er sixty people 
*HUG:	You'll   (        ) 
*BAR:	two fifty to come in, I don't mind if I'm giving the booze away!And er, as long you got the  (        ) .
*HUG:	As long as you're not losing on it.Yeah.
*BAR:	Well it doesn't matter does it?You know   (.) cos that's the only way we're gonna build Thursdays up.No
*HUG:	That'll be gone then.
*BAR:	Je Jean's   (.) is it?Right.Get rid of it.
*HUG:	Oh no, maybe not.
*BAR:	Jean's doing tonight.
*HUG:	I thought it had gone off.
*BAR:	Jean's doing tonight, and I'm doing Friday and Saturday.So er
*HUG:	She's away int she?
*BAR:	She's away.Yeah.
*HUG:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	Er   (.) but, you know, I, I'd, as I say, I think er   (.) and then if we just, if we can just pick up like the odd   (.) I mean, I've, I've had a   (.) long chat with Anne, we've had a long, erm meeting with Anne  yesterday about it, and she's gonna start pushing   (.) cos you know, she's really done the Royal upstairs, it's 
*HUG:	Mm.
*BAR:	a really beautiful room, but it only holds about forty, fifty people, what she's gonna do is push the weddings, but she's gonna, and say look, you can use this place
*HUG:	For the reception.
*BAR:	For any, any, anything bigger, you know, you've got 
*HUG:	Well for dancing.Yes.Yes.
*BAR:	you've got forty people, you want somewhere bigger, then fine.Cos er, Mark last week said er, he'd been approached by a wedding to do a disco, he said well I can't it's a Saturday, and then he said well, you know, where are you having the reception, said well we're looking round at the moment.
*HUG:	Mm.
*BAR:	Well can't, he said look   (.) have a word, and he said to me, you know, do you mind if we do like eight till eleven o'clock as a wedding party
*HUG:	Right, yeah.Well 
*BAR:	and then we just do the disco afterwards 
*HUG:	Anyone can stay on if they want can't they?
*BAR:	That's right.So we just get them in, we open up our doors at ten o'clock.And I mean, I wanna change the ten o'clock opening, it's bloody silly is that!That's just bloody ridiculous that!I mean, we may as well come in at twenty to ten, and, and have twenty minutes of   (.) you know   (.) because, nine thirty    (        )  (.) you know.The only people you get in before nine thirty don't drink anyway do they?
*HUG:	No.
