*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*KB0PSUN:	So it 's just simply to er comment about the the future work that 's gon na be done by Glanmole er the work of investigation as I understand it at the end of that first section .  218316_228866
*KB0PSUN:	Really two things brought up investigation to consider the first is with trusts the very important piece of work that 's done by trusts on behalf of the provence another provence may or may not know that there are the trusts have now been er between trusts erm South Wales trusts erm .  228866_250726
*KB0PSUN:	Monmouthshire .  250726_250786
*KB0PSUN:	North Wales trust and Monmouthshire have now all been amalgamated into one and we 're working through the implications of that And we have had the trust secretary who has been working on our behalf voluntarily for some time now I do n't think anybody appreciates just how much and I would like to put it on record how much George does on behalf of the provence a very considerable piece of work If you were part of the trust meetings and saw the degree of work that he does do regularly on our behalf it is quite considerable he does n't do it for nothing I ca n't imagine that George is gon na continuing doing that forever and it may well be that we 'll be faced with a possibility of of what we do in the future to have that piece of administration done will we be able to assume that it could done voluntary in the future Or will it be part of the administrative task of the church So I 'd I 'd like that to be er considered er when this whole investigation is carried on And the second point too is to say is to ask at least to consider whether then in some centres the work of the Synod ought to be trimmed down to match the particular work that is being done I mean tha is it all you know do we need all the time to have erm extra administrative help and in in and in terms of which we 've been talking about before I know they might sound like two conflicting issues but one of the ways of ensuring we get the work done is do we trying too much at the Synod Should we be thrusting more work down to districts and th and they 'll to do the job rather than always assume it should be done at this level .  252266_346312
*PS008:	I think I 'm not going to encourage debate on that I think we 've heard what Kenneth said particularly about the trusts the working done by the trust and would suggest that we ask Granville to take that on board as well and be within the presentations too And I think some would be the less about the too much work perhaps being done by Synod and not enough by districts I think it is something that we should encourage churches to talk about the districts to talk about speaking of the district secretary I .  349762_380692
*KB0PSUN:	0 . 
*PS008:	But there we are I I think we 'll just take that on board like that Erm resolution that Synod appoints Jo John as Synod clerk for a period of up to three years to commence at a date mutually convenient to him and the present Synod clerk Those in favour of that resolution Any against Right I think erm we are not going to say thank you to Eileen now because she is not finishing as Synod clerk and that 's a conscious decision It may be that er Eileen will be Synod clerk this time next year as well we do n't know .  380942_423175

*PS008:	when when Synod clerk has changed But we 're grateful to Eileen for what she is doing and will continue to do and we 're grateful to John for what he intends to do erm for three years at any stage wha at any stage in which they choose thank you Then resolution three that Synod appoints the Reverend David Henry and Nanette as the rep as representatives on the Mission Council and this pertaining to paragraph two Firstly I think I should say that straight away one hopes that these three erm and that 's regrettable But the background is that of fifty letters were sent out to a variety of people er lay and ordained whatever that means .  439475_490063

*PS006:	Well I felt one of two ways firstly when we 're looking for a moderator of the urc we 're looking for a moderator for the whole church And secondly in terms of Liz Liz is someone I know extremely well and have worked with in various functions and committees over the past We have someone always there for those who have er society those who are poor er women er many of the issues that we feel very strongly and here here She had no sort of cultural historic resonance with the nation of Wales but I 'm sure her and the way she approaches her whole ministry would mean that she 'd have a lot of than those of us here in the urc in Wales .  751765_789875
