                  about six and a half feet tall you know!
                  [1280] And they don't take any crap from anyone, [laughing] I
                  tell you [] !
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1281] Don't they?
                  [1282] Oh oh oh!
Fiona (PS06G)     [1283] I said , I said we've been doing boundaries for the
                  trial park today and they ran out of passes and gave us these
                  and said they'd be alright.
                  [1284] And he goes, er I'm not sure ah, and he nearly let us
                  in there and then but he had to go and see somebody else and
                  he said tell them to go away!
                  [1285] [laughing] So we had to go away [] !
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1286] That was the first attempt?
Fiona (PS06G)     [1287] That's the first time and then we ... and then we were
                  still around the back and we darted up over these banks
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1288] Ha!
Fiona (PS06G)     [1289] and into these trees and ... where we were up there no
                  one could see us and we could see the place, so we would see
                  all the gaps in the fences.
                  [1290] So we planned out our next move and went ... just went
                  down and did it!
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1291] [laughing] Oh God!
                  [1292] Next to the [...] [] !
Fiona (PS06G)     [laugh]
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1293] Sounds li like the S A S!

Fiona (PS06G)     [1295] Mm.
                  [1296] Took us about ten minutes.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1297] Well you're very brave!
                  [1298] I wouldn't do it!
                  [1299] I'd be frightened to death!
                  [1300] See and all that screaming and all that aggravation
                  could have been avoided if you'd have known you were going to
                  get in.
Fiona (PS06G)     [1301] Well I mean ... that's him isn't it?
                  [1302] Noisy for that reason.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1303] Well Dad ... [laughing] and Sophie told him exactly
                  what, what he was like and everything [] ... thought oh my
                  God!

Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1308] I'll say!
                  [1309] He went berserk!
Fiona (PS06G)     [1310] What, all because he couldn't go out?
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1311] Yep!
                  [1312] It's just because ... he couldn't go out anywhere, he
                  couldn't erm ... he couldn't do what he wanted!
Fiona (PS06G)     [1313] Pathetic behaviour that is innit?
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [1314] Mm!
                  [1315] It's embarrassing isn't it?
                  [1316] He nearly stamped his feet!
                  [1317] Now I want to know the truth about this coat business,
                  [whispering] I won't say anything to him don't worry [] !

*** 23 (Tape 040508) ***
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2512] Masters again, yeah.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2513] What do you mean masters?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2514] Mastered to get into the race.
                  [2515] Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and
                  initiative and you're in!
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2516] I bet, I bet ... he's scared
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2517] I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and
                  there's [...] for security guards.
                  [2518] You cannot walk past them if ... you're going in that
                  way.
                  [2519] So we had to go ... past this little shed which is
                  right up ... right up this stupid grass earthy bank ... right
                  over the side so we could see quickly how to get in.
                  [2520] Went right round the bottom of this field, looked
                  round the bank and there was just a bloody great ... hole in
                  the gate ... massive!
                  [2521] Walked through there and got to the simulator ... took
                  our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in ... walked
                  straight past and we were right on site!
                  [2522] We wasn't aware it was there.
                  [2523] Well I thought, saved us twenty quid!
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2524] So all ... [...] ?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2525] We were going , we were in!
                  [2526] We're in!
                  [2527] We're in!
                  [2528] Pretty good!
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2529] So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all
                  wasn't it really?
                  [2530] Eh?
                  [2531] All that
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2532] And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2533] Have you got to pass for the stage then?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2534] Yeah.
                  [2535] I used an
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2536] What
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2537] old one.
                  [2538] So ... those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I
                  just turned mine ... turned mine round she saw it and went
                  ... she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't ... thought it
                  perhaps a different pass but it wasn't ... just turned it
                  round on her.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2539] I bet your ... friends a will be ... sick then, won't
                  they?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2540] I just think that when you're up there it's like the
                  stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long
                  one!
                  [2541] And there must have been about ten thousand there last
                  time.
                  [2542] They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in ... and
                  you can spin round.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2543] Oh yeah!
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2544] They had one of those in there ... but I didn't have a
                  go on it though, it was about three quid to go on!
                  [2545] Those lasers ... lasers that [...] ... the [...] .
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2546] Velcro walls?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2547] No, they didn't have that there.
                  [2548] A huge octopus, [...] octopus ... -ish, had these
                  massive ... tentacles that's going right the way across the
                  ceiling!
                  [2549] [...] ... Video screens.
                  [2550] ... Very good!
                  [2551] They're all gonna be pissed on Friday cos we got in
                  for nothing!
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2552] Why is your voice so quiet?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2553] Cos ... the washing machine out there ... it's [...] .
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2554] What sort of smoke ... from the machine?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2555] Hiss!
                  [2556] Oh it's [...] ?
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2557] [laughing] No [] !
                  [2558] What hissing?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2559] Proper smoke machine.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2560] Oh!
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2561] Mum!
                  [2562] I've got to write to Bicksons.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2563] Mm.
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2564] Ask them to write me a reference so I got form to fill
                  in ... to send off for something but I've gotta write
                  something.
                  [2565] And I've gotta to, I've gotta say something to them.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2566] Yeah, well?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2567] And I dunno who I'm writing to either.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2568] Well, put the ... Principal.
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2569] What should I say?
                  [2570] What do you think I should say?
                  [2571] Ask to write me a ... ah I know who I'll ask, alright.

Lorraine (PS06H)  [2572] Well cos said that ... this guy said that 's the guy
                  in [...] so I could

Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2575] have to send him a stamped ... envelope with the
                  address of the guy and putting ... [...] on it.
                  [2576] He'll be more inclined to ... do it then won't he?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2577] Oh what , what inside in the
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2578] Inside the ... letter that you're ... writing to him.
                  [2579] I think that that would probably be quite a good idea
                  wouldn't it, really?
                  [2580] ... Yes?
                  [2581] You must be exhausted?
                  [2582] Why don't you go to sleep?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2583] [...] this stuff haven't I?
                  [2584] I've got things to do.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2585] I suppose we could ... just ignore it.
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2586] It's a waste of a day isn't it, really?
                  [2587] I'd rather be ... extremely tired.
                  [2588] ... Saw Zac last night.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2589] What did erm, he say?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2590] That's why, I said I, I said I'd heard about you in
                  the papers and the ... just said oh yeah!
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2591] Was he embarrassed?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2592] No.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2593] Wouldn't you be?
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2594] A bit, yeah.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2595] I'd be very embarrassed!
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2596] See you've got that thing going whilst my voice is
                  going.
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2597] It's alright.
                  [2598] I took it down to the Spar shop as well.
Lorraine (PS06H)  [2599] Did you?
Cherrilyn (PS06A) [2600] And erm ... I took it ... to the ... park with Jack

                           there, a few others.
Cherrilyn (PS06A)          [2727] I thought, I thought that Matthew was
Lorraine (PS06H)           [2728] No he's not there, he's skint!
Cherrilyn (PS06A)          [2729] God he's spent ... he's spent all his grant
                           hasn't he?
                           [2730] God!
                           [2731] He's gonna get into some awful trouble isn't
                           he?
Lorraine (PS06H)           [2732] Mm.
Cherrilyn (PS06A)          [2733] I mean, he's nearly as ... as overdrawn as
                           Sophie and she's, she's nearly completed her course!
Lorraine (PS06H)           [2734] I know!
                           [2735] He just hasn't got a clue though!
                           [2736] He doesn't care yo ... hasn't got a clue!
Cherrilyn (PS06A)          [2737] He must be worried about it though?
                           [2738] Surely he must be worried?
Lorraine (PS06H)           [2739] Well I was talking to him about it, I said I
                           reckon you've spent the ... you've spent quite a bit
                           now so you might as well just go another ... get

                           [2744] Because when he's in there his wage packets
                           are like minus fifteen pounds when he's in there!
Cherrilyn (PS06A)          [2745] Why?
Lorraine (PS06H)           [2746] Because he spends it all!
                           [2747] ... So really he's got to get a job which is
                           gonna ... pay the majority of it off.

Cherrilyn (PS06A) [3231] don't you?

                  cheaper.
                  [3251] The price per pound was the ... same, I think.
