*TRA:	I asked him     (.)  (        )  (.) did you have a sweet?He said, no, he said th that you could either have one or the other.
*ANN:	It was a lot weren't it for 
*TRA:	They have a sweet or a starters, but they didn't have them both.
*ANN:	There's one at sixty odd which is, I think ri quite reasonable for three but   (.) eighty odd for three of them!It must have been a right 
*TRA:	 (        ) of course it was 
*ANN:	posh 
*TRA:	more expensive   (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah , it must have been.As long as it were worth it! ((laugh)) 
*TRA:	Never saw, you weren't meant to, and he says, no your mum said that we could either have a sweet or a starter, not both.
*ANN:	Yeah.It sounds awfully mean don't it?I, I said to your dad   (.) I said it's   (.) mm mm   (.) you know   (.) to actually say you can't have 
*TRA:	Well if they were, if they were going home they wouldn't be   (.) having a starter and a steak and a sweet and all that lot would they?
*ANN:	No, but they are inconvenienced cos they're away from home but 
*TRA:	But   (.) i i it's just
*ANN:	Well I don't know, I feel happier now your dad's had that bit of a do with that bloke, cos I feel that   (.) we can go to him
*TRA:	Yeah.
*ANN:	and, and wi you know, hopefully get paid, there shouldn't be any problem. (.) Cos that erm   (.) that Sen, that   (.) accountant obviously isn't up to much.He promised your dad, oh it'll all be sorted within twenty four, forty eight hours and that was how many, three
*TRA:	Yeah.
*ANN:	four days ago?
*TRA:	I don't think he knows everything ab about that or what?
*ANN:	Erm   (.) he, he told him this morning on the phone, he's looked into it, he's the director   (.) and he apologizes.He rung to apologize this morning and said that it will be sorted   (.) and you will have your cheque.He said, I am sorry!I didn't realize things were like this.
*TRA:	That's why   (.) you sent them the conditions!
*ANN:	Well, that's what Andrew said.If, if they'd have   (.) if they'd have talked to Andrew first, Andrew would have told him why we'd sent it.
*TRA:	Andrew can't  (        ) , he's just sort of passed that, that on.Why has it gone to somebody who  (        ) ?
*ANN:	Well apparently   (.) it had gone to Andrew, and, Andrew had   (.) cos Andrew isn't in the office all the time, and he'd left it in the office, and   (.) I think they faxed it   (.) by th Andrew was gonna talk to somebody about it, but of course, by the time he'd got there, it'd already been done and this had happened so   (.) I'm gonna ring erm   (.) Job Centre when I get home.
*TRA:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I, they'll say, I know what they're gonna say.Like, you know   (.) there's nothing they can do. (.) That's why, she'll be better to   (.) stick it and then she was to Aunty Anne's.At least when she finishes at, with Aunty Anne, it was seasonal.
*TRA:	 (        ) she, she   (.) Anne's gone    (.)  (        ) Aunty Anne's, she won't have to go to that job  (        ) .

*ANN:	get the video.
*TRA:	Just, it's half an hour   (        ) wanted to watch that on B B C two   (.) half past eight to nine o'clock.
*ANN:	Oh I think it'd be nice to have a video, because like, when Rebecca gets older   (.) erm   (.) cos I personally, my own feelings are that   (.) we might get Charles as King, but after Charles there won't be anything cos they'll do away with them.
*TRA:	D'ya think?
*ANN:	Yeah.I think it will get to that.There's more and 
*TRA:	In the end.
