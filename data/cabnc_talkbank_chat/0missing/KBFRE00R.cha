*PS04U:	Did you see you with that gas that advert she did with that poor woman . 
*PS04Y:	Yes .

*PS04Y:	Well she she 's she gets up and does things does n't she . 
*PS04U:	Yeah that 's what I mean they say ooh ca n't stand this woman sh but I mean I do n't know why .

*PS04U:	Probably . 
*PS04Y:	Hell of a lot of . 
*PS04U:	I mean . 
*PS04Y:	jealousy .

*PS04U:	this is taping now so what was erm Libertys did they have it Re remind me tomorrow I must take those twenty vouchers . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	to erm Debs . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	and Jenny was saying she went to Debenhams yesterday they had a twelve day spectacular at eight thirty to eight thirty at night there was clothes they were half price plus you got a third of ten per cent off . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	But I think a all the sales will be off before Christmas . 
*PS04Y:	I I looked at the fabrics in the Libertys . 
*PS04U:	Yeah . 
*PS04Y:	and if I ca n't get want I want at the Famlingham Textile Centre which is excellent when I next need fabrics I shall come up I will come up to London and I 'll go to Libertys but I will have measured first of all to within an inch as to what I want because . 
*PS04U:	It is expensive . 
*PS04Y:	Well some of the stuff is eighteen pounds a meter but if you think of the cost of a a well fitting jacket for somebody like myself it 's astronomical . 
*PS04U:	You know what you should have done while you was up there this time you should have took asked for some samples . 
*PS04Y:	Yes my dear I I did not feel well enough just . 
*PS04U:	No do you think that they will . 
*PS04Y:	I did n't even think about yes they will they 'll give you a little cutting I suppose . 
*PS04U:	Yeah but not only that I mean they will now all these shops are doing like a mail order . 
*PS04Y:	That 's interesting . 
*PS04U:	and they would actually send and I know why because erm John Lewis in London erm Jackie wanted some fabric and she 'd seen it up there and Harrods and erm she found out she did n't have her card with her just her Barclaycard said would you post this we wou we 'll have to charge you like two pound . 
*PS04Y:	Mm mm . 
*PS04U:	fifty packaging but that 's fine she said . 
*PS04Y:	Well yes it 's very good . 
*PS04U:	well I could n't get up there because she know . 
*PS04Y:	Quite . 
*PS04U:	park . 
*PS04Y:	Quite . 
*PS04U:	and she wanted sort of so many meters of each . 
*PS04Y:	Mm yeah . 
*PS04U:	and the the they sent it to her . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	And I suppose you could treat . 
*PS04Y:	Worth going . 
*PS04U:	people this year if they 'd done all their Christmas shopping mail order . 
*PS04Y:	Oh yes yes . 
*PS04U:	Rather than sort of go round themselves I reckon we 'll take that with us . 
*PS04Y:	Good idea . 
*PS04U:	Might want them for a cup of tea . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah . 
*PS04U:	I think we should have got away with a small Coke should n't we . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	That 's nice of them . 
*PS04Y:	It 's so big . 
*PS04U:	We 've been thrilled with this work experience cos was Dave originally had these five days off taping and he said no he said you know you 're so tired have a little rest we 'll go up I 'll go up on the train only to get to the Selhurst Park he 's got four or five train journeys . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah mm . 
*PS04U:	and he has to get like Woking to Surbiton Surbiton to Clapham Junction . 
*PS04Y:	Yeah . 
*PS04U:	Clapham Junction to S S erm Thornton Heath and he has Thornton Heath to Selhurst Park . 
*PS04Y:	Mm yes . 
*PS04U:	So it 's five trips . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	there 's no easier . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	way . 
*PS04Y:	No no . 
*PS04U:	round it and like Dave said it would 've cost him sort of seven or eight pound a day in petrol . 
*PS04Y:	Mm quite . 
*PS04U:	and he managed to get a ticket for a week . 
*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	for fifteen .

*PS04U:	pounds . 
*PS04Y:	Yes yes quite . 
*PS04U:	You know it . 
*PS04Y:	Yes . 
*PS04U:	but erm I bought . 
*PS04Y:	0 . 
*PS04U:	sort of quarter past seven he 's had to leave in the morning to get there and then not getting home to sort of seven o'clock Dave picks up from the station and I think . 
*PS04Y:	Part of life . 
*PS04U:	and I sort of said to him it 's he 's enjoyed it he has n't sort of moaned .

*PS04Y:	Mm . 
*PS04U:	And erm he he said it 's stupid he said they were given all this and it 's the homework it 's nothing to do with the revision you 've got to do in his the exams .

*PS04Y:	No no I ca n't I just ca n't eat so I 'm not forcing myself to eat what I 'm trying to do is only to eat the right things and I must start vitamin supplements I think I 've got the age when I probably need that I mean this cold is a warning to me that my immune system is not as strong as it ought to be I should n't have had another cold so soon after getting rid of one . 
*PS04U:	Crikey cos the last time you were down you had that stinker did n't you . 
*PS04Y:	Yes yes and this one is n't as bad but I should n't be having this one at all .
