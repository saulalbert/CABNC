*SUE:	that he's not even to phone the place. 
*JEA:	That's right.  told him that, because 
*SUE:	Yeah but why don't   tell the girls? 
*JEA:	Well exactly. 
*SUE:	Because you know what, they're up in the air aren't they? 
*JEA:	Yeah  (  ) , can you believe it? 
*NON:	Mm 
*JEA:	And why? Why can't he ph  , that's ridiculous isn't it?  I said   
*SUE:	 Oh well  if he wants to know why I'm there and   (  ) me are you off sick I shall just show him a   (.) I've got proof that I've been off sick. ((laugh))  
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  Show him your scar   ((laugh))

*JEA:	Well I know you're off but I mean that  (  )

*JEA:	What, today? (  )

*JEA:	 Well yeah that's true. 
*SUE:	until he turns up. 
*STU:	No. 
*SUE:	Can you? 
*JEA:	True. But the thing is   (.) he he's gonna be ever so, isn't he? He'll be making excuses all the way round    (  )   
*SUE:	  ((whispering)) No I've gotta go . 
*JEA:	Eh? 
*SUE:	He he won't be there long if he does come.

*STU:	 Yeah.  See you tomorrow. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JEA:	Just lock up and   (.) do what you like to the cat. You can either leave it in or out you know.  Don't   (  )   
*STU:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	Okay. 
*JEA:	Okay. 
*ANN:	Cheerio. 
*STU:	Toodaloo. 
*JEA:	Yeah. See   (.) are you coming round tomorrow afternoon Stuart? 
*STU:	Yes mum. 
*JEA:	 You

*JEA:	 Oh aye yeah Ann.  Are you bringing yours? 
*ANN:	Yeah, well there's no point in going home. 
*JEA:	No that's true. That's true.  (  ) okay. 
*ANN:	Bye. 
*JEA:	See you. Bye. 
*STU:	See you tomorrow. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (6.0)  ((mimics tea pouring)) 
*STU:	There we go. Is that better dear? 
*ANN:	Yeah. That's lovely. 
*STU:	Shall we have a nice cup of tea? 
*ANN:	I was gasping. Especially when that man was  (.)  
*STU:	Rabbitting? 
*ANN:	Yeah, which I didn't understand any of it. 
*STU:	No. 
*ANN:	Pension mortgages and this mortgage and and he didn't really know how er er   (.) cos that that foreign Lucy or whatever her name was 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	that foreign lady was quite amused. She was laughing when you were asking him questions. ((laugh))  
*STU:	Oh. 
*ANN:	 ((laughing)) as if to say ah ah   (.) he's not sure what he's doing.  (.) He's got somebody here who knows . 
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	 ((laughing)) Instead of just sitting there and  quoting all these figures   
*STU:	  (  ) yeah   
*ANN:	and blinding you with science . 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Somebody who can ask questions and knew what he was talking about. ((laugh))  
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	And she was giggling away. She kept raising her eyebrows and laughing.  ((laugh)) I was watching her. 
*STU:	Well I couldn't see her cos  I had my back turned. 
*ANN:	 No you had your back to her. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	But I could see behind you and she was   (.)  ((laugh))  
*STU:	Well there you are. When you do know a bit about it  you yes you want to know   
*ANN:	 Well that's it.  You're not, and you're not gonna be blinded by all these   (.) like he was, what was he saying about   (.) all endowments are are not unit  then you were saying yes they are and   ((laugh))   
*STU:	 I didn't know   (.) what   (  ) on about  there. I I think he got his 
*ANN:	 (  ) said that. 
*STU:	Oh he knew what he was talking about but  (.)  
*ANN:	But you were confusing him because you knew, where he's used to just sitting there and telling blah blah blah blah and 
*STU:	Well you see the thing is they they  they   
*ANN:	 And you  knew what he was on about. 
*STU:	they quote this unit linked business.  Now it's all   
*ANN:	 And you didn't want that did you? 
*STU:	well and good a unit linked policy but   (.) as I said to you before that   (.) if they, if the market crashes the day before your policy  is due out you   
*ANN:	 And you haven't got enough  money. 
*STU:	you could, you can lose a th   (.) I don't want one. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	If the market crashes the day before you take your policy's due to mature   (.) wallop. You can lose a lot of money in a   (.) you know, just like that. 
*ANN:	 But do you think this thing  what he was on about, pension   (.) mortgage, do you think that would be better? Was that that PEP thing what's all in the papers at the moment? 
*STU:	No. 
*ANN:	Is that what it means? 
*STU:	PEP's different. 
*ANN:	Oh. Is it similar? 
*STU:	PEP's a personal equity plan. 
*ANN:	Oh. Sorry. 
*STU:	Which is different.  (.) To be perfectly honest   (.) in my current situation 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*STU:	a pension mortgage   (.) would be more advantageous. 
*ANN:	Well that's the most important thing isn't it? 
*STU:	At the moment. Because well I'm not in a pension scheme at work. But I have got an option to go in it 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	if I want to. 
*ANN:	Mhm. 
*STU:	Erm   (.) the only problem is   (.) well, even s  even, not so much now because   (.) because the er    (.)  (  ) a bit better.  (.) Because of the m  because of the way pensions and that are are organized now, they're more flexible now   (.) I mean, you can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension scheme, you were obliged to go in it   (.) that was it. All your other arrangements went up, went through the window. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	Erm so it it it it's difficult. 
*ANN:	Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays  can't you and   (  ) into a   
*STU:	 You can now take, now now now you can take them  with you. 
*ANN:	Mm. Where they used to be frozen and then you started another one  wherever you went next time. 
*STU:	 That's right.  That's right.  Whereas now   (  )   
*ANN:	 And you ended up with three four  d  silly little bits and pieces didn't you? 
*STU:	Yeah. Yeah. Whereas now you see all the  they can put them all into one. 
*ANN:	Yeah. I know you can take them with you now. 
*STU:	Mm. So in a way I think 
*ANN:	And it was a lot less money as well wasn't it? 
*STU:	I mm yeah but that w   don't forget   
*ANN:	 It started   
*STU:	that was sixty five. 
*ANN:	Yeah  (  ) . 
*STU:	The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true they double every five years. Particularly in the later years there's you know 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	more   (.) And that's why I said, when it sounded so low   (.) that's why I I still doubt his figures. I still think two hundred pound a month   (.) a thirty thousand pound mortgage   (.)  it's too low. 
*ANN:	 And and  a cash sum at the end of it. 
*STU:	Still think it's low. 
*ANN:	Seems quite   (.) doesn't seem a lot does it? 
*STU:	No.  I'm pretty certain   
*ANN:	 And would you still have to  have an insurance on top of that? 
*STU:	You have to have term assurance. 
*ANN:	So you'd still have to have  (.)  
*STU:	You'd have 
*ANN:	you'd have the two hundred pound and then you'd have a life insurance on top? 
*STU:	No no no. No. That was it, two hundred  and twelve pound   
*ANN:	 The whole lot? 
*STU:	The whole lot. 
*ANN:	Well why doesn't everybody have them then? 
*STU:	Because not everybody's eligible for them. 
*ANN:	I know but they didn't, he didn't suggest it to you or   (.) why doesn't he say well there is this er er, you said that he didn't. And he must have known that they're gonna be cheaper so why doesn't he advise people who are starting out to take one of them? 
*STU:	Didn't ask  (  )  
*ANN:	Rather than a 
*STU:	Didn't ask the questions. 
*ANN:	I know, exactly. But  surely that's   
*STU:	 He didn't   (.) he   
*ANN:	his job. If he's trying to find you the cheapest 
*STU:	He's not doing his job.  Basically   
*ANN:	 Exactly. 
*STU:	he's not doing his job. 
*ANN:	Because a young couple going in   (.) well even in our situation, you haven't got much money and you want the cheapest thing for the best   (.) we  you know. But he never suggested it. You said   (.) what about a company, what about a a pension  mortgage and he   
*STU:	 He didn't, he  he didn't ask the question. Which he should have asked. 
*ANN:	Mm. Exactly. Yeah because it is cheaper and 
*STU:	You see the thing is   (.) you see I mean wh  wh  when this   (.) law came out, LAUTRO and all that business came out   (.) that, and best advice and all this sort of thing   (.) you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing. What they've got insurance already   (.) erm so on and so forth. And arrange around those circumstances the best advice   (.) package. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	But he didn't ask me the questions.  He just   (.) he just   (.) he just   
*ANN:	 No he just could do an endowment one and that was it. 
*STU:	he just assumed it was gonna be 
*ANN:	An an endowment policy, and endowment mortgage and that was it. He didn't tell you anything else. 
*STU:	No.  (.) Well you see when he said your base  is gonna be   
*ANN:	 I know. 
*STU:	a hundred and  two hundred   
*ANN:	 Ninety six. 
*STU:	and fifteen pounds or  whatever   
*ANN:	 Two hundred and five  and then  that   (.) on a ninety six   
*STU:	 And then a percent  I could get you a percent off as a first time buyer. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six   (.) for the first year. Then it goes back up to the base rate. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	Not, I know all that's that's  obvious. 
*ANN:	 That's quite clear.  Mm. 
*STU:	But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a   (.) pension mortgage   (.) I thought  well if a hundred and ninety   
*ANN:	 That's only five pound  a month to earn your pension. ((laugh))   
*STU:	 if a hu   if a hundred and ninety six is only your base  how come you don't   
*ANN:	 That gives you  five pound a month towards your pension  which is nothing is it? 
*STU:	 how do you get two  how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with, because of the term assurance on top. That's fourteen pounds a month term assurance.  (.) Quite high I think. 
*ANN:	 ((sigh)) What's term assurance? Don't understand that. 
*STU:	Term assurance is   (.) life insurance   (.) just on life only.  With no cash sum at the end. 
*ANN:	 Well if you died   (.) you'd be dead.  Well that's fair enough isn't it?  You wouldn't want anything else. 
*STU:	 But er throughout  throughout the term of my life  (.)  
*ANN:	And if you died  the   (  ) would be paid. 
*STU:	 If I died  a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable. 
*ANN:	That's it, you'd pay    (  )   
*STU:	 But I think  fourteen pounds a month is quite high.  (.) Term assurance. I'm tempted, I'm I'm I'm tempted to have a word with Mick. (.)  (  )  (.)  
*ANN:	What and arrange your own? 
*STU:	Well 
*ANN:	Or he'd just tell you? 
*STU:	well I, whether I, I don't know whether he would or whether he wouldn't. I mean he might   (.) he might not but   (.) then again he might. He might if I, if I talk to him he might tell me what sort of   (.) I don't want to hassle him  you see cos I've hassled   
*ANN:	 No, that's it. 
*STU:	him before  (  ) . Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort of thing and I don't wanna   (.) I'd like to know. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	I'd like to know   (.) before  you know   
*ANN:	 You've got to  get the right deal. 
*STU:	Yeah. I, I did   (.) two hundred and one pound a month or two hundred and fift  okay it sounds cheap but   (.) I don't know fourteen pound a month just for li  thirty thousand pound life cover over   (.)  suppose it's the   
*ANN:	 Yeah  but that's not that much a we   
*STU:	I suppose it's the term  of years. 
*ANN:	 It's only  three quid a m  a week. 
*STU:	Yeah but I suppose it's the term of years as well. You sort of to sixty five rather than at sixty. 
*ANN:	 Well that's it. 
*STU:	So that probably makes it but I say without having me own book   (.) to check it I can't 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	I can't tell you. You see you can, you get a lot, you can get tax relief off that  or you used to be able to get tax relief. 
*ANN:	 Well he said you could get tax relief  on the whole lot. 
*STU:	On the whole lot, yeah. 
*ANN:	That's what he said. At twenty five percent. 
*STU:	At twenty five percent. I think you still, I'm not sure whether they've changed the law round or not cos they 
*ANN:	Well that's what he said didn't he? 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Er you'd be handy for a a tax relief on the whole lot rather than just 
*STU:	Yeah. (.)  
*ANN:	part of it. 
*STU:	Cos that   (  ) you see if you, if you, if you could link up   (.) life assurance to your pension   (.) you could get tax relief on your life assurance you see? 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	Which makes it advantageous   (.) because there's no tax relief on life policies now as there was 
*STU:	There used to be, yeah. 
*ANN:	There used to be but  there is no   
*ANN:	 But they stopped it. 
*STU:	there is, they stopped it. There isn't any more. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	No, I'm sort of I think he confused himself as well as confusing me slightly    (  )   
*ANN:	 Yeah be   because you   (.) you confused him. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Because you knew. 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	Rather than somebody as I say like me who sat down there and he'd just quote all these figures and you wouldn't know what the hell he was on about and just, all you, all I would understand at the end is   (.) that's what you gotta pay. 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) Which is what most people that go in there 
*STU:	Are interested in. 
*ANN:	Well they wouldn't understand all the rest. This plan, that plan, the other plan. They only know well   (.) you either have this option paying this amount, that option paying that amount or that option paying that amount and which one do you want to have. 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	And and you don't understand any of the rest of it. 
*STU:	No. No. 
*ANN:	You just sit there mm yeah mm no mm   (.) well that's the cheapest, that's the dearest and   (.) and take their   ((laughing)) advice which ones the best for you and have it . And that's er that's all normal   (.) people who don't understand any of it   (.) that's the way they'd go about it isn't it? 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	You'd just accept whatever was  (.)  
*STU:	See the other thing, I don't know   (.) well no I'm not sure you can now.  (.) See if I took a pension   (.) mortgage out it would be linked to me   (.) lumped into me current   (.) pension contract. Cos I've already got a pension   (.) scheme running.  (.) Cos I've contracted out of SERPS.  (.) And also got   (.) erm   (.) erm what used to be called   (  ) seventy seven. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) Yes Stuart. 
*STU:	Erm   (.) a frozen pension with the Pru 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	linked in with it   (.) at the moment. That's that's that's my pension arrangements at the moment. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	Mm so   (.) I'm tempted   (.) er if I'm gonna do  a pension   (  )   
*ANN:	 I tell you  what you wa  who you wanna go and see. Who I saw when I bought the house   (.) at er thing. Now he was, I know he blinded me with science but he wa  , he was really very good and he had his computer there and he went through all these different societies and plans. 
*STU:	Well that's what he's done.  You see that's what he's done. 
*ANN:	 No but he had I mean he had a screen  and er 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	and that was   (.) that's along near Maxie's near the post office but it's a  (.)  
*STU:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Yeah, I saw him. 
*STU:	Oh the erm the Scots chap?  Er what's his name? 
*ANN:	 Oh and he was smashing.  And he explained it all to me. 
*STU:	Oh   (.) I can't think of his name now. I I I have had dealings with him. 
*ANN:	He he explained it all. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	And although there was all these figures and er   (.) and he explained   (.) what was best, I mean he was purely a financial   (.) I mean he he   (.) as he said when we went in cos   (.) it doesn't make no difference, I I I'm not   (.) attached to anything.  I'm here to   
*STU:	 No. But nor's he. 
*ANN:	I am here to give you advice. 
*STU:	That's it. 
*ANN:	And that's it. 
*STU:	Independent financial advice. 
*ANN:	And   (.) and therefore I'm not here to sell you this or that. I'm here purely to find out, you want to buy this council house   (.) and and and I'm here purely to find out your circumstances and and what would be the best deal for you. 
*STU:	That's right. 
*ANN:	And he went, I mean I was there   (.) for blooming ages. And he went through everything   (.) till he found out   (.) and it wa  I didn't have the abs  the absolute cheapest one. Cos he didn't think that was a   (.) because Steven was disabled and that as well and on my money and one thing and another 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	and   (.) and one thing and another but er   (.) it   (.) I mean mi  mine ended up with the Bradford and Bingley, I mean 
*STU:	Yeah well they're agents for Bradley, Bradford and Bingley  (  )  
*ANN:	Yeah I know but he did say that even though agents I'm not giving you this and then he showed me all the things you know to sort of prove that he was doing it. But that's wh  oh yeah that's who I had. 
*STU:	Yeah. It doesn't matter what building society  you go to. 
*ANN:	 No well that's what  he said, it doesn't but I mean   (.) he went through all these and insurance companies and because of my   (.) kidney being removed   (.) I had to pay, I had to pay higher even though I didn't have to have a bloody medical but I had to pay high because of my  (.)  
*STU:	Yeah.  Medical condition. 
*ANN:	 because I'd had medical  Yeah it was cos I'd had all these operations. You know you had to put how many operations have you had in the last ten years and   (.) have are you er receiving any treatment and all that bloody blah blah blah. 
*STU:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	And so mine, mine was higher 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	than er than other peoples which  is why he went to all these bloody quotes. 
*STU:	 See the thing   (.) yeah.  As I say the thing, the thing is as I say  it's you you your mor    
*ANN:	 He sorted it all out. But he was really good. 
*STU:	Yeah. Your mortgage, it doesn't matter who your mortgage is with, basically. I mean you can go to most places and 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	you're gonna be paying 
*ANN:	But when you buy a council house it is slightly different in as much as some   (.) some of them won't have them. 
*STU:	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 
*ANN:	Then also, he also gave me   (.) I mean I got hundred percent mortgage which you are allowed on, I mean the law says er   (.) t   (.) the chance to buy so therefore you don't have to have a deposit. But he also gave me enough to cover all my fees, legal fees. 
*STU:	Yeah. Yeah. 
*ANN:	So I borrowed over what the house was worth. But that was only because   (.) I'd lived in it for a long time and I got a discount  so the house was really   
*STU:	 Discount.  Yeah. 
*ANN:	worth more 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	than what I was paying for it. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Cos I got a discount so er I borrowed another thousand pound 
*STU:	To cover your costs. 
*ANN:	to cover all the costs for the survey for Maxie's and   (.) and this that and the other. Which I think come to about eight nine hundred pound. 
*STU:	Mm. As I say it doesn't matter what  building   
*ANN:	 Anyway he borrowed  all that for me. 
*STU:	it doesn't matter what building society you go to, you're gonna be paying basically the same rate. Because they're all the same rate. The base rate's the same. You, okay one place you can get a percent discount   (.) you might get a percent and a half discount depending on your 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	depending on the building society at the time. It's the life policy 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	that makes the difference. 
*ANN:	But to go to somebody like him   (.) who knew his job 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	which was his job and and had everything there and he, he patched through to this computer this place and   (.) different computers that he had. 
*STU:	Yeah. Yeah. 
*ANN:	And the facility to to get through to. 
*STU:	Mm. Mm. 
*ANN:	That he could get all these to find out what he thought was the best policy in in your 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	as I say because of my health and one thing and another you couldn't just   (.) and he, and he was really good he was and explained everything to me I say that 
*STU:	Can't think of his name now but I know the chap.  He was a tall chap with glasses. (  )   
*ANN:	 Mm. Yeah. Yeah.  Ever so nice. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	He really you know made me feel   (.) I say I weren't sat there like I was with that fella thinking   (.) well he don't seem to know what he's saying anyway. ((laugh))  
*STU:	No no. 
*ANN:	Which is what the impression I got about him, he wasn't really sure himself. 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	But I think that was partly you floored him because you knew. 
*STU:	Yeah. Yeah. 
*ANN:	He sort of was a bit you got him a bit couldn't say. But certainly that man that I went to that time he was very very nice and 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	then you could see he'd patch into all these different bloody things and 
*STU:	Mm mm. 
*ANN:	and and and I ended up with   (.) er a reasonable  (.)  
*STU:	Was yours an endowment? Or just 
*ANN:	It was an endowment. Yeah it had to be.  (  ) I dunno why but   (.) it had to be. (  )  
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	Well I don't know  but that's what   
*STU:	 When does your mortgage  finish then? 
*ANN:	My mortgage? I had it in   (.) eighty one, twenty years so   (.) another ten years. 
*STU:	So in fact there's still an endowment policy on you to cover that mortgage? 
*ANN:	No they were all cancelled weren't it? 
*STU:	I dunno    (  )   
*ANN:	 Oh yeah  I signed the form. (.)  
*STU:	So your endowment   (.) policy 
*ANN:	Everything's all 
*STU:	Ended. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	Cancelled. 
*ANN:	Cancelled. Stopped. 
*STU:	Well what about the money? 
*ANN:	The money was all  (  ) . I don't know. I just signed forms to say that I was   (.) no longer responsible or had any claim on the property or whatever. And that was it. I didn't have to pay any more and I didn't, and I was passing it over to   (.) to Steve.  I don't know what happened. 
*STU:	 Yeah but what about the   (  )  The life policy was in your name. 
*ANN:	The whole lot was in   (.) was it endowment? No I dunno, it can't have been can it? I don't know. No it wasn't it was a   (.) no it wasn't an endowment. I didn't pay. I only paid extra insurance. 
*STU:	Oh just a straight  term p  policy like I was   
*ANN:	 Yeah because   (.) yeah because, because of my health. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Yeah. That was it. Yeah it was     (  )  (.) Yeah. Because of my health. 
*STU:	 It was a term assurance rather than it being an endowment insurance.  Yeah. 
*ANN:	I couldn't, I don't think he could get the other   (.) he got that one because of,i  in my health you couldn't   (.) they couldn't say how long 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	because of my kidney. The other kidney could go all blah blah blah and this that and the other. Yeah. It was just ordinary insurance.  (.) I don't know how much it was.  (.) I don't know. I mean I only paid a hundred and sixty pound a month but I mean  (  )  
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	Then I only borrowed twenty odd thousand cos I got a   (.) forty odd percent discount off the price of the house anyway. 
*STU:	Mm. (.)  
*ANN:	Twenty two I think it was, something like that. 
*STU:	Mm.  (.)  You see   (  )   
*ANN:	 And the rent  was thirty six pound   (.) a week. And it ended up I was buying it for less money than what I was paying monthly for rent. 
*STU:	Yeah. Well you would do. 
*ANN:	So it was all 
*STU:	It was worth it. 
*ANN:	Might as well have done it. 
*STU:	Mm. Mm. 
*ANN:	So I went into it. 
*STU:	Mm. Mm. 
*ANN:	Yeah it   (.) it worked out hundred and sixty one pound a month, with the insurance. So it's alright I mean I paid the whole bloody lot to them, I didn't 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	sort it all out. You don't pay it separate, I didn't. I paid to council offices. 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	And they sorted, they   (.) forward it I suppose or did whatever they had to do with it. 
*STU:	Mm mm. 
*ANN:	Used to pay at the council offices.  (  ) different book.  (.)  (  ) used to go and pay it. Write the cheque out and he'd just take it in. 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	I could have had it done through the bank but he was always up town anyway so 
*STU:	Mm. So it didn't make any difference. 
*ANN:	didn't make any difference one way or the other. 
*STU:	Mm. Mm. 
*STU:	So how about you? You'd have it done through the bank anyway and I'd just pay you   (.) weekly I cou  might as well rather than monthly  ((laugh)) . 
*STU:	Mm. 
*ANN:	Save you going to the bank.  (.) Couldn't I? Just give you the money you   (  ) spends. 
*STU:	We'll see when we come, when it comes down to it won't we? What we could do financially. And sort something out then. 
*ANN:	Well of course we will.   (  ) expect you to pay   
*STU:	 But I cert  I I I I  I ju  I it it just sounds   (.) you know two hundred pounds a month, just over two hundred pound a month    (  )   
*ANN:	 Sounds  smashing dunnit? 
*STU:	Sounds wonderful. 
*ANN:	That's what I said, why doesn't everybody have them? (.)  ((laugh))  
*STU:	Well that's why I can't believe it. 
*ANN:	Well he said go back and   (.) tomorrow at least and  (.)  
*STU:	And check his figures. 
*ANN:	Mhm. If that's right that's the one you want really  isn't it? 
*STU:	 Well I I I  yeah. I mean obviously I'd have to pay more   (.) er for if I want it to   (.) end at sixty. 
*ANN:	Mm. But even then  it won't be   (.) will it be that much? 
*STU:	 To get   (  ) to get a higher lump sum.  To get a higher lump sum.  But then you see   
*ANN:	 Would it be  that much more? 
*STU:	Shouldn't think so. 
*ANN:	Well exactly.  So it's gonna   
*STU:	 You see it's   
*ANN:	be less than a   (.) want two hundred and eighty. 
*STU:	Oh yeah. 
*ANN:	 (  ) I said so you might as well have that and have a lump sum and a blooming house and 
*STU:	And a pension. 
*ANN:	And a pension. That's what I mean. Might as well have your pension.  (  ) when you get to sixty. 
*STU:	Mm.  (.) Say it's only twenty six years and   (.) course with a pension see you can increase your contributions. 
*ANN:	Yeah. If if you get a better job and what have you  you can always   
*STU:	 Better job or  whatever or   (.) pay rise or whatever you  can increase   
*ANN:	 Yeah you   
*STU:	your contributions into your pension plan 
*ANN:	Exactly, yes. 
*STU:	and still, and finish your mortgage earlier. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	Fifty five. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	Or fifty. Depending on how much you wanna pay. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	If you wanna pay more into it.  (.) But I still think  (  )  
*ANN:	Well see what he comes up with. 
*STU:	See what he comes up with, yeah.  See what he comes up with. 
*ANN:	 And certainly    (.) say   (.) two hundred and twenty five pound a month it's still worth having. 
*STU:	It's cheaper than we're paying now isn't it? 
*ANN:	Mm. Even if it's two hundred and fifty it   (.)  the same   
*STU:	 Well you'd still   
*ANN:	you're gonna have a pension and and a home. 
*STU:	In a way I'd rather pay the same   (.) and finish the mortgage earlier. 
*ANN:	Yeah well that's it. You could volunteer to pay two hundred and fifty a month couldn't you? 
*STU:	And pay a higher pension   (.) policy. 
*ANN:	Mhm.  That's what I mean. 
*STU:	 And then  and then you've got the option   (.) then you've got the further option that if you want to reduce your premiums on your pension   (.) you can do. 
*ANN:	If anything happened. Mm. 
*STU:	If anything   (.) if   (.) if it does   (.) You see again and then you see if you're out of a job you see you   (.) if you happen to be out of a job then you're not eligible for a pension policy. 
*ANN:	What happens then then? If you get made redundant? 
*STU:	Well. 
*ANN:	And you've already got it. 
*STU:	Well, then you have to freeze it. See that's that's the oth  that's another drawback with the pension. Whereas an endowment policy it doesn't matter. You you can carry on paying an endowment policy.  (.) So it, you know   (.) there's pros and cons either way. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	There's there's er pros and cons in buying either of tho  either of the flats.  (.) You see er that's the thing isn't it? 
*ANN:	Mhm.  (.) But you've got to make the decision cos I like both of them very much. 
*STU:	I do. 
*ANN:	So therefore you have to make the decision which one, if it comes down to it, would you like to live in.  (.) I mean if we could get that one down at   (.) New Drove what is it, twenty nine?  (.) So that's gonna be, say if you get   (.) fifteen hundred off it   (.) it's gonna be twenty eight. 
*STU:	Call it, it's thirty thousand isn't it? 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	What is it, twenty nine nine nine five. You might as well call it thirty thousand    (  )   
*ANN:	 Well say you get  twenty eight and a half.  (.) You're gonna get it cheaper   (.) the mor  the monthly payment is cheaper.  (.) And then aff  and then you could afford to buy some blooming carpets. And with the other one you've got to find a deposit which you'd have to pay back. (.)  
*STU:	But you wouldn't have to buy any carpets. 
*ANN:	You wouldn't have to buy the carpets. (.)  
*STU:	And   (.) you say we'd   (.) gonna have to have a cooker and a fridge and that aren't you? 
*ANN:	Well a cooker you definitely, a fridge   (.) say we could perhaps borrow that one of mum's until we could afford one.  Or pick up a cheap one. 
*STU:	 Unless    (.) I say if you knocked him down. 
*ANN:	But a cooker's no problem because I know you can go into the Electricity Board and say   (.) I'm moving into a new property, I haven't got a cooker   (.) and they would, you can get them. No deposit, just added to your electric bill. That's a way to   (.) because 
*STU:	Oh buying it on some sort of 
*ANN:	Oh yeah on er er a financial agreement. 
*STU:	Or   (.) look around and see what there is going in the, in the market.  And get a sort of   
*ANN:	 Second hand one. 
*STU:	no percent   (.) free credit. 
*ANN:	Yeah.  (.) I mean there's no difficulty in getting a cooker. 
*STU:	Say if we   (.) I mean if, if we're paying say   (.) two hundred pound a month   (.) on a mortgage 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	for twenty eight thousand  (  ) . We've got fifty pound a month we can play with and we, to buy   
*ANN:	 Well that's it. You could   
*STU:	to buy a cooker over the ne
