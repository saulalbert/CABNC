*JAN:	Mm mm. •135624_135695•
*CHR:	No. •135867_135873•
*JAN:	Cos she's very generous. •135873_136077•
*CHR:	Very. •136081_136107•
*JAN:	She spends more on you on your birthdays than your grandparents do. •136221_136899•
        So think about that. •137074_137326•
        Doesn't she? •137343_137380•
        Indeed she does. •137406_137459•

        We either stay home or we  stay home or we're going away. •144232_144555•
        If we go away I think it's too early in the year to use the caravan, therefore it means staying at  •144555_144974•
*CHR:	Tent. •144974_144984•
*JAN:	somebody's. •144984_145031•

*PHI:	Mm mm! •145101_145121•
*JAN:	Or there's the tent. •145137_145279•
*PHI:	Is that what you want Chris? •145279_145382•
*JAN:	You can, oh you can have, the tent up on the back lawn if you, if you're so bothered about camping. •145382_145765•
        I don't think I want to go in tent this time of year. •145765_145936•
*PHI:	Ring up Ted and Linda and see while they're going over to your mother's we'll go over to Aberystwyth. •145936_146298•
*JAN:	Yes. •146298_146357•
        Well they have  •146357_146408•
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	got •146408_146417•
*PHI:	We'll borrow their house. •146417_146590•
*JAN:	I used to like, camping's okay Christopher, but it's difficult when you've got children. •146601_146987•
*CHR:	Oh. •147009_147045•
*JAN:	And when the nights  are that much darker early. •147218_147540•
        When it was just your Dad and I we, we could go out all evening and then, then come back to the tent, but when we've got you two we have to be back in the , we can't go out in the evenings. •147540_148871•
*PHI:	Where's the wine? •148871_148946•
*JAN:	On top of the microwave. •149460_149509•
*PHI:	That's where you might expect to find cold wine. •149563_149885•
        More? •149885_149901•
*JAN:	Mm mm. •149901_149918•
        Oh only a bit cos I    I've gotta cut David's hair tonight . •149930_150200•
        I'll cut your ears off. •150200_150650•
*PHI:	Squiggly hair. •150688_150757•
        Mouth closed please Dave. •150757_150917•
*JAN:	So, if we went away it's, it's really only Aberystwyth or  or  isn't it? •150917_151827•
*PHI:	Mm mm. •151827_151936•
*DAV:	I, I'd prefer . •151936_151988•
*JAN:	Well  cos I think Phil and Lesley are going to grandma's  for Easter  and  they live in , and therefore it it depends what Aunty Dulcy's doing. •151988_152978•
        I mean, we could ring her up and ask her. •153020_153210•
        Or shall we just stay at home and go out for days and •153210_153461•
*DAV:	Go to my parties. •153551_153631•
*JAN:	Yes, you'd miss the parties if we went away. •153631_153782•
        But I need to know cos I'll do a turkey  if we're staying home. •153818_154157•
*CHR:	Why? •154157_154167•
*JAN:	Well •154414_154442•
*PHI:	Well there's York model railway exhibition that weekend but we could still see that and go away. •154469_154966•
*JAN:	I've got a Christmas pudding as well, left over from Christmas. •155007_155472•
*PHI:	Mind you, if it costs three pounds a head to get in you'll probably not want to go. •155511_155819•
*JAN:	I'll sit outside. •155847_155903•
*PHI:	Ha! •155928_155975•
*CHR:	Children free probably. •156149_156246•
*PHI:	One pound  •156359_156411•
*JAN:	What about  •156411_156459•
*PHI:	fifty. •156468_156507•

*JAN:	I  •156898_156908•
*PHI:	know. •156914_156923•
*JAN:	I would have thought so. •156923_157026•
        I mean, they usually do these things, if you flash your student card. •157026_157261•
*PHI:	Pensioners and children, one pound fifty. •157435_157589•
*JAN:	Here you are. •157589_157617•
        They do students as well. •157617_157688•
*CHR:	Unless they  at school. •157713_158131•
*JAN:	I keep forgetting to, well you can , forgetting to use my student card. •158163_158579•
*CHR:	I'm not student. •158579_158690•
*JAN:	Well you are really aren't you? •158856_158975•
        But, when they mean student they mean people who are over eighteen or nineteen. •158975_159315•
