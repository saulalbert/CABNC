@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 040702)
*FRA:	A lot of cars at the school this morning.  (.) I parked right on the end of the erm   (.) the lane, just   
*LYN:	 Mm   
*FRA:	in, there was just enough room for me. 
*LYN:	Mm? 
*FRA:	Course we were late anyway   (.) well not late for John's but  (.)  
*LYN:	 (  )  (.)  Which way do you go   
*FRA:	 When I came back   
*LYN:	into  (  ) ?  (.) Cos you can  cut through that   (  )   
*FRA:	 I turn round and  go back, yeah. 
*LYN:	Mm. 
*FRA:	And of course the coach had come up the hill   (.) couldn't overtake where I was parked, blocking off the entrance to the lane where I'd just come out of so that the string of cars coming down the road and the first one wanting to turn in and of course the coach had covered it. 
*LYN:	Oh yeah 
*FRA:	It was completely blocked off   (.) coach couldn't go backwards because there was cars behind it. 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*FRA:	So I gingerly walked down and crept into the car  realized that I was the one that had caused all that   
*LYN:	  ((laugh))  
*FRA:	 ((laughing)) and drove off     ((laugh))   
*LYN:	  ((laughing)) And ignored    (.)  
*FRA:	Slinked off into the mist. (.)  
*LYN:	So he couldn't back back then  (  )  
*FRA:	No   (.) no that wa  that was it, completely stalemate. 
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	 (  ) big Volvo estate was facing   (  ) if he'd go down there, I can get through and he can come back again and   (  ) he wasn't gonna do that.  (.) Too much    (  ) brain damage   (  )   
*LYN:	  (  )  there's a big notice at the end of the lane which says  (  )  
*FRA:	Well he'd come up from Totnes this morning. 
*LYN:	Oh, yeah. What they usually do is they go up and then back down by the church 
*FRA:	Yeah. 
*LYN:	and turn and go back again. (.)  (  )  (.)  (  )  
*FRA:	Mm? 
*LYN:	 (  )  (.) 
*FRA:	It is eight o'clock though    ((laugh))   
*LYN:	 Mm     (  )  (.) Perhaps I'll do some gardening. (  )   
*FRA:	 Did you do away with your   (  )  or   (  ) just put a plank over the top? 
*LYN:	I put   (  ) back so   (  ) and then I put   (  ) against the fence. (.)  
*FRA:	Oh Alex   came in today. 
*LYN:	Ooh    (  )   ((laugh))   
*FRA:	  (  )   (  ) 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*FRA:	Yeah 
*LYN:	 (  )  (.) 
*FRA:	Well   (  ) he's got   (.) he's got plenty of money, right? And er the car arrives   (.) I looked   (  ) all I could see was mother sitting in the car and puffing this   (.) smoke puffing out through the window 
*LYN:	Mm. 
*FRA:	and erm   (.) in came   (  ) he'd had a   (.) a little tiny switch out of his black and white telly 
*LYN:	Oh yeah 
*FRA:	and he said it's a   (  ) and the switch won't work. I said how long have you had this set? He said ooh about six years, I said yeah and the rest. 
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	I said where did you get it from? He said well   (.) I used to work at   (  ) I got it from  (  ) . 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*FRA:	I said how long is it since you retired from  (  ) ?  (.) Said ooh it'll be erm eighteen years this year. 
*LYN:	Yeah. 
*FRA:	I said you've bought this since you left  (  ) ? Well I was trying to find how old it  was. 
*LYN:	 Mm   
*FRA:	So he said oh no since I left. I said well I, I'd still reckon it's about ten years old now. Oh no it's only six years old.  (.)  (  ) fix the switch on I said you'll never get a new one anyway.  (.) And   (.) oh they were talking about Rod they was   (.) they were saying that, you know, about Rod getting married  (  )  
*LYN:	Yeah? 
*FRA:	Well I said well how old is Rod?  (.) I dunno he said er Steve how old's Rod? 
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	I said well come on you're his dad, you should know how old he is. So he went out to the car and asked mother   (.) how old is Rod? She says I don't know     (.)  ((laugh))  (  ) don't remember having him   ((laugh)) mind you I remember having him but I don't know   (.) I can't remember when it was.  (.) He's thirty something. (.)  
*LYN:	Hard to put an age on him. (.)  
*FRA:	 (  ) Ray was thirty eight  (  )  
*LYN:	Is he as much as that?  (.) Mm. (.)  
*FRA:	Well it must be ten years ago when he worked for the B B C and that, he must have been in his late twenties then 
*LYN:	Mm. (.)  
*FRA:	so   (.) anyway he's   (  ) he's engaged and   (.) it's taken him two years to get engaged   (.) so it's gonna take another couple of years to get married. 
*LYN:	Yeah. (.)  
*FRA:	He's still got the M G and it's got three twen  twenty three thousand on it now.  It's   
*LYN:	 Mm   
*FRA:	S reg, got it from new of course, (  ) . And some chap came down from the M G B Owners' Club and said he'd offer him six thousand for it. 
*LYN:	Mm 
*FRA:	But he said he thought that was   (  ) price cos he said it's worth at least ten    (.)  (  ) the mileage originally, you know? 
*LYN:	Mm. 
*FRA:	 (  ) it's absolutely like new. 
*LYN:	 (  ) ? 
*FRA:	Mm? 
*LYN:	Where did he get it? 
*FRA:	He bought it from brand new somewhere, (  )  
*LYN:	 (  )  (.) 
*FRA:	In Devon, yeah. 
*LYN:	Mm. (.)  
*FRA:	He's got a Metro at the moment they're driving around in, she drives, she passed her test at sixty eight.  (.) So   (.) he's seventy eight now   (  ) she's probably about the same I think. 
*LYN:	Mm. (.)  
*FRA:	But they had a Mini before the Metro and er   (.) the day they bought the Mini they saw an advert in the paper saying that if you buy a Mini in the next few days 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*FRA:	give you a free colour portable with it. 
*LYN:	Oh. 
*FRA:	Of course they didn't get the portable with this, they rang them up, said where's my colour portable     (.)  (  )  (.) said I'll put you on to the manager   (.) anyway   (  ) they had some deal that night that erm to launch this Mini Mayfair or whatever it was   (.) wine and cheese thing   (.) so he went to the wine and cheese thing   (.) and   (  ) worried he was gonna kick up a fuss   ((laughing)) so they gave him  a telly anyway . 
*LYN:	  (  ) yeah. (.)  
*FRA:	He's a penny pinching old bugger he is, god! (.)  
*LYN:	I can't quite imagine  (  )  
*FRA:	No.  (10.0)  (  ) coming back in a minute. 
*LYN:	Yeah    (  )  (.) What about  (  ) ? (.)  
*FRA:	 (  ) The dust wagon came up to the warehouse today, the usual    (  )  (.) they'd got halfway to emptying the first dustbin in the back 
*LYN:	Oh yeah. 
*FRA:	and the hydraulic hose on the back of the dustcart broke   (.) there was hydraulic fluid all over the 
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	all over the car park. So the driver said can I use your phone? He came in   (.) and trampling this brake fluid all over the carpet.  (.) He got through to the   (.) base camp to find out when the   (.) chap was coming to fix it.  (.) Five minutes later he came in trying to tell   (.) tell us jokes and each time he'd been paddling through this brake fluid and the carpet is just   (.) you know, brains 
*LYN:	Mm. 
*FRA:	Hand picked for the job I should think. 
*LYN:	 (  ) 
*FRA:	Well we didn't notice the footprints until he'd left. (.)  
*LYN:	 (  )
