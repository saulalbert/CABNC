*ANN:	Are you going to get  •296313_298133•
*JAC:	 (        )

*JAC:	Ah no, this is, I'm just getting us a new pan. •301143_302773•
        Say, a big one, over the road they normally have it. •303113_305483•
*ANN:	Oh! •305483_305523•
*JAC:	Erm •305523_305583•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	You know my bathroom tiles are coming on  Tuesday. •305713_308923•
*ANN:	Mhm. •308923_309093•
        Right. •309273_309373•
*JAC:	I mean the bathroom's not yet done, it's still not a  of paper one side. •309373_313643•
*ANN:	Oh. •313793_313823•
        Well then, while  •313923_314393•
*JAC:	Once you got  •314393_314723•
*ANN:	you can you've gotta  •314723_315423•
*JAC:	got  •315423_315583•
*ANN:	sell out. •315583_315743•
*JAC:	Yeah. •316323_316663•
*ANN:	Yeah. •316663_316723•
*JAC:	I was up the street and  got the building society here. •316723_319123•
*ANN:	We want some erm  er, what they call them? •319593_322683•
        Quarry tiles •322683_323543•
*JAC:	Aha. •323763_323863•
*ANN:	you know to step down into the kitchen. •323863_325423•
*JAC:	Yeah. •325723_326053•
*ANN:	I would like some quarry tiles on there, but we can't get any of the narrow ones, they've got a curved edge. •326933_331823•
*JAC:	Mind, I'll have to go buy one cos I've seen them in Newcastle. •331823_335563•
        In Wroxons I get my plants  and they've got them cheaper  than . •335563_340443•
*ANN:	Well they told, they, they told us that we couldn't get they couldn't get us any •341393_344673•
*JAC:	No. •345123_345363•
*ANN:	with a curved edge. •345493_346613•
        And I don't want the little ones  tripping up and crashing their heads on a •346833_349903•
*JAC:	Oh I see. •350033_350583•
        Mm. •350583_350733•
*ANN:	And, and  in the corner where the door is there's a hole in the step underneath the  the door hinge. •350733_356363•
*JAC:	Oh! •356363_356583•
*ANN:	And er  James, triplet  he's er  pushing bits of paper and  I should imagine there's pens and crayons and all kinds down there. •356583_367023•
*JAC:	The only thing you could do is get the, you know that kind of plastic edging you can get for  wall tiles •367313_371363•
*ANN:	Yeah. •371363_371453•
*JAC:	with curved  put a bit of that in. •371453_373963•
        That  •374033_374213•
*ANN:	Yeah. •375153_375353•
*JAC:	would take the raw, the raw edge off. •375403_376623•
*ANN:	Aha. •376653_376783•
*JAC:	It will curve it down. •376823_377773•
*ANN:	You can get them in the square ones, the six by six, but I I wanted  the way we worked it out, eight by four would work out more economical. •377773_384883•
*JAC:	Aha. •385913_386093•
*ANN:	Cos eventually, I wouldn't mind the kitchen having quarry quarry tiles. •386963_389953•
*JAC:	No I don't like them. •390083_390933•
*ANN:	I like quarry tiles. •393143_394583•
        Right. •394613_394793•
*JAC:	See ya! •394793_394943•

*ANN:	I don't know, it's been, I went  along to ask Betty and Paul if they knew . •397043_400853•
        It's been there since  before half past one I think. •401663_405823•
        I was putting the washing on at the back and I saw the the bit sticking past the house. •405823_409953•
*JAC:	It's that fella  the  probably going to a wedding. •410193_413073•
*ANN:	I think it must be a, I think it must  •413183_415073•
*JAC:	He's got it  •415073_415853•
*ANN:	be a driver. •415853_416513•
        He can't, he can't be actually at a wedding because •416673_419943•
