*JAC:	Aha.Thought it was 
*ANN:	thought 
*JAC:	me.
*ANN:	I thought she'd just er   (.) you know, she was worried about her children cos   (.) as usual they'd left the keys behind, they were the house.
*JAC:	Ah.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh well, if you don't know.
*JAC:	There again, it's gonna be, it's something like, that   (        ) said it was forty four days and suddenly I thought, bugger that!I'm going  (        ) .
*ANN:	Forty four days?
*JAC:	Aye.
*ANN:	Oh.Oh well.
*JAC:	And I thought bloody hell  (        ) .Don't be daft.

*ANN:	to pay your debts with a   [laughing] pan 
*JAC:	No I've got 
*ANN:	in your hand  [] !
*JAC:	Ah no, this is, I'm just getting us a new pan.Say, a big one, over the road they normally have it.
*ANN:	Oh!
*JAC:	Erm
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	You know my bathroom tiles are coming on   (.) Tuesday.
*ANN:	Mhm.Right.
*JAC:	I mean the bathroom's not yet done, it's still not a   (        ) of paper one side.
*ANN:	Oh.Well then, while 
*JAC:	Once you got 
*ANN:	you can you've gotta 
*JAC:	got 
*ANN:	sell out.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I was up the street and   (        ) got the building society here. (        ) 
*ANN:	We want some erm   (.) er, what they call them?Quarry tiles
*JAC:	Aha.
*ANN:	you know to step down into the kitchen.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I would like some quarry tiles on there, but we can't get any of the narrow ones, they've got a curved edge.
*JAC:	Mind, I'll have to go buy one cos I've seen them in Newcastle.In Wroxons I get my plants   (.) and they've got them cheaper   (.) than  (        ) .
*ANN:	Well they told, they, they told us that we couldn't get i they couldn't get us any
*JAC:	No.
*ANN:	with a curved edge.And I don't want the little ones   (.) tripping up and crashing their heads on a
*JAC:	Oh I see.Mm.
*ANN:	And, and   (.) in the corner where the door is there's a hole in the step underneath the   (.) the door hinge.
*JAC:	Oh!
*ANN:	And er   (.) James, triplet   (.) he's pres er   (.) pushing bits of paper and   (.) I should imagine there's pens and crayons and all kinds down there.
*JAC:	The only thing you could do is get the, you know that kind of plastic edging you can get for   (.) wall tiles
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	with curved   (.) put a bit of that in.That 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	would take the raw, the raw edge off.
*ANN:	Aha.
*JAC:	It will curve it down.
*ANN:	You can get them in the square ones, the six by six, but I wa I wanted   (.) the way we worked it out, eight by four would work out more economical.
*JAC:	Aha.
*ANN:	Cos eventually, I wouldn't mind the kitchen having quarry qua quarry tiles.
*JAC:	No I don't like them.
*ANN:	I like quarry tiles. (.) Right.
