*ANN:	It's that   (        )  (.) 
*STU:	We go for a second hand suite as well or 
*ANN:	a microwave.
*STU:	Go for a microwave or do you just go for
*ANN:	We've got nine hundred pounds approximately, after the cooker and the fridge.Five hundred pound for carpets, leaves four hundred pound, two hundred pound for suite and the microwave  (.) 
*STU:	 ((laugh)) say, there's so many combinations that's the thing isn't it?
*ANN:	Yep.
*STU:	There are so many combinations of what to have, what to get, what we can't get, what we need really I think is, what we need is obviously going to be priority isn't it?
*ANN:	Yes.
*STU:	Carpets, cooker fridge
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	they're the definite needs and erm  (.) 
*ANN:	That was eleven hundred pounds
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	approximately, you've got four hundred pound really to play with, (        )  (.) approximately four hundred pound   (.) left over, say five hundred pound, six hundred for electrical goods.

*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Eleven, you've got four hundred pound, you got    (        )  (.) so it's a good second hand one or   (.) a cheapy   (.) no, well it would be a cheapy    (        )  (.) I told him most of them around about seven hundred and ninety nine  (        ) 
*STU:	Decent  (        ) 
*ANN:	A reasonable one, I mean you can go up to two thousand for a good one, but a reasonable one you wouldn't get nowadays under seven hundred and ninety nine   (        )  (.) 
*STU:	I think you'd be better off with a   (.) with a new cooker and fridge
*ANN:	Oh yeah, definitely I think  (.) 
*STU:	 (        ) , you can go second hand 
*ANN:	rather than go second, (        )
