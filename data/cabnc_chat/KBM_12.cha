*CHR:	Yeah, miles better, for the good of the country they're not good for you, women shouldn't have the vote you know   ((laugh)) women shouldn't get the vote, I think they should bring back, bring back just men having vote, women don't get a say as far as I'm concerned that's a good idea don't you think? ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	Oh we go to our place for, now women stage for  (        ) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) stage, that's my, that's my whole life   [laughing] it's my whole   [] I've had that erm, have my views, so why do you think I should vote Labour?
*LYN:	Er
*CHR:	Come on why?
*LYN:	because they'll put more into education and schools
*CHR:	Yeah and it'll take a 
*LYN:	and the health service
*CHR:	Yeah, but they haven't got enough money
*LYN:	Take it off the rich 
*CHR:	they haven't got enough money to do that.
*LYN:	well take it off the rich.
*CHR:	They have not, they have not got enough
*LYN:	Well they will do
*CHR:	they haven't, did you not read the article in the er Telegraph?They said, they said 
*LYN:	Yeah, I'm sorry I don't need   (        ) 
*CHR:	the actual, actually nine point four billion pounds behind 
*LYN:	Short 
*CHR:	short 
*LYN:	Mm 
*CHR:	yes because they, they fo forgot to take out the money which they could have, which erm, which would of come from privatization, which they had no intention of doing so they took that out.Are you not for privatization? (.) 
*LYN:	Er ye yes, if it gives a better service at the end of the day
*CHR:	So you think it's better?
*LYN:	Yeah
*CHR:	Well why don't Labour then?
*LYN:	I just said because of the health service and schools
*CHR:	Well the health service could be privatized
*LYN:	and they're more likely to give more money to us
*CHR:	and why shouldn't the health service be privatized?
*LYN:	Because some people need a lot more treatment than others and it's something you cannot, you cannot forecast 
*CHR:	I know but the actual, the actual peo the actual people that have to pay for us, such it could be more that erm, the government would actually pay for it and then hospitals would erm fight for the, for the actual er thing
*LYN:	Yes, but what if they don't?
*CHR:	What if they don't want?
*LYN:	If they just make it totally private where everybody has to pay
*CHR:	I don't know they'd never do that, they'd never do that 
*LYN:	those poor unfortunate people, I don't know would they not?
*CHR:	No
*LYN:	That's a right step in the right direction, no

*CHR:	Don't know
*LYN:	Won't make any difference to my life   (.) these are cold  (.) 
*CHR:	Why not, why didn't you vote Liberal Democrat?
*LYN:	Because I don't think they had a chance of getting in to vote  (        ) 
*CHR:	What getting into our seat?
*LYN:	No, well, and to the country as a whole
*CHR:	What does it matter about the country, the seat is what's important
*LYN:	Well yes
*CHR:	did you actually find out about the figures for the seat?
*LYN:	No I didn't
*CHR:	If you found out 
*LYN:	but they come second 
*CHR:	if you found out then you might have found out that they weren't very far behind, so they could of caught up and they could of gained a seat and they could of gained a say in the government
*LYN:	Mm, mm
*CHR:	so it's not wasted at all 
*LYN:	No
*CHR:	is it?
*LYN:	No
*CHR:	Pathetic, pathetic

*LYN:	Yeah, well compared to a lot more I've got a lot less  (.) 
*CHR:	Yeah, well you don't look at it like that
*LYN:	Yeah, well that's the way you look at it 
*CHR:	you, you 
*LYN:	you're always going on about what you want

*LYN:	I can't buy myself anything, I've still got to pay for them
*CHR:	But you'll be able to buy yourself something still
*LYN:	Mm, but there's nothing I want now
*CHR:	Mm, I'm sure you'll find something in Marks and Spencers, I have heard about a new trick mum, how to con money out of Marks and Spencers
*LYN:	Yeah?
*CHR:	right, you go upstairs, pick up the most expensive article they've got and then you go downstairs to the customer relations department and say I bought this article yesterday and say, and, and I'm afraid 
*LYN:	But you haven't got a receipt though 
*CHR:	I'm afraid it doesn't fit   (.) unfortunately I've lost the receipt but will you still change it?And they say yes we will, our business teach teacher told us about that you see because it's been happening a lot, cos Marks and Spencers don't ask for a receipt you see, it actually happened, they used to take things from upstairs, bring them downstairs and said they bought it and got the money for it. ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	That's terrible
*CHR:	Clever    ((laugh))  (.) still   (.) I can earn it
*LYN:	No you don't
*CHR:	Yeah I know but Marks and Spencers are a crap shop I don't care if they go out of business   (.) they're a rip off anyway, they're so expensive, such crap clothes, they're so common, that's the word I've been looking for common, that's my word of the week I think   [laughing] er common   [] common, ((laugh)) does it not get to ya looking like everyone else?
*LYN:	I don't look like everyone else.
*CHR:	If you, if you wear Marks and Spencers clothes you'd look like everyone else 
*LYN:	No I wouldn't first perhaps  (        ) 
*CHR:	you look like millions of other people
*LYN:	I would like more money for a few more things though
*CHR:	 (        ) you got five hundred quid bonus, why don't you spend that?
*LYN:	Because you, you've just been going on about going abroad
*CHR:	Er, ee
*LYN:	that's why
*CHR:	are we gonna go?
*LYN:	Oh Chris don't start that again, I don't know yet

*CHR:	So, does that annoy you then?
*LYN:	Oh I'm freezing cold
*CHR:	Can't you  (        ) 
*LYN:	Christopher I don't know and quite honestly I don't care at the moment 
*CHR:	You always bite me head off when I ask some sensitive questions 
*LYN:	I've got too many other things  (.) 
*CHR:	Why don't we go next week? (.) 
*LYN:	Too late now
*CHR:	No it's not
*LYN:	No
*CHR:	you've got a week
*LYN:	it won't be as warm as it is in the April  (.) 
*CHR:	Well perhaps if we will, we weren't to, if we went next week, we'd have two weeks earlier than last year won't we?Or three
*LYN:	Three I think
*CHR:	Three weeks, yeah we'll go somewhere like that Greece or    (        )  (.) you know if you ask me    (        )  (.) er I know loads of people in this  (        ) 
*LYN:	I know, where did they stay?
*CHR:	They went to Tenerife

*CHR:	Tenerife and Lanzarote are no good then?
