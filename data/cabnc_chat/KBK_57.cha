@Comment:	conversation #57 (Tape 002224)
*LYN:	Hiya. •430285_430445•
*CHR:	All well? •430445_430595•
*LYN:	Aha. •430595_430685•
*CHR:	We have a naked fence now. •430685_432265•
*LYN:	Yes, but he,. •433515_434775•
*CHR:	Well I think Bill's chopped all the ivy off it. •437075_439345•
*LYN:	the ivy as well? •441445_441825•
*CHR:	Is he doing something to the tree? •443925_444985•
        I noticed that  •445315_446065•
*LYN:	I thought the tree had been eh  •446065_447025•
*CHR:	Maybe it has the tree . •447025_447855•
        Hadn't specially noticed that. •447895_449455•
        Certainly into the ivy he was having a crack at. •449965_451835•
        the fence is in surprisingly good nick underneath it. •453405_455645•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes. •459945_460375•
*LYN:	Any happenings? •463505_464045•
        Mm. •464665_464895•
*CHR:	Midland Bank received our letter of credit yesterday, at twelve thirty, our documents was  twelfth of May, have not yet been checked. •465245_476575•
*LYN:	Right. •478965_479155•
*CHR:	That's right. •486455_487035•
        She said, we'll ring you about any discrepancies on Monday  didn't actually say we'll ring you about the discrepancies on Monday . •487295_493105•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	I didn't wish to disillusion her. •494385_495945•
*LYN:	Have one up, they're all slightly different these credits, so •496125_501755•
*CHR:	Mm. •501885_501945•
*LYN:	so, check about two  •502105_515005•
*CHR:	I seemed to have got a significantly better offer on this . •515005_521355•
        which is potentially exciting. •521705_523955•
*LYN:	 ((laugh))  (        ) 
*CHR:	No, from . •528095_529265•
*LYN:	Oh. •530670_530830•
*CHR:	They  •532980_533190•
*LYN:	Out of the blue? •533420_533820•
*CHR:	Well hardly out of the blue, they asked for it a week ago. •534490_537220•
*LYN:	I see. •537950_538160•
*CHR:	though that again is questionable. •538810_543460•
        The implication has been all along that they're using the same United States manufacturing source but in fact there are one or two discrepancies here, erm, because the value is so high, I'm actually sort of going through and looking at everything  pretty closely, and they've changed the basis so wow,. •547010_571600•
        Cos we're talking of the same product, one, one, quotes ninety six dollars and the other quotes a hundred and thirty seven dollars. •581480_586390•
*LYN:	That's a  different. •587830_589500•
*CHR:	That's quite enough to want to treble check isn't it? •589710_593920•
