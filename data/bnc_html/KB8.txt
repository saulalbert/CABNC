Richard (PS14H)                      [494] Rebecca, you're losing your socks.
Ann (PS14B)                          [495] If you trip up with two hands in
                                     your pockets Amy, you'll have nothing to
                                     stop you falling on your nose.
Amy (PS14E)                          [496] What?
Richard (PS14H)                      [497] Amy.

Rebecca (PS14D)                      [499] It'd be funny if she did fall on her
                                     nose.

Rebecca (PS14D)                      [502] Like Miss ... if you don't do hard
                                     work you'll get a flat face!
Amy (PS14E)                          [503] Yeah I know.

Rebecca (PS14D)                      [505] She won't have a flat face, she'll
                                     have a flat nose. [laugh]
Amy (PS14E)                          [506] I mean, not likely.
Ann (PS14B)                          [507] How do you get a flat face if you
                                     don't do hard work?
Rebecca (PS14D)                      [508] I don't know.

Amy (PS14E)                          [513] I wonder why she likes me?

Richard (PS14H)                      [516] Aha!
Amy (PS14E)                          [517] After school can we see the river
                                     again?
Richard (PS14H)                      [518] Urgh!

Amy (PS14E)                          [522] And see if the water has passed that
                                     line.
Ann (PS14B)                          [523] Pardon?
Amy (PS14E)                          [524] Can't wait to see if the water has

Ann (PS14B)                          [525] Oh it ... those huge puddles along

                                     away.
                                     [526] The weather man said dry today, look
                                     at it.
                                     [527] Doesn't look as if it's going to be
                                     dry to me.
Matthew (PS14F)                      [528] Look!

Amy (PS14E)                          [534] That's what I've just asked!

                                     [1062] So it's gonna be a conspiracy

                           [1731] ... Can I put this bag
Bryony (PS14N)             [moan]
Ann (PS14B)                [1732] do you think it'll just go on there?
Bryony (PS14N)             [1733] By me.
Ann (PS14B)                [1734] I'll just put it on there like that.
Bryony (PS14N)             [1735] No.
Ann (PS14B)                [1736] Cos it keeps slipping off my shoulder.
                           [1737] Oh!
                           [1738] I've still got my glasses on and I don't need
                           them.
James (PS14M)              [1739] I don't like that there.
Ann (PS14B)                [1740] I'll just put them in the bag cos I've locked
                           the door.
James (PS14M)              [1741] And move your bag.
                           [1742] Carry it on my shoulders.
Ann (PS14B)                [1743] Yes.
                           [1744] I know you carry it on your shoulder
                           sometimes.
                           [1745] It's a bit long for you.
                           [1746] Oh!
James (PS14M)              [1747] But

James (PS14M)              [1749] I want
Ann (PS14B)                [1750] I'll have to go back in the house because
                           I've got two odd gloves on.
                           [1751] I've got two left hand gloves here.
                           [1752] Ooh, I am a nitwit!
                           [1753] ... I don't know where I go er ... [sigh] ...
                           Right.
                           [1754] That's better.
                           [1755] I've got ... a pair of gloves now instead of
                           two odd ones.
James (PS14M)              [1756] Well put it on.
Ann (PS14B)                [1757] I'm going to put it o

James (PS14M)              [1760] Put that one on.

Richard (PS14H)            [1764] And that [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [1765] Take the brake off, and off we go.
                           [1766] Are we ready?
                           [1767] We'll reverse out the gate.
Richard (PS14H)            [1768] That way.
Ann (PS14B)                [1769] Are you going to reverse.
                           [1770] Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!
Bryony (PS14N)             [1771] I don't want

James (PS14M)              [1775] We're a minibus.

                           [1793] I don't know what Richard's driving.
Richard (PS14H)            [1794] I'm driving a double decker.
Ann (PS14B)                [1795] You're driving a double decker as well.

James (PS14M)              [1797] The road!
Ann (PS14B)                [1798] There we are.
James (PS14M)              [1799] Right.
Ann (PS14B)                [1800] Paul must be fixing his car.
Bryony (PS14N)             [1801] Paul not in his car today.
Ann (PS14B)                [1802] Pardon?
Bryony (PS14N)             [1803] Paul not in his car today?
Ann (PS14B)                [1804] Paul's not in his car today?
                           [1805] No.
                           [1806] I think he's been fixing it.
                           [1807] [cough] ... Not many flowers left on that
                           winter jasmine now are there?
James (PS14M)              [1808] Winter jasmine.
Ann (PS14B)                [1809] Yes.
                           [1810] It's winter jasmine.
                           [1811] There's only about six left on.
                           [1812] ... The leaves are growing now though.
                           [1813] The flowers come on before the leaves come
                           on.

Ann (PS14B)                [1841] I think it's an old one that somebody's
                           bought to use for themselves.
                           [1842] Cos they've painted the Telecom writing off
                           it.
                           [1843] So it's just plain yellow now.
                           [1844] The new Telecom vans are grey.
                           [1845] I like the yellow ones better.
James (PS14M)              [1846] I like the yellow ones.
Ann (PS14B)                [1847] You like the yellow ones as well.
                           [1848] They're nice bright ones aren't they?
Richard (PS14H)            [1849] I like the yellow ones.
James (PS14M)              [1850] Well ... the new ones are grey.
Ann (PS14B)                [1851] Can you see the sandbags?
                           [1852] Look at those sacks full of sand near the
                           door, near the shop door.
                           [1853] They're called sandbags, do you know what
                           they were for?
James (PS14M)              [1854] What sandbags?
Ann (PS14B)                [1855] That was to stop the water flooding into the
                           shop.
                           [1856] It didn't get quite that high though.

Richard (PS14H)            [1877] Why does it live there?

                           repaired.

                           [1924] Oh it's a [...] .
                           [1925] ... What colour's that car?
Richard (PS14H)            [1926] Black.
Ann (PS14B)                [1927] I can see an, an orange Land Rover.
                           [1928] It's an electric one, electric van.
                           [1929] ... Hurry up green man.
                           [1930] He's coming ... now.
                           [1931] Over we go.
                           [1932] Round the corner.
                           [1933] There look.
                           [1934] There's an electricity van.
                           [1935] It's an electricity Land Rover.
                           [1936] With two big ladders on it.
                           [1937] There.
                           [1938] ... Look at the trees now.
                           [1939] Oh look!
                           [1940] Can you see the buds ... on the conker trees?
                           [1941] Look!
                           [1942] They've all opened out.
                           [1943] Can you see all the new little leaves on the
                           conker tree?
Bryony (PS14N)             [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [1944] I didn't notice them before.
Bryony (PS14N)             [1945] No.
Ann (PS14B)                [1946] Probably cos we've had to walk with my head
                           down with the rain ... all the time.
                           [1947] ... Right, we'll go along ... we'll go the
                           long way.
James (PS14M)              [1948] No, go just here.
Ann (PS14B)                [1949] Mm?
James (PS14M)              [1950] What can we hear.
                           [1951] What can you hear?
Ann (PS14B)                [1952] Oh.
                           [1953] Yes we're going in here, we ... say that
                           again, what did you say?
                           [1954] What can you hear?
                           [1955] Oh!
                           [1956] That was what you said, what can you hear?
                           [1957] I can hear the
Richard (PS14H)            [1958] Car wash!
Ann (PS14B)                [1959] That's right.
                           [1960] The car wash.
                           [1961] You can see the steam coming from it cos it's
                           hot water.
                           [1962] ... I can hear the weir.
                           [1963] Listen.
                           [1964] Can you hear the weir.
James (PS14M)              [1965] I can hear the weir.
Ann (PS14B)                [1966] At least you can see the weir today, we
                           couldn't see it on ... Wednesday could we?
                           [1967] ... The water went straight across the top.
                           [1968] There wasn't a weir there.
James (PS14M)              [1969] Oh no!
Ann (PS14B)                [1970] Oh look.
                           [1971] It's all bubbling up again.
                           [1972] The water's still flowing very fast isn't it?
James (PS14M)              [1973] It's very deep.
                           [1974] It is very deep isn't it?
Ann (PS14B)                [1975] It is very deep.
                           [1976] It's very, very deep.
                           [1977] But it's gone down a lot.
                           [1978] ... I bet there's been a lot ducks' nests
                           washed away though.
                           [1979] I don't think there'll be as many ducklings
                           this year.
                           [1980] A lot of the ducks' nests will have been
                           washed away.
Bryony (PS14N)             [1981] I can see [...] .
Ann (PS14B)                [1982] Can you see the sand on this path where the
                           water's been right over the top of it?
Richard (PS14H)            [1983] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [1984] What you saying Bryony?
                           [1985] What love?
                           [1986] I wish you'd talk a bit louder I can't hear
                           you.
                           [1987] Look, here's another conker tree.
                           [1988] Horse chestnut.
                           [1989] Can you see the leaves?
                           [1990] Wait a minute, I can reach this one.
Bryony (PS14N)             [1991] So can I.
Ann (PS14B)                [1992] Look at this one, can you see ... hang on ...
                           there look ... look at the leaves opening, oh,
                           you're too far forward.
                           [1993] There look.
                           [1994] Can you see James?
James (PS14M)              [1995] No.
Ann (PS14B)                [1996] Up here look.
James (PS14M)              [1997] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [1998] And, can you see on the end, look ... that's
                           where the flowers'll grow, the blossom.
                           [1999] They look like big candles don't they, when
                           they're growing?
                           [2000] That's the beginnings of the flowers growing.
                           [2001] ... Can you see all the sand on the grass?
James (PS14M)              [2002] Up came the river and [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2003] Yes, the river washed it all up, right over
                           this path.
                           [2004] Look, we're going through sand now.
                           [2005] Think we were at the beach wouldn't you?
Richard (PS14H)            [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2006] Yes, it looks like the beach with all the
                           sand across the path.
                           [2007] The river washed it all up onto the path.
James (PS14M)              [2008] Ah!
                           [2009] Ah!
                           [2010] We're on a beach.
                           [2011] Look Ann.
Ann (PS14B)                [2012] Can't see the swans though.
                           [2013] They're not at this end of the river.
Richard (PS14H)            [2014] Can you see ducks, Ann?
Ann (PS14B)                [2015] Yes, I can see ducks.
                           [2016] Ah look!
                           [2017] There's a white duck.
                           [2018] Can you see the white duck?
                           [2019] Straight over there look.
                           [2020] There's a white
James (PS14M)              [2021] I see it!
Ann (PS14B)                [2022] duck.
James (PS14M)              [2023] There.
Richard (PS14H)            [2024] I can't see the white ducks over there.
Bryony (PS14N)             [2025] Oh oh!
                           [2026] [...] . There are white ducks over there.
Ann (PS14B)                [2027] White ducks like that one have escaped from
                           farms.
Richard (PS14H)            [2028] And th and the ... they're little, little
                           lady ducks.
Ann (PS14B)                [2029] There a lot more drakes than ducks though
                           look, aren't there?
Richard (PS14H)            [2030] They ... I look?
Ann (PS14B)                [2031] Yes, you look.
                           [2032] There's a
James (PS14M)              [2033] Moorhens!
Ann (PS14B)                [2034] Moorhens?
                           [2035] Where?
                           [2036] I can't se
James (PS14M)              [2037] Over there.
Ann (PS14B)                [2038] I can't see any just at the moment.
James (PS14M)              [2039] There.
Ann (PS14B)                [2040] How much time have we got?
                           [2041] Right, we'll go up this way, through the
                           promena along the promenade, and then we'll go ...
                           back through the town ... and it'll be time to get
                           the others from school by then.
Richard (PS14H)            [2042] Don't push me! ... [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2043] Right.
James (PS14M)              [2044] Where we going?
Ann (PS14B)                [2045] We're going for a walk along the river to see
                           if we can ... if the swans are near the Old Gate
                           Bridge.
Bryony (PS14N)             [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2046] See what else we can find to see.
James (PS14M)              [...]
Bryony (PS14N)             [2047] I'm having the bag like that one.

Ann (PS14B)                [2053] Are you carrying my bag for me?
Bryony (PS14N)             [2054] I'm carrying your bag for you.
Ann (PS14B)                [2055] Someone naughty's smashed a seat, look!
                           [2056] Can you see?
                           [2057] A seat's missing from there.
                           [2058] Just the posts at the end.
Bryony (PS14N)             [2059] Naughty [...] . [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2060] When Jim and I came along at ... night time
                           on Wednesday

Richard (PS14H)            [2065] there's some more duck.
Ann (PS14B)                [2066] Those are drakes those.
                           [2067] Yes.
                           [2068] They're the daddy ones.
                           [2069] There was erm, some ribbons tied right across
                           here sa saying police notice ... closed.
                           [2070] Couldn't go down there under the promenade.
                           [2071] But the river was right over the top of it.
James (PS14M)              [2072] Who left the gate open?
Ann (PS14B)                [2073] Who left the gate open?
                           [2074] I don't know.
                           [2075] Oh it's tied up a somebody's tied it back
                           with a piece of string.
Richard (PS14H)            [2076] What's the dog doing there?
Ann (PS14B)                [2077] What's the dog doing?
                           [2078] I can't see a dog, where is it?

Ann (PS14B)                [2101] Yes, we saw a white one, that was round near
                           the leisure centre.
James (PS14M)              [2102] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [2103] Wasn't it?
Richard (PS14H)            [2104] Over the bridge.
Ann (PS14B)                [2105] Can you see all the bubbles on the river.
                           [2106] All the white bits.
                           [2107] That's all the air bubbles because the
                           river's flowing so fast.
Richard (PS14H)            [2108] Blue, blue [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2109] And bubbling up over ... the stepping stones
                           and things.
                           [2110] ... Can you hear the birds singing?
                           [2111] Listen.
James (PS14M)              [2112] Er ... yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [2113] Can you hear?
Bryony (PS14N)             [2114] I hear birds singing.
Ann (PS14B)                [2115] You can hear the birds singing.
                           [2116] Yes.
                           [2117] They're in those trees up there.
James (PS14M)              [2118] I wanna go in the tunnel.
Ann (PS14B)                [2119] You want to go in the tunnel?
James (PS14M)              [2120] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [2121] You mean underneath the bridge?
                           [2122] I think it's still flooded James.
James (PS14M)              [2123] I want to go under the bridge.
Ann (PS14B)                [2124] It was still flooded yesterday. [sniff]
Richard (PS14H)            [2125] And all up under the [...] ?
James (PS14M)              [2126] I want to go under the tunnel.
                           [2127] I want to go under the tunnel.
Ann (PS14B)                [2128] We can't pet, I can't get the buggy down the
                           steps
James (PS14M)              [2129] I've got
Ann (PS14B)                [2130] anyway.
James (PS14M)              [2131] I've got ... I've got my coat on.
Ann (PS14B)                [2132] Yes, you've got your coat on.
                           [2133] You need your coat on today don't you?

Bryony (PS14N)             [2135] I've got coat on.
Ann (PS14B)                [2136] Yes, we've all got our coats on.
                           [2137] Cos it's cold.
                           [2138] Look at the wind blowing the trees.
                           [2139] Can you see the wind blowing the leaves?
Richard (PS14H)            [2140] Yes, I can.

                           wire netting?
                           [2145] Can you see James?
                           [2146] Look ... all of this, this is where the river
                           came up to.
                           [2147] The wa the water was right up to there.
                           [2148] That's why no one could come along here on
                           Wednesday night.
                           [2149] You can see how high the water is with all
                           ... all that
Richard (PS14H)            [2150] All with the water!

                           the fence.
                           [2152] [sniff] ... There's a bird singing, listen.
                           [2153] ... Can you hear it?
                           [2154] Sounds as if it's just above us
Richard (PS14H)            [2155] [...] sand.
Ann (PS14B)                [2156] doesn't it?

Ann (PS14B)                [2163] all stuck on the fence.
                           [2164] Bits of grass and leaves.
Bryony (PS14N)             [cough]
Ann (PS14B)                [2165] And all kinds of rubbish
James (PS14M)              [2166] What?
Ann (PS14B)                [2167] stuck on the fence cos that ... that's how
                           high the river was.
                           [2168] ... And there's all those things got washed
                           along in the river, they got stuck on the fence.
                           [2169] And that's how hi you can tell how high it
                           was.
                           [2170] ... It was right over the top of this seat
                           look.
James (PS14M)              [2171] On the back.
Ann (PS14B)                [2172] Even over the back of this seat.
Bryony (PS14N)             [2173] I see some on the fence.
Ann (PS14B)                [2174] Mm mm.
Bryony (PS14N)             [2175] It got stuck on the fence.

                           [2177] Didn't get stuck on here because

Ann (PS14B)                [2178] these ... this fence is, has, hasn't got
Bryony (PS14N)             [2179] Stuck on the fence.

Bryony (PS14N)             [2181] It's stuck on the fence.

                           stuck underneath the bridge.

Ann (PS14B)                [2196] There's a big tree stuck underneath the
                           bridge.
                           [2197] If you look un can you see the bridge over
                           there?
                           [2198] Underneath the arch ... of the bridge.
James (PS14M)              [2199] What's it doing
Ann (PS14B)                [2200] It's a big tree stuck there.
                           [2201] Now, can Richard see it?
                           [2202] Hang on a minute.
                           [2203] ... Bryony, can you see it now?
                           [2204] Look through there ... look through that ...
                           opening there.
                           [2205] You're looking the wrong way.
                           [2206] Let's see if Richard can see it.
                           [2207] It's a huge tree!
Richard (PS14H)            [2208] I can see it in the way.

Bryony (PS14N)             [2216] I was looking the wrong way.
Ann (PS14B)                [2217] What?
Bryony (PS14N)             [2218] I was looking the wrong way.
Ann (PS14B)                [2219] You were looking the wrong [laughing] way []
                           ?
                           [2220] Yeah.
Bryony (PS14N)             [2221] Round the wrong way.
James (PS14M)              [2222] I can,

Richard (PS14H)            [2226] No.
Ann (PS14B)                [2227] Look, if you look down there ... under the
                           bridge in the tunnel, look it's still flooded.
                           [2228] Oh!
                           [2229] Look at all the sand, you can't get down the
                           sand's so deep.
                           [2230] Cos the river was right up here.
                           [2231] ... Look at all that sand
James (PS14M)              [2232] Look at that.

Richard (PS14H)            [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2234] Tha would make a huge sand pit that would.
James (PS14M)              [2235] Look at that!
Ann (PS14B)                [2236] Ooh!

                           [2238] Look at the state of the path, it's all wet
                           mud.
                           [2239] Never mind.
                           [2240] We can't go back again, we'll have to go this
                           way.
                           [2241] Look at the muddy state of the path!
Richard (PS14H)            [2242] It's all muddy. [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [2243] We're gonna have muddy wheels.
                           [2244] Never mind.

                           [2248] That's a horse box for carrying horses
                           around.
                           [2249] But it's empty.
                           [2250] There isn't a horse in it.
                           [2251] If I can get across this road ... and the
                           bridge ... I'll take you over the other side and you
                           might be able see the big tree trunk better.
Richard (PS14H)            [...]

Unknown speaker (KB8PSUNK) [2268] Oh.
                           [2269] No.
Ann (PS14B)                [2270] It's had the handle repaired three times.
Unknown speaker (KB8PSUNK) [2271] Times, yeah.

                           [2277] It looks it.
Ann (PS14B)                [2278] You know when I want to turn a corner I've
                           got to stand on my toes and put my full weight on it
                           to turn it.

Ann (PS14B)                [2283] and they can walk a long way

Ann (PS14B)   [3763] all you told me was that Miss was retiring.
              [3764] But, I haven't to tell anyone.
              [3765] Which I haven't done.
              [3766] ... Which I don't intend to do.
James (PS14C) [3767] At the beginning of Lent Miss approached me
Ann (PS14B)   [3768] Yes.
James (PS14C) [3769] to see ... what she should do about the Lenten appeal
Ann (PS14B)   [3770] Aha.
James (PS14C) [3771] as she always does.
              [3772] Since I said, why send money to Great Ormond Street when
              there was ... plenty of children's things local?
Ann (PS14B)   [3773] Yes.
James (PS14C) [3774] So I asked if we wanted anything?
              [3775] And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital?
Ann (PS14B)   [3776] What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
James (PS14C) [3777] Well there are special beds.
Ann (PS14B)   [3778] Oh you mean a bed?
              [3779] Well
James (PS14C) [3780] Tt!
Ann (PS14B)   [3781] D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be
James (PS14C) [3782] Well, she just asked about a bed, so I told her that ...
              we were
Ann (PS14B)   [3783] You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
              [3784] But why's
James (PS14C) [3785] She di na she just said a bed, and so
Ann (PS14B)   [3786] Yes.
James (PS14C) [3787] I told her there were special beds that we have ... are
              very useful, in fact ... very necessary in some, some cases, and
              are ... painfully short of them.
Ann (PS14B)   [3788] Aha.
James (PS14C) [3789] And a Nimbas bed ... costs two thousand pound.
              [3790] And there's another one on the market which I can't
              remember the name of, which costs a lot more.
Ann (PS14B)   [3791] Mhm.
James (PS14C) [3792] Something like, five thousand.
              [3793] But I can't remember the name.
              [3794] Anyway, I said I'd ... make enquiries as to what a ... is
              wanted.
              [3795] And I said there's a, there's a new children's ward ...
              will open at the Wandsbergh Hospital ... perhaps they would like
              something.
              [3796] I saw Mrs , and Mrs said ... they were aiming to raise
              money for the scanner appeal.
Ann (PS14B)   [3797] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [3798] But, also they're going to ... have a ... an obstetric
              adult patient's department ... at the College Hospital for the
              very first time.
Ann (PS14B)   [3799] A what?
              [3800] A
James (PS14C) [3801] An obstetric outpatients
Ann (PS14B)   [3802] Yeah.
              [3803] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [3804] and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other
              children ... with mothers then ... so they would like perhaps a
              play facility there.
              [3805] And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to
              the
Ann (PS14B)   [...]
James (PS14C) [3806] or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty
Ann (PS14B)   [3807] Yes.
James (PS14C) [3808] there's very limited facilities for children to play.
              [3809] So ... but I also coaxed Mrs about ... the Wandsbergh
              [...] .
              [3810] Anyway, she ... wanted to, me to go and see her, she said
              there we there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to
              talk about all sorts of other things that were possible ... and
              ... because there was an arts appeal and ... for arts facilities
              at the hospital, and all sorts of things.
              [3811] So ... I went back to Miss and said about the scanner
              appeal and she said that would be ... she thought that that would
              be the best idea.
              [3812] ... Not the children's things at the ... Cottage Hospital.
              [3813] I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital
              ... and ... the children from ... will be invited to the hospital
              for that day ... that week, sorry.
              [3814] It's gonna be a week ... [...] .
              [3815] So she wanted to know what date it is.
              [3816] So I, I asked Mrs to ... but would she write to Miss and
              give her all the details.
              [3817] And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went
              to see and explained it all.
              [3818] And that she was going on Wednesday, I think.
              [3819] Up she went ... you know
Ann (PS14B)   [3820] Hold on.
              [3821] Which one was going to see which
James (PS14C) [3822] It's
Ann (PS14B)   [3823] one?
James (PS14C) [3824] Mrs was going to see Miss
Ann (PS14B)   [3825] Was going to see Miss
James (PS14C) [3826] .
Ann (PS14B)   [3827] Oh.
              [3828] I see.
              [3829] I didn't know which one.
James (PS14C) [3830] But I give them a ... so then I saw Mrs on Tuesday ...
              [cough] ... when I was at Ashington.
              [3831] And she came up with all sorts of things that ... she
              would like for the ... the new Wandsbergh development.
              [3832] But on a ... but there's nothing ready of course, so th
              ... there's, there's a ... giant sundial they're going to have in
              one of the courtyards ... and it's a giant one ... it's, it's
              the, the building and the blocks of ... things in, in the ... in
              the courtyard that make up the ... the time.
              [3833] So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the ... of
              the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine
              o'clock and so forth.
              [3834] This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and
              things so she's got
Ann (PS14B)   [3835] Hold on.
              [3836] Wha how ... where is it going to be seen from?
James (PS14C) [3837] I presume it's seen from the wards ... that are up behind
              looking down onto this courtyard.
              [3838] There's also erm ... a play area for the ... the
              children's ward ... there's also some murals on the ... the
              walls, various artistic murals.
              [3839] And, of course, they've got this grant from ... Artcan ...
              for six thousand pound ... for a proggie mat ... exhibition.
Ann (PS14B)   [3840] A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat
James (PS14C) [3841] Well
Ann (PS14B)   [3842] exhibition?
James (PS14C) [3843] well over, over a period, it's ... and other things too
              but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved
              in it.
              [3844] ... And various other art things.
              [3845] But also,th the thought of a gar a garden and the children
              keeping the garden ... up.
              [3846] But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have
              transport difficulties to go from here ... to ... the Wandsbergh
              Hospital.
              [3847] But then I thought, perhaps ... if ... that
Ann (PS14B)   [3848] I can't see the education committee ... with their lack of
              money paying for transport for children from here
James (PS14C) [3849] Well they won't
Ann (PS14B)   [3850] to go Ashington Hospital to do a
James (PS14C) [3851] they won't so the they, they
Ann (PS14B)   [3852] garden.
James (PS14C) [3853] the, the, the ... education committee and the school
              governors have no money at all
Ann (PS14B)   [3854] No.
James (PS14C) [3855] to pay for that.
Ann (PS14B)   [3856] I would expect
James (PS14C) [3857] But then
Ann (PS14B)   [3858] that's a very low priority.
James (PS14C) [3859] well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing.
              [3860] They won't get the money.
              [3861] Th they won't pay for them to go swimming
Ann (PS14B)   [3862] Well I don't
James (PS14C) [3863] they've gotta walk to go swimming.
              [3864] But, I thought that ... now that the M S has acquired that
              bus ... and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for
              most of the time ... and it's a twenty nine seater bus.
              [3865] I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in
              ... but ... in between times it's twenty seats you see.
Ann (PS14B)   [3866] And then you'll need a P S V
James (PS14C) [3867] Well
Ann (PS14B)   [3868] licence.
James (PS14C) [3869] but, but that's, that's ... that's easily remedied if you
              could get a er ... a driving licence holder ... to take them ...
              oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents
              ... or somebody who could take the children, er, periodically in
              the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing.
              [3870] So that was a possibility.
              [3871] But I haven't seen Miss about all these sort of things.
              [3872] But I did also say ... to Mrs , that a new head would be
              appointed to take the imports from the first of September, that
              it might be better to discuss it with them ... after I've
              discussed with Miss .
Ann (PS14B)   [3873] I only know one person ... I only know one bus driver with
              children.
James (PS14C) [3874] There's ambulance drivers.
Ann (PS14B)   [3875] And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic
              School.
              [3876] Er ... this ... letter from the Multiple Sclerosis
James (PS14C) [3877] Yes.
              [3878] Says any
Ann (PS14B)   [3879] that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your
              number of people.
              [3880] You're not
James (PS14C) [3881] To sixteen.
Ann (PS14B)   [3882] you're not reducing the size of the bus.
James (PS14C) [3883] Well I think that's crazy.
Ann (PS14B)   [3884] And someone who's been just used to driving a car ... are
              they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra
James (PS14C) [3885] Well
Ann (PS14B)   [3886] tuition?
James (PS14C) [3887] Well I, I
Ann (PS14B)   [3888] Whether it's got ... whether it's got sixteen people in it
              or ... twenty nine
James (PS14C) [3889] Well er
Ann (PS14B)   [3890] it doesn't alter the length of the bus.
James (PS14C) [3891] I drive the minibus at the hospital
Ann (PS14B)   [3892] I know.
James (PS14C) [3893] which only takes four wheelchairs ... and of course
              there's the drivers of, of the minibus things that bring them.
              [3894] I think, I, I would query that anyway, that just [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [3895] Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus
              with no extra tuition
James (PS14C) [3896] No.
Ann (PS14B)   [3897] and just drive
James (PS14C) [3898] But, but
Ann (PS14B)   [3899] it?
James (PS14C) [3900] but I query as well, whether just because you reduce the
              number of spa passengers in it ... that you, you, you don't need
              ... a P S V licence, or the equivalent isn't a P S V licence but
              it's, it's
Ann (PS14B)   [3901] Oh you do,the they've looked into that.
James (PS14C) [3902] But it sounds ... doubtful to me.
              [3903] But anyway ... there's the insurance point of view.
              [3904] But anyway, any ... I mean ... that's the easy, and I
              mean, if, if people who are willing to drive can have experience
              in driving ... before they take passengers out.
              [3905] I mean, I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it
              without passengers.
Ann (PS14B)   [3906] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [3907] I mean I ... I, I ... I [laughing] drove the minibus []
              ... with only somebody in with me ... before I drove out with
              people in it.
Ann (PS14B)   [3908] Didn't you da drive Dancy Dags?
James (PS14C) [3909] Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that.
Ann (PS14B)   [3910] Yeah, but ... yo you drove that one
James (PS14C) [3911] I drove it to Ashington and [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [3912] Mm.
              [3913] You drive her to Ashington in it.
James (PS14C) [3914] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [3915] Erm ... do you think I should throw these roses out?
              [3916] They're
James (PS14C) [3917] Aha.
Ann (PS14B)   [3918] dead aren't they?
James (PS14C) [3919] I'm afraid so.
Ann (PS14B)   [3920] It's a shame.
James (PS14C) [3921] Well they'll be forced for last Sunday.
Ann (PS14B)   [3922] Pardon?
James (PS14C) [3923] They will be forced for last Sunday, and that was
Ann (PS14B)   [3924] Oh I know.
James (PS14C) [3925] the air wasn't it?
Ann (PS14B)   [3926] I know, but they were dead by about Tuesday.
              [3927] The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.
              [3928] So ... what a shame.
              [3929] Never mind.
              [3930] ... Right, I'll put my make up on.
James (PS14C) [3931] Have you decided where you want this umbrella tree?
Ann (PS14B)   [3932] Er er
James (PS14C) [3933] You need a saucer at the bottom.
              [3934] But they're never the right size for that it wants [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [3935] Well there's a huge saucer on the old one.
James (PS14C) [3936] Ah but that's in it ... you can put one in that
Ann (PS14B)   [3937] Well
James (PS14C) [3938] plant pot, that's a different matter altogether.
Ann (PS14B)   [3939] Jus just leave it there for now.
              [3940] Erm ... I'm going to put my make up on ... and think what
              I need from the shops.
James (PS14C) [3941] Right.
              [3942] It's ten o'clock love.
Ann (PS14B)   [3943] I know.
              [3944] I'm gonna have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner.
              [3945] ... I'll take that upstairs with me.
              [3946] Ooh!
              [3947] My head feels a lot better.
James (PS14C) [3948] It's gotta be better.
Ann (PS14B)   [3949] [sighing] Oh [] !
              [3950] ... I don't
James (PS14C) [3951] That er
Ann (PS14B)   [3952] I haven't had a ... a headache like this for a
James (PS14C) [3953] Still it's much more quick.
Ann (PS14B)   [3954] I know.
              [3955] I need some ... le er ... the, I wanted a carton of live
              yoghurt ... I don't think the live yoghurt I used was any good
              because, for a start [laughing] it was [] fruit flavoured, no it
              wasn't, it was natural, but it said mild flavoured
James (PS14C) [3956] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [3957] and I don't think it was the proper ... like the Greek
              style, real live yoghurt that would have
James (PS14C) [3958] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [3959] started all the fungus growing on it.
              [3960] It is beginning to look like a proper stone cup though.
              [3961] And they're saying that ... er ... okay, I'll go and get
              ready.
James (PS14C) [3962] So do you want the yoghurt, yoghurt before we go to the
              ... [...] ?
Ann (PS14B)   [3963] I don't think it matters, but ... if the weather's still
              going to be freezing at night
James (PS14C) [3964] And if so does, does
Ann (PS14B)   [3965] I've got the
James (PS14C) [3966] the, [laughing] it's outside all the time anyway [] .
Ann (PS14B)   [3967] I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still.
              [3968] ... I got it standing on that brick ... so it would drain.
              [3969] ... I wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
              [3970] Some of the ... erm ... stems on it look as if the ... not
              mouldy but they're, they're sort of
James (PS14C) [3971] Well we'll just have to dig it up and put
Ann (PS14B)   [3972] green.
James (PS14C) [3973] another one in.
Ann (PS14B)   [3974] Those hyacinths in the cauldron are taking a long time to
              come out aren't they?
James (PS14C) [3975] I know.
Ann (PS14B)   [3976] I would have thought the tulip ... that went in the er
              coal scuttle ... the tulips in the cauldron ... I thought they'd
              had it, they were lying down completely.
James (PS14C) [3977] I know.
              [3978] They just straightened
Ann (PS14B)   [3979] They were
James (PS14C) [3980] up.
Ann (PS14B)   [3981] just ... grown up again.
              [3982] And those ... forget-me-nots ... that are called blue ball
              and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers, they're coming
              out with erm ... tiny ... pinkey, purpley flowers.
James (PS14C) [3983] I know.
Ann (PS14B)   [3984] If they're blue, so am I!
James (PS14C) [3985] And then we've got miniature roses gonna come up, one
              that's on it own, that one with the
Ann (PS14B)   [3986] The wha
James (PS14C) [3987] on the tub.
Ann (PS14B)   [3988] Is there one in the tub?
              [3989] No.
James (PS14C) [3990] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [3991] Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay, it's the other one.
James (PS14C) [3992] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)   [3993] I like the other best as well, it's the peach one.

James (PS14C) [3995] Well, when I plant that other one where you want it
              planted, that's

Ann (PS14B)   [3998] Yes.
              [3999] Oh!

              wheelbarrow ... valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden
              ... and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill.
              [4001] Where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible.
              [4002] ... So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them
              a lot more than thirty pounds.
James (PS14C) [4003] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [4004] Cos it didn't, it didn't say ... a wrought iron
              wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow.

James (PS14C) [4020] The Sistine Chapel.
              [4021] We mustn't take those big ones with us.

James (PS14C) [4038] When have I had an opportunity to watch the tape?
Ann (PS14B)   [4039] Oh!

              or other.

James (PS14C)              [4053] Well do you want to walk or do you want to go
                           in the car?
Ann (PS14B)                [4054] Well I'll have to go ... to the paper shop.

James (PS14C)              [4061] No, I haven't.

                           the prices.

                           [4077] ... That means I haven't got a key to get
                           back in the house.
James (PS14C)              [laugh]

                           could have gone down and gone ... over there.

Bill (PS15S)  [4288] And er
Ann (PS14B)   [4289] So they've got, they've got it back now, so it's got
              nothing to do with us?

Ann (PS14B)   [4292] Do you work?
Bill (PS15S)  [4293] No. [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [4294] Mm.
James (PS14C) [4295] No, erm ... basically er ... I think for the [...] anyhow
              Trevor will be coming in, so we'll, we just st try and stay a
              little more to see what happens at the end.
Bill (PS15S)  [4296] [...] ... But erm
James (PS14C) [4297] See they handed it over to us and, but they didn't wanna
              ... you know, it was very ... when, what they call them?
              [4298] Erm
Bill (PS15S)  [4299] It was Temple wasn't it,la last year?
James (PS14C) [4300] Aye, Temple was ... [...] ... but it, it was a good job
              because we had no oranges ... and they had to go and break in.
              [laugh]
Bill (PS15S)  [4301] It's alright now [...] .
James (PS14C) [4302] [clears throat] ... Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [4303] Was that the year the oranges were horrible?

Bill (PS15S)  [4310] Aye.
James (PS14C) [4311] They've never been really nice.
Bill (PS15S)  [4312] Yeah.
              [4313] Well I don't know where they're getting them from, but I
              mean, that's what they say.
Ann (PS14B)   [4314] Well that year
Bill (PS15S)  [4315] And they've got Round Table laid on to help and they want
              help from the ... from us.
              [4316] So they want us to go around at ... half past one ... or
              the two of them can start cos we've got an addition [...] .
James (PS14C) [4317] Well, it worked.
              [4318] Er, I'm just ... wondered, you know,wi with ... because
              they came to expect it and we, we didn't know.
              [4319] And, they'd handed it over to us and then ... obviously
              they wanted it back, but then
Bill (PS15S)  [4320] Well, I think it's like everything else, I think that ...
              er, with, with Lawrence being off they're just sort of meeting
              everything as a crisis and getting, getting
Ann (PS14B)   [4321] Well if you're at work
James (PS14C) [4322] Yo you see as well to go with what you call them?
James (PS14C) [4323] Er, [...]
Bill (PS15S)  [...]
James (PS14C) [4324] he, he
Bill (PS15S)  [4325] Didn't
James (PS14C) [4326] he didn't want anything to do with it you see.
              [4327] That's where ... and he's not from [...] , he's not from
              this end so ... had ... er no real interest ... for him I don't
              think.
Ann (PS14B)   [4328] If you're at work Dorothy could go ... If I help, I'll
              help with Trevor with his triplets.
James (PS14C) [4329] Well you can go and get their oranges and the
Ann (PS14B)   [4330] Yes, but it's, he, he ... couldn't possibly push that
              buggy
James (PS14C) [sigh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4331] around that field.
James (PS14C) [4332] But it isn't in the fields though.

              the middle.
James (PS14C) [4350] Well in actual fact, people who turned out were Isobel ...
              and me, and er ... what they call him?

              one tentatively mentioned about the [...] .
James (PS14C) [4372] Well that's it.

              would do ... we said we would give the money towards the prizes.

James (PS14C) [4394] because, cos it's Rotaract who's always

James (PS14C) [4396] Mhm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4397] But I'm er
James (PS14C) [4398] But they were keen.

Ann (PS14B)   [4403] I know all the children.
James (PS14C) [4404] I mean, we thought it'd rain this year so it's ... more
Bill (PS15S)  [4405] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [4406] likely to be a better day then
Ann (PS14B)   [4407] And ee, all the kids ended up with a prize didn't they?
James (PS14C) [4408] Oh, eventually, yes.
              [4409] I mean,th the

James (PS14C) [4419] Yes.
              [4420] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [4421] They had big eggs, well, you know, sort of the

Bill (PS15S)  [4430] Yes.
              [4431] [cough] ... well
Ann (PS14B)   [4432] before they ran out.
Bill (PS15S)  [4433] It's surprising actually cos th the more, the more ...
              common ones do run out because of course th the other ones are a
              bit pricey.
Ann (PS14B)   [4434] The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round ...
              and then they run out at Easter.
              [4435] That's happened, I couldn't get any ... one year ... I
              took the triplets to the erm ... Goose Hill coffee morning in the
              Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola ... and one
              of them ... won a Creme Egg
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4436] but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his
              drink and to put it in my bag ... and er ... it was lunchtime
              when we got home and we were going some ... I, I can't remember
              what we were doing afterwards ... so I gave it to his mother, I
              thought she could share it.
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4437] Mind, by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between ...
              those three and their older brother
Bill (PS15S)  [4438] Yeah.
              [4439] There's not much of it left.
Ann (PS14B)   [laugh]
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4440] No, but I could have seen a, there'd be an ... almighty
              tantrums from the other two if Ji er
Bill (PS15S)  [4441] Aha.
Ann (PS14B)   [4442] James had had it.
Bill (PS15S)  [4443] I can imagine.
Ann (PS14B)   [4444] Mm.
              [4445] Mm.
James (PS14C) [4446] Is there anything much for the agenda for a week on
              Tuesday?
Bill (PS15S)  [4447] Not a great deal.
              [4448] I mean, what I'll
James (PS14C) [4449] Yeah.
Bill (PS15S)  [4450] do is ... we'll get rid of those couple of things left
              over
James (PS14C) [4451] Mhm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4452] and er ... basically, it's, Peter's got the one coming
              which is er ... put the ducks in the river.
James (PS14C) [4453] Mm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4454] Er, he's doing the, a, and what I'm er sug suggesting
James (PS14C) [4455] Aha.
Bill (PS15S)  [4456] like well ... apparently the fella that's done it, for
              years, and years, for years, for years has had a [...]
James (PS14C) [4457] Mhm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4458] and he's, he's just ... ke you know what I mean, I think
              he's, he's getting an extension so that's why there's a bit of
              delay on that.
James (PS14C) [4459] Mhm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4460] And it's where that lot meet [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [4461] I've been counting them since.
James (PS14C) [4462] Well how much, I mean
Ann (PS14B)   [4463] I read the letter in the paper.
James (PS14C) [4464] how much was he paying [...] ?
Bill (PS15S)  [4465] It was summat like er ... I dunno, it was summat like five
              hundred pound a year.
              [4466] It was quite modest.
James (PS14C) [4467] Mm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4468] Er
Ann (PS14B)   [4469] There were thirteen
James (PS14C) [4470] But
Ann (PS14B)   [4471] drakes cha ... er chasing one duck ... er, just past the
              baths along the promenade.
              [4472] And then we sat ... at the far side of the Old Gate bridge
              ... and er ... an old lady came along ... and said, and she was
              counting them ... but she said, just look at that thing, she
              counted seven ... although, in actual fact, by then ... th these
              dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they
              were all sitting down.
              [4473] And a there was a domestic one ... in each group ... there
              was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was
              another white one ... near Old Gate Bridge.
James (PS14C) [4474] Did he cull them as well?
Bill (PS15S)  [4475] Yeah, apparently so.
Ann (PS14B)   [4476] Yes.
James (PS14C) [4477] Did he feed them?
              [4478] Cos there's ... there was, there used to be fe feed put
              down for that as well. [...]
Bill (PS15S)  [4479] Well, to be honest, it seems to, I ... Peter's got the
              details cos he's been talking to er, the public health clerk.
James (PS14C) [4480] Mhm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4481] But it's, it's, it's ... it sort a ... it's, I think
              carrying through from the old borough days
James (PS14C) [4482] That's right.
Bill (PS15S)  [4483] and, somebody ha erm ... nobody really knew a great deal
              about it, so I think he's been doing some research on that.
              [4484] That's the one paper that is a bit er ... maybe a bit so
              ... but th I'll have to check with the N ... R A because of
              course er, the river
James (PS14C) [4485] Mm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4486] er policing is their responsibility.
James (PS14C) [4487] It is.
Bill (PS15S)  [4488] They, they've not ... they'll not do that.
James (PS14C) [4489] No.
Bill (PS15S)  [4490] No.
              [4491] But I mean,we really, we've gotta make sure that they
              haven't got any objections.
              [4492] But of course, in the meanwhile, of course we've had a
              flood.
Ann (PS14B)   [4493] Yes.
James (PS14C) [4494] And it's going to kill most of the
Ann (PS14B)   [4495] Yes.
James (PS14C) [4496] eggs ... wash most of the nests away I was thinking
              yesterday.
Bill (PS15S)  [4497] It's bloody incredible actually!
              [4498] We always get extreme [...] .
James (PS14C) [4499] Well that's, it wasn't a obviously as high as the flood
              twenty seven years ago.
Bill (PS15S)  [4500] No.
James (PS14C) [4501] But was, pretty near.
              [4502] It was getting near.
              [4503] But of course the higher standards they've got no
              protection cos they ... didn't want ... what was offered.
Bill (PS15S)  [4504] They didn't want a bank.
James (PS14C) [4505] Well that's right.
Bill (PS15S)  [4506] Er none whatsoever.
James (PS14C) [4507] It was
Bill (PS15S)  [...]
James (PS14C) [4508] a raised footpath that was before
Bill (PS15S)  [4509] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [4510] this wasn't it?
              [4511] Than, than the bridge right round.
Bill (PS15S)  [4512] Which is what we're doing at, at the Wandsbeck innit?
              [4513] So we'll put a ... we'll put a bank in, very deliberately
              at the first level
James (PS14C) [4514] Mhm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4515] erm ... and went right the way through with, it did look,
              it doesn't look bad at all, it was
James (PS14C) [4516] Yeah well ... no, it didn't.
              [4517] I mean, this looks ... well there's nothing else they
              could do here.
              [4518] It doesn't look il ugly, but I mean it, it ... it's not
              attractive
Bill (PS15S)  [4519] No.
James (PS14C) [4520] but it's
Bill (PS15S)  [...]
James (PS14C) [4521] but, but, but they've got protection.
Bill (PS15S)  [4522] But I mean er that one lent itself to that.
James (PS14C) [4523] That's right.
              [4524] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [4525] Yes.
James (PS14C) [4526] It would have been ideal.
Bill (PS15S)  [4527] But you see now of course, that was when there were River
James (PS14C) [4528] Yeah.
Bill (PS15S)  [4529] River Authority days and
James (PS14C) [4530] Yeah.
Bill (PS15S)  [4531] that was quite good.
              [4532] Erm ... it was quite useful er, they ... you could get
              things done, now
James (PS14C) [4533] Mm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4534] now it's nothing.
James (PS14C) [4535] Well they just ... put
Ann (PS14B)   [4536] I came along the river path when I came home from
              shopping.
              [4537] Sitting in the, the sand, damp sand [laughing] under the
              bridge [] .
James (PS14C) [4538] Mm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4539] You never saw that one that would er ... you know the one
              on the Bedford Road because Bedford Road has a [...]
James (PS14C) [4540] Well they ... that's right.
              [4541] I mean
Ann (PS14B)   [4542] Yes.
James (PS14C) [4543] there's nothing can be done, than the
Ann (PS14B)   [4544] No.
James (PS14C) [4545] nothing at all.
Ann (PS14B)   [4546] Mhm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4547] Mhm.
James (PS14C) [4548] But er, ah, you know, it gets up into the garden but I
              don't think it, it's got anywhere near the house er this time,
              cos I was up there ... on Thursday and I, you could see where it
              had been, but it was ... and I mi I'd have got very worried about
              er
Bill (PS15S)  [4549] But you could actually put a bag all the way and tie it
              into ... tie it into er ... the ... it's the Skillery Bridge that
              one.
James (PS14C) [4550] Yes, the Skillery Bridge
Bill (PS15S)  [4551] And
James (PS14C) [4552] yeah.
Bill (PS15S)  [4553] you just sort of tied up the
Ann (PS14B)   [4554] Well
James (PS14C) [4555] Yes, well, that's where we'll have to go from there
Bill (PS15S)  [4556] I think.
James (PS14C) [4557] round ... but
Ann (PS14B)   [4558] There were wild rumours flying around on Wednesday, I was
              told
James (PS14C) [4559] They didn't want to
Ann (PS14B)   [4560] by several people that the Skillery had gone.
              [4561] In
James (PS14C) [4562] But it hadn't, no.
Bill (PS15S)  [4563] It survived. [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [4564] Well Jim, Jim saw the children going back to er ... school
              after swimming
Bill (PS15S)  [4565] Oh.
Ann (PS14B)   [4566] over it on Thursday afternoon ... but er
James (PS14C) [4567] But there was a lot of debris up against it, and high up
              against it!
Ann (PS14B)   [4568] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [4569] So they could see how bad
Ann (PS14B)   [4570] Was Fold Cottage flooded?
James (PS14C) [4571] It was bound to be
Ann (PS14B)   [4572] It didn't
James (PS14C) [4573] Ann.
              [4574] Bound to be.
Ann (PS14B)   [4575] I thought they built a wall around it the
James (PS14C) [4576] No.
Ann (PS14B)   [4577] last people who bought it.
Bill (PS15S)  [4578] Yeah, but even on that you see,yo yo you know,yo ...
              you're never really stuck with it ... I mean
James (PS14C) [4579] No.
Bill (PS15S)  [4580] [...] , once you're in the clear ... you ... really it's
              the silliest in the world to have a little [...] actually.
James (PS14C) [4581] Yeah.
              [4582] Well this , who is ... must be related to David , anyway,
              erm ... they bought the house facing the o is it Old Cross, Old
              Gate bridge ... and has spent a lot of money on doing it up,li
              just over three million ... of course the whole of the downstairs
              was flooded today.
Bill (PS15S)  [4583] Is that Mrs 's?
James (PS14C) [4584] Yes, that's right.
              [4585] The one
Ann (PS14B)   [4586] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [4587] facing her, that's right.
              [4588] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [4589] Aha.
              [4590] It's called Aubern House is it?
James (PS14C) [4591] That's right.
Bill (PS15S)  [4592] That's right.
              [4593] It's Aubern, it's bigger than Aubern Place on the left.
James (PS14C) [4594] No, it's, it's not, it's called something Cottage
              actually.
              [4595] Aubern is the one round the corner.
Bill (PS15S)  [4596] Ah.
Ann (PS14B)   [4597] Oh!
Bill (PS15S)  [4598] Aye, she must have lived around the corner ... but she was
              the [...] .
              [4599] Cos she was only, the only one I'm thi
James (PS14C) [4600] The first one I'm sure is something Cottage.
              [4601] It might be Aubern Cottage but ... but the one round the
              corner ... the newer one, not the stone one
Bill (PS15S)  [4602] Aye.
James (PS14C) [4603] the stone one
Bill (PS15S)  [4604] Cos he used to live in that one..

              [4613] The original Stan [...] .
James (PS14C) [4614] Aye.
Bill (PS15S)  [4615] [...] ... And he, and I remember ah, er er, I mean I was
              only, well I was sort of and he had his feet up on the table, he
              was smoking a cigarette ... and he, and he had a laid back
              attitude. [laugh]
James (PS14C) [4616] Oh yes, definitely.
              [4617] But we, we got our mortgage from, from the council, you
              know, obviously
Bill (PS15S)  [4618] Aha.
James (PS14C) [4619] because it's ... our ... it's, Ann was pregnant then ...
              didn't smo and she didn't smoke so
Ann (PS14B)   [4620] And I, I gave up smoking when I was pregnant.
James (PS14C) [4621] So, do you smoke?
              [4622] No.
              [4623] I don't smoke.

              [4626] Erm, have you got any hire purchase goods?
              [4627] No.
              [4628] The, the cooker which we were buying quarterly, can't have
              a mortgage.
Ann (PS14B)   [4629] It was ... it was the
James (PS14C) [4630] They say they won't believe that.
Ann (PS14B)   [4631] The cooker was three pounds a quarter.
James (PS14C) [4632] He says they won't believe
Ann (PS14B)   [4633] And he let
James (PS14C) [4634] they, you can't have it, I'll put you down as a moderate
              drinker.
Ann (PS14B)   [4635] We couldn't afford to drink!
              [4636] We were destitute in those days
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4637] We didn't know at the time, but I wasn't working
James (PS14C) [4638] Couldn't have a mortgage.
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4639] and we were actually living, living below the poverty
              line.
              [4640] If I'd read ... erm ... i if I'd read properly ... all the
              instructions in the back of the er ... book
James (PS14C) [4641] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [4642] I would have got fo erm ... free orange juice, free
              vitamin drops

Ann (PS14B)   [4646] But, Jim was a charge nurse.
              [4647] Goodness only knows what ... staff nurses did then?
              [4648] Jim was a charge nurse, it never occurred to us that we
              were living before, below the poverty line.
Bill (PS15S)  [4649] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [4650] I mean, er

              could get gorgeous bacon bones with plenty bacon on in the Co-op
              in those days, it were wi it was when they, they did all the
              boning in the shops and you could go, get good meaty bones and I
              used to
James (PS14C) [...]

Ann (PS14B)   [4661] and ... barley so, and
James (PS14C) [4662] Yeah I know.
Ann (PS14B)   [4663] and split peas.
              [4664] But er ... it was po possibly a healthier diet actually,
              than we have now.
Bill (PS15S)  [4665] Aye.
              [4666] Well of course, this is it, I mean you just
Ann (PS14B)   [4667] It was quite fat free anyway. [laugh]

              [...] and of course they delivered the [...] ... that you, I mean
              like we had dripping and bread.
James (PS14C) [4669] Oh yes!

Ann (PS14B)   [4676] Candleford and there they went ... breakfast was bread and
              dripping and
James (PS14C) [4677] Mm.
Bill (PS15S)  [4678] It used to taste nice.
James (PS14C) [4679] [laugh] ... Oh!
              [4680] I liked it.
Ann (PS14B)   [4681] I gave my, a
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4682] a few years ago when my sons were teenagers ... I had some
              nice dripping and I said, you've never had bread and dripping and
              I gave them some, I put a bit of salt on, I said, try this, I
              loved a bit of med bread and dripping when I was ... your age.
              [4683] And they took a mouthful and urgh!
              [4684] Urgh!
James (PS14C) [4685] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [4686] And we when ... how old were they when we went to Whitley
              for a holiday?
              [4687] And I saw some liquorice root ... and I said, oh!
              [4688] Look Jim
James (PS14C) [4689] Right.
Ann (PS14B)   [4690] I haven't seen that for years.
              [4691] I used to buy that for a ha'penny.
James (PS14C) [4692] During the war time
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4693] a ha'penny for two sticks.
              [4694] And I got them some of that, urgh urgh!
James (PS14C) [4695] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [4696] They thought it was horrible.
              [4697] So there was I walking round Whitley chewing this
              liquorice root.
Bill (PS15S)  [4698] Just look as if you were spitting tobacco. [laugh]
James (PS14C) [laugh]

James (PS14C) [laugh]
Bill (PS15S)  [4762] Mind you, I bet you don't touch peanut butter then?
Ann (PS14B)   [4763] Erm ... just very occasionally ... in the school holidays
Bill (PS15S)  [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [4764] erm ... at lunchtime I don't have many children at school
              holidays because ... apart from one of them, all of them have one
              or both parents who are teachers
Bill (PS15S)  [4765] Aha.
Ann (PS14B)   [4766] so I have Sally, and, and er, her mum always cooks a meal
              in the evening so I, I do something like toasted cheese
              sandwiches or beans on toast or something like that at lunch
              time, but there was one time when she wanted peanut butter ...
              and, all her brother used to ask, I, her brother doesn't come to
              me now, he stays at home cos he's going on fifteen, and as he's
              next door but one anyway, you know if, if anything goes wrong he
              can come along to me, but all he wanted was my homemade
              blackcurrant jam, and now he doesn't come any more I've got to
              actually give him
James (PS14C) [4767] Send some round.

              blackcurrant jam, jam to take home for him.

Ann (PS14B)   [4774] Oh I like, I qui I quite like making jam.
Bill (PS15S)  [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [4775] And it would be absolutely sacrilegious to, to ... buy hot
              cross buns. [walking out of room]
Bill (PS15S)  [4776] Oh well.
Ann (PS14B)   [4777] Yeah.

Bill (PS15S)  [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [4779] Oh.
              [4780] ... No there are certain things that I just couldn't do.
              [4781] I couldn't buy a Christmas pudding, and I couldn't buy a
              hot cross bun.
              [4782] It, I think it's too ingrained in me from my grandmother
              and my mother.
              [4783] You know, you made your Christmas puddings, everybody had
              to have a wish when they ... stirred them.
              [4784] I better see if this dinner's ready.
              [4785] Bye.
Bill (PS15S)  [4786] Bye.
*** 13 (Tape 069502) ***
Ann (PS14B)   [4787] Hey, you know, talking about the ducks on the river, you
              know that ... elderly, ever so refined lady
James (PS14C) [4788] Who brought bread to feed
Ann (PS14B)   [4789] Yes.
James (PS14C) [4790] the ducks?
              [4791] Yes.
              [4792] Yes well, that's right.
Ann (PS14B)   [4793] I think she must have been ... quite well off some time,
              had fallen on ... really hard times.
              [4794] I mean, she told me ... oh, a couple of years ago that she
              was eighty.
              [4795] And, I better get this dinner out.
              [4796] And erm ... she always thought of her husband as daddy.
James (PS14C) [4797] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)   [4798] And her daughter ... I think she must have been getting on
              because ... around the time she told me that she was eighty, she
              happened to mention that her daughter was forty.
James (PS14C) [4799] She had no grandchildren [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [4800] I know, her daughter, er her daughter's not married.
              [4801] Well I haven't seen her feeding the ducks ... for about
              three or four months.
              [4802] I wonder if she's died or she's ill?
James (PS14C) [4803] She's always going to jumble sales.
Ann (PS14B)   [4804] I know.
              [4805] All, all her clothes came from jumble sales.
              [4806] Everything.
              [4807] She wa she was buying, long after nylon shirts went out of
              fashion, there we there was a pile of nylon shirts, and she said
              I'm, I'm just looking to see if this ... if these will be
              suitable for daddy.
              [4808] I can't remember ... er, she gave me the reason why she
              wanted these for ... oh, he, he, he always wears his cuffs out or
              something.
              [4809] ... She was quite pleasant to talk to, I liked listening
              to her.
              [4810] I don't think I know her name.
              [4811] So, I couldn't even ask anyone.
*** 14 (Tape 069503) ***
Ann (PS14B)   [4812] Are you ready for your dinner?
              [4813] I've made the tea.
              [4814] ... I forgot to put those in the freezer.
              [4815] ... I think I'll do the bedrooms this afternoon.
James (PS14C) [4816] Especially Bry Bryony's bedroom.
              [4817] ... And those begonias are doing well now.
Ann (PS14B)   [4818] Which?
              [4819] Where?
              [4820] In the front room?
James (PS14C) [4821] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [4822] How many have grown?
James (PS14C) [4823] Er
Ann (PS14B)   [4824] Sometimes you look at them.
              [4825] ... It doesn't matter, you don't need to look.
              [4826] Get on with your dinner!
              [4827] You'll be late.
James (PS14C) [4828] Mm.
              [4829] ... There's four in the sitting room, there's one well
              advanced that's doi doing quite well, there's one upstairs that's
              just about ready for ... er, repotting, and there are ... two
              more that have sprouts on.
              [4830] Only [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [4831] So that's seven out of ten, was it?
James (PS14C) [4832] Oh yeah.
              [4833] Yeah.
              [4834] About seven.
Ann (PS14B)   [4835] Well that's not bad for one ninety nine.
              [4836] There's erm ... I know they'd be, probably be better
              quality ... but there are ... nine, I think it is, advertised in
              ... today's paper that say, erm for er eleven ninety nine.
              [4837] ... So even, we get ... seven for one ninety nine, it's a
              bargain.
James (PS14C) [4838] Depends what they flower like though.
Ann (PS14B)   [4839] I hope they're different colours.
James (PS14C) [4840] And how long they last.
              [4841] ... And if we
Ann (PS14B)   [4842] Well they go on flowering for quite, you you've got
James (PS14C) [4843] No, no, I mean, how long ... you put
Ann (PS14B)   [4844] Oh yeah, you'll have to le leave the children's.
James (PS14C) [4845] I know that.
              [4846] But ... if we keep them for the next ten years they're a
              ... a real bargain, if, if, if
Ann (PS14B)   [4847] Aha.
James (PS14C) [4848] they're all no good next year, well ... it'll be just a
              ... an ordinary bargain.
Ann (PS14B)   [4849] I don't think, I dunno ... that ... I wonder if we should
              put some gravel under that umb umbrella tree.
              [4850] ... Or if it should even be near that radiator.
              [4851] In Australia, you know they grow into great big huge trees
              in Australia, Mrs told me.
James (PS14C) [4852] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [4853] She said er, Derek ... has them in his garden.
James (PS14C) [4854] Well it's a bit better climate out there.
              [4855] Well I don't know if it's a better climate, but it's a
              warmer climate.
Ann (PS14B)   [4856] Well it must get hotter ... than it does in this house for
              a start!
James (PS14C) [4857] It is hotter.
Ann (PS14B)   [4858] I was freezing last night in bed!
              [4859] And you were snoring.
James (PS14C) [4860] So were you.
Ann (PS14B)   [4861] I hardly got any sleep last night, my head was aching so
              much.
James (PS14C) [4862] Well every night you do.
              [4863] Every night.
Ann (PS14B)   [4864] How can I, it, I was on my side.
James (PS14C) [4865] Well you still snore, er you snore on your side.
Ann (PS14B)   [4866] Ouch!
              [4867] Ooh they're hot!
James (PS14C) [4868] Have to close your mouth.
              [4869] It's a wonder you haven't got a sore throat all the time
              Ann.
Ann (PS14B)   [4870] How many staff have you got off?
James (PS14C) [4871] I'm not sure, everyone's off sick.
Ann (PS14B)   [4872] Mm.
              [4873] Will you be home late?
James (PS14C) [4874] I don't think so.
Ann (PS14B)   [4875] Mm.
              [4876] Have you checked the television pages?
              [4877] Is there any wildlife programmes or anything you want me
              to ... oh hold on, I've got it here.
              [4878] ... Er
James (PS14C) [4879] When's the Messiah on?
              [4880] That's on tomorrow isn't it?

              [4886] There's absolutely nothing on ... on Saturdays.
              [4887] I hate being here with ... on my own on a Saturday.
James (PS14C) [4888] Well you should save the programmes you recorded ... and
              watch them on a Saturday.
Ann (PS14B)   [4889] I haven't recorded any.
James (PS14C) [4890] Instead of

James (PS14C) [4892] wanting, get rid of them quickly.

              make any difference.

              hold ups last time we went down I quite like travelling ...

James (PS14C) [5036] Well I didn't care much for it.
              [5037] No.
Ann (PS14B)   [5038] Well they must be better for you than an animal fat.

Ann (PS14B)   [5057] the last ti what did I have to go for?
              [5058] ... The last time I went for a smear and ... a blood
              pressure check and various things sh I, I said ... are you doing
              cholesterol checks?
              [5059] And she said no.
              [5060] Would you like one?
              [5061] And I said, yes I would please.
              [5062] ... Anyway, I had to ring up after two week, can't you
              remember?
              [5063] I rang up after two weeks ... and I spoke to the nurse and
              she said, oh, your cholesterol's alright.

              [5065] And she said, oh well it's ... no it was the receptionist,
              she said it's fine.
              [5066] And I said, yes but I would like to know exactly ... what
              my cholesterol count is.
              [5067] So she said, oh I'll have to get the nurse.
              [5068] So the nurse came on the phone and she sa she said ... erm
              ... oh it's, it's fine it's well within the limits.
              [5069] And I said, but what is it?
              [5070] So she said it was ... five point ... four, or five point
              six I think it was.
              [5071] Why can't they just tell you?

Ann (PS14B)                [5130] Has she?
Betty (PS15U)              [5131] She's been quite ill.
                           [5132] She's not, she's had a kidney ... er, yes a
                           kidney infection.

                           [5143] Yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5144] Because they have qualified nurses
                           apparently.
Ann (PS14B)                [5145] Mm mm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5146] And erm
Ann (PS14B)                [5147] Would she agree to it?
Betty (PS15U)              [5148] Well he hasn't dared put it to her.

                           recovering now.
                           [5150] She'll say a few daft things like ... she
                           always says, how's my mother?
Ann (PS14B)                [5151] Oh!
                           [5152] But
Betty (PS15U)              [5153] And what does she think
Ann (PS14B)                [5154] Oh!
Betty (PS15U)              [5155] of this carry-on?
                           [5156] Well I mean her mother's been dead ... for, I
                           don't know how many years.
Ann (PS14B)                [5157] Well how old is she, eighty
Betty (PS15U)              [5158] She's eighty two.
Ann (PS14B)                [5159] eighty two.
Betty (PS15U)              [5160] That's what I said to her when she said it
                           the other day I said ... how old are you Mrs ?
                           [5161] She said ... eighty two.
                           [5162] I says, right.
                           [5163] How old would your mother be?
                           [5164] And I could see the ... wheels turning
Ann (PS14B)                [5165] Yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5166] round, see.
Ann (PS14B)                [cough]
Betty (PS15U)              [5167] Then Jimmy said ... well you know she's been
                           dead for ... many years ... and er ... she says, oh
                           that's right.
                           [5168] And she just sort of brushed it off.
                           [5169] And she'll say to Jimmy ... erm ... I don't
                           know how you're managing to look after yourself.
                           [5170] Who's getting your [laughing] meals [] ?
                           [5171] Well, of course Jimmy's got his own meals for
                           ... the whole of his life more
Ann (PS14B)                [5172] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5173] or less.
Ann (PS14B)                [5174] In fact, one of the nurses had said to Jim
                           last night ... your mum said ... er ... don't tell
                           my brother ... and then, then she said, your
                           brother?
                           [5175] Who, who is your brother?
                           [5176] She said, I don't, I mean, don't tell my son.
                           [5177] So well Jim said, well what is it?
                           [5178] She said I can't [laughing] tell you, I
                           haven't to tell you [] !
                           [5179] So he didn't know what she'd been up to.
Betty (PS15U)              [5180] [laugh] ... [laughing] Oh dear [] !
Ann (PS14B)                [5181] [laugh] ... Oh yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5182] Well the thing is, she's got nobody to talk
                           to there you see, she's in this little four bedder
Ann (PS14B)                [5183] Aha.
Betty (PS15U)              [5184] all the clo and like all closed off [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [5185] Mm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5186] and the lady ... opposite
Ann (PS14B)                [5187] I've never been in wo in er ... one or ...
                           two.
Betty (PS15U)              [5188] Two.
Ann (PS14B)                [5189] Two.
                           [5190] I've never been in ward two.
Betty (PS15U)              [5191] The lady opposite, erm ... has had a stroke
                           but she's not ... exactly ... and she's deaf
Ann (PS14B)                [5192] Oh yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5193] so she can't hear her.
                           [5194] Mrs can't get up to go over to her.
Ann (PS14B)                [5195] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5196] Now the lady in the bed diagonally, she, has
                           to be hoisted everywhere.
Ann (PS14B)                [5197] Oh!
Betty (PS15U)              [5198] I think she must have had a really bad
                           stroke.
                           [5199] Now she talks across to her, but she has a
                           bit of a ... ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, and it's
                           difficult
Ann (PS14B)                [5200] Mm.
                           [5201] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5202] to understand.
Ann (PS14B)                [5203] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5204] And the lady on the other bed ... beside her,
                           is erm ... she's very deaf.
                           [5205] So, the result is that, that she just ...
                           sits there or lies there
Ann (PS14B)                [5206] Mm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5207] she can't, she can't stand or anything.
Ann (PS14B)                [5208] Who's Mr got in with him?
                           [5209] Has he got

                           all men, and I, I, I speak to them, but I don't know
                           any of them er, personally.
                           [5215] Now, Mr ... pardon me.
                           [5216] He goes into his riding on Wednesday
Ann (PS14B)                [5217] Oh!
Betty (PS15U)              [5218] cos he showed me his calendar.

                           good.

Betty (PS15U)              [5221] Erm ... he forgets, he knows the word but he
                           can't get it

Betty (PS15U)              [5223] out.
Ann (PS14B)                [5224] Yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5225] And he was trying, he says I'm going to my
                           new home.

                           [5227] And he tried to er, to get it out and he
                           couldn't, then he pointed to the calendar

                           they did the alterations.

                           completely away somewhere, he was frightened he
                           didn't get back in after.
Ann (PS14B)                [5252] Yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5253] And, I think he just moved in to ... Muriel's
                           next door.

                           [5255] Yeah, that's right.
Betty (PS15U)              [5256] And he said well
Ann (PS14B)                [5257] He did.
Betty (PS15U)              [5258] erm, he wouldn't leave in case they wouldn't
                           let him back in after modernizing.
Ann (PS14B)                [5259] Yeah.

                           put it to her yet.
Ann (PS14B)                [5262] Is Doug ... going into the police ... or
                           applying?
Betty (PS15U)              [5263] Well he told me last year he'd applied.
Ann (PS14B)                [5264] I know.
                           [5265] He told me he applied but I thought he told
                           me he'd been turned down.
Betty (PS15U)              [5266] Well I never heard the ... well he had
                           applied once before ... and ... he ... he got as far
                           an interview and then he ... didn't get any further.
                           [5267] But then he applied just last summer for the
                           Metropolitan.
Ann (PS14B)                [5268] Yeah.

Ann (PS14B)                [5271] Marie ... Marie was going down to her
                           mother's ... she was running as usual, she dashed up
                           to our back door and said, is Doug around?
                           [5272] And I said, I don't know what shift he's on,
                           is his car out?
                           [5273] And it wasn't.
Betty (PS15U)              [5274] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5275] And I said do you want a piece of paper to
                           write him a message or something?
                           [5276] And she said, no it was just that ... he's
                           talking of renting his house ... erm ... and I know
                           of someone who wants to rent one.
Betty (PS15U)              [5277] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)                [5278] So I said well where's Doug going?
                           [5279] Then she said something about ... June ...
                           and the Met.
Betty (PS15U)              [5280] Oh well Doug wasn't here again, he never
                           mentioned it.
Ann (PS14B)                [5281] Or did she say he's going for an interview in
                           ... June for the Met, or something, anyway.
Betty (PS15U)              [5282] Well he's not
Ann (PS14B)                [5283] Cos I, I haven't seen him at all.
Betty (PS15U)              [5284] I walked up ... from the woods with him, came

Ann (PS14B)                [5285] Mm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5286] together, he never mentioned it.
Ann (PS14B)                [5287] In fact, I thought it must be all finished
                           with because ... he, he was quite talkative about it
                           during the summer
Betty (PS15U)              [5288] Yes.

Ann (PS14B)                [5290] then I, and he said to me about
Betty (PS15U)              [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [5291] being turned down.
Betty (PS15U)              [5292] Oh!
                           [5293] Cos he hoped, if he got into the Met ... and
                           then he transfer ... up here.
Ann (PS14B)                [5294] Oh!

Ann (PS14B)                [5296] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5297] I mean he started off in the Met ... er ...
                           did his training and everything ... and then I think
                           he's up here somewhere now.
Ann (PS14B)                [5298] I tell you someone ... erm ... our boiler

                           came through
Betty (PS15U)              [5301] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5302] it must have been Thursday because I didn't
                           want him to come, I said to Jim, tell him not to
                           come we'll just turn the whole lot off.
                           [5303] But the kitchen was reeking ... of
Betty (PS15U)              [5304] mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5305] fumes!

                           nose and my throat
Betty (PS15U)              [5309] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5310] and ... and my eyes started to water
Betty (PS15U)              [5311] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5312] I opened the windows.
                           [5313] Oh!
                           [5314] And there was ... when it came on, in the
                           afternoon there was this tremendous ... very loud
                           roar!
                           [5315] Now, it sometimes goes ... whoosh!
Betty (PS15U)              [5316] Yes.
                           [5317] When they
Ann (PS14B)                [5318] It comes on initially
Betty (PS15U)              [5319] Yes.
                           [5320] And dies down.
Ann (PS14B)                [5321] and it immediately dies down and then it's
                           okay, but there was this tremendous roar ... and a
                           loud click and it went out.
                           [5322] And it was only about ... we i it was wi
                           within a couple of minutes, or, probably less ...
                           Jim came in ... er ... I think he was, I don't know
                           where he'd been cos his day off was Thursday I
                           think.
                           [5323] Yes he was.
                           [5324] And ... I told him about it, and he said oh
                           yes, the pilot light has gone out ... and he relit
                           it.
                           [5325] And it was fine.
                           [5326] It sounded okay ... but we kept getting these
                           fumes.
                           [5327] So we kept opening the door ... it blew out
                           once again and he put it on again ... and we were
                           still getting these fumes till about ... oh ...
                           about half past five it seemed to stop,u we had the
                           windows open.
Betty (PS15U)              [5328] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5329] And then ... Raymond phoned at about quarter
                           to seven.
                           [5330] No.
                           [5331] He didn't.
                           [5332] Sorry!
                           [5333] Sorry!
                           [5334] It we he phoned at ... it was, it was five to
                           six, Jim was going to take me to aerobics because of
                           the weather
Betty (PS15U)              [5335] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5336] I had my wellies in case the leisure centre
                           was flooded!
Betty (PS15U)              [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                [5337] Ha.
                           [5338] There was only ten of us there.
                           [5339] Anyway, erm ... Raymond was on the phone
                           because he was tal and I was saying to Jim ... tell
                           him I don't want him to come if the ra if the road's
                           cut off to Blythe I don't want him to get stuck, I
                           mean, he's got a wife
Betty (PS15U)              [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [5340] and two small children at home.
                           [5341] And I'm saying, it's time I was out, I'm
                           gonna be [laughing] late [] .
                           [5342] Anyway, he insisted he was coming at half
                           past seven.
                           [5343] And he came at half past seven and he cleaned
                           it and he looked at it, and he said er ... it wasn't
                           ... anything that he could see, he thinks it was
                           just down draught, but we've had winds before.
                           [5344] And he said that ... the cowl ... we've got
                           on that chimney
Betty (PS15U)              [5345] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5346] off the kitchen and ru and runs the boiler,
                           he said it's the best kind you can get, nothing
                           should come in there.
                           [5347] And as he's driven up at the back then he
                           looked up and he said ... you ca you could see
                           daylight through it so it was, wasn't blocked by
                           anything.
Betty (PS15U)              [5348] Wasn't blocked.
Ann (PS14B)                [5349] Erm ... but he said
Betty (PS15U)              [5350] D'ya think it was the rain, maybe?
Ann (PS14B)                [5351] I don't know.
Betty (PS15U)              [5352] Driving wind?
Ann (PS14B)                [5353] I said could it have been continuous rain?
                           [5354] And he said something about ... he'd once ...
                           they'd once had to work ... all one day and all one
                           night a near the Regent [...] Centre ... because ...
                           er, something had gone wrong with the ... gas pipes
                           because erm of flooding.
Betty (PS15U)              [5355] Oh!
                           [5356] Right.
Ann (PS14B)                [5357] So whether we've ... but nobody else seems to
                           have noticed anything like this.
Betty (PS15U)              [5358] No, I, I haven't had anything like that.
Ann (PS14B)                [5359] Anyway, he couldn't find anything.
                           [5360] He said, we'll just have to ... leave it ...
                           and, if it happens again we'll have to go into it
                           further, but it hasn't happened again, so now it's
                           okay.
Betty (PS15U)              [5361] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5362] Except last night ... I thought ... what on
                           earth's this?
                           [5363] It just smelt like Christmas cake cooking,
                           and I wasn't cooking anything at all.
                           [5364] I mean ... Jim went to work at one o'clock
                           and the last of the kids ... went home, I've had my
                           dinner
Betty (PS15U)              [5365] Perhaps something's melting then.
Ann (PS14B)                [5366] at midday.
                           [5367] But i it was no, it was no stronger in the
                           kitchen than the living room.
Betty (PS15U)              [5368] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5369] I sniffed around the boiler, I sniffed around
                           the cooker
Betty (PS15U)              [laugh] [...]
Ann (PS14B)                [5370] ah, but ... when the kids went home I just
                           had ... ha I had a sandwich.
Betty (PS15U)              [5371] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5372] That's all I had, I hadn't cooked anything.
Betty (PS15U)              [5373] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5374] Erm ... the triplets had ... soup ... and
                           stottie and I warmed that up in the microwave.
Betty (PS15U)              [5375] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5376] And this smell lasted for about half an hour
                           and then, then I couldn't smell it again.
Betty (PS15U)              [5377] And it disappeared?
                           [5378] It's, what kind of boiler is that you have?
Ann (PS14B)                [5379] Er ... ooh!
                           [5380] ... I can't remember the make.
                           [5381] It's one of these that uses less fuel.
                           [5382] More efficient.
                           [5383] Well we've had it, how long have we had it?
                           [5384] About ... three, four years.
                           [5385] Anyway, how are the
Betty (PS15U)              [5386] Well you've had a lo bother with it though
                           haven't you?

Betty (PS15U)              [5388] Well about two or three
Ann (PS14B)                [5389] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5390] haven't you?
Ann (PS14B)                [5391] Th the shelf ... with ... containers on have
                           been too close, you know those Tupperware
                           containers?
Betty (PS15U)              [5392] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5393] Have been too close to it ... and it had, and
                           the vents at the back had got churned up with dust
                           at one time, I keep dusting it now.
Betty (PS15U)              [5394] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)                [5395] Anyway, while I go Ra Raymond was here, he
                           says, oh Alan's back.
                           [5396] And they said, well where from?
                           [5397] He said well he's got a transfer to
                           Accrington.
                           [5398] Didn't you know he was in the prison service?
Betty (PS15U)              [5399] Is that
Ann (PS14B)                [5400] I didn't

Ann (PS14B)                [5406] And he had to go and train somewhere down
                           south, but he's got a ... he, apparently he'd been
                           trying for a year and he's got to Accrington.
Betty (PS15U)              [5407] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)                [5408] Cos I thought he was doing pretty well in the
                           Post Office, he was
Betty (PS15U)              [5409] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5410] he was getting promotion.
Betty (PS15U)              [5411] Once you see th there's gonna be changes
                           there possibly.
Ann (PS14B)                [5412] Oh!

                           going to be late, if he's anywhere ... reasonable
Ann (PS14B)                [5454] Yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5455] and finds a phone he rings and tells her.
                           [5456] Erm, because I was going out for half past
                           two and er, she rang, she says he hasn't rung yet so
                           I assume he's going to be home.

                           to her other than to say hello.
                           [5461] Dorothy and I took the triplets for their

                           knee on the floor for a short while.
Betty (PS15U)              [5468] Mm.

Ann (PS14B)                [5471] and one sitting on the other chair arm
Betty (PS15U)              [5472] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5473] so that they can all see the pictures.
Betty (PS15U)              [5474] All see the book.
                           [5475] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5476] So, they couldn't get it into their heads
                           that you had to sit on the floor.
Betty (PS15U)              [5477] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5478] Mind, when I read their story on erm ... I
                           read them on Thursday afternoon and I said, right we
                           better practise for nursery
Betty (PS15U)              [5479] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5480] so I had the older ones from Goose Hill
Betty (PS15U)              [5481] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5482] you know the ... when they were off school
Betty (PS15U)              [5483] That's right.
Ann (PS14B)                [5484] and I sat them [laughing] on the floor []
Betty (PS15U)              [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                [5485] and they sat and listened then.
Betty (PS15U)              [5486] How old are the triplets?
Ann (PS14B)                [5487] They're three on the nineteenth.
Betty (PS15U)              [5488] Ah!
                           [5489] Right.
Ann (PS14B)                [5490] And, the other thing ... it took a while for
                           u for us to get them to, they'd never drunk milk out
                           of a straw, through a straw
Betty (PS15U)              [5491] [laughing] Oh yes [] .
Ann (PS14B)                [5492] and a third of a pint bottle is too big.
Betty (PS15U)              [5493] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5494] I only give them half that much at a time.
Betty (PS15U)              [5495] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5496] Bryony especially tends to drink small
                           amounts.
Betty (PS15U)              [5497] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5498] But you leave the cup on the table and she'll
                           call you back every ten
Betty (PS15U)              [5499] She keeps going back.
Ann (PS14B)                [5500] minutes for a sip.
Betty (PS15U)              [5501] Yes.
                           [5502] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5503] But of course, they were picking the bottle
                           up and they were trying to tip it as well .
Betty (PS15U)              [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                [5504] So I'll have to get some straws and we'll
                           have to practise
Betty (PS15U)              [5505] [laughing] Yeah [] !
Ann (PS14B)                [5506] that.
Betty (PS15U)              [5507] [laugh] ... Aren't they bent straws or not?
Ann (PS14B)                [5508] No, this, they're quite, they didn't ... th
                           they were quite tough
Betty (PS15U)              [5509] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5510] strong plastic ones so they ... they didn't
                           chew
Betty (PS15U)              [5511] They'll soon
Ann (PS14B)                [5512] they didn't chew them.
Betty (PS15U)              [5513] they'll soon fit in.
Ann (PS14B)                [5514] And er
Betty (PS15U)              [5515] Cos Stephanie will
Ann (PS14B)                [5516] I know.
Betty (PS15U)              [5517] be there.
                           [5518] Was it morning?
Ann (PS14B)                [5519] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5520] Ah, Jenny will be meeting Stephanie.
Ann (PS14B)                [5521] Yes, well when we came out ... Bryony was
                           difficult to start with, she didn't want her coat
                           on.
Betty (PS15U)              [5522] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5523] But Richard ... I was trying to get his on a
                           and I, I've, I've helped two other children to put
                           theirs on, I don't know who they were, and Dorothy
                           says, oh we better get out Ann the teacher wanted
                           the ... the visitors
Betty (PS15U)              [5524] Away.
Ann (PS14B)                [5525] to get out before
Betty (PS15U)              [5526] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5527] the others came.
                           [5528] Well, we just got out into the hallway where
                           all these mothers were standing round ... and
Betty (PS15U)              [5529] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5530] Richard threw himself on the floor screaming!
Betty (PS15U)              [5531] Ee!
Ann (PS14B)                [5532] He wasn't going home.
Betty (PS15U)              [5533] Oh dear!
Ann (PS14B)                [5534] And I was try and he,he of course he's, he's
                           heavy
Betty (PS15U)              [5535] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5536] and when he just makes himself flop, he
                           wouldn't stand up.
                           [5537] When I tried to sit him up
Betty (PS15U)              [5538] Pick him up.
Ann (PS14B)                [5539] to put his coat on, I picked him up and tried
                           to carry him, and he just flung himself around so
                           hard I had to put him down and he immediately flung
                           himself on the floor again!
Betty (PS15U)              [5540] Oh!
                           [5541] Lovely [laughing] exhibition [] .

                           [5544] Anyway
Betty (PS15U)              [5545] And was it because he didn't want to leave?
Ann (PS14B)                [5546] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                [5547] Oh!
                           [5548] He was staying there.
                           [5549] And we I was ... I was trying to explain to
                           him that erm ... we've had to go home, the teachers
                           were clearing everything up
Betty (PS15U)              [5550] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5551] all the children were going home
Betty (PS15U)              [5552] For lunchtime.
Ann (PS14B)                [5553] because there were different children coming
                           in the afternoon.
Betty (PS15U)              [5554] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5555] But no, no.
Betty (PS15U)              [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                [5556] So I picked him up and I carried him, Dorothy
                           had gone out the wrong door, instead of going out
                           the door at that end ... she'd gone right along this
                           long corridor
Betty (PS15U)              [5557] And come out the main door.
Ann (PS14B)                [5558] so I followed her and of course, we're going
                           past all the blooming classrooms!
                           [5559] And the
Betty (PS15U)              [5560] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5561] classrooms all had their doors open.
Betty (PS15U)              [5562] Yeah.
                           [5563] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5564] And ... anyway I carried him half way along
                           and I had to put him down
Betty (PS15U)              [5565] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5566] I managed to get his coat on ... and a woman
                           came along, I, I don't know if she was a dinner lady
                           or what, she had a ... a sort of overall on ... and
                           er ... I said come on let's catch up with your
                           mummy, and she said, ah!

                           [5573] Aha.
Ann (PS14B)                [5574] And I said yes.
                           [5575] And she said, oh Mr teaches ... my son at
                           school.

Ann (PS14B)                [5577] She said, come along hold my hand as well and

                           took me to the door.
                           [5578] So he shut up
Betty (PS15U)              [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                [5579] and listened to her.
Betty (PS15U)              [5580] [laugh] ... Oh!
Ann (PS14B)                [5581] He'd calmed down tha
Betty (PS15U)              [5582] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5583] by then.
Betty (PS15U)              [5584] Well I had trouble
Ann (PS14B)                [...]
Betty (PS15U)              [5585] with Joshua on erm ... what day will it be?
                           [5586] ... Erm ... it must have been the last day,
                           it must have been Friday, must have been Friday.
                           [5587] Cos usually, he's keen to go to Ron and
                           Stephanie's.
Ann (PS14B)                [5588] Mhm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5589] He wouldn't get in his pushchair.
                           [5590] He wouldn't put his coat on.
                           [5591] Erm ... I finally got his coat on, and then,
                           I said, come on we'll walk.
                           [5592] No.
                           [5593] No.
                           [5594] And chuck his hat down on the kitchen floor.
                           [5595] I said, well I'd have to go and leave you
                           then.
                           [5596] So, of course, he got up, I went to close the
                           door ... he was there ... so ... I tried him in his
                           pushchair, I says well you'll have to walk, I know
                           it's only five minutes away.
                           [5597] So
Ann (PS14B)                [5598] Mhm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5599] it was a bad day.
                           [5600] So er ... he wouldn't move!
                           [5601] Got so far on, he stood and he started crying
                           and yelling and, don't want to go!
                           [5602] Want to go home!
                           [5603] Don't want to go!
                           [5604] Now I used to get him along there ... and ...
                           then he was sort of in tears but there was ... kids
                           in the hall, the little hall ... and then when you
                           sort come in the door, not the main door, the one,
                           the

Betty (PS15U)              [5606] door you're supposed to come in.

Ann (PS14B)                [5609] and come out of?
Betty (PS15U)              [5610] Well, immediately on the left there's a door
                           ... an and the hall goes along by the path that you,
                           you come up to that door.
Ann (PS14B)                [5611] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5612] And, the children were in there erm doing
                           their P E and er ... he went stood at the door and
                           watched them and he was ... quite happy.
                           [5613] And, they all filed out ... and the ... the
                           caretaker, I presume, started putting the tables up,
                           and the chairs for lunch
Ann (PS14B)                [5614] Mhm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5615] and er ... he wouldn't keep out, so, so in
                           the end the caretaker got him a little chair
Ann (PS14B)                [5616] Mhm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5617] and ... sat him against the wall.

Betty (PS15U)              [5618] He said that's your chair, now ... you can

                           [5619] Well he sat there as good as gold.
                           [5620] The only trouble was when Stephanie come out

                           the, er I think she said bogeys or something?
                           [5683] Because when Gillian came home, Gillian says
                           who were you playing with?
                           [5684] And she said Melanie.
                           [5685] And, but she says it wasn't deliberate, it
                           wasn't deliberate, it was an accident.
                           [5686] So Gillian had seen the teacher
Ann (PS14B)                [5687] Still around?

                           er, they'll stop anywhere.

                           [5773] But, I've had them on buses several times
                           just when I, when I'm going on a bus.
Betty (PS15U)              [5774] Well now the occasions

                           times a week on a bus will it [] ?

                           Gillian's on ... doing the manager's job which is
                           nearly twice a, twice a year.

                           brings Joshua down here for about quarter to nine,
                           then she goes back up to Stop Hill with the girls
Ann (PS14B)                [5785] Mm.

Ann (PS14B)                [5787] Mhm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5788] And then Paul takes me ... up to their house
                           ... where I, usually about ten past eleven ... gives

Ann (PS14B)                [laugh]
Betty (PS15U)              [5789] [laugh] ... sorted out ... and then I just
                           walk along and pick up Stephanie.

                           when I can give you a lift up ... but the they'll be
                           very odd.
Ann (PS14B)                [5791] Yeah.
Betty (PS15U)              [5792] They'll be very odd.
                           [5793] And then I stay there you see.
Ann (PS14B)                [5794] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5795] I stay there then.

                           manager's shift.
Ann (PS14B)                [5798] Aha.
Betty (PS15U)              [5799] Five.
                           [5800] So erm ... but that's only about three times
                           a year at the most.
Ann (PS14B)                [5801] Yeah.

Betty (PS15U)              [5803] No, well I, I tend to keep away at nights
                           when I, cos I think erm, those triplets so you must
                           be
Ann (PS14B)                [laugh]
Betty (PS15U)              [5804] absolutely worn out and ready for peace and
                           quiet.
                           [5805] Cos I know what it is myself with ... I mean,

                           ... but it's wearing.

                           go, when they've gone home and I've tidied up a bit
Betty (PS15U)              [5809] Mhm.

Betty (PS15U)              [5811] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5812] I feel quite fit by the time I get back, you

Ann (PS14B)                [5815] But I'm not.

Betty (PS15U)              [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                [5819] hungry by then.
Betty (PS15U)              [5820] Well I, when I come back from Stop Hill when
                           I've been on a long shift till five o'clock, I'm
                           whacked because ... their bungalow is so warm
Ann (PS14B)                [5821] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5822] and it, really it drains.
Ann (PS14B)                [5823] Mm.
                           [5824] It's like Jim at work he's shattered when he
                           comes in.
Betty (PS15U)              [5825] Ee!
                           [5826] I come here
Ann (PS14B)                [...]
Betty (PS15U)              [5827] I sit down, I yawn and it comes to bedtime
                           and I'm really too tired to go up the stairs.
Ann (PS14B)                [5828] Mm.
Betty (PS15U)              [5829] I feel absolutely, and I think thank goodness
                           I'm back [laughing] in my draughty old house [] !
Ann (PS14B)                [laugh]
Betty (PS15U)              [5830] [laugh] ... Wha ... oh dear!
Ann (PS14B)                [5831] I never feel cold in your house.
Betty (PS15U)              [5832] Well, it's alright if, you know, if you're in
                           a room where the fire's on, although I have had the
                           heating on ... erm ... a few days recently because
                           of the cold.
                           [5833] But I was hoping it was off for good er ...
                           but it didn't work out that way cos of the weather.
                           [5834] Erm ... I thought I'll try and save a bit of
                           gas ... this month.
                           [5835] This quarter.
                           [5836] But erm ... and I, I got my er microwave and
                           I'm trying to save some electric.
                           [5837] I've been doing most of my ... cooking with
                           the
Ann (PS14B)                [5838] Aha.
Betty (PS15U)              [5839] rather than putting a big oven on.
Ann (PS14B)                [5840] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5841] And if ... some, er,jus it was very thin
                           slices of beef, topside of ... well I thought I'll
                           get some beef out, and I did it in the microwave and
                           it cooked ... but it was ... it was quite tough.
                           [5842] I think if I'd had er ... no teeth I wouldn't
                           have been able to manage at all, or if I had
Ann (PS14B)                [5843] You might have slightly overcooked it.
Betty (PS15U)              [5844] That's what he said.
Ann (PS14B)                [5845] It's, you tend, to start with you do tend to
                           erm
Betty (PS15U)              [5846] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5847] overcook things.
Betty (PS15U)              [5848] Yeah.
                           [5849] Well it ... there wasn't a recipe to cover
                           just what I was doing with the
Ann (PS14B)                [5850] I know i i it
Betty (PS15U)              [5851] and it was just a case of ... erm ... pot
                           luck, I would sort of brought it out and looked at
                           it and, er no it wasn't cooked, it was cooked on the
                           edges so I turned it over and ... turned it round
                           and put it back in again.
Ann (PS14B)                [5852] Did you let it stand?
Betty (PS15U)              [5853] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5854] For a while after?
Betty (PS15U)              [5855] Yes.
                           [5856] Yes.
                           [5857] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5858] Before it carries on.
Betty (PS15U)              [5859] Er it was
Ann (PS14B)                [5860] It's like when you cook
Betty (PS15U)              [5861] it was cooked
Ann (PS14B)                [5862] cakes they look as if they're not quite
                           cooked
Betty (PS15U)              [5863] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5864] but by the time they've stood for five
                           minutes they are.
Betty (PS15U)              [5865] Well
Ann (PS14B)                [5866] Did you remember if you cook a cake and you
                           put a piece of erm ... kitchen paper over the top
Betty (PS15U)              [5867] Mhm.
                           [5868] I don't.
Ann (PS14B)                [5869] Oh.
                           [5870] I, I can't remember where I got, I remember
                           telling ... Beryl that a long
Betty (PS15U)              [5871] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)                [5872] time ago
Betty (PS15U)              [5873] Right.
                           [5874] Well I
Ann (PS14B)                [5875] well before she knows
Betty (PS15U)              [5876] well I've cooked a
Ann (PS14B)                [5877] Someone who told me roundabout that
Betty (PS15U)              [5878] a cake recipe
Ann (PS14B)                [5879] time.
                           [5880] The other thing is ... yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5881] but it was, to me, it was more like a erm ...
                           er, er a sponge ... erm ... like a pudding sponge.
Ann (PS14B)                [5882] Yes.
                           [5883] What
Betty (PS15U)              [5884] Er
Ann (PS14B)                [5885] kind of a cake did you make?
Betty (PS15U)              [5886] It was just a plain erm ... Victoria
Ann (PS14B)                [5887] Oh.
Betty (PS15U)              [5888] sponge recipe.
Ann (PS14B)                [5889] Chocolate cakes are, are very nice if
Betty (PS15U)              [5890] But I didn't have a proper tin.
Ann (PS14B)                [5891] you do, brown, but use brown sugar.
Betty (PS15U)              [5892] Yes.
                           [5893] I made a pudding actually
Ann (PS14B)                [5894] And u and dark brown
Betty (PS15U)              [5895] A pudding.
Ann (PS14B)                [5896] sugar.
                           [5897] I that's nice and
Betty (PS15U)              [5898] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5899] moist.
                           [5900] But ... when you, when you time ... when the
                           cooked cake's finished cooking
Betty (PS15U)              [5901] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5902] if you leave it for two minutes
Betty (PS15U)              [5903] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5904] run a knife round
Betty (PS15U)              [5905] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5906] tip it up onto your hand, just briefly
Betty (PS15U)              [5907] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5908] just for a second, and then
Betty (PS15U)              [5909] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5910] back a again.
Betty (PS15U)              [5911] Yes I did.
Ann (PS14B)                [5912] Let's the air go, and get underneath
Betty (PS15U)              [5913] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                [5914] and that helps the bottom to dry out quicker.
Betty (PS15U)              [5915] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5916] Now ... someone else told me, and it worked,
                           and if you just lay a piece of kitchen paper over
                           the top, that absorbs some of the moisture
Betty (PS15U)              [5917] The moisture.
Ann (PS14B)                [5918] as well and ta and the top isn't so soggy.
Betty (PS15U)              [5919] Mm.
                           [5920] Well I didn't have
Ann (PS14B)                [5921] But chocolate cakes are definitely the best.
Betty (PS15U)              [5922] Well I did a chocolate pudding
Ann (PS14B)                [5923] In the microwave.
Betty (PS15U)              [5924] and it was lovely.
                           [5925] Erm
Ann (PS14B)                [5926] Yes.
Betty (PS15U)              [5927] but this ... cake that I made ... erm ... we
                           thought was more like a ... a pudding ... and I
Ann (PS14B)                [5928] Yeah but they're so
Betty (PS15U)              [5929] put jam on it
Ann (PS14B)                [5930] they're so pale as well.
Betty (PS15U)              [5931] and the next day it, it was ... sort o like a
                           rock, well not
Ann (PS14B)                [5932] The o
Betty (PS15U)              [5933] exactly, but it was pretty
Ann (PS14B)                [5934] the only cakes I make in erm ... in a
                           microwave are ... chocolate cakes
Betty (PS15U)              [5935] And are they alright the next day?
Ann (PS14B)                [5936] Yes.
                           [5937] They're a lot moister if you, if you use dark
                           brown sugar
Betty (PS15U)              [5938] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [5939] they definitely are a lot more moist.
Betty (PS15U)              [5940] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5941] And as long as you don't over, overcook them.
Betty (PS15U)              [5942] Mm.
                           [5943] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)                [5944] And I'll tell you what I always do.
Betty (PS15U)              [5945] But what, what do you make them in?
                           [5946] Er, like a, a deep er flan, erm
Ann (PS14B)                [5947] I've got these, you know the very thin
                           microwave dishes?
                           [5948] They're getting a bit battered now.
Betty (PS15U)              [5949] Plastic?
Ann (PS14B)                [5950] They're very thin plastic.
Betty (PS15U)              [5951] No.
                           [5952] I haven't got
Ann (PS14B)                [5953] They're about
Betty (PS15U)              [5954] any plastic ones.
Ann (PS14B)                [5955] Th I got them in the electricity board, there

Betty (PS15U)              [6207] couple of nights later, I looked down and
                           here's three of them, boy, somebody else ... and

                           so I banged on the window and said get off the

                           they all were giggling at me.
                           [6213] See, so I went out ... I said, get off my
                           property you're trespassing!
Ann (PS14B)                [laugh]
Betty (PS15U)              [6214] I said, that is my property and when you sit
                           on my fence ... that is a, an offence!
                           [6215] Now, I says I'll get the police the next

                           tell your father that I want it paid for this time

               hole in the step underneath the ... the door hinge.
Jackie (PS166) [6301] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)    [6302] And er ... James, triplet ... he's pres er ... pushing
               bits of paper and ... I should imagine there's pens and crayons
               and all kinds down there.
Jackie (PS166) [6303] The only thing you could do is get the, you know that
               kind of plastic edging you can get for ... wall tiles
Ann (PS14B)    [6304] Yeah.
Jackie (PS166) [6305] with curved ... put a bit of that in.
               [6306] That
Ann (PS14B)    [6307] Yeah.
Jackie (PS166) [6308] would take the raw, the raw edge off.
Ann (PS14B)    [6309] Aha.
Jackie (PS166) [6310] It will curve it down.
Ann (PS14B)    [6311] You can get them in the square ones, the six by six, but
               I wa I wanted ... the way we worked it out, eight by four would
               work out more economical.
Jackie (PS166) [6312] Aha.
Ann (PS14B)    [6313] Cos eventually, I wouldn't mind the kitchen having quarry
               qua quarry tiles.
Jackie (PS166) [6314] No I don't like them.
Ann (PS14B)    [6315] I like quarry tiles.
               [6316] ... Right.
Jackie (PS166) [6317] See ya!
               [6318] I, the, I wonder it's for?
Ann (PS14B)    [6319] I don't know, it's been, I went [laughing] along to ask
               Betty and Paul if they knew [] .
               [6320] It's been there since ... before half past one I think.
               [6321] I was putting the washing on at the back and I saw the en
               the bit sticking past the house.
Jackie (PS166) [6322] It's that fella ... the ... probably going to a wedding.
Ann (PS14B)    [6323] I think it must be a, I think it must
Jackie (PS166) [6324] He's got it
Ann (PS14B)    [6325] be a driver.
               [6326] He can't, he can't be actually at a wedding because
Jackie (PS166) [6327] She can just pretend it's her new car.
Ann (PS14B)    [6328] [laugh] .
               [6329] Oh yes!
Jackie (PS166) [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)    [6330] We can dream!
Jackie (PS166) [6331] Bye.
*** 17 (Tape 069702) ***
Ann (PS14B)   [6332] Hello.
James (PS14C) [6333] Why's the door off the latch?
Ann (PS14B)   [6334] Oh!
              [6335] Oh!
              [6336] Mm.
              [6337] I know what it was ... erm ... the Empire Stores' man ...
              brought a parcel for Jackie when she was out ... and when
James (PS14C) [6338] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [6339] I took it along ... to her, to save me locking myself out
              I put the sneck up.
              [6340] I must have forgotten to put it down when I came in again.
James (PS14C) [6341] Well I'd better go and lock the door.
Ann (PS14B)   [6342] That was hours ago.
James (PS14C) [6343] Didn't know if you were in or not.
Ann (PS14B)   [6344] Well I'd hardly be out if the door wasn't ... locked when
              it's dark.
James (PS14C) [6345] Yes, but it seemed so odd that the door was standing open.
Ann (PS14B)   [6346] Ooh!
James (PS14C) [6347] And there was
Ann (PS14B)   [6348] Was the inside door closed?
James (PS14C) [6349] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [6350] Mm.
James (PS14C) [6351] The inside door was closed.

James (PS14C) [6355] No.
              [6356] No, no cats could get in.
              [6357] [sighing] Oh [] !
Ann (PS14B)   [6358] Have you had a good day?
James (PS14C) [6359] Well it, it depends what you mean by a good day?
              [6360] It's tiring.
              [6361] [yawning] Heavy [] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6362] Why?
              [6363] Did you ... have any deaths?
James (PS14C) [6364] No, no deaths thank goodness.
              [6365] There's a lot of poorly people I'm afraid.
Ann (PS14B)   [6366] Oh.
James (PS14C) [6367] But they're all alright tonight.
              [6368] Not expecting any deaths yet.
              [6369] Yet.

James (PS14C) [6374] Thank you.
Ann (PS14B)   [6375] Are you hungry?
James (PS14C) [6376] A bit.
              [6377] Alright.
Ann (PS14B)   [6378] Well it's now, I'll just warm it up.
              [6379] Okay?
James (PS14C) [6380] Thank you.
              [6381] Yes.
              [6382] [sighing] Ah [] !
              [6383] ... Was Jackie in?
              [6384] And so you took the parcel?
Ann (PS14B)   [6385] Yes.
James (PS14C) [6386] And she gets any, a lot of parcels that woman.
              [6387] She must be the best, one of the best customers they've,
              she, they've got.
Ann (PS14B)   [6388] Yes, but she's got all the erm ... she's got hundreds of

              she works in ... huge offices doesn't she?
James (PS14C) [6389] Yes.
              [6390] It's the biggest ... erm ... fraud er o well civil service
              outside London.
Ann (PS14B)   [6391] Yeah.
              [6392] ... Right.
              [6393] ... There was erm ... what I thought was a, a white Rolls
              ... parked outside our house when I was putting the washing on
              the line ... just after you went to work.
              [6394] ... Erm ... well ... I've gotta wash the dishes.
              [6395] I was with, and it was, I could see it at the front.
James (PS14C) [6396] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)   [6397] Er, it turned out it wasn't a Rolls it was a Bentley, but
              I don't know one car from
James (PS14C) [6398] Oh yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [6399] another.
              [6400] A
James (PS14C) [6401] It's still a rather ... classy car.
Ann (PS14B)   [6402] Yes.
              [6403] Well it looked like a wedding car cos there were bouquets
              in the back.
James (PS14C) [6404] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)   [6405] And, Paul was working on his car out the front ... and I
              went to ask him if he knew who was getting married.
              [6406] And er ... he said it had been standing there for quite a
              while.
              [6407] He thought it was ... maybe just ... er ... the driver had
              taken someone to the church ... was waiting to go back for them.
              [6408] And er ... Betty called me in for a cup of coffee but ...
              [clears throat] ... and I was there, I think, for over two hours.
James (PS14C) [6409] Tt.
Ann (PS14B)   [6410] I didn't mean to stay that long ... cos I had a lot to do.
              [6411] Anyway, it was, it was still there

James (PS14C) [6436] I suppose it is.
              [6437] I don't know if it is.
Ann (PS14B)   [6438] Well the back wall looks wet.
James (PS14C) [6439] Well th there was no rain on it when I came ... came here.
              [6440] Must have su must have suddenly started.
Ann (PS14B)   [6441] It is raining.

James (PS14C) [6445] Well these poor blighters who got flooded ... who ...
              could do with the wind to dry the houses out couldn't they?
Ann (PS14B)   [6446] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [6447] The er ...
Ann (PS14B)   [6448] The what?
James (PS14C) [6449] I delivered those leaflets this morning ... in Auburn
              Place ... the house at the end
Ann (PS14B)   [6450] Which one?
James (PS14C) [6451] the one that was flooded, the one that was
Ann (PS14B)   [6452] The one facing onto the bridge?
James (PS14C) [6453] Yes.
              [6454] That er ... Tess bought ... and they did it all up.
              [6455] When they told me at work she'd bought that, I was, cos
              they lived up at Green Lane ... I thought my God he'd have ...
              they've picked a ... a bad spot there cos there's no flood
              protection at all there.
              [6456] And in fact, when the river rises they ... it drops down
              onto that house, and the house next door.
              [6457] Anyway, I saw that everything was up, the doors, the back
              door was open, the front door was open ... there was everything
              up from downstairs and ... must be awful.
Ann (PS14B)   [6458] Well I saw the curtains were down ... erm ... when I took
              ... the triplets
James (PS14C) [cough]
Ann (PS14B)   [6459] all around there yesterday, the curtains were down and it
              looked as if there was ... a table piled up with cardboard boxes
              in the, in the front window.
James (PS14C) [6460] There was.
              [6461] Well there's, it was er ... there was a table.
              [6462] And a house further along ... in ... Abbey View there ...
              cos i and it was four houses actually in the
Ann (PS14B)   [6463] The one on [...] ?
James (PS14C) [6464] No.
Ann (PS14B)   [6465] Th the one just past the social club?
James (PS14C) [6466] No not that one.
              [6467] Well that one, I wa I, I delivered there.
              [6468] But, no, about three houses on from that ... they were
              decorating.
              [6469] Now, it looked as if they were newly decorating so whether
              the water got into there or not, but it didn't look ... as if
              they were in the process of decorating so ... I hope it didn't
              for their sake.
Ann (PS14B)   [6470] Well, that one on the cor the first one
James (PS14C) [6471] Aye.
              [6472] That's the one that appears on television [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6473] That was the one that was on television with the water
              right ... the way
James (PS14C) [6474] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [6475] up it.
James (PS14C) [6476] But further on, you know er, what they call, the teacher
              lives?
Ann (PS14B)   [6477] Brian ?
James (PS14C) [6478] They've got erm ... sort of walls in front of the houses,
              right next to the, the bay windows with erm ... with the slot,
              where they, they slot in these steel erm, plates.
Ann (PS14B)   [6479] Have they?
James (PS14C) [6480] Yes.
              [6481] Oh yes.
              [6482] About two or three of them, they have, at that end.
Ann (PS14B)   [6483] I never noticed that.
James (PS14C) [6484] Yep.
              [6485] With erm ... and they had sand, they all had sandbags
              along there, but they had these sort of ... er ... walls built
              up.
              [6486] But I mean th they're decorative walls, they've got plants
              growing in the top and this sort of thing, built up to the, about
              the level of the window
Ann (PS14B)   [6487] Mhm.
James (PS14C) [6488] and er ... then they have ... the gap for the path and
              they have a, erm ... a steel plate.
              [6489] Because when I went up I had to climb over the steel
              plate.
              [6490] Cos they hadn't removed them.
Ann (PS14B)   [6491] Mhm.
James (PS14C) [6492] Even though the water was all down.
              [6493] But erm
Ann (PS14B)   [6494] Have they done
James (PS14C) [6495] the
Ann (PS14B)   [6496] that themselves?
James (PS14C) [6497] I think so, yes.
              [6498] I think so.
              [6499] Yes, cos they're not the same.
              [6500] I mean each ... each house is different but er ... there's
              ... not all of them have them, there's only two or three had done
              that.
              [6501] And that was at Brian 's end.
              [6502] The ones
Ann (PS14B)   [6503] And he, he is the very end one isn't he?
James (PS14C) [6504] I dunno if he's ... er, but it's his end, I don't know if
              it's his house, I can't remember if it was his house, but at that
              end of the street.
Ann (PS14B)   [6505] Didn't he buy the one that we looked at, once?
James (PS14C) [6506] We did look at one there.
              [6507] I can't remember.
              [6508] I don't know.
              [6509] But in any case, erm ... th the end house hasn't got that
              up ... it's ... oh, what they call her?
              [6510] Rosie?
Ann (PS14B)
James (PS14C) [6511] Rosie .
              [6512] Her house has.
              [6513] And the house next to her, on either side, those are the
              three houses that have got that on.
Ann (PS14B)   [6514] I've never seen Ro Rosie for years!

Ann (PS14B)   [6529] I can't remember, but there was a whole
James (PS14C) [6530] Well it can't be in Moorford because the only thing that

              them a lecture or something once, then I said oh!

Ann (PS14B)   [6558] It looked as if it was.
James (PS14C) [6559] Well I don't like it too hot, [...] ever.
Ann (PS14B)   [6560] Pardon?
James (PS14C) [6561] I don't like hot food ever.
Ann (PS14B)   [6562] Oh I know, you're like my mother, stone cold!
James (PS14C) [6563] I don't like it stone cold, I just like it nice, cos if
              it's too hot you can't taste it.
              [6564] Try to get it down me before it burns my tongue!
Ann (PS14B)   [laugh]
James (PS14C) [6565] These folks and that with all these spices and things a
              ... you can't taste the food ... you taste
Ann (PS14B)   [6566] I know.
James (PS14C) [6567] the spices.
              [6568] Cos that's what it was all about,tas take away the taste
              ... of the rotten food, that's the whole point of spices.
Ann (PS14B)   [6569] I know, I think it's hilarious!
              [6570] Asdir ... erm ... saying my ginger wine was too hot.
James (PS14C) [6571] Was too hot.
Ann (PS14B)   [6572] Bloody ridiculous!
James (PS14C) [6573] When she's used to eating ... red hot curries
Ann (PS14B)   [6574] But they don't drink red hot stuff I suppose.
              [6575] I suppose that was the difference.
              [6576] They don't drink red hot stuff, they drink, [laughing]
              only eat red hot stuff, and they drink ... cool things to cool
              their mouth down after [] !
Ann (PS14B)   [6577] She drinks tea.
James (PS14C) [6578] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [6579] Well she ... she used to drink tea when she ... if I ever
              ... well I didn't invite her in for a coffee do, well I didn't to
              begin with did I?
James (PS14C) [6580] Well they drink, do they not, does she
Ann (PS14B)   [6581] I mean
James (PS14C) [6582] not drink coffee?
Ann (PS14B)   [6583] No.
              [6584] I invite, when we walk back from school ... erm ... when
              she first came to live ... round there, and er ... I used to walk
              back from school with her sometimes ... and say, would you like a
              cup of coffee?
              [6585] Well she didn't know anybody of course and she'd say, no
              [laughing] thank you [] .
              [6586] And then after ... oh, after a few weeks she said ... I'll
              come in for a cup of tea.
              [6587] So I said, okay.
              [6588] So I used to make tea for her.
              [6589] ... And it got, in the end, actually, if I was, if I had
              to do something ... that was urgent ... or I had to go somewhere
              ... I used to have to say to her ... something like, you know,
              erm ... oh I better get on, I got a lot to do this morning, or
              ... I'm goi I've to be shopping and ... be back in time to cook
              Jim's dinner or something like that cos he's starting, oh I've
              gotta have his dinner ready at twelve before he goes to work and
              ... if I really was pushed ... otherwise she would have come in
              every day.
              [6590] Not that I minded her coming in every day, just didn't,
              not always that time.
James (PS14C) [6591] Aye.
              [6592] I wonder how they're getting on through there?
Ann (PS14B)   [6593] And also, if she came in ... when I had the triplets ...
              it meant that erm ... you know, she was sitting talking to me
              when I wanted to be playing with them and ... taking them out and
              getting on with doing things with them.
James (PS14C) [6594] They still haven't sold the house have they?
Ann (PS14B)   [6595] No.
              [6596] ... Well I was just talking about that today to Betty.
              [6597] You ar di ... didn't you see it?
              [6598] Didn't you show someone round it once?
James (PS14C) [6599] Yeah, I've shown two lots of people round.
Ann (PS14B)   [6600] Did you notice the bathroom ceiling?
James (PS14C) [6601] Yes. [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6602] I only saw it erm ... you showed two lots round didn't
              you?
James (PS14C) [6603] Mm mm.
              [6604] I did.
Ann (PS14B)   [6605] I only showed er, Gillian
James (PS14C) [6606] I didn't show them right u opened the house and was stood
              with them, walked round with her like, you know, but ... breezed
Ann (PS14B)   [6607] Well actually the time I went in it was erm ... when
              Gillian was thinking of buying it
James (PS14C) [6608] Oh aye.
Ann (PS14B)   [6609] and er ... I went ... her mother and father were with her
              ... and I just really went in up and down the stairs, and they
              went upstairs and they, they shouted, oh Ann!
              [6610] Come and look at this.
              [6611] And er ... in the back ... I think it was the back bedroom
              ... there was a, a light switch ... and the wiring ... was sort
              of hanging from, from the switch.
              [6612] It looked dangerous!
James (PS14C) [6613] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [6614] And there was ... there was something weird.
              [6615] It wasn't a telephone point ... I don't know what it was.
James (PS14C) [6616] Television point?
Ann (PS14B)   [6617] No, it came from ... half way along the hall, up under the
              stair carpet ... and into the erm ... front bedroom, but it, it
              didn't have a, a sort of, you know the
James (PS14C) [6618] Yes.
              [6619] Aye.
Ann (PS14B)   [6620] it didn't have a telephone, sort of attachment.
              [6621] ... And the bathroom ceiling was black mould!
              [6622] And of course, if it, if it had been ... I know they came
              once ... because
James (PS14C) [6623] Who came?
Ann (PS14B)   [6624] Well, Syrej
James (PS14C) [6625] Oh.
Ann (PS14B)   [6626] dropped Asdir off ... and she drove away and I saw her and
              the four children go, along to the house
James (PS14C) [6627] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [6628] cos I was in here ... and er ... I think she had some
              paint in her hand
James (PS14C) [6629] Oh.
Ann (PS14B)   [6630] and after about ten minutes I thought ... what the devil
              is she doing in there!
              [6631] No, she only had the three children, erm ... Asthana
              wasn't born.
              [6632] That was it.
James (PS14C) [6633] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [6634] I thought, what's she doing in there?
              [6635] Tha that's right, she was pregnant wasn't she, after
James (PS14C) [6636] Can't be.
Ann (PS14B)   [6637] Asthana wasn't born when she left here.
James (PS14C) [6638] That's right, she was [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6639] Mm mm.
James (PS14C) [6640] Well surely she was born when ... [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6641] No,go [sigh] ... well perhaps it wasn't long after Asthana
              was born.
              [6642] Anyway, it was, it was in the winter.
              [6643] Erm
James (PS14C) [6644] Is it two years now?
              [6645] Oh I can't remember.
Ann (PS14B)   [6646] It is, you know.
              [6647] I think Asth
James (PS14C) [6648] Eighteen months old.
              [6649] Two Christmases.
Ann (PS14B)   [6650] No,Januar .
              [6651] Janu
James (PS14C) [6652] It's two Christmases anyway.
Ann (PS14B)   [6653] it's January the seventh.
              [6654] Asthana's birthday, she must be two.
James (PS14C) [6655] No, no, no, no, she's the [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6656] Oh!
              [6657] They moved before Christmas.
James (PS14C) [6658] I know it's two Christmases.
Ann (PS14B)   [6659] Aye.
              [6660] Well, whatever.
              [6661] And er ... well that might have been it,A Asthana might
              have been a tiny baby.
              [6662] So I went along there cos I thought ... if she was
              painting ... the children will be frozen and nothing to sit on
              and no
James (PS14C) [6663] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [6664] heating.
              [6665] So I went down, and she was, she was painting the bathroom
              ceiling.
              [6666] And I said ... er, I'll take the children back to my house
              with me, at least they'll be warm, I can give them a drink or
              something.
              [6667] So they came back ... but of course, if it's jus if it's
              been pouring in on that bathroom ceiling again it's, it, when I
              took, when Elsie called up to me, come and look at this, the
              bathroom ceiling was black mould!
James (PS14C) [6668] It wasn't black when I ... showed those people round, but
              it was damp.
              [6669] You could see
Ann (PS14B)   [6670] Oh no.
James (PS14C) [6671] the stains of the damp.
Ann (PS14B)   [6672] Perhaps he's been and washed it off again.
              [6673] Sometimes when he comes
James (PS14C) [6674] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [6675] through.
James (PS14C) [6676] Aye.
Ann (PS14B)   [6677] But nobody, how long is it since the last time we showed
              them in?
James (PS14C) [6678] It's quite a while now.
              [6679] I dunno.
              [6680] I can't remember when it was.
Ann (PS14B)   [6681] And the key's still on our kitchen windowsill so
James (PS14C) [6682] Yes.
              [6683] ... Yeah but look at, the amount of houses that are for
              sale.
Ann (PS14B)   [6684] Oh yes, but ... but look how quickly Marie sold hers.
James (PS14C) [6685] But it was in a better state.
              [6686] Better condition wasn't it?
Ann (PS14B)   [6687] Oh it was beautiful!
James (PS14C) [6688] I know.
              [6689] Aye.
              [6690] ... But I mean, there's a lot of houses for sale.
Ann (PS14B)   [6691] Some of them are sold quite quickly.
              [6692] ... There's some new people in number ... ten is it?
James (PS14C) [6693] I don't know.
Ann (PS14B)   [6694] They park their car just beside Doug's house.
              [6695] I don't see them very much, they tend to use the back
              door, and sort of come out and then go down
James (PS14C) [6696] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [6697] the back lane.
              [6698] I don't see them come round the front.
              [6699] ... [sigh] ... You haven't drunk your coffee.
              [6700] ... Did you see your mother?
James (PS14C) [6701] Yes.
              [6702] And she's complaining about not going anywhere or
Ann (PS14B)   [6703] Ee!
              [6704] The places she's been in the last couple
James (PS14C) [sneeze]
Ann (PS14B)   [6705] of weeks.
James (PS14C) [6706] Yes.
              [6707] She's
Ann (PS14B)   [6708] If she could only remember where she'd been ... and how
              much she's enjoying it while she's actually doing it.
James (PS14C) [6709] Aye.
              [6710] Cost me a fiver for her hair to be done on Monday and
              another fiver to go out on ... Berlin Square on Tuesday.
              [6711] And tomorrow, she's going to this ... thing at the chapel.
              [6712] Going for tea.
Ann (PS14B)   [6713] What thing at the chapel?
James (PS14C) [6714] Going for tea and then for the service afterwards.
Ann (PS14B)   [6715] Mm!
              [6716] Oh yes!
James (PS14C) [6717] So they're going about four o'clock.
Ann (PS14B)   [6718] I'll have to go ... earlier to see her because they'll be
              ... maybe getting her changed for that.
James (PS14C) [6719] Aha.
              [6720] Karen came and asked me ... I says alright.
              [6721] Have you got to go?
              [6722] And I said yes.
              [6723] ... Mind, she didn't go out this afternoon cos they went,
              some of them went up to the British Legion Club this afternoon.
Ann (PS14B)   [6724] Didn't she want to go?
              [6725] Or wasn't there room?
James (PS14C) [6726] I don't know.
              [6727] She were up sick all night, but I don't think she, she
              would have wanted to go anyway.
              [6728] The erm ... you know the rather large lady that, who I
              always speak to?
Ann (PS14B)   [6729] Er, yes.
James (PS14C) [6730] In the last bed there.
Ann (PS14B)   [6731] Yes.
James (PS14C) [6732] Er, she'd been up there sometimes [...] .
              [6733] She's really enjoyed herself because ... tipple [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6734] [laugh] ... What had she been drinking?
James (PS14C) [6735] She likes her whiskies.
Ann (PS14B)   [6736] Oh.
James (PS14C) [6737] A couple of whiskies.
              [6738] Yeah, she said it was really
Ann (PS14B)   [6739] Well your mother wouldn't want that.
James (PS14C) [6740] I know.
              [6741] ... And it was she who told me that she'd been, that's
              where they'd been.
              [6742] And she remembers everything.
Ann (PS14B)   [6743] I know.
James (PS14C) [6744] Aye.
Ann (PS14B)   [6745] Your mother doesn't remember where she's been as soon as
              she's, gets ... out of the minibus.
James (PS14C) [6746] Yes, I know.
Ann (PS14B)   [6747] Tt!
              [6748] ... I mean, and she, and
James (PS14C) [6749] Well I was just thinking
Ann (PS14B)   [6750] she asks the same question over and over again.
James (PS14C) [6751] looking at those ... well it was Denise who brought the
              list in, but I'd already [...] with the sta er the gardens ...
              but, you know ... the garden scheme in Northumberland.
Ann (PS14B)   [6752] It's lying around somewhere.
James (PS14C) [6753] Aye.
              [6754] And I thought you might want to go some time anyway ...
              er, not on a Sunday.
              [6755] But ... there's one at Blagden Hall.
Ann (PS14B)   [6756] Has she got her colostomy bag back on yet?
              [6757] Or are they still leaving it off?
James (PS14C) [6758] I don't know.
Ann (PS14B)   [6759] How do they take her anywhere if she's got the bag off?
              [6760] ... Must, well that's you out.
James (PS14C) [6761] Well, I was thinking we could perhaps take her to Blagden
              Hall now that's open.
Ann (PS14B)   [6762] Well supposing you, if that's okay.
              [6763] I mean
James (PS14C) [6764] Anyway, they're having ... it's
Ann (PS14B)   [6765] it's one thing being in a hospital but to take her
              somewhere
James (PS14C) [6766] it depends, it depends on the weather.
Ann (PS14B)   [6767] enclosed is
James (PS14C) [6768] It depends on the weather of course.
Ann (PS14B)   [6769] not very fair to her.
James (PS14C) [6770] So that, I mean that's ... I'm a half day that day.
Ann (PS14B)   [6771] I think I read that Blagden was open from ... half past
James (PS14C) [6772] It's open from
Ann (PS14B)   [6773] one till half past three ... or something.
James (PS14C) [6774] Well that's, no, it's been
Ann (PS14B)   [6775] Or was it half past one, where did I put it?
              [6776] Was it half past one to dusk.
James (PS14C) [6777] It's just there.
              [6778] That's it there.
Ann (PS14B)   [6779] It's not much
James (PS14C) [6780] It's later.
              [6781] It's my half day on the, that Sunday.
Ann (PS14B)   [6782] Where is it?
James (PS14C) [6783] I don't know where it is, I haven't marked
Ann (PS14B)   [6784] Well you've got so many piles of papers lying around!
James (PS14C) [6785] They're not mine there, those are all yours!
              [6786] ... Here it is.
              [6787] Here it is.

James (PS14C) [6792] I can't.
              [6793] There, Blagden, there.
              [6794] ... It's at the top.
Ann (PS14B)   [6795] Where?
James (PS14C) [6796] I've marked it at the top.

James (PS14C) [6809] And there's a coffee bar.
Ann (PS14B)   [6810] products, plant and cake stalls.
              [6811] Suitable for wheelchairs.
James (PS14C) [6812] Well that's what I was thinking.
Ann (PS14B)   [6813] Toilet for disabled.
James (PS14C) [6814] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [6815] Tea with home-baked scones and cakes.
              [6816] Open from one till ... five [] .
James (PS14C) [6817] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)   [6818] It still isn't a lot of time if you finish work at quarter
              past three, and you're not home till
James (PS14C) [6819] I'm, I'm a half day, I finish at twelve.
Ann (PS14B)   [6820] Oh!
              [6821] Oh!
              [6822] Right.
              [6823] Oh that's okay then.
James (PS14C) [6824] I was just thinking if we take her out that afternoon.
Ann (PS14B)   [6825] Sunday, May the third.
James (PS14C) [6826] In fact, I was ... there's a ... I'm going to suggest that
              we, we take some of the patients er ... and early about ... when
              is this?
              [6827] It's in June.
Ann (PS14B)   [6828] Well do you want to go ... take some of the other patients
              that day and I'll go as an escort?
James (PS14C) [6829] Well on the twelfth of June my ... Age Concern are having
              ... er, a fair at Blagden Hall, all day that day.
Ann (PS14B)   [6830] On when?
James (PS14C) [6831] The twelfth of July.
              [6832] ... So on Hazel's birthday.
              [6833] No, that's twelfth of June.
Ann (PS14B)   [6834] Twelfth of June, your Hazel's birthday.
James (PS14C) [6835] What's the twelfth of July?
Ann (PS14B)   [6836] I've no idea.
James (PS14C) [6837] It's the twelfth of July is last year the er
Ann (PS14B)   [6838] Fourth of July's Independence Day.
James (PS14C) [6839] it's the twelfth of July of last year they ... had one.
              [6840] No, that's the fourteenth of July.
Ann (PS14B)   [6841] I don't think anything's the twelfth of July.
James (PS14C) [6842] No.
              [6843] It's the fourteenth of July is Bastille Day.
              [6844] But, anyway
Ann (PS14B)   [6845] And what are you that day?
James (PS14C) [6846] I'm on early.
              [6847] All earlies.
Ann (PS14B)   [6848] Ordinary early?
              [6849] Quarter past three early?
James (PS14C) [6850] Oh, well, I say I'm on early but ... I will be, I could be
              an early or a late.
              [6851] So that's
Ann (PS14B)   [6852] So if you took them that day you'd be going while you were
              on duty?
James (PS14C) [6853] Well, for pa most of it ... or part of it.
              [6854] But I could organize that.
              [6855] And, if ... what they call it?
Ann (PS14B)   [6856] Is that a Sunday at Easter?
James (PS14C) [6857] It's a Sunday.
              [6858] If they can actually let me know ... whether that bus is
              available or not
Ann (PS14B)   [6859] You're not gonna drive that bus are you?
James (PS14C) [6860] I didn't say I was.
              [6861] But, Mr has got a P S V licence.
              [6862] I don't know if I can drive
Ann (PS14B)   [6863] Oh!
James (PS14C) [6864] the bus or not, it depends ... we'll have to see.
Ann (PS14B)   [6865] And does he, does he drive the buses?
              [6866] Er, the hospital bus like
James (PS14C) [6867] No.
Ann (PS14B)   [6868] that?
James (PS14C) [6869] No.
              [6870] No.
              [6871] He's never driven.
              [6872] He's not down as a ... as a driver for the minibus now.
              [6873] But he's got a P S V licence which is a different thing
              altogether.
Ann (PS14B)   [6874] Yes, but, if he was willing to drive in his spare ta time,
              he would have his name down surely?
              [6875] Wouldn't he?
James (PS14C) [6876] Well one would have thought so, but I said to er Mrs you
              see, about the minibus, no not the minibus, the M S bus being
              available ... and, I said the problem was ... or maybe ... that
              we'd have to have drivers who have had a P S V licence, or what
              they call it?
              [6877] It isn't a P S V license now, it's ... very different type
              of licence.
Ann (PS14B)   [6878] Well whatever it's called.
James (PS14C) [6879] But it's the same thing.
Ann (PS14B)   [6880] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [6881] And she said, oh my husband's just renewed his.
              [6882] So he could drive and so there'd be no problem she says.
              [6883] But he's never ever, as far as I know ... offered to drive
              the minibus.
Ann (PS14B)   [6884] Does he work?
James (PS14C) [6885] Well
Ann (PS14B)   [6886] It sounds, it sounds odd saying, oh my husband's just
              renewed his, it makes it sound as if he hasn't had a P S V ...
              erm ... licence for a while.
James (PS14C) [6887] I don't know.
Ann (PS14B)   [6888] Cos if he was working, and driving ... he wo it, surely he
              would have automatically renewed it?
James (PS14C) [6889] I don't know.
Ann (PS14B)   [6890] So it sounds as if he's just renewed it after a while.
James (PS14C) [6891] They used to have some sort of test on that [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6892] So maybe that's why he's never volunteered before.
              [6893] If he didn't have the licence, he couldn't.
James (PS14C) [6894] Well yes, of course.
Ann (PS14B)   [6895] Except, he could have for the minibus of course.
              [6896] ... Where's my knitting gone?
James (PS14C) [6897] I think he had a pet shop.
Ann (PS14B)   [6898] Well he wouldn't need a P S V licence for a pet shop.
James (PS14C) [6899] But, I don't know that he does now.
Ann (PS14B)   [6900] Unless you were a Pet Shop Boy ... and were a roadie.
James (PS14C) [6901] Mm mm. [cough]
Ann (PS14B)   [6902] I can't remember what line I was doing.
James (PS14C) [6903] Well ... because she ... periodically brings the bird seed
              for the ... the bird on the ward.
              [6904] I'm sure he never [...] .
              [6905] Whether the business was successful or not.
              [6906] I had a vague recollection ... somebody said he had this
              pet shop at Blagden or som ... not Blagden er
Ann (PS14B)   [6907] Blagden?
              [6908] There are no shops
James (PS14C) [6909] not Blagden
Ann (PS14B)   [6910] at Blagden.
James (PS14C) [6911] Bury.
Ann (PS14B)   [6912] Oh.
James (PS14C) [sniff]
Ann (PS14B)   [6913] Mhm.
James (PS14C) [6914] But we could still take the minibus and just take ...
              three or four.
Ann (PS14B)   [6915] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [6916] Well that's an alternative.
              [6917] ... But that will be a good day to go out on.
Ann (PS14B)   [6918] Mm mm.
James (PS14C) [6919] But we could take my mother on the other one.
Ann (PS14B)   [6920] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [6921] Or we could take ... them periodically.
              [6922] Could go out, well the next ... then there's a queue a
              mile long.
              [6923] I said no.
              [6924] I said mark the ones on that thing.
              [6925] [...] you want to go to.
              [6926] ... That's when I [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [6927] It's a bit far to take her to near Berwick.
James (PS14C) [6928] I wasn't thinking of taking her there, I was thinking of
              taking you!
Ann (PS14B)   [6929] Oh.
James (PS14C) [6930] Anyway, it might be too cold.
Ann (PS14B)   [6931] And Corn Hill on the Tweed's a bit far for you my love.
James (PS14C) [6932] I was thinking about
Ann (PS14B)   [6933] There's Anwick
James (PS14C) [6934] cos you
Ann (PS14B)   [6935] Howick at Anwick.
James (PS14C) [6936] I was thinking of you going there.
Ann (PS14B)   [6937] Where's Hallington?
James (PS14C) [6938] I dunno.
              [6939] It tells you.
              [6940] Does it not?
Ann (PS14B)   [6941] Oh!
              [6942] Wait a minute.
              [6943] Between Colwell and Kirkharl.
James (PS14C) [6944] Mm.
              [6945] ... Etaul Manor's open nearly every Sunday.
Ann (PS14B)   [6946] Wasn't it Kirk oh no it was Katheaton.
              [6947] Was it Ka
James (PS14C) [6948] Where Capability Brown
Ann (PS14B)   [6949] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [6950] came from?
              [6951] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [6952] That's right.
              [6953] We never did find his house did we?
James (PS14C) [6954] No.
Ann (PS14B)   [6955] If there's any
James (PS14C) [6956] [laughing] And there's nothing there [] !
Ann (PS14B)   [6957] if there's any ... remnants of his house.
              [6958] There was certainly no ... indication of it anywhere in
              the village.
              [6959] There wasn't even anybody to ask!
James (PS14C) [6960] Nope.
              [6961] But if you wanted to go to any of those, those I marked
              for my ... days off, apart from the one to Blagden on a half day.
              [6962] But I could go that day.
              [6963] Cos it's no distance to Blagden.
              [6964] The others we'll take
Ann (PS14B)   [6965] We could walk there.
James (PS14C) [6966] Tt.
              [6967] Aye, it's three mi it's over four miles, it's ... I
              haven't got the street map, it's about four miles.
              [6968] ... [sigh] ... Well we took your mother and we ... that
              time.
Ann (PS14B)   [6969] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [6970] Perhaps we'll get the bus there.
              [6971] And then, in those days there was a bus service that way.
              [6972] I don't think there's a bus service running that way now.
Ann (PS14B)   [6973] Isn't there?
James (PS14C) [6974] Nope.
              [6975] To get to
Ann (PS14B)   [6976] Well how many houses are on that road?
              [6977] There's only
James (PS14C) [6978] Well there's a fair number.
              [6979] Actually on the road itself there's ... well there is a
              fair number.
              [6980] There's quite a few in the estate itself.
              [6981] Quite a few houses down
Ann (PS14B)   [6982] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [6983] the estate.
              [6984] ... Tt.
Ann (PS14B)   [6985] Did you tell me ... what did they call the one who lived
              there?
              [6986] That worked with you.
James (PS14C) [6987] Near the road there?
Ann (PS14B)   [6988] Yeah.
              [6989] Di
James (PS14C) [6990] She got [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [6991] Oh that's right.
              [6992] ... Where is she?
James (PS14C) [6993] Well er, she's at home, or she's in the erm R E I
Ann (PS14B)   [6994] I used to see her in the hairdressers sometimes.
James (PS14C) [6995] while the death is being investigated.
              [6996] And she ... she went into the R E I, with a query ...
              stroke.
Ann (PS14B)   [6997] I know.
              [6998] I remember that.
James (PS14C) [6999] A query ... I think she had a query lump on her breast or
              something, er lump or something.
              [7000] And ... they transferred her to the, the Cottage ... and
              she did quite well, and she was home.
              [7001] And whatever lump it was ... they said wasn't anything to
              worry about.
              [7002] But then ... it was virtually ... er ... clear again, she
              was saying ... but she has a brain tumour.
              [7003] And whether they can operate [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [7004] Mm.
              [7005] Oh dear.
              [7006] ... She was nice, she was a nice woman.
James (PS14C) [7007] But he retired early, of course, because of his ... bad
              knees.
Ann (PS14B)   [7008] Mhm.
James (PS14C) [7009] He couldn't ... well he was the ... head gamekeeper for
              Lord .
Ann (PS14B)   [7010] Yeah.
James (PS14C) [7011] And er ... the dampness and the ... tramping all over the
              ... rough ground and what have you, wasn't good for his knees.
Ann (PS14B)   [7012] Mm.
James (PS14C) [7013] He [...] ... came from all over ... Macaw or somewhere
              down there ... he came from.
Ann (PS14B)   [7014] Mm.
              [7015] Didn't know that.
James (PS14C) [7016] And when he came out of the army ... you know, after the
              war ... er ... he didn't want to go.
              [7017] Well, I think, I don't know if they went back to the pits
              and sort of left, but he didn't want to stay there and ... and
              got this job as a gamekeeper [...] .
              [7018] ... [...] . He had a stroke.
              [7019] They say that if you, if it wasn't for the shooting ... we
              wouldn't have any grouse or pheasants cos they wouldn't be
              preserved.
              [7020] ... [...] they ... they'd be [...] on a farm if he wants.
              [7021] The grouse apparently it would.
Ann (PS14B)   [7022] I nearly stood on a grouse once, when we were walking up
              ... I wasn't walking with you, it was when we were with the
              Footpath Society.
              [7023] Got the shock of my life!
              [7024] I was walking along talking to ... Mika I think ... and it
              just shot up from in front of me, I had my foot out.
              [7025] It waited till the very last second.
James (PS14C) [7026] Mm.
              [7027] Well that's
Ann (PS14B)   [7028] I couldn't believe it!
James (PS14C) [sniff]
Ann (PS14B)   [7029] Perhaps it decided to stay put and I wouldn't notice it
              was there and maybe at the last second it decided it would ...
              run for it!
James (PS14C) [7030] Well we nearly ... when I was up with the children at the
              to ... when I was [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [7031] Mm.
James (PS14C) [7032] and it went up into those ... they were coming down in the
              minibus ... and er ... we stopped ... so the I can't remember
              where we stopped.
              [7033] Anyway, it was a good job we did because these ... erm ...
              these grouse and these chickens, I mean, they were so blended in
              with the ... the, the ... roadside you could hardly see them, and
              then they moved.
              [7034] As we were coming down so slowly, and I think ... we
              stopped suddenly ... cos then they walked across the path.
Ann (PS14B)   [laugh]
James (PS14C) [7035] You couldn't, you co you couldn't see them when they were
              on the roadside, you know on, on the ... whe when they moved
Ann (PS14B)   [7036] Mm.
James (PS14C) [7037] onto the actual track like, so
Ann (PS14B)   [7038] Mm.
James (PS14C) [7039] And Joy got the red squirrel so, at er [...] ... when I
              was out.
Ann (PS14B)   [7040] Well Edith told me ... that erm
James (PS14C) [7041] Or was it Kenneth saying?
Ann (PS14B)   [7042] as soon as she bought her house ... do you know which is
              her house?
James (PS14C) [7043] Yes I've been to it.
Ann (PS14B)   [7044] What did you go there for?
James (PS14C) [7045] To deliver something for you. [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [7046] Oh maybe, a Christmas
James (PS14C) [7047] Can't remember what it was.
Ann (PS14B)   [7048] card it would be.
              [7049] Cos that, the, you know the le
James (PS14C) [7050] But that's not where we saw the red squirrel.
Ann (PS14B)   [7051] you know at the left hand side of her house they've
              planted some trees.
James (PS14C) [7052] That's out the back there.
Ann (PS14B)   [7053] Yeah.
              [7054] But there was already ... no.
              [7055] It's at the ... oh!
James (PS14C) [7056] It's out the back.
Ann (PS14B)   [7057] No, the back of her house opens ... has erm
James (PS14C) [7058] Goes out onto the spri the spring head itself.
Ann (PS14B)   [7059] The back of her house, the back garden ... erm, faces onto
              a field.
              [7060] There's the fence
James (PS14C) [7061] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)   [7062] o over the fence from that, er, the back garden ... is the
              field, but
James (PS14C) [7063] That leads over to the
Ann (PS14B)   [cough]
James (PS14C) [7064] other side of the house.
Ann (PS14B)   [7065] but to the left of their house, when you're facing the
              front door to the left

James (PS14C) [7071] Mhm.
Ann (PS14B)   [7072] there was already ... quite a few trees there, it was like
              a small wood ... and they've plan and
James (PS14C) [7073] Well it is, that is.
Ann (PS14B)   [7074] they've planted some extra ones.

Ann (PS14B)   [7077] fruit trees.

Ann (PS14B)   [7083] but from the time they moved in she noticed red squirrels.
James (PS14C) [7084] Oh we didn't walk that way, we went up ... further down.
              [7085] And erm
Ann (PS14B)   [7086] I think she said she'd seen a badger as well.
James (PS14C) [7087] Well it's quite possible, yeah.
              [7088] In the ... from there onwards, you know,we there's
              nothing.

James (PS14C) [7095] But there's a few odd houses, a few odd villages, which
              are only small, but there's nothing much really.
              [7096] ... When you re walk, going west it's countryside all the
              way.
Ann (PS14B)   [7097] Mhm.

              [7104] I don't know if she's gone alone or with some, or with a
              friend, but er ... she said she wanted to, she'd never been to
              California ... and she wanted to go ... before she was too ...
              old and crotchety to get there ... because David's ... he's in no
              fit state to go anywhere any more.

Ann (PS14B)   [7122] If they're not, if they don't, if it doesn't get
              sufficient light, the leaves turn all green

                                     five thousand pounds then, so it shows ya
                                     how long ago it is
Pat (PS167)                          [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [7204] er, but it needed quite a few

Pat (PS167)                          [7205] just from a quick glance it looked
                                     like it would need some er work on it
Ann (PS14B)                          [7206] it had one of those
Group of unknown speakers (KB8PSUGP) [...]

Ann (PS14B)                          [7209] they said it was very nice, but,
                                     the, they reckoned then it needed about
                                     another five thousand pounds spending on
                                     it
Pat (PS167)                          [7210] Just think you'd be laughing now if

Ann (PS14B)                [7332] yes
Chris (PS168)              [7333] but I'm not sure what colour to do yet, and I

Pat (PS167)                [7499] I, I know the last time and I was reading all
                           me pamphlets that came through ... and I thought
                           why, you know, but a lot of them I dunno ... it's
                           hard to know who to vote for I think
Ann (PS14B)                [7500] We surely don't want any more Tories in
Pat (PS167)                [7501] Well ... I don't think I've done that badly
                           with them, you know
Ann (PS14B)                [7502] What do you think's happened to the Health
                           Service?
Pat (PS167)                [7503] Mm
Ann (PS14B)                [7504] Have you talked to a nurse recently?
Pat (PS167)                [7505] The nurses always complain, they were badly
                           paid
Ann (PS14B)                [7506] Oh

Ann (PS14B)                [7508] just talk to them, just so short staffed, I
                           don't know when Jim last got off duty on time
Pat (PS167)                [7509] Aye, they're short staffed
Ann (PS14B)                [7510] the last time he should have finished at
                           quarter to one he got off about half past one ... mm

Pat (PS167)                [7511] So is that because they could [...] they
                           won't take on any more?
Ann (PS14B)                [7512] They can't, because of all the wards that are
                           closed, because there aren't enough nurses
Pat (PS167)                [7513] I'm, I'm sure there's plenty of people who
                           want to do nursing ... and a lot would be for the
                           erm
Ann (PS14B)                [7514] They can train, there's plenty training, but
                           when you've finished your training there's nowhere
Pat (PS167)                [7515] There's no

                           government are limiting the numbers

Pat (PS167)                [7751] Down to the river?
Ann (PS14B)                [7752] down and there's a path goes along and it
                           comes, it goes under the road bridge and it comes
                           out at the foot bridge and it runs next to it
Chris (PS168)              [7753] Aha
Ann (PS14B)                [7754] the water got up to the second step from the
                           top, but, when, instead of turning right into my
                           road if you'd keep straight on
Chris (PS168)              [7755] aha
Ann (PS14B)                [7756] and go along the river, you know where the
                           flood wall is?
Chris (PS168)              [7757] yeah

Pat (PS167)                [7760] mm
Ann (PS14B)                [7761] but that wasn't with flood water coming over,
                           that was because it was coming up the drains, cos it
                           couldn't drain into the river
Pat (PS167)                [7762] ah, aha
Ann (PS14B)                [7763] so those houses were all sandbagged, but it,
                           it got into some, the problem was that the, the road
                           closed sign kept blowing down in the wind, I tried
                           to stand it up but it was oh so heavy, I got it up,
                           but it, it immediately blew down again, and
Pat (PS167)                [7764] Well we went down
Ann (PS14B)                [7765] people couldn't see that it was water there
Pat (PS167)                [7766] Oh
Ann (PS14B)                [7767] sort of going just a short way along and
                           having to reverse back out again
Chris (PS168)              [7768] I tell you how bad our one was, it was all
                           over the road, this, the, the river line
Ann (PS14B)                [7769] mm

                           [8143] ... What's this?
                           [8144] A mystery.
                           [8145] Oh is this the thing we went round the door
                           with?

Ann (PS14B)      [8158] Oh!
                 [8159] Yes please.
                 [8160] I've got a pile of stuff in here anyway for you.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8161] Have you?
                 [8162] Who's that from?
Ann (PS14B)      [8163] The videos, your children's videos
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8164] Ah right.
Ann (PS14B)      [8165] and er what else, oh and the Goldilocks book he didn't
                 take home.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8166] Right
Ann (PS14B)      [8167] I found that yesterday in the erm ... doll's pram.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8168] I was gonna ask a favour, if you don't mind for
                 tonight.
Ann (PS14B)      [8169] Yeah?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8170] Would you mind having the boys for about half an hour
                 because I would like to get Bryony's hair cut.
                 [8171] I want about three or four inches off the bottom
Ann (PS14B)      [8172] Mhm
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8173] and I think she's gonna have an absolute screaming fit.
Ann (PS14B)      [8174] [laugh] Where're you taking her?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8175] Probably to the one at Staffhill if I could have an, if
                 I can get an appointment booked.
Ann (PS14B)      [8176] Yeah
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8177] It's just that, well you can imagine what she's gonna
                 be like.
                 [8178] But she screams so much when she gets her hair cut and
                 she won't have
Ann (PS14B)      [8179] I know.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8180] it tied back.
                 [8181] So even though I'd like
Ann (PS14B)      [8182] I still haven't given, that's reminded me seeing Shona
                 there, I, I don't think I've given her that pair of trousers
                 and the sweatshirt and I told her that I've got them.
                 [8183] I must look for them.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8184] Right, so that'd be lovely if you don't mind having
                 them after school.
Ann (PS14B)      [8185] Right, I'll get you these er
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8186] Oh I'll pick them up [...] if you like, cos I'm gonna
                 go and see if I can get my shoes [...]
Ann (PS14B)      [8187] Alright, well I'll, I'll give you them now cos they're
                 here in the car.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8188] Oh right!
Ann (PS14B)      [8189] I've got I've got them with me.
                 [8190] That's erm the card with teddy bears on that Bryony
                 wanted that she kept me
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8191] Oh right last night.
Ann (PS14B)      [8192] she kept meaning to take home and kept forgetting.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8193] [...] isn't it?
Ann (PS14B)      [8194] It is, yes.
                 [8195] Oh she loved it.
                 [8196] She carried it all around on er Tuesday.
                 [8197] Right, there are your videos.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8198] Right, thanks.
                 [8199] The children have been difficult this weekend I don't
                 know what's a matter with them, I think they're just
Ann (PS14B)      [8200] Well, the er th they seem to ... Richard seemed to cry
                 a bit more or a bit easier, you know, if he bumped himself and
                 Bryony, and I think it was, well Bryony it seemed to be a
                 heavy cold that was making her feel miserable.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8201] Yes
Ann (PS14B)      [8202] And I think maybe it was with all of them.
                 [8203] They were just slightly under the weather.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8204] And Martin has taught them to say you stupid zombie.
Ann (PS14B)      [8205] Oh great!
                 [8206] Oh great! [laugh]
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8207] I know, that's I'm really pleased about that.
Ann (PS14B)      [8208] Oh dear!
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8209] So James is going around calling everybody a stupid
                 zombie.
Ann (PS14B)      [8210] Oh well, it makes a change from a [laughing] stupid
                 idiot []
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8211] I know.
                 [8212] It's gonna be wonderful at nursery if he goes straight
                 up to his teacher again.
Ann (PS14B)      [8213] Oh.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8214] Oh heck.
Ann (PS14B)      [8215] Again?
                 [8216] Why?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8217] You know when she told him to close the cupboard?
Ann (PS14B)      [8218] No.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8219] At nursery?
Ann (PS14B)      [8220] No.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8221] She was, he was going in her cupboard, Mrs I gather he
                 said you stupid idiot to her. [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)      [8222] Oh dear!
                 [8223] Oh what a start on your first visit
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8224] I know
Ann (PS14B)      [8225] or [laughing] a good impression [] .
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8226] I know.
                 [8227] I think that's part of the reason why she said you've
                 got your hands [laughing] full [] .
Ann (PS14B)      [8228] I heard her say you've got your hands full but I didn't
                 know why.
                 [8229] Oh, hey.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8230] And then with Richard having the screaming fits when it
                 was time to go home.
Ann (PS14B)      [8231] Ah but that, that
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8232] Very reluctant.
Ann (PS14B)      [8233] that was a good sign wasn't it?
                 [8234] He was screaming because he had to go [laughing] home
                 [] .
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8235] Yeah but none of the them would sit down or anything
                 like that so you know
Ann (PS14B)      [8236] Yeah, oh, no
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8237] I think she's got quite a [laughing] [...] [] .
                 [8238] Well I mean that's what children are like.
Ann (PS14B)      [8239] Well ... none of the others looked as young as them did
                 they?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8240] No, they're not.
                 [8241] I mean they're not even three, yet they're going to be
                 the absolute youngest.
                 [8242] Joe who started, you know Debbie who's
Ann (PS14B)      [8243] Yes
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8244] got three boys?
Ann (PS14B)      [8245] Yes
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8246] Joe was er three at the beginning of February.
                 [8247] Well at that age a few months makes a difference.
Ann (PS14B)      [8248] It does yes.
                 [8249] Oh, how's your mother?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8250] Alright, she's er quite [...]
Ann (PS14B)      [8251] She hasn't driven yo you round the bend yet?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8252] [...] squawking at each other because the kids have
                 been so diabolical!
                 [8253] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)      [8254] Oh dear.
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8255] So I think she's got quite an impression of Trevor now.
                 [8256] I keep saying to her they're not normally like this.
Ann (PS14B)      [8257] Well they're not.
                 [8258] ... But if they're not feeling quite well what can you
                 expect?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8259] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)      [8260] I mean what do you feel like when you're not quite
                 well?
                 [8261] Aren't you short-tempered and whatever?
Dorothy (PS14L)  [8262] Mm [laugh]

                 very long at all.

                 said I don't think these are the right shape for my car and I

Ann (PS14B)      [8382] Well if that's where I'm going to I wouldn't be able to
                 get the triple buggy into that shop, would I?
Betty (PS15U)    [8383] Has it got double doors that shop?
Ann (PS14B)      [8384] It's only a small shop, isn't it?
                 [8385] Anyway, [laugh] it's better to go today.
                 [8386] It's too far to walk them and it's, it's up hill

Betty (PS15U)    [8387] [...] on your own than push the buggy.

                 [8390] Right, coffee's coming up!
Ann (PS14B)      [8391] Besides which, if I can't get any I'll have to think of
                 something else.
                 [8392] Right, I'll go and lock me door.
*** 24 (Tape 070004) ***

              on again.
              [8407] I, I'll hold it off for the ... I'm economizing on the
Ann (PS14B)   [8408] Doesn't sound very hopeful.
              [8409] Does erm Bob er m know a lot about growing plants and
              things as well as vegetables?
Betty (PS15U) [8410] Oh yes, he, he
Ann (PS14B)   [8411] I'm looking, I want somebody who knows something about
              gardening.
              [8412] I'm trying to find out why one of our azaleas has turned
              up its toes.
Betty (PS15U) [8413] Albert over the road will be the best one to
Ann (PS14B)   [8414] Oh.
Betty (PS15U) [8415] tell you that, cos he was erm, erm school
Ann (PS14B)   [8416] Oh.
Betty (PS15U) [8417] grounds gardener.
              [8418] He
Ann (PS14B)   [8419] I'll try
Betty (PS15U) [8420] he would deal with shrubs more than, Bob hasn't got a, I
              mean he grows flowers and [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8421] I know
Betty (PS15U) [8422] and things like that.
Ann (PS14B)   [8423] yeah.
              [8424] Thank you.
Betty (PS15U) [8425] Erm, but erm, I mean he nearly does know, but I mean
              Albert is ...
Ann (PS14B)   [8426] Is it lit?
Betty (PS15U) [8427] Mm mm Albert is the gard he, you know, really good
              gardener.
              [8428] Er I mean he shows [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8429] Well they're both in tubs, they're both planted in
              ericaceous compost which is what we were told.
Betty (PS15U) [8430] Yeah
Ann (PS14B)   [8431] When we ... fed them before the winter we gave them proper
              er ... fertilizer for things that need acid soil.
Betty (PS15U) [8432] Mm mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8433] I know they can be affected by wind and frost and it turns
              the leaves brown and kills off the buds, but why is only one
              affected?
              [8434] And as soon as it's
Betty (PS15U) [8435] Are they different kinds?
              [8436] Or
Ann (PS14B)   [8437] No.
Betty (PS15U) [8438] are they exactly the same?
Ann (PS14B)   [8439] They're the same kind exactly but they're different
              colours that's all.
              [8440] They're both in, they're both in wooden half barrels.
Betty (PS15U) [8441] But, but don't azaleas don't azaleas shed their leaves?
Ann (PS14B)   [8442] Erm I think some do ... but some are evergreen and these
              are evergreen.
Betty (PS15U) [8443] Oh!
              [8444] Because I had one ... in the garden here and we moved it
              actually when we, we took the er hedge out er to put the fence
              and the gate on er and we moved it somewhere else and it er it
              just died off.
              [8445] Er but it used to er shed its leaves.
Ann (PS14B)   [8446] Well, yeah I think some do.
Betty (PS15U) [8447] And I think you're supposed to prune a little bit, aren't
              you?
Ann (PS14B)   [8448] They're not big enough to prune yet.
              [8449] They're, they're about er
Betty (PS15U) [8450] But should you not prune them lightly to
Ann (PS14B)   [8451] eighteen inches.
Betty (PS15U) [8452] encourage new growth? [...] you see
Ann (PS14B)   [8453] No i it's er
Betty (PS15U) [8454] Albert going past, he's back and forwards to the garden.
Ann (PS14B)   [8455] It said in the gardening book.
              [8456] It didn't say much about them.
              [8457] Really it's about, you know, huge erm rhododendrons, it's
              only a little bit at the end of that.
              [8458] But erm
Betty (PS15U) [8459] I've got a book here.
Ann (PS14B)   [8460] you know that er polythene that's got wire netting in
              between it like a, like a wire netting sandwich with po with
              clear polythene on the outside?
              [8461] We bent some of that round the windward side of the barrel

Betty (PS15U) [8462] Oh right yes a sort of [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8463] and I, and tied a lump of string round it to keep it on.
              [8464] So it's been sheltered from the wind.
Betty (PS15U) [8465] Ooh unless the
Ann (PS14B)   [8466] We've made sure
Betty (PS15U) [8467] cat's done something on it.
Ann (PS14B)   [8468] Oh God, next door's cats.
              [8469] Er I thought I had one in the house yesterday I went, as
              Sheila was going erm ... Jackie was in her garden
Betty (PS15U) [8470] Oh yes
Ann (PS14B)   [8471] and I was telling her that that was the daughter-in-law of
              Mrs who lived there before
Betty (PS15U) [8472] Owned the house originally.
Ann (PS14B)   [8473] Graham did
Betty (PS15U) [8474] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8475] and er I'd left the front door and the inner door open and
Betty (PS15U) [8476] It don't switch off I'll have to go and do it.
Ann (PS14B)   [8477] oh, and er the cat was lurking around ... however, it had
              gone somewhere else.
              [8478] ... I can't
Betty (PS15U) [8479] Oh gosh!
              [8480] I've done it full!
Ann (PS14B)   [8481] Oh never mind I'll drink half of it.
              [8482] ... Yeah, azaleas.
Betty (PS15U) [8483] It's a weak one anyway, Ann.
Ann (PS14B)   [8484] It just says, where is it?
              [8485] [reading] Lime-free soil plus large quantities of peat or
              leaf mould.
              [8486] Some shade during the heat of the day [] .
              [8487] Er it doesn't get any.
              [8488] Erm when the sun's at the hottest anyway it's sheltered it
              only gets, oh and the other thing is, you, er it, it doesn't say
              here but you're supposed to, it's supposed to be somewhere where
              they'll be sheltered from the early morning sun if there's been
Betty (PS15U) [8489] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)   [8490] a frost.
              [8491] Oh we've had frost we haven't [laughing] any early morning
              sun [] anyway.
              [8492] Thank you.
Betty (PS15U) [8493] They said your azaleas reach five to eight feet.
              [8494] ... [...] it doesn't say, does it?
Ann (PS14B)   [8495] I gave it some water cos I
Betty (PS15U) [8496] They might be different types, you see.
              [8497] One might
Ann (PS14B)   [8498] Yeah but
Betty (PS15U) [8499] [...] you see what I mean?
Ann (PS14B)   [8500] I know it's, it's just turning up its toes.
Betty (PS15U) [8501] Oh!
              [8502] Dear, dear.
Ann (PS14B)   [8503] How much are car mats, Paul?
Paul (PS15V)  [8504] I think they're within the region of two quid each up to
              about five pound each.
Ann (PS14B)   [8505] Mm I can afford that.
Betty (PS15U) [8506] [reading] Evergreen Azaleas.
              [8507] Mostly small plants three to four feet high [] .
              [8508] Is that what you've got?
Ann (PS14B)   [8509] Yes they are small cos I got them
Betty (PS15U) [8510] [reading] Small dark green leaves,
Ann (PS14B)   [8511] to go in these half barrels
Betty (PS15U) [8512] flowering prolifically May and June.
              [8513] Mostly hybrids.
              [8514] Forms of [...] azalea.
              [8515] Look for the [...] hybrid [...] flowering June July.
              [8516] Exceptionally hardy but needing shade. [...] .
Ann (PS14B)   [8517] Well it's against the garage wall.
Betty (PS15U) [8518] Mostly very hardy, large flowers, pink [...] no pruning
              needed.
              [8519] Propagated by layers. [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8520] It said in my book just tidy them up if you, you know, if
              they needed a bit of tidying up.
Betty (PS15U) [8521] [...] planting out [...] [] .
              [8522] No, it doesn't say any more than that.
              [8523] No, it doesn't say
Ann (PS14B)   [8524] That's more or less what it said in my book except erm
              they need to be shaded from early morning sun if there's been a
              frost.
              [8525] Well we've had plenty of frosts but there's been no early
              morning sun.
              [8526] I know there's been wind
Betty (PS15U) [8527] Oh there's been a lot of wind [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8528] but er
Betty (PS15U) [8529] which probably is bad as a frost.
Ann (PS14B)   [8530] Yeah
Betty (PS15U) [8531] Have you got them in separate containers?
Ann (PS14B)   [8532] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8533] Ah yes, I think you told me.
Ann (PS14B)   [8534] And the, they're beside the garage facing towards the
              kitchen
Betty (PS15U) [8535] Mm ... oh they're sheltered
Ann (PS14B)   [8536] and the sun always comes along the side of the house.
              [8537] I can tell because me, me washing always blows towards the
              gate, to the back gate
Betty (PS15U) [8538] Mm mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8539] right?
Betty (PS15U) [8540] Mm mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8541] Erm ... so that must be, that's south over there isn't it?
Betty (PS15U) [8542] Mm mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8543] Well it should be a south wind, it's not even a north
              wind. ...
Betty (PS15U) [8544] That's west ... that's south
Ann (PS14B)   [8545] Yes, that's right.
Betty (PS15U) [8546] No
Ann (PS14B)   [8547] Hang on.
Betty (PS15U) [8548] That's west, that's east, that's north
Ann (PS14B)   [8549] Wait a minute,wh which, which direction's Scot oh me nose.
Betty (PS15U) [8550] that's south, that's south, that's south
Ann (PS14B)   [8551] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8552] that's south
Ann (PS14B)   [8553] Well it's coming ... along the side of the house along
              there.
Betty (PS15U) [8554] Yeah, but that'll be like a tunnel, you know, when the
              wind's blowing because the wind hits our front
Ann (PS14B)   [8555] Yeah
Betty (PS15U) [8556] windows and is it the one er nearest the front that is
Ann (PS14B)   [8557] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8558] Oh yeah, no
Ann (PS14B)   [8559] But it's only about er ... what's in between the two
              barrels?
              [8560] Th the,th you know that erm small cauldron with er
              primroses in?
Betty (PS15U) [8561] Mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8562] That's all that's separating them, I mean they're close
              together
Betty (PS15U) [8563] Yes, but different plants respond differently to [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8564] and it's not big enough to shelter the other one and the
              other one looks perfectly healthy.
Betty (PS15U) [8565] Mm ... unless you've just got some disease.
Ann (PS14B)   [8566] Good cup of coffee that.
Betty (PS15U) [8567] Eh?
Ann (PS14B)   [8568] I said it's a good cup of coffee that.
Betty (PS15U) [8569] Oh!
              [8570] Thank Paul [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [8571] Thank you Paul!
Betty (PS15U) [8572] It's the one coffee I get made per day.
              [8573] I get one in the morning and then at night.
              [8574] Well he makes tea at night.
              [8575] He makes a cup of tea at night and that's his effort.
              [8576] ... So er Sheila was saying that erm ... Andrea's in Lon
              er Bath.

              said

              she says well that's what we hope.
              [8592] We thought that would be best for her [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8593] Oh yes she was very keen wasn't she when she used to come
              and stay with her Grandma?
Betty (PS15U) [8594] But she says she's now wanting to do archaeology erm but
              she says she hasn't got any A levels!
Ann (PS14B)   [8595] You can't do that without A levels.
Betty (PS15U) [8596] So she says I don't think she's really capable of getting
              any.

Betty (PS15U) [8643] I mean they must find they must find it expensive because
              I mean if they're keeping that house on ... they have to have
              somebody going in to look at it, won't they?
              [8644] And they'll have a home in Nairobi.
Ann (PS14B)   [8645] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8646] Still it must pay them, must pay them to do that.
Ann (PS14B)   [8647] Oh ... what's Paul doing?
Betty (PS15U) [8648] Perfectly honest I don't know he spends a lot of time
              [laughing] in there [] .
Ann (PS14B)   [8649] [laugh] Oh I wa I was wa
Betty (PS15U) [8650] I don't quite know what he does sometimes
Ann (PS14B)   [8651] I was watching for him erm I'd been to the loo and I
              glanced out the er landing window and I thought it looked too
              tall for you.
              [8652] I thought it was his shape moving behind your kitchen net
              curtain and er I thought oh I'll dash and ask him now about those
              car mats so I can go and get them.
Betty (PS15U) [8653] Well I, tell him what kind of car it is.
Ann (PS14B)   [8654] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8655] Erm
Ann (PS14B)   [8656] Well this is, this is why I thought perhaps erm ... I
              didn't want to ask Jim too much or he would know I was buying
              them for him you see.
Betty (PS15U) [8657] That's right yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8658] And I remember this time in Winners when he, he picked
              them up and looked at them and said I don't think these are the
              right ones for my car and that, that's why I thought
Betty (PS15U) [8659] They were too small you see, weren't they?
Ann (PS14B)   [8660] and I was thinking where on earth is there a shop in [...]
              that sells, sells things like that or do you have to go to a
              garage and I'd forgotten that that fruit
Betty (PS15U) [8661] Yes
Ann (PS14B)   [8662] shop was one now.
Betty (PS15U) [8663] Yes it's, it's very useful actually.
              [8664] I've been up there buying things for him in the past when
              he was er operating the taxi and he hadn't time to go himself.
Ann (PS14B)   [8665] Yeah
Betty (PS15U) [8666] And er if they haven't got it they'll get it for you.
              [8667] They're very good.
Ann (PS14B)   [8668] Mm
Betty (PS15U) [8669] Yeah
Ann (PS14B)   [8670] You mean if they haven't got any I'll have to make a
              model.
              [8671] I bought him one Christmas years and oh hey, we were just
              married and I ordered him an extending ladder from the Co-op
Betty (PS15U) [8672] Mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8673] and I ordered it in November, it finally came in February.
              [8674] So I bought
Betty (PS15U) [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [8675] him something else for Christmas, something smaller and I
              made him a model out of matchsticks and I said this is the
              prototype
Betty (PS15U) [8676] Oh my
Ann (PS14B)   [8677] of your Christmas present!
              [8678] [laugh] I
Betty (PS15U) [8679] goodness!
              [8680] That would need some concentration
Ann (PS14B)   [8681] I, I just sort of made erm two short ladders about two
              inches long.
Betty (PS15U) [8682] Oh right.
Ann (PS14B)   [8683] I think I did it with a pair of tweezers to, so I could
              stick the
Betty (PS15U) [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [8684] matchsticks together and then I stuck one half on top of
              the other to make it look like an [laughing] extending ladder []
              .
Betty (PS15U) [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8685] Yes

              market committee because his daughter had a

Ann (PS14B)   [8708] jewellery stall.

              and erm son-in-law having a stall and [...] is one of the markets
              where he intends to trade in and erm he thinks
Ann (PS14B)   [8710] This is
Betty (PS15U) [8711] that the [clears throat] he'll be sort of for a right.
Ann (PS14B)   [8712] She's on the council, the town council, his daughter.
Betty (PS15U) [8713] Is she?
Ann (PS14B)   [8714] Fiona yes.

              single thing yet but er
Betty (PS15U) [8716] [laugh] She turns up?
Ann (PS14B)   [8717] Yes.

              related to Ian
Betty (PS15U) [8723] Erm he got a lot of flack
Ann (PS14B)   [8724] But let's face it

Ann (PS14B)   [8733] she gave up her flat and went to live with her mother.
Betty (PS15U) [8734] Mm

              was divorced so she married him, she immediately got a house
Betty (PS15U) [8736] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8737] no, she had a house to start with.

              aerobics so I can stick mine [laughing] in the microwave to warm
              up [] .

              market traders were all on strike and you know all those months
              the [...]
Betty (PS15U) [clears throat]
Ann (PS14B)   [8769] er and there was only the two fruit stalls there
Betty (PS15U) [8770] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [8771] and occasionally the fish st well
Betty (PS15U) [8772] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8773] yes occasionally three fruit stalls and one fish stall,
              she said er the market, the market hadn't ceased trading,
              trading, it was perfectly healthy it was doing very well!
              [8774] Cos I thought, I
Betty (PS15U) [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8775] thought where have you been?
              [8776] I mean there had been how many?
              [8777] Ninety was it?
Betty (PS15U) [8778] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8779] Sometimes a hundred.
Betty (PS15U) [8780] Mm mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8781] And er four stalls at the most there and according to her
              it was perfectly healthy and there was nothing wrong with it.
              [8782] I thought, and then I happened to go, Jim came to carry
              the fruit and vegetables for me and when it had opened again, and
              there was she with this, I looked at Jim and I said ah!
              [8783] That's why she said that she's got this jewellery stall.
Betty (PS15U) [8784] Oh!
              [8785] I didn't know what stall, type of stall she had I just
              read about it in the paper [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8786] I haven't had a proper look around the market for ... I
              looked
Betty (PS15U) [8787] I went down
Ann (PS14B)   [8788] I looked at the buttons next to the fruit stall because
              what I usually do I go and get the fruit and vegetables, if Jim's
              on the right shift he takes them home, otherwise I buy them while
              it's quieter, the man keeps them for me, I go straight across the
              leisure centre to soft clay cos it's only open on Wednesdays and
              then on the way back one of them walks
Betty (PS15U) [8789] Oh you put them in the pram.
Ann (PS14B)   [8790] and I put the fruit and [laughing] vegetables in the buggy
              [] and we come straight home cos it's time to eat by then.
Betty (PS15U) [8791] Mm mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8792] I'll have another cigarette and then I must dash.
Betty (PS15U) [8793] Yes I'm going to the street and getting an early lunch and
              getting myself organized for ... going out.
Ann (PS14B)   [8794] What time are you to go up?
Betty (PS15U) [8795] Well half past two I usually erm
Ann (PS14B)   [8796] Dorothy was telling me [laughing] this morning [] you know
              when we were at erm nursery?
Betty (PS15U) [8797] Mm mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8798] [lighting cigarette] That's lit erm ... I heard Mrs you've
              got your hands full there.
              [8799] Dorothy told me why.
              [8800] She'd er Mrs had asked James to close the cupboard and he
              called her a [laughing] stupid idiot [] .

              [8803] Oh that's gone out.

              so Dorothy's not pleased.

Ann (PS14B)   [8810] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8811] I mean it's good for them learning to be amongst a lot of
              children and they soon learn that erm they can't have their way.
Ann (PS14B)   [8812] Well her boys are quite amenable really but erm

Ann (PS14B)   [8827] Yeah Bryony went if you, well she's not so bad now she's
              got over that phase where she refused to have her coat on, but if
              you're trying to get her ready erm and she doesn't want to get
              ready, she'll say either go away or don't do that to me if I'm
              trying to get her coat on.
Betty (PS15U) [8828] [laugh] Oh dear!

Ann (PS14B)   [8889] she's got, yes, have you seen her
Betty (PS15U) [8890] No I haven't
Ann (PS14B)   [8891] eldest daughter,
Betty (PS15U) [8892] I don't know
Ann (PS14B)   [8893] Ruth, you know the one I used to look after?
              [8894] Well, when she first left her husband she moved in with
              Shirley
Betty (PS15U) [8895] With Shirley yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8896] and er how did they all fit in that house?
Betty (PS15U) [8897] I don't know [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)   [8898] [laugh] Cos there was Shirley and Jimmy, and Ann and
              Sarah, and Judith, and Ruth and Christopher, and Christopher was
              ... was Christopher nine?
              [8899] ... Or was he at road, by then?
              [8900] Erm Ruth was definitely at Goosehill School.
              [8901] She's very tall, very slim and very, very attractive.
              [8902] She's really pretty.
Betty (PS15U) [8903] Mm I don't know
Ann (PS14B)   [8904] And Christ Christopher's six foot something and a very
              handsome young man.
Betty (PS15U) [8905] And does her sister work?
Ann (PS14B)   [8906] Well this is what I was wondering because
Betty (PS15U) [8907] Mm [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8908] because Shirley seems to have been looking after, anyway
              she married this ... Robert
Betty (PS15U) [8909] Mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8910] apparently she used to go out with him before she married
              ... Derek, I think her first husband was called.
              [8911] And now she's got er Rona and Sophie ... I can't remember
              the boy's name.
Betty (PS15U) [8912] So she's got six children altogether?
              [8913] She had three to her first marriage.
Ann (PS14B)   [8914] I can't no, she's got Ruth and Christopher, Judith's the
              mother
Betty (PS15U) [8915] Oh!
              [8916] Oh right.
Ann (PS14B)   [8917] She's got Ruth,a Shirley's Ann, to me, looks more like
              Judith than she looks like her mother.
Betty (PS15U) [8918] Oh right!
              [8919] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8920] Except of course, Ann's blonde and
Betty (PS15U) [8921] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8922] er ... Shirley's black, or it was.
              [8923] She seems to have gone very grey very quickly.
Betty (PS15U) [8924] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)   [8925] You know, really, really quickly.
Betty (PS15U) [8926] Well I, I suppo this is her sister you're talking about?
Ann (PS14B)   [8927] Mm mm.
              [8928] No!
              [8929] Shirley herself.
Betty (PS15U) [8930] Shirley.
              [8931] Oh I hadn't noticed it [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8932] Yeah, her sister's got slightly lighter hair than, than
              Shirley had.
Betty (PS15U) [8933] I do I don't know her sister much.
Ann (PS14B)   [8934] But I think they live at Pegswood.
              [8935] But the other thing is, Judith's husband plays ... in a
              band ... now ... I'd, I th it might be a pipe band, I'm not sure
Betty (PS15U) [8936] Oh!
Ann (PS14B)   [8937] and he travels arou they go ... or is it a [...] band?
              [8938] [laughing] I don't know [] , erm but he sometimes goes
              abroad with it I think, but he, he goes to different parts of the
              country and Judith goes with him.
              [8939] I know erm when there was only Ruth and Christopher ...
              before Judith had Rona, they sometimes used to come and stay with
              Shirley.
              [8940] I would think it would be easier for [laughing] Shirley to
              go to their house [] to look after them now.
Betty (PS15U) [8941] I'd have thought so, yes, yeah.
Ann (PS14B)   [8942] But I think, I think
Betty (PS15U) [8943] Does, does the boy come to this, the, the girl come to
              this school?
Ann (PS14B)   [8944] No, erm the little ones?
Betty (PS15U) [8945] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)   [8946] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8947] Oh and they live at Pegswood, do they?
Ann (PS14B)   [8948] Well
Betty (PS15U) [8949] I just think they might [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8950] I wonder well they did, they certainly were living in
              Pegswood, but I've noticed when they bring the children to school
              the car frequently comes along the river way.
Betty (PS15U) [8951] Oh they must live down there somewhere or maybe ... I mean

Ann (PS14B)   [8952] So that to come ... that way
Betty (PS15U) [8953] they've gotta be, they're coming from the bottom of
              Bennet's Walk or from
Ann (PS14B)   [8954] Or from
Betty (PS15U) [8955] [...] Courts [...] street
Ann (PS14B)   [8956] or from up the hill or somewhere, yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8957] Mm
Ann (PS14B)   [8958] Or unless they come from Stobb Hill and come by the
              station and over the crossing.
Betty (PS15U) [8959] Well that means they've gotta come over the crossing.
Ann (PS14B)   [8960] I know but it's, it's sometimes
Betty (PS15U) [8961] Gotta be quicker!
Ann (PS14B)   [8962] it's sometimes very difficult to
Betty (PS15U) [8963] The traffic!
Ann (PS14B)   [8964] turn into Goose Hill off erm
Betty (PS15U) [8965] That's right
Ann (PS14B)   [8966] off the main road.
              [8967] ... Right, I'd better go and get ready and go and get
              those car mats.
Betty (PS15U) [8968] Well make sure you get the right ones.
Ann (PS14B)   [8969] I know.
Betty (PS15U) [8970] Ask, can these be changed if they're not right?
Ann (PS14B)   [laugh]
Betty (PS15U) [8971] Keep the bill.
Ann (PS14B)   [8972] Yes.
Betty (PS15U) [8973] Keep the bill.
Ann (PS14B)   [8974] I'll take the jars.
              [8975] I've got some jars there's s bottles and things for the
              erm
Betty (PS15U) [8976] I've got milk bottles that I, you know, when I bought the
              odd bottle [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8977] I've still, oh
Betty (PS15U) [8978] and I don't know wh how to get rid of them!
Ann (PS14B)   [8979] I've still got one milk bottle left.
Betty (PS15U) [8980] Well I've got three because sometimes they, they haven't
              got milk in the Co-op and they haven't got milk in the, in
              Iceland
Ann (PS14B)   [8981] Mm
Betty (PS15U) [8982] I call at Louie's and he
Ann (PS14B)   [8983] Oh!
Betty (PS15U) [8984] had bottled milk.
Ann (PS14B)   [8985] I didn't know they sold them.
Betty (PS15U) [8986] Yes!
              [8987] Yes.
              [8988] Erm so I've bought a few bottles and I don't [...]
Ann (PS14B)   [8989] Well take them, take them back.
              [8990] Is there a crate there or what?
              [8991] Take them back there.
Betty (PS15U) [8992] Oh I never thought!
              [8993] Yes, I never thought.
              [8994] That's an idea.
Ann (PS14B)   [8995] I wonder if that has, does that milkman still come round
              here?
              [8996] Has he got any [laughing] customers left [] ?
Betty (PS15U) [8997] I don't [...] I think he does, I think he comes late at
              night, Paul er said cos sometimes he's up watching videos or
              whatever
Ann (PS14B)   [8998] Oh I've heard the milkman
Betty (PS15U) [8999] erm
Ann (PS14B)   [9000] I've heard bottles rattling early in the morning but I,
              sort of one o'clock, two o'clock but I hadn't
Betty (PS15U) [9001] cos I was sort of lying in bed sort of late
Ann (PS14B)   [9002] noticed who it was
Betty (PS15U) [9003] one night when Paul came up and I wasn't asleep and I saw
              like ... this bright light
Ann (PS14B)   [9004] Mm
Betty (PS15U) [9005] and Paul was coming up the stairs, I said is that the
              police, is that a police car?
              [9006] And er ... he said no, it'll be the milk, it's the
              milkman, he comes at this time.
              [9007] So it must be that one
Ann (PS14B)   [9008] Mm mm
Betty (PS15U) [9009] because the other chap comes about half past eight in the
              morning, nine o'clock.

Ann (PS14B)                          [9631] she said yeah, she, erm, the reason
                                     that women who does the earrings couldn't
                                     make them for me, was that she buys all
                                     the parts, well the flower earrings she
                                     makes, she buys all these parts and she ex
                                     assembles them which ever parts you want
James (PS14C)                        [9632] mm, mm
Ann (PS14B)                          [9633] the colours and everything and the
                                     order you want them, but the little
                                     figures ... erm, she buys them and she
                                     just paints them, and that's how she could
                                     make er the ones for Shirley er for me,
                                     erm ... she gets little soldiers and she
                                     can paint them in the camouflage dress
James (PS14C)                        [9634] yes
Ann (PS14B)                          [9635] you know the, er the para smock and
                                     er
James (PS14C)                        [9636] with the red hat, and [laughing]
                                     she dyes the red hat []
Ann (PS14B)                          [9637] but in, no it's not red, it'll, I
                                     think it's military police, erm, that's
                                     how she can do it with er, erm a maroon
                                     beret, because she said to me did I want a
                                     peaked cap? and I said no the, the er, erm
                                     maroon beret, so it shows its the
                                     parachute regiment
James (PS14C)                        [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [9638] what, oh, erm, there's something
                                     I've just thought of though, when they
                                     wear the er camouflage things, is that
                                     when they wear the maroon belt round?,
                                     isn't the kaki belt with the dress
                                     uniform?
James (PS14C)                        [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [9639] anyway she said, er Catherine said
                                     she was surprised that the woman couldn't
                                     do it for me, before the end of June
James (PS14C)                        [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [9640] but Catherine, cos I didn't know
                                     Catherine sells stuff for her
James (PS14C)                        [9641] that's nice
Ann (PS14B)                          [9642] that's how Catherine gets such a
                                     lot of stuff by post she, she actually
James (PS14C)                        [9643] I know she does, she does
Ann (PS14B)                          [9644] and, er, ah but you spoke to
                                     Catherine on the phone and I was out, and
                                     you didn't tell me that part, and erm
James (PS14C)                        [9645] you sure I didn't
Ann (PS14B)                          [9646] but Catherine hasn't got her number
James (PS14C)                        [9647] you have
Ann (PS14B)                          [9648] well I have because we have erm,

                                     her tonight about something ... I think
                                     what Catherine must of done was, well she
                                     must of send orders to her by post

Ann (PS14B)                          [9650] cos they're not X directory if we
                                     can get hold of the number, er ... so
                                     she's going to say to her could she do it
                                     any quicker and I said well ... the woman
                                     said if she could do it any quicker she
                                     would ring me, she asked for me phone
                                     number.

                                     really niggly!
                                     [10503] Well James was.
                                     [10504] I thought maybe he was getting the
                                     same as Richard and Bryony had had, but
                                     he's cheered up.
Kathy (PS16G)                        [10505] You've cheered up, have you?

Ann (PS14B)                          [10510] Yes, we had a carry-on at, at
                                     dinner-time.
                                     [10511] He would not stop hitting,
                                     slapping Richard across the face.
Kathy (PS16G)                        [10512] Oh!
                                     [10513] I don't like the sound of that!
Ann (PS14B)                          [10514] So I, I made him swap places as,
                                     er, with Bryony and of course he wou he
                                     wasn't sitting there!
                                     [10515] He was gonna sit in his own seat.
                                     [10516] I said you can't cos you keep
                                     hitting Richard in the face for nothing!
                                     [10517] You won't let him eat his dinner!
Kathy (PS16G)                        [10518] Was he, was he
Ann (PS14B)                          [10519] So
Kathy (PS16G)                        [10520] naughty to you?
Ann (PS14B)                          [10521] so Richard's crying because he'd
                                     been hitting him the face.
                                     [10522] He's howling and scr w wailing cos

Ann (PS14B)                          [10524] So he ate his tea later ... and
                                     then he said to me ... I'm not gonna hit
                                     him any more.
                                     [10525] He didn't at teatime, did you?

                                     and Richard tried to tidy it up.
                                     [10530] ... Well I tried to tidy it up
                                     before we went to school and they were

                                     Bryony's got her shoe on.

James (PS14C)                        [10806] If I'd been in earlier I might've

James (PS14C)                        [10809] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10810] I just can't get close enough to

Maggie (PS17G)                       [10843] Do you have any more work to do?
James (PS14C)                        [10844] Well
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10845] When, when [...]
James (PS14C)                        [...]
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10846] You could hear such cheer when
                                     they, when they got the goal.
James (PS14C)                        [10847] Oh it was a great goal was that,
                                     wasn't it?
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10848] It was, yeah and erm there was
                                     only Jim and I watching, the dog was lying
                                     peacefully [laugh] then he jumped up [...]
                                     he started barking he didn't
Ann (PS14B)                          [laugh]
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10849] know what was going on.
James (PS14C)                        [10850] Peter selling er, er a ticket to
                                     go, he didn't watch it.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10851] Jim says no, Kath's asked him if
                                     he would like to go but [...] he wanted to
                                     go down to Wembley er ... get yourself
                                     away!
                                     [10852] If you can, if you can get
                                     yourself a ticket.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10853] Mm.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10854] Er he probably thinks he could get
                                     one through [...] but he says no, I've
                                     been once.
                                     [10855] But the second time, they tell me,
                                     isn't as good as the first time when you
                                     go.
Ann (PS14B)                          [laugh]
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10856] She says, well it's your team!
                                     [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [10857] Yes!
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10858] cos it wasn't Sunderland that he
                                     went to see when he got the ticket the
                                     last time.
                                     [10859] I can't remember who he said it
                                     was ... but erm ... [...] I've always
                                     fancied going [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [10860] So you get yourself down there,
                                     then.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10861] [...] Sunderland were there.
                                     [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                          [10862] Oh.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10863] I wouldn't have been bothered
                                     about any other ... cos you see it better
                                     on the, on the screen.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10864] Yes.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [10865] Yes, you do.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10866] But you, you lose out a little bit
                                     on the atmosphere.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10867] Yes.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10868] Unless you can create your own
                                     atmosphere.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10869] Well, that's it.
                                     [10870] I mean you should have all your
                                     friends and neighbours in and have a
                                     party!
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10871] Well the last the last time when
                                     Sunderland got to the Final in seventy-
                                     three ... er there were five of us in the,
                                     in my house and I'd made red and white
                                     rosettes [laugh]
Ann (PS14B)                          [laugh]
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10872] we had our red and white rosettes
                                     and when our, I was sitting watching the
                                     match and when they scored the goal my
                                     slippers went up in the air.
Ann (PS14B)                          [laugh]
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10873] And Jim er Bill grabbed the camera
                                     that was on the mantlepiece and he got a
                                     shot, not of me, but he got a shot of Pat
                                     and her friend and Bryan and er, it was
                                     er, er, something I'll never forget.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10874] Mm.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10875] [...] it really was ... So erm ...
                                     but I don't know, I, I think if Jim got a
                                     ticket, if he got two tickets and he said
                                     [...] do you wanna come?
                                     [10876] I would
Ann (PS14B)                          [10877] Mm.

                                     certainly wouldn't go without Jim, without
                                     somebody else.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10879] Mm.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10880] But I'll have to get me red and
                                     white coat out again [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [10881] Well you wor work on, work on Jim!
                                     [10882] I mean Pat said he can go so ...
                                     tell him to get two tickets and you'll go
                                     with him. ...
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10883] [...] red and white scarf [...]
                                     got plenty of other reds [laugh]

Maggie (PS17G)                       [10885] I could, I could quickly get a
                                     Sunderland scarf, believe me, Ann.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10886] Mm.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10887] There's shop in [...] sells them.

                                     full of stuff upstairs belonging to him I
                                     don't know if there's anything in there.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10890] Do you remember when we used to
                                     [...]

James (PS14C)                        [10899] Well, you know, apart from
                                     anything else they always [...] they were
                                     prepared to give me free tickets for the
                                     [...] would never do that.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10900] Yes, I know [...]
James (PS14C)                        [10901] [...] I mean Newcastle, we went to
                                     Newcastle and they showed us round the
                                     ground er ... when there was no match on
                                     and we saw the trophies and the directors'
                                     box and various places like that.
                                     [10902] But they wouldn't let us in, if we

                                     [10903] But er, Sunderland gave us free

                                     taxation.
James (PS14C)                        [10935] That's right.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10936] And that er they would be worse
                                     off because he said even staff nurses are

                                     have to get into that bracket if you get
                                     twenty thousand a year.

                                     objected to this,
Ann (PS14B)                          [10944] And of course he had the nurses'

                                     was ringing them.
                                     [10947] Where's me purse?
James (PS14C)                        [10948] [...] [...] make an announcement

                                     [10949] There was no announcement made at
                                     the end of the programme so, and they
                                     never got back to me, so I rang this
                                     morning first thing and last night they
                                     didn't ask me my name and address, but
                                     this morning they did.
                                     [10950] They got me name and address and
                                     telephone number at work and at home so
                                     [...] I told the unions that they had to
                                     write in and complain about it too.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10951] Mm.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10952] There you are.
James (PS14C)                        [...]

Ann (PS14B)                          [cough]
James (PS14C)                        [10955] who was sitting in the audience
                                     who is a nurse ... and er would've known
                                     and she would've been trying to get in and
                                     say this is not true.
                                     [10956] [...] But she did ask a question,
                                     she was the first question that was asked,
                                     the one about erm
Ann (PS14B)                          [10957] Yes, but that's all very well but,
                                     bout, but er
James (PS14C)                        [10958] it's too late then, that's what A
                                     Angie said, Angie said, you know they,
                                     they make this and it's too late you can't
                                     undo the, the, it's a lie!
Ann (PS14B)                          [10959] That's right!
                                     [10960] So there's half the country
                                     thinking staff nurses are earning well
                                     over twenty thousand are owning, earning
                                     over twenty thousand.
                                     [10961] Your Pat said to me on Sunday
                                     while I was talking to her, she said, when
                                     she was saying oh well she doesn't know
                                     whether to vote Tory because
James (PS14C)                        [10962] They've never been so well off.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10963] she's done quite well under them.
                                     [10964] As Jim said, in six months time if
                                     he's redundant she won't be feeling
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10965] Yes
Ann (PS14B)                          [10966] the same.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10967] it's true.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10968] But she said, I said oh
James (PS14C)                        [10969] It was the La it was Will Owen and
                                     the Labour government that brought [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [10970] I said oh Pat just, just, I said
                                     have you spoken to a nurse recently?
                                     [10971] ... You know, how demoralised they
                                     are and the state of the hospitals and
                                     things and she said, oh well, nurses er,
                                     they, they've always complained that
                                     they're hard up and,
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10972] And they always have been.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10973] and the rest of it.
                                     [10974] So, talk some sense into her will
                                     you?
                                     [10975] Just point out that they might be
                                     redundant and
James (PS14C)                        [10976] Well, if the Tories win, I mean
                                     the privatization will really go to town.
                                     [10977] I mean even the trusts.
                                     [10978] The ambulance men in
                                     Northumberland because it's a trust ...
                                     and they're paid by the trust
Ann (PS14B)                          [10979] That was another thing he said,
                                     wasn't it?
James (PS14C)                        [10980] They, they
Ann (PS14B)                          [10981] That they privatized erm ambulance
                                     service, they're now the highest paid in
                                     the country.
James (PS14C)                        [10982] Which is
Ann (PS14B)                          [10983] and Jim, Jim's got their pay scale
                                     and, and
James (PS14C)                        [10984] Well the trust [...] paying them
Ann (PS14B)                          [10985] They're being paid,
James (PS14C)                        [10986] less!
Ann (PS14B)                          [10987] they're being paid less than the N
                                     H S
James (PS14C)                        [10988] Than, than the N H S!
Ann (PS14B)                          [10989] ones!
James (PS14C)                        [10990] I mean just across, if they go
                                     down to Durham which is an N H S ...
                                     ambulance service.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10991] And that's, you know, anybody
                                     listening to that on the television would
                                     think, oh yes, that's true!
                                     [10992] You know it's, it's
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10993] [...] over there and you er
                                     believe everything they've said.
Ann (PS14B)                          [10994] once it's stuck in their head then
                                     it's like reading things in the
                                     newspapers.
James (PS14C)                        [10995] What, what am I going for?
Maggie (PS17G)                       [10996] Cigarettes.

                                     is.
James (PS14C)                        [11000] Forty Elite?
Ann (PS14B)                          [11001] If you get to the Victoria Wine in
                                     time.
                                     [11002] ... I don't know if he will.
                                     [11003] I don't know if it shuts at five
                                     o'clock or what they do ... or if evening
                                     staff come on?
                                     [11004] I've never tried to go after ...
                                     five o'clock.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11005] Mind you, Ann, I suppose that's
                                     why Pat got thinking about a Tory er vote.
Ann (PS14B)                          [11006] No, she wasn't thinking, well she
                                     wasn't exactly thinking about a Tory vote.
                                     [11007] She said, well I, I don't know
                                     what to do, she said, I haven't read, you
                                     know, she hadn't read the election, she
                                     hadn't had time to read the election
                                     addresses, and she's not really interested
                                     in ac actually so she hasn't watched it on
                                     the television.
                                     [11008] And I said, oh Pat, you don't want
                                     a Tory government in a again, do you?
                                     [11009] And she said, well, I I I don't
                                     know, she said, you know we've done
                                     alright under them.
                                     [11010] ... What does she think's
                                     happening to education?
                                     [11011] What does she think's ha happening
                                     to the hospitals?
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11012] I don't think, probably she hasn't
                                     really thought it, she's, she's been more
                                     concerned with her own self but she's ...
                                     .
                                     [11013] can't, I don't know.
                                     [11014] I'll have to have a talk with her.
Ann (PS14B)                          [11015] [laugh] Put your daughter
                                     straight!
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11016] [...] I've, I've ... I've often
                                     thought I would never vote Tory but, I
                                     mean, I've been better off in some ways in
                                     that I was able to buy my council house.
                                     [11017] But that, as far as I can make
                                     out, is the only thing that I've benefited
                                     by, you know, with them being in.
Ann (PS14B)                          [11018] Mm mm.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11019] erm
Ann (PS14B)                          [11020] The unemployed certainly haven't
                                     been better off.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11021] The, the thing is
Ann (PS14B)                          [11022] The young people leaving school
                                     haven't been better off.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11023] Well it would be erm, the number
                                     of people who are being put out of work
Ann (PS14B)                          [11024] Yeah.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11025] and it's not just every week or
                                     every month, it's every day, when you hear
                                     of jobs being lost
Ann (PS14B)                          [11026] That's right. ...
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11027] It's a, it's a [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [11028] And isn't it a hundred, hundred
                                     and, hundred and fifty small businesses go
                                     bust every year?
                                     [11029] I mean they keep saying we've
                                     given the all, all these opportunities to
                                     all these
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11030] [...] a case in point
Ann (PS14B)                          [11031] small businessmen and there's a
                                     hundred and fifty.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11032] She tried to get, she's tried to
                                     get started making, doing her own
                                     business, spoke to her the other day and
                                     she's, well, Pat spoke to her on Sunday
                                     and she got more out of her than I did
Ann (PS14B)                          [11033] Mm.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11034] but er, she's not getting [...]
Ann (PS14B)                          [11035] No.
                                     [11036] Paul next door left school, you
                                     know, he cou all he wanted to be was a
                                     mechanic, it's, it's all he's ever been,
                                     he's really good.
                                     [11037] But he's learnt from his father
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11038] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)                          [11039] and he couldn't a job and then, I
                                     me I mean, he tried for apprenticeships
                                     all over the place and other jobs and he
                                     just couldn't get one!
                                     [11040] When his father died, when he was
                                     twenty- one, he took over the erm taxi
                                     business.
                                     [11041] Well it was private hire, but most
                                     of the work came from Northgate Hospital.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11042] Mm mm.
Ann (PS14B)                          [11043] You know they, they ran, they took
                                     the nurses, because the nurses home was a
                                     mile or, was it a mile or a mile and a
                                     half or something from the hospital, they
                                     had this, they took them in the morning
                                     and then they took them at lunchtime and
                                     then all the different shifts coming on
                                     and off they took them, and they had the
                                     schools run as well.
                                     [11044] And then, of course the er, they
                                     started running down Northgate hospital
                                     and they closed down the nurses home.
                                     [11045] So there was half his business
                                     worked out, wiped out in one go.
                                     [11046] ... And then erm, his schools run
                                     was way up into the country, quite a long
                                     way ... and then that was changed.
                                     [11047] First of all th the erm
                                     registration went up, then something else
                                     went up and then ... two of his children
                                     from farthest away were moving so he was
                                     gonna be paid much less than that.
                                     [11048] Well the ordinary private hire,
                                     there's so many of them, I mean his dad
                                     had been doing it for years but there's so
                                     many started up.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11049] Yes.
Ann (PS14B)                          [11050] He couldn't compete!
                                     [11051] And, and then finally the council
                                     said, he actually had an Austin Princess,
                                     but you know Paul and his cars that that
                                     nineteen, I don't know what it is the car
                                     he's got in his garage now, but he buys
                                     old cars and completely rebuilds them, it
                                     looks like a new car now and he ha he had
                                     an Austin Princess which, which actually
                                     it was a P reg and er they told him he
                                     couldn't run the service unless he bought
                                     a much newer car.
                                     [11052] And he couldn't do it, because,
                                     the pair of them, I mean, that was, that
                                     business was supporting his mother as well
                                     and between them, after they'd paid for
                                     the petrol, they were taking in less than
                                     a hundred pounds a week and that was for
                                     the two of them.
Maggie (PS17G)                       [11053] Two.
Ann (PS14B)                          [11054] So he couldn't keep it going any

                                     [11128] Jim's actually running people from

                                     [11130] He'd been helping his wife to, she

                                     [11131] The only thing is in a place like

                                     [11132] However, Jim says he'll take them.

Alison (PS6NU)             [11199] No not really it's pretty low impact.
James (PS14M)              [...]

                           [11203] I wouldn't be able to do the you know the
                           really high very high impact.

Alison (PS6NU)             [11205] Well I mean I do I've been doing aerobics a
                           long time.
                           [11206] It's pretty easy for me that
Ann (PS14B)                [11207] Yeah.
Alison (PS6NU)             [11208] what she does but

Ann (PS14B)                [11210] And apart from the fact that you're less
                           than half [laughing] my age [] .
                           [11211] It helps doesn't it?
                           [11212] Although the intermediate class most of them
                           seem to be teenagers and twenties.
                           [11213] There's a few thirties and there's a couple
                           I think probably in their forties but when it comes
                           to the high impact they don't do it they just step
                           it out you know.
                           [11214] Erm

James (PS14M)              [11217] Push.
Ann (PS14B)                [11218] the advance class on a the first one on a
                           Friday morning is nearly all high impact.
Alison (PS6NU)             [11219] Is it?
Ann (PS14B)                [11220] There are very few floor exercises.
                           [11221] Well I wouldn't be able to do that.
                           [11222] But I can keep up with the intermediate
                           class and I said to Maxine, Does this get any
                           harder?
                           [11223] And she said, No we do different exercises
                           but there's this amount of high impact.
                           [11224] So.
                           [11225] Oh what's the mat

Alison (PS6NU)             [11229] Yeah.
Ann (PS14B)                [11230] Oh.
Alison (PS6NU)             [11231] He had a cold when he cut his bottom two and
                           his top ones are nearly through and he's getting
                           cold.

                           [11256] And she wouldn't have it brushed and she was
                           shaking her head about when you tried to brush it
                           so.

                           and you screamed didn't you?
                           [11937] You can't swing on the buggy handle it makes
                           it too heavy and it makes it tip up.

                           hanging the branch is hanging right down to the
                           river and the moorhen's standing on it.
                           [11947] That's right.
                           [11948] But I can't see any more moorhens and
                           there's usually a few more round if there's one.
                           [11949] But I can't see them.

                           [11961] Yes that's what kind's that one Bryony?
                           [11962] Bryony says she can see one in the sky.
                           [11963] What is it can you remember?
                           [11964] That's right it's a seagull.
                           [11965] There's another seagull.
                           [11966] That's a black-headed gull that one.
Richard (PS14P)            [11967] I want to see the one in the park.

                           very very very steep hill to get down the other side
                           to the birds.
                           [11974] Isn't it beautiful.

                           can't get I can't get this buggy up there up that
                           hill.

                           [11988] You wouldn't think it was the same month
                           would you?
                           [11989] Yes that's the weir.
Richard (PS14P)            [11990] I want to see the one in the park.
Ann (PS14B)                [11991] You want to see what?
                           [11992] But I've just explained about five times.
                           [11993] To go to the one in the park we'd have to go
                           up that hill and there's no way I can push this
                           buggy with Bryony in the front and all these fruit
                           and vegetables I couldn't get up and the hang on to
                           you two with your reins I couldn't get up that steep
                           hill.

                           telling you.
                           [11996] The best thing to do would be to come
                           tomorrow and we'll walk there without the buggy.
                           [11997] We can easily walk there and we can come in
                           the front we can come in the front gates of the park
                           and we don't have to go up great big steep hills do
