*PS04U:	He did n't want to go .  137707_138917

*PS04Y:	Have they .  613754_614464
*PS04U:	I mean you know it it 's unbelievable But .  614464_617714
*PS04Y:	Ooh I 'd like to know what their weird ideas are .  617724_621004
*PS04U:	Well it 's just erm ah I do n't know I mean there 's there 's certain things I mean it it 's like this maths I mean I I spoke to her erm and she said yes Lee had come on and everything in his maths and I said we the thing is I said knowing Lee has difficulty in in th l in the high level maths yes you do n't want to drop him but surely I said I 'm willing to help in my spare time Lee 's willing to do it and I said ca n't you show Lee I said I 'm not I was n't trying to tell her .  621004_654484
*PS04Y:	No .  654944_655014
*PS04U:	you know that what you were told .  655014_656284
*PS04Y:	No no no no no .  656284_656764
*PS04U:	and I think .  656764_657244
*PS04Y:	Yes well I think I told him a wrong you see there were two there there are two ways of tackling it and I do n't think the way I told him is what they want for the examination purposes at all .  657304_665624
*PS04U:	Oh I do n't know he under when you that told he understood it a lot more than when she said it and she sort of went all .  666484_675694
*PS04Y:	She 's probably trying to explain them in a very complicated way of doing maths .  675844_678984
*PS04U:	No she answered me she said well I have n't got time to sit down explain it to them they just got ta if they 're in a high level they should be able to grasp it and I .  678984_685834
*PS04Y:	Frankly I think that 's very bad .  685834_686874
*PS04U:	that 's no attitude .  686884_687584
*PS04Y:	you know that is no attitude That 's bad .  687594_690334
*PS04U:	You know the fact is they 've got to erm be explained .  690334_692084
*PS04Y:	Yes .  692084_692244
*PS04U:	Erm I mean Carla I ca n't fault her teachers .  692244_696484
*PS04Y:	No no .  696544_696954
*PS04U:	at that church one she has learnt so much erm I mean this to speak French now she speaking it in three weeks .  696954_704234
*PS04Y:	She 's excellent is n't she yes .  704674_706284
*PS04U:	You know it 's unbeliev .  706294_707244
*PS04Y:	Three weeks .  707394_707534
*PS04U:	three weeks that 's all she 's been doing it .  707574_709154
*PS04Y:	That 's marvellous .  709174_709624
*PS04U:	You know I mean but this teacher wo n't stand no nonsense and I said to Lee y you were at it three years before you could speak like Carla speaks it You know she has learnt so much Erm i in this school I mean .  709634_724024
*PS04Y:	Yes .  724474_724554
*PS04U:	they 're very strict I mean .  724554_725884
*PS04Y:	Yes .  725884_725924
*PS04U:	you know but I think half of Lee 's it there 's no discipline .  725924_728924
*PS04Y:	No ha .  729184_729804
*PS04U:	but then .  731434_731904
*PS04Y:	and when you try t in the past when I tried to find some way of imposing discipline there is no way because quite rightly you 're not allowed to strike children I never wanted to and I I hardly ever did at one school where there was a marvellous spirit of give and take I used to whip off my little black velvet slipper occasionally and whack some of the larger boys about the top of the thigh just for fun you know but I 'm not a believer in using your fists you ought to be using your brain to teach with but there were no there are no sanctions if you say you must stay behind after school you have to send a letter home and half the parents will write back and say my son or daughter is not staying after school and that is that .  731904_777454
*PS04U:	Mm .  777454_777674
*PS04Y:	And that 's their right and so you think of something else we you 're not allowed to take them out of a favourite lesson you 're not allowed to say you are going to miss your football or a P E P E teachers and the football teachers quite rightly say if you ca n't keep discipline in your class why why should we be penalized .  777674_796364
*PS04U:	Mm that 's right .  796624_797824
*PS04Y:	And er you 're pretty helpless really .  797834_800594
*PS04U:	You are .  800594_801414
*PS04Y:	You see the only way that you can really discipline them is when you have a school where the rules have been very very strict from the moment that they went into that school and they have had their noses held to the grindstone with work up to their brows and they just do n't think of being tiresome and anybody who is tiresome is pulled out and put in a special room on their own called a sin bin an which is rather boring and made to work even harder .  801464_827364
*PS04U:	Mm but no what I 'm sort of getting back I mean you know I do n't I think it 's the kids I mean I du n no why Whether they have too much or what they have but I mean they 're just they just think everybody owes them something and it 's like Neil I mean to me I mean I ca n't see why he ca n't get off his backside and go and work in a supermarket but it 's not the job they want the same answer I said to .  827674_852834
*PS04Y:	I think at the moment Brenda he would take any job if he could get one .  852834_856714
*PS04U:	He would take if offered it .  856714_857604
*PS04Y:	Yes I think so I .  857674_858554
*PS04U:	There 's a lot of I mean it 's like .  858554_860004
