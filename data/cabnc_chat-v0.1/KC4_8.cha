*NON:	That school like, Alexander goes to I mean it's a good place to go to isn't it? •_•
        If you can afford to send your kids there. •_•
        I would say there was more going on, going for them isn't there than •_•
*FRE:	Oh yes, yes. •_•
*NON:	than the old comprehensive schools. •_•
        Some are better than others of course but er •_•
*FRE:	I think that a big advantage if you wanting to get in very large areas like London and Birmingham. •_•
        I think that if the schools, I don't suppose that  kind of thing but erm, I mean the schools out in Surrey and all erm places like that. •_•
        When you get down there  they're much  much better than •_•
*NON:	Oh yes. •_•
        I mean we have a local school, Hayes School which is a very good comprehensive •_•
*FRE:	Mm. •_•
        All the comprehensives. •_•
*NON:	and everybody •_•
*FRE:	But I don't think parts of Croydon, south of Croydon, Birmingham  they're much better down there. •_•
*NON:	I mean people move in to Hayes specially so that their kids can go there. •_•
*FRE:	Yes. •_•
        I think generally speaking you erm schools out in the country are better. •_•
*NON:	Oh yes. •_•
        Mm •_•
*FRE:	Cos then you  •_•
*NON:	It's O K if your headmasters that run the school change I mean schools tend to change with headmasters don't they? •_•
*FRE:	Cos it'd be, I mean a big disadvantage to a lot of particular schools around this area is the number of erm Asian and •_•
*NON:	Yes. •_•
*FRE:	erm Indian. •_•
        I mean, they, they probably don't speak English and they're at at a disadvantage to start off with. •_•
*NON:	Yes. •_•
*FRE:	Which again is holding the others back. •_•
*NON:	Yes, yes. •_•
        changing headmasters at his school and they had a terrible reputation one time. •_•
*FRE:	Did it? •_•
*NON:	 (        )

*NON:	Yeah. •_•
*FRE:	behind the hall stand but mummy must have shifted it cos, shifted it with that er that bag of hers so I should ask mummy where it is. •_•
        Cos it was, I put it behind the hall stand. •_•
*NON:	O K. •_•
*NON:	But they had a new headmaster oh he's just retired, he's been there  been there since Lynn was there when  since she was  since the er she's twice that age so I mean he must have been there eighteen years but when he went there he's er totally  the school from the word go  •_•
*NON:	No, I got, I need to get some stuff out of the red one. •_•
*NON:	and it changed out of all recognition. •_•
        Now it's one of the, the best schools  for miles around. •_•
*FRE:	Is he er  is he due to retire or •_•
*NON:	yes he's just retired. •_•
*FRE:	He has just retired? •_•
*NON:	There's been a new headmaster for the last year I think so I don't know what he   •_•
*NON:	Bath now   •_•
*NON:	What did you say? •_•
*NON:	 (        )
