*LYN:	Hm. •944872_945042•
*NOR:	They have that particular one because the two little girls  wanted to be bridesmaid's , have just been bridesmaid's and have these dresses and Anna thought the colour was so pretty, cos she went into Laura Ashley and got one in the sale of  last years stock. •945352_965612•

*LYN:	Hm. •978972_979102•
*NOR:	And the same type of fabric as Anna's dress. •979552_982392•
*LYN:	I'm sure it'll look lovely, if it, I mean if you've got grown up bridesmaid's in every one, you will expect seeing   •983592_991292•
*NOR:	Anna actually chose the . •100325_100460•
*CHR:	I rather suspect that the, I even said about the strong colour of the net, I suspect, that when  •101095_101670•
*NOR:	Trouble with it? •101670_101713•
*CHR:	when it's a single thickness strong the colour won't be as strong as that anyway . •101713_102110•
