*CAR:	But I just wanted to see what it had downstairs, it was typically new, it's a, a lounge not much bigger than the one we've got now erm  in fact I think the lounge and the dining room area was probably a little bit smaller •248987_250346•
*SUS:	Yeah. •250392_250416•

*SUS:	I don't think anyone can sell anything at the moment. •252112_252670•
