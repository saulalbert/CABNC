*JON:	Yeah, I just bashed it out dad.I'm bashing that bit out. (.) Whoops!Sorry, I shouldn't do it the other side cos it wobbled.Pretty well look dad.
*FRA:	Yeah. (.)  (        )  (.)  ((banging))
*JON:	Cor!Daddy hold on to my back
*FRA:	Yeah
*JON:	cos I sure might fall. ((banging)) (.) Oops, and I     (        )  (.)  ((banging))Big noise isn't it? (.) Dad I want to screw it.
*FRA:	Yeah, I've just gotta get this bottom one out.Can you give it a tap underneath there?
*JON:	Oh yeah.
*FRA:	That piece.
*JON:	 (        )  (.)  ((banging))
*FRA:	That's it    (        )  (.) tap it up about here a minute.See this piece goes up?
*JON:	Yeah.
*FRA:	 (        )  (.)  ((banging))Right, and give it a bash that way now.
*JON:	But the screw on the top   (.) cos I can only screw  (        ) 
*FRA:	 (        )  (.) 
*JON:	Mum, look what I had to do.
*LYN:	Oh   (        )  (.) 
*JON:	 (        )  (.)  ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Mm
*LYN:	 (        )  (.)  ((banging))
*JON:	I'm just seeing if I can get these two shelves out.
*LYN:	Well you give it a good bash then. (.)  ((banging))
*JON:	Look I'm turning it that way.
*LYN:	That would be  (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah     (        )  (.)  ((banging))
*LYN:	 (        ) the ceiling  (.) 
*FRA:	I don't think it's fixed to the ceiling actually that, I think it's just purely a   (.) a framework bol 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	nailed to the wall   (        ) 
*JON:	It's only a piece of wood that's   (.) do you know what that is? (.) That's only  (.) 
*LYN:	So you could take the framework off the front
*FRA:	Yeah I think that's just 
*LYN:	which leaves the superstructure on   (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah   (.) Screwdriver's   (        )  (.) 
*JON:	Now that must be wobbly.
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	 (        )  (.) 
*JON:	That won't come off.Well these shelves won't come off.
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Should happen    (        )  (.) now it's got bended.
*FRA:	Well   (        )  (.) 
*JON:	Mum do you like the sound?
*LYN:	 [laughing] No  [] 
*JON:	Then   (.) cover up the ears. (.)  (        ) it's okay now.
*FRA:	It always amazes me   (        ) build things like that  (        ) 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah.
*LYN:	So how does that come off the wall, the wooden  (        ) ?
*FRA:	It's held on  (        ) , it's gonna take some doing actually.
*LYN:	What the wooden part?
*FRA:	Those slats, this back piece
*LYN:	Yeah
*FRA:	are nailed to the wall  (        ) 
*JON:	Yeah and that's only wall 
*LYN:	Well, well I was just maybe wondering whether you might use a part of that to support the new cabinet   (        ) 
*JON:	Do you know that's only wall   (.) that bit is only wall.
*FRA:	Ten to one it won't match.
*LYN:	too terrible to get off.
*JON:	Listen listen please 
*FRA:	Oh it's, you know   (        ) 
*JON:	That's only wall 
*LYN:	 (        ) Only wall?
*JON:	Yeah, it's only   (        )  (.) 
*LYN:	Right   (        ) do for that cos   (        ) might  (        ) 
*FRA:	I don't whether, I'm trying to think if he goes
*LYN:	I don't know, I can't keep up with him but I expect    (        )  (.) I think  (        ) 
*JON:	 ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	Don't fall, you're hardly on the stool Jon.Erm  (.) 
*JON:	Ah!
*LYN:	When they done those windows down the bottom there it sounded though they were in   (.) right next door.
*FRA:	Mm.
*JON:	But you look there   (.) that's wall  (.) 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	those bits should come out.
*FRA:	Oh don't knock this though cos  (        ) 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Why?
*FRA:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Because look  (.) 
*LYN:	 (        )  (.)  (        ) if it's  (        ) 
*JON:	Those are very useful.
*LYN:	Do you realize that?You can have  (        ) , you can take them  (        ) 
*FRA:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Yes   (.) but the thing is what I would really like   (.) is get two there   (.) then waddle it in   (.) one there   (.) and then 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	waddle it in on there.
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	No I want them like that. (.) Dad could you nail them like   (        ) 
*FRA:	No I haven't got any nails have I? (.) 
*JON:	Why? (.) 
*FRA:	 (        ) say why I just haven't got any. (.) 
*JON:	Well I just want them there   (.) now I'm going to hammer them.
