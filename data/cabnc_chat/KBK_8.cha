*LYN:	Oh dear. •214151_214195•

*LYN:	Manhattan? •216446_216492•
*CHR:	Manhattan yes. •216492_216569•
*LYN:	How were they? •216603_216701•
*CHR:	I thoroughly enjoyed it. •216711_216832•
        I thought it was great. •216841_216928•
*LYN:	Oh that's good. •216950_216993•
*CHR:	In fact I was quite a busy little bee last night. •216993_217302•
        Fixed to go and have a game of croquet on Saturday afternoon. •217359_217622•
*LYN:	Oh you said you were, you were threatening to do that weren't you? •217650_217939•
*CHR:	Yes. •217939_217973•
        yes. •218046_218057•
        ought to have a go. •218256_218317•
*LYN:	Where are you playing croquet? •218323_218557•
*CHR:	Oh Dulwich my dear. •218643_218729•
*LYN:	Dulwich. •218765_218790•
        With She. •218868_218889•
*CHR:	Pardon? •219074_219089•
        She? •219127_219166•
        Ah yes, I I . •219166_219314•
*LYN:	Shall I put the kettle on? •219495_219611•
*CHR:	Yes please dear lovely. •219611_219695•
        I wouldn't er, I wouldn't trust her with mallet. •219740_219965•
        Oh I've got bags of time I reckon to make notes on what I'm doing as we talk here. •220740_221145•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes, oh yes it's all sort of, relatively complex stuff. •221336_221728•
        You, you read that did you? •222081_222176•
*LYN:	Yes. •222191_222200•
        Did they send you the Walkman as well? •222218_222434•
*CHR:	Oh yes I've got that. •222555_222659•
        And I've got boxes of, two boxes of tapes. •222659_222967•
*LYN:	Why do they trust you? •223035_223148•
*CHR:	I wondered. •223200_223341•
        I must say I wondered. •223358_223463•
        Yeah, I mean you're not particularly trad jazz inclined anyway are you? •223532_224098•
*LYN:	Oh I like trad jazz I don't like modern jazz at all. •224098_224271•
        But I like trad jazz I mean that was, there was a great, there was a trad jazz  era in the sixties •224352_224902•
*CHR:	Mm. •224958_224983•
*LYN:	and we were all very . •225038_225142•
*CHR:	Well there's the programme. •225271_225850•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes. •225980_225989•
*LYN:	
*CHR:	He lives there. •226006_226094•
        I had a chat with him last night. •226188_226344•
        And er he sort of admitted that he lives absolutely on the fringe of the no go area. •226412_226881•
        Mm look at it, I mean the name of his house Wit's End. •227010_227203•
        He's a very odd character. •227337_227492•
*LYN:	Yes. •227492_227507•
*CHR:	Out of interest, how much do you charge for your do? •227604_227807•
*LYN:	Erm  no I didn't,Plum actually did the organizing. •227807_228190•
        I think, I think it was about two hundred and forty pounds •228195_228656•
*CHR:	Right. •228698_228714•
*LYN:	but don't quote me on it. •228714_228809•
        It might have been more it might have been •228832_228936•
*NOR:	Somebody mentioned the figure of three hundred pounds. •228979_229158•
*CHR:	For a jazz  •229168_229227•
*NOR:	Mm. •229351_229357•
        Does that sound right? •229357_229548•
*LYN:	It sounds a bit of a  •229638_230008•
*NOR:	I don't know but that, that price, somebody in conversation mentioned it. •230153_230610•
*LYN:	Yes. •230610_230628•
        But they, of course they may be now cos we booked them back in Feb •230664_230991•
*NOR:	Yes. •231015_231050•
*CHR:	Yes. •231066_231082•
*LYN:	and. •231102_231150•
        But they were only relatively cheap because at the time I made that  change  musician  union. •231233_231776•
        So they weren't charging union rates and we got them relatively cheap. •231852_232215•
*NOR:	Maybe whoever was telling me was making a  •232295_232647•
*CHR:	Well when you look at how busy a programme they've got. •232891_233194•
        You can't, it's difficult to believe why they don't charge full whack. •233255_233681•
        I mean it was very interesting in the Crown last night because apparently they, they normally have some rhythm and blues and soul and things like that on a Thursday. •233694_234528•
        And erm  the youngsters weren't objecting to their music. •234590_235078•
        I mean there were no real teeny boppers. •235078_235265•
        Erm but the the old grey hairs like me were leaping around and . •235296_235747•
        Yes alright. •235835_235993•
        Good morning Mr . •236037_236636•
