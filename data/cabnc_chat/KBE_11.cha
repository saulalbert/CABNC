*BET:	I know.
*UNK:	She doesn't come out?
*BET:	No. (.) 
*JUL:	I said to Sally I said I wouldn't be surprised if they two get married.I wouldn't be surprised.
*UNK:	 (        ) big plans to buy Christmas presents   ((laugh)) shudder. ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	About one hundred of them.
*BET:	Hmm.
*UNK:	Second children.
*BET:	Yeah.As you say.So they're second partners and their Mum and Dad.
*JUL:	Boy you think 
*BET:	Ten grand kids 
*JUL:	You think what my Aunty Carol's got to buy for.Now out of the family of  family
*UNK:	Oh don't talk to me.
*JUL:	 (        ) included there are about ten.
*BET:	Ann's got a   (        ) head on ain't she?
*UNK:	Why?
*BET:	Her sister   (.) I think put her  (        ) .Was moaning about she had to buy three Christmas presents and she only got two kids   (.) So Ann turned round and said oh you're fucking well mad I got to buy five presents and I've only got two kids.And she said not only that whenever my kids babysit for you you only give em a fiver each.Oh she had to buy five presents and she only had two kids.That's right.And Ann said well if you going to fucking be like that don't bother to buy my kids anything.I won't buy your kids anything.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BET:	She says and I will spent that extra couple of quid on my kids.So  said if you're going to be like that be like that.So she said don't you fucking worry I am.
*BET:	Yeah.
*BET:	She said bollocks on you lot for Christmas.I ain't buying nothing.Oh she said oh you spent money on the shirts for the kids.
*EDN:	That's it you can't   (        ) these days 
*JUL:	The kids come first isn't it ?
*BET:	Well they were going with their   (        ) at the beginning of the year up for register and they're catching up on it now.
*EDN:	Oh.That's it.I mean we've got kids and the kids got to come first and the adults come second 
*BET:	like Ann said .It's all right for them because their kids can go on holiday with them so they've got no problems.But because their kids can't go abroad   (        ) then they get a letter through to say like you know they are going on camp would they be interested.Of course Ann sends off and says yeah.But that's three hundred pounds for them to fit the bill.
*BET:	Oh yeah!
*BET:	Hundred and fifty pound each.That's a fortnight mind.
*BET:	Yeah.
*BET:	And that's everything.That's all their spending money involved and their day trips off the lot.She's got no worries. (.) Her and her old man stays at home and has a fortnight together.Then they go at camping school or whatever wherever the school's going.The kids do that.And then they go on holiday with Ann and the old man.And when they go on holiday with Ann and the old man they used to get through a hundred pounds a day and they go for a week.That's seven hundred pounds like sometimes more.But she said I don't mind because I would like to take my boat but I can't.When we went abroad I know we've spent three or four grand when we're over there with the holiday as well like you know.She said so it's got to be done really she said and I feel so sorry for them she says because even when they get older they still won't be able to go abroad.
*BET:	Yeah.
*EDN:	Well I mean I don't see why they 
*BET:	And they've had so many operations 
*EDN:	I can't see why they can't go on a camping holiday in France.I mean they can go on the ferry.Take the car out there.They've got their own car.
*BET:	Yeah but they go to  somewhere bloody they go to the same place every year and they have a real good time.And she says might just as well be with the kids like so.She ain't really worried.She says the only trouble is when they get older
*JUL:	I mean I am   (.) I mean I'm quite surprised that your floor.Whatever floor that Ann's been on hasn't done something like put some money in so that they can take em somewhere else something like over in France or something like that.
*BET:	She wouldn't accept it .
*BET:	She's not that type is she ?
*BET:	She'd say don't be silly  (        ) . ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Simple isn't she?
*BET:	 (        )  ((laugh)) and they don't want nothing for their kids.
*BET:	She puts them first don't she?
*BET:	Oh yeah.Whatever they want they gets.
*BET:	 (        ) my darling please?
*UNK:	She bought them a telly.
*JUL:	I reckon they should have next year a long weekend 
*UNK:	Purple   (        ) 
*BET:	All that money in your pocket haven't you?Let's have a look .
*DAV:	There covers 
*JUL:	Even if they all go in bed and breakfast and take them two kids to Euro Disney.
*UNK:	She erm   (        ) little T V each.It was T V between them.So many hours and so many nights and  (        ) .But I would have bought them one each.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BET:	But they're only having one big present each this year.And that's it.
*BET:	That's it.Yeah .
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*JUL:	Yeah I know.I'd go mad.
*BET:	She said that fucking last year I said.
*BET:	What's the girl  (        ) ?
*BET:	No.Boy thirteen and a girl eleven.
*BET:	Oh.
*BET:	Or twelve that's either two years or a year between them.And don't fight.
*BET:	No?Of course boy and a girl don't  (        ) 
*BET:	They only argue.They don't fight they only argue but they can't fight cause of their ears.And I think the boy suffers from asthma as well.
*JUL:	Well there you are.It's different with a boy and a girl cos
*DAV:	You got your washing out mind you.
*BET:	Because when
*DAV:	You been out there?
*BET:	Her boy went out on this work experience thing for his school like.He must be older than thirteen.He must be fourteen .
*BET:	He must be fourteen hmm .
*BET:	Yeah.
*BET:	Anyway they paid him I told you didn't I?They paid him and the reason they ain't going to have nobody back there any more back to this firm cos   (        ) safety rules.And erm she was saying that when he was there a bloke come round start giving them a little verbal.She'd never had nothing in his ears to protect his ears.So he's shouting it the boy like.And of course the old man was there and he come over and grabbed the bloke by the throat and he said don't you ever shout at my son like that again.Course he was frightened to death weren't he  (        ) .And he said well he should know better than to   (        ) blah blah blah
*BET:	Hmm
*BET:	He said my son's fucking deaf you idiot.Well well that is why he don't need to put anything in his ears.Because he can't hear nothing stupid.Well he's still have to put it in his ears.You're going to put your fucking eyes out.
*BET:	Hmm.I bet he got all upset.
*BET:	Well everybody knew when they're up. (        ) daft anyway and nine times out of ten you've got to look at him and speak to him and that because he can't understand and er bloke gave him the verbal.He was nearly crying wasn't he.
*BET:	Ah!
*BET:	We didn't know what to say.
*BET:	It's got to be tumble dried.
*BET:	He didn't know he had to give him a little verbal back.
*JUL:	It's already   (        ) 
*BET:	What about the football?
*DAV:	 (        ) my white shirt?
*BET:	You picked Liverpool?
*BET:	Yeah.Put it on then.
*JUL:	Turn the tape off.
*BET:	And the day that he left. ((vacuum cleaner sound))
*BET:	Is it finished?
*JUL:	No it's not finished.It's just that you're going to get that on.
