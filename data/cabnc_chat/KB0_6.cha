@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 028902)
*GET:	Knowing Martin   (.) what   (.) John has just told me about him   (.) if I didn't know him I don't think it would me anything!  (.) Brief details like that are meaningless!  (.) I trust the Ministerial Committee   (.) to make decisions and bring recommendations.  (.) On the other hand, I would like to meet the candidates to see what they look like.  (.) But that doesn't apa  , but what they look like is not going to affect whether I   (.) support the Ministerial Committee or not. 
*UNK:	What actual details do we give to you? 
*GET:	Despite what David said, that   
*NOE:	 Yeah. 
*GET:	rather hurt!  (.) Putting it in therefore, we did read the description. 
*NOE:	Yes, oh oh. 
*GET:	Actually, I think David is right.  (.) I  , it didn't come over, but for me when we interviewed Martin is one of most refreshing interviews   (.) I've had the pleasure of taking part in!  (.) He's a man of   (.) rare    (  )  (.) who was so privileged to go to Cambridge   (.) and to be interviewed.  (.) And came back having learnt a new  verse   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*GET:	which was probably written about twenty or thirty years ago   (.) but recognised that his own congregations   (.) would be very suspicious of them! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	And it delights from this   (.) thank you John.  (.) Okay   (.) number two would you please affirm the call of Ian     (.) for   (  ) in the psychiatric unit. (.)  (  )  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*GET:	No.  (.) Would you of  (  ) . 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	 (  ) our counselling  (  ) . 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	I've been involved in interview  with  (  ) . 
*NOE:	 Don't you  like my  (  ) ? 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	Right.  (.) Yes, he's about   (.) five foot eleven! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	 (  )  (.) erm   (.) he is a member of Vanroch Caerphilly   (.) at URC   (.) and has done   (.) I think   (  ) he is currently at    (  )  (.) and erm   (.) have felt a gentle call emerging over the last   (.) few years   (.) and erm   (.) all started in Cambridge, that's about it, that's all I can say. 
*NOE:	Oxford. 
*GET:	Oxford, sorry!  (.) Had too much  (  ) .  (.) All in favour of er Ian's   (.) call being   (.) affirmed please.  (.) Thank you.  (.) And thirdly, we ask you to affirm the call of Peter     (.) for praying for   (  ) in the ministry.  (.) Peter is a member of   (.) right, he's actually a member of Clygarthy URC but he works   (.) and has erm   (.) as a   (.) form of day pastor   (.) and  (  ) .  (.) Member of Clan othel URC and has worked and   (.) served as a form of day pastor at Clygarthy URC   (.) and he   (.) has come from the Anglican tradition   (.) Church of England   (.) and he has erm   (.) over the years towards the reform tradition.  (.) He   (.) seeks to work as a    (.)  (  ) ministry within the Vale   (.) and brings tremendous   (  ) in   (.) erm to the ministry which he   (.) he will hopefully let the side   (.)  (  ) .  (.) He is also a self-employed   (.)  (  ) . 
*NOE:	I thought he'd be touting for business! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	We are not at the time of business, we are here to affirm the call!  (.) All in favour please show.  (.) Thank you.  (.) As we come to end of   (.) of that part   (.) we have erm   (.) Burmingford Hall of Ministry two, three people   (.) and we have also   (.) as part of the report recognised the timing of Roy  , where's Roy?  (.) Roy, who is sitting over there.  (.) Lastly, (  ) recognise this man is Bob, who's sitting over there.  (.) Erm   (.) those two people, along with Bryn     (.) erm   (.) were also in, in college together.  (.) So they started their ministry off together, and I think it's   (.) something quite special to me   (.) and to recognise that we   (.) have sent three people off on a journey   (.) and three people, two here, have come to the end of a journey and   (  ) just part of the journey   (.) and are beginning to discover that   (  ) will be   (  ) discovered in the life   (.) of the three human beings, human beings 
*UNK:	  ((laugh))  
*GET:	  (  )  at the time.  (.) Shall we remember   (.) and these three friends in life.  (.)  ((praying)) Lord we thank you for the ways in which you challenge and call people   (.) to all forms of ministry within the light of your church.  (.) And especially we thank you today for the call of Martin   and Ian   and Richard   to the Ministry of Word and Sacrament within the light of your church.  (.) We pray for them and their families.  (.) We pray for them in their studies.  (.) In their pilgrimage to   (.) discover more of your presence in their lives.  (.) As they begin a particular stage of the ministry   (.) we also pray for those who are coming towards the end of that particular stage of the ministry.  (.) Remember especially Bob and Roy   (.) and we pray that you will enable them to find fulfilment and enjoyment, and enrichment   (.) in their lives as they   (.) step forward   (.) in faith and confidence in   (.) Lord in your mercy  
*UNK:	Amen. 
*GET:	Amen.  (8.0) Reports are not always about revolutions   (.) and that's important! And you will see that we now have   (.) a good   (.) erm   (.)  (  ) .  (.) Well, over to Noel   (.) to relax with each other thoughts, questions, comments about the life of the ministry of the church.  (.) And   (  ) happens   (.) some people have prepared particular presentations, you will see after one is on  (  ) , and one of political insubordination, one on the process of learning together.  (.) Five   (  ) districts have erm   (.) prepared some of vision   (.) in order to   (.) share that vision or that example of what is happening in the districts, relating to the ministry   (.) erm   (.) with the    (  )  (.) and those who have come to us as well.  (.) And   (.) one church has prepared a   (.) little presentation or   (.) mind-stretching, heart-stretching thought of church and community.  (.) So we're, we're here now to relax.  (.) To talk about the Ministry of Office.  (.) I think, in starting this off, I would like to   (.) encourage as many people to take place in conversation, if possible.  (.) And I will include in that   (.) those who are   (.) younger than most of us here.  (.) Er, to talk about what   (.) you think about the ministry   (.) of the church as well.  (.) We're talking about this   (.) partly because of the document passed in the ministry in which, everybody has avidly read   (.) and erm   (.) has been   (  ) talked about after the seventeenth   (.) er, in York   (.) in July.  (.) But I think the more important reason for talking about   (.) the Ministry of the New Church, or the Ministry of the Church   (.) is because of the   (.) erm   (.) developing needs and the   (.) developing thoughts and ideas which are actually   (  ) additions   (.) which are the, the crucial area   (.) where ministry takes place.  (.) First of all, I think it would be useful if we were clear   (.) that with the new  (  ) , ministry was a waste!  (.) Too often, we are limited in thinking of ministry as those who   (.) either do or do not work where   (  ) are thought of.  (.) And, we might call those Ministers, if you like, with a big M.  (.) Erm   (.) but we'll be talking about the Ministry of the Church.  (.) We're actually talking about, I mean, if you remember this  (  ) , we're talking about   (.) the absinity   (.) of the body of Christ.  (.) That is the Ministry of the Church.  (.) But each one that's here   (.) however old or however young   (.) are a part   (.) an active part   (.) an essential part   (.) a crucial part   (.) of the Ministry of the Body of Christ.  (.) We are these.  (.) And how we relate   (.) within the church   (.) and how we relate outside the church   (.) although, in essence, there is nothing outside the church   (.) there is nothing that that position  (  ) .  (.) Okay?  (.) As you look into your shaving mirror in the morning, you shall say, hello Minister, how are you?  (.) Or as you look into your drawer in the morning, to find out what you need   (.) to put into your hand bag in the day, you say hello Minister, how are you?  (.) Okay?  (.) That's  (  ) .  (.) We're also talking in terms of a ministry   (.) which   (.) what you expect   (.) is very often what you get   (.) you're trained to be somebody  (  ) , okay?.  (.) And one of the things that these trainings help you    (  )  (.) is that if you expect something of a child   (.) then you're much more likely to get it!  (.) That way it's positive.  (.) If you expect that child is going to   (.) do a fantastic job   (.) on that painting   (.) then that encouragement and confidence is coming across.  (.) It also works negatively!  (.) If you don't expect much from little Tommy   (.) then, little Tommy is less and less likely to give you anything much!  (.) So we're talking about ministry. We're talking about something which is bound by our expectations.  (.) We need to be aware of our expectations   (.) because our expectations can be   (.) limiting   (.) and can be stretching and   (.) inspiring.  (.) We also are exercising the Ministry of the Church   (.) within a context.  (.) We've learnt something about the church and  (  ) .  (.) One of the contexts in which we are exercising ministry is that we have   (.) for the last fifty years   (.) well I haven't personally!  (.) But for the last fifty years or so   (.) for most of us   (.) the experience of the church   (.) has been declined   (.) and   (.) closer   (.) and   (.) reducing number of people with dog collars.  (.) Okay? There have been negative interference.  (.) We need to be aware   (.) of how those can actually triple the numbers.  (.) We need to be aware of how   (.) we are   (.) subconsciously   (.) taught.  (.) A Geographer   (.) knows that   (.) and   (.) the whole environment importance.  (.) A Geographer also knows that in order to   (.) use maps   (.) you need to know   (.) where you are.  (.) You can't get anywhere without knowing where we are.  (.) Half of our exercise in listening to each other is to know where we are.  (.) In order that we can begin to recognise   (.) the movements and the visions and the views   (.) of where we can be.  (6.0) Knowing where we are in terms of the way in which we are tricked into having   (.) bad  (  ) .  (.) Knowing where we are in the way in which we are tricked   (.) into believing that erm   (.) our churches now are weaker than when they were founded   (.) and   (.) probably most of you, many of you have heard my children's prayer. (.)   (  )   
*UNK:	  ((cough))  
*GET:	the children are the difference between churches now and churches in the past.  (.) Especially at church anniversaries.  (.)  (  ) . (.) And nine times out of ten when I ask the congregation   (.) whether your church is bigger now than it was when it was founded   (.) nine times out of ten the congregation say, it is smaller now than when it was founded.  (.) And nine point nine times out of ten they are wrong!  (.) We've got a wrong   (.) false   (.) image of the  (  ) .  (.) And that is harmful!  (.) And it's parallel.  (.) Those visions come from within ourselves.  (.) Come from the way in which we don't necessarily take on board what we are learning.  (.) They come also from   (.) orgasmic enters or whatever   (.) such programmes there are go around these days, (  ) ! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	Carole, you tell the people sitting next to you what orgasmic is. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	What did he say? 
*UNK:	 ((laughing)) I don't know ! 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Is it Derek Nimmo? 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	In the nineteen fifties. 
*UNK:	I never 
*GET:	Erm 
*UNK:	I never watched it, in fact. 
*GET:	There's also the whole of notion of what we are saying by our ministry together.  (.) Okay?  (.) What we are, what we  are saying by our buildings. 
*UNK:	  (  )  sort of ended in a little    (  )   
*GET:	  (  )   (.) What we are saying by our notice boards.  (.) Many of which are still in action.  (.) What we are saying by our commitment or our attitude. What we are saying by   (.) the way in which we share what we are saying by our commitment to justice   (.) and peace.  (.) All of these are involved   (.) and a part of our ministry.  (.) And, that again, might be me   (.) but many of you when you've heard me say it in a service   (.) I've ended up   (.) with my asking at the end of a sermon   (.) asking the congregation to smile.  (.) Now, you know that's   (.) how many of you I, have I done that to? 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	Well that, that may be a reflection on me, okay?  (.) But   (.) what are we saying by our expressions   (.) both within worship and outside?  (.) And of course, our discussion of ministry i.e. the activity of the people of God   (.) is not just a domestic thing about the URC. I mean, we   (.) we get bound up with   (.) with all sorts of domestic things, and will, I expect, later today. But it's also   (.) erm   (.) about discovering the completeness of the ministry of the people of God   (.) as we enter through the various commitments that we have   (.) to our sister churches   (.) in Wales and in Britain   (.) and in the world, whether it's routine or a particular relationship of members or   (.) All that's part of the context   (.) of the ways in which we're talking about   (.) and sharing with each other with God.  (.) Please smile? 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*GET:	There is a list here   (.) three major's presentations on   (  ) communion   (.) on political insubordination   (.) and on the pilgrimage of learning together.  (.) I think what we'll do is hear each of those three presentations   (.) and then I will allow a time for comment, especially discussion   (.) after each   (.) I will limit that   (.) to make sure we get time for all   (.) so that's   (.) that's the way we're going to do it. 
*UNK:	Thank you. 
*GET:	But first of all   (.) in terms of a precedency attitude   (.) I hope I'm looking in the right place? Nannette   erm   (.) is going to   (.) lead us in our   (.)  (  ) .  (.) Nannette would you like everybody where you are and who you are? 
*PHI:	Nannette   (  ) the Minister of the United Reform Church in Merthyr   (.) also sharing the ministry with the Presbyterian Church of Wales in Merthyr and Merthyr Vale.  (.) Thank you John for that introduction. I remember John coming to Merthyr and asking the young people to find, see if there was anybody who was over a hundred in the congregation! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	And the dazzling thing was that quite a few made a beeline for   (.) a lady who co  , could at least give   (.) thirty years! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	I thought   (  ) haven't noticed from where I'm standing! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	In preparing ours for today   (.) and   (.) the whole question of thinking of being, main precedency of communion rests in our understanding erm, of ordination, which I know   (.) later we   (.) we will have time to discuss.  (.) But, may I ask yo  , of you a question   (.) not for answers but will   (.) erm   (.) perhaps come later in the debate   (.) and that is what does the   (.) service of Holy Communion mean   (.) to you?  (.) Our answers   (.) will get crushed.  (.) But one thing that I would share with you   (.) and it's this, is that   (.) whenever the   (.) friends of Jesus eat and drink together   (.) they remember him   (.) his sacrificial love for them   (.) and the wonderful gift of freedom that he has made possible.  (.) I'll say at the outset, that Holy Communion is not something that we play about with.  (.) Our communion service is part of the rich tradition which has been passed down to us   (.) from Jesus Christ.  (.) But having sa  said that   (.) I have to share with you the   (.) a key element er, in the life of the church has been the ordained Ministry of Word and Sacrament   (.) and pastoral care. And there is no intention to dispense with this kind of service. But concern is expressed   (.) in the number of jobs that the perfect minister is expected to do. I stand here, I am not a perfect minister because I am over forty   (.) I've got   (.) children that are not too awkward but   (.) erm, could be awkward   (.) and, I haven't a spouse   (.) ah   (.) and ah   (.) I stand here saying that I'm not good at everything   (.) I'm good with young people, I'm not o  only good with old people   (.) I try to do my best. We know the picture of a perfect minister   (.) but   (.) we   (.) there is a challenge   (.) to relief ministers   (.) to do the work that they are called to do.  (.) This will lead to   (.) a long deba   (.) debate.  (.) But, it is   (.) it seems from this report that   (.) is in front of us   (.) that it is now appropriate for the URC   (.) to take a new step with regard to the local ministry of elders. Already this morning the question has been asked about providing elders.  (.) And it is that   (.) each local church, of whatever sign   (.) should be invited to nominate from amongst their elder division   (.) those elders who district council   (.) might consider and recognise as dividing elders   (.) for a stated period of years   (.) with authority to do  , provide them all services of worship and meetings of that local church, as the need arises.  (.) And this has been suggested, the same thing, the understanding that we have now of special authorization   (.) which obviously doesn't work.  (.) The reasons for looking at this change and, I quote the reports   (.) the   (.) the ways the district council interpret the existing clause   (.) about provi  , (  ) precedency   (.) is the district council   (.) ah, interpret in very different ways.  (.) A second thing is that   (.) a co  , is it right that a company of people   (.) should be deprived of a sacrament   (.) because an ordained minister is not available?  (.) Remembering the words of Jesus, that where two or three are gathered together.  (.) The third thing that the re  , the report says is that there is no magical element about sacraments.  (.) But   (.) sacrament has everything to do with the grace of God   (.) and the faith of the church.  (.) And this proposal is seen, lastly, as developing   (.) local leadership.  (.) The proposal is that presiding elders   (.) and whether proposal is the right word, but the suggestion that presiding elders   (.) be   (.) appointed following our conviction   (.) that every local church   (.) should have regular sacramental worship   (.) with presiding   (.) with people   (.) presiding   (.) being allowed.  (.) Can I close by saying that every time Christians share the Lord's supper   (.) they are publicly declaring their needs to be fed with the living bread and wine.  (.) What does the holy   (.) communion, what the Lord's supper   (.) mean   (.) to you? 
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*GET:	 (  )  (.) and   (.) our visitors from other churches are also welcome to join in   (.) in any discussion or comments.  (8.0) And any more, for those who feel like it, there's provision for 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*GET:	Sorry? 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*GET:	Anyone who's visiting from other churches.  (.) And   (.) we lack provisions   (.) that allows for a presidency in the absence   (.) of a minister   (.) is a good one as long as it is monitored closely by   (.) district council.  (.) And   (.) be that there no magical   (.) erm    (.)  (  ) like you, which I agree there is a mystical.  (.) Like it isn't    (  )  (.) you know that   (.) the Eucharist, er the the   (.) the communion is very central to our worship   (.) and   (.) having had ten years working at the Navy   (.) that was an eye opener   (.) and deepening of my own spiritual awareness   (.) in the, as in the sanctity that I got, the sacrament   (.) and how other churches see it   (.) and er   (.) helped to create a very    (.)  (  ) affirm, at the very centre of my own   (.) if you like, pilgrimage.  (.) What had abhorred me in the past   (.) and sometimes, er, perhaps arrive and been to the church and say, oh by the way it's communion!  (.) And   (.) have that sprung on me   (.) I I I, I I feel terrible because   (.) the communion service i  is, is something I have to prepare for   (.) in myself   (.) and obviously shape the whole se  se  service around it.  (.) And I think we need to heighten, sharpen our awareness of   (.) erm   (.) what I understand by communion   (.) and er   (.) er, also to er, to remember that the   (.) injunction of Paul as he was   (.) you know that I have   (.) received of the Lord at which I deliver unto you. Those words of execution as we continue to read them.  (.) There's a severe warning against those   (.) who can't do it in a spirit of   (.) of of,lardiness and, and not discerning   (.) to the body and and, and the will of Christ. Perhaps that needs to be reminded about them.  (.) But they sho  er er er, it's good to have   (  ) and sharing it   (.) but I   (.) but I, but I, I personally feel as long as it's   (.) well monitored within the   (.) within the district council   (.) in the event of a minister not being able to be there   (.) then   (.) er a reco  , er som  , a recognised person to   (.)  (  ) . (.)  (  )  
*UNK:	Right   (.) when we 
*GET:	Who, who are you? 
*UNK:	Oh   (.) you ask difficult questions, that's all you can get! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	No giants in Ardmore Vale!  (.) No giants   ((laugh)) in Ardmore Vale  
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	You'd make   (  ) do that! 
*PHI:	See   (.) Is it me? (  )  
*GET:	  (  )  
*UNK:	  ((laugh))  
*UNK:	 (  ) . 
*PHI:	Ah? 
*UNK:	I've forgotten what I was gonna say! 
*PHI:	Yep. 
*UNK:	Erm   (.) oh yes   (.) my next question was   (.) er, what is holy communion?  (.) I'd like to re-phrase the question   (.) what is holy   (.) in   (.) communion? 
*UNK:	Okay   (.) well I mean 
*UNK:	 (  ) do we say, what is holy in communion we then recognise that it's not   (.) what   (.) but who   (.) who is holy   (.) in communion   (.) okay?  (.) The holy, as in communion to me is a who   (.) not a what!  (.) Okay?  (.) And I think that debate   (.) er between the, the   (  ) tradition and, and the   (.) the    (  )  (.) and and er, Roman Catholic traditions, you know i   (.) er, this business of elevating the host and and   (  ) substantiation    (  )  (.) so the elements themselves that, that it become holy   (.) alright? And then it's a kind of a what, you know? It's the body of a what, and the blood as a what! 
*UNK:	Have you read  (  ) ? 
*UNK:	But that's not it! And that's not what Paul meant   (.) when he said   (  ) the body of a what!  (.) He meant   (  ) who?  (.) That is holy.  (.) And who is holy?  (.) Jesus Christ. Alright? You wanted it, and that's it! When two or three are doubted   (.) they're wrong!  (.) So, what's the who? That's the holy to me. And the other who of holy   (.) is the Saint.  (.) I'm making this point because I think that we can get really   (  ) to verify    (  )   
*UNK:	 You're always going  on about 
*UNK:	You know   (.) this whole of idea of things and ritual being the holy   (.) and that things in the ritual there   (.) yes, there are sacred symbols   (.) and they need to be handled in that, that, that sense of sacredness, but the   (.) that which makes them sacred   (.) is the person, our Lord   (.) and us   (.) in communion with him and with each other and it seems to me that wherever that happens there is sacrament.  (.) Wherever that happens there is   (.) holy communion.  (.) Even if the elements aren't even present.  (.) Okay?  (.) But I think I think those elements are important otherwise Jesus wouldn't have made a point of it! 
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*ENA:	David      (  )  (.)  (  )  (.) East Wales.  (.) Can I clarify please what exactly we are talking about here?  (.) Because the do   (.) document, Patterns of Ministry   (.) does not   (.) talk about lay presidency!  (.) It talks about the presidency of ordained people!  (.) Elders   (.) who are ordained!  (.) Now, I rather wish it was talking about   (.) lay presidency   (.) and I would go along with Nannette   (.) on the question of a lay person   (.) presiding in communion. Ecumenical dynamite, I know!  (.) But I think we need to be clear   (.) whether we are talking   (.) about ordained or lay people   (.) and further on in the discussion whether we can indeed justify that division. 
*UNK:	How can try   (  ) and allow an elder    (.)  (  ) as an ordained minister of the free people  (  ) .  (.) Can I say that need holy communion as a group thing   (.) in a way of our communion   (.) and   (.) as a church we are going to be Roman Catholic.  (.) It is the community   (.) as a   (.) an affirmation of the community   (.) and to say that we need to have an outsider in to do that   (.) because there is not an ordained minister there   (.) to me, is a little like the situation in some Anglican Parishes where there's a woman   (.) sitting
