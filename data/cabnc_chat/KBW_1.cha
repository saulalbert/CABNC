*TIM:	No.
*DOR:	No we'll all get wet if you do.Cos we're not, we don't want a bath. (.) 
*TIM:	Why  (        ) .
*DOR:	Why what?
*TIM:	Why do you need to wash the  (        ) ?
*DOR:	Cos they're   (.) cos they're messy.Look you can see it's all brown.Ugh. (.) If we just wipe round the outside of the tank though, I think that will help. (.) Cos it's gone all funny inside, can you see? (.) 
*TIM:	Yeah.
*DOR:	Whoops. (.) Ugh look at that.
*CHR:	Ugh. (.) 
*DOR:	I think it's the kind of food we're using cos it's different food from the   (.) food that we had at the beginning.It didn't seem to get as bad as this at the beginning.
*CHR:	Why didn't it seem to get as bad as this?
*DOR:	I don't know.It just did n't. (.) 
*CHR:	Is it because mummy
*DOR:	Pardon?
*CHR:	Is it because we've given them a different   (.) have we already used a pot up?

*TIM:	Mummy.
*DOR:	Hello.
*CHR:	Where's the little pot mummy?
*DOR:	What's your problem? (.) You alright?
*TIM:	I wanted to put water in there.
*DOR:	You want to put water in?Well we'll just give them one more swish.
*TIM:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Little pot mum.
*DOR:	What little pot?The fish food you mean? (.) Well the thing was, because we bought a box and the box   (.) was a bit flimsy, I thought we would put the new fish food into the old pot, you see.So the old pot has still got some in   (.) but it's really the new food.Do you see? (.) 
*CHR:	Why didn't you keep it in the box?
*DOR:	There's still some food in there as well. (.) Right, okay.If you want to put your jug of water in now, this is your moment.Do you want to get a jug   (.) full.Do you want to get some from the tap?
*CHR:	Why?
*DOR:	You can if you want to. (.) Because it'll probably need more than what's in the bucket anyway.Tim, do you want to carry this?
*TIM:	What?
*DOR:	Do you want to carry this?
*TIM:	What?
*DOR:	This tank.
*TIM:	Want to   (        )

*TIM:	No.
*CHR:	Right do it like this. (.) 
*DOR:	Oops.
*CHR:	Tim's made a hole.
*DOR:	I think you're doing it a bit roughly Tim.Can you do it more gently so the stones don't move. (.) 
*CHR:	Don't just pour it in one place.You're making another hole.
*DOR:	Put, tip it on to the bridge and then you won't make a hole cos the bridge will be in the way. (.) Oop!What a dilly. ((laugh))  (.) Ah no.If you're gonna do it like that we're gonna have to stop you from doing it. (.) Come on.
*TIM:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	Mind the fish. (.) Poor things. (.) That's better Tim.Oh no!Disaster.Move the video quick. (.) Make sure it's dried.
*CHR:	It is dried.

*DOR:	As long as you didn't hurt him.There you go mister fish you can go for a swim now.Now look we've got a fish in there and a fish in there Tim so we must be careful now because otherwise we're gonna hurt them.
*CHR:	No there's only one in there.
*DOR:	I think I'd better fish that one out do you?
*CHR:	Yeah. (.) There's already one in there Tim now.
*DOR:	Yeah.So when you pour the water don't go tipping it 
*CHR:	There's already one in there.
*DOR:	on top of him cos he'll get a shock.Let's have this weed out.
*CHR:	 (        ) one in there already.
*TIM:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	You gonna help the weed? (.) Whoops.Alright.
*TIM:	I can't take all of it.
*DOR:	Woo er   (.) alright wait a minute now cos mummy's gonna fish this fish out.
*TIM:	Er Mum, how do you think I caught it?
*DOR:	Oh look at all the bits in there.I don't know how you caught it love.It was rather clever really.
*TIM:	Yeah because when you catch
*DOR:	You've just got to be careful because 
*TIM:	fish then 
*DOR:	if you're not careful you'll hurt them you see because if you   (.) touch their tails or their fins or something.There we are.Right now when you're tipping it in now I should use a cup now Christopher cos the jug will be too much water for them. (.) Alright?Now just gently now.
*TIM:	I I  (        ) 
*DOR:	Well watch where you're pouring Tim.Not on top of the fish please. (.) 
*CHR:	 (        ) use that but it's got dirty now.I'm gonna use that bit. (        ) . I'm gonna pour it over there.
*DOR:	Go on then.
*CHR:	But that isn't in the way of the bridge.Oh Tim.
*DOR:	Whoops. (.) Oh look, next door's got a new car.Unless it's a visitor.What do you think?Got a white one look. (.) 
*CHR:	Will that be enough water yet?
*DOR:	Er   (.) bit more I think. (.) Gently does it.That was a good one Tim, well done. (.) 
*TIM:	Oh no. (.) 
*DOR:	See if you can tip it without the bits going in then.Whoop   (.) whoop.
*TIM:	I did.
*DOR:	What?
*TIM:	I did put a bit in.
*DOR:	Oh well.Never mind.It will come out next week. (.) 
*CHR:	What happens if you put a bit in mum? (.) The fish might think it's food?
*DOR:	Well er I think those bits that are in there are really just bits of weed.I don't think it's anything too awful.What's this thing? (.) Ooh. (.) That's a funny thing.
*TIM:	 (        )

*DOR:	We'll have a look at it later on.Oh very, very tuneful Tim.
*CHR:	Why do you have to have it   (.) Why do you have to have it?
*DOR:	Because   (.) there are some people that want to   (.) listen to what we say in our house, and what we say to each other.And then they can think about language and how people use language. (.) 
*TIM:	 ((playing instrument))That's a funny sound.
*CHR:	What about in France?Well if you can   (        ) in Fr
