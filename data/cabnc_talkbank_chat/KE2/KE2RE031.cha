*PS0W2:	and it 's right across the other side of Austria from us Where you went skiing is this side of Austria but Vienna is about two hundred and two hundred and fifty miles further on across Austria very close to erm Czechoslovakia and erm Yugoslavia Right so it is twelve hundred and fifty kilometres from London to Vienna can a Concorde do the trip in half an hour How far does it go in an hour .  329743_377653

*PS0W5:	Ha oh Terry .  432983_435783
*PS0W2:	Mhm .  435783_436083

*PS0W5:	Okay .  452033_452223
*PS0W2:	we 'll be able to manage it .  452333_453313
*PS0W5:	Yeah Okay It is a hundred miles from King 's lions .  454253_462003
*PS0W2:	King 's Lynn .  462363_463263
*PS0W5:	King 's Lynn where 's that .  463643_467683
*PS0W2:	Erm do you know where The Wash is No if you think of a map of England erm the south coast is there there 's Dover there 's the estuary for London London is here erm then it comes up like this the east coast of London the east coast of E England like that this is East called East Anglia here you 've got Norfolk and Norwich and then you 've got Ipswich here and then you 've got Suffolk there and Essex right Can you remember that bulge in the map of England Well that piece up there is called The Wash .  467683_518723
*PS0W5:	Oh .  520793_520823
*PS0W2:	and King 's Lynn is close to the wash King 's Lynn is in this area here .  521673_525133
*PS0W5:	Oh .  526023_526053
*PS0W2:	So from London to King 's Lynn is they say a hundred miles and I 'll take their word for it London to Ipswich in fact is seventy miles .  526473_535543
*PS0W5:	Oh .  536163_536213
*PS0W2:	But yeah that 's about a hundred miles you see that would be about right yeah .  537413_540393
*PS0W5:	Oh .  540743_540803
*PS0W2:	So that 's where it is North of London Up by The Wash Right it is a hundred miles from King 's Lynn to London the train takes two hours to do the journey the train does not go at a constant speed it speeds up sometimes and slows down at other times it also stops at stations on the way and on once of course as it as it 's stopping it 's going more and more slowly and as it 's er moving off again it starts slowly and starts to go quickly but because it takes two hours in all the train goes a hundred miles in two hours we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour It says if it was travelling at a constant speed of fifty miles an hour It does n't sometimes it goes more slowly sometimes it goes more quickly sometimes it stops but because it takes two hours to do the hundred miles we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour Its real speed changes during the journey sometimes it is more than fifty miles per hour sometimes less but in two hours it goes the same distance as it would if its speed was fifty miles per hour all the time .  540973_620523
*PS0W5:	Oh .  620713_620833
*PS0W2:	So we say its average speed is fifty miles per hour There used to be a train called the Cheltenham Flyer there it is it went from Cheltenham to London a hundred and twenty miles in two hours do you know where Cheltenham is .  621303_645923
*PS0W5:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	Well if there is the south coast along here and Devo C Cornwall is there and Devon is here and you get the w the Bristol Channel going up here and then you c the coast coming down here and there 's Wales is here right Bristol is there right And if you go up from Bristol on from here you go up the motorway to Bristol and then you go along the M four to London well north of Bristol up where the River Severn gets quite narrow and can be bridged is a city called Gloucester and Cheltenham is just inland from Gloucester .  648693_693173
*PS0W5:	Oh .  693743_693903
*PS0W2:	So Cheltenham is about there and it 's about a hundred and twenty miles from Cheltenham to London .  693903_700203
*PS0W5:	Mm .  700333_700643
*PS0W2:	Right .  701333_701443
*PS0W5:	Okay .  701513_701683
*PS0W2:	So there 's Cheltenham Right so it went from Cheltenham to London a hundred and twenty miles in two hours what was its average speed .  701683_715203
*PS0W5:	Mm .  731733_731873
*PS0W2:	Well if it if it average speed is a hundred and twenty miles in two hours how far in fact would it go in one hour .  731873_739713
*PS0W5:	Sixty .  740093_740263
*PS0W2:	So what was its average speed .  740263_741883
*PS0W5:	Sixty .  742473_742923
*PS0W2:	Sixty miles per hour .  742923_743733
*PS0W5:	Oh .  745793_745933
*PS0W2:	It was n't its actual speed there will be sometimes it will be going very slowly sometimes it will be going much more quickly but its average speed was sixty miles an hour because at sixty miles an hour it would cover a hundred and twenty miles which was the distance in two hours .  745933_762153
*PS0W5:	Oh .  763043_763483
*PS0W2:	Right .  763483_763633
*PS0W5:	This book is n't very big is it .  763633_765433
*PS0W2:	No none of them are really are they Well this one 's very small is n't it .  765613_769053

*PS0W2:	Well there might be time we 'll see how we get on Now it says B what did you do with th the numbers one hundred and fifty and three to get the answer .  807163_820433
*PS0W5:	Divided a hundred by three .  820893_822363
*PS0W2:	Right so you write that down you divided a hundred and fifty by three .  822363_829763
*PS0W5:	I wonder what my brother 's doing now .  831903_834883

*PS0W5:	Mm mm .  909843_910333
*PS0W2:	because it 's further east so the sun is further away from them because the sun rises in the east so it gets light earlier that 's why we put the clocks on when you go to Europe one hour .  911213_946563

*PS0W5:	What 's a hovercraft .  1894073_1898163
*PS0W2:	Well it 's a very specialized boat in a sense I mean it goes on the surface of the water and it literally goes on the surface of the water it 's a hovercraft is a sort of a it 's a vessel which has got a skirt all round it .  1898173_1914013
*PS0W5:	Is it a rubber one .  1914013_1915883
*PS0W2:	Yes heavy thick rubber skirt and that the engines do two things they they drive propellers in the air and they pump air from under the vessel onto the surface of the water and the skirt round the boat .  1915963_1946893
*PS0W5:	Keeps dry .  1946893_1947093
*PS0W2:	keeps a cushion of air under the vessel so that really it hovers on top of the water and the air propellers drive it like an aeroplane .  1947093_1958613
*PS0W5:	Oh .  1958613_1958763
*PS0W2:	but it skims across the surface of the water and it 's very quick it only takes half an hour to go from Ramsgate to Dover .  1959123_1969903
*PS0W5:	Mm .  1971203_1971343
*PS0W2:	Right er from Swanage to Ventnor is thirty two miles so how long would a motor boat take .  1971343_1976413
*PS0W5:	Eight hours .  1976693_1977223
*PS0W2:	Eight hours right .  1977223_1981693
*PS0W5:	Colin 's dad 's got a boat .  1981693_1983443
*PS0W2:	Has he And how long would it take to go round the Isle of Wight which is sixty miles round the Isle of Wight .  1984373_1998393
*PS0W5:	Er erm fifteen .  1998813_1999983
*PS0W2:	Fifteen hours right Right D two how long does it take to go from Ventnor to Swanage in a launch with a speed of eight miles per hour .  1999983_2021863
*PS0W5:	Oh Ventnor where 's Ventnor Ah twenty two miles four .  2022583_2031913
*PS0W2:	Right .  2034113_2034293
*PS0W5:	four hours .  2035033_2036513
*PS0W2:	Right now you get the answer to D two by dividing the distance by the speed .  2037413_2046043
*PS0W5:	Mm .  2046043_2046483
*PS0W2:	thirty two 's the distance divided by the speed which is eight thirty two divided by eight is four this is the rule for working out a journey time distance in miles divided by speed in miles per hour gives you the time in hours Right You need a calculator .  2046493_2072303
*PS0W5:	I need a calculator Ooh .  2072303_2074883
*PS0W2:	How many hours does it take to go seven hundred and five miles at forty seven miles per hour .  2074883_2085093
*PS0W5:	Fifteen hours .  2086933_2088873
*PS0W2:	Right .  2088913_2089013
*PS0W5:	This is fun I like talking into This diagram shows the reach or an airline distances are in kilometres the figures for them are only rough one a jet flies from Beirut .  2089013_2113823
*PS0W2:	Beirut to .  2114133_2114743
*PS0W5:	to Bombay at four thousand kilometres Its speed is about eight hundred kilometres per hour .  2115283_2121763
*PS0W2:	Eight hundred and .  2121763_2123733
*PS0W5:	fifty .  2125123_2125503
*PS0W2:	fifty .  2125503_2125563
*PS0W5:	kilometres per hour to work out the time it takes we do four thousand divided by three er eight hundred and fifty The answer on the calculator is four point seven O five double eight two three hours but we do not need that as that .  2125563_2140423
*PS0W2:	To be as exact as that .  2140423_2141703
*PS0W5:	because the distance is .  2141703_2142793
*PS0W2:	because the d not exactly four thousand miles and the speed is not exactly eight hundred and fifty kilometres per hour .  2142793_2149403
*PS0W5:	The nearest whole number of hours is good enough The nearest whole number of hours Do you take it by that number .  2150053_2158203
*PS0W2:	The nearest whole number to four point seven the wh nearest whole number to four point seven nought five double eight two three is five because to the nearest whole number you look at that four it 's either gon na be four or five depending upon what that number is .  2158203_2176783
*PS0W5:	Mm .  2177592_2177603
*PS0W2:	is n't it If that 's five or more then you pu increase that by one and make it five So the journey time is about five hours So D four work out these journey times to the nearest hour Bombay to Perth at about eight hundred and fifty kilometres an hour .  2177603_2215863
*PS0W5:	Bombay to Perth eight .  2216733_2218993
*PS0W2:	Hours .  2219423_2219603

*PS0W5:	Geneva hundred and fifty One hour .  2257803_2267773
*PS0W2:	Right .  2270023_2270233
*PS0W5:	It only takes half an hour to go to Austria does n't it No it takes an hour .  2270233_2274373
*PS0W2:	No it takes an hour and a half .  2279563_2294983
*PS0W5:	Mm yeah It takes four hours to get to Lanzarote Six hours .  2301973_2306073
*PS0W2:	Good Right .  2306073_2306343
*PS0W5:	E .  2306343_2306783
*PS0W2:	Now this is quite important you 've got to think about this calculate as work in decimals But we usually think of time as hours and minutes and seconds too if we are being very exact This scale shows both minutes and decimals as an hour Thirty minutes half an hour nought point five .  2306943_2339533
*PS0W5:	Mm .  2341563_2341953
*PS0W2:	right Erm fifteen minutes nought point two five Forty five minutes three quarters of an hour nought point seven five and all the different calculations in between fifty minutes is about nought point that 's nought eight that 's nought nine so it 'd be nought point eight one two .  2342113_2369353
*PS0W5:	Four .  2369353_2369603
*PS0W2:	three is n't it Just over three .  2369612_2371683
*PS0W5:	Mm yeah .  2371963_2374493
*PS0W2:	Right So it says this scale shows both minutes and decimals and now use the scale to change these to minutes Now what 's point three of an hour in minutes .  2374493_2391483
*PS0W5:	Ten point .  2391963_2394583
*PS0W2:	No nought point three's there look .  2394583_2396343
*PS0W5:	Mm .  2397213_2397333
*PS0W2:	now you want to read off the top of the scale for minutes .  2397333_2400563
*PS0W5:	Fifteen minutes .  2400643_2401553
*PS0W2:	That 's ten minutes .  2401563_2402753

*PS0W5:	Mm .  2549243_2549383
*PS0W2:	we can find the train 's average speed like this change forty two minutes to a decimal of an hour what 's that .  2549383_2561923
*PS0W5:	Nought point seven .  2561923_2563863
*PS0W2:	Right From the scale above forty two minutes equals nought point seven hours .  2563863_2570693
*PS0W5:	Mm .  2570693_2570953
*PS0W2:	that means the journey time is two point seven hours two hours forty two minutes is two point seven hours .  2570953_2581783
*PS0W5:	Mm .  2581783_2581853
*PS0W2:	divide the distance by the time hundred and forty three divided by two point seven equals fifty two point nine round off to the nearest whole number that would be .  2581853_2595643
*PS0W5:	Fifty three .  2596323_2596583
*PS0W2:	So the average speed is about fifty three miles per hour .  2596583_2601823

*PS0W5:	Okay .  2694433_2694813
*PS0W2:	one point four five by one one eight equals now .  2694813_2701403
*PS0W5:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	that 's the wrong way you 've done it the wrong way have n't you .  2701403_2705953

*PS0W5:	Oh Oh It 's turned it the other way round .  2714773_2718143
*PS0W2:	It 's the reciprocal button .  2718143_2720303
*PS0W5:	Oh .  2720953_2721053
*PS0W2:	and a half one over two the reciprocal of a half if you turn it the other way round it 's two over one .  2721053_2729873
*PS0W5:	Yes .  2729873_2730043
