*HEL:	Brian? 
*SHE:	Yeah 
*HEL:	Dunno   (.) round here I think 
*SHE:	Does he?

*UNK:	 (  ) 
*SHE:	Oh I'm sure that not everybody's  (.)  
*HEL:	Well she comes out with such a load of claptrap, she don't know what she's talking about most of the time   (.) ah, are you and dad gonna buy a box each?  (.) Are you gonna buy a box and I'll get rid of the other two to Joanne and Emma? 
*SHE:	No I'll buy a box  (.)  
*HEL:	Cos I might be able to cart them off to Joanne and Emma to give them to their mum's on Mother's Day 
*SHE:	Mm, well you can buy me a box for Mother's Day, that's a good idea innit? 
*HEL:	We never buy you anything on Mother's Day, you get a card and be happy with it 
*SHE:	Er, well I've decided I want something this year 
*HEL:	Oh, I want two presents a year for birthday, christmas and children's day 
*SHE:	There isn't one 
*HEL:	I've just invented one 
*SHE:	Now, well you can't have one, you can't have a children's day cos you don't do anything 
*HEL:	Yes we do, we give you all the love and support you need. 
*SHE:	Ha. 
*HEL:	I was talking about you today in English 
*SHE:	Oh goodness 
*HEL:	Well they were talking about the eleven plus you see 
*SHE:	Oh 
*HEL:	and they said whose parents took it? So I went   ((laugh)) and he er, and she goes er, and did they both pass? She was expecting me to say yes, I goes no my mum failed 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	and er, and, yeah she said but your father liked it did he? And I goes no he hated it, he used to get detention every day for not wearing his cap    ((laugh))  (.) he hated it and he didn't do any work. Cos she was expecting me to trot out something like, yes both my parents went to grammar school like everybody else whose parents went, you know, they were all saying, yes my parents went to grammar school and they got these and these have got these qualifications and everything, I couldn't believe it though, there's a load of people in our class and like   (.) you know, all the parents are all these things and they're not exactly brilliant, the children 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	you know, like Olivia, er, both her parents are teachers and all this business 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	er, you know   (.)  she's not   
*SHE:	 they don't  have any time 
*HEL:	she's not much to shout about  ((laugh)) , you know, intelligence-wise  (.)  
*SHE:	Who was that with Miss  ? (  )  
*HEL:	mum had failed, but she said why? I goes well all the, all the questions were matters science and she weren't any good at that 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	Would, would, would erm, grandma and granddad let you go anyway? Would they of let you go if you'd passed? 
*SHE:	Oh yeah   (.) course they would of done 
*HEL:	Well some p  , parents didn't like it did they? Didn't want their children to go to it 
*SHE:	No, well it was a fixed system anyway 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	if you were well to do, you, you went   (.) I mean the   (.) the grammar schools, in the grammar school like your dad went to I mean it was, it was a really, you know it was a grammar school, it wasn't anything like it is now. 
*HEL:	Well, there was two grammar schools in Lincoln though weren't there? 
*SHE:	Well there was the City school and the  Lincoln school   
*HEL:	 The Lincoln school   
*SHE:	The Lincoln school was, is by the hospital 
*HEL:	weren't, weren't there a girls? 
*SHE:	There was the, the, the Chri  , Christ Hospital which was the girls high school 
*HEL:	Weren't there, weren't there another boys and girls one or whatever, or were there  just the boys   
*SHE:	 No there was just   
*HEL:	and the girls? 
*SHE:	no there was one girls school which was Christ Hospital 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	which was up Lindon Hill 
*HEL:	Mm 
*SHE:	and there was the City school which was on Monk's Road, and there was the Lincoln school which was on Brambury Road  which is   
*HEL:	 Where was   
*SHE:	now Christ Hospital 
*HEL:	Yeah, where was Christ Hospital then? 
*SHE:	Christ Hospital was on Lindon Hill  (.)  
*HEL:	Where? 
*SHE:	Christ Hospital was 
*HEL:	Where the old, where the college is now that art college? (.)  
*SHE:	Yeah, you know, half way up Lindon Hill there's three stone steps 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	and you went up there and there's them building sort of on the top  isn't there   
*HEL:	 Yeah   
*SHE:	that piece, and so you start go up this building across, and it's like it's, it's the school there 
*HEL:	Right 
*SHE:	and that's Christ Hospital, or was   
*HEL:	 Or was   
*SHE:	and that was the girls grammar school and then there was the City school where your dad went and there was the Lincoln school 
*HEL:	 Was that co-ed? 
*SHE:	 that come out  at Bram  , Brambury Road, what? 
*HEL:	Was it boys and girls? 
*SHE:	No, no, there was the girls school and there was the two boys school 
*HEL:	That's a bit unfair  (.)  
*SHE:	There wasn't another grammar, there wasn't another girls grammar school, oh what was Spring Hill?  (.) Oh great, I don't know, Spring Hill was something 
*HEL:	Girls? 
*SHE:	Yeah, it was a, yeah Spring Hill was a grammar school, it was a girls grammar school 
*HEL:	Oh  (.)  
*SHE:	Yeah because erm, poor thingy, the girl I went to school with she went on to Spring Hill when she was fifteen, see you could go on to grammar school when you were fifteen then as well as going at eleven 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	if you passed, if you failed the eleven plus and if you were clever enough, you could take an exam, like an entry exam to go, it's sort of if you improve from eleven to fifteen you could take an entry exam to go into grammar school then, so that you could take your G C E's  (.)  
*HEL:	Like erm, but, like Miss   says some of the stuff on it was so rubbish, I mean like, there was somebody she knew, who their son failed the eleven plus twice and now they've got their P H D 
*SHE:	Yeah, mm 
*HEL:	they failed, but they failed their eleven plus twice 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	but now they've got their P H D 
*SHE:	Mm, mm 
*HEL:	you know, it's so stupid innit? (.)  
*SHE:	It's too young an age which to, erm 
*HEL:	Assess  like that   
*SHE:	 judge  , judge people and, and, and, split them like that 
*HEL:	Mm 
*SHE:	Too young. 
*HEL:	I mean it might be alright for the more intelligent people or whatever, cos they get the best teachers then don't they? But I mean for the other people it's just, it's just rejection  innit, you're not good enough   
*SHE:	 Well I'm not stupid  , I mean I wasn't stu  , when I was at the junior schools in the country I wasn't stupid 
*HEL:	No 
*SHE:	but I went from there straight to there taking me eleven plus 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	I never had any practice at anything or, and I should imagine they did, I don't know, I don't know how  it worked   
*HEL:	 Yeah   
*SHE:	but I never had anything, I just went from one to the another, and I had to take it in the hall one day   (.) and I wasn't, I was never very good at maths anyway, not that kind of maths. 
*HEL:	Not algebra   (.) oh we had this, we 
*SHE:	I could never remember how to do them, I mean if somebody, if someone sat with me and explained it to me and then I, and then I could do it, I would do   
*HEL:	 Yeah   
*SHE:	it then for that lesson, but after that I couldn't remember  again how to do it   
*HEL:	 That's, that's just like me  that is, if I get into a rhythm and someone gives er, I can do it then, but if I just sit on a page, I think oh how do you do that? 
*SHE:	Mm, I can never remember the formulas, like your dad said formula for such and such a thing is so and so and that, but I could never remember them   (.) so I was no good then, because I couldn't remember it  (.)  
*HEL:	Mm, them nice 
*SHE:	and then there was St Joseph's which was private 
*HEL:	Mm   (.) mm there was only one in Redditch 
*SHE:	What grammar school? Where was that? 
*HEL:	Ulster grammar 
*SHE:	Where? 
*HEL:	 Ulster   
*SHE:	 Ulster  , Ulster 
*HEL:	Ulster 
*SHE:	no, that's in Ireland Ulster 
*HEL:	Ulster 
*SHE:	Ulster's in Ireland 
*HEL:	Ulster   ((laugh)) erm 
*SHE:	That's nowhere near Greenwich 
*HEL:	No, but it's where all the 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	went   (.) but you ain't good enough 
*SHE:	No, I'm afraid I'm er was a bit thick 
*HEL:	If you weren't, you went to Dudley High 
*SHE:	I was good at English   (.) history, sport 
*HEL:	You ought to try taking some of them, honestly they're so easy the exams are, like history, ah, talk about easy, spartan erm, you could G C S E, P E mum 
*SHE:	I don't think I could now   ((laugh)) I could of done then probably 
*HEL:	You remind me of bit, eh, you're like a bit what Joanne's like, except Joanne's better at maths but she's not very good at English, like when they were doing Animal Farm, I had to explain that it was a parody of the Russian revolution and everything and she just sat there with her mouth open. 
*SHE:	What did she go to see the other day that she reckon was a load of rubbish? 
*HEL:	Duke of   (.) Duke of thingy, it was er on at the Palace it was erm Duke of, there was an advert for it in the paper the other day 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	she didn't know it was an opera you see 
*SHE:	Oh it was an opera was it? 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	and I didn't like to say anything 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) What did she go from school? 
*HEL:	Yeah     (.)  ((laugh))  (.) oh  (.)  
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) I should imagine Joanne not 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	erm, but, you see, they would of been the most aggravating little gits there, because as soon as they found out, they all started messing about then, for three hours it was on, could you imagine sitting in there with them lot for three hours? 
*SHE:	What about the teachers?  (.) I would of chucked them out   (.) and Mrs   
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	yes, but mum, you're not a teacher at the Leeds High 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	If you were it probably be a bit different than it actually is   (.) dad said to me once that if he, that if he'd   (.) like been in charge of it we'd of gone to the Leeds and not St Augustine's 
*SHE:	Yeah he would of been   (.) cos he was, he was, he was on about that, erm the 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*SHE:	said to him about it when we first came and er, he said about when, when we were on about sending and I don't, they're going to a Catholic school and he says oh the Catholic schools around here aren't very good and the, the Leeds and that are the best 
*HEL:	Yeah well he's all in with that isn't he? 
*SHE:	What a load of rubbish 
*HEL:	He's, he's the flipping governor isn't he? He's one of the governors 
*SHE:	Where? 
*HEL:	Up there 
*SHE:	What at the Leeds, not at the Leeds he's at Dingleside 
*HEL:	Well he's at the Dingleside but he's involved with the P T A there 
*SHE:	Oh well 
*HEL:	and he's bound to bull up his own place isn't he? I mean no one 's gonna say oh yes my school's the best 
*SHE:	I don't think so, I don't, they're too, they're too big 
*HEL:	 What? 
*SHE:	 that's what  I don't like about it 
*HEL:	It's not, it's no bigger than our school 
*SHE:	Isn't it? 
*HEL:	No 
*SHE:	It's not got the same discipline  (.)  
*HEL:	It's about the sa  , well it's might, just a little bit bigger than our school, about another hundred or something, but that's, that's a drop in the ocean when you've got seven hundred there   (.) that's like one in each class or something you know, extra 
*SHE:	Still there's no discipline  (.)  
*HEL:	No discipline ah, no discipline 
*UNK:	 (  )  (.) 
*HEL:	and er, we were like, we was on about, you know like we were talking about the education system and everything in English and you know I told you they were on about people changing at eleven and everyone else in the class wanted the thirteen system except me, it's only cos what they're used to 
*SHE:	Oh yes what they're used to, what they always, yeah, I know 
*HEL:	but I mean, but like I said, I said, I mean, I went, I went to the   (.) like I changed then, I mean to be quite honest I didn't like it, I didn't like it 
*SHE:	 What the same people in school? 
*HEL:	 no I didn't  , I never liked it, whether that was because I knew we weren't gonna be there, or, you know, I just, I was only there six months 
*SHE:	Mm   (.) you would of done eventually, you would of got in alright, once you were settled and that 
*HEL:	I, you know, I just   (.) I would of been alright if it was a bit more organised  I don't   
*SHE:	 I think   
*HEL:	know it never seemed quite very organised 
*SHE:	they sent it back, I think, I thought the twelve was, was quite good actually, I thought the twelve when they went up at twelve, but then when they changed it back to the junior and infants it was the elev  , the eleven and it was a bit, I think it, you know eleven might be perhaps too young, I think twelve is a reasonable 
*HEL:	Mm 
*SHE:	age. 
*HEL:	But you see I was thrown from one teacher all the time Miss   all the time 
*SHE:	 Yeah to that   
*HEL:	 to, to German  , French, Latin 
*SHE:	Yeah 
*HEL:	er, you know proper algebra and all that kind of stuff and it, and it was, I think I would of been better if I had of gone to Our Ladies cos  I don't   
*SHE:	 Well I don't know  I mean it would of still been the same if you'd of gone to Our Ladies, it would of still been one, one 
*HEL:	One teacher 
*SHE:	Yeah 
*HEL:	was there? 
*SHE:	Yeah I think so 
*HEL:	I know, but 
*SHE:	yeah because they were the only one who would 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*SHE:	didn't we? 
*HEL:	I know, but that, at St. Hughes you're stuck in a little rut aren't you? I mean 
*SHE:	Well, the trouble is you got to be the eldest and you were the eldest for such a long time 
*HEL:	You mean we were the eldest for five years  there   
*SHE:	 Yeah  because you go to be the eldest and then just at the time you should of gone on and become the youngest, it changed so you were the eldest all the time 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	and that made the difference I think, that probably made the difference   
*HEL:	 That particularly didn't  bother me it was the regime, the sudden change in the regime 
*SHE:	Yeah 
*HEL:	you know   (.) I think I would of got used to it 
*SHE:	Oh I 
*HEL:	but you know. 
*SHE:	I feel surprised that I put, how thick was she? 
*HEL:	What? No, well you're not thick are you? 
*UNK:	 (  )  (.) 
*SHE:	So this is where you two get all this 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	what? 
*SHE:	supposedly cleverness 
*HEL:	Supposedly, when I, when I told Nicola the other day that you reckon that I don't do enough work, she says cor blimey   (.) she was shocked she was, shocked   (.) oh do it, do it as near to the microphone as you can mum 
*SHE:	What she doesn't want does she 
*UNK:	 (  )  (.) 
*SHE:	I don't think er, I don't think you do do work, enough work, either of you really   (.) I mean if I sat an eleven plus today, by what, if they ever brought it back, it'll be a lot different than what it was then 
*HEL:	I 
*SHE:	it'd be easy wouldn't it? (.)  
*HEL:	It wouldn't of been easier 
*SHE:	Well it would, it would of, it'd be easier, I think it would 
*HEL:	Not to everybody it wouldn't 
*SHE:	Well I think, I think, I think to be honest they've all got easier  (.)  
*HEL:	I'd say they'd got harder, you should see some of the things we do in maths mum, it's not easy 
*UNK:	  (  )  
*SHE:	 No I know that  , that's it's not easier now, you know, but I think er that would be easier wouldn't it? 
*HEL:	You know, I mean   (.) you, the problem with you and dad is, cos you never got particularly involved with it you don't, you don't know exactly what's happening at school, you don't know what we do. 
*SHE:	Well I've never got particularly involved with this school, I got involved with the other schools 
*HEL:	I know, but, mum that, that was, that was five years ago, I mean I've moved on a great deal since then 
*SHE:	Oh yeah, I know it's not, no I know it's not easy, I don't try to make out it's easy 
*HEL:	I mean some, some of them are what, what I would deem as fairly easy, I mean I find history easy, but not everyone does 
*SHE:	Oh no, I know that, I know that I mean some people find some things easy, some people find some things hard, don't they? But I mean that's er, a fact of life  (.)  
*HEL:	You know, but I mean, there's no way easy, especially the science and maths   (.) equals I times R, voltage and resistance in electricity and magnesium 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	what? 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	but er, that fibbing git Tim right he's got a locker next to me, and he's got velcro on his coat and if I'm standing at my locker and he takes his coat out of, out of his locker, it always flipping pull my tights with the velcro 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	that's the third time he's done it, I had such a go at him 
*SHE:	You'll have to charge him  (.)  
*HEL:	I'll have to   (.) I had a bit of major benny actually ha   (.) it was rather shocking wasn't it? 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	Not that I ever have major bennies or  anything   
*SHE:	 No, no   
*HEL:	I hadn't had a benny for a few days actually 
*SHE:	Oh 
*HEL:	I'm doing well    (.)  ((singing)) thought I died and gone to heaven    (7.0) I don't like plain chocolate it's horrible 
*SHE:	Shit  (.)  
*HEL:	take a 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*SHE:	pardon? 
*HEL:	Nothing, sarky remark, ((singing)) on my own just  
*SHE:	Ha, there was this girl in the club last night and somebody shouted at her and she went   ((shouting)) what?  ((laugh)) Oh dear I said to your dad Jesus 
*HEL:	Ladylike 
*SHE:	as common as muck   (.) what she goes  (7.0)  
*HEL:	I thought I could give dad some of these and then eat them all myself 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) for his birthday 
*SHE:	Well why not, I don't think that'll go down very well 
*HEL:	Don't you? 
*SHE:	No 
*HEL:	Well I'm really shocked mum, I was really going to do it honest 
*SHE:	Mm, I don't think so Helena Rosanne 
*HEL:	Eh   ((singing)) what you do to me all my  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	chuck me in there, chuck me in the closet   (.) hit me with your rhythm stick, hit me hard and hit me quick  (.)  
*SHE:	Hit me, hit me   (.) what's the time six o'clock isn't it? 
*HEL:	What? 
*SHE:	Six o'clock 
*HEL:	What's six o'clock? 
*SHE:	The time 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	it's half six 
*SHE:	Oh half six that was it yeah 
*HEL:	That's what it said on his little card 
*SHE:	Yes we thought he was going to somewhere else at six o'clock 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	Nicola didn't believe me when I told her she thought I was playing a joke 
*SHE:	What? 
*HEL:	When I told her about this 
*SHE:	Didn't she? 
*HEL:	I goes er, oh I'm recording it for this thing, she goes oh yeah my beard, ha, I was going I am, ha, but she didn't believe me, can I have some sauce please?  (.) There was definitely no chance of a walk that day, bit of Jayne Eyre there for you 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	Oops, that's what I call an honourary delight this is 
*SHE:	Mhm indeed 
*HEL:	What? 
*SHE:	Indeed 
*HEL:	Indeed   (.) what exciting lessons did you have to do? 
*SHE:	Nothing too exciting  (.)  
*HEL:	Well I had   (.) er, oh, what did I have? Something P E, maths, English and graphics, science, science, maths, English and graphic 
*SHE:	How comes you're so, you're so interested in the eleven plus and everything? 
*HEL:	We're having a discussion about erm, whether it should be brought back 
*SHE:	Oh  (.)  
*HEL:	I said definitely not, cos it makes rejects of people in society, therefore a   ((shouting)) what  
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	which they all do in my class, cos they're all thick   (.) I couldn't believe it right 
*SHE:	Well they're all supposedly got intelligent parents by the sou  , by the sound of things 
*HEL:	Oh not all of them, I was sat, I, I was sat there 
*SHE:	All thick like me 
*HEL:	and I went who's applying to go on to university or education after eighteen, so I put up my hand, turned round and flipping Stuart and Danny had put their hands up and I just went oh god, they're gonna do really well   (.) and Terry, and Terry, we're talking Terry, Terry who hasn't got a brain cell to rub together 
*SHE:	What, er, mm, he's in your class ain't he? 
*HEL:	so   (.) ah that boy, this is the one who said I think we should be allowed to hit girls 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	he supposedly, he, two short planks does not describe this boy, even Miss hates him   (.) that was it, she, we were having this discussion right in education, she goes, are you cynical about education Terry, he goes, no, he goes, oh she goes why? He goes I don't know what cynical means 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	I said, ah no and everyone in the class just cracked up   (.) sometimes you wonder, you wonder whether he does it on purpose   (.) he must do it on purpose, no one can be that thick 
*SHE:	How many was thinking of going on? 
*HEL:	Ninety five per cent  
*SHE:	Yeah, oh  (.)  
*HEL:	but erm like Vicky who's got, in her English folder, this is Vicky   Vicky, she's got in her literature she's got nine A's and one B and in her other I don't know what she's got, ten A's probably, mm she's not going to, she wants to be a nurse 
*SHE:	Oh does she? 
*HEL:	and er, like she said aren't you Vicky and she goes no miss, mm, you can't be a nurse till your eighteen 
*SHE:	No, no you can't go into student, student 
*HEL:	so like, you know, she's gonna stay on, do A levels and then go into it 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	because she might as well have some A levels just in case or whatever, but erm   (.) you know I, you know she's, you know, I can understand that actually, she's being quiet sensible about it she said there's nothing else I want to do and I might as well do something that I enjoy, you know, you've only got one life haven't you when  it comes down to it? 
*SHE:	 Well if that's what  she wants to do, that's what she wants to do, innit? 
*HEL:	Mm, like, her dad says to her why don't you be a doctor   (.) and she, but she don't want to, you know, she wants to be in a hospital and that, she don't want to end up in general practice 
*SHE:	Well she doesn't necessarily end up in general practice does she? 
*HEL:	No, but  (.)  
*SHE:	But I mean for the first year she won't be in, if she goes into student, she'll be in college 
*HEL:	I know, but it won't take as long for her to get there as it would if she becomes a doctor 
*SHE:	Oh no, three years ain't it a student? 
*HEL:	Mm 
*SHE:	But then you get on hand experience right   (.) hands on I should say, not on hand  (.)  
*HEL:	but erm 
*SHE:	learning how to clean pot pa  , er bed pans and make beds and things like that 
*HEL:	Clear up sick, that's a favourite job isn't it? 
*SHE:	Mm  (.)  
*HEL:	Yeah, I thought of being that once but   (.) I wouldn't mind it in the wards, but I wouldn't want to be in the operating theatre, I don't know why, the blood don't put me off or anything, but 
*SHE:	You do have to go into the theatre for so long I think 
*HEL:	Mm 
*SHE:	but then you can, you can specialize you see, I mean some nurses go into the theatre all the time once they've qualified 
*HEL:	Yeah 
*SHE:	I think they do have to go in, you have to go into each area 
*HEL:	But like, I mean I don't mind the blood or whatever, and if they were doing little things, I could handle it, but like, like on that op  , operation that woman was having the other day and they cut her open and they just pulled 
*SHE:	Well they do 
*HEL:	and that, that, that's the thing that makes me retch, not the cutting, it's when they just pull it apart 
*SHE:	Well  I know   
*HEL:	 when it rips  ooh, they could of cut it 
*SHE:	Well they do cut it 
*HEL:	No they cut the skin and then they just pulled it  apart   
*SHE:	 Yes  because it's not the like that underneath, if they didn't pull it apart they, they cut down, if they cut down with a knife they could cut into something couldn't they? 
*HEL:	Oh, er 
*SHE:	It could be dangerous so you, you open up the top and then the other parts   (.) the lining 
*HEL:	Ah 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	Yeah but what they ripped was all fat, all her fat, ooh 
*SHE:	Yeah, but you see, you've got the, you got all the other things in, down, down, underneath, well I mean if you started going in with a knife and you started cutting them I mean you could cut an artery or anything couldn't you? Which could be a bit nasty, you know    (7.0)  ((singing)) and then she'd say buy a little bag for me, a chick, a chick, a chick, a chickita  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*SHE:	who's turn is it tonight? 
*HEL:	Oh mine   (.) oh, I wish it was David, probably never get 
*UNK:	 (  )  (.) 
*SHE:	We've seen it on T V 
*UNK:	 (  )  (.)  (  ) 
*SHE:	flower  (.)  
*HEL:	but, I was listening to myself on that 
*SHE:	Mm 
*HEL:	Oh is my laugh vile or what   (.) and my voice 
*SHE:	 ((laugh)) 
*HEL:	it sounds so idiotic  (.)  
*SHE:	 ((laugh))  (.) That's cos you be a country yoke
