@Comment:	conversation #143 (Tape 039707)
*LUC:	It had Steve Martin in it, it's a comedy •347072_350412•
*TER:	Yeah •350862_351162•
*LUC:	it's called Father of the Bride and it's about this wedding kind of thing •351722_356902•
*TER:	Oh, er, I, I have to plead my ignorance I don't even know who Steve Martin is. •359302_362642•
        Well how can we help today? •365292_366522•
*LUC:	I finished this book •367872_369152•
*TER:	Did you? •369322_369812•
*LUC:	Yeah •372322_372412•
*TER:	Good  so let's see what you did, who did you go to the pictures with? •372412_387682•
*LUC:	Oh my friend Emma •387682_388952•
*TER:	Emma? •389822_390062•
        So where did you go from here? •393622_404672•
*LUC:	Yeah, where it starts in the pen •404672_406972•
*TER:	Where it starts in the pen  mm  what was it? •407282_432412•
        Right  right, so let us see what we can do shall we? •432412_481582•
        Erm where do we start? •481582_484352•
*LUC:	I need a •484352_485272•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	there yeah, •485472_487832•
*LUC:	Yeah •488702_488922•
*TER:	E two, now you've got to work out the average speed, right  try and think roughly what the answer would be, because if you thought of that, then you would know that's a silly answer, cos look, how far is the journey? •489412_521602•
*LUC:	A hundred and twenty miles •521602_523422•
*TER:	Right, well say, a nice, you know just to the nearest, to the nearest erm whole number •523422_527932•
*LUC:	A hundred  •527932_528262•
*TER:	Right  •528442_528682•
*LUC:	and twenty seven miles •528682_529272•
*TER:	A hundred and twenty seven, what's that to the nearest hour? •529272_534282•
*LUC:	Two hours •534282_535742•
*TER:	Right, so if it goes say a hundred and twenty six miles  or a hundred and twenty miles, to the nearest ten miles, it goes a hundred and twenty miles in two hours  how far would it go in one hour? •535842_550472•
*LUC:	Sixty •550472_550662•
*TER:	Right, sixty  so that can't be right can it? •551482_557432•
        Right, so how are you gonna find the average speed, what do you do to find that average speed? •557432_564062•
        You divide what by what? •564062_565832•
*LUC:	Divide that by that •565832_567212•
*TER:	Right, but, what are you gonna divide that by on a calculator? •567622_572302•
*LUC:	Two point twelve •572302_573902•
*TER:	No, this is the whole thing isn't it? •574092_577712•
        Don't you remember look  if there were a hundred minutes in an hour that would be two point one two, but there's not a hundred minutes in an hour are there? •577712_591002•
        How many minutes are there in an hour? •591002_592782•
*LUC:	Sixty •592782_593112•
*TER:	Right, now look, it says there, so what's twelve minutes? •593222_600972•
*LUC:	Nought point two •600972_604062•
*TER:	Right, so what are you gonna divide that by to get the average speed? •604292_608862•
*LUC:	Twelve point two •608882_610132•
*TER:	No •610132_610422•
*LUC:	Nought point  •610672_614212•
*TER:	what's the time? •614432_617682•
*LUC:	Erm two hours and twelve minutes •617682_621912•
*TER:	Right, how do you write that as a decimal of an hour? •621912_625552•
        What's two hours, twelve minutes? •625552_630372•
        Look  you've got two hours and you've got twelve minutes, now what fraction of an hour is twelve minutes? •630372_642162•
*LUC:	Erm  five •642162_642692•
*TER:	No, what, twelve minutes is what fraction of an hour? •643762_651122•
*LUC:	Oh, nought point two •651122_653612•
*TER:	Right, so that equals the minutes is point two, how many hours? •653612_662002•
*LUC:	Two •662002_662502•
*TER:	So two hours, twelve minutes is two point two  •663622_672262•
*LUC:	Two  •672262_672602•
*TER:	hours •672602_673012•
*LUC:	Yeah •673952_674612•
*TER:	Right, so to find the average speed what you gonna do? •674652_678232•
*LUC:	Two hours divided by •678232_679962•
*TER:	Right, but and what that by  •680282_682172•
*LUC:	That divide by that •682172_683322•
*TER:	divide, come on say again •683522_685602•
*LUC:	That •685602_685852•
*TER:	That by, by what? •686142_687542•
*LUC:	Two point two •687542_688862•
*TER:	Right  •689322_689632•
*LUC:	Fifty eight  •689632_698702•
*TER:	That's right  right, well what about the next one? •703972_720112•
*LUC:	Doesn't say •720112_727742•
*TER:	Well how many minutes is it? •727982_729312•
*LUC:	Nought point nine five •729312_730432•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	nought point nine five •731042_735362•
*TER:	Where does fifty eight come? •736332_738982•
*LUC:	There •738982_739282•
*TER:	Does it? •741002_742722•
*LUC:	No •742722_742852•
*TER:	Right, there, so what are you gonna divide it by? •745372_750082•
*LUC:	Mm •750122_750212•
*TER:	That's nought point eight, nought point nine, nought point nine five, nought point nine •751952_758712•
*LUC:	Six •758802_759372•
*TER:	six and that's half way to it so that's nought point nine, six, five  •761442_765002•
*LUC:	Five  •765072_765192•
*TER:	Look, nought point nine, six, five and so you're gonna divide •765312_772202•
*LUC:	Five •772202_772822•
*TER:	you're gonna divide fifty point five  by  •773642_776452•
*LUC:	Fifty two •778592_784632•
*TER:	Right  right now D  •784882_795552•
*LUC:	Well that one point two •795552_804532•
*TER:	That's right  •804672_805232•
*LUC:	forty two •805232_815632•
*TER:	Right  right, now, the next one •815632_829972•
*LUC:	Er  how you gonna take it out of it? •829972_854272•
        Three at, thirty nine •857302_858902•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LUC:	thirty nine  •858902_859182•
*TER:	So what is it? •859472_860302•
*LUC:	Two hours, thirty nine minutes •860442_861422•
*TER:	Right, two hours, thirty nine, right  •861552_866982•
*LUC:	Two point six, five •871422_882182•
*TER:	Right  •882212_882432•
*LUC:	Seventy two •883432_895142•
*TER:	Right  •895242_895412•
*LUC:	I've got erm, how many hours and all this written down at home if you want me to bring that up •895632_913282•
*TER:	Erm •913922_914092•
*LUC:	write all the hours down  •916432_917692•
*TER:	Yes you can do •917692_918802•
