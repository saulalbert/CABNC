@Comment:	conversation #152 (Tape 002622)
*DAV:	What I'll do to pick it up   (        ) play a game, probably play a game later  (        ) .Get used to those shots, right.
*CHR:	Oh.
*DAV:	Problem is when you're demonstrating is you tend to do things wrong   (        )  ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	I mean, you should be able to   (        ) have an awful lot of gap.
*CHR:	They don't do they, no.
*DAV:	 (        ) about an eighth in size.Yes, this standard is alright, but the championship would be about a sixteen.Though what you should do is, is, just walk up to the ball, that line through there.
*CHR:	Oh right.
*DAV:	It enables you to line that up.
*CHR:	It's, it's a sight.Yes, yes.
*DAV:	It's fairly important that as, when you walk up to the ball you're body is in line with, where you want to be.
*CHR:	Right, right.
*DAV:	And then, as you walk up, you really should sort of almost end in the ideal place and then having lined up the shot, put it through like that.
*CHR:	Right and it's anticipated that you will strike the erm, the hoop in the process.
*DAV:	Yes, yes, there's no harm in that, I mean it would be nice to go through cleanly, but 
*CHR:	Right , yes.
*DAV:	How you hold the mallet is really up to you, eh there are many different ways, you can hold it like that, you can hold it down there, up there
*CHR:	Oh.
*DAV:	like that, just a, however you feel comfortable.
*CHR:	It's, it's a question of control and movement.
*DAV:	You'll find it  (        ) , the better   (        ) I don't rank much but, tend, tend, to, to, just do that and it'll go through.
*CHR:	Yes, yes.You tend to let the mallet do the work rather than 
*DAV:	Yes.
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes, yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) quite the height.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	 (        ) same sort of height as me, and surely  (        ) .Anyway just, just try that.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) .Obviously taking a bit harder.
*CHR:	Right, yes.
*DAV:	Can you see, that ball weighs about a pound, so gotta be able to
*CHR:	Yeah, right, right.
*DAV:	You take a bit of force.
*CHR:	Yes, yes, quite.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes, yes, I, yes I take your point.
*DAV:	 (        ) .If you're going to approach the   (        ) that's the striker's move.
*CHR:	I see.
*DAV:	That  (        ) .
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	So you'll try and just get the back a little, lean perhaps a little bit over towards there, like that, erm, (        ) 
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Then if you want blue to go the other side of the hoop and black to go here say, to   (        ) the black won't go quite so far and the blue will  (        ) .
*CHR:	Right, so that you'll do a clean run through.
*DAV:	Then you can   (        ) that ball again.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right.Then you've got a continuation shot.
*DAV:	Having run   (        ) you've got another continuation shot.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	You then take  (        ) , that's how you would progress through the hoop.
*CHR:	Right, right, and you'll use an opponent's ball normally or any ball?
*DAV:	When you're  (        ) , until you're in danger of breaking down, I mean breaking down would be when you'd approach the hoop like that and you realize you can't run it.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	And you've got your opponent's ball the other side of the hoop, and the blue ball's over there somewhere, so you obviously wouldn't try and run the hoop, you'll just join back up with your partner's ball.
*CHR:	To scupper the opposition.
*DAV:	Well he, he   (        ) 
*CHR:	To give him nothing to play with.Yes, yes.
*DAV:	Erm, no, I mean, ideally you'll make the break if you have another ball  (        ) .
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Having made the two, comes through to there, you just having clear of the metal work, you put, this is a three foot  (        ) , just not in it at the moment  (        ) .
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	You'd want to put that yellow ball up on your next hoop and   (        ) and get black somewhere near the blue, so then you can run that  (        ) .
*CHR:	I see, yes, yes.
*DAV:	Something like that, it's not very good. (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes, oh yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) .The trouble is with demonstrating is talking as well as.
*CHR:	No, no, no problem.
*DAV:	 (        ) .I need to get that, just that little bit further this time
*CHR:	Right, right.
*DAV:	round the hoop, well that   (        ) should come back up. (        ) , like to come back up onto the yard line.
*CHR:	I see, now what about the red?
*DAV:	Well.
*CHR:	We ignore that as we're not actually playing.
*DAV:	 (        ) .Ideally that would be in the middle there somewhere as a pivot.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	To, you've gone through the hoop, so  (        ) , you've pushed so  (        ) .
*CHR:	Oh so it's not a straightforward round the outside, and up the middle  (        ) ?
*DAV:	Oh you have to got there in a minute.
*CHR:	Yes, I see.
*DAV:	We're putting red, we're putting blue on the  (        ) .
*CHR:	Oh I see, I see, yes.
*DAV:	I'm just going up near red ourselves.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	That's a bit better.
*CHR:	Yes, smashing.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right, so long as we then strike yellow, we can put it in.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Move forward onto the hoop.
*DAV:	Yes.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Doesn't matter if yellow goes off.Doesn't matter if the ball goes off in the  (        ) , or when you're running a hoop, it just comes back up.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	But at any other time it's the end of your turn.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Now we've got, this is a roll shot, (        ) , and we want the yellow to go beyond and the black to stop just in front of of the hoop.
*CHR:	Right.
*DAV:	Oh.
*CHR:	Does that matter?
*DAV:	 (        ) .Should be able to get through there.Secret here is to miss that.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	If you miss that, it's got to go through.
*CHR:	Yep.
*DAV:	Well, if you put a, just hit it down a little bit, I got, probably won't get through, but if you hit it down a little bit to give it a bit of spin it might carry it through.very nearly didn't it?
*CHR:	Mm.
*DAV:	You see it?
*CHR:	Yes, yes.
*DAV:	If it had been spinning a bit more, it would of kept on.
*CHR:	Yep, yep.
*DAV:	Let's just assume that we've hit that, erm that would have been 
*CHR:	That would have 
*DAV:	that would have been the end of my turn.
*CHR:	Oh would it?No, it's got, it's got to be cleanly through, right, fine.
*DAV:	This side.
*CHR:	Yes, yes.
*DAV:	So what you see people doing is this, oh no, you shouldn't do that.
*CHR:	Aha.
*DAV:	I say to you, well I mean I say to you it's not through, that's accepted.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	If I say to you do you think that's through
*CHR:	Yes, yes, very questionable, well it's, it's
*DAV:	 (        ) they say to me, yes that's through, it's O K, so that's it you don't have to
*CHR:	Right, right.
*DAV:	I think really if you're doing that, you should ask somebody else to come and
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	But once you do that, soon as you put your mallet against the hoop, you push the hoop if it's loose forward anyway
*CHR:	Yes, indeed you have, yes, yes.
*DAV:	and eh, you've obviously dislodged the situation where somebody else should argue perhaps, (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes yes, yes, that's right yes.
*DAV:	But if, if I say to you no I'm sorry Chris that's through
*CHR:	Mm, mm.
*DAV:	then you would have to accept it, cos it's really the person who's in play who's the referee.
*CHR:	Yes right , I see.
*DAV:	In a certain and friendly way.
*CHR:	Yes , yes indeed, yes, fine.
*DAV:	I mean, I, I would say, almost certain that's not true is it?
*CHR:	I, I can just see a touch of the black.
*DAV:	That's right, it's not through, I mean we both agree it's not through 
*CHR:	Mm quite, quite, yes.
*DAV:	but you'll see players who, I mean, I mean, did it the other day when I was playing and she did this, oh yes, she   (        ) I said you've moved it, I thoroughly accepted it wasn't through, you shouldn't do that.
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	How can, how can you possibly put that ball back where it was ?
*CHR:	Yes, absolutely , yes.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	You can see it wasn't through, we both agreed it.
*CHR:	Yes, yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) .Erm, push that yellow down, (        ) , erm, so let push it down there, ah, not hard enough, because the black should have gone nearer to the red.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	And then   (        ) red down to blue   (        ) all the way round.
*CHR:	I see, yes.
*DAV:	Very  ((laugh))
