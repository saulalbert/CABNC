@Comment:	conversation #16 (Tape 029606)
*AND:	They cut a small hole in a tennis ball, stuff all the match heads into the ball until you can't  fit any more in   
*MAR:	 Oh Rich   
*AND:	that's gonna probably gonna cost you about 
*MAR:	she's recording this. 
*AND:	So? 
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) So? 
*AND:	So that's gonna ma  that's gonna be about  three quid's worth of matches. 
*MAR:	 Giving away secret information of  how to make bombs. 
*AND:	Then tape over it with duck tape, make sure it is real nice and tight then when you see a geek walking down the street give it a good throw   (.) you will have a blast. ((laugh))  
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*AND:	That is ace. (.)  
*HEL:	It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what you say. 
*MAR:	Say. 
*HEL:	Say. (.)  
*MAR:	Who are you giving it to? (.)  
*HEL:	  (  )  
*AND:	 Except that this is highly  highly  illegal information   (  )   
*MAR:	  (  ) ? 
*HEL:	What? 
*MAR:	 (  )  (.) what? 
*HEL:	 They're doing a survey   
*AND:	 Here you are, napalm  napalm lightbulb. 
*HEL:	on like what words different  (  )  
*AND:	 Heat kerosene and   (  ) gasoline in a double boiler, melt soap chips and stir in slowly, put somewhere and allow to cool. Heat the thread of the bulb very carefully to melt the glue, remove thread slowing drawing out the filament, do not break the   (  ) electrical   (  ) or filament will, just won't work   (.) pour the liquid into the bulb and slowly lower the filament back   (  ) dipped in some  (  ) . Redo the thread back on and turn it into a socket frequently used by the victim and get the hell out. ((laugh))   
*HEL:	  (  ) and like what  accent people are talking at 
*MAR:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	Yeah. Well it's how we, it's how we usually talk isn't it? 
*MAR:	 (  ) that much usually. 
*HEL:	What? 
*MAR:	We don't   (  ) that much  (  )  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*HEL:	No but I mean    (.)  (  ) conversation, it's conversation with my friends and conversation with my parents  (  )  
*AND:	When the victim switches the switch he will be in for a big surprise.  (.) Basically you've killed him.  (.) It just blows the whole room up.  ((laughing)) Have fun it says underneath . ((laugh))   
*HEL:	  (  )  till tomorrow. I've only done three tapes, he gave me twenty. 
*MAR:	He gave you twenty tapes? 
*AND:	Yeah here you are this is a good one, calcium carbine bomb  (  ) .  This is extremely dangerous. 
*MAR:	 And they  wanted you to do all of them? 
*HEL:	No. You only have to do as many as you can. 
*AND:	Exercise extreme caution. Obtain some calcium carbine  this is   (  ) and can be found at nearly every hardware store. Take a few pieces of this stuff, it looks like gravel   
*MAR:	 You've brought a load  round with you now have you, to do? ((laugh))  
*HEL:	What? 
*MAR:	Are you gonna do a load   (  ) tonight? 
*HEL:	No. I'll give him whatever  I do. 
*AND:	 and put it in  a glass jar with some water, put a lid on tightly. The carbine will react with the water  to produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in cutting torches. Eventually the glass will explode from internal pressure, it will leave a burning ragged hole and you get a nice fire ball.  ((laugh)) Be excellent wouldn't it? 
*MAR:	 Giving away trade secrets  of how to make bombs here you know.  (.) Is it a good microphone? 
*HEL:	What? 
*MAR:	 (  ) microphone   (.)  (  )

*AND:	Yeah. 
*JOA:	Don't matter then. 
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*AND:	No, what your  whiff   
*MAR:	 Don't keep  mine in there  cos he uses it. 
*AND:	  (  )  What? 
*MAR:	You use my deodorant if I leave it in there. 
*AND:	No I don't.
