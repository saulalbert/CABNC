*PAU:	Who was on it? 
*CAR:	Don't know who was on it actually. Well she doesn't like M C Hammer, he was on, and then there was one week with Germans on it and it was, erm, it's a German group that used to be popular and haven't done a song for ages. 
*CHA:	It wasn't the Robots was it? 
*CAR:	Yeah, the Robots. I mean, it was just   (.) the words they were using, I mean oh   (.) It makes you cringe, oh and then that er girl   (.) oh she's done quite a few things recently.  (.) She sings much better than she talks.
