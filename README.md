CABNC transcription
====================

## Outline
This project aims to collate audio data and produce CA-level transcriptions of
recordings from a sample of a subcorpus of the AudioBNC version of the [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/).

Names of folders and files correspond to tapes from the [Audio BNC](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC)

## Data
[The Audio BNC](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) contains about 7.5 million words of recorded speech, all of
it already roughly transcribed, with audio recordings of sufficient quality for
automated phonetic transcriptions, and full Praat TextGrid files aligning audio
to transcriptions are available for the entire corpus. There are also
comprehensive wordclass and part-of-speech tag annotations. Within the overall
BNC corpus, this project focuses on a subcorpus of 152 texts containing rough
transcripts of audio files, labelled by BNC transcribers with the following
tags:

* Overall category: Demographically sampled (subjects carrying audio recorders around)
* Interaction type: Dialogue (rather than speeches/monologues)
* Genre type: conv. (conversation).

These are conversations around water-coolers, in corridors, bus-stops, homes
etc. and as such, most useful for analysing natural talk-in-interaction. There
are 4,228,314 words in this subcorpus. There are several existing methods to
access and use this data:

1. via the Audio BNC (Oxford Phonetics Institute): existing rough transcripts are available on the [Audio BNC site](http://bnc.phon.ox.ac.uk/transcripts-html) the target subcorpus consists of files KB0 to KSW in that list. A downloadable html archive of this subcorpus is available here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/o24z0ab71ierkim/cabnc_transcripts.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o24z0ab71ierkim/cabnc_transcripts.tar.gz). Access to the corresponding audio and Praat TextGrid files is described [on the AudioBNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access).

2. Via Lancaster University's [BNCweb tool](http://bncweb.lancs.ac.uk/): there is a new web-based interface for searching the BNC (but not browsing it) on the Lancaster BNCweb site, which requires a login. This site enables researchers to build subcorpora, search for keywords, parts of speech, or browse subsections of files and listen to the corresponding audio. 

## Rights
BNC transcripts are free to use for research, but cannot be redistributed as
such due to copyright restrictions. The Audio BNC files and the Praat TextGrids
are licensed Creative Commons By-Attribution, which means they can be used in
any way (including for commercial exploitation), as long as they are referenced
in derivative works. Correspondingly, a CC-BY license will be used to license
transcriptions resulting from this project.

## Transcription process
With over 4.2 million words and over 200 hours of audio in the target
subcorpus, a full transcription is not feasible. Therefore a sample of the
subcorpus will be transcribed equating to 400 hours of CA transcription work.
Varying sound quality in the corpus, variable numbers of speakers in each
recording and the resulting variable complexity of detailed CA transcription
work means only an estimate can be provided as to how much of the subcorpus
this will produce. Tests of transcribing simple two-party talk from Audio BNC
recordings suggests an average rate of between 8 and 10 coded words/minute,
therefore the project goal is to code between 192,000 and 240,000 words (or
4.5%-5.7% of the entire subcorpus).

The transcriptions will be made using up-to-date [Jeffersonian CA transcriptions](http://homepages.lboro.ac.uk/~ssca1/notation.htm), using the CHAT CA file formats and transcription symbols provided by the [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/) transcription system.
