*UNK:	The sheep to cross the road and 
*NON:	Mm.
*SIM:	quite unusual!I'd never seen it before and that's the one time I've seen it.
*NON:	I can remember when you'd see   (.) a cloud of dust, perhaps it'll be a mile away   (.) and this would be   (.) a flock of sheep.Course, they hadn't had   (.) lorries in them days, they drive them on the road   (.) and you see old shepherd coming along with a couple of dogs   (.) and goodness knows how many sheep!And of course, the roads were all gravel then, no tarmac, see this cloud of dust across there.And er   (.) if you see it was coming towards   (.) of course you run into them, but if they were going the other way   (.) course the dust still keep going.But   (.) but of course this was many years ago.Never see a flock of sheep on the road now.It's all done with cars.
*SIM:	You wouldn't like this dairy you wouldn't.
*NON:	It er   (.) oh!It used to be   (.) occasional or more perhaps, sometimes show time   (.) different shows and that.So many sheep   (.) or, ha   (.) show time see, you see these flocks of shop   (.) but now you always 
*SIM:	Been to a cattle market.
*NON:	That's a long time ago because se  (.) the roads have been tarmacked for goodness knows how long now!I can remember when the first bit of tarmac was put on a road round here   (.) and that down here at Upton bypass   (.) and all 
*NON:	Oh yes!
*NON:	what they call Upton bypass.
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	Oh it was er   (.) cry over war wound!Oh!Horses will never be able to stand on it!It's slippery and that.What a state they were in then!My father had er, horses at that time and   (.) my uncle out at Holt, he had some horses   (.) they were talking about this one day and   (.) uncles would say   (.) well a horse didn't work nearly as hard with that   (.) road's were nice and solid.Father said well it's, it's so slippery they can't stand on them.But it wasn't, it wasn't slippery see, but they thought it would be.
*SIM:	Yeah.
*NON:	An  (.) oh!I can remember when that   (.) Upton bypass, when it was done   (.) the cry there was about that!Mm.Course, it   (.) it used to be the old rough gravel road.
*SIM:	Can you remember Ascot Road?
*NON:	Mm?
*SIM:	Ascot Road?
*NON:	Ascot, oh!Er no 
*SIM:	The little shack
*NON:	Mm.
*SIM:	then, it was meant to be the oldest house.
*NON:	Mm.No.No.
*SIM:	Do you know what I'm saying?
*NON:	Yeah.
*SIM:	No?
*NON:	Yeah.Oh yeah.Aye, aye, aye, aye.
*NON:	Just off Clarendon Road, dad.
*NON:	Eh?
*NON:	Just off Clarendon Road.
*NON:	Clarendon Road?Er   (.) ooh yes!Clarendon Road, yeah.Course I ye , I walked up the top of Clarendon Road there when a  (.) I was first going out to work up there   (.) old Bill .
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	Mm.I can remember that.
*NON:	Well 
*SIM:	Mm.
*NON:	it's a road that goes through there to Swingdale Road   (.) and there's a little place in there.
*SIM:	Little blue and white wooden hut.
*NON:	Mhm.
*SIM:	It was.
*NON:	I dunno.Over   (.) my uncle er   (.) old Harry    (.) he had a house around Clarendon Road   (.) er   (.) oh I dunno!There wasn't many houses there at that time.Mm mm.
*SIM:	We built our house there.
*NON:	Mm?
*SIM:	Erm   (.) it was meant to be the oldest house in erm   (.) Broadstone
*NON:	Ah?
*SIM:	and we built our hou , not, bought the plot of land and built our own house on it.
*NON:	Well   (.) old Harry  shared with my uncle   (.) he had his house and he bought a piece of land on the bottom of his garden   (.) and he built wall on   (.) his   (        ) or this piece along the bottom of his garden, but er   (.) I couldn't tell you, it wasn't very far up the road.But er   (.) yeah I know.But I haven't been up to cla  (.) Clarendon Road for some time now.Er   (.) ha! (.) There used to be a   (.) a house on the end of the common up at Clarendon Road, the opposite side   (.) oh!Er   (.) old Mrs    (.) I dunno, but th , anyway there was   (.) only this one old house up in the common and er   (.) I went up there one time with   (.) horse and    (        )  (.) take a couple of pigs from there down to Wimborne market.But I suppose the old house has pulled down under pressure and built on now but   (.) that was the only house going up through there in them days.That was a very old house!
*SIM:	Wimborne market's supposed to be old.
*NON:	Mm?
*SIM:	Wimborne market must be very old!
*NON:	Oh Lord, yes!Course   (.) we , Wimborne cattle market is finished now isn't it? (        ) 
*SIM:	I went to a cattle market in 
*NON:	Mm.
*SIM:	Devon
*NON:	Mm.
*SIM:	with my aunt.
*NON:	Ah yeah.Er    (.)  [laughing] ha  [] !Wimborne market every Tuesday   (.) and Wimborne horse sale every other Friday.Used to have   (.) horse sale every fortnight, see every other Friday. (.) Ha!You wouldn't think that there was a   (.) enough business to want a horse sale once a fortnight would you?But   (.) mm. (.) Course, it was horses in them days, not motorcars.I can remember   (.) first motorcar that we drove in    (        )  (.) old Charlie  's.Old Charlie's   (.) car   (.) wooden spokes, wooden wheels   (.) solid tyres   (.) and he used to sit up right in there   (.) same as I am now, like in a box   (.) and the old chauffeur    (.) was the chauffeur driving along.And I suppose they go along about   (.) I don't expect they do about six miles an hour.Just, chug, chug, chug, chug.
*SIM:	At least it was some other form of transport than a horse.
*NON:	Oh yes!
*SIM:	Gave the horses a bit of a rest.
*NON:	Mm.Er er er   (.) er er er
*SIM:	I would think the mo , motorcar nowadays can go up to something like two hundred odd miles now is it?
*NON:	Yeah.Mm.
*SIM:	And when you see them racing on the television!
*NON:	Mm.Oh yeah. (.) Ah!But don't matter what it is everything is increasing in speed.Now you see   (.) in my days on the railway   (.) sixty miles an hour was a good speed for a train it di  (.) it didn't reckon to   (.) do much more than that see.I know   (.) er, down at Corfe Junction or a   (.) one road across or one another across or   (.) there was one road going to Wimborne, one going to Broadstone, up road and down road.And of course, they had these signs up   (.) about la  (.) up close to a signal   (.) er   (.) twenty, twenty five or thirty or whatever it was, that was miles an hour, they were supposed to reduce to that.And er   (.) I can remember one day a driver, Len  his name was and   (.) he er   (.) he said to the inspector, oh he says er   (.) I've been through Corfe Junction he said at sixty miles an hour!What!Ooh he said, you don't wanna make a song about it!But he said, I have done.And er   (.) course, that where the restrictions was on see   (.) at the   (.) and of course, after that, a few years after that, of course take no notice of it now.It all goes on the same.Er   (.) er   (.) it were just the same on a motorcycle   (.) the faster he'll go the better they'd like it!
*SIM:	It's still the same nowadays isn't it?You get the youngsters that hare off down the road   (.)  (        ) .
*NON:	Mm.Ah. (.) What's this, the news on now Margaret?
*SIM:	Yeah.
*NON:	Oh! (.) Do you want it?
*SIM:	Sorry?
*NON:	Do you want the news?
*SIM:	I don't mind.
*NON:	Mm.If you'd like to put it on a little louder.
*NON:	I think we'll be away dad because 
*NON:	Ah?
*NON:	it's coming in quite foggy.
*NON:	Is it?
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	Mm.You got that er, ticket Margaret.
*NON:	Yes, I'll get your si , your things for you tomorrow.
*NON:	Ah.Well I hope you've been able to pick up a bit of something but   (.) I'm not very good at it myself cos   (.) old days and old times.
*SIM:	Just casual talking.
*NON:	He said   (.) he   (        ) well he said 
*NON:	Yeah.
*NON:	course, cars.
