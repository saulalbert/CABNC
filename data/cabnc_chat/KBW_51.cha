*DOR:	Like when you go round National Trust Homes don't you, they're all a 
*GRO:	 (  )  (.) 
*DOR:	You didn't get me any song books did you? 
*MAR:	No 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) I was just thinking of  two minutes ago like last week   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*MAR:	that's all 
*DOR:	all two minutes I thought, oh she's brought song books home, she's keen and enthusiastic with 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	that, because it would of been a lot of effort on part   
*MAR:	 I would, I, I just get them out  . 
*ROS:	You were damn rude darling 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	Yeah 
*ROS:	being in an attitude you've forgot to 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) , no it's alright. 
*AND:	But it's more convenient for you to go in that church  if anybody else   
*ROS:	 Oh it is   
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Probably a bit of a strain   ((laugh))  (.)  
*AND:	Nice school? 
*DOR:	Yeah, you can volunteer if you like 
*AND:	No 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	that school 
*DOR:	also there's a 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	it won't be 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	Did it come off once didn't it? (.)  
*ROS:	What have you done? 
*DOR:	Nothing  (.)  
*MAR:	I, erm, Barry and 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Do what Mary? 
*MAR:	I'm not sure if they're going away this weekend, I'm not sure when they're going  (.)  
*DOR:	Oh, well they're not going tomorrow  ((laugh))  
*MAR:	Oh, must be Friday then, I knew they were going away for the week, weekend 
*ROS:	That's very nice too. 
*MAR:	The first time 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	were saying this  (.)  
*DOR:	It's tricky to have to get here 
*MAR:	I know  ((laugh))  
*AND:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	the evil look, I shall move in a minute  ((laugh))  
*ROS:	 Bite back   
*MAR:	 Funny old tramp  , the leaves fall of him without those, they get stalkier and stalkier as time goes on 
*ROS:	Yeah, yeah well I've got an ordinary   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*MAR:	A 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	pot, it came from 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ROS:	I've got an ordinary 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	just keep peeling the bottom ones off it, just get 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	missing 
*MAR:	My yucca's dying 
*DOR:	Oh dear 
*ROS:	That could well be the compost, poor leaves and things 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Maybe 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	Well I think I've over watered it 
*AND:	Best to  let it   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*MAR:	I know I'm, I'm 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	I don't water mine very often I wait till the, one of the leaves start to go a bit yellow and then 
*MAR:	Oh 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	I don't like them personally 
*DOR:	Why not? 
*MAR:	 somebody else wanted one   
*ROS:	 I hated it   
*DOR:	Ah, there you are. 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	similar to 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	chopped it up and then 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	and I've got twins 
*ROS:	Oh that's nice 
*DOR:	We've got one at work that looks like a tree 
*GRO:	 (  )  (  ) 
*DOR:	together? 
*MAR:	it's about twelve feet, no, yeah about twelve feet tall. 
*AND:	I've put it on the stairs you see so it's got like double height to go to, it's nearly filled that, the thing is, the 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	at the bottom then about six foot gap and then 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	at the top 
*DOR:	Yeah, ((laugh))  
*AND:	the 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	the branch goes to the top 
*DOR:	You won't do it like that, you'll have to sort of  
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	I suppose a handle of 
*GRO:	 (  )  (.) 
*DOR:	Well now, that'll do us 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	instead of having, I mean you don't think at the time, but what she should of said was can I go away, come back for another interview another day, which means she, she's 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	for the hour because all she could think of was this 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	of course if she told me as soon as she'd done it 
*DOR:	Yeah 
*ROS:	I cou  , I would of said well right tell them 
*DOR:	yeah, yeah 
*MAR:	Mm 
*ROS:	ask them for another go, of course she left it till she had the results and then told me   (.) so I'm writing now to the 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	yeah 
*AND:	Mm. 
*ROS:	 so, cos she's stuck in working   
*MAR:	 Even if she's not   
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	selling curtains for them and erm obviously she was 
*GRO:	 (  )  (  ) 
*DOR:	Is there anybody we know that's any good at tuitioning? 
*MAR:	Oh, I come back from 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	of private lessons but I just really can't get a grip of it. 
*DOR:	No, I meant just sort of somebody we know 
*ROS:	 What would we have to do? 
*AND:	 The trouble is that   
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	like if you were dyslexic I could help you. 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	I could help with maths 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	You've got to know the syllabus though and you've got to know what, I don't know what 
*DOR:	Yeah you've got to know what you're doing 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	It's not a case of helping because in the letters I know what, I know what I'm doing, I'm just, I'm just gone to, 
*DOR:	yeah 
*ROS:	I've got everything right, actually what I did and I couldn't give you, I haven't got a clue, trigonometry, well I couldn't tell you how to do it, I should 
*GRO:	  (  )  
*DOR:	 That's why you need  somebody you can ring up and say look, we did this yesterday what am I doing wrong today? 
*MAR:	Yeah. 
*ROS:	It goes out my head from one week to the next, I can't keep it, I know what I'm doing   
*DOR:	 Keep it up   
*ROS:	at the time 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	some sort of 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	 but again if, if somebody who knows about the G C S E actual course   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*MAR:	you know the G C S E, did you know about 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	yeah I did that  at school   
*DOR:	 Someone  must teach it somewhere. 
*ROS:	Erm, oh erm  (.)  
*DOR:	Who? 
*ROS:	Mike   
*AND:	I was gonna say Mike   has had a degree in that 
*ROS:	He 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	but he might know 
*AND:	What you'd have to do, you know, you tell him what you need to know, he'll be able to tell you how to do it. 
*MAR:	Oh I don't even wanna do it, I just need 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	It's good book though isn't it? 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	books here, yeah, I just, read them, I don't know if I can do it I 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	but it, he needs to find out what he needs to teach you through the book so you know 
*ROS:	What you need to do is to find 
*AND:	books are they 
*ROS:	a memory thing, that will, you know, click your memory, you know how some people have an a 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	yeah  (.)  
*DOR:	well 
*MAR:	I know what you mean 
*AND:	I can just remember though you know over  the   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*DOR:	 No I remember   
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	I just need something that reminds you of what you've done rather than, er  (.)  
*MAR:	Like my 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	I just can't remember that twenty  (.)  
*DOR:	Well, you'll pass 
*MAR:	No you don't pass or fail you get given marks out 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Yeah, but I mean you only 
*MAR:	that was 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	and I'd written down 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	just sit down and listen, then read the question wrong 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	write down the answer 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	anything from 
*GRO:	 (  )  (  ) 
*AND:	What I could never do was 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	but I could never do them 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	being those things like  well I can't do those tables   
*DOR:	 all the   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*DOR:	 and what not   
*MAR:	at all, I've never since a child remember 
*AND:	Well you should of been learning those 
*MAR:	I've tried, I can't for the life of me  remember them   
*AND:	 I can't remember   
*MAR:	I've tried 
*GRO:	  (  )  
*DOR:	 Can you get up to five, fives? 
*MAR:	twenty five 
*DOR:	Yeah, but can you get up to that, like get all your other tables? 
*MAR:	No, I can't  remember   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*GRO:	  (  )  
*DOR:	Right, you know the twos, threes and fours and fives tables? 
*MAR:	Twos no, no 
*DOR:	Oh dear 
*MAR:	I can't do them, I've learnt them 
*DOR:	sixes onwards I'll show you how dyslexic to do it with their hands  ((laugh))  
*ROS:	 ((laugh)) I've got my sheet of paper  ((laugh))  
*DOR:	 You don't need   
*GRO:	  (  )  
*ROS:	 One two   
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	Ooh somehow. 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	We learnt them by chart. 
*ROS:	Yeah I did that at  school we had to stay in most break times as a child cos I couldn't remember, and I, I know that my mum bought me a books so I used to sit for days and days, then my mum going over and then my nan going over and I couldn't remember if I wanted to   
*DOR:	 The number you have put them together in different places and as usual I got the numbers that fell of the   
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	couldn't sort out, so those things, bit confusing so 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	complicated when you start it out, but if you can't remember for the life of you then, it's quite 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	Yeah I have to do it, you know, four, fours, five, fives erm providing I remember those middles then I can carry on, anything  over   
*DOR:	 I know   
*MAR:	you know, say seven, sevens I know are forty nine 
*ROS:	Mm 
*MAR:	so that eight sevens are fifty six and I carry on from there, but you can't do that   
*ROS:	 you've got to have  something like 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	well I, I 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	I can't do it, yeah I can't do it 
*DOR:	And are there things like that then, tables?  Or is it more complicated? Yeah I was gonna say   
*MAR:	 No, they're much more complicated, if you get an equation  what's X 
*DOR:	Right 
*MAR:	and you've gotta find, you've gotta know  what happens   
*AND:	 I'll take Wednesday   
*DOR:	Yeah 
*MAR:	and like they give you a secret number of what comes next 
*DOR:	Yeah 
*AND:	I could never do those of, I never got one of those right. 
*DOR:	I would hate to do that orally I could only do that with 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	I think 
*MAR:	Yeah 
*ROS:	You can write it down, by the time you've written it down and thought about it 
*DOR:	Should of had the answer 
*ROS:	yeah, I find that, that I've done it and I've written down the answer and then I can't think which number does it go to, and by the time I've got to number one they're on about six, so I might as well, I'm lost it completely, so I can't do that either and my project work, course work, goes towards certain percent of my marks and I can't think for the life of me why 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	cos I don't want 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	you get one percent on explaining how you do it 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	so that's that, I can't rely on my course work for my marks so that's 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	I can't do it, so that I've got to get full marks for the exam to pass, without the other two bits on it, I can't do that 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Why is the project work so 
*AND:	You don't have to have English? 
*ROS:	No, cos I'm old 
*AND:	Brilliant cos I 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	pass mark, I've done the work and I've 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	We've all stood teaching, I've got maths I haven't got English. 
*MAR:	This is, is this O level? 
*ROS:	A level English, Language and Literature I'm doing which isn't really 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	but I might not pass, I haven't got the time and difficult when I'm working I can't 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	if I start and it starts getting boring 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	motivation is 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*AND:	I can do an essay to prove I can 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	It's all too much for me 
*DOR:	That can go next 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	Yeah 
*DOR:	They're nice 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	these two, really nice, I like this one 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	exactly that's what I was thinking  ((laugh))  
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	you could come on our weekend if you're not going 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	if you're not going to 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	cos they're going all weekend 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	Did he tell you? 
*DOR:	He said, he was hoping to go and work there, so 
*ROS:	And what did he say, three months? 
*DOR:	For a year and that's all I need 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	this is what he would liked to do 
*ROS:	Too frightened to ask him now 
*MAR:	No we don't about it 
*ROS:	oh 
*MAR:	because he told me 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Oh I think we will, well it's 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	yeah after a year, yeah 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	Unless he can get a work  permit   
*DOR:	 been  before he said, yeah, and come back   
*MAR:	 They don't always  come back, they don't always use the 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	 the main thing being   
*ROS:	 I know if going for at least  
*MAR:	luckily 
*GRO:	 (  )  (.) 
*DOR:	Anyway, unfortunately  he was gonna go in   
*MAR:	 I wasn't

*ROS:	got the keys out, pressed the alarm, hello  ((laugh)) , I'm quite impressed, cos my car's a scrap heap 
*DOR:	And why is your car a scrap heap? 
*ROS:	cos I haven't got any money to do it up, nineteen sixty 
*GRO:	 (  ) 
*ROS:	no 
*GRO:	 (  )  (  ) 
*ROS:	really, you see I was hoping that I was going anyway to

*ROS:	and they were black 
*DOR:	obvious 
*ROS:	 this thick
