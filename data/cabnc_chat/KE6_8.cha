@Comment:	conversation #8 (Tape 036501)
*WEN:	Over at Basingstoke and I had a look in the shoe shops, and that, they would be very handy for me erm lace up though
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	but these were are all crumped and I don't want clumsy ones   (.) cos you feel as though you've got Doctor Marten's or something on you know
*BEV:	But they're not comfortable after a while 
*WEN:	and they look it though, they look it, that you know, they really do
*BEV:	All fuddy duddy
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah and they're sort of grey, I'm not sure if she got them in a charity, I'm certainly sure it wasn't bought in a shoe shop, cos she goes round every charity, she won't go in, you know I told you about that, oh I don't know what it is, she said it's loaded out with stuff and we'll have to have a walk round there, erm, round by what was Kennedy's, erm
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	by the bingo hall
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	that was a fruit shop she said it's loaded out as a cheap shop she said and erm, she won't go in there because bloke's stood in there, she said she don't mind going in and paying fifty, because, well they don't do that do they?
*BEV:	No
*WEN:	you know, so erm
*BEV:	Yeah, but he's only watching the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	well he's probably got nowhere else to go, I mean it's 
*BEV:	No 
*WEN:	just aged off innit, there must be an out place, but you wouldn't er
*BEV:	I wouldn't leave them
*WEN:	No you wouldn't leave it, but she said it's a cheap shop so, but she said there's loads
*BEV:	but I've got to go to job spot one time 
*WEN:	Yeah 
*BEV:	so when we walk round
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah that's right, but I mean just go and have a look, and I actually said to her well you'd be better with somebody else, you know, not going in there on your own
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	and erm, you know, she, she obviously needs somebody else with her to make it not so obvious for her
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	not
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	but I think that, that with what it is you know, but then I say she's got that anyway, she's not as, as tough as what she makes out, but er it would be worth having a look you never know what's in there, and I say I must pick up a couple of paper towels
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	I'm not, I'm not gonna pay any more than that
*BEV:	There's no point in it.
*WEN:	No, oh I know what I never got that ain't finished I'll have to go down the shops, I might go down
*BEV:	What?
*WEN:	I didn't get that baby card did I?
*BEV:	You don't know whether
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	I looked
*BEV:	No
*WEN:	I di last night when I was up there and he said to me what was that noise, I went through all the piles and I had a quick look in the bureau but, I didn't find that, I don't know what I've done with that
*BEV:	I know there was a baby one, you know that, erm   (.) pile with all different cards
*WEN:	And there was a baby one in there?
*BEV:	I'm sure there was, I'll go and have a look
*WEN:	There was get wells and driving test, oh have a look because I mean 
*BEV:	I'm sure there's one there
*WEN:	it was, it was particularly, it, it totally for a girl
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	because I said it was erm Simon's, and then I didn't know really where they lived and erm, I know they moved out, out of next door to Lesley's, and in the end it never got done that, that more to the point   (.) but erm I can't do that up until I've done that can I?Well I can't do that up until the coat's ready anyway
*BEV:	Oh yeah
*WEN:	but erm that 
*BEV:	what shall we do with that then?
*WEN:	Oh I don't know I mean it's gonna go through there, well I suppose I'm sure I can get some round the neck
*BEV:	It won't fit round the neck
*WEN:	Got to fix it then haven't you?You'll want somewhere where you can either have it hanging 
*BEV:	Well no what did I do with that one for   (.) erm Ian and Diane?
*WEN:	might get it through the bottom, that'll be simpler won't it? (.) I don't know what's gonna be simplest?
*BEV:	When I did that one for Ian, we just tied it in at the back didn't we?
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	And had that
*WEN:	well let it dry off for a minute, well they must have a card, good job I thought about that   (.) I should be interested to see what she calls her because I think Annalise is a beautiful name
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	and you don't hear it much here do you?
*BEV:	No, well, it's like Nina's name, I can't remember it, Anastasia or something like that
*WEN:	Yeah, and shorten it to Nina
*BEV:	Yeah, how they got Nina out of it, it is something like Anastasia, but it's
*WEN:	Well Nina must be in there somewhere so
*BEV:	Well I believe er, her sisters used to call her Neen
*WEN:	Anasteen, Anasleen, Anasleen 
*BEV:	some something like that and they used to call her Neen
*WEN:	Oh
*BEV:	and she said I don't like that call me Nina
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	and it stuck at 
*WEN:	Oh well they've added the A on then 
*BEV:	Yeah 
*WEN:	obviously
*BEV:	Mm, nobody calls her, whatever it is
*WEN:	No
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	well they all call Annalise that
*BEV:	Annalise
*WEN:	Annalise, I've never heard anybody out there call her Anna or Lisa, or Lise or anything, always Annalise, it's such a pretty name
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	ain't it?
*BEV:	It's funny you know, if you give them a long name
*WEN:	Yeah they don't shorten it
*BEV:	they get very shortened
*WEN:	but their, the name of their new house is Dew Drops
*BEV:	Is it?
*WEN:	It's very nice
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	innit?
*BEV:	Well it's the oldy-worldy
*WEN:	Yeah, certainly is, I think that's super
*BEV:	but I don't know why Hayley and Ian are called theirs Jack?
*WEN:	So did Susan, Susan called theirs Jack, that little boy
*BEV:	Oh yes, but er
*WEN:	Well Jack were then, they, they put these, in the paper periodically they put 
*BEV:	Well the girl was gonna be Layla
*WEN:	What erm
*BEV:	if they had a girl it was Layla
*WEN:	What Hayley?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Mm quite nice that, I don't mind that
*BEV:	Fleetwood Mac song
*WEN:	Oh is it?
*BEV:	Mm
*WEN:	Oh I didn't know that, but erm, no in the paper periodically 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	went mad on it, on Fleetwood Mac
*WEN:	Oh, but when Prince Andrew was born that caught on
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	you know X years ago, but this is what they do
*BEV:	and Eugene
*WEN:	er, well
*BEV:	I haven't heard any Eugenes
*WEN:	No, that was picked out the history book
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	would of picked that, they had a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	book here didn't they?I should of gone through the book to find that, put some money on it   (.) because if she had Victoria as well, I thought about Victoria and er of course I didn't know about Eugene I don't read, but it's in the book
*BEV:	Is it?
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	I 
*WEN:	oh yeah 
*BEV:	If there are any
*WEN:	Don't know what it'll be do you?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	no, I don't think they'll have any more now
*WEN:	No I don't think they will but you can't really believe all that you read in a newspaper can you?
*BEV:	No, but they don't seem a happy couple at the moment do they?
*WEN:	Well it's the impression you get innit?
*BEV:	Yeah, but there again the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	wouldn't give out or let that out
*WEN:	No
*BEV:	if there weren't a certain amount of truth
*WEN:	Oh it's got all
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	something totally out
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	oh yeah
*WEN:	Though he's got all those people up there again, Amy  Karen er not Karen er Caroline
*BEV:	Caroline
*WEN:	and er Peter  (.) 
*BEV:	Oh you know that erm   (.) course that   (.) erm cookery
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	for German
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	well there's a holiday one, it's   (.) a holiday 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	one at, at
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah, well what is that then?
*BEV:	Ten weeks but that would probably only be sort of erm
*WEN:	A German holiday?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Oh what like erm a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	yeah
*WEN:	That's quite interesting then and you don't know when that one starts?
*BEV:	Well it's starting earlier than that, but I wonder whether to leave it until   (.) because I might already know most of
*WEN:	Yeah, oh you do know certain, a certain amount don't you?
*BEV:	Just got to get to get the sentences, oh I know quite a few words  (.) 
*WEN:	Yeah I mean we can get by over there can't you?
*BEV:	Yeah, I think I'll wait until September and
*WEN:	Well you won't wait until that long you'll put it down in May 
*BEV:	May 
*WEN:	won't it?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	So don't forget that, I think that's more comprehensive and that was a Monday night wasn't it?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	So even with swimming
*BEV:	Oh I won't pack up at my swimming
*WEN:	No, oh no
*BEV:	No, what I think I'll do swimming-wise is go down to seven fifteen
*WEN:	Yeah, do you wanna go Monday dinner time, if you're not, you're not
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	wouldn't phone you on Monday, she may, but she isn't supposed to

*WEN:	I'm working but it's half past twelve innit?
*BEV:	That's right, yeah, I don't mind
*WEN:	Well let's, let's, let's say we'll try
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	and see what the weather's like and you name it, I mean we know now
*BEV:	Well let me just check me diary, I know
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	no, but we now know that, if it, if I've got the right time, half past twelve's fine
*BEV:	Yeah

*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	I mean it'll stop you
*BEV:	Oh it'll stop me
*WEN:	what's name, but that don't matter because although
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	he said to me part time er, but of course he didn't know, erm they might, might want somebody part time, but erm, I mean that's gotta be at least even if it's three pounds an hour
*BEV:	Oh I'm not thinking about it
*WEN:	Well you're not bothered about that anyway
*BEV:	I'm not even bothered to think about it 
*WEN:	I mean eight hours a day, it's gotta be over the hundred 
*BEV:	Er nine thirty to five thirty so I won't get in till  (.) 
*WEN:	What?
*BEV:	I won't get in till I don't know when
*WEN:	What?
*BEV:	get on the bus and that
*WEN:	In the morning?

*BEV:	past five 
*WEN:	is fine
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	no it doesn't, that's no problem
*BEV:	well really it's not that much further forward 
*WEN:	it's only down the road innit?I say no, that, that ain't the problem
*BEV:	Hopefully if I do get it, there's somebody there, that's going from Andover
*WEN:	Well that's what I said, you don't know do you?
*BEV:	No
*WEN:	Or somebody in the next place or the next place, we reckon we know where it is
*BEV:	Do you?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	no Woolworth's
*BEV:	Woolworth's
*WEN:	Have you never been out there?
*BEV:	No
*WEN:	No, well it's the big paved erm way 
*BEV:	Long way?
*WEN:	Oh yeah, there's, mind you
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	but what's out there is load of erm unit factories, unit places and 
*BEV:	Well it'd have to be somewhere
*WEN:	Yeah similar to my place up there
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	er but a bigger area and they're like big warehouses, big, well like the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	yeah
*WEN:	and erm, he's got in the, in the fabric one he's got double doors and all the rolls of carpet and erm, he's got a table in there and obviously to make a cup of tea, got a couple of beds in there cos he's sold them and it's like a big warehouse and erm   (.) all around there there's a big concreted area, you know, and er all these units and that's where we, we reckon it is.I mean there's a lot there, there's a lot of
*BEV:	Places
*WEN:	places   (.) yeah   (.) no, no the evening one would be a doddle   (.) Anyway we'll wait and see, might not occur.I mean if then, if you did then the, the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	are out
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	but then, providing we go on the Tuesdays you can still go German on the Mondays, anyway couldn't you?
*BEV:	Yeah
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	well for all that time 
*WEN:	if you have that 
*BEV:	I won't
*WEN:	probably won't be there
*BEV:	they won't be there
*WEN:	No that's right, no
*BEV:	but thirteen weeks
*WEN:	Yeah, well that's norm isn't it?
*BEV:	I don't know
*WEN:	Yeah, well when I, when I was up RAF Andover
*BEV:	I had a feeling that it's six weeks
*WEN:	Oh I, how awful for thirteen weeks, with me, I know she did when she had Ian went back
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	I know she did, but anyway doesn't matter whatever it is.
*BEV:	Well then I'd have to stop the Income Support 
*WEN:	Oh yeah , oh yeah you most probably end up with
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	so you couldn't do that, you'd have to tell them that, and say well I've got to start my
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	because I'm involved with the
*BEV:	I'll have a temporary job
*WEN:	Ah?
*BEV:	I'll have a temporary job
*WEN:	Yeah, oh no you'll have to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	things like that  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	we get on quite well
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	you know
*BEV:	Yeah, we seem to get held up everywhere we go
*WEN:	Yeah we did
*BEV:	I couldn't believe it when
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	no, never mind   (.) ha, my brother went into the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	if I buy them too big then they're, all
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	on the floor
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	you know, they're just too long
*BEV:	Oh I'll try a pair of yours on
*WEN:	Yeah, but they're stretchies that's what's so nice about them
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	and the material is, you feel the stretch, the others are like this and they just sit there, but then in the end they ride up you see
*BEV:	They bag
*WEN:	Oh they bag something terrible but then I say at the price I'm not gonna buy them, I'm not, but in the Dodger's there's not one small in any colour 
*BEV:	No 
*WEN:	well then if I go onto a medium, then you're getting all this length and all this business here, all that business and it's too much, if I could of found a four I'd certainly tried it on for swimming you know, [yawning] but I don't want it all baggy and horrible   [] you know
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	and I do like that sewing stripe down the middle
*BEV:	Yes
*WEN:	because it always looks smarter than, like this   (.) just plain
*BEV:	Like a pin stripe sort of thing
*WEN:	Well it's just like
*BEV:	isn't it?
*WEN:	a crease
*BEV:	Mm
*WEN:	when you iron in a crease it's, it's just like that ain't it? (.) I
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	I don't know
*BEV:	A bit dodgy
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	yeah
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*WEN:	You put that corned beef in the fridge didn't you?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Do you want some salad cream for now?
*BEV:	I think there's enough
*WEN:	Oh cos I'm going down the shop
*BEV:	I wouldn't bother
*WEN:	No, I'll do it tomorrow then   (.) do something different for dinner tomorrow, well you can either try some, oh I've got another here, we could try
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	eh?
*WEN:	Sandra does it, but I mean I wouldn't bother with
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	all that
*BEV:	Oh no  (.) 
*WEN:	 ((laugh))  (.) They certainly do bring the old repeats back don't they?
*BEV:	Mm
*WEN:	I mean they're not bad little programmes, but quite seriously you
*BEV:	We've seen them
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	though
*WEN:	once you've seen them   (.) If I put one of those skirts on, the navy I think, and if I get any marks on it
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	well no, I'm only wearing me bloody coat and the skirt and er grey tights that's all, er whatever up top   (.) I mean I hope that, have a look, I hope it's gonna be a better bus anyway this week  (.) 
*BEV:	Make sure that hip's on the side then
*WEN:	I've already got one, I'm not bothered about that, I mean for kids I think, I think it's a good idea because well then they don't lay on it
*BEV:	Oh I've done that for many a year
*WEN:	Yeah, oh it is neater I agree with that, I just want to get on with it now
*BEV:	You're not happy with it are you?
*WEN:	I am happy with it, I've just lost interest
*BEV:	Oh
*WEN:	No I, I want it certainly   (.) oh you must get hungry in a minute surely   (.) we must try that freeze dry too
*BEV:	Yeah freeze dry too
*WEN:	How many cups was in there?
*BEV:	Six
*WEN:	Mm, it's incredible really
*BEV:	Mm  (.) 
*WEN:	It'll be nice if you could summon up people like that on the phone won't it?
*BEV:	Oh yeah  (.) 
*WEN:	 [yawning] oh dear   [] god I've got to work at Albridge tonight
*BEV:	Go to sleep on the bus
*WEN:	Well yeah but it takes longer on the bus, but er
*BEV:	But if you're tired you can go to sleep anywhere
*WEN:	Oh you do   (.) I hope Tommy's got that photo of her now
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	when did he post it?Or did I post it?He posted it didn't he?
*BEV:	He post it
*WEN:	That'll be last Saturday then won't it, that's a week then won't it?I'm sure she's on the move, for it, you know
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	I mean it came out well I thought, it came out very well, considering it was, you know, different process, and it certainly does the job and I still haven't got my damn postcards have I?
*BEV:	No
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	yeah I would, I've got to write to Dot tomorrow
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah
*BEV:	cos I think it's only fair
*WEN:	I've got that card, I think it's in there  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	oh no, well I mean, I think you've got to do it properly, I don't think you should do it on the caravan because A you're gonna get the reception, B you're gonna have to make an appointment and it, in a letter
*BEV:	I'll probably have to see them anyway
*WEN:	Sorry?
*BEV:	I'll probably have to go up to them 
*WEN:	Well you probably shall well that's, well that's their choice then not yours
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	but the whole point is you can put down every detail in a letter for them to read, to put on file, can't you?No I think you should do it, do it that way round  (.) 
*BEV:	Well I'll pop up there first then
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	even if I'm not
*WEN:	I'll give them a ring tomorrow
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	and erm   (.) I mean really it's a bit difficult actually because er you don't know about that
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*BEV:	Why?
*WEN:	Well you don't know whether you'll be able, you can go down in an evening
*BEV:	No I'll just say I'll pop down some time
*WEN:	She might of had hers by now mightn't she?
*BEV:	Yeah, whoops big
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	oh big foot  (.) 
*WEN:	Well she might be that little bit further on let's face it I mean
*BEV:	Yeah, I could  (.) 
*WEN:	 ((laugh))  (.) Well otherwise you might be you know, a little bit further, but
*BEV:	I wonder whether how long it's gonna take Martin to fit that gear if Martin can do it 
*WEN:	Well I want, now I want yeah well I understand but I wonder how long since they will leave it   (.) she's already looked for an answ , you know she doesn't get an answer, that's the point, I should think by now he'd
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	I can't see, I mean, of course I mean she can take him to court over the money
*BEV:	Mm
*WEN:	if he disagrees or don't do anything, but I can't see how he can't leave it, can be without it, has to know  (.) 
*BEV:	Oh I'd
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah, but not from her point of view I mean, not from her point of view she'll, she'll surely just go ahead  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	they are a damn nuisance
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	well we ain't had lots and lots
*WEN:	Well since Helen went we've had no luck at all with neighbours, I think they're
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	disgusting   (.) but then they're not the sort of people you can talk to are they?
*BEV:	No   (.) is there a girl up this road called Rachel?
*WEN:	Not that I know of, well I mean I don't know
*BEV:	Two er, two kiddies, er there's that, that one then, it's gotta be
*WEN:	What one?
*BEV:	Sandra
