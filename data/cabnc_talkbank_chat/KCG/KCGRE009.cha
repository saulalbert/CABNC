*PS19V:	Yeah .  303875_303995
*PS19L:	yeah the only thing about having those others of course you can see through the windows but there 's not a lot you can do about that John had a word with the bloke across the back there .  303995_331495
*PS19V:	Oh did he .  332065_332595
*PS19L:	about you know the garage .  332935_333745
*PS19V:	Yeah .  334075_334355
*PS19L:	So he said he 'd got no objections to John moving it back .  334355_337345
*PS19V:	Oh well mm .  337385_337805
*PS19L:	we 'll probably end up doing a bit to the garden this year as opposed to er you know going to we were gon na go down to Somerset in June were n't we .  337805_348625
*PS19V:	Mm .  348625_348685
*PS19L:	But that with things as they are we might as well just hang fire .  348765_353395
*PS19V:	Well it 's no use spending money you have n't got is it .  355325_358265
*PS19L:	No well the thing is I mean you 're talking of five or six hundred pounds .  358265_362155
*PS19V:	This is it .  362315_362675
*PS19L:	and if you ca n't replace it I mean we 've booked we 've booked through erm Au August anyway we 're definitely going in August to Southport .  362675_369955
*PS19V:	and it might be a little bit cheaper for yourself than going all that way it certainly wo n't it certainly wo n't cost you as much to get there anyway .  372785_379205
*PS19L:	No well that 's it int it so er if things are reasonable we might just go away for a long weekend or something go find us a place in Southport for a weekend .  379205_401135
*PS19V:	Yeah .  401135_401305
*PS19L:	but really I mean you need the odd week at home do n't you really to sort of do bits to it you ca n't work and do it .  408805_414355
*PS19V:	Well I mean I 'm not going away this year but it 's not really bothered me an awful lot .  414385_417675
*PS19L:	No no .  420905_422985

*PS19V:	Yeah .  442165_442225
*PS19L:	I think it 's a good time to spend in the garden to be honest I mean you ca n't you ca n't it 's not really long enough to try and do it at weekends not if he wants to move that garage back it 'll probably take the best part of the week to sort that out .  442225_455685
*PS19V:	Oh it will yeah cos you 've got to empty it and .  455685_457595
