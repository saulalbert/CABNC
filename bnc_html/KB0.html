               [753]  ... Er, to talk about what   ... you think about the ministry   ... of the church as well.<br>
               [754]  ... We're talking about this   ... partly because of the document passed in the ministry in which, everybody has avidly read   ... and erm   ... has been   [...] talked about after the seventeenth   ... er, in York   ... in July.<br>
               [755]  ... But I think the more important reason for talking about   ... the Ministry of the New Church, or the Ministry of the Church   ... is because of the   ... erm   ... developing needs and the   ... developing thoughts and ideas which are actually   [...] additions   ... which are the, the crucial area   ... where ministry takes place.<br>
               [756]  ... First of all, I think it would be useful if we were clear   ... that with the new  [...] , ministry was a waste!<br>
               [757]  ... Too often, we are limited in thinking of ministry as those who   ... either do or do not work where   [...] are thought of.<br>
               [758]  ... And, we might call those Ministers, if you like, with a big M.<br>
               [759]  ... Erm   ... but we'll be talking about the Ministry of the Church.<br>
               [760]  ... We're actually talking about, I mean, if you remember this  [...] , we're talking about   ... the absinity   ... of the body of Christ.<br>
               [761]  ... That is the Ministry of the Church.<br>
               [762]  ... But each one that's here   ... however old or however young   ... are a part   ... an active part   ... an essential part   ... a crucial part   ... of the Ministry of the Body of Christ.<br>
               [763]  ... We are these.<br>
               [764]  ... And how we relate   ... within the church   ... and how we relate outside the church   ... although, in essence, there is nothing outside the church   ... there is nothing that that position  [...] .<br>
               [765]  ... Okay?<br>
               [766]  ... As you look into your shaving mirror in the morning, you shall say, hello Minister, how are you?<br>
               [767]  ... Or as you look into your drawer in the morning, to find out what you need   ... to put into your hand bag in the day, you say hello Minister, how are you?<br>
               [768]  ... Okay?<br>
               [769]  ... That's  [...] .<br>
               [770]  ... We're also talking in terms of a ministry   ... which   ... what you expect   ... is very often what you get   ... you're trained to be somebody  [...] , okay?.<br>
               [771]  ... And one of the things that these trainings help you    [...]  ... is that if you expect something of a child   ... then you're much more likely to get it!<br>
               [772]  ... That way it's positive.<br>
               [773]  ... If you expect that child is going to   ... do a fantastic job   ... on that painting   ... then that encouragement and confidence is coming across.<br>
               [774]  ... It also works negatively!<br>
               [775]  ... If you don't expect much from little Tommy   ... then, little Tommy is less and less likely to give you anything much!<br>
               [776]  ... So we're talking about ministry.<br>
               [777] We're talking about something which is bound by our expectations.<br>
               [778]  ... We need to be aware of our expectations   ... because our expectations can be   ... limiting   ... and can be stretching and   ... inspiring.<br>
               [779]  ... We also are exercising the Ministry of the Church   ... within a context.<br>
               [780]  ... We've learnt something about the church and  [...] .<br>
               [781]  ... One of the contexts in which we are exercising ministry is that we have   ... for the last fifty years   ... well I haven't personally!<br>
               [782]  ... But for the last fifty years or so   ... for most of us   ... the experience of the church   ... has been declined   ... and   ... closer   ... and   ... reducing number of people with dog collars.<br>
               [783]  ... Okay?<br>
               [784] There have been negative interference.<br>
               [785]  ... We need to be aware   ... of how those can actually triple the numbers.<br>
               [786]  ... We need to be aware of how   ... we are   ... subconsciously   ... taught.<br>
               [787]  ... A Geographer   ... knows that   ... and   ... the whole environment importance.<br>

               [790]  ... Half of our exercise in listening to each other is to know where we are.<br>
               [791]  ... In order that we can begin to recognise   ... the movements and the visions and the views   ... of where we can be.<br>

               [840] In preparing ours for today   ... and   ... the whole question of thinking of being, main precedency of communion rests in our understanding erm, of ordination, which I know   ... later we   ... we will have time to discuss.<br>
               [841]  ... But, may I ask yo , of you a question   ... not for answers but will   ... erm   ... perhaps come later in the debate   ... and that is what does the   ... service of Holy Communion mean   ... to you?<br>
               [842]  ... Our answers   ... will get crushed.<br>
               [843]  ... But one thing that I would share with you   ... and it's this, is that   ... whenever the   ... friends of Jesus eat and drink together   ... they remember him   ... his sacrificial love for them   ... and the wonderful gift of freedom that he has made possible.<br>
               [844]  ... I'll say at the outset, that Holy Communion is not something that we play about with.<br>
               [845]  ... Our communion service is part of the rich tradition which has been passed down to us   ... from Jesus Christ.<br>
               [846]  ... But having sa said that   ... I have to share with you the   ... a key element er, in the life of the church has been the ordained Ministry of Word and Sacrament   ... and pastoral care.<br>
               [847] And there is no intention to dispense with this kind of service.<br>
               [848] But concern is expressed   ... in the number of jobs that the perfect minister is expected to do.<br>
               [849] I stand here, I am not a perfect minister because I am over forty   ... I've got   ... children that are not too awkward but   ... erm, could be awkward   ... and, I haven't a spouse   ... ah   ... and ah   ... I stand here saying that I'm not good at everything   ... I'm good with young people, I'm not o only good with old people   ... I try to do my best.<br>
               [850] We know the picture of a perfect minister   ... but   ... we   ... there is a challenge   ... to relief ministers   ... to do the work that they are called to do.<br>
               [851]  ... This will lead to   ... a long deba  ... debate.<br>
               [852]  ... But, it is   ... it seems from this report that   ... is in front of us   ... that it is now appropriate for the URC   ... to take a new step with regard to the local ministry of elders.<br>
               [853] Already this morning the question has been asked about providing elders.<br>
               [854]  ... And it is that   ... each local church, of whatever sign   ... should be invited to nominate from amongst their elder division   ... those elders who district council   ... might consider and recognise as dividing elders   ... for a stated period of years   ... with authority to do , provide them all services of worship and meetings of that local church, as the need arises.<br>
               [855]  ... And this has been suggested, the same thing, the understanding that we have now of special authorization   ... which obviously doesn't work.<br>
               [856]  ... The reasons for looking at this change and, I quote the reports   ... the   ... the ways the district council interpret the existing clause   ... about provi , [...] precedency   ... is the district council   ... ah, interpret in very different ways.<br>
               [857]  ... A second thing is that   ... a co , is it right that a company of people   ... should be deprived of a sacrament   ... because an ordained minister is not available?<br>
               [858]  ... Remembering the words of Jesus, that where two or three are gathered together.<br>
               [859]  ... The third thing that the re , the report says is that there is no magical element about sacraments.<br>
               [860]  ... But   ... sacrament has everything to do with the grace of God   ... and the faith of the church.<br>
               [861]  ... And this proposal is seen, lastly, as developing   ... local leadership.<br>
               [862]  ... The proposal is that presiding elders   ... and whether proposal is the right word, but the suggestion that presiding elders   ... be   ... appointed following our conviction   ... that every local church   ... should have regular sacramental worship   ... with presiding   ... with people   ... presiding   ... being allowed.<br>
               [863]  ... Can I close by saying that every time Christians share the Lord's supper   ... they are publicly declaring their needs to be fed with the living bread and wine.<br>

               [956]  ... Patterns of Ministry   ... to my mind   ... can be interpreted as   ... patterns of sharing   ... and partnership is active and not fussy.<br>

               [958]  ... Partnership is   ... dynamic   ... and not  [...] .<br>
               [959]  ... And then   ... learning together   ... is a model   ... of dynamic   ... encounter   ... or dialogue, one with the other.<br>
               [960]  ... And by that, I mean   ... that we engage one another in a process.<br>

               [962]  ... And that implies that   ... our learning together   ... engages us in   ... dynamic encounter   ... dynamic dialogue   ... which also releases   ... some of those energies in various areas of life   ... that would otherwise be sealed   ... or indeed, locked!<br>
               [963]  ... And I were to guess that   ... learning together is also   ... a model of   ... rich   ... and diverse possibilities.<br>

               [1061]  ... We tried the process.<br>
               [1062]  ... We selected a single project to just   ... learn   ... how to do it   ... just go through the process simply.<br>
               [1063]  ... It took about nine months of planning from start to finish   ... on the one project we did.<br>
               [1064]  ...  [...]  ... We had a programme on four consecutive Saturdays, last October   ... help reach the  [...] .<br>
               [1065]  ... At, not a significant cost.<br>

               [1070]  ... We have learnt at getting   ... a number of people   ... into our congregation.<br>
               [1071]  ... So that was our first success when we decided   [...] that process.<br>
               [1072]  ... Forward planning   ... and setting objectives   ... were a good way to focus attention.<br>
               [1073]  ... So, we set objectives   ... and sub , subsequently   ... planned a budget   ... to ensure   ... that it's successful.<br>
               [1074]  ... So what's the timetable?<br>
               [1075]  ... Well I'll take you back six months.<br>
               [1076]  ... The elders were advised in advance that we were going to discuss   ... the future, [...] .<br>
               [1077]  ... This enabled the eldership to start thinking about   ... what we want to do next year   ... to grow together.<br>
               [1078]  ... So, in the next elders meeting   ... we used a management technique, brainstormers   ... think the   ... say what you think.<br>
               [1079]  ... And   ... we gathered all this information   ... we grouped it into those categories, admission, worship, [...]  ... and such like.<br>
               [1080]  ... Then later, couple of months later when we found that list   ... checked that we understood what the list meant   ... and we presented that list   ... to our church meeting.<br>
               [1081]  ... This will ensure that there's commitment   ... and that the direction is understood   ... for the next year.<br>
               [1082]  ... So, in that presentation discussions followed   ... and that list of nine things, I think it was, surprise surprise the church wanted to do all nine!<br>
               [1083]  ... Now there's a challenge!<br>
               [1084]  ... So what we did then, is we went   ... to do, to do fact-finding, costs, people resources, effort   ... and any options that might be open to us.<br>
               [1085]  ... And   ... the culmination of the production of some financial information that simply enables you to ensure   ... that you can meet those goals   ... in that coming year   ... if you choose to do so.<br>
               [1086]  ... So at the Annual, Annual General Meeting   ... it was conducted i , very much in the same way as before   ... presenting the previous year's activities   ... but this time, we presented a budget!<br>
               [1087]  ... Very similar to the example that Bill  provided   ... in his hand outs.<br>
               [1088] We listed a  ... our expenditure   ... his forecast   ... we used the forecast based on experience and inflation.<br>
               [1089] Some of them are at best guesses!<br>
               [1090]  ... But then you foil a new project to your expenditure and say look   ... if you want to do these   ... as indeed, you've expressed   ... then it's going to cost you so much.<br>
               [1091]  ... If you get that agreement there   ... one hopes you get that commitment.<br>
               [1092]  ... On a technicality the bu , the treasurer can still control it.<br>
               [1093]  ... He can measure every clause of what the income is  [...] , against what the expenditure is   ... so that we have some control   ... to ensure   ... that the church life grows   ... and we don't stumble.<br>
               [1094]  ... So, we have true growth.<br>

               [1606] Oh, after all that it didn't work!<br>
               [1607]  ... It's at this point in our agenda when er   ... the world search   ... it's   ... our agenda   ... and er   ... in introducing the report there are just four things I want to comment about.<br>
               [1608]  ... Er, I refer, first of all to   ... the continuing links we have with the church in Hungary   ... and to remind that there is a, a party of young who are currently negotiating the   ... er, visit to Hungary at this present time.<br>
               [1609]  ... And er, we would hope that that programme of reciprocal visits will continue over the ensuing years.<br>
               [1610]  ... We also find there are, and I hope that you will read it carefully, because I think you will find it   ... a fairly daunting report   ... which comes from Hugh    ... who has managed, you know, has been working, erm, in   ... er, Romania   ... with the Bishop   ... erm, who more or less, kind of, started off the, or whose work started off the   ... the revolution that took place in Romania.<br>
               [1611]  ... Within that report he tells us   ... erm, the rather startling disturbance story, that in fact   ... it almost suggests, has been suggested the revolution hasn't happened because the situation   ... has continued as before with a different name   ... but basically with the same   ... er   ... with the same kind of programme intact.<br>
               [1612]  ... And in the creation of unity, unity   [...] there's deep concern about the status of American churches in Romania   ... and obviously the Hungarian church   ... in Romania is affected by that whole process so I would urge you to read that letter   ... to remember the work of Hugh erm   ... and to   ... be aware of, of what   ... the situation is   ... in that part of the world.<br>
               [1613] It seems important that I should have links, in developing links   ... you ought to see that as part of our agenda.<br>
               [1614]  ... Hugh, himself   ... I think he is completing his work   ... and there, in, in a few months time   ... and I know there have attempts made to find someone to replace him.<br>
               [1615] As yet er, that has not been possible, but if you knew of anybody, young person who you thought might be suitable   ... and might   ... mi , might like the challenge of an interesting venture of this nature   ... I'm sure if you let us know, or let the moderator know   ... we'll be very happy to, er, suggest that name or see if there's any, any possibility   ... erm, in continuing that  [...] .<br>
               [1616]  ... We also feel it's important that we should   ... be doing just a bit more than just having exchanges, that there is a whole process of   [...] that needs to go on.<br>
               [1617] There's an assumption   ... by some politicians that just because there is this   ... immense change taking place in Eastern Europe, that this is victory for Western capitalism   ... erm, I think there might be some of who might be a bit cautious about that victory and might believe that er   ... there is still much that needs to be shared and understood   ... and it isn't as simple as perhaps some political figures might suggest it could be.<br>
               [1618]  ... So I want to, first of all, in presenting this report to remind you of the importance of that link   ... and for us to encourage its development.<br>
               [1619]  ... Secondly, the World Church erm   ... is your agenda in the sense that   ... you might be interested to know there is a   ... erm   ... a video now available, er   ... which introduces the work of CWM for the churches.<br>
               [1620]  ... And that video can be obtained from Tavistock Church, in Tavistock Place   ... it costs twelve pound fifty, with one pound fifty postage   ... erm, but I think that it has been recommended to us and a number of the provinces have asked for copies to be made available   ... and then maybe there are some churches within our provence that might like to have that video so that they can draw the attention of their churches to the work   ... of the Council for World Mission.<br>
               [1621]  ... Thirdly, we will in a moment be hearing a report   ... erm, about the   ... World Council of Churches   ... assembly which took place in Canberra   ... so there is another aspect to the World Church hitting our agenda today.<br>
               [1622]  ... But fourth, and I think it was reflected very much in the discussions this morning   ... just to simply remind you that you are the World Church!<br>
               [1623] You know, we sometimes think of the World Church as being something that's out there beyond us, but we are the World Church aren't we?<br>
               [1624] We're   ... we are part of the that process and it's   ... it's sometimes encouraging for us to remember that there are   ... small denominations, small groups like us around the world   ... who are struggling to make their Christian witness real   ... in their particular context.<br>
               [1625]  ... And it's important that the kind of story that we're being told this morning, or to continue to be told, we are to continually hear and observing <br></td>

               [1720]  ... Then   ... there was the influence of the third world, or the two thirds world   ... the churches   ... the politics   ... and the cultures.<br>

               [1727]  ... But, for the original inhabitants of the lands the desert is the familiar place that provides nature   ... and gives meaning to life.<br>
               [1728]  ... It was natural, therefore, that the assembly should take up this kind of understanding.<br>
               [1729] It was not too late to realise that space should be given in the programme for a proper consideration of the perception of winning in relation to the whole team of the assembly.<br>
               [1730]  ... Winning space therefore   ... assumed a significant part of the assembly programme.<br>
               [1731]  ... Again, as I said, the Gulf war brought the peace question very much into the arena   ... and accordingly there was always the pressure for prece , reconsideration of the peace   ... under the general heading of peace space.<br>
               [1732]  ... And, can I suggest that we need to bring that very much into our discussions and into our prayers constantly in our churches.<br>
               [1733]  ... Significant that we have been challenged by our master to be peace   ... makers   ... how real is that in our churches?<br>
               [1734]  ... And   ... tomorrow will be the real test, won't it not?<br>
               [1735]  ... That we are really praying for peace and identifying ourselves with peace struggle in Ireland.<br>
               [1736]  ... Secondly, there was also the context of the Aborigines.<br>
               [1737] We were reminded of their plight at the opening service of the assembly.<br>
               [1738] One thing I forgot to bring with me this afternoon was a tape of the assembly worship   ... I'm sorry about that, but I don't think you've got a tape recorder have you?<br></td>

               [1765]  ...

               [1947] and are doing their best to do it.<br>
               [1948] So that's on the down side.<br>
               [1949] So   ... er, at the moment they're saying   ... all I can see   ... is that er, we would have to use up the whole of our balance, that's sixteen thousand   ... and the twenty four thousand arrears.<br>
               [1950] Now, that as the picture   ... er, leads me onto the next er, stage which is what in ministry, er what can we do in nineteen ninety three?<br>
               [1951] Erm   ... a letter was sent to all district secretaries, who I think in mo , most cases sent these round to churches to see if we could get some idea from you as to what sort of increase in contributions could be possible for nineteen ninety three.<br>
               [1952] That's quite difficult to do because where there's so many churches not being sure whether they're going to make it this year   ... how can they say what's going to happen next year?<br>
               [1953] On the other hand   ... er, if we did what our friend from Cheltenham is doing   ... we would have lo , we would be looking forward like that all the time   ... we would have some idea.<br>
               [1954] Now, I'm pleased to say we have had quite a number of   ... of er   ... replies from churches   ... on what they think they can d , do.<br>
               [1955] On the other hand, some of these er   ... are good   ... re positive replies and some of them, some are negative!<br>
               [1956] And, it seemed to me   ... that when I, as the er   ... your representative on Provincial Finance Committee is asked to make a co , commitment for this, for this    [...]  ... for   ... er   ... for nineteen ninety three I could say no better than what we had as out target this year and   ... that was hard!<br>
               [1957] Cos clearly we've only er   ... reached something like five hundred, three thousand, four thousand   ... er   ... then it's gonna be a   ... a big jump to get to the five hundred and forty!<br>
               [1958] Now, nobody er   ... er,a at this stage at the er   ... Financial Resources Committee er, challenge us on this figure, I think we will just   [...] stage of   ... of doing arith arithmetic of adding it up, but no doubt that the staff will be   ... comparing what going to be, er what within a   ... but have prepared   [...] for next year with what we're supposed to do this year   ... and ours is an increase of another percent.<br>
               [1959]  ... We look at all the other conferences, the lowest after that was the Northern Provence which is in a very similar position to ourselves   ... and they were offering a five percent increase.<br>
               [1960] Er, a few others were offering seven to nine   ... and most of the others were offering between ten and fifteen percent.<br>
               [1961] So we're way down on all the others! [...] so, that then falls three hundred thousand pound short   ... of what is required to   ... er, give ministers an increase to twelve thousand next year.<br>
               [1962] There seem to be   ... our two groups er, in one of our provinces   ... and they say that the rich and poor but the rich   ... er er are not so rich and others   ...  [...] .<br>
               [1963] That, in fact, er   ... there are three provinces who are already now contributing more than anyone else   ... that, they feel that the churches should go forward to try and raise the minister's   [...] to what was proposedly that the   ... assembly last year, they should be paid thirteen thousand two hundred   ... but in order to do that   ... see another six hundred thousand pound raised   ... and it is likely that this will be put as a challenge to the churches   ... at assembly.<br>
               [1964] Now   ... if I could just remind you of what's happened at the  Lyndford Haven  ... er   ... er, Synod, last March   ... erm, the Financial Committee have suggested that we should go for a target of five hundred and ten thousand   ... but   ... er, this is   ... we are not gonna be able to   ... even start looking at the eleven and a half thousand if if er   ... all the provinces do it for months and more   ... and we, I think very bravely or foolishly whatever way you li , look at it, proposed that we should got to five hundred and forty thousand   ... and it looks as thought we're gonna end up   ... certainly nearer to five ten than five forty.<br>
               [1965] Erm, but if we er are are going to   ... en  ... ensure that ministers can get   ... er, at least twelve a   [...] of twelve thousand next year then we have to er   ... erm   ... there has to be further offers from provinces.<br>
               [1966] As I say, there are three provinces who'd like to go further   ... and than that be even   ... er, more increases.<br>
               [1967] Now, I have   ... put down reports   ... about the finance committee   ... er   [...] as it were but I think the responses from the churches and districts    ...  [...] sort of calculator will be there, we think that it would seem as though we should only offer the same amount as last year.<br>
               [1968] But, I think if we have further discussions with churches and districts that we might see that we can break that   ... a bit further   ... for that reason when we come to   ... er, come to the resolutions I would advise you   ... er er propose a minor amendment with the second thing.<br>
