*NOR:	Mm.
*CHR:	White, pink, red into purple   (        ) 
*NOR:	Right know 
*CHR:	There are indeed, yes, but you don't tint, get the, the yellows into rhododendrons do you?
*NOR:	Not that I've ever seen, no. (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes, I've got lovely purply of variety.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	When you get such a splodge of colour eh, it's difficult to know just how well adjusted your colour level is on the television.
