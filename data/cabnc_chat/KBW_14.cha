*DOR:	Cos you don't usually have a blue face! (.) Still, when you're drawing, you can draw anything really. (.) Might have a red dress   (.) oh it's pyjamas I suppose, if they're in bed   (.) or a nightie? (.) Try and give her a red nightie.
*TIM:	That's the sky   (.) it's all
*DOR:	No, that's supposed to be what he's thinking look   (.) he's got little blobs coming from his head.
*TIM:	Why?
*DOR:	Cos he's thinking about Jesus. (.) I think he's going to the dentist or something, and he's a bit frightened   (.) so he thinks, he thinks of that.
