*GIN:	Oh never mind, when I was first married, it was carry coals up two flight of stairs to start with.
*JAC:	Oh  (        ) .

*GIN:	Yeah, that's right.
*JAC:	You know, (        ) .
*GIN:	Well we used to take it in our stride, I mean I grew up with an old Victorian house with potent fires and you had keep the fires going either wise in the winter it was bitterly cold, it was nice and cool in the summer coming out of the heat.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	But in the winter you needed the kitchen range and the dining room and drawing room needed fire then, and if anybody's was ill we had fireplaces in the bedrooms of course.
*JAC:	Mm.
*GIN:	But since I slept in, what used to be the maid's bedroom  ((laugh)) , I was always
*JAC:	I say, when you look at those days you wake up and  (        ) .

*GIN:	Stone floors down stairs .Would you know, we didn't have any serious illnesses as children, the only place we had a bit of warmth, used to have a valour lamp in the bathroom in the winter, had a valour lamp in there to keep the chill off .
*JAC:	Remember those   (        ) ones we used to have, the yorkstone, did you ever, ever had one of those?With the round   (        ) .

*DIN:	well we'll call him nine , he must be about nine.
*GIN:	They told us three and a half, but there again a lot of rescue people do cut the ages of their dog, but, but, our, our two vets agreed he was around three and a half, between three and a half and four, look at his teeth and his coat and his bones .
*DIN:	His eyes .

*JAC:	she's only a pup.   (        ) some dogs do   (        ) .

*GIN:	She's very well looked after ,
*DIN:	till she was about twelve she was quite   (        ) .
*GIN:	ever so bright, yes , they were playing and chasing sticks and
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*JAC:	I think it depends on the size .

*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	They're probably listening , listening for the foxes or something.
*JAC:	Heard something over there.
*DIN:	 (        ) , ((whistle)).
*GIN:	Obviously they heard something.
*JAC:	I'd have to take down the shore, (        ) shore tomorrow  (        ) .
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Saves leaving them in the car, probably only for about two hours, I don't know if it's better leaving at home or taking with me, there's   (        ) .
*GIN:	Don't you , don't you find he'd rat he'd much happier sitting in the car?
*JAC:	He seems to be, yes 
*GIN:	Than left at home, where you've gone away somewhere without him .
*JAC:	Well I don't really know, cos I don't know what he's like at home, you see by himself, huh.
*GIN:	No, exactly .But my dogs have always, much rather come shopping with me and sit in the, (        ) .
*JAC:	It's a short time though isn't it?.
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	It's not very long, see I say, what   (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh I don't know the supermarkets the best part of an hour this time of year.
*JAC:	I suppose it is, (        ) .
*GIN:	But, oh he's quite happy , he'll curl up in the back of a car, but when I come home and he goes so berserk if I've left him at home, I know that he's been watching and listening and waiting for me all that time.
*JAC:	He usually sits up at the window   (        ) .
*GIN:	That's right, yeah ,
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	but he knows where your car is you're not far away.
*JAC:	Yes that's true.
*GIN:	I think they work it out that way.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	At least you can let him, give him a run.
*JAC:	Yes I can down there, yeah, (        ) .

*GIN:	Oh, that's where we usually end up I'm afraid.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) air field.Well we go down there for all the permits and things anyway you see, recording there with the documents the P F A.

*DIN:	Yeah, it was amazing.
*GIN:	Beautiful
*DIN:	Singing their hearts out.
*JAC:	Was they?
*GIN:	Beautiful.
*JAC:	Think it's spring I suppose this weather.
*GIN:	 (        ) , they, remember last, end of last winter when it got mild after the cold spell, they were building their nests and then we got all that cold weather again, all the, all the fledglings were dead.
*JAC:	They died  (        ) .
*GIN:	Nests I found when I was clearing the garden, put the little eggs in and they'd all gone cold.
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*GIN:	Yes, yes.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	But, you think they had    (        )  (.) most of them do don't they?
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	They heard the geese know when to fly North, and when to fly South and navigate by the stars and by the lay lines in the earth, it's just isn't it magical?
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	No, no way, we used to, we used to, I mean ancient man did 
*JAC:	 (        ) , oh they did, yeah 
*GIN:	They navigated by the, by the ley lines , that's why you find monuments built up on hills so they could stand in the middle of the of nowhere and they could see a, they could either feel it through their feet
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	where the, where the main lines were, or they could look and see erm, what do you call them, those groups of trees on tops of hills they used
*JAC:	Oh I know.
*GIN:	there's one near Shoreham.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh, (        ) places like that.
*JAC:	Oh yeah.
*GIN:	They could see them and navigate by them, if they haven't got the sun or the stars, yeah, yeah, we've lost all that of course, as we got what we called civilised, we've lost all those old skills.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Yes
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Yeah,
*JAC:	 (        ) .

*GIN:	Mm, mm, (        ) .
*JAC:	 (        ) , I erm,
*GIN:	Oh yes.
*JAC:	I tried to phone the  (        ) , now who was it I saw, (        ) on a Saturday wasn't it, a Saturday, ah, it's still in there
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	and I, I went home, phoned them and he said well, I got  (        ) , there's nobody there, try he said between five and six that's his lunch hour  ((laugh)) , so I phoned, couldn't get, oh no I, I thought well it'll be too if I don't get   (        ) so I   (        ) took it home
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and I tried all weekend trying to get   (        ) only there from five to seven, and I got him after five o'clock on Tuesday
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	and er, I told him all about it, and I said I don't know what happened to   (        ) I spoke to somebody last Monday and he was coming down immediately for it, so he sort of said, well I'll come down for it, there's a different one, he got  (        ) , and he came down for it and he took it, so er, (        ) .
*GIN:	So, who, you took it out of the bushes.
*JAC:	Yes, I took it out of the bushes get  (        ) .
*GIN:	Yeah, it's gonna get rusted or, or
*JAC:	Well somebody take it   (        ) the owner wanted it back.
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	So he's gonna look all the way through the records  (        ) .
*GIN:	So it wasn't the bicycle people that, that the two, that they were laying in ambush for, must of been the car thieves they were laying in ambush for.
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*JAC:	 (        ) four hours  (        ) .
*GIN:	Suppose they would, yes, yes.
*JAC:	No, I think, I, I, he said, well, what with these, these he said, this is probably why he couldn't get down
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	probably forgot it.
*GIN:	Oh.
*JAC:	So anyway  (        ) , probably hear a name   (        ) who it was.
*GIN:	Mm, mm  (.) 
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Yes, I hope so too, but, I have the feeling that the next, the next time we looked I don't remember it having green peddles the first time you found it
*JAC:	Oh.
*GIN:	Sam found it.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	I mean they were bright green, and I thought it was a different bike, I didn't even   (.) noticed the second time if it was a ladies or a man's bike.
*JAC:	Well it looked as   (        ) cos when I picked it up, there's a sort of   (        ) thing was blown over,
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	so yes it could of been, yes, a long time actually.
*GIN:	Yeah, yeah.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	It wasn't muddy or rusted or anything.
*JAC:	No, no, it's got a bit of rust around the cha bit on the chain
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	but as you say, we haven't had much rain, have we ,
*GIN:	No, no .
*JAC:	it could have been  (        ) .
