@Comment:	conversation #162 (Tape 002710)
*DAV:	Slightly off centre . •169309_169386•
        Because of the danger of that ball jumping, you hit over the top like that, it'll jump. •169928_170423•
*CHR:	Yes. •170445_170490•
*DAV:	You, you take up the normal  I don't tend to do this, but this is really the best way to do the shot. •170517_171083•
*CHR:	Yes. •171094_171118•
*DAV:	Take up your normal start and then just tap the back a little bit cos you're hitting that ball on the upward swing then and there's no danger that you're gonna jump over it. •171127_171955•
        See if you'll try and get it to jump if you  . •171955_172177•
*CHR:	Yes , yes, yep. •172343_172537•
*DAV:	Very, very easy to get the finger on the •173555_173754•
*CHR:	Fine. •173787_173836•
*DAV:	Erm, bumpy lawns, jump that over ball. •173836_174141•
*CHR:	Right. •174172_174213•
        So step back and hit  hit it on the up stroke. •174290_174524•
*DAV:	Yeah, and try and ground the mallet a little bit, cos then the black ball will go quite nicely down there. •174541_175076•
*CHR:	Oh right, fine. •175076_175223•
