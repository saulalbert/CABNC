*PS0V4:	Erm .  569373_569633
*PS0V5:	And you see the nice people coming in and not getting really .  569633_573133
*PS0V4:	Mm .  573133_573273
*PS0V5:	what 's due to them see somebody coming in threaten to punch somebodies lights out and they get all the .  573783_579513
*PS0V4:	Yeah .  579903_580163
*PS0V5:	you know .  581743_582093
*PS0V4:	But then to my mind the person that who who threatens to punch the lights out and gets whatever they want everyone should get the degree of service .  582253_593253
*PS0V5:	Yeah but the do n't and unfortunately it 's the nice people that suffer .  593743_596913
*PS0V4:	No but it 's up to the every individual to try and make sure that they do get that level of service .  596913_603283
*PS0V5:	So what are yeah but if to get that level of service you 've got to threaten somebody .  604353_609933
*PS0V4:	Yeah well you you should n't have to threaten somebody to get good service .  609933_612933
*PS0V5:	no but you do have to .  613003_614393
*PS0V4:	You should n't .  615503_616013
*PS0V5:	No but you do in the in the end .  616373_618233
*PS0V4:	Depends on the people .  618233_619553
*PS0V5:	Mm .  620053_620223
*PS0V4:	Depends on the actual person you see and what their attitude is .  620393_624543
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  624543_624603
*PS0V4:	And I must admit once I 'd been I 'd early on when I did n't know an awful lot then yeah but later on when I had been more experienced there was n't there was very little difference between how I treated people whether they made a fuss or not .  625423_648233
*PS0V5:	Yeah that 's right well that 's the way it should be .  648593_650353
*PS0V4:	Mm .  650353_650523
*PS0V5:	but you 're in the mi minority in in actually .  650983_653263
*PS0V4:	Mm .  653813_653893
*PS0V5:	doing that and saying that and that 's wrong .  654313_658123
*PS0V4:	Mm yeah I 'm .  658213_659893
*PS0V5:	But .  659893_660003
*PS0V4:	trying to do something about it .  660033_661163
*PS0V5:	yeah .  661823_662433
*PS0V4:	0 . 
*PS0V5:	That 's right I mean the thing is you train people to do it properly .  663393_668783
*PS0V4:	Yeah .  669083_669363
*PS0V5:	they then go back to their office and unfortunately a lot of what other people in the office are doing are taught .  670033_675843
*PS0V4:	Yeah .  676293_676543
*PS0V5:	and that I think really have more of an influence cos they 're not going to change themselves into an individual .  677573_685033
*PS0V4:	No .  685833_686053
*PS0V5:	by doing something different to everyone else .  686113_690803
*PS0V4:	Yeah I see what you mean They 're not in a situation where they can take an individual line at that point .  690843_699443
*PS0V5:	No .  700123_700293
*PS0V4:	It 's only later on when they 're more experienced that they can actually say well hang on a minute I can do more for this person and I 'm going to do more for this person .  700293_712573
*PS0V5:	But I think that 's the only thing were if I worked in a benefit office I would n't get on very well because if I saw something I 'd try and move heaven and earth to make everything to go right for me .  712573_722953
*PS0V4:	And that and that would make you good .  722953_724823
*PS0V5:	Yeah but in the beginning I 'd get criticized for not being quick enough in my .  725363_729013
*PS0V4:	I do n't know .  729043_729413
*PS0V5:	because I 'd chase people round to find till I found out what I wanted to know .  729413_733403
*PS0V4:	Mm yeah .  733403_734003
*PS0V5:	Do you know what I mean .  734943_735553
*PS0V4:	The sort of things I 'm talking about I 'm I 'm thinking of is ok somebody a mistake 's been made somebody has n't got their payment out .  735913_743073
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  743073_743263
*PS0V4:	alright and the difference between that is er and then the degree of service that they get erm you can say you 'll get it in the post two days in in two days or you can say erm we 'll get a giro cheque written out for you initial it to you at the counter .  744243_768073
*PS0V5:	Mm .  768743_768813
*PS0V4:	at half past three or you can say if you 'd like to if you 'd like to wait for half an hour we 'll get a giro cheque to issued to you or if you 'd rather you can come back at half past three and collect it .  769233_787403
*PS0V5:	Yeah that unfortunately the majority of people say you 'll get money in a couple of days then the person would start to argue because they need their money now to go and buy their shopping .  790983_800053
*PS0V4:	Yeah yeah and that 's degrees of service .  800193_813993
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  814773_815003
*PS0V4:	I mean that in that situation I would try and say sort of .  815183_821363
*PS0V5:	Me I I know .  824823_825533
*PS0V4:	Do you need the money urgently .  825533_827003
*PS0V5:	Mm and they 're always going to say yes are n't they unless they 're a reasonable human being and has got a bit of money they can use .  827473_834883
*PS0V4:	Yeah yeah only erm .  836373_840493
*PS0V5:	But I must admit I I am a bit snobbish in it I would move heaven and earth to help someone who looked clean and nice and had good manners .  840893_851103
*PS0V4:	Mm .  851553_851653
*PS0V5:	If it was someone coming in with a nasty attitude really filthy scruffy dirty no fixed address because they lived in er er an old wagon some where .  853823_867423
*PS0V4:	Mm .  867753_868013
*PS0V5:	I think I 'd be less inclined .  868273_870073
*PS0V4:	Yeah .  870533_870883
*PS0V5:	but having said that I 'd still give them .  871003_872973
*PS0V4:	Only thing is dealing with the awkward people .  874453_876383
*PS0V6:	Shall I get down .  876383_877113
*PS0V5:	Yeah yes please .  877393_877863
*PS0V4:	that distinguishes a professional to somebody who is n't .  879283_883993
*PS0V5:	Oh yeah I I 'd give them the same options but .  884393_886853
*PS0V6:	Ow .  886853_887123
*PS0V5:	with someone who 's nice put it that way I 'd almost definitely try I 'd get the say that they could have the giro today .  888153_895993
*PS0V4:	Mm .  896443_896663
*PS0V5:	Straight away With someone who 's not I 'd try and get them to wait for a couple of days and then if they would n't I 'd go through the and get them it today .  896913_907043
*PS0V4:	Mm mm .  907433_907633
*PS0V5:	Do do you see the difference It would n't be I would n't say oh no you ca n't have it but I 'd say well you 'll receive it in a couple of days time and if they said oh well that 's not good enough then fair enough you you know .  907893_920173
*PS0V4:	Mm .  920453_920713
*PS0V5:	But somebody who 's nice I 'd think no why .  922653_924683
*PS0V4:	Mm .  924683_924753
*PS0V5:	should they have to wait because but the I these people they are they 've opted out of society they want nothing to do .  924753_936843
*PS0V4:	They do n't .  936843_937123
*PS0V5:	with society apart from the giro cheque on paper .  937123_940163
*PS0V4:	yeah well they do n't .  940163_941083
*PS0V5:	they want .  941083_941553
*PS0V4:	you do n't have problems with their payments .  942003_943653
*PS0V5:	no no it 's it 's the people that think the world owes them a living but they do n't want to give anything back and that really bugs me .  943863_950963
*PS0V4:	Yeah .  951493_951743
*PS0V5:	You know what I mean .  952653_953283
*PS0V4:	Mm mm yeah I must admit I would n't I agree with what you say where I would n't classify those people as being of no fixed abode they 're not necessarily of no fixed abode there are a lot of people who would living in flats and Council houses and things like that they 've got that attitude .  953493_972363
*PS0V5:	Who .  972723_972913

*PS0V5:	Ok only I have n't got time today if we can do the that today look might as well get done really .  1039343_1044963
*PS0V4:	It is it is a bit more complicated than that .  1045653_1048083
*PS0V5:	Mm .  1048193_1048283
*PS0V4:	in that er some people would like to work but the level the amount of money they need coming in is not in line with the amount they can realistically expect to earn and that 's a difficult situation .  1048523_1073273
*PS0V5:	Yeah but then they 've got to adjust their life style .  1073373_1075893
*PS0V4:	Mm erm yeah you ca n't adjust your life style by killing a couple of kids .  1076193_1081813
*PS0V5:	Oh no .  1081923_1082023
*PS0V4:	that 's the only problem if you 've got a large family and you 've had a well paid job and then you loose it .  1082023_1088033
*PS0V5:	yeah .  1089303_1089553
*PS0V4:	erm and you 're not likely to be able to get into that line of work again .  1089553_1093103
*PS0V5:	Mm .  1093103_1093163
*PS0V4:	it it can be quite difficult .  1093833_1095243
*PS0V5:	Mm .  1095473_1095543
*PS0V4:	but there are what there was n't before that there is now is these erm .  1095793_1100593
*PS0V5:	But then as I say if you 've got a fam if you if you can get a job and you you it 's their just life style adjusting .  1100593_1109533
*PS0V4:	well no because what you can do know is you can go to somebody who will sit down with a mini computer and that 's what you need a mini computer and will sit down and will look at a job and will say right if you take this job it can also claim Family Credit of so much and and they actually do a a sort of alternative benefit calculation and what they do is they look at if you take this job and take all the other things into account will you be better off .  1110233_1145603
*PS0V5:	Mm Mm .  1145603_1146723
*PS0V4:	And they 'll actually sit down and work that out for people and encourage them to go for a job and give them all the forms they need to claim Family Credit or whatever .  1146723_1154823
*PS0V5:	Well that 's what I was gon na say if the system works properly there 's no way .  1154823_1159353
*PS0V4:	But sometimes people fall through the cracks .  1159353_1162853
*PS0V5:	Mm .  1163123_1163613
*PS0V4:	and if you can actually have somebody go who 's interested in going for a job and when you do that sort of calculation they end up they 're gon na be worse off .  1163663_1171493
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  1171933_1172003
*PS0V4:	And that should n't be allowed to happen but it does .  1172003_1174393
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  1176063_1176393
*PS0V4:	Because it does n't su it does n't match the whole there there are holes in it .  1176393_1179853
*PS0V5:	Yeah so so what happens then if they say I 'm not even going to that interview then because I could n't live on it even with all the other benefits what happens then .  1179913_1189293
*PS0V4:	Right erm .  1189743_1191623
*PS0V5:	See this is it they get punished then do n't they for not for not trying .  1191623_1196433
*PS0V4:	Well erm as I understand it er calculations for in work benefit at erm by somebody who 's separate from the normal benefit section .  1196433_1206443
*PS0V5:	Mm .  1207113_1207203
*PS0V4:	and I do n't think they they will pass on information about somebody actually refusing to take a job .  1207203_1214163
*PS0V5:	Because of the pay .  1214333_1214793
*PS0V4:	because of the pay .  1214933_1215163
*PS0V5:	Oh .  1220943_1221203
*PS0V4:	But the system ought to be water tight so that people are better off .  1221473_1225893
*PS0V5:	Mm .  1226693_1226823
*PS0V4:	but the trouble is it 's so complicated there are always exceptions and problems that cause .  1226823_1231853
*PS0V5:	Yeah but I mean be honest you you say that but people have got to be prepared to adjust as well .  1232323_1239103
*PS0V4:	Oh yeah .  1239983_1241183
*PS0V5:	Because you say someone with a large family and they need a lot of money you see someone with a large family .  1241183_1248463
*PS0V4:	Yeah .  1249523_1250173
*PS0V5:	Child Benefit or something like that .  1250953_1252413
*PS0V4:	Mm mm .  1252413_1252823
*PS0V5:	and they 're not given a large amount of money .  1252823_1255483
*PS0V4:	No .  1256073_1256183
*PS0V5:	and there 's somebody else saying oh I need five hundred pounds a month more than that to live and you think well hang on .  1256183_1268063
*PS0V4:	Well .  1268543_1268653

*PS0V4:	yeah .  1272893_1273043
*PS0V5:	why should this person need five hundred pound a month more .  1273043_1275923
*PS0V4:	What you 've got to take into account is that an all there 's an awful lot of things that you get when your unemployed that stop when you find a job .  1275923_1282463
*PS0V5:	Oh yeah cos I mean I know they pay mortgage for you well not mortgage but interest on your mortgage .  1282463_1287103
*PS0V4:	Interest on mortgage yeah .  1287103_1288433

*PS0V4:	mm Also if you 're in rented accommodation you 're claiming housing benefit you 'll probably have n't got to pay any rent specially if it 's Council there 's relief relief from paying .  1291423_1300183
*PS0V5:	Provided if your pay is that low .  1300183_1301593

*PS0V4:	Yeah .  1318363_1318763

*PS0V5:	and they 're still saying they 're not getting enough .  1320553_1323063
*PS0V4:	Mm .  1323063_1323303

*PS0V5:	I do n't know but it 's I do n't know I it 's a very difficult sort of situation where you get there are so many things to look into and it 's not being done well enough .  1468463_1484793
*PS0V4:	Mm .  1485173_1485273
*PS0V5:	basically .  1485283_1485293

*PS0V5:	Mm it is but it 's still not being done well as .  1487363_1489043
*PS0V4:	There 's no way it should be that complicated a lot of the problems are caused by the rules being so complicated that you have to be working in that particular field .  1489043_1502743
*PS0V5:	Mm .  1503273_1503553

*PS0V4:	But then they tend to get promoted and move on to other things .  1530043_1535673
*PS0V5:	Yeah but I I think the reason I feel a bit bitter about it is living round here you see all the dirties and the scruffies you get annoyed absolute no order they 've crawled into the system right up to and doing openly in front of you .  1535673_1553253
*PS0V4:	Yeah mm .  1553253_1553963

*PS0V4:	mm .  1576983_1577073

*PS0V4:	Mm .  1584413_1584623

*PS0V5:	Yeah .  1709153_1709493
*PS0V4:	They might think they 're getting away with it a lot of people who who I mean being unemployed is n't you tend people tend to feel devalued and so if they can think oh they 've put one over on that on the er benefit office then they 'll go and brag down the pub about it .  1709573_1731923

*PS0V5:	0 . 
*PS0V4:	It 's quite a good one .  2043673_2046043

*PS0V5:	Would you want to .  2052913_2054083
*PS0V4:	What you could then do which I think would probably help cos you see you do n't get State Retirement Pension till you 're sixty five .  2054083_2063033
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  2063042_2063053
*PS0V4:	but what I what would be a possibility at sixty two when I 'm at that point I 'd be receiving half pay .  2063053_2072693
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  2072693_2073213
*PS0V4:	as a pension so if I 'd retired at that point and then worked part time .  2073273_2079283
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  2079283_2079503
*PS0V4:	to keep your green matter in the wear .  2079563_2083923
*PS0V5:	Yeah yeah .  2083923_2084103
*PS0V4:	As an A O somewhere .  2084263_2087053
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  2087053_2087343
*PS0V4:	So I 'll reach State Retirement Age we can end up with virtually full pay .  2087343_2093233
*PS0V5:	Yeah .  2093273_2093843
*PS0V4:	When I 've I 've got .  2094363_2098633
*PS0V5:	that 's if I was still working .  2098633_2099393
*PS0V4:	I 'd be working part time for full pay if you see what I mean .  2099393_2104053
*PS0V5:	Yeah yeah .  2104053_2104253
*PS0V4:	and then at retirement age I would continue to receive half pay plus retirement pen State Retirement Pension .  2104253_2112553
*PS0V5:	Mm .  2112803_2113163
*PS0V4:	which be at the equivalent of about seventy quid a week as well .  2113163_2117303
*PS0V5:	Yeah I h I honestly think though that when erm I do n't know you see cos I I 's been saying oh when I get a chance I 'll get a transfer out of my office .  2117543_2132373
*PS0V4:	Mm .  2132583_2132663
*PS0V5:	because of they way it 's run .  2133513_2134333
*PS0V4:	Mm .  2134333_2134453
*PS0V5:	but they way it is at the moment with me able to use the car for work .  2134462_2139033
*PS0V4:	Mm mm .  2139073_2139693
*PS0V5:	and things you think is it worth it because the car would be sat out here if if say say I transferred and still did three days but did it when you work .  2139693_2150703
*PS0V4:	Mm yeah .  2150893_2151223

*PS0V4:	Mm .  2162873_2163043
*PS0V5:	so I 'd be paying we 'd be paying for our petrol which would n't be a lot different to what it is now really .  2163063_2171763
*PS0V4:	No .  2171763_2171933
*PS0V5:	a bit two or three pounds a week perhaps .  2172443_2174383
*PS0V4:	mm .  2174383_2174443
*PS0V5:	and I 'd be paying a lot more in bus fare .  2174443_2177523
*PS0V4:	Mm .  2177803_2177883
*PS0V5:	plus you have n't got the convenience of being able to go and get in your car .  2177883_2184153
*PS0V4:	Yeah cos standing about waiting for buses is not fun .  2184153_2188493
