        Yes. •105299_105314•
        They were cheaper. •105461_105553•
        I got the price for you. •105553_106099•
*ANN:	Cheaper than the do-it-yourself shop up Brady's? •106099_106296•
*JAM:	They were both •106297_106513•
*ANN:	But when, can we get through to Newcastle? •106513_106896•
*JAM:	Well I  well I'll have a week's holiday after Easter and I've gotta go  unless we go to . •106896_107457•

*ANN:	Which Tuesday? •108251_108570•
        After they break up? •108570_108688•
*JAM:	That's right. •108688_109295•
        Which is, this, next Friday. •109357_109613•
*ANN:	Yes. •109752_109777•
*JAM:	So I hope to sort it out  the Lenten appeal  well •109777_110182•
*ANN:	The what? •110336_110361•
*JAM:	The  •110361_110409•
*ANN:	 •110550_•
*JAM:	the Lenten's appeal at the schools  that Mrs  was supposed to  let Miss  know  so she could get it off to the parents to get the money back  so that they bought the scanner. •110565_112069•
*ANN:	See, you didn't tell me about that. •112204_112491•
*JAM:	I did tell you. •112491_112812•
*ANN:	You didn't. •112812_112839•
        All you told me  go on  ah  only this one's •112840_113690•
*JAM:	Miss  wanted to  •113691_113866•
*ANN:	all you told me was that Miss  was retiring. •113866_114057•
        But, I haven't to tell anyone. •114057_114340•
        Which I haven't done. •114340_114539•
        Which I don't intend to do. •114539_114849•
*JAM:	At the beginning of Lent Miss  approached me •114849_115298•
*ANN:	Yes. •115370_115378•
*JAM:	to see  what she should do about the Lenten appeal •115378_115905•
*ANN:	Aha. •116035_116076•
*JAM:	as she always does. •116157_116277•
        Since I said, why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was  plenty of children's things local? •116292_117580•
*ANN:	Yes. •117626_117641•
*JAM:	So I asked if we wanted anything? •117641_117877•
        And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital? •117877_118087•
*ANN:	What good's a bed with no extra nurses? •118087_118555•
*JAM:	Well there are special beds. •118555_118849•
*ANN:	Oh you mean a bed? •118859_119049•
        Well •119049_119087•
*JAM:	Tt! •119099_119123•
*ANN:	D'ya mean a special kind of mattress  •119123_119272•
*JAM:	Well, she just asked about a bed, so I told her that  we were •119317_119713•
*ANN:	You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is? •119713_119978•
        But why's  •119978_120128•
*JAM:	She she just said a bed, and so  •120129_120301•
*ANN:	Yes. •120400_120407•
*JAM:	I told her there were special beds that we have  are very useful, in fact  very necessary in some, some cases, and are  painfully short of them. •120407_121791•
*ANN:	Aha. •121791_121802•
*JAM:	And a Nimbas bed  costs two thousand pound. •121802_122136•
        And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of, which costs a lot more. •122149_123252•
*ANN:	Mhm. •123271_123289•
*JAM:	Something like, five thousand. •123289_123421•
        But I can't remember the name. •123427_123739•
        Anyway, I said I'd  make enquiries as to what is wanted. •123739_124272•
        And I said there's a, there's a new children's ward  will open at the Wandsbergh Hospital  perhaps they would like something. •124485_125356•
        I saw Mrs , and Mrs  said  they were aiming to raise money for the scanner appeal. •125356_125962•
*ANN:	Yeah. •125962_125979•
*JAM:	But, also they're going to  have a  an obstetric adult patient's department  at the College Hospital for the very first time. •126052_127488•
*ANN:	A what? •127505_127544•
        A •127544_127575•
*JAM:	An obstetric outpatients •127600_127718•
*ANN:	Yeah. •127718_127778•
        Yeah. •127997_128006•
*JAM:	and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other children  with mothers then  so they would like perhaps a play facility there. •128015_128863•
        And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to the •128879_129399•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*JAM:	or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty •129643_130131•
*ANN:	Yes. •130131_130155•
*JAM:	there's very limited facilities for children to play. •130199_130575•
        So  but I also coaxed Mrs  about  the Wandsbergh . •130744_131433•
        Anyway, she  wanted to, me to go and see her, she said there there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible  and  because there was an arts appeal and  for arts facilities at the hospital, and all sorts of things. •131433_133684•
        So  I went back to Miss  and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be  she thought that that would be the best idea. •133768_134611•
        Not the children's things at the  Cottage Hospital. •134662_134964•
        I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital  and  the children from  will be invited to the hospital for that day  that week, sorry. •134978_136188•
        It's gonna be a week  . •136210_136315•
        So she wanted to know what date it is. •136315_136870•
        So I, I asked Mrs  to  but would she write to Miss  and give her all the details. •137007_137422•
        And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all. •137422_137737•
        And that she was going on Wednesday, I think. •137737_138013•
        Up she went  you know •138108_138180•
*ANN:	Hold on. •138333_138365•
        Which one was going to see which  •138365_138487•
*JAM:	It's  •138487_138520•
*ANN:	one? •138521_138522•
*JAM:	Mrs  was going to see Miss  •138522_138707•
*ANN:	Was going to see Miss  •138707_138751•
*JAM:	. •_•
*ANN:	Oh. •138751_138761•
        I see. •138871_138877•
        I didn't know which one. •138998_139074•
*JAM:	But I give them a  so then I saw Mrs  on Tuesday    when I was at Ashington. •139146_139898•
        And she came up with all sorts of things that  she would like for the  the new Wandsbergh development. •139898_140769•
        But on a  but there's nothing ready of course, so there's, there's a  giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards  and it's a giant one  it's, it's the, the building and the blocks of  things in, in the  in the courtyard that make up the  the time. •140784_143188•
        So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the  of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine o'clock and so forth. •143239_144130•
        This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got  •144202_144666•
*ANN:	Hold on. •144666_144710•
        how  where is it going to be seen from? •144729_144938•
*JAM:	I presume it's seen from the wards  that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard. •144974_145464•
        There's also erm  a play area for the  the children's ward  there's also some murals on the  the walls, various artistic murals. •145471_146825•
        And, of course, they've got this grant from  Artcan  for six thousand pound  for a proggie mat exhibition. •146834_147559•
*ANN:	A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat  •147811_148478•
*JAM:	Well •148478_148500•
*ANN:	exhibition? •148561_148578•
*JAM:	well over, over a period, it's  and other things too but they they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it. •148578_149316•
        And various other art things. •149728_149850•
        But also,the thought of a a garden and the children keeping the garden  up. •149858_150363•
        But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here  to  the Wandsbergh Hospital. •150475_151370•
        But then I thought, perhaps  if  that  •151370_151799•
*ANN:	I can't see the education committee  with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here  •151922_152478•
*JAM:	Well they won't  •152478_152549•
*ANN:	to go Ashington Hospital to do a  •152550_152654•
*JAM:	they won't so they, they  •152654_152738•
*ANN:	garden. •152780_152798•
*JAM:	the, the, the  education committee and the school governors have no money at all  •152798_153128•
*ANN:	No. •153196_153214•
*JAM:	to pay for that. •153214_153244•
*ANN:	I would expect  •153244_153265•
*JAM:	But then  •153282_153356•
*ANN:	that's a very low priority. •153356_153477•
*JAM:	well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing. •153477_153722•
        They won't get the money. •153726_153840•
        they won't pay for them to go swimming  •153840_153980•
*ANN:	Well I don't •153998_154054•
*JAM:	they've gotta walk to go swimming. •154055_154133•
        But, I thought that  now that the M S has acquired that bus  and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time  and it's a twenty nine seater bus. •154133_155638•
        I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in  but  in between times it's twenty seats you see. •155638_156573•
*ANN:	And then you'll need a P S V  •156573_156750•
*JAM:	Well  •156750_156765•
*ANN:	licence. •156765_156790•
