*FRE:	I should've got a day return, it wouldn't, it'll been cheaper.
*NON:	I did, but, how much for a single, two pound sixty and return two pound seventy.
*FRE:	Yeah, ten pence difference. ((noise - train))
*NON:	 (        ) .What, a day return you see, is usually cheaper than a single, well it use to be.
*FRE:	Yeah, I think it might be now.
*NON:	You see, he   (        ) pay the proper fare, if you only have a single.
*FRE:	Yeah.
*NON:	Pay the normal fare.
