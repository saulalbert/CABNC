*DAV:	Eh, you can see where the  was there. •131070_131533•
*CHR:	Yep. •131533_131543•
*DAV:	Probably somewhere round here, must be. •131543_131965•
*CHR:	Other side?. •132073_132122•
*DAV:	Got to be this side. •132862_132947•
*CHR:	Right. •132965_133086•
        Fine. •133086_133113•
*DAV:	Not a very accurate . •133113_133612•
*CHR:	No. •133675_133714•
*DAV:	. •_•
        One of the problems was really was . •133793_134153•
*CHR:	Yes. •134196_134215•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yep. •134312_134330•
*DAV:	I've already  so I've had it. •134330_134547•
*CHR:	Oh bad luck. •134582_134658•
*DAV:	Yes. •134672_134688•
*CHR:	Yes. •134706_134744•
*DAV:	So I've , well what I can do is go down there. •134779_135351•
        Unfortunately that's right in the way. •135462_135952•
        I've got a continuation shot, well what I shall do is just try and line them up for a rush down to , which is not bad. •136299_137533•
*CHR:	No. •137541_137554•
        Fine. •137665_137697•
*DAV:	O K. •137746_137785•
*CHR:	O K. •137785_137796•
*DAV:	I think probably that red •137796_137920•
*CHR:	Yes, back down here again? •137955_138308•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes I have, yes. •138456_138558•
*DAV:	Erm, take . •138931_138980•
*CHR:	Right. •139066_139098•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	But it's still best to remove the temptation here. •139350_139617•
*DAV:	Yeah, it would. •139684_140097•
*CHR:	Right, right. •140495_140890•
*DAV:	down here.. •141013_141185•
*CHR:	Right, O K. •142070_142417•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right. •142667_142691•
*DAV:	So what, what most people do, is when they bring the mallets back, they tend to twist them. •142691_143261•
*CHR:	Aha. •143297_143358•
        Yes. •143389_143402•
*DAV:	It's easy when you're pushing forward to keep it straight, it's when you bring it back it tends to twist. •143402_143780•
*CHR:	Surely. •143786_143823•
*DAV:	So try and concentrate on bringing it back and then, bring, I mean, you can bring it back fairly slowly. •143828_144297•
*CHR:	Alright, oh fine, yes. •144314_144493•
*DAV:	Very good, it's nice to see you hitting a ball like that. •144993_146520•
*CHR:	Yes, it felt good too. •146531_146702•
*DAV:	Yes. •146702_146723•
*CHR:	You could actually feel it working well. •146723_146942•
*DAV:	Yes, you brought the mallet back nice and slowly. •146973_147214•
*CHR:	And I was aiming between them to be honest. •147214_147377•
*DAV:	You obviously could of got . •147415_147481•
*CHR:	O K, I should, yes. •147910_148052•
*DAV:	Erm, you can always stop and ask. •148054_148772•
*CHR:	Yes. •148772_148806•
*DAV:	The trouble is you can make, there's a lot of people, it's very easy when you're concentrating on what you're going to do next, you forget the colour you're playing. •148806_149480•
*CHR:	Yes. •149483_149520•
*DAV:	Especially when you're making a break, so having made the . •149529_150052•
*CHR:	Right. •150172_150196•
*DAV:	So you know you're playing with red. •150196_150314•
*CHR:	I see, yes. •150332_150442•
*DAV:	Cos don't forget you're playing with two balls. •150446_150798•
*CHR:	Quite. •150845_151012•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Right. •151217_151255•
*DAV:	Eh, the danger is, if you don't, then, break down, if you leave my blue near the er black break down then I'm just going to get back in. •151316_152310•
*CHR:	Yes, yes. •152333_152436•
*DAV:	So, with, if a very difficult shot, what what I'll do is just . •152436_152972•
        Let's just do a . •153144_153220•
*CHR:	To, to, not necessarily to hit the black, but to •153220_153864•
*DAV:	No not necessarily. •154006_154186•
*CHR:	Right, O K,. •154186_154451•
