*KB1PSUN:	It 'll not be a dodgy one Put it in there then . 
*PS01A:	It wo n't be it 's not forced to be a building society . 
*PS01F:	No it is n't It gon na to be a building society . 
*PS01A:	Oh well it might be Abbey National . 
*PS01F:	No it 's come back it 's got Target Finance on it . 
*PS01A:	Ah Well that 's o that is a finance company and not a building society If it says finance it does n't mean a building society Nine times out of ten it 's a finance company Same as er Mercantile and . 
*PS01B:	Well (be)cause I mean we dealt with Mercantile we dealt with Key Finance . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01B:	Er . 
*PS01A:	We 've dealt with summat Wagon . 
*PS01B:	Key that when we first bo when we first bought our car through that Scottis that bloody bank . 
*PS01A:	Scottish Amicable . 
*PS01B:	Scottish Amicable . 
*PS01F:	Like Widows . 
*PS01B:	They 're always ringing up They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at night . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	Asking us whether we want to borrow some money . 
*PS01B:	Er asking if there 's anything we co look at him walking about with that . 
*PS01F:	Everything everything what oh papers have got has got Legal and General on it . 
*PS01B:	Mm . 
*PS01F:	So I thought well . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01F:	it ca n't be a a dodgy . 
*PS01B:	I do n't think it 'll be anything dodgy . 
*PS01A:	It wo n't be dodgy . 
*PS01F:	Oh . 
*PS01A:	But you can always easily find out . 
*PS01B:	What usually happens though . 
*PS01A:	All you do is pick the phone up and and get oh now what place do you ring I forgot what place you ring but we 're find out and you ring up to see what they 're what the company 's like You know if it 's a variable company . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	Things like that you could do that . 
*PS01B:	Different companies take over I remember that time we borrowed that four thousand pound We started out with Key Finance and we ended up with Mercantile Credit did n't we . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01B:	Changed companies three times that time we had that four thousand pounds . 
*PS01F:	You told me about that yeah Well said that it will be a sm a really small building society He says that (be)cause er it 's not . 
*PS01A:	Well . 
*PS01F:	Big building societies are not prepared to give you rates and small building societies are wanting to get going . 
*PS01A:	You see the only trouble with building societies is it 's the same when you buy a pigging house they put the money on what you 've actually borrowed every year . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	Well finance companies only you only get the interest on what is left . 
*PS01B:	On the money that you owe . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	That 's the difference And between them both you can you could I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage mortgage and you could end up paying what twenty thousand twenty four thousand back . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	Well finance company You you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to and you get a certain amount put on that and that 's it it 's fixed . 
*PS01F:	No . 
*PS01A:	You do n't pay no more Say you 'll you 'll you 'll get twenty thousand five hundred that if you buy if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures You borrow twenty thousand and the interest payments works out . 
*PS01B:	Benji . 
*PS01A:	very high . 
*PS01B:	He 's alright . 
*PS01A:	It 's very high you know the interest payments are very high but for that money you 've borrowed you 'll only pay say just for a a figure five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand five you know . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	five thousand pound not . 
*PS01F:	Not paying it for years and years all the time . 
*PS01A:	But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company you 're gon na you 're gon na borrow twice that you gon na have to pay twice that much back Forty grand you kn that 's the only difference and . 
*PS01F:	I do n't mind that so much though (be)cause they say we are paying a lot less back a month than other way But I just got one thing that I want that they gon na send me owt dodgy like a loan shark bloke or owt like that I mean you you 're bound to be a bit nervous you know . 
*PS01A:	No they wo n't send a loan shark You you can tell loan sharks straight away because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent Ma maybe twenty nine even thirty depending but if it er mind you I do n't know because it 's a long time since I had a look at 'em But you know when you when you borrow money you get er an interest rate do n't you over so many yo you 've got to figure out ho how many years you 're gon na pay it back You know If you say oh we 'll take it over ten years Well you 've got ten years interest to pay ai n't ya So you pay the interest for for nine years and they start paying your loan off . 
*PS01F:	We 're still having trouble getting insurance and er anyway I phoned and I wrote him again yesterday and he 's given this number who er who he 's with (be)cause he had a right job got plastic (be)cause he even plastics I mean that 's . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01F:	Inflammable ai n't it Anyway er the bloke who managed to get him insurance this this the premises are insured with him . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01F:	so I thought well if he 's already got er part of his insurance without having . 
*PS01A:	Yeah because he was in paper waste paper and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal . 
*PS01F:	That 's where cardboard and paper . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01F:	Sasha come in here shut door . 
*PS01G:	He 's not coming in . 
*PS01A:	But er I ca n't understand why because I mean let's face it he he 's only using fibre-glass and they 're not that flammable . 
*PS01F:	No what they 're saying is Not the flammable it 's the er indemnity nobody can breathing it in who 's in . 
*PS01A:	Oh yeah yeah . 
*PS01F:	They 're frightened like in years to come like they 're gon na try and make a claim against them (be)cause their er been on the chest is summat like that . 
*PS01A:	Yeah I it 's health and safety yeah . 
*PS01F:	er . 
*PS01A:	Through the health and safety but . 
*PS01B:	Eighty four we had this extension put up . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01F:	Sasha come in here . 
*PS01A:	But after saying that . 
*PS01F:	There 's a draught in . 
*PS01A:	what you got ta do is make up your mind what chemicals you 're gon na use . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	and then find out all about . 
*PS01F:	What ya got . 
*PS01G:	Do n't know . 
*PS01A:	them particular chemicals and then submit it to the the insurance company what them 's the only chemicals you use and the company said this and that . 
*PS01F:	they told him that . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	And they still . 
*PS01F:	See he 's off again I bet it is Just started itching . 
*PS01A:	Well he has just flown about . 
*PS01F:	0 . 
*PS01A:	I say he 's just flown round bloody house . 
*PS01F:	He has . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01F:	Oh I bet . 
*PS01G:	0 . 
*PS01F:	(be)cause I thought I 'd look . 
*PS01B:	Aye . 
*PS01F:	I could n't . 
*PS01A:	It might be dust out of his wings . 
*PS01F:	Yeah I every time I come here . 
*PS01B:	Nineteen ninety one ninety two . 
*PS01F:	I must have sensitive eyes . 
*PS01B:	Eighteen hundred and fifty two . 
*PS01A:	Dear me . 
*PS01B:	We 've had that pebble-dash nearly nearly it 's nearly two years since they did that pebble-dash Cost us two thousand nine hundred and in two years we 've only paid eight hundred nine hundred . 
*PS01A:	0 . 
*PS01B:	A hundred . 
*PS01F:	0 . 
*PS01B:	A hundred and forty pound . 
*PS01A:	0 . 
*PS01B:	we 've paid off in two years Karen . 
*PS01F:	How much . 
*PS01B:	A hundred and forty pound . 
*PS01A:	In two years . 
*PS01B:	In two years . 
*PS01A:	Now if that had been a finance company I would have paid a damn sight more . 
*PS01B:	But it cost us thirty seven pound a month But last year we put no wait a minute last year we paid 'em four hundred and eight pound fifty two and they put two hundred and seventy two pound fifty interest on So actually all we paid was . 
*PS01A:	Thirty seven per cent . 
*PS01B:	Thirty odd thirty . 
*PS01A:	That 's round about thirty-seven per cent in n it somewhere around there . 
*PS01B:	Yeah we paid thirty eight pound off it last year . 
*PS01A:	Makes more It 's ridiculous you know mortgage payments When you think of it . 
*PS01F:	I know . 
*PS01B:	and on 'ouse they put eight hundred and ninety eight pound you could say nine hundred pound interest on 'ouse . 
*PS01A:	Oi I do n't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are because you know it it 's totally unfair . 
*PS01F:	They are . 
*PS01A:	I mean alright we know you 're handling large lumps of money but when you think of it if you if you borrowed it at a different rate you know same rate as you could do finance (be)cause which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	You know what I mean Instead of having all these different mortgage companies Abbey National and that the government have er have er a whatsname to do it they 're would n't be half and a quarter I mean it happens all over the world you know in in the in the especially in the whatsname countries . 
*PS01F:	I know . 
*PS01A:	Communist countries Everything 's owned by the by the government and er I know it 's not a right good thing like but if it could work properly it would be a damn good thing . 
*PS01B:	Watch she do n't bite ya . 
*PS01A:	I mean communism in England . 
*PS01G:	0 . 
*PS01A:	in it 's in it 's proper form would be a wonderful thing but er it 's on because er it 's only the rich people what make people poor . 
*PS01F:	I know . 
*PS01A:	The say as with damn education like at bloody Tory sods they took all blinking we gi for al for all these people what 's going to college every time they drop on holidays they 've got nothing to keep 'em . 
*PS01F:	No . 
*PS01A:	So I my opinion what this government 's doing is stopping stopping the lower class well I say lower classes the lo the the . 
*PS01B:	is n't it . 
*PS01A:	poorer people they stop 'em getting educated That I 'm I 'm almost convinced . 
*PS01F:	Yeah . 
*PS01G:	0 . 
*PS01A:	It says everything they 're doing it says is going back to the eighteenth century when you hear about these Kath Catherine Cookson days working for pennies and you ca n't get educated . 
*PS01B:	0 . 
*PS01F:	un cutting back . 
*PS01A:	They 're cutting back on education . 
*PS01B:	Oh you 're telling me . 
*PS01A:	They 're making it so only the rich can be educated . 
*PS01F:	Yeah trying to turn it back into . 
*PS01B:	at the end of the day . 
*PS01A:	I mean our Colin 's there waiting for a grant and what 's happening Sweet nothing Now we 're it were in bloody paper last on Thursday they do n't get nothing when they 're on holiday . 
*PS01F:	No they do n't . 
*PS01A:	I mean how the hell they supposed at eighteen year old without a job . 
*PS01F:	Mm . 
*PS01A:	If they have a job they do n't get no grants And how can you have hold a a job down . 
*PS01F:	I do n't think . 
*PS01A:	And do education at same time . 
*PS01F:	I 'm not sure but I think I do n't got my family allowance until I were eighteen I think I think they used to give us . 
*PS01B:	let me keep our Karen 's . 
*PS01F:	Oh . 
*PS01B:	So I 've got a form to fill in actually It should have gone back last week and I . 
*PS01F:	It 'll all stop when she gets her grant through .

*PS01A:	Off the grant . 
*PS01B:	off the grant so that actually they get six weeks money less through the year than they should do where they 're used to paying all through year . 
*PS01A:	For twelve months now they do n't . 
*PS01B:	Now they do n't get anything for that six weeks that they 're not at school .

*PS01B:	Yeah . 
*PS01A:	The only way you can start a business is by starting it without insurance . 
*PS01B:	0 . 
*PS01A:	straight off your own back and then you know after it 's running get insurance . 
*PS01F:	Yeah .
