*UNK:	Are we taking them books back? •_•
*EVE:	Only when you're  ready or, they're not due back yet. •_•
*ART:	Only I can't get a chance to  study in the meantime. •_•
*EVE:	Course you can! •_•
        Drink up! •_•
*ART:	By the way, the cod liver oil's finished. •_•
*EVE:	Finished? •_•
*ART:	Just drank the last, er, there might be a  shade  •_•
*EVE:	Mm mm! •_•
*ART:	in. •_•
*EVE:	I didn't think you'd had much of it. •_•
*ART:	Mm. •_•
*EVE:	That'll take the taste of it off, if you keep drinking that. •_•
        What book's that? •_•
*ART:	Machine and power tools, how to use them. •_•
*EVE:	Is that the one you had out before? •_•
*ART:	Ah? •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*EVE:	Is it? •_•

*EVE:	I, I know  •_•
*ART:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	you had that one but I thought I've seen  , a similar one the other week. •_•
*ART:	They're all much alike. •_•
*EVE:	Oh it's not the same one? •_•
*ART:	I get that one . •_•
*EVE:	Anyway, what  what do you want with those now? •_•
*ART:	Leave it for the beneficiaries. •_•
*EVE:	At your age. •_•
        Have you seen all the seagulls? •_•
*ART:	Yeah. •_•
        I've seen them before. •_•
*EVE:	Well they're all circling over the roof. •_•
        Ah, I don't know what they have to eat. •_•
*ART:	Well it's •_•
*EVE:	 (        ) 
*ART:	dove dirt I think. •_•
*EVE:	You look! •_•
*ART:	Well , the only thing I, when I walk across the green, the only thing I see is dove dirt. •_•
        It might be  •_•
*EVE:	Mm! •_•
*ART:	perhaps it's Kitty Cat  twice removed! •_•
*EVE:	You have a look at them! •_•
        Look at them! •_•
*ART:	Mm. •_•
        I can see them through the reflection. •_•
*EVE:	Dunno why they're circling round there. •_•
*ART:	If I see one drop  they they circle and if one drops they go down too. •_•
*EVE:	They'll be on our lawn next! •_•
*ART:	Lovely machines they got out now! •_•
        Look, that's a planer. •_•
*EVE:	Mm. •_•
*ART:	French . •_•
*EVE:	Well they're not for amateurs are they? •_•
*ART:	No, but I mean they do it the easy way the  •_•
*EVE:	Oh yeah! •_•
*ART:	professionals. •_•
        They don't do it the hard way. •_•
*EVE:	I like the tonic water  as good as , ah, with the Martini! •_•
        What do you think? •_•
        Do you think it's better than lemonade? •_•
*ART:	Well it's nice! •_•
*EVE:	Tonic? •_•
*ART:	Very nice! •_•
        I like it! •_•
*EVE:	I can't stand the sweet  saccharin in the lemonade! •_•
        Somebody's thumping! •_•
*ART:	Mm. •_•
*EVE:	Can you hear them? •_•
*ART:	Breaking bits of concrete. •_•
*EVE:	Dunno. •_•
        Perhaps they're putting the  the fence back in. •_•
        It blew down in the gale! •_•
        Sounds a bit like that. •_•
*ART:	You know that  wheel on, last made with a band of emery on •_•
*EVE:	Mm. •_•
*ART:	around the things  look, you see  if you're doing a curve  he's got electric drill with a round bobbin in , but mine's on a shaft, the bit, for when   and also, there's my sander disc. •_•
*EVE:	Mm. •_•
*ART:	Supposed to push that up to it  and , your dead square and clean. •_•
        Well when you saw it without that  after you've sawn it you've gotta  •_•
*EVE:	Gotta  •_•
*ART:	square it off and file it and  that does it in seconds! •_•
        So you just put it on your  in that steel table I made •_•
*EVE:	Mm. •_•
*ART:	push it straight through it till it's done. •_•
*EVE:	You'll have to try to do it. •_•
*ART:	And er •_•
*EVE:	Well, I think I'll go and put the potatoes on. •_•
*ART:	I suppose you should  you , push it with a stick  by the saw so you don't get your fingers in. •_•
*EVE:	Mm. •_•
        Right! •_•
