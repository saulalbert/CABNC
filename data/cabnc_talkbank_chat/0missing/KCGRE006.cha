*KCGPSUG:	0 . 
*PS19R:	no wait a minute . 
*PS19L:	of course he got all upset so she had to then mess about and try and get him to sleep which apparently she did . 
*PS19R:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	but he must of been all worked up and since then I 've had a right struggle most nights . 
*PS19R:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	I 've had to go back up in to him yeah but I do n't know what happened last night I do n't know whether he was not quite tired enough erm he must of got up as soon as I put him down and started sort of moaning then I went into the girls and I sorted them out he started screaming he did so I had to go to him in and lay him down and making him lay down . 
*PS19R:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	and he was starting sobbing and he got that upset in the end . 
*PS19R:	He started screaming . 
*PS19L:	you know real I 've never heard him do that before . 
*PS19S:	Aye they can do that sobbing . 
*PS19R:	No . 
*PS19L:	So erm anyway I went back in to him I kept going up and down I left him for a while but he does n't normally cry like that . 
*PS19R:	No . 
*PS19L:	so er . 
*PS19R:	Ee ee . 
*PS19L:	eventually I went up and I tried to get him to go down to sleep again and he was shutting his eyes and on his dummy but he was . 
*PS19R:	If they get that worked up they ca n't calm down can they . 
*PS19L:	No . 
*PS19S:	No . 
*PS19L:	so I thought I could n't I could n't let him go to .

*PS19L:	sleep while he was like that so I picked him up and took him back downstairs again . 
*PS19R:	0 . 
*PS19S:	He knows he 's doing this thing . 
*PS19P:	Is it do you think it might be as well that it 's a bit lighter Jane cos I was reading a smashing tip . 
*PS19S:	Oh yeah . 
*PS19P:	in one of me magazines to blacken your curtains out cos I thought I 'm gon na do that on Joanne 's . 
*PS19L:	Yeah I do n't . 
*PS19P:	you know she moans somebody suggested if you 've got a curtain and you 've got like you a liner behind it . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	to fasten a black bin bag . 
*PS19L:	Oh yeah yeah . 
*PS19P:	between the curtain and the liner . 
*PS19L:	Yeah I put a over his . 
*PS19P:	and it completely blacks over it was dark . 
*PS19L:	when it was dark . 
*PS19P:	but no you know it does start getting lighter and you 're gon na have problems then you might try that cos you could you 've got liners on them curtains have n't ya . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	Open up er er a a bin liner and pin it in between the two . 
*PS19L:	In between the two .

*PS19P:	so it 's completely black . 
*PS19L:	Blacks it out .

*KCGPSUG:	0 . 
*PS19P:	eh Jane do you know what Mike rang the solicitor up yesterday and he said that he was sending out the contracts to us . 
*PS19L:	Yes . 
*PS19P:	that he just received them like about half an hour before Mike rang up so he said I 've got to get me secretary to type them out and then we I 'll send them to you and we 've got to sign 'em then what happens from there . 
*PS19L:	Once you 've signed the contracts . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	You 've got to have a witness have n't you sign it in front of somebody Is that the one no . 
*PS19P:	I do n't think . 
*PS19L:	Send it back and it should be pretty soon after that is n't it . 
*PS19P:	Well he said Mike must have said what has been holding it up if I we were under the impression that when she left London she was finished with her property . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	cos it was put in the hands of Black Horse by Miss . 
*PS19L:	That 's right . 
*PS19P:	and they were dealing with it . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	well seemingly it must be as simple as that . 
*PS19L:	No . 
*PS19P:	so she 's been dealing with her Manchester solicitors and a London solicitor . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	so this is what 's been holding everything up . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	So Mike must said to him well the thing is well we wanted to really get in before Easter . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	so he said you do n't have to move on a Friday cos Mike said well do we have to move Friday So he said oh no you can choose any day of the week . 
*PS19L:	That 's right yeah . 
*PS19P:	I suppose it 's mutual agreement . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	I mean we 'll move any day but it 's whether Miss will you see . 
*PS19L:	Yeah the only reason most people choose a Friday is because they get you over the weekend . 
*PS19P:	They get you over the weekend yeah so erm we 'll just have to see what happens and have just have the contracts out . 
*PS19L:	Yeah it should be a week then should n't it . 
*PS19P:	Hopefully er what did you say five working days . 
*PS19L:	It 's normally five working days yeah . 
*PS19P:	Mm mm you see cos even if we sort of made it for like the middle of next week er no not next week the week after . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	would bring us like the Wednesday that would be my birthday actually the Wednesday . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	but it 'll make it Easter weekend . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	we 'll we would n't mind I would n't mind doing that . 
*PS19L:	No . 
*PS19P:	because it 'd give Mike an extra few days anyway could actually have . 
*PS19L:	Get settled . 
*PS19P:	the Wednesday off and all the following week . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	which would give him a good break really to get a few things done . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19R:	Well it 'll all be . 
*PS19P:	I 'm not doing any I 'm I 'm all this bloody panicking about getting a flaming gas fire sorted out and getting a carpet done I 'm not not bothering we 'll just have to rough it for a while . 
*PS19L:	Let 'em rough it for a week . 
*PS19P:	Mm we 'll rough it for a while because I know the downers the only thing that Mike wants to do is put the fence and the gate up the side . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	which Don said we could do . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	to sort the dog out really . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	but everything else we can sort getting there it 's not as if we 're gon na need a bloody fire is it Jane . 
*PS19L:	Not really . 
*PS19P:	I mean do you find you you use your fire more . 
*PS19L:	We have been doing over the past few nights . 
*PS19P:	Have ya . 
*PS19L:	because I 've been turning the heating it 's the . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	I do n't know from tea time it seems to warm up the house . 
*PS19P:	Mm . 
*PS19L:	and it 's boiling hot . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	from sort of eight o'clock so I could . 
*PS19P:	Then it cools off . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	do n't it . 
*PS19L:	So I just put it on just to tick . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	the room over really but I mean if you can keep your heating on for that little bit of length of time . 
*PS19P:	Mm that 's what I 'll do I do n't think we 'll use the fire that much I mean we I did I put it on No I did n't put it on last night but I did leave me heating on it clicks off at nine o'clock but the house was warm . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	and we went to bed anyway . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	just gone ten . 
*PS19L:	That 's what I mean we used to turn ours off of about nine half nine and like you say it just used to tick . 
*PS19P:	Mm . 
*PS19L:	over till about eleven you could just feel it cooling down . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	but because I 've been knocking it off that bit earlier . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	sort of five minutes . 
*PS19P:	And how have you fi I think we 're gon na end up like with a fire like yours to be honest because we do n't want to alter that fireplace if we can help it . 
*PS19L:	No it 's ever so nice . 
*PS19P:	because we do like it . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	and we thought well one night I mean it 's a bloody big radiator in that room . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	which I think would be enough . 
*PS19L:	You would n't you 'd probably find that you would use it half a dozen times through the year . 
*PS19P:	Yeah yeah . 
*PS19L:	No I wo n't get rid of mine . 
*PS19P:	Have you sort of not I suppose you have n't found out money- wise what it 's costing ya . 
*PS19L:	No not really I should imagine it 's not I do n't know you see we do n't we 'd of had the heating on anyway . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	so I do n't suppose it 's cost us any more . 
*PS19P:	No . 
*PS19L:	because we 've hardly had it on . 
*PS19P:	Mm . 
*PS19R:	Still you . 
*PS19P:	You do find it warm do n't ya . 
*PS19L:	I do yeah . 
*PS19P:	Have you got a couple of settings on yours is it a high and a low . 
*PS19L:	Well I 've just got high and low that 's all . 
*PS19P:	But I mean it 'll give you er a wattage er whatever it is . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	it pumps out anyway . 
*PS19L:	well I suppose so I do n't know what we 've got . 
*PS19R:	The . 
*KCGPSUG:	0 . 
*PS19P:	yeah because as I say something like what Jane 's got would fit in that fireplace just right . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19R:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	which like I say saw one up at erm I told you that fireplace shop on the corner mind you I think we 'll get Edwards in he had some in about a hundred and sixty quid or so . 
*PS19L:	You should start looking round . 
*KCGPSUG:	0 . 
*PS19P:	erm I mean really ideally Mike would like one of those that actually fits perfectly . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	in in the fireplace . 
*PS19L:	I know what you mean . 
*PS19P:	and it 's got a back to it . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	and it sort of throws the heat out into the room . 
*PS19L:	Yeah yeah . 
*PS19P:	Well I could it could it would n't justify it . 
*PS19L:	But Chris I ca n't see them I ca n't see them making a fire like that that your heat 's gon na go all up the chimney no way . 
*PS19P:	No but what I 'm saying is . 
*PS19L:	Josh come on . 
*PS19P:	if there was n't . 
*PS19L:	come on Josh Josh . 
*PS19P:	if there was n't a good amount of radiator in that room . 
*PS19L:	Josh . 
*PS19P:	it would justify having a fire like that . 
*PS19R:	Come on . 
*PS19L:	Yeah yeah . 
*PS19P:	but because it 's got such a good . 
*PS19R:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	Radiator . 
*PS19P:	you know cos I told you Mike actually fancies one of these that actually fits right in the fireplace . 
*PS19L:	I know what you mean next door . 
*PS19P:	and there 's a backing to it and it pumps it out into the room they 're dead hot . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	but I do n't think this room needs it Jane . 
*PS19R:	No . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	I think it 'll be a waste and I do n't want to go to the expense of . 
*PS19L:	Well they are bloody expensive . 
*PS19P:	because . 
*PS19R:	It slipped . 
*PS19P:	I think the fires are about three hundred quid . 
*PS19L:	Mm . 
*PS19P:	but it 's not that you 'd have to have a lot of the fireplace ripped up . 
*PS19L:	Mm you would . 
*PS19P:	Yeah . 
*PS19L:	it 's only a little square . 
*PS19P:	Yeah we 'd have to have the pillars taken off . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	and everything like that so all that would have to be redecorated . 
*PS19L:	Whereas like that one of ours it 'd be ideal would n't it . 
*PS19P:	It be it just work right . 
*PS19L:	Must have your chimney swept . 
*PS19P:	That 's what I want to get that number off you for that as well because I some would suggest anyway . 
*PS19L:	I got it somewhere yeah . 
*PS19P:	would n't he . 
*PS19L:	I got it somewhere I 'll root it out for ya and I forgot to see Hilda about that . 
*PS19R:	Michael shout Mike . 
*PS19P:	There 's no rush for it . 
*PS19R:	Michael shout louder .

*PS19L:	Funny enough I saw her yesterday . 
*PS19R:	in a minute or two . 
*KCGPSUG:	0 . 
*PS19L:	and she started talking about putting the freezer in the back garden . 
*PS19T:	Is it worth my taking a coat on . 
*PS19L:	and that . 
*PS19P:	Oh .

*PS19P:	sort it all out .

*PS19R:	shout Chris . 
*PS19P:	Hopefully we can get away with that room Jane with just maybe having to emulsion it . 
*PS19L:	Yeah . 
*PS19P:	because I mean once you 've taken all the pictures down I think it did need it . 
*PS19L:	She 's a smoker int she That 's . 
*PS19P:	very much . 
*PS19L:	Yeah that 'll be your main thing then . 
*PS19P:	Rather than decorate I think we 'll just . 
*PS19L:	Paint it . 
*PS19P:	er emulsion over it and maybe put a border around the picture frames . 
*PS19L:	This is in the back room . 
*PS19P:	Front room .
