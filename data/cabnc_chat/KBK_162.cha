*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	You, you take up the normal   (        ) I don't tend to do this, but this is really the best way to do the shot.
*CHR:	Yes.
*DAV:	Take up your normal start and then just tap the back a little bit cos you're hitting that ball on the upward swing then and there's no danger that you're gonna jump over it.See if you'll try and get it to jump if you   ((hits ball)) (        ) .

*DAV:	Erm, bumpy lawns, jump that over ball.
*CHR:	Right.So step back and hit   (.) hit it on the up stroke.
*DAV:	Yeah, and try and ground the mallet a little bit, cos then the black ball will go quite nicely down there.
*CHR:	Oh right, fine.
