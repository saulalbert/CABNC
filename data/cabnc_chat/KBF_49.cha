*BRE:	That's not very elegant, the milk on  but never mind. •_•
*JEA:	I don't think that elegance is the main thing in my mind at the moment. •_•
*BRE:	Oh it's really cold out there. •_•
*JEA:	We need it. •_•
*BRE:	Take your book out there Jean. •_•
*JEA:	Yes I shall. •_•
*BRE:	Carla. •_•
        Breakfast . •_•
        We'll have eaten it all by the time you get in here. •_•
        I've put the kettle on and then we'll have  another cup of tea in a minute. •_•
        Oh it's nice to get cool isn't it? •_•
*JEA:	Isn't it? •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BRE:	These were the things. •_•
        I don't know if you've tried them. •_•
*JEA:	Oh. •_•
        No I haven't. •_•
*BRE:	And then with my  tongue the way it is. •_•
        They're the only ones that I can have. •_•
        they've got. •_•
        Try one. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	And then they've got like iron and •_•
*JEA:	Nice. •_•
*BRE:	It's got , it's got the recommended daily amount of vitamins in it. •_•
*JEA:	Oh. •_•
*BRE:	And the recommended daily amount of iron in it. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	That's what I mean with that Jean you probably won't need   vitamins . •_•
*JEA:	No you see I don't think normally people do. •_•
        But they do say as you grow older yes. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	Cos your body isn't so efficient at processing the food you take in. •_•
        No but I might, I won't  •_•
*BRE:	No but   •_•
*JEA:	keep it up for ever more. •_•
        But I thought I might have a  a course of it. •_•
        A month's vitamins perhaps. •_•
        Just to  top, make sure I'm topped up. •_•
        But this is a good idea. •_•
*BRE:	What's that? •_•
*JEA:	These, these flakes. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah because there's a lot, I mean cereals have got a lot of vitamins and iron in ain't they? •_•
*JEA:	Well they're they're made  that way aren't they? •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	They put them in. •_•
*BRE:	Ain't it funny this time of year, the garden always looks bare and scruffy and  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Got all cuttings in the bowls down there I took. •_•
        I don't know if, I mean one's not surviving, I don't know if the others are gonna survive. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	At people's houses I've taken cuttings of and •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Cos Jenny is marvellous she, I mean  next door she er  she very rarely buys. •_•
        She takes cuttings from everything she's got and •_•
*JEA:	Does she? •_•
*BRE:	Mm and grows sort of everything in the garden. •_•

*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Christmas lights. •_•

*BRE:	Cos it's such er a light room. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	The only thing is with that radiator it still, it does get very cold in here. •_•

*JEA:	And you haven't got a radiator in here of course? •_•

        Some years ago in, in New York I think it was  the stores were taking on father Christmases. •_•
        And they felt they were being exploited. •_•
        You know they were only being taken on for a couple of months and  they, they wanted to form a trade union but quite a lot of the er father Christmases wouldn't join a trade union. •_•
        And eleven of them  got involved in a fist fight in the middle of one of those  New York streets . •_•

*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	I mean the fact  and it, that it was, half of it was so true. •_•

*JEA:	Some of it was. •_•
*BRE:	she went into the  the store. •_•
*JEA:	That was perfect. •_•

*JEA:	It irritated me a bit because  what it  what it was saying  •_•
*CAR:	dirty but   •_•
*JEA:	what it, what it was saying was  in effect that the woman  er so long as she's free and and open sexually then she can have whatever she wants. •_•
        And of course A this is true  •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	and we don't like it. •_•
        And B it isn't actually true at all because most, most men would simply exploit that in the situation she was in. •_•
*BRE:	I say they wouldn't sort of spend like he did. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        No. •_•
*BRE:	But I, I like you say I mean half of me  •_•
