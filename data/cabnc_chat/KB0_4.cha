*ALA:	Oh yeah, aha
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	how long ago, I mean how long has it been there?
*BOB:	Erm, nearly twelve years I think now, no must, must be more than that
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*BOB:	ah, have to get a pair of scissors  (.) 
*ALA:	What brought you to this part when you, went back to
*BOB:	Well largely because we couldn't afford a house in the area where we both grew up
*ALA:	Where was that?
*BOB:	The south east London
*ALA:	Oh yeah, oh right
*BOB:	At least I was born in Kent but er brought up in south east London
*ALA:	Oh yeah, where the, whereabouts?
*BOB:	Erm, born in Welling and er and then, then we moved to Lewisham
*ALA:	Mm, mm  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	erm, that was immediately after the war, you know, the first war
*ALA:	Right   (.) did your erm wife come from the same area?
*BOB:	Well, in a way, although her parents were Scotch
*ALA:	Oh  (.) 
*BOB:	her mother's family from St Andrews and her father from Dundee
*ALA:	Oh   (.) but they moved out of London long before  (.) 
*BOB:	Erm, oh he came to London to get work
*ALA:	Yeah
*BOB:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALA:	Yeah  (.) 
*BOB:	And what made you choose this particular part of
*ALA:	Well one, one of my sons is married to er,gir , girl whose family live in Buckley
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	Oh, oh 
*ALA:	and er   (.) originally when, when we first sought to retiring, retiring, we were attracted to the Dales, but we couldn't afford that
*BOB:	No   (.) no this is the great problem of er   (.) at the moment, oh it was C W M when you retired wasn't it?
*ALA:	Mm
*BOB:	And erm   (.) and did they, had they got their nanny form of assistance?
*ALA:	They had but it was erm, much less satisfactory as a U R C one
*BOB:	Mm
*ALA:	but they've changed now, they're more or less on the same basis as the U R C
*BOB:	Oh
*ALA:	but erm   (.) it didn't look a very attractive proposition at the time
*BOB:	Oh
*ALA:	for one thing, if we'd taken one of their houses and I'd died first, my wife would of been left without a home
*BOB:	Oh dear
*ALA:	except for going to the er, you know, they've got that place in Worthing erm 
*BOB:	Yeah 
*ALA:	erm
*BOB:	Yeah
*ALA:	Levers House
*BOB:	Yeah

*BOB:	No not really, no   (.) Could you of chosen   (.) erm   (.) where to have the house or did they have some, that had been left for that purpose?
*ALA:	Erm, I'm not really sure, we didn't go into it very deeply
*BOB:	No
*ALA:	Fortunately Ruth had some money from her father which covered buying this house
*BOB:	Oh, oh  (.) 
*ALA:	erm   (.) At that time property was fairly cheap in Bradley
*BOB:	Mm, mm
*ALA:	we got this for seven and a half thousand
*BOB:	Oh, blimey, mm
*ALA:	I think it cost more than that now
*BOB:	Oh I think so, yeah   (.) you wouldn't purchase the land that it stands on for that now  (.) 
*ALA:	Mind you it's only a paper profit because you can't rely on it
*BOB:	No, no   (.) Where are you from originally ah?
*ALA:	London, east London, East Ham   (.) actually I was brought up till I was about seven   (.) er in the same area, but erm   (.) in a place called Beckton
*BOB:	Oh that's where the gas works used to be.
*ALA:	That's right, yeah, just over, not far over the water from er the Woolwich 
*BOB:	That's right , no, yes, I know not far from where we live really
*ALA:	Mm, mm   (.) and I often tell people that er, those who don't come from London don't realise   (.) the difference between north and south
*BOB:	Mm
*ALA:	south London they're two different worlds aren't they?In a way
*BOB:	Yes
*ALA:	for the people who live there they are, anyway   (.) the river's a great divide
*BOB:	Oh yeah   (.) Yes, it's amazing how a big delight it is, despite all the bridges
*ALA:	Oh that's right, mm   (.) You didn't go straight from college overseas
*BOB:	Well, as near as possible because, erm, I mean I was appointed to, to Africa while I was still in college

*ALA:	set up, which started at Adams and we used the American mission near Lovedale well it was a part of Lovedale and erm, now, now it's at er, they call it The Federal Theological Cemetery
*BOB:	Oh yeah

*ALA:	then it gradually reduced to two, right at the end we were getting
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	every two years
*BOB:	Yes, that's right, yeah
*ALA:	but that didn't happen very often to us because it was just being introduced 
*BOB:	That's right , yeah, yeah   (.) Yes our first tour was five, it was supposed to be four, but, we erm, er for some reason or other we didn't really want to come home, ha four, so we stretched to three
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	well we had one more tour after that, erm, but the   (.) and would really of referred to of stayed, made the next tour longer than two
*ALA:	Mm
*BOB:	but er, rules are rules aren't they? [laughing] It seems   [] I, oh I seemed to feel that it, it was, if we wanted to see three it was gonna upset, well they seemed that, I thought it would save money if they
*ALA:	Mm
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	but we stayed home then, yeah   (.) I'm not quite sure where you did go
*ALA:	Zambia
*BOB:	Ah
*ALA:	I had been into Zambia, but not very often  (.) 
*BOB:	Oh
*ALA:	In fact when I was stationed in Mule I used to travel through Zambia to get to one of my out stations
*BOB:	Oh did you?
*ALA:	simply because the roads were better that side, when it was Northern Rhodesia
*BOB:	You crossed on the pontoon did you?
*ALA:	Yes
*BOB:	And then came back over the bridge?
*ALA:	O , over the falls bridge
*BOB:	Oh we did that a few times when the, the borders were closed with
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	came across pontoon through, of course it's a much more e , elaborate pontoon now then it was then
*ALA:	I'm sure
*BOB:	that was er
*ALA:	oh it wasn't very elaborate
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	well you could get one, one and a half ton truck on it   (.) and it was driven across with a couple of
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	engines
*ALA:	I can't remember of it
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	the others with a, the engine midway
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*BOB:	I know they did put in er a, a much better ferry they 
*ALA:	Oh yeah , yeah
*BOB:	and then of course the Americans paid for that road up to 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	mm, that's right, yeah
*BOB:	but er, which really was a waste of money it was, well it's used a bit for tourism now
*ALA:	Mm, mm 
*BOB:	but it's , but commercially it was of no importance
*ALA:	No  (.) 
*BOB:	but it was er part of the sanctions policy against Rhodesia
*ALA:	Yeah that's right  (.) 
*BOB:	Where were you in, in Zambia?
*ALA:	Erm, I was, we was all the time we were there, in er
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	Ah
*ALA:	the theological college
*BOB:	Mm
*ALA:	er, the only time I really went any distance was er, well, I went with er Paul  to  (        ) 
*BOB:	Oh yeah
*ALA:	it was er, at a time when this an African district committee sent representatives to the central and visa versa
*BOB:	Oh, oh  (.) 
*ALA:	Mm  (.) 
*BOB:	That must of been some time ago
*ALA:	Yes
*BOB:	Nineteen fifty something I think  (.) 
*ALA:	erm, of course the economic out in Zambia the economic situations is disastrous now  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	and the drought of course has made it worse
*ALA:	Pardon?
*BOB:	The drought 
*ALA:	The drought yeah, yeah   (.) just now the drought seems to be much more widespread now doesn't it and er into South Africa
*BOB:	Well I was looking at the er
*ALA:	Very bad
*BOB:	erm  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	and they were saying that er, South Africa's going to have to import food this year 
*ALA:	That's right, yeah 
*BOB:	normally, South Africa feeds these other countries north, further south in, in bad years
*ALA:	Mm, mm.
*BOB:	Yes South Africa has erm, er, er, we have a regular erm A four sheet two, two sides of A four sheet, erm it was weekly, but it's erm a fortnightly
*ALA:	Mm
*BOB:	newsletter
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	now it's just a news sheet from, of Zambia
*ALA:	Mm
*BOB:	er, it's pretty youthful this country with it's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BOB:	Zambian er, call it Zambian newspa , newspapers so it's very liable as to what, you know it's no comm , it's not comment at all, it's just, and erm the last one two weeks ago I think it was, indicated that erm South Africa's production of maize would be, oh I can't remember, but a lot short of what they require themselves 
*ALA:	Yeah, oh, it's down to about a quarter of normal it is 
*BOB:	A quarter is it?As low as that.
*ALA:	Because there are worries that it's going to er, effect the outcome of this mad ref , referendum, you know they the farmers are sort of desperate and they think they need government help and they think they wouldn't get it because of the black government   (.) so
*BOB:	But erm, Botswana's erm, doing quite well
*ALA:	Oh yes, well you see they've got the names
*BOB:	Yes that's right, but erm, unfortunately Zambia's the copper, has had the copper and
*ALA:	Mm
*BOB:	the copper
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	erm   (.) and of course, er, normal years they also earn quite a lot from exporting their cat
