*TON:	Yes, one or two.
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Yeah.Erm   (.) Oh I was just trying to remember what, what was said. (.) Something to do with   (.) Ah Jerry said something quite good about   (.) availability.Erm   (.) like you can't   (.) although peop people will go for jobs, now produce proof of jobs they've applied for.You can't tell whether they really want the jobs or not.
*MAR:	Yeah.
*TON:	And and it is 
*MAR:	So they're actually seeking   (        ) then?
*TON:	Yeah. (.) 
*MAR:	Well I suppose not really.

*TON:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	And   (.) and the thing is I didn't understand it.So it's quite difficult to remember exactly what she said.
*TON:	Mm. (.) 
*TON:	Erm   (.) something to do with   (.) no.I can't think.Trouble is when you don't understand it it doesn't sink in.
*TON:	No that's right.
*TON:	But everybody sort of.I remembered   (        )  ((laugh)) 
*TON:	 (        ) 
*TON:	 (        ) 
*TON:	Have you?
*TON:	Yeah.It's a bit like a single office group. (        ) sitting in and we're trying to split them up cos we don't want too   (        )  ((lot of background noise))
*TON:	Yeah.
*TON:	Which, which they did.But they've gone back now to sitting altogether.So.
