*ADR:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	Right okay. •_•
        So B six. •_•
        Er,one to mark here. •_•
*ADR:	Yep. •_•
        This one. •_•
*TER:	Well, I think perhaps  what we'll do cos you've missed quite a few of these out so I think what we'll do  erm is to  leave that  what you're doing there for a moment  we'll go through this  mark this  and the one's you haven't done we'll do  so that you've got this one straight. •_•
        Okay? •_•
*ADR:	Okay. •_•
        There's only one I didn't do. •_•
        That one. •_•
*TER:	Oh yes! •_•
        So there is. •_•
        Well, well anyway we'll do do that and see  see what the other's like. •_•
        You've been caught! •_•
        Right! •_•
        This one  posts are erected at a hundred metre intervals on a motorway, how many posts are there in a distance of four thousand seven hundred kilometres? •_•
*ADR:	Twenty seven. •_•
*TER:	No. •_•
        As I say, you have been caught  in a little trap! •_•
        Posts are erected •_•
*ADR:	Forty six posts. •_•
*TER:	posts are erected every hundred metres, right? •_•
*ADR:	Mm. •_•
*TER:	There's a hundred metres  there's two hundred metres  there's three hundred metres  how many posts in three hundred metres? •_•
*ADR:	Four. •_•
        Sorry! •_•
*TER:	Mm. •_•
*ADR:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	Right. •_•
        Because at no metres there's one post  and at the end of a hundred metres you've got  two posts  so you got one post more •_•
*ADR:	So it must be forty six. •_•
*TER:	distance. •_•
*ADR:	That's what I say, forty eight. •_•
*TER:	Forty eight  right! •_•
        Got it? •_•
        Always  •_•
*ADR:	Okay. •_•
*TER:	be wary of that. •_•
        And the same thing applies  posts are a hundred metres apart. •_•
*ADR:	Mm. •_•
*TER:	If you are at the fifth post  how far have you gone from the start? •_•
*ADR:	Six hundred metres. •_•
*TER:	How far have you gone from the start? •_•
*ADR:	Four hundred. •_•
*TER:	Right! •_•
        Fifth post, one, two, three, four, five  the fifth post  you have gone four hundred metres. •_•
*ADR:	Oh. •_•
*TER:	So  wherever you get that sort of question  just stop and think •_•
*ADR:	Okay. •_•
*TER:	because it's either one more or it's one less. •_•
        The only  time  that that doesn't apply  is if you are thinking in terms of posts in a fence around a square field or round a circular field. •_•
*ADR:	Okay. •_•
*TER:	Because now  after one hundred metres you've got two posts  after two hundred metres you've got three posts, after three hundred metres you got four posts, after four hundred metres you've got five posts  but after you've five hundred metres you've only got five posts cos that one doubles up. •_•
*ADR:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	So you got one, two, three, four, five spaces and you got one, two, three, four, five, posts •_•
*ADR:	Mhm. •_•
*TER:	but on a straight line  your  •_•
*ADR:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	spaces are one less than the number of posts. •_•
        Alright? •_•
*ADR:	Okay. •_•
*TER:	So  just remember that. •_•
        That's why I said you have been caught! •_•
        That's a , one of those little trap questions. •_•
*ADR:	Yeah. •_•
*TER:	Now this one, four hedges together have a mass of two hundred grams  how many have a mass of two and ? •_•
