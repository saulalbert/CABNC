*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	said well something like that. ((laugh)) .
*STU:	Yeah but probably now they'd call it hyperactivity.
*ANN:	Probably. (.) I don't think he was, he was just   (.) I dunno  (        ) 
*STU:	A lad.
*ANN:	Yeah.And I I er and not only that I used to say to teachers well if   (.) if they'd ask him about and if he had   (.) anything er er and he'd be bored.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	 (        ) why do you   (        ) Jonathan,St Steven said oh he'd been in detention.Why have you been in detention? (.) Oh I was playing up and they chucked me out the class or something and I had to stay in at dinner time.Said well why were you playing up?I was bored.
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	I tried telling some of the teachers that.He finds the lessons boring   (.) so obviously they're gonna mess about.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	If they're bor if you're bored and you can't 
*STU:	Bored yeah.
*ANN:	So you, you get distracted and do something else
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	you shouldn't be doing.And that's a fault in some ways of the teachers.
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	If the pupils are bored the   (.) should make it interesting enough to keep their interest.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Mm.Yeah I know   (        ) subjects they're not   (.) you can't be interested in all of them.
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	Look at them cars. ((cough)) 
*STU:	When I was at the garage   (.) getting the petrol   (.) I give them, signed the cheque and they put the cheque through the   (.) cheque machine printing it out and that   (.) and er   (.) they've got a free offer at the moment.You collect these tokens for   (.) collect so many tokens and you get   (.) a free Corgi toy. (.) I mean normally I don't bother with the tokens, I mean I   (.) Anyway I paid the cheque   (.) and I said to Peter I said   (.) oh by the way what about me   (.) tokens for me   (.) for me toy I said   (.) if I get a free one of them I can give it to   (.) give it to the grandchildren.See, Ricky'd like that I'm sure, little Corgi car I said  (        ) .He said oh no you don't get them with cheques.Cash sales only. (.)  (        ) I thought   (.) I just spent twenty seven quid on petrol   (        ) I said   (        ) 
*ANN:	And you can't even have a bloody free Dinky car.
*STU:	free couple of vouchers for a new   (.) for a Corgi toy. (.) There's a woman in there she said oh give it to him.I said   (        ) give you a cuddle some time.
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	I just thought you know I    (.)  (        ) okay it's only a cheque I know but
*ANN:	Yeah but it's still twenty seven quid.They don't get many twenty seven pound customers.
*STU:	No.That's what I thought.
*ANN:	Fiver or what have you.
*STU:	I think it's I think it's one voucher for fifteen litres. (.) Now what do I have?If I had twenty seven quid's worth   (.) at fifty P a litre   (.) that's   (.) fifty two   (.) fifty two?Fifty two litres   (        ) roughly   (        ) so if it was one voucher for fifteen that's   (.) three innit?
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	And I think it was six vouchers for for a free
*ANN:	That's it.
*STU:	free Corgi toy.So all I've got to do is when I run out again fill it up again spending another twenty five quid's worth or so   (.) that would have been six and I could have had a free Corgi toy for   (.) Ricky for Christmas.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Or   (.) whatever. (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Little present innit?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Hasn't cost me nothing has it?Or hasn't cost you anything.
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	But next time I shall have to run, take the cash in there. (.) And see   (.) see what they say next time.
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	 (        ) pays a cheque it was just easier to pay by cheque.And they've got a machine to do it anyway to   (.) work it all out, print it all out.
*ANN:	Not very fair is it?
*STU:	Oh no.
*ANN:	Saying cash I mean it's still cash   (.) innit? (.) 
*STU:	Would have thought so. (.) 
*ANN:	 (        ) big business that.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Toys. (.) Terrible prices. (.) 
*STU:	Bet mum's still got that  (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh I don't know.
*STU:	You want to ask her about that.
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	You could see if anyone's got one at work couldn't you?
*ANN:	Yeah. (.)  ((laugh))  (        ) 
*STU:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*ANN:	Oh well   (.) I'd better go and do the dishes I think.
*STU:	 (        ) say there's not that many there is there?Only a plate and a few fork, fork and a knife and that.She's done everything else.
*ANN:	I must do them now and then it's out of the way cos you   (        ) and I want to see Emmerdale at seven.
