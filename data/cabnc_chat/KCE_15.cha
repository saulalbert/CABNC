*EMM:	Yeah but it depends whose hair it is.
*AND:	having to look stupid   (        ) drop out and look okay   (        ) 
*AND:	Here you are And this is a good one   (.) diskette fire   (.) you   (        ) computer   (        ) you need a disk, some scissors, white or blue kitchen matches so   (        ) and clear nail polish.The reason they've gotta be those colours is erm   (        ) and clear nail polish.Carefully open up the diskette three point five inches for the best effect and it's like my Amiga one   (.) remove the top covering from the inside, scrape a lot of match powder into a bowl   (        ) match powder.After you have a lot, spread it evenly on the inside disk.Using nail polish spread it over the match   (        ) mixture, let it dry, carefully put diskette back together   (        ) nail polish to seal it, do it on the inside where it came apart.When that disk is in a drive the drive head   (        ) to read the disk which causes a small fire   (.) inside   (        ) disk drive   (        ) ha ha ha ha, let the fuckhead try and fix that.

*JOA:	Then I grew it out
*EMM:	 (        ) 
*JOA:	then I grew it out and then it was all brittle still so I had it cut.And now I'm growing it.I shall grow it down into a bob and have it a bit long steppy bit at the back   (.) and keep growing it.
