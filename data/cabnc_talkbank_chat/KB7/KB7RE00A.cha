*PS02G:	And you knew what he was on about .  1329042_1330442
*PS02H:	they quote this unit linked business Now it 's all .  1330612_1334032
*PS02G:	And you did n't want that did you .  1334032_1335292
*PS02H:	well and good a unit linked policy but as I said to you before that if they if the market crashes the day before your policy is due out you .  1335292_1344102

*PS02G:	0 . 
*PS02H:	If the market crashes the day before you take your policy 's due to mature wallop You can lose a lot of money in a you know just like that .  1348302_1357622
*PS02G:	But do you think this thing what he was on about pension mortgage do you think that would be better Was that that pep thing what 's all in the papers at the moment .  1357622_1366812
*PS02H:	No .  1366812_1366872
*PS02G:	Is that what it means .  1366872_1367702
*PS02H:	pep 's different .  1367702_1368412
*PS02G:	Oh Is it similar .  1368782_1369972
*PS02H:	pep 's a personal equity plan .  1369972_1371552
*PS02G:	Oh Sorry .  1372372_1372712
*PS02H:	Which is different To be perfectly honest in my current situation .  1373022_1381732
*PS02G:	Mhm .  1383852_1383912
*PS02H:	a pension mortgage would be more advantageous .  1383972_1387852
*PS02G:	Well that 's the most important thing is n't it .  1388062_1391012
*PS02H:	At the moment Because well I 'm not in a pension scheme at work But I have got an option to go in it .  1391292_1397572
*PS02G:	Yeah .  1397572_1397632
*PS02H:	if I want to .  1397672_1398932
*PS02G:	Mhm .  1399682_1399762
*PS02H:	Erm the only problem is well even s even not so much now because because the er a bit better Because of the m because of the way pensions and that are are organized now they 're more flexible now I mean you can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension scheme you were obliged to go in it that was it All your other arrangements went up went through the window .  1400882_1435442
*PS02G:	Mm .  1437742_1437952
*PS02H:	Erm so it it it it 's difficult .  1438642_1441572
*PS02G:	Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays ca n't you and into a .  1441572_1444402
*PS02H:	You can now take now now now you can take them with you .  1444402_1447682
*PS02G:	Mm Where they used to be frozen and then you started another one wherever you went next time .  1447682_1450992
*PS02H:	That 's right That 's right Whereas now .  1451002_1452332
*PS02G:	And you ended up with three four d silly little bits and pieces did n't you .  1452332_1455212
*PS02H:	Yeah Yeah Whereas now you see all the they can put them all into one .  1455512_1458052
*PS02G:	Yeah I know you can take them with you now .  1458582_1460222
*PS02H:	Mm So in a way I think .  1462942_1464152
*PS02G:	And it was a lot less money as well was n't it .  1464152_1465862
*PS02H:	I mm yeah but that w do n't forget .  1465862_1467262
*PS02G:	It started .  1467322_1467592
*PS02H:	that was sixty five .  1467592_1468912
*PS02G:	Yeah .  1469012_1469212
*PS02H:	The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true they double every five years Particularly in the later years there 's you know .  1469212_1476542
*PS02G:	Mm .  1477692_1477752
*PS02H:	more And that 's why I said when it sounded so low that 's why I I still doubt his figures I still think two hundred pound a month a thirty thousand pound mortgage it 's too low .  1477752_1489372
*PS02G:	And and a cash sum at the end of it .  1489372_1490772
*PS02H:	Still think it 's low .  1490772_1492372
*PS02G:	Seems quite does n't seem a lot does it .  1492372_1494752
*PS02H:	No I 'm pretty certain .  1494822_1496652
*PS02G:	And would you still have to have an insurance on top of that .  1496652_1498852
*PS02H:	You have to have term assurance .  1498852_1500452
*PS02G:	So you 'd still have to have .  1500452_1501892
*PS02H:	You 'd have .  1501902_1502112
*PS02G:	you 'd have the two hundred pound and then you 'd have a life insurance on top .  1502122_1504492
*PS02H:	No no no No That was it two hundred and twelve pound .  1504492_1507242
*PS02G:	The whole lot .  1507242_1508702
*PS02H:	The whole lot .  1508702_1509642
*PS02G:	Well why does n't everybody have them then .  1509642_1511332
*PS02H:	Because not everybody 's eligible for them .  1511622_1514092
*PS02G:	I know but they did n't he did n't suggest it to you or why does n't he say well there is this er er you said that he did n't And he must have known that they 're gon na be cheaper so why does n't he advise people who are starting out to take one of them .  1514092_1526852
*PS02H:	Did n't ask .  1526862_1527512
*PS02G:	Rather than a .  1527742_1527862
*PS02H:	Did n't ask the questions .  1527872_1529702
*PS02G:	I know exactly But surely that 's .  1529702_1531052
*PS02H:	He did n't he .  1531052_1531322
*PS02G:	his job If he 's trying to find you the cheapest .  1531322_1533412
*PS02H:	He 's not doing his job Basically .  1533422_1535762
*PS02G:	Exactly .  1536162_1536302
*PS02H:	he 's not doing his job .  1536312_1537612
*PS02G:	Because a young couple going in well even in our situation you have n't got much money and you want the cheapest thing for the best we you know But he never suggested it You said what about a company what about a a pension mortgage and he .  1537722_1552132
*PS02H:	He did n't he he did n't ask the question Which he should have asked .  1552132_1555072
*PS02G:	Mm Exactly Yeah because it is cheaper and .  1555072_1557282
*PS02H:	You see the thing is you see I mean wh wh when this law came out lautro and all that business came out that and best advice and all this sort of thing you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing What they 've got insurance already erm so on and so forth And arrange around those circumstances the best advice package .  1557452_1583742
*PS02G:	Mm .  1583742_1583912
*PS02H:	But he did n't ask me the questions He just he just he just .  1583912_1590622
*PS02G:	No he just could do an endowment one and that was it .  1590622_1592672
*PS02H:	he just assumed it was gon na be .  1592672_1594742
*PS02G:	An an endowment policy and endowment mortgage and that was it He did n't tell you anything else .  1594742_1599342
*PS02H:	No Well you see when he said your base is gon na be .  1599392_1604282
*PS02G:	I know .  1604282_1604372
*PS02H:	a hundred and two hundred .  1604372_1605852
*PS02G:	Ninety six .  1605852_1606212
*PS02H:	and fifteen pounds or whatever .  1606212_1607592
*PS02G:	Two hundred and five and then that on a ninety six .  1607672_1609712
*PS02H:	And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a first time buyer .  1609712_1613312
*PS02G:	Mm .  1613352_1613452
*PS02H:	That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six for the first year Then it goes back up to the base rate .  1613902_1619192
*PS02G:	Yeah .  1619192_1619282
*PS02H:	Not I know all that 's that 's obvious .  1619282_1620592
*PS02G:	That 's quite clear Mm .  1620602_1621262
*PS02H:	But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a pension mortgage I thought well if a hundred and ninety .  1622112_1630352
*PS02G:	That 's only five pound a month to earn your pension .  1630362_1632112
*PS02H:	if a hu if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how come you do n't .  1632112_1634972
*PS02G:	That gives you five pound a month towards your pension which is nothing is it .  1635112_1637612
*PS02H:	how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with because of the term assurance on top That 's fourteen pounds a month term assurance Quite high I think .  1637612_1655052
*PS02G:	What 's term assurance Do n't understand that .  1655062_1657462
*PS02H:	Term assurance is life insurance just on life only With no cash sum at the end .  1658832_1662512
*PS02G:	Well if you died you 'd be dead Well that 's fair enough is n't it You would n't want anything else .  1662512_1666442
*PS02H:	But er throughout throughout the term of my life .  1666442_1668222
*PS02G:	And if you died the would be paid .  1669432_1671002
*PS02H:	If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable .  1671002_1675482
*PS02G:	That 's it you 'd pay .  1675492_1678632
*PS02H:	But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high Term assurance I 'm tempted I 'm I 'm I 'm tempted to have a word with Mick .  1678632_1690912
*PS02G:	What and arrange your own .  1690912_1692512
*PS02H:	Well .  1692512_1692542
*PS02G:	Or he 'd just tell you .  1692542_1693972
*PS02H:	well I whether I I do n't know whether he would or whether he would n't I mean he might he might not but then again he might He might if I if I talk to him he might tell me what sort of I do n't want to hassle him you see cos I 've hassled .  1693972_1706452
*PS02G:	No that 's it .  1706452_1706702
