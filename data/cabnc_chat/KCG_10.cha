*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	on your travels •160125_160935•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	you ought to see underneath the fridge, he does this in the kitchen and they've all gone under the fridge, when you're at the top shop or any other places where the  will you have a look on the cards in the window, I'm looking for a slide, you know, but a smaller one for him for the garden for the summer really, cos that's just about had it that one  ? •160935_185965•
        Cos you can only use them up to about four I would think cos other, other than that they get a bit too big for them don't they?he could do with a little slide in the garden  •186205_204995•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	he will, Christmas •205065_205705•
*JAN:	I'd like to get it sorted out a bit for him really before the summer starts •205985_209325•
*MAR:	It'll be ideal •211545_212145•
*JAN:	Mm •212795_212915•
*MAR:	if you can just fasten him in the back it'll be smashing won't it? •212915_215865•
*JAN:	Well there's the gate, he can only go so far with the gate anyway, so it won't really matter  yeah  yeah  you ought to see all the pegs at the back of me fridge  •216275_247765•
*MAR:	Go and watch daddy  bring the tree down? •248975_262755•
        Watch it Michael, it's coming  yeah, oh you have got hiccups? •263445_273085•
*JAN:	He's had them quite a bit these last few days , they seem to come like that don't they? •275175_279375•
*MAR:	Mm •279375_279465•
*JAN:	Then he'll go a month probably   •280045_281255•
*MAR:	there we are it's down •281285_282105•
*JAN:	Oh, fence nearly came with it   •282105_285005•
*MAR:	it'll seem funny won't it to see that tree down? •285765_294195•
*JAN:	I do think it's lightened this room up though when you think it  gone  •294195_300115•
*MAR:	Yeah I mean it's better when you took that one from down there wasn't it? •300115_303165•
*JAN:	Oh yeah •303165_303485•
*MAR:	Yeah  •303875_303995•
*JAN:	yeah  the only thing about having those others of course you can see through the windows, but there's not a lot you can do about that. •303995_329345•
        John had a word with the bloke across the back there •329345_331495•
*MAR:	Oh did he? •332065_332595•
*JAN:	about, you know the garage? •332935_333745•
*MAR:	Yeah •334075_334355•
*JAN:	So he said he'd got no objections to John moving it back •334355_337345•
*MAR:	Oh well  mm •337385_337805•
*JAN:	we'll probably end up doing a bit to the garden this year as opposed to er  you know going to, we were gonna go down to Somerset in June weren't we? •337805_348625•
*MAR:	Mm •348625_348685•
*JAN:	But that, with things as they are we might as well just hang fire •348765_353395•
*MAR:	Well, it's no use spending money you haven't got is it? •355325_358265•
*JAN:	No, well the thing is I mean you're talking of five or six hundred pounds •358265_362155•
*MAR:	This is it •362315_362675•
*JAN:	and if you can't replace it  I mean we've booked, we've booked through, erm,August anyway, we're definitely going in August to Southport •362675_369955•
*MAR:	and it might be a little bit cheaper for yourself  than going all that way, it certainly won't, it certainly won't cost you as much to get there anyway  •372785_379204•
*JAN:	No, well that's it int it?so    er if things are reasonable we might just go away for a long weekend or something, go find us a place in Southport for a weekend •379204_401134•
*MAR:	Yeah  •401134_401304•
*JAN:	but really I mean you need the odd week at home don't you really to sort of do bits to it, you can't work and do it  •408804_414354•
*MAR:	Well I mean I'm not going away this year, but it's not really bothered me an awful lot  •414384_417674•
*JAN:	No no •420904_422984•
*MAR:	so •422984_423284•
*JAN:	you can't •423284_423704•
*MAR:	gone to erm, oh I think I told you didn't I? •423734_427324•
*JAN:	Yeah •427324_427384•
*MAR:	Gone to Windsor today •427384_428214•
*JAN:	that's right •428374_428934•
*MAR:	and a day Eastbourne tomorrow, now that's a nice little break •429204_432144•
*JAN:	Mm •432144_432204•
*MAR:	just, just a few hours like that •432204_434194•
*JAN:	yeah  •437054_437354•
*MAR:	see some places you see go from Friday to Monday don't they? •437384_440554•
*JAN:	That's alright, I think that's ideal •440634_442164•
*MAR:	Yeah •442164_442224•
*JAN:	I think it's a good time to spend in the garden to be honest, I mean you can't, you can't, it's not really long enough to try and do it at weekends, not if he wants to move that garage back, it'll probably take the best part of the week to sort that out •442224_455684•
*MAR:	Oh it will yeah, cos you've got to empty it and •455684_457594•
*JAN:	That's right •457854_458064•
*MAR:	move your swing haven't ya and  •458364_459544•
*JAN:	yeah  •459544_459634•
*MAR:	everything, yeah and prepare the ground  •459994_461804•
*JAN:	Yeah I don't know whether that swing will end up going to the tip if it comes down, it's a bit rusty int it? •462294_468494•
        Seen better days •468494_469054•
*MAR:	Just depends if the frame's strong •470874_472524•
*JAN:	Yeah •472524_472594•
*MAR:	you know you could always put a bit of paint on it  •472594_475724•
*JAN:	mm  •475724_475784•
*MAR:	to stop the rust, it just depends if it's strong enough to hold them, the frame •475784_479104•
*JAN:	mm, it's done well though, I mean •480914_482974•
*MAR:	You might, you might get a little something out of it for Michael •482974_484884•
*JAN:	Mm, we haven't got a seat on it •484884_488544•
*MAR:	Oh dear •488544_488794•
*JAN:	I don't know what happened to that one that granddad made Deana  I know •488794_499154•

*MAR:	Oh •512204_512234•
*JAN:	it's erm, it's not too bad this time of year, you can peg out, the legs come off it, you know that brown one that you bought me? •512234_520234•
*MAR:	Yeah •520234_520314•
*JAN:	I mean I've had it since, I remember getting, washing me nappies and putting them on there •520314_524534•
*MAR:	Oh I bought that one when Deana was a baby •524534_526314•
*JAN:	Yeah, it was before Deana was born •526314_527784•
*MAR:	was it before Deana was born? •527784_529014•
*JAN:	Yeah cos I remember, I was doing  hang all me nappies out •529014_532024•

*JAN:	before she was born, so I washed them all and put them on  •532094_534964•
*MAR:	Did ya? •535014_535384•
*JAN:	Yeah, so that was er,eleven years ago aren't ya? •535724_540774•
*MAR:	Yeah  •540774_540864•
*JAN:	And it's been used constantly, so it's not done bad, it's the way, the leg's been wiggly for a while, it just broke off the other day, so, I don't know whether John can mend it, he couldn't seem to think he can •540864_553584•
*MAR:	No they're not er, I've got one that's got a rivet come out •553734_556104•
*JAN:	Mm •556734_556794•
*MAR:	on this side, you know where the little piece that, that bend, that you uncatch it to fold it up  •557114_562024•
*JAN:	I know what you mean yeah •562024_562664•
*MAR:	the rivet's come out •562664_563504•
*JAN:	Yeah •563504_563604•
*MAR:	and that, I find that very awkward, I've got a rubber band round it at the moment •564014_567264•
*JAN:	yeah •567264_567364•
*MAR:	but you see that only lasts so long they, they perish •567364_570154•
*JAN:	yeah, done well, I might come winter I'll probably replace it, I won't bother now it's not worth it with summer  says she having a nice summer •570154_581614•
*MAR:	Yes, well, we're bound to have something aren't we? •583114_585954•
*JAN:	Well I should think so •585954_586874•

*MAR:	Yeah •609124_609274•
*JAN:	What are you doing? •610794_616964•
        Mind you don't  your tongue with that  I tell you what they had in er Woolies market as well, I don't know whether you've seen them and I don't, I've not got you know an old Argos catalogue to compare prices, cos they've not got it in the summer one, but they have them in the winter ones, it's like a, a tool box, but it's on wheels and you make it up, you, you know all the screws and the wheels come out and you're not, it's all plastic, I think it must be from age three, because of the little bits, and it's like erm, I've seen it somewhere, where I've been, it has little figures sat in this erm, what would you, it's like erm, a bit like a truck, yeah, and it's got the, the figures in it  •617064_659014•
*MAR:	I haven't I haven't actually seen one, but I once saw a lady on the bus with one •659014_663884•
*JAN:	if it, on the bus you can see  •664814_666534•

*MAR:	Mm •673984_674044•
