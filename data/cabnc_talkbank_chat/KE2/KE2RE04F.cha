*PS0W5:	Nought point one three .  1577803_1578803
*PS0W2:	but you 're not gon na divide by nought point one three are you .  1580953_1583403
*PS0W5:	No ninety one .  1585863_1588173
*PS0W2:	Right now what I shall do before you go any further is divide that at the side here what those and minutes are as decimals of an hour .  1588483_1600033
*PS0W5:	Nought point four seven nought point four seven .  1606073_1612353

*PS0W2:	Eighty you 're not far out but it 's just erm .  1738083_1743913
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	Madrid to Barcelona .  1747583_1749323
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	six eight seven .  1751403_1752273
*PS0W5:	Erm eight six .  1762463_1764043
*PS0W2:	Right just do n't do it again .  1765083_1771803
*PS0W5:	Six .  1775013_1775203
*PS0W2:	Is this the seven hours thirty nine minutes .  1776163_1777813
*PS0W5:	Yeah six eight seven .  1778023_1787823
*PS0W2:	Seven hours .  1787823_1788433
*PS0W5:	seven .  1791333_1791543
*PS0W2:	thirty nine minutes .  1791593_1792823
*PS0W5:	Twenty six .  1793783_1797623
*PS0W2:	five .  1797973_1798313
*PS0W5:	Five no I do it the wrong way .  1799373_1804523

*PS0W5:	One hundred and six .  1860533_1861313
*PS0W2:	Right .  1861583_1861943
*PS0W5:	One three seven .  1863913_1866003
*PS0W2:	Right right what you did n't do almost all the time was to change those minutes to decimals of an hour was n't it So you must remember that whenever you 're dealing with speed or anything to do with hours and minutes you 've got to change your minutes to the decimals of an hour before you can use your calculator .  1866333_1889353
*PS0W5:	Okay .  1889893_1889983
*PS0W2:	Now just let's have a little help here because you wo n't have this graph with you all the time will you .  1890653_1899533
*PS0W5:	No .  1899533_1899613
*PS0W2:	Right so how can you find out what forty minutes is .  1899613_1907343
*PS0W5:	Divide it by ten .  1907343_1908433
*PS0W2:	No what decimal fraction of an hour is forty minutes How can you find out you can use your calculator .  1908433_1924113
*PS0W5:	Quarter three quarters .  1924113_1925963
*PS0W2:	No what 's what 's a quarter of an hour .  1926083_1928753
*PS0W5:	Quarter of an hour twenty minutes fours into sixty fifteen .  1928753_1936023
*PS0W2:	Right so three quarters of an hour is .  1937133_1940753
*PS0W5:	Forty five .  1940753_1942503
*PS0W2:	Forty five minutes if you 've got forty five minutes what 's what 's the fraction of an hour .  1942803_1955393
*PS0W5:	Over sixty .  1955393_1957743
*PS0W2:	Right it 's forty five over sixty you want to change that into a decimal what do you do .  1957743_1963293
*PS0W5:	Erm divide into .  1963293_1968773
*PS0W2:	No how do you change any fraction into a decimal now this is something you must .  1968953_1974273
*PS0W5:	Divide it by ten .  1974273_1975383
*PS0W2:	No no no no you 've got fractions here look erm now how do you change all those fractions into decimal fractions what do you do .  1975953_1996813
*PS0W5:	Nought point five .  1996813_1998043
*PS0W2:	But how did you do it You knew that but how do you do it .  1998223_2002973
*PS0W5:	Erm .  2002973_2003043
*PS0W2:	How do you do it on a calculator What does that really mean one over two how else could you write one over two How else could you write it .  2003893_2014673
*PS0W5:	Two over four .  2014673_2017833
*PS0W2:	Yes but I do n't mean that erm could you would you write it as one plus two or one minus two or one multiplied by two or one divided by two .  2019303_2031943
*PS0W5:	One multiplied .  2031943_2033093
*PS0W2:	One multiplied by two Two ones are two Does a half equal two So what does that you know this which of those four rules do you do for that .  2033173_2047243
*PS0W5:	One .  2047243_2047533
*PS0W2:	What 's one plus two .  2056893_2057753
*PS0W5:	Three .  2057813_2058073
*PS0W2:	What 's one minus two .  2058483_2060553
*PS0W5:	Nothing minus .  2060553_2062203
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	one minus two .  2063783_2067373
*PS0W5:	One no nothing .  2067373_2071843
*PS0W2:	One minus two .  2072913_2081163
*PS0W5:	Minus two .  2081223_2084023
*PS0W2:	Minus one come down two come down one you get to nought come down another one .  2084293_2092543
*PS0W5:	Minus two .  2092543_2092843
*PS0W2:	so one minus one one minus two is .  2092843_2095283
*PS0W5:	Minus one .  2095283_2096053
*PS0W2:	Is minus one what 's one times two .  2096093_2100193
*PS0W5:	Er two .  2100193_2104203
*PS0W2:	What 's one divided by two .  2104203_2108273
*PS0W5:	One .  2108273_2108533
*PS0W2:	If you 've got one apple and you divide it .  2108853_2115463
*PS0W5:	Half .  2115463_2115563
*PS0W2:	Right one divided by two is a half so which of those answers is that one Right so what does one how else can you write one over two .  2115923_2129413
*PS0W5:	Erm one divide .  2129413_2133183
*PS0W2:	One divided by two right remember that so how can I write that .  2133183_2140633
*PS0W5:	Forty five divided by six .  2140633_2143283
*PS0W2:	By .  2143523_2143683
*PS0W5:	Sixty .  2144273_2144633
*PS0W2:	Right do that on your calculator .  2145163_2148463
*PS0W5:	Nought point seven five .  2148463_2156213
*PS0W2:	Right so that equals nought point seven five what 's a half Do it on the calculator .  2156213_2163283
*PS0W5:	Nought point five .  2163283_2165013
*PS0W2:	Right what 's three quarters divided er as a decimal .  2167923_2175663
*PS0W5:	Nought point five nought point eight seven five .  2175663_2191673
*PS0W2:	Right so how do you change a fraction into a decimal .  2191783_2196533
*PS0W5:	You divide it by the bottom .  2196533_2198063
*PS0W2:	You divide the top number by the bottom number so supposing you 've got fifty seven minutes and you want to change that into a decimal of an hour what fraction of an hour is it What 's fifty seven minutes as a deci as a fraction of an hour That 's forty five minutes .  2198063_2221153
*PS0W5:	Fifty seven over sixty .  2221353_2222373
*PS0W2:	Right so how do you change that into a decimal .  2222883_2227143
*PS0W5:	Nought point nine five .  2232233_2233443
*PS0W2:	Right nought point nine five so now you can see how easily you can change your minutes into a decimal at any time right now let's look at some of these this is four hours and thirty .  2233443_2255103
*PS0W5:	Thirty .  2255743_2255863
*PS0W2:	seven minutes so it 's four hours four hours and thirty seven minutes so what fraction is that of an hour .  2255863_2266083
*PS0W5:	Erm .  2266083_2266483
*PS0W2:	Thirty seven minutes .  2267383_2274743
*PS0W5:	Forty .  2274743_2275093
*PS0W2:	Thirty seven minutes .  2275703_2277153
*PS0W5:	over sixty .  2277153_2278143
*PS0W2:	Right thirty seven over sixty what 's thirty seven over sixty Cos the ans that is four and thirty seven sixtieths .  2278143_2285063
*PS0W5:	Mm .  2285393_2285893
*PS0W2:	so what 's thirty seven sixtieths as a decimal .  2287163_2288773
*PS0W5:	Nought point six .  2288773_2298523
*PS0W2:	Right so what 's four hours thirty seven minutes .  2298653_2304713
*PS0W5:	Four point six .  2304713_2305573
*PS0W2:	Point six .  2305693_2306103
*PS0W5:	O .  2306143_2306503
