*PS0A8:	Yeah . 
*PS0AB:	all the satellites hanging down it was very good the way it had all been done in in that respect but what I found was the first bit was very boring I found but when it got going a bit it was better but the whole moral of the story was that nowhere is perfect to live but it 's hard for y young children like this to .

*PS0AC:	Yeah It was very good was n't it The er . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah mm . 
*PS0AB:	And an unusual slant . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah . 
*PS0AB:	on the story . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah . 
*PS0AC:	And then was it er a little while after that Malcolm and I went to see the . 
*PS0AB:	Racing Demons . 
*PS0AC:	No the parents' panto . 
*PS0AB:	Oh yes Oh I did n't go You got me a ticket but I did n't go did I A cheese What was that called . 
*PS0AC:	Crumple Stilton or something was n't it The parents at the school all get together and do a pantomime for the children Erm I think they I think they do that during the day and then in the evening it 's on for anybody else who wants to see that take-off on cheeses That was quite good Yeah we went to see Racing Demons at the beginning of December did n't we Cos we went with Margaret and Roger . 
*PS0AB:	Mm I suppose yes . 
*PS0AC:	Mm It was quite quite good at the Theatre Royal . 
*PS0A8:	Oh we got sidetracked er erm about erm tt Blind Date did n't I I I said I was sp you were speaking to an expert er so we went off at a blind tangent But they they er I mean you do n't have to be too bright to realize that the questions have been given them and the answers have g been given them . 
*PS0AB:	Well somebody it was Hazel was n't it . 
*PS0AC:	Mm . 
*PS0AB:	She erm said well of course they know the questions beforehand and the the answers are always written out for them erm but I I would n't have thought all the answers because some of them come over quite spontaneously . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah bu yeah but they are rehearsing for two and a half hours They do n't see the person they do n't see the er the they 're kept separate but erm the they are rehearsed So er y you know An an and I could erm I I erm her name was Barbara erm Actually it was rather interesting there a oh have you remembered the name of that club . 
*PS0AB:	No . 
*PS0A8:	I would know it if you told me . 
*PS0AB:	Well I can see it on . 
*PS0AC:	Mm . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah A anyway it does n't matter Er but she 's a member and we went there for lunch and it was the ideal place you know cos there were n't any many people around and so we had quite a nice lunch and erm whilst we were there we then had a drink in er in the bar and erm her the the secretary of the club a lady came to talk to Barbara and she mentioned that she 'd seen her on Blind Date you see and so I got to know more by listening to them two speaking er and er that 's where I learnt about er that Erm . 
*PS0AC:	Well some of the questions you think erm you think erm you know are n't they a bit well way out or what made them ask that . 
*PS0AB:	Well I 've said all along . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah and so and some of the answers . 
*PS0AB:	how do they think up those answers in such a . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah . 
*PS0AB:	short time but er . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah yeah . 
*PS0AB:	now we know It takes some of the erm tt oh what 's what 's the word When er . 
*PS0AC:	0 . 
*PS0AB:	No When you when you think that they 're racking their brains and it . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah . 
*PS0AB:	seems far more interesting than knowing that they 've rehearsed for hours on end . 
*PS0A8:	I think sometimes the odd er the odd times people are . 
*PS0AB:	Putting a bit more . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah a and in fact in the programme I th the one that Barbara was in I can remember the er as it happens I I was out er when that programme came on and I taped it so I s I I 've still got that particular programme and the lady at the end er on one of her questions she 'd obviously forgotten what she was going to say er and sort of made something up and er she turned to er as they were just panning away from her she turned to her next door neighbour and more or less said I forgot what I was going to say you know . 
*PS0AB:	Mm . 
*PS0A8:	Mm . 
*PS0AB:	Cos they do n't have any notes or anything do they So . 
*PS0A8:	No no no oh no I mean er . 
*PS0AB:	It 's supposed to look natural . 
*PS0A8:	Yes yes a and erm oh yes I mean some of the things that especially the er the more senior people now th those people on the erm programme last night did you see it . 
*PS0AB:	Yeah . 
*PS0AC:	Yeah . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah . 
*PS0AC:	Clarence . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah er they they would n't have come out with some of the things about er I ca n't remember what was said that erm you know er would n't mind meeting you in the bath or . 
*PS0AB:	Yes or under the shower yes . 
*PS0A8:	we w that that that s you know that s yeah that sort of thing erm . 
*PS0AB:	I think they are a bit er . 
*PS0A8:	Yes . 
*PS0AB:	I suppose that 's just . 
*PS0A8:	I mean it oh yes I mean actually . 
*PS0AC:	Make it lighthearted . 
*PS0A8:	actually erm the the er it is a very good from the television people 's point of view it is an excellent programme because i y people are interested are n't they . 
*PS0AB:	Yes . 
*PS0A8:	A and furthermore they 're interested in in the way out somebody and that in fact I think . 
*PS0AB:	Looks a little bit different . 
*PS0A8:	they sometimes manipulate the questions so that the person picks . 
*PS0AC:	To make them . 
*PS0A8:	the right one that they would like to be picked Do you know what I mean . 
*PS0AC:	yeah yeah could be . 
*PS0A8:	Erm oh did you did you see the one with that it was last week when they came back I think that naive bloke lad from Devon . 
*PS0AB:	Oh yes . 
*PS0A8:	Dear oh dear oh dear . 
*PS0AC:	Was that the one where the girl was a . 
*PS0A8:	Nurse . 
*PS0AB:	A nurse or d yes . 
*PS0AC:	and she was only a bit older . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah That 's the one . 
*PS0AB:	Yes his . 
*PS0A8:	that 's the one . 
*PS0AC:	He was eighteen and she was nineteen or something . 
*PS0AB:	And she kept saying how childish he was . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah oh it was predictable that was n't go to work He was was n't he Very immature . 
*PS0AC:	How far in front of us seeing it is it erm recorded . 
*PS0A8:	Erm I think Barbara I think it was July when she did it So that would be and that would be about either November or December would n't it . 
*PS0AB:	Yes . 
*PS0AC:	Cos I suppose they do so many recordings and then screen them do n't they . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah . 
*PS0AC:	Sort of for the series and then then there 's a break . 
*PS0AB:	Well Cilla Black 's one of the highest paid erm presenters is n't she On the television . 
*PS0A8:	Mm . 
*PS0AB:	Esther Rantzen for the B B C and Cilla Black I think on the A T V . 
*PS0A8:	The erm did you see the one where this was er er for the more senior ones again er about the fifty mark where the fellow was a hypnotist and a very nice fella . 
*PS0AB:	I can remember now you say hypnotist but I ca n't remember what happened in the programme but I can remember him . 
*PS0A8:	and er she was er the one he . 
*PS0AB:	Because they were on about in the answers about him hypnotizing them one of them was especially . 
*PS0A8:	Oh and the the trip they had was to er the Middle East erm in the desert . 
*PS0AB:	I did n't see that . 
*PS0A8:	Oh you did n't see it . 
*PS0AB:	0 . 
*PS0A8:	Ah Oh well er what I was going to say is that er I thought I 'd summed the person up that he 'd selected and I I thought oh she i er it 's not gon na be easy for him and it was n't you know she was a bit of a bit of a so and so I think really Full of her own importance you know . 
*PS0AB:	Yeah . 
*PS0AC:	I often wonder if when they 've selected a person say right I 'll choose number three when number one goes by and number two goes by afterwards if they think oh you know no I would have preferred number two . 
*PS0A8:	Oh they would I 'm sure a lot of that 's done . 
*PS0AC:	Well do they . 
*PS0AB:	Wonder if they have a a a chance . 
*PS0AC:	0 . 
*PS0AB:	of meeting up with them . 
*PS0AC:	afterwards . 
*PS0A8:	Well I heard I I wondered about that and erm I think they must have contact because erm one of them who came back bearing in mind there must be a a a about a three month gap had had a proposal from one of the persons . 
*PS0AC:	One of the others . 
*PS0A8:	who er she did n't pick . 
*PS0AB:	Oh Mm . 
*PS0AC:	But sometimes you can see ooh that one and that one who just go together and they do n't choose each other . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah . 
*PS0AC:	and then when they . 
*PS0AB:	And you 're sitting here going oh choose so and so you choose him do n't you . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
*PS0AC:	Yeah . 
*PS0A8:	But but from the programme producer 's point of view I should think he he does n't want too many that are okay he wants the er . 
*PS0AC:	But it would be nice to get . 
*PS0AB:	0 . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah yeah . 
*PS0AB:	I mean just lately they seem to they really slang each other do n't they . 
*PS0A8:	Mm mm . 
*PS0AC:	I of er was it last week erm yeah it must have been where the the coloured lad . 
*PS0AB:	Yes . 
*PS0AC:	cos he was back last night was n't he Two white lads and a coloured one and er it was a white girl and I often wonder if that 's a good idea er whether they should all be the same colour . 
*PS0AB:	Oh I think so because it must be an awful shock for the girl to go round the screen and they 're faced with a coloured although they do n't bother so much these days do they . 
*PS0AC:	No She said he was n't ugly enough did n't she . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah . 
*PS0AB:	But a few well I was gon na say a few weeks ago it might be longer than that there was that very large coloured girl that was on . 
*PS0A8:	That 's a few years ago never mind a few months . 
*PS0AB:	No er there was one not so very I 'm sure not so ve not not years ago but it was . 
*PS0A8:	Yo do you there was one very bonny lass and she was on the er they they had erm composite programme the other the other week and she was on that again . 
*PS0AB:	Oh is that where I saw her . 
*PS0A8:	Maybe . 
*PS0AC:	0 . 
*PS0AB:	I mean fancy being erm confronted with somebody like like that . 
*PS0A8:	And in and actually in that programme it was a Nottingham fella who er was confronted with her . 
*PS0AB:	Was it . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah So yeah she 's a real extrovert . 
*PS0AB:	And then there 's that er one who was a pu . 
*PS0AC:	That was a little while ago that was big . 
*PS0AB:	she was big but she was was n't coloured was she . 
*PS0AC:	No but she ran a pub or something . 
*PS0AB:	So she was Somewhere yes . 
*PS0AC:	managed a pub and she was all all over Yeah . 
*PS0AB:	But one one of the coloured chaps where Tasha works said he was he 'd been to one of these Blind Dates he was on but we have n't come across him yet have we . 
*PS0AC:	But he only said that a little while ago did n't he So if there 's a three month . 
*PS0AB:	Yes he might be . 
*PS0AC:	gap . 
*PS0A8:	Actually erm Barbara took went with her niece to for the audition and er what I 'm not sure of a a and Barbara got on and her niece did n't what I 'm not sure is whether when she went down she was thinking that of sort of er an audition for herself or whether they approached her because apparently they they do n't get too many of the senior people . 
*PS0AB:	Oh No it 's it 's not often really that you get a senior . 
*PS0A8:	In fact Barbara was saying to me er wh why do n't you er but it 's not the thing that I 'd want to do . 
*PS0AC:	Nice to have them now and again Mm . 
*PS0AB:	Did you see erm Wendy . 
*PS0AC:	No she I think she was coming in and out cos the car door was open . 
*PS0AB:	So you do n't know what time Heidi 's . 
*PS0AC:	Half past four . 
*PS0AB:	Half past four Oh she 's . 
*PS0AC:	And erm . 
*PS0AB:	late this week is she . 
*PS0AC:	Well she was only early was it last week or the week before Whenever she was early because there was a christening erm on and they were using the hall afterwards And you know the door they go in . 
*PS0AB:	Mm . 
*PS0AC:	to er that little side door Well there were all blue and white balloons hanging up in the hall and by the door just these rows and rows of blue balloons and the door opens outwards . 
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AC:	and Wendy was saying how was she going to get the door open without all these balloons . 
*PS0AB:	Going . 
*PS0AC:	coming out yeah . 
*PS0AB:	So no doubt it was a boy that was being christened . 
*PS0AC:	I would think so blue yeah So they decided that once the christening party was in the hall which was gon na be three o'clock they did n't stand much chance of erm . 
*PS0AB:	Doing anything . 
*PS0AC:	No so that 's why they had it two till three that day But it 's now back to half past two till half past four and whoever 's playing the dame arrived just in front of us . 
*PS0AB:	Oh . 
*PS0AC:	so he 's there Tt what did Malcolm say It was five five weeks four weeks on Friday till half term . 
*PS0AB:	Mm . 
*PS0AC:	Four weeks on Friday that 's all she 's got to . 
*PS0AB:	Yeah . 
*PS0AC:	sort it out . 
*PS0AB:	Oh if I go into town perhaps Tuesday to get her tape try to get her tape . 
*PS0AC:	Well she said it 's in H V M . 
*PS0AB:	erm I 'll perhaps give Wind what are they called Windblowers a ring and see if they 've got . 
*PS0AC:	For the music . 
*PS0AB:	Mm I could actually tomorrow to see if it 's in the library could n't I . 
*PS0AC:	Mm and then just photocopy it . 
*PS0AB:	Oh you 're not allowed to are you . 
*PS0AC:	Well they wo n't know will they . 
*PS0AB:	Oh well yeah I 'd have to bring it home to have it done Breaking the law is n't it . 
*PS0AC:	Well I think it 's only if you want to do er you know like doing it for some something or other is n't it . 
*PS0AB:	No when used to get music for the Women 's Own choir to do for Mothering Sunday she used to say keep quiet where you got the copy from . 
*PS0AC:	Mm I think it 's when you want a lot . 
*PS0AB:	Or say if you 've got a ten or eleven running off Anyway I 'll go in and steal it We walked past that place did n't we . 
*PS0AC:	H V M . 
*PS0AB:	Mm . 
*PS0AC:	We were on our way down to but we were n't actually sure . 
*PS0AB:	What it was called . 
*PS0AC:	Mm so it would n't have been any good going in . 
*PS0AB:	Although you 'd of probably recognized it . 
*PS0AC:	Well I said I thought it was called Seriously Orchestral . 
*PS0AB:	Well that 's what it is is n't it . 
*PS0AC:	Mm Were you buying this erm newspaper last week by any chance . 
*PS0AB:	Oh . 
*PS0A8:	Why . 
*PS0AB:	0 . 
*PS0AC:	Get to France for a pound . 
*PS0A8:	Oh yes I saw it on the er box mm . 
*PS0AB:	She 's keeping keep the coupons for Malcolm to send off have n't you . 
*PS0AC:	You collect er well all you 've really got ta do is buy the paper Monday to Friday collect four coupons . 
*PS0AB:	Is that empty . 
*PS0AC:	Mm . 
*PS0AB:	better move it . 
*PS0AC:	Collect four coupons and each set of coupons allows you to claim up to four tickets and it was a pound a ticket was n't it . 
*PS0AB:	Mm . 
*PS0AC:	A pound a ticket and you could go there were three routes you could go and any time up to March the twenty eighth . 
*PS0A8:	Oh . 
*PS0AC:	and that was your fare from you could go Dover to Calais . 
*PS0AB:	Mm . 
*PS0AC:	Newhaven to Dieppe or . 
*PS0AB:	Du n no what the other one was . 
*PS0AC:	way down was it Southampton somewhere and that was your ferry fare over for the day So erm we thought we might go for a day did n't we . 
*PS0AB:	Might do yes the end of March He 'd I think he would have liked to have gone the four hour trip over I did n't think you 'd like that . 
*PS0AC:	Well that one was the most restrictive because that you had to go you could go any time between was it eight and eleven in the morning but you could only come back either something like quarter to five quarter to no quarter to six was it Or quarter to two in the morning there were only two you could come back on Whereas the Dover to Calais you can go any time between this time and that time and come back any time between this time and that time . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah Yeah . 
*PS0AC:	But going to Dieppe it docks on the quay or whatever is sort of right in the heart of erm the town so once you are off the ferry you 're there Well I suppose it depends what you want to go for . 
*PS0AB:	Well he he was asking me which I 'd prefer and I said I think you ought to consider Vicki not me on the crossing . 
*PS0AC:	Well if you go if you stay till quarter to one in the morning how can you be sure there 's gon na be anything open to . 
*PS0AB:	To do Well that 's it . 
*PS0AC:	to do So therefore if you come back . 
*PS0AB:	Paris nightclub . 
*PS0AC:	if you could come back before . 
*PS0AB:	Stripping club . 
*PS0AC:	if you come back on the one before you 've only got about three and a half hours so you 've got four hours on the ferry three and a half there and then four hours back again have n't you Anyway we 'll see what . 
*PS0AB:	Well Vicki 's not very keen on crossing the water are you . 
*PS0AC:	No . 
*PS0AB:	So I thought the shorter journey would be better . 
*PS0AC:	And if we do n't go we 've only lost a pound ticket So we 'll see . 
*PS0AB:	snow that day . 
*PS0AC:	Well I think they 're going to repeat the offer are n't they They 're supposed to be doing it again . 
*PS0AB:	Well we at the erm school play we were talking to who did you say Mr . 
*PS0AC:	Mm . 
*PS0AB:	And he was telling you know erm it was the er Christmas thing he was t saying he 'd been to France on a cheap ticket had n't he . 
*PS0AC:	Through the Daily Ma oh Express . 
*PS0AB:	The Express was n't it Or The Mail . 
*PS0AC:	Daily Express . 
*PS0AB:	It was one of the better papers I mean The Sun is absolutely I mean I did tr have a go at reading the first one and I thought well I ca n't read this trash any longer think I read two pages . 
*PS0AC:	Yes what did he how much did it cost him Fifteen pounds did he say . 
*PS0AB:	they had they went for the weekend did n't they No not for the I do n't think they went for the day .
