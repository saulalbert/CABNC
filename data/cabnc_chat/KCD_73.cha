*CLA:	He no   (.) nobody
*HEL:	Nodded.

*HEL:	She nodded.
*CLA:	nodded but looked at an apple tree over the hedge.The next day they began to build the nest in the apple tree.Is that the apple tree?
*HEL:	No, here's the apple tree, I think that's the rose arch, but she didn't think that was such a good idea, and she was probably quite right.
*CLA:	Pardon?
*HEL:	She was probably quite right.
*CLA:	This one  (        ) .
*HEL:	Yeah, here we are.
*CLA:	The little hen worked all day getting moss and wood and bind up those
