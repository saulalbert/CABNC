# CABNC transcription project

## Outline
A detailed conversation analytic transcriptions of naturalistic conversations from a subcorpus of the [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) amounting to around 4.2 million words.

## Accessing the data

Names of folders and files correspond to tapes from the [Audio BNC](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC)

Transcriptions are made using [Jeffersonian CA transcription conventions](http://homepages.lboro.ac.uk/~ssca1/notation.htm), and the CHAT CA file formats and transcription symbols provided by the [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/) transcription system.

## Selection Rationale

[The Audio BNC](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) contains about 7.5 million words of recorded speech, all of
it already roughly transcribed, with audio recordings of sufficient quality for
automated phonetic transcriptions, and full Praat TextGrid files aligning audio
to transcriptions are available for the entire corpus. There are also
comprehensive wordclass and part-of-speech tag annotations. Within the overall
BNC corpus, this project focuses on a subcorpus of more the most naturalistic,
informally structured conversations. These include 152 rough transcripts of
audio files, labelled by the original BNC transcribers with the following tags:

* Overall category: Demographically sampled (subjects carrying audio recorders around)
* Interaction type: Dialogue (rather than speeches/monologues)
* Genre type: conv. (conversation).

These are conversations around water-coolers, in corridors, bus-stops, homes
etc. and as such are most useful for analysing natural talk-in-interaction.
There are 4,228,314 words in this subcorpus. 

### BNC Data Access

* [BNC transcripts are available in HTML format](http://bnc.phon.ox.ac.uk/transcripts-html/) via the AudioBNC 
* Audio data and Praat TextGrid are available on the Oxford Phonetics Institute [AudioBNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access).
* Lancaster University's [BNCweb tool](http://bncweb.lancs.ac.uk/): provides a useful web interface for searching the BNC and checking the audio location of sections of transcript.

## Rights and usage information

* BNC spoken audio recordings were created or collected from other sources by Longman Dictionaries for the British National Corpus Consortium. Their usage is governed by the [terms of the original recording permissions agreement](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/permletters.html#spoken1) with the contributors, which requires that they can only be "used for scientific study and publication by writers of dictionaries and educational material and language researchers". Furthermore, **by downloading any of the audio recordings, you agree** to the terms in section 2, 6, 7 and 9 of [the BNC User Licence (available here)](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/licence.pdf), the audio recordings being understood to be among the "spoken texts" included in the "BNC Texts".
