{"name":"CABNC","tagline":"A conversation analytic transcription of a spoken subcorpus of the BNC","body":"# CABNC transcription project\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\nA detailed conversation analytic transcription of naturalistic conversations from a subcorpus of the [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) amounting to around 4.2 million words.\r\n\r\n## Accessing and using CABNC data\r\n\r\nThe names of folders and files in the CABNC project correspond to the names of original tapes and audio file names from the [Audio BNC](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC).\r\n\r\n## Using / contributing transcripts\r\n\r\nTranscriptions are made using [Jeffersonian CA transcription conventions](http://homepages.lboro.ac.uk/~ssca1/notation.htm), and the CHAT CA file formats and transcription symbols provided by the [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/) transcription system.\r\n\r\nTo use or contribute to these transcripts:\r\n\r\n1. download and install [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/),\r\n2. download the correspondingly titled audio file from the [Audio BNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access),\r\n3. transcribe and push new files or refine existing transcripts using CLAN.\r\n\r\n## BNC Data and Usage\r\n\r\n### Accessing BNC data\r\n\r\nThe data on which this project builds is available here:\r\n\r\n* Full [BNC transcripts are available in HTML format](http://bnc.phon.ox.ac.uk/transcripts-html/) via the AudioBNC \r\n* Audio data and Praat TextGrid are available on the Oxford Phonetics Institute [AudioBNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access).\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform complex searches on BNC data:\r\n\r\n* Lancaster University's [BNCweb tool](http://bncweb.lancs.ac.uk/): provides a useful web interface for searching the BNC and checking the audio location of sections of transcript.\r\n\r\n### Subcorpus Data Selection Rationale\r\n\r\n[The Audio BNC](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) contains about 7.5 million words of recorded speech, all of\r\nit already roughly transcribed, with audio recordings of sufficient quality for\r\nautomated phonetic transcriptions, and full Praat TextGrid files aligning audio\r\nto transcriptions are available for the entire corpus. There are also\r\ncomprehensive wordclass and part-of-speech tag annotations. Within the overall\r\nBNC corpus, this project focuses on a subcorpus of more naturalistic,\r\nconversations from informal contexts. These include 152 rough transcripts of\r\naudio files, labelled by the original BNC transcribers with the following tags:\r\n\r\n* Overall category: Demographically sampled (subjects carrying audio recorders around)\r\n* Interaction type: Dialogue (rather than speeches/monologues)\r\n* Genre type: conv. (conversation).\r\n\r\nThese are conversations around water-coolers, in corridors, bus-stops, homes\r\netc. and as such are most useful for analysing natural talk-in-interaction.\r\nThere are 4,228,314 words in this subcorpus. \r\n\r\n## Rights and Usage Information\r\n\r\n* All files are publicly available under a Creative Commons Attribution License ([details here](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))\r\n* BNC spoken audio recordings were created or collected from other sources by Longman Dictionaries for the British National Corpus Consortium. Their usage is governed by the [terms of the original recording permissions agreement](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/permletters.html#spoken1) with the contributors, which requires that they can only be \"used for scientific study and publication by writers of dictionaries and educational material and language researchers\". \r\n* John Coleman, Ladan Baghai-Ravary, John Pybus, and Sergio Grau (2012) Audio BNC: the audio edition of the Spoken British National Corpus.
