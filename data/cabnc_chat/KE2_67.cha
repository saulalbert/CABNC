*TER:	He's missed it!He's only got two and he wanted three!Really!He, ha!So now it's, so he wants one and   (.) Bryant one for two.Ah!Gracious me!Bryant thought he'd lost it then!He should of done really it was
*MAR:	 (        ) are they both  (        ) ?
*TER:	No, I think, oh I don't know he's an exiled Scot.
*MAR:	Did he have a little   (        ) cos he's in er   (.) oh no, of course he's wearing the blue of Scotland isn't he?
*TER:	Well of course they have to wear different colours anyway don't they?
*MAR:	Mm. (.) Nice that   (        ) isn't it?
*TER:	Yeah.Short innit?
*MAR:	 (        ) , Andy Thompson innit?
*TER:	Yeah.Oh, medium length.
*MAR:	So
*TER:	Well Thompson needs 
*MAR:	Bryant 
*TER:	Thompson needs one and Bryant needs two. (.) And that's Thompson.
*MAR:	I'm going with David this Saturday. (.) Worked hard hasn't he?To get back there.
*TER:	He has worked hard.He only needed two at the last end.Thompson needed three.Erm   (.) but he just had sort of he wasn't so good.Well that's a better ball!If he'd done that in the last erm, he'd have won it.
*MAR:	And he's come back and sort of go round the back cos that other fellow sort of he came down
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	and then he appeared up the top there. (        ) 
*TER:	They come down to see   (.) what the situation really is.
*MAR:	Please!Come on then!Oh it's gone further though this
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	Well presumably they si , they have to throw or they're supposed to throw, or have they not?Cos he just said that should of been enough.
*TER:	Oh, he's looking worried!Ooh ooh!Ee ee!
*MAR:	Well that's much better than the other two isn't it?
*TER:	Yeah, I don't, yeah.Could be two.Yeah we've dropped two more.
*MAR:	And he's got two more balls.
*TER:	Mm.
*MAR:	Well, is that a problem?He's gonna try and knock 
*TER:	So he's gotta   (        ) again.
*MAR:	Yeah.Oh it's going right through! (.) He's trying to knock David out of course isn't he?
*TER:	Mm mm.And drop himself in.
*MAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Well I should think he's now got wo one red I should think.
*MAR:	I suppose you could say David had it so often     (.)  ((laugh))  (.) that it be nice for him to get it.
*TER:	I should think David will come out on the forehand and try and knock that   (.) blue ball out.The one that's 
*MAR:	He's only got one there.
*TER:	Mm.Yes I 
*MAR:	The re 
*TER:	thought he only got one.Interesting to see which way he comes.I think he'll come round this way. (.) Oh no he's not!He's coming round the   (.) back the other way. (.) Ooh ooh!I th  (.) probably only red still. (.) It's still his one.
*MAR:	Still only got one. (.) Yes. (.) Well he's got three   (.) so this is the fourth one from this fellow isn't it?
*TER:	That's right!
*MAR:	And Bryant has the last one? (.) No.
*TER:	A chalk.
*MAR:	 ((laugh))  (.) So it just needs   (.) David to get through?He can do what he likes 
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	with this last ball really.
*TER:	Well, yeah.
*MAR:	This red one.
*TER:	If he gets another red he's won the match.But if he   (.) if he plays it and misses it he could give it to Thompson.And if he   (.) if he doesn't play   (.) it'll be a draw.
*MAR:	Oh not just , not just one ball he needs to play 
*TER:	Yes.
*MAR:	but two.
*TER:	He needs two.Thompson didn't play his. (.) It's all or nothing on this one!
*MAR:	Oh dear! (.) So has that fellow won it?
*TER:	No, it's one all.I it it's one red, so they're now   (.) six all.
*MAR:	Oh gosh!It doesn't matter then.
