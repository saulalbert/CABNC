*BRE:	Why didn't he go to, they've got a lovely Burton's in the precinct over there now.
*DAV:	Didn't get that far.
*BRE:	Yeah, there's a new one over there.
*DAV:	I said we'll try this shop, I said at least have a look and I said we'll go round to the other's, I said he made he's mind up when he walked in, (        ) .
*BRE:	I bet he had to get it from out the back did he?
*DAV:	No.
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) .
*DAV:	 (        ) .
*BRE:	Just you remember when you get your Access at the end of the month then.

*JEA:	Oh that's where you see it , yes, yes.
*BRE:	Great big sign on it, because people will, you know, I mean Tesco's when we went last night it was packed, no you probably didn't see it
*JEA:	No, I didn't.
*BRE:	but it was packed  (.) 
*JEA:	Is that because of the food price war?Are they still doing that, are they still trying to keep there prices down?
*DAV:	They say they are Jean  (        ) .
*BRE:	Oh I dunno, they are   (        ) .
*DAV:	They, they put, we go to er, a little shop in  (        ) , only a little shop and they have to got into er one at Croydon every Thursday, and he get's, the manager, he get's the er, driver's to come out of head office, and   (        ) what staff, and he always buys it in bulk and he, he still buys say it's coca cola   (        ) say it was ten pence a can
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	He'll buy probably about a thousand cans
*BRE:	Mm, mm.
*DAV:	and then, that week, he sell's ten pence a can, then the following week he still bought it ten pence, following week it goes up to eighteen pence, but he's still selling what  (        ) , so I don't think it, I think  (        ) .
*BRE:	But I still think Tesco's is the cheapest supermarket, I do, Waitrose is way over the top.
*DAV:	 (        ) .
*BRE:	Yeah I know   (        ) working, but I'm just saying there food.

*BRE:	That is, it is so wrong.
*JEA:	Yeah, I mean it's alright for people like my son John, who's got a   (        ) good salary.
*BRE:	I was gonna say he's on about thirty thousands ain't he?
*JEA:	Oh it must be probably more than that .
*BRE:	Probably more than that , but that, he wouldn't mind if he had to do it.
*JEA:	Well he does, he goes in on Saturdays very often, he goes in on Sundays very often, you know, goes up to have a look at a site or goes into the office to look over something in peace without the phone ringing all that's sort of thing, he puts in a lot of time that's not strictly accounted for, Gerry did, I did as a teacher, but then we were well paid.
*DAV:	People who are on six and a half thousand a year.
*JEA:	Mm, it  (        ) .
*DAV:	It, it, it's   (        ) in the office.
*JEA:	Roll on the common market day when the social dimension will stop that, it'll stop it in it's tracks, sheer exploitation that is.
*DAV:	 (        ) about the, what is, what   (        ) the, the ladies, I told you, women who work nights at
*BRE:	Mm.
*DAV:	Tesco's, they sent a letter out to them, and er, cos there open over Christmas period, er I think some of the stores   (        ) and the letter says we all get two days off, cos  (        ) , and then like, they, they won't Christmas day  (        ) , twelve o'clock new, Christmas Eve and twelve o'clock new Christmas Day, they   (        ) twelve o'clock  (        ) 
*BRE:	Disgusting.
*JEA:	Disgraceful.
*DAV:	Otherwise they said  (        ) , I mean even with, they gotta do it .
*BRE:	if they don't turn up they don't get paid for the Christmas and Boxing Day.
*DAV:	Well  (        ) .
*BRE:	Sacked.
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*DAV:	I mean most of them are only there cos there finding it hard with the mortgage.
*JEA:	Quite, quite.
*DAV:	Got them over, they, they said, they said they know they've got them over a barrel.
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	They, Tesco's is one of   (        ) a lot of the firms, but you said there dreadful the way they treat their staff .
*DAV:	Yeah , well Tesco's, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, all the same.
*JEA:	Mm.
*DAV:	When, when you walk in the front of the shop, it all look's nice, got out the back.
*JEA:	Mm, mm  (.) 
*BRE:	But Neil he was gonna go down to Tesco's but he is, Ipswich, can't get down here, (        ) so he can't sort of travel   (.) and you know what the hassle of having to take him and pick him up.
*JEA:	Can't, I can't do it.When he was first with me I could belt up about seven in the morning, but, recently I've noticed that I feel unwell if I get up and rush out .
*BRE:	 [yawning] Yeah, but he could probably do a two till ten shift, but the two would be alright  [] , but you wouldn't want to go out ten o'clock at night and pick him up.
*JEA:	But, I, physically I can't do it, I, I've aged up in the last few years.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	My, my years have caught up with me you know.It's all very well keeping mentally flexible and all the rest of the who-har, but if you, er, my, my mother stopped and said to her many years ago, she said, you don't look your age, you don't act your age, you don't sound your age, you don't think your age, but you are your age, and this is absolutely true, as you grow older, nothing will stop the fact that your arteries get a little harder, so that, you know, that you get raised blood pressure quite easily if your agitated and you are, for some reason you, you have to puff a lot more, I was reading about this just recently, and these are changes that take place whatever you do, you can exercise, and you can take vitamins and you can keep your weight down, but you age.
*BRE:	Age, I'll fight it  (        ) .
*JEA:	Well you can fight it, I do, but you don't win all hands down  ((laugh)) .
*DAV:	Cos you see I've act  (        ) .
*JEA:	Yes, yes, but erm, you know, I have had to say to the chaps, one of them came in and he said he'd been spoiled down at the cedar   (        ) and I said oh well, I, I've been cooking a breakfast for Neil of course by the operation of sods law, Neil suddenly goes off the idea of having breakfast, so I find myself cooking breakfast for this other lump, who is as idol and selfish as anybody ever met in all the born days, and I said to him just recently, I said, I, I can't get up and do breakfast's in the morning any more, well he says he come's down and does he's own, ((laugh)) you see they can when they feel that they want too.
*DAV:	Yeah, especially when it's cold and dark you don't want it, you can have an extra half hour in bed, (        ) .
*JEA:	Well, it's, it's simple that if I got up at half past six, and took him up a cup of tea at quarter too seven, and when he was around at seven o'clock, I was grilling bacon and I was frying eggs, and I hope, I don't know whether perhaps it's my cold, but, I, I just used to feel terribly unwell after he'd gone, for about two hours and my legs were so wobbly, I was sitting down on the sofa, I may go back yet to cooking him breakfast if I feel like it, but, the, I mean if I can say to these chaps that, there are times when I don't feel like doing things, well, I reckon Dave that they are so glad to be in that house with the central heating, with the twenty four hour er, er a day water, and the comfort, there not going to argue.
*DAV:	Yeah, that's right.
*JEA:	Brenda
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	can I phone Marg?
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	Warn hear  ((laugh)) .
*DAV:	How  (        ) .
*JEA:	Er, over on number seven 'B', (        ) .
*DAV:	 (        ) .
*BRE:	No, (        ) .
*DAV:	When you got to pick Carla up?
*BRE:	Half five, I've got to do Jenny's ironing, oh there's loads of things I've gotta do   (.) never  (        ) .
*JEA:	They doom is upon the.
