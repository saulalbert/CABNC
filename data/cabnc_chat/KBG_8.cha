But it's, they seem to be in the middle of nowhere, you know, just on a piece of road where   (.) there wasn't really anything much happening, opposite the pub.
*CAR:	They might just be parking up there.
*SUS:	No, they've got a st they've got the diggers moving backwards and forwards, yeah.

*SUS:	Oh they're digging the road up, what a surprise. (.) They always dig up the road though.Where was that bungalow that you said was for sale then?You said oh that's, that's, that's on the way, on the outskirts of Fram   (.) in a close or something. (.) I still like these here, they're too near Terry though. (.) Don't suppose they'd be big enough either would they, for us now? (.)  (        ) don't ru run over Mrs   (.) 
*CAR:	It's not her.
*SUS:	Isn't it?It looked like her from the back. (.) 
*ROB:	Daddy you know the  (        ) 
*SUS:	Pardon?
*ROB:	You know the rough  (        )

*CAR:	Yeah it was.
*SUS:	I thought that.Well we'll try and get some   (.) erm   (.) we'll look down, the next time I'm down the library and look and see if they've got any   (.) Enid Blyton because that might just be a way in. (.) She was very unfashionable at one time but I remember reading and enjoying her books.
*CAR:	Yeah. (.) 
*SUS:	Alright, she might not   (.) have the most fantastic  (.) 
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	imagination but, for a plodder, it might be erm   (.) the right kind of book. (.) 
*CAR:	No I think you know when this family come out, they come out in force.
*SUS:	I know.
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) Think it's one out they're all out. (.) 
*SUS:	Er they're, they're all sort of in into erm   (.) inter-rela yes  (        ) , they're all inter-related though aren't they?Carl!
*CAR:	They have to give way Sue.
*SUS:	I know but she   (        ) she wasn't going to then.Erm   (.) only erm   (.) cos Stacey's always with them you know. (.) 
*CAR:	Well   (        ) yeah like you say they're all inter- related.
*SUS:	But erm I think 
*CAR:	They're all 
*SUS:	think she's a niece, from what I can gather.
*CAR:	Yeah they're all cousins   (        ) 
*SUS:	Dad told me, I can't remember what relation she is but she's a relation to them anyway.But she spends nearly all her time with them.
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Oh. (.) I think she's a pretty child, Stacey. (.) She's got very   (.) very pretty eyes.
*ROB:	Mummy
*SUS:	What?
*ROB:	will you remember me in a second?
*SUS:	Why?
*ROB:	No just say yes.
*SUS:	Oh yes   (        ) here, when you were laughing.
*ROB:	Will you remember in an hour?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Yes.How could I
*ROB:	Will you remember me in an hour?
*SUS:	Yes, how could I forget?
*ROB:	Will you remember me in a week?
*SUS:	Yes.
*ROB:	Will you remember me in a year?
*SUS:	Yes.
*ROB:	Will you remember me in a million years?
*SUS:	Yes.
*ROB:	Knock knock.
*SUS:	Who's there?
*ROB:	You've see you've forgotten me already!
*SUS:	 [laughing] you've forgot who I am already  [] . ((laugh)) 
*ROB:	You should say  (.) 
*SUS:	Hello Robert, shouldn't I?
*ROB:	Yes you should say hello Robert.
*SUS:	 ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	I knew that one.
*CAR:	You didn't know that!
*SUS:	I did know that.
*CAR:	No  (        ) 
*SUS:	Oh look!All the bales, they weren't there the other day.
*CAR:	What, these?
*SUS:	Well if they were, oh unless he's uncovered them.
*CAR:	These have been here for   (.) months 
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Sue.
*SUS:	Well perhaps we didn't come this way then the other day.
*CAR:	 ((laugh))  (        ) 
*SUS:	Anyway they're nice old bales though, I wouldn't mind a few of them. (.) Well I was looking out the other side cos I was trying to work out where Glynis lived.
*CAR:	You were looking at the lambs.We didn't come this way, Glynis doesn't 
*SUS:	Oh that's right.
*CAR:	live along this side.
*SUS:	No she doesn't does she? [laughing]  (        )  [] 
*CAR:	So you're not even in the right place.
*SUS:	That explains why I couldn't see where she lived.
*CAR:	That's correct. (.) 
*SUS:	That's quite nice   (.) tiles again though.
*CAR:	Yeah, nice house. (.) 
*SUS:	It makes you think of summer dunnit?You know you look out and see the sunshine and the illusion of warmth   (.) cos you're, we're in the car.
*CAR:	It's warm in the car.
*SUS:	Yeah. (.) Be nice in the summer and just put   (.) instead of doing her up in all these great big snowsuits, you know?
*CAR:	Yeah.
*SUS:	Just put a little sunfrock and T-shirt and that hat on, which I know she won't keep on.
*CAR:	Yeah.
*SUS:	And sandals   (.) and no socks, that'll be lovely. (.) I hope by then that I'll have her, you know, that she'll be dry. (.) In fact I had thought once she gets over this erm tooth coming through   (.) that I might erm start trying to potty train her.
*CAR:	Mhm.
*SUS:	See if she's interested, you know, to see if she's ready. (.) I got a few little pairs of knickers there, I'd have to get her some more though.
*CAR:	Yeah? (.) Good idea.
*SUS:	I ought to start, really   (.) really and truly I ought to start buying them in now in sort of double, double packs, you know, get two   (.) cos they're expensive to buy.Sort of three pounds for a couple of little, little pairs of knickers and that and that's a lot when you think they   (.) when she first starts she's gonna be getting through seven or eight   [laughing] pairs a day  [] .
*CAR:	I know.
*SUS:	You know, you, you sort of think well    ((laugh))  (.) have to have plenty in. (.) I've got some up in the suitcase which I can use but   (.) Oh I, I'll have a look.I, I still like the Ladybird ones best, they wash nice. (.) 
*CHR:	Andrew I will remember you   (.) remember you in the weeks   (.) all the weeks
*SUS:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	you know what?I would open the door and I would say look that's Andrew.
*SUS:	 ((laugh))  (.) Half an hour later Christopher comes up with a joke.
*CAR:	That's one way of getting the joke, [laughing] yes  [] .
*SUS:	Yeah. (.) Have you got anywhere t 
*ROB:	What's that black paper up there for mummy?
*SUS:	Where?
*ROB:	There, on the window.
*SUS:	Oh somebody took all our lovely parking ticket display off that was keeping the tas tax disk up   (.) and replaced it with black tape.It was either Nan or GrandPat. (.) Who was it?
*ROB:	I don't know. (.) 
*CAR:	Probably your dad.
*SUS:	Yeah. ((laugh))  (.) 
*ROB:	I never did it.
*SUS:	Oh I know you didn't do it. (.) 
*CAR:	Open your window a little bit Robert, let some fresh air into the back. (.) 
*ROB:	It's nice
*CAR:	Bit more. (.) 
*ROB:	ain't it?
*SUS:	Or even isn't it.
*CAR:	That's it.Good lad.
*SUS:	Speak posh sometimes. (.) We never did afford our meal did we? ((laugh))  (.) We gaily thought oh yes we'll have enough money to pay for   [laughing] a meal  [] .
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	 (        )  [laughing] we can't afford it now  [] .Never mind. (.) Maybe we should earmark   (.) perhaps my birthday, to go out.Arrange it in advance you know?
*CAR:	Mm.I don't like the thought of anybody else   (.) come to babysit though personally.
*SUS:	No   (        ) but
*CAR:	I know people keep saying oh we'll do it for you but 
*SUS:	We'll do it,we yeah I know.Well the thing is if I arrange it for May I can ring er talk to mum and see if she'll do it
*CAR:	Yeah.
*SUS:	and do it that way.I don't know what day my birthday's on this year.Oh it's still Christopher's birthday anyway   (.) didn't mean to start talking about mine, only as a means for having a meal out. ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*CAR:	Oh whee! (.) 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*SUS:	Mind if he's coughing like that   (.) erm   (.) don't know.Don't suppose I'd get in the surgery tomorrow now. (.) If it's just a cough to go with the cold then there's nothing they can do anyway, but if it's an asthmatic cough then I can give him some erm   (.) Ventolin. (.) 
*CAR:	That's what he's had before. (.) 
*SUS:	He is wheezier but  (.) 
*CAR:	He's had it for a week. (.) 
*SUS:	Mind I hadn't noticed.I must be a terrible mother, I just haven't noticed.
*CAR:	You're used to it. (.) 
*SUS:	Well   (.) He doesn't get them quite as frequently now though as he did.
*CAR:	No.
*SUS:	Not quite cos I mean at one time, when he was Christopher's age   (.) god he was never free from cold was he?We'd have a respite of about a fortnight if we were lucky before he went down with the next one.
*CAR:	Yeah  (        ) 
*SUS:	In fact I remember I took him out of school for nearly three weeks to try and  (.) 
*CAR:	Get rid of   [yawning] the bro  [] 
*SUS:	ge get his health   (.) yeah 
*CAR:	bronchial infection that he had.
*SUS:	Yeah, that's right. (.) And also because I didn't think they were doing that much there with him anyway. ((laugh)) I reckon he learnt more in that three weeks at home than he ever did there.
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SUS:	Yeah. (.)  (        ) ring up   (        ) make an appointment for Dr .He's sometimes easier to get into. (.) Chris hasn't been too bad though, his ears have been reasonable.
*CAR:	Is he still on medicine or not?
*SUS:	Well it's there.I stopped, I stopped using it, I must admit.
*CAR:	Why?
*SUS:	Well it made him drowsy for one thing, it kept knocking him out. (.) And er   (.) he could hear me perfectly well.I thought well it's there for next time. (.) Soon as th there's any   (.) slightest hint of hearing loss I can   (.)  (        ) .In a way though, perverse though it sounds, I'd rather let it get fairly bad and take him back
*CAR:	Mhm.
*SUS:	because it's only by that way that   (.) if, if he's gonna need the grommets or something in his ear   (.) then he really needs to get it sorted out this year.
*CAR:	Yeah.
*SUS:	I don't want him to start in the January and then have to be off school for three weeks because 
*CAR:	Mm.
*SUS:	he's got to go to hospital to have his ears done and things like this, you know? (.) If it's gonna plague him and give him trouble let's get it sorted out this year, even if it means that he has a little bit of temporary deafness   (.) for a little while, you know? (.)  [yawning] Oh dear   []  (.) 
*ROB:	Mummy what's the erm   (.) water tower near the erm  (.) 
*SUS:	I don't know what you mean Robert.
*ROB:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Oh erm   (.) jumbo.
*ROB:	Jumbo. (.) What's the erm    (.)  (        ) cinema next to the  (        ) ?
*SUS:	It's not a cinema it's the Mercury Theatre.
*ROB:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Where you saw the pantomime?
*ROB:	Yeah.
*SUS:	It's the Me 
*ROB:	 (        ) forgotten the name of it.
*SUS:	That's the Mercury.It's a nice theatre that. (.)  (        )  (.)  [singing]  (.) What was here before they put these up Carl?I can't remember, or was it just   (.) a bit of ground?
*CAR:	Mm. (.) 
*SUS:	Wonder if Tamsin had any luck selling her house.
*ROB:	What I don't understand   (.) is when erm   (.) she jumped into the beauty parlour door, how did erm   (        ) change so quickly?Change clothes.
*CAR:	It was somebody else Robert who was in there already.
*ROB:	Oh.
*SUS:	Yeah it's all   (.) all very clever. (.) Yes it's what pantomime's all about.Thinking on your feet, improvisation. (.) It's great.I enjoyed doing pantomime. (.) Oh I wasn't a very convincing Prince Charming though, [laughing] don't think I'd do it again  [] .
*CAR:	You did your best, had a go.
*SUS:	Had a go.Wasn't me.I'm better backstage, I'm better writing things and   (.) than on the st on the stage.I'm not enough of a strutter   (.) anyway. (.) 
*CAR:	Oh you've gotta be a poser. (.) 
*SUS:	Oh I, I enjoy  (        ) 
*CAR:	You did okay.You   (        ) 
*SUS:	I did it.Well I, I enjoyed it when I was at college, I used to enjoy drama there.
*CAR:	Not the same as putting on a big performance though is it?
*SUS:	No it's a bit different.When you put the   (.) and that's the difference about drama at college is you're doing it to please yourself   (.) and the, the group that you're in with and   (.) ultimately I suppose your tutor   (.) but when you do something like a pantomime when you're doing it to please the punters  (.) 
*CAR:	Yeah. (.) 
*SUS:	 (        )  (.) I think the bravest thing I ever did in my life was sing solo at that pantomime, I, I think that was braver than giving birth or   [laughing] having my wisdom teeth out  [] .
*CAR:	I think you sang quite well.
*SUS:	The bravest thing I ever did. ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	You sang quite well for
*SUS:	It's one of m it's one of my   (.) me memories I've erm   (.) hidden, well not hidden away but tucked away   (.) to look at in
*CAR:	In a later
*SUS:	later years, say well okay I, I haven't got   (.) a fantastic voice but I did it and that was the bravest thing I did cos I know I haven't 
*CAR:	Anna's voice isn't much better.
*SUS:	know I haven't got a fantastic voice  (        ) 
*CAR:	But you sang togeth you s complemented each other when you sang well together didn't you?
*SUS:	Yes, yeah we got on alright.
*CAR:	It was a good harmony.
*SUS:	Yeah.But we're both too feeble by ourselves   (        ) 
*CAR:	Yes.I suppose you were, but together it was good.
*SUS:	So  (.) 
*UNK:	Mummy how   (        ) join the pantomime.
*SUS:	Well I 
*CAR:	She volunteered.Mummy just said she'd have a do, she'd have a go.
*SUS:	Yeah, I said I'd have a go and before   [laughing] I knew where I was I got    []  (.) got top billing.It was nice.
*CAR:	I can never understand why you took that part though.
*SUS:	What Prince Charming?
*CAR:	Yeah.
*SUS:	Well I was offered it and I was flattered.
*CAR:	Mm.Oh yeah.
*SUS:	I was,i well I 
*CAR:	You had the talent you know.
*SUS:	Yeah but for a newcomer to be offered a er er offered a large part like that   (.) you know 
*CAR:	Well you must have had something then Sue. (.) 
*SUS:	Gift of the gab   [laughing] probably  [] . ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Cos cos they invited you back again if I remember rightly.
*SUS:	Yeah.But I did the props er on, on the next one round and then we moved, I thought, well I was pregnant anyway.But I used to quite enjoy the erm   (.) the, the shows, the s the song and dance routines, they were funny. (.) They were the, all the older ladies and that.We used to have a laugh there doing the chorus.
*CAR:	Can you see the sprayer   (        ) Chris? (.) Look.
*SUS:	I think he's asleep Carl.
*CAR:	Christopher.
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Oh move away then.
*CHR:	Look.
*SUS:	Got all that, the chemicals floating in the car haven't you?
*CHR:	That's what I want.
*SUS:	That's what I w  [laughing] Oh God  [] 
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Oh look, he said, that's what I want. (        ) 
*CAR:	Did you see it Chris?
*SUS:	He hasn't got a sprayer on has he?On his tractor.
*CAR:	No. (        ) 
*SUS:	Ah.Got just about everything else. (.) 
*CAR:	 [singing] Dee dee dee   [] Oh they've levelled all this off have they?Filled it in.Oh no, still the same.
*SUS:	Oh no .Still the same.That's where the  used to live innit? (.)  (        )  (.) 
*CAR:	Don't know where they live now.
*SUS:	They live up erm   (.) what's it called?Erm
*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	 (        ) but that's Peasenhall way. (.) I don't have much to do with them. ((sigh)) I'm glad to say.
*CAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*SUS:	I never   (.) I never minded them.It's all the   (.) the sycophants used to hang round at the school gate 
*CAR:	Oh yeah, yeah 
*SUS:	used to get on my nerves. (.) 
*CAR:	 (        ) she was very very ordinary and very very
*SUS:	Yeah, she was very na well he, he was alright 
*CAR:	shy when she came to our school.She was almost lost. (.) Felt a bit sorry for her, you know?
*SUS:	Well they they were alright
