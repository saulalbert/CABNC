*PS01B:	No . 
*PS01D:	No That 's right But I do n't know how long it is before I get my results back But you can get a post as a medical secretary in a hospital or a G P without having your full diploma If yous let it cos to get the full diploma you 've got to get your two skills which is medical audio and medical shorthand you 've got to have them two skills to get the diploma And you 've also got four papers ethics and etiquette you got an English one a medical aspects one and a clerical skills one Not a clerical skills one but office procedures And you 've got to pass all them plus your two skills to get the diploma But you can resit any what you fail the following year Mm . 
*PS01A:	Mm . 
*PS01D:	Teresa says the only one what presents any difficulty is usually the medical aspects one . 
*PS01A:	Well why should that present anything different . 
*PS01D:	Because it covers such a wide area It says the English paper you only need you only need seventy five percent for your erm it 's seventy five percent pass rate You 've got to get above seventy five to pass Yeah it 's . 
*PS01A:	That 's quite high that you know seventy five percent . 
*PS01D:	Well it 's got to be ai n't it The office procedures she said is simple anyway and yet ethics and etiquette is a she said and your teacher works you that hard and it just drills in anyway . 
*PS01A:	No but seventy five percent is a high pass rate . 
*PS01B:	Well I do n't know who she is that sends letters out to your nana but she 's bloody useless She misses more words out than she gets in And she just writes over them in in pen . 
*PS01A:	0 . 
*PS01D:	If it 's her computer though they might just erm thingy it and change it to suit them . 
*PS01A:	Well it would n't be on word processor . 
*PS01D:	You do n't know . 
*PS01A:	Cos it 's the you 're supposed to that 's what it 's for so you can check all your spellings . 
*PS01B:	A lot of them letters that come out are already done and you just delete . 
*PS01D:	Gon na say that 's they 're all on word processor that 's what I 'm saying Eh I got a pass oh I got a distinction for we did er like mock exam for word processing I got a pass . 
*PS01B:	0 . 
*PS01A:	Whatsername . 
*PS01D:	0 . 
*PS01A:	her in her the launderette were asking me er she was she were on about I ai n't you got a job yet I said I think I 'm too qualified to get a job She said we she said well aye you might be She says int your daughter i er a nice girl I said well aye sometimes . 
*PS01D:	0 . 
*PS01A:	She 's seen you in there She says what 's sh what 's she do I said oh she 's at college Oh Really I says she says er what she 's studying I said well she 's er she 's going in for medical secretary She said well where does she get her brains from . 
*PS01D:	0 . 
*PS01A:	I sa I said well who do you think I says I 'm over- qualified for work I says and it looks like she 's gon na end up that way if you 're not careful She says oh So she said I think she 's ever so pretty I says aye Said pity her manners do n't blink er mannerisms do n't match her looks . 
*PS01D:	Teresa 's on about erm a she were asking me if anybody 'd be interested into going on to higher er education after this And I . 
*PS01A:	0 . 
*PS01D:	college yet . 
*PS01A:	Yeah but you get you do n't get no grant for that . 
*PS01D:	What college But if it 's only a part-time so you can actually work part-time that 's the difference . 
*PS01A:	Yeah . 
*PS01D:	Fantastic salary if you get qualified . 
*PS01A:	It 's alright if you can get day release from your . 
*PS01B:	0 . 
*PS01A:	work to do it That 's what you want to be after day release . 
*PS01D:	Yeah They 're trying to make our course into a three day a week Erm nine till six at night . 
*PS01B:	It 's a long day though . 
*PS01D:	That 's what I said I mean . 
*PS01A:	0 . 
*PS01D:	you get we get a mental block after three three o'clock us . 
*PS01A:	You do . 
*PS01D:	I mean doing shorthand for four hours a day it 's too much It 's far too much . 
*PS01B:	Well just think when you 're working full-time you 'd be working nine till five . 
*PS01D:	I know but it 's different when you 're concentrating . 
*PS01B:	Mind you . 
*PS01D:	on studying and when you 're concentrating on working . 
*PS01B:	Billy er Billy 's one of Billy 's daughter-in-laws she she does it part-time . 
*PS01D:	What medical secretary . 
*PS01B:	Yeah She 's er . 
*PS01D:	Good money at part-time . 
*PS01B:	I know That 's what erm that 's which one of them who were it telling me Er I do n't know whether it were the young lad that comes in or whether it was Jes that were telling me . 
*PS01A:	Mhm . 
*PS01B:	I ca n't imagine it being Jes . 
*PS01D:	I think it were Jes what were telling you . 
*PS01B:	Well it might have been Jes cos I do n't know tha well they 've got I think they 've got two children And she were doing it full-time and then she went she had children and then she went part-time But I do n't think she 's working . 
*PS01D:	That 's one advantage of being medical secretary . 
*PS01B:	I think she 's just had another baby or summat . 
*PS01D:	cos if you get in a big organization like N H S they provide a creche . 
*PS01A:	Mm . 
*PS01D:	And thi I mean you do n't have to pay for the creche cos it comes in the it 's part of your . 
*PS01A:	Well . 
*PS01D:	thingy . 
*PS01A:	part of your job in n it . 
*PS01B:	It 's like nurses at hospital in n it And they 've got a hospital . 
*PS01D:	Mm Well that 's the creche what you get into . 
*PS01B:	0 . 
*PS01D:	That 's why a lot of people will go into medical secretary who have children . 
*PS01B:	Has Sue got a job at all . 
*PS01A:	0 . 
*PS01D:	I do n't know She 's not interested . 
*PS01A:	No I think she 'll be married shortly .
