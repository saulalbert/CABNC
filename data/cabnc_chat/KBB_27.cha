@Comment:	conversation #27 (Tape 049404)
*UNK:	Those Were The Days was quite good this week 
*ART:	Yes very good, is it working? 
*EVE:	Yes I think so, didn't you like it today? 
*ART:	yes 
*EVE:	didn't know about that fish, did you? 
*ART:	well I've read, I seem to remember something about it 
*EVE:	I mean you've gotta remember all those years back all those things can you? 
*ART:	mind you for yea  , when old Charles's said we crawled out the sea 
*EVE:	yes   (.) but it seemed a bit far fetched, if they said  that   
*ART:	 but any  then look at it like this 
*EVE:	if that's been caught now why hasn't that   (.) changed 
*ART:	well it's the stoppage  in evolution   
*EVE:	 well in sixty nine  or whatever 
*ART:	but, er, you look at it like this then, if we didn't crawl out of the sea and er evolve then did we just appear like a  flash of lighting   
*EVE:	 no, no  I'm not saying that we did, we did evolve   
*ART:	 oh   
*EVE:	but 
*ART:	we must evolved  somehow   
*EVE:	 why hasn't  that fish that they caught recently evolved? 
*ART:	yes, well I used to read a lot of story books, travel avidly and I think I forget all about the author and the story, but I remember one portion where they discovered a depression in the middle of a continent where it was in excess of and they'd grown quite a different specie 
*EVE:	of what  men? 
*ART:	 the human  , human's, you know  I know it's only a story   
*EVE:	 I know several stages  I know  that   
*ART:	 eh?, but er 
*EVE:	I mean there were several stages before they got to present day man, but 
*ART:	yes, but they do know,le  let's go back a bit further, but they do know at the beginning of the world most of it is water 
*EVE:	yes 
*ART:	so it's quite  feasible   
*EVE:	 oh it is   
*ART:	if, if, if it was three quarters water er human's must of been in the water to start with 
*EVE:	well not human's, but 
*ART:	well  whatever we comes   
*EVE:	 antecedence  of humans, mm   (.) I don't know 
*ART:	I mean we've still got a barren at the back, somebody kicks you at the back on that barren and er in the skeleton that's exactly like the barren in a monkey's tail 
*EVE:	mm 
*ART:	so at one time the theory is we our, we did have a tail 
*EVE:	mm  yes, but we didn't have a tail in the sea then did you? 
*ART:	 and then another thing you got   
*EVE:	fish don't have 
*ART:	fin  finger nails, well surely millions of years ago they were claws 
*EVE:	possibly 
*ART:	then you've got your two prominent teeth, they could of been the tiger's two teeth  (.)  
*EVE:	mm 
*ART:	and then there's another theory with your feet, you know that bit of skin between your toes, they claim that was web at one time 
*EVE:	well isn't, you don't know much of 
*ART:	not know, of course there's a, wears away with lack of use, but when you're in the water you want web feet because  there   
*EVE:	 yeah   
*ART:	the water I'll go through your fingers 
*EVE:	mm, mm 
*ART:	this, this skin here 
*EVE:	 yeah I know that   
*ART:	 it's not pronounced in mine  , but, some er they say that with where it's gone away, you know, there's all sorts of things that can prove it   (.) I mean the obvious thing is we came from somewhere didn't we?, we didn't just drop here with a flash of light   (.) and er they've studied plants and other animals and they evolved. 
*EVE:	Yes, but plants evolved with men's, man's 
*ART:	I hope that they, they had  had on their own for   
*UNK:	  (  )  
*ART:	a million years, the plants did 
*EVE:	I don't know, probably several hundred million years   (.) mm, can't really understand them   (.) can you? 
*ART:	well, you'd go mad if you tried wouldn't ya?, like that man said the other week, er, you, human's invented god, well they did didn't they? 
*EVE:	mm, did you take that tape out in the other room? 
*ART:	yeah, to cut, cut a in that 
*EVE:	 oh did you know   
*ART:	 and the other thing   
*EVE:	do you know where it is  because it in't in this   
*ART:	 yes I left it there to call off   
*EVE:	oh I see 
*ART:	well if I've left it there to call off I'm not gonna put it in the case and  shove it away   
*EVE:	 well  I know, well you want to label it so you know what's on it   (.) just reminding you, you say, oh you'll say you didn't remind me to write it down 
*ART:	yes cos you always right, you remind me at the wrong time and the wrong thing 
*EVE:	no I don't 
*ART:	yes you do   (.) oh I was gonna say something, you put me off now 
*EVE:	mm, I'm always putting you off, I put myself off   (.) you don't concentrate. 
*ART:	well you're alr  the, point it's greater the things they find it, that er three quarter of the world were water once 
*EVE:	yes I know, you said that, you going to have the Antiques Roadshow at 
*ART:	and then there's another thing, yeah, if you like, another thing Evelyn, you know when they give these rock,foss  fossils out of rocks 
*EVE:	yes 
*ART:	big sand stone rocks, they find things that fish today er had, had got other pediments that million years back, same thing, but not, not, not the same as they are today, you know, well they must of got hold of it to be different from a million years ago 
*EVE:	mm 
*ART:	those shell fish things they're always on about in they get out the rocks 
*EVE:	five thirty Antiques Roadshow   (.) on B B C one, it's in Cleethorpes 
*ART:	ten minutes then 
*EVE:	huh, from Cleethorpes   (.) I shouldn't think they'd get much from there, oh they might get some ships might they? 
*ART:	yes  don't   
*EVE:	 they  might get, erm 
*ART:	true, then there's another thing about religion I've often wondered, they say you go to heaven don't they? well, so well   
*EVE:	 well, no   
*ART:	no, but some sort of place, well when, when you look at these pictures now, the satellites been going twelve months, still going  through   
*EVE:	 two or  three years 
*ART:	well where's heaven then in all that lot? 
*EVE:	no 
*ART:	and how'd, how'd ya get there when you're dead? 
*EVE:	well you don't, that's just 
*ART:	well then, why do they carry it all on? 
*EVE:	well they don't really so much today, people 
*ART:	yes, but you talked, listened to a parson on telly, he's convinced what he's saying true, yet it's only what he's been told in it? 
*EVE:	mm  (.)  
*ART:	with all this killing of children and that and burning them alive with flame throwers, what, what if this higher, high of command, why don't he interfere 
*EVE:	there isn't  (.)  
*ART:	he did in my case 
*EVE:	 ((laughing)) what'd ya mean?, huh  
*ART:	well wait in the Cathedral and out 
*EVE:	 ((laughing)) and prayed  
*ART:	and prayed, when you left me 
*EVE:	don't be silly   (.) didn't really leave you   (.) you were just being stubborn weren't you?, still are. (.)  
*ART:	Did Ken a member of church he didn't did he? 
*EVE:	Ken, no, no he always went, not church, chapel you know  he did   
*ART:	 oh  did Tom leave? 
*EVE:	no me dad used to say he was an atheist when he was courting Madge 
*ART:	oh they don't, he don't believe in it now I don't think 
*EVE:	and yet, yet, the children went to chapel 
*ART:	mm 
*EVE:	come 
*UNK:	  (  )  
*UNK:	  (  )  
*ART:	 but I mean I went to a church school   
*EVE:	 well probably Madge, Madge sort of  
*ART:	well obviously they were going to teach me religion weren't they? 
*EVE:	in a church school, yes. 
*ART:	but you know the breaking up day for the summer holidays and Christmas 
*EVE:	mm 
*ART:	the vicar used to come and sit at the back and, you know, they used to do a little turn, you know play in the bands 
*EVE:	mm  end of term   
*ART:	 wanted that  old  , is it, the rag and bone people, you know, rubbish, and er I suppose somebody taught him and er he, he played in that and er you know did the little towns and the vic  the vicar used to come and sit at the back, a seat under against, under the window and watch, perhaps he thought he'd er  get some little co    
*EVE:	 well I expect  if it was a church school they had to put in appearance  odd times  . 
*ART:	 er, yes  . (.)  
*EVE:	No Madge, Madge must of sent the children to chapel 
*ART:	mm 
*EVE:	I don't think Tom probably approved, but she   (.) well actually when they used to come to us on Sunday I used to take them to er, to Belver Fall   (.) me and David, Thelma's husband and he's er, his father was a superintendent   (.) so, do you want any tea? 
*ART:	er, only ice cream if there's any 
*EVE:	yes, you didn't have any yesterday did ya? 
*ART:	not  bothered about it really   
*EVE:	 yes, there's  plenty of ice cream, do you want it now? 
*ART:	no any time 
*EVE:	later   (.) do you want any cake?, sandwich? 
*ART:	 no it's just   
*EVE:	 I've got some ham   
*ART:	 after Christ   after Christmas pudding and chicken thank you 
*EVE:	I know, but years ago you always used to have a big tea  and supper   
*ART:	 yes, so now  were all digging and sawing and  (.)  
*EVE:	I mean   (.) I, I know you're not doing any thing very active, well nobody is this time of year, but still, I've got some nice ham 
*ART:	no, still full up from the last 
*EVE:	still full up 
*ART:	almost if I'd ate it you know, about half an hour ago 
*EVE:	yeah, perhaps about seven, mm, or no? 
*ART:	this   (.) had a cup of coffee you know and 
*EVE:	cocoa  I've always liked it   
*ART:	 yeah, yes  I mean cocoa or summat like that 
*EVE:	before the war

*ART:	not really, no 
*EVE:	oh you always used  to have   
*ART:	 yeah, they  gave you high, what they called a high tea 
*EVE:	oh 
*ART:	their high tea, weren't bothered about high tea, but still, er then, they'd have, they might have a supper because she ain't been a work, their elderly, they perhaps have a good tea,the  they, they went to bed at nine and they said if I was reading something, they said, you know turn the gas out when you come up and, there you are   (.) well you can see, if one landlady gave me egg for me lunch that I hadn't had, they not, they weren't gonna feed you up at supper time were they?
