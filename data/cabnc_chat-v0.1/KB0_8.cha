*NOE:	Now  so much more time has been released for us  to be the church  but at the same time we have nowhere to hide  and nothing to blame! •113010_114171•
        It has meant, that churches  need to be bold  and be young  or a threat to what we belong to  as the edges between church and  and community have blurred  we are now much more vulnerable. •114372_115937•
        Somebody said, like a tortoise without a shell. •116030_116290•
        And we need a greater trust in God. •116439_116654•
        It has also meant a greater love for one another as we can share our faith  and come face to face with who we are. •116867_117720•
*UNK:	I'm glad that Pat used the word  exciting  but all the story you've heard this morning are exciting! •118010_118659•
        But, it does Pat, doesn't it  also danger! •118702_118989•
        It also means fear, it also means pain. •118989_119291•
        I don't know no any more what church is  I don't know any more and I'm supposed to come this morning and help to discover what unity is! •119476_120218•
        It blurred so much  and in the blurring  we have discovered our own vulnerabilities. •120377_120890•
        And having raised our banners of church  proudly  a change is all    what changes should have been! •121007_121730•
        I see now narrow mindedness  I see the deathedness I see suspicion of other communities  I see jealousies. •121788_122313•
        However, I am discovering that the church  probably not the community  but more a communion  and that's perhaps an answer to what Nanette  ? •122450_123411•
        Or within the communion of our Lord Jesus Christ  in word and sacrament  and that living out of his love is his body  and finding community. •123660_124520•
        Communion  actually the Holy Communion  has become so much more important to us  and so much more exciting to us  because we're not just celebrating the living Christ  we're also celebrating the crucified Christ  and we're simply meeting our pain and our joys  together  in communion with him. •124617_126409•
        I once watched a film on the telly  it was a pretty crap film really! •126670_127245•
        It was American  no, sorry it's not! •127330_127741•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	See  yes  the thing about community . •127847_128155•
        It was a simple story, and I would of forgotten it  er, about a woman struggling to bring up a family in a depression. •128159_129181•
        The story was that her husband in the deep south  was killed by some young hoodlums who were black. •129291_129855•
        She was left to bring up a family  she had to go the banks for money  the banks were all   and they refused her money  to keep the farm going. •129973_131020•
        She took on a black lad  and because she did that she was ostracised from the rest of the community. •131130_131699•
        He eventually was driven off the farm  but the respectable white people who went to church. •131878_132429•
        The story, of course, was a happy ending, that she struggled on and she did it. •132563_132947•
        But for some strange reason, and I don't know whether they direct it to Christian  the last shot of the film, almost unnoticeable because the credits were going up  she went back into church  and it was a communion service  and all you saw was her receiving the bread and passing the plate  and the plate was to the young black lad on the farm  and you thought, he's come back! •132947_135691•
        But then, no  he passed the plate then  to the woman's husband  who had been killed! •135871_136534•
        And then the plate was passed from him to his murderer  and it was passed round until it was passed to the bank manager who wouldn't give her the money  and then back to her. •136670_137726•
        And somehow, but I can't explain it  in that moment  that what community's about  it's about the not yet  as well your . •137879_138691•
        About the journey  being on  and the reconciliation , of them . •138849_139242•
        And that's where we are   and  this morning. •139345_140485•
