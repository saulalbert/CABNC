@Comment:	conversation #12 (Tape 073905)
*JOH:	That way they're saving money on a night out, they're gonna save on er actual depot hours, where it's like taking us sort of like ten and eleven hours, it's only gonna take them eight, nine to do that   (.) cos they're there, they're on top of the job.
*JAN:	Mm, either way though, I mean the thing is if they do, you, you would be in for a little bit of something, if you hung it out till be, to being redundant
*JOH:	Yeah, but I mean it's like, it's 
*JAN:	but having said that   (        ) 
*JOH:	if ifs were ands, and ands were swings 
*JAN:	Yeah, then you I know, but John I mean you'd be up for a good couple of grand if you did stick it out.
*JOH:	I don't know.
*JAN:	You would  (.) 
*JOH:	Two grand's not everything Jane, you know that and I know that
*JAN:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	what, what I propose to do anyway if it's agreeable to you
*JAN:	Hand it in and see what happens.
*JOH:	give 'em a go, let's go and sit and listen to what the bloke says
*JAN:	Mm

*JOH:	he might turn round and say I'm sorry Mr  you're not suitable, alright, I've not lost nothing
*JAN:	mm
*JOH:	you just had, you've just had a bloody, you've had a   (        ) off work  (        ) 
*JAN:	The thing is I mean if you turn round and just say to them well they're messing about with all the hours we've put it down to the erm
*JOH:	Recession.
*JAN:	recession, but it's just the, I think it's just a bloody good excuse to streamline a company that's 
*JOH:	Oh it is 
*JAN:	you know I mean they, they do don't they, they overstaff and then they've got to cut back.
*JOH:	Look at look at Llandudno
*JAN:	Mm.
*JOH:	one of the factories, they're shutting it
*JAN:	Yeah but 
*JOH:	and where're they moving it?It's going 
*JAN:	yeah, but when 
*JOH:	to Creda.
*JAN:	when was it built all them factories it was built in the seventies when the boom was in 
*JOH:	I agree, I agree, yes I agree, that factory's old, it's out of date, it wants a lot of modifying
*JAN:	so now there's
*JOH:	so they've got
*JAN:	it's just a good excuse to streamline
*JOH:	yes
*JAN:	all the staff.
*JOH:	yeah, you see Creda now at   (        ) are already making some of the washer driers, that Llandudno used to make.
*JAN:	Mm, what gets me is how Creda they're gonna, they're, they're coming up in the pink and 
*JOH:	They've got job security Jane
*JAN:	But why haven't Hotpoint, the original Hotpoint drivers, I mean Hotpoint is the bigger firm
*JOH:	Yeah, but having saying that 
*JAN:	Hotpoint take over Creda 
*JOH:	Yeah
*JAN:	where are all Hotpoint's drivers?
*JOH:	it's like, yeah but it's like, it's like any big conglomeration int it, if, if I was to buy you out as a company you're gonna   (        ) 
*JAN:	You'd have to keep me sweet 
*JOH:	you're, you're gonna say to him well there's conditions attached to this
*JAN:	Mm
*JOH:	I've, I've, those lads have served me well
*JAN:	mm
*JOH:	I want them looking after, and cou and you're gonna, I'm gonna say to you 
*JAN:	 (        ) you're gonna go to your ordinary man
*JOH:	I'm gonna say to you yeah, alright, I'm, I 
*JAN:	thank you 
*JOH:	you're thinking long-term, yeah I can do this and then when it, a gentleman's agreement and then it comes to paper, and when that paper's signed you're stuck with it
*JAN:	Yeah
*JOH:	and I tell you what, this is, this is what I think's happened
*JAN:	Probably has, yeah.
*JOH:	being truthful   (.) do you know what I think'll go next?
*JAN:	What?Manchester?
*JOH:	the double holiday pay
*JAN:	Yeah I was thinking that actually 
*JOH:	and the profit sharing 
*JAN:	well the thing is they've 
*JOH:	I   (        ) 
*JAN:	gone down anyway on the basic rate
*JOH:	d'ya know they've, well this is it, the profit sharing and the holiday pay as you say they've   (        ) 
*JAN:	 (        ) yeah
*JOH:	d'ya know the profit sharing's up to thirty one percent, thirty one hours up to now and there's another one, another one to go in yet
*JAN:	Is that good or bad?I mean I don't know very much about 
*JOH:	It's better than what we had at Christmas
*JAN:	How come?How come?
*JOH:	I don't know, but they tell us that they're not flogging anything
*JAN:	Mm, just a good excuse int it?
*JOH:	so who's, who's who's telling porkies here?
*JAN:	That is it John   (.) that's it   (.) thing I, I mean the thing that I can't understand you've, you've always been

*JAN:	No you've always done what they said alright everybody has 
*JOH:	I've always, I might've had a little moan, but I've always   (        ) to myself 
*JAN:	Yeah, but everybody does, yeah but everybody has a, in your job John everybody's entitled to a bit of a moan
*JOH:	I've never done it in the office, I've always gone, I've always probably gone in the canteen or in the of in the, in the wagon thing

*JOH:	Yeah 
*JAN:	not getting a new motor?
*JOH:	that's what he turned round and told me.
*JAN:	Did you ask him why?
*JOH:	Well what can I say to him Jane, it's his property, he put, he gives the motors to who he wants, he's, he's the transport manager, I can't argue with him.
*JAN:	I know, it's not fair though is it?I'm cutting these steaks in half John, cos we've got one fatty one and one that's alright.
