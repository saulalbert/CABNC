*PS05X:	And erm they 've got some new system of a little plastic card which they stick into the machine each time .  798885_806905
*PS107:	so they give you a credit .  807035_808365
*PS05X:	It well it notches up points for Argos .  808615_811185
*PS107:	Well I bet you Argos .  811385_813625
*PS05X:	Oh are they .  815455_816005

*PS05X:	Oh I see .  816385_816875
*PS107:	Yeah .  816875_817005
*PS05X:	Yes .  817265_817395
*PS107:	When you 've saved up a card I do n't know how many there are in it you got a pound worth of gifts at .  817775_821315
*PS05X:	It it 's all rather ironic when you think that Argos grew out of Green Shield .  821865_825225
*PS107:	Yes yes that 's right .  825745_827925
*PS05X:	It 's it 's the same system eventually is n't it .  827925_829945
*PS107:	It is yes With Green Shield Stamps it 's amazing how quickly they went out just like that did n't they .  829945_836525
*PS05X:	Yes I believe what did it was Tesco 's them out .  836525_842225
*PS107:	Ah .  842775_843245
*PS05X:	Tesco were the grocery chain and the Green Shield Stamps and it was the kiss of death for Green Shield when they did that .  843555_851155
*PS107:	Did they pull out .  851155_851895
*PS05X:	They staggered on for a year or two after that but Tesco 's had a big big change of policy they were no longer high and kick them out cheap they decided to promote a quality in which stamps did not go for and erm .  852105_862565
*PS107:	You can get Green Shield Stamps again in some garages ca n't you .  864065_867925
*PS05X:	I do n't know .  867925_868215
*PS107:	I 'm sure I thought the one down the bottom did Green Shield or is that something else they do .  868215_871865
*PS05X:	I I do n't that 's ahead of us you mean .  873215_875035
*PS107:	No just here There it is .  875035_875875
*PS05X:	Yeah oh really .  875875_876185
*PS107:	You 'll have that recorded on your er .  888995_892625
*PS05X:	Yes yes .  892625_893135
*PS107:	Any noise .  893135_893325
*PS05X:	I I pity the poor typist has to transcribe this as and when if it happens ha ha she 's going to get some very strange noises including me having a pee and flushing the loo before lunch what have you I forgot to switch it off .  893495_904025
*PS107:	So you obviously ca n't edit it can you or you should n't it 'll be pointless .  905655_909035
*PS05X:	Well I I can I mean if if somebody erm objects to the fact that being recorded and let's say erm private business meeting or something in that sense .  909035_917835
*PS107:	Oh that that switches off completely .  917835_919155
*PS05X:	That 's right .  919155_919745
*PS107:	Yes .  919765_919975
*PS05X:	That 's right .  919975_920445
*PS107:	Presumably .  920525_920735
*PS05X:	But if somebody and they say to you try try not to tell people in advance because it inhibits them I I 'm not at all certain about that but still erm .  920735_929465
*PS107:	Some people might object to it .  929465_931525
*PS05X:	But if people object when you tell them afterwards you 're at liberty to erase and so .  931525_936315
*PS107:	Yes .  936565_936625
*PS05X:	on and so forth so .  936625_937805
*PS107:	you tend to tell them first .  937805_940255
*PS05X:	Well not necessarily sometimes I do n't tell them at all or they comment on it and I explain it 's a but it 's only been yesterday and today you see really .  940255_947445
*PS107:	Yeah .  947445_947625
*PS05X:	They they asked that it be done on a Friday and a Saturday and that they appeared on Thursday with it erm I 'm getting on with it It was quite entertaining yesterday today 's becoming a bit of a bore because the tapes only last forty five minutes so you 've got to .  947625_967325
*PS107:	Course yes .  967325_967555
*PS05X:	change change over and change the tapes and all that sort of thing and erm they give you packets of batteries and your supposed to change the batteries every two to three tapes every four sides in other words So you 're fiddling around with it and that .  967885_982685
*PS107:	Yes yes .  982945_983595
*PS05X:	It 's a proper Sony Walkman .  986095_987085
*PS107:	Yes .  987085_987515
*PS05X:	It 's certainly good quality recording .  988085_989345
*PS107:	Mm I 've just got it hooked on the mouth here you see .  989355_992935
*PS05X:	Oh it is yes Make the exercise worthwhile .  993175_996655
*PS107:	Mm Cos language does change does n't it I mean .  996655_1000685
*PS05X:	Very much so yes .  1000685_1001365
*PS107:	words certainly do go out you forget when you go to use a word that has n't been in use sometime and the younger person says to you what does that mean .  1001365_1009155
*PS05X:	Yes indeed .  1009585_1010385
*PS107:	Words with the old coinage have completely gon well not completely gone but they do n't have the same meaning do they .  1010385_1017265
*PS05X:	I can remember several years ago bringing in a seventeen year old baby sitter to sit with Susannah and I heard thirty bob .  1017335_1024685
*PS107:	Yes .  1024725_1024955
*PS05X:	And she said well what 's is it She had not a clue .  1025195_1030165
*PS107:	No .  1030265_1030725
*PS05X:	Not a clue .  1030875_1031685
*PS107:	Well I suppose like that it 's not worth tuppence really .  1031685_1034595
*PS05X:	Yes .  1034845_1035045
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	But they will say two pence these days wo n't they Not tuppence .  1035265_1040645
*PS107:	Yeah not tuppence No .  1040645_1041915
*PS05X:	And and look at you as if you 're an old fogey if you say tuppence I expect And do you remember as a child people used to talk of four and twenty and five and twenty past .  1042605_1052035
*PS107:	Yes .  1052035_1052575
*PS05X:	That 's totally disappeared has n't it .  1052775_1054635
*PS107:	Yes I I mean they talk about twenty past the hour twenty to four .  1054635_1058125
*PS05X:	Yes but instead of twenty five past they 've said five and twenty past .  1058125_1062065
*PS107:	They did .  1062065_1062355
*PS05X:	quite often .  1062355_1062655
*PS107:	yes .  1062655_1063195
*PS05X:	And eh curious twist that .  1063905_1067735
*PS107:	Yes I I think really that 's why it 's a lot easier to read the time on an analogue display than it is on a digital display You virtually have to read that and register it .  1067735_1076215
*PS05X:	That 's right and the point really is with time you 're not interested that it 's two twenty four .  1076215_1080555
*PS107:	No .  1080555_1080905
*PS05X:	You are are am I early .  1080905_1082975

*PS107:	you glance at your watch and discover that it 's not half past is n't it .  1087125_1089705
*PS05X:	That that 's right you 've still got time or you 'd better get a move on it 's that sort of reaction that your brain makes is n't it .  1089705_1095195
*PS107:	You 're not really worried about the time to the last minute I mean .  1095195_1098785
*PS05X:	No .  1098785_1098905
*PS107:	twenty five past is nearer .  1099135_1100235
*PS05X:	That 's right that 's right I I tend to keep my watch to the minute if I possibly can but that 's bad habit or really habit from the days when I was catching trains every day and I 'd never caught a train with any time to spare erm .  1100235_1114775
*PS107:	Well with watch they do n't They do n't very much anyway do they Or yours do .  1116095_1122125
*PS05X:	Mine 's a good old fashioned proper mechanical wind up job yes .  1122135_1128155
*PS107:	Wind up yes .  1128435_1129095
*PS05X:	My father gave it to me for my seventeenth birthday .  1129095_1130665
*PS107:	Oh really and you still wear it daily .  1130735_1132715
*PS05X:	I do indeed yes yes it 's the only watch I own and it 's the only watch I 've ever had no no that 's true er not true I should say I 've got a half hunter .  1132715_1141015
*PS107:	Yes .  1141035_1141365
*PS05X:	Which eh if I put this in for cleaning or .  1141765_1143815
*PS107:	That 's unusual is n't it because I always think I mean I this is really only about the second watch I 've ever had good one First good watch I had was for my twenty first I 've still got it still goes .  1143965_1159595
*PS05X:	Yes .  1159655_1159885
*PS107:	quite well .  1160265_1160835
*PS05X:	yes Well my father was a commercial traveller in jewellery silver ware .  1161535_1167185
*PS107:	Oh was he .  1167185_1167745
*PS05X:	watches and this is actually one of his samples .  1167745_1169985
*PS107:	Yeah .  1169985_1170315
*PS05X:	And this is a Sotino which is a quality brand in those days I I do n't know if it still is I assume it is erm which was not advertised at all and although the Rolex 's and so on in this world have been heavily advertised as they came on the market Sotino 's never really was so my father had a struggle I suspect selling .  1170765_1195695
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Yeah .  1195695_1196055
*PS107:	Where do you take it when it needs erm there are n't that many places are there .  1196855_1202615
*PS05X:	No there are n't I had it done last year at erm oh what 's it called Sidcup .  1202615_1206265
*PS107:	Oh I know .  1209595_1211825
*PS05X:	Do you know the .  1211825_1214175
*PS107:	Yes little tiny place .  1214495_1215621
*PS05X:	Beyond the station .  1215621_1215951
*PS107:	yes .  1215951_1216111
*PS05X:	yes tiny little place and it was it was n't totally satisfactory initially in that they erm they left it with some sort of erm cock up I could n't wind it up there was something wrong with the crown click or something of the sort when I got it back so I had to take it back again but otherwise they seemed to be people who are well aware of watches in the best sense and eh he said this is a an excellent movement and eh far better than the ones I normally see .  1216111_1250541
*PS107:	Mm .  1250541_1250861
*PS05X:	Erm but I mean it does n't look very special does it But absolutely everything of course other than the movement changed since I was seventeen .  1251381_1258611
*PS107:	Yes .  1258611_1259031
*PS05X:	New case new dial new hands new everything .  1259331_1261321
*PS107:	Really .  1261481_1262121
*PS05X:	And and I suspect that 'll be jolly difficult to get that sort of thing done these days .  1262241_1265721
*PS107:	I think a new face would be very expensive .  1265851_1268751
*PS05X:	Mm mm Oh yes but I I think as I recall I got it without too without too much trouble But I mean going back to the fact it 's my one and only watch I should think Susannah has had eight or ten watches .  1269091_1285051
*PS107:	I I think people must do because the number of them that are sold .  1285301_1288171
*PS05X:	She she looks upon them as a thoroughly disposable commodity .  1288171_1291071
*PS107:	Yes yeah .  1291071_1291771
*PS05X:	Five or ten pounds is the price that has to be paid for them and they last six months and they move on to the next extraordinary approach .  1292791_1300801
*PS107:	They use Swatch watches do n't you .  1300971_1304171
*PS05X:	Yes yes she 's she 's had she 's had one of those and I have n't seen that for a long time She 's got some stupid thing at the moment with with a flip top of Thomas the Tank Engine .  1304221_1312921
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	0 . 
*PS107:	When Stephanie 's mother died we found in the bungalow a watch it must of been given I would of thought to her father probably for his twenty first and I took it to a jewellers in Elton well that 's all he does is watches actually apart from jewellery .  1313661_1329381
*PS05X:	Yes yes .  1329541_1329951
*PS107:	And eh he seemed very knowledgeable I mean we got a job to find him he has n't actually got a shop he 's just got a premises .  1330051_1336931
*PS05X:	Oh yeah .  1337051_1337951
*PS107:	It 's the place that if you take your watch into the average shop they take it to him I think .  1337951_1343501
*PS05X:	I see yes yes oh next time I need one I shall ask you then .  1343501_1347431
*PS107:	Yes he was very knowledgeable very helpful .  1347431_1350161
*PS05X:	Mm Mm .  1350161_1350801
*PS107:	Eh .  1350801_1350921
*PS05X:	Yes in somewhere like that it 's not a place you leave your .  1351201_1362901
*PS107:	Oh .  1362901_1363021
*PS05X:	watch in confidence is it .  1363061_1364071
*PS107:	gosh no I mean all they do now these days is sell them they do n't repair them .  1364071_1367281
*PS05X:	That 's right that 's right yes .  1367281_1368591
*PS107:	that 's a slight mistake to call them jewellers cos they 're not really that at all are they .  1368671_1384751
*PS05X:	Yes yes I know even even Ratner himself called them tat or .  1384751_1388111
*PS107:	Yeah .  1388111_1388441
*PS05X:	crap or something did n't he .  1388931_1390001
*PS107:	He did that to get publicity cos in fact they found that it was n't eh rubbish he was selling in there .  1390001_1395541
*PS05X:	Well it it at least it 's gold I mean I I I was in the jewellery trade when I first left school between school and national service I worked at a manufacturing jewellers in Birmingham and I 've never really gone along with the idea that nine carat is actually gold If something is only three eights .  1395591_1412271
*PS107:	Yes .  1412271_1412851
*PS05X:	gold how can you call it gold .  1413421_1415891
*PS107:	Yes .  1415891_1416331
*PS05X:	The essence of is copper alloy it 's got more than fifty percent copper in it .  1416331_1420261
*PS107:	Yes .  1420261_1420321
*PS05X:	That 's the way I always thought and if it 's only got thirty seven and a half percent of gold in it how on earth can you call it gold .  1420321_1426681
*PS107:	So nine carat is only .  1426681_1428171
*PS05X:	It 's nine twenty fourths Pure gold is twenty four carat .  1428171_1431481
*PS107:	Ah yes of course it is .  1431481_1432541
*PS05X:	So you get nine carat which is thirty seven and a half eighteen carat which is seventy five percent and twenty two which is ha ha ha whatever it is .  1432541_1440811
*PS107:	Yeah .  1440811_1441001
*PS05X:	A little over ninety per cent I suppose and erm I 'm not sure if you got fourteen or fifteen carat so fourteen I think is used with the continental standard and the lowest continental standard now are fifteen used to be our inbetween standard very rarely used .  1441851_1456641
*PS107:	But nine and eighteen are the most common in this country .  1456641_1460911
*PS05X:	Yes they are yes definitely .  1460911_1461911
*PS107:	The trouble is the more you get the more is the softer is the jewellery .  1462381_1466011
*PS05X:	That 's that 's true eh I mean the alloy in the other ones have to be quite crafty when you get up to twenty two carat for example and eh very eh eh large chunk of gold in it and it can indeed be very soft but then you see that 's an eighteen carat ring that I 've had for worn all the time for twenty four years .  1466011_1486961
*PS107:	Yes .  1486961_1487501
*PS05X:	and it really was pretty much like that when I had it so eh it 's probably a bit more rounded than it was .  1488431_1492791
*PS107:	Yes yes .  1492791_1493731
*PS05X:	So they they do last .  1494071_1495171
*PS107:	Yeah Oh yes because rings come in to quite a bit of wear do n't they .  1495171_1500911
*PS05X:	Yes oh yes yes yes no with doubt I had one repaired for Susannah it had been left to her by an aunt and she had managed to smash it against a post or something and broke the shank and knocked out one of the erm stones so on and so forth and eh together with some repairs on a charm bracelet I had to pay thirty seven pounds for the whole jolly lot .  1501031_1529611
*PS107:	Did you really yes yes But it 's I think when you look at the cost of labour these days it 's not surprising any sort of repairs are expensive .  1529611_1538891
*PS05X:	It 's very true .  1538891_1539961
*PS107:	They 've got to pay for the premises .  1539961_1541321
*PS05X:	Yes .  1541321_1541621
*PS107:	and eh .  1541621_1541901
*PS05X:	yes absolutely .  1542151_1542771
*PS107:	It 's a fairly well it is a skilled trade is n't it .  1543081_1546391
*PS05X:	And I took it to the people up on Royal Parade who are constantly having burglaries no that 's that 's true they have had several quite chunky burglaries .  1546391_1554381
*PS107:	Mm .  1554471_1555111
*PS05X:	and erm eh they have must be absolutely horrific you have to pay for all that sort of thing do n't you .  1555111_1564711
*PS107:	Yes of course you do yes .  1564711_1566291
