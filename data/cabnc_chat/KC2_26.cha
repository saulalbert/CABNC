*CLI:	 (  ) . During the war   (.) the princess or the queen of that area   (.) and all her   (  ) and everything, they all left. They just abandoned it. And the place has been left ever since and they just look after it. If you step inside it's really   (.) ooh 
*DAV:	 (  ) ? 
*CLI:	No no, these are, these are not waterfalls. They're all steps dad. There's about   (.) twelve steps. And in each step as you walk along it, and it's a, it's a goldfish pond. ((cough))

*UNK:	 (  ) Well it don't matter. I've gotta find where they were though first. Where were they?  (.) Which one did I have them in? This one.  (.) That's   (.) This is a place   (.) now from Tony's   (  ) on some of those photos you're looking at when he was in the garden   (  ) see the mountains. This is a place called  (  ) . It's a mountain that you can see, one of these four mountains. Now this is,Rocetta is the first campsite that Hannibal had when he went through the alps with his el  elephants. 
*UNK:	Oh. Oh. 
*CLI:	 (  ) if you like.  (.) And we went up there, oh dear, driving up there you're going up on this little tiny   (  ) when you've got a big car. Like this. Little tiny road about this wide, you go round a corner and you think your wheel's gonna fall down the side and then you meet somebody coming down. Ooh it's   (.) horrifying. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*CLI:	Oh it's, it is, it's lovely. I shall de  I shall go back. Driving through Italy is an experience.  (.) You know I mean they're terrible drivers. 
*FLO:	Well yeah they've got a reputation haven't they? (  )  
*CLI:	Well they  (  ) . Now you've got   (.) I mean the autostradas that they build aren't as good as, as, nowhere near as good as the autobahns in er   (  ) in Germany and through th  you know, Switzerland and that. I mean Switzerland   (  ) in Switzerland the roads are  (  ) . You get into Italy  (  ) . You've gotta pay to go through, all these tolls   (.) which we did okay cos what we done we bought a pack which gave us    (.)  (  ) petrol coupons. And got money back, the ones we didn't use    (  )   
*FLO:	  (  )  
*CLI:	We used all our time, we ended up having to pay in the end. It's only about like a pound 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*CLI:	But when it rained, going down   (.) I mean going down it rained so much I thought we'd never, never even going to get there. I mean the car stopped once. Went through water this deep   (.)  (  ) .  (.) I went to   (.) erm the guy I work with is a Belgian and I was invited to his birthday party.  (  ) In Munchengladback  (  ) the Belgians   (  ) community  (  ) . And er this man, Patrick, his m  parents came up and his mother started talking to me. And I was trying to explain something to her in German. (  )  
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. 
*MAR:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. 
*MAR:	 (  )   ((laugh))  
*FRE:	  ((laugh))

*MAR:	 (  ) was about   (  ) maybe twelve degrees.  (  ) she were drinking, it's called Trappiste And the beer was from eight to degrees to si  sixteen degrees. 
*FRE:	Ooh. 
*MAR:	And she was  (  )  
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. 
*MAR:	But er the blokes were looking at her  (  )  
*FRE:	 ((laughing))  (  ) just sitting there   (  )  
*MAR:	Yeah. It looks like this,Trappiste A bit sharper in the colour but  (  )  
*FRE:	Yeah. 
*MAR:	Ooh. 
*FRE:	I like   (  ) given it up now.  (  ) British 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	 (  ) during the day. 
*MAR:	It's not too bad, Germany but I mean it's not as good as    (  )   
*FRE:	  (  )  No it ain't. Ooh. 
*MAR:	But I would like to  (  )  
*FRE:	Yeah, very nice  (  ) . 
*CLI:	But erm   (.) when the weather's 
*FLO:	Oh yeah, pretty place that isn't it? 
*CLI:	 fine  yes it's a lovely place. 
*DAV:	How did you find Tony? Is he er  coping? 
*CLI:	Well he weren't too bad dad but he's been really poorly. I think he   (.) I think he does  too much. 
*MAR:	 He  he worries too much. 
*CLI:	Yeah but he  does too much as well. He does loads of jobs. 
*MAR:	 No, he worries about not worrying.  You say to him don't worry about it. You know, it'll be alright just   (.) have a good time. But he doesn't, he worries 
*FLO:	 Where is that  ? 
*MAR:	 (.)  about not worrying. I mean, you know, what   (.) what can you do about it? 
*CLI:	 That's Monte Casino  Oh if you've heard of Monte Casino . Well it's a place in Italy  where the Germans tried to take it. 
*FRE:	 You're best not worry   (  )   
*MAR:	But you see with him being ill, he worries about not being able to bring money in. You know, to the family. And Philomena says well it's alright you you're ill. You can't bring it in. So she works and the, the two kids work and they get by and there's no problem.  (.) But erm he does, he he worries a lot and I think that's half his trouble. 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. 
*DAV:	Is it the er   (.) is it the family house? You know a 
*MAR:	No erm   (.) they sold Philomena's family out. But   (.) when she was over here, she sold up and her sister sold up at the same time. And they went back and they bought this really big house, well   (.) it wasn't a house it was a shell. Just you know, floorboards and a roof. And they've converted it to two flats. Philomena and Tony live upstairs and the sister lives downstairs. And it's   (.) three big bedrooms er   (.) a small kitchen. There's a, a living room and a lounge. Big bathroom and toilet you know, and verandah   (.) To value it over here you're talking about fifty thousand pound. But there I think it's thereabouts   (.) twenty thousand, between 
*DAV:	More probably sixty or seventy in this area if you've got a good house. 
*MAR:	Did it as they want it sort of you know? 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. I bet it's beautiful innit? (  )   
*MAR:	  (  )  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DAV:	What are houses going for in the old Yorkshire way? 
*MAR:	I don't know. Haven't got a clue.  (.) I know my sister's mortgage has just gone down. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	Do you know how much she pays a month? Eighteen pound. 
*FRE:	Cor! 
*MAR:	Because she bought the house in the, you know,six  in the sixties. 
*FRE:	Phew. (  )  
*MAR:	Mid to   (.) mi  mid to late sixties she bought her house and   (.) just   (.) this is their second house   (.) and, you know, that's all the mortgage was. And that's just showing you what inflation's like. 
*FRE:	What's the rent on these now? 
*FLO:	Er  (  )  
*DAV:	 (  ) six pounds. 
*FRE:	Six pound weren't it? Yeah, yeah. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DAV:	 (  ) thirty now. And they stormed it, it's built up on a high, you'll see the photo of it when, where it   (  ) and they protected, there's a film about it, where the erm 
*FLO:	Well the name rings a bell. I expect  (  )  
*CLI:	Yeah.  (  ) old films really but I don't like war films. I like the old fashioned I don't like the modern stuff  (  ) . But erm this was   (.) cos   (  ) the Germans were so angry cos they couldn't get up there and they lost so many men   (  ) up there  (  ) . 
*FLO:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLI:	But erm   (.) they were so mad they bombed it. They, they took all their stuff. All their special, you know, relics and that and they put them all in the cellars so when it was bombed, all the precio  all the treasures and that were kept.  (  ) came back up again and they rebuilt it. 
*FLO:	Mm. 
*CLI:	These are all the old erm   (.) armed forces' old shells and hats and things you see.  (  ) All the different hats, there's German's, Italy's   (  ) British 
*FLO:	Oh yeah. 
*CLI:	 (  ) all sorts of hats there.  (  ) Tony, not my Tony but Tony who is Maria's son, Maria is Philomena's sister. 
*FLO:	Oh yeah. 
*CLI:	Her son   (.) said he hadn't   (.) see that, he said, (  ) .  (.)  (  ) so I said go on then   (  ) so he said, well he  (  )  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*CLI:	He came to England, his mum had lived in England in Bedford  (  ) . Went back to Italy. He'd only been back there about three or four weeks and they   (  ) conscrip  conscripted him. Conscripted for two years. 
*FLO:	Mm. 
*CLI:	And they get terrible pay though. 
*FLO:	Mm.

*CLI:	Well I'd   (.) I'd like to just try it you know? Cos you get a lot of snow in Germany but we haven't had much in the last two years. 
*GEM:	 (  ) are you taking yourselves somewhere? 
*FLO:	I'm going now. 
*UNK:	 (  )  ((laugh)) 
*FLO:	But I used to like my little Hillman Imp. 
*UNK:	 (  ) yeah, yeah. 
*UNK:	mine's only   (.) it's only a   (.) you know   (.) about nine hundred and sommat C C engine 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*CLI:	No I don't like big cars but I    (  )   
*FLO:	 I like  a car where I'm in charge. 
*CLI:	Well if, I tell you, if I thought   (.) if I thought for one minute   (.) that we were gonna come back to England like in the next year, which we won't cos Tony's got another year to do now, it's a bit longer than we thought it was 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*CLI:	but   (.) if I thought we were coming back, I'd get myself a little car.  (.) You know  I, I can't drive that big   (  )   
*UNK:	  (  )  
*CLI:	Well I can. I mean I can move it and I can make i  but I, I don't    (  )   
*UNK:	  (  )  
*CLI:	don't like it. It's too big for me. I like it being a passenger   (.) oh I don't like driving  and the wheel's on the wrong side. 
*GEM:	 Are you getting used to  the opposite side of the road now? It's easy  (  )  
*FRE:	Yeah. Yeah. 
*MAR:	When you think it's nearly two years since I've been here. 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah it is innit? (  )  
*MAR:	 (  )  ((laugh)) Last time we came home we, we came off the motorway   (.) and  (  ) . And   (  ) wrong side of the road so   (  ) chap coming round met us   (.)  (  )  
*FRE:	It is confusing, yeah. It is confusing that is. Oh well I   (.) opposite side of the road's nothing to me now cos I, I live on my bike. I'm always on me bike.  (.) We came out the, out the ferry port   (.) and you're alright going straight on to the boat, it's when you've gotta turn right. Very easy to simply turn into this lane instead of going right the way over to the other side. 
*GEM:	Yeah. 
*CLI:	You do it without thinking. That's where I fall down straight away. 
*GEM:	Mm. 
*CLI:	When I'm on me bike. I'll be down there in front of them cars. 
*GEM:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLI:	And we've got right of way now. (  )   
*GEM:	  (  )  why they don't change over in this country because we're the odd one out and if they make cars they've gotta make them   (.) with the steering wheel one side or the other  (  )  
*FLO:	Well yeah but think of the chaos it would cause, swapping over 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*FLO:	ooh  think of the chaos it would cause   (  )   
*GEM:	 What you need, cos I remember reading about  when they changed over, I think it was in Denmark or somewhere 
*FLO:	Eh? 
*GEM:	and at a certain time   (.) everything stopped. All the traffic, it was all sort of er   (.) arranged that at a certain time all the traffic stopped    (  ) to the other side. 
*MAR:	 To, to change this, the British road system  to the same as the continent would be easy. You take  away all the road   (  )   
*GEM:	 It would be  easier for the car  manufacturers wouldn't it? 
*FRE:	 That's it yeah. 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*GEM:	 (  ) have to make cars with the steering wheel one side or the other. 
*CLI:	Well I think it would be ideal 
*FLO:	 (  ) take away the roundabouts. 
*CLI:	I I think 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*FLO:	Roundabouts are better off  (  )  
*MAR:	 (  ) congestion. 
*CLI:	but I mean 
*FLO:	No way. No way. 
*UNK:	 (  ) I prefer them.   (  ) traffic lights I do. 
*MAR:	 No, they're no good. 
*FLO:	Prefer them to traffic lights. 
*MAR:	Well   (  ) over there you see we don't get many traffic lights. 
*CLI:	You don't get many traffic lights or roundabouts. 
*MAR:	Although in Germany    (  )   
*CLI:	  (  ) amazing roads. You don't see any cars   
*MAR:	three or four  roundabouts. 
*FLO:	 Well you see  i  i   (.) yeah but it's a bigger country and I mean it's so congested in England.  You've gotta have some sort of   
*MAR:	 Even in town you don't have roundabouts. 
*FLO:	traffic control haven't you? 
*MAR:	Well there's no roundabouts in the town. 
*FRE:	It's all filtered innit? (.)  
*MAR:	It's all filtered on. 
*FRE:	Mm. 
*FLO:	Yeah but  I mean I suppose it's what you're used to. 
*MAR:	  (  ) got priority. 
*CLI:	I couldn't believe  (  )  
*UNK:	  (  )  
*GEM:	 Well when   (  ) was there that fortnight and it seemed ever so strange   (.) when we   (  ) car with the driver sitting that side and  all the traffic coming by the other way, it seemed mad to me cos of   (.) just those few weeks, I didn't get time to get 
*FLO:	Ah   (.) no. 
*GEM:	acclimatized to it. 
*CLI:	You'll have to come longer. I told you you should come longer. 
*GEM:	Mm? 
*CLI:	You'll have to come longer. (.)  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DAV:	It's, it's, it's a thing that could be done in this country    (  )   
*MAR:	 It needs it. 
*FLO:	Yeah but when wh   
*DAV:	But er it would cause chaos for a time 
*CLI:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	especially with pensioners    (  )   
*CLI:	 Oh yeah, it would. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*FLO:	Right  I'm gonna go   (  )   
*UNK:	 But not only that  but you, there'd  be a point where   (  )   
*FLO:	 We're going   (  )   
*FRE:	 We'll see you later. 
*UNK:	  (  )  
*DAV:	Did Marcus, did Marcus take that wine to work? (.)  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	No he really liked it. 
*UNK:	Yeah he liked it. 
*FRE:	He got a bit flushed though. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	 (  ) his face were all flushed. 
*GEM:	He didn't drink it all himself? 
*FLO:	No he gave us a glass each 
*GEM:	Oh  (  ) . 
*FLO:	and then he had   (.) he'd only had a couple I think before he went home but he doesn't drink much see. He come down, his face were all flushed 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*FLO:	Right   (.) so I'll see you later mum 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*GEM:	Let Marion taste your medicine. 
*UNK:	 (  )

I had this letter come   (.) no no no no, I had this letter come, right, and it said   (.) now they've got this duck and they didn't know what to call it and so Gemma said well I think   (.) erm Eileen, Auntie Eileen ought to name it so   (.) I, I was asked to name this duck. So I said well I think Drucilla's a nice name for a duck. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLI:	And now they call it  Drucilla the duck. 
*UNK:	 It's, is this  it's a lady duck presumably? 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CLI:	Well I   (  ) it's a lady. 
*GEM:	Yeah they'd have said a drake otherwise. 
*FRE:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Well yeah, true. I 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	I call them all ducks, but there you are. 
*GEM:	Well they all look like ducks. But they've got both you see and they refer to them as the ducks or the drakes so they 
*UNK:	Yeah 
*MAR:	 (  ) one of the main streets. 
*UNK:	Who is? 
*CLI:	Right.  I'd better go mother   (  )   
*UNK:	  (  )

*CLI:	I mean I've seen, I did see Rob last Ju   (.) Ju    (  )   
*GEM:	 Well I ain't seen Sarah since  our party  at least. 
*CLI:	 I ain't  seen Sarah since the party, no. Same as you and, and Marje I   (.) their Marjie she started to cry when I went    ((laughing))  (  ) . Didn't know what I were gonna do with her. ((laugh))  
*GEM:	Ah, (  ) ? 
*CLI:	Yeah, bless her. She did, she started  crying   
*GEM:	 Well it  surprised her I expect cos we weren't expecting you so early. (.)  
*DAV:	No I was surprised when I came in. ((laugh))  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*GEM:	 (  ) I rang up Derek and Jenny came up to tell us and she said er   (.) Eileen'll be coming on the twentieth and she won't be here till between eleven and twelve. 
*CLI:	Well  I didn't think we would be. 
*DAV:	 I was surprised   (  )  Tony  (  )  
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*GEM:	never did get round 
*UNK:	 (  ) You know, because he's  (  ) . And he's  (  ) . And he hasn't got anybody, anybody near him. But he thinks he has. 
*DAV:	Yeah. 
*MAR:	And that's his trouble, he thinks  (  )  
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	Yeah but he won't you see, it's it's, it's his personal pride. But he's got to realize that he is ill   (.) and the more he worries the, the, the worse he's gonna get. 
*DAV:	 (  ) conscientious. 
*MAR:	 (  ) when he does his, his   (.) er chimney sweeping. You know, erm   (.) he charges   (  ) oh, fifteen pounds for labour.  (  )  ((cough)) And he   (  ) a funeral parlour  (  ) . Fantastic job.  (  ) so he must be doing good work  (  ) . But   (.) for him to go self-employed   (.) will cost him more money   (.) than doing it on the bl   (  ) black market. So he doesn't go self-employed. 
*DAV:	Well he were working er    (.)  (  ) weren't he, at one time? 
*MAR:	Yeah, yeah. 
*DAV:	What were he doing? 
*MAR:	Labouring. It were just a labouring job. 
*DAV:	Mm.  (.)  (  )  (6.0) Look's nice. 
*MAR:	Yeah that was  (  ) . The the, the house is in such a position erm   (.) it's, it's in a cul-de-sac, well   (.) the road goes up this  (  ) . There's a house at the end  (  ) . And you can see  (  )  
*DAV:	 (  ) never did get round to hoovering the carpet. I did s  bit of dusting and then they came in and I just le   ((laugh))  
*CLI:	Well when you've had your holiday that's nice  ((laugh))  
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLI:	If you wanna come, drive over on the thing and come, what we'll do, we'll do what we do when we bring   (.) Pat and Alan. Pat and Alan are coming right? They came and stayed with us when we    (  )

*CLI:	but erm   (.) they're coming over and they're coming to our house on the Thursday   (.) and on the Saturday morning we're driving down to   (  ) which is down near  (  ) . It's a lovely part of Germany, you've got fields and vine valleys and oh it's a lovely area. We've driven down that's a s  similar way to where we went to  Switzerland   
*GEM:	 Oh yeah. 
*CLI:	down there. But we're going there, spending a week down there with them and then they're coming and spending a week   (.) four days with us and then they're going back. 
*GEM:	Mm. 
*CLI:	So   (  ) do that. We'll go somewhere  (  ) . Hartz mountain is supposed to be really wonderful. 
*GEM:	 (  ) the Hartz mountain where you went 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Yeah that's where we went when we went on that   (.) ferry    (  )

*UNK:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	Yeah that's a really old 
*CLI:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	ancient sort of town. I'm trying to think of the name   (  ) lots of little towns that were    (  )   
*CLI:	 Yeah  they were all er all the way through, yeah. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*CLI:	Cos they're easy to get to each of them, aren't they, apparently? 
*UNK:	Yeah, yeah. 
*CLI:	Yeah that's  what we   
*UNK:	  (  )  
*CLI:	 ((cough))  (.)  (  ) 
*UNK:	Well, yeah 
*CLI:	Well I mean Ton  well I'm alright. I just don't, I just don't like, if it was a little car I wouldn't mind.

*UNK:	No. 
*CLI:	I'm not gonna go and   (.) right, well anyway I'm, I'm

*UNK:	Well you'll have to come over ours. 
*CLI:	Yeah we will do. We'll, we got  we gotta go to   (.) gotta go and see our Tim. He's really upset because   (.) we haven't been to Devon. It's such a long way  you know   
*UNK:	 Yeah. 
*CLI:	if I go to Devon I can't come and s  up this end 
*DAV:	Are you going this time? 
*MAR:	 No. 
*CLI:	 there's  more people this end, we can't get there dad. 
*MAR:	It's a, it's er  it's a long old drive. 
*CLI:	 I promised him I'd go this year though. 
*DAV:	I know it is. It's   (  ) it's a long way. 
*UNK:	How long you got?  Altogether? 
*MAR:	 Well just  this week. 
*CLI:	 We've only got a week. 
*DAV:	  (  )  went down on the bus it would take him  (  )  
*MAR:	That's right, (  )   
*CLI:	 You see  if we go we drive. We've gotta spend overnight and come back. There's two days. Well I promised our   (.) our Sarah I'd spend some time with her   (.) I ain't gonna say too much but she does get a bit upset at times  (  )  
*UNK:	  (  )  
*MAR:	 You see the thing  is wh  when we come home we've got such a   (.) su  such a, a distance to cover, you know it's, it's difficult. 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*DAV:	I mean   (.) the fact is when you're over here, how long are you over here for? 
*MAR:	Well we're going back on Saturday. 
*DAV:	Saturday. Well it means you don't have time. 
*MAR:	No. 
*DAV:	You've gotta    (  ) travel   
*MAR:	 That's the trouble. 
*DAV:	all over the country and you can't do it    (  )   
*MAR:	 You just can't  no. That's what we said to Tim. We, we can't get down there because that's two days   (.) you know? And I have   (.) g  I have paid for   (.) English lights   (.) just for the sake of a week  (  )  
*DAV:	 (  ) You can't satisfy all of them. 
*MAR:	No. 
*DAV:	That's the point. (.)  
*MAR:	Yeah well 
*DAV:	It's just a question of you coming and doing your best. 
*MAR:	Yeah.  See the other   
*DAV:	 You can't do  any more. 
*MAR:	the other thing about coming over is it's bloody expensive in England. 
*DAV:	Yeah I know. 
*MAR:	You know? And er   (.) w  when I came over before and we did Hull   (.) you know Warwickshire and    (.)  (  ) I did twelve hundred miles   (.) in ten days.  (.) Well it's a lot of driving    (  )   
*DAV:	 Yeah. 
*MAR:	you know? I needed a rest when I got back. ((laugh))  
*DAV:	And it's a strain    (  )   
*MAR:	 It is, you know? 
*DAV:	Especially these days on these roads. 
*MAR:	Yeah. (.)  
*DAV:	Well  (  )  
*MAR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	And they er adopted a scheme   (.) last year   (.) when they cut off part of the high street from traffic. 
*MAR:	Mm. 
*DAV:	And you went down the high street   (.) and you turned sharp left   (.) and went along Dock Street   (.) and circling   (  ) supermarket at the bottom end  of town   
*MAR:	 That's right yeah.  Yeah. 
*DAV:	They've cut that out now. 
*MAR:	Oh. 
*DAV:	You go straight down again. And consequently the the high street   (.) uncertain now 
*UNK:	Ooh 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	And they're all doing their shopping  (  ) . 
*MAR:	I'm er I'm a believer in   (.) er pedestrian precincts   (.) you know? Because if you want to do shopping or   (.) just   (.) window shopping, you should park outside of the town   (.) or on the outskirts of the town   (.) and you can walk in or you can get the   (.) the bus service    (  )   
*DAV:	 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
*MAR:	It's just as easy. 
*DAV:	But that's the problem, bus service 
*MAR:	Well yeah 
*DAV:	in this country today the  (.)  
*MAR:	Well   (.) it isn't a bus service is it, you know? 
*DAV:	No. (.)  
*MAR:	Because you   (  ) feel obliged to them don't you?  Providing a service. 
*DAV:	  (  )  been destroyed. 
*MAR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	I think the best move they made in   (  ) in, in recent years has been the introduction   (.) of what they call the    (  )  (.) and it travels all the way in the town. And forty pence you can get on and go up to your home, they pull up outside our gate. 
*MAR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	 And for forty pence   
*GEM:	 It's been a godsend for us  to go down the street  shopping, if you've got a load of shopping you just stop   (.) right outside the gate. 
*MAR:	 Yeah. They did that, they did that in er   (.) yeah  they did that in Levington with  er   
*DAV:	 Yeah. 
*MAR:	taxis. You got   (  ) and you, you   (.) a taxi came along   ((cough)) and you paid him forty P or fifty P, whatever 
*DAV:	Mm. 
*MAR:	and you went anywhere on that route, yeah? And if you said you wanted to be off the route slightly, no problem  he'd go around. 
*DAV:	 That's it.  Yeah. 
*GEM:	It has it's routes, it goes round and round 
*MAR:	Yeah. 
*GEM:	and you can go on it   (.) anywhere as far as you like for forty pence. 
*DAV:	And you can do the lot for forty pence. 
*GEM:	 (  ) 
*DAV:	It even takes you over the hill into  (  )  
*GEM:	We can get down on the high street any of these times and it drops us back up here. 
*DAV:	Yeah. 
*GEM:	It's a circular route all the time, it keeps going back to   (.) the town centre 
*DAV:	Yeah. 
*GEM:	but it's ever so useful. 
*DAV:	Yeah. I  it's excellent. It's superb for 
*MAR:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	for pensioners. But a lot of youngsters use it too. 
*MAR:	Yeah but I, I think that youngsters   (.) can abuse the system as well. 
*DAV:	Well   (.) well so far it's  it, I mean   
*MAR:	  (  )  
*DAV:	the chap, he's very obliging, he    (  )   
*GEM:	 We got our own   (  )   
*DAV:	get off. 
*MAR:	Oh and you talk into the 
*GEM:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	Yeah. 
*MAR:	 (  ) ? 
*DAV:	Yeah. (  )   
*CLI:	 Our Marie's is a nice car innit? 
*GEM:	Nice  little car innit? 
*DAV:	 It's a nice little car. 
*CLI:	Yeah. 
*DAV:	She's had problems with it though. 
*MAR:	Talbot Solaro  
*CLI:	Yeah, nice little car. I wouldn't mind one like that. 
*MAR:	Talbot Solaro  
*GEM:	 ((laughing)) They've got three now  they have to queue up. There's Alan's and   (.)  Claire's   
*CLI:	 Claire's. 
*GEM:	and Marion's and if the one that's nearest the house wants to get out first everybody else has to   ((laughing)) move . 
*CLI:	It's cold out there now.  (.) I've decided. Ooh  so what time do you wanna be

*DAV:	Oh this one here  (.)  
*GEM:	Oh I forgot about that   (.) when I said er  (.)  
*CLI:	Are they alright? (  )   
*GEM:	 They're alright  down here, at least they were  the last time we had them. We don't get them all that often. 
*DAV:	  (  )  
*CLI:	Well I'll go and get them. 
*MAR:	 (  ) I'll get the case out the car. 
*GEM:	 Now do you want me to give you something for them? 
*CLI:	  (  )  
*MAR:	And when you get back    (  )   
*CLI:	 No no no. 
*MAR:	er 
*DAV:	I were a little bit shocked when I saw Tony though. 
*CLI:	Don't he look  old? 
*DAV:	 I hadn't  realized he'd changed that much    (  )   
*CLI:	 Saying about Tony, how old he looks.

*MAR:	He'll be fifty two this year, Tony. 
*CLI:	Yeah.
