*PHI:	Not really.
*JAN:	Mm.I don't remember it being that much last year, but she's using a different board this year so maybe that's something to do with it.

*PHI:	This finished?
*JAN:	I'm sorry.
*DAV:	Dad 
*PHI:	Oh you put that there.
*JAN:	Mm.
*PHI:	Yes?
*DAV:	The only thing wrong with that granary bread   (.) is that every time you cut it it wriggles, wriggles.
*PHI:	It wriggles.Well it's alive.
*DAV:	 ((laugh))  (.) It goes like, woo ooh!
*PHI:	Mum will do that for you.
*DAV:	That's the knives int it?
*JAN:	That's better.
*DAV:	This.
*JAN:	Marmite again then?
*DAV:	Yes mum. (.) Breakfast is nothing like reading a comic.
*PHI:	We never said it was.
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	Well, I don't see the connection.
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	Oh oh oh!You know, you read your comic at breakfast.
*JAN:	Well, you might.
*CHR:	Well dad doesn't read his newspaper at breakfast.

*PHI:	Yep.Fine.After two dinners now I've had enough.
*JAN:	Well that's what I thought.I was going to do beef but I think er   (.) I think we'll go back to chicken.

*JAN:	The beef, yes, that's, I thought you did.Erm, we need some more milk.I was just   (.) a bit too short of time on, on   (.) Friday to   (.) That's about all I need.And, some vegetables.
*PHI:	Yeah.
*JAN:	But we can pick that up any time today can't we?
*PHI:	Mm.Or Sunday.
*CHR:	Certainly get looks like it   (.) the sun's going in.
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	Yeah, probably if you want me to get that old mower going I ought to go up to Woods and   (.) see if I can get a new drive belt.
*JAN:	Well it would be nice if I could use it.
*PHI:	Mm mm.
*DAV:	But why don't you use the other one?
*JAN:	And when, when the weather is nice 
*PHI:	Mm?
*JAN:	I said I would be very happy to be out there.
*DAV:	We've got two mowers.The red one and a green one.Why don't you use the green one?
*PHI:	Well I like the ride on one because it's easier.The, the   (.) green one it takes hours to cut   (.) used to take about three hours for me to cut all the grass with that one.
*JAN:	But first, but when we first came here I spent three hours on a Sunday morning, and I only did that area where you play football.
*DAV:	Ah!
*JAN:	Mind you, I was just slow. ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	Mm.
*JAN:	Erm 
*PHI:	If you'd started the motor and used it it would have helped.
*JAN:	 ((laugh))  (.) What about, are we going to put that one in the sale this year, the one that's out in the shed?
*PHI:	Yes I would think so.
*JAN:	Yes it would be nice if we were, we got rid of that.
*CHR:	Put it in the 
*JAN:	Then I can 
*CHR:	traction engine rally auction.
*JAN:	That's what, yes I think it was  (        ) .
*PHI:	But it's the   (.) it's the transporting of it.I have no trailer.
*JAN:	You see if we can get away on holiday earlier this year because the violin exam's in June or in July we'll be back.Cos you remember we came round, we came back the night before the traction engine rally cos I didn't have time to get organized.
*DAV:	What about, you could hire a trailer.
*PHI:	Not with your mouth full!
*JAN:	I'm sure we could   (.) work out something.
*PHI:	I'll have to check I've got all the engine bits, whether I left any at dad's so I can at least stick, bolt 
*JAN:	Mm.
*PHI:	the engine back together.
*JAN:	You do agree though we should get rid of it?
*PHI:	Yeah.I'm never going to do that one. (.) There's your tractor to do, there's my motorbike to do, and so many other 
*JAN:	I know but that 
*PHI:	things that mower's a 
*JAN:	I don't like 
*PHI:	goner.
*JAN:	that out there it is because at the back of my shed, I want to do some   (.) I want to tidy that area up.
*PHI:	Mm.
*JAN:	Repot some plants.
*DAV:	Dad.
*PHI:	Yes love.
*DAV:	You've never taken us on a ride on your motorbike this year.
*PHI:	Well I haven't, haven't had it out this year.I'm not going to
*JAN:	D'ya know I think, I think, I think it has been out this year.
*PHI:	Yes I, actually I think it
*JAN:	It has.
*PHI:	I think we have run it once this year.But er, there's two things Dave.
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Number one is, I don't like using it on wet grass.The other one, is you and Chrissy   (.) getting too big to take you both on it now.Have to be one at a time now.And you'll have to ride on the back, you can't ride on the tank any more.
*DAV:	Why?
*PHI:	You're too big.
*JAN:	You're too big now.You're six now.
*DAV:	 ((laugh))  (.) I remember when I used to ride on the tank.
*JAN:	You were only a baby, I used to be very frightened.You had nothing to hold on to, you were just squeezed in between daddy's legs.
*DAV:	 ((laugh))  (.) But when I   (.) was a bit older
*JAN:	Mm.
*DAV:	and I was still riding on the tank
*JAN:	Yes but
*DAV:	I gripped a erm   (.) I gripped it.
*JAN:	Yes.Yes yo well your hands were a bit bigger and you knew where to hold on.
*PHI:	More?
*JAN:	Yes please. (.) Thank you.
*DAV:	Dad.
*PHI:	Mhm?
*DAV:	We can get the motorbike out in the summer.
*PHI:	Mm.I wasn't meaning that motorbike in any case. (.) That one goes.There's another one in there that doesn't.Ah.
*JAN:	Oh don't tell me  (        ) .Which reminds me, when are we going to get rid of all those other car bits in there?
*DAV:	Oh yes!I know, there's a windscreen up er, on the ceiling
*JAN:	Mm.
*DAV:	we which came from the car you, you two got married in.
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	And you've still got that   (.) paste on it.
*JAN:	 [laughing] I was under the impression we got married in the church  [] .
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	No you got it wrong Dave.
*DAV:	Well you nicked it off someone's car though.
*JAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	I dismantled   (.) that car.
*JAN:	 ((cough)) 
*PHI:	It was one   (.) your uncle David   (.) brought up for me so that I could get   (.) take it to pieces to make the car we'd got   (.) better.
*DAV:	Ah!
*PHI:	Took the engine out, the gearbox out.
*JAN:	You do realize it's nine years later and we've still got the bits, got all the bits in the garage?
*PHI:	Mm mm.Be collector's pieces.
*JAN:	Can we get rid of them? (.) No I'm, I'm 
*PHI:	D'ya want any more?
*JAN:	I'm having another piece of toast in a moment.But there's no rush though.I'm tired this morning, but not as tired as I thought I would be considering two nights out.
*PHI:	At least you've had one of them in your own bed.
*JAN:	Mm. (.) And the smoke   (.) the smoke on Thursday was awful! (.) You'd think the Roadrunners friends wouldn't smoke as much as they did.But then you see Wen  (.) Wendy brings all the friends from Leckernby Installations, of course, they all smoke.They got crowds of them from there.
*PHI:	Mhm.
*JAN:	Actually I was thinking   (.) it would be nice erm   (.) I have to make a team up with erm   (.) Wendy's parents and we would do quite well with the joint knowledge of four of us.
*PHI:	It's your competitive instinct coming out again.You're trying to win.
*JAN:	One of the questions erm, there was a   (.) one of the categories was quiz shows   (.) so I thought well I, I don't, I won't do very well here cos I just don't watch enough   (.) and one of the questions was, who was the helper on erm   (.) My, on Take Your Pick?The old Take Your Pick.Well one of the ones that u that used to Take Your Pick?
*PHI:	Who sha well Michael Mi 
*JAN:	That was Michael Miles.
*PHI:	Michael Miles used to do it.Who was the helper?
*JAN:	On Take Your, on Take Your Pick.
*PHI:	Bob   (        ) Walker.
*JAN:	Well, you see, er we didn't know that.Yo yo if you'd have been there we'd have done well.And then it was who was the helper on Double Your Money?Well we fi 
*PHI:	Hughey Green and er 
*JAN:	finally got to Monica and we thought that was enough, so we just wrote Monica, we thought they'd accept that and they did n't.Th the   (.) we didn't get the full marks we, we didn't get 
*PHI:	I can't remember her name.
*JAN:	Monica Rose.
*PHI:	Oh.
*JAN:	But you see, if we'd had yous and then, we were doing qui quite well up until 
*PHI:	Well I wasn't around.I was at 
*JAN:	then, then we got the sport and we didn't do so well on that.
*PHI:	Oh well. (.) Did you do the filters on this yesterday?
*JAN:	Erm   (.) I rinsed out the bottom of the  (        ) , yes.
*PHI:	Alright.
*JAN:	Why would they leave those poles?I mean they were there at lunchtime when I came home and there was nobody with them so I assumed they'd knocked off for lunch.And then
*PHI:	I think somebody's trying to upset you.
*JAN:	I is that all they're trying to do?Because it's frustrating 
*PHI:	Well no, I don't know, but 
*JAN:	to put them there and then 
*PHI:	I wouldn't er 
*JAN:	leave them there.
*PHI:	they've lined one up at each end of the field so it, it looks like they're saying, well, you know that's a parcel of land.
*JAN:	Yeah.
*PHI:	But, I don't know.
*JAN:	I mean I, I reckon it'd be nice if they, they sort of parcel it up and then sell some of it
*PHI:	Go round and ask.
*JAN:	No.
*PHI:	Why not?
*JAN:	I don I don't know whether I want to   (.) spend er, you know, so much money on that.
*PHI:	Well would you rather do that or have a conservatory?
*JAN:	Well it   (.) the land would cost   [laughing] so much   [] more than the conserv I don't know if I want to spend so much money here, I'd rather 
*PHI:	You do  (.) Yes but, you don't know how much er, I mean, you can't sell it for housing   (.) at the moment.He looks always 
*JAN:	And he's not getting 
*PHI:	strapped for cash.
*JAN:	and he's not getting any younger.How old is he now?
*PHI:	Well, he must be about seventy.
*JAN:	Oh!He must be more than seventy.Well, he's only seventy.I mean he's, he's a long way to go.Co could you cut me a slice of that please? (.) Oh not     (.)  ((laugh))  (.) not quite as big as that.Just, just, that's it, yes.Thank you.
*PHI:	Do you want my finger with it?
*JAN:	No.Thank you.
*PHI:	Oh the er   (.) the hotel at   (.) Gosforth had erm   (.) Sky.
*JAN:	Oh yeah.
*PHI:	And er, you know,th it's, it's spo 
*JAN:	Oh that's just enough.

*JAN:	Oh how
*PHI:	so, I doing, I did the channel flipping and erm every time you went to it somebody else was getting   (.) chopped up, drowned 
*JAN:	Oh don't 
*PHI:	in that one.
*JAN:	please!I'm still eating my breakfast.
*PHI:	So, I'm not bothered about Sky television if that's what they put on.
*JAN:	I don't think we ever were bothered with Sky television.
*PHI:	 ((sigh)) 
*JAN:	I must get the daffodils out of the porch and change the ones round the house, they're looking a bit tired.Yes?
*CHR:	Can I go   (        ) today please cos he said he won't be playing today er, cos erm   (.) yeah   (.) cos he can't.
*JAN:	Yes but er i i the thing is, if he said he would be playing he would come round here.Don't you think you've been round there too often?
*PHI:	You can ring him and ask him what his plans are.But, don't forget we need to know your plans as well sunshine.
*CHR:	I know.
*PHI:	There's two violins to fit in.
*JAN:	There's two violin practices today.
*CHR:	I know.
*JAN:	Did you re 
*PHI:	Are you gonna finish this lot off?
*JAN:	Yes I, yes I am.There's erm, a list of dates for the junior school, they're having their photographs taken again.
*PHI:	Enough?
*JAN:	Erm   (.) perhaps a second, a bit longer please. ((cough)) 
*CHR:	Where's the erm
*PHI:	What?
*CHR:	the phone thing?
*JAN:	 [sighing] Oh  [] .
*PHI:	Okay?
*JAN:	Get very messy on a Saturday morning breakfast don't we? (.) Ah!Post.
*PHI:	Yeah well, that one's a new cheque book.This one'll be your   (.) Marks and Sparks' charge card.Have you used it recently?
*JAN:	No.Well, not excessively.
*PHI:	Dear me.
*JAN:	How much?
*PHI:	Fourteen pounds.
*JAN:	Mm.That's what I mean, I've only been in the  (        ) .
*PHI:	That was at Scunthorpe.
*JAN:	Yes.D'ya remember I went over tha that day I dropped you off and I took the children   (        ) home.
*PHI:	Oh yeah.Right.
*JAN:	Erm 
*PHI:	Mrs Gerry , the Bradford Exchange.
*JAN:	No.
*PHI:	That's the 
*JAN:	But i it'll only be that picture.Didn't, did we actually 
*PHI:	That plate.
*JAN:	order that new picture on a plate?
*PHI:	I ordered you the other one, but in my name not yours.
*JAN:	Yeah.Ah well th this picture's coming, or that one. (.) It's probably details of the same plate though.You must get   (.) some means of hanging them up.
*PHI:	Yeah.That's right.Got things like that on it.
*JAN:	Oh no, it's erm     (.)  ((clears throat))  (.) I don't know if it's quite my sort of thing.
*PHI:	No, it's not yours.
*JAN:	There.Oh you've got the, no, it's in there, the details are in there look.
*PHI:	A racket isn't it?I mean, you know, everything's plate one, have you ever seen plate two, three or four or?
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	Oh!
*JAN:	I think they go to two and three but they don't go very far.
*PHI:	Michael  's alright.
*JAN:	The paperwork must cost quite a lot   (.) that they keep pushing out.
*PHI:	Why?I mean   (.) the plates'll cost pennies to make.Look at this, all this
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	and there's no mention of the price.
*JAN:	Oh!It'll be on here somewhere.No, they are, they, they do   (.) they, they are pretty good.There.It's all listed out properly.
*PHI:	Nineteen ninety.So oh here it is.
*JAN:	That's the sort of thing Geoffrey might like.
*PHI:	Erm
*JAN:	What? ((clears throat)) 
*PHI:	Well that's a thought.
*JAN:	What?
*PHI:	Erm   (.) when we sell that flat we were gonna give Geoffrey and Jean something.
*JAN:	Well   (.) that's a 
*PHI:	Yeah I 
*JAN:	nice for present Geoffrey but not for Jean.Not 
*PHI:	Yeah, but you get Jean something as well.
*JAN:	No, don't you think that's going a bit over the top?
*PHI:	Well   (.) it's up to you.
*JAN:	I'll buy them   [laughing] a bunch of flowers  [] !
*PHI:	That's a better one.Here's a second plate, it's a lank.Takes me back to Scampton.
*JAN:	Oh yes, that's nice.I like that better than the other one.Yes that's plate two.Coalforth.Nineteen twenty.Yes that's better.I like that. (.) I'm, I'm a bit confused, thinking about work yesterday, I'm a bit confused about who, who's  (        ) .Erm   (.) Steve    (.) for some reason I thought he was a tall   (.) man, but he's quite short isn't he?
*PHI:	Yeah.Just when he's 
*JAN:	Is he 
*PHI:	on the football field.He can jump.Steve, the fair haired little 
*JAN:	is he the one 
*PHI:	one.
*JAN:	well, who's the one 
*PHI:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	the dif a while ago drove down   (        ) Middle Street and crashed into some, that one?
*PHI:	That was Ian , he doesn't work there.
*JAN:	Oh!I'm mixing the two people.
*PHI:	Ian  's tall.But he 
*JAN:	Isn't he?Yeah.
*PHI:	he doesn't look anything like him.
*JAN:	So Steve  's quite respectable?
*PHI:	Yeah.They're all nice lads.
*JAN:	Mm.Well he seemed quite nice and I thought, well are you the one that 
*PHI:	Ian's alright, he just gets drunk.
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	But he's recently married that   (.) lass with the ready-made family so
*JAN:	Oh well.No I just thought he was quite pleasant.I mean he was always quite helpful when I 
*PHI:	Steve's, Steve is 
*JAN:	didn't know anything 
*PHI:	Steve's very pleasant.He's a nice lad.
*JAN:	but I thought, well is he the one
*PHI:	He's intelligent as well.
*JAN:	He, he er yes, he   (.) I mean they were all quite helpful.Pete  was, was quite helpful too.
*PHI:	Mm.
*JAN:	I thought   (        ) to Janet   [laughing] when I last see him  [] .
*PHI:	It's alright. (.) Janet should come to work shouldn't she?
*JAN:	Do you think she'll   (.) turn up on Monday?
*PHI:	Oh I would think so.She's got the most   (.) abysmal sickness record!She'll   (        ) rigid cos her pay stopped at one stage and   (.) it was wrong because she hadn't been warned
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	but erm   (.) she did a   (.) threw a wobbler about it and 
*JAN:	Mm.
*PHI:	then when we checked into it
*JAN:	It was right.
*PHI:	and you got her sickness record it   (.) it was, well it's
*JAN:	What's the matter with her?
*PHI:	they nearly paid her   (.) erm early forties and a spinster.
*JAN:	Oh Phillip!That's 
*PHI:	D'ya know what I mean?
*JAN:	very sexist.I don't like that.Is she in her early forties?
*PHI:	Yes.Forty one I think.
*JAN:	You mean she's my age?I thought she was older than me.
*PHI:	There you are, you see.
*JAN:	No I think   (        ) 
*PHI:	She's, she's, she's typical of the
*JAN:	Now now!
*PHI:	of the eight cats
*JAN:	Oh I know she is.Mm.
*PHI:	living on your own syndrome.So I think it's the cats she catches anything from.She worries and frets all the time.It's cos she's nobody to talk to.
*JAN:	Mm.That's what   (.) Julie and I were saying that   (.) when you live on your own you get a bit like that.
*PHI:	Oh!She, she gets all wound up at home and then comes to work and   (.) where there's people to sound off about, everything under the   (        ) er the sun.
*JAN:	We were saying about John, we was talking about John  as well.
*PHI:	Yeah.
*JAN:	And the fact he can't just accept things, he has to question things.And we were talking about M E, and how
*PHI:	Oh he's a very intense person.
*JAN:	how Dave, I was saying about Dave and how he's sort of taken, taken a completely different attitude to things.
*PHI:	More relaxed.But 
*JAN:	If he, if he couldn't do anything then he would accept it and not do it and then try a bit and if he had to   (.) go back to bed.I mean he gave up work for a long time didn't he?
*PHI:	Yeah.But it's such a   (.) sort of thing 
*JAN:	And the contrast in personalities though, they're just   (        ) 
*PHI:	Well there's a contrast in personality and you don't really know whether anybody's got the same thing because nobody's narrowed it down 
*JAN:	No, oh no, I mean 
*PHI:	down.
*JAN:	Yeah you can't.
*PHI:	All they know is that they're
*JAN:	But Julie was saying 
*PHI:	different.
*JAN:	about that sleeping treatment that he took,tha that finished him off because he, he, he 
*PHI:	Yes but 
*JAN:	staked so much on that and we were, we were agreeing 
*PHI:	Oh yes I know.
*JAN:	that the reason he didn't sleep was because the fact that he was just sitting around all day.So you wouldn't sleep 
*PHI:	But they didn't 
*JAN:	then your body doesn't need it.
*PHI:	they didn't do it properly though.
*JAN:	Oh!That was the other thing she said, that he, he should have be gone into hospital.
*PHI:	Course he should.He tried to do it at home and that was 
*JAN:	They co 
*PHI:	ridiculous!
*JAN:	did he have the opportunity to go into hospital to have it done?
*PHI:	Erm, well the 
*JAN:	 ((clears throat)) I would have thought 
*PHI:	Yeah.
*JAN:	so because erm 
*PHI:	I mean Paul said, with the blokes down in London and he, he ga gave them the pills and sa told them that they go back home and so he did.
*JAN:	Yes but the, Julie said, and she's right of course, you can't have the erm   (.) strength of drugs to, to, to administer at home because obviously
*PHI:	It wasn't, it wasn't
*JAN:	you've got to be monitored on that sort of thing.You can't be put into 
*PHI:	it wasn't done right.
*JAN:	a deep drugs and ni not have erm   (.) some medical staff   (.) monitoring you.
*PHI:	Yeah it sounds like you did a lot of work yesterday.
*JAN:	I told you we tal I talked, I, I disturbed her all day long.
*PHI:	Oh look!
*JAN:	What?Why is that?What is it?
*PHI:	Oh!
*JAN:	I was going to say it was just something stuck on   (.) the 
*PHI:	It's te I'll pick it up,i if it   (        ) it was rust on the  (        ) .
*JAN:	No, no.It, it, it 
*PHI:	No, now that I've seen it.
*JAN:	while I was sitting from here I could erm   (.) see it had something stuck on it.
*PHI:	The sheep seemed to have thinned out.
*JAN:	Mm mm.I think they must be up that other end cos th there's about a couple of dozen yesterday I noticed.
*PHI:	Only two down here.They're not eating our hedge.
*JAN:	No, see that one that's going up near where I planted granddad's honeysuckle?
*PHI:	Mhm.
*JAN:	They erm, [laughing] they er    []  (.) there was a lamb nibbling that yesterday and he's taken off, [laughing] so the bits at the top and the bottom   [] have no connection any longer so
*PHI:	Oh!
*JAN:	It's not, I don't think that's granddad's honeysuckle.I must go out and check it.
*PHI:	I don't know where granddad's is.
*JAN:	No, it's ju it's just down there.
*PHI:	But that was a wispy one, granddad's was ever so big.
*JAN:	No, granddad's   (.) never really took off 
*PHI:	With big leaves.
*JAN:	because of the   (.) of the drought.When we were away it didn't get watered on.I used to water it every day.
*PHI:	Well everything looks as though it's had a good water now.
*JAN:	All four lilac trees have taken anyway.I want to check that the 
*PHI:	Did I tell me when we got up to erm   (.) Newcastle we turned on the local news, they'd had five inches of rain   (.) which is a winter's rain in four days.
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	The Metro station just down from   (.) Gosforth Park er was flooded to platform level.
*JAN:	 [laughing] Oh  [] .Like d'ya, do you remember Sheffield 
*PHI:	And all the overheads were 
*JAN:	flooded last year?
*PHI:	Yeah.And, and everywhere you went the fields   (.) waterlogged 
*JAN:	Actually standing in water.
*PHI:	Standing in water all the way up.Snow on the hills and everything.
*JAN:	Mm.
*PHI:	But fortunately, you know, we, we only got   (.) tail end of it, a bit of sleet.
*JAN:	Whereabouts did you go yesterday?You know you said   (.) there was a bus coming at half past eight.Where did 
*PHI:	Erm 
*JAN:	you go?I couldn't 
*PHI:	to 
*JAN:	I couldn't quite imagine what you were doing.
*PHI:	went round the erm   (.) British Gas research establishment.
*JAN:	Oh!Was it mu was it very interesting?
*PHI:	Amazing!Amazing!And   (.) very impressed.The   (.) it's a massive place and, you know, five or six hundred staff, and erm, it's where they   (.) develop all the new technology for the   (.) gas fields   (.) delivery of gas to your house and everything.But you see they're spending a lot of the time   (.) you know, on   (.) developing ways of repairing roads after they've been in them.And what's impressive is they're doing research that we should have been doing for years!I mean, it's a bit much when the gas board is there showing us
*JAN:	How to research   ((clears throat)) 
*PHI:	how, it's developed materials, it's developed techniques and everything for mending roads.So   (.) it's er   (.) a bit humbling.
*JAN:	So did you learn something?
*PHI:	Yeah.Quite a lot.You see when the erm   (.) legislation changes shortly, well the legislation is there but   (.) when it's enacted   (.) erm   (.) they   (.) they will become responsible for repairing after their own hole digging   (.) and they have to provide us with guarantees.
*JAN:	Certain standard and time to do it in.
*PHI:	Yes, but I've, they've got to guarantee the repair for at least two years after they've done it.
*JAN:	Ah I see.
*PHI:	So, British Gas, the commercial, have worked out that there's only one way to do that, you do the job properly to start with.
*JAN:	Mm.Yes.
*PHI:	And so, they're putting all the effort into doing it.
*JAN:	Mm.Well they 
*PHI:	And er 
*JAN:	don't wanna, amount of time of coming back again to do it haven't 
*PHI:	It's 
*JAN:	they?
*PHI:	well that's lost money isn't it?
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	So   (.) no it was very impressive.I'll   (.) I think it's a bit much when you have highway engineers there and   (.) really   (.) they were showing us how it should be done.And er 
*JAN:	Mm mm.
*PHI:	they proved, you know, some things, certain rollers and stuff that   (.) we thought were useless, you know Paddy's dancing partner?
*JAN:	 [laughing] Oh yeah  [] .
*PHI:	Erm   (.) well we thought that was out of fashion.They've shown that   (.) if you run it at the right speed and stuff it's one of the most effective   (.) methods of doing it   (.) and erm   (.) the ones we say are the nice little plate compactors which are   (.) the best thing, they are useless in comparative performance so
*JAN:	Mhm.
*PHI:	er   (.) no it was, good.The money they spend on research!I forget what it was, the turnover was erm   (.) something like eight billion.Or was it   (.) no i er it, probably eight hundred billion.It was in some figure you can't even relate to.So
*JAN:	Well they must have a lot of money.Isn't it British Gas' Chairman that's just had that enormous pay rise?
*PHI:	Well I think most of them have.Oh yes, but the Gas one has.But I mean th the   (.) the standard of entertainment, I mean   (.) put, putting 
*JAN:	 ((clears throat)) 
*PHI:	us all in that hotel for
*JAN:	 ((cough))  (.) Somebody was saying   (.) rang in complained to Peter  about the, the amount of, what, what are they getting?It's not, it's not quarter of a million is it?It's about two hundred thousand.
*PHI:	Prob probably something like that.
*JAN:	And Peter said well what would you consider   (.) a reasonable salary for him?And I thought he would say something like, you know something really silly, about fifty, sixty thousand, but he said   (.) I think a hundred and fifty thousand's enough.And, I thought well, it is really isn't it?
*PHI:	Probably is.
*JAN:	And for, for somebody who was ringing in, an ordinary person just complaining
*PHI:	Mm.
*JAN:	I, I do think they have rather gone over the top.
*PHI:	Well, there you are.If you want to attract the right people and keep them you have to pay them money.
*JAN:	Yeah but, don't, I'm sure there must be a lot of right people who will work for a hundred and fifty thousand.
*PHI:	Probably not.
*JAN:	Well
*PHI:	The other thing that was interesting I learnt at dinner on   (.) Thursday night is, under the   (.) government's legislation within so many years, nineteen ninety four I think, they've got to ha have reduced their market share from the original hundred percent   (.) to sixty percent   (.) as new firms come in to   (.) sell gas
*JAN:	Yes.
