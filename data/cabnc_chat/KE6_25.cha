*BEV:	They must realize she does work
*WEN:	But I mean we've had this for blooming weeks now ain't we?Er nine weeks
*BEV:	It's either the phone or the dogs or the child
*WEN:	Mm   (.) when you can hear the telephone like that in here, there's no wonder you can hear the rest of them

*BEV:	they wouldn't have room in one car for four dogs would they?
*WEN:	I don't think they take the dogs out in the car for a run, you know, like a lot of people do
*BEV:	No
*WEN:	I don't think she puts them in the car
*BEV:	it's not the sort of car that you do that with, not with four anyway, you'd imagine them having an estate car
*WEN:	Mm

*WEN:	Yeah, something where you can put the bar up at the back
*BEV:	Mm
