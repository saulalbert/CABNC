*DEB:	Cos I told her I'm not working. •_•
*LYN:	And like, now, it's not fair  is it? •_•
*DEB:	And I'm not working next year anyway cos I've done it for two years on the run and I'm not doing it next year. •_•
*HAY:	I've done it five, this is the first time in five years I've had New Year's Eve off. •_•
        And I was determined, and your mother was  •_•
*LYN:	I'd done it for four years on the trot. •_•
*HAY:	looking at me as if hey erm and all  this like   you know she was looking as if  •_•

*HAY:	Never! •_•
*DEB:	honestly now   •_•
*HAY:	I told her   •_•
*LYN:	Yeah as long as one   •_•
*DEB:	No, no listen, listen, listen now right, last year when we both worked Hayley what was it like? •_•
        The committee were in there, they had all their special seats there, their drinks ready right, and they said right girls, you ready now to start? •_•
        And all of a sudden they unlock them doors out there and they come running  •_•
*HAY:	Oh that's true, yeah. •_•
*DEB:	in here •_•
*HAY:	Pair of us had panic attacks didn't we? •_•
*DEB:	I had a panic attack, I told her, I said I'm shaking all over. •_•
        And I thought if I go from behind this bar now I'll never go back behind it now. •_•
        So I calmed down see and I was alright after about ten minutes. •_•
        But this year it was much better because they'd let them all in because it was raining weren't it? •_•
        So they couldn't leave them all standing outside. •_•
*HAY:	Bloody stupid anyway. •_•
*DEB:	So when they walked in here it was packed in there and it was full in the bar. •_•
*HAY:	Even if they'd let them in let them get their seats and said look the bar is not open. •_•
*DEB:	Well that's what they should do every year because do you know what it was much better this year. •_•
*HAY:	They do it in the Labour Club, you can go in there •_•
*DEB:	Within ten, fifteen  •_•
*HAY:	right  •_•
*DEB:	minutes we'd served everybody by that bar this year. •_•

*HAY:	I'm paranoid now. •_•
*DEB:	You dopey cow. •_•
*LYN:	Well she, like I say next year, if they're not paying double time she's gonna get no one to work is she? •_•

*DEB:	I couldn't go back to sleep, but I felt so guilty about what I'd eaten. •_•
*LYN:	Ooh I know. •_•
        Like say last week me and Russell never got up before, oh my mother and father come to the house right and it was quarter past ten  and we were still in bed and my father put the milk  cos the, my milkman leaves my milk by the gate because, with the dog, he always used to leave the gate open so I used to let the dog out in the morning and the dog would go out  so I said don't put the milk by the door, leave it just, put it over the gate cos I like the gate left shut. •_•
        So that's what he does and my father come in, put the milk by the door, knocked the door and me and Russell were still in bed fast asleep. •_•
        I mean we'd been up  •_•
*DEB:	Did they knock you up then? •_•
