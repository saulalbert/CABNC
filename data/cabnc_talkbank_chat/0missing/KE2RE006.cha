*PS0W2:	Which page Eighty two Found that quickly did n't you Er percentages is it . 
*PS0W8:	Yeah . 
*PS0W2:	Right E one Have you looked at this Let's have a look at it B's height is sixty percent of A side There 's B and it 's sixty percent of A C's height is a hundred and twenty percent of A's height There 's a hundred percent so a hundred and twenty it means it 's more than A 's height If C's height was a hundred percent of A's height it means it was exactly the same If it 's less than a hundred it 's smaller if it 's more than a hundred it 's greater Now the decimal equivalent of hundred and twenty is one point two and there you 've got nought and nought a hundred and one so ninety percent is point nine eighty percent is point eight and a hundred and ten percent is one point one and a hundred and twenty percent is one point two So what you 're doing in fact is to if you 've got a hundred and twenty percent if you divide that by of a hundred in other words you move your decimal point two places that 's a decimal So a hundred and twenty percent as a decimal fraction is one point two All you do is to move that decimal point two places Alright So to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of amount to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of an amount you multiply by one point two If you wanted to calculate eighty percent of an amount you would multiply by point eight A hundred and twenty percent you are multiplying by the decimal equivalent which is one point two So write down decimal equivalent of a hundred and forty percent That 's right Now calculate a hundred and forty percent of seven point five kilogrammes Have you got a you 've got a calculator have n't you Have n't got it with you . 
*PS0W8:	No . 
*PS0W2:	But you 've got your own Scientific one No . 
*PS0W8:	No . 
*PS0W2:	You could do with one Alright It 's one of those things that you could do with really If you 've got a birthday or something coming up and if somebody wants to know what to buy you that 's what you want You want one of these scientific ones So you want a hundred and forty percent of seven point five . 
*PS0W8:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	Let's have a look What is it A hundred and forty percent so it 's one point four times seven point five Try it Use that one Yes you use your finger One point four times . 
*PS0W8:	Oh it 's . 
*PS0W2:	Ten point five that 's right Okay Ten point five killogrammes Right Put it on the on the er on that desk which probably will be better So alright calculate a hundred and thirty percent of sixty seven pounds That 's right a what is that . 
*PS0W8:	Eighty seven point nine . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah so it 's eighty seven pounds ten is n't it That 's right Right B a hundred and twenty percent off thirty two metres . 
*PS0W8:	Oops . 
*PS0W2:	No Start again Right one point two metres times thirty two Yeah What is it . 
*PS0W8:	Thirty eight point four . 
*PS0W2:	That 's right Now a hundred and eighty percent of seventy four metres . 
*PS0W8:	One three three eight two . 
*PS0W2:	That 's right Right E three A What are the decimal equivalents of a hundred and sixty percent That 's right A hundred and sixty three percent . 
*PS0W8:	Six six four . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah point six three Good You move that decimal point you see in two places and it 's one point three A hundred and six percent . 
*PS0W8:	One point nought six . 
*PS0W2:	That 's right One point nought six Again yo you the figure staying the same all you do is to move a decimal point two places So D is . 
*PS0W8:	One point three nine . 
*PS0W2:	One point three nine Alright And E . 
*PS0W8:	One point nine . 
*PS0W2:	One point nine or one point nine yes Right A factory plans to increase it 's output by fifty percent next year So if this stands for this year 's output at a hundred percent fifty percent of it has to be added on to give next year 's So there 's your hundred percent and you add fifty percent So next year 's output is to be a hundred and fifty percent of this year 's Because you add fifty percent to the hundred percent and a hundred plus fifty is a hundred and fifty So the output is going to be a hundred and fifty percent of what is was last year The decimal equivalent of a hundred and fifty percent is one point five O or one point five Next year 's output is to be one point five times this year 's So you multiply this year 's output by one point five and it 'll give you next year 's output Alright You add on that fifty percent or whatever it happens to be to the hundred percent which gives you the new figure You change that into a decimal that is what you multiply by So let's have a look If something is increased by fifty percent it is multiplied by one point five A new town plans to increase it 's population by fifty percent during the next five years If the present population is eighty three percent calculate the planned population in five years time So what are you gon na multiply that by . 
*PS0W8:	One point five . 
*PS0W2:	Right So it 's eighty three thousand and what do you get . 
*PS0W8:	One two four five O O . 
*PS0W2:	That 's right One hundred and twenty four thousand five hundred Now calculate the new populations when these populations are increased by fifty percent Now you can give the answer in this form you need n't write it out in full So what you 're gon na do is to multiply sixty four point eight by . 
*PS0W8:	Have n't got anything . 
*PS0W2:	one point five and that 'll give you an answer which you will write down followed by the word million Alright So sixty four point eight multiplied by one point five . 
*PS0W8:	Ninety seven point two . 
*PS0W2:	Right Ninety seven point two Good Now this one . 
*PS0W8:	That 's fifty eight point eight . 
*PS0W2:	A fifty eight point eight million And C . 
*PS0W8:	Eighty nine point seven million . 
*PS0W2:	That 's right Okay An airline is to increase all it 's fares by seventeen percent Now this erm illustrates the increase There 's your hundred percent it 's got to go up by one point seven to a hundred and seventeen percent One hundred and seventeen is one point one seven So you multiply your hundred by one point one seven and you get one hundred and seventeen The new fare is one hundred and seventeen percent of the old fare The decimal equivalent of a hundred and seventeen percent is one point one seven Move two decimal yo decimal points down those two places alright So to get the new fare you multiply the old fare by one point one seven The old fare multiplied by one point one seven gives you the new fare That represents a seventeen percent increase So at three before the seventeen the percent increase the fare from London to Feraccas was five hundred and fifty pounds calculate the new fare after the increase . 
*PS0W8:	Six O three point five . 
*PS0W2:	Right So that 's six hundred and forty three pounds fifty pence . 
*PS0W8:	Fifty . 
*PS0W2:	is n't it Right F four If you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by . 
*PS0W8:	Four point five . 
*PS0W2:	One if you 're increasing it by forty five percent if it was a hundred percent and you increase it by forty five hundred percent . 
*PS0W8:	Oh it 'll be nought point . 
*PS0W2:	No A hundred percent plus forty five percent will be what . 
*PS0W8:	A hundred and forty . 
*PS0W2:	A hundred and forty . 
*PS0W8:	five . 
*PS0W2:	five percent Right Now what 's that of a decimal equivalent . 
*PS0W8:	One point four five . 
*PS0W2:	Right Alright So if you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by . 
*PS0W8:	One point erm . 
*PS0W2:	four five Think in terms of putting a one in front of that and then moving a decimal point two places and it 's one point four five So okay F four A is one point four five Alright That 's the first that 's your answer to that first question F four A was one point four five Now it says No Just one point four five . 
*PS0W8:	Oh yeah . 
*PS0W2:	A hundred and forty five percent is one point four five alright So now it says increase twenty eighty pounds by forty five percent So you 're gon na multiply the twenty eight by . 
*PS0W8:	One point four five . 
*PS0W2:	Right Forty point six . 
*PS0W8:	Forty pounds sixty right Right Right F five now all of these you 've got to increase e something by something there so you 've got to change each of those percentages you 've got to think of it as added to a hundred and then the decimal equivalent So what are you gon na multiply the sixty seven by . 
*PS0W8:	One point six two . 
*PS0W2:	One point six two Right Good . 
*PS0W8:	One O eight point five four . 
*PS0W2:	That 's right one O eight point five four and it is in killogrammes That 's right Right Right So F six A If you want to increase something by seven percent what do you multiply it by . 
*PS0W8:	Er nought point seven . 
*PS0W2:	Sorry Say it again . 
*PS0W8:	Nought seven one point nought seven . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah one point nought seven that 's right So your ar answer to A is one point nought seven Good So now you increase sixty five pounds by seven percent . 
*PS0W8:	Sixty nine point thirty five . 
*PS0W2:	Sixty nine pound thirty five pence Right Good Okay now F seven 's gon na be the same Increase ninety two pounds by three percent That 's right Nine pound four seventy six Good Right That 's right Good Right Alfred 's salary is eighty thousand four hundred and twenty pounds and Alberta 's is seven thousand a hundred and eighty four Alfred has a twenty two percent increase and Alberta a thirty eighty percent increase who earns more after all this So what you 've got to do is to put down Alfred 's Alfred and put his new salary down and then you have to Alberta and her new salary and see which is which is the most So you 're going to look for . 
*PS0W8:	Oh tell me again . 
*PS0W2:	Alright So . 
*PS0W8:	Oh . 
*PS0W2:	so right eighty four two nought multiplied by . 
*PS0W8:	Erm . 
*PS0W2:	eight that 's right So what 's that ten two seven two forty Yeah Put a put the forty down cos it 's forty pence Right Yep That 's good Now Alberta 's Right So earns more afterwards . 
*PS0W8:	Alfred . 
*PS0W2:	Right So Alfred is the answer Right Oh we 're coming to negative numbers Have we done negative numbers . 
*PS0W8:	No . 
*PS0W2:	No Right Positive negative numbers can be marked on a number line which extends in both directions You can do some simple calc calculations by thinking of a number line for example two minus two plus five means start at minus two then go up five so you 'll finish at three So minus two plus five equals . 
*PS0W8:	Three . 
*PS0W2:	plus three Right Minus three minus two means start at minus three then go down minus two so minus three and minus two is minus five Alright Now before you right them down just tell me what they are and then we can go back and write them down Here you 've got minus four and plus three . 
*PS0W8:	That 's minus one . 
*PS0W2:	Good Minus four and plus six . 
*PS0W8:	Two . 
*PS0W2:	Plus two right Yes two yeah okay So write them down cos yo you obviously can do those alright . 
*PS0W8:	It 's plus two minus one . 
*PS0W2:	Minus one yeah . 
*PS0W8:	Minus . 
*PS0W2:	It 's two . 
*PS0W8:	Yeah two . 
*PS0W2:	Now two minus five . 
*PS0W8:	Minus three . 
*PS0W2:	Minus three Minus one minus three . 
*PS0W8:	Minus four . 
*PS0W2:	Right Minus six plus two . 
*PS0W8:	Minus four . 
*PS0W2:	Right And three minus eight . 
*PS0W8:	Minus five . 
*PS0W2:	Right The number line method works when you have to add or subtract and ordinary positive number plus three means go up three minus three means go down three But it does not tell you how to do four plus minus three or seven minus minus three for example but it does not tell you how to do four plus minus three or seven minus minus three where you have to add or subtract a negative number Adding a negative number Think what happens if you start with four and add on different numbers Four plus three as the number you add on goes down so the answer goes down Four plus three equals seven four plus two equals six four plus one five four plus nothing equals four four plus minus one is three cos you 're coming down here three two one nought minus one minus two minus three minus four minus five So as the numbers that you add on get one less so the answers get one less So four plus minus one is three four plus minus two is two four plus minus three is one four plus minus four is nothing four plus minus five is minus one What is important is that you realise that that number is minus one that number is one plus one if you like but you do n't need to say it but if th any if the sign is n't there it 's assumed that it 's plus But that number and that number are two different numbers They 're as different as one is from three That is a different number from that that is a different number from that And that number is minus one Do n't think of it as taking away one thinking of it think of it as minus one a number That is minus two that is minus three that is minus four that is minus five You 've done some algebra have n't you Found out the value of X well you can X equals minus five And that is a value for X it equals minus five and minus five is a number So try and remember that that that is a number in it 's own right Now when you start thinking of what to do you 've got plus four and you 've got minus three if you take the smaller digit now that digit is four that digit is three if you take the smaller digit from the larger digit you take the three from the four you get one and the answer is whatever sign that larger number is When you 've got two numbers that are both all pluses four and two is six four and one is five four and nothing is four four and minus one means you got plus four minus one is one less than four it 's three You 've got four plus numbers you got two minus numbers which leaves you with two plus numbers Let's go on and see whether you can pick it up Write down the next two lines of a pattern of the bottom of the opposite page Notice that four plus minus one has the same answer as four minus one Four plus minus two has the same answer as four minus two and so on because the plus and minus gives you a minus So we 've got four plus minus one is three four plus minus two is two four plus minus three is one four plus minus four is nought four plus minus five is minus one what 's going to be the next one Four plus . 
*PS0W8:	Minus six . 
*PS0W2:	Equals . 
*PS0W8:	makes minus two . 
*PS0W2:	Right So write that down in your book now safely A is A two write down the next two lines So you got four plus minus six is minus two then you 'll have four plus minus seven is gon na be Minus three Right Okay So let's go on Adding minus N is the same as subtracting N adding the minus number is the same as subtracting it So copy and complete these So write down A three A Five plus minus three equals five minus three equals . 
*PS0W8:	Two . 
*PS0W2:	Two Right Two plus minus six is the same as two minus six which is going to be You got plus two minus six . 
*PS0W8:	Four . 
*PS0W2:	Mm . 
*PS0W8:	Four . 
*PS0W2:	You take the smaller digit from the larger digit so you take the two . 
*PS0W8:	Eight . 
*PS0W2:	from the six and it gives you four but then you give the sign of a larger . 
*PS0W8:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	so it 's minus four Alright Now this is minus three plus minus four which is the same as minus three minus four Now you can those are both the same sides so you 're gon na en add them together and give it the sign that is common to both . 
*PS0W8:	Minus six . 
*PS0W2:	Minus . 
*PS0W8:	Six . 
*PS0W2:	Three and four . 
*PS0W8:	Seven sorry . 
*PS0W2:	So alright Minus seven yeah Happy Right so A four work these out Now if you can do them then just put the answer down Six plus minus three is the same as six plus and a minus give you a minus so it 's the same as six minus three which is What 's six minus three . 
*PS0W8:	Three . 
*PS0W2:	Three Right You take the smaller digit from the larger digit so you take three from six gives you three you give the sign of the bigger number which is a plus Now this time you 've got two minus five . 
*PS0W8:	Yeah . 
*PS0W2:	You take the two the smaller digit from the larger digit but you give the answer the sign of a larger digit So it 's . 
*PS0W8:	Minus . 
*PS0W2:	Minus three Alright Yeah Okay you got minus one and a minus four . 
*PS0W8:	Minus four . 
*PS0W2:	No you got a minus one and a minus four they 're both the same signs cos it 's minus one minus four they 're both the same signs so you put them together four and one make . 
*PS0W8:	Five . 
*PS0W2:	And you 've got . 
*PS0W8:	Minus one . 
*PS0W2:	minus so they 're minus five Let's just have a look at if we 've got six and four we can have six plus four or you can have six minus four we can have minus six minus four or you can have minus six plus four Now that 's a plus six and a plus four what 's the answer . 
*PS0W8:	Ten . 
*PS0W2:	Ten Nice and straightforward Both the signs are the same So you add them together and you give it the same sign This one what 's the answer to that gon na be You 've got a minus six and a minus four Both the same signs . 
*PS0W8:	Ten . 
*PS0W2:	Ca n't be the same as that They 're both minus Those are both plus so we call it plus ten these are both minus so the answer is . 
*PS0W8:	Ten . 
*PS0W2:	Minus ten Alright If the signs are the same you add them together you give the ssssa the sign that they 're both the same as Now here you 've got six minus four now what 's six minus four . 
*PS0W8:	Two . 
*PS0W2:	So that equals two Now here you got minus six plus four take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger . 
*PS0W8:	Minus two . 
*PS0W2:	Right Does that help a little bit Let's do another one Let's do erm eight plus three eight minus three minus eight minus three and minus eight plus three Let's see if we can do those What 's eight and three . 
*PS0W8:	Eleven . 
*PS0W2:	Right What 's minus eight and minus three . 
*PS0W8:	Minus nine . 
*PS0W2:	No Minus eight and minus three Both the same signs . 
*PS0W8:	Minus eleven . 
*PS0W2:	Minus eleven Now this is easy eight minus three is . 
*PS0W8:	Five . 
*PS0W2:	Five But this is a minus eight . 
*PS0W8:	That 's five yes . 
*PS0W2:	plus three it 's minus five Alright Tear that out and keep that by your side because that gives you all the four possibilities Alright When the signs are the same if they 're two pluses you add them and it 's plus if they 're both minus you add them and it 's minus here you take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger Three from eight is five that 's plus five Three from eight is five but that is minus so it 's gon na be minus five Okay So keep that by your side and see how we get on So we 've what were we doing A B D This one here is it Minus two plus minus five Which is minus two minus five Minus two plus the minus gives you a minus so you got minus two minus five . 
*PS0W8:	Er minus seven . 
*PS0W2:	Minus seven Right Now here you 've got nought and a plus minus gives you a minus so it 's nought a minus four . 
*PS0W8:	Minus three . 
*PS0W2:	Right Good Three minus three Three . 
*PS0W8:	Nought . 
*PS0W2:	minus three . 
*PS0W8:	Nought . 
*PS0W2:	Nought right Minus five minus two . 
*PS0W8:	Minus three Erm . 
*PS0W2:	Minus and a minus Same as that one look Minus two minus five You got that one right What was that Minus two and minus five . 
*PS0W8:	Seven . 
*PS0W2:	Is minus seven Right So here you got minus five minus two which is . 
*PS0W8:	Minus seven . 
*PS0W2:	Minus seven Now here you got seven minus nine Take the smaller from the larger which will give you Seven . 
*PS0W8:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	from two nine is two and that number is a minus so the answer 's going to be a minus so it 's gon na be . 
*PS0W8:	Minus two . 
*PS0W2:	Minus two Alright .
