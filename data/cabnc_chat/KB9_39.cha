*DAV:	No you've done
*ANN:	Mm.
*DAV:	you've done very well!Haven't you really?Your first   (.) your first year.
*ANN:	Yeah we did well but erm   (.) we shouldn't have   (.) like, you learn by your mistakes, but we   (.) we kind of made profit and we shouldn't of done
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	erm, and now the tax man has hammered us so hard
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	that we're really struggling!
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	And we're really having to struggle to sort of make ends meet.
*DAV:	Yeah.I know what you mean.You   (.) it's a diffi it's difficult 
*ANN:	It's wrong int it?
*DAV:	just striking up that balance int it?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	Isn't it really?
*ANN:	And of course, now they   (.) when we originally moved in here we asked about the rates and they said oh they co they wouldn't raise it because it was an unfinished project
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	and nobody had paid rates, and they wouldn't pay rates until they'd actually finished building on the land opposite.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Anyway, when the accountant came in to do the books   (.) he said er, oh he said you've got to pay something.So he said, I'll get onto them myself.Anyway, apparently, he was told exactly the same thing as I was told
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	but of course, it had kind of stirred up a hornets' nest!Next thing they were down with the measuring up and we'd just got a four thousand pound rate bill!And, they've actually rated it at ten and a half thousand   (.) erm   (.) payable
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	three thousand eight, and of course, well Neil said there's V A T, I didn't think you had to pay V A T on rates?
*DAV:	I didn't, I didn't, you know, I don't 
*ANN:	You know?
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Er   (.) anyway   (.) so tha that's sort of you know, made 
*DAV:	Mm.
*ANN:	a big difference.That's suddenly four thousand a year we've to find.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I mean, if, it's crippling us is this place!
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	If it wasn't for this we could be   (.) it would be quite good.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	But what can you do, there's nothing else about?
*DAV:	No it's   (.) that's it.And a lot of businesses up and down are er   (.) are in a bad way, really.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	Some very   (.) sailing very close to the wind.
*ANN:	Yeah.They're all finding it hard aren't they?
*DAV:	Well, there's less and less work   (.) and the work that does seem to be about   (.) is that competitively priced that 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	you know, it's negible whether you can make anything even if 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	you get the work.
*ANN:	Yeah.And then of course er   (.) money is floating round very quickly.No.No.I er, in fact, we, yeah, we just had a problem yesterday, we started work for the Royal Scotsman   (.) and   (.) erm   (.) well we started work for them, like last year and we've been doing jobs
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	and we've had invoices outstanding since October.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	So Neil said, well   (.) these invoices weren't forthcoming, so I said to them, the thing, the thing is, if we start work and we buy a load of equipment   (.) how are we gonna   (.) sort of, how long's the cheque gonna, gonna be coming in, you know.
*DAV:	And you have to fund it.
*ANN:	So we asked for twenty thousand pound upfront.
*DAV:	Tt!
*ANN:	So, anyway, and they said, and before we wi we get this twenty thousand we also want the ou October's invoices clearing up as well.So, that was   (.) great.Anyway, we've waited and waited   (.) we've rung and we've rung!Eventually a cheque came, instead of being like, for six thousands er, nearly seven thousand it came for four!
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Erm, the twenty thousand eventually arrived, no V A T.You know
*DAV:	Yes.
*ANN:	and all this sort of things.So, of course, we were getting a little bit panicky   (.) cos what's worrying me, and it still worries me   (.) again   (.) we've put all this time and effort in   (.) they may pay us   (.) alright, we've got this twenty, they may pay us a second payment, but are they gonna pay up on the third?
*DAV:	Well tha that's always the catch isn't it?
*ANN:	You know?
*DAV:	The last one.
*ANN:	Yeah.So we actually wrote down   (.) erm   (.) th the equipment that we were buying was ours until paid for in full.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	By them.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	And we sent this letter up to them.Well we've had their director on the phone, phone yesterday   (.) and more or less demanded his twenty thousand back
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	and, if you don't want the work we'll take it elsewhere and all this.
*DAV:	Mm.
*ANN:	Erm
*DAV:	Puts you off doesn't it?
*ANN:	Well I mean, what on earth do you do?
*DAV:	Yeah.Very difficult isn't it?
*ANN:	You just   (.) well Ne both Neil and I have sort of felt well, to be quite honest it isn't worth it.
*DAV:	Yeah.For what you make at the end of the day on, on somebody's   (        ) 
*ANN:	No it's not worth it.It 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	well it, the running the business isn't I don't think   (.) because by the time   (.) the tax man's hammered you
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	you know, the V A T man wants his money, I mean the V A T man's been paid for all these invoices
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	and I still haven't got the money in.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	You know.Everything's against you!
*DAV:	Really V A T's, I think, and I think it should only be paid when it, when the invoices 
*ANN:	Exactly!
*DAV:	have been cleared, rather than always paying 
*ANN:	Exactly!
*DAV:	for that quarter 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	even if you've not got paid.
*ANN:	Yeah.Exactly!Erm   (.) mm, I don't know whether there's any way round it   (.) but   (.) that's sort of the set up that they gave us when we started and I guess I'll have to   (.) sort of conform to that, but   (.) it 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	does seem unfair.
*DAV:	Yeah.That's right.
*ANN:	I mean now there's a couple of people quibbling about actually paying   (.) at the   (        ) that we did.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	There's still six hundred and odd pound outstanding.Erm   (.) I can't honestly see us ever getting that.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Erm   (.) the funiculars   (.) they're quibbling about the final payment.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	About them being late and everything else.Er, you know, it's just a, and I've paid for that and that and
*DAV:	There's extenuating circumstances like that 
*ANN:	Oh dear!
*DAV:	though isn't there?As Neil said.
*ANN:	Well yeah!
*DAV:	Changes in specification
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	er, equipment coming in late, er 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	you know, I mean
*ANN:	They don't seem to   (.) want to know though.I mean, Neil's tried to explain to them   (.) that, they were late with drawings and everything else, it put us way behind in the beginning.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	But all, you know, they've just not listened to him!
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	So 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I guess it'll 
*DAV:	It's er stal stalling   (.) they're 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	cos that's all it's doing innit?
*ANN:	Yeah.Well solicitor said she, it sounded to her as if there's something more   (.) to it.Maybe they don't have the money.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	And they're stalling all the time.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	But erm   (.) you see, they suggested going down for a meeting   (.) he's up to his eyes in it!
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	And
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	he can't honestly spare time to go down there
*DAV:	It's costing you money isn't it?
*ANN:	Well yeah 
*DAV:	And chase your own   (.) what's due to 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	you.That's, that's the  (        ) .
*ANN:	And we know you're gonna have an argument.So is it worth it?
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	I, I, I personally feel that   (.) give it to solicitor and let her deal with it, because
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	just not worth the hassle.Alright 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	that's gonna cost
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	but, but I mean you can only make it worse by   (.) like you say, you're wasting your own time and money
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	you're not gonna get anywhere!
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.All gets 
*ANN:	I mean 
*DAV:	a bit acrimonious doesn't it?And er 
*ANN:	Yeah.Don't it?
*DAV:	er that sort of thing starts happening.
*ANN:	Oh it's painful!
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	It really is painful!
*DAV:	Yeah.It's getting ever more difficult isn't it?Doing 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	business.Ever more.
*ANN:	Yeah.You just   (.) I,th all this bumph about sort of trying to help small businesses and, things like that, they do nothing!
*DAV:	No.No I know that.
*ANN:	They do nothing at all!
*DAV:	Yeah.No it's er   (.) as you say, all, all the cards are stacked i in 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	such a way that it makes it ever more difficult.
*ANN:	Yeah.The trouble is, see   (.) you know, you've nobody you can go to, you, you've nobody that sort of will listen to
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	to all this and do something about it higher up.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I mean they just keep hammering and hammering and more and more are going out of business.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Alright,th the  (.) saying in the paper, they're talking about   (.) stopping these big companies, keeping these little companies waiting   (.) there could be something they can do about that, but how long is it going to be before they do something?
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.It's a 
*ANN:	In the meantime   (.) there's more and more going bust every week!
*DAV:	Well the trouble is, a lot of these MPs and   (.) people on these committees   (.) are actually   (.) they've got seats on the boards of a lot of these big companies 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	so it's not in their interests to push this through.The longer they can stall   (.) something 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	like that
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	er, you know, the better it is, and particularly when you look at the   (.) the fever that there is at the moment about   (.) electioneering
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	is, is no big business isn't it?
*ANN:	No, that's true.I mean maybe I should go and see local   (.) erm   (.) MP or 
*DAV:	Local M P.
*ANN:	whatever and, and, about the rates.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	And see, you know, if they can do something about that, maybe it'd be right time.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Bu cos we're actually the only ones that have their rate bill   (.) Barry's hasn't.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	So, you know, they're 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	just expecting us to pay!
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.I would.
*ANN:	And it's   (.) Yeah.
*DAV:	That's what they're there for!
*ANN:	Well, yeah that's true!
*DAV:	Whether you've voted for them or not.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	And , you know   (.) in fact 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	you pay your taxes and, and
*ANN:	Yeah, it's very true that.
*DAV:	you know, it can have  (        ) .
*ANN:	I might do that.
*DAV:	Yeah.Because if, if they've singled yourself out, it's, obviously, it's not right is it?
*ANN:	No it's not.Well I said, well I'm not paying mine until somebody else gets theirs.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	And have to pay theirs.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	But erm   (.) I suppose next thing'll be a court demand and, how d'ya fight that?
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	So
*DAV:	It's all a worry innit? ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Yeah, int it?Oh!Headache stuff!Never mind.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	Never mind!
*DAV:	Oh well, keep your head down. ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] !Yeah.At least there isn't the same hassle as there was at Calpers 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I mean   (.) alright, yes, you sort of have worries, but most of the time, I mean, for all last year it's run pretty well.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	It's only just recently that we sort of starting our de we've had bits of aggro.
*DAV:	Yeah.Or at least, like 
*ANN:	So 
*DAV:	with this,a all the benefits are, you   (.) get them personally don't you?
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah.
*DAV:	Er rather than 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	doing the same amount of hours er and somebody else benefiting?
*ANN:	That's it!Yeah, that's it.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	I mean, it's, like his car for instance, I mean, that's always been a dream he never thought he'd ever be able to afford   (.) a new car, erm 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	you know?
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	And er, of course that's like a dream come true for Neil, so 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	that's 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	why we want to make a success and he   [laughing] don't lose it all  [] !
*DAV:	Well, you know, you've got to have er benefits of, of   (.) taking a course of action like this haven't you?Because 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	otherwise   (.) you know 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	what's the point?
*ANN:	That's it.
*DAV:	What's the point?I mean i 
*ANN:	That's it.
*DAV:	It's not that people want to get rich, it's just that you make a nice living and   (.) enjoy 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	what you like doing and that's it.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	You know?
*ANN:	Yeah.Yeah, can well do without the sort of, the hassle and the aggro.I mean,Calpers have made it   (.) a lot worse for us.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	They have.They've done 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	everything possible to make life difficult!
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	But er   (.) hopefully they'll leave us alone soon.But it doesn't help when we bring people like Geoff you see, cos Geoff comes from Calpers 
*DAV:	Oh I don't, oh right.
*ANN:	Oh yeah.He did.
*DAV:	I de I didn't recognize him.
*ANN:	Really angry   (.) about it because they've had to bring somebody else in to do   (.) Geoff's work.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.Right.
*ANN:	So   (.) I mean it was Geoff's choice.
*DAV:	Yeah.Well, this is it, I mean, people   (.) you can't make people do things, I mean, they've got to 
*ANN:	No.
*DAV:	want to do it haven't they?So
*ANN:	Yeah.This 
*DAV:	well 
*ANN:	is it.
*DAV:	we've done very little there.They ju just don't seem to be doing any steel work at all.
*ANN:	No.Well, everybody keeps telling us they're not doing anything.They just don't know how they're surviving but they keep going on!
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	The man, he must have plenty of money to keep it, carrying it
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	as he is doing.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	But er
*DAV:	no doubt it'll all come out in   (.) fullness of time 
*ANN:	Well yeah 
*DAV:	won't it?
*ANN:	It will won't it?Yeah.
*DAV:	Things can't carry on indefinitely   (.) in any business
*ANN:	No.
*DAV:	where nothing's being produced, can it?
*ANN:	No.Oh well he's, he's told the lads that   (.) it's only a matter of time.I think that's   (.) what more or less decided Geoff that, yeah, he would take it.
*DAV:	 (        ) Yeah.
*ANN:	But erm
*DAV:	There you go.Well if he's  (        ) , I mean, that's what you want innit?
*ANN:	Well yeah.
*DAV:	Somebody who can turn yo you 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	know, do a bit of everything.
*ANN:	Well it means, you see, apparently Geoff's done all the air braking at Calpers it means that Neil can actually   (.) some of the time, be here   (.) rather 
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	than up there all the time with them.
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	Well , cos David really doesn't know anything   (.) about the air braking or anything like that.
*DAV:	Right.Mm.
*ANN:	So
*DAV:	Very good!Anyway, I'll let you get on.
*ANN:	Yeah, it's nice to see you again.
*DAV:	And you.Yes.Gotta go and see the guy on the end now.
*ANN:	Oh yeah!
*DAV:	Haven't , haven't met him as yet.He's   (.) they've   (.) opened an account with us and had a few bits and baps off us, so 
*ANN:	Mm.Mm.Yeah, cos er, I think Neil was telling you that, they look as if they're gonna be buying plenty of gas off us if we, when we start taking the air products.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	So
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	He's seems er, he seems okay.
*DAV:	Yeah.
*ANN:	But that's a big company I think.
*DAV:	Right.Yeah.Well 
*ANN:	But 
*DAV:	I think so, it looks 
*ANN:	Yeah.
*DAV:	it doesn't it?
*ANN:	I think we're only little one   (.) here.
*DAV:	Yeah.Right.
*ANN:	I mean , next door   (.) he's a big   (.) company based in London, so
*DAV:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	 [laughing] And we're struggling  [] ! ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) I'll see you.
*ANN:	Alright Jim.See you!Bye! (.) Neil, I hate to say it, but I don't think   (.) Teresa'll   (.) will stick up there long.They've just asked her to do   (.) more hours, she's to stay till five at night.
*TRA:	Well   (.) well she just wants to say well 
*ANN:	It's not fair is it?
*TRA:	you know   (.) can   (.) can she have some money?
*ANN:	Well, Tracy's just said that to her.It's alright them asking you Teresa, but   (.) you know, they, they should be prepared to pay you more. (.) Alright, I mean, we were just sort of thinking well   (.) sort of four o'clock wasn't she, she was starting to come out to Che she came out with Cheeky with us last night, but of course, that's all gonna go again innit, if it's gonna be five o'clock?
*TRA:	What has Teresa said to her?I don't like that.
*ANN:	Well she said , no she said to her, well what else can I say?But, I'll ha I'll have to do it won't I? (.) I can see Teresa going back to Anna  's for season.
*TRA:	Yeah. (.) Well the horse job, that way is, is enough bloody heads.
*ANN:	Yeah.Ah, you must admit though that's a bit it's a bit overboard innit?I mean
