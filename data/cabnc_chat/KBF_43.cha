*BRE:	Alright. Erm   (.) just one thing. You don't have Brenda any more do you?  (.) No? 
*JEA:	No. Be a Christmas card. 
*BRE:	Erm   (.) what about your local hairdressers? Do you go in there?

*BRE:	Two ninety nine. 
*JEA:	There are two of them. There's Beverley and Gail. Gail sometimes does my hair but she's a learner and I get her more cheaply. I think a corn dolly for Gail.  (15.0) Mm so that's corn dolly accounted for isn't it? 
*BRE:	That's both corn dollies. 
*JEA:	That's my lot. And for Beverley  (.)

*BRE:	Why don't you give that one to Beverley? And just give something sma  cos you're gonna  (  ) . Have a tin of, have a pack of my chocolates   (.) and give them to   (.) Gail, and give them to   (.) that to Beverley. 
*JEA:	Good idea. 
*BRE:	Yeah? 
*JEA:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	Cos they're, I mean they're nice sort of wrapped up.

*BRE:	 (  ) that's corn doll   (.) swiss chocolate.  (.) Cos I, I only bought these as extras anyway.  So. 
*JEA:	 Mm. Mm.  Yes I know. Yeah. (.)  
*BRE:	Ah yes I, I, I   (  ) but I'm gonna get   (  ) aren't I? Instead. Right so that's your hairdressers. That's about it isn't it? 
*JEA:	I think so. 
*BRE:	What about that other lodger  (  ) ? 
*JEA:	Oh I hope he'll be gone by Christmas.  (.) I think he'll be, I think he'll be   (.) moving out probably at the end of the, I told him I wanted a week's notice. I, I asked him a couple of weeks or ten days back. I said oh by the way when are you leav  intending to move out? And he said the   (.) they were pressing him for completion   (.) that very minute. You see nowadays the solicitors are falling over themselves to do the conveyancing. Whereas when you and I were buying houses it was   (.) oh it's a long process and it can't be hurried. Now they're just desperate. And I, he said something about, muttering something about before Christmas. I hope he is gone before Christmas. 
*BRE:	We won't put him down anyway. Who've you got for  (  ) ? 
*JEA:	I can't be bothered. I really cannot be bothered.

I'm on good terms with I ought to give them   (.) I'll get them a tin of biscuits as well. I'll get them in Stowmarket. 
*BRE:	Mm?? 
*JEA:	Mm.  . Tin of biscuits.  (.) Erm odds   (.) I'll get a a   (.) what are they? Crystallised  (.)

*JEA:	They're tiny. 
*BRE:	Tiny things. Erm   (.) see how you pack it. See what you get tomorrow. I mean   (.) the tree's not desperate to get  (  ) . You can get it   (.)  if you've got   
*JEA:	 If the worst comes  to the worst I can do without that. I can er either buy one in Asda or somewhere or forget about it and have a fresh tree. But I've had fresh trees since I've been in   (.) in Stowmarket and I've, I've come to hate them. They're, you know   (.) you, you get the earth you, Richard   usually goes and gets the earth for me. Drops half of it all over the carpet as he's bringing it in. 
*BRE:	Yes. Too much bloody mess  (  ) . 
*JEA:	And have you ever put a tree   (.) a Christmas tree in a tub and packed earth round it and got the bloody thing to stand up straight? 
*BRE:	No. No. 
*JEA:	Not on your nelly! 
*BRE:	But that   (.) I mean where do you   (  ) nearest M and S? 
*JEA:	Norwich is the best. Ipswich is the nearest.  (.) Norwich is the better bet because Ipswich is being redeveloped   (.) and only about   (.) a third of the space at the moment is being used for the, for shopping. I don't know whether they'll have managed by Christmas to get it all done. They were   (.) expanding. 
*BRE:	The thing to do   (.) perhaps   (.) tomorrow morning   (.) to phone Ipswich   (.) Marks to see if they've got them in stock. 
*JEA:	Good idea.  (  ) Yeah. 
*BRE:	But I think you're gonna have enough to carry back 
*JEA:	I think so. 
*BRE:	without  lugging that big box  . 
*JEA:	 I I don't think I could manage it.  I can see    (.)  (  ) fits  being had by   (  ) party. 
*BRE:	  (  ) presents  than worry about the tree at the moment. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	Cos you've gotta, I mean    (  )   
*JEA:	 I love that tree.  I fell in love with that    (  )   
*BRE:	 I know you did dear.  But you can't even leave it down here and pick it up later 
*JEA:	No. 
*BRE:	because it'll be too late. 
*JEA:	No. I, I want it for Neil and   (.) Paul and even  for   (  )   
*BRE:	 Well why don't you  get him to, can't you go with, take Neil into Norwich? 
*JEA:	Mm.  I can   
*BRE:	 And get  him to carry it. 
*JEA:	I can get, you see Mark will   (.) Mark will do anything at the moment cos he's quite interested in me. 
*BRE:	Well phone, if it comes to it phone Mark at Norwich and ask him to deliver one. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	Alright might cost you an extra fiver. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	But it's worth it cos you, you wouldn't get there in petrol   (.) and back would you? 
*JEA:	No. 
*BRE:	Right let's just go through the rest of this. Jean to get. Marks and Sparks slippers. Erm   (.) Marge, something small.  (.) Shall we put down Marks, Debs or Smiths? (.)  
*JEA:	Oh I might look   (.) I'll look along the paperbacks for Marge. Put query paperback. (10.0)  
*BRE:	Er   (.) Maureen   winter tights. Debs? 
*JEA:	Mm.  (.) Actually, are we going in to Marks again tomorrow? 
*BRE:	Yeah. 
*JEA:	I think that Marks' winter tights will probably be better.

*JEA:	Er yes. Bookshop. (10.0)  
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) I've put book  bookshoe.

*JEA:	 Alcohol  Mm. (.)  
*BRE:	When's Neil going to see his er heavy metal thing? 
*JEA:	He's not going. 
*BRE:	He's not going now? 
*JEA:	No.  (.) And I had   (.) before  I realized   
*BRE:	  (  )  
*JEA:	how tight Mike was going to be with   (.) you know having to look after Paul and all the rest of it I promised I'd take him to   (.) Snetterton market and he could have, he was going to buy some   (.) records. But er   (.) oh yes I might still do that.  (  ) talk to him very seriously. Talk to   (.) myself very seriously.  (.) No but there, there aren't any   (.) there didn't seem to be any concerts   (.) erm happening within the vicinity. I mean they travel all over the world these people. And I, I suspect that they're on their way out because the way they   (.) leap and scream and bang and thump   (.) I should think that they  (  ) , most of them have been on drugs. He has on, or had on his wall   (.) a poster with the itinerary of their, of their tour. This, this group that he's so fascinated by. And I keep on forgetting the name of the group. (.)  
*BRE:	Right Sheila  , calendar Smiths. (.)  
*JEA:	Oh. What's the name of the group that he's so mad on. Megadeath is one. 
*BRE:	Right what about   (.)  (  )  
*JEA:	Well their itinerary was something like   (.) er January the first Cologne. January the second   (.) Dusseldorf. January the third   (.) Berlin. You know    (  ) they were   
*BRE:	  (  )  
*JEA:	Yes. Punishing schedule of work. 
*BRE:	There are stupid people that  (  )  
*JEA:	I suppose they're making the money. 
*BRE:	Yeah aren't they? Right Bob and Glynis, tin of biscuits. The   tin of biscuits. They're all Stowmarket? 
*JEA:	Yes.  (.) I couldn't contemplate hauling that lot back. (.)  
*BRE:	Simon ask Richard. That's Stowmarket isn't it? 
*JEA:	Mm. (8.0)  
*BRE:	Well you've got   (.) all you've got left, you've got my presents to get tomorrow. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	And   (.) that leaves you with just five in Stowmarket. Wine and some biscuits. 
*JEA:	That's not bad is it? 
*BRE:	No 
*JEA:	I mean they're going to be very easy to buy. (9.0)  
*BRE:	And you've bought eighteen presents today. 
*JEA:	Oh my goodness! 
*BRE:	Eighteen people. 
*JEA:	I say!  (  ) . That's amazing isn't it? 
*BRE:	So you had thirty four people this year to buy for. 
*JEA:	Yes. 
*BRE:	 (  ) but I mean if you'd bought all the extras, last year you had about fifty. 
*JEA:	Yes. (.)  
*BRE:	So tokens are small, (  ) , paperback will be small, calendar will be small. So they're not major presents 
*JEA:	No they're not. No. 
*BRE:	tomorrow. 
*JEA:	They're not weighty ones. Brenda   (.) could you pass me up my, my box of, of er coloured ribbons and things. I just want to love and admire it.  ((laugh)) . It's so Christmassy!  (7.0)  (  ) . It's got gift tags hasn't it, as well as pretty. Ah.  (.) Incidentally I was glad that although I didn't feel   (.) one hundred percent I was glad that I wandered round Liberties. Because I went up to their fabric department   (  ) and   (.) I want to   (.) after Christmas I'm going to wash all the covers on the   (.) er settees, you know er   (.) the dralon. And I want to make if I can a couple of   (.) deeper coloured cushions and if I can   (.) I want to make tie-backs for the curtains because everything in that room is so blooming pale. 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	Well Liberties sell a fabric that they call   (.) poult, P O U L T   (.) for what was it? Two fifty. And they had acetate at four fifty. And they had the most marvellous colours. I think that they only intend them for linings. 
*BRE:	Oh that's what I wanna get. Some of that tomorrow. 
*JEA:	Well I will get some too. Put it down on my side as well.  (.) Because I'm not going to buy any more tree decorations this year. 
*BRE:	No. I'm  (  ) . Either last year or the year before. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	Now shall we see what we can get in this bag? 
*JEA:	Yes please. 
*BRE:	Right.  (.) Oh it's got a little padlock. 
*JEA:	Yes. Isn't it lovely! 
*BRE:	Has it got a key though?  (.) No. 
*JEA:	No it's just a little neat   (.) pretty thing. 
*BRE:	Actually you have got a key. 
*JEA:	 ((laughing)) Oh how nice . I thought it was just a decoration. 
*BRE:	No. You've got two keys. 
*JEA:	Well I never. (  )  
*BRE:	 (  ) gonna love that. Now if anybody pinches it   (.) alright they can   (.) break it, but 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	I'd leave the two big baskets will probably, I think all the smaller things in here. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	Do you? 
*JEA:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	 (  ) stand up.  (15.0)  (  )  (.)  (  )  (40.0)  (  )  (10.0) That's it isn't it? 
*JEA:	What about the erm   (.) the baskets, the toiletries. What do you think to do with those? 
*BRE:	I think put them   (.) in case in the Marks and Sparks bag. Cos they're quite heavyish. 
*JEA:	They are aren't they? Yes. 
*BRE:	Pack them very tight   (.) in one bag. (.)  
*JEA:	Mm. (.)  
*BRE:	These are gonna be the most awkward things. 
*JEA:	I wondered if they would go in there. 
*BRE:	No.  See. 
*JEA:	 Mo.  Just won't.  (10.0) Oh they do.  (.) Well that's very clever Brenda. 
*BRE:	No    (  )  (30.0) Do you want the hangers? Do you desperately need the hangers? 
*JEA:	No. 
*BRE:	Cos they're gonna be bulky. 
*JEA:	No. Hangers are a pain. 
*BRE:	Even if you   (.) had to after Christmas take it back   (.) they won't know. 
*JEA:	They don't worry about the hangers, no. 
*BRE:	You just say you don't have the hangers don't you? 
*JEA:	That's right. Yes.  (.) The hangers could in fact go, go in there because that looked to be rather a good hanger, frankly. 
*BRE:	Mm. (  )  
*JEA:	No, that one's a nuisance. That one's a nuisance. (.)  
*BRE:	That one's alright though. 
*JEA:	That one's fine. 
*BRE:	They're lovely  (  )  
*JEA:	They are beautiful. (.)  
*BRE:	It's not too heavy then. And you've got room in there if you want  (.)  
*JEA:	Have a little hold   (.) oh yes I can manage that for short distances. I think perhaps that can be thrown out because otherwise it's going to scratch that that nice tin. 
*BRE:	I can take the tin of biscuits out if you feel it's too heavy.  (.) Oh we can try it tomorrow, thinking about it. 
*JEA:	Yes.  (.) No I can lift that. I mean I couldn't walk for any great distance with it but   (.) I'm going to have taxis. 
*BRE:	 (  ) and get them to carry it. 
*JEA:	Yes. Yes. (.)  
*BRE:	Yeah that's gonna scratch it. 
*JEA:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	That'll be easier for you anyway 
*JEA:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	so you've got a bit of padding there you can put  (  )  
*JEA:	Yes. Yes. 
*BRE:	Pack the biscuits along with your clothes. Inside and it won't  (  )  
*JEA:	That's right. It won't get scratched. It's a lovely thing. 
*BRE:	You've got two   (.)  (  )  
*JEA:	Yeah. I'm wondering whether the things from that   (.) will lie in the top of this. Well we'll see when, when we get the things tomorrow. They're all going to be small aren't we, aren't they? They're going to be 
*BRE:	All  (  )  
*JEA:	tiny things tomorrow.  (.) Yeah. 
*BRE:	Course you've got your tree as well. 
*JEA:	Oh the tree!  (.) That could go in with the er wrapping paper couldn't it? 
*BRE:	They   (  ) to keep that separate. 
*JEA:	I suppose so. Yes. It hasn't got it's own tree shaped bag has it? A tall thin bag? 
*BRE:	No. No. Cos 
*JEA:	They were all big bags that we had? 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	Yeah.  (.) That's fine then. I don't mind looking after it. Yes. Yes. 
*BRE:	So it stays upright then.  (.) No, none of them are heavy. 
*JEA:	No.  (.) Ooh. (.)  
*BRE:	Well   (.) I spent today in Marks and Sparks or you spent. Seventy four pound was mine   (.) and a hundred and eighty five pound was yours. 
*JEA:	Yes. Yes. So you've got another seventy really. 
*BRE:	See there's a nice 
*JEA:	That's a beauty. 
*BRE:	That's better for your baskets. 
*JEA:	Oh yes. 
*BRE:	Cos they're a bit squashed in this one. 
*JEA:	Yes. 
*BRE:	What came in that, oh your bag. 
*JEA:	Yes! (8.0)  
*BRE:	That's better. 
*JEA:	Yes. 
*BRE:	 (  ) stuff out of that     (.)  (  )  (.) That's a dinky little bag. 
*JEA:	Yes. Isn't it nice. 
*BRE:	That can go in there. 
*JEA:	Yeah. I mean that's just little odd bits of underwear and such like. 
*BRE:	 (  ) put it in there and then fold that bag flat. 
*JEA:	Yes. Well I tell you what Brenda, I don't use this bag very much. If you don't mind I'll leave it with you. 
*BRE:	Leave it here and then   (  ) got it here for shopping here  (  ) . 
*JEA:	That's right. Yeah.
