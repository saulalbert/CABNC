@Comment:	conversation #12 (Tape 040805)
*FRA:	isn't it? •158701_158814•
        Unless that plate comes off mm  somebody's hit that with a soldering iron at some stage. •158864_159325•
        Mm •159329_159344•
*STE:	I mean there's no   •160373_160610•
*FRA:	Yeah, I know you can feel those there, they're just more or less flush with the heads. •160613_160908•
        Perhaps  we could try another one and see er •161997_166157•
*STE:	Are all heads the same   •166247_166406•
*FRA:	 ((cough)) 
*STE:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Well it's the later type innit, that one? •166465_166821•
*STE:	It's just that a lot of the heads have worn they  •166821_167271•
*FRA:	Mm  •167271_167279•
*STE:	don't look to bad. •167308_167488•
*FRA:	Oh that's quite a tidy looking one as well innit? •167625_167885•
*STE:	Yeah  worth switching on anyway, quite a few of them have got these er carriages in? •167970_168268•
*FRA:	No well they're not sure if that's the whole carriage but  •168303_168541•
*STE:	Quite a few have got them in. •168723_168901•
*FRA:	See what they look like on this one. •168988_169139•
        Oh it's a different different, totally different innit that one? •169394_169834•
        It's got nothing underneath that one has it? •169882_170028•
        If that bit can, you know, that's fixed  there's nothing for the  unless the tape just slides and sits •170420_171009•
*STE:	On the plastic. •171065_171123•
*FRA:	on the plastic. •171123_171188•
        Probably it does. •171210_171280•
*STE:	Plug it in and find out shall I? •171382_171515•
*FRA:	Yeah. •171515_171557•
        Looks quite tiny that one doesn't it? •171737_171913•
        We might've been, might be pleasantly surprised with these. •171942_172182•
*STE:	Yeah     •173924_173969•
*FRA:	Right ah  I'm gonna have a delve and see if I can find a similar model. •175058_175653•
        There's one at the bottom there. •176315_176420•
