*CHR:	It looks as if over there stuck on the wall they've got a  rechargeable for hoover for taking crumbs off the tables. •220435_227195•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Well as it's used in other muckier places I tend not to use it over cleaning table white cloths  aah •228345_244375•
*NOR:	I'm very well fed. •244375_248765•

*NOR:	No  today you see a lot of people wearing large earrings don't you? •285395_292885•
*CHR:	Yes. •293345_293625•
*NOR:	Is that why you wear such small ones? •293625_296545•
*CHR:	As  so claims  that was a rather naff comment actually, I can't imagine that, well I can imagine other people wearing big earrings because they're super confident. •297485_307608•
*NOR:	Then you obviously had a  you did say   such a lot of  in the Radio Times somewhere I was reading today about er colours you wear. •307608_332128•
*CHR:	Oh yes. •332298_332448•
*NOR:	And how people who wear red  go in in business situations go in to assert power  you know I mean •332448_342918•
*CHR:	You do mean women in red suits presumably not men in red ties! •343438_346188•
*NOR:	No, men in red ties as well. •346188_347458•
*CHR:	Oh really? •348128_348468•
*NOR:	Yes  When I put on red one day, I mean I don't think I have anything in red do I, but when I put on my clothes in the morning •348508_361088•
*LYN:	Would you like some more coffee? •361088_361788•
*CHR:	No thank would you like some more coffee? •362198_363578•

*CHR:	Could we have the bill please? •364428_365398•
*LYN:	Yes. •365398_365498•
*NOR:	Erm  I'm influenced by all kinds of things  but I'm sure I'm not influenced by wishing for certain power or not. •365498_378168•
*CHR:	You don't need to. •379138_379878•
*NOR:	No, but I mean there are other such reasons  I mean there may be  initially choosing clothes or something like that, but when I put them on in the morning  I usually put them on to suit the weather  and what's clean and what I've got tights to match. •380548_400168•
*CHR:	Yes. •401158_401678•
*NOR:	Which shoes are comfortable today. •402138_403998•
