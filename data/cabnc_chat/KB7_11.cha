        She kept raising her eyebrows and laughing. •128623_128928•
        I was watching her. •128928_129014•
*STU:	Well I couldn't see her cos I had my back turned. •129014_129209•

        When you do know a bit about it you yes you want to know  •129803_130411•
*ANN:	Well that's it. •130411_130504•
        You're not, and you're not gonna be blinded by all these  like he was, what was he saying about  all endowments are are not unit then you were saying yes they are and   •130505_131622•
*STU:	I didn't know  what  on about there. •131622_131813•
        I I think he got his •131866_131969•
*ANN:	said that. •131969_131992•
*STU:	Oh he knew what he was talking about but  •131992_132211•
*ANN:	But you were confusing him because you knew, where he's used to just sitting there and telling blah blah blah blah and •132211_132777•
*STU:	Well you see the thing is they they they  •132777_132904•
*ANN:	And you knew what he was on about. •132904_133044•
*STU:	they quote this unit linked business. •133061_133267•
        Now it's all  •133275_133403•
*ANN:	And you didn't want that did you? •133403_133529•
*STU:	well and good a unit linked policy but  as I said to you before that  if they, if the market crashes the day before your policy is due out you  •133529_134410•
*ANN:	And you haven't got enough money. •134410_134542•
*STU:	you could, you can lose a I don't want one. •134548_134823•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	If the market crashes the day before you take your policy's due to mature  wallop. •134830_135505•
        You can lose a lot of money in a  you know, just like that. •135511_135762•
*ANN:	But do you think this thing what he was on about, pension  mortgage, do you think that would be better? •135762_136247•
        Was that that PEP thing what's all in the papers at the moment? •136247_136681•
*STU:	No. •136681_136687•
*ANN:	Is that what it means? •136687_136770•
*STU:	PEP's different. •136770_136841•
*ANN:	Oh. •136878_136891•
        Is it similar? •136891_136997•
*STU:	PEP's a personal equity plan. •136997_137155•
*ANN:	Oh. •137237_137261•
        Sorry. •137261_137271•
*STU:	Which is different. •137302_137571•
        To be perfectly honest  in my current situation •137571_138173•
*ANN:	Mhm. •138385_138391•
*STU:	a pension mortgage  would be more advantageous. •138397_138785•
*ANN:	Well that's the most important thing isn't it? •138806_139101•
*STU:	At the moment. •139129_139322•
        Because well I'm not in a pension scheme at work. •139333_139635•
        But I have got an option to go in it •139635_139757•
*ANN:	Yeah. •139757_139763•
*STU:	if I want to. •139767_139893•
*ANN:	Mhm. •139968_139976•
*STU:	Erm  the only problem is  well, even even, not so much now because  because the er   a bit better. •140088_141461•
        Because of the because of the way pensions and that are are organized now, they're more flexible now  I mean, you can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension scheme, you were obliged to go in it  that was it. •141710_143288•
        All your other arrangements went up, went through the window. •143342_143544•
*ANN:	Mm. •143774_143795•
*STU:	Erm so it it it it's difficult. •143864_144157•
*ANN:	Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays can't you and  into a  •144157_144440•
*STU:	You can now take, now now now you can take them with you. •144440_144768•
*ANN:	Mm. •144768_144778•
        Where they used to be frozen and then you started another one wherever you went next time. •144778_145099•
*STU:	That's right. •145100_145129•
        That's right. •145130_145155•
        Whereas now   •145155_145233•
*ANN:	And you ended up with three four silly little bits and pieces didn't you? •145233_145521•
*STU:	Yeah. •145551_145557•
        Yeah. •145604_145622•
        Whereas now you see all they can put them all into one. •145622_145805•
*ANN:	Yeah. •145858_145861•
        I know you can take them with you now. •145861_146022•
*STU:	Mm. •146294_146318•
        So in a way I think •146360_146415•
*ANN:	And it was a lot less money as well wasn't it? •146415_146586•
*STU:	I mm yeah but that don't forget  •146586_146726•
*ANN:	It started  •146732_146759•
*STU:	that was sixty five. •146759_146891•
*ANN:	Yeah . •146901_146921•
*STU:	The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true they double every five years. •146921_147478•
        Particularly in the later years there's you know •147478_147654•
*ANN:	Mm. •147769_147775•
*STU:	more  And that's why I said, when it sounded so low  that's why I I still doubt his figures. •147775_148397•
        I still think two hundred pound a month  a thirty thousand pound mortgage  it's too low. •148397_148937•
*ANN:	And and a cash sum at the end of it. •148937_149077•
*STU:	Still think it's low. •149077_149237•
*ANN:	Seems quite  doesn't seem a lot does it? •149237_149475•
*STU:	No. •149482_149488•
        I'm pretty certain  •149489_149665•
*ANN:	And would you still have to have an insurance on top of that? •149665_149885•
*STU:	You have to have term assurance. •149885_150045•
*ANN:	So you'd still have to have  •150045_150189•
*STU:	You'd have •150190_150211•
*ANN:	you'd have the two hundred pound and then you'd have a life insurance on top? •150212_150449•
*STU:	No no no. •150449_150506•
        No. •150506_150515•
        That was it, two hundred and twelve pound  •150615_150724•
*ANN:	The whole lot? •150724_150870•
*STU:	The whole lot. •150870_150964•
*ANN:	Well why doesn't everybody have them then? •150964_151133•
*STU:	Because not everybody's eligible for them. •151162_151409•
*ANN:	I know but they didn't, he didn't suggest it to you or  why doesn't he say well there is this er er, you said that he didn't. •151409_152151•
        And he must have known that they're gonna be cheaper so why doesn't he advise people who are starting out to take one of them? •152151_152685•
*STU:	Didn't ask  •152686_152751•
*ANN:	Rather than a •152774_152786•
*STU:	Didn't ask the questions. •152787_152970•
*ANN:	I know, exactly. •152970_153057•
        But surely that's  •153057_153105•
*STU:	He didn't  he  •153105_153132•
*ANN:	his job. •153132_153162•
        If he's trying to find you the cheapest •153162_153341•
*STU:	He's not doing his job. •153342_153528•
        Basically  •153528_153576•
*ANN:	Exactly. •153616_153630•
*STU:	he's not doing his job. •153631_153761•
*ANN:	Because a young couple going in  well even in our situation, you haven't got much money and you want the cheapest thing for the best  you know. •153772_154654•
        But he never suggested it. •154711_154797•
        You said  what about a company, what about a a pension mortgage and he  •154797_155213•
*STU:	He didn't, he he didn't ask the question. •155213_155421•
        Which he should have asked. •155421_155507•
*ANN:	Mm. •155507_155559•
        Exactly. •155593_155605•
        Yeah because it is cheaper and •155605_155728•
*STU:	You see the thing is  you see I mean when this  law came out, LAUTRO and all that business came out  that, and best advice and all this sort of thing  you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing. •155745_157357•
        What they've got insurance already  erm so on and so forth. •157459_157749•
        And arrange around those circumstances the best advice  package. •157962_158374•
*ANN:	Mm. •158374_158391•
*STU:	But he didn't ask me the questions. •158391_158770•
        He just  he just  he just  •158770_159062•
*ANN:	No he just could do an endowment one and that was it. •159062_159267•
*STU:	he just assumed it was gonna be •159267_159474•
*ANN:	An an endowment policy, and endowment mortgage and that was it. •159474_159833•
        He didn't tell you anything else. •159833_159934•
*STU:	No. •159939_159952•
        Well you see when he said your base is gonna be  •160160_160428•
*ANN:	I know. •160428_160437•
*STU:	a hundred and two hundred  •160437_160585•
*ANN:	Ninety six. •160585_160621•
*STU:	and fifteen pounds or whatever  •160621_160759•
*ANN:	Two hundred and five and then that  on a ninety six  •160767_160971•
*STU:	And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a first time buyer. •160971_161331•
*ANN:	Mm. •161335_161345•
*STU:	That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six  for the first year. •161390_161757•
        Then it goes back up to the base rate. •161757_161919•
*ANN:	Yeah. •161919_161928•
*STU:	Not, I know all that's that's obvious. •161928_162059•
*ANN:	That's quite clear. •162060_162117•
        Mm. •162117_162126•
*STU:	But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a  pension mortgage  I thought well if a hundred and ninety  •162211_163035•
*ANN:	That's only five pound a month to earn your pension. •163036_163211•
*STU:	if a if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how come you don't  •163211_163497•
*ANN:	That gives you five pound a month towards your pension which is nothing is it? •163511_163761•
*STU:	how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with, because of the term assurance on top. •163761_165138•
        That's fourteen pounds a month term assurance. •165139_165432•
        Quite high I think. •165432_165505•
*ANN:	What's term assurance? •165506_165696•
        Don't understand that. •165697_165746•
*STU:	Term assurance is  life insurance  just on life only. •165883_166166•
        With no cash sum at the end. •166166_166251•
*ANN:	Well if you died  you'd be dead. •166251_166439•
        Well that's fair enough isn't it? •166439_166562•
        You wouldn't want anything else. •166562_166644•
*STU:	But er throughout throughout the term of my life  •166644_166822•
*ANN:	And if you died the  would be paid. •166943_167100•
*STU:	If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable. •167100_167548•
*ANN:	That's it, you'd pay   •167549_167863•
*STU:	But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high. •167863_168104•
        Term assurance. •168104_168130•
        I'm tempted, I'm I'm I'm tempted to have a word with Mick. •168131_169091•
*ANN:	What and arrange your own? •169091_169251•
*STU:	Well •169251_169254•
*ANN:	Or he'd just tell you? •169254_169397•
*STU:	well I, whether I, I don't know whether he would or whether he wouldn't. •169397_169583•
        I mean he might  he might not but  then again he might. •169583_170057•
        He might if I, if I talk to him he might tell me what sort of  I don't want to hassle him you see cos I've hassled  •170057_170645•
*ANN:	No, that's it. •170645_170670•
*STU:	him before . •170670_170730•
        Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort of thing and I don't wanna  I'd like to know. •170730_171729•
*ANN:	Mm. •171729_171735•
*STU:	I'd like to know  before you know  •171736_172243•
*ANN:	You've got to get the right deal. •172244_172346•
*STU:	Yeah. •172497_172501•
        I, I did  two hundred and one pound a month or two hundred and okay it sounds cheap but  I don't know fourteen pound a month just for thirty thousand pound life cover over  suppose it's the  •172501_173575•
*ANN:	Yeah but that's not that much a  •173777_173880•
*STU:	I suppose it's the term of years. •173889_173996•
*ANN:	It's only three quid a a week. •173997_174142•
*STU:	Yeah but I suppose it's the term of years as well. •174212_174349•
        You sort of to sixty five rather than at sixty. •174367_174603•
*ANN:	Well that's it. •174603_174764•
*STU:	So that probably makes it but I say without having me own book  to check it I can't •174855_175350•
*ANN:	Mm. •175350_175353•
*STU:	I can't tell you. •175353_175566•
        You see you can, you get a lot, you can get tax relief off that or you used to be able to get tax relief. •175566_175976•
*ANN:	Well he said you could get tax relief on the whole lot. •175976_176129•
*STU:	On the whole lot, yeah. •176129_176262•
*ANN:	That's what he said. •176263_176317•
        At twenty five percent. •176368_176472•
*STU:	At twenty five percent. •176472_176553•
        I think you still, I'm not sure whether they've changed the law round or not cos they •176563_176900•
*ANN:	Well that's what he said didn't he? •176900_177007•
*STU:	Yeah. •177144_177147•
*ANN:	Er you'd be handy for a a tax relief on the whole lot rather than just •177170_177591•
*STU:	Yeah. •177896_177911•
*ANN:	part of it. •177980_178025•
*STU:	Cos that  you see if you, if you, if you could link up  life assurance to your pension  you could get tax relief on your life assurance you see? •178025_179394•
*ANN:	Mm. •179394_179403•
*STU:	Which makes it advantageous  because there's no tax relief on life policies now as there was •179403_179913•
*STU:	There used to be, yeah. •179913_179979•
*ANN:	There used to be but there is no  •179979_180113•
*ANN:	But they stopped it. •180113_180167•
*STU:	there is, they stopped it. •180167_180253•
        There isn't any more. •180364_180716•
*ANN:	Mm. •180716_180723•
*STU:	No, I'm sort of I think he confused himself as well as confusing me slightly   •180723_181227•
*ANN:	Yeah because you  you confused him. •181227_181474•
*STU:	Yeah. •181616_181642•
*ANN:	Because you knew. •181642_181830•
*STU:	Mm. •181830_181862•
*ANN:	Rather than somebody as I say like me who sat down there and he'd just quote all these figures and you wouldn't know what the hell he was on about and just, all you, all I would understand at the end is  that's what you gotta pay. •181925_182870•
*STU:	Mm. •183009_183033•
*ANN:	Which is what most people that go in there •183033_183241•
*STU:	Are interested in. •183255_183458•
*ANN:	Well they wouldn't understand all the rest. •183458_183597•
        This plan, that plan, the other plan. •183603_183736•
        They only know well  you either have this option paying this amount, that option paying that amount or that option paying that amount and which one do you want to have. •183736_184623•
*STU:	Mm. •184623_184635•
*ANN:	And and you don't understand any of the rest of it. •184635_184864•
*STU:	No. •184864_184870•
        No. •184930_184937•
*ANN:	You just sit there mm yeah mm no mm  well that's the cheapest, that's the dearest and  and take their  advice which ones the best for you and have it . •184937_186192•
        And that's er that's all normal  people who don't understand any of it  that's the way they'd go about it isn't it? •186192_186849•
*STU:	Yeah. •186967_186977•
*ANN:	You'd just accept whatever was  •186978_187126•
*STU:	See the other thing, I don't know  well no I'm not sure you can now. •187460_187840•
        See if I took a pension  mortgage out it would be linked to me  lumped into me current  pension contract. •187840_188564•
        Cos I've already got a pension  scheme running. •188564_189211•
        Cos I've contracted out of SERPS. •189211_189293•
        And also got  erm  erm what used to be called  seventy seven. •189566_190442•

*STU:	Discount. •213185_213201•
        Yeah. •213321_213350•

*STU:	Mm. •241461_241484•
*ANN:	sort it all out. •241484_241535•
        You don't pay it separate, I didn't. •241590_241861•
        I paid to council offices. •241861_242031•

*STU:	Mm. •243853_243856•
*ANN:	I could have had it done through the bank but he was always up town anyway so •243856_244339•
*STU:	Mm. •244373_244379•
        So it didn't make any difference. •244379_244632•
*ANN:	didn't make any difference one way or the other. •244633_244797•
*STU:	Mm. •244858_244864•
        Mm. •244875_244881•
*STU:	So how about you? •244881_244928•

*STU:	Mm. •245446_245455•
*ANN:	Save you going to the bank. •245455_245880•

*STU:	But I I I I I I I it it just sounds  you know two hundred pounds a month, just over two hundred pound a month   •247265_247758•
*ANN:	Sounds smashing dunnit? •247849_247929•
*STU:	Sounds wonderful. •247963_248060•
*ANN:	That's what I said, why doesn't everybody have them? •248061_248399•
*STU:	Well that's why I can't believe it. •248410_248724•

*STU:	Well I I I yeah. •249748_249932•
        I mean obviously I'd have to pay more  er for if I want it to  end at sixty. •249932_250470•
*ANN:	Mm. •250570_250582•
        But even then it won't be  will it be that much? •250582_250717•
*STU:	To get  to get a higher lump sum. •250717_250832•
        To get a higher lump sum. •250832_250936•
        But then you see  •250985_251019•
*ANN:	Would it be that much more? •251019_251113•
*STU:	Shouldn't think so. •251114_251245•
*ANN:	Well exactly. •251245_251288•
        So it's gonna  •251288_251324•
*STU:	You see it's  •251324_251351•
*ANN:	be less than a  want two hundred and eighty. •251351_251720•
*STU:	Oh yeah. •251720_251824•
*ANN:	I said so you might as well have that and have a lump sum and a blooming house and •251824_252092•
*STU:	And a pension. •252168_252232•
*ANN:	And a pension. •252232_252292•
        That's what I mean. •252293_252522•
        Might as well have your pension. •252536_253038•
        when you get to sixty. •253038_253092•
*STU:	Mm. •253092_253124•
        Say it's only twenty six years and  course with a pension see you can increase your contributions. •253150_253976•
*ANN:	Yeah. •253976_253986•
        If if you get a better job and what have you you can always  •253994_254252•
*STU:	Better job or whatever or  pay rise or whatever you can increase  •254252_254488•
*ANN:	Yeah you  •254488_254502•
*STU:	your contributions into your pension plan •254502_254754•
*ANN:	Exactly, yes. •254754_254769•
*STU:	and still, and finish your mortgage earlier. •254769_254936•
*ANN:	Yeah. •254936_254955•
*STU:	Fifty five. •254955_255005•
*ANN:	Mm. •255005_255008•
*STU:	Or fifty. •255134_255179•
        Depending on how much you wanna pay. •255191_255482•
*ANN:	Mm. •255482_255489•
*STU:	If you wanna pay more into it. •255489_255685•
        But I still think  •255685_256064•
*ANN:	Well see what he comes up with. •256064_256461•
*STU:	See what he comes up with, yeah. •256461_256668•
        See what he comes up with. •256671_256760•
*ANN:	And certainly  say  two hundred and twenty five pound a month it's still worth having. •256857_257226•
*STU:	It's cheaper than we're paying now isn't it? •257227_257442•
*ANN:	Mm. •257442_257451•
        Even if it's two hundred and fifty it  the same  •257536_257634•
*STU:	Well you'd still  •257696_257755•
*ANN:	you're gonna have a pension and and a home. •257756_257997•
*STU:	In a way I'd rather pay the same  and finish the mortgage earlier. •257997_258593•
*ANN:	Yeah well that's it. •258593_258653•
        You could volunteer to pay two hundred and fifty a month couldn't you? •258653_258893•
*STU:	And pay a higher pension  policy. •258998_259237•
*ANN:	Mhm. •259323_259337•
        That's what I mean. •259338_259373•
*STU:	And then and then you've got the option  then you've got the further option that if you want to reduce your premiums on your pension  you can do. •259373_260122•
*ANN:	If anything happened. •260137_260193•
        Mm. •260193_260199•
*STU:	If anything  if  if it does  You see again and then you see if you're out of a job you see you  if you happen to be out of a job then you're not eligible for a pension policy. •260212_261407•
*ANN:	What happens then then? •261407_261466•
        If you get made redundant? •261466_261594•
*STU:	Well. •261594_261600•
*ANN:	And you've already got it. •261600_261790•
*STU:	Well, then you have to freeze it. •261813_262121•
        See that's that's the that's another drawback with the pension. •262121_262468•
        Whereas an endowment policy it doesn't matter. •262481_262670•
        You you can carry on paying an endowment policy. •262670_263290•
        So it, you know  there's pros and cons either way. •263312_263662•
*ANN:	Mm. •263663_263664•
*STU:	There's there's er pros and cons in buying either of either of the flats. •263664_263877•
        You see er that's the thing isn't it? •263899_264488•
*ANN:	Mhm. •264488_264509•
        But you've got to make the decision cos I like both of them very much. •264510_264830•
*STU:	I do. •264830_264928•
*ANN:	So therefore you have to make the decision which one, if it comes down to it, would you like to live in. •264928_265843•
        I mean if we could get that one down at  New Drove what is it, twenty nine? •265843_266385•
        So that's gonna be, say if you get  fifteen hundred off it  it's gonna be twenty eight. •266386_267001•
*STU:	Call it, it's thirty thousand isn't it? •267001_267152•
*ANN:	Yeah. •267152_267158•
*STU:	What is it, twenty nine nine nine five. •267167_267251•
        You might as well call it thirty thousand   •267251_267473•
*ANN:	Well say you get twenty eight and a half. •267473_267995•
        You're gonna get it cheaper  the the monthly payment is cheaper. •267995_268734•
        And then and then you could afford to buy some blooming carpets. •268750_269271•
        And with the other one you've got to find a deposit which you'd have to pay back. •269281_270023•
*STU:	But you wouldn't have to buy any carpets. •270023_270192•
*ANN:	You wouldn't have to buy the carpets. •270193_270558•
*STU:	And  you say we'd  gonna have to have a cooker and a fridge and that aren't you? •270564_270886•
*ANN:	Well a cooker you definitely, a fridge  say we could perhaps borrow that one of mum's until we could afford one. •270904_271322•
        Or pick up a cheap one. •271325_271544•
*STU:	Unless  I say if you knocked him down. •271583_271779•
*ANN:	But a cooker's no problem because I know you can go into the Electricity Board and say  I'm moving into a new property, I haven't got a cooker  and they would, you can get them. •271779_272802•
        No deposit, just added to your electric bill. •272832_273130•
        That's a way to  because •273143_273283•
*STU:	Oh buying it on some sort of •273283_273453•
*ANN:	Oh yeah on er er a financial agreement. •273453_273636•
*STU:	Or  look around and see what there is going in the, in the market. •273636_273937•
        And get a sort of  •273937_274211•
*ANN:	Second hand one. •274211_274277•
*STU:	no percent  free credit. •274342_274529•
*ANN:	Yeah. •274552_274564•
        I mean there's no difficulty in getting a cooker. •274570_275006•
*STU:	Say if we  I mean if, if we're paying say  two hundred pound a month  on a mortgage •275045_275522•
*ANN:	Mm. •275522_275559•
*STU:	for twenty eight thousand . •275568_275673•
