@Comment:	conversation #13 (Tape 029102)
*ENA:	Perhaps I shouldn't do this yet cos we haven't agreed it! •1875_6285•
        But we have a new secretary. •6725_8125•
        Er, if you agree it and  report. •8605_10365•
        And I'm gonna ask Catherine to stand up so that you can all see who she is. •11595_15125•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	We're involved in  bringing things together, we're involved lots of things and  •19805_23625•
*UNK:	At the back in black. •23625_24635•
*ENA:	there are lots of things   •24635_25605•
*UNK:	At the back in black. •25795_26995•
*ENA:	committee, if you go downstairs you will see on the notice there a display of various things that we do, and on the windowsills there are  various pieces of information  free  sheets that you can pick up and take away it will tell you about all sorts of issues! •28225_43805•
        The way in which society  imposes an agenda on us  asks us questions in the churches. •44175_50635•
        I think we're not too bad in doing that. •52445_54515•
        But what we  need to do  as well, is to listen to what the churches are saying as they address these issues. •55645_61235•
        And I want to  erm  ask you please  if you have any comments about the work of The Old Church and Society Committee, the work we do for Synod and in the provence  please make those comments known  to Catherine or to your district representative! •62505_76735•
        We need to hear from the local churches, from the district councils what's going on  what the issues that concern you are  so let's  as well the ones that you see downstairs, we may already be addressing so have a look down there  have a look at the, the information  but if there are any issues you feel we ought to be addressing then please let us know so that we can put them on our agenda. •78455_100875•
        That's all I want to say  except to er, who, that Synod received the report of the Church and Society committee? •101085_107875•
        I'm assuming you've read that report? •108225_109625•
        Have you received it? •109785_111425•
*UNK:	Yeah. •111425_111515•
*UNK:	Yes. •112375_112445•
*JOH:	Does anybody wish to make any comments or  ask any questions about this particular section? •112555_123685•
        Don't think that's a lack of interest, I think it's matter of discipline! •123685_127975•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	Oh Good! •127975_129775•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	Okay then.. •129775_129985•
*JOH:	Thank you Peter and thank you Catherine  erm  we will give the view  in due course. •130185_136485•
        We move to the DP committee report which is on page seventeen. •136485_138635•
        I'm gonna go very speedily and ask that we receive this report for debate. •138745_144595•
        Good! •144685_145015•
*UNK:	Yes. •146355_146695•
*JOH:	Any comments on any section that is not pertaining to the resolution that was on page nineteen? •146695_151995•
        Erm  one from Mike    Mike? •151995_155355•
*ALA:	and  is that  , I always feel threatened  or paranoid  I just want to make a point on  on paragraph seven  the rule in which to review the  is that  my understanding that  review will be about  the role and   of the rule in which the  . •158496_180296•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	We will note that in a minute. •180746_184006•
*ALA:	Right. •184006_184216•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Er •184216_184366•
*UNK:	I just wanna refer to item one which is to do with the Synod . •184586_188536•
*JOH:	That's actually  a different resolution. •188666_190876•
*UNK:	Is it? •190876_191726•
*JOH:	So we come back to that. •191756_195246•
*UNK:	Well  •195486_195896•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Do you wannit    •196406_199056•
*JOH:	Ah! ah! •199056_201256•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Right  I would say  •201256_201606•
*JOH:	Sorry! •201606_201706•
        Sorry! •201796_201996•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Any other comments about any other questions not pertaining to the resolution there? •202166_208076•
        We therefore come to resolution two  in which   to make it to paragraph one   •208196_215806•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	You're so gracious John! •216106_218316•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	So  it's just simply to er  comment about the  the future work that's gonna be done by Glanmole er, the work of investigation as I understand it at the end of that first section. •218316_228866•
*UNK:	Really, two things brought up investigation to consider  the first is with  trusts  the very important piece of work that's done by trusts on behalf of the provence  another provence may or may not know that there are the trusts have now been  er, between trusts  erm  South Wales trusts  erm •228866_250726•
*UNK:	Monmouthshire  •250726_250786•
*UNK:	North Wales trust and Monmouthshire have now all been amalgamated into one  and we're working through the implications of that. •252266_260066•
        And we have had the trust secretary who has been working on our behalf voluntarily  for some time now. •260196_267326•
        I don't think anybody appreciates just how much, and I would like to put it on record, how much George  does  on behalf of the provence  a very considerable piece of work! •267326_276711•
        If you  were part of the trust meetings and saw the degree of work that he does do regularly on our behalf it is quite considerable  he doesn't do it for nothing! •276791_285911•
        I can't imagine that George is gonna continuing  doing that forever  and it may well be that we'll be faced with a possibility of, of what we do in the future  to have that piece of administration done  will we be able to assume that it could done voluntary in the future? •285981_300091•
        Or will it be part of the administrative task of the church? •300361_305401•
        So I'd, I'd like that to be  er  considered  er, when this whole investigation is carried on. •305401_311571•
        And the second point too, is to say  is to ask, at least to consider, whether then in some centres the work of the Synod ought to be trimmed down to match  the particular work  that is being done. •311671_323291•
        I mean , is it all, you know, do we need all the time to have  erm  extra administrative help and in in, and in terms of which we've been talking about before, I know they might sound like two conflicting issues  but one of the ways of ensuring we get the work done  is  do we trying too much at the Synod? •323291_339321•
        Should we be thrusting more work down to districts  and , and they'll  to do the job rather than always assume it should be done at this level? •339471_346311•
*JOH:	I think, I'm not going to encourage debate on that  I think we've heard what Kenneth said  particularly about the trusts  the working done by the trust  and would  suggest that we ask Granville to take that on board as well and be within the  presentations too. •349761_364391•
        And I think some would be  the less about the  too much work perhaps being done by Synod  and not enough by districts. •364741_372051•
        I think it is something that we should  encourage churches to talk about, the districts to talk about  speaking of the district secretary  I ! •372261_380691•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	But  there we are  I I think we'll just take that on board like that. •380941_388471•
        Erm, resolution that Synod appoints , John  as Synod clerk for a period of up to three years  to commence at a date mutually convenient to him  and the present Synod clerk. •388471_397805•
        Those in favour of that resolution? •398335_405045•
        Any against? •405045_405505•
        Right,. •406885_407105•
        I think  erm  we are not going to say thank you to Eileen now  because  she is not finishing as Synod clerk and that's a conscious decision. •407525_417415•
        It may be that  er, Eileen will be Synod clerk this time  next year as well we don't know. •417415_423175•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Synod will divulge a degree of no, quite seriously, a degree of flexibility  and we're grateful both to Eileen and er, to John  for allowing that degree of flexibility to take place. •423365_434115•
        And Synod will of course will be informed  er, •436125_439475•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	when, when Synod clerk has changed. •439475_442625•
        But we're grateful to Eileen for what she is doing  and will continue to do  and we're grateful to John for what he intends to do  erm  for three years at any stage  at any stage in which they choose. •442625_454465•
        thank you. •456255_458015•
        Then  resolution three that Synod appoints the Reverend David , Henry  and Nanette  as the , as representatives on the Mission Council  and this pertaining to paragraph two. •458015_469693•
        Firstly, I think I should say that  straight away one hopes that these three   erm, and that's regrettable! •470593_480173•
        But the background is that of fifty letters were sent out to a variety of people  er, lay and ordained  whatever that means! •480253_490063•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Erm  asking for permission to put their names forward  and from the, the few letters we had  the, this was  that we thought was the whitest knights  in terms of Geography  in terms of sex  in terms of I wouldn't say intelligence, perhaps I should try to impress them! •490213_510483•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Erm  are there any comments or questions ? •510693_511963•
        Those, those supporting that please show? •512013_518443•
        Against? •518523_518753•
        Erm  now this present report is no longer necessary  erm  because paragraph three is now no longer accurate  erm, because a change that took place in the General Assembly Executive Committee  last  the week before last. •520873_545143•
        My feeling is  that it wouldn't have  when there's a been a change  perhaps  there could be no  from the   •545143_555623•
*UNK:	 ((sneeze)) 
*JOH:	the secretary  and as semi-executive now does not apply to this  I would suggest that somebody, unconstitutionally, intervenes the Synod advocate  and ignore this resolution  and continue with the second Saturday of March  and the second Saturday in April. •555623_573373•
        Can you agree? •573373_574463•
         •575353_•
*UNK:	Yes. •575563_576013•
*UNK:	Agreed. •576553_576613•
*JOH:	Yes,. •576613_576703•
        Does Synod accept the nominations in section ten? •577603_582883•
        These nominations are  , clearly written. •583143_586113•
*UNK:	Yes, if we could make a comment please the thing about  in July? •586503_590183•
*JOH:	Yes. •590363_590433•
*UNK:	Could it be looked at? •591063_594363•
*JOH:	Well it's erm    and  the  see if you could another appointment  erm  for when he has got  . •594363_602083•
*UNK:	That's okay. •602143_604603•
*JOH:	Those in agreement with  resolution five please show? •604613_609903•
        And when we come to resolution six  er, there is only one district council  which has a made a nomination for the  erm  moderator for general assembly for ninety  three, ninety four? •610213_628643•
        And that was Mid-Wales district council. •628923_632183•
        You will all find yellow sheets of paper  if   wondering why we're reading about  the . •632183_639183•
        Mid-Wales district council  erm  I think unanimously  wish to put this nomination of reverence in the past  erm  and  the  nomination  for moderator of general assembly  from ninety three  to ninety four. •639433_658173•
        They have read  it was proposed and seconded by the Reverends  erm Mike  and Gethwyn   and if  there any questions  I am sure that they are  to answer questions  rather than ask them to speak to us. •658313_674855•
*UNK:	, thank you. •674855_675585•
*JOH:	There was quite  a lot of discussion in the Mid-Wales District Council about this nomination  erm  it wasn't , that reminds me  yes it was   •676915_697875•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	all members  votes  voted in favour of it. •698275_702105•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Erm  so it had been thought about quite seriously. •702105_704185•
        Is Synod willing to take this  for the general assembly as a nomination  for  erm  if she agrees to nomination for  moderator general assembly. •704185_714335•
*UNK:	Yeah. •714335_714735•
*UNK:	Could I, could I just ask what particular element she has for Wales to nominate, why why, why was Wales nominated ? •715165_722065•
        Any, you know particular reason for that, having got David here  ah I I  I've decided to go through actually. •722245_729965•
*UNK:	But how? •730095_730495•
*UNK:	But I I of course felt the  of giving me something that he would be known by everybody in Wales. •730555_736205•
        Er  and therefore, I would of thought that was a  everyone   but I'm just wondering why it is that now  what   of Wales? •736265_744025•
*JOH:	Are there any other questions  to refer to district council? •744085_748095•
*UNK:	No. •748845_749025•
*JOH:	Can you answer? •749195_749735•
*BOB:	Well I felt one of two ways, firstly when we're looking for a moderator of the URC we're looking for a moderator for the whole church. •751765_757545•
        And secondly, in terms of Liz   Liz  is someone I know extremely well and have worked with  in various functions and committees over the past. •757545_765065•
        We have someone always there  for those  who have  er, society  those who are poor  er, women  er, many of the issues that we feel  very strongly  and here, here  She had no  sort of cultural  historic resonance  with the nation of Wales  but I'm sure her   and the way she approaches her whole ministry would mean that she'd have a lot of  than those of us here  in the URC  in Wales. •765105_789875•
*JOH:	The resolution is, comes before you from Mid-Wales district council, those in favour of sending  er, Elizabeth's nomination forward, if she agrees to that  please show? •789955_801595•
        Those against? •801595_801815•
        That is carried. •802605_805355•
        We've come, I think to the end of our business, which is good! •805355_810805•
        You will have tea at half past four which is  which is  er splendid! •810935_815405•
        There are a couple of things I would like to say  one is that you will find  people have asked regards  the paper which David mentioned in Northern Ireland  that has been distributed  it was pinned to another sheet of paper  erm, headed The Last Attempt  and there are more copies available  it's simply to know  where to find that . •815405_836775•
        We must have three minutes of relaxation before beginning Synod. •836935_841965•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Before beginning . •841965_842965•
        Thank you for  before , before you start   the  please  please  we haven't quite finished! •842965_857245•
        Before we actually have that three minute break  erm, I think we should formally thank the Church of England of Holywell  for its hospitality laid down . •857865_866505•
