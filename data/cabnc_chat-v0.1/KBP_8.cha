        Yes. •360625_362525•
*NIN:	Yes. •362525_363425•
        I think erm  we'll have to have a trip to St Ishmal's for that. •363425_413625•
*CLA:	Probably. •427825_430825•
        Where else could we go? •430825_445825•
*NIN:	Erm well we do  •445825_452925•
*CLA:	Other than that er rather expensive •457725_467125•
*NIN:	Well what I, I do like about St Ishmal's is the way it's laid out and   •467125_504925•
*CLA:	It's laid out but the plants look healthy and they're kept in healthy conditions. •508525_542925•
*NIN:	They do. •542925_545425•
        Yeah. •550225_550825•
*CLA:	Mhm. •550825_552325•
        To me that Dingle place •553025_567525•
*NIN:	I wasn't very struck on that. •571125_583525•
*CLA:	I wasn't at all struck, no. •583525_595625•
*NIN:	No I wasn't. •595625_620225•
*CLA:	There were all weeds growing among the plants they're selling. •620525_638025•
*NIN:	Messy. •638025_639325•
*CLA:	Yes, messy. •639325_642025•
        And it wasn't just the messiness, I don't mind that, but •642025_667525•
*NIN:	No. •667525_671125•
*CLA:	They weren't looked after. •688625_694925•
*NIN:	cos you  it was difficult to find  the things that you you want  oh I don't know, it was just •696625_762225•
*CLA:	Mm. •776625_780625•
*NIN:	it didn't erm didn't appeal to me somehow. •780625_800325•
*CLA:	No. •800325_801125•
*NIN:	But erm I remember when we got the original broom that we've got in the garden now, the golden one •816725_890725•
*CLA:	Yeah. •890725_892125•
        Where did we get that? •893925_901625•
*NIN:	We got that at St Ishmal's. •902625_959825•
*CLA:	Did we? •959825_961825•
        Mm. •962625_963225•
*NIN:	And erm  they're sort of labelled, you know what, it gives you this picture of what you're buying as well. •963225_998625•
*CLA:	Oh yes. •100022_100182•
        With most of the plants it does, yeah. •100452_102332•
*NIN:	Yes cos I want to get the particular one I want •102452_104352•
*CLA:	Mm. •104352_104412•
        Mm. •104412_104482•
*NIN:	to go next to the  •105242_105892•
*CLA:	Well obviously, yeah. •105892_106582•
*NIN:	you know, for the effect and erm  •107212_108302•
*CLA:	For the for the contrast, yeah. •108302_109432•

*NIN:	I want to know the height •109642_110352•
*CLA:	Mhm. •110352_110512•
*NIN:	it's going to grow   •110512_112842•
*CLA:	Mm. •114742_115092•
        Mm. •115222_115532•
*NIN:	I think it's er  I think it'll look nice there. •117392_120432•
*CLA:	It should look quite attractive. •121592_122452•
*NIN:	Yeah. •123492_123552•
*CLA:	It might be a bit of a job erm  keeping them separate. •123592_126742•
        growing into one another. •126892_127692•
*NIN:	But I don't think so. •128712_129552•
*CLA:	No? •129552_130162•
*NIN:	Oh no. •130192_130512•

*CLA:	Oh that's alright then. •132342_133602•
        Good. •133602_133692•
*NIN:	Because I mean they don't sort of grow out, they grow up don't they? •134132_136862•
*CLA:	Yeah, but they do grow out a bit too. •138342_139712•
        I mean the one at twenty seven  •139712_140532•

*CLA:	Haven't we got some  towards this end? •267462_268722•

*NIN:	Yes we've got got I've got loads in, in flowerpot, in these big containers. •268812_273872•
        And I  •274132_274562•

*CLA:	Yeah. •311712_311832•
        Mm. •311832_312052•
*NIN:	Wouldn't have much room for sweetpeas though would I? •315442_321012•
        I don't know though, they'd grow up behind wouldn't they? •321052_324992•
*CLA:	Yes. •325562_325642•
        Course they will, yeah. •326762_328162•

*NIN:	Mm. •332992_333082•
*CLA:	Oh yeah. •333542_333902•
*NIN:	But •333902_333962•

*NIN:	Not a lot. •336142_336832•
*CLA:	Not like a privet . •337022_337662•

*CLA:	Er all I can remember  a lot of plants coming. •367972_371502•
*NIN:	Yes well •371502_372032•
*CLA:	But I can't remember  •372032_372992•
*NIN:	I remember that  in a little pot  down there and  you know they were labelled? •373312_378852•

        Oh I see   •385202_385372•
*NIN:	And I think I planted it  •385372_386922•
*CLA:	Yeah. •387042_387152•
*NIN:	and it nothing , it didn't seem to survive. •387152_389412•
*CLA:	Mhm. •391252_391412•
*NIN:	And I was reading about the conditions. •391842_394012•
        Maybe with erm  erm putting fertiliser on them  you know •394272_401332•
*CLA:	Mhm. •401332_401402•
        Mm. •401462_401822•
*NIN:	erm  •403302_403562•
*CLA:	Mhm. •404132_404192•
*NIN:	I think it  and it's come up  •408902_410602•
*CLA:	Ah! •410602_410812•
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	Well, good o. •410842_412222•
*NIN:	It looks quite pretty now but it could be quite . •412222_414182•
*CLA:	Well . •416072_416312•
*NIN:	Yeah, true. •416342_417562•
*CLA:	Mm. •417742_417892•
        I've come across a bit of architrave by the way. •418342_421872•
        Quite apart from  •421872_422022•
*NIN:	Yeah. •423582_423852•
*CLA:	. •_•
        Erm  . •424042_424162•
        So I can use that as an experimental piece. •425132_429822•
*NIN:	Where? •429822_429972•
*CLA:	, there's stuff  come to think of it it's the one in the hall. •430892_433752•
        The doorway that's bricked up. •433752_435532•
        Yeah. •435532_435672•
*NIN:	Oh of course. •435672_435762•
        I keep forgetting there was a doorway there  when we arrived . •436072_438532•
*CLA:	Yeah. •438532_438682•
        That's right. •439322_439682•
        the architrave from there. •439682_440642•
*NIN:	Yeah. •441042_441132•
*CLA:	Erm  it's exactly the same varnish stain as this. •441132_444122•
*NIN:	Is it? •444122_444782•
*CLA:	So I can muck about on that piece before I  tackle it in here, so  mm. •444842_448712•
        stripping goes. •449472_450852•
*NIN:	Oh I see what you mean. •450852_453282•
        To to er see  •453282_453662•
*CLA:	Without staining, without  what? •453662_454842•
*NIN:	Mm that's true. •455172_455522•
        To see if what colour we can get that we like instead of this? •455702_459722•
*CLA:	Yeah. •459802_459892•
        Yeah. •460002_460062•
        That's right. •460212_460412•
*NIN:	Mm. •460742_460842•
*CLA:	First of all  what's the best stripping medium. •460842_463662•
        Whether it's gonna be gentle heat, whether it's gonna be  varnish stripper? •463662_466342•
        Paint stripper? •466342_467082•
        What the hell. •467082_467502•
        And then see the  go on. •467502_469462•
*NIN:	Er do you have to strip it? •469462_470362•
*CLA:	If we want to change the colour. •472912_473892•
        Unless we're going to use a varnish stain as such. •473892_475712•
        But it's very, and it looks a bit crummy, that stuff I always think. •476002_479292•
*NIN:	Ooh  . •479342_479462•
        Ooh well I don't know, •479462_483852•
*CLA:	Mm. •483852_483912•
        See look at  •486512_488032•
*NIN:	It's a big area. •488032_488422•
*CLA:	Pardon? •488422_488602•
*NIN:	It's a big area to strip. •488792_490182•
        Why, wouldn't it •490182_491252•
*CLA:	Well it's only what  erm the architrave  the arch there  this side, that side and that one there. •491252_495882•
*NIN:	Well I mean if you had it sort of darker, wouldn't it stain darker slightly? •495882_498232•
*CLA:	Well as I say you can't stain varnished wood Nina. •498232_500982•
*NIN:	Oh. •500982_501212•
*CLA:	You can put a varnish stain on. •501212_505102•
        Varnish stain  but erm  In  in this particular light now I can see  where they've put on thick blodges that run down. •505102_521432•
*NIN:	I know, it's terrible isn't it? •521432_523352•
*CLA:	Mm. •523682_523822•
*NIN:	I wouldn't think that was a professional job. •523822_527122•
*CLA:	Oh what was? •530212_530812•
        I don't think . •530812_531382•
*NIN:	But  well originally what would they have done with it? •531382_534342•
        When it was built? •534452_535752•
*CLA:	Oh no I don't think, I don't think it's from square one. •535752_538472•
        It probably would be varnished from square one but that's not the original varnish. •538472_542272•
*NIN:	No. •542432_542592•
*CLA:	Shouldn't think, no. •543512_545122•
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	I doubt it very much indeed. •545122_545702•
*NIN:	shocking colour  isn't it? •545812_547302•
*CLA:	Yes it is. •547302_548922•
        And do you know the old bog door, it's the same colour as next door's. •548922_550942•
        Or was I should say. •550952_551952•
*NIN:	Was it? •552192_553372•
*CLA:	The same yucky blue, yeah . •553372_554892•
*NIN:	Was it? •555382_555842•
*CLA:	Mm. •555902_555962•
        So  if you look at the  next time you're in the loo •556982_559512•
*NIN:	Mm. •559512_559582•
*CLA:	where the handle was, look where the blue  shows. •559582_562762•
        And that's that was the original colour. •563252_565542•
*NIN:	That do you think that's what they did originally? •565592_568062•
*CLA:	Yeah. •568602_568852•
        The original colour, yeah. •569212_569802•
