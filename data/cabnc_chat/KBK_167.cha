*DAV:	  (  ) , got straight through it. 
*CHR:	Going straight through anyway, right, fine. I'm not capable of these weeny deflections anyway, so I don't know why the heck I'm bothering. ((hits ball)) 
*DAV:	Always try to be behind the other ball when you come through the hoop, because you're going that way, you see?
