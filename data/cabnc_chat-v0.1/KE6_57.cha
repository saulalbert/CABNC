*WEN:	Went to bed and er of course the kid went berserk didn't he? •_•
        And er god you should of heard him, god if it ain't Ross all over again, mummy, mummy and she left him there, as I said when they first came he was in the far bedroom, well now I suppose with all these people she's rearranged it indoors and he's in the one next to our house, and she's shouting at him and er it went on how, I can't tell you how long, I mean, Bev and I was talking through bedrooms you know •_•
*SAN:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	and er, it was gone eleven I would of thought, anyway he stopped and I slept like a log, got up at twenty past six, but erm, it's a strange thing because one of those came last evening and it parked outside George's, now I said yesterday, when Alan goes to work, it's not long after six normally to go up to London and that •_•
*SAN:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	and I said to both of them, I just don't know how he got past that second car in the road right, come out of his drive, I couldn't believe that he could of done it, but he did, because he went you know  •_•
*SAN:	Yeah  •_•
*WEN:	anyway last night, they parked outside George's so I reckon, I mean it's only us thinking he's put a note in the door because he will do this, because when a bloke used to leave his car outside Alan's gate, others, instead of the station •_•
*SAN:	Yeah •_•
*WEN:	Alan left a note on his windscreen •_•
*SAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	but er, I don't know how he got out yesterday and I've never, never know him parked down the road, not at all, anyway we got, I got home and erm, I said to Bev you know, right go and phone Lesley see if she's in and then I did a bit of housework and then the phone rang, ooh, we was aiming to go out at one and that must of been ten to one, and it was Liz •_•
*SAN:	Oh yeah •_•
*WEN:	and er I said to Bev well you do what you like, you know, she went out, the first time she's answered the phone, since •_•
*SAN:	Yeah •_•
*WEN:	Anyway er Liz said can you come over like today so Bev said yes what does it entail? •_•
        Liz got quite cross you know she's quite oh bugger it, you know, and er she said to Liz what's the hours? •_•
        Oh I dunno you'll have to talk to Ian, she said I've been working Les done, er Les, Les told me eleven till three, it was half past eleven till three and er, so Bev was alright  •_•
*SAN:	That's exactly what we do •_•
*WEN:	Yes, well Bev was asking, I mean I was doing housework, oh, I was doing bits and pieces you know, and er getting me coat and all that and er  she was asking questions and all that and Liz said I'll pick you up at twenty past eleven, so Bev said alright then, so she come off the phone said she'd go and have a look and apparently erm, it must of been yesterday if, if Liz is telling the truth she said to whoever are you going to do anything about this? •_•
        And he said oh yeah, so, I said to Bev well, they had the feeling it was haphazard or whatever the word be, anyway •_•
*SAN:	So she's going over about it  •_•
*WEN:	she's going over at half past eleven and she said to me if it's not worth the money I'm not changing and er, I shall tell him that I've certainly got to go on the books you know  •_•
*SAN:	Mm  •_•
*WEN:	can't do it any other way, so I said oh I'll go and have a look, I've got to go down town and •_•

*DOR:	Mm •_•
*WEN:	you know you have to go backwards and forwards •_•
*DOR:	Yeah •_•
*WEN:	shake yourself round, but I've never know that last night •_•
*DOR:	Yeah sometimes when Rosemary was here, we didn't have any bother or anything but now and again somebody, she did their hair at the time  •_•
*WEN:	Oh yeah  •_•
*DOR:	dress making and er somebody would park outside our house, not by the drive, but there but to get in Les had to swing over and round  •_•
*WEN:	That's it  •_•
*DOR:	and then when they were •_•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	he couldn't swing much so he had to go down and back in but er •_•
*WEN:	That's what you have to do  •_•
*DOR:	it was only occasionally, I mean no bother with it or each other  •_•
*WEN:	I mean this is virtually every day •_•
*DOR:	Yeah •_•
*WEN:	every day now, now I mean I don't know how many she's got living in there or what they've got living in there, they stay  •_•
