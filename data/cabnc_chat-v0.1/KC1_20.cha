*FRA:	Well I think that's a bit prettier. •132069_132245•
*STE:	Oh that's a bit livelier innit? •132643_132759•
        It's more solid innit? •132813_133682•
        I'll get you the hand set   •133682_133872•
*FRA:	Mm   should  back. •134744_137553•
        Perhaps it wasn't  anyway. •137559_137835•
*STE:	Think it goes by itself alright. •138401_139427•
*FRA:	When you get past  it's not too bad. •139654_139823•
        That should er do it. •140659_141076•
        Oh that's still a bit high innit? •141115_141318•
        Got the width there. •141362_141412•
*STE:	Quite good these fast text ones  aren't they? •141412_142182•
*FRA:	Yes excellent. •142643_142817•
*STE:	Well you wouldn't have known  fast text without the right hand set would you? •142879_143631•
*FRA:	No you wouldn't. •143631_143682•
*STE:	said fast text on it. •143688_144035•
        Do you want your picture back so you can see  •145014_145936•
*FRA:	Yeah I'll put it on mix. •146332_146416•
*STE:	Mix er  I'm not sure what mix is on this one. •146416_147242•
*FRA:	That's it. •147242_147264•
        Mm typical dark screen at the top. •147374_147585•
        I don't know, you can't tell can you? •147792_147983•
        No. •147987_147993•
        Let's got back to another station shall we? •148317_148873•

*STE:	? •_•
*FRA:	Yeah, that looks alright. •148995_149348•
        Yeah that's alright. •149348_149541•
*STE:	Yep. •149574_149595•
        It's a  innit ?it's just the edge of the screen innit? •149707_151333•
        Or is it? •151333_151366•
        Oh yes it's the black edge of the   reflecting on it innit? •151366_152953•
*FRA:	Yeah, that's alright. •152966_153071•
*STE:	Yeah. •153156_153171•
        Yeah super. •153191_153288•
*FRA:	Brilliant. •153941_153956•
        It's not brilliant but it's a lot better. •154987_155728•
*STE:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Had to laugh yesterday towards the end of er our round, it was really tipping down, misty, fog, couldn't see a hundred yards  I had this almighty I said well I'll let the six iron, I did this almighty swing  the ball went one way and the club went right up the top of a tree. •155728_157557•
        It must've been fifteen foot at least up in the air  teetering on a top branch. •157562_158117•
*STE:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	I thought oh my god, lost me six iron, all of a sudden crash, it came down. •158117_158503•
*STE:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Old Louis he didn't know which way anything had gone. •158503_158774•
        He said well I couldn't see any of that  didn't even see the club go up the tree. •158774_159083•
*STE:	different hand set works the black stripe. •159083_159971•
*FRA:	Does it? •159982_160144•
        What one of Alistair's? •160144_160512•
*STE:	Yeah, does it work everything though? •160512_160690•
        Doesn't work that does it? •160694_160992•
        No, it works the text  doesn't work the  colour  the on screen display, one of them, innit?and one of them  and that  er and that. •161173_162332•
        That one didn't work either   gonna try and  there's no on screen display on these is there? •162471_164556•
        So   •164558_164569•
*FRA:	Shouldn't think  •164580_164635•
*STE:	won't work will it? •164649_164895•
        This type. •164895_164910•
        So these are the only ones we can't put them with. •165052_165180•
*FRA:	Oh right. •165184_165273•
*STE:	All the later ones we can  but I've got a couple more of these ones that work this one coming anyway so  •165367_165843•
*FRA:	But it changes channel dunnit? •165843_166410•
        And  does it give you volume or not? •166410_166536•
*STE:	Changes channel and does volume I think   •166536_166736•
*FRA:	And  and everything. •166772_166844•
*STE:	Erm  yeah that one does   •166847_167076•
*FRA:	So I mean it'll do everything barring    •167076_167183•
*STE:	No that other one doesn't •167183_167414•
*FRA:	No. •167415_167416•
*STE:	the one we got as a  a master text one doesn't •167445_167676•
*FRA:	No. •167677_167678•
*STE:	but one of these would. •167678_167789•
        That one would. •167796_167861•
*FRA:	Right. •167873_167885•
*STE:	So if we want some of these as well well we ain't gonna get cheaper to go with these whatever happens we know that. •168183_168849•
*FRA:	Yeah. •168849_168858•
*STE:	albeit the wrong one. •168926_169116•
        They have got manual settings on there haven't they? •169116_169397•
*FRA:	That's right, that's what I thought. •169397_169486•
        I mean it's •169486_169531•
*STE:	Yeah. •169532_169533•
*FRA:	you don't, how, how often do you use the brightness control on the •169568_169866•
*STE:	Yeah yeah •169866_169920•
*FRA:	telly? •170070_170079•

        I'll try one of these others. •172902_174351•
*FRA:	well we haven't got the right one for those then. •174821_175422•
*STE:	Still  •175601_175619•
*FRA:	Don't see so many of those now erm  •175620_175902•
*STE:	I should think this is the same as the non-stereo one, for hand set-wise innit? •175902_176307•
*FRA:	Yeah. •176307_176314•
*STE:	Try that last one. •176314_177196•

        We've got the two most important ones. •181837_182119•
