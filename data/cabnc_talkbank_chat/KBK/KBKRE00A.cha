*PS101:	0 .

*PS101:	I mean there 's not much of it to tuck in You know sort of .  131725_133925
*PS05X:	Well that looks very smart as it is .  146025_156725
*PS101:	But you could n't wear it out on this particular blouse .  156725_161325
*PS05X:	Well ca w .  161545_161815
*PS101:	because of the belt If you wore the erm .  163185_164685
*PS05X:	Well try it .  164685_165135
*PS101:	If you I will You think that the colours go and .  165135_168285

*PS101:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Yes it is Yes it is Yes But it clashes very well indeed Why ca n't you wear it out like that .  173585_182245
*PS101:	Because you destroy the blouse the the way that the belt .  182485_185145
*PS05X:	Well that does n't matter if you 've got your if you 've got your jack your jackety effect then have n't you .  185165_189455

*PS05X:	Well you do n't have to .  193655_195095
*PS101:	Well no but you it it it 's quite a heavy belt and if it if it 's holding if it 's giving point to it .  195165_201345
*PS05X:	Yes And that would make it a an even cooler outfit would n't it .  201345_204705
*PS101:	Yes Because I have got this this this creamy shirt Erm which I saw again in Marks this year which you could wear tucked in with a belt .  204705_233895
*PS05X:	Yes Yes But that one is is genuinely versatile Looks just as good tucked in as .  233895_239295
*PS101:	Yes As I say the problem with the tucking in on that one is there 's not quite such a lot of length So when you do this you might come out .  239295_245215
*PS05X:	It 'd start pulling out yes .  245215_246395
*PS101:	Erm and I do n't think it looks good hanging out because it 's you you paying in the skirt and the belt and that And it 's a bit silly to wear er a permanent arrangement But this shirt could be worn with the skirt could n't it .  246685_261455
*PS05X:	Definitely .  261525_261585
*PS101:	I mean the colour 's just as it 's not quite as strong .  263265_265795
*PS05X:	the colour 's pretty neutral is n't it .  265795_267285
*PS101:	But I mean it does pick up .  267285_268705
*PS05X:	Yes Yes I think the skirt 's gon na be very useful actually .  268705_271595

*PS05X:	Do n't you think they go well together .  414195_417595
*PS101:	work Those colours are not too dark are they .  417595_419805
*PS05X:	0 . 
*PS101:	They 're not perfect but they would do Oh what about this Mind you this skirt is only casual And that 's a rather sort of formal blouse No that 's wrong wrong .  422515_436775
*PS05X:	Oddly enough I mean it 's so far away from the yellow I would say it is n't wrong .  436785_443345
*PS101:	Oh it is wrong It 's not it 's not the same as this at all That 's sort of brilliant .  443345_447545

*PS101:	That 's a brilliant yellow yes And this one 's erm a sort of golder And that would n't do But that 's colours go with that .  450005_456075

*PS101:	The gold .  487795_488005
*PS05X:	Are you are you thinking of that because it 's a bit too formal or something .  488005_491875
