*MAR:	Yes the erm   (.) coffee is two lots of one eighty nine so that's three seventy   (.) eight isn't it?
*TER:	Mm. (.) 
*MAR:	Oh that's lovely, [reading] three years ago my sister died leaving a household of two men, my brother-in-law aged eighty and myself approaching retirement age to cope with ourselves, to cope for ourselves. (.) Er because neither of us could really manage in the kitchen it was not long before we became very tired of having to eat convenience food   (.) sad looking old meat pies, dried out chips and heated up frozen vegetables soon palled.I began to despair   (.) in the local press I noticed an advert for an evening class, cookery for men   (.) being the young one in the family I plucked up courage and enrolled but it was great, with great apprehension that I went to the first class.I needn't have worried.There were twenty of us, other chaps in much the same boat as me, Nancy our tutor was cheerful, down to earth and did not expect us to be cordon bleu cooks.That course changed my life.With a mixture of demonstrations, simple methods and constant humour, Nancy taught us to fend for ourselves.I now have the confidence to tackle almost anything in the kitchen, pies, pastas, cakes, soups, meat dishes, vegetables and bread.There have been many disasters along the road, Yorkshire puddings you could sole your shoes with, burnt offerings of several varieties, a pat that even my dog wouldn't eat and last Christmas a chocolate log that disintegrated, the proud little Santa on top sinking without   [reading+laughing] trace in a sea of chocolate gunge.These setbacks however   [reading] were more than compensated for by the successes.We still keep meat pies and vegetables in the freezer but only for emergencies and I'm in the third year of   [reading+laughing] the course now  [] .Oh that's lovely.He got fifty pounds for writing that in as well.
*TER:	Did he really? [laughing] Yeah mm  []
