*DOR:	This is crazy. •196965_197060•
        Timothy come round this side please and you go round that side now. •197079_197325•
        Tim, this side please. •197416_197543•
        You're not to climb on there, you've got to go past it. •197615_197802•
*TIM:	Why? •197802_197864•
*DOR:	Because it's silly  the way we're going on. •197892_198248•
*CHR:	Oh. •198274_198277•
*TIM:	Look. •198277_198317•
*DOR:	Yes. •198343_198366•
        Just leave it and come and sit on your seat. •198366_198524•
*TIM:	Ooh. •198595_198598•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	Come on. •198747_199253•
        Sit in on your seat. •199388_199881•
        You do need your seatbelt on. •199920_200949•
        Put it on please. •200960_201811•
        I know it's not very far, but even so. •201840_202122•
        If we have an accident you'll need it. •202229_202514•
        bump into another car. •202834_202921•
*TIM:	put my stick in the porch. •202939_203033•
*DOR:	You've put your stick in the porch? •203033_203366•
        Right, that's okay. •203366_203432•
*TIM:	I've forgotten it. •203432_203582•
*CHR:	Mum. •203617_203633•
*DOR:	It's still there isn't it? •203645_203758•
*TIM:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Why do you   •203822_203846•
*DOR:	It doesn't matter. •203849_203984•
        Don't worry, just leave it there. •204013_204136•
        Have you got yours in? •204280_204366•
        Is your seatbelt on? •204423_204500•
*CHR:	No. •204607_204613•
*DOR:	You'd best put it on quickly. •204625_204904•
*CHR:	Mum  •205494_205504•
*DOR:	Well in the garage it's a little bit different because  there's only the garage to hit isn't there? •205687_206100•
        So if you hit the garage you're going very very slowly and you might just give yourself a jolt but you wouldn't hurt yourself quite so much. •206151_207036•
*CHR:	Mum what's the noise? •207654_207818•
*DOR:	What's what noise? •208120_208172•
*CHR:	That noise. •208172_208194•
*DOR:	The car. •208210_208272•

        Don't go undoing things. •212095_212194•
*TIM:	I want to go in Christopher's seat. •212223_212639•

*TIM:	No. •232773_235548•
*DOR:	Well if you go and look for it I expect you'll find it. •235548_235702•
        Do you think it'll be sand or water today? •235702_235858•
*TIM:	What? •235858_235887•
*DOR:	Do you think it will be sand or water today? •235895_236120•
*TIM:	What? •236149_236174•
*DOR:	Do you think there'll be sand  or water  today? •236174_236539•
*TIM:	Think it will be sand. •236565_236786•
*DOR:	You think it'll be sand. •236786_236911•
        Why do you think it's sand today? •236911_237067•
        It was water last week wasn't it? •237385_237539•
        So it probably will be sand this week I would think. •237539_237745•
*TIM:	Yeah I think it will be sand. •238146_238630•
        Cos the water  soaking wet. •238641_238883•
*DOR:	No, you won't get soaking wet with sand. •238883_239079•
        Hopefully. •239079_239105•
*TIM:	Cos with sand you don't get soaking  •239279_239797•
*DOR:	No. •239948_239968•
*TIM:	We put water in our sand. •239968_240067•
*DOR:	Do you? •240171_240197•
        What, so that it sticks together then it makes things? •240243_240451•
*TIM:	Yeah. •240529_240535•
*DOR:	Mm. •240535_240546•
        If it's dry it sort of won't stick together will it? •240546_240920•
        It won't make things. •240920_241035•
        Mind you it's nice for pouring. •241161_241293•
*TIM:	 (        ) 
*DOR:	You don't have to have sand but it's rather nice. •241581_242069•
*TIM:	We  some petrol. •242088_246130•
*DOR:	No we're alright. •246339_246408•
        We don't need petrol right this minute. •246408_246569•
        Cos at lunchtime we're going to go to Tesco's. •246569_246740•
        And that will be a good place to get petrol cos it's cheap and we shall need a bit then. •246740_247210•
        We're not desperate for petrol but it would be nice if we filled up with it. •247245_247530•
*TIM:	Cheap at Tesco's. •247776_247933•
*DOR:	Yeah. •247960_247989•
*TIM:	one person . •254585_254941•
        Going to be one. •255219_255290•
*DOR:	Going to be one person. •255290_255469•
*TIM:	Yeah. •255469_255497•
*DOR:	Which means  •255821_256031•
*TIM:	One person driving. •256091_256191•
*DOR:	Ooh. •256519_256522•
*TIM:	 (        )  (.) 
*DOR:	There's an ambulance. •256673_256753•
*TIM:	An ambulance is  hospital. •257447_257825•
*DOR:	Yeah. •257883_257903•
        Or it might be taking somebody to hospital. •257903_258130•
        Didn't seem in much of a hurry though did it? •258130_258467•
        So I don't think there was an emergency. •258479_258617•
