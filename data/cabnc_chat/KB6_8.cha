        I said my god Lynn, I, it was only a mistake. •240213_240501•
        Forgot, you know but you'd get it back. •240509_240708•
        Oh and she didn't take no bloody notice of me might have been   •240743_240945•
*SUE:	Well she knows she's, she's a bit funny then. •240945_241178•
        Otherwise she wouldn't feel so conscious about it. •241179_241674•
*ANG:	You gotta be careful with her. •241674_241981•
*SUE:	Mm. •241981_241998•
*ANG:	You know, what you say to her. •241998_242103•
        And if you tell her about somebody she'll tell them. •242103_242406•
*SUE:	Yeah. •242440_242460•
*ANG:	You know  chat I said  don't like me hair. •242482_242703•

*SUE:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANG:	Yeah you've gotta be careful. •242909_243056•
        Cos  Ange said she'd, she'd been chatting about Jenny to her. •243056_243317•
        She went and told Jenny. •243319_243399•
        And Jenny asked Ange about it. •243399_243817•
        See? •243818_243819•
*SUE:	Maybe it's the best thing she could have done then, get a job? •243819_244298•
*ANG:	Yeah. •244298_244327•
        And now she's paranoid. •244328_244422•
        She thinks everyone's talking about her. •244423_245423•
        I said I've got better things to do than talk about you Lynn. •245424_245754•
*SUE:	Yeah. •245754_245802•
*ANG:	And that day we was all over Jenny's. •245802_246113•
        Ange said let's pop in Jenny's. •246114_246227•
        So we go down Jenny's and er  the door knocked and I said  Christ it's Lynn . •246232_246527•
        And Lynn came in. •246608_246708•
        You should have seen her face  cos we were sat in Jenny's. •246722_247498•
*SUE:	Ooh. •247637_247646•
*ANG:	 (        ) 
*SUE:	Ooh. •248002_248011•
        Oh well. •248044_248064•
        She does stare quite a bit I must admit. •248064_248334•
*ANG:	Yeah. •248335_248336•
*SUE:	Don't she? •248336_248579•
*ANG:	Yeah she does. •248579_248626•
*SUE:	as if every, she thinks everybody is talking about her . •248666_249506•
*ANG:	Yes. •249507_249508•
*SUE:	There's no need for it. •249508_249612•
*ANG:	Yeah I know. •249612_249648•
*SUE:	And what's this  Angie's taking her kid  little boy out of school. •249649_249917•
*ANG:	Yeah. •249918_249919•
        She's thinking of taking him out isn't she. •249919_250108•
        Cos erm  I mean she went to a report evening and Miss  said, was saying about Jay and saying  you know if he falls behind you  know what'll happen and Ange says what? •250108_250940•
        Well you'll have to go in the office. •250941_251199•
        Course that was playing on Angie's mind see and Miss  said she'd give Jason extra work. •251199_251569•
*SUE:	Yeah. •251569_251575•
*ANG:	Cos it had been playing on her mind for weeks. •251575_251825•
*SUE:	Mm. •251825_251834•
*ANG:	So she's been trying to get work off her. •251835_252001•
        Well in the end she took a stack and went in to see  Miss  and Miss  tried to change the subject, •252001_252859•
*SUE:	Subject. •252869_252892•
*ANG:	Yeah. •253030_253057•
        So erm  anyway she told her that she wanted Jay out. •253057_253271•
        And she wanted her to  Mr . •253271_253423•
        Well she hasn't gone to Mr . •253424_253553•
        So Ange rang this bloke, woman who  sorted out Chrissie at at the school. •253560_254076•
*SUE:	Yeah. •254076_254097•
*ANG:	And she goes up Parker school so  she was going, she said to Ange she was talking to Miss  tomorrow. •254097_254691•

*SUE:	Yeah. •254735_254756•
*ANG:	But Ange hasn't heard nothing. •254757_254866•
        So I think she's gonna ring them back up again. •254866_255278•
        I think Miss  shouldn't have said what she said because  Jay hasn't got a problem. •255340_255865•
        But she just said it  like if he drops down like Chrissie you know what would happen see? •255865_258252•
*SUE:	Yeah. •258434_258579•
*ANG:	Course it worried Ange look cos she don't want to go back in the office like last time. •258679_260033•
