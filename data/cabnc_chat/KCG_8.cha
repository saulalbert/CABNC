*JAN:	this all started after last weekend  Deana put him to bed didn't she? •271022_275902•

*LYN:	Oh  •280042_280072•
*JAN:	so he was dead annoyed with it, all week I've been struggling to get him to bed  •280072_285992•
*LYN:	 ((clears throat)) 
*JAN:	he, he was a treat before, just used to take him up, give him a cuddle, say night-night and that was it •286192_290552•
*LYN:	So why did it disturb him with Deana? •290552_292932•

*JAN:	Yeah •642692_643142•
*LYN:	and I just, I threw buckets of water on it to rinse it, and it dried because it was really warm and it came up like new  •643142_648772•
*JAN:	Came up like new  •648772_649502•
*LYN:	cos you can have a real good go at the wheels that way outside  •649502_652052•
*JAN:	Yeah, outside, it's like my pram, I mean, I was, Stacey was going in hospital last year to have her adenoids out and Sue was having him and I thought well, he was too big for his carrycot, but take the pram down and he's got nothing to sleep in  and er, I put him in it, it been six months since it was well since he started using it, so I give that a good going over and the pram wheels come up lovely •652052_676112•
*LYN:	I know •676352_677052•
*JAN:	you know I get a Brillo •677182_677962•
*LYN:	Yeah  •677962_678132•

*LYN:	And do that  •686152_686542•
*JAN:	and me pram as well  •686542_687052•
*LYN:	I know, I fancied a big pram, but there you go  •687552_690702•
*JAN:	Well it's, whether you've really got somewhere to put it really that's the top and bottom of it  •690942_696782•
*LYN:	Well there's nowhere to walk to now, is there, you know   •696782_699242•
*JAN:	Well where would you, mind you I suppose like in the olden days you could only get big prams, they just had them in the living room didn't they? •699242_706432•
*LYN:	Yeah, well it'd just have to go in the hall, but, no, this will be better, carrycot and  that,ridiculous prices though •706432_720252•
*JAN:	Well it is, it's different if you was, if you was starting from scratch I suppose  you know, first baby you're inclined to, you want everything new don't you with these new  •721142_736502•

*JAN:	Oh all of my stuff has been up in the loft  it's like you say, I mean if they've been double wrapped and everything and you wash them •766392_773752•
*LYN:	he should put his hand in his pocket really and buy something •773752_778042•
*JAN:	Of course he should, you ought to just ask him for say a hundred, you know to buy a couple of packs of nappies and some cream and changing mat, a changing bag, you'll want all that won't you? •778582_790152•
