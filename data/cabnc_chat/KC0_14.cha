@Comment:	conversation #14 (Tape 033505)
*ENI:	What we were talking about, or what I think is interesting is  your experience from your early days in horse shoeing  has stood you in good stead for the revival of interest in driving  erm  if you'd like to tell us a bit more about that I'd love to hear it cos I'm never tired of that. •7985_25775•
*ANN:	Yeah well er  the shoeing today is  completely different to what it was when I started  nearly sixty year ago. •26045_33445•
        In them days  horses were  they were all working , driving horses  you hardly ever see a riding horse. •34415_41865•
        Er  the ones they did ride were the ones they used to drive at erm ah, down the two jars but er  and that was a completely different  way of life then  to what that is now. •42225_57015•
        Er  •57015_57245•
*ENI:	Mm. •57245_57385•
*ANN:	er the horses that are shod today, you see they all  riding horses, no  very few working horses. •57905_66715•
*ENI:	Yes. •66715_66805•
*ANN:	Er  but now the  •67065_68455•
*ENI:	It's, and that's your hobby isn't it? •68455_69735•
*ANN:	Yeah. •69735_69965•
*ENI:	Yes. •70205_70655•
*ANN:	Er  where before that was  the horse  was equivalent for a motor today. •70655_76035•
*ENI:	Yes. •76255_76895•
*ANN:	So that was a living. •76895_77835•

*ENI:	Yes. •87465_87995•
        Mhm. •87995_88305•
        And is it  •88365_88925•
*ANN:	But now  •88925_89235•
*ENI:	different type of horse that makes it different for shodding  •89235_92165•
*ANN:	Oh yes! •92165_92395•
*ENI:	today? •92395_92745•
*ANN:	Oh yeah! •92745_93155•
*ENI:	Not the question of the same horses doing a different job. •93315_95865•
*ANN:	No, that's a different type of horse er •95865_97545•
*ENI:	Yes. •97835_98255•
*ANN:	er, the old fashioned working horses  er  practically extinct. •98255_104925•
*ENI:	Yes. •105325_105805•
*ANN:	And the shires are still there fairly strong, still  er  some of course has now gone onto the  rare breeds. •105985_114795•
*ENI:	Mm! •114885_115045•
*ANN:	Er  registered you see. •115695_117995•
        Er  Welsh colts  and  things of that nature are coming back a bit now, they are  building up now  er  but  •118525_127015•
*JOH:	But would I be right in saying that  the everyday working horse, the sort of, general purpose working horse that people used years ago, people such as carriers, they would use horses which were crossbreeds wouldn't they? •127545_141825•
        Not  •141825_142155•
*ANN:	Yeah. •142155_142265•
*JOH:	not a purebred anything. •142265_143725•
*ANN:	Not a pure , no! •143725_144115•
*JOH:	They'd be good old heavy, honest, rough  •144115_146535•
*ANN:	Yeah. •146535_146625•
        Yeah, yeah. •146625_147285•
*JOH:	hard working horses. •147285_148585•
*ANN:	That's right. •148585_148815•
*JOH:	Not things of beauty really at all. •148815_150385•
*ANN:	No. •150655_150885•
        No, ooh no, no! •150885_151395•

*ENI:	They were  •155505_155625•
*JOH:	see gypsies with that sort. •155625_156715•
*ENI:	built for strength •156715_157635•

*ENI:	for the  •157805_158095•
*ANN:	Yeah. •158095_158195•
*ENI:	jobs. •158195_158425•
*JOH:	Yes. •158425_158695•
*ANN:	Work. •158695_159065•
*JOH:	Yes. •159195_159435•
*ENI:	Were they? •159435_159565•
*ANN:	Yeah. •159645_159965•
*JOH:	Purely for  •159965_160295•
*ANN:	Yeah. •160295_160565•
*JOH:	work and hardiness. •160565_161545•
*ANN:	And they're ornaments today, they aren't working horses. •161545_164135•
*ENI:	That's right. •164135_164545•
*ANN:	You put these horses into hard work today they'd be dead within three months! •164545_168395•
*ENI:	Would they? •168395_168875•
*ANN:	Ooh yes! •169015_169515•
        Yeah! •170145_170375•
*JOH:	Yes, the whole scene has altered. •170925_172465•
        And er, as I say, observing this and watching Hector's work and how things have gone on over the years, er as you know, there's been a tremendous revival of interest in driving, so many people  have er, restored carts or had new ones built  and erm  the young farriers who've never had the experience with driving horses, they have run into problems with erm, keeping them going soundly and overcoming problems which crop up when horses are driven on the road a lot. •172835_203285•
*ANN:	Yeah. •203285_203375•
*ENI:	Mm. •203375_203535•
*JOH:	Would you like to tell us a bit more about that? •203855_205225•
*ANN:	Well, yeah that is, I'm  I mean that's a completely different  er er laxing of the, it's completely different. •205225_211655•
        Er  when you're riding a horse, you see the weight is all on the back  er  whichever tendency  do and what we call the gait  er  •212645_223205•
*ENI:	Yes. •224025_224595•
*ANN:	is the hind legs in the front •224675_226115•
*ENI:	Yes. •226375_226785•
*ANN:	they have a tendency to open them  make them wider apart  •226785_229775•
*ENI:	Oh yes! •229775_229895•
*ANN:	by the backs. •229895_230625•
*ENI:	G A I T. •230625_231415•
*JOH:	That's right, that kind of gait. •231415_232455•
*ANN:	By the back and swop them you see. •232455_233725•
        Well  er, with a driving horse that's completely opposite because your vehicle behind the horse  is pushing  against it •234125_243475•
*ENI:	Yes. •243755_243955•
*ANN:	and have a tendency to  punt the back •244045_246785•
*ENI:	Really? •247325_247575•
*ANN:	so that pushes the  legs closer together, do you see? •247575_250905•
*ENI:	Good heavens! •251045_251605•
*JOH:	They're more likely to   •251605_252065•
*ANN:	And then they're more likely to hit, they're more likely to hit  •252095_254545•
*JOH:	Mm. •254545_254605•
*ANN:	the  front legs with the back legs •254685_256995•
*ENI:	Really! •256995_257125•
*ANN:	when they're going, especially going down hill. •257615_259245•
*JOH:	And of course, there's a word in the trade for that isn't there? •259245_261735•
*ANN:	Yeah. •262005_262085•
        Forging. •262085_262295•
*ENI:	What is it? •262295_262605•
*JOH:	It's what, now there's a  •263015_263935•
*ENI:	Forging? •263935_264305•
*JOH:	completely  •264305_264765•
*ANN:	Yeah. •264765_264875•
*JOH:	different use for the word forging. •264875_267075•
*ENI:	Now, is it related to forging ahead  in any way? •267195_270675•
        Oh , is that where forging ahead comes  •270675_272255•
*JOH:	I  •272585_272615•
*ENI:	from? •272615_272855•
        When you're really pushing? •273095_274055•
*ANN:	Yeah, yeah, pushing. •274055_274345•
*JOH:	It might well be. •274345_275555•
        It might  •275855_276385•
*ENI:	Yes. •276385_276475•
*JOH:	well be. •276475_277125•
        I would say the term  •277445_278295•
*ANN:	And, and then they can  •278295_278795•
*JOH:	forging ahead has come from  the use of that word in relation to horses. •278795_284005•
*ENI:	Yes. •284005_284135•
*ANN:	Yes. •284135_284395•
*JOH:	I would say, because that  •284395_285305•
*ANN:	Yeah, probably. •285305_285725•
*JOH:	dates back many, many years doesn't  •285725_287335•
*ANN:	Yeah. •287335_287395•
*JOH:	it? •287395_287495•
*ANN:	Yeah. •287685_287965•
*JOH:	Yes. •288005_288485•
        Because they  •288825_289305•
*ANN:	That's it. •289305_289535•
*JOH:	do do it when they're pushing ahead  •289535_290665•
*ANN:	Yeah. •290665_290815•
*JOH:	they, they hit the front foot with the hind one. •290815_293135•
*ENI:	Good Lord! •293135_293435•
*JOH:	Occasionally you  •293435_294075•
*ANN:	Yeah. •294075_294135•
*JOH:	hear them do it •294135_294895•
*ENI:	Oh! •295325_295605•
*JOH:	when they're driving, it's quite a sharp  •295605_297265•
*ANN:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. •297305_297785•
*JOH:	crack you  •297785_297995•
*ANN:	Yeah. •297995_298095•
*JOH:	hear. •298095_298185•
*ENI:	It's amazing! •298185_298505•
*ANN:	Mm. •298505_298625•
*JOH:	Er  so that's, that's completely different do you see? •298625_301725•
        So the styling of shoeing  is different. •301725_304925•
*ENI:	Mm. •305025_305335•
*ANN:	Completely different. •305435_306275•
*JOH:	If they do it too much then the farrier's not doing a good job  •306275_309585•
*ANN:	Job. •309585_309885•
*JOH:	and his job •310055_310885•
*ENI:	Really? •310885_311035•
*JOH:	is to re-balance the shoe so that er, it just misses  •311035_315375•
*ANN:	Miss. •315475_315755•
*JOH:	the front foot as it comes forward. •315755_317575•
        If the  •317575_318445•
*ENI:	Right. •318445_318595•
*JOH:	if the horse is travelling fast on the road he's at the trot, I mean it isn't  •318595_323085•
*ENI:	Yes. •323095_323105•
*JOH:	the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road, they never ever should. •323105_326885•
*ENI:	No. •326885_327245•
*JOH:	Erm, but at the trot, when the the legs are moving the diagonals are moving so of course the front and the hind foot come very close together  •327345_335625•
*ENI:	Ah that's it! •335795_336585•
*JOH:	at one point in the gait  •336585_337555•
*ANN:	Yeah. •337555_337745•
*JOH:	and if the  •337745_338545•
*ENI:	Yes. •338565_338645•
*JOH:	shoe is slightly wrongly balanced, or the foot is slightly wrongly trimmed, then you get these troubles, you  •338645_345365•
*ANN:	Yeah. •345365_345435•
*JOH:	also get what we call, brushing don't you? •345435_347245•
*ANN:	Brushing. •347245_347305•
        When they  •347305_347665•
*JOH:	Tell Edith about that. •347665_348835•
*ANN:	when they hit both legs together  like the hind legs when they  they'll hit each other they'll hit one hind leg  •348835_355785•
*JOH:	They really, they  •355785_356185•
*ANN:	with other one you see. •356185_356825•
*JOH:	They really  •356825_357035•
*ENI:	Ooh! •357085_357385•
*JOH:	wear •357385_357475•
*ANN:	They give it a . •357475_358545•
*JOH:	a a a sore place  •358545_359125•

        Yes. •362275_362375•
*ANN:	Yeah. •362375_362955•
*JOH:	They do it on what we call the coronet •362955_364545•
*ANN:	Yeah. •364545_365045•
*JOH:	which is of course the little  junction between the skin and the hair. •365045_368955•
*ANN:	Yeah. •368955_369195•
*ENI:	Ooh! •369195_369515•
*JOH:	Very tender place. •369515_370925•
        It's like the quick of our nail •370925_372365•
*ENI:	Ooh yes! •372365_372885•
*JOH:	where the •372885_373575•
*ENI:	I can imagine! •373605_373925•
*JOH:	tissue grows from. •373925_374975•
        And they do  •374975_375595•
*ANN:	And on the front  •375595_376095•
*JOH:	damage their coronet. •376095_377045•
*ANN:	On the front one they do it on the knee which is the  er  do you see, which is higher up. •377045_383155•
*ENI:	Yes. •383155_383435•
*ANN:	Yeah. •383665_384225•
*ENI:	But the knee comes sort of out  •384225_385895•
*ANN:	Out. •385895_386055•
*ENI:	doesn't it? •386055_386385•

*JOH:	Yes. •395775_396065•
*ENI:	You'd never dream! •396115_397125•

*JOH:	Yes. •406185_406245•
*ANN:	They should know it. •406245_407195•

*ENI:	Yes you do. •130600_130630•
*JOH:	Yes. •130630_130650•
*ENI:	But it's quite different from the unpleasantly lazy speech that you get now, for instance, Lancashire  it's  •130650_131247•
*JOH:	Yes. •131301_131304•
*ENI:	not true Lancashire that's spoken up there, it's a lazy  you  •131304_131605•

*JOH:	True cockney is a treat to listen to. •132853_133060•
*ENI:	That's right. •133060_133138•
*JOH:	But there's a lot of adulterated cockney in the home counties, I used to hear it a lot in Hertfordshire. •133138_133620•
*ENI:	Yes. •133620_133651•
*JOH:	Erm, especially in the war because the evacuees of course, would come along and of course  •133651_134112•
*ANN:	Yes. •134177_134187•
*JOH:	all the local children picked it up, of course they did! •134187_134389•
        And we'd all go home talking like them and our mothers complained ! •134389_134799•
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Er, but it was interesting all the same. •134807_135015•

*ENI:	Indeed! •135224_135234•
*JOH:	Yes. •135234_135259•

*ENI:	That's true, isn't it? •138282_138410•
*ANN:	Cos they aren't talking the queen's English! •138410_138484•
*JOH:	It's taking a  •138484_138568•
*ENI:	Yes. •138569_138570•
*JOH:	long time for dialects to be accepted but I think  I think that boundary is giving way •138570_139034•
*ENI:	Well I hope  •139034_139135•
*JOH:	frankly. •139151_139168•
*ENI:	it will universally because  •139168_139244•

*ENI:	Yes. •150455_150474•
*JOH:	And, it didn't take long with one of them, that was Dennis  •150474_150783•

*JOH:	but he spoke quickly  with a very strong accent and that  •152889_153170•
*ENI:	Yes. •153170_153220•
*JOH:	took me a lot of years before I could  and I was so pleased when once I was able to say to you  I've  Ben  had been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we? •153220_154174•

*JOH:	Yes. •160888_160906•
*ENI:	It really does! •160906_161039•
*JOH:	And I , I think about a great deal because  it's a very strange, it's a very strange thing to talk about but  when I came to Suffolk, I might have told you this before  er, I had hardly been away from home at all, I was only seventeen when I first met him •161039_162747•
*ENI:	Mm. •162813_162831•
*JOH:	and I had a very sheltered life, I was an only child, I hadn't been around much, I hadn't stayed away from home  erm  and  I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was working at Brandeston Hall  and erm  she at that time was expecting to get engaged to  a chappy in the village here who was, and still is a friend of Hector's and ours, and  they didn't marry in the finish  but she at that time wanted me to come up to Suffolk to see her  and to meet this chappy who she thought she was going to marry  and erm  so, it was  holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well  why not? •162831_166890•
        I'll erm, I'll venture and, and my parents said yes, that would be alright and so er  so I came along and erm  of course, it happened that he was in the  he was in the forge talking to Hector on the first evening I came  and that was how we met. •166890_168421•
*ENI:	Mm. •168421_168440•
*JOH:	And erm,it was an extraordinary thing! •168440_168643•
        But  added to that, I can well remember  staying at Kettleborough Chequers erm  and  er  walking along  from Kettleborough to Brandeston erm  the very next morning after I'd come here  and I think it was before  I think it was quite likely before we had  we had actually met, I don't know whether it was the first day or the second •168646_170963•
*ANN:	Yeah, •170971_171004•
*JOH:	that we met in in the shop there  •171004_171170•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	but  the strong impression I had is walking over the hill from Kettleborough where the gun club now is  walking down into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the village nestling in the hollow  and I can remember feeling a  extraordinarily strong sensation that  I could easily live there •171170_173224•
*ENI:	Yes. •173299_173315•
*JOH:	I could belong there •173315_173515•

*JOH:	and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt it since! •173578_174034•

*JOH:	Yes. •174580_174604•
*ENI:	feeling! •174607_174636•

*JOH:	Most extraordinary! •174698_174741•
*ENI:	I belong here. •174741_174859•
*JOH:	Yes. •174859_174890•
