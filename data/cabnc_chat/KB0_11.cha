@Comment:	conversation #11 (Tape 029004)
*ENA:	Within the next, er month or so  a national consultation is being held within the URC  to consider the advice of  producing  a programme of training for eldership which will be used throughout the call of the church  and if there are any suggestions or any proposal that anyone would like to make  I shall be very glad to receive them within the next month. •3135_27275•
        Thank you. •29785_30045•
*UNK:	Any other questions or comments? •30045_31655•
        And you . •32225_36535•
*UNK:	Yes, but I'll try to be brief. •38145_39605•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	As I understand things, and I work from what I know  to what I don't know  anyone ordained an elder following these guidelines is recognised as an elder within the United Reform Church and within the Presbyterian Church of Wales. •39885_61405•
        As a result of that, and I think  to make sure this is something we would have to ask the  advisory committee  but I would read it  that that includes mutual recognition of eldership. •62905_77815•
        And so in my   •80205_81175•
*UNK:	That it would yes. •81255_82845•
        But I'd want to consult the giant advisory committee  before putting that into print. •83335_87505•
*UNK:	, that's an important question that comes as a  we can attempt  or  the group can attempt to answer that question  the in reports of the next   so we don't lose it off the agenda. •88835_98205•
*UNK:	Yes. •98835_98925•
*UNK:	Would that be fair? •98925_99315•
*UNK:	Yes. •99315_99405•
*UNK:	I'll just put that aside. •99405_102015•
        All in those in favour of the resolution that we  commend to these  to the church   •102775_106995•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	we agree the procedure for the election of ordination and induction of elders  in  and in churches. •107345_112785•
        Please show? •114175_114615•
        Any against? •115915_116315•
*UNK:	Actually I've rather hurried through  that objective part of our  I only had my  time  to bring before you  one other very important issue  and two other pieces of information. •119645_132165•
        There are a few copies remaining of  newsletter. •133105_136165•
        There's also information about the International Ecumenical Fellowship  which is something that you as an individual can do  to support ecumenical work. •138555_148775•
        If you want to know more about it, pick up a leaflet. •149405_152165•
        If, we have run out of leaflets  pick up John ! •153125_156155•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Because he is a member  and he can tell you about it. •157776_161156•
        The most  important thing  in this report  is from the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland  and it's a resolution  that they passed  on Northern Ireland. •163196_179196•
        You should have this  received this in the pew  when you came in  this morning. •180376_186836•
        The reason it is important today  is because tomorrow  has been  requested to be appointed to be  a special day in prayer  for peace  justice  in Northern Ireland. •187226_207956•
        Like this resolution  I would urge  all of you  when you go back  to your congregation  those ministers who  are following the moderator's request, those ministers from the South who will not be  conducting morning worship tomorrow because of the long journey  request whoever is conducting worship to use this  in the service  in the prayers! •216806_250706•
        Those of you who are here without ministers  badger your minister! •252616_257406•
        When you get back tonight  or tomorrow  to include this  in your time and prayer  in one of your services tomorrow. •259176_270176•
        And don't  let it stop there! •273576_277946•
        A day of prayer is important  as it changes our pattern of prayer  and as it changes  our concerns week by week and year by year. •280706_294246•
        Some of the  attempts at peacemaking  the churches in Ireland are making  may seem worrying  may seem politically subversive  but how will we respond  to the longing for peace  to the desire  for reconciliation  for the hope  the stakes   that will result  in a permanent and just solution? •297926_345526•
        I commend to you all  this   •347066_349836•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	of prayer. •351166_351676•
        And will move  that  this document be taken back  to your local churches and used. •363896_378786•
        We . •378786_378956•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	We move to  page five, the top half of page five and   and Graham will introduce the  world famous issue. •387276_404286•
*ENA:	Having , credit by David  's withering look  I always say you have to be terrified! •404286_408165•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	It's a bit  •408985_409075•
*UNK:	I'm a spy! •415355_415895•
*ENA:	Oh, after all that it didn't work! •416545_417575•
        It's at this point in our agenda when er  the world search  it's  our agenda  and er  in introducing the report there are just four things I want to comment about. •417875_434255•
        Er, I refer, first of all to  the continuing links we have with the church in Hungary  and to remind that there is a, a party of young who are currently negotiating the  er, visit to Hungary at this present time. •434255_449315•
        And er, we would hope that that programme of reciprocal visits will continue over the ensuing years. •449925_455625•
        We also find there are, and I hope that you will read it carefully, because I think you will find it  a fairly daunting report  which comes from Hugh   who has managed, you know, has been working, erm, in  er, Romania  with the Bishop  erm, who more or less, kind of, started off the, or whose work started off the  the revolution that took place in Romania. •457595_479615•
        Within that report he tells us  erm, the rather startling disturbance story, that in fact  it almost suggests, has been suggested the revolution hasn't happened because the situation  has continued as before with a different name  but basically with the same  er  with the same kind of programme intact. •480685_500335•
        And in the creation of unity, unity  there's deep concern about the status of American churches in Romania  and obviously the Hungarian church  in Romania is affected by that whole process so I would urge you to read that letter  to remember the work of Hugh erm  and to  be aware of, of what  the situation is  in that part of the world. •501525_526575•
        It seems important that I should have links, in developing links  you ought to see that as part of our agenda. •526575_532065•
        Hugh, himself  I think he is completing his work  and there, in, in a few months time  and I know there have attempts made to find someone to replace him. •533095_542615•
        As yet er, that has not been possible, but if you knew of anybody, young person who you thought might be suitable  and might  , might like the challenge of an interesting venture of this nature  I'm sure if you let us know, or let the moderator know  we'll be very happy to, er, suggest that name or see if there's any, any possibility  erm, in continuing that . •543795_564715•
        We also feel it's important that we should  be doing just a bit more than just having exchanges, that there is a whole process of  that needs to go on. •566015_572985•
        There's an assumption  by some politicians that just because there is this  immense change taking place in Eastern Europe, that this is victory for Western capitalism  erm, I think there might be some of who might be a bit cautious about that victory and might believe that er  there is still much that needs to be shared and understood  and it isn't as simple as perhaps some political figures might suggest it could be. •573935_598665•
        So I want to, first of all, in presenting this report to remind you of the importance of that link  and for us to encourage its development. •599435_606765•
        Secondly, the World Church erm  is your agenda in the sense that  you might be interested to know there is a  erm  a video now available, er  which introduces the work of CWM for the churches. •608545_621485•
        And that video can be obtained from Tavistock Church, in Tavistock Place  it costs twelve pound fifty, with one pound fifty postage  erm, but I think that it has been recommended to us and a number of the provinces have asked for copies to be made available  and then maybe there are some churches within our provence that might like to have that video so that they can draw the attention of their churches to the work  of the Council for World Mission. •622535_648745•
        Thirdly, we will in a moment be hearing a report  erm, about the  World Council of Churches  assembly which took place in Canberra  so there is another aspect to the World Church hitting our agenda today. •650605_664725•
        But fourth, and I think it was reflected very much in the discussions this morning  just to simply remind you that you are the World Church! •666285_673465•
        You know, we sometimes think of the World Church as being something that's out there beyond us, but we are the World Church aren't we? •673465_679285•
        We're  we are part of the that process and it's  it's sometimes encouraging for us to remember that there are  small denominations, small groups like us around the world  who are struggling to make their Christian witness real  in their particular context. •679285_693245•
        And it's important that the kind of story that we're being told this morning, or to continue to be told, we are to continually hear and observing  •694165_701735•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	stories  because they are encouraging  it does make us feel that even though we are a small denomination that does not stop us from preventing new ideas which we can share and in which we can learn from each other. •701735_713545•
        So, I would hope that out of this experience of this morning you will continue to er let some of those stories come forward  and, and let us hear them and let us share in them. •714955_725905•
        And, with those comments moderator, I'd like to present the er report of the World Church, Church and Mission. •725975_730935•
*UNK:	Are there any questions, either on the report or in what ? •732775_735315•
*UNK:	Then it gives me great pleasure now to erm  I always knew that John , has had something different from the rest of us you know  he has that kind of air doesn't he, that  that status in the pulpit which  you know,? •740295_752565•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	And of course, I've now discovered what it is, he's a distant relative of the  Archbishop of Wales. •754595_759285•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	There was always er  there was always something there! •760065_764785•
        There was just something about his daring . •764805_766565•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	that's alright then. •767935_768995•
        I'm not gonna do that John. •768995_771355•
        Erm, I'm  I'm never sure about Bishops and Archbishops, erm  I remember Archbishop Runcie once commenting about  er, an activity that took place at the installation of a Bishop and it's, I gather, I mean I've, I haven't actually been to one, but if you're Bishop or an Archbishop  when they act to  the triumph and act of installation took place there were  you'll find that the person was surrounded by Bishops and they were all sort of looking in on this er, this body that was gonna be installed and somebody once asked what are they doing? •771465_800585•
        , Archbishop , Runcie said well it's just simply an operation to remove their backbone! •801655_804875•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Erm  I don't know! •807355_808895•
        I would like to er  say that we are very  grateful today to be  able to welcome amongst us his grace  erm, the most reverent Alwyn  who has just recently been elected as the Archbishop of Wales. •809295_828809•
        We're delighted that you have found time out of your busy schedule and timetable  to come and spend time with us today and we're very glad  that you are able to do so and I would ask  er, John, our moderator if he will receive me now  and invite you to address our . •829499_846059•
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*IDA:	Well, first of all may I  respond positively to  those kind words of welcome that you extended to me. •872219_879929•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	At least, I feel at home. •882899_887289•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	I won't say any more! •888029_889189•
        Some of you may have listened very attentively to the, to a programme that put , was put out a week ago I think, with Betty   er, in Welsh  and er  some of you therefore, will know something my background. •889459_905495•
        Er  last year  and time has flown hasn't it? •908325_911745•
        Last February, twelve months last February I'm, I was privileged  to  travel to Canberra  in Australia  fortunately not on my own, because there are , witnesses. •912275_926335•
        Er •926865_926895•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	There were seven of us from Wales  er  and two of them are present here this afternoon. •927915_937475•
        Noel was present and   presenting the Welsh independence in   and also  Gethyn was present  erm  I'd like to see, er, know that Gethyn was representing the Church in Wales  apart from the fact that he's also a baptist. •938725_961525•
        Er, as you know, Gethyn does work  for the Church in Wales now  and this, in a special way, is a  testifies  to  the fact that he is  er  an ecumenical person. •962995_980335•
        Working ecumenically  in Wales. •981725_984555•
        He is also  a secretary of Envis that is the commission of covenant to churches  of which we are all members of churches. •984945_996575•
        Yes, I er  I went in February nineteen ninety two  and certainly this was a great privilege  to be there for, was it, three weeks? •999395_101296•
        Three weeks I think  er  spending time with members of other churches  and also members of others cultures from all over the world. •101330_102835•
        The er  I've got to keep an eye on my watch, this is what I'm going by! •103066_103950•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	It's a   more than anything else. •103950_104115•
        I know that you are behind schedule  and I don't want to incur the wrath of your moderator! •104179_104671•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	During the, the fortnight in which we met in Canberra  eight hundred and twenty six of us were official delegates  er, to the World Council of Churches. •105000_106258•
        Delegates from the member churches. •106270_106580•
        And, in a sense  the World Council of Churches at this point can be regarded as the supreme legislative body  of the World Church. •106702_108123•
        And you're quite right  er  we must regard the World Church as meaning ourselves. •108153_109037•
        We tend to refer to the World Church as something outside our particular constituency  and we mustn't forget that we must own the World Church. •109312_110762•
        And this is something that came home to me very much in Canberra. •110847_111215•
        We  we are  from Wales  and I would like to say  that all the Welsh representatives were at one. •111311_112278•
        That we could own what was going on in Canberra. •112326_112858•
        This was not entirely true  of other  people from other churches  in the United Kingdom unfortunately! •112953_113916•
        The World Council of Churches assembly takes , place roughly every seven years. •114347_114928•
        And though the World Council Churches was formed  before the second world war  yet, the first assembly was not held until nineteen forty eight at Amsterdam! •115248_116587•
        Second assembly was held in nineteen fifty four at Edmunston in the United States. •116743_117321•
        And then it was , er, the turn of the third world  the third assembly  was held in New Delhi in nineteen sixty one. •117437_118483•
        And then, the fourth assembly er, was held in Loopsala in Sweden  and the fifth assembly was  er, held in Nairobi. •118585_119889•
        And then  er, the sixth assembly in Vancouver in nineteen eight three  and the seventh assembly  in Canberra, last year. •120053_121482•
        Now, you'll see that  it has a tendency to go  all over the world  wherever it is invited  but whoever invites the World Council of Churches now  must, in fact, be able to cope with a great number of people! •121482_123893•
        Not only delegates  but also people who attend as a service from other churches outside the membership of the World Council  and also  to cope with the press. •123893_125568•
        Unfortunately, in this country we were badly served by the press! •125621_126146•
        And it had, it'd be true to say that whatever you read in your newspapers  er, while we were in Canberra, I would advise you  not to believe half of it! •126146_127381•
        Or a quarter of this! •127381_127654•
        Because what came back to us was very much tittle tattle gossip  that people picked up in  er, Canberra! •127654_128673•
        And, it is true to say that that did not represent the  what really went on in Canberra! •128673_129517•
        Because, above all, it was an experience  experience of meeting people from different churches  experience of meeting people of different cultures  experience, too, of listening attentively and worshipping with people of different church traditions of your own. •129517_132249•
        And that was  something to  er  an experience to cherish! •132459_133413•
        The World Council Churches on this occasion reviewed the work accomplished during the seven and a half years since the last assembly  in Vancouver in Canada. •133413_134862•
        It , received a report therefore, from the Central Council of the World , Council of Churches  which meets  I think, once a year  Noel can correct me on this  once a year, or a at least once every two years. •134862_136496•
        And then we have a member from Wales on the Central Council of the World Council of Churches, Miss Carole  who  er, although she is from Wales, member of the church of Wales  she now lives in Belfast. •136717_138736•
        But er, we were not successful in putting up an  er and er to have a member of Wales elected on this occasion to serve for the next seven years  unfortunately! •138736_140301•
        And er  , it, this caused a great deal of hurt, if I may say so? •140301_141086•
        And then the er  Council also  set guidelines for it's programme in the years ahead. •141204_142118•
        It also chose presidents, it also chose, a  hundred and fifty members to serve  on the central committee, or the executive committee  of the World's Council of Churches. •142163_143511•
        It also made statements on pressing issues  in the church and the world. •143511_144176•
        And these, above all else included the Gulf war because  this  war was on while we were in Canberra. •144209_145381•
        And this really owed a great deal of tension! •145392_145856•
        We er, the we, we have also to make statements on the  indigenous people and land rights  because we were confronted with the position of Aborigine people  in  er, Australia. •145856_147674•
        And we were concerned about their land rights  or in other words, their human rights  •147674_148439•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*IDA:	their natural human rights. •148439_148586•
        I'll speak about that in a moment or two. •148586_148908•
        We were concerned too  about internal conflicts  in certain countries  and especially in South Africa. •148908_150050•
        But all these statements revealed the desire of the assembly to pray more ardently for the spirit of unity to reconcile  people. •150050_151633•
        Indeed, this was a very rare opportunity for all delegates and visitors, as I said, to meet  to listen  yes, and to hear it first hand about the life and witness of more than three hundred member churches throughout the world  in a hundred countries! •151661_153805•
        It was certainly and opportunity for the churches together to look at the world situation in conversation together and thus, to deepen the faith which have to proclaim  at arriving at a common understanding of the situation. •153805_155780•
        It isn't the  you are not expected, at least, I was not expected to  to see the Council producing masses of pages for our reading afterwards  and this report, by the way, is worth reading. •155781_157848•
        Sounds of the spirit. •157848_158069•
        If you had read this  I shouldn't be here this afternoon! •158069_158562•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	But are we going to inflict that on you? •158562_158894•
        But, can I say this  that what mattered most to me was the fact that I have been in conversation with so many people  and to be able to allow that conversation to affect my faith  and a faith that I have to  proclaim day by day and Sunday by Sunday  from the pulpits of my church. •158894_161764•
        As previous  as in previous assemblies  worship wasn't central to our activity. •161848_162538•
        Besides, morning worship there were midday sermons and in sessions  together with evening worship. •162538_163365•
        What I missed most at this , on this occasion was the opportunity for bible study, but I think  getting er, a visitor of another kind there was able to visit some of the bible studies each morning. •163389_165139•
        The daily pattern of study and discussion work was divided into two parts  in the morning, participants met in small groups  in the afternoon, all members  met in  session   sessions  reports from central committee  and also er, reports on developments in the World Church. •165245_167979•
        The main theme of the assembly, therefore, was  the prayer  come holy spirit renew the whole creation. •167979_169601•
        .Appertaining to a  to infuse  through dramatic presentations  the main theme  by the aboriginal of Australians telling about their life  and struggle. •169621_171302•
        Other Ecumenical topics presented were the life and history of ecumenical movement  you retain and justice and peace  ecumenical sharing. •171436_172468•
        and indeed, the recent programme justice, peace and integrature of creation featured very prominently in our discussions. •172468_173373•
        And no doubt, it will continue as a very important theme for the future. •173373_174029•
        Some themes of the assembly therefore were  giver of life  sustain your creation  spirit of truth  set us free  spirit of unity reconcile your people  Holy Spirit transform  and sanctify us. •174029_176277•
        What about the background, therefore  to the assembly's discussion? •176277_176718•
        But first of all  the global situation in the Gulf. •176750_177260•
        This marred the peace situation! •177267_177676•
        Plane flights had to be diverted  so, by the time we got to Canberra we were very conscious of the destructive element  of the Gulf  in our prayers and in our discussions. •177681_179095•
        Secondly, we were made aware of the effects of what can be described as liberation thinking and liberation theology  not only in South America  but only, also, in the Pacific regions  Asia, Japan and Korea. •179095_181431•
        Then  there was the influence of the third world, or the two thirds world  the churches  the politics  and the cultures. •181431_183091•
        And then fourthly, more and more the orthodox churches placed, played a very significant part in guiding the port of   as far as  as the assembly was concerned. •183091_184567•
        Significantly to, there was the abstinence of Roman Catholic church influence  and dominance. •184597_185270•
        Some of us, some of us tried to make a plea  and I hope we will try, still try to make a plea  that there should be a significant Roman Catholic  er, element within the membership of the World Council of Churches  in the future. •185270_187103•
        So we were presented, as it were, with a partial membership of the World Church. •187139_187956•
        As far as I'm concerned two things set the assembly  in context  firstly, the sense of space. •187957_188928•
        For many Australians the desert which covers much of their country means  a vast emptiness  solitude  and the struggle to survive in hostile surroundings. •188941_190310•
        But, for the original inhabitants of the lands the desert is the familiar place that provides nature  and gives meaning to life. •190310_191428•
        It was natural, therefore, that the assembly should take up this kind of understanding. •191428_191989•
        It was not too late to realise that space should be given in the programme for a proper consideration of the perception of winning in relation to the whole team of the assembly. •191989_193601•
        Winning space therefore  assumed a significant part of the assembly programme. •193616_194184•
        Again, as I said, the Gulf war brought the peace question very much into the arena  and accordingly there was always the pressure for , reconsideration of the peace  under the general heading of peace space. •194184_196280•
        And, can I suggest that we need to bring that very much into our discussions and into our prayers constantly in our churches. •196404_197783•
        Significant that we have been challenged by our master to be peace  makers  how real is that in our churches? •197799_199121•
        And  tomorrow will be the real test, won't it not? •199131_199634•
        That we are really praying for peace and identifying ourselves with peace struggle in Ireland. •199703_200793•
        Secondly, there was also the context of the Aborigines. •200793_201373•
        We were reminded of their plight at the opening service of the assembly. •201373_201831•
        One thing I forgot to bring with me this afternoon was a tape of the assembly worship  I'm sorry about that, but I don't think you've got a tape recorder have you? •201831_203243•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*IDA:	That upsets me! •203243_203399•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	We were reminded of their plight  of peace, as I said, at the opening service. •203399_203981•
        Outside the  marched in  the aborigines had their fire of gum tree branches  to purify the atmosphere  very much like the flames of fire which appeared on the first whit Sunday. •203981_205625•
        The twenty sixth of January seventeen eighty eight  the British established a small prison community at Sydney Cove on the east coast of Australia   villain read the declaration  and hoisted the Union Jack claiming the east coast of the entire Australian continent  for the British crown. •205625_208463•
        And that meant  quite a  effect as far as the aborigines were concerned  they had lost their territory! •208520_209621•
        The aborigines were not consulted or compensated! •209639_210171•
        European occupation of land gradually extended through most of the continent. •210171_210923•
        In more remote areas  reserves were set aside for the indigenous , inhabitants. •210969_211892•
        They were  , put aside, they did not count! •212016_212408•
        But by the end of the nineteenth century there were six British colonies in Australia! •212452_213209•
        On the first of January nineteen hundred and one  they formed a federation  and most adult aborigines were   •213209_214417•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*IDA:	vote  in the process  for deciding on the federation. •214417_214940•
        The culture of the minorities of indigenous people that  was given providence at the assembly. •214940_215566•
        And this was expressed in a very imaginative presentation by Professor   a young   in her keynote lecture when she called  for three significant changes. •215593_217488•
        The first was that for our generation  we must learn how to live with the earth  promoting harmony  sustainability  and diversity  and, therefore, creation, spirituality was the keynote of the address. •217748_220177•
        Secondly  she said there must be a change from the habit of dualism  to, what she described as interconnectialism We must see a relationship between things. •220193_221818•
        In many parts of the earth, she said, the organised life in accordance with a sense of dualism  body, spirit, man, women, black and white, poor and rich  we must try and see  them, in Christ  coming together. •221826_224317•
        They all make sense. •224372_224519•
        The third change was from the culture of death  to the culture of life. •224519_225085•
        What is happening right now in the Persian Gulf, she says, shows the best example of the culture of death! •225103_226114•
        She urged the assembly to use the energy of the Holy Spirit to tear apart all walks of division and culture of death in separators. •226114_227439•
        Let us participate in the Holy Spirit of  of life  fighting for our life on this earth in solidarity with all living peace. •227442_228556•
        Have you noticed  if you listen hard to your radio tomorrow morning  and you will hear so much about suffering and death  and very little  about life! •228591_229956•
        I think we had better try and influence that as churches  not that we should   about the suffering that goes on  about the death that goes on, but I think we ought to give all this  another dimension in churches. •229956_231957•
        That one would be  thankful of the fact that Christ  has spoke  and talked about life. •231957_233502•
        Now, this approach  was criticised by the Orthodox church representatives as merely  criticism  an attempt to unify different faiths. •233502_234549•
        But many of us saw it as an approach which emphasised the need to allow the faith of Christ to be incarnated within particular culture  and Sir Paul , the former Archbishop of New Zealand took the same stand point as  a Maori, in his own  address  and called delegates present to speak and act as people of hope  and to respond sensitively to economic and environment progility and isolation, not only in the Pacific but wherever they are. •234549_238765•
        Now then  who do we assess  with the assembly? •238770_239197•
        May I make  one or two observations and then I'll finish. •239260_239697•
        On the whole, the assembly gave us  and understanding  of the worldwide church which was struggling to achieve reconciliation and to promote peace    and justice. •239710_241238•
        If we belong to the World Church then we must be  in with  part of this worldwide process  and we shall never be ashamed of it. •241268_242595•
        Secondly, moreover, it was an experience and an opportunity to meet Christians of other churches. •242770_243740•
        Differing traditions and those of other cultures and be in constant dialogue with them. •243923_244596•
        We never have that opportunity  in this country do we? •244596_245088•
        Unless we ask people to bring in people, for instance, from the Afro- Caribbean churches to join us in our worship and to lead our worship. •245105_247738•
        Can I also say  that, er  yes, we were badly served by the press  but I think that er  the onus now is on those of us who went to Canberra to be able to share with others and  we have been going round to tell others about Canberra  to share with you and with others  the experience of being present in the World Council of Churches  in Canberra. •247750_251468•
        I would hope that  by the time we come to the next assembly  where there is going to be  that there will be an opportunity for the churches, er, at home here to take part in preparing for the next assembly. •251468_253390•
        Also, that the churches at home, of whatever church or denomination we are to be  they also can own, not just in  the World Council of Churches. •253397_254842•
        At present, I do think that there is that kind of willingness to be  er, engaged in this kind  •254923_255832•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*IDA:	of preparation. •255832_255927•
        I think, we ought to be taking time to try and  prepare, well  for the next assembly  and in doing so to own what goes on there and to say, yes  as the previous speaker said  we are the World Church in a very real way. •255950_259244•
        Now, moderator  I've taken  yes  I'm only five out of  •259245_259797•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	the programme! •259876_259888•
        Er, can I say that it's been a great pleasure coming  er, to you and to say that erm  that there's far more to say, of course, about Canberra  er, but I hope that that taster will help you to try and appreciate what went on there. •259900_262829•

*UNK:	 ((applause))
*ENA:	Can I thank you for sharing with us the  the example of the concentration, that you put so much in such a short time. •263010_263611•

*IDA:	 (        ) 
*ENA:	to us. •268884_268968•
        We ought now to  think briefly about . •269768_270013•
*PHI:	is never to show any interest in anything •270013_270344•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	because, if you do you get landed with what I've got to do this afternoon! •270350_270891•
        And  it was my concern that churches should know  the implication of the children act as it's related to  the life of the church that I'm  landing in front of you. •270898_272110•
        You should of all  saw the last Synod papers  received this. •272116_272654•
        How many of you are familiar with it? •272654_273042•
        There are a few hands. •273044_273165•
        I've got a red and a blue, I'm sorry I haven't got yellow and green •273165_273670•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	but I couldn't  get the  political parties. •273682_274036•
        It's not electioneering  er, they're just in different coloured paper  to please the eye. •274036_274742•
        Er, if you  have not had a copy of this sent to you  what I have said to them, by what I say afterwards  erm  it will be worth purchasing. •274751_275941•
        My question , again another question, how do you make the Lord interesting? •275941_mute_NA•
