*PS05X:	I did n't show you this David That 's that 's what it 's about . 
*PS107:	The Longman Treasury of Spoken English . 
*PS05X:	And they 're simply recording an awful lot of people in conversation . 
*PS107:	Oh yes . 
*PS05X:	Erm and they will keep them in the archives and I suppose transcribe them or something of the sort . 
*PS107:	Yes interesting . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes it is rather intriguing They just knocked at the door and said how would you care to take part . 
*PS108:	just stroke . 
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Oh yes and of course when you have it for two days you ca n't actually guard your language all the time . 
*PS107:	I do n't suppose they really want you to do they . 
*PS05X:	No I 'm certain they do n't That 's the last thing they want . 
*PS108:	Hardly ever What never Well hardly ever I 'm always criticizing on the B B C and I T V . 
*PS107:	About the English . 
*PS05X:	Oh yes There 's certainly plenty to criticize there is n't there . 
*PS108:	I 've got a bee in my bonnet about it . 
*PS05X:	Is n't it a good job we 're perfect eh . 
*PS108:	And there 's the controversy which I do n't approve of controversy and they rather roll their tongues around and in and out of words and . 
*PS05X:	Do n't you think that 's one of the beauties of English though . 
*PS107:	The problem is slightly in that . 
*PS108:	Formidable is n't she Formidable . 
*PS05X:	Yes formidable I agree . 
*PS107:	But word word pronunciations gets changed just by common usage do n't they . 
*PS05X:	Yes they do They do indeed Yes . 
*PS108:	Peculiar day for the first of June is n't it .

*PS108:	National Croquet Day . 
*PS107:	Mmm . 
*PS108:	Is it . 
*PS107:	Yes . 
*PS108:	Who told you that . 
*PS107:	Er I think I learnt that when I went to the meeting of the South East Croquet Federation earlier in the year . 
*PS108:	Oh yes when I was . 
*PS05X:	Yes you said David that in fact it was arranged a little late and some clubs did n't manage to fit it into their programme . 
*PS107:	Well no . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	We we had an open day last Sunday or Sunday before I forget . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes fair enough but . 
*PS107:	We could have held it today if we thought . 
*PS05X:	Right . 
*PS108:	When was it held . 
*PS107:	The open day You you . 
*PS108:	No I do n't mean how . 
*PS107:	Oh no Do you mean the . 
*PS108:	You said you went on the ticket .

*PS107:	The other one Caterham the other one . 
*PS108:	Was that the A G M or .

*PS108:	0 .

*PS104:	Italian coast . 
*PS107:	Yes . 
*PS108:	David not as far as St Tropez where . 
*PS107:	Horrible are n't they those oil slicks they 're dreadful Have you always lived in this area Evelyn . 
*PS108:	Yes home town . 
*PS107:	Sorry which is your home town . 
*PS108:	Bournemouth . 
*PS107:	Oh lovely yes I like Bournemouth . 
*PS108:	thank you so much very kind of you . 
*PS107:	Pleasure . 
*PS108:	Thanks awfully . 
*PS05X:	Nice to meet you Evelyn . 
*PS108:	Thank you very much . 
*PS05X:	Ah Well you may see me again you never know I shall look forward to it Cheerio . 
*PS107:	Funny old thing . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	Not a clue I do n't think . 
*PS05X:	Really . 
*PS107:	Ah what she gets out of it I just do n't know Companionship I suppose . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes . 
*PS107:	Shame Oh well I suppose it 's something is n't it If she gets that out of it . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes and it 's fresh air gentle exercise is n't it . 
*PS107:	Yes yes and it means she does get out and does see other people . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes indeed Does she tend to walk down when she goes . 
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Oh does she . 
*PS107:	She did drive until last year but I would imagine that she 's probably no longer safe driving . 
*PS05X:	Sure . 
*PS107:	She 's had two or three accidents in She 's a goodly age you know . 
*PS05X:	Yes Well I really enjoyed that David . 
*PS107:	Did you Good . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes It 's a . 
*PS107:	Do you want to come again think about it . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes . 
*PS107:	You 'll need come a good few times and give it three four six months . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	I think the books recommend really most players eighteen months to two years before you can come . 
*PS05X:	Before you can call yourself a player . 
*PS107:	Well before you can start setting up a break . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	I mean that does vary enormously When you come down from twenty to eight or nine in a season you know . 
*PS05X:	Golly . 
*PS107:	I know I mean he plays a lot of croquet He only works three days a week anyway because of lot of tournaments . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes . 
*PS107:	I mean he started at roughly about the same time as me I think he 's about five and a half five something like that . 
*PS05X:	My goodness Yes . 
*PS107:	He 's probably even less He 's an amazing player to watch bordering on breaking down all the time . 
*PS05X:	0 . 
*PS107:	Some of the shots he pulls off are fantastic . 
*PS05X:	Really Yes . 
*PS107:	Rather excitable that 's the only problem . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	Comes from Barnsley . 
*PS05X:	Oh yes What is his name . 
*PS107:	Edward . 
*PS05X:	Ah yes So how do you think the Eden Park problem is going to be resolved . 
*PS107:	What we really need to do is to find some land to play on I 've almost given up on the London Borough of Bromley because the land the areas that they 've offered us have been quite impractical and although we 've got you know croquet is a cheap sport No clubs have very much money I mean we 've got something like five or six hundred pounds . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	sitting doing nothing . 
*PS05X:	But that does n't go very far does it . 
*PS107:	No No it does n't I did go to Park Manor I might go back there again . 
*PS05X:	That a good idea . 
*PS107:	Because they 've got the land but I just did n't get on What about the Bromley Cricket Club Tennis Club Hockey Club complex . 
*PS05X:	I honestly do n't know David I genuinely do not know . 
*PS107:	I really feel in a borough as big as Bromley which is the biggest . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	they must have somewhere where we can play but erm perhaps I ought to trouble is that you get fobbed off you know The Mayor Mayoress said to me well we 'll find you something but . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	So you you bandy her name about People jump about for a bit but then having offered you . 
*PS05X:	Yes yep They 've done what they feel they should be doing . 
*PS107:	They say well we 've offered you three blocks and you 've turned them all down and you say well yes but you 've offered us blocks not not . 
*PS05X:	Not suitable for the purpose Yes yes . 
*PS107:	It 's not just the erm the fact the area round you need it 's also the location that 's involved . 
*PS05X:	Yes indeed . 
*PS107:	That was part of the problem We could have gone back to the where we started and then we only paid a couple of hundred pounds a year for the land that they used to keep the grass cut and everything but the problem was really the area We 'd never have been able to build a club up . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	And we we really decided that we would be much better not having all the hassle and just all joining or joining another club . 
*PS05X:	Yes quite quite . 
*PS107:	It 's much easier just belonging to a club and not having . 
*PS05X:	Yes absolutely yes absolutely . 
*PS107:	Go there when you want and play and . 
*PS05X:	It was very nice being there this afternoon and being able to walk straight on to the lawn . 
*PS107:	Yes yes well I think you will find that with most croquet clubs . 
*PS05X:	Really yes yes . 
*PS107:	I think perhaps the top clubs like I do n't I 've never been there They are supposed to have the best lawns in the country . 
*PS05X:	Are they Yes . 
*PS107:	Very good membership They spend a lot of money . 
*PS104:	In terms of lawns it 's the biggest club in the world . 
*PS05X:	Is it Yes . 
*PS107:	They 've got twelve thirteen lawns there . 
*PS05X:	Gosh . 
*PS107:	They have n't got the membership . 
*PS05X:	Shame . 
*PS107:	And of course the upkeep these days is quite high . 
*PS05X:	Yes indeed There 's a sort of general Dulwich Sports Club ground keeping facility I assume . 
*PS107:	Yes . 
*PS05X:	for that ground Yes . 
*PS107:	I think that perhaps that croquet is a poor relation but erm to the club itself I do n't know But I would have thought probably the squash or the bowls strictly probably generate more money . 
*PS05X:	And the ground is more intensively used perhaps for that . 
*PS107:	Well that 's yes I think that that that perhaps again one of the problems with croquet It uses up quite an area does n't it for er mm . 
*PS05X:	Well is it any more than a tennis court . 
*PS107:	Well I suppose a game of tennis does n't last as long . 
*PS05X:	No it does n't You can get several games in . 
*PS107:	It is possibly no worse than the cricket . 
*PS05X:	Sure . 
*PS107:	area because they have twenty two players have n't they . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	Though they are only eleven twelve or thirteen on at any one time . 
*PS05X:	Yes Yes I mean if it is possible to provide that huge acreage I mean the space per player or whatever is rather less for croquet than for cricket is n't it . 
*PS107:	Yes except you need a more perfect lawn that 's more perfect area . 
*PS05X:	Well there are there are green keepers are n't there I know a guy who bowls at the Bromley Bowling Club in exactly and he told me that they have professional green keepers who look after lots of different greens and they come into them once a week or whatever . 
*PS107:	Do they Well that 's interesting because we were wondering who we could get to have a look at our lawns and tell what 's wrong with it because they are not very good are they . 
*PS05X:	No no that one we were playing on certainly was n't the greenest and grassiest . 
*PS107:	It 's a problem You will find with a lot of croquet lawns . 
*PS05X:	Is it Yes yes . 
*PS107:	Well you know somewhere like Bromley Bowling Club would have a very good membership So there 's a lot of money coming in they could they could afford to have somebody like that . 
*PS05X:	Absolutely . 
*PS107:	looking after their lawns . 
*PS05X:	Absolutely yes . 
*PS107:	And London Borough of Bromley have got a spare bowling green in I forget the name of the road but it 's in the Beckenham area which unless they 're doing work to any of the main bowling greens just lies fallow through the summer . 
*PS05X:	Right . 
*PS107:	They obviously keep it cut and keep it up to scratch . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	But they were willing to let us play on it because croquet would n't have done any real harm The money they wanted for us to use it even just a weekend was absolutely ridiculous which to me seems in opposition to the whole idea of the borough . 
*PS05X:	Quite . 
*PS107:	The borough 's providing spaces for people to enjoy themselves . 
*PS05X:	Yes exactly exactly . 
*PS107:	But the problem being now of course that I think in line with most London boroughs there is club which tennis club which has tennis courts on Local Authority land They actually enter into a lease or tennis agreement with the London Borough . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	for a period of five or ten years and lease it off them and then have to maintain it And of course if you want to use somewhere like the bowling green for bowls or croquet then you 've got to pay the going rate . 
*PS05X:	Yes indeed yes . 
*PS107:	But I did feel that perhaps they could have bent the rules a little . 
*PS05X:	Yes and there are different going rates for different things as there are with property are n't there . 
*PS107:	I would have thought so But I suppose as a bowling green then you but he said that we 've already cut the stick their neck out will they . 
*PS05X:	No no no no no They are far too liable to have it chopped off Or they think they are . 
*PS107:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	I must admit that I got fed up with pursuing it and I think it 's like banging your head against a brick wall in the end . 
*PS05X:	Yes . 
*PS107:	Did n't really have the energy to pursue it . 
*PS05X:	Yeah No I do n't blame you If it did say locate to the Bickley area or something like that would you change the name . 
*PS107:	Probably If they did locate then I could get quite a good membership . 
*PS05X:	Yes Oh yes . 
*PS107:	ith croquet you know where the croquet players are and where they live . 
*PS05X:	Yes Yes . 
*PS107:	And even in quite a wide area not perhaps the garden croquet players you would n't know about the people who play in the back garden but you know the people who play in tournaments Or people who belong to other clubs . 
*PS05X:	Yes indeed Yes Yes . 
*PS107:	It 's odd I suppose because I mean I could be much happier to play a lot more if there was a subscription towards croquet It did n't particularly bother me . 
*PS05X:	Aha . 
*PS107:	I would think one gets a lot out membership . 
*PS05X:	Yes yes .
