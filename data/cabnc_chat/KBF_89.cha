        Got up for a wee in the night. •254025_254385•
        That's about all. •254456_254722•
*BRE:	phoned up yesterday. •255163_255264•
        She's  Tracey phoned up. •255264_255513•
        She's written off  and complained about the  judge. •255513_255923•
        She just weren't happy with the results. •255923_256540•
        Very disappointed with them. •256761_257335•
        And she, she never has any fails. •257371_257520•
        Majority  more than  over half  just got passes. •257696_258366•
        Had three she went into erm  Tracey placed that she come out honours  and Lisa highly commended. •258564_259434•
        And the other two commended. •259434_259590•
        And they three came out with honours and she came out  with a commended. •259649_260010•
        She said that she penalized her cos of her weight. •260106_260295•
        She wasn't a slim little tiny girl. •260346_260483•
        She says it's all wrong. •260507_260568•
        So she said I've written, I shouldn't do she said but  that she'd written and complained about it. •260597_261229•
*DAV:	Lose a bit of weight . •261229_261476•
*BRE:	This is it see. •261660_261718•
        If if you're tiny and  skinny and petite. •261718_262003•
        You, it's like Leanne I mean she's not a  as good dancer. •262093_262413•
        It's like Jenny, like Tracey said  Carla was the best at  She even said apparently to the big girls on a Monday  there's gonna be a lot of heads turning  a lot of chat going on when Carla comes out. •262465_263584•
        We're looking at honours this time and she just said last night she, she said that's why I phoned you she said cos I just can't believe it. •263664_264116•
        She said cos she was absolutely brilliant . •264188_264329•
        You couldn't fault her out there. •264343_264503•
        And even the  woman in the  examination  the pianist  she actually tells Tracey if some of them are bad or whatever. •264528_265345•
        And she came out and she said that Carla she said, she said will get honours. •265345_265652•
        She said she's absolutely brilliant she said you couldn't fault her at all. •265652_265880•
        And Tracey said that's the only thing she can think is the fact they were tiny, cos Emma and that all are, tiny little  skinny things and Jennifer. •265943_266764•
        And she said it's the fact that she's carrying the extra  •267109_267473•
*CAR:	How come I get honours in tap then? •267478_267907•
        With the top major examiner. •267933_268117•
*BRE:	Dunno. •268117_268166•
        I honestly don't know. •268166_268250•
        It's just yeah but certain, like she said isn't it? •268250_268818•
        Certain judges. •268846_268947•
        I mean look at the adjudicator at . •269048_269327•
*CAR:	Oh he's ridiculous. •269599_269644•
*BRE:	Mm. •269644_269650•
*DAV:	Some you win some you lose. •269650_269774•
*BRE:	Mm. •269774_269782•
        That's what I said to her I mean  and Tracey wanted her because  she didn't want her to feel upset. •269782_270306•
        When she goes in tomorrow night and all three of them have got honours and she never. •270306_270646•
        But I said to her she never gets higher than a commended cos, she knows it's cos of her weight. •270648_271104•
*CAR:	Yeah but they should . •271198_271384•
*BRE:	Yeah but they, there's people like that Carla. •271436_271742•
        But I said there was a lot lower than you got only passes  in your grade. •272297_273030•
        But it's the same in the tap weren't? •273288_273723•
        I was thinking today  you and Jennifer got honours  Emma got highly commended and Lisa got commended. •273723_274456•
        Weren't it? •274740_274770•
        I suppose and we all thought Lisa was better than Emma. •274837_275284•
*CAR:	She is. •275385_275397•
*BRE:	But evidently it's what, what the actual  you know examiner's looking for. •275418_276016•
        God I don't believe it. •276016_276380•
        He's got a  and slippers on. •276380_276914•
*DAV:	Right I'm gonna go and love you and leave you I'm afraid. •277409_278447•
