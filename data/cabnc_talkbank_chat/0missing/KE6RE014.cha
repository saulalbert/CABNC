*PS0X9:	Oh yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah Well I what I did n't tell you was I do n't know if I told Sandra did I No I did n't . 
*PS0XD:	ca n't remember it . 
*PS0X8:	No well . 
*PS0X9:	They wanted me to go on casual . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0X9:	You ca n't be casual any more it 's against the law . 
*PS0X8:	Well well well . 
*PS0X9:	even bar work but it 's . 
*PS0X8:	well . 
*PS0X9:	it 's against the law now . 
*PS0X8:	he said to me one day and I do n't remember the day he said the best thing would be for her to go on casual then she can keep her thingy thingy Well I never said . 
*PS0X9:	Oh yeah I 'm sure . 
*PS0X8:	yeah well I never . 
*PS0XD:	So you can do the same as him and you can also not register for poll tax . 
*PS0X8:	Well she 's registered already . 
*PS0X9:	I 'm registered already . 
*PS0X8:	And I mean if she got this job she 'd have to pay the full amount if she 's on Income Support you do n't do you . 
*PS0X9:	No I only pay twenty percent when . 
*PS0X8:	But that 's beside the point Yeah well . 
*PS0X9:	But I 'd rather pay the lot I tell you . 
*PS0X8:	Well no that 's very fair comment Bev but I think this is a dodgy do I find this . 
*PS0X9:	It sounds it . 
*PS0X8:	I find this strange Anyway what he said to me was . 
*PS0XD:	I reckon they 're gon na carry on paying her keep her on the books . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah no they 're not they 're giving her a lump sum . 
*PS0X9:	You see with maternity they have to do it anyway . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah but they 're giving her it all in one lump sum that 's the deposit on their place He told me that But this other bit that I was telling you . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	he phoned her that mor it was that morning I know it was now and anyway he went off and he phoned her and he came back and he said to me yes she 'll give us your phone number did n't he . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	And she said he said she said yes that 's cheaper for us Cos they wo n't be paying any . 
*PS0X9:	Nothing . 
*PS0X8:	thingy doodles I I said I do n't think you ought to touch it . 
*PS0X9:	Well I could n't do that anyway I 'd have to say . 
*PS0X8:	Well that 's what I said to you . 
*PS0X9:	if you take me on then it 's got ta go on . 
*PS0X8:	I told you that did n't I But I did n't tell you all that was said cos I thought well I 'm not gon na say it if there 's no need because you would automatically go there . 
*PS0X9:	I ai n't do nothing against the law . 
*PS0X8:	Well I think it 's gon na be difficult anyway Bev And the bus fares will be . 
*PS0X9:	Well it 'd be very expensive in the long run . 
*PS0XD:	I do n't well probably like some of the others cos they get a bus in on market day they get a bus home . 
*PS0X9:	Well she said it you have to catch the Woolworth one the one for Woolworth and then walk half a mile . 
*PS0X8:	I I do n't I I 'm bothered . 
*PS0XD:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	I know I 'm bothered about it though . 
*PS0XD:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	Well Sandra . 
*PS0XD:	and that 's years back now That was one po no that was seventy five each way but they go up through and it 's now gon na be twenty eight to Manor Road . 
*PS0X8:	Oh . 
*PS0XD:	just before the hospital . 
*PS0X8:	the hospital . 
*PS0XD:	and depending on whether they ca n't have an odd or even amount forty eight to the Drove which is as far as if you work at that 's as far as you can get in the morning and get off and walk through . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	But I 'm I 'm bothered by all this I know he 's a liar I know he can be a liar but I 'm still bothered by it I mean . 
*PS0X9:	Well . 
*PS0X8:	it 's Thursday and she was supposed to phone you Tuesday but he still keeps . 
*PS0X9:	If she phones then it 'll it it will be I would n't take it unless it 's on my terms . 
*PS0X8:	I think it you know . 
*PS0X9:	It would have to go through the books . 
*PS0X8:	Well it would . 
*PS0X9:	because no way . 
*PS0XD:	Well somebody sooner or later 's gon na catch up I ca n't understand really why these people think oh I 'll get away with it . 
*PS0X9:	I do n't know why they bother I do n't know why they . 
*PS0X8:	Well it 's like . 
*PS0XD:	Cos they do n't half hammer you and if they catch up with you once they watch you like a hawk . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah but this is the one that ai n't paying his poll tax look Bev . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah .

*PS0XD:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	No I do n't like this I do n't er it sticks in your mind do n't it . 
*PS0X9:	Well it would be on my terms there 's no way I 'd go cos I know it 's against the law . 
*PS0X8:	Well Sue said that to me up here did n't she . 
*PS0XD:	Yeah and they . 
*PS0X9:	They ca n't do it . 
*PS0XD:	and it was too much hassle to put her into any other job .

*PS0XD:	National Insurance . 
*PS0X8:	Mm Oh that 's something I was . 
*PS0XD:	Cos quite how they work it out I know before . 
*PS0X8:	Well .

*PS0X8:	Yeah that 's all we 've got left . 
*PS0X9:	0 . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah well I mean with all this noise and that you do n't feel like doing much do you . 
*PS0X9:	No . 
*PS0X8:	Anyway I talked to Ann about this this morning and we 've come to the decision to leave it on because that 's what we did in the in the erm . 
*PS0X9:	We knew you would . 
*PS0X8:	in the ha in the what 's name there and it might be a better idea because it 's not So if we start pulling them about which is cos I said to her about the hall and if I do n't scrub it all off we 're gon na have to erm gon na have to do the hall and er I said we 've got to try to put it on because the walls are so ooh bitty you know what I mean . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	And er I really feel that you know you can make yourself more bloody trouble cos that 's what happened to Helen next door When she got the erm paper off in the erm er er in the hall she found it all fell apart All the walls fell apart . 
*PS0X9:	It 's like living back in the flat . 
*PS0X8:	I 've done this before but I mean Tim will have to have a look at it when he . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	if it if we ca n't oh it 's the dustman . 
*PS0X9:	Have we . 
*PS0X8:	dustman in n it . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah Have we got a bucket . 
*PS0X8:	I 've got a bucket yeah why . 
*PS0X9:	Well it 's easier with a bucket . 
*PS0X8:	Oh Oh a kettle should do after that lot If we can get that lot sorted . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	and then you can use the kettle ca n't you . 
*PS0X9:	Yes Oh finished that sleeve off but I must sew it on . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	0 . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Right I 'll leave that there No I 'm afraid this Des is . 
*PS0X9:	Well I 'm not bothered . 
*PS0X8:	a very peculiar character I just find it all so peculiar And I mean Dee said to me this morning cos she heard us one morning . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	well Des she heard Des look talking about it and er she said has she heard anything and I said no I said not fully but more or less we stayed in yesterday cos you said shall we go out did n't you . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	And I said more or less we stayed in but not a word And I say there was some sort of a an embarrassment I can only call it . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	today All this whistling and . 
*PS0X9:	It was all nervous . 
*PS0X8:	nervous yeah Bit of singing and and that sort of thing Well they wan na do n't matter to me at all I just think they 're dodgy characters And you know they do n't pay the poll tax and you you 've been told almost you can do it on casual You got to think about it ai n't you . 
*PS0X9:	Mm Well I would n't do it on cas . 
*PS0X8:	Eh . 
*PS0X9:	I said I would n't do it on casual . 
*PS0X8:	Well you would n't do it no Too much bloody worry I mean we 've never done anything like that anyway I say it 's like him him not paying his poll tax If he 's gon na do things like that he wants to keep his gob shut does n't he . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	You know I just ca n't understand But mind you he ca n't keep his gob shut so I do understand you know that er . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	that is the way he is He 's full of gut really But anyway if they did phone now I think it 's very bad practice if she 's leaving tomorrow . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	cos Sandra said why the hell has she left so late You know I mean it must be three weeks now till she has it She said you do n't normally do that . 
*PS0X9:	Well she could have it any day now . 
*PS0X8:	Well that 's what she said fortnight either way actually Just exactly what Sandra said So she been in next door has she all the whole morning . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah well of course only just gone from last bloody night have n't they I mean she seems to fill the bloody house with people every day of the week Certainly some strange goings on in there I reckon . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah well you see some people ca n't help that . 
*PS0X8:	Some people what . 
*PS0X9:	Ca n't help that . 
*PS0X8:	Help what . 
*PS0X9:	But have people round . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah but it 's such a strange bloody house in n it Do n't know what 's going on in there do you . 
*PS0X9:	Well I would have liked to have known what the noise was last night I 'm sure it was a video game or something . 
*PS0X8:	If it picked up if he finds what I think he could probably find us I mean he knows precisely what we want and . 
*PS0X9:	He wants an amplifier . 
*PS0X8:	Yes but as I said before he now has heard it so . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	he knows what we want to eliminate . 
*PS0X9:	Oh he 'll come up trumps for us . 
*PS0X8:	I 'm sure he will What about the animals this morning then . 
*PS0X9:	Oh not bad . 
*PS0X8:	Well probably cos somebody 'd been with them In n it Well if they 're not left continually on their own they 've got a bit of company have n't they . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	That 's the point But when they 're left totally on their own for hours and hours Well make the veg if I do that . 
*PS0X9:	Woman and the man went up the garden . 
*PS0X8:	The woman what . 
*PS0X9:	Woman and the man and the kid . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0X9:	the alsatian and one other bloody . 
*PS0X8:	Went up the garden What were they doing then . 
*PS0X9:	Talk . 
*PS0X8:	Got a chicken and a bloody rabbit up there Well there was Whether there still is I mean I used to hear the chicken making a ruddy noise I mean obviously you wo n't hear the rabbit but I do n't think I 'm gon na stay in anyway Alright so we 'll be out two days there 's . 
*PS0X9:	No but you 're staying with me . 
*PS0X8:	nothing to do I mean we even get bored with the knitting .

*PS0X9:	You can very easily get bored with knitting . 
*PS0X8:	Mm What 's the Oh But I mean I get to work I 'm so bloody tired I 'll get those earplugs out for night times if it 's necessary . 
*PS0X9:	Mm .

*PS0X8:	Oh they brought that back in . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah I did n't think they were going All three of us if we went up for a weekend . 
*PS0X8:	He 's got ta work Bev he 's not doing enough He 's not doing enough he had one bad result another . 
*PS0X9:	Oh I did n't know that . 
*PS0X8:	No you did n't did you Couple of decent ones and one bad one And his average is sixty two percent Sunday but I mean I 'm not sure I 'll say it now I 'm not sure I 'm certainly not sure he 's doing enough If you think about it if you think about it I 've probably . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	where he is up and down up and down and people are in and out and . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	well I 'm sorry but from where I 'm looking at it sixty two but not that I 've thought about it in any depth but . 
*PS0X9:	Mm . 
*PS0X8:	0 . 
*PS0X9:	But there again and that have lived in town before . 
*PS0X8:	Oh yeah . 
*PS0X9:	so maybe not . 
*PS0X8:	Probably touting for business that 's all it is Barclays have lost a load of money . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah Right I can start . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah . 
*PS0X9:	if you want . 
*PS0X8:	It 's in the freezer there 's a packet . 
*PS0X9:	Well I 'll I 'll do er carrots and that first . 
*PS0X8:	And I say if you do the spuds just well if they start to go brown inside chuck them . 
*PS0X9:	Right . 
*PS0X8:	Cos it goes right the way through There 's a lot of out to the hospital though in n it . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Well I think we 'll have to find somewhere to lock it well Danny says there 's places all over . 
*PS0X9:	Well there will be . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah Could get a quite a a good deal I would have thought somewhere . 
*PS0X9:	use this tomato and onion . 
*PS0X8:	Well why not Yeah that 's a good idea . 
*PS0X9:	With minced beef I wo n't put carrots in cos that . 
*PS0X8:	No . 
*PS0X9:	might not be . 
*PS0X8:	Well see what they say Is there anything in here I 've got ta get out . 
*PS0X9:	Well the things will be in there . 
*PS0X8:	things . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah one So I wo n't do carrots . 
*PS0X8:	No But you need some more onion . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah I 'll do an onion . 
*PS0X8:	the potato will be on the top anyway so that wo n't matter will it . 
*PS0X9:	Well it says serve with fresh mince vegetable mixed vegetables Cos what you do is you put your meat in that you do n't put your . 
*PS0X8:	No . 
*PS0X9:	potato in it do potato on the side . 
*PS0X8:	Oh well we can do that then That 'll be simpler anyway wo n't it . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	It 'll be a pot of potatoes but I should put some onion in there though . 
*PS0X9:	Oh yeah . 
*PS0X8:	Cos he 'll want that . 
*PS0X9:	And your meat . 
*PS0X8:	And your meat yeah . 
*PS0X9:	So . 
*PS0X8:	Well that 'll be a bit simpler wo n't it Could that be done in a pot . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah well it 's for casserole so . 
*PS0X8:	Well a pot will be simpler for when we get back if she 's in of course but . 
*PS0X9:	No I ca n't see why not . 
*PS0X8:	Mind you get your tea . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	I think we need a breather anyway . 
*PS0X9:	Well it 's just a waste of a lovely day . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah It 's beautiful in n it . 
*PS0X9:	Well no the reason I and because these things just go so quickly . 
*PS0X8:	Well yeah . 
*PS0X9:	that maybe it would work out cheaper to start all over again Well they I would think up there there 's a screw . 
*PS0X8:	Screw yeah Well . 
*PS0X9:	Will you have the new fashion taps or do you want different bits here . 
*PS0X8:	This but this is twenty five pounds worth there . 
*PS0X9:	Yes I know . 
*PS0X8:	I mean it was only months ago cos it 's only a while ago that Tim came I saw that down there again . 
*PS0X9:	Do you want some more onion than that yes . 
*PS0X8:	I should chuck another one in what difference does it make . 
*PS0X9:	Oh my eyes . 
*PS0X8:	Yeah that is it I mean there is a lot of wall space here that is not wall look . 
*PS0X9:	Yeah . 
*PS0X8:	but I ca n't see the point of doing vinyl on that anyway I really can not .
