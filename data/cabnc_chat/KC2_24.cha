*FLO:	had been kind of, or whatever they are Mr F   and then on the back it's got for Peggy's six foot high and under plant eighteen inches apart for high six foot plus plant two feet apart
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	I mean Christmas ones are only a couple of foot apart, there's only about that much between them, you know?
*DAV:	And then, they grow together
*FLO:	Mm?
*CLI:	Yeah  (.) 
*FLO:	She gives you a better ground, ground cover
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	if they're two far apart, you get big gaps at the bottom
*CLI:	Yeah, that's why you keep the tops chopped, cos they actually comes out by themselves, they'll come out
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CLI:	and into the garden as well you see, not only longways, but quite wide
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	Yeah I'll be planting mine right up against the metal fence
*CLI:	Yeah
*FLO:	so hopefully they should grow through the fence, come out the other side and eventually the fence will be hidden such as 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	well it's got my electric cable running through that fence you see
*CLI:	Oh  (.) 
*FLO:	Well it actually doesn't very, it doesn't touch the actual fence it erm   (.) all along the concrete poles they've got holes through them where you can put some wire different higher of fence you see
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	wire through each lead, you know, put back through each one, where you going?
*CLI:	The shop
*FLO:	What for? (.)

*DAV:	Mm, that's right though, there should be a   (.) they make out,wh ,wh , what's all that about then, vote for at the next election or something?
*CLI:	No
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	mm the B N P party  (.)

*FLO:	British Nationalist Party   (.) mm that sounds a good party to vote for  (.) 
*CLI:	Have you had your leaflet through the door yet?
*FLO:	No
*CLI:	You're obviously the last people to have them then, I think everybody else has had them
*DAV:	I want the phone bill to lob into them as well, but I ain't got one
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	all round the trees, like that woman did with her husband   (.) cos she, she was a bit of a lunatic and er
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	and er so one night she gave him, come in a bit paralytic, wanted a drink, so she give him a drink with a load of tranquillisers in
*CLI:	Mm, mm
*DAV:	he passed out that killed him and found him in the garden, it took four years to find him
*FLO:	 ((laugh)) really?
*DAV:	Whenever, anybody asked where he was, oh he was abroad working abroad
*FLO:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLI:	Oh those trees will grow really quick anyway, cos they're so many goodness in the ground in their garden, it's bloody amazing never think to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CLI:	and I reckon what it is they spray the fields with all this stuff
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CLI:	and all that lot, yeah, and then when it, when it rains you see cos it's a lot of clay
*DAV:	It can't be washed away so easy
*CLI:	Yeah it does, it all washes down into the garden you see cos the garden's on a slope and the field, the field slopes straight into the garden, and when we have, when we really have lots and lots of rain, you look out your back windows and there's about that much lying there, cos it's running down and it can't get past the houses, so it just builds up and floods
*DAV:	Yeah, I shall make sure the er path between your houses is lower than anything else, so it takes it away
*FRE:	Mm, my patio's going down there
*DAV:	Oh you can't
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	patios
*FRE:	No, it'll be alright
*DAV:	Mm, you wait until we have that heavy rain
*FRE:	Er want, it want
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	by the time I spent just
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	it's gonna be flat to the, and I'm gonna build a wall about two foot high and level the garden
*DAV:	Yeah
*FRE:	and level with the top of the garden
*DAV:	Yeah
*FRE:	so it'll all be level so that 
*DAV:	Yeah, it'll still come down though won't it?
*FRE:	No it wouldn't, can't, can't not at the ground level, it will sit at the top
*DAV:	No it won't, no it won't, seep through earth eventually
*FRE:	No, but it wouldn't seep through that wall though will it?
*DAV:	No it'll go round it, won't it?Down it or under it
*FRE:	It'll go in next door's garden then, mm
*DAV:	It'll either go round it or under it won't it?
*FRE:	Mm
*DAV:	What about size,
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	right up to the house innit?
*FRE:	Mm
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	right up to the house
*FRE:	Mm
*DAV:	the patio, not the wall
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	No
*DAV:	you can either go round it or, or under it
*FRE:	the wall just going to go straight across the garden
*DAV:	Yeah, what are you gonna have some steps up?
*FRE:	Yeah, steps in the middle, yeah
*DAV:	That's it and that's where the water will come through
*FRE:	No
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	come down them steps and straight through your house
*FRE:	Er, er, er I'm going to put a drain in anyway, in the middle of the patio
*DAV:	Yeah, but where?
*FRE:	What?
*DAV:	Where you gonna
*FRE:	Into the sewer, cos there's a drain bit just where the patio's gonna be and the drain what comes out the outfill
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	the washing machine away
*DAV:	Yeah
*FRE:	and I just have, well
*DAV:	put another pipe in
*FRE:	just put another pipe in it   (.) knock a couple of bricks out and knock a pipe in and that's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	no I didn't want to leave a little, only want to leave a proper little drain things, you know  (.) 
*DAV:	It's probably a six high inch pipe underneath there I should think  (.) 
*FRE:	Mind you, them, actually they
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	straight underneath the back door
*DAV:	Then they all go along the back
*FRE:	Mm
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	with them along the back
*FRE:	Mm
*DAV:	I ain't worked out how the sewers
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	goes to the
*FRE:	Mm
*DAV:	I think it goes underground nex , our next door neighbour's house, and out, the only
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	we've got, is at the back of the house right, and then it goes up there, then that is the houses and it goes down to the sewer in the road, so er
*FRE:	I didn't know
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	no, no, no, that's what I can't understand, no I think it's about a hundred years old you see, probably
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	erm thinking about sewers ain't they?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah, probably not, it'll pocket out the window job
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	mm
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	so as long as they er didn't actually have
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	You had toilets out in the garden, didn't you?
*DAV:	Yeah, that's why you see, we've converted, put a wall up where the door were and knocked the wall down and had a door into the house  (.) 
*FRE:	That's chaos that is
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	innit? (.) Yeah, see all these trees as well, clean all the air, all   (.) the air and the ozone and
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*CLI:	convert carbon dioxide not, not, not carbon dioxide back to oxygen can't they?
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FLO:	them might not even go straight to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	but half way from the lawns here, I'm thinking actually about having a round lawn, right,
*DAV:	Yeah, that's harder 
*FLO:	even on the 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	to keep cut easier to cut it square
*FLO:	well have a square one, but where, half way up in between the fish pond and the lawn I was thinking of come in, in again with the edge both sides, sort of like, where it goes, where they go straight, come in sort of like plant two there or three there, two there, one there, you see so it does it into a point again, both sides you get two
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	I wanna plant a maze actually in my garden  ((laugh)) , that's what I want, you'll be amazed Mark wait till I start digging my pond cos Marcus is coming over to help me, yeah he is  (.)

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	where you put all that earth?
*FLO:	Mm, it banks up the other side   (.) banks up the other side you see and then once the pond's all in you sort of landscape it all down and you use it as a rockery, I want the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	anyway to go the other side on the other
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	no it's been there two years
