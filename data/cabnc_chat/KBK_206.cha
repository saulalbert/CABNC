*CHR:	Where's Snoopy getting the money from to go to the Tiger's Head tonight? 
*NOR:	 (  ) credit cards in use. She can go where she likes. I only gave her fifteen. So I said I was tired of waiting for the money for my things and she can collect it from the students and have it when it came. 
*CHR:	Well done. That was a fiver was it? 
*NOR:	 (  )  (.) 
*CHR:	Yes. Presumably they've all got their films. So they should jolly well be stumping up. 
*NOR:	If she's not bothered to collect them 
*CHR:	Yep yep suffer. Yep.
