*MAR:	Mm  •127942_128002•
*TER:	so providing they just play it steadily they should be alright, there's a lot of discrimination over the Australian defeat in the paper, they reckon that if erm •128672_141322•
*MAR:	Only  no, no, go on what was it? •141662_147072•
*TER:	They reckon that if erm Australia lose another match it could mean that they won't even make the semi finals and erm they reckon like that, that channel nine that's supposed to be backing all this •147592_163152•
*MAR:	Oh yeah, aha •163152_163492•
*TER:	well they think they'll pull the plug on it •164352_165812•
*MAR:	Oh yes •165812_166212•
*TER:	and show re-runs of Neighbours instead, now can you think  can you imagine   anything worse than that? •166312_174302•
        Oh dear, I thought that was funny  yes  cos there's been so much •174302_188622•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	in Australia, you know, I mean it was really a competition  •188622_192262•

*TER:	just to show that Australia was gonna be champions again you know •192262_197792•
*MAR:	Mm  that and erm •197792_203272•
*TER:	Australia play India next then they play England, that'll be a match and a half I think •203272_208862•
*MAR:	Should be, especially with this erm, this •208962_217562•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	oh yes, yes •217742_218402•

*TER:	Right, mm •232062_232932•
*MAR:	Oh fancy Botham being out, I was hoping that, you know he was going easy •233872_242392•
*TER:	Yes, I was •242392_243612•
*MAR:	erm letting Gooch score  •243612_245512•
*TER:	Perhaps he was going too easily you see, not playing his natural game, I mean it's, you never know do you? •245512_249932•
*MAR:	Well perhaps it needn't where he just had  plenty of porridge •249932_270372•

*MAR:	you know just have a little bit off it  •285472_287652•
*TER:	Yeah  •287652_287752•
*MAR:	taken off it, cos I was looking at the length of it when we were in France •287752_293432•
*TER:	Mm, mm •293432_294612•
*MAR:	and I think that looked a nicer length  •294612_297502•
