*TER:	Well I think that you know, this, this that the ground they're obviously looking at
*MAR:	Yes, and also the car and the railway being close at hand
*TER:	Yeah   (.) Gosh didn't know, I hadn't heard that
*MAR:	What's that?
*TER:	 [reading] One of Stephanie  close colleagues has been under gun guard, police guard for a week following death threats on the alleged kidnapper, as the net closed on him he phoned estate agent Jane  the girl who helped prepare the second artist impression, Jane had met him face to face when he called at the office in Great Bar Birmingham days before the kidnap to collect details on several houses for sale, her blood ran cold when she picked up the phone on Wednesday February the twelfth to hear his voice again
*MAR:	Gosh
*TER:	he told her that even if he was caught he had now enough money to get her, police monitoring calls to the Shipway's office traced the call within seconds to a phone box at the service station on the A one at Groinby near Gran Grantham Lan , Lincolnshire, police cars arrived at the call box only minutes after the kidnapper had left
*MAR:	Gosh
*TER:	part of the telephone box used to make the threats was dismantled and taken away for forensic examinations  []

*TER:	on crime reminds me that Bob told me only he doesn't, he doesn't know how much Bridget knows, so we mustn't say anything to her, but he said that there is some possibility that she may get erm, I think April time she may be made what's called Court Officer
*MAR:	Oh
*TER:	in which case she'll be a nine to five on her sort of on a Monday to Friday basis but 
*MAR:	Yeah 
*TER:	she'll be sort of liaise between the police, the court and the erm prosecuting service
*MAR:	They should know everything there was there to know
*TER:	and do you know she'd be good at that I think
*MAR:	Yes
*TER:	so there's a possibility of that apparently
*MAR:	Yeah, oh well we
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	I knew that you were talking to him about something 
*TER:	Forgotten all about that just sort of it triggers 
*MAR:	and I thought you know to myself well, well all secret 
*TER:	triggered the mind 
*MAR:	things I wasn't supposed to know 
*TER:	No, no it wasn't that at all it was just that it completely,complete completely went from my mind  (.) 
*MAR:	Well that would be good of course 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	that's better really, and we surely don't want to lose them do we?
*TER:	Yeah   (.) Gosh   [reading] a record seven hundred thousand Brits are expected to head for the slopes this winter with the snow the best in Europe for twenty years  [] 
*MAR:	Mm, well I suppose when could we fit it in  ((laugh)) 
*TER:	Be nice to go back to it wouldn't it?
*MAR:	Yeah, still we can't have three holidays in a year can we?
*TER:	Why not?

*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	long time   (        ) see, see such an impression of dodgy back acting, poor old William Roche who plays Ken Barlow in Coronation Street has been moaning and groaning and wincing and rising in the most frightful and indeed the most convincing of manners, he has even for the match of the
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	those few
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	to Coronation Street do not know all the facts of course, we are ignorant of the finer points of the time gone by, but why is Deirdre so lasted to Ken I've yet to catch up with Wednesday night's proceedings on my video contraption  ((laugh)) , but the last thing that I heard Deirdre say to Ken as he was recovering on a put-u-up in her front room was, I'm stuck with you till you back on your feet and as far as I'm concerned it can't come soon enough for me, Ken lay there immobile, stunned, a cruel carry on, what's the poor chap done, but then I've missed too much    []  ((laugh))
