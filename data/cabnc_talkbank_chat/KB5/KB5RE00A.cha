*PS0YC:	Right anybody else There should be a timetable at sometime .  813845_821605
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah there is .  821775_823375
*KB5PSUN:	Eh do .  824005_825025
*KB5PSUN:	Already Thursday .  825075_826175
*PS0YC:	It 's what this Thursday .  826625_828005
*KB5PSUN:	Next Thursday .  828005_828785
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	Alright .  828875_829035
*PS0YC:	If it 's if it 's the first Thursday .  829675_834585
*PS0YC:	Eh right if you 've got one of the the two plus three have we have we all got these yeah Yeah have we got these These complex questions The one where that one number eight and it 's it 's got that complex number that 's the one we looked at just before the end of half term yeah Where you got number so what you do is you multiply by the complex conjugate top and bottom if we do that it comes out out of multiple of one I think it 's a is it Yeah it is .  839235_908615
*KB5PSUN:	Oh .  908705_908955
*PS0YC:	Oh it is .  909935_910325
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah half .  910605_911265
*PS0YC:	It 's a half now if it 's a half of that And then the second says show that that complex numbered to the power of four where that complex number is that complex number so all you do is that four that and then you get minus a corner Yes so that 's the answers So the two answers are land and the answer is minus a quarter I 'll pin that one on the board .  911535_946025
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	Right the second one now I 'm gon na do is the one that 's equals three plus four yeah and you have got ta write down in the form P plus Q I so it 's the real bit plus the imaginary bit one over Z One over Z is one over three plus four I 's I think we 'll do that How do we go to the the form a number plus times it by the convex conjugate is sub three minus four I three minus four I and what we get is three minus four I over twenty five eh that sound reasonable to three twenty fifths minus four twenty fifths high and that 's Q I and one over Z square or the second bit several ways to do this what you can do is work out what the square is first so if I do a little aside Z square it 's three plus four I square which is nine plus three forty five twenty four I plus sixteen I square which is twenty four I divide seven who 's that so one over Z square is one over minus seven plus twenty four I Multiply by the complex you get again and work the Z square that 's pretty hard to multiply M I square minus one do that by changing the imaginary and multiply by then you get an answer .  948795_1075655
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	You could square that you could square that complex number right if that 's because one over Z is square one over Z one over squared .  1083135_1112475
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	Yeah problems cos once you 've got one over Z squared if I work it out you get minus seven minus twenty four I over ten sevens erm oh so you get .  1113395_1129955
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	forty nine on the bottom is that No no not forty nine That 's not forty nine it 's erm that 's twenty four which is seven twenty four twenty five twenty six six hundred and twenty five .  1135015_1149565
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	What 's that So we get minus seven of six two five minus twenty four I over six two five Right that 's the the complex number one over Z square that 's the answer Right you 're you 're happy about how I got that .  1153885_1174625
*KB5PSUN:	Yes .  1174625_1174735
*KB5PSUN:	Yes .  1174735_1174845
*KB5PSUN:	Yes .  1174845_1174955
*PS0YC:	a bit louder a just seven square minus seven minus seven gives me plus forty nine yeah .  1175205_1184275
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah .  1184275_1184335
*PS0YC:	The minus seven times that we could be .  1185535_1188205
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	plus something and an seven times that one would give you minus pass onto that then twenty four times twenty four is five hundred and seventy six I square for it 's minus I square minus formula cos then when I add to add I get six hundred and twenty five it 's just it 's one you know like the three four five triangle in Pythagoras yeah you know when you get three four five and you can make them three squared four squared so is five squared right well seven twenty four twenty five is another one of those right that 's how I knew seven twenty four I knew is six hundred and twenty five that 's how I that 's how I knew it 's Anyway we get these complex done and you can check that and that fits the right and then the second part of the question t is find the argument Well the argument remember what the argument is It 's time by the minus one which bit 's on top The imaginary bit 's on top so I 've got twenty four over six two five divide by seven to go over six two five Eh have you got fractions like that Something over six hundred and twenty five divided by something over six hundred and twenty five now that is exactly the same as just a twenty four over seven cos the six twenty five will cancel out If I do twenty four divide by seven inverse time I 'll get an Well now what 's the anybody got a calculator with them Twenty four divide by seven inverse time got a .  1189145_1307725
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*KB5PSUN:	Well what sort it out .  1309655_1310965
*PS0YC:	Twenty four divide by seven it 's three point six I mean it 's definitely of degrees .  1312515_1319805
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	one point nine degrees .  1329185_1330405
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	So we get the one point nine degrees now we 've got to interpret that now Now you remember the really big puzzle on there the imaginary bit goes there and minus seven of something along the route bit and minus twenty four of them so I 'm going minus seven six hundred and twenty fifths there minus twenty four seven so the actual lines go like that so the one point nine at that angle so the actual is going to be which is two sixty one point nine .  1332145_1369745
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	Right then let's that 's what we was doing Now if well certainly there 's a lot more complicated things in complex numbers you should all you really done is to this thing about the complex you get them work out some algebra you go out and Z square some algebra and then you 've done the complex with some algebra and with the use of plus and minus signs in there it 's a little bit tricky but nothing that that at A level that you should n't be able to handle right and once you 've got that you look for some new just working and the least and deciding what happened when you 've actually got That really I mean that 's six marks on the yellow paper at that level that 's really six per cent but really it 's all that that 's that looking at that that is one of the easier questions I would deal out very easy That 's definitely one of the easier questions I would deal out .  1377125_1449625
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	No all the complex numbers that you get on that on that maths are in similar you should be able to do them that is one of the key questions If you think this is hard wait until we go through go through representing back to equations .  1450145_1478555
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah .  1478555_1478905
*KB5PSUN:	No worries .  1480045_1480295
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah .  1480295_1480635
*PS0YC:	You 'll probably be able to that .  1481565_1482655
*KB5PSUN:	yeah probably .  1482685_1483185
*KB5PSUN:	Is the the difficult stuff .  1483185_1484085
*PS0YC:	Right next question is the one where you 're given these two complex numbers and you 're asked to show the the modules of Z one squared is two times the modules of Z two squared So all it is is says sure that that 's that so what I 'm gon na do is say the modules of Z one is the square root of five squared plus one squared so if I want the modules of Z one squared then all I 've got is five squared plus one squared cos when I 've squared it it gets rid of the square root which is do n't you think No so Z two is the square root of two squared plus three squared so I want Z two square is two square plus three square different in square root so the two times is two times well two square is four plus that that is that Right next one which is find the argument of Z one times Z two Yeah again a couple of different ways of doing it what you can do is you find the argument of Z one find the argument of Z two and then what what will we do for the answers add them together to get the to arguments to something worth together we add them or we can work out Z one times Z two and then just find a modulist of that complex number now which way do you want to do it .  1484085_1634615
*KB5PSUN:	First way .  1634615_1634815
*KB5PSUN:	Go on it 's up to you .  1634815_1635745
*KB5PSUN:	Go on .  1635745_1636075
*PS0YC:	John said one .  1636075_1636815
*KB5PSUN:	working out a modules you have to find the .  1636815_1639315
*PS0YC:	Sorry did that one I 've got to accept it right find the find .  1640255_1649480
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	find the is up that way somewhere that 's fine that 's one argument of that is four over five inverse time one divided by five inverse time .  1649580_1659640
*KB5PSUN:	Three eight one seven .  1659760_1660180
*PS0YC:	Seventy eh .  1660210_1660660
*KB5PSUN:	forty five degrees .  1661080_1661580
*PS0YC:	One divided by five have you ever put one divided by five Must be less than one five .  1661580_1682770
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah we 're waiting for a .  1682880_1701130
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	Good Z two is minus two plus three minus two plus three I .  1701130_1706100
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	So that 's two that 's three so three one forty five inverse time what 'll we get One point five inverse time fifty six point three is in there so the answer we want is minus two one three one two three seven so add that to and I hear one two four .  1706140_1743840
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS028:	So that 's R Z one Z two that 's two R's together and then what I calculate the side B the square root of sixty minus thirty I eh this about the hardest figure that I can do in complex numbers the square root of sixteen minus thirty I Must n't sixteen minus thirty I but we want the square root of that to begin plus D times Oops then if I square both sides of that equation then sixteen minus thirty nine equals the A plus B I square yeah that 's just the square on both sides so sixteen minus thirty nine equals square this out under A squared plus two give me plus three squared I squared Yeah that 's just algebra that 's just what planners they 've got If I were back at the A squared I squared is minus one so I 've got minus three squared there 's two give me by I Equals minus thirty nine now because those two complex numbers are the same are the same so sixteen is E S squared minus three square the imaginary grids are also the same so minus thirty equals two eight B Do n't really imaginary grid on this side imaginary grid on that side from which if I second one you can see A that A equals minus fifteen over three There take for two and what are the two categories turning to get fifteen over three No nothing nothing fantastic brilliant yet then substitute all that into the other one so sixteen equals minus fifteen over B squared minus B squared still nothing fantastic eh sixteen equals five square when I get two two five over three squared minus three squared Yeah that 's just square Square root has becomes fifteen squared two plus five B on the boxed squared three square Get rid of the nobody has any questions Multiply through sixteen B square equals two two five minus B to the four cos B squared have B squared multiply B square and I get that Now bring it all over the left hand side and we 'll get B to the plus sixteen B square minus two two five equals what That 's just bringing that minus B squared bring that to twenty five minus .  1744380_1994100
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*KB5PSUN:	We came to find out . 
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah .  2005740_2005970
*PS0YC:	Like you got I mean put the other side of the Cos what we 're going to do now is real what really what this is this is like a quadratic equation it is B square squared plus sixty B squared minus two two five so that 's a quadratic equation but instead of saying X square I 'm saying B square square plus sixteen B square So what I 'm gon na do is use the let's see it 's minus three plus I 'll minus the square in B square sixteen strand minus four times the eight nine C well I 'm gon na do that four times eight nine C equals plus nine all over to A just two .  2006100_2071400
*KB5PSUN:	Ca n't you do the main this way .  2071400_2074770
*PS0YC:	You ca n't evaporate it yeah It vaporises fairly easy .  2076020_2079940
*KB5PSUN:	Well I got .  2079940_2081070
*PS0YC:	Very very easily vaporises it but and then when I do that I get minus sixteen plus I minus the square root off one thousand one hundred and fifty six all over two plus minus sixteen plus or minus what 's the square root of one thousand one hundred and fifty six .  2081070_2102320
*KB5PSUN:	Thirty six is it .  2102460_2104850
*PS0YC:	I do n't know Thirty four oh thirty four all over two All over two then if you pass spread them over minus sixteen add thirty four gives me eighteen over two or if I do minus thirty four I get nine over two that 'll be plus nine or even minus twenty five .  2104850_2133480
*KB5PSUN:	Eh start off with cos you 've gone all the way through that .  2133530_2157420
*PS0YC:	Yeah eh with the end you could have B equals minus fifteen over here and you would have still got the same answer Now we 've got this far so now remember what we 're doing we 're finding out what B squared is so either B squared is nine or B squared is minus twenty five Yeah now then one of the things when we get this complex numbers and B itself is a real number and B itself is a real number right plus B I is actually what we call a complex number if those two apart they 're just numbers So we ca n't have B square in twenty five twenty five cos nothing exists there twenty five well we have got complex numbers but we ca n't have B itself in the complex number right so B square must be nine so either B is plus three or B is minus three one or the two .  2157420_2231500
*KB5PSUN:	0 . 
*PS0YC:	Now if B is plus three then going back to me formula here is going to be minus five cos if I put the three in it there I get minus five from there And if B is minus three then here is plus three plus five so the complex number that is the square root is either two in that pair minus five plus three nine or it is five minus three nine so it 's either that one or it 's that one and we can write that down very very simply because that one and that one are just the opposite sides but either plus or minus .  2231500_2294940
*KB5PSUN:	I suppose .  2295210_2295500
*PS0YC:	Three five and when you 've worked these square roots out they always come out the opposites sides it 's always plus or minus always always always When you work these square root things out whatever square root is it 's always one like one plus three minus five the other one 's minus three plus five they 're always like that Cos they 're what we call complex conjugals .  2295500_2328960
*KB5PSUN:	Do we gets points then sir if the other one was twenty five .  2328960_2343600
*PS0YC:	Yeah it 's just pure coincidence it 's just the way that trotting around I think what we 're trying to do was to say something wrong in exam book plus plus which is not liked but I do n't think they are the alike Cos they do n't actually if you do something like that say you put plus five minus five and then sit down and you 're the one that plus three and minus three you do n't actually lose marks doing something wrong you can not be penalised for doing it wrong you can only gain credit for doing something right because they 'll give you five marks to doing that bit right and then knock three off for doing something else wrong they they would never give you penalty marks they will only credit for doing things right but so often it 's quite like down as you want you ca n't All that 's doing is is the account against this sort of idea that you can always do it .  2343690_2410830
*KB5PSUN:	Yeah .  2410970_2411510
*PS0YC:	Or like people come to you getting forty per cent and forty per cent was of these then the he was was not as good as that one but that one gets the B that one gets the C so you wan na That 's an interesting point that any square root any square root you always get two answers for square roots yeah it 's always plus thing and minus thing in complex numbers when you get complex numbers there are always what we call complex conjugators if you drew them on them on them diagram right if you drew them on the diagram what 'll you get plus five minus three I plus five minus three I and then and then we get minus five plus three I You get plus and minus there .  2411510_2478430
*KB5PSUN:	Pardon .  2478430_2478510
*PS0YC:	That 's but that is the hardest thing now the hard thing about that is not actual complex numbers it 's sort of these equations which is something else you 've done equations but the other one have n't really got time the other one complex numbers said what it said to given by that you 've got to draw them two on a diagram that very very slow calculate the modules as Z more minus Z two what work is what Z one minus two is they work in modules Work out what Z one divided by Z two is and then find the argument of it and give your answer in ratings there The last little bit it says give your answer in ratings suppose W right I just suppose W had the seven plus fifteen I how you gon na get R W in ratings Well one way you can do it is press the ratings button on your calculator press fifteen divide by seven and then press the ratings button so just do that change it on the ratings one yeah press fifteen divide by seven in .  2478600_2605930
*KB5PSUN:	One point one three four .  2605930_2613810
*PS0YC:	One point one three four right one point one three four right ok do it like that although that does n't mean anything at all here that 's the right answer because you you 've in ratings right if you wanted to put it back on degrees ah now press fifteen divide by seven equals and then press inverse .  2613960_2638310
*KB5PSUN:	Sixty four point nine .  2638310_2640990
*PS0YC:	Sixty four point nine well sixty five point nought degrees so sixty five degrees technically right that number is sixty five degrees now one pi is one hundred and eighty pi is the same as one hundred and eighty degrees so if we 've got sixty five degrees what we 've got is sixty five over a hundred and eighty pi .  2640990_2670570
*KB5PSUN:	Sorry .  2670570_2670670
*PS0YC:	Do that do that on sixty five divide by one hundred and eighty multiply by the pi on your calculator just one second Robin yeah it 's usually it 's just theatrical you should get yeah so you get the same answer so you can either work it on ratings or you can write it like that you could 've actually left it like that if you come to the third by you put thirteen over what is it eh .  2670670_2705480
*KB5PSUN:	Multiple fifteen .  2706920_2707160
