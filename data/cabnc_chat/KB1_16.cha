*ALB:	They're not mock exams are they?
*COR:	No.Proper exams.I've got my Red Cross in stage one, my R S A   (.) part one and two, stage two.I've got shorthand Pitman   (.) not Pitman, R S A, shorthand Teeline   (.) shorthand Teeline again at end of one, end of year.And I've got another one in   (.) word processing, hopefully.I've got my audio.My audio o transcription   (.) medical   (.) and I've got my Teeline medical.

*COR:	No.That's right.But I don't know how long it is before I get my results back.But   (.) you can get a post   (.) as a medical secretary in a hospital or a G P without   (.) having your full diploma.If yous let it, cos   (.) to get the full diploma you've got to get your two skills which is medical   (.) audio, and medical shorthand, you've got to have them two skills   (.) to get the diploma.And you've also got four papers   (.) ethics and   (.) etiquette   (.) you got an English one, a medical aspects one, and a clerical skills one.Not a clerical skills one, but, office procedures.And you've got to pass all them, plus your two skills   (.) to get the diploma.But you can resit any what you fail the following year.Mm. ((clears throat)) 
*ALB:	Mm!
*COR:	Teresa says, the only one what presents any difficulty is usually the medical aspects one.
*ALB:	Well why should that present anything different?
*COR:	Because it covers such a wide area.It says the English paper you only need, you only need seventy five percent   (.) for your   (.) erm   (.) it's seventy five percent pass rate.You've got to get above seventy five to pass.Yeah, it's 
*ALB:	That's quite high that, you know, seventy five percent!
*COR:	Well it's got to be ain't it?The office procedures, she said, is simple anyway, and yet, ethics and etiquette is a, she said, and your teacher works you that hard and it just drills in anyway!
*ALB:	No, but, seventy five percent is a high pass rate.
*JUN:	Well I don't know   (.) who she is that sends letters out to your nana, but she's bloody useless!She misses more words out than she gets in!And she just writes over them in, in pen!
*ALB:	 ((laugh)) 
*COR:	If it's her computer though, they might just   (.) erm, thingy it and change it to suit them.
*ALB:	Well it wouldn't be on   (.) word processor.
*COR:	You don't know.
*ALB:	Cos it's,the you're supposed to   (.) that's what it's for so you can check all your spellings.
*JUN:	A lot of them letters that come out are already done and you just delete
*COR:	Gonna say that's   (.) they're all on word processor that's what I'm saying.Eh!I got a pass, oh I got a distinction for, we did er   (.) like mock exam for   (.) word processing, I got a pass. ((laugh)) 
*JUN:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALB:	Whatsername 
*COR:	 (        ) 
*ALB:	her in, her   (.) the launderette were asking me   (.) er   (.) she was, she were on about I, ain't you got a job yet?I said, I think I'm too qualified to get a job!She said we  (.) she said, well aye, you might be.She says, int your   (.) daughter   (.) i er   (.) a nice girl?I said, well aye   (.) sometimes!
*COR:	 (        ) ?
*ALB:	She's seen you in there.She says what's sh what's she do?I said, oh she's at college.Oh!Really?I says, she says er   (.) what she's studying?I said, well she's er   (.) she's going in for medical secretary.She said, well where does she get her brains from?
*COR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALB:	I sa I said well who do you think?I says, I'm over- qualified for work, I says, and it looks like she's gonna end up that way if you're not careful!She says, oh!So   (.) she said, I think she's ever so pretty!I says, aye.Said, pity her manners don't blink er mannerisms don't match her    (.)  [laughing] looks  [] !
*COR:	Teresa's on about   (.) erm   (.) a she were asking me if anybody'd be interested into going on to higher er education after this?And I  (        ) 
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*COR:	college yet!
*ALB:	Yeah, but you get, you don't get no grant for that.
*COR:	What college? (        ) . But if it's only a part-time so you can actually work part-time that's the difference.
*ALB:	Yeah.
*COR:	Fantastic salary if you get qualified!
*ALB:	It's alright if you can get day release from your 
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	work   (.) to do it.That's what you want to be after, day release.
*COR:	Yeah.They're trying to make our course into a three day a week.Erm, nine till six at night.
*JUN:	It's a long day though.
*COR:	That's what I said.I mean,
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*COR:	you get   (.) we get a mental block after three    (.)  [laughing] three o'clock us  [] !
*ALB:	You do.
*COR:	I mean, doing shorthand for four hours a day, it's   (.) too much!It's far too much!
*JUN:	Well, just think, when you're working full-time you'd be working nine till five.
*COR:	I know, but it's different when you're concentrating 
*JUN:	Mind you 
*COR:	on studying and when you're concentrating on working.
*JUN:	Billy , er Billy  's   (.) one of Billy  's daughter-in-laws, she, she does it part-time.
*COR:	What, medical secretary?
*JUN:	Yeah.She's er
*COR:	Good money at part-time!
*JUN:	I know.That's what erm   (.) that's   (.) which one of them, who were it telling me?Er   (.) I don't know whether it   (.) were the young lad that comes in, or whether it was Jes that were telling me.
*ALB:	Mhm.
*JUN:	I can't imagine it being Jes.
*COR:	I think it were Jes what were telling you  (        ) .
*JUN:	Well it might have been Jes   (.) cos   (.) I don't know tha well they've got, I think they've got two children.And she were doing it full-time and then she went   (.) she had children and then she went part-time.But I don't think she's working  (        ) .
*COR:	That's one advantage of being medical secretary 
*JUN:	I think she's just had another baby or summat.
*COR:	cos if you get in a big organization like N H S, they provide a creche.
*ALB:	Mm.
*COR:	And thi I mean, you don't have to pay for the creche cos it comes in the, it's part of your
*ALB:	Well
*COR:	thingy.
*ALB:	part of your job innit?
*JUN:	It's like nurses at hospital innit?And they've got a hospital.
*COR:	Mm.Well that's the creche what you get into.
*JUN:	 (        ) .
*COR:	That's why a lot of people will go into medical secretary who have children.
*JUN:	Has Sue   (.) got a job at all?
*ALB:	 ((whistling)) 
*COR:	I don't know.She's not interested.
*ALB:	No.I think she'll be married shortly.
*JUN:	I can see her marrying him.
*COR:	 (        ) 
*JUN:	Yeah.But he's one of them lads where she'll never have owt, cos he don't do, he won't bloody work will he?
*COR:	Well he's doing taxis.
*JUN:	Yeah but 
*ALB:	Ah!It's only a pound a 
*JUN:	it's not  (        ) .
*ALB:	pigging hour!
*JUN:	He's on dole!
*ALB:	Well I'm gonna report him!Mm!
*COR:	And he, he's getting one parent benefit! ((laugh))  (.) He'll be getting all sorts for that young girl!
*JUN:	As soon as he gets a house   (.) she will leave home.
*ALB:	 ((cough))

*JUN:	Mick's got it.
*ALB:	Mm.
*JUN:	Did you clean that cupboard out I asked you to do?
*ALB:	No, I forgot.
*COR:	Which cupboard?
*JUN:	That one where oil's kept cos it   (.) I, the last time, I cleaned it out last time and put a   (.) some kitchen roll in in a plastic bag on top but it's all over again.
*ALB:	What it wants
*JUN:	Have you see how that   (.) unit's all cracked under sink?
*ALB:	Mm.
*JUN:	I can't understand why it's cracked like that.
*COR:	It's what?

*JUN:	It's all cracked!
*ALB:	Mhm.I, you don't know why it's cracked?

*ALB:	Yeah.
*JUN:	Nice aren't they?
*ALB:	Yeah.I think they're too alike but   (.) after saying that, they're quite nice   (.) and he made such a bugger of them ain't he?By putting 
*COR:	Put them in the wrong places ain't he?
*ALB:	I mean   (.) what he's do I, I know why he's done it.They didn't   (.) what he's done, he's thought well I'll just do that   (.) and incorporate the sink in it.
*JUN:	Yeah, but fancy putting sink up in corner like that!
*ALB:	Well
*JUN:	They can't put a worktop along that wall under window cos it cuts the unit off.
*ALB:	If it'd been me and I were gonna put it there, I would have put a window there   (.) to look out of.
*JUN:	Or a door there.
*ALB:	Yeah I know.
