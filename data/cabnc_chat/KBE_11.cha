        I mean we've got kids and the kids got to come first and the adults come second  •186945_187347•
*BET:	like Ann said . •187347_187438•
        It's all right for them because their kids can go on holiday with them so they've got no problems. •187438_187979•
        But because their kids can't go abroad  then they get a letter through to say like you know they are going on camp would they be interested. •187979_189162•
        Of course Ann sends off and says yeah. •189241_189359•
        But that's three hundred pounds for them to fit the bill. •189359_189566•
*BET:	Oh yeah! •189593_189616•

        That's all their spending money involved and their day trips off the lot. •190140_190557•
        She's got no worries. •190564_190651•
        Her and her old man stays at home and has a fortnight together. •190651_191115•
        Then they go at camping school or whatever wherever the school's going. •191115_191606•
        The kids do that. •191615_191726•
        And then they go on holiday with Ann and the old man. •191726_192085•
        And when they go on holiday with Ann and the old man they used to get through a hundred pounds a day and they go for a week. •192085_192564•
        That's seven hundred pounds like sometimes more. •192564_192821•
        But she said I don't mind because I would like to take my boat but I can't. •192828_193453•
        When we went abroad I know we've spent three or four grand when we're over there with the holiday as well like you know. •193454_193927•
        She said so it's got to be done really she said and I feel so sorry for them she says because even when they get older they still won't be able to go abroad. •193927_194778•

        Take the car out there. •195456_195664•
        They've got their own car. •195674_195751•
*BET:	Yeah but they go to  somewhere bloody they go to the same place every year and they have a real good time. •195758_196646•

*BET:	They only argue. •205803_205897•
        They don't fight they only argue but they can't fight cause of their ears. •205897_206287•
        And I think the boy suffers from asthma as well. •206293_206711•
*JUL:	Well there you are. •206762_206887•
        It's different with a boy and a girl cos •206887_207050•
*DAV:	You got your washing out mind you. •207050_207187•
*BET:	Because when •207187_207231•

        He must be older than thirteen. •207897_208127•

*BET:	Yeah. •208359_208383•
*BET:	Anyway they paid him I told you didn't I? •208391_208701•
        They paid him and the reason they ain't going to have nobody back there any more back to this firm cos  safety rules. •208702_209397•
        And erm she was saying that when he was there a bloke come round start giving them a little verbal. •209407_210179•
        She'd never had nothing in his ears to protect his ears. •210179_210410•
        So he's shouting it the boy like. •210410_210924•
        And of course the old man was there and he come over and grabbed the bloke by the throat and he said don't you ever shout at my son like that again. •210924_211618•
        Course he was frightened to death weren't he . •211655_211993•

        Well well that is why he don't need to put anything in his ears. •212578_213081•
        Because he can't hear nothing stupid. •213081_213188•
        Well he's still have to put it in his ears. •213188_213703•
        You're going to put your fucking eyes out. •213703_213897•
*BET:	Hmm. •213897_213926•
        I bet he got all upset. •213926_214152•
*BET:	Well everybody knew when they're up. •214152_214538•
