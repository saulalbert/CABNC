*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	Doopsey doopsey. •_•
        Normally you sit in er you know the trouble is as long as the police aren't here. •_•
        If the police are here they make you go right round and sit and wait. •_•
*JEA:	Oh I'll bet. •_•
*BRE:	This is sometimes it's a pain though it does Oh my God! •_•
*JEA:	Blimey! •_•
*BRE:	The trouble is if it's like this here it's like this in all of them. •_•
        That's the only thing. •_•
*JEA:	What shall what what do you think of doing? •_•
*BRE:	Well I'll wait here for a bit I mean you'll queue at the others if I turn round. •_•
        You see you get them. •_•

*BRE:	I think this will move Jean. •_•

        There's some movement. •_•
*BRE:	No it's cause it's it's it's only if the police come they'll they'll move you on. •_•
*JEA:	Yes yeah. •_•

*BRE:	Didn't shut up. •_•
*JEA:	Moving. •_•

*JEA:	Everybody else had the same idea. •_•
        Christmas shopping. •_•
*BRE:	You're right. •_•
        Imagine in December it would be absolutely murder. •_•
*JEA:	Oh erm totally. •_•
        Totally out of the question. •_•
*BRE:	Normally see as people as the cars come out the lights change. •_•
*JEA:	Hm mm mm. •_•
*BRE:	Obviously this early is that's actually come out. •_•
*JEA:	No no no. •_•

*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	Mention  ten o'clock she's got bags. •_•
*JEA:	Yes yes. •_•
*BRE:	I suppose a lot of people come in and they know exactly what want. •_•
*JEA:	Yes yes . •_•
*BRE:	I mean I can't even know what shops we want. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah •_•
*BRE:	Rather than the  •_•
*JEA:	And especially if they planned to go somewhere else today. •_•
*BRE:	There's a car coming out so they should change colour. •_•

*BRE:	Keep clear sign which he shouldn't have done. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	Even though they're coming out on the inside. •_•
        It's the outside they're coming out. •_•
        That's when the light changes. •_•
        It's like a magnet obviously see? •_•
*JEA:	On the outside? •_•
*BRE:	I wonder. •_•
        It's normally erm  •_•
*JEA:	Yeah •_•
*BRE:	Bit bit. •_•
        Normally there's load down stairs but obviously it's it works on the basis erm •_•
*JEA:	How do you get to the downstairs bit Brenda? •_•
        Do you know? •_•
*BRE:	Virtually it'll change now he's coming out. •_•

*BRE:	On this floor now you might somebody's just coming out you might be lucky but nine times out of ten it's it's  •_•

*BRE:	No    •_•
*JEA:	Very . •_•
*BRE:	I suppose we get out of line then  •_•
*JEA:	When you're expecting jam and it turns out to be marmalade it's quite a shock. •_•
        It's marmalade. •_•
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEA:	I think it is. •_•
        It's very sharp  Yeah thick cut marmalade. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
        my mother for oh God for thirty years forty years. •_•
        I mean she doesn't doesn't see a lot of her erm you know and but she and she was talking to her the other day because she doesn't like to get involved or say a lot but •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	she was saying that you know mother is  very evil and wicked. •_•
*JEA:	She knows? •_•
*BRE:	Oh yes she soon learnt. •_•
        She didn't want to say it but then in the end •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        It came out. •_•
*BRE:	It came out and she said you know she very the way she treats you •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •_•
*BRE:	She's just unbelievable. •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •_•
*BRE:	She just couldn't believe that's the way •_•
*JEA:	I mean your mother tries to torment you. •_•
*BRE:	It just doesn't sink in any more. •_•
        I mean it's just you know that  gone wrong and it doesn't •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	I could do with a couple of those. •_•
        I like those stands with the marble tops. •_•
*JEA:	Hm hm  •_•
*BRE:	a lot  •_•
*JEA:	Hm mm. •_•
*BRE:	And they've got ever  •_•
*JEA:	Hm. •_•
        Hm.  's furniture is very much more practical than a lot of the traditional stuff that's sold in the shops at vast expense isn't it? •_•
*BRE:	Mm   it's dished up in that  •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm.. •_•
*BRE:	This tea and that little bit gives you any inclination how to go about that  Oh I see look. •_•
        Department numbers and how you spend it so you must have to fill this card in I should think  The only the only department is the cosmetics that's not  we'll ask when we get there. •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •_•
*BRE:	It's not half past ten already is it? •_•
*JEA:	Hm. •_•
        I was just thinking. •_•
        Returning from Stone Market. •_•
        I had a taxi at twenty past nine. •_•
        I arrived at the station in good time for the train but I didn't have to wait more than three or four minutes and I was in London at ten to eleven. •_•
        That's not bad going is it? •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
*JEA:	At Liverpool Street. •_•
*BRE:	Leave the  from the journey. •_•
*JEA:	That was the next bit. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
        Journeys are funny. •_•
        You'd think because we live on you know Woking is on top of us but it's but it I notice that it was quite you know a time. •_•
        By the time we sat down here I thought well considering that we came in by car door to door practically and that when the driving wasn't  public transport it it's taken quite a time to get into  •_•
*BRE:	It's we actually got car locked didn't we? •_•
        We left home at half past nine. •_•
        So it's taken an hour just to drop her off, Get parked and get in here. •_•
        It's taken an hour. •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm mm. •_•
*BRE:	Like you say you could sort of travel into London in that hour couldn't you? •_•
*JEA:	Yes yes strange isn't it? •_•
*BRE:	Strange how it works. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Interesting to see people's bags   •_•
*JEA:	Hm . •_•
*BRE:	Inside of that everything else. •_•
        There's some  the baby in the highchair smashed it  •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •_•
*JEA:	Now unless you're out with your husband I can't see the point of bringing your baby out on Christmas shopping  •_•
*BRE:	It's too crowded for the kid isn't it? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        mm mm. •_•
*BRE:	Mind you some people I suppose have got no option. •_•
        That they have to. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah  My preferred option would be to leave the chap at home with the baby. •_•
        That's what I did when Ann was small  But then Jerry wasn't interested in shopping anyway. •_•
        He quite liked to leave it to me. •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
        Rather be home and let you get on with it. •_•
*JEA:	Hm hm hm. •_•
*BRE:	I think you get you get either a man who really likes shopping don't you? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Or ones that always just totally dislike it. •_•
*JEA:	Yes  That's  engaged to. •_•
        He loved shopping. •_•
*BRE:	Really? •_•
*JEA:	Woolworths Marks and Spencers  Discount Stores  all the absolutely. •_•
*BRE:	What about the guy that she's seeing at the moment? •_•
*JEA:	Oh I don't know. •_•
*BRE:	Don't know? •_•
*JEA:	I have only met him twice. •_•
        By the operation of sod's law I wouldn't mind betting that this nice old man will turn out to be a lovely companion and will treat me as I like men to treat me. •_•
        With great respect and kindness and fun and then I will sell the house and the great •_•
*BRE:	And they'll say that's a good scoop. •_•
        Getting a  out isn't it? •_•
*JEA:	Mm  •_•
*UNK:	Sausage roll. •_•
*BRE:	just a bit sort of all right. •_•
        Dave's coming over this afternoon. •_•
        I don't think he'll . •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        What was he coming over for? •_•
*BRE:	For the suit for Liz. •_•
*JEA:	Oh yes of course. •_•
*BRE:	The  in all satin. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	But I should think knowing him he'll know what it's like. •_•
        He normally parks down by the old A A. •_•
*JEA:	Oh yes •_•
*BRE:	And walks in  Do you ever sort this coronation soup at home. •_•
*JEA:	Yes I have made it. •_•
        It's easy. •_•
*BRE:	Is it just like a mayonnaise sauce. •_•
*JEA:	Hm. •_•
        Yeah  •_•
*UNK:	Number ten? •_•
*UNK:	Her. •_•
*UNK:	Number ten? •_•
*BRE:	What time did you tell Marge? •_•
        Or did you not tell her a time? •_•
*JEA:	I said fivish. •_•
*BRE:	Oh. •_•
*JEA:	That was right wasn't it? •_•
*BRE:	Hm. •_•
*BRE:	Blimey that's  •_•
*JEA:	Hm. •_•
*BRE:	That's  you got Debenhams receipt there. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	I'd like to see what less we got off. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	It is in in there. •_•
*JEA:	Yes I in with the Debs card yes. •_•
*BRE:	When you pick your Debs card up. •_•
*JEA:	You'll find your Debs Card. •_•
*BRE:	That's it. •_•
        Oh no their till receipt  •_•
*JEA:	This is the one isn't it? •_•
        Connect Card ha ha ha ha. •_•
        It's my ability to leave lose these things is is wonderful. •_•
        Matchless. •_•
*UNK:	Sorry. •_•
*BRE:	That black top. •_•
        That sweatshirt top that I got  which was seventeen ninety nine. •_•
*JEA:	You got that for •_•
*BRE:	Thirteen pounds fifty five  erm  •_•
*UNK:	Yes please. •_•
*BRE:	Thirty two pounds off. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        That's marvellous  •_•
*BRE:	So it should would have been a hundred and forty five. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	God there's a hell of a difference isn't there? •_•
*JEA:	Yes it is. •_•
*BRE:	But the only thing awkward I suppose about that is the fact you've got to erm carry it around. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	All right I mean all right she did so that one of the guys would perhaps carry it around for you. •_•
*JEA:	You don't like to ask them  •_•
*BRE:	But you don't like to because of the fact  you know he'll be erm sort of lugging it around and you'd feel you'd actually have to sort of hurry him up wouldn't you? •_•
        You know hurry up •_•
*JEA:	Yes yes •_•
*BRE:	because  •_•
*JEA:	When I  have been entertaining Shirley and Terry Jones doing an evening meal on a Saturday or a Sunday and sometimes both to help Shirley when she was getting into the run of going back to work  I found that one of the cheapest of dinner party deserts was lemon meringue pie. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	And everybody likes it. •_•
*BRE:	It always goes down well doesn't it? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Christmas time whenever. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	And to take the hex off it  I  grate the lemons the day before and wrap the grated rind in cling film. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah you do that don't you? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	I know that one you made last time you were down. •_•
        There's no waste in our house . •_•
*JEA:	That's right I No. •_•
*BRE:	What's  having. •_•
        Having turkey for Christmas or? •_•
*JEA:	Hm? •_•
*BRE:	They having turkey at Christmas or don't they let you know? •_•
*JEA:	I don't know what they'll have. •_•
        You see Mary Ann and Mitch are vegetarian  •_•
*BRE:	Are they going for dinner as well at Richard? •_•
*JEA:	Oh I think so. •_•
        Yes I think it's going to be a proper family Christmas. •_•
*BRE:	The trouble with that if you turn it down •_•
*JEA:	Then that would be awful. •_•
*BRE:	Even this is probably this one year you could probably done with •_•
*JEA:	I could have done with saving some. •_•
        I would've liked to have looked after me and kept an eye on the rest with Paul. •_•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Everybody. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BRE:	It's fairly typical though isn't it? •_•
        One year you could do with  •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm mm . •_•
*BRE:	staying around  •_•
*JEA:	You mean as it is? •_•
        I think that Neil was a bit of a sensitive area. •_•
*BRE:	Hm. •_•
*JEA:	You know I'm I'm spending money and time on him that really I suppose in theory I would be spending on my own grandchildren. •_•
        However I take the attitude that in modern times people don't people are not obliged •_•
*BRE:	The thing is who else •_•
*UNK:	All right? •_•
*JEA:	to feel by duty as it were that they ought to take notice of their immediate family. •_•
        John and Maryanne are capable of financially supporting themselves. •_•
        So I don't worry about the money aspect. •_•
        And in every other way psychologically emotionally morally they are able to look after themselves. •_•
        Neil isn't. •_•
*BRE:	I think  and I think that's that's saying  you can't pick your families. •_•
        You can pick your friends. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        It is true. •_•
*BRE:	So true. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Because •_•
*JEA:	You found it so. •_•
*BRE:	You can do without that hassle and at least if you've a good relationship you got a good . •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •_•
*BRE:	At least there's not a lot of chance to have hassles. •_•
*JEA:	No no. •_•
*BRE:	But that's how relationships should be. •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm. •_•
        It is one of the great arguments for the old fashioned sort of religion. •_•
        Which you could turn you could legitimately turn to people and say  why are you leaning on me so hard for all this support? •_•
        You ought to be reading your bible saying your prayers going to church and getting in touch with the boss. •_•
        That's why I laughed when they were said Terry Waite would need counselling. •_•
        I bet that Terry Waite was praying his head off and he'd memorised masses of the bible which he would be reciting to himself probably said he thought two o'clock every afternoon I'll remember what I can of Book of Isaiah you know. •_•
        I don't suppose he needed any counselling. •_•
        He'd do better counselling other people. •_•
*BRE:	That's right. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        Because I mean he's he's er needs it all. •_•

*BRE:	Hm. •_•

*JEA:	And that. •_•
*BRE:	And that one. •_•
        You can have them all. •_•
*JEA:	The heavy  doing them justice. •_•
*BRE:	isn't it? •_•
        So is Jackie spending Christmas on her own or you don't know? •_•
*JEA:	No I think that they'll probably go down to the Mum and  •_•
*BRE:	Have they made any sort of new friends where they are? •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	No? •_•
*JEA:	There aren't any people where they are. •_•
*BRE:	Aren't they? •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        They are next door neighbours who I think are very nice but I don't think that Jackie and Nev have a lot in common with. •_•
        That's one house that adjoins them and then a little further on it's a lane. •_•
        It's about as wide as this Brenda. •_•
*BRE:	Well what do they need? •_•
        What what area is it? •_•
*JEA:	It's called Fenn Lane •_•
*BRE:	How much is it? •_•
*JEA:	And it's in between St Mary and Needham market. •_•
*BRE:	And how far is it from you? •_•
*JEA:	About a between ten and fifteen minutes drive I suppose. •_•
        Ten minutes perhaps. •_•
*BRE:	Oh it's not far. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	Still doing her kitchen job? •_•
*JEA:	Yes and she phoned me and she said I feel as though I dropped out of the bottom of the world she said. •_•
        You know I just don't see anybody. •_•
        Well of course you're working on Monday. •_•
        You see she used to have Mondays to herself and I would often go round on a Monday afternoon and we could we could talk. •_•
        But that's gone and I said I can't run in at half past five when you get home from school and chat to you because Nev will be coming at six and I don't want to be there all that often when he's there erm  it's just you know it's just happened. •_•
        And I also thought to myself and I'm probably going to move a lot further away than Fenn Lane. •_•
*BRE:	She doesn't I mean she doesn't bother that much now does she? •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	I mean I think  been up  •_•
*JEA:	She can with a true friend. •_•
        I'm very sorry for her because I think she and Nev have made a really a quite ferocious mess of their lives. •_•
        Nev never intended to be slaving away doing kitchen fitting. •_•
        He wanted to wood sculpture that was his idea in •_•
*BRE:	And slow down a bit didn't he ? •_•
*JEA:	Yes yes. •_•
*BRE:	Cause he's almost  •_•
*JEA:	He's on the gallop and he looks very old and worn. •_•
*BRE:	Does he? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        And she never wanted to return to full time teaching. •_•
        It's providential for her that she's got a job that she's very good at and that she enjoys. •_•
        In an extremely nice school. •_•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	And my handkerchief such as it is if she is  no. •_•
        I'll have to go to the loo or something to get some paper I shan't worry about. •_•
        Such a perishing bore  Oh bless you thank you very much. •_•
*BRE:	Knew I had a   I hope to get it. •_•
*JEA:	Hm mm. •_•
*BRE:	And Jackie's •_•
*JEA:	That's right and who knows. •_•
        When we go into Smith's in Woking I've got myself  •_•
*BRE:	Busy  •_•
*BRE:	I might see something for Jackie. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	It's only two o'clock. •_•
*JEA:	I'm amazed. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
        And I really feel like going back putting my feet up and chatting to you a bit more because we haven't chatted enough have we? •_•
*BRE:	we have always got the bulk  we are only going to be in Woking an hour. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        We haven't chatted enough  •_•
*BRE:	will you  the er tapes . •_•
        You really feel that we've really put into it and really done well haven't we? •_•
*JEA:	Oh I couldn't have done a quarter of it. •_•
*BRE:	And I think I'm left with two people and that's it. •_•
*JEA:	I couldn't have a quarter of it. •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
*JEA:	I'd have dithered and I'd have got tired and I'd gone off of  •_•
*BRE:	Oh well I think I well I'll come back off holiday •_•
*JEA:	That's right I'll do it again and I'll have another go at it. •_•
*BRE:	Well I could have spent the whole week. •_•
        I just I just I could have spent five afternoons and it was finished. •_•
        I could have done more . •_•
        I don't think I would have done. •_•
        Cause I work at  cause a couple of weeks ago I thought I God I'll make an effort. •_•
        I thought •_•
*JEA:	I think it makes a very big difference knowing that  •_•
*BRE:	Yeah  without having to think too hard. •_•
        And still you make sure I mean you know for that what I've spent. •_•
*JEA:	Oh it was well worth •_•
*JEA:	Oh it was well C •_•
*BRE:	It's got everybody. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah it was within you budget and you've done the lot. •_•
        I went over budget but then I expected I would. •_•
        Cause for one thing I was buying for more. •_•
*BRE:	Yes. •_•
        You know did you I mean none of us realised you had thirty odd to buy  •_•
*JEA:	But I remember when you said that that last year •_•
*BRE:	Fifty odd. •_•
        I think fifty three. •_•
        Yeah •_•
*JEA:	And I think the year before years before I've had something like forty or thirty five. •_•
        In what you might call quiet years. •_•
*BRE:	Funny those  in Smiths for two pounds off are lovely. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	And the ones we saw in Marks and all that were nothing were they? •_•
*JEA:	And it pays to travel about  You see the problem with Jackie and Nev is always been that they can't believe that you can get things in a place like W H Smiths that will that will do very nicely as a Christmas present. •_•
        They tend to go always to the top of the •_•
*BRE:	But it doesn't pay •_•
*JEA:	Oh yes yes. •_•
        They go a a Medici shop or Athena or whatever and they're looking at the best. •_•
*BRE:	Well you can't afford to  •_•
*JEA:	See Mary Ann and Mitch are giving up on erm buying Christmas presents because she says you're buying things for people and they  everybody's  therefore I think that tokeny things are the best. •_•
        And that's what I've bought this year. •_•
        Tokeny things  •_•
*BRE:	And is that is that what she's doing? •_•
*JEA:	They're buying disposable presents like giving theatre vouchers and erm I don't know what else but she said disposable things that people can have some fun with . •_•
*BRE:	Good idea isn't it ? •_•
        Mm. •_•
*JEA:	And what I'm giving is just something nice in the spirit of Christmas but it hasn't broken my bank or my back. •_•
*BRE:	Things done in one. •_•
        How these people go week after week after week looking for bargain I mean I mean we picked up some bargains today but how you can go week I mean it's okay yes  but when you're Christmas shopping you can't go for  because it's just  •_•
*JEA:	No no you can't  •_•
*BRE:	Because it's just so I mean that C and A is so busy all the it gets it gets so claustrophobic . •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm yeah . •_•
*BRE:	Look at this traffic coming in now. •_•
        And I think the way we did it we marked down the three shops we wanted to do and make sure you do those three shops. •_•
*JEA:	I don't think that even though by  next year I would be a bit better of in the sense that I should have sold my house bought something cheaper and have some capital invested so that I have a little extra monthly income. •_•
        I should be living in some where that's cheaper to run. •_•
*BRE:	You don't know you might end up with this this little old chap you're with. •_•
*JEA:	Oh I wouldn't mind but I wouldn't marry anybody  •_•
*BRE:	You might live with him. •_•
*JEA:	Mm mm on and off. •_•
        You don't know do you? •_•
        You don't know. •_•
*BRE:	I mean then yes you can buy a smaller even more so then. •_•
*JEA:	Well I would. •_•
        I I mean I intend to keep my own roof whatever. •_•
        Neil can be in it and look after it. •_•
        Yes erm  but I don't think I'll ever again buy expensive Christmas presents in the way that I did in the past. •_•
        Spending forty and fifty pounds a head on •_•
*BRE:	A head? •_•
*JEA:	for mm •_•
*BRE:	Isn't it? •_•
        Like the gents' track suits and •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        No I can't er I can't think of myself as doing that again. •_•
*BRE:	I think it's it's like those candies there's lots of little things you know which people are buying. •_•
        It's like those bags I mean I mean I'd go  if they bought me one of those bags. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	You know if er people don't oh no they're only one twenty five and you can't buy someone that. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	But it's not not not the issue of it is it? •_•
*JEA:	No no it isn't. •_•
*BRE:	Huge  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        home people Brenda and I thought Guildford between us. •_•
        Yesterday we bought Camberley. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	Oh yes. •_•
*BRE:	thing we got so many of each  yes. •_•
*JEA:	A bit cold. •_•
*BRE:	Mm  Oh ooh   •_•
*BRE:	Well I think that's a good idea though that he's got boxes from Marks. •_•
        I bet they'll be a real seller  those boxes which  No wonder they call them underwear boxes. •_•
*JEA:	Oh yes! •_•
*BRE:	If you had to buy a box then the tissue paper then the bow  •_•
*JEA:	Oh I know . •_•
        The time consumed in getting it all in. •_•
*BRE:	All I would do with it just to fancy it up you know to buy some of that pink sheering stuff •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	and curl it. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	and just tie it on the top. •_•
        Yeah  You've saved on wrapping paper •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	I've got to get some petrol  I have to get at   When did you ask me in Guildford  B H S now? •_•
*JEA:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	You said it was for a B H S . •_•
*JEA:	That's right. •_•
        Erm  I can't  It'll come to me  •_•
*BRE:	I like how many of those tops you got on? •_•
*JEA:	I've only got this one. •_•
        I had a cream one and it got wrecked by going I think Neil put it in the wash with one of his black T-shirts. •_•
        It came out all  •_•
*BRE:	Really it's really flattering top. •_•
*JEA:	It is. •_•
        It's very soft and easy to wear and •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
        Erm  •_•
*JEA:	Well I don't know erm they're warm. •_•
        They are warm and but it's colour I don't know whether I  perhaps if I saw cream again this year I might buy it but erm I'm not sure that I want to when this deep orangy colour. •_•
        I bought a red one in a different style but the same sort of fabric in Benthalls. •_•
        Do you remember? •_•
        When I bought that black and white check skirt •_•
*BRE:	Oh yeah . •_•
*JEA:	I bought a red blouse  •_•
*BRE:	You worn that ? •_•
*JEA:	Yes but the sleeve  the wrong side. •_•
        I'm picking the sleeve head and trying to get it together. •_•
        And I would have got it together if I'd had time  had gone out to work instead of for days on end being unemployed and sitting and telling me about Karen. •_•
        Honestly Brenda you pay for being nice. •_•
*BRE:	Oh but he he said the same things  He goes on and  •_•
*JEA:	Of course he does. •_•
        He goes over and over yeah. •_•
        Doesn't listen to a word I say. •_•
        Like the woman's no good   Of course I told  some things about Wendy. •_•
        But it really made yet more hair fall off the top of his bald head. •_•
        I said fairly bluntly. •_•
        I said look a working woman needs a working man to help support herself and her children. •_•
        I said no nobody is going to be able these days woman not be able to support herself on twenty hours a week which is what Karen does putting out bread in the Asda. •_•
*BRE:	Is she the original one then. •_•
*JEA:	She's the original one. •_•
*BRE:	She's not the one that was coming around with the baby? •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        It was Michelle who was coming around with the baby. •_•
*BRE:	That's right. •_•
*JEA:	And I found two pairs of Michelle's knickers after that and I didn't know what I . •_•
        Now I don't know how they managed this dear because  she was coming round in the day with little Donna with her and I was around and there you are you see. •_•
        Indeed love will find a way. •_•
        Anyway erm I said to him look. •_•
        A women needs a man to support her. •_•
        I said mark the chap that she's got at the moment is taking her out to discos and things and she'll find that he doesn't really want to kick in and help to support her. •_•
        I said she she might well come back to you. •_•
        I said she's tried to keep you on a string just in case she didn't land the next fish. •_•
        He looked horrified. •_•
        You know as far as he's concerned it's all love and glamour. •_•
*BRE:	How come she took him back then? •_•
        She didn't want . •_•
*JEA:	Well I think that she was trying to keep him dangling so that she'd have somebody to fall back on if she didn't land another man. •_•
*BRE:	But wasn't she sort of playing around with another man? •_•
*JEA:	She is now. •_•
        She is now yes. •_•
        She's now carrying on. •_•
*BRE:	What did he say? •_•
*JEA:	Erm he's seen the man going in and out of the house. •_•
        She's told him that she's got this other man. •_•
*BRE:	Cause I can remember him saying before he used to drive round to spy. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Well there is another man and she has told Paul that frankly she's lapping up the attention. •_•
        He's taking her out for meals and they're having a good time together you know. •_•
        Quite strange but as soon as he's paid for for the goods and got the goods the chap's going to go off looking for another. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        Cause he doesn't want to stay with her. •_•
        But I've told Paul that if he goes back to Karen and  you know takes some his things out. •_•
        Then he takes all of his things out and himself and he never comes back. •_•
*BRE:	Is he is he  •_•
*JEA:	I've had this twice and each time it's been upheaval because he's got a lot of goods which had to moved in shoe horned in moved peoples belongings out of one cupboard into another. •_•
        And the second time round it's been perfect for him because he bought from Karen's house the Hoover and the saucepans and everything that was his. •_•
        Everything that belonged to him. •_•
        But he said that before  I said why was Michelle able to come in between you and Karen. •_•
        He said well Karen had been getting moody. •_•
        He said Karen is getting . •_•
        Paul is boring. •_•
        She's told Paul that he's boring. •_•
        What Paul needs is this little girl who doesn't care whether a man's a bit boring. •_•
*BRE:	Yes. •_•
        Because I can imagine Paul being sort of a homely chap. •_•
*JEA:	He is. •_•
*BRE:	If he gets the right sort •_•
*JEA:	He is. •_•
*BRE:	league with someone who can put up with his sort of  •_•
*JEA:	quietness and  •_•
*BRE:	conversation cause he likes to chat and this. •_•
        But I mean  •_•
*JEA:	Yes yes yes He's a pleasant enough chap. •_•
*BRE:	He is isn't he? •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        But he is not erm a playboy. •_•
        He's not going to spend money on  like Pete  was forever buying Pam  cheap jewellery from Ratners and erm things of that nature. •_•
*BRE:	Did he ever get back with her? •_•
*JEA:	Well she tells me that she's going to throw Shaun out because Shaun is boring er put er Shaun she has no respect for she says because he hasn't got a job. •_•
        He won't get a job he won't work. •_•
        And she said to me what did I think of the idea of taking Pete back. •_•
        Once they were properly divorced taking him back just as er a lover. •_•
        And I said that sounds to me to be a very good idea. •_•
        I said then you're not at his mercy because anybody to whose at Pete's mercy will suffer. •_•
        He's got a very nasty streak. •_•
        He's got a nasty snide way of putting things. •_•
*BRE:	Has he? •_•
*JEA:	Oh yes nasty. •_•
*BRE:	But he's he's quite fond of her isn't he? •_•
*JEA:	Oh he adores her. •_•
        Oh yes he wants her back. •_•
        And I said she said I you see I know him. •_•
        I said there's a lot to be said for a chap that you inside out know his ways and how to cope with them but never ever put yourself at his mercy  by marrying him. •_•
        And the house will be hers you see when they're properly divorced. •_•
        It will be in her name. •_•
        So if he starts coming the old soldier she can bung him out. •_•
*BRE:	Did she bail herself out in the end with over her money situation. •_•
*JEA:	Oh yeah I went guarantor for that. •_•
*BRE:	Oh you had did you have to pay the money? •_•
        Because you •_•
*JEA:	No no she managed I told her on pain of death not to tell Pete that I was backing •_•
