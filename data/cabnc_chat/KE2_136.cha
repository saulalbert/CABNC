*TER:	Good gracious! [reading newspaper] Times may be tough but it seems we're taking less care of our money than ever before.According to the Royal Mint around twenty three thousand pounds of coins a day disappear!
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Some is taken home by tourist and some is lost in the street and down the backs of sofas.But amazingly we are just as careless when it comes to bank notes.Last November the old style fiver with the Duke of Wellington was withdrawn yet there are still sixty million missing  [] !
*MAR:	You can understand sort of you know,th the coppers and that that   (.) as they say get down behind sofas and what have you   (.) but erm   (.) it is quite amazing   (.) where notes get to isn't it?
*TER:	Sixty million's a lot isn't it?
*MAR:	Yes.
*TER:	That's quite interesting that!There's a mutilated notes department as well that you can   (.) send really   (.) screwed up notes to.
*MAR:	Yeah.Haven't you heard before about that then?But how I know, that's what somebody told me. (        ) to send   (.) some notes in  (        ) 
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	you know, put them in the washing machine.They   (.) they have   (        ) in there   (.) and they take out bank notes and coins from the washing machine.But, so long as you   (        ) first.Erm
*TER:	Oh that's right, well the they detail here exactly what you need to have.
*MAR:	But, you know, that's how I knew there was a department somewhere because they do   (        ) 
*TER:	I think   (.) just, if you've got the number you can take it into an ordinary bank.
*MAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Amazing! (.)  [sighing] Yeah  [] ! (.) Yes, I know how we got talking to this   (.) girl in the Post Office cos I erm   (.) I asked her for some stamps as well, you see, I wanted some   (.) cos I happen to be sending stuff of for Germany   (.) tomorrow.And I haven't got any second class stamps so I thought well I'll get five   (.) and it was, you know, dealing with that that erm
*MAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	it cropped up.
*MAR:	You didn't say anything about   (        ) school   (        ) did you?
*TER:	Oh no , no!
*MAR:	 (        ) But, I mean that's why   (.) Victor came away wasn't it?
*TER:	That's right.
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	She was really upset about it.
*MAR:	Bet you were surprised to hear Monsignor  on the phone weren't you?
*TER:	I was , yeah!
*MAR:	I've I, when I heard you saying   (.) you recognized his voice I thought to myself well perhaps he's sort of inviting you to er, whatever!
*TER:	Oh aye!
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) and they were going to be here.
*TER:	Yeah , I never thought of that.No, I, it was just that I, you know, I mean he   (.) I recognized the voice really as he spoke.
*MAR:	Yes, distinctive.
*TER:	Got a very
*MAR:	Oh yes! (        ) 
*TER:	very distinctive voice hasn't he? (.) It's still only half past nine so that's not bad!
*MAR:	What?
*TER:	I said it's still only half past nine, so that's not bad!
*MAR:	Have you gotta get any milk   (.) this morning?
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	I'm gonna put this French   (.) this is a little French thing that soma er   (.) we brought back  (        ) .
*TER:	Oh! (.) Oh you'll have to charge them francs for it.
*MAR:	But then we'd be looking for   (.) francs.And shra , oh you said francs didn't you?
*TER:	Yeah. (.) Yes, I, the birds don't half have a go at those nuts don't they?
*MAR:	Look at them, one, two, three   (.) four, five on there!
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	You know?
*TER:	Yeah.Yes there are.
*MAR:	And the one on the left.
*TER:	Yeah , that's right!
*MAR:	And one there.
*TER:	One, two   (.) three, yeah.
*MAR:	There's one at the back on that erm
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	hanging one.And one on the other one.
*TER:	They're so busy around here!I mean, in the trees as well aren't they?They're always
*MAR:	Yeah.Perhaps may it is because we've got all these trees I mean
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	 (        ) was saying when she lived out at erm    (.)  (        ) cos I mean there were trees about there where their hou 
*TER:	That's right.
*MAR:	But the nuts didn't come to her house. (.) Where has that come from?
*TER:	Where's what come from?
*MAR:	I'll put it on there.I can put it on there.It's alright! ((laugh))  (.) Well I knew I had caps on all the others.
*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	But I had one over, as it were.
*TER:	Suppose I mustn't really, I'm reading this morning.Let's have a look at that. (.) Well you always thought about going to the Beefeater a bu  (.) really I suppose it might be better to go today than tomorrow.Cos today   (.) Lucy will be here but   (.) tomorrow   (.) might be more difficult.
*MAR:	Well
*TER:	Erm   (.) because I wouldn't sort of finished till   (.) quarter pa
