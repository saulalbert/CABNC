Gavin (PS0BA)              [553] Mm.
                           [554] Dear.
Sue (PS0BB)                [555] This is probably better though, because that
                           tells you ... shows you what's on Anglia television
                           and, that one's got Central.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [556] Oh, What's On T V?
                           [557] ... Tells you what's on Anglia but not
                           Central?
Sue (PS0BB)                [558] Well it does tell you for Central but it, up
                           there.

                           Central.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [560] Oh it's a Central only as well.
Sue (PS0BB)                [561] What?
                           [562] Anglia we do , I mean what do we want Northern
                           Anglian region for?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [563] Every pa , everything says that.
Sue (PS0BB)                [564] Does it?

                           [647] ... I'd forgotten all about it actually Gav.

                           gunge!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [laugh]
Sue (PS0BB)                [659] Cos it's stopped leaking.

Unknown speaker (KC6PSUNK) [661] Do you realise that the people on this table
                           gonna realise ... oh just [...] clean it out.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [662] Maybe that's why they're doing it.
                           [663] One that the
Sue (PS0BB)                [664] This survey says men does the cooking.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [665] Yeah, that th ... they've dra drawn a
                           conclusion that men actually do cook a lot.
                           [666] ... Babe!
                           [667] You know damn well that you prefer cooking

Sue (PS0BB)                [669] It's not so much that, it's that I prefer my
                           cooking to your cooking.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [670] Well there you go!
                           [671] That's the answer to why you cook more than I
                           do.
                           [672] And I'll remember that next time you tell me
                           to cook!
Sue (PS0BB)                [laugh]
Gavin (PS0BA)              [673] And when I don't want to, I'll just turn round
                           and say
Sue (PS0BB)                [674] No!
                           [675] And I like ... I like to cook. [...]

                           [680] Not really.
                           [681] You've not cooked
Gavin (PS0BA)              [682] Yes, but when you do it's very nice.
Sue (PS0BB)                [683] In fact, I might just have to do a bit before

Sue (PS0BB)                [688] We might not.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [689] I know, but if we do we'll be fat as fuck
                           won't we?
Sue (PS0BB)                [690] We don't have to go.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [691] Yeah, but it'll be nice to though ... if
                           everyone's going.
                           [692] Eh?
Sue (PS0BB)                [693] Aha.

Gavin (PS0BA)              [710] I sometimes wonder that myself!
                           [711] Especially
Sue (PS0BB)                [712] Ah!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [713] after listening to these tapes back.
Sue (PS0BB)                [714] Ah!
                           [715] Really!

Gavin (PS0BA)              [717] I listened to one in car and yo , your like
                           that again, you snapped!
                           [718] It's when I said, oh ... I wish occasionally
                           we, you know, cook straight away instead sitting
                           around.
                           [719] I don't sit around!
                           [720] I'm always first in the kitchen!
Sue (PS0BB)                [721] Well I am!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [722] Yes, but look at you!
                           [723] It's the way you speak to people.
Sue (PS0BB)                [724] Erm
Gavin (PS0BA)              [725] You speak to me like the stepbrother speaks to
                           ... all the family.
                           [726] As though you just shit on his head and rubbed
                           it in with your foot or something, you know!
Sue (PS0BB)                [727] Very good Gavin!
                           [728] ... It's how Jane speaks to everybody.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [729] Yeah, it is.
                           [730] Your Jane reminds me of Jay.
                           [731] She turns round and you say something in then
                           goes ... you know ... with absolutely no [...]
                           whatsoever ... and she turns round and goes like
                           that like Jay does.
Sue (PS0BB)                [732] I know she does!

                           deaf.
                           [1463] All this pain inside.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1464] Well let it worry about it babe, I have, get
                           them quite often.

Gavin (PS0BA)              [1467] They have heart attacks though.
Sue (PS0BB)                [1468] I'll give you one!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1469] What?
Sue (PS0BB)                [1470] I could give you one.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1471] You what?
Sue (PS0BB)                [1472] Said, I could give you one.
                           [1473] I don't mean a heart attack.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1474] [laughing] Gonna say [] !
*** 21 (Tape 056304) ***
Unknown speaker (KC6PSUNK) [1475] See the football last night?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1476] No.
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1477] Leeds have got a be the unluckiest team!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1478] Have they?
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1479] That was a penalty that was when Chapman
                           [...] .
                           [1480] Well actually, Barnes didn't.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1481] I don't know, I I think he went and talked to
                           Stuart er intimidate him I think it's sa
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1482] Yeah, well it's that's a penalty ain't it
                           Gav?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1483] I don't know if it is mate cos I, I do it all
                           the time cos yo ya , a lot of it is jumping to
                           intimidate.
                           [1484] That's what Graham Sharp does, he jumps
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1485] Knock [...] out of goal.
                           [1486] The thing was Chapman ... was in front of him
                           weren't he?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1487] I, I wouldn't honestly say that it, he did it
                           deliberately to be honest.
                           [1488] I think it'd be very harsh to give a penalty.
                           [1489] I don't know.
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1490] You see that film last night?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1491] What?
                           [1492] Does it say in the paper what's wrong with
                           him this morning.
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1493] Broke his arm or his wrist.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1494] You saw him, as he went down, if you looked
                           at it his wrist
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1495] He

Saranne (PS0BF)            [1536] Well I thought I'd do something with it

Saranne (PS0BF)            [1538] but it's just gone out my head completely.

Richard (PS0BC)            [1619] We picked three other C D's afterwards and
                           they all worked.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1620] Mine does that mate.
                           [1621] Don't worry about it!

                           with a soft cloth, breath on it and wipe it down

Richard (PS0BC)            [1623] I thought it was pretty er, ironic that we

Richard (PS0BC)            [1626] C D wasn't working.
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1627] I tell you what it could be is that ... cos
                           you gotta know that C D's use laser to read it
Richard (PS0BC)            [1628] We thi , we , I think it's the C D because er
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1629] It will be mate, cos my er ... C D used to do

                           [1789] I say no, I say it would have been harsh to
                           give it.
Richard (PS0BC)            [1790] Yeah, I think it would.
Nick (PS0BJ)               [1791] [...] a definite penalty!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1792] I say, he went up just to erm ... frighten

Nick (PS0BJ)               [1798] Rich, the fact is, he should have put it in

                           they get an interview.
                           [1959] Seems a [...] when you're going for a bloody
                           job!
                           [1960] You know, cos they're wanting another part-
                           timer to do seventeen hours.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1961] Oh yeah.
Sue (PS0BB)                [1962] And men don't particularly want that.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [...]
Sue (PS0BB)                [1963] Oh yeah.
                           [1964] I said somebody like a middle-aged woman
                           would be best who's got grown up children at work
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1965] Yeah.
Sue (PS0BB)                [1966] and this, this guy came for it ... and,
                           obviously Lynn can't say, we don't want to take a ma
                           man on it'll be ... sex discrimination.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1967] Yeah.
Sue (PS0BB)                [1968] But it won't be suitable, I mean, one he's
                           bloody crap!
                           [1969] And erm ... [...] , it's only seventeen
                           hours, it's four hours a day ... so that's why it
                           would suit somebody who's married.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1970] Is he a nice bloke?
Sue (PS0BB)                [1971] No!
                           [1972] He's just stupid!
                           [1973] He's, he's already come in for one form ...
                           put it, he's obviously filled one form in, he came
                           up and he said can I have an application form for
                           that job in the window, so I gave him one ... and he
                           went, oh well I've just filled one in.
                           [1974] I thought ... I thought, did he just say can
                           I have ... can I have an application form or here's
                           an application form?
                           [1975] And I looked at him, and he went ... [...] ,
                           no I made a mistake on it.
                           [1976] So he sto , do you know where the two tills
                           are downstairs do you?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1977] Yeah.

Gavin (PS0BA)              [1979] Yeah.

                           the erm ... perspex thing ... that is, that is erm
                           ... till guard, and he's stood writing it on there
                           cos he thought there was nowhere else.
                           [1981] And ... stood blocking like, how I get round
                           to the till!
                           [1982] And you just couldn't absolutely see anything
                           ... serving customer ... I was going to so , to move
                           ... or change out my draw ... shutting it up,
                           turning it off, going away ... and somebody else had
                           come, he kept, kept, kept doing that and he was
                           stood there all the time and I thought ... I thought
                           you definitely won't get the job!
                           [1983] Well you're, you're not bloody suitable for
                           it cos you keep getting ... under my bloody feet!
                           [1984] ... And then
Gavin (PS0BA)              [1985] How old is he?
Sue (PS0BB)                [1986] I dunno.
                           [1987] Probably about twenty three I think.
                           [1988] And he's filled all the front in and the
                           back, like, referees and everything ... and he said
                           ... inside you've got to give your details of your
                           erm ... employment history ... and he'd not put
                           anything in, said I didn't know whether to put
                           anything on there cos I'm on a Y P.
                           [1989] I said, what you mean a Y T S?
                           [1990] He sa , and he looked and he went ... yeah, Y
                           T.
                           [1991] And I says, well ... you know, is it, is it a
                           job?
                           [1992] You've got to put it down.
                           [1993] And he went, well no it's not a job.
                           [1994] I said, well what is it then?
                           [1995] He said, well I'm training.
                           [1996] I said, well training to do what?
                           [1997] He says I'm training on a Y T S.
                           [1998] Jesus Christ!
                           [1999] Is he really thick or what!
                           [2000] I still don't know what he's doing!
                           [2001] He were working for an erm ... Macro or
                           something.
                           [2002] Macro?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2003] Yeah.
                           [2004] Well maybe.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2005] Oh I'm, I'm thinking of Macro ... Macro
                           wholesalers.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2006] Well I know Macro.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2007] And when he went, as he went, she says oh I
                           don't think he'll have much choice, er, much chance
                           do you?
                           [2008] ... And we got this mad bloke come in!
                           [2009] And ... the amount of people come in, with a
                           cigarette ... I have to go up and tell them that
                           it's a no-smoking area and they look at me as if I'm
                           stupid!
                           [2010] Did I tell you about that bloke the other
                           week who got, the one who just cocky with me?
                           [2011] Ooh God!
                           [2012] He really got my back up!
                           [2013] This young lad about ... probably about
                           twenty three, twenty four, and he came in with a
                           cigarette and I said excu ... excuse me but I'm
                           afraid it's a no-smoking area.
                           [2014] And he looked at me, and he said well have
                           you got any, he go , started like tutting and said
                           well have you got any signs up?
                           [2015] And I must have been in a really funny mood,
                           and I said yes we have it's on the till and he went
                           ... well I suggest you get them in the windows then!
                           [2016] And I felt like saying fuck off and
                           [laughing] get out [] !
                           [2017] But I thought ... they're obvious, do you
                           know what I mean?
                           [2018] It's like ... going to a firework factory and
                           ... sparking up a cigarette you just wouldn't do it
                           would you?
                           [2019] ... You wouldn't!
                           [2020] And this bloke come in today ... and erm ...
                           looked a bit, looked a bit like a tramp ... didn't
                           quite catch what he said, I'm sure he said ... God
                           sent me in here for a cigarette!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [laugh]
Sue (PS0BB)                [2021] I said, [...] , I said I'm sorry it's a no-
                           smoking area.
                           [2022] And he looked at me, give me a really
                           horrible look as well!
                           [2023] Felt like going ... you know, how when
                           somebody put a lot of hate in their eyes?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2024] That's very, bad as what you give
Sue (PS0BB)                [2025] No.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2026] me every day.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2027] I can't do it.
                           [2028] You know like th ... if you look at someone
                           ... and they always say your eyes ... are the souls
                           ... o yo , like your soul aren't they?
                           [2029] You can always read people's eyes, especially
                           with your kind of facial expressions, cos the eyes
                           always tell the truth.
                           [2030] And he looked u like he really hated me!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2031] Probably did!
Sue (PS0BB)                [2032] What, cos I told him ... he couldn't smoke?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2033] No!
                           [2034] Probably just hates everybody!
Sue (PS0BB)                [2035] Probably, yeah.
                           [2036] ... Yeah, he was a bit weird! [...]
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2037] Ooh!
                           [2038] Get off!
Sue (PS0BB)                [2039] Just ... [sigh] ... Hope he's not late.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2040] Yeah, so do I.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2041] What time is it?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2042] Half seven. [...]
Sue (PS0BB)                [2043] I don't know.
                           [2044] I think he picks me up after Coronation
                           Street, are you going to be here?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2045] Yeah.
                           [2046] ... I wish I got this fish in butter.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2047] I thought we put them back and had erm
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2048] Ah!
                           [2049] We did do.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2050] fish in breadcrumbs, that's why, we wanted
                           fish.
                           [2051] Wanted something really tasty!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2052] Well you got it, it is really tasty!
Sue (PS0BB)                [2053] No.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2054] What about those chicken things I bought?
Sue (PS0BB)                [2055] Chicken what?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2056] [...] chicken things didn't we?
Sue (PS0BB)                [2057] Did we?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2058] Cheese and pasta something.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2059] Ah broccoli!
                           [2060] I don't fancy [...] cos I didn't enjoy that
                           chicken wings last night and that had broccoli in
                           it.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2061] Oh!
                           [2062] Narrows it down don't it, to mince pies?
Sue (PS0BB)                [2063] There's only one.
                           [2064] I'll have that.
                           [2065] Ha!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2066] There is only one.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2067] That, the mince pie's the only one.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2068] Ah we got a big one haven't we?
Sue (PS0BB)                [2069] That's it.
                           [2070] Well could have that.
                           [2071] Yeah, I quite fancy that actually.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2072] Roast potatoes ... and gravy.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2073] We haven't got that much potatoes Gavin,
                           that's what I said.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2074] Oh!
                           [2075] Have to have it with chips then.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2076] Steak pie and chips.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2077] We've hardly got any chips in there.
                           [2078] ... Eh?
Sue (PS0BB)                [2079] No, but I could fry some new potatoes cos I
                           think we've got some of those left.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2080] We have got a tin of those.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2081] Have we?
                           [2082] Oh, they'll come in handy actually.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2083] I have some of them ... with beans.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2084] Yeah.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2085] [whispering] I fancy some [...] [] .
Sue (PS0BB)                [2086] Yeah!
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2087] I could do with putting that pie in now cos
                           it's gonna take about forty minutes.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2088] Yes you will!
                           [2089] That is really good thinking on your part !
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2090] You can get it on now then [...] .

Gavin (PS0BA)              [2094] And then, well if you're going out that way
                           you take all this washing up.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2095] Well, no actually cos I'm not going ... I'm
                           not going up the stairs
Gavin (PS0BA)              [...]

                           [2102] Have you?
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2103] I think there's, one left.
Sue (PS0BB)                [2104] I kept kicking it the other day and I thought
                           well it feels ever so light, I thought there was
                           quite a few left.
Gavin (PS0BA)              [2105] I had four.

                           [2131] Take the bin outside.

                           one so what was wrong with that?
