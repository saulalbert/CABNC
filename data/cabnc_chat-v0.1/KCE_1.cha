        And Pete reminded him of, him of the person that he hated and all this! •832331_836351•
        And I was thinking  Shrimpy, you're stupid! •836351_838791•

*EMM:	You sure! •840131_842021•

*HEL:	Ahhh no! •865554_865834•
        I can't believe it! •865834_868214•
        But  Pete reckoned it was because like  cos like  Pete's seeing Susan •868234_873544•
*EMM:	Mm. •873694_873964•
*HEL:	and like  •873974_874244•

*HEL:	and he was with me •876554_877184•

*EMM:	Yeah. •885834_886154•
*HEL:	this business. •886154_886394•
*EMM:	But, in a way I mean like, I thought that as well, but then I thought  well that's stupid that is because  you weren't as  as bad as Pete was were you? •886394_894394•
        I mean, let's face it •894394_895594•

        Actually, you couldn't see it, but you could see it through anyway so it didn't make really that much difference. •117859_118173•
        But like, I got the mirror down and like, I looked at it  and whether it was the light or whether it just hadn't come up cos it was only like, a few seconds afterwards •118173_118779•

*EMM:	you know •128165_128215•

        But like erm  no one else saw it. •129303_129494•
        But, I tell you what, it was so embarrassing! •129568_129848•
        The, it was the , the Monday after the Saturday got, the Saturday it was done, I had P E  oh great! •129848_130307•
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	So there's me like  I'm sat in first lesson we have  P E last lesson  sat in the first lesson  and I'm , I've thought  God my bra strap feels really lose! •130313_131259•
        So I'm right  I thought  oh my God! •131266_131702•
        There's a gap in between, they're not attached any more! •131702_132183•
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	What would you do ? •132183_132282•
        .I mean, like, okay it wasn't bad I mean  let's face it and I'm not exactly flipping  Dolly Parton am I?! •132282_132966•
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	exploding everywhere wouldn't she ! •132966_133071•
        But like, I was thinking  this is gonna be so embarrassing like in P E! •133071_133628•
        With half a bra on ! •133628_133706•
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	! •_•
*HEL:	my cups down  my cups down to my waist ! •133717_134018•
*EMM:	I , I was sat there and  and then we was in maths, like the lesson before and I was going Zena, I don't wanna do P E! •134219_134755•
        I just do not want to do P E! •134769_134878•
        And she's going, why not? •134878_134963•
        You like P E, I don't wanna do it Zena  will you write me a letter to get me out of it? •134963_135263•
        She's going  no I won't, you know, not unless you tell me what it , why it is you don't wanna do it! •135263_135625•
        So in the end I , I wrote her this letter because I couldn't say it out loud  in case anyone else heard me! •135642_135989•
        And say that I've busted my bra strap ! •135995_136152•
        So she goes, oh don't worry about it. •136152_136486•
        Like, we go into the loo and like, you can mend it. •136486_136664•
*HEL:	Mm. •136664_136671•
*EMM:	So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all, okay, I thought, cos like, some of them have got the loop actually on the, the like on the top of the cup haven't they? •136671_137440•
*HEL:	Mm. •137440_137447•
*EMM:	Did this one? •137447_137482•
        No! •137482_137511•
        The loop's attached to the end of the strap! •137511_137757•
        It's a bit of the cup that's actually come apart, unsewn! •137757_137970•
        So that meant I had to get  the part of the, the top bit of the cup, thread it through the , the hoop and then tie it in a knot! •137970_138652•
        So like, you can imagine  I had to have all the strap completely undone  so like  the, the buckle was like down here! •138678_139249•
*EMM:	And above the knot! •139249_139444•
*HEL:	Comfortable then? •139444_139473•
*EMM:	Well  it wasn't, it wasn't that bad but like  it was really weird because like  you could see like, people like, especially the lads, just sort of looking at you  and then like  not meaning to be pervy but just like, looking again as if to think  why has Emma got a, a extraordinary lump  on half the top of her boob, you know ! •139479_141321•
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	It's like a lump there! •141321_141430•
        They're thinking, mm, a shame ! •141430_141507•
        But like, it was alright then because like  means that you can changed up in this one corner of the changing room all the time  and so  I'd got my shirt on while I was putting my T-shirt on  like  for the reason that my bra strap was bust, not actually because I'd got a gigantic  love bite around my neck ! •141510_142899•
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) 
*EMM:	But like er •142900_142917•
*HEL:	But I mean  •142917_143061•
*EMM:	So that was alright really. •143061_143202•
*HEL:	But, I couldn't believe it cos I  he goes to me, what do you think of love bites? •143255_143617•
        And I goes, I think they're horrible to be quite honest, I don't  •143621_143846•
*EMM:	Yeah. •143847_143848•
*HEL:	like them! •143855_143907•
*EMM:	Same as me! •143907_143963•
        I goes to Scott, I really really  hate love bites   and er  and he goes, yeah and me. •143963_144259•
        The only time he's ever had one was at this kid's party  , Franny someone, he's  actually a bloke ! •144259_144751•
*HEL:	Ooh that's   •144771_144939•
*EMM:	I said that's   he went to this party and he he was like really hard and he was really drunk  and he gave  Scott, Noel and Ian  a love bite  like  for a joke ! •144939_145780•
        He just decided to do  just for a laugh! •145780_146036•
*HEL:	Oh, how sick! •146093_146168•
        Ah what a gay ! •146168_146243•
*EMM:	I know like, anyway  but like, Scott had gone home  said to his mum  like, is his mum isn't, going what's that on your neck? •146243_146830•
        You know,woh what you been doing, sort of thing! •146834_146975•
        And he's told her the whole story  so Noel's gone home and his mum's gone, what's that on your neck? •146975_147506•
        So Noel's gone  oh  someone tripped me up, I fell down the stairs and hit it on the coffee table, right! •147506_147953•
        His mum believed him! •147953_148018•
        So then his  Scott's mum and Noel's mum met in town  and they were just talking  and Scott's mum  it's , God it's disgusting isn't it  that lad given all them little lads love bites! •148018_149054•
        And er  Noel's mum's going  well what? •149100_149333•
        I don't know what you mean! •149356_149519•
        Noel said  he'd hit it on the coffee table ! •149568_149701•

        And like, it's alright say like, once  every so often but like  once or twice  •259168_259534•
*HEL:	 (        ) 
*EMM:	a week or whatever  in, like staying out late, cos that means I wouldn't be back till like, quarter to twelve! •259534_260118•
        And get ready for bed  •260118_260178•
*HEL:	It's too much , yeah! •260178_260233•
*EMM:	it's too much isn't it? •260233_260498•
        But like erm  my mum was saying, you know  she's like  she's  got a, definitely got a good job and like, the kids really sort of  •260498_261042•
*HEL:	You get, are you alright? •261186_261270•
        Comfortable? •261270_261285•
*EMM:	Yeah. •261285_261313•
        , he's really sort of like, dead brainy and goes to the child-minder and  goes to school and whatever! •261313_261592•
        But like erm  she said like, he's a really good kid. •261598_261891•
        Well  •261891_261920•
*HEL:	Mm. •261920_261927•
*EMM:	I mean  well I thought to myself, God what a life! •261927_262338•
        I mean, I know it's not her fault  but like, every Wednesday she has  all the people from the college bridge  go to her house to play bridge. •262338_263116•
        I mean the kid's  •263116_263271•
*HEL:	Poor kid! •263271_263321•
*EMM:	just sat there on the sofa! •263321_263452•
        I mean, okay, he goes to bed about, what, eight o'clock or whatever? •263452_263739•
        But like, I mean  God, do you know I'd really hate that! •263758_264112•
        I mean, I used to hate it with like  having  flipping  anyone come up to our house when I was little! •264112_264622•
*HEL:	Yeah. •264622_264628•
        I remember, I remember once •264628_264888•
*EMM:	Apparently his mum's hardly there! •264892_264988•
        Because  the baby-sitter she's got at the moment right  she said she doesn't mind doing  Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays  as well as the weekends  but she doesn't wanna do every day  each week. •264988_266200•
        , how much does she go out? •266200_266337•
        I mean, God, the poor kid I feel really sorry for him! •266351_266624•
*HEL:	Yeah! •266624_266634•
        I mean  ooh! •266634_266702•
*EMM:	That's why she's asked me to do it, but like I said to mum  you know, I'm not gonna say to her, oh yeah I'll do it whenever you want, I'll say like  they're gonna do this extra course on Wednesday nights  and she said, like  unless she could get a baby-sitter she couldn't go  which is the reason I'm doing it. •266710_268565•
        So like •268565_268599•
*HEL:	Just say you'll do it Wednesday night. •268599_268805•
*EMM:	Yeah  say I can do it Wednesday nights, apart from that, you know  it's too bad sort of thing! •268805_269212•
        So I think I'm gonna change my nights  this, of staying in  to either , Monday and Wednesday or  Tuesday and Wednesday  something like that. •269212_269742•
        I don't know really! •269809_269989•
        But like, like erm  that'd be quite good because if I go to someone else 's house like, you don't wanna be sort of like, messing about with all, all the stuff, you haven't got anything to  mess about with, do your hair or whatever can you? •269989_271192•
*HEL:	No. •271192_271212•
*EMM:	Mess around with your make up. •271212_271281•
        So I can get loads of homework done  and erm  like I can count that as one of my nights in. •271343_271747•
