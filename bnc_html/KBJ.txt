Chris (PS1DS) [1288] Yeah.
Carol (PS1DP) [1289] But what makes ... made me laugh so much was the fact that

              mind you, it'd fit anybody, it's alright
Chris (PS1DS) [1290] Yes.

              token to get out.
Carol (PS1DP) [1307] Do you?
Chris (PS1DS) [1308] So when I parked my car I said to them ... I forgot how
              much it was in there, twenty pounds ... in the hotel ... as
              you're not a guest they give them in reception.
              [1309] I said well it's alright cos I went to this er ...
              presentation there.

              [1445] Six times six is thirty
Emma (PS1DR)  [1446] I've done that one.
Chris (PS1DS) [1447] sixes.
              [1448] That's it.
              [1449] Okay?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1450] Erm ... this.
              [1451] I'll leave that out.
Chris (PS1DS) [1452] Leave that out.
              [1453] Add them up.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1454] Mm.
Chris (PS1DS) [1455] [...] ... That much closer ... [...] can use those
              pictures.
Carol (PS1DP) [1456] Take a look.
Chris (PS1DS) [1457] Are they near the box?
Emma (PS1DR)  [...]
Chris (PS1DS) [1458] Yeah.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1459] Is that right?
              [1460] Four
Chris (PS1DS) [1461] Four is twenty!
              [1462] So it's four ... so
Emma (PS1DR)  [1463] Four times five is
Chris (PS1DS) [1464] Twenty!
              [1465] Four times five equal twenty.
              [1466] Er ... two times ... six equals twelve.
              [1467] ... Er ... four times three equal twelve.
              [1468] ... Er, two additions left.
              [1469] Alright.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1470] Those two add?
              [1471] So it's like one, two, one, two and one there and ... but
              put like ... erm ... seven add seven ... add seven is [...] .
Chris (PS1DS) [1472] Is twenty one.
              [1473] Yeah.
              [1474] Seven add seven add seven is twenty one
Emma (PS1DR)  [1475] One.
Chris (PS1DS) [1476] [...] ... And three times seven
Emma (PS1DR)  [1477] Right.
Chris (PS1DS) [1478] is twenty one ... and do it that way, five and fives.
              [1479] Okay?
              [1480] Two addition questions.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1481] Hang on.
Chris (PS1DS) [1482] Two ad yeah but you've got right two multiple ... and two
              addition equations.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1483] Not equations!
              [1484] You told us this!
Chris (PS1DS) [1485] But i thi , like these, these are equations.
              [1486] So ... two addition equations ... er ... three times se
              ... seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one.
              [1487] Right?
              [1488] Oh!
              [1489] A so, but you can also go
Emma (PS1DR)  [1490] Yeah.
              [1491] Yeah add three.
Chris (PS1DS) [1492] Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus
              three is twenty one.
              [1493] Do it that way on.
              [1494] Do you follow
Emma (PS1DR)  [1495] Yeah.
Chris (PS1DS) [1496] me?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1497] Yes I do.
              [1498] Right.
              [1499] Two multiplication
Chris (PS1DS) [1500] Yeah.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1501] and two addition.
Chris (PS1DS) [1502] Two addition.
              [1503] Right.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1504] So you, like, you [...] .
Chris (PS1DS) [1505] Yes, that's right.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1506] Then, it's like erm
Chris (PS1DS) [1507] One.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1508] seven times three, and three times seven.
Chris (PS1DS) [1509] And three times seven.
              [1510] That's right.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1511] And you do the same there.
Chris (PS1DS) [1512] Same on the adds.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1513] And then, this ... we do ... like
Chris (PS1DS) [1514] Right, she wants currency in two divisions ... in each,
              right?
              [1515] So it's ... one, two, three, four,fi
Emma (PS1DR)  [1516] That multiplication is a
Chris (PS1DS) [1517] yeah well divisions, okay, so it's twenty one shared by
              ... say, if that's one, two, three, four, five, six int it?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1518] Oh I know what I've got!
Chris (PS1DS) [1519] Six times three is eighteen ... or three times six is
              eighteen.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1520] I know what I've done.
              [1521] I've put the, I thought it was ... er ... okay.
              [1522] Six.
Chris (PS1DS) [1523] And division is shared by.
              [1524] So you got to do eighteen shared by ... six is three ...
              and eighteen
Emma (PS1DR)  [1525] Have you got
Chris (PS1DS) [1526] shared by three is six.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1527] So like, you go one, two, three, four, five, six ... six
              times ... you swap
Chris (PS1DS) [1528] Three.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1529] six times three
Chris (PS1DS) [1530] times three is eighteen
Emma (PS1DR)  [1531] is three times six.
Chris (PS1DS) [1532] Six.
              [1533] Yeah, and and you got
Emma (PS1DR)  [1534] Six times three and three times six.
Chris (PS1DS) [1535] A and division is ... eighteen shared by ... three ... is
              six, and eighteen shared by six is three!
              [1536] Yeah?
              [1537] ... Got it?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1538] I cannot read ... [...] .
Chris (PS1DS) [1539] Three sixes are eighteen!
              [1540] ... You got it?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1541] And you do the same there?
              [1542] Hang on!
              [1543] I haven't finished ... thirty three
Chris (PS1DS) [...]
Emma (PS1DR)  [1544] one yet.
              [1545] That's what I don't get.
              [1546] Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I
              don't a get how you do that?
              [1547] ... Is it, would you like us to put
Chris (PS1DS) [1548] It's fours int it?
              [1549] It's fours
Emma (PS1DR)  [1550] No two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve
Chris (PS1DS) [1551] Yeah.
              [1552] It
Emma (PS1DR)  [1553] That's twos.
Chris (PS1DS) [1554] No, but it's going to fours look.

Emma (PS1DR)  [1556] Alright.
Chris (PS1DS) [1557] Going into fours.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1558] What would I put?
Chris (PS1DS) [1559] Er ... one four is four, two fours are eight, and thre
              three fours is twelve.
              [1560] As ... this is been shared by ... lines int it?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1561] Yeah and it's on that one.
              [1562] You do it like that do you?
Chris (PS1DS) [1563] Yeah, cos it's being shared by
Emma (PS1DR)  [1564] Oh!
Chris (PS1DS) [1565] So it's, I would say that is ... er ... nine times four
              equals thirty six.
              [1566] And on that one is ... er, sixty three shared by nine ...
              six time ... sixty three divided by nine
Emma (PS1DR)  [1567] [...] four.
Chris (PS1DS) [1568] No!
              [1569] Sixty three divided by ... nine is six!
              [1570] Write six through it.
              [1571] Ten six [...] innit?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1572] No, it's ten sixes.
Chris (PS1DS) [1573] No, no wait a minute.
              [1574] Nines.
              [1575] What should nine times ten Emma?
Emma (PS1DR)  [1576] One nine is nine, two nines are eighteen, three nines ...
              are
Chris (PS1DS) [1577] Twenty seven.
              [1578] Four nines are thirty six, five nines are forty five, six
              nines fifty four, seven nine are sixty three.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1579] Oh thank you.
Chris (PS1DS) [1580] Right.

              [1598] But I still don't get what you have to write!
Chris (PS1DS) [1599] Well multiplication equation for this number line ... I
              would say is ... er ... I've already told you that.
Emma (PS1DR)  [1600] No, but I don't know what I have to, I have to write!
