*STE:	Oh 
*FRA:	Didn't tell him about the er row of eights on there.It's probably a processor fault. (.) 
*STE:	Ten quid'll have it fixed I expect.
*FRA:	Mm.If you could buy those   (.) that sort of thing    (        )  ((laugh)) we'd make good money with it er non-working.

*FRA:	That's a thought, yeah I can wang it on. (.) This was working when I picked it up, I'm pretty sure it was. (.) What does it do, anything at all?
*STE:	 (        ) I can't remember. (.) It's just erm   (.) like a sink innit?
*FRA:	Dunno I haven't seen it on.
*STE:	I think. (.) 
*FRA:	Stand by.Oh. (.) That's better. (.) It's doing something anyway.

*FRA:	 ((laugh)) 
*STE:	Oh that's alright. (.) 
*FRA:	Oh   (.) colour's dropping out, let's have a look. (.)  ((laugh)) Oh it is a flap, I thought it was red tape on there.It's a red flap.

*FRA:	Well yeah, and yes they've just asked them for forty grand more haven't they?Tony Jacklin and people like that.Just to keep the thing afloat. (.) Oh it's starting to drift now   (.) that's where the colour's disappeared.Well that should be a freezable job   (.) if it's warming up and going wrong.
*STE:	Yeah. (.) Did you see the Nat West profit, they lost   (.) three hundred million last year.
*FRA:	Cor!
*STE:	Erm not, they didn't lose it, they went three hundred million less than the year before profit though, two hundred millio er   (        ) bad debts

*FRA:	 (        ) Lloyds made about six hundred grand didn't they?
*STE:	They didn't do bad did they?
*FRA:	No, they did very well.
*STE:	But erm
*FRA:	See the shares jumped.
*STE:	I mean how did they lend him two hundred million without absolutely secure collateral?They wouldn't lend it to anybody else would they? (.) 
*FRA:	Well I thought that was funny about that guy that    (.)  (        ) watch Wogan on there last night, that girl that

*STE:	He got, that's right, he got two hundred grand   (        ) 
*FRA:	Two hundred grand from the bank.
*STE:	but I should think that's security, it's the bloke's house probably that.Probably took a chance with it.
*FRA:	Yeah but it's a lot innit for a film that you never know is gonna
*STE:	It is, yeah.
*FRA:	be any good. (.) Ah mind you he could probably sell it to the TV companies for about that I should think.
*STE:	Yeah     (        )  (.)  (        ) very good though, (        ) card number again or anything.
*FRA:	Oh it's brilliant that is.They're so cheap.
*STE:	They're ever so quick. (.) And they do it, and they've got it in stock, you know so 
*FRA:	Yeah yeah   (.) very good.
*STE:	Not no we're out of stock on that one, we're out of stock on that one.
*FRA:	Very efficient.Pity they didn't do other stuff besides

*FRA:	Yeah.Yeah just get the chips and that's it. (.) 
*STE:	I phoned a customer last night and said that the   (        ) system should be done   (.) by the latest I would think next Monday like, you know?And I said I'll bring it round personally and er   (.) you know, get it switched on for her.Yeah I want a lot of grovelling she says, I want an enormous amount of grovelling when you come.
*FRA:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*STE:	 (        ) cos they've seen exactly the same one for five hundred and twenty five quid   (        )  (.) 
*FRA:	Well it does look a bit like a T X ninety   (.) T X eighty five, that's a new one on me.
*STE:	Well
*FRA:	 (        ) different again.
*STE:	The plug's hanging off.
*FRA:	Eh?
*STE:	That plug's hanging off.
*FRA:	Which one?Oh that one?Oh yeah. (.) Yeah I don't suppose that happened when I pulled it out.It could do something. (.) Cos I thought these were all working actually. (.) Oh it's funny this one doesn't use a mains tranny like the others do. (.) Remote control. (.) Hmm swines  (.) 
*STE:	 ((laugh))
