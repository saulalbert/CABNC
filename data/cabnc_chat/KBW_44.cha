*MAR:	  (  )  like that, you know she didn't  (  )  
*TIM:	Oh 
*DOR:	If it's a book token that's it isn't it really?

*TIM:	 That's when we go to sleep   
*MAR:	Ah? 
*DOR:	You know she's pregnant? 
*MAR:	Oh yeah I know that 
*DOR:	She still rushes about like I don't know what 
*TIM:	That's when we  go to sleep   
*DOR:	 So er  , he's  given her a sun bed   
*MAR:	 Is the hand on the two?

*TIM:	 I missed you   
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	I think I have to get one. 
*DOR:	Well play the game with me, well it was very pleasant I must  say   
*MAR:	 Well  Laura's got one, the more that you, (  ) the more you look at  (  )  
*DOR:	It's a luxury though, I mean you know, you don't need it, the fact that we got one for Christmas it was very  nice, but   
*MAR:	 Well I was  only thinking that there's not much on the television so 
*DOR:	No, and so, but you can choose what you want to use, to watch the video  I mean I find it particularly good with children, we'd   
*MAR:	 I don't, I don't think   (  ) not really   
*DOR:	hardly ever watch the children's programmes official 
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	We you know we watch  bit's and pieces if we   
*MAR:	 Right then, Christopher likes this, that Wild one

*MAR:	Do you think he's worn out our little friend? No. 
*DOR:	This little friend? No, he kept waking up constantly, you, didn't you? You kept  shouting for mummy or daddy or somebody   
*MAR:	 What you keep waking up for? 
*TIM:	Yeah 
*DOR:	You're a silly  (  )  
*MAR:	You go to bed to sleep 
*TIM:	I waked up  (  )  
*DOR:	He seemed to be awake for a long time, I think, you know like you wake up and you don't know what to do with yourself, I think it was like that, so every quarter of an hour or so he kept me, shouting for a drink he didn't know quite what to do with himself  (.)  
*TIM:	Yeah. 
*MAR:	Your mother used to sleep like a log 
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	and she still    (  )   
*TIM:	  (  )  that  (.)  
*DOR:	Oh that's a very nice letter, I was just thinking that maybe erm Jill hasn't got her birthday card cos she's the type of person who would write and say thank you, you know to me 
*MAR:	She has got your address? 
*DOR:	She has got it and it was a lengthy letter so, but I thought it would be included in my birthday present 
*MAR:	Oh no 
*DOR:	but she's not, she's done it separate, in fact I think  that second class stamp   
*MAR:	 Has she got gone  going to school? 
*DOR:	Oh yeah 
*MAR:	Is she not    (  )   
*DOR:	 She's going to  carry on  till

*TIM:	 Oh I like that   (  )   
*MAR:	  (  )  they always told you what date you got 
*DOR:	She's got six weeks, well you can go on it when you like really, well, you   
*MAR:	  (  )  
*DOR:	no well, what they do is they tell you the earliest you can leave and then you can leave after that if you prefer 
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*MAR:	 (  ) give you a date and that was it. 
*DOR:	Right  (.)  
*TIM:	Still got it 
*DOR:	I was lucky, cos I had the summer holidays 
*MAR:	Right 
*DOR:	included in mine, so it meant that they paid me for the summer holidays cos I didn't officially  really   
*TIM:	 No   
*DOR:	I hadn't officially stopped work till the first of September. 
*TIM:	Catch, catch 
*DOR:	I got paid for August which was quite clever really    (.)  ((laugh)) cos my date would of been sort of half way through to book my holiday 
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	What am I supposed to do with this? 
*MAR:	Hold it tight mummy   (.) I can tell you that    (.)  (  ) if I let go you'll let   (  ) on the floor. What's this crayon doing down here?

*MAR:	 Yeah, yeah he's doing   (  ) blue   
*TIM:	  (  )  , see I've got it. 
*DOR:	That's because   ((yawning)) I didn't have time to sit and colour with him  so he decided he'd do it all blue himself didn't you? 
*MAR:	He hasn't done any green trees either 
*TIM:	I   (  ) one box. 
*DOR:	Yeah you can go and bring something else done. I only brought that one down because we haven't seen it for a long time, just choose one   
*TIM:	 I'm allowed to   (  )   
*DOR:	thing that you want to play with don't  just bring down any old thing   
*MAR:	 Don't bring down the box  just bring something, one thing. 
*DOR:	A game perhaps, that'd be nice. Have we got time for a game? 
*MAR:	It's twelve o'clock nearly 
*DOR:	Mm  (.)  
*MAR:	So we're not having Matthew any more 
*DOR:	Well we might do 
*MAR:	Mm, when grandma's got better 
*DOR:	Exactly 
*MAR:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	but I'm not erm, putting myself out, it's like   (  ) like April the fifteenth and everything 
*MAR:	 (  ) if you bring them over to my house 
*DOR:	Does it say I've got to do anything about it or does it say I'm on  it anyway   
*MAR:	 Do you have  to write in to say that you accept it?

*TIM:	 I   (  ) with a game   
*DOR:	Oh yeah, he's done loads  of it   
*MAR:	 He's not really  not really mentioned it 
*DOR:	Mm, I think they have a system whereby they have it in the classroom for a week 
*MAR:	And then somebody  else has it   
*DOR:	 and then somebody else  has it, so it's sort of once a month or something it turns up and they have sort of an extensive thing on it, I think that's the way it works. Oh that's nice you've brought the tractor down  (.)  
*TIM:	Mum 
*DOR:	can't make out where this school is 
*TIM:	mum 
*DOR:	down Birmingham Road, there we are, (  )
