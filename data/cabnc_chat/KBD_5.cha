*KEN:	start asking •130352_130552•
*BAR:	Mm. •130552_131052•
*KEN:	then that transport you could ask about putting it back on again. •131132_133742•
*BAR:	I mean what what I think I'll probably do is if we can get like erm  something that's obviously  our crowd and then  either  putting, say, Stella back on or something like that •133742_144042•
*KEN:	Mm. •144312_144492•

*BAR:	Yeah. •162032_162112•
*KEN:	went down really well. •162112_162562•
        And they brought a big following down didn't they? •162562_164142•
*BAR:	They brought a big following. •164142_164702•

        Yeah. •808512_808582•
        Yeah. •808582_808712•
        But it was really, I mean it, it meant of course that  the other people on the boat could have some enjoyment as well, cos I mean, there's nothing worse if you  if there's only one rod out, or two rods out those boats there's only like a couple of rods out int there on, on  •808732_822632•
*ALA:	Mm. •822942_823042•

        They've done  most of them are  I mean the certainly the ones on the little  little boat trips and that, I mean, they have  all it does is that  it'll tell you there's some fish about, I mean, it doesn't  •864582_873842•
*ALA:	Mm. •873982_874052•

*ALA:	Mm. •880002_880222•
*BAR:	Cos that's the most frustrating thing about fishing is when you're like  you know, you could be wasting that, you, you think to yourself like I could be wasting a whole, there's not a fish anywhere round here! •880222_892002•
