@Comment:	conversation #1 (Tape 037901)
*MAR:	He might try and come down again
*RIC:	What before 
*MAR:	before then, but you know it depends
*RIC:	Yeah
*MAR:	cos he's, this Friday he's taking a group erm youngsters to Paris
*RIC:	Is he?
*MAR:	That had been booked you see before
*RIC:	Yeah
*MAR:	in fact he was also booked at Easter to go to the erm to Florence
*RIC:	But he couldn't
*MAR:	again, but he's had to cancel that
*RIC:	Yeah, someone else has got to obviously in his place
*MAR:	Either that or I'd imagine 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	the people that went before have to sort of do it, but as I say he wasn't er, er
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	we went up at dinner time on the next day and, because he went back after he
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	the morning again, and we took Daniel up to the er, cos there was a station, Christopher picked him up there and off they went you see so erm haven't heard anything I presume   [laughing] he got back   [] alright but as I say 
*RIC:	How's Carris taken all this anyway now?
*MAR:	Mm?
*RIC:	How's Carris taken all this now?
*MAR:	Well seemingly she's erm
*RIC:	A bit resigned to it now?
*MAR:	a bit more resigned, there's another, there's another sort of erm possibility, I mean if they sold their house quickly of course then, you know they'd come down here obviously and they'd try and look for something, but it's not likely that they'd sell their house that quickly
*RIC:	No
*MAR:	but if they did and
*RIC:	They sell it
*MAR:	you know they'd all come down, but if they don't, erm
*RIC:	Christopher would travel
*MAR:	possibility is that Marilyn would stay up there for another year with Carris you know in their house and Timothy of course and erm, then sort of move down here
*RIC:	What after Carris has done her er GCSEs?
*MAR:	I imagine so, is she due to do them next year?
*RIC:	No she's not 
*TER:	No she's not you see she's 
*RIC:	no 
*TER:	got another year after that 
*MAR:	after that oh I thought she was 
*RIC:	I would of thought I would of thought is she, if they're gonna move this year is the year she's def gotta do it 
*MAR:	Yeah well Christopher knows that
*RIC:	Yeah
*MAR:	but erm, if everything else being equal obviously that would be the thing to do
*TER:	Yes, that'd be me
*MAR:	but if they can't well 
*TER:	they won't want to be separated for
*MAR:	well he 
*RIC:	twelve months 
*TER:	twelve months or so
*MAR:	He's going to be going up erm each weekend if this happens
*RIC:	Oh yeah I mean that's that's the 
*MAR:	and erm Marilyn will come down of course when she's at, she's worried as well about whether she's going to get a job, cos er, I mean they need to have erm a second income I should think
*RIC:	Well yeah, but I don't think the job's erm, I mean that's not the problem for her because she can always go on the agency you see and she can do general midwifery
*MAR:	Oh on the agency can you?
*RIC:	Oh yeah, I mean, I mean she can like
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	she used to go to an old person's home of a night time you know
*MAR:	Yeah
*RIC:	or, or days, you can pick actually just when you want to do it
*TER:	Oh yeah that's what she'll get something 
*RIC:	she'll get paid , she'll get paid travelling and everything for that so that er I don't see that that's erm
*MAR:	No well that's probably erm 
*RIC:	no I don't think that's a problem
*MAR:	no that's not a great consideration 
*RIC:	I I don't see that as a
*MAR:	Well I think it's just 
*RIC:	I mean that could be a short term until she could get herself you know a full time regular post
*MAR:	It's erm, you know, mostly Carris of course 
*RIC:	Yeah
*TER:	I mean I think if they can 
*MAR:	but she means if they sell their house they'll come down more every year then 
*TER:	Yes because in the summer I mean you, some time in the, in this next term would be the ideal thing really because that, if she can stay on for the summer term 
*RIC:	Before September that's right 
*TER:	erm well most of it I mean she'll be take and erm
*RIC:	Yes like in September
*MAR:	Timothy 
*TER:	Timothy will take his O levels you see during the summer term, well I mean by the end of June he'd of finished those so that 
*RIC:	September would be the ideal time for erm, you know, to be starting down 
*TER:	Well July, August I mean any
*RIC:	Well yeah
*MAR:	To get settled in
*RIC:	Yeah
*TER:	Mm
*MAR:	but erm
*TER:	and
*MAR:	as things are at the moment I think it 
*RIC:	But Chris 
*MAR:	Christopher's very much more happy to have met up with Bob in the office to see what he's you know the thoughts of 
*RIC:	Yeah, he, he'd come away I think rather happy I he, he nev , you know he begun to see here 
*MAR:	He's had some more idea , he had no idea what be expected of him or anything
*RIC:	Yeah
*MAR:	and this Bob erm has sort , he's been quite marvellous, he's set up some fantastic things
*TER:	He's getting an O B E
*MAR:	in
*RIC:	Is he?
*MAR:	Yeah he's getting an O B E
*TER:	next
*MAR:	next week isn't it?
*TER:	next week or something, yeah
*RIC:	Is he?
*MAR:	And he's written books and all the rest of it and in fact he's, he's going to be erm lecturing at Royal College
*RIC:	Mm, mm
*MAR:	you know after he gets out from here on a temporary basis sort of thing, so that erm   (.) Christopher says he's gonna be doing it for a year this lecturing, but it's very nice for him because he'll be able to contact him and Bob will help him if it's necessary
*RIC:	It'd be a difficult situation that will be for Chris then won't it I mean 
*TER:	Well Chris says he's gotta keep in with him for a little while, he said he
*RIC:	Right
*TER:	he said I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd rather have, rather have him as a friend than an enemy
*RIC:	And how did he get out of the Chris think he'd get on with him?
*MAR:	Oh very well 
*TER:	Alright 
*RIC:	Was he on the panel, on the board?
*TER:	I don't think so no, but you know I mean, for six months if Christopher's living here and having to go back at the weekend, for six months he gets an allowance
*MAR:	A travelling allowance, so
*RIC:	Get it, yeah
*MAR:	that would save them 
*RIC:	yeah but what that doesn't take into account is the tiredness factor is it?
*TER:	Oh no it doesn't
*RIC:	Because you work, you work the long days
*MAR:	and go, go by train
*RIC:	He'll go back by train
*MAR:	no question of Chris driving 
*TER:	Go by train 
*RIC:	yeah, but you've, but you've actually got to do this, I mean, that's right
*TER:	I know it doesn't, but at least it
*RIC:	Yeah, not
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	fair enough, yes and he gets moving allowance as well 
*TER:	Yeah, erm
*RIC:	removal expenses
*MAR:	So, I mean it's
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	We don't know anything
*RIC:	Oh, no that's 
*MAR:	more than that, nor does he really
*RIC:	I haven't liked to phone him up because it, you know, I certainly don't want to be, thought that, yeah, yeah, try and be nosy or anything like that, it erm
*MAR:	But that I mean we didn't even know he was coming, father rang up on erm
*TER:	It was ever so funny really
*MAR:	Yeah because I had said to father during the day on Sunday, I wonder if any of our children are alive?Because we haven't heard or seen any of them   ((laugh)) or anybody
*RIC:	Well I was, I was at
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	No I'm not talking 
*TER:	Not you 
*MAR:	no it wasn't you was talking
*TER:	we were thinking
*MAR:	Bridget even hasn't phoned us either 
*RIC:	I was out on the moor from, it's been a hell of a fortnight really
*MAR:	No, no, not, not sort of getting at, anyway I had just said that to father you see
*RIC:	Yeah
*TER:	I'd phoned up
*MAR:	so father said well I'll erm go and see if erm Christopher's 
*TER:	Timothy answered the phone you see 
*MAR:	erm there
*TER:	so Timothy said oh he said well you want to know what time he's coming tomorrow
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TER:	I said pardon
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TER:	he said well hasn't he told you?I said what?He said oh he says perhaps it was gonna be a surprise 
*MAR:	I've put my foot in it again 
*TER:	perhaps I shouldn't of told you, so I said well look Timothy I said this is a conversation that hasn't taken place I said when Christopher comes back in I said if you want to say anything you can, but feel free not to and we'll just, if he comes we won't know anything about it
*MAR:	Play it by ear
*TER:	that, that way, he must of said something because Christopher phoned up and said I'm coming down tomorrow  ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	He did say something Christopher told me that
*TER:	Oh he did, did he?
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	and I are off tomorrow and it's the first day off that we've had together you know, for
*MAR:	Alright then, so are you gonna go out or something?
*RIC:	I might , well no we're not
*MAR:	Go and have some lunch or something
*RIC:	Well I dunno, I don't know what we'll do, it's, there's plenty of work to be done around, but I've been out every night this week and I'm in tonight thank goodness, I need to be in
*MAR:	Mm
*RIC:	erm, what's it?Twenty five miles over the moor for the weekend  (.) 
*TER:	Oh and then of course, change the subject completely, we've just, we've been out this morning, have we been out this morning?
*MAR:	We've been out together this morning, yes 
*TER:	We've been out this morning, that's right , we got back in and I was then going to go over to Saint Mary's church club, I wanted to go to the bank at Saint Mary's church, and erm, back door bell goes ding ding ding ding ding and I think it's Chris cos Chris is normally the only one, go out there and who should it be?It's Bill  and his missus, do you remember Bill  who used to caretake at school?
*MAR:	No you wouldn't know but he was the caretaker at father's school, wonderful man, absolutely, he's got god knows what he hasn't got wrong with him, but he has sort of 
*GRO:	 (        )

*RIC:	And you said your son's going to Orlando

*MAR:	Oh she probably heard that I had not been well
*RIC:	Well that's right
*MAR:	that'll be it
*RIC:	that's what I'd guessed, erm, so I said no, I said they're fine, so she said oh I'm ever so sorry I said don't be I said these sort of things get around, I mean it's, she kept go and then I went on to describe how I virtually done not too a dissimilar thing going up the road trying to talk to people about writing in to object, you know with this planning application and erm, I said I sort of knock on someone's door up there and I thought it was the next door that the husband had died and it was that one
*MAR:	Oh dear
*TER:	Mm, mm
*MAR:	you can't help putting
*RIC:	I'm going to go to the planning committee meeting there
*MAR:	Are you?
*RIC:	on Monday and then happily leave around about ten o'clock
*MAR:	So you can go alright can you?
*RIC:	Oh yeah 
*MAR:	They'll, they'll allow you to go?
*RIC:	Oh yeah you're allowed to go in and watch, you're not allowed to say anything, but I just wanna go in and, and er
*TER:	See who says what
*RIC:	Yeah
*TER:	Yeah, that's a good idea, mm
*MAR:	Yes well I mean had we had any idea about this, obviously father would of 
*TER:	Didn't even go to the committee dear, this one 
*MAR:	Didn't even no I've never even went to the committee, yours was 
*TER:	That was, that was the trouble with ours 
*MAR:	going to a committee
*TER:	absolutely I'm sure of that 
*RIC:	Well I mean it's , it's well as soon as, it's, well did you write in and object in within the time?
*MAR:	Oh yeah, yes
*TER:	I wrote, I wrote a foolscap letter with about nine points on it and somebody who, the architect, Chris's architect next door said with a letter like that going in, it must go to the committee
*RIC:	Mm
*TER:	so I wasn't bothered, but it didn't go to the committee and now, afterwards when I
*RIC:	Mm
*TER:	then it was too late
*RIC:	But you can't appeal against it, you can't appeal against it 
*TER:	No, no 
*MAR:	No that's right 
*RIC:	they,
*TER:	they can appeal 
*RIC:	they can appeal 
*MAR:	Yeah
*TER:	but you can't and I think it's very wrong that one man should have, be almighty god really, do 
*MAR:	This present mayor was away on holiday at the time, he said perhaps that I should of seen that erm it would go to committee
*RIC:	I mean I have gone to the trouble, I have been in to see the planning officer that's dealing with it, erm I've written to every single member of the planning committee, I've written to the Environmental Health who have written back to me saying they offer no objections and there because the smell won't be a problem so I've written them back another stinking letter and saying well erm
*TER:	Come and live next door
*RIC:	I, I completely disagree with your thoughts on the fact that there won't be a smell, so much so that the slightest smell if the, if the er proposal gets the go ahead and I shall be on to your office and asking to speak to you personally, to come and   [laughing] smell   [] this erm 
*MAR:	And the rubbish, I mean the, the environmental people 
*RIC:	Oh they, they say it's all controllable so that I've, I've answered, I haven't just let the Environmental Health wash over me I've actually written back to them again, er I'll be interested to see whether I get a letter back from them, but I phoned up the Council this morning and they're rejecting on two grounds, one is to do with the highway and the sort of the traffic situation coming in there, although the, the authority, the Highway Department aren't objecting to it and the other one is erm, on local environmental issues I think you know that is, is unsuitably, unsuitable environmentally to the area   (.) well I can only say that I'm grateful to the planning, to the planning offices for they're going out on a limb if you like because I think they're on thin ice   (.) erm   (.) and so long as the committee will, will back them up I mean I don't know of what else I could of done as a person
*TER:	No nothing, I don't think you could of done any more, you got it to committee and, and there's nothing more than you can do than that
*RIC:	erm, so that if, if they then go to an appeal er, I was talking to this planning officer and I was saying that I think I'll consult them, he said I don't think you'll need to he said, and of what you've done so far is pretty good and I can get access to all the letters that have been written in, in objecting into the into the homes 
*MAR:	Have a lot of other people written in and objecting?
*RIC:	I think there's I think there's quite a few and I think this is what swayed it, the fact that they have had erm, I know of at least ten   (.) say ten, there's one, two, three on the other side of the road which is good because Bob  which is another one, so that's four, there's  which is the other side of the shop, is five, there's us, six, Jean seven, the  eight, erm the guy the other side of the  which is nine, there is Ginny  over the and the erm old persons' home, that's ten that I know of for certain about, er and then I've heard of other people were gonna be writing in, now whether they actually did or not I don't know
*MAR:	Mm, as you, see you, you really do need 
*RIC:	but I'm sure, if if I've had ten objections, I mean I've done
*TER:	You've done very well by that, you know
*MAR:	You really have been to houses 
*TER:	I wish we of had that knowledge when
*MAR:	Had we known about it because this is the sort of thing we could of gone 
*TER:	We would of done the same sort of thing and could of gone in to see the planning officer but I just, I just assumed you know that, that life was fair but of course there's no justice in this life 
*RIC:	But er, the only, the only, yes, no the only other thing I would of said that you could of perhaps done would be go to to a Local Authority ombudsman
*TER:	Well I, we went there afterwards
*RIC:	Did you and what did he say?
*TER:	but it was too late you see and there was no, I mean 
*MAR:	It was passed 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	I, I couldn't produce any evidence of malpractice, I mean I could 
*RIC:	No 
*TER:	think what I'd like, but I couldn't prove anything and erm, so there was nothing that the ombudsman could do at that stage, at, as the stage complete
*RIC:	Yeah
*TER:	erm and there was nothing that a Member of Parliament could do, this is the trouble I mean it, it with everybody was saying you should of contacted us before it went to 
*RIC:	I'm going to see Patrick  tomorrow, there's a coffee morning up in the village, but erm
*MAR:	Well you went to see him 
*TER:	and he, he is very keen to try and change the law so that people like you and I who is 
*RIC:	can appeal 
*TER:	can, can appeal against the decision which goes against us, it's, its not fair that we 
*RIC:	because we we're the third party we're not allowed to appeal against it
*TER:	It's not fair that the, the other people 
*RIC:	I know 
*TER:	can appeal but you can't
*RIC:	I know the person whose house, I mean, I've spoken to Jane  at some length and I'll probably ring her tonight erm   (.) but erm, I, I might go around and see old erm  tomorrow at a coffee morning I think up in the village
*MAR:	But I think that he I find he's 
*TER:	Anything he does 
*MAR:	he's very sympathetic to the likes of 
*TER:	at least, at least you've got it's going to committee, it's not gonna be just on the on the rest on one man 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	One person with er yeah 
*TER:	erm who will undoubtedly he'll have favourable contacts with the person who was applying.
*RIC:	I mean as I'm, I don't think they had any option with this I think because it's a change of usage, considerable change of use then it had to go before the committee, erm   (.) but erm
*MAR:	It's okay, even if they get send down then of course they can still appeal but you can't it's ridiculous 
*TER:	Well it's not fair
*MAR:	No 
*RIC:	That's right and, so I don't know, we erm   (.) we live in hopes anyway.
*TER:	And how's Helen?
*RIC:	Alright, I mean she's working long and hard and er  (.) 
*TER:	How does she think she'll do with her A levels?
*RIC:	Well I think
*TER:	Has she had her mocks yet?
*RIC:	No, not yet she's, she's had an accept, I'm taking her up to Cardiff on Wednesday on a B and two Cs, the thing 
*MAR:	Yeah 
*TER:	Oh for going to university?
*RIC:	Yeah
*MAR:	What about her er York which she's had 
*RIC:	She hasn't heard from York she's heard from Leicester 
*MAR:	She hasn't heard from them yet
*RIC:	and she's got an acceptance from them on a B and two Cs
*MAR:	Oh has she?
*RIC:	erm
*MAR:	Because it was York that was stopping her listing wasn't it?
*TER:	What she going to , what she applying to get a degree?
*RIC:	History
*TER:	History
*RIC:	The trouble is, I mean I can take, I can take her up to Bristol er Cardiff next week, but there's another thing to, to Leicester and I can't get her up to Leicester although she
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	on a train, because I've got a governor's meeting that day and, and I can't avoid not being at that governor's meeting because I'm a chairman
*TER:	Yeah
*RIC:	of the building and sites
*MAR:	Yeah
*RIC:	erm   (.) ha, I dunno
*TER:	When is it for Leicester?
*RIC:	Do you know I can't remember the date, early part of March, early part of March, erm what she says at the moment is that er someone else from the college is going to Leicester next Wednesday when Helen's going to Cardiff and this girl is then going to Cardiff when Helen should be going to Leicester, so Helen says, and she wants to look at the same subjects as what Helen does so Helen says that they're gonna sort of go to the different colleges and compare notes when they come back from it so she might needn't want to go to Leicester
*MAR:	Mm
*RIC:	erm, so I just, I just don't know, erm, so we just
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Daniel was saying hasn't she heard from any of her
*RIC:	so
*MAR:	I said I don't honestly, I only know that er, erm
*RIC:	which is quite nice to have fir to have an acceptance to anyway 
*MAR:	Yeah very good
*RIC:	so   (.) I don't think she'll get an acceptance to York on a B and two Cs   (.) I think York is one of the better
*MAR:	Try thinking, do you know somebody used 
*RIC:	better I think 
*MAR:	to swear about Southampton for history
*RIC:	I don't know, I can't remember whether she applied for that, I know Harold  his daughter went up to Southampton and he was horrified at the accommodation she was staying in, up there
*MAR:	But I know that erm, for
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	I think I've just about finished with it
*MAR:	Oh have you?
*TER:	Have you?We've not had an appointment to go back have we since you've been home, but I suppose it was been October when we went

*RIC:	something to one of the teeth
*TER:	Yeah
*RIC:	crown dropped off so she had to put that back on, she never put, I had to get erm have another fitting for it, because she said the purpose of pins in her teeth in the tooth to try and get the crown to sit on, on the pins, erm
*TER:	Darling

*RIC:	and in fact 
*MAR:	last time I saw him 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	I took, I took the cheque around on Monday, I had the, the last appointment on Friday and erm since I've had the abscess, the tooth that's got a crown on top, I think it's been pushed up a little bit and my top teeth, the first two keeps catching was this

*RIC:	Oh, but this, it was catching the tooth that had the abscessing underneath it
*MAR:	Yeah 
*RIC:	god was it painful, and erm, so the crown has got a filling in it now   ((laugh)) because she, to, to relieve the pressure on the abscess she had to drill right down through the crown, erm to go right through into the root area
*MAR:	Get me ash 
*RIC:	to get rid of the abscess, oh god it was painful, it really was, in fact I had it once, I had a load of penicillin, didn't finish the penicillin and it came back again and they had to give me a stronger drug then for five days 
*TER:	Oh I see 
*MAR:	Did you erm, did you 
*TER:	that's the trouble with them

*RIC:	Yeah
*MAR:	Mind you, you see in the long run they proved that she was
*RIC:	Well all, all that 
*MAR:	good enough to do it
*RIC:	all that proved to me is, is that Helen the board, the examination board that Helen did at the college, she said it was a much, a much better exam to do than it was at
*TER:	Was it?
*RIC:	she felt much happier about doing it
*TER:	Mm
*RIC:	and it's a different, it was a different exam to the one she was doing at Cuthbert Main, so I don't know, erm I'm not certainly enough qualified to arguing about qualified matters 
*TER:	No, no 
*MAR:	No
*RIC:	at school
*MAR:	I hear

*TER:	Mind you the tents up there didn't look very new actually, I know one
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	but there was one or two bits of tent then
*MAR:	Oh I don't know what they do, but do you remember that great big jumble sale they had that raised over a thousand pounds?They had under the erm,
*RIC:	What the Scouts?
*TER:	multi storey?
*MAR:	Yeah 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	yeah
*RIC:	Four or five years ago now 
*MAR:	Well that was sort of mostly to, to be buying erm
*RIC:	Tents
*MAR:	tents, but
*TER:	Who
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	yeah just phoned in to find out where the flags were, but it doesn't see the flags
*RIC:	It wasn't Andre that, that comes around here?
*TER:	No, erm
*RIC:	Ferchase?
*TER:	No, where's my diary, I've got, I've got his name in my diary
*MAR:	Erm actually Kay got in touch with this man and in fact she had got Andre's name as well sort of 
*TER:	It's, er you know I yes, I erm
*MAR:	he's a, he's retired, I mean he, he doesn't have anything very 
*TER:	Ivor somebody  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Ivor somebody, no just a thought 
*RIC:	How old is he?
*TER:	Oh sixty five, seventy 
*RIC:	Sixty, no it's not him 
*MAR:	Retired haven't they, because if somebody came to you cos you see, he was so upset about it 
*TER:	I think he's coming I think he's coming up to the high week group, what is he?He's something he's, he's, he's some, something to do with er with er, with the area and erm, and he's coming up for the high week group some time in the next, little while, and I said to him you were the group's
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	up there
*RIC:	Yeah, what did he say?
*TER:	Oh I think he was just surprised, I don't think he knew, you know, I mean
*RIC:	Because I'm on a district executive committee at the moment and I don't, that name doesn't ring a bell
*TER:	He's erm
*MAR:	Kay  knows him cos he's 
*TER:	he's about , I suppose he's about my height probably slightly slimmer 
*MAR:	Slimmer 
*TER:	erm and I would of thought he's sixty eight something like that
*RIC:	Oh gosh no, well I don't know who that is, I've got no idea 
*TER:	He's got , he's got a big, a very big scout badge on his lapel 
*MAR:	And he had a scout badge on his tie, did you notice that?
*TER:	No I didn't notice that on the tie, yeah
*RIC:	I wonder who that is?
*MAR:	Kay  knew him, she rang him up
*RIC:	Well I mean if it, if it's, if it's ten
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	erm, I'm at the process of now looking to spend   ((sigh)) certainly four hundred pound on a tent and maybe 
*TER:	Well I, I , I mean I wouldn't of thought that
*MAR:	Your, your best bet would be to go up and sort of you know look at the tents that are up there so that you would know whether they went about 
*TER:	I'm meeting him nine o'clock Tuesday morning at the hall
*MAR:	But I suppose you could go and look tomorrow morning
*RIC:	I'm at work erm well 
*MAR:	he's off tomorrow
*RIC:	erm, I, well I can't commit myself to going down to that to, I mean if it's, if I can I'll give you a ring because with Cherry being off as well it's, I mean it's gonna be unfair if I start, cos I've been so much 
*TER:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
*MAR:	but if, if you are going to be spending a whole lot of money on tents and if these were any good 
*RIC:	Well I mean it's, this it's patrol, it's two patrol tents in particular that I'm looking at, if they've got some decent er scout tents 
*TER:	I must say I mean I, I mean er there were two rolls
*RIC:	How big are the rolls?
*TER:	Well I don't think they're big enough for a big tent, I mean one is fairly long, but er I don't 
*MAR:	But do, would it be 
*TER:	it wouldn't be any thicker than that I don't suppose, but I mean I wouldn't know
*RIC:	No, that
*MAR:	The thing about it is 
*TER:	It, it I wouldn't of thought 
*RIC:	Perhaps that doesn't sound like a patrol tent
*TER:	No, it doesn't sound like a patrol tent
*MAR:	This, er I know Margaret, Margaret erm, what's her name
*TER:	
*MAR:	at the time, no, it's, I won't say
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Tina's daughter
*RIC:	I know
*MAR:	Jim  's daughter
*RIC:	Yes
*MAR:	Marcus and all them
*RIC:	Yes
*MAR:	kids are called
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*RIC:	
*MAR:	that's right, erm she had said at the time when they had raised all this money that er mostly gonna be spent on erm
*RIC:	Tents
*TER:	Camping equipment
*MAR:	tents and camping equipment so that 
*RIC:	I can find out anyway because I can always talk to Andre about it, he'll know er what's being done about it, erm
*TER:	Er anyway he, this fellow's gonna, we're going to clear all the rubbish
*MAR:	So they, they, they've dropped the erm the group altogether then?
*RIC:	Yes and the 
*MAR:	Who else would that involve?
*RIC:	Well there was an adventure section as well 
*MAR:	Oh was there
*RIC:	erm, the adventure section was quite successful in a lot of respects they had quite a few people er attached to it, the scout group and the cub group, cub packs didn't have very many, but erm the adventure section had quite a few people, er and in fact we've got people doing the tent stalls at the moment that are from a seventh mutant, which is, what it was and of course they've disenfranchised if you like er but we're looking, the district is looking to create a new group with Buckland
*MAR:	Yeah
*RIC:	so instead of being the seventh Saint Joseph's we'd be just erm Newton Abbott
*MAR:	Yeah
*RIC:	so the seventh will stay
*MAR:	Mm, mm
*RIC:	and because the Buckinary is so big and really warrants having a stag group over that neck of the woods
*MAR:	They could well do 
*RIC:	they are gonna try and hang onto this seventh, so it well might be
*MAR:	Resurrected
*RIC:	that all its equipment is gonna be held on to 
*MAR:	Yeah
*RIC:	to try and set up a scout group
*MAR:	But in it, it's wicked, in that, in that cupboard they've got two pairs of really good walking boots, when Kay saw them she said it's not their feet, because you see she had the cubs there right from the beginning 
*RIC:	Mum, we have got the ten saws, last year one of the lads left with us a pair of eighty pound boots and fifty pound gaiters, left them and we don't know who they belong to
*MAR:	Ain't it awful really?
*RIC:	the scarper boots you know with the yeti gaiters on
*MAR:	Yeah
*RIC:	and the yeti gaiters are fifty pounds
*MAR:	Gosh
*RIC:	fifty five pounds
*MAR:	But anyway 
*RIC:	and the and and, and the and the scarper boots 
*MAR:	he was he was so horrified about it because she had actually run all that right from the beginning
*TER:	That came in this morning
*MAR:	Yeah, I was gonna give you a ring to say it's been this way, pick them up  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	we had a piece for lunch and erm
*GRO:	 (        )
