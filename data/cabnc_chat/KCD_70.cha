*HEL:	Hello my pet, I don't like to see you like this. •117317_117579•
        I say it's a good job we're not going to Joseph's tonight. •117615_117872•
*AMY:	Mhm.. •118290_118317•
*HEL:	Mm  I think you're a bit, think you're a bit hot, that's probably what's wakening you up . •119231_119867•
*AMY:	Mm. •119943_119949•
*HEL:	I think you've got a slight temperature, not a lot, but, just a little bit, do you think you can manage a drink of orange? •119949_120703•
        Well you ought to drink something, it'll bring your temperature down and it'll help make you feel better. •120703_121170•
        The only thing is to drink. •121187_121526•
*AMY:	Can I a little bit of orange? •121526_121847•
