*JEA:	Good.

*BRE:	Which is 
*JEA:	That's very good, yes. 
*CAR:	Our, our last teacher does, but she's not very good. 
*JEA:	That's how I was taught you see and so in spite of the long lapse of years there's still a tremendous amount up there because it was, it was properly learnt, you learn something  thoroughly   
*BRE:	 Cos Lee, since this  one's been talking to him all the time 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	she won't have English

*BRE:	It's nice though that. 
*JEA:	Oh it is, I shall love it. 
*BRE:	It's nice, yeah. 
*JEA:	In the next house you see I shall have to have different seating, they, they, I'm going to, I'm going to get somewhere smaller, so that three piece suite, it owes me nothing it only cost me what seven hundred pounds

*JEA:	and it's been and it's been beaten to hell. 
*BRE:	That's right. 
*JEA:	Erm, I'll probably have er two or perhaps a three seater sofa and for the rest fire side chairs. 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	And er, I thought I'd probably have wall paper on that wall, you know, use, use the curtains just as plenty of fullness, but have them for keeping out the light or keeping in the heat, 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	not make them an enormous feature. 
*BRE:	Mm. The grey, I mean if, if they  (  ) . 
*JEA:	They're lovely. 
*BRE:	It's the wrong, that's the   (  ) the wrong pink.

*BRE:	Mm, that's the only thing I don't like. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	But they, they so, so, you can, I mean I haven't phoned up yet, but, they, you can just have the, the slates replaced, you keep all your fittings 
*JEA:	Yes.

*JEA:	Yes. 
*BRE:	and run them up the strips. 
*JEA:	Yes. 
*BRE:	You know make it sort of to match 
*JEA:	Perhaps line your strips with lining, to give them body. 
*BRE:	To give them, yeah   (.) yeah, don't talk into it, it just, just chat away, they're, they're not interested in what you're talking about, it's just they're interested in erm on what's what, you know, what's, what's erm 
*CAR:	Who's got a  (  ) ?

*CAR:	A tank? 
*BRE:	A tank? What sort of tank?

*BRE:	Well what's it for? 
*CAR:	No, it's got to be right, right, er big and I'm going to stuff it with a plank of wood and put   (  ) I've got about two bushes and what the problem is, is you've got get 
*DAV:	I don't see any way your school's got to make this. 
*CAR:	we have, you've got to make a model, yeah and that's mine, you have to get two men and two children across the river, you've got one   (  ) and they can't swim, this is my one, two boys go across, one boy comes back, one man goes across, the other boy comes back, two boys go across, one boy comes back, one man goes across the other boy comes back two boys go across, I need to show that on, on  (  ) . 
*DAV:	You've gotta do what?  You've got  to 
*CAR:	 I need  two men 
*JEA:	You can draw it can't you? 
*DAV:	You gotta do it 
*CAR:	No, cos I got to show it and I can't 
*JEA:	Oh I see, but you, you don't need anything big, you need small things  surely  . 
*BRE:	 You want  something like a little erm, like a moose   (  ) you know, a moose carton 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*CAR:	How you gonna fit a little baby canoe to go across and two 
*BRE:	Well where you gonna get a baby canoe from any way? 
*CAR:	I can make one. 
*BRE:	You could ma  , you could, you could get something like or erm a pudding bowl, then you could make a little baby canoe out of tin foil 
*JEA:	Mm, mm. 
*BRE:	and the men out of tin foil 
*CAR:	Oh yeah. 
*JEA:	Or pipe cleaners 
*BRE:	Or pipe cleaners 
*JEA:	 Pipe cleaners are very good for that  . 
*BRE:	 Can pick some pipe cleaners up  , they're good for making little 
*DAV:	Why don't you just put a rope across it there then, walk across the rope. 
*CAR:	Cos, haven't got nothing except canoe. 
*DAV:	 (  ) . 
*JEA:	I can, yes I can remember having this sort of question about people with jugs and they wanted to measure out a certain amount, but they haven't got any markings for this certain amount  and that awful   (  )   
*BRE:	 This stupid Lee at the moment  for his exam, he's meant to have done it by Christmas and he hasn't done it for C D T, and he, they had to just choose something erm to make that actually sort of works, so Lee couldn't, I mean they did crane's and things like that and he couldn't, the thing he came up with and he's teacher was a, a go  erm, what was it Dave, a goalie  stand in his goal   
*CAR:	 I got   
*BRE:	and he had like a shooter thing that would er, erm a bolt or something would shoot the balls out 
*CAR:	 (  ) . 
*JEA:	Mm, mm. 
*BRE:	erm, to give the goalie sort of  practice, yeah  , 
*JEA:	 practice, yes   
*BRE:	but he's still got to come up, he's got to make this thing, I mean it's gonna be enormous with football's. 
*JEA:	I can remember at Westfield school about fifteen years ago we had an art teacher, who got the children to make an enormous thing, I think it was a Loch Ness Monster, and it went out of, out of the door of one room into another, you know, and they spent days and ages on making this thing 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	and I thought at the time it's, it's quite good enough just to have the idea and talk about the idea, make some drawings and 
*BRE:	Mm 
*JEA:	you know    (  )  . 
*BRE:	 Well this   (  )  . 
*CAR:	  (  )  . 
*BRE:	But I said to Lee, you know, 
*CAR:	Open. 
*BRE:	have a chat with you, cos there might be something that you think that it could make, that sort of like, not such a big sort of model 
*DAV:	 (  ) . 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*CAR:	If I cut some wood, crosses 
*BRE:	Well if you start cutting wood, you want to do things that are simple. 
*DAV:	You've got your   (  ) upstairs in the bathroom, why don't you use that. 
*CAR:	Oh no, I wanna do something to go across there, get a piece of string, get some string, yeah, make a plasticine canoe yeah, and then put, join two pieces of  string to it   
*JEA:	  (  ) interesting  . 
*CAR:	and then, not if you can't get, held up by a piece of string would it? 
*BRE:	Well, why not use your own penny boat? 
*DAV:	Yeah, you can use, put your people in it, all people. 
*BRE:	 Cos they look like real people   
*JEA:	 yeah, that's better   
*BRE:	yes. 
*JEA:	all, you know that's, now you're learning French, one of the things that the French say, they're always saying it, is  ((speaking french)), make things easy, go the straightest way, towards any thing  . 
*BRE:	 You can go and make  , you, pick out, you're like Lee you pick out these hardest things.
