*CAR:	Some mug might buy them!
*PAT:	then little dog may be   (.) erm won't go perhaps for that much.
*CAR:	Well no there's no   (.) no mount or anything on that one it's just   (.) as is   (.) that was a, the cheapest frame I could do cos I didn't like it   ((laugh)) when I finished it and I begrudged the price of the frame.
*PAT:	Oh   (.) I think he's I think he's quite nice.
*CAR:	Oh well you can buy him if you want. ((laugh)) 
*PAT:	No I don't want him   (.) but I still think he's quite nice I mean

*CAR:	The tile and the alphabet.
*PAT:	Yeah.
*CAR:	But I I really couldn't   (.) I would never get the price I would want for the alphabet.
*PAT:	What would you want for that?
*CAR:	Well I'd want over a hundred for that.
*PAT:	Mm.
*CHA:	 ((singing)) 
*CAR:	Cos it's got an expensive frame and it's a lot of work.
*CHA:	 ((singing)) 
*PAT:	Mm.
*CAR:	Ha.
*PAT:	What's the matter?
*CAR:	Don't you think you better wait till she comes back? (.) Save me getting up.
*PAT:	Now the I'm just trying to think of some some of those pictures that are in there   (.) now there was one, it was that size   (.) or in a pair like that lovely looking pictures 
*CHA:	Look at me.
*PAT:	they were done by   (.) Peter , have you heard of Peter ?

*CAR:	Well he's a well known artist.
*PAT:	Well yes, I suppose he is.
*CAR:	That helps. ((laugh)) 
*PAT:	Yes, I suppose he is   (.) but I mean those two those pictures we bought were hundred and twenty   (.) and I mean they're they're only done by somebody in the village.
*CAR:	Well yeah I mean the answer is
*PAT:	But we like them.
*CAR:	you pay what   (.) feel don't you?
*PAT:	Yes.
*CAR:	If you like something enough   (.) you know what you can afford and what you're willing to pay for it and if it's   (.) priced more then you don't buy it.
*PAT:	That's right.
*CHA:	 (        ) 
*PAT:	But you see something like that might just appeal to somebody, an embroidered picture.
*CAR:	You never know   (.) we will give it a try.
