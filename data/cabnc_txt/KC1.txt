Frank (PS09E) [1] They're not really [...] are they, the Chinese or ...
              Oriental dancers?
              [2] ... I don't think so anyway, they seem to be ...
*** 2 (Tape 040702) ***
Frank (PS09E) [3] A lot of cars at the school this morning.
              [4] ... I parked right on the end of the erm ... the lane, just
Lyn (PS09F)   [5] Mm
Frank (PS09E) [6] in, there was just enough room for me.
Lyn (PS09F)   [7] Mm?
Frank (PS09E) [8] Course we were late anyway ... well not late for John's but
              ...
Lyn (PS09F)   [9] [...] ... Which way do you go
Frank (PS09E) [10] When I came back
Lyn (PS09F)   [11] into [...] ?
              [12] ... Cos you can cut through that [...]
Frank (PS09E) [13] I turn round and go back, yeah.
Lyn (PS09F)   [14] Mm.
Frank (PS09E) [15] And of course the coach had come up the hill ... couldn't
              overtake where I was parked, blocking off the entrance to the
              lane where I'd just come out of so that the string of cars coming
              down the road and the first one wanting to turn in and of course
              the coach had covered it.
Lyn (PS09F)   [16] Oh yeah
Frank (PS09E) [17] It was completely blocked off ... coach couldn't go
              backwards because there was cars behind it.
Lyn (PS09F)   [...]
Frank (PS09E) [18] So I gingerly walked down and crept into the car realized
              that I was the one that had caused all that
Lyn (PS09F)   [laugh]
Frank (PS09E) [19] [laughing] and drove off [] [laugh]
Lyn (PS09F)   [20] [laughing] And ignored [] ...
Frank (PS09E) [21] Slinked off into the mist. ...
Lyn (PS09F)   [22] So he couldn't back back then [...]
Frank (PS09E) [23] No ... no that wa that was it, completely stalemate.
Lyn (PS09F)   [laugh]
Frank (PS09E) [24] [...] big Volvo estate was facing [...] if he'd go down
              there, I can get through and he can come back again and [...] he
              wasn't gonna do that.
              [25] ... Too much [...] brain damage [...]
Lyn (PS09F)   [26] [...] there's a big notice at the end of the lane which says
              [...]
Frank (PS09E) [27] Well he'd come up from Totnes this morning.
Lyn (PS09F)   [28] Oh, yeah.
              [29] What they usually do is they go up and then back down by the
              church
Frank (PS09E) [30] Yeah.
Lyn (PS09F)   [31] and turn and go back again. ... [...] ... [...]
Frank (PS09E) [32] Mm?
Lyn (PS09F)   [...] ...
Frank (PS09E) [33] It is eight o'clock though [laugh]
Lyn (PS09F)   [34] Mm [...] ... Perhaps I'll do some gardening. [...]
Frank (PS09E) [35] Did you do away with your [...] or [...] just put a plank
              over the top?
Lyn (PS09F)   [36] I put [...] back so [...] and then I put [...] against the
              fence. ...
Frank (PS09E) [37] Oh Alex came in today.

Frank (PS09E) [40] Well [...] he's got ... he's got plenty of money, right?
              [41] And er the car arrives ... I looked [...] all I could see
              was mother sitting in the car and puffing this ... smoke puffing
              out through the window
Lyn (PS09F)   [42] Mm.
Frank (PS09E) [43] and erm ... in came [...] he'd had a ... a little tiny
              switch out of his black and white telly
Lyn (PS09F)   [44] Oh yeah
Frank (PS09E) [45] and he said it's a [...] and the switch won't work.
              [46] I said how long have you had this set?
              [47] He said ooh about six years, I said yeah and the rest.
Lyn (PS09F)   [laugh]
Frank (PS09E) [48] I said where did you get it from?
              [49] He said well ... I used to work at [...] I got it from [...]
              .
Lyn (PS09F)   [...]
Frank (PS09E) [50] I said how long is it since you retired from [...] ?
              [51] ... Said ooh it'll be erm eighteen years this year.
Lyn (PS09F)   [52] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E) [53] I said you've bought this since you left [...] ?
              [54] Well I was trying to find how old it was.
Lyn (PS09F)   [55] Mm
Frank (PS09E) [56] So he said oh no since I left.
              [57] I said well I, I'd still reckon it's about ten years old
              now.
              [58] Oh no it's only six years old.
              [59] ... [...] fix the switch on I said you'll never get a new
              one anyway.
              [60] ... And ... oh they were talking about Rod they was ... they
              were saying that, you know, about Rod getting married [...]
Lyn (PS09F)   [61] Yeah?
Frank (PS09E) [62] Well I said well how old is Rod?
              [63] ... I dunno he said er Steve how old's Rod?
Lyn (PS09F)   [laugh]
Frank (PS09E) [64] I said well come on you're his dad, you should know how old
              he is.
              [65] So he went out to the car and asked mother ... how old is
              Rod?
              [66] She says I don't know ... [laugh] [...] don't remember
              having him [laugh] mind you I remember having him but I don't
              know ... I can't remember when it was.
              [67] ... He's thirty something. ...
Lyn (PS09F)   [68] Hard to put an age on him. ...
Frank (PS09E) [69] [...] Ray was thirty eight [...]
Lyn (PS09F)   [70] Is he as much as that?
              [71] ... Mm. ...
Frank (PS09E) [72] Well it must be ten years ago when he worked for the B B C
              and that, he must have been in his late twenties then
Lyn (PS09F)   [73] Mm. ...
Frank (PS09E) [74] so ... anyway he's [...] he's engaged and ... it's taken him
              two years to get engaged ... so it's gonna take another couple of
              years to get married.
Lyn (PS09F)   [75] Yeah. ...
Frank (PS09E) [76] He's still got the M G and it's got three twen twenty three
              thousand on it now.

              [80] And some chap came down from the M G B Owners' Club and said
              he'd offer him six thousand for it.
Lyn (PS09F)   [81] Mm
Frank (PS09E) [82] But he said he thought that was [...] price cos he said it's
              worth at least ten ... [...] the mileage originally, you know?
Lyn (PS09F)   [83] Mm.
Frank (PS09E) [84] [...] it's absolutely like new.
Lyn (PS09F)   [85] [...] ?

Lyn (PS09F)   [...] ...
Frank (PS09E) [89] In Devon, yeah.
Lyn (PS09F)   [90] Mm. ...
Frank (PS09E) [91] He's got a Metro at the moment they're driving around in,
              she drives, she passed her test at sixty eight.
              [92] ... So ... he's seventy eight now [...] she's probably about
              the same I think.
Lyn (PS09F)   [93] Mm. ...
Frank (PS09E) [94] But they had a Mini before the Metro and er ... the day they
              bought the Mini they saw an advert in the paper saying that if
              you buy a Mini in the next few days
Lyn (PS09F)   [...]
Frank (PS09E) [95] give you a free colour portable with it.
Lyn (PS09F)   [96] Oh.
Frank (PS09E) [97] Of course they didn't get the portable with this, they rang
              them up, said where's my colour portable ... [...] ... said I'll
              put you on to the manager ... anyway [...] they had some deal
              that night that erm to launch this Mini Mayfair or whatever it
              was ... wine and cheese thing ... so he went to the wine and
              cheese thing ... and [...] worried he was gonna kick up a fuss
              [laughing] so they gave him a telly anyway [] .
Lyn (PS09F)   [98] [...] yeah. ...
Frank (PS09E) [99] He's a penny pinching old bugger he is, god! ...
Lyn (PS09F)   [100] I can't quite imagine [...]

              usual [...] ... they'd got halfway to emptying the first dustbin
              in the back
Lyn (PS09F)   [105] Oh yeah.
Frank (PS09E) [106] and the hydraulic hose on the back of the dustcart broke
              ... there was hydraulic fluid all over the
Lyn (PS09F)   [laugh]
Frank (PS09E) [107] all over the car park.
              [108] So the driver said can I use your phone?
              [109] He came in ... and trampling this brake fluid all over the
              carpet.
              [110] ... He got through to the ... base camp to find out when
              the ... chap was coming to fix it.
              [111] ... Five minutes later he came in trying to tell ... tell
              us jokes and each time he'd been paddling through this brake
              fluid and the carpet is just ... you know, brains
Lyn (PS09F)   [112] Mm.
Frank (PS09E) [113] Hand picked for the job I should think.

Frank (PS09E) [332] till we, yeah yeah, I should imagine he is.

              two and a half grand left
Frank (PS09E) [339] Have we?
Steve (PS09G) [340] and so there's twelve and a half grand we're owed
Frank (PS09E) [341] Yeah yeah
Steve (PS09G) [342] [...] so if he charges, you know, fifteen hundred for his
              bit and then another grand to finish it off we're still clearing
              ten, you know, [...]
Frank (PS09E) [343] Oh well that's good then.
Steve (PS09G) [344] we might even clear a little bit more than ten but
Frank (PS09E) [345] Bit more than ten, yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [346] I mean if he charges two and a half I wouldn't be
              disappointed cos it's been in his garage, he's pushed everything
              along and he's always [...] so
Frank (PS09E) [347] Yeah, oh and he's been pretty reasonable hasn't he?

              [378] Easy to work on.
Frank (PS09E) [379] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [380] All you've gotta do is find out what's wr gone wrong with
              it.
Frank (PS09E) [381] Well I should think it's this little frame chip here, I'm
Steve (PS09G) [382] Oh
Frank (PS09E) [383] I'm gonna check all round I mean I should imagine that's
              what it must be.
Steve (PS09G) [384] Standard one is it?
              [385] Or something weird.
Frank (PS09E) [386] Well it's bound to be something weird I suppose.

              ...
Steve (PS09G) [388] A N?

              frame output chip.
              [398] ... I think I might just give it a solder over because it's
              er a bit dry in that area. ...
Steve (PS09G) [...]
Frank (PS09E) [399] Oh yeah. ...
Steve (PS09G) [400] That's [...] I've done all of that plus them others you

              for that.
Frank (PS09E) [425] Yeah.
              [426] He was very cagey about the fault on that, he probably
              knows it.

Frank (PS09E) [428] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [429] Well didn't we, no we haven't told him what the fault is

Steve (PS09G) [503] Yeah.

Steve (PS09G) [...]
Frank (PS09E) [506] lack of stink.

              [519] Tony Jacklin and people like that.
              [520] Just to keep the thing afloat.
              [521] ... Oh it's starting to drift now ... that's where the
              colour's disappeared.
              [522] Well that should be a freezable job ... if it's warming up
              and going wrong.
Steve (PS09G) [523] Yeah.
              [524] ... Did you see the Nat West profit, they lost ... three
              hundred million last year.

Steve (PS09G) [...]
Frank (PS09E) [530] [...] Lloyds made about six hundred grand didn't they?
Steve (PS09G) [531] They didn't do bad did they?
Frank (PS09E) [532] No, they did very well.
Steve (PS09G) [533] But erm
Frank (PS09E) [534] See the shares jumped.
Steve (PS09G) [535] I mean how did they lend him two hundred million without
              absolutely secure collateral?
              [536] They wouldn't lend it to anybody else would they? ...
Frank (PS09E) [537] Well I thought that was funny about that guy that ... [...]
              watch Wogan on there last night, that girl that

Steve (PS09G) [543] He got, that's right, he got two hundred grand [...]
Frank (PS09E) [544] Two hundred grand from the bank.
Steve (PS09G) [545] but I should think that's security, it's the bloke's house
              probably that.
              [546] Probably took a chance with it.
Frank (PS09E) [547] Yeah but it's a lot innit for a film that you never know is
              gonna
Steve (PS09G) [548] It is, yeah.
Frank (PS09E) [549] be any good.
              [550] ... Ah mind you he could probably sell it to the TV
              companies for about that I should think.
Steve (PS09G) [551] Yeah [...] ... [...] very good though, [...] card number
              again or anything.
Frank (PS09E) [552] Oh it's brilliant that is.
              [553] They're so cheap.
Steve (PS09G) [554] They're ever so quick.
              [555] ... And they do it, and they've got it in stock, you know
              so

Steve (PS09G) [557] Not no we're out of stock on that one, we're out of stock
              on that one.

Steve (PS09G) [560] Yeah.
              [561] I suppose that's how they've managed to be [...]
Frank (PS09E) [562] Yeah.

Steve (PS09G) [564] I phoned a customer last night and said that the [...]

              know, get it switched on for her.
              [566] Yeah I want a lot of grovelling she says, I want an
              enormous amount of grovelling when you come.

              hundred and twenty five quid [...] ...

              out.
              [578] It could do something.
              [579] ... Cos I thought these were all working actually.
              [580] ... Oh it's funny this one doesn't use a mains tranny like
              the others do.

                                     [631] But now this week, from what I put
                                     in the paper it's obvious that we're
                                     traders
Marge (PS09L)                        [632] Mm

                                     he lives about fifty yards from the shop.
Rex (PS09K)                          [636] Yeah.

                                     shop.
Steve (PS09G)                        [642] [laughing] Get off [] !
Rex (PS09K)                          [643] He could've come in the shop and
                                     bought them, yeah.
Frank (PS09E)                        [644] Yeah.

                                     [647] He never said well are you anything
                                     to do with it or nothing.
Steve (PS09G)                        [648] Yeah.

                                     it home and plugged it in, it ran for two
                                     hours

                                     remote in his pocket, my son carried the
                                     telly down, put it in the back of the car
                                     ... the bloke shut the boot, he drove off

                                     shoved it back in and drove away.
Steve (PS09G)                        [665] Get off!
Marge (PS09L)                        [666] And I give him three mo cos I'd give

                                     thought yes ... and I was standing there
                                     on the phone and I thought ... you dare
                                     come back! [laugh]
Frank (PS09E)                        [667] [laughing] Oh yeah []
Marge (PS09L)                        [668] We haven't heard from him have we?
Frank (PS09E)                        [669] Oh.
Rex (PS09K)                          [670] No [...] he probably ain't going to

Steve (PS09G)                        [...]
Frank (PS09E)                        [671] No.

Frank (PS09E)                        [677] That's like a skating rink now then.
Rex (PS09K)                          [678] It may be alright though, it may be
                                     alright with a bit of luck, you know?
                                     [679] I would've tried to help him out if
                                     we had a ... if we had a, a shot one with
                                     a case like, you know?
                                     [680] Then we could've put it together for
                                     him.
                                     [681] You know you can't be hard on people
                                     can you really?
                                     [682] Or I don't think so anyhow, we'd've
                                     nailed it together for him for nothing and
                                     [...]
Marge (PS09L)                        [683] Well [...]
Frank (PS09E)                        [684] Yeah
Rex (PS09K)                          [685] [...] ? ...
Steve (PS09G)                        [686] It depends on his attitude, if he'd
                                     been trying to pull a fast one on you and
                                     er
Steve (PS09G)                        [687] Yeah [...]
Steve (PS09G)                        [688] this was like this when I bought it
                                     off you
Rex (PS09K)                          [689] Oh no no, if he, if he tried to pull
                                     a fast one ... we've already had one like
                                     that ... th that came in and bought a set
                                     ... unfortunately ... his father paid by
                                     cheque, oh no, well he paid by two cheques
                                     which, they had a card on them I know very
                                     well they can't stop them very well ...
                                     and he went out and er, and er the T V was
                                     only in the car and he went round a corner
                                     quick and he went brrrm like that you know

Frank (PS09E)                        [690] Yeah
Rex (PS09K)                          [691] and split the case and all on the T
                                     V and he come back in he said ... oh I
                                     picked this up he said and the case fell
                                     to bits.
                                     [692] And I was there
Frank (PS09E)                        [693] Yeah, yeah
Marge (PS09L)                        [...]
Rex (PS09K)                          [694] [...] there and I said no ... my
                                     handsome you didn't pick that up and the
                                     case fell, fell to bi he, cos he was going
                                     on this is inferior ... not up to standard
                                     and so I said
Frank (PS09E)                        [laugh]
Rex (PS09K)                          [695] [...] I said now you can shut that
                                     up right away, cos I said you know it's
                                     not ... I said er ... now if you want us
                                     to try to help you out [...] on this you
                                     just tell us what you did.
                                     [696] Anyway his father was there and his
                                     father had paid ... and I said no ... you
                                     know, you've done that.
                                     [697] So anyhow he, his father said well
                                     that's right he said we'll be probably
                                     covered on the house insurance.
                                     [698] And they were anyhow so they had a
                                     brand new telly.
Frank (PS09E)                        [699] Mm.
Rex (PS09K)                          [700] And we had that one back and nailed
                                     them together and sold them again.
Frank (PS09E)                        [laugh]

                                     you weren't careful and just pick it up
                                     from the inside
Frank (PS09E)                        [705] Yeah.

                                     may have flaps [...] for them, I dunno.
Steve (PS09G)                        [726] It doesn't detract from them anyway
                                     does it?

Steve (PS09G)                        [730] Yes.

                                     think we'd have a thousand of them.

                                     couple and I'm amazed that you've still
                                     got them.

                                     anybody.
Rex (PS09K)                          [743] You won't?
Frank (PS09E)                        [744] I mean you're lucky to get that one

                                     can have a couple and keep a few of their

                                     a certain contract to take new stuff all

Rex (PS09K)                          [877] Yeah.
                                     [878] I would've thought they could've ...
                                     like somebody with an older text, they
                                     could've took the old one out and shoved
                                     one of these back into it.
Frank (PS09E)                        [879] Yeah I mean that is, that [...] is
                                     current now, that's what they use now

                                     [880] ... That is their current model.
Rex (PS09K)                          [881] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E)                        [882] They use that chassis in Thorns and
                                     Bairds and things.
Rex (PS09K)                          [883] Yeah.

Frank (PS09E)                        [885] Yeah it comes on, a [...] comes on
                                     and then it shuts down so it's some sort
                                     of shut down fault.
Rex (PS09K)                          [886] Yeah.

Rex (PS09K)                          [888] No.

                                     [894] Long as the tube's alright, that's
                                     the main thing.
Rex (PS09K)                          [895] Yeah that's the main thing on that.
                                     [896] That's a nice looking machine that

Steve (PS09G) [1004] Cos the tuner se seems to be working itself dunnit [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1005] Yeah I mean I assume it's the same tube in this as the er
              Grundig innit?
Steve (PS09G) [1006] Is it?
Frank (PS09E) [1007] Yeah.

Frank (PS09E) [...] ...
Steve (PS09G) [1011] Mind you I think the Grundig was a little ... [...] might
              require a
Frank (PS09E) [1012] Yeah.
              [1013] But this is only a basic set so I mean we'll know when

Frank (PS09E) [1018] Yeah yeah
Steve (PS09G) [1019] Yeah I thought maybe number one was worn out and ...
Frank (PS09E) [1020] Yeah, it's a knackered tuner innit?

Steve (PS09G) [1025] [...] ?
Frank (PS09E) [1026] No it's a little erm ... well I should think it's gonna be
              the tuner innit?
              [1027] ... Mm
Steve (PS09G) [1028] [...] sixty quid and one tuner, I mean you know ... don't

Frank (PS09E) [1039] all green, all green along there ... I wonder ... I was

              go
Steve (PS09G) [1040] It's still switched on so [...] ...
Frank (PS09E) [1041] No it's, it's got all the power bits to make that other
              one go.
              [1042] It's got a tube that would make the ... the other one go.
              [1043] Dunno.
              [1044] ... But it's losing a set that way innit? ...
Steve (PS09G) [1045] See the tube for the Grundig I think ... it won't help
              [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1046] No be worth trying won't it?
              [1047] Mm.

              cable's not connected to the ... tuner, we had one of them before
              didn't we, where they?
Frank (PS09E) [1106] Yeah yeah ... I'll just box this Sanyo up [...] out that

Steve (PS09G) [1155] Mm. ...
Frank (PS09E) [1156] Excellent.
              [1157] ... I know Jackie said well you shouldn't, you should try
              the Toshibas they're as good as gold those are. ...
Steve (PS09G) [1158] Telling the truth there. ...
Frank (PS09E) [1159] It's er Hitachis are the ones he didn't er rate at all.
Steve (PS09G) [1160] Oh yeah?
              [1161] [...] Hitachi as well I think.
              [1162] That's a duffer innit?
Frank (PS09E) [1163] [laughing] Yeah []
Steve (PS09G) [1164] Still if we move them on ... fifty five quid I reckon
              [...] nice set that'll tempt somebody.
Frank (PS09E) [1165] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [1166] Or we could buy another one [...] then don't we?
Frank (PS09E) [1167] Yeah.
              [1168] ... Right ... Oh that's right, that's what I ordered off
              Eddy today, two S D seventeen ten.
Steve (PS09G) [1169] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E) [1170] That one.
Steve (PS09G) [1171] Quite a good set.
Frank (PS09E) [1172] Mm.
              [1173] ... No I think I can probably make t one out of two of
              those.
Steve (PS09G) [1174] Well we'll get three of them, that price.
Frank (PS09E) [1175] Getting these done aren't we, gradually?
Steve (PS09G) [1176] Yeah [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1177] The non-working stuff.
Steve (PS09G) [1178] it helps dunnit?
Frank (PS09E) [1179] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [1180] I mean some of these you ain't even looked at, the
              Panasonic and things like that, it might be
Frank (PS09E) [1181] Yeah
Steve (PS09G) [1182] something simple.
Frank (PS09E) [1183] it's a bit long in the tooth that one.
              [1184] Still it's worth a look probably.
Steve (PS09G) [1185] It's thirty quid innit, to somebody like Jack ?
Frank (PS09E) [1186] Yeah.
              [1187] Looked at the Sony ... that needs erm ... [...]
Steve (PS09G) [1188] Er a tuning fault or something innit?
Frank (PS09E) [1189] Yeah it's just got erm ... blank [...] in it.
              [1190] ... That's another Hitachi isn't it down there the same as
              we've got over there? ...
Steve (PS09G) [1191] Oh yeah.
              [1192] ... F S T Tosh there as well.
              [1193] Shouldn't be too serious should it?
Frank (PS09E) [1194] We haven't looked at that have we, that one?
              [1195] I'm not sure.
Steve (PS09G) [1196] Don't know. ...
Frank (PS09E) [1197] Or is that the one that has got the burnt out bits in it?
              ...
Steve (PS09G) [1198] But I can clear these out for ninety quid apiece I think
              I'd move them just to get rid of them don't you?
Frank (PS09E) [1199] Yeah.
              [1200] Yeah.
              [1201] ... He lives in Bradford, my goodness what a choice.
              [1202] ... James Wattana
Steve (PS09G) [1203] In Bradford now is he?
Frank (PS09E) [1204] Yeah.
              [1205] ... Must like the food up there I should think.
              [1206] ... Ah that was a brave shot.
Steve (PS09G) [1207] Well [...] ... they don't have a ... test signal then. ...

Frank (PS09E) [1208] Mm.
              [1209] Seems to have a bit of a [...]
Steve (PS09G) [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1210] Tried a tape in it?
Steve (PS09G) [1211] No. ...
Frank (PS09E) [1212] Just for a joke.
Steve (PS09G) [1213] Just sending out a pulse on them ... [...] stopped there.
Frank (PS09E) [1214] You can always [...] the tape ... [...] ... It's actually
              running.
              [1215] ... That mains lead in front of you ... wants plugging in.
Steve (PS09G) [1216] Ah.
              [1217] ... Ah right.
              [1218] Stop, stop, stop
Frank (PS09E) [1219] Mm.
              [1220] ... I really should er phone Breezy up and call his bluff
              and find out ...
Steve (PS09G) [1221] Which of these is [...] tuner?
Frank (PS09E) [1222] That's it.
              [1223] ... Yeah you run the tape don't you to tune these in.
              [1224] Run it without a tape I think it is to get the test
              signal.
              [1225] Still
Steve (PS09G) [1226] Oh is it?
Frank (PS09E) [1227] you'll find it that way anyway won't you? ...
Steve (PS09G) [1228] Should go all the way up and then back down shouldn't it?
              [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1229] Yeah they do no they do go round.
              [1230] ... Pretty sure they do anyway, [...] ... Blinking slow
              innit that direction?
              [1231] Or is it blinks fast in the other direction?
Steve (PS09G) [1232] Oh I see.
              [1233] Ah.
Frank (PS09E) [1234] One of them is a fast tune.
              [1235] That's it, that's fast tune. ...

Steve (PS09G) [1239] [...] I mean there's no [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1240] Yeah, I know you can feel those there, they're just more
              or less flush with the heads.
              [1241] ... Perhaps [...] we could try another one and see er
Steve (PS09G) [1242] Are all heads the same [...]
Frank (PS09E) [cough]
Steve (PS09G) [...] ...
Frank (PS09E) [1243] Well it's the later type innit, that one?
Steve (PS09G) [1244] It's just that a lot of the heads have worn they
Frank (PS09E) [1245] Mm
Steve (PS09G) [1246] don't look to bad.
Frank (PS09E) [1247] Oh that's quite a tidy looking one as well innit? ...
Steve (PS09G) [1248] Yeah [...] worth switching on anyway, quite a few of them
              have got these er carriages in?
Frank (PS09E) [1249] No well they're not sure if that's the whole carriage but
              ...
Steve (PS09G) [1250] Quite a few have got them in.
Frank (PS09E) [1251] See what they look like on this one.
              [1252] ... Oh it's a different ki different, totally different
              innit that one?
              [1253] It's got nothing underneath that one has it?
              [1254] ... If that bit can, you know, that's fixed ... there's
              nothing for the ... unless the tape just slides and sits
Steve (PS09G) [1255] On the plastic.
Frank (PS09E) [1256] on the plastic.
              [1257] Probably it does. ...
Steve (PS09G) [1258] Plug it in and find out shall I?
Frank (PS09E) [1259] Yeah.
              [1260] ... [laugh] Looks quite tiny that one doesn't it?
              [1261] We might've been, might be pleasantly surprised with
              these.
Steve (PS09G) [1262] [laughing] Yeah [] ... [...] ...
Frank (PS09E) [1263] Right ah ... I'm gonna have a delve and see if I can find
              a similar model.

              closely, there's nothing there at all.
              [1269] It's the same type as this type.
Steve (PS09G) [1270] Yeah.

Lyn (PS09F)                          [1361] That's it and then it should slide

                                     it's dangerous.
Lyn (PS09F)                          [1369] You can cut yourself even when it's
                                     not cos this is so sharp.
Jonny (PS09M)                        [1370] You've gotta be very careful.
Lyn (PS09F)                          [1371] Yeah, put the cover back on just in
                                     case, cos you can cut yourself, it's never
                                     been used much and it's really like new

                                     there?
Jonny (PS09M)                        [1457] Oh yeah.

Jonny (PS09M)                        [1463] But the screw on the top ... cos I
                                     can only screw [...]

Jonny (PS09M)                        [1467] I'm just seeing if I can get these
                                     two shelves out.
Lyn (PS09F)                          [1468] Well you give it a good bash then.
                                     ... [banging]
Jonny (PS09M)                        [1469] Look I'm turning it that way.

Frank (PS09E)                        [1473] I don't think it's fixed to the
                                     ceiling actually that, I think it's just
                                     purely a ... a framework bol
Lyn (PS09F)                          [...]

Jonny (PS09M)                        [1475] It's only a piece of wood that's
                                     ... do you know what that is?
                                     [1476] ... That's only ...
Lyn (PS09F)                          [1477] So you could take the framework off
                                     the front
Frank (PS09E)                        [1478] Yeah I think that's just
Lyn (PS09F)                          [1479] which leaves the superstructure on
                                     [...]

                                     wondering whether you might use a part of

Jonny (PS09M)                        [1500] Do you know that's only wall ...

              got a bit of a battle going on with SWET
Frank (PS09E) [1577] [laughing] Have you [] ?
Brian (PS09N) [1578] Yeah because they, they're ... y you know the Copper
              Dollar?
Frank (PS09E) [1579] Mm.
Brian (PS09N) [1580] Well they're taking all the power lines down in the
              village, or down through that part of the village which, fair
              enough, gets rid of the eyesore ... but they're gonna put now a
              bloody big transformer,abou thing about seven, eight foot bloody
              tall in, in the field ... right on the Copper Dollar
Frank (PS09E) [1581] Right.
Brian (PS09N) [1582] and originally they were gonna er mount it on the wall up
              against his lawn area where
Frank (PS09E) [1583] Mm
Brian (PS09N) [1584] people and all sit out erm ... the landlord turned round
              and said no way hos, I'm not having it there sort of thing.
              [1585] Of course then they change their attitude SWET said well
              alright we'll put it right down there in the corner.
              [1586] Now right down in the corner, bearing in mind my parents'
              garden shall we say is there and the field height is there
Frank (PS09E) [1587] Mm
Brian (PS09N) [1588] so the thing's gonna tower above their blooming
Frank (PS09E) [1589] Yeah
Brian (PS09N) [1590] wall for a start, plus the hum ... you get from these
              bloody things, in other words basically, as my parents spend a
              lot of time up in their top garden in the summer time, in the
              sunshine and all, you get the continual hum from that bloody
Frank (PS09E) [1591] Yeah.
Brian (PS09N) [1592] thing ... and I had a blazing row with them on the
              telephone
Frank (PS09E) [1593] And there's enough hums in the countryside without that.

              cancel it off the screen, I thought it was there always.
Steve (PS09G) [1689] Ah!
              [1690] So that's the right hand set for that one.

Frank (PS09E) [1693] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [1694] and these aren't so expensive, but I mean these we know
              are fifteen so these have gotta be twenty five, twenty six quid
Frank (PS09E) [1695] Mm.
Steve (PS09G) [1696] so he said it's across the board [...] put four thousand
              quid's worth off him the other day and I only give fifty pence
              off he said so I can't do much for you.
Frank (PS09E) [1697] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [1698] So he gets it at four quid but [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1699] Yes.
              [1700] Yeah.

Steve (PS09G) [1710] [...] ... Brand new Toshiba hand sets, give him the model
              number.
Frank (PS09E) [1711] The only problem is you see I'd like to try and get more
              Toshibas off him.
              [1712] He might sell a lot more if he had the hand units.
Steve (PS09G) [1713] That's true.
Frank (PS09E) [1714] We might be
Steve (PS09G) [1715] Toshibas do sell well don't they?

              [1756] Otherwise he can just give them with the bloody tellies or
              trying to buy them with the tellies and the dealers have a lovely
              time
Frank (PS09E) [1757] Well yes.
Steve (PS09G) [1758] Well he could charge a tenner and the dealers would be
              happy wouldn't they?
Frank (PS09E) [1759] Oh yeah.
              [1760] He would too.
Steve (PS09G) [1761] Yeah.

Steve (PS09G) [1771] after a little while.
              [1772] ... Well [...] those Toshibas go with a bit more of a
              swing, they were a blooming nuisance before.
              [1773] I wanna try it on a [...] one to see if anything's working

Steve (PS09G) [...] ...
Frank (PS09E) [1817] Had to laugh yesterday towards the end of er our round, it
              was really tipping down, misty, fog, couldn't see a hundred yards
              ... I had this almighty s I said well I'll let the six iron, I
              did this almighty swing ... the ball went one way and the club
              went right up the top of a tree.
              [1818] It must've been fifteen foot at least up in the air ...
              teetering on a top branch.
Steve (PS09G) [laugh]
Frank (PS09E) [1819] I thought oh my god, lost me six iron, all of a sudden
              crash, it came down.
Steve (PS09G) [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1820] Old Louis he didn't know which way anything had gone.
              [1821] He said well I couldn't see any of that ... didn't even
              see the club go up the tree. ...
Steve (PS09G) [1822] [...] different hand set works the black stripe.
Frank (PS09E) [1823] Does it?
              [1824] ... What one of Alistair's?
Steve (PS09G) [1825] Yeah, does it work everything though?
              [1826] Doesn't work that does it?
              [1827] No, it works the text ... doesn't work the ... colour
              [...] the on screen display, one of them, innit? ... and one of
              them ... and that ... er and that.
              [1828] ... That one didn't work either [...] ... gonna try and
              ... there's no on screen display on these is there?
              [1829] So [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1830] Shouldn't think s
Steve (PS09G) [1831] won't work will it?
              [1832] This type.
              [1833] So these are the only ones we can't put them with.
Frank (PS09E) [1834] Oh right.
Steve (PS09G) [1835] All the later ones we can ... but I've got a couple more
              of these ones that work this one coming anyway so ...
Frank (PS09E) [1836] But it changes channel dunnit?
              [1837] And ... does it give you volume or not?
Steve (PS09G) [1838] Changes channel and does volume I think [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1839] And [...] and everything.
Steve (PS09G) [1840] Erm ... yeah that one does [...]
Frank (PS09E) [1841] So I mean it'll do everything barring ... [...]
Steve (PS09G) [1842] No that other one doesn't
Frank (PS09E) [1843] No.
Steve (PS09G) [1844] the one we got as a ... a master text one doesn't
Frank (PS09E) [1845] No.
Steve (PS09G) [1846] but one of these would.
              [1847] That one would.
Frank (PS09E) [1848] Right. ...
Steve (PS09G) [1849] So if we want some of these as well well we ain't gonna
              get cheaper to go with these whatever happens we know that.
Frank (PS09E) [1850] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [1851] [...] albeit the wrong one.
              [1852] They have got manual settings on there haven't they?
Frank (PS09E) [1853] That's right, that's what I thought.
              [1854] I mean it's

                           [2083] I'm just wondering
Steve (PS09G)              [2084] Well I go through one of these and see what's
                           on there.
                           [2085] Have a look.
Frank (PS09E)              [2086] Forget what programmes are what on there!
Steve (PS09G)              [2087] Try these stops and [...] .
                           [2088] That's four then.
Frank (PS09E)              [2089] Ah, that is four with the [...] .

Steve (PS09G)              [...]
Frank (PS09E)              [2092] So is one or two?
Steve (PS09G)              [2093] Yeah , that's the one!
Frank (PS09E)              [2094] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G)              [2095] Well that'll work, [...] .
Frank (PS09E)              [2096] Yeah, getting it going, it's
Steve (PS09G)              [2097] Oh!
Frank (PS09E)              [2098] it wouldn't tune in, it was something to do
                           with this ... arrangement up here.
                           [2099] So, right that should
Steve (PS09G)              [2100] Yeah they did work alright, they
Frank (PS09E)              [2101] Which one's that?
Steve (PS09G)              [...]
Frank (PS09E)              [2102] Oh yeah!
                           [2103] Mm.
Steve (PS09G)              [2104] I got another set, I've got [...] just got
                           going.
Frank (PS09E)              [2105] Yeah, it's probably the erm ... ace head you
                           know on the side?
Steve (PS09G)              [2106] Oh yeah.
Frank (PS09E)              [2107] On the other si
*** 24 (Tape 041004) ***
Frank (PS09E) [2108] Have to watch the light on that.
Steve (PS09G) [2109] Aha.
              [2110] Well
Frank (PS09E) [2111] That's a lot of light coming in on the back I think.
Steve (PS09G) [2112] Yeah.
              [2113] Cut off after number fifteen with tho the top one as well
              but I'll
Frank (PS09E) [2114] Yeah.
              [2115] Oh!
Steve (PS09G) [2116] I'll turn it off and er ... try it.
Frank (PS09E) [2117] See if the counter's going up and things like that.
Steve (PS09G) [2118] Yeah, the counter's going up it's er ... electronic one.
Frank (PS09E) [2119] Yeah but even so it's ... volt
Steve (PS09G) [2120] Oh!
Frank (PS09E) [2121] volt driven.
Steve (PS09G) [2122] Forged stop?
              [2123] Oh, I wonder why it says that then?
              [2124] ... That's five seconds, reset ... then [...] .
Frank (PS09E) [cough]
Steve (PS09G) [2125] It's got that again!
Frank (PS09E) [2126] Mm!
Steve (PS09G) [2127] Record that
Frank (PS09E) [2128] Mm, it's not ... not rotating somewhere is it?
              [2129] See the caption's not turning round right, [...] .
Steve (PS09G) [2130] What's that?
              [2131] Is it anything to do with this [...] ?
              [2132] I can't drag away from it, while you're doing that.
Frank (PS09E) [2133] No, it's alright, we'll have a look.
Steve (PS09G) [2134] Do it later.
Frank (PS09E) [2135] Tube blew up.
              [2136] ... Well do they play?
              [2137] Does it play?
Steve (PS09G) [2138] It played for a little while, I didn't play it for long
              but it did play.
Frank (PS09E) [2139] Oh so, oh it switches itself off does it?
Steve (PS09G) [2140] Oh it's designed, it's giving me a fault [...] .
              [2141] See it did play.
Frank (PS09E) [2142] Taking up.
Steve (PS09G) [2143] Wasn't bad play back when I fi ... oh it's not ... not
              doing as much as it did before now!
Frank (PS09E) [2144] Then catch it.
              [2145] Can't figure out what's actually stopping.
              [2146] Oh that's this one?
Steve (PS09G) [2147] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E) [2148] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [2149] Is that the drive belt as well I think.
Frank (PS09E) [2150] Yeah, it's probably the idler wants to be cleaned in it.
Steve (PS09G) [2151] Oh.
              [2152] Right.
              [2153] Right!
              [2154] Shall I do that from the top?
Frank (PS09E) [2155] Yeah,yo you can get up this ca ... the carriage only four
              screws and erm
Steve (PS09G) [2156] Right!
Frank (PS09E) [2157] You might get at it without the er ... where's the
              instruction?
Steve (PS09G) [2158] Does that wanna go from side to side does it?
Frank (PS09E) [2159] Yeah.
              [2160] Probably.
Steve (PS09G) [2161] Okay.
Frank (PS09E) [2162] Might even get at that one there.
Steve (PS09G) [2163] Yeah.
              [2164] Right!
Frank (PS09E) [2165] Also, that one could be ... that looks very shiny too!
Steve (PS09G) [2166] Right!
              [2167] Do I do it with that pencil thing of yours or with er ...
              Amber Clean
Frank (PS09E) [2168] I'll try Amber Clean Just give it
Steve (PS09G) [2169] Right!
Frank (PS09E) [2170] a little spraying and ... and wipe it round.
*** 25 (Tape 041005) ***
Frank (PS09E) [2171] Yeah, the front just ... hinges off at the top.
Steve (PS09G) [2172] It's not at the back of the [...] here is it?
Frank (PS09E) [2173] It mi , it may do, why?
              [2174] Have you spotted something?
Steve (PS09G) [2175] Dunno if it's the second one ... down that way or not, but
              there's a crack across there.
              [2176] Or is i is it a crack or a scratch?
              [2177] ... This is the right one.
Frank (PS09E) [2178] Yeah, that's the right one.
              [2179] Oh I'll get my ... magnifier.
              [2180] ... Thing is, you're actually using, your eyes are not too
              good!
Steve (PS09G) [2181] Well I go ... get the magnifier to read the bloody ...
              magazine sometimes!
              [2182] It's ridiculous!
              [2183] I'm going back to the ... opticians with the , the new
              glasses I got are still flipping worse than these!
Frank (PS09E) [2184] No, it's just a scratch I think.
              [2185] ... Mm, somebody's been ... working on this though haven't
              they?
              [2186] The sound chip's in the wrong place.
Steve (PS09G) [2187] Crikey!
              [2188] Well this [...] is high enough!
Frank (PS09E) [2189] Yeah, it's probably worth changing the control innit, to
              see what happens?
              [2190] ... They've evidently looked ... you can see where they've
              scratched to get a screwdriver through there ... to try and get
              the sound ... the sound out.
Steve (PS09G) [2191] Couldn't you tell with the meter er ... th th th the
              control whether it's worth it or not?
Frank (PS09E) [2192] Yeah, you should be able to.
Steve (PS09G) [2193] Yeah, but I don't think the ... it'll do what you want
              [...] .
Frank (PS09E) [2194] Yeah, you'll have to.
              [2195] Mm!
Steve (PS09G) [2196] Want a se , want a screwdriver there?
Frank (PS09E) [2197] I got one there, yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [2198] [...] ?
Frank (PS09E) [2199] Yeah, I got one, yes.
Steve (PS09G) [2200] Gonna turn it as well?
Frank (PS09E) [2201] Yeah.
              [2202] If you can ... oh, let's put it on.
Steve (PS09G) [2203] [...] around from one end to the other that is.
Frank (PS09E) [2204] Yeah!
              [2205] Right!
Steve (PS09G) [2206] Right now ... one end to the other.
Frank (PS09E) [2207] Is it?
              [2208] Oh!
              [2209] Go that way.
Steve (PS09G) [2210] No.
Frank (PS09E) [2211] Well that's [...] .
              [2212] I'll get there eventually!
              [2213] That's not reading through anything that one.
Steve (PS09G) [2214] That won't read through [...] ?
Frank (PS09E) [2215] [laughing] Yeah [] , I think so.
              [2216] ... Now, one end is joined ... so ... a bit.
              [2217] Okay?
              [2218] ... Nothing!
Steve (PS09G) [2219] No.
Frank (PS09E) [2220] So it was circuit then.
              [2221] Just try the one above cos I think they're ... oh wait a
              minute!
              [2222] I'm not looking at
Steve (PS09G) [2223] You don't want to go there.
Frank (PS09E) [2224] I'm not ... [whispering] silly sod [] !
              [2225] Right!
Steve (PS09G) [2226] Right, that moves.
              [2227] ... Not much there.
Frank (PS09E) [2228] It should go right ... across at one end.
Steve (PS09G) [2229] No!
              [2230] No that's
Frank (PS09E) [2231] Oh it is open circuit then.
Steve (PS09G) [2232] Yeah, it's trying to go that
Frank (PS09E) [2233] Yeah.
Steve (PS09G) [2234] way.
Frank (PS09E) [2235] See if I reflected to this one I'll show you what the
              affect is.
Steve (PS09G) [2236] Tu turn
Frank (PS09E) [2237] Tu
Steve (PS09G) [2238] that [...] ?
Frank (PS09E) [2239] Yeah, turn that one, yep!
              [2240] Even the [...] .
              [2241] Remember where you can get it back to that's the only
              thing.
Steve (PS09G) [2242] Oh!
              [2243] Oh it's back where it was.
              [2244] [...] at one end.
Frank (PS09E) [2245] What are you doing this?
Steve (PS09G) [2246] Ah ha, let me just twiddle it.
              [2247] Hang on th ... check this up and twiddling time.
Frank (PS09E) [2248] Yeah, see this is the wiper this should ... well assure
              itself back to that one.
Steve (PS09G) [2249] Goes when you touch it there.
Frank (PS09E) [2250] Yeah, just touching the ends together.
Steve (PS09G) [2251] Oh!
Frank (PS09E) [2252] Mm!
              [2253] I'll try the other one ... cos I've got that in bits.
              [2254] ... If you can ... twiddle that one I'll er
Steve (PS09G) [2255] Yep!
Frank (PS09E) [2256] second one down.
              [2257] It ... reads totally different.
              [2258] That's it!
              [2259] Up one end ... down the other.
Steve (PS09G) [2260] More positive that one as well.
Frank (PS09E) [2261] Yeah.
              [2262] That's
Steve (PS09G) [2263] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E) [2264] what it should read like.
              [2265] So it's definitely on the circuit.
Steve (PS09G) [2266] So it's down to the chip ... and we haven't had the chance
              of being [...] .
Frank (PS09E) [2267] We might have to, we might be able to get away without
              having to take the board out, if I ... if I use the old de-
              solderer ... might be able to just hook it out and put the next
              one in.
              [2268] ... Yeah but yo , that's what they did change, you looking
              for the fault?
Steve (PS09G) [2269] Yeah.
              [2270] ... [singing] Mm mm mm mm mm mm [] ... Ah ah!
              [2271] ... What was that in the [...] ?
              [2272] I fo forgot now!
Frank (PS09E) [2273] Oh Feverack
Steve (PS09G) [2274] Oh yeah!
Frank (PS09E) [2275] Oh!
Steve (PS09G) [2276] Oh don't!

Frank (PS09E) [2279] Oh yeah?
              [2280] Do you know this bloody thing's jammed in the works
              somewhere, this control, it's fallen over!
              [2281] It won't come out!
              [2282] Swine!
Steve (PS09G) [2283] What a duff!
Frank (PS09E) [2284] Oi!
              [2285] [sighing] Oh [] !
Steve (PS09G) [2286] Oh I thought it was crack, it was only a hair anyway!
              [laugh]
Frank (PS09E) [2287] Oh is it?
Steve (PS09G) [2288] Brushed it off.
              [2289] [...] have to come off with it.
Frank (PS09E) [2290] Mm.
Steve (PS09G) [2291] Oh that's probably what's wrong is it, oh?
Frank (PS09E) [2292] Don't e [...] too much!
              [2293] Just ... Got the control out anyway!

Jonny (PS09M) [2323] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E) [2324] you could wind that up.

Jonny (PS09M) [2327] Yes!

Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2948] Cheap!
*** 30 (Tape 041104) ***
Frank (PS09E)              [2949] And he dropped in a twenty seven inch Sony
                           this morning.
                           [2950] But it took ... should of taken four of us to
                           lift it really but
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2951] Somebody dropped one of them?
Frank (PS09E)              [2952] Yeah.
                           [2953] It was a struggle for two of us to get it out
                           of the car and ... weigh a ton don't they those?
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2954] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E)              [2955] It's only the tube isn't it, where the weight
                           is on those?
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2956] Well ... [...] .

Frank (PS09E)              [2963] Is it?

                           that, that one's gone.
                           [2967] Sue wrecked it for us!
Frank (PS09E)              [2968] Oh!
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2969] Oh I'll do it myself.

                           [2971] Think I've got one of them, yeah.
*** 31 (Tape 041105) ***
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2972] In fact this particular chassis I've never
                           had er ... never done any work on.
                           [2973] That's why you said about that mod just now
                           it's er ... it's all green to me!
                           [2974] I mean I'll, I'll have to find out about
                           that.
                           [2975] What I'll probably do is try and get some
                           running, I'll take that one and that one
Frank (PS09E)              [2976] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2977] er, and then bring them back when they're
                           ready.
                           [2978] But if
Frank (PS09E)              [2979] Right.
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2980] this one don't go either I'll probably take
                           off of there.
                           [2981] Er ... oh I got my [...] didn't I?
                           [2982] That's the last of that.
Frank (PS09E)              [2983] [laughing] Right [] !
                           [2984] Get some more of those.
*** 32 (Tape 041106) ***
Frank (PS09E)              [2985] Keep us amused in the winter months, er ...
                           it's er ... gone quiet.
                           [2986] I say, they're both the same board.
                           [2987] That one's fixed.
Unknown speaker (KC1PSUNK) [2988] So is that one.
Frank (PS09E)              [2989] Yeah,th th th the guy thought it was erm ...
                           spot killer circuit fault but it's not a monitor
                           fault.
Lyn (PS09F)                [2990] Yes I know that, yeah.
Frank (PS09E)              [2991] Cos one board works differently than the
                           other.
Lyn (PS09F)                [2992] Does it?
                           [2993] This is the same board you say?
Frank (PS09E)              [2994] Same game, yeah.
Lyn (PS09F)                [2995] And er, it says the fault on both so we keep
Frank (PS09E)              [2996] Er er, two two different faults.
                           [2997] This will shut you down to a spot ... will
                           take
Lyn (PS09F)                [2998] And
Frank (PS09E)              [2999] the scan away
Lyn (PS09F)                [3000] and then it's that, that's that board?
Frank (PS09E)              [3001] That's that one.
Lyn (PS09F)                [3002] Yeah.
Frank (PS09E)              [3003] And the other one, I think, when it shuts
                           down ... it's just sort of se ... a semi-sa er scan
                           ... [...] .

                           remote ... I think a remote one went out yesterday.
