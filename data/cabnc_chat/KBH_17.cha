*CAR:	Well yes, but I mean it's  she seems to do the opposite thing to Charlotte, cos she used to sleep in the morning and fidget around in the afternoons  and this one fidgets all morning and then sleeps in the afternoon. •218607_220012•
*PAT:	Yes, well •220012_220082•
*CAR:	Which is which is quite handy I suppose. •220147_220317•
*PAT:	And then is she awake in the evening? •220317_220444•
*CAR:	Yeah. •220444_220501•
*PAT:	Yeah  well that's not so bad as long as you can get her down at a reasonable hour and get to sleep. •220569_221207•
*CAR:	Yeah  well she  she sleeps she goes down some time between eight thirty and eleven. •221207_221959•
*PAT:	Mm. •221959_221996•
*CAR:	But I think what she does she confuses her early and late evening  feeds •222084_222577•
*PAT:	Mm. •222715_222761•
*CAR:	so they merge as as sort of one solid feed  •222798_223207•
*PAT:	Yeah. •223207_223246•
*CAR:	all evening  but then like last night see if I know that she's been chomping on and off all night she'll go for four or five hours. •223319_224259•
*PAT:	Mm. •224292_224325•
*CAR:	Or five or six hours  •224362_224484•
*PAT:	Yeah. •224488_224500•
*CAR:	at night. •224575_224600•

*PAT:	Mm. •225820_225853•
*CAR:	and it's sort of well it's not well they do get full that's if she suddenly does longer than •225877_226482•
*PAT:	Mm. •226482_226504•
*CAR:	she's been doing. •226538_226614•

*CAR:	Yes  yeah  well I've got two ounces in the freezer. •227438_227829•
*PAT:	Oh have you, oh well it's something I suppose. •227829_228095•
*CAR:	Yes, well if I can do a few two ounces worth I put them all together and then Adam can give her a little bit. •228095_228758•

*CAR:	Cos I don't tend to get the opportunity. •229293_229524•

*CAR:	Cos she starts fidgeting  go and hang this lot up I suppose  Want to come upstairs? •229580_230650•
*PAT:	Yes, I'll come upstairs   That's a nice bread then isn't it? •230650_231122•

*PAT:	Oh  that's a shame. •232443_232675•
*CAR:	Yes dropped by a certain clumsy person around this house  unfortunately we've had a lot of breakages. •232675_233421•
*PAT:	Oh dear. •233421_233606•
*CAR:	Yeah  never mind  So Adam said buy something that doesn't break. •233606_234430•
