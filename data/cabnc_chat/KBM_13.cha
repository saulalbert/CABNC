*DAV:	erm  check all your speed limits  •_•
*CHR:	driving along, keep to the left except when road signals or markings indicate otherwise or when you intend to overtake, or turn right, or when you have to pass stationery vehicles or pedestrians in the road, allow others to overtake you if they want you, you must not drive on  by the side of the road. •_•
        Use your mirrors, on narrow or winding roads or where there is a lot of oncoming traffic, drivers of large or slow moving vehicles should be prepared to pull in and slow down to stop as soon as there is suitable opportunity, well, before you take off or turn left or turn right, or slow down or stop, use your mirrors, you should always look behind even if they're none, a motor cycle should always look behind either, then give the appropriate signal if necessary , remember the routine •_•
*DAV:	yes •_•
*CHR:	what? •_•
*DAV:	reverse, signal and manoeuvre  •_•
*CHR:	always keep a special look out for cyclists particularly when overtaking or turning, bearing in mind that two wheels are much less easy to see than large vehicles. •_•
        Driving for long distances may make you sleepy, to help prevent this make sure there is plenty of fresh air in your vehicle, if you become tired on the journey, stop and rest at a suitable parking place , right. •_•
        You must obey the speed limits for the road and for your vehicle, remember the, except the motorways there is a thirty mile per hour speed limit on all roads, where there are streets unless sign show otherwise. •_•
        Bear in mind that any speed limit is a maximum, it does not mean that it is safe to drive at that speed, always take into account all the conditions at the time, never drive so fast that you cannot stop well within the distance you can see to be clear. •_•
        Go much more slowly if the road is wet or icy or first  drive more slowly at night, remember it can be especially difficult to see pedestrians or cyclists at night and in poor daylight conditions, do not break, sharply, except in an emergency. •_•
        Leave enough space between you and the vehicle in front so that you can pull up safely if it slows down or stops suddenly, the safe rule is never to get closer than the overall stopping distance shown below, but on the open road in good conditions leave a gap of one metre for each mile an hour of your speed or a two second time gap may be enough, they will also leave space for an overtaking vehicle pulling or wet or icy or the gap should be at least double that, drop back if you know that taking vehicle closing gap in front of you  make way for ambulance, fire engines, police or van emergency vehicles when their blue lamps are flashing or their bells, two tone cones or sirens or . •_•

*CHR:	what you do   when driving in fog check your  •_•
*DAV:	speed, yes •_•
*CHR:	and slow down, keep a safe distance, you should always be able to pull up within your range of vision , what else don't you do, what don't you do in fog? •_•
*DAV:	overtake •_•
*CHR:	hang on to somebody elses tail lights, it gives us a false sense of security  watch your speed, you may be going much faster than you think, do not speed up to get away from the vehicle which is too close behind you, remember that if you're driving with heavy people it may take longer to pull up and speed on ahead, warning signals or   •_•
*DAV:	 ((clears throat)) 
*CHR:	check and clean your wind screens, lights, reflectors and windows  remember that fog can give  is often patchy  •_•

*CHR:	what you do when amber light flashing? after the stop  •_•
*DAV:	stop stop at the  line stop behind the line  •_•
*CHR:	you must give way to any pedestrians on the crossing, so, otherwise you may proceed   a straight pelican is one crossing even when there is a central refuge and you must wait for people crossing from the further side of the refuge, don't harass the pedestrians for instance by revving your engine. •_•
        When turning into a road junction, give way to   what's a road junction? •_•
*DAV:	like a  coming out •_•
*CHR:	oh, give way to •_•
*DAV:	traffic coming out •_•
*CHR:	pedestrians who are crossing the road in which you are turning   when entering or emerging from property bordering on a road, give way to pedestrians as well as the traffic on the road, remember pavements are for people, not for motor cycles  motor vehicles  •_•
*DAV:	is it here? •_•
*CHR:	I don't take . •_•
        Lines and lanes along the road. •_•
        A single broken line with long markings and short gaps in the middle of the road is the   •_•
*DAV:	what lines? •_•
*CHR:	single broken lines with long markings and short gaps with the middle, in the middle of the road is the  hazard warning lines, do not cross it unless you can see that the road well ahead is clear. •_•
        Where there are double white lines along the  •_•
*DAV:	give way  •_•
*CHR:	road and the line nearer to you is solid, you must not cross or straddle it, except when you need to get in and out of the premises on side road. •_•
        Where there are double white lines along the road and the line nearer to you is broken, you may cross the lines to overtake if you . •_•
        Overtaking, give us some, do not overtake unless you can  do so without  •_•
*DAV:	slow motors down or causes  •_•
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	I was just gonna say   •_•
*CHR:	before you start overtaking make sure the road is clear, use your mirror, signal before you move out  •_•
*DAV:	signal, then move out  •_•
*CHR:	be careful in the dusk, remember mirror, signal, manoeuvre  once you start to overtake move quickly passed the vehicle you are overtaking, when overtake er, overtake only on the right except when the driver in the front has signalled that he intends to turn right, you can overtake him on the left, without getting in the way, when you want to turn left at a junction, when traffic is moving slowly in queues and be er, in a lane on the right and moving more slowly than you are, in one way streets, but not dual carriageways, maybe with a path on either side, when traffic is moving as described, do not increase your speed while being overtaken, slow down if necessary to let the overtaking vehicle pass. •_•
        On the tail, lane road, give way to vehicles coming towards you  you must not overtake if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a solid line on the out of you, erm if you're within a zig zag area, the pelican crossing, after a normal overtaking sign until the end of the restriction, do not overtake when you cannot see far enough ahead, for example, when coming through  •_•
*DAV:	bend •_•
*CHR:	a corner or bend  •_•
*DAV:	single traffic, single line traffic •_•
*CHR:	hump back bridge  or the brow of the hill, or where you might come into conflict with the car, with other road users for example at  •_•
*DAV:	junctions •_•
*CHR:	the road junction  •_•
*DAV:	roundabout •_•
*CHR:	don't say that   a level crossing or where the road narrows, on approached any type of pedestrian crossing or where it would involve driving over an area marked with diagonal stripes to or chevrons, do not overtake when you do so would force another vehicle to swerve or slow down, if in doubt do not overtake   so where'd you not overtake? •_•
*DAV:	on a corner •_•
*CHR:	or •_•
*DAV:	hump backed bridge •_•
*CHR:	mm •_•
*DAV:	round a bend, junction •_•
*CHR:	yeah, •_•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	at a level , at a level crossing or where the road bends, or approach to any pedestrian crossing. •_•
        Road junctions. •_•
        Approach road junctions with great care, consider your road position and your speed, drive on only when you are sure it is safe to do so and that you will not block the junction, watch out for long vehicles which maybe turning left or right, at the junction ahead, but which may have to use  to make a turn, when waiting to emerge at a junction, do not assume that a vehicle approaching from the right which is signalling with it's left hand direction indicator would turn left, wait to make sure  do you know what I mean? •_•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	that, if you leave and that car comes and signals left, it means that you've got to wait for it to go in, in case it doesn't you know what I mean. •_•
        At a junction with double broken white lines across the road it •_•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	may also have the give way sign on inverted triangle on the carriageway, you must be ready to let traffic on the major road go first. •_•
        At junctions with a stop sign and a solid white line across your approach, you must stop at the line, wait for a safe gap in the traffic before you move. •_•
        When crossing the dual carriageway or turning right into the road, treat each half as a separate road, wait •_•
*DAV:	do you know what it means by that? •_•
*CHR:	in the central driving, dividing strip  •_•
*DAV:	do you know what that means •_•
*CHR:	until there is a safe gap •_•
*DAV:	do you know what  •_•
*CHR:	it means you come to turn right on  road, and each  •_•
*DAV:	it's er  •_•
*CHR:	lanes a separate road doesn't it? •_•
*DAV:	you know when you come, you know when you and nanny drop us off at ours •_•
*CHR:	aha •_•
*DAV:	and there's a slip road you've gotta come on to, there's a slip road you go down ain't there? •_•
*CHR:	aha •_•
*DAV:	you slowly make your way out, don't got by, you look over your right shoulder •_•
*CHR:	aha •_•
*DAV:	that's erm, that's a slip road what you, and then, your next lane you stay in that lane, only use a right and then if you want to overtake you go into right and then back into right •_•
*CHR:	oh •_•
*DAV:	I mean never stay in the right hand lane •_•
*CHR:	why? •_•
*DAV:	because you overtake is speeding there, the left hand lane isn't, the right hand lane is for overtaking •_•
*CHR:	what happens at our speed? •_•
*DAV:	well you stick on the right hand lane when no one overtaking  that's not causing trouble for us is it? •_•
*CHR:	Where a junction has a mini roundabout, it will have a sign placed before the give way. •_•
        Boxed junctions have criss cross yellow lines painted on the road. •_•
        You must not enter the box  •_•
*DAV:	you stay behind it •_•
*CHR:	if your exit road or lane from, from is not clear, but you may enter the box when you want to turn right and are prevented from doing so. •_•
        Junctions controlled by police or a traffic warden, when all traffic is held up by police officer or traffic warden you must not go left or right until you are signalled to do so. •_•
        Junctions controlled by traffic lights  do not go forward when the traffic lights are green unless there is room for you to clear the junction safely, never go forward when the red, amber lights are shown together, when traffic lights have a green arrow filter signal, do not get into the lane when filtering is allowed unless you . •_•
        Well, before you turn right use your mirror to make sure you know the position on movement of the traffic behind you. •_•
        When it is safe, give a right turn signal and as soon as you can do so take safely, take up position just left of the middle of the road or in the space marked by right turned vehicles, if you can leave room for other vehicles to pass on the left, wait until there is a safe gap between you and any oncoming vehicle, looking, look out of sight for motor cyclists and pedestrians, then make a turn, but do not cut the corner as people like pedestrians crossing the road in which you are turning. •_•
        Remember mirror, signal, manoeuvre. •_•
        When approaching a roundabout   I'm not testing you any more •_•
*DAV:	I was laughing at her, that fake thing she's got on it •_•
*CHR:	I'm not testing you any more •_•
*DAV:	I'll test you then  •_•
*CHR:	What's the   •_•
*DAV:	you know carriage a single carriage way? •_•
*CHR:	mm •_•
*DAV:	now a  a dual carriage way that has three lanes, what lane do you use? •_•
*CHR:	the left  •_•
*DAV:	right, what one you use for overtaking? •_•
*CHR:	mm? •_•
*DAV:	what one you use for overtaking? •_•
*CHR:	right •_•
*DAV:	middle lane •_•
*CHR:	all three lanes is the taught now, middle  •_•
*DAV:	middle lane, you never stay in it either •_•
*CHR:	so what's the last  •_•
*DAV:	it's just  •_•
*CHR:	one for? •_•
*DAV:	turn right •_•
*CHR:	turn, aye •_•
*DAV:	see the one   •_•
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	like, you know, on the opposite side of the road, you've got as much right to use that as he has  •_•
*CHR:	right  •_•
*DAV:	on a single carriageway where a road has four, four lanes, do not use •_•
*CHR:	on a single carriageway where a lane has got four lanes •_•
*DAV:	yeah, if a single carriageway or has four more lanes, do not use the right hand path, you use that one and that one, but don't use them two •_•
*CHR:	why?er, if  plain English that right in it? •_•
*DAV:	it's the same, same as er three way one •_•
*CHR:	so you've gotto take on fast moving traffic or turn right?right are we asking some more questions?, •_•
        I don't know that much really, I don't know  •_•
*DAV:	right •_•
*CHR:	I  •_•
*DAV:	I'm gonna ask you some stopping distances •_•
*CHR:	I don't know them •_•
*DAV:	well you're gonna learn them, cos you've got, they, they ask you straight away that    a built up area •_•
*CHR:	mm? •_•

*DAV:	it'll have a speed , your national speed limit will be sixty •_•
*CHR:	but you don't do it •_•
*DAV:	it's a single, it's a two, it's only a single lane traffic car  •_•
*CHR:	what? •_•

*CHR:	no the   •_•

*CHR:	that's  what mile do you do on it?, like some people might think the national speed limit, but it's not that's fifty or sixty  •_•

*DAV:	it's seventy like it's a dual carriageway  •_•
*CHR:	well it tells you and if it's any less than seventy •_•
*DAV:	no, I'm sure one of you says it was seventy for the coast road, it's only a two way traffic  •_•

*DAV:	one, as soon as you get, well you've gotta work out what your speed is then, break, break your speed down to your stopping distance, say it's thirty, you wannae stop slowing down at  forty five feet  right, that's what you have to know  erm  •_•
*CHR:	well Darren you're cramming too much in me head right now •_•
*DAV:	well ask me some then •_•

*CHR:	how? •_•
*DAV:	twenty mile an hour right •_•

*CHR:	so how'd ya work it out? •_•
*LYN:	at seventy mile it should be your hundred and forty feet •_•
*CHR:	shouldn't have  •_•
*DAV:	no you shouldn't it should be three hundred and fifteen, the overall length, seventy is your think, thinking distance for that is seventy and your stopping distance should be two, four, five •_•
*CHR:	how'd ya work it out Darren, you gonna tell us or not? •_•
*DAV:	it's so simple •_•
