*PS02H:	but you had a eight to finish with which is finishing and a one two three might not be and a better run so I think I would have been tempted to finish with the ace flush there try and stop me rather than trying to win it cos you had nothing else did you No you did n't have you did n't have a finishing hand you did n't really have a brilliant first two hands and then the pick of the one two three bouncer I might I might have been persuaded to play the one two three bouncer and hope that that got through but to finish with an ace flush but good .  375973_438943
