*CHR:	Yep. •353972_354172•
        Right. •356022_356222•
        Presumably kicking the opponent's ball, it's, it's not acceptable. •357402_361372•
*DAV:	, it's not a fault, the only time it's a fault is when you're erm, I don't know the words really, when you're actually in play, so if you were to take a, if you were actually doing this •361402_373222•
*CHR:	Is that right? •375392_376452•

*DAV:	It's actually taken. •379562_390802•
*CHR:	I understand, yes. •390872_393432•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes. •393572_393702•
*DAV:	, I'm still in play as it were, and I do that then it's . •394732_397902•
*CHR:	Right, right, I see. •398442_399512•
*DAV:	But it's not a fault if you, erm, sort of walk up to that ball and erm, do this, it's not a fault. •399512_408542•
*CHR:	No, I see. •408542_409102•
*DAV:	O K? •409382_409642•
