*PS0EE:	but I think .  473055_473835
*PS0EB:	I think I think actually I think they will try to do something actually because if they if they do away with the loans thing .  473835_480875
*PS0EH:	Yeah .  481505_481805
*PS0EB:	they 'll have to try do something wo n't they .  481945_484095
*PS0EH:	I know the way I know but .  484395_486115
*PS0EB:	To be honest .  486115_486645
*PS0EH:	you do n't it 's not going to be you .  486915_489555
*KCEPSUN:	0 . 
*PS0EH:	just because you vote for Labour .  489555_491045
*PS0EB:	oh no no it 's not no .  491045_491615
*PS0EE:	No I mean of course not .  491615_492705
*PS0EH:	and then they ca n't say alright oh students give them hundred pound a week he give them none give them none .  492705_499465
*PS0EB:	no they ca n't do that because of the state of the economy .  499465_502145
*PS0EH:	and then if .  502145_502565
*PS0EE:	I know that but .  502565_502905
*PS0EH:	You 've got to be realistic like ai n't you .  502905_504065
*PS0EE:	but surely but surely I mean surely they 'll be able to restore the housing benefit .  504065_509335
*PS0EB:	Well hopefully they 'll be able to do something .  509335_511485
*PS0EE:	Well it says in that in that thing I 've got they 're gon na restore a fair system of grants .  511535_517425
*PS0EB:	Yeah .  517425_517725
*PS0EE:	of grants that 's that 's the thing I looked at it did n't say a fair grant .  518005_522345
*PS0EB:	No .  522535_522595
*PS0EE:	it said grants .  522595_523765
*PS0ED:	Yeah .  523765_523925
*PS0EE:	so I mean even if they do n't bring in oh the housing benefit .  524125_528975
*PS0EB:	But I mean .  528975_529185
*PS0EE:	they 'll bring in something a housing grant .  529185_531145
*PS0EB:	you know I mean on .  531145_531665
*PS0EH:	to to my to my mind when .  531665_532625
*PS0EB:	on April the tenth they 're not going to be able to go .  532625_534885
*PS0ED:	No when they hear it all day .  535465_536815
*PS0EB:	oh you know that 's that 's it because for thirteen years they have dismantled the social system that 's what they 've done in thirteen years so they ca n't say overnight we 'll put it all back because there is n't there there is n't the finance there because they 've spent it all to have done what they 've done .  536815_555595
*PS0ED:	Yeah .  555595_555705
*PS0EB:	because they 've sold everything off like gas and electricity and everything and all the resources they 've got for it they 've spent to supplement everything else so the money wo n't be there and and the income from the electricity and that is n't going to the Government it 's going to private enterprise .  556175_577205
*PS0EE:	Yeah .  578425_578625
*PS0EB:	so so it 's not gon na be there and unfortunately it 's going to take a while because we 're in such a deep recession and recession is bad and it 's not getting any better .  578625_591045
*PS0EE:	Yeah it wo n't .  591045_591495
*KCEPSUN:	0 . 
*PS0EE:	any more .  591495_592625
*PS0EH:	What .  592665_593065
*PS0EB:	It it 'll take a long time before it starts to buck up .  593175_596495
*PS0EH:	Why why do they say that for the election it will take them three or four years to put whatever they promise into operation .  596495_604415
*PS0EB:	Yeah to put it right to start to put it right .  604415_607005
*PS0EE:	Well they 're they 're education promises are we 'll do this within two years we 'll do this within .  607005_611765
*PS0EH:	Yeah .  611765_611865
*PS0EE:	three years .  611865_612165
*PS0EB:	yeah well I mean they 'll want to and they 've got .  612165_614465
*PS0EH:	within three years you 're leaving .  614465_615845
*PS0EB:	Yeah but they 've got .  616485_617235
*PS0ED:	They 've got to help people like me but I do n't know .  617235_618685
*PS0EB:	they 've got to try and show .  618685_620425
*PS0EH:	what you should n't think .  620425_621385
*PS0EB:	that they are doing something .  621385_622375
*PS0EE:	You should just you this is what I 'm trying to tell .  622375_624145
*PS0EH:	you should n't think what 's it going to do to me .  624145_625515
*PS0EE:	this is what I 'm trying to tell everybody at school you should n't be thinking oh how 's it gon na effect me what I 'll do if .  625515_630895
*PS0EH:	No .  630895_631195
*PS0EB:	No because you should help think of a society as whole .  631195_634635
*PS0EE:	because that this is the I said to this kid the other day he goes oh like Ian was arguing with them when I went in .  634655_640015
*PS0EH:	Yeah .  640015_640145
*PS0EE:	and he was going oh all what the Tories have n't done for you and he goes and what are Labour gon na do for us I goes well they 'll improve the grant to start off with he goes well it wo n't be in time to benefit us I goes well you should n't just be thinking about yourself .  640145_652435
*PS0EB:	No .  652435_652495
*PS0EH:	No that 's the trouble with people .  652495_654745
*PS0EB:	Yeah .  654745_655165
*PS0EE:	They 're just they 're just bothered about about themselves .  655165_657145
*PS0ED:	Everyone everyone thinks of themselves it 's like on their all them people who are under that certain amount they 're all gon na be going oh well in here .  657145_663105
*PS0EH:	Yeah .  663105_663605
*PS0ED:	we 'll vote for them then .  663605_664425
*PS0EH:	Yeah .  664425_664655
*PS0ED:	and people do that do n't they .  665245_666625
*PS0EE:	Well it 's like it 's like Richard today he goes well what well what are Labour gon na do for us So I goes well they 'll probably they 'll probably erm er give better grants and restore erm er housing benefit of sorts whatever happens .  666625_683347
*PS0EB:	Well is he going to university .  683347_687297
