*DON:	How important could you from this work of making known this father's name and kingdom, he said to his disciples   [reading] my food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work   [] why did Jesus consider God's work to be as important as school?It was because the kingdom there's the means by which God will fulfil his wonderful purposes for mankind, for humankind, it is this kingdom that will destroy all wickedness and will clear Jehovah's name of the reproach that has been brought upon it.So Jesus never held back for making known God's name and kingdom.He always spoke the truth whether it was popular or not, he lo loves provided an example and we should follow if we want to please God.
*DON:	Why did Jesus consider his work so important? (.) My food is
*DON:	My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	yes, without little food nobody can live can they?
*DON:	No
*DON:	And yet Jesus felt that it was ju equally important as having food
*DON:	Yes
*DON:	think about this kingdom and to finish his work, do not, you will, while eat a lot you know what he meant by finishes his work
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	so erm, we ask, what did Jesus never hold back on doing?

*DON:	Well er, you never hold er, you always
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	the truth   (.) erm, oh you never, never hold back and make be known in God's name the kingdom, he always told the truth whether it was popular or not, that's really, so erm   (.) come on you, are you going out with Clare, come on, hey, come on, come on Pip, go on, go on
*DON:	We've just got this one paragraph, before we go to the next sub-heading erm, then we'll close there shall we?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	yes make it possible first to gain everlasting life under the rule of God's kingdom, Jesus had to pour out his
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	as two apostles of Jesus said   [reading] we've been declared righteous now by his word, the boy of Jesus God's son  [] 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Come here then 
*DON:	so an important reason why Jesus came to
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Pip 
*DON:	was to die for us, he said as soon as man came not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul for life, as a ransom in exchange for
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	but what does it mean that Jesus Christ stake his life for a ransom, why was pulling out
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	was necessary for our salvation but the question asks what, [reading] for what, what other important reasons did Jesus come to earth  [] 
*DON:	Erm   (.) oh er, to clear us all of sin
*DON:	Yeah   (.) how, how would he do that?
*DON:	Oh erm, by blood, by the blood in Jesus
*DON:	In other words
*DON:	God's son, all our sons the same
*DON:	And what would Jesus have to do for that?
*DON:	Die
*DON:	Er can explain er why, you know, why would he have to die?To cleanse us from sin, what type of sins in particular in the, would he be cleansing as at? (.) Would you
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	the paragraph?
*DON:	Erm, no, erm definitely erm I'll go with salvation
*DON:	Yes
*DON:	erm, when we've done wrong repent and
*DON:	Erm well if yes erm   (.) yes, but er there's another reason as well, there's another reason, we can't save the souls can we?By any means
*DON:	Oh no no 
*DON:	so how, how was it that Jesus saves us and had he, he'd got to die for us, what, couldn't he save us without dying because his death was, wasn't very nice by any means
*DON:	No
*DON:	so why did he have to die? (.) 
*UNK:	 (        )
