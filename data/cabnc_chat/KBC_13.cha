*AUD:	Graham Sounness, I mean he's only thirty eight!
*GOR:	Could have gone any time with   (.) with nothing through his bloody arteries!
*AUD:	Good God!But that's incred I didn't know it was that bad.
*GOR:	It was in the paper this morning.And er 
*AUD:	Goodness me!
*GOR:	Well he's a, he, he didn't smoke.
*AUD:	No.He was an athlete.
*GOR:	He's been an athlete.He obviously ate like everybody else.
*AUD:	Mm.And he 
*GOR:	I mean 
*AUD:	wasn't overweight in any way.
*GOR:	Wasn't overweight, what more   (        ) 
*AUD:	No.
*GOR:	the bloody hell do you have to do!
*AUD:	That's incredible that!
*GOR:	See they say it was a ma it's hereditary.
*AUD:	Well
*GOR:	Cos his father had a bypass didn't he?
*AUD:	Oh did he?
*GOR:	I think some other relative died er 
*AUD:	Oh.
*GOR:	youngish.
*AUD:	Yes.Oh well   (.) I bet, I think perhaps it is really. ((radio on)) (.)  ((break in tape))I know.
*GOR:	It's still going?
*AUD:	I know.Yeah, and you can't, you can't understand it can you really?Well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one!
*GOR:	That's right, yeah.Yeah.
*AUD:	And she does all her own shopping.
*GOR:	Mm.
*AUD:	You know, I mean, she keeps stopping but she's, she's remarkable!She really is.
*GOR:	Mm.
*AUD:	But they're few and far between aren't they?When th you're like that.
*GOR:	Yeah.
*AUD:	Mm.
*GOR:	But what I couldn't understand with this Soun this fella that
*AUD:	This Sounness?
*GOR:	Aye.He, he found out cos he went for, to, for a check up and they took his blood pressure.
*AUD:	Yes.
*GOR:	And tha well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken, they find it's high, and they 
*AUD:	Yes.
*GOR:	give them tablets.
*AUD:	Yes.
*GOR:	Go home.Why did they take it a stage further with him?He'd got high blood pressure, he wasn't in any pain   (.) he's living a normal life.Similar to what I was when I went.
*AUD:	Yes.
*GOR:	And they just give me tablets.
*AUD:	Yes.
*GOR:	Now why, what made them take it to the stage
*AUD:	Well   (.) er well, first 
*GOR:	where, he wanted a heart bypass?
*AUD:	first and foremost he was in a private scheme.
*GOR:	Well,pro probably that's it then.
*AUD:	Yeah.A and probably because i because of his father and er   (.) the rela the other relative   (.) having the bypasses done.So they took it 
*GOR:	Mm.
*AUD:	a step further, but I think probably, it's because he was in er   (.) er a private scheme.
*GOR:	Very likely innit?
*AUD:	Yes.
*GOR:	So there's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablets who probably really should have a by bypass.
*AUD:	Ah well I, well, ((laugh))  (.) I wouldn't say that really Gordon.I mean I think   (.) er, when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tablets ever, so, I think it's kept it all under control and you've, you, we eat a sensible diet.The only, the only er   (.) thing I complained about with you is, is the butter.
*GOR:	Mm.I don't have that much now.
*AUD:	But I think everything in moderation, but you don't eat as much butter now as what you used to.
*GOR:	I don't eat that much bread you see.
*AUD:	No.So I, I think really, and I think   (.) what I think with him, I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family, it runs in the family.
*GOR:	Mm mm.Must be hell of a shock being told
*AUD:	Oh God!It must have been. (.) See how much it's costing?Two hundred and fifty pounds a night!
*GOR:	Yeah.
*AUD:	Phworgh!That's without the operation.
*GOR:	Yeah.Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then.
*AUD:	Oh I know.And plus he's, he, he, he, he married an heiress you know.
*GOR:	Did he?
*AUD:	Er him er,sh they live in Spain now.Oh er he, he's worth a pretty penny is Sounness.He went in Carl's shop the other, the other week.
*GOR:	Did he?
*AUD:	Yes!Mm.Must have been looking for a house.Carl said he, he looked er well er, his face did, it were very   (.) he's got a very poxy skin.
*GOR:	Has he?
*AUD:	You kno mm.Yes. (.) He was having it done this afternoon weren't he?
*GOR:	Yeah.Some time today.Aye.
*AUD:	I tell you what, that's quick int it though Gordon?With only going in last night and
*GOR:	Mm.
*AUD:	having it done today.
*GOR:	It is indeed.
*AUD:	We I wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he wouldn't have been in a private scheme.
*GOR:	He could wait six months couldn't he?
*AUD:	Well he could have been dead by then.
*GOR:	Well er, yeah,e exactly that's what they're moaning about int it?
*AUD:	Terrible!
*GOR:	Put them on a list and wait. (.) I've never heard so much talk about health   (.) as we do nowadays.
*AUD:	Oh I know.
*GOR:	When I was young I co I don't remember talking all the time about bloody   (.) health and   (.) what you should do and what you shouldn't do.
*AUD:	No I know.
*GOR:	Did you?
*AUD:	No.But we weren't educated in, in, in health though.
*GOR:	We just li we just lived and that was the end of it.
*AUD:	Yes but then you see, in the ol in the old days Gordon, I mean, you we you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day   (.) and i and whatever you got you were glad of   (.) and used to eat it all.Now   (.) we're much more affluent   (.) and people are educated we er
*GOR:	Mm.
*AUD:	as regards their health.
*GOR:	Mhm.
*AUD:	Well th having said that Gordon, your mother lived to a good old age, and my mum, and my father did.
*GOR:	Yeah.
*AUD:	And   [laughing] they ate all the wrong stuff didn't they  [] ?
*GOR:	According to wha according to what they say now they did.
*AUD:	Mm.I know. (.) Don't know who to believe really.
*GOR:	When you look at, when you look at the   (.) some, all these, a lot of these composers and artists who died long ago   (.) and you look the birth range   (.) there's a hell of a lot at seventy five, seventy six
*AUD:	Yes.
*GOR:	a oh there's a few at forty odd.
*AUD:	Mm.
*GOR:	But there's a hell of a lot   (.) well into their seventies.You know, and they were born early eighteen hundreds.
*AUD:	Yes.Yes.Yeah.I know.
*GOR:	I know we're living longer now generally but   (.) I wonder how much 
*AUD:	I don't know I 
*GOR:	I wonder 
*AUD:	you know 
*GOR:	how much, how much, I don't really know.Cos there's more people now than there was in those days.
*AUD:	Yeah, there's a lot more people. (.) It's not anyhow, I mean, it's alright living longer if you, if you, if you've got all your faculties.
*GOR:	Mm.
*AUD:	And you've got good health and everything.It's no use living like a cabbage, I don't think so anyhow.
*GOR:	No, that's
*AUD:	And when I see these people in nursing homes all sat round a wall in chairs   (.) oh God!I'd hate to end up like that.
*GOR:	Somebody's  (        ) .
*AUD:	Pardon?
*GOR:	Left the gate open.
*AUD:	Did you? (.) I wonder who's that?
*GOR:	I'll check.Has a leaflet come through.
*AUD:	Yes.I bet there has.Tell you what, the Conservative candidate's not been round has he?
*GOR:	No he daren't.
*AUD:	 ((laugh))
