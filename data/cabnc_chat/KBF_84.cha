*BRE:	Yeah a lot of people just didn't go probably on Friday. •114315_114540•
        And the fact, I don't think there'll be that big  on Sundays. •114981_115217•
        I mean being Christmas, yes. •115217_115287•
        But I don't think •115307_115436•
*DAV:	They're all frightened that one of them's gonna  sell a tin of baked beans more than the other one on a Sunday. •115436_116431•
