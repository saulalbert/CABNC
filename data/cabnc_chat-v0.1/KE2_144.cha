*TER:	Right, now what's the next one? •121202_121340•
        Two fourteen to ten twenty, er this again is easier because what would be two fourteen to ten fourteen? •121467_122219•
*LUC:	Erm  eight •122792_122937•
*TER:	Eight hours, so fourteen to twenty would be how many? •122971_123287•
*LUC:	Sixteen •123305_123326•
*TER:	Right, so it's eight hours six minutes  now the next one •123330_124065•
*LUC:	Erm •124319_124326•
*TER:	two fifty to ten twenty nine, well, come back to the same sort of time, the hour just before that, say two fifty to nine fifty, what would two fifty to nine fifty be? •124326_125914•
*LUC:	Erm seven hours •125914_126405•
*TER:	Right, now you've got to go from  fifty to twenty nine •126507_127159•
*LUC:	Erm •127353_127359•
*TER:	so fifty to an hour would be •127359_127512•
*LUC:	Thirty nine •127519_127547•
*TER:	Right thirty nine minutes, so it's •127574_127723•
*LUC:	Seven, eight hours •127944_128047•
*TER:	No seven hours isn't it? •128086_128188•
*LUC:	Seven hours  •128188_128219•
*TER:	Two to nine, seven hours and thirty nine minutes isn't it? •128219_128647•
*LUC:	Got thirty nine •128647_128769•
*TER:	Right, now this next one  ten A M to two thirty seven P M, well what's ten o'clock? •128769_129986•

*TER:	Four hours and? •130053_130111•
*LUC:	Fifty seven •130111_130189•
*TER:	Right and I think the next one you got right, because you worked it out alright, cos it's seven days, which is how many hours? •130189_131146•
*LUC:	Five, three, erm  seven times twenty four •131199_131748•
*TER:	That's right, which is? •131850_131954•
*LUC:	Erm a hundred times twenty four •131954_132368•
*TER:	Well it's a hundred and sixty eight, seven times twenty four, but then you've got five hours to add onto it which makes it a hundred and seventy three, right, so now work out your average speeds. •132435_133360•
*LUC:	Okay  but I got some right, I got the actual question wrong on that one, just I, shall I do that one? •133382_134297•
*TER:	Have you got the second one, didn't you get the second one, oh you got that one wrong? •134682_134939•
*LUC:	Yes •134959_134973•
*TER:	Right, so yes, do that one  this is what this is Dublin to Cork? •134988_135636•

*TER:	Dublin to Cork, it's two hundred and sixty six •137319_137742•
*LUC:	Oh I've done the wrong one  a hundred and six, I've got that and you've marked it wrong  •137749_140428•
*TER:	What did you divide by? •140428_140528•
*LUC:	That •140911_140921•
*TER:	What? •141167_141196•
*LUC:	Two point five, eight •141254_141365•

*TER:	Right, what's half an hour? •145388_145671•
*LUC:	Thirty nine •145789_145811•
*TER:	Right, so two point five is two hours, thirty minutes, but it's not two hours, thirty minutes, it's two hours •145860_146638•
*LUC:	Fifty minutes •146663_146699•
*TER:	Right, so what have you got to do? •146699_146839•
        You've got to change the minutes to a decimal •146991_147344•
*LUC:	Oh •147344_147367•
*TER:	haven't you? •147465_147562•

*TER:	Right •157660_157697•
*LUC:	Nought, point, one, three •157780_157880•
*TER:	but you're not gonna divide by nought, point, one, three are you? •158095_158340•
*LUC:	No  ninety one •158586_158817•
*TER:	Right  now what I shall do before you go any further is divide that at the side here, what those and minutes are as decimals of an hour  •158848_160003•
*LUC:	Nought point four, seven, nought point four, seven •160607_161235•
*TER:	What was it erm six hours twenty eight minutes was it? •161235_161461•

*TER:	Right, no it's not, look, it's ten o'clock to two thirty seven, what's that? •167170_167712•
        How many minutes? •167880_167935•
*LUC:	Thirty seven •167935_168043•
*TER:	Right, so it's four hours, thirty seven minutes isn't it? •168084_168474•
        We want thirty seven  •168546_168632•
*LUC:	Nought point six, two •169283_169459•
*TER:	Right  •169733_169763•
*LUC:	ninety eight •171507_171570•
*TER:	Right  •171622_171664•
*LUC:	eighty six •173471_173572•
*TER:	Eighty, you're not far out, but it's just erm •173808_174391•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	Madrid to Barcelona  •174758_174932•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	six, eight, seven  •175140_175227•
*LUC:	Erm, eight six •176246_176404•
*TER:	Right  just don't do it again •176508_177180•
*LUC:	Six •177501_177520•
*TER:	Is this the seven hours, thirty nine minutes? •177616_177781•
*LUC:	Yeah, six, eight, seven •177802_178782•
*TER:	Seven hours •178782_178843•

*TER:	Right  •186158_186194•
*LUC:	One, three, seven •186391_186600•
*TER:	Right  right, what you didn't do almost all the time was to change those minutes to decimals of an hour wasn't it? •186633_187790•
        So you must remember that whenever you're dealing with speed or anything to do with hours and minutes you've got to change your minutes to the decimals of an hour before you can use your calculator. •187831_188935•
*LUC:	Okay. •188989_188998•
*TER:	Now, just let's have a little help here, because you won't have this graph with you all the time  will you? •189065_189953•
*LUC:	No •189953_189961•
*TER:	Right, so, how can you find out what forty minutes is? •189961_190734•
*LUC:	Divide it by ten  •190734_190843•
*TER:	No, what decimal fraction of an hour is forty minutes? •190843_191871•
        How can you find out, you can use your calculator •191871_192411•
*LUC:	Quarter, three quarters •192411_192596•
*TER:	No, what's, what's a quarter of an hour? •192608_192875•
*LUC:	Quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, fours into sixty, fifteen •192875_193602•
*TER:	Right, so three quarters of an hour is? •193713_194075•
*LUC:	Forty five •194075_194250•
*TER:	Forty five minutes  if you've got forty five minutes, what's, what's the fraction of an hour? •194280_195539•
*LUC:	Over sixty •195539_195774•
*TER:	Right, it's forty five over sixty, you want to change that into a decimal, what do you do? •195774_196329•
*LUC:	Erm  divide into •196329_196877•
*TER:	No, how do you change any fraction into a decimal, now this is something you must  •196895_197427•
*LUC:	Divide it by ten •197427_197538•
*TER:	No, no, no, no  you've got fractions here look, erm  now how do you change all those fractions into decimal fractions, what do you do? •197595_199681•
*LUC:	Nought point five •199681_199804•
*TER:	But how did you do it? •199822_199985•
        You knew that, but how do you do it? •199985_200297•
*LUC:	Erm •200297_200304•
*TER:	How do you do it on a calculator? •200389_200545•
        What does that really mean one over two, how else could you write one over two? •200545_201155•
        How else could you write it? •201155_201467•
*LUC:	Two over four •201467_201783•
*TER:	Yes, but I don't mean that, erm, could you, would you write it as one plus two or one minus two or one multiplied by two or one divided by two •201930_203194•
*LUC:	One multiplied •203194_203309•
*TER:	One multiplied by two? •203317_203726•
        Two ones are two? •203726_203905•
        Does a half equal two? •203905_204064•
        So what does that, you know this, which of those four rules do you do for that? •204064_204724•
*LUC:	One  •204724_204753•
*TER:	What's one plus two? •205689_205775•
*LUC:	Three •205781_205807•
*TER:	What's one minus two? •205848_206055•
*LUC:	Nothing, minus •206055_206220•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	one, minus two? •206378_206737•
*LUC:	One, no, nothing  •206737_207184•
*TER:	One, minus two •207291_208116•
*LUC:	Minus two •208122_208402•
*TER:	Minus, one, come down two, come down one you get to nought, come down another one  •208429_209254•
*LUC:	Minus two  •209254_209284•
*TER:	so one minus one, one minus two is? •209284_209528•
*LUC:	Minus one •209528_209605•
*TER:	Is minus one, what's one times two? •209609_210019•
*LUC:	Er two •210019_210420•
*TER:	What's one divided by two? •210420_210827•
*LUC:	One •210827_210853•
*TER:	If you've got one apple and you divide it •210885_211546•
*LUC:	Half •211546_211556•
*TER:	Right, one divided by two is a half, so which of those answers is that one? •211592_212429•
        Right, so what does one, how else can you write one over two? •212429_212941•
*LUC:	Erm one divide •212941_213318•
*TER:	One divided by two, right, remember that, so how can I write that? •213318_214063•
*LUC:	Forty five divided by six •214063_214328•
*TER:	By? •214352_214368•
*LUC:	Sixty •214427_214463•
*TER:	Right, do that on your calculator  •214516_214846•
*LUC:	Nought point seven five •214846_215621•
*TER:	Right, so that equals nought point seven five, what's a half? •215621_216212•
        Do it on the calculator •216212_216328•
*LUC:	Nought point five •216328_216501•
*TER:	Right  what's three quarters divided er as a decimal? •216792_217566•
*LUC:	Nought point five  nought point eight, seven, five •217566_219167•
*TER:	Right, so how do you change a fraction into a decimal? •219178_219653•
*LUC:	You divide it by the bottom •219653_219806•
*TER:	You divide the top number by the bottom number, so, supposing you've got fifty seven minutes and you want to change that into a decimal of an hour, what fraction of an hour is it? •219806_221158•
        What's fifty seven minutes as a as a fraction of an hour? •221162_221733•
        That's forty five minutes •221987_222115•
*LUC:	Fifty seven over sixty •222135_222237•
*TER:	Right, so how do you change that into a decimal? •222288_222714•
*LUC:	Nought, point, nine, five •223223_223344•
*TER:	Right, nought, point, nine, five, so now you can see how easily you can change your minutes into a decimal at any time, right, now, let's look at some of these, this is four hours and thirty  •223344_225510•
*LUC:	Thirty  •225574_225586•
*TER:	seven minutes, so it's four hours, four hours and thirty seven minutes, so what fraction is that of an hour? •225586_226608•
*LUC:	Erm  •226608_226648•
*TER:	Thirty seven minutes? •226738_227474•
*LUC:	Forty •227474_227509•
*TER:	Thirty seven minutes? •227570_227715•
*LUC:	over sixty •227715_227814•
*TER:	Right thirty seven over sixty, what's thirty seven over sixty? •227814_228177•
        Cos the that is four and thirty seven sixtieths •228177_228506•
*LUC:	Mm •228539_228589•
*TER:	so what's thirty seven sixtieths as a decimal? •228716_228877•
*LUC:	Nought point six •228877_229852•
*TER:	Right, so what's four hours, thirty seven minutes? •229865_230471•
*LUC:	Four point six  •230471_230557•
*TER:	Point six  •230569_230610•
*LUC:	O •230614_230650•
*TER:	Well six •230707_230782•
*LUC:	One •230782_230827•
*TER:	to the nearest two decimal places what's that gonna be? •230940_231365•
        Nought, point, six  •231365_231767•
*LUC:	Nought, point, six one •231774_231883•
*TER:	to do decimal places? •231981_232124•
*LUC:	Oh, two •232124_232287•
*TER:	Right, because that's bigger than five isn't it? •232313_232568•
*LUC:	Yes •232568_232581•
*TER:	So it's nought, point, six, two, so for our thirty seven minutes it's, four point six, two, there we are look, but the thing is you can now do it without having to look at a scale •232581_233772•
*LUC:	Mm •233772_233814•
*TER:	Right? •233814_233822•
