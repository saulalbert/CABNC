                           been in er, I mean she must of seen him when, when
                           he's approached her to buy the house
Ada (PS01C)                [354] Yeah that's what I
Albert (PS01A)             [355] so surely she must be able to give him
Ada (PS01C)                [356] D'ya, d'ya know what I think Al, I think he's
                           from Barnsley cos that Bob lots of money he's had
                           dropped there at Barnsley

                           from Barnsley ... so I think he belongs Barnsley
                           [...] out the bloody area.
Albert (PS01A)             [361] Well he's not, he's not forced to do, he just
                           might know the area, I mean, all he's doing is
                           sticking to er places just off the motorways int he?
Ada (PS01C)                [362] Yes.
Albert (PS01A)             [363] But er ... I mean he's come from Birmingham up
                           to Barnsley it's only what a hundred mi well is it
                           hundred about ninety odd mile?
Ada (PS01C)                [364] Yeah, he's [...] there from Barnsley up
                           Birmingham it says that were a hundred miles away
                           where we got 'em to drop the money off [cough]
Albert (PS01A)             [365] But the thing is she must've seen him.
Ada (PS01C)                [366] Of course she has but day time, now they're
                           getting two, if there's two women, they're getting
                           two women out of show, did you see it on telly?
Albert (PS01A)             [367] Yeah, but I mean even, even so, she, she has
                           met him once before and she must of seen him when
                           she's gone to the house for him to kidnap her.
Ada (PS01C)                [368] Yeah he must've been following her about.
Albert (PS01A)             [369] Alright he's probably blindfolded her after
                           that, but at least she should have some kind of er
Ada (PS01C)                [370] Yeah whether he were dark hair or light hair
                           or tall or short.

                           surely she could give the police some indication of

Karen (PS01F)              [462] Yeah.

                           right dusty.
Karen (PS01F)              [464] Right er, maybe that's what it is then.
                           [465] [...] seems funny though, it's only started.
June (PS01B)               [466] Albert says I've got to sell 'im.

June (PS01B)               [473] I ended up paying for him.
                           [474] She's not bothered, she never goes near him.
Albert (PS01A)             [475] Never goes near him.
June (PS01B)               [476] She never goes near him.
                           [477] She's frightened to death of 'im
Karen (PS01F)              [478] [...] isn't it.
June (PS01B)               [479] I know.
                           [480] But I don't think Geoff would be very pleased.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [481] Well, if you say to him, that just say that
                           [...] and that, that's you know, oh, just say

                           can't keep up with him Dennis, he's throwing loads
                           of dust about, just say to him, [...] think about
                           selling, to you want to buy him back or, you know.
June (PS01B)               [482] Well, they won't, I don't think they'd have
                           him back.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [483] No and that's [...] a
Albert (PS01A)             [484] I don't think, I don't think sell him.
Sasha (PS01G)              [485] Has he got to wait.
June (PS01B)               [486] A.
Albert (PS01A)             [487] I don't think you'd get what you paid for him.
June (PS01B)               [488] Probably not, but I mean, cage is worth a
                           hundred and fifty quid.
                           [489] That's what Russell paid for the cage.
Sasha (PS01G)              [490] Oh, look.
Karen (PS01F)              [491] Mm
Sasha (PS01G)              [492] Oh, look.
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Sasha (PS01G)              [493] What.
                           [494] Look, [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [495] [...] that he's into, [...]
June (PS01B)               [496] Well, I mean, he's no problem to me.
                           [497] I'm not bothered about him.
                           [498] You know, I'd rather keep him than sell him,
                           but
Albert (PS01A)             [499] [cough] It's like everything else, you've
                           always summat else to bloody feed.
June (PS01B)               [500] Mm.
Karen (PS01F)              [501] By the way, when we had that pair, that were
                           driving me mad, and then that one died, when we were
                           in bungalow.
                           [502] Other one would learnt how to open a crack,
                           and it were in that cage, and it could hear birds
                           outside.
                           [503] Anyway in the end we let er Kenny's grandad
                           have 'im, I mean, 'cos they got me mum's bird.
                           [504] They've got two of his own, he ended up with
                           four birds.
June (PS01B)               [505] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [506] But at least they were happy, you know what I
                           mean.
                           [507] 'Cos they were with other birds.
                           [508] But I never missed, I never missed him. [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [cough]
June (PS01B)               [509] I don't think you get attached to birds like
                           you do animals.
Albert (PS01A)             [510] I don't think you get attached to birds like
                           dogs.
June (PS01B)               [511] Not like dogs and cats.
Karen (PS01F)              [512] No.
June (PS01B)               [513] I mean Albert said, [...] if we do get that
                           bungalow, we are [...] 'cos the owner, he said
                           she'll disappear.
Albert (PS01A)             [514] She'll disappear.
June (PS01B)               [515] I mean I'll be upset about our Whisky, 'cos
                           we're, I mean, we've had a long time, although she's
                           not a pet ... pet, you know what I mean.
Karen (PS01F)              [516] What [...] feel like.
June (PS01B)               [517] Well, they they just, they go away when you
                           take them somewhere fresh.
                           [518] [cough] and they don't know where they are.
Sasha (PS01G)              [519] That one.
Albert (PS01A)             [520] They're very very ...
June (PS01B)               [521] Sometimes, you're lucky, and you know, if if
                           you keep them in long enough
Albert (PS01A)             [522] We've always had cats, always had cats, when
                           we lived at and we moved into and we'd had this one
                           cat years, it were old cat.
                           [523] I wouldn't say it was ready for popping off,
                           you know what I mean.
Karen (PS01F)              [524] Yeah
Albert (PS01A)             [525] It were always fit and we were only there a
                           fortnight, three weeks disappeared.
June (PS01B)               [526] I mean, if our Whisky died, I wouldn't be as
                           upset about it, as I would about these.
                           [527] But if she disappeared I'd be worried all
                           time.
Albert (PS01A)             [528] And yet ...
Karen (PS01F)              [529] Aye.
June (PS01B)               [530] You know, like when our Dawn's kittens
                           disappeared.
                           [531] It, they weren't bothered, I think Mick took
                           them away meself.
Karen (PS01F)              [532] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [533] I'm convinced he did.
Albert (PS01A)             [534] I think he did.
June (PS01B)               [535] But I were I were upset about that, you know.
Karen (PS01F)              [536] [...] without a break.
June (PS01B)               [...] [...]
June (PS01B)               [537] No, it's a can't be in the garden, can he.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [538] Yeah.
                           [539] Same as with these next door.
                           [540] I get right upset about Paddy.
                           [541] I mean she's give his kennel away now, and
                           he's got no kennel again.
Karen (PS01F)              [542] Ar.
June (PS01B)               [543] And he's running streets, and you know how
                           cold it was last week, and he's running streets.
Karen (PS01F)              [544] What she give kennel away for, then.
June (PS01B)               [545] I don't bloody know.
Albert (PS01A)             [546] I think she'd give the dog away as well.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [547] Saw him coming.
June (PS01B)               [548] Don't lick, don't let him lick her, Karen.
                           [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [549] Don't lick.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]

Sasha (PS01G)              [551] [...] all right.
Albert (PS01A)             [...]

Karen (PS01F)              [555] [...] any better or.
June (PS01B)               [556] She said, when I went round she was sat doing
                           crossword on bed.
                           [557] And then, er, I said I've just come to see if
                           you want any cigs.
                           [558] She said, well our John's coming down tonight,
                           she said, just get me twenty.
                           [559] I said, you might as well get forty, I said,
                           because if he's late coming down
Karen (PS01F)              [560] Yeah, right.
June (PS01B)               [561] And he can't round shop after, you'd be stuck,
                           and I mean, he.
                           [562] I don't ... Albert don't mind going for her
                           cigs, but it's just that we don't get up early in
                           the morning, you know, and if me mum's ringing at
                           eight o'clock in the morning, 'cos she got no cigs.
                           [563] It's a bit unfair like, when when she could at
                           [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [564] [...] I said [...] she said after my job at

June (PS01B)               [565] Margaret's not very well.
Karen (PS01F)              [566] [...] she hadn't seen Margaret since Christmas
                           Eve.
                           [567] Yeah, but she ain't been bad since Christmas
                           Eve.
June (PS01B)               [568] Oh, no.
                           [569] no.

                           anniversary, she'd got diarrhoea and sickness,
                           Margaret.
                           [573] I think she were off work last week.
Karen (PS01F)              [574] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Karen (PS01F)              [575] I I mean, you're anything like that, but not
                           not for a month, I mean.

                           months.
                           [582] Because I can't remembering him going.
                           [583] He never goes without Margaret.
                           [584] She always goes herself, she were down there
                           last night, by herself.
                           [585] He were at pub.
Karen (PS01F)              [586] Mm.
                           [587] Well, I said to her, told her about not having
                           nowt to eat from that Wednesday morning, er
                           Wednesday dinner time, till Thursday when they went
June (PS01B)               [588] Well she took away fish last night for her
                           supper.
Karen (PS01F)              [589] Oh.
                           [590] And that she she looked shocked, you know, she
                           didn't didn't know me like, and er, well she was
                           shocked, and then I said I said, right [...] well

                           about stopping with her, and Pete said straight
                           away.
                           [591] Margaret's there every day, she goes out every
                           morning.
                           [592] Right.
                           [593] Not that he actually asked her.
Albert (PS01A)             [594] [...] years ago about Beryl.
June (PS01B)               [595] I told you that's what he said.
Karen (PS01F)              [596] And I said, aye up, I don't mean in day-time.
                           [597] I says on a night-time, I said, you know, she
                           can't leave her home now, I said, she can't manage
                           to put coal on fire, and she can't manage to get up
                           up to eat and drink and that, I said, I don't mind
                           dropping off and taking me turn on the night-time
                           but I mean, but it's hard, it's hard with me with
                           kids every night.
June (PS01B)               [598] It's [...] for you with kids.
Karen (PS01F)              [599] But I don't, certainly don't mind taking her
                           down once a week or twice a week and taking me turn.
Albert (PS01A)             [600] Karen there's no need, no need, you're needed
                           at bloody home.
June (PS01B)               [601] I mean, there's only you got kids.
Karen (PS01F)              [602] There's no reason your Margaret can't stop
                           when he's on nights.
                           [603] Or [...] afters.
June (PS01B)               [604] No.
Karen (PS01F)              [605] I mean, 'cos we can all [...] down.
                           [606] Only days really what's difficult for him.
June (PS01B)               [607] Yeah.
                           [608] I don't think Pete'd stop.
Karen (PS01F)              [609] [...] really.
                           [610] I mean, he only got to get his clothes on and
                           go to work, the same.
June (PS01B)               [611] I don't think he'd go stop.
                           [612] Our Margaret might go stop herself, but I
                           don't think he'll go.
Albert (PS01A)             [...]
Sasha (PS01G)              [613] Ah.
                           [614] You're bending

Sasha (PS01G)              [617] No.
June (PS01B)               [618] I don't think [...] Margaret would want to
                           stop, actually.
June (PS01B)               [619] No, I don't think they would.
Albert (PS01A)             [620] None of em will
Karen (PS01F)              [621] But er, I don't think [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [622] If no one will go down there at all and and
                           sit with their mother for a for a couple of hours.
Karen (PS01F)              [623] No.
June (PS01B)               [624] I mean, I can't talk, because I never go.
                           [625] Er, to say 'cos I mean, I closest, and I don't
                           go.

                           Margaret and me mum have.
Karen (PS01F)              [628] No.
Sasha (PS01G)              [giggle]
Karen (PS01F)              [629] It's same as, what [...] ow she's gone into
                           hospital with her, you know, and I'd actually been
                           that day, you know what I mean, I don't mind, don't
                           get me wrong, I'm not cross, 'cos I don't mind.
                           [630] But it annoys you [...] they they they think
                           they're doing a lot for her 'cos they go in ev every
                           morning.
June (PS01B)               [631] Yeah, they're more thought of.
Karen (PS01F)              [632] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [633] More thought of.
June (PS01B)               [634] Has he.
Karen (PS01F)              [635] Yeah.
                           [636] I mean, I know, but Colin ain't been down much
                           this week, because Colin's been working, he's been
                           working every day [...] and that, you know what I
                           mean, it's been a bit hard for us to get down but we
                           tried.
June (PS01B)               [637] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [638] [...] who should try and pick kids up and then
                           have an hour down there.
June (PS01B)               [639] Well, he spends more time there than me.
                           [640] 'Cos I've been this morning and I've cleared
                           fireplace out, washed [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [641] No, you're not wearing your shoes in here.
June (PS01B)               [642] and I've 'oovered up,
Karen (PS01F)              [...] [...]
June (PS01B)               [643] and dusted and polished.
                           [644] That kitchen floor could do with washing, I
                           saw a mop, but didn't see no bucket.
                           [645] I don't whether she's got one, but I thought,
                           I didn't have time to do it this morning.
Karen (PS01F)              [646] Mm.
June (PS01B)               [647] So I just run round with 'oover and dusted and
                           polished, then I made a cup of tea.
Karen (PS01F)              [648] Who's doing the washing?
June (PS01B)               [649] Our Margaret.
Karen (PS01F)              [650] Ah.
June (PS01B)               [651] I can't, our Margaret's drying it on
                           radiators, and I says to Albert, what me mum doing
                           with the dryer.
                           [652] He says, I don't know.
Albert (PS01A)             [653] It's still there.
June (PS01B)               [654] So I'm gonna ask her if I can borrow it
Albert (PS01A)             [655] It's [...]
June (PS01B)               [656] and then now I'll do her dryer washing for
                           her.
Karen (PS01F)              [657] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [658] I mean, I only really wanted to dry me towels,
                           because I hate having to run out laun launderette
                           while I'm drying all me other clothes on radiators.
Albert (PS01A)             [659] It's more expensive to use.
June (PS01B)               [660] Yes.
                           [661] I know it's more expensive.
Karen (PS01F)              [662] Sasha.
June (PS01B)               [663] but it's really only for towels.
Albert (PS01A)             [664] Come in, and shut that door.
Karen (PS01F)              [665] What you got.
June (PS01B)               [666] Get, shout Barney in.
                           [667] Shout Barney.

                           [674] She dropped her washing off.
                           [675] I thought she'd dried it, and she said, oh,
                           I'm just gonna put this washing on radiators, and
                           then it, it were then that er it made me think,
                           well, what [...] done with her dryer.

Sasha (PS01G)              [676] Yeah, I know.
June (PS01B)               [677] Well, 'cos I mean, she can't be paying much
                           electric.
Karen (PS01F)              [678] It's not that [...] that your Margaret ain't
                           got time to stop there and dry it for her, you know
                           what I mean.
June (PS01B)               [679] Oh, all you got to do is put it in,
                           somebody'll take it out.
Karen (PS01F)              [680] Yeah.

                           night

                           tried in ways like that.
June (PS01B)               [688] Yeah.
                           [689] I mean I can't afford to take care [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [690] We tried to [...]
June (PS01B)               [691] We can afford to keep afford to [...] dog.
Albert (PS01A)             [692] And Margaret's dad, when they, when my kids
                           were little would never take our kids anywhere but
                           they [...]
June (PS01B)               [693] It were me dad, it were me dad that didn't
                           take up [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [694] And always relied on one or the other, I don't
                           [...]
June (PS01B)               [695] Me dad wouldn't me dad didn't mind taking
                           [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [696] I don't care which one.
                           [697] But they would never take 'em out for day
Karen (PS01F)              [698] No, I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [699] But they would fetch 'em and pay for them, and
                           I even today, you cannot buy love.
Karen (PS01F)              [700] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [701] And it's proven my point, our Dawn wouldn't
                           even think about [...] there.
                           [702] Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
Unknown speaker (KB1PSUNK) [703] Don't think about what. [...]
June (PS01B)               [704] Our Corinne don't only go round when she got
                           to.
                           [705] She goes round [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [706] Goes round [...] weeks ago.
June (PS01B)               [707] Well, she won't go and stop.
                           [708] Said she won't go and stop again.
Albert (PS01A)             [709] Who's gonna stop then.
June (PS01B)               [710] When we were all on about stopping [...]
Sasha (PS01G)              [singing]
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [711] I don't mind going and doing her shopping and
                           bits, she says, I'm not stopping.
Karen (PS01F)              [712] Yeah.
                           [713] When you were on about that love, what pa was
                           saying about, you know, like every night, that our
                           kids, when, they had their pyjamas on, and they're
                           like, to get hold, [...] I'm lying watching
                           television, I'm usually falling asleep, but I put
                           the kids, [...] you know.
                           [714] And er, last time I I get in touch, me mum
                           told me, [...] turned round and says to me, I don't
                           want [...] any more mum, I says why, he says, oh she
                           won't let me have pillow [...] and then I then I
                           think if summat else [...] brought to light, I [...]
                           kill her
June (PS01B)               [715] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [716] if she had come in
Albert (PS01A)             [717] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [718] [...] and that, I know it's a filthy old
                           thing, but it it's comfort ain't it.
June (PS01B)               [719] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [720] And when they start [...] let them have the
                           pillow down, they don't feel, they can't get
                           comfortable.
                           [721] I know it's a little bit trivial like, but
                           it's just, it's still [...]
June (PS01B)               [722] She has queer ways me mother.
                           [723] Karen I I'm forty-seven and I can't work me
                           mother out, so, no chance for you working her out,
                           few years you've known her.
Karen (PS01F)              [724] [laugh] No no, I I, I mean, she's always been
                           alright with me really, I mean,y you know, she's not
                           [...] not at all mother-in-law, she's not [...]
June (PS01B)               [725] Well, me and me mum's, me and me me mum's
                           never been close.
                           [726] It were always like, me and our Colin were
                           more or less with me dad, and our Margaret and John
                           were more or less for me mum.
                           [727] Then when they got older, me dad sort of took
                           our John on, because our John were mechanical
                           minded, and our Colin got pushed out a bit, 'cos our
                           Colin weren't interested in cars.
Sasha (PS01G)              [728] [...] I found this.
June (PS01B)               [729] Oh yeah, oh that's what that bird.
                           [730] Yuk.
                           [731] And our Colin was to be off t' fair, and that,
                           so, me dad sort of went on to our John and pushed
                           our Colin out a little bit.
Karen (PS01F)              [732] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [733] But er, me and our Colin's never been me mum's
                           favourite.
                           [734] It's always been our Margaret.
Karen (PS01F)              [735] Mind you, did you see that photo that [...]
June (PS01B)               [736] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [737] You are, I mean, I could just work out, [...]
                           I said, your Margaret and John are a lot like you.
                           [738] She is [...] 'cos she's got Margaret's lips
                           and your nose, but out of all of you, I think your
                           your Jo you can see your John in it, can't you, more
                           than anybody.
Unknown speaker (KB1PSUNK) [739] I always think our John looks more like a
                           Prescott, 'cos he al every time I see him, I see me
                           Uncle Bill more and more.
Karen (PS01F)              [740] Yeah, John [...] used to say, years ago about
                           how much that you're, John looks like your Brian,
                           and I don't think he looks anything like it.
June (PS01B)               [741] No, I don't.
Karen (PS01F)              [742] And she [...] again now, she says like
                           somebody [...] your John look like that bloke next
                           door.
                           [743] What a load of rubbish, I thought well.
June (PS01B)               [744] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [...]
June (PS01B)               [745] He looks more and more
Karen (PS01F)              [746] Aye.
June (PS01B)               [747] our Colin's getting more and more like me dad.
Albert (PS01A)             [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [748] Well, Brian [...] ain't it.
                           [749] Brian , Brian I think don't like, er,
Albert (PS01A)             [750] [...] they are, they're all like that.
                           [751] All of them. [...]
June (PS01B)               [752] And I think our John looks like me Uncle Bill.
Karen (PS01F)              [753] Yeah, I think he does.
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Karen (PS01F)              [754] But then again, he did look like that photo, I
                           think he does look like that photo, but you were
                           younger then,
June (PS01B)               [755] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [756] but he does look like Uncle Bill.
                           [757] Mind you [...] Colin's getting more like your
                           dad every day.
June (PS01B)               [758] I know he is.
Karen (PS01F)              [759] black welding glasses on, and he turned round
                           and he made me jump.
                           [760] Like oh, Colin, and then he go like this, you
                           know, [...] isn't it.
                           [761] You know, he'll come running [...] glasses.
Albert (PS01A)             [762] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [763] I can't do it.
                           [764] And right, he made me heart jump, 'cos he
                           looked just like your dad, and then a few days
                           later, he's in garage again, and Johnny come in and
                           he said, God he said, he gave me a flaming heart
                           attack out there.
                           [765] I said, why, and he said, he turned round with
                           these glasses on, then he said it was just like
                           John's stood there.
                           [766] I says, don't tell me, I said, he did the same
                           thing to me the other day, and it were only within a
                           couple of days of each other.
                           [767] When he puts those glasses on, honestly he's
                           his double.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [768] I think it's the way he looks, like, if you
                           know what I mean, you know like [...] pull his face
                           and like, look over glasses, I mean, [laugh] he did
                           it to me when [...] did it to Johnny.
                           [769] He probably thought [...] like.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [770] He's like me dad, er me dad, he never had no
                           patience, and our Colin's just like him.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [771] Mind you, I'm like our Colin as well in a lot
                           of ways.
                           [772] I haven't got a lot of patience.
                           [773] But where ... where we're better off 'cos
                           Albert, he's calm, where you and our Colin are both
                           fiery tempered
Karen (PS01F)              [774] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [775] Where, when I start, Albert's
Karen (PS01F)              [776] He, I tell you want he doesn't do, I shouldn't
                           let you hear, but, when he, when him and me are
                           arguing when we were younger, and me dad used to
                           wind Colin up, and wind me up, and I'd get madder
                           and madder, and me dad used to love it.
                           [777] But looking back, you know, and now, that's
                           what Colin does to me, he winds me bloody up, [...]
                           but I can't help it, because he gets me that wild, I
                           should just, I should, I mean, how can you change
                           his temperament.
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Karen (PS01F)              [778] I mean, I should just turn round and tell him
                           where to go, but.
Albert (PS01A)             [779] I think Colin winds you up summat chronic
Karen (PS01F)              [780] I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [781] And instead of just
Karen (PS01F)              [782] Ignoring him.
Albert (PS01A)             [783] Ignoring him.
                           [784] You don't, he [...] and he [...] going through
                           bloody [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [785] Yeah, I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [cough]
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [786] What
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [787] A [...] where
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [788] No.
                           [789] Bird pooh on window.
Albert (PS01A)             [790] [cough] But, [...] I mean, er,
June (PS01B)               [791] Where the birds have poohed on me window
                           flying past.
Sasha (PS01G)              [792] Oh God.
June (PS01B)               [793] I know aren't they dirty.
Albert (PS01A)             [794] He thinks a lot about ya [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [795] Yeah.
                           [796] Right duck.
                           [797] You know, I [...] he mustn't pushed me, that
                           man, who that keeps asking me out.
                           [798] I mean, I sometimes, I mean, I admit I'm not
                           most passionate person in the world but I then again
                           I'm not
June (PS01B)               [799] You're not by your bloody self.
Karen (PS01F)              [800] I'm not frigid or owt
June (PS01B)               [801] I can't see, [...] are neither of you
                           passionate?
Karen (PS01F)              [802] No.
                           [803] I keep saying to him, look Colin, I said, I
                           know a couple of times a week's enough for me, but
                           that's worth waiting for, but when you're doing it
                           three times and then get sick of it.
                           [804] [laugh] and he can't understand that.

Sasha (PS01G)              [814] I tried to get one.

Sasha (PS01G)              [820] [...] It scared me.
Albert (PS01A)             [821] Go and tell Auntie June to shut the back door.
                           [822] Else she'll be missing a bird.
Albert (PS01A)             [823] June.
                           [824] June.
Sasha (PS01G)              [825] [...] That was close, wasn't it?

Albert (PS01A)             [848] Yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [849] Wait a minute, Albert.
Albert (PS01A)             [850] Behave, bloody scratching.
                           [851] Bloody big, stupid sod.
Sasha (PS01G)              [852] I'm making a bed for for Barney.
Albert (PS01A)             [853] And Barney's in bed.

Albert (PS01A)             [861] Come on, come on, throw them over there.
Karen (PS01F)              [862] I wonder if there's any way you can actually
                           check, you know, where he is, is there any way that
                           [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [863] Watch me tea, now.

June (PS01B)               [865] Well, what what do you think erm,
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [866] Are you worried about how much money it's
                           gonna cost ya.
Karen (PS01F)              [867] No, because money's cost us less.
                           [868] Er, you know when they said we had to pay two
                           hundred and fifty one for er, administration and
                           search and survey.
                           [869] It's come back, and it's under two hundred.
Sasha (PS01G)              [870] Can I have a cup of tea, please.
Karen (PS01F)              [871] Then they said I've got to pay five hundred
                           pounds for
Albert (PS01A)             [872] Do what, love.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [873] I don't think Allied Dunbar will deal with
                           anybody that's dodgy.
Albert (PS01A)             [874] No.
June (PS01B)               [875] Er,
Albert (PS01A)             [876] Now, watch that tea.
Sasha (PS01G)              [877] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [878] That's what he said.
Albert (PS01A)             [879] Are you ready.
June (PS01B)               [880] I don't think they'd deal with anybody that
                           dodgy.
                           [881] Er.
Sasha (PS01G)              [882] [...] Bert.
Albert (PS01A)             [883] Are you doing alright, are ya.
June (PS01B)               [884] What they do, they look they look around and
                           they weigh up up pros and cons up, and it it's like
                           these insurance brokers, they ring all over to buy
                           cheapest insurance for you, well, that's what Allied
                           Dunbar are doing.
Karen (PS01F)              [885] Well, well, this is a broker, but it's a [...]
                           broker, so that's [...]
June (PS01B)               [886] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [887] You see, what it is, it's where they've been
                           behind with their mortgage, we will pay a slightly
                           higher rate, but it's only
Albert (PS01A)             [888] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [889] a matter of about, er, I think I think the
                           mortgage now is ten point nine, and we'll be paying
                           eleven point something,
June (PS01B)               [890] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [891] So it's only a matter of a
Albert (PS01A)             [892] Yeah, but one per cent 's a hell of a lot you
                           know.
                           [893] It's a penny in the pound.
Karen (PS01F)              [894] Yeah, but I mean it, it will drop, it will
                           drop again.
                           [895] But the thing is, also what I thought of once
                           we gotta us a mortgage and got established, you
                           could always remortgage and go into er like Bradford
                           and Bingley, and come out like that [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [896] Yeah, once you get it back up to
Karen (PS01F)              [897] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [898] Yeah, well that's
Karen (PS01F)              [899] Well, I thought once we get
*** 6 (Tape 059903) ***
Unknown speaker (KB1PSUNK) [900] It'll not be a dodgy one.
                           [901] Put it in there, then.
Albert (PS01A)             [902] It won't be, it's not forced to be a building
                           society.
Karen (PS01F)              [903] No, it isn't.
                           [904] It gonna [...] to be a building society.
Albert (PS01A)             [905] Oh, well, it might be Abbey National.
Karen (PS01F)              [906] No, it's come back, it's got Target Finance on
                           it.
Albert (PS01A)             [907] Ah.
                           [908] Well that's o that is a finance company ...
                           and not a building society.
                           [909] If it says finance, it doesn't mean a building
                           society.
                           [910] Nine times out of ten, it's a finance company.
                           [911] Same as er, Mercantile, and
June (PS01B)               [912] Well, 'cos I mean, we dealt with Mercantile,
                           we dealt with Key Finance,
Albert (PS01A)             [913] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [914] Er ...
Albert (PS01A)             [915] We've dealt with summat Wagon.
June (PS01B)               [916] Key, that, when we first bo when we first
                           bought our car through that Scottis that bloody
                           bank.
Albert (PS01A)             [917] Scottish Amicable.
June (PS01B)               [918] Scottish Amicable.
Karen (PS01F)              [919] Like Widows.
June (PS01B)               [920] They're always ringing up.
                           [921] They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at
                           night.
Karen (PS01F)              [922] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [923] Asking us whether we want to borrow some
                           money.
June (PS01B)               [924] Er, asking if there's anything we co , look at
                           him walking about with that [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [925] Everything, everything, what oh, papers have
                           got, has got Legal and General on it.
June (PS01B)               [926] Mm.
Karen (PS01F)              [927] So, I thought, well
Albert (PS01A)             [928] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [929] it can't be a a dodgy ...
June (PS01B)               [930] I don't think it'll be anything dodgy.
Albert (PS01A)             [931] It won't be dodgy.
Karen (PS01F)              [932] Oh.
Albert (PS01A)             [933] But you can always, easily find out
June (PS01B)               [934] What usually happens, though.
Albert (PS01A)             [935] All you do, is pick the phone up and and get,
                           oh now, what place do you ring.
                           [936] I forgot what place you ring, but we're find
                           out, and you ring up to see what they're, what the
                           company's like.
                           [937] You know, if it's a variable company.
Karen (PS01F)              [938] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [939] Things like that, you could do that.
June (PS01B)               [940] Different companies take over, I remember that
                           time we borrowed that four thousand pound.
                           [941] We started out with Key Finance and we ended
                           up with Mercantile Credit, didn't we?
Albert (PS01A)             [942] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [943] Changed companies three times, that time we
                           had that four thousand pounds.
Karen (PS01F)              [944] You told me about that, yeah.
                           [945] Well [...] said that it will be a sm a really
                           small building society.
                           [946] He says, that, 'cos er, it's not
Albert (PS01A)             [947] Well.
Karen (PS01F)              [948] Big building societies are not prepared to
                           give you rates, and small building societies are
                           wanting to get going
Albert (PS01A)             [949] You see, the only trouble with building
                           societies is, it's the same when you buy a pigging
                           house , they put the money on what you've actually
                           borrowed every year.
Karen (PS01F)              [950] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [951] Well, finance companies only, you only get the
                           interest on what is left.
June (PS01B)               [952] On the money that you owe.
Karen (PS01F)              [953] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [954] That's the difference.
                           [955] And between them both, you can, you could ...
                           I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a
                           mortgage, mortgage, and you could end up paying
                           what, twenty thousand, twenty four thousand ...
                           back.
Karen (PS01F)              [956] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [957] Well, finance company.
                           [958] You, you borrow ten grand or twenty grand
                           whatever you like to, and you get a certain amount
                           put on that, and that's it, it's fixed.
Karen (PS01F)              [959] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [960] You don't pay no more.
                           [961] Say you'll, you'll you'll get twenty thousand
                           five hundred, that, if you buy, if you borrow twenty
                           thousand just for er round figures.
                           [962] You borrow twenty thousand, and the interest
                           payments works out
June (PS01B)               [963] Benji
Albert (PS01A)             [964] very high
June (PS01B)               [965] He's alright.
Albert (PS01A)             [966] It's very high, you know, the interest
                           payments are very high, but for that money you've
                           borrowed you'll only pay say, just for a a figure,
                           five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand,
                           five you know,
Karen (PS01F)              [967] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [968] five thousand pound, not.
Karen (PS01F)              [969] Not paying it for years and years all the
                           time.
Albert (PS01A)             [970] But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage
                           company, you're gonna, you're gonna borrow twice
                           that, you gonna have to pay twice that much back.
                           [971] Forty grand, you kn that's the only
                           difference, and
Karen (PS01F)              [972] I don't mind that so much though, 'cos they
                           say we are paying a lot less back a month than other
                           way.
                           [973] But I just got one thing that I want, that
                           they gonna send me owt dodgy like a loan shark bloke
                           or owt like that, I mean you, you're bound to be a
                           bit nervous, you know.
Albert (PS01A)             [974] No, they won't send a loan shark.
                           [975] You you can tell loan sharks, straight away,
                           because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent .
                           [976] Ma maybe twenty nine, even thirty, depending,
                           but if it er, mind you I don't know, because it's a
                           long time since I had a look at 'em.
                           [977] But, you know, when you when you borrow money,
                           you get er, an interest rate, don't you, over so
                           many,yo you've got to figure out ho how many years
                           you're gonna pay it back.
                           [978] You know.
                           [979] If you say, oh, we'll take it over ten years.
                           [980] Well you've got ten years interest to pay,
                           ain't ya.
                           [981] So you pay the interest for for nine years,
                           and they start paying your loan off.
Karen (PS01F)              [982] We're still having trouble getting insurance,
                           and er, anyway I phoned, and I wrote him again
                           yesterday, and he's given this number, who er, who
                           he's with.
                           [983] 'Cos he had a right job, [...] got plastic,
                           'cos he even [...] plastics, I mean that's
Albert (PS01A)             [984] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [985] Inflammable, ain't it.
                           [986] Anyway, er, the bloke who managed to get him
                           insurance, this this, the premises are insured with
                           him,
Albert (PS01A)             [987] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [988] so I thought, well, if he's already got, er,
                           part of his insurance without having [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [989] Yeah, because he was in, paper, waste paper,
                           and the fire insurance on that must have been
                           colossal.
Karen (PS01F)              [990] That's where [...] cardboard and paper.
Albert (PS01A)             [991] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [992] Sasha come in here, shut door.
Sasha (PS01G)              [993] He's not coming in.
Albert (PS01A)             [994] But er, I can't understand why, because I
                           mean, let's face it,he he's only using fibre-glass
                           and they're not that flammable
Karen (PS01F)              [995] No, what they're saying is.
                           [996] Not the flammable, it's the er indemnity,
                           nobody can breathing it in who's in [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [997] Oh, yeah, yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [998] They're frightened like, in years to come,
                           like, they're gonna try and make a claim against
                           them 'cos their er, been on the chest, is summat
                           like that.
Albert (PS01A)             [999] Yeah.
                           [1000] I, it's health and safety, yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1001] [...] er.
Albert (PS01A)             [1002] Through the health and safety, but.
June (PS01B)               [1003] Eighty four we had this extension put up.
Albert (PS01A)             [1004] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1005] Sasha come in here.
Albert (PS01A)             [1006] But, after saying that,
Karen (PS01F)              [1007] There's a draught in [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1008] what you gotta do, is make up your mind, what
                           chemicals you're gonna use
Karen (PS01F)              [1009] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1010] and then find out all about
Karen (PS01F)              [1011] What ya got?
Sasha (PS01G)              [1012] Don't know.
Albert (PS01A)             [1013] them particular chemicals and then submit it
                           to the, the insurance company, what them's the only
                           chemicals you use, and the company said this and
                           that.
Karen (PS01F)              [1014] [...] they told him that.
Albert (PS01A)             [1015] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1016] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1017] And they still
Karen (PS01F)              [1018] See he's off again, [...] I bet it is.
                           [1019] Just started itching. [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1020] Well, he has just flown about.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1021] I say, he's just flown round bloody house,
Karen (PS01F)              [1022] He has.
Albert (PS01A)             [1023] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1024] Oh.
                           [1025] I bet [...]
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1026] 'cos I thought I'd look.
June (PS01B)               [1027] Aye.
Karen (PS01F)              [1028] I couldn't [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1029] It might be dust out of his wings.
Karen (PS01F)              [1030] Yeah ... I [...] every time I come here.
                           [laugh]
June (PS01B)               [1031] Nineteen ninety one, ninety two.
Karen (PS01F)              [1032] I must have sensitive eyes
June (PS01B)               [1033] Eighteen hundred and fifty two.
Albert (PS01A)             [1034] Dear me.
June (PS01B)               [1035] We've had that pebble-dash nearly, nearly,
                           it's nearly two years since they did that pebble-
                           dash.
                           [1036] Cost us two thousand nine hundred, and in two
                           years, we've only paid, eight hundred, nine hundred
                           ...
Albert (PS01A)             [...]
June (PS01B)               [1037] A hundred
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [1038] A hundred and forty pound,
Albert (PS01A)             [...]
June (PS01B)               [1039] we've paid off in two years, Karen.
Karen (PS01F)              [1040] How much.
June (PS01B)               [1041] A hundred and forty pound.
Albert (PS01A)             [1042] In two years.
June (PS01B)               [1043] In two years.
Albert (PS01A)             [1044] Now, if that had been a finance company, I
                           would have paid a damn sight more.
June (PS01B)               [1045] But it cost us ... thirty seven pound a
                           month.
                           [1046] But, last year, we put, no wait a minute,
                           last year, we paid 'em four hundred and eight pound
                           fifty two, and they put two hundred and seventy two
                           pound fifty interest on.
                           [1047] So actually all we paid, was
Albert (PS01A)             [1048] Thirty seven, per cent
June (PS01B)               [1049] Thirty odd, thirty [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1050] That's round about thirty-seven per cent,
                           innit, somewhere around there.
June (PS01B)               [1051] Yeah, we paid thirty eight pound off it last
                           year.
Albert (PS01A)             [1052] Makes more.
                           [1053] It's ridiculous, you know, mortgage payments.
                           [1054] When you think of it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1055] I know.
June (PS01B)               [1056] and on 'ouse, they put eight hundred and
                           ninety eight pound, you could say, nine hundred
                           pound interest on 'ouse.
Albert (PS01A)             [1057] Oi.
                           [1058] I don't know how they get away with mortgage
                           payments like they are, because, you know,it it's
                           totally unfair,
Karen (PS01F)              [1059] They are.
Albert (PS01A)             [1060] I mean, alright, we know you're handling
                           large lumps of money, but when you think of it, if
                           you, if you, borrowed it at a different rate, you
                           know, same rate as you could do finance, 'cos which
                           I think the government could do it and make a profit
                           at it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1061] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1062] You know what I mean.
                           [1063] Instead of having all these different
                           mortgage companies, Abbey National and that, the
                           government have er, have er, a whatsname to do it,
                           they're wouldn't be half and a quarter.
                           [1064] I mean, it happens all over the world, you
                           know, in in the in the especially in the whatsname
                           countries.
Karen (PS01F)              [1065] I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [1066] Communist countries.
                           [1067] Everything's owned by the by the government
                           and er, I know it's not a right good thing, like,
                           but if it could work properly, it would be a damn
                           good thing.
June (PS01B)               [1068] Watch she don't bite ya.
Albert (PS01A)             [1069] I mean, communism in England,
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1070] in it's ... in it's proper form would be a
                           wonderful thing, but er, it's on because er, it's
                           only the rich people what make people poor.
Karen (PS01F)              [1071] I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [1072] The say as with damn education, like, at
                           bloody Tory sods, they took all blinking, we gi for
                           al for all these people what's going to college,
                           every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing
                           to keep 'em.
Karen (PS01F)              [1073] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [1074] So I my opinion, what this government's doing
                           is stopping stopping the lower class, well I say
                           lower classes, the lo the the
June (PS01B)               [1075] [...] isn't it.
Albert (PS01A)             [1076] poorer people, they stop 'em getting
                           educated.
                           [1077] That I'm I'm almost convinced.
Karen (PS01F)              [1078] Yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1079] It says, everything they're doing, it says,
                           is going back to the eighteenth century, when you
                           hear about these Kath Catherine Cookson days,
                           working for pennies and you can't get educated
June (PS01B)               [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1080] un cutting back,
Albert (PS01A)             [1081] They're cutting back on education.
June (PS01B)               [1082] Oh, you're telling me ...
Albert (PS01A)             [1083] They're making it so only the rich can be
                           educated.
Karen (PS01F)              [1084] Yeah, trying to turn it back into [...]
June (PS01B)               [1085] [...] at the end of the day.
Albert (PS01A)             [1086] I mean, our Colin's there waiting for a grant
                           and what's happening.
                           [1087] Sweet nothing.
                           [1088] Now we're, it were in bloody paper last ...
                           on Thursday, they don't get nothing when they're on
                           holiday.
Karen (PS01F)              [1089] No, they don't,
Albert (PS01A)             [1090] I mean, how the hell they supposed at
                           eighteen year old without a job.
Karen (PS01F)              [1091] Mm.
Albert (PS01A)             [1092] If they have a job, they don't get no grants.
                           [1093] And how can you have, hold a ... a job down
Karen (PS01F)              [1094] I don't think ...
Albert (PS01A)             [1095] And do education at same time.
Karen (PS01F)              [1096] I'm not sure, but ... I think I don't got my
                           family allowance until I were eighteen, I think, I
                           think they used to give us [...]
June (PS01B)               [1097] [...] let me keep our Karen's
Karen (PS01F)              [1098] Oh.

                           pay the rent, they've stopped that, so they've
                           either to gerra job, to help put supplement to pay

                           weeks money less, through the year, than they should
                           do, where they're used to paying all through year
Albert (PS01A)             [1120] For twelve months, now they don't.

June (PS01B)               [1135] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1136] The only way you can start a business, is by
                           starting it without insurance
June (PS01B)               [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1137] straight off your own back, and then, you
                           know, after it's running, get insurance.
Karen (PS01F)              [1138] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1139] That ho ninety five per cent of firms do
                           that.
June (PS01B)               [1140] [...] regulate.

                           broke into.
                           [1143] He's no insurance ... no insurance
                           whatsoever, 'cos he couldn't afford it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1144] I know.
                           [1145] Ours is gonna us about a thousand pound for
                           insurance.
June (PS01B)               [1146] Oh.
Albert (PS01A)             [1147] Well, a thousand pounds not a lot, Karen, but
                           er ... it all depends what the, what what you gonna
                           be insured for?
Sasha (PS01G)              [1148] It's not.
Albert (PS01A)             [1149] I mean, even that, you're gonna you you gonna
                           be insured for breaking in and break-ins and
Karen (PS01F)              [1150] Yeah, I think it's everything.
                           [1151] I think it's [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1152] That's what I mean, so what you're actually
                           getting for your, thousand pound isn't a lot of
                           money.
Karen (PS01F)              [1153] No.
                           [1154] I think it's covered for like, like you say,
                           like for some reason, say you had a fire, and you
                           had to stop work.
Albert (PS01A)             [1155] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1156] I think it's covered for that.
                           [1157] Covered for personal injury, er, covered for
                           hundred thousand, for like, that's what trailers,
                           [...] they've got [...] trailers in.
                           [1158] It's covered for everything.
Albert (PS01A)             [1159] I mean, you imagine somebody breaking in and
                           setting fire to a trailer.
Karen (PS01F)              [1160] I mean, it's a lot of money when you think
                           Norma's paying nine hundred pound just for her car.
                           [1161] For that Cabriolet.
                           [1162] To me, you think phew a thousand pound, but
                           cer I mean, it's it ain't really very much, no.
June (PS01B)               [1163] It's a high insurance for a car.
Albert (PS01A)             [1164] What for car?
June (PS01B)               [1165] [...] yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1166] Right [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1167] What how how comes that, then?
Karen (PS01F)              [1168] Because, well, Cabriolet's are classed as
                           dangerous, aren't they, because they're ... soft
                           roofed.
Albert (PS01A)             [1169] Oh, aye.
Karen (PS01F)              [1170] It's not got no ...

Karen (PS01F)              [1174] Yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]

June (PS01B)               [1178] Our Connie's were five hundred and seventy.
Albert (PS01A)             [...]
June (PS01B)               [1179] Now it's gone up to five hundred and seventy
                           because that accident.
Albert (PS01A)             [1180] I mean, when you look at it, it's for a third
                           party fire and theft.
                           [1181] Christ, that's gonna be a thousand pounds on
                           a full comprehensive, just about.

Albert (PS01A)             [1251] Keep it clean, there's only them two buggers.
Karen (PS01F)              [1252] I know, but what's the point of having a new
                           suite, and having old covers on it like that.
June (PS01B)               [1253] They make me laugh, when they sit in 'ouse
                           with blanket round them, so they don't have to turn

                           [...] be Wendy's side.
Albert (PS01A)             [1300] She's his cousin.
                           [1301] 'Cos I says to her one day, well why don't
                           you ask yer, your relation, if he'll er, if he'll
                           give yer a job.

                           the time of day with us.
Sasha (PS01G)              [singing]
Albert (PS01A)             [1303] I said, well, I, there must be summat there,

                           back a long time.

                           us.

                           puts the phone straight down, soon as you tell him
                           who it is.
June (PS01B)               [1306] Probably goes back from when they went [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1307] He said, I, she said I can live without him
                           anyhow.
June (PS01B)               [1308] It'll drop off, that.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1309] It won't.
June (PS01B)               [1310] It will.

Sasha (PS01G)              [laugh]
Albert (PS01A)             [1312] I found some Mighty Muscle in garage, you
                           know.
June (PS01B)               [1313] How much.

June (PS01B)               [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1315] I, not how much is in it, but it'll probably
                           be about that much in bottom.
June (PS01B)               [1316] I know [...] wanting [...] to do this room,

                           buy coal at that price.
June (PS01B)               [1320] No, I know.
                           [1321] Every time we have any spare money, it has to
                           go on pigging coal.
Sasha (PS01G)              [singing]
June (PS01B)               [1322] [...] how much.
Albert (PS01A)             [1323] You know that big round tin?
June (PS01B)               [1324] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1325] I don't know how much is in it, but probably
                           be about that much in bottom.
June (PS01B)               [1326] [...] might be [...] really, couldn't [...]
                           too cold.
Albert (PS01A)             [1327] Get away with one.
June (PS01B)               [1328] I wish we'd afford some [...] I mean, it's
                           cold.

                           coal, at that price.
June (PS01B)               [1330] No, I know.
                           [1331] Every time we have any spare money, it has to
                           go on pigging coal.
Sasha (PS01G)              [singing]
June (PS01B)               [1332] We'll probably just buy some, and that lad'll
                           ring up.
Albert (PS01A)             [1333] He probably will.
                           [1334] Especially if this mild weather stops.
                           [1335] But it is mild today, ain't it.
June (PS01B)               [1336] Yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...] [singing]
June (PS01B)               [1337] That's not a moo cow.
Albert (PS01A)             [1338] Get down.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1339] It is.
                           [1340] It is.
Albert (PS01A)             [1341] It isn't.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1342] Mooo.
June (PS01B)               [1343] That's it.
                           [1344] That's what moo cows do.
Albert (PS01A)             [1345] You're crackers.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1346] It is.
                           [1347] It is a moo cow.
Karen (PS01F)              [1348] I mean like er, Eileen was saying summat
                           yesterday, she said, she said I don't er, have [...]
                           at home, she said, I decided to [...] I said I'm
                           frightened, and sometimes [...] knows I'm not
                           frightened.
                           [1349] I said, I'm frightened someone's in the
                           'ouse, I'm frightened not waking everybody [...]
                           well, well what do you do, I says, you don't, unless
                           you have a go, you don't, I mean, if I'd turned out
                           [...] you know, you don't really know.
June (PS01B)               [1350] I know.
Karen (PS01F)              [1351] I mean, that
Albert (PS01A)             [1352] You might, and then again, you might be a
                           millionaire inside three months.
Karen (PS01F)              [1353] Yes, I said to her, think about it, I I was
                           that frightened, I frightened meself to death, and I
                           I wouldn't I wouldn't.
                           [1354] I hated it.
June (PS01B)               [1355] That's what I used to do every time I thought
                           about selling 'ouse [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1356] You just got to do it.
Albert (PS01A)             [1357] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1358] I thought about it, and thought about it, and
                           then then changed my mind.
                           [1359] But this time I decided it's what I want to
                           do and bugger it.
                           [1360] If we don't sell it, we we haven't lost
                           anything.
Albert (PS01A)             [1361] Oh well.
June (PS01B)               [1362] [...] sell it till we move.
Karen (PS01F)              [1363] I honestly think myself ...
June (PS01B)               [1364] As long as we're not worse off than what we
                           were before we moved.
Karen (PS01F)              [1365] I honestly think meself, that I might have a
                           have a couple of hard months, maybe three, first
                           three months might be a bit difficult for me.
Albert (PS01A)             [1366] Oh, it probably will be.
Karen (PS01F)              [1367] Well, I think, once he gets established, and
                           once he starts getting work in, I think meself, that
                           work will start, won't say rolling in, but I think
                           the work'll start coming in after about three months
                           and I can get established.
Albert (PS01A)             [1368] Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten
                           pences.
Karen (PS01F)              [1369] I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [1370] I know we're hard up, but you can ten pence.
Karen (PS01F)              [1371] You never know, might be [...] to make enough
                           money to take you out somewhere for a decent
                           Christmas do.

                           interested in.

                           get any money coming in, and if you go on to family
                           credit, you get it for six months, so that'll be our
                           wages.

                           the valuation.

                           money out it.
June (PS01B)               [1444] That's it.
Albert (PS01A)             [...]

                           they'll have to pay whatever it cost for 'em to
                           value our 'ouse, see if it's worth lending money,
                           we'll have the same thing with er bungalow, down

Karen (PS01F)              [1459] Oh yeah, yeah,

                           National and we had to pay, well we did pay 'im
                           fifty pound, people that put the building on paid.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1463] [...] she keeps getting up.
June (PS01B)               [1464] She's not.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1465] She is.

Karen (PS01F)              [1467] She scratched him outside, didn't she.
June (PS01B)               [1468] And, if she were here three and a half
                           minutes, that's all she were 'ere, and it and it 'em
                           fifty quid.

Albert (PS01A)             [1470] Bloody ridiculous.
June (PS01B)               [1471] It's all a bloody money making racket.
Karen (PS01F)              [1472] Another thing is, I'll tell why we don't want
                           er, they always having valuations, they are, they
                           come and value it, and then they give us money.
                           [1473] That means we're gonna be paying extra eleven
                           thousand with money we ain't got.
June (PS01B)               [1474] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1475] That's another reason we're daren't send it
                           off.
Albert (PS01A)             [1476] Yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1477] Yeah, because if ya, if ya, get it before ya
                           start your business.
                           [1478] You've still got it to pay as soon as you get
                           it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1479] Yeah.
                           [1480] Trust them, because it's in their [...] at
                           the moment.
                           [1481] Well, I still believe in [...] and I don't
                           pushed around and say, no you can't have money, no
                           you can't get insured, and so that means [...]
                           others.
June (PS01B)               [1482] You haven't lost anything have ya?
Karen (PS01F)              [1483] Well, just er disappointment, I suppose.
                           [1484] For what
June (PS01B)               [1485] Well, yeah,
Karen (PS01F)              [1486] Then again, I mean, I [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1487] There's always summat else you can go and do.
Karen (PS01F)              [1488] You know that, doing that, fabricating, and
                           things like that, you know like actual welding and
                           that type of [...] Er, we wouldn't make as much
                           money out of that as you probably would
June (PS01B)               [1489] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [1490] No, you'll be, you'll be stuck to it, all
                           time, and it's not good for 'im.
Karen (PS01F)              [1491] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [1492] And it kills your eyes welding.
June (PS01B)               [1493] Benjy.
Albert (PS01A)             [1494] But as he said to me, why don't you go [...]
                           welding.
                           [1495] I says, the point is I've got bad eyes as it
                           is,
Karen (PS01F)              [1496] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1497] what's the point in making them worse.
Karen (PS01F)              [1498] I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [1499] So, jump in me box, and I ain't jumping in me
                           box blind, for the last ten years.
                           [1500] I'll manage the way I am. [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1501] You see, that works where I
June (PS01B)               [1502] Benjy
Albert (PS01A)             [1503] Aye,
June (PS01B)               [1504] Benjy, look at 'im.
                           [1505] Benjy
Albert (PS01A)             [...] [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1506] Where are you, when it's gonna be, he said
                           corner, then we'll make an office and a little
                           canteen in that anyway.
                           [1507] Then there's another long unit right at side
                           of it, just enough to get one trailer in.
                           [1508] I said, I said, if we do get going, and we do
                           start finding out that it's going alright, he'll
                           turn that, into like er, shop er, blasting shop.
                           [1509] And like,
Albert (PS01A)             [1510] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1511] A spray area, then
June (PS01B)               [1512] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1513] Employ a sprayer.
                           [1514] So, I mean, we know what we want, but ...
                           it's them and not us, I mean, it is frightening to
                           start a business up, 'cos we don't know how much
                           work we'll be getting, but, I mean,
June (PS01B)               [1515] Well, it's same for anybody starting any
                           business, ain't it, you don't know if it's gonna
                           work [...] as well.
Albert (PS01A)             [1516] It might go well for the first three or four
                           months, and then all of a sudden we might have a
                           lapse in a few months ,
Karen (PS01F)              [1517] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1518] you could be struggling to keep it above ...
Karen (PS01F)              [1519] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1520] and especially, you know, these bloody big
                           firms, they do not like paying bloody bills.
Karen (PS01F)              [1521] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [1522] I mean, you could have as as much as two or
                           three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business
                           will still go under.
Karen (PS01F)              [1523] Yeah, because of it.
Albert (PS01A)             [1524] Because of it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1525] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1526] They don't look on them things, how much
                           you've got owed out to ya.
                           [1527] I know.
June (PS01B)               [1528] When you look you see everything's a bloody
                           risk,
Albert (PS01A)             [1529] Let's hope he gets off the floor.
June (PS01B)               [1530] walking across roads a risk, ain't it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1531] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1532] It's ju just if you've got the nerve to do
                           it.
Albert (PS01A)             [1533] It's a risk with these buggers, what's in
                           power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1534] I got [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1535] I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it
                           tough at all.
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Albert (PS01A)             [1536] I can tell you that, now.
June (PS01B)               [1537] Oohh.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1538] What?
June (PS01B)               [1539] Oohh.
Karen (PS01F)              [1540] You feel like [...] er, that's whose, like ex
                           soldiers [...] throughout the company, and he said
                           to Colin er, he said, how many people are you
                           thinking about employ , our Colin seems to think
                           there'd be enough work to keep 'im going, like, he
                           says, he says, well how many people are you thinking
                           about employing, he says, only only me and me [...]
                           like, it's oh, oh, he says, there's plenty of work
                           to keep two of going, he said, I thought you
                           employed about six.
                           [1541] So if he thinks that Colin do have six
                           working for him, and he's got enough work for six,
                           then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two
                           of 'em.
Albert (PS01A)             [1542] Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets
                           the jobs done quicker [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1543] Yeah, but then you still got six wages to pay
                           out, haven't ya.
June (PS01B)               [1544] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1545] That's it.
                           [1546] He probably will have six later on, if he
                           gets it off, but ... the thing is, I mean, he'll
                           need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half
                           the time,y you know, he'll be sat doing nothing,
                           scratching his nose.
                           [1547] Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the
                           people that want a job, but don't wanna work for it.
                           [1548] There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and
                           Stainford,
Karen (PS01F)              [1549] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1550] round about here.

                           that, he wants, you know, best worker what he can
                           [...]
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Albert (PS01A)             [1552] Yeah, but I mean, working for a mate, is
                           different to working for a firm.
Karen (PS01F)              [1553] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1554] You know, I mean
Karen (PS01F)              [1555] Well, he's not a mate, he won't, he's working
                           with him when he were at er [...] over in Brad oh,

                           Richard is the one with the [...] comical magazine,
                           [...] laughing bursts two incomes.
                           [1558] I think that's part of [...]

                           a quiet weekend.
Albert (PS01A)             [1565] Where's Gavin like, is he with Colin?

Albert (PS01A)             [cough] [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1645] To be quite honest, without talking like a
                           school [...] on a fence.
                           [1646] They're not very happy, they ain't been happy

Albert (PS01A)             [1648] Yeah.

Albert (PS01A)             [cough]
Karen (PS01F)              [1650] And then it twists, and like a small office,
                           and when when I were there, after Michael had shown
                           it me and Colin, he says oh, he says, er I'm come in

                           you problems.
June (PS01B)               [1654] Don't knock my dusters off.

                           he said, [...] and so I thought, ah.
June (PS01B)               [1659] Yeah but, there's not many people that you
                           can [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1660] Sasha, behave.
June (PS01B)               [1661] I don't think I know anybody that hundred per
                           cent 'appy.
                           [1662] Well, I think it's got a lot to do with the
                           climate we're living in, you know,
Karen (PS01F)              [1663] Rushing about
June (PS01B)               [1664] There's that much, there's that many people
                           out of work, there's and [bird chirping]
Albert (PS01A)             [cough]
June (PS01B)               [1665] you know, there's that many pressures on
                           people.
Karen (PS01F)              [1666] I mean, it's like like Colin and I, I mean,
                           like we're happy but then, no were not hundred per
                           cent happy at all, [...] But like, er, like some
                           people I can't [...] if you get upset, some people
                           eat more, some people eat less, or you know, some go
                           into recluse, some get [...] and like Colin,
June (PS01B)               [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1667] he's when he's depressed, he's goes like a
                           raving sex mania, he
June (PS01B)               [1668] I'm bloody glad Albert don't, he'll drive me
                           [...] out of a bed.
Karen (PS01F)              [1669] He takes all, takes all his [...] [laugh]
Sasha (PS01G)              [singing]
June (PS01B)               [1670] Why didn't you stop [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1671] No I think every [...]
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1672] I think everybody's got themselves summat
                           some faults.
June (PS01B)               [1673] Nobody's hundred per cent perfect.
Karen (PS01F)              [1674] I mean, I don't think Colin's unhappy where
                           he wants to do, then an offers an offer, like either
                           they go in and make [...] share, but if they work
                           all day.
Albert (PS01A)             [1675] No, it's not er, it's so much ... I mean,
                           he's at work all day, [...] and he works all bloody
                           hours that God sent, when they want, when they got
                           down,
Karen (PS01F)              [1676] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1677] and what happens.
                           [1678] He's got to build an office where he can go
                           and let, sit in it, can't abide [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1679] That's right.
Albert (PS01A)             [1680] Summat wrong somewhere.
June (PS01B)               [1681] Now look at our Margaret and Peter.
                           [1682] They've got no family, so they've got no
                           pressures like that, they haven't got any money
                           problems ... well they're not 'appy.
                           [1683] They live two entirely separate lives.
Karen (PS01F)              [1684] Yeah, I know.
                           [1685] There's is just a marriage of er convenience.
June (PS01B)               [1686] Convenience.
Karen (PS01F)              [1687] Innit it.
Albert (PS01A)             [1688] Yeah, it's convenient [...]
June (PS01B)               [1689] It's a way of life, they've lived together
                           that long, like, they don't want to [...]
June (PS01B)               [1690] If when you and Pete had that trouble, if our
                           Margaret had er been working, I honestly think she
                           would have left Pete.
Karen (PS01F)              [1691] I know.
June (PS01B)               [1692] But the only thing that our Margaret could
                           come up with, was why should I, why should I leave
                           me home and sell up, she said, when all my life,
                           he's had money from the house.
                           [1693] He'll have the money from the house, plus a
                           wage every week.
                           [1694] She said, and what will I have, she said,
                           just the money from the house.
                           [1695] She said, and where do I live.
                           [1696] You know, he can move back home with his mum,
                           she said, I suppose I can go back home to me mum,
                           well then I've got to look for a job, you know.
Karen (PS01F)              [1697] Mm.
June (PS01B)               [1698] And I honestly think that was the only reason
                           that she stopped for Pete.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [1699] Yes.
                           [1700] Because, she's she, he he were gonna get a
                           wage every week.
Karen (PS01F)              [1701] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1702] You know, and she worked all them years, and
                           then when she weren't working, she have no money
                           coming in every week.
Albert (PS01A)             [1703] Yeah, but she's got all the shares.
June (PS01B)               [1704] She hasn't, she got rid of them all.
Albert (PS01A)             [1705] Aye, not with Bl not with [...]
June (PS01B)               [1706] Yeah, but you could see, you could see, that,
                           I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty
                           pound a week.
Albert (PS01A)             [1707] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1708] We'll he had his money he won't have to
                           touch, he could live on that hundred and twenty
                           pound a week.
Albert (PS01A)             [1709] Oh, aye,
June (PS01B)               [1710] And he could start again.
                           [1711] Find another woman and buy another house and
                           start again.
Karen (PS01F)              [1712] Mm.
                           [1713] I mean like Jeremy and Kay, I mean, they're
                           not happy.
                           [1714] They pretend they are, but I mean like, he's
                           he's
June (PS01B)               [1715] They've got to do, aren't they, I mean, after
                           all bloody [...] harm they caused.
Karen (PS01F)              [1716] Yeah, you know, you know how flaming
                           miserable and mardy he is.
June (PS01B)               [1717] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1718] He's another one.
                           [1719] But you see when he living with Ange, maybe
                           he were younger then, but I mean like, when he were
                           living with Ange, he had all the women as you know,
                           plus he had Kay, plus he had, you know, Ange, he had
                           everything, there was Kay, [...] as well, weren't
                           he, now he can't.
June (PS01B)               [1720] No.
Karen (PS01F)              [1721] But then again, if, even Kay over there with
                           [...] she said something about er, oh we've been
                           out, but, I told you I went to a [...] last Monday.
June (PS01B)               [1722] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1723] [...] and she said something about, oh we've
                           been to that new pub, she said, mind, she said, we
                           had to come home at half past nine, she said, he'd
                           had enough, she said, he were ready for bed, God,
                           she said he's turning into a right old man, and you
                           know what I mean, she didn't, she wouldn't,
Albert (PS01A)             [1724] Exactly.
Karen (PS01F)              [1725] She didn't realise what she was saying as
                           such, but I thought, and I thought, yeah I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [1726] Yeah, well he is, what ten years.
Karen (PS01F)              [1727] Thirteen you got from 'er.
Albert (PS01A)             [1728] Thirteen years difference.
Karen (PS01F)              [1729] She's, how old am I, twenty-two, so she's
                           twenty-nine.
                           [1730] Same age as our Kim
Albert (PS01A)             [1731] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1732] Oh she'll be coming at thirty this year,
                           won't she?
Albert (PS01A)             [1733] You see, she's just coming into her prime,
                           and now he's he's just leaving it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1734] [...] yeah.
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Karen (PS01F)              [1735] He's really forty-three this year.
Albert (PS01A)             [1736] Don't work.
Karen (PS01F)              [1737] He'll be forty-three this year, and she'll be
                           thirty this year. [bird chirping]
Albert (PS01A)             [1738] The only thing, time that happens is, that is
                           you hear about,
Sasha (PS01G)              [1739] Look George [...]

June (PS01B)               [1741] He's plucking his feathers out.
Albert (PS01A)             [1742] then it works.
                           [1743] But when your younger it, or even when you're
                           young, you know, it does.
                           [1744] But when you get into your forties ...
Karen (PS01F)              [1745] Well, it's like, I mean like,
Albert (PS01A)             [1746] ... It works.

                           lot compared to what we were five year ago.
                           [1748] I mean, like, like now, we were a, say even
                           two and three years ago and [...] somebody'd said to
                           me, are you going to Spain, and I would have said,
                           yeah, we'll go to Majorca, lovely, we could stop out
                           all night, do what you want.
                           [1749] Now only three or four years later I'd say of
                           yeah we're go to somewhere a bit quieter, so that
                           kids can go to bed of a night time, we could have a
                           [...] apartment.

June (PS01B)               [1751] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1752] And that, I'm changing that way, but, if our
                           kids have to be home with the, a group, when I went
                           to see Squeeze.

                           [1756] Kay's wanted to do what we do, and Johnny's
                           not interested.

Albert (PS01A)             [1786] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1787] He should be keeping himself young for 'er.
June (PS01B)               [1788] Mm.
Albert (PS01A)             [1789] Instead of 'er keeping him young, she's, he's
                           making her old.
Karen (PS01F)              [1790] That's it, yeah.

                           they've been married.
Karen (PS01F)              [1796] God.
June (PS01B)               [1797] I were talking to him on Friday, and er, I
                           mean, they've not been down there five minutes.
Karen (PS01F)              [1798] Oh no, Road.

Karen (PS01F)              [1804] Wait a minute.
June (PS01B)               [1805] Er, Derek, paid him off,
Karen (PS01F)              [1806] Yeah.

Sasha (PS01G)              [1808] Mummy.
June (PS01B)               [1809] and er, I I saw Chris quite a lot, then, but
                           I mean, they're not living how they used to do, I
                           mean, they they were always boozing and that, [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1810] Yeah, I know.
June (PS01B)               [1811] she said they'd they'd cut down on boozing
                           and everything.
                           [1812] [cough] But er,
Karen (PS01F)              [1813] Give up, Sasha.
June (PS01B)               [1814] I says to Tommy, why don't they buy one of
                           them big caravans, I said, because every time they
                           get ...
Sasha (PS01G)              [1815] Mum.
June (PS01B)               [1816] it must be costing them a fortune, when every
                           time they move, they alter 'ouse, they decorate and
                           put new carpets down and [...] furniture
Karen (PS01F)              [1817] My God, we'll have to [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1818] Yeah, well, I mean, I mean not ...
June (PS01B)               [1819] Yeah but I mean, twelve times, Karen.
Karen (PS01F)              [1820] I know.
                           [1821] You're saying like us, I mean, we wouldn't
                           want to move again, I mean, if we move again, it's
                           'cos something's gonna happen with his business,
                           ain't it,
June (PS01B)               [1822] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1823] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1824] But, or because same thing like it were a
                           couple of years ago, with finances.
June (PS01B)               [1825] I mean, how how olds their oldest [...] , is
                           it eighteen or seventeen.
Karen (PS01F)              [1826] Is it Mandy whose older,
June (PS01B)               [1827] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1828] I mean, I thought Mandy's er, eighteen,
                           nearly nineteen.
June (PS01B)               [1829] So.
Karen (PS01F)              [1830] Oh no, she must be older because er, Vicky's
                           twenty ... she must be about eighteen.
                           [1831] No, she's same age a Treena, twenty.
June (PS01B)               [1832] So in twenty years, they've had twelve 'ouses
Karen (PS01F)              [1833] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1834] And you've been married how long?
Karen (PS01F)              [1835] Twelve.
June (PS01B)               [1836] Twelve years, and you've had three.
Karen (PS01F)              [1837] Three.
June (PS01B)               [1838] Christ, you better not be married twenty
                           years, Karen, you might end up with another twelve.
Karen (PS01F)              [1839] I know, but how many's your Pete and Margaret
                           have, they had er,
June (PS01B)               [1840] Er, they moved, they went on to
Albert (PS01A)             [1841] One, two, three.
June (PS01B)               [1842] didn't they.
Karen (PS01F)              [1843] Yeah, then t'
June (PS01B)               [1844] Yeah, then, now they went to ... aye, they
                           went to Oval, went to bungalow
Karen (PS01F)              [1845] [...] yeah some four times.
June (PS01B)               [1846] four, yeah, four or five times, yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1847] Yeah.
                           [1848] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1849] There's only us who never moved.
Albert (PS01A)             [1850] Oh yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
June (PS01B)               [1851] Angie [...] how long's me mother been in
                           there.
                           [1852] I'm forty-eight this year, me mum must have
                           been in there nearly fifty year.
Albert (PS01A)             [1853] And we've only moved into here.
Karen (PS01F)              [1854] In actual fact your Pete and Margaret have
                           moved more, in the twelve years that they were
                           married, I know they've been married longer now, but
                           when,th they been married twelve years and they
                           moved four times,
June (PS01B)               [1855] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1856] we've been married twelve years, and we've
                           moved three times, so we haven't moved as much as
                           them, really.
Albert (PS01A)             [1857] No.
                           [1858] No.
June (PS01B)               [1859] I couldn't keep moving and [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1860] I couldn't move like that.
June (PS01B)               [1861] I mean, a couple of moves, is fair enough,
                           yeah, but bloody twelve.
Karen (PS01F)              [1862] No.
June (PS01B)               [1863] And it's not as if they made money every time
                           they moved, 'cos they haven't, 'cos they lost money
                           on that 'ouse, there.
Albert (PS01A)             [1864] Yes.
Karen (PS01F)              [1865] I [...] won't it.
June (PS01B)               [1866] Well, Chris said they moved because er,
Sasha (PS01G)              [...]
Karen (PS01F)              [1867] Give up.
June (PS01B)               [1868] er, transport, you know.
                           [1869] It would be difficult for 'er to get
                           back'ards and for'ards, and she were on her own all
                           the time.
Karen (PS01F)              [1870] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1871] That's why they moved.
                           [1872] But they moved down, they moved from 'ere
                           because he says, er,
Albert (PS01A)             [1873] Too noisy, weren't it.
June (PS01B)               [1874] Too too noisy and dogs were keeping them up
                           all night.
Karen (PS01F)              [1875] Oh.
June (PS01B)               [1876] So I don't what the excuse is for moving from
                           ... Road.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1877] Same thing, 'cos it's noisy down there.
Karen (PS01F)              [1878] Yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1879] I could scare you, Auntie June.
June (PS01B)               [1880] Could ya.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1881] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [1882] Go on then.
Karen (PS01F)              [1883] Why people think it's noisy for us on a
                           double main road, but it ain't really.
June (PS01B)               [1884] Well, you get used it in don't ya.
                           [1885] When our Norma come and stop here, she she
                           was,
Albert (PS01A)             [1886] Used to sleep [...]
June (PS01B)               [1887] I don't know how you sleep all night with all
                           that traffic going up and down.
Karen (PS01F)              [1888] No.
June (PS01B)               [1889] But we never hear it.
Albert (PS01A)             [1890] You don't hear it.
Karen (PS01F)              [1891] No, we didn't.
                           [1892] I remember one [...] first night we stopped
                           there, buses were coming at crack of dawn,
June (PS01B)               [cough]
Albert (PS01A)             [1893] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1894] it must have been about four or five o'clock
                           in morning, and now we never hear any traffic.
June (PS01B)               [1895] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [1896] No.
                           [1897] Perhaps you get used to.
Karen (PS01F)              [1898] Yeah.
                           [1899] But we don't hear many people, on a road like
                           that.
June (PS01B)               [1900] No.
                           [1901] I were thinking about that bungalow, and,
                           well actually it's as far from ... our road, nearly
                           as far from our road to there, as what is it from
                           bungalow window to road.
Albert (PS01A)             [1902] Where to ... yeah.
Sasha (PS01G)              [1903] [...] it really is [...]
June (PS01B)               [1904] Know, thinking about people walking back as
                           far as t' shopping my point.
                           [1905] There nowt much difference in, from t' garden
                           ...
Karen (PS01F)              [1906] I think the only trouble over there, is your
                           to gonna have people parking in front of ya gate,
                           like when they go to the chip shop.
Albert (PS01A)             [1907] They won't
June (PS01B)               [1908] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1909] They won't 'cos 'cos er, I'm afraid if they
                           do, I shall be out straight away at 'em.
June (PS01B)               [1910] Well, it's only a matter of parking at,
                           parking your own car as well
Albert (PS01A)             [1911] I'll clamp the bugger, I'll buy a wheel clamp
                           and wheel clamp it.
                           [1912] Park here at your risk.
June (PS01B)               [1913] It'll be awkward getting cars in and out,
                           when you know, with one more to be out and, all
                           these cars in road, like, but.
Albert (PS01A)             [1914] That's the only difficulty.
Karen (PS01F)              [1915] You'll probably end up say, leaving one on
                           road all night.
June (PS01B)               [1916] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1917] Don't hurt [...] I mean, [...]
Albert (PS01A)             [1918] Oh, not leaving one on bloody road [...]
June (PS01B)               [1919] Well, we could put 'em at night time, it's
                           just through time, if one backs in, comes in behind
                           other.
Karen (PS01F)              [1920] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [1921] It's a one way street and all ain't it, that
                           makes it worse.
June (PS01B)               [1922] Why does it make it worse?
Karen (PS01F)              [1923] Well, we don't have to have a problem, do we?
Albert (PS01A)             [1924] No, but I mean.
Karen (PS01F)              [1925] It's like barbed wire, I mean that's, Sasha
                           come in 'ere.
June (PS01B)               [1926] What backs onto that bungalow, Karen.
Albert (PS01A)             [1927] Another 'ouse.
Karen (PS01F)              [1928] Another 'ouse.
June (PS01B)               [1929] Another 'ouse.
Karen (PS01F)              [1930] Er, I told you what backs onto it, you know
                           the right small on , what you were going to see that
                           time, but on the side.
June (PS01B)               [1931] Yeah.
Karen (PS01F)              [1932] We went to see that, [...]
June (PS01B)               [1933] Oh.

                 rope just snapped in two, and it jerked both cars and it cut
                 off the fuel.

Corrinne (PS01D) [4216] And then after that I've got er that thing in for my
                 ... exams.
                 [4217] My proper ... diploma exams.
                 [4218] None of them, there's only two of them that are to do
                 with my diploma.
                 [4219] ... All the rest are at [...] ... fortunately.
June (PS01B)     [4220] How long will you finish this?
                 [4221] Middle of next year or end of next year?
Corrinne (PS01D) [4222] It'll be July when we take the exams.
                 [4223] That's when the course will actually finish.
Albert (PS01A)   [4224] What, this July?
June (PS01B)     [4225] No!
Corrinne (PS01D) [4226] No.
                 [4227] That's right.
                 [4228] But I don't know how long it is before I get my results
                 back.
                 [4229] But ... you can get a post ... as a medical secretary
                 in a hospital or a G P without ... having your full diploma.
                 [4230] If yous let it, cos ... to get the full diploma you've
                 got to get your two skills which is medical ... audio, and
                 medical shorthand, you've got to have them two skills ... to
                 get the diploma.
                 [4231] And you've also got four papers ... ethics and ...
                 etiquette ... you got an English one, a medical aspects one,
                 and a clerical skills one.
                 [4232] Not a clerical skills one, but, office procedures.
                 [4233] And you've got to pass all them, plus your two skills
                 ... to get the diploma.
                 [4234] But you can resit any what you fail the following year.
                 [4235] Mm. [clears throat]
Albert (PS01A)   [4236] Mm!
Corrinne (PS01D) [4237] Teresa says, the only one what presents any difficulty
                 is usually the medical aspects one.
Albert (PS01A)   [4238] Well why should that present anything different?
Corrinne (PS01D) [4239] Because it covers such a wide area.
                 [4240] It says the English paper you only need, you only need
                 seventy five percent ... for your ... erm ... it's seventy
                 five percent pass rate.
                 [4241] You've got to get above seventy five to pass.
                 [4242] Yeah, it's
Albert (PS01A)   [4243] That's quite high that, you know, seventy five percent!
Corrinne (PS01D) [4244] Well it's got to be ain't it?
                 [4245] The office procedures, she said, is simple anyway, and
                 yet, ethics and etiquette is a, she said, and your teacher
                 works you that hard and it just drills in anyway!
Albert (PS01A)   [4246] No, but, seventy five percent is a high pass rate.
June (PS01B)     [4247] Well I don't know ... who she is that sends letters out
                 to your nana, but she's bloody useless!
                 [4248] She misses more words out than she gets in!
                 [4249] And she just writes over them in, in pen!
Albert (PS01A)   [laugh]
Corrinne (PS01D) [4250] If it's her computer though, they might just ... erm,
                 thingy it and change it to suit them.
Albert (PS01A)   [4251] Well it wouldn't be on ... word processor.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4252] You don't know.
Albert (PS01A)   [4253] Cos it's,the you're supposed to ... that's what it's
                 for so you can check all your spellings.
June (PS01B)     [4254] A lot of them letters that come out are already done
                 and you just delete
Corrinne (PS01D) [4255] Gonna say that's ... they're all on word processor
                 that's what I'm saying.
                 [4256] Eh!

                 anybody'd be interested into going on to higher er education
                 after this?

Corrinne (PS01D) [4281] college yet!
Albert (PS01A)   [4282] Yeah, but you get, you don't get no grant for that.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4283] What college?
                 [4284] [...] . But if it's only a part-time so you can
                 actually work part-time that's the difference.
Albert (PS01A)   [4285] Yeah.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4286] Fantastic salary if you get qualified!
Albert (PS01A)   [4287] It's alright if you can get day release from your
June (PS01B)     [cough]
Albert (PS01A)   [4288] work ... to do it.
                 [4289] That's what you want to be after, day release.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4290] Yeah.
                 [4291] They're trying to make our course into a three day a
                 week.
                 [4292] Erm, nine till six at night.
June (PS01B)     [4293] It's a long day though.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4294] That's what I said.
                 [4295] I mean,
Albert (PS01A)   [cough]
Corrinne (PS01D) [4296] you get ... we get a mental block after three ...
                 [laughing] three o'clock us [] !
Albert (PS01A)   [4297] You do.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4298] I mean, doing shorthand for four hours a day, it's ...
                 too much!
                 [4299] It's far too much!
June (PS01B)     [4300] Well, just think, when you're working full-time you'd
                 be working nine till five.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4301] I know, but it's different when you're concentrating
June (PS01B)     [4302] Mind you
Corrinne (PS01D) [4303] on studying and when you're concentrating on working.
June (PS01B)     [4304] Billy , er Billy 's ... one of Billy 's daughter-in-
                 laws, she, she does it part-time.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4305] What, medical secretary?
June (PS01B)     [4306] Yeah.
                 [4307] She's er
Corrinne (PS01D) [4308] Good money at part-time!
June (PS01B)     [4309] I know.
                 [4310] That's what erm ... that's ... which one of them, who
                 were it telling me?
                 [4311] Er ... I don't know whether it ... were the young lad
                 that comes in, or whether it was Jes that were telling me.
Albert (PS01A)   [4312] Mhm.
June (PS01B)     [4313] I can't imagine it being Jes.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4314] I think it were Jes what were telling you [...] .
June (PS01B)     [4315] Well it might have been Jes ... cos ... I don't know
                 tha well they've got, I think they've got two children.
                 [4316] And she were doing it full-time and then she went ...
                 she had children and then she went part-time.
                 [4317] But I don't think she's working [...] .
Corrinne (PS01D) [4318] That's one advantage of being medical secretary
June (PS01B)     [4319] I think she's just had another baby or summat.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4320] cos if you get in a big organization like N H S, they
                 provide a creche.
Albert (PS01A)   [4321] Mm.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4322] And thi I mean, you don't have to pay for the creche
                 cos it comes in the, it's part of your
Albert (PS01A)   [4323] Well
Corrinne (PS01D) [4324] thingy.
Albert (PS01A)   [4325] part of your job innit?
June (PS01B)     [4326] It's like nurses at hospital innit?
                 [4327] And they've got a hospital.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4328] Mm.
                 [4329] Well that's the creche what you get into.
June (PS01B)     [4330] [...] .
Corrinne (PS01D) [4331] That's why a lot of people will go into medical
                 secretary who have children.
June (PS01B)     [4332] Has Sue ... got a job at all?
Albert (PS01A)   [whistling]
Corrinne (PS01D) [4333] I don't know.
                 [4334] She's not interested.
Albert (PS01A)   [4335] No.
                 [4336] I think she'll be married shortly.
June (PS01B)     [4337] I can see her marrying him.
Corrinne (PS01D) [...]
June (PS01B)     [4338] Yeah.
                 [4339] But he's one of them lads where she'll never have owt,
                 cos he don't do, he won't bloody work will he?
Corrinne (PS01D) [4340] Well he's doing taxis.
June (PS01B)     [4341] Yeah but

Corrinne (PS01D) [4349] And he, he's getting one parent benefit!
                 [4350] [laugh] ... He'll be getting all sorts for that young
                 girl!
June (PS01B)     [4351] As soon as he gets a house ... she will leave home.
Albert (PS01A)   [cough]
Corrinne (PS01D) [4352] Yeah.
June (PS01B)     [cough]
Corrinne (PS01D) [4353] He's not so sure of that.

June (PS01B)     [4356] No.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4357] I just don't know.
                 [4358] ... She's got two men.
Albert (PS01A)   [4359] I know, but ... always nice to know.
                 [4360] Bit of scandal now and again.

                 home!
Corrinne (PS01D) [4362] I know, there's nowt from men though is there?

                 conversation betwe
June (PS01B)     [4364] No.
Corrinne (PS01D) [4365] conducted by men?
                 [4366] They beat us easy.
June (PS01B)     [4367] That back door wants rubbing down I think don't it,
                 before you ... paint it dunnit?

                 have put a window there ... to look out of.

Corrinne (PS01D)           [5519] Not bad are they?
June (PS01B)               [5520] No.
Albert (PS01A)             [5521] No the er ... I think there as good as Vax
                           but they're not as cheap
Karen (PS01F)              [5522] There.
Albert (PS01A)             [5523] as Vax.
Karen (PS01F)              [5524] There.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5525] They are!
                           [5526] Cheaper!
Karen (PS01F)              [5527] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [5528] Are they?
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5529] Yeah.
                           [5530] That's why I've got it.
                           [5531] Could have had a Vax.
Colin (PS01E)              [5532] It's the cheaper one.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5533] Th th the cheapest one like.
Albert (PS01A)             [5534] Aha.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5535] They said it well it

Corrinne (PS01D)           [5538] as what a Vax were.
Albert (PS01A)             [5539] Yeah.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5540] You know.
Albert (PS01A)             [5541] They are because a th the in the good feature
                           about it is ... that and the Vax, that doesn't
                           bloody fall over.
                           [5542] It's drawback ... if, it's doesn't hold as
                           much ... fluid.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5543] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [laugh]
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5544] Yeah I know.
Albert (PS01A)             [5545] I re I, I, I've ... it got a monotonous
                           filling it up.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5546] Yeah, to have it filled up.
Albert (PS01A)             [5547] But you don't have to empty it every time do
                           you?
Colin (PS01E)              [5548] Yeah Kia ... what you done to your leg Kia?
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5549] I usually ... I usually fill that
Colin (PS01E)              [...]
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5550] you know that thing what you fill up ... with
                           liquid?
Albert (PS01A)             [5551] Yeah.
Colin (PS01E)              [5552] Kia!
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5553] Er the ... fill that up twice
Colin (PS01E)              [5554] You have to keep chasing that.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5555] and then empty it.
Albert (PS01A)             [5556] That's what I were doing, twice.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5557] Yeah.
                           [5558] Every two goes.
Colin (PS01E)              [5559] We did kitchen when we bought some carpet
                           cleaner didn't we?
Albert (PS01A)             [5560] I like the idea of the pipe going up the er
                           ... up the inside d'ya know what I mean?
Colin (PS01E)              [5561] Ready!

June (PS01B)               [5568] No!
Albert (PS01A)             [5569] over place.
June (PS01B)               [5570] Kia!
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5571] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [5572] Don't!
Karen (PS01F)              [crying]
June (PS01B)               [5573] Kia!
Colin (PS01E)              [5574] Get Kia!
Albert (PS01A)             [5575] Then all you've got to do is take the
June (PS01B)               [5576] I'll get Kia!
Albert (PS01A)             [5577] take the bag out.
June (PS01B)               [5578] It's gone!
                           [5579] I bet she's had it.
Albert (PS01A)             [5580] Well I've got to ... change the complete
                           unit.
                           [5581] Cos
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5582] Yeah.
Albert (PS01A)             [5583] one's a dry unit and one's a wet unit.
Colin (PS01E)              [5584] You're supposed to use bag in that when you
                           do it like, but [...] ?
Albert (PS01A)             [5585] What, paper bags?
Colin (PS01E)              [5586] Yeah!
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5587] Yeah, you know, you know when you put your
                           filter
Colin (PS01E)              [5588] When you're drying [...]
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5589] in, you're supposed to be a bag in first and
                           then your filter.
                           [5590] But when you put your filter in it won't run
                           because by time your bag's filling up ... it's
                           pushing your filter in.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5591] That's what this one's like.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5592] But then.
Colin (PS01E)              [5593] Until we get the bags.
Albert (PS01A)             [5594] What you mean?
                           [5595] It's a
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5596] Come in here.

Colin (PS01E)              [5598] When you're do it dry.
Karen (PS01F)              [scream]
Albert (PS01A)             [5599] You noisy little bugger!
Colin (PS01E)              [5600] Then put the top on.
June (PS01B)               [5601] Oh!
                           [5602] Alright. [...] .
Colin (PS01E)              [5603] Put your filter like that.
Albert (PS01A)             [cough]
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5604] You put your bag ... on that.
Albert (PS01A)             [5605] Oh!
                           [5606] I see.
                           [5607] Yeah.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5608] See what I mean?
Albert (PS01A)             [5609] Yeah.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5610] But when your filter's in ... it's
Albert (PS01A)             [5611] Er, well it's only to protect that.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5612] Well this is really to protect this, mostly.
Albert (PS01A)             [5613] No, I mean, it's prot it's to protect the
                           bag.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5614] The bag?
Albert (PS01A)             [5615] The cloth bag.
                           [5616] Not unless you keep
Colin (PS01E)              [5617] Oh yeah!
Albert (PS01A)             [5618] taking that out and keep it clean.
                           [5619] You've got to keep washing that.
                           [5620] You'll have to keep washing that to er
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5621] What this?
Albert (PS01A)             [5622] Yeah.
June (PS01B)               [5623] What about your dummy?
Albert (PS01A)             [5624] Cos the dust'll deteriorate it.
Colin (PS01E)              [5625] [...] want to bring it up?
                           [5626] And my shampoo. ... [...]
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5627] Well, they told us not to wet it.
                           [5628] That's why they told us to keep it out when
                           you were cleaning.
Albert (PS01A)             [5629] Oh aye.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5630] They told us not to wet it.
Albert (PS01A)             [5631] Yeah, that.
                           [5632] While it's
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5633] That.
Albert (PS01A)             [5634] wet.
                           [5635] Well while it's dry, it won't wet will it?
June (PS01B)               [5636] Yeah.
                           [5637] I think [...] .
Colin (PS01E)              [5638] I know we never used it.
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5639] But you put that, you put a bag in
Colin (PS01E)              [...]
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5640] now put your filter in, it just ... it lids
                           your bag but your bag splits because there's no room
                           for your bag.
June (PS01B)               [5641] There!
Albert (PS01A)             [5642] Yeah.
Colin (PS01E)              [5643] They should be dome-shaped bags shouldn't
                           they?
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5644] Yeah.
Colin (PS01E)              [5645] Then [laughing] they'd work [] !
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5646] They'd go down bottom wouldn't they?
Albert (PS01A)             [5647] They'd cost a fortune and
June (PS01B)               [5648] No!
Albert (PS01A)             [5649] all won't they?
June (PS01B)               [5650] No!
Corrinne (PS01D)           [5651] No mother!

Corrinne (PS01D)           [5657] You know, so it don't get covered in dust.

Corrinne (PS01D)           [5808] No, I'd have thought he'd have put up a
                           better show than that.
Albert (PS01A)             [5809] You know, because i it was absolute, I was
