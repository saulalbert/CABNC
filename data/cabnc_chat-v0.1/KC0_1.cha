*ENI:	Well I've got millions! •_•
*MOL:	Well I  •_•
*NOE:	Have we? •_•
*MOL:	I must ring erm  Eddy  and ask him if you get them ? •_•
        I don't know whether you can get them weather like this. •_•
*ENI:	Oh! •_•
*ANN:	Why do you say there are more Noel? •_•
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*NOE:	Well I don't know why we've got more, but we've got a lot. •_•

*ANN:	Oh! •_•
*MOL:	No erm, so I thought well •_•
*ANN:	Brilliant. •_•
*MOL:	if he thinks he's as good as that then have him. •_•
*ANN:	Trouble is, if you remove moles  you just leave an evolutionary niche for them and they're  another lot move into the field, you can never get rid of them because if you  remove your own private moles another  •_•
*ENI:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	lot come in, you see. •_•
*ENI:	Mm. •_•
*NOE:	Oh how lovely! •_•

*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	One mole is too dense for me! •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•

*MOL:	Might have   •_•
*ENI:	I just   the slightest sort of movement has readjusted it  and this would not move  at all! •_•
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ENI:	And erm  I'm shovelling food now because it's so difficult! •_•

*GRO:	 ((laugh)) 
*MOL:	well, a motor side car! •_•
*ENI:	Yes, absolutely! •_•
        I'm astonished   •_•
*MOL:	erm because my grandmother wanted to see her first grandchild before she died. •_•

*ENI:	At six weeks, •_•
*MOL:	You see I  Connie. •_•

        They do it now! •_•
*ANN:	That's right. •_•
*ENI:	It drives me  •_•
*MOL:	In a car  •_•
*ENI:	me up the wall! •_•
        Erm  the things they will do for these new little things. •_•
        I never used to feel  •_•
*ANN:	I know. •_•
*ENI:	that mine were really here until they . •_•
*NOE:	Did it have a lasting effect on you Mollie? •_•
*MOL:	Well, you can be the judge of that! •_•
*ANN:	No,got it I think, yes! •_•
*MOL:	But then   •_•
*ENI:	You don't like motorbikes and side cars do you Mollie? •_•
*NOE:	It's amazing really! •_•
*MOL:	No. •_•
        Well I used to ride a motorbike and  my father had a Triumph motorbike because he bought  I don't why he, why he bought it  and he was terrified of it cos it was very fierce! •_•
        And  my brothers used to ride it, so I used to ride it  and I rode it for miles! •_•
*NOE:	Did you? •_•
*MOL:	Then I rode it in a  in an old Burberry and I don't how I started it, I think it was kick start. •_•
*ANN:	Mm, yes. •_•
*MOL:	Oh it must have been. •_•
        And then we were at Frinton, masses of us, and we always used to go to Frinton in the summer  because one of my uncles had a house there  and we knew the people who erm  dad used to play golf and mother used to knit  on the beach, you know. •_•
*NOE:	 (        ) 
*ENI:	Oh yes. •_•
        Mm mm. •_•
*MOL:	And we used to  masses of cousins there  and erm  one  one of my  Jean, my cousin  about ten months younger than I  said, can I have a go Mollie? •_•
        And I said, yes  you see, gave her a try  and so she went  if you know Frinton you could go, in those days  •_•
*NOE:	Yes I know it. •_•
*MOL:	you could go round, well it's the same now, but in those days you could go round, past the summer theatre and down Old Road where we were staying and on to a  and do a circle you see? •_•
*NOE:	Mm. •_•
*MOL:	And we started her off and she went round  and as she went past the second time she said I can't stop! •_•
*ENI:	Oh! oh! oh! •_•
*ANN:	Oh no! •_•
*MOL:	And then she went round again and we said  well push so and so •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*ENI:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh my! •_•
        How awful! •_•
*MOL:	And nobody had told her how to stop you know. •_•
*ANN:	I can remember not being able to get off my sister's much bigger push bike, just an ordinary push bike •_•
*MOL:	Oh yes! •_•
*ANN:	and I  pedalled frantically round, didn't know how to get off again cos it was much too high. •_•
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	And I remember just sort of leaping onto some grass and just letting it go, you know, could of been . •_•
*MOL:	Oh I remember them emphatically  •_•
*ANN:	Oh yes! •_•
*MOL:	now,. •_•
*ANN:	Yes, •_•
*MOL:	I know, I probably learn you see because I borrowed   •_•

*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*MOL:	Oh, she was furious  •_•
*ENI:	Oh dear! •_•
*MOL:	with me! •_•
*ENI:	I bet she was. •_•
        I bet she was. •_•
*MOL:	cos of nowadays, well they didn't then because she was beastly to me now! •_•
*ANN:	Oh ! •_•
*ENI:	Now this is where the meal gets a little bit French because  I have sauce to deal with. •_•
        So you are left with erm conversation  •_•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*NOE:	I'm going to top your glass up with a •_•
*ENI:	No thank you darling. •_•
*NOE:	No. •_•
        I had an experience with a bike when I was very small  a girl up the road  was given a bike  and I had quite quietly learnt how to ride a bike more or less. •_•
*MOL:	Mhm. •_•
*NOE:	And I, I said can I have a ride? •_•
        And she said yes. •_•
        And I went up and down the road and  miles away then came back  and I couldn't stop because this bike was very old fashioned and you had to stop it by pedalling back  •_•
*MOL:	I know. •_•
*NOE:	pedalling backwards! •_•
*ANN:	Oh yes  •_•
*MOL:	I know. •_•
*ANN:	I've heard of them! •_•

*MOL:	Yes, I've heard of it. •_•
*NOE:	Oh yes, that's right. •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	Be quite good, although you maybe do it by accident sometime and be rather jerky! •_•
*NOE:	That's what I thought earlier. •_•
*MOL:	That's very sudden you  •_•
*ANN:	Oh! •_•
*MOL:	see. •_•

*MOL:	and erm  ooh she's marvellous! •_•
*NOE:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	She's ,, eighty six and she lives alone  and she's  she's absolutely  again, the Arch Deacon, it's the Arch Deacon there that's the trouble! •_•
        He got a bulldozer to , to bulldoze up the erm  aisles  and bulldoze the sanctuary  and he's thrown away, God knows what! •_•
        I mean there are, there, there were erm  all sorts of things there. •_•
        And his, and he got rid of the beautiful eagle  erm  you know, reading desk  and he got rid of the  Bishops's  erm, chair, the Bishop's  what do they call it? •_•
*ANN:	Oh yes. •_•
*NOE:	Throne? •_•
*MOL:	The Bishop's throne! •_•
        And he's put all wrought iron one there! •_•
*NOE:	Yeah. •_•
        Well I  •_•
*MOL:	Absolutely furious! •_•
        she won't  •_•
*NOE:	I haven't been in  •_•
*MOL:	go near it! •_•
        Do you know what she does? •_•
        On  is the erm  erm, nearly next door is the old erm  Quaker Chapel •_•
*NOE:	Oh yes. •_•
*MOL:	the most beautiful building and  nobody can pull it down, but   •_•
*ANN:	Not the chapel Mollie? •_•
*MOL:	No, •_•
*ANN:	Not . •_•
*NOE:	Meeting House. •_•
*MOL:	Meeting House  •_•
*ANN:	Meeting House  •_•
*MOL:	yes. •_•
        And opposite her  is where the erm  Quakers meet now because they can't afford to run the chapel  the erm  Meeting  •_•
*NOE:	Meeting House. •_•
*MOL:	Meeting House  as  a big one and they are  getting fewer. •_•
        But she says  I sometimes just walk across the road and go to the Meeting House at  you know  •_•
*NOE:	Well I've got a theory  •_•
*MOL:	rather than the cathedral. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*NOE:	I've got a theory  I have a feeling there's going to be a great  revival  of people with a Quakered mind  way of thinking. •_•
*ANN:	Yes  •_•
*MOL:	I I  •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	do agree. •_•
*ANN:	But the trouble is Noel, in the meantime  erm  the Quakers have fallen apart  because the Quakers have filled themselves up with  sort of barefooted raw carrot eaters with beads  •_•
*MOL:	Well I know they have, yes I agree. •_•
*ANN:	with the and haven't, but haven't ever read  •_•
*MOL:	That's right. •_•
*ANN:	the bible   •_•
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	sort of Eastern religion type, meditation and thing and it's no good at all! •_•
        The old fashioned Quakers who were sikhs and everything. •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	Now, what I have learnt at college this week which is  rather interesting I think. •_•
        Well I think you'll be interested. •_•
        Erm  in the bible  in the new part, the new testament, there's a  er an epistle of James. •_•
*NOE:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	Well  I am told that that is the earliest thing at all. •_•
*NOE:	I'd say that. •_•
*ANN:	That is his erm  actually a brother of Jesus in his family  •_•
*MOL:	Yes. •_•
*ANN:	and so it's very much as he was thinking  and it should be in the old testament really cos it was written  you know, before Jesus •_•
*NOE:	Mm. •_•
*MOL:	That's right. •_•
*NOE:	before the, before the crucifixion. •_•
        Erm, and it's been quickly Christianized with just two little lectures at the beginning of two chapters to Christianize so it was popped in for new testament  and it's the nearest we can get to  to teaching. •_•
        And of course, it's totally Jewish •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	but I'd say it's it's , the Jewish teaching as Christ would have preached it  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	you see and it's for  all the family. •_•
        And there's, towards the end of the  first chapter  there's a bit all about erm  erm  er temptation and deliver us from evil kind of thing which is obviously rather from the, from the Lord's Prayer and yet it's, rather explained rather nicely and it, it's a lovely, lovely book! •_•
        It's only five   •_•
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*NOE:	Do you know, I haven't ever read it. •_•
        I will do of course. •_•
*MOL:	I've heard about that. •_•
*ANN:	It's lovely! •_•
        It really is lovely! •_•
        And you really feel that  •_•
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	here is a  •_•
*MOL:	I shan't be able to walk home! •_•
*NOE:	Really? •_•
*ANN:	It seems to be  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	everything  sort of, in a nutshell, you don't need any of the rest  •_•
*MOL:	Oh well! •_•
*ANN:	of the new  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	testament, that's just quite enough, it's just a  just the Jewish thing filled out slightly and and and a little bit less rules and, you know,it's very, very lovely! •_•
*MOL:	Well apparently  •_•
*NOE:	I've never read it , but I shall. •_•
*ANN:	We'll have a go, yes. •_•
*MOL:	Well that's what Chelmsford's got you see, Chelmsford was was full of Quaker! •_•
        I mean, I can, I can  erm  quote the Quaker the families who still live there. •_•
*NOE:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	Oh, all the important people were Quaker families when I lived there  you see? •_•
        And the erm  the . •_•
*NOE:	The , I was gonna say them. •_•
*MOL:	Oh the  were appalling! •_•
*NOE:	Ah yeah, the  , the  and  I knew them. •_•
*MOL:	Oh yes! •_•
*NOE:	Yes. •_•
*MOL:	and erm •_•
*ANN:	What about the ? •_•
*NOE:	They're still there apparently  •_•
*ANN:	The  were •_•
*MOL:	Oh yes, they're still there! •_•
*ANN:	and the  were the Norfolk more weren't they? •_•
*MOL:	Mm mm? •_•
*ANN:	Were the  Norfolk more, were they? •_•
*MOL:	I think they were. •_•
        Yes, I I mean I can't remember  they  and the  and . •_•
*NOE:	By the time   •_•
*MOL:	I can't remember now but they're at least five. •_•
        I was thinking of them the other night, well they  er, five at least erm      they were  •_•
*NOE:	 (        ) 
*MOL:	they were Quakers. •_•
*NOE:	But er •_•
*MOL:	,,and something else, I can't remember them. •_•
*NOE:	I , I always think of the , I met one or two of those. •_•
*MOL:	They're   •_•
*NOE:	when I go through •_•
*MOL:	Oh Mrs , •_•
*NOE:	off the train and  still standing there with her name on her side. •_•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah, that's right. •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah. •_•
*MOL:	Oh they're lovely people! •_•
*NOE:	But er •_•
*MOL:	They ran everything. •_•
*NOE:	I'd been ah  I I feel that  all this  doctrine  religions are spoilt  •_•
*ANN:	That's what I said! •_•
*NOE:	by doctrine. •_•
*ANN:	Exactly! •_•
*MOL:	Oh no! •_•
*ANN:	Nobody believes  •_•
*MOL:	That's wrong! •_•
*ANN:	any of it now! •_•
        I mean I think  •_•
*MOL:	No I know. •_•
*ANN:	 (        )  (        ) 
*MOL:	I know. •_•
*ANN:	Yeah, it's terribly sad! •_•
        It's terribly sad! •_•
*MOL:	I think it's . •_•
*ANN:	Even the Bishop of Durham, I've just recently bought one of his books  and I rather wish I hadn't, I'm not liking it much  erm  he's still much too orthodox really. •_•
*NOE:	Is he? •_•
*ANN:	You know he's still hanging on to  •_•
*MOL:	Oh he is ? •_•
*ANN:	and trying to  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	show  •_•
*NOE:	Well I mean you can't  you  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*NOE:	you can't get fish  from  prize thinking fish  •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
*NOE:	can you? •_•
*MOL:	No. •_•
*ANN:	But I know they blamed him for that. •_•
        And he says you can because he says it's important for it to be a living thing that's got to change with the time. •_•
*NOE:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	In all that way he's quite correct  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	I think. •_•
        It's just that he hasn't, to me, changed enough, he's still stuck up with all these  various things. •_•
        That really •_•
*NOE:	Well I know  let's face it, if he, if he was  really convinced of the  falsity of most it he  •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*NOE:	couldn't be a conscience to obtain his seat could he? •_•
*ANN:	Well he reckons you can say it in a different way. •_•
        You can say  •_•
*NOE:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	it entirely symbolically and spiritually and and  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	things don't  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	have to have happened in fact. •_•
        And that the stories were told to make a point and  •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	the trouble is, people have lost the point and kept the story! •_•
        Erm, you know, it's saying that •_•
*NOE:	Well, the earliest man who  used to think like this was Albert . •_•
*ANN:	Yes, oh yes course it  •_•
*MOL:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	was! •_•
*NOE:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	He wrote that marvellous book! •_•
*MOL:	Oh  •_•
*NOE:	Well  •_•
*MOL:	a lovely book! •_•
*NOE:	I've got about six of his books in there! •_•
*MOL:	Well I had all of his books. •_•
*ANN:	famous  •_•
*NOE:	No, er, you mean erm  •_•
*MOL:	I know quite a few . •_•
*ANN:	The er •_•
*NOE:	Christ, the Historic Jesus. •_•
*ANN:	Yes. •_•
        With that famous last  •_•
*NOE:	That is his best book  •_•
*ANN:	chapter which is so lovely when  •_•
*NOE:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	he sort of says well you still can  spiritually meet Jesus even though you know, it's a rather lovely  •_•
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	the last chapter! •_•
        I say, he moves him the more you  search for him historically  •_•
*NOE:	Yeah. •_•
*ANN:	but there is a  there's something hanging about still. •_•
        But in a funny way, perhaps there is. •_•
        I don't know. •_•
        I'm very  very, very, very, tied up with it, I I I invariably turn  relatively happy with it all. •_•
*NOE:	I don't think one has to worry too much. •_•
*ANN:	Been brought up so much, bought up a Christian  •_•
*MOL:	Yes, •_•
*ANN:	you just find it difficult to  to admit that one's rather  you know  But certainly that epistle of James, to me, was just marvellous! •_•
        Just everything! •_•
*NOE:	I, I can't  •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*NOE:	ever remember reading James, If I had, I've forgotten about it. •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*NOE:	But I shall read him tonight. •_•
*ANN:	Well certainly, you'll enjoy it. •_•
*MOL:	Oh   •_•

*ANN:	how lovely! •_•
*NOE:	Yeah. •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*ANN:	Yep. •_•
        It  •_•
*NOE:	Erm  •_•
*ANN:	was very nicely done! •_•
        Louis was very upset cos she forgot to erm  have anyone to take the names  erm  •_•
*NOE:	Well  •_•
*ANN:	so I wrote down  •_•
*MOL:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	as many as I could  think of •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•
*ANN:	and erm  and I asked Margaret , they had a better view where she was •_•
*MOL:	Mm. •_•

*NOE:	Oh, we couldn't er  we  •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
*NOE:	we couldn't go anyhow. •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
        It was very packed in there  but I couldn't see a lot of anything. •_•
*NOE:	But I was glad we couldn't because they asked me to read the lesson. •_•
*MOL:	No it  it's miserable! •_•
*ANN:	Oh yeah. •_•
*MOL:	It spoils everything doesn't it? •_•
*NOE:	I'm glad to say  •_•
*ANN:	Mm. •_•
*NOE:	and stuck to it. •_•
*MOL:	I think there were some people there who didn't really know, but they maybe went because they'd got to a funeral. •_•
*ANN:	Well it wasn't erm •_•
*MOL:	Oh   •_•
*ANN:	it wasn't quite full enough. •_•
*MOL:	I think that's awful don't you? •_•
