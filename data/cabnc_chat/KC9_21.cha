@Comment:	conversation #21 (Tape 014204)
*GIN:	Hello, hello, hello, (        ) .
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) She had, she had so many warnings
*JAC:	And I thought oh god
*GIN:	But he looks bright.
*JAC:	He went yesterday, I was gonna come up this afternoon and tell you when Peter came home, can't leave him, he was so naughty yesterday, he licked ,
*GIN:	Atten ,
*JAC:	he licked that, although 
*GIN:	yeah ,
*JAC:	she said he mustn't lick it.
*GIN:	yes he'll have to have a collar on .
*JAC:	I only went upstairs to get sort of washed and dressed, after the weekend, you have nobody around and er, oh eh, it started bleeding.
*GIN:	But it's natural for them to lick a wound.
*JAC:	It is, but it opens it up
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	You see as it's quite nasty.
*GIN:	Cos normally they aren't stitched, they have to heal by nature
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	I suppose.
*JAC:	He erm
*GIN:	What a good boy aren't you?
*JAC:	and I thought oh what she gonna say, because he went yesterday afternoon
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	and she said, I told you he had been licking, she said oh, even with the licking, that's excellent I'm very pleased.
*GIN:	Oh really has healed nice   (        ) .
*JAC:	And she said he's not out of the woods yet, but, I'll give you a collar, if he's naughty, very crafty, (        ) and then I looked through the crack in the door and his looking  (        ) .
*GIN:	But how can he reach it with the collar on?
*JAC:	Well I
*GIN:	You've got the collar on back to front.
*JAC:	I know, because he can still reach it the other way round.
*GIN:	Oh, it should be  (        ) .
*JAC:	Yes, I did, I put it on that way
*GIN:	And he could reach?.
*JAC:	And he could, see he's got a little .
*GIN:	It's so long isn't it?.
*JAC:	Yes, this is it, you see, I don't think she thought of
*GIN:	Cos it's a  (        ) .
*JAC:	Yeah, and even if, even
*GIN:	Got long under carriage, haven't you darling.
*JAC:	 (        ) mummy he's still licking, (        ) I thought what am I gonna do?So, I put it on the other way round this morning and he hates it, I've only just done it
*GIN:	Oh they do hate it.
*JAC:	and he, he can't get round there   (        ) .
*GIN:	At least he can see , I mean Roxanna 
*JAC:	Yeah ,
*GIN:	had to have one for a short while, she was quite young and I, we'd only just moved here and I took her to the vet the used to be in Sandhurst, they said it was a bee sting, they put purple stuff on it
*JAC:	oh.
*GIN:	It didn't get any better and somebody told me about   (        ) and I took her down there, oh Mrs  she's picked up mange, I said mange, I know she said you feel just like when your child's got nits in their hair
*JAC:	Yeah
*GIN:	don't worry, it's, it's in the grass and she's just picked it up in the heat wave.So to stop it   (        ) cos she always used to clear the foxes from the top garden, but er, because she worried it, it was about there on her patch
*JAC:	Oh yes, a niggle .
*GIN:	a bald patch , yes, so she had wear, actually we had to cut down a plastic bucket cos she was a big dog
*JAC:	Oh yeah.
*GIN:	cut down a plastic bucket and fixed that, it was great she had a bucket round her, round her
*JAC:	Oh she'd only do that when 
*GIN:	 (        ) thing .
*JAC:	I sort of popping upstairs, when I'm here, I'll take it off him, but just now he, he was walking along like 
*GIN:	Let him get used to it.
*JAC:	as though he could walk, but when you came to the door, here  (        ) .
*GIN:	Yeah, yeah, he'd forgot all about it, didn't he, he was putting it on you see.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) , yeah, yeah, this is it.
*GIN:	They don't half get you at it, don't they?
*JAC:	They do, they, they could wear you out.But he's eating well going to the loo alright.
*GIN:	Good, I, I thought of you following him around watching what he was going to do.
*JAC:	Oh my dear I was, it, you sort of feel exhausted with the worry of it don't you?
*GIN:	Yes and the
*JAC:	And the strain.
*GIN:	Of course you must of emptied his lower bowel, when she did the operation
*JAC:	Yes.
*GIN:	so there would of been nothing there for him to go for, you must of been ever so worried following him around watching him .
*JAC:	I was , because I, I felt oh, if it all comes to pieces it's all gonna bleed
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	but he was alright and he didn't strain cos he couldn't go
*GIN:	Mm.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Was there any way he
*JAC:	And he's eating it alright.
*GIN:	Oh good.
*JAC:	I, I just put it on his dinner, cos there's no way that I squirt it in his mouth, I'd probably choke him.
*GIN:	Yeah, yeah.
*JAC:	I just put it on his dinner and he, he's licking all his bowls clean
*GIN:	Oh good.
*JAC:	so, that it's working.
*GIN:	So he's not off his food, that's a good sign.
*JAC:	No.
*GIN:	He's certainly alert, that's why I didn't want to ring the bell ,
*JAC:	Yeah ,
*GIN:	so that he wouldn't upset himself by barking, that's why I tapped on the window when I saw you.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) .There Herbie.
*GIN:	What a good boy.
*JAC:	Yeah, you're still not having   (        ) he says ,
*GIN:	What a good boy ,
*JAC:	but he's quite bright eyed .
*GIN:	he's aged , he's aged round he's eyes.
*JAC:	Yeah, ten and a half years old.Your  (        ) .
*GIN:	It doesn't seem that long since you had him as a puppy 
*JAC:	I know .
*GIN:	use to keep
*JAC:	This is the thing.
*GIN:	keep Lancer company.
*JAC:	Yeah, you did you perked Lancer up a treat didn't you?
*GIN:	Is there any way she can tell what's going on inside, where she did all the reconstruction.
*JAC:	I suppose is the only way if, if he started bleeding or if he felt loose, cos she said he's still swollen from the operation
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	obviously, but he's, he's gone down, I, I can see he's gone down a little bit
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	I mean before he was all loose and baggy
*GIN:	That's right, he was.
*JAC:	Were erm, where he had   (        ) .
*GIN:	And then of course he hasn't, he hasn't got testicles any more.
*JAC:	No.
*GIN:	But she's, so it's difficult to judge isn't it?
*JAC:	Yes, yes.
*GIN:	Cos you don't know how much she took away when she took the testicles out.
*JAC:	No, he I mean he, he still got the little 
*GIN:	They're partly inside, they're partly outside 
*JAC:	a little bag, but there's nothing in them  ((laugh)) .
*GIN:	Yes, yes.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	She did a marvellous job.
*JAC:	Yes, a   (        ) nurse came round and she said hello Herby, she said oh you look quite bright, and I said did he play you up she said well he was very torn and I thought yeah I'm sure he was .
*GIN:	Oh poor little soul , of course he was.
*JAC:	 (        ) in all night.
*GIN:	Is he getting treats, is that why's he's looking
*JAC:	No, I, I only give him his food .
*GIN:	So that he get's a treat .Are you not getting any treats?
*JAC:	And he's bowl of water.
*GIN:	I nearly brought you down and treat, and I thought I'd better not until I've asked your mum.
*JAC:	Yeah, he has had a bonio, he likes a bonio, he did eat one last night,
*GIN:	Well that's only
*JAC:	he usually has a bonio after he's dinner 
*GIN:	a food supplement isn't it?.
*JAC:	this is it, but that's his sort of   (        ) 
*GIN:	Rocket has a chew usually .
*JAC:	Oh yeah, got those.
*GIN:	You know one of those hoof and horn chews
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	Which there's nothing in them, there's noth , not fattening or anything.
*JAC:	That's right.
*GIN:	I mean I never have given my dogs chocolates or anything like that, a lot of people do .
*JAC:	You now, he, he's had   (        ) , I'm just keeping him on the straight and narrow while he's on remission .
*GIN:	Yes, oh yes .
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Yes, got to keep your insides in motion we have darling.
*JAC:	 (        ) , she said he must not strain, and I've been petrified 
*GIN:	I remember she was, she was ever so adamant about that.
*JAC:	 ((yawn)) she said straining is going to push the stitches
*GIN:	Yes
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	but as soon as he start, get ready, go, and I go up to Lisa's and  (        ) .
*GIN:	And he tells you when he wants to go, or is it regular times of the day?.
*JAC:	Well he looks all peculiar .
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) , I suppose like this morning after his breakfast, and he went and he, he, it was quite big
*GIN:	Good.
*JAC:	So erm, I was pleased.
*GIN:	Good, so it's forming into a proper form.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	Proper shape.
*JAC:	Oh yes.
*GIN:	But it's sliding with the, the liquid paraffin.
*JAC:	It comes out quite good.
*GIN:	Good, good, if it's forming properly that's a good sign isn't it of health, always.
*JAC:	Yeah, cos, when he had he's hernia he, he's it used to come out flat.
*GIN:	Yes.
*JAC:	There's nothing there ,
*GIN:	Depressed ,
*JAC:	you see, it's gone like that.
*GIN:	yes.
*JAC:	So erm, (        ) round his bottom and it's all round know, and I keep looking for signs of bleeding and all this .
*GIN:	Oh that's good, that means , that means their anal passage and his rectum were in the right shape again.
*JAC:	That's right.
*GIN:	Oh I'm so glad.Oh I hope so, but   (        ) still not out of the woods yet  (.) 
*JAC:	Erm, well no I suppose he won't be until he's erm, had stitches out, she said it would be two weeks
*GIN:	Mm.
*JAC:	before we, you know, could really stop worrying.
*GIN:	Mm, mm.
*JAC:	But, she said I'm pleased with him so far, but we still got to be careful that's why she made him have this collar.
*GIN:	Well remember I'm usually around, if I'm not there 
*JAC:	Thank you Ginny ,
*GIN:	the first time you ring, I'm usually only out long enough to walk the dog and do some shopping
*JAC:	right.
*GIN:	so don't hesitate to call if you get worried about him or
*JAC:	Alright, yeah, thanks very much.
*GIN:	You know if he starts throwing up or well you, you think he seems he looks as if he's in pain or something.
*JAC:	Yeah, but she said he's alright and erm   (.) I said he's he was jumping on the chair, should he ought to?
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*JAC:	He's, he's, he's jump, he, he, he goes up like a jump jet he goes 
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	like that, and she said oh, she said well I'm rather pleased to think that he feels likes doing it.
*GIN:	Of course.
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) .
*GIN:	well that's the only way he can see out the window  (        ) 
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	he likes to watch doesn't he?
*JAC:	Yeah.
*GIN:	I often see him watching as I go by.
*JAC:	That's right, he usually sits up there, and I'm, not going to leave him on his own till I know he's alright.But erm, she said don't worry too much about jumping, she said I'm quite pleased you know he can do that
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	she said it's just straight  (        ) .
*GIN:	So she gave him more liquid paraffin did she?
*JAC:	No I've still got the   (        ) bottle 
*GIN:	Yes, it's easy enough to get it   (        ) get the empty bottle and
*JAC:	Yeah, I've got some up there any way, I'm sure that 'll be alright to use.
*GIN:	I suppose
*JAC:	So
*GIN:	I suppose it's the same strength where ever you buy it.
*JAC:	Well I can check on the bottle.
*GIN:	Yeah.
*JAC:	 (        ) .Any way I'm going Thursday, if I need any more she'll give me some then.

*GIN:	Well the stitches are pulling where they're, where they're trying to heal of course, they're pulling.
*JAC:	Yeah, and with he's licking he's make it all soft and
*GIN:	That's why he's licking cos it must itch like made.
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) .
*JAC:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	What a good boy, I would of thought she'd have put something on it, put some ointment on to stop it itching .
*JAC:	And the other side is quite dry , yeah, that is the side he keeps on   (        ) but that's quite erm dry.
*GIN:	I use Savlon ointment on any, any of mine.

*JAC:	Oh yes.
*GIN:	warm water, and then put Savlon cream on it, vet said you couldn't have done any better, cos he gave him an antidote, before I new what it was I would have given him funny itching rash that was making the poor soul
