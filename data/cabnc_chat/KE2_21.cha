*MAR:	Now we'll go down and try and get a card will we?
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	And what else was it? (.) 
*TER:	I've got to go to Muriel
*MAR:	Oh that's right   (.) plenty of time to get out
*TER:	Well he's so badly parked you see, he's got to wait for both traffics to go whereas I could go easily
*MAR:	Yeah   (.) Now where shall we look for a ruby wedding card?You would generally go for that one in the market wouldn't you?
*TER:	Well no I don't know that I would, I would probably go to erm the one, you know, by the egg basket
*MAR:	Mm, funnily enough I don't like it in there   (.) well I suppose I might get something in
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	they have some quite nice ones as well don't they?

*MAR:	well it's the only way the
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	well somebody else is coming, join onto us, but er   (.) learner as well, why most of them seem to be learners don't they?
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	You hardly ever see a motor cyclist   (.) these days   (.) you know unless he's got an L plate up   (.) of course you can't get passed because of the erm
*TER:	Mind you the van's a long way behind him anyway
*MAR:	Now he is, isn't it? (.) Now what are we going to do erm?
*TER:	Well I think what I'll do, if I go round by the market I can drop you there by the multi-storey car park and you can then just walk through to Baston's can't you?
*MAR:	Yeah
*TER:	And I'll go down to the church and park by the church, how about that?And then you can walk back down is that alright?
*MAR:	Oh that way, yes
*TER:	That's an ambulance would you believe
*MAR:	Ooh   (.) help
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	anyway, one less, there's a car sort of in front of the ambulance kind of thing 
*TER:	Yes I think that must of come out in the roundabout there, it wasn't in front before, erm, so I'll do that yes, I'll drop you off
*MAR:	Yeah and I
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	and you can just walk through to Baston's, whatever and I'll go to Muriel
*MAR:	Baston's or erm
*TER:	Oh whatever you want
*MAR:	go up to the shops by the egg basket if need be
*TER:	So I'll see you back at the church   (.) I mean if I can just park down by Devon Square I will, but otherwise I'll park
*MAR:	Yeah, right
*TER:	behind the church  (.) 
*MAR:	Perhaps the ambulance has got somebody really ill in there or something  (.) 
*TER:	I wouldn't of thought so, I would of thought it was more or less the van than anything else  (.) 
*MAR:	It's a ruby wedding it is, isn't it?
*TER:	Mm, mm  (.)
