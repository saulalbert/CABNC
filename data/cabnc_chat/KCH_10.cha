@Comment:	conversation #10 (Tape 076303)
*PHI:	Right.Now you said you were gonna tell me what's happened on the news so far.
*DAV:	Three people have er been killed in a railway accident after their   (.) their car   (.) ran into the side of a train.
*PHI:	Oh dear!
*DAV:	Wh which is about er   (.) which   (.) is about er   (.) open   (.) er   (.) the day after tomorrow.
*PHI:	What's open   (.) the day after tomorrow?
*DAV:	The level crossing.
*PHI:	Oh it's closed now is it?
*DAV:	No, they're going to open it.It's new.
*PHI:	Aha. (.) What else has been happening?
*DAV:	And dad?
*PHI:	Yes.
*DAV:	You know that many level crossings are one barrier?
*PHI:	Yes.
*DAV:	Well that   (.) they showed us er   (.) a thing about   (.) the speed about   (.) about the traffic approaching lights when they're   (.) starting flashing.It showed you a car go over that, going over,tha a lorry going over crossing and the lights were starting to flash.
*PHI:	Well a lot of people do that.It's very dangerous.
*DAV:	But I was supposed to stop.
*PHI:	They ha as soon as the lights flash supposed to stop.Be 
*DAV:	What the running of the railway line?
*PHI:	No, they're supposed to stop before the lights.Silly!
*DAV:	Yeah.
*PHI:	Because, on a lot of those the train
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
*DAV:	Yes cos most,o most of that one barrier, it said on the news that they're o automatic.
*PHI:	That's right.So 
*DAV:	They have er special cameras which   (.) they take the line of the trains both sides.
*PHI:	Mhm.And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers   (.) the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you.So it's a very silly thing to do.
*DAV:	Yes.Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going across.
*PHI:	Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across.But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come 
*DAV:	If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway   (.) er th  (.) ah   (.) there's only way you can escape.Go round by the barrier pole.
*PHI:	Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield.
*DAV:	Yes.The barriers 
*PHI:	Er 
*DAV:	 (        ) .
*PHI:	they've got full barriers you see.
*DAV:	Full barriers.Double are safe.
*PHI:	Well, they're different because they have them   (.) they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're 
*DAV:	Yes they are controlled.
*PHI:	controlled by a television.Er 
*DAV:	If they're controlled   (.) well dad, everyone knows that one th the Tackleby's controlled by a man.
*PHI:	Oh yes.That was good wasn't it?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box didn't you?
*DAV:	Oh yes.But   (.) though it was rather dangerous.After all in my, you know my er   (.) people working on the rails book?The one 
*PHI:	Yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) .It says, you must never try to steer ru steer round a bu barrier poles.
*PHI:	That's right.
*DAV:	And they're trying to take away as many er   (.) possible erm, mainly one barrier er   (.) railway gates as possible.
*PHI:	Well I didn't know they were trying to get rid of those.
*DAV:	Especially on busy main roads.
*PHI:	But some of the crossings around this area didn't have any barriers at all 
*DAV:	Ah ah.
*PHI:	and   (.) they just had the flashing lights.
*DAV:	Well it's like wo ones at Meading Ro Meadow Road.
*PHI:	That's right.
*DAV:	They're only wooden ones.
*PHI:	Ah well tha no Meadow Road's got the old gates but   (.) at Natherton there were some that didn't have any   (.) barriers at all, they were just flashing lights.Now, do you remember   (.) now let's think whether you were born.When the Lockington railway disaster happened   (.) that was just a few miles from here.
*DAV:	At Manchester?
*PHI:	No, Lockington.
*DAV:	Ah.
*PHI:	And that was where er, a train came off the railways when it hit a van   (.) on 
*DAV:	Oh.
*PHI:	on the crossing er and killed a lot of people.
*DAV:	Oh.I, I, I know, I'd, I have never heard   (.) never heard.
*PHI:	Oh!That's sa surprise cos I was on the way to Hull   (.) oh yes!You were around because I was going to take you and Chrissy to Hull to a train fair
*DAV:	Ah yes!And mum and Chrissy slept in the car.
*PHI:	and and th that's ri they were, they, mum was gonna stay at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train
*DAV:	Yeah.
*PHI:	and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car.And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash.
*DAV:	Yes.Thank goodness we didn't.
*PHI:	Well it was one of those things wasn't it?
*DAV:	Well it's a good job mum came.
*PHI:	Mm mm.
*DAV:	I hope, I hope  (        ) .
*PHI:	Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we weren't sure what it was.It happened just after we went past the, just before.You could see   (.) er   (.) a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards 
*DAV:	I 
*PHI:	the crossing.
*DAV:	And th th and they would be police ones if they'd got blue lights and 
*PHI:	Mm mm.
*DAV:	so did you, could you hear the sirens?
*PHI:	No I couldn't.But erm   (.) when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened   (.) and we went to the toy fair and then we came back   (.) and there was er   (.) you could see all the ambulances and everything still there.And the train was there leaning over.
*DAV:	But half of it was still on the rails.
*PHI:	Yes it was the front coaches went off.
*DAV:	Front coaches?
*PHI:	Onto the side I think.
*DAV:	Well what sort of express?
*PHI:	It was erm   (.) well what do you think it would be?
*DAV:	Er   (.) I think it must have been a multiple unit.
*PHI:	That's right.It was a diesel multiple unit.And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
*DAV:	Yes.Thank goodness for that!I wouldn't want one of those, one of the pacers or sprinters or metros spoilt.
*PHI:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	But dad!They're all multiple units   (.) at sometimes.
*PHI:	Yes, of course they are, but we, I was talking about the old sort of diesel multiple unit.
*DAV:	Yes.One with the yellow front.You can get all different sorts of, one with two red lights erm   (.) one with two windows    (.)  (        ) 
*PHI:	Can you?
*DAV:	Yes.
*PHI:	Mm.I'm pleased you know your trains.
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	Yeah.Right.Well I'm gonna have to start thinking about getting ready.What about you getting ready for bed now?
*DAV:	Dad.
*PHI:	Mhm?
*DAV:	What about the Manchester   (.) crossing disaster?
*PHI:	Which one was that?
*DAV:	Er, just outside Manchester.
*PHI:	Mm mm.Can't remember that one.
*DAV:	The one about those two boys playing on the track.
*PHI:	Oh!Is that one they've told you about at school?
*DAV:	No.No.I got it from the telly.
*PHI:	Oh!Did you now?
*DAV:	No.You, you told me about it when you came home once.You told me about that disaster.
*PHI:	Well, your memory's better than mine.I can't remember it now.
*DAV:	The only tha disaster I know very well is the Tay one   (.) the Tay   (.) Tay Bridge.
*PHI:	The Tay Bridge.
*DAV:	Yes.And half of it still is standing.
*PHI:	What else do you know?
*DAV:	Er er   (.) tt oh   (.) what about?
*PHI:	The Tay Bridge.
*DAV:	Er er   (.) well the engine which should have pulled, the post train, broke down   (.) so that went to the works   (.) and the engine which took its replacement
*PHI:	Mhm.
*DAV:	was one which   (.) they   (.) which fell down with a crash.
*PHI:	Oh!Mm mm.
*DAV:	Dad!You should know all this, you told me.
*PHI:	Well you've got your book on it haven't you?Somewhere.
*DAV:	Of course!But I can't read it.
*PHI:	 ((laugh))  (.) Right.Anyway, come on let's 
*DAV:	But dad, I don't understand.
*PHI:	Well what don't you understand?
*DAV:	About all this at Tay Bridge.About other things in my book.
*PHI:	Mm mm.Anyway, come on, let's go get ready.
*DAV:	They really should give   (.) give you a magazine article itself about the Tay Bridge.
*PHI:	Well you've got a magazine that's got a lot of it in.
*DAV:	But not very much.
*PHI:	No.
