*CAR:	No the only parent   (.) I knew  (.) 
*SUS:	Georgie .
*CAR:	Yes and erm

*CAR:	I think  's dad   (.) Paul, Timmy  's dad was the chairman of governors.
*SUS:	Oh and he thought they were good did he? (.) Oh and that, that little boy who was at   (        ) school, Nicholas, he went there didn't he?
*CAR:	He's still there I think.
*SUS:	Is he?Oh well she's obviously decided she likes it.Either that or   [laughing] she's run out of schools to send him to  [] .
*CAR:	Yeah.
*SUS:	 ((laugh)) Probably a bit nearer the mark. (.) I think that's one of the drawbacks though to a village school.Er it can be very nice, very cosy, but I  (.) 
*CAR:	See that also epitomizes what I was saying before, you know I mean if I'm there you could be stuck there for the remainder.
*SUS:	 (        ) teaching.
*CAR:	Oh yeah.And there's always the danger of it   (.) could it be changed, and then   (.) you've got the whole curriculum area to look after.Instead of having three to look after I'd probably end up having to look after a seven or eight.
*SUS:	Yeah. (.) But you see I, I don't know   (.) I can see what you mean, but I don't know whether a move would be the answer cos I think you're   (.) if you're gonna stay in teaching this is what's gonna happen.
*CAR:	I mean it's, there must be a time when it settles.
*SUS:	 (        ) wherever you go   (.) wherever you go there's gonna be all this upheaval and   (.) I mean let's face it if the Tories don't get in this time, and pray god they don't, Labour's gonna completely  (.) 
*CAR:	Yeah   (        ) 
*SUS:	alter everything   [laughing] that's gone before  [] .They'll keep very little in.
*CAR:	Yeah I know.And that doesn't fill me with any great er  (.) 
*SUS:	But I, I mean which er you, you look and you think well 
*CAR:	Well 
*SUS:	which is the wor er it's gonna be bad whi whoever's in charge really. (.) 
*CAR:	 (        ) the Scottish Nationals. ((laugh)) 
*SUS:	At least from the point of   (.) with Labour at least they   (.) most of them   (.) send their kids through the state system so they've got a little more idea of what they're talking about. (.) But that still boils down to the fact that everybody thinks they know how schools work   (.) cos they've been at school themselves. (.) I get really fed up with the whole  (        ) 
*CAR:	Mm
*SUS:	Seem like all we ever do is talk about schooling other people's children. (.) 
*CAR:	Well   (.) it's never too far from the back of your mind though is it really?
*SUS:	No. (.) It's funny I mean I find I'll say something, I'll think oh so and so would like that and I'm   (        ) about other people's kids, [laughing] why they're   (        )  [] .
