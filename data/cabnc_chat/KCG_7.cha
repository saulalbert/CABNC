*MAD:	and she's had this bloke round and I think he's  •_•
*MAR:	and they've taught her  •_•
*MAD:	he's recommended to her that instead of making the third bedroom bigger, to make four bedrooms because it would increase the value of the house more. •_•
*CHR:	The house  •_•

*MAD:	Well it, when he, she originally wanted him to do plans to make the third bedroom bigger which would of been like an L shaped bedroom •_•
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*MAD:	but he recommended to her to actually make it into a fourth bedroom because it would increase the value of the house  •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*MAD:	and also •_•
*CHR:	So where they gonna put the, the other bedroom? •_•
*MAR:	At the side. •_•
*MAD:	At the side, so, but she's not having a garage or anything at the side, she's having a side extension down below, but the front bit she's having made into a shower room and then the back bit it's gonna be like a morning room to the kitchen •_•
*CHR:	Oh right. •_•
*MAD:	like where you go in the kitchen you turn right, like that one of mine over there, the sink's there on the right hand side •_•

*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAD:	with her being in a corner Jane •_•
*JAN:	I know. •_•
*MAD:	she's not, I mean the next door round the corner, like she's on the corner and the house here, it's been extended on the side, but it won't bring it anywhere near Pam's extension •_•

*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAD:	no wait a minute  •_•
*JAN:	of course he got all upset so she had to then mess about and try and get him to sleep, which apparently she did •_•
*MAD:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	but he must of been all worked up and since then I've had a right struggle, most nights •_•
*MAD:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	I've had to go back up in to him, yeah, but I don't know what happened last night, I don't know whether he was not quite tired enough, erm, he must of got up as soon as I put him down and started sort of moaning then I went into the girls and I sorted them out he started screaming he did, so I had to go to him in and lay him down and making him lay down  •_•
*MAD:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	and he was starting sobbing and he got that upset, in the end •_•
*MAD:	He started screaming. •_•
*JAN:	you know real, I've never heard him do that before. •_•
*MAR:	Aye, they can do that sobbing. •_•
*MAD:	No. •_•

*MAD:	No. •_•
*JAN:	so er •_•
*MAD:	Ee, ee. •_•
*JAN:	eventually I went up and I tried to get him to go down to sleep again, and he was shutting his eyes and on his dummy, but he was  •_•

*MAD:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	He knows he's doing this thing. •_•

*JAN:	Oh yeah, yeah. •_•

*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	eh Jane do you know what? •_•
        Mike rang the solicitor up yesterday and he said that he was sending out the contracts to us •_•
*JAN:	Yes. •_•
*CHR:	that he just received them like, about half an hour before Mike rang up, so he said I've got to get me secretary to type them out and then we, I'll send them to you and we've got to sign 'em, then what happens from there? •_•
*JAN:	Once you've signed the contracts? •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	You've got to have a witness, haven't you, sign it in front of somebody? •_•
        Is that the one, no? •_•
*CHR:	I don't think •_•
*JAN:	Send it back and it should be pretty soon after that isn't it? •_•
*CHR:	Well he said Mike must have said, what has been holding it up if I, we were under the impression that when she left London, she was finished with her property  •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	cos it was put in the hands of Black Horse by Miss  •_•
*JAN:	That's right. •_•
*CHR:	and they were dealing with it •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	well seemingly it must be as simple as that •_•
*JAN:	No. •_•
*CHR:	so she's been dealing with her Manchester solicitors and a London solicitor  •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	so this is what's been holding everything up. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	So Mike must, said to him well, the thing is well we wanted to really get in before Easter •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	so he said you don't have to move on a Friday cos Mike said well do we have to move Friday? •_•
        So he said oh no you can choose any day of the week. •_•
*JAN:	That's right, yeah. •_•
*CHR:	I suppose it's mutual agreement? •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	I mean we'll move any day, but it's whether Miss  will you see •_•
*JAN:	Yeah, the only reason most people choose a Friday is because they get you over the weekend  •_•
*CHR:	They get you over the weekend yeah, so erm, we'll just have to see what happens and have, just have the contracts out. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah, it should be a week then, shouldn't it? •_•
*CHR:	Hopefully, er what did you say five working days? •_•
*JAN:	It's normally five working days, yeah. •_•
*CHR:	Mm, mm, you see, cos even if we sort of made it for like the middle of next week, er, no not next week, the week after •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	would bring us like the Wednesday, that would be my birthday actually the Wednesday •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	but it'll make it Easter weekend •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	we'll, we wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind doing that •_•
*JAN:	No. •_•
*CHR:	because it'd give Mike an extra few days anyway, could actually have  •_•
*JAN:	Get settled. •_•
*CHR:	the Wednesday off  and all the following week •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	which would give him a good break really to get a few things done. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*MAD:	Well it'll all be •_•
*CHR:	I'm not doing any, I'm, I'm, all this bloody panicking about getting a flaming gas fire sorted out and getting a carpet done, I'm not, not bothering, we'll just have to rough it for a while. •_•
*JAN:	Let 'em rough it for a week. •_•
*CHR:	Mm, we'll rough it for a while, because I know the downers, the only thing that Mike wants to do is put the fence and the gate up the side •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	which Don said we could do •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	to sort the dog out really •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	but everything else we can sort, getting there, it's not as if we're gonna need a bloody fire is it Jane? •_•
*JAN:	Not really. •_•
*CHR:	I mean do you find you, you use your fire more? •_•
*JAN:	We have been doing over the past few nights •_•
*CHR:	Have ya? •_•
*JAN:	because I've been turning the heating, it's the  •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	I don't know, from tea time it seems to warm up the house  •_•
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	and it's boiling hot  •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	from sort of eight o'clock so I could  •_•
*CHR:	Then it cools off  •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	don't it? •_•
*JAN:	So I just put it on just to tick  •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	the room over really  but I mean if you can keep your heating on for that little bit of length of time  •_•
*CHR:	Mm, that's what I'll do I don't think we'll use the fire that much, I mean we, I, did I put it on? •_•
        No I didn't put it on last night, but I did leave me heating on, it clicks off at nine o'clock, but the house was warm •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	and we went to bed anyway •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	just gone ten. •_•
*JAN:	That's what, I mean we used to turn ours off of about nine, half nine and like you say it just used to tick  •_•
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*JAN:	over till about eleven, you could just feel it cooling down •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	but, because I've been knocking it off that bit earlier •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	sort of five minutes  •_•
*CHR:	And how have you I think we're gonna end up like with a fire like yours to be honest, because we don't want to alter that fireplace if we can help it  •_•
*JAN:	No, it's ever so nice. •_•
*CHR:	because we do like it •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	and we thought well one night, I mean it's a bloody big radiator in that room •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	which I think would be enough  •_•
*JAN:	You wouldn't you'd probably find that you would use it half a dozen times through the year. •_•
*CHR:	Yeah, yeah. •_•
*JAN:	No I won't get rid of mine. •_•
*CHR:	Have you sort of not, I suppose you haven't found out money- wise what it's costing ya? •_•
*JAN:	No, not really I should imagine it's not, I don't know you see, we don't, we'd of had the heating on anyway •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	so I don't suppose it's cost us any more •_•
*CHR:	No. •_•
*JAN:	because we've hardly had it on. •_•
*CHR:	Mm. •_•
*MAD:	Still you  •_•
*CHR:	You do find it warm don't ya? •_•
*JAN:	I do, yeah, •_•
*CHR:	Have you got a couple of settings on yours is it a high and a low? •_•
*JAN:	Well I've just got high and low that's all. •_•
*CHR:	But I mean it'll give you er a wattage er, whatever it is •_•
*JAN:	Yeah  •_•
*CHR:	it pumps out anyway? •_•
*JAN:	well I suppose so, I don't know what we've got. •_•
*MAD:	The •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	yeah, because as I say something like what Jane's got would fit in that fireplace, just right •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*MAD:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	which like I say saw one up at erm  I told you that fireplace shop on the corner, mind you I think we'll get Edwards in, he had some in about a hundred and sixty quid or so •_•
*JAN:	You should start looking round. •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	erm I mean really ideally Mike would like one of those that actually fits perfectly  •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	in, in the fireplace •_•
*JAN:	I know what you mean. •_•
*CHR:	and it's got a back to it •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	and it sort of throws the heat out into the room. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah, yeah. •_•
*CHR:	Well I could, it could, it wouldn't justify it. •_•
*JAN:	But Chris I can't see them I can't see them making a fire like that that your heat's gonna go all up the chimney, no way. •_•
*CHR:	No, but what I'm saying is  •_•
*JAN:	Josh come on  •_•
*CHR:	if there wasn't •_•
*JAN:	come on Josh, Josh  •_•
*CHR:	if there wasn't a good amount of radiator in that room •_•
*JAN:	Josh •_•
*CHR:	it would justify having a fire like that  •_•
*MAD:	Come on  •_•
*JAN:	Yeah, yeah. •_•
*CHR:	but because it's got such a good •_•
*MAD:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	Radiator. •_•
*CHR:	you know cos I told you Mike actually fancies one of these that actually fits right in the fireplace  •_•
*JAN:	I know what you mean next door  •_•
*CHR:	and there's a backing to it and it pumps it out into the room, they're dead hot •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	but I don't think this room needs it Jane. •_•
*MAD:	No. •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	I think it'll be a waste, and I don't want to go to the expense of •_•
*JAN:	Well they are bloody expensive. •_•
*CHR:	because  •_•
*MAD:	It slipped  •_•
*CHR:	I think the fires are about three hundred quid •_•
*JAN:	Mm. •_•
*CHR:	but it's not that, you'd have to have a lot of the fireplace ripped up. •_•
*JAN:	Mm you would  •_•
*CHR:	Yeah. •_•
*JAN:	it's only a little square. •_•
*CHR:	Yeah, we'd have to have the pillars taken off •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	and everything like that, so all that would have to be redecorated. •_•
*JAN:	Whereas like that one of ours, it'd be ideal wouldn't it? •_•
*CHR:	It be it just work right •_•
*JAN:	Must have your chimney swept. •_•
*CHR:	That's what I want to get that number off you for that as well because I some  would suggest anyway  •_•
*JAN:	I got it somewhere yeah. •_•
*CHR:	wouldn't he? •_•
*JAN:	I got it somewhere, I'll root it out for ya and I forgot to see Hilda about that •_•
*MAD:	Michael shout Mike  •_•
*CHR:	There's no rush for it. •_•
*MAD:	Michael shout louder  •_•

*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	and she started talking about putting the freezer in the back garden  •_•
*BIL:	Is it worth my taking a coat on? •_•
*JAN:	and that •_•
*CHR:	Oh. •_•

*JAN:	Be careful  •_•
*CHR:	sort it all out. •_•
*JAN:	sort it out  •_•
*MAD:	shout Chris •_•
*CHR:	Hopefully we can get away with that room Jane with just maybe having to emulsion it •_•
*JAN:	Yeah. •_•
*CHR:	because I mean once you've taken all the pictures down, I think it did need it •_•
*JAN:	She's a smoker int she? •_•
        That's  •_•
*CHR:	very much. •_•
*JAN:	Yeah that'll be your main thing then. •_•
*CHR:	Rather than decorate I think we'll just  •_•
*JAN:	Paint it. •_•
*CHR:	er emulsion over it and maybe put a border around the picture frames. •_•
*JAN:	This is in the back room? •_•
*CHR:	Front room. •_•
