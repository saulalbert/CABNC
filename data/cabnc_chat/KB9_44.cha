*PAT:	Not worth  getting out of bed! 
*TRA:	 you know, just ask  them if there's any more money in it if she works the long hours.

*PAT:	Yeah. 
*TRA:	and he ha  he hasn't been trained up fully yet so he, you know   (.) but plus, the course he's on at er college  isn't doing him any good. 
*PAT:	 That's what happened to our drill  you see, you've had apprentice on it! 
*TRA:	You're right. 
*ANN:	  ((laugh))

*ANN:	 Shall I do it now? 
*TER:	Yeah. 
*TRA:	would get, if they got their  act together   
*TER:	 And see what's  happening.

*TER:	 Cos you want to get cracking don't you? 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*TRA:	The  they lose a lot of customers   (.) er   (.) to, to other people that   (.) sometimes charge them more. And we get pissed off with  Cumbria
