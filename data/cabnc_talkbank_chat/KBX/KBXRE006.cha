*KBXPS00:	Erm Matthew chapter eight verses twelve .  274000_277310
*PS1DW:	Let's have a look what 's er surrounding er verses say .  279620_281930
*KBXPS00:	Mm it 's after the army officer the army officer is asking him to treat his manservants for some .  281930_287250
*KBXPSUN:	0 .

*PS1DW:	Oh I can see you 're getting me baffled this morning .  300480_302100
*KBXPS00:	Mhm it must be talking erm some other kingdom that 's all I can suggest maybe .  302120_310900
*PS1DW:	Erm it says here whereas I 'll read from eleven shall I .  310960_316180
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  317010_317200
*PS1DW:	Many from eastern parts and western parts will come and decline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens and erm as regards to these ones Abraham Isaac and Jacob erm at the kingdom of the heavens while these ones were born before Jesus were n't they .  317200_339640
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  339640_339730
*PS1DW:	So we know from previous studies that these ones when they die have n't gone to heaven .  340840_346070
*KBXPS00:	Not initially no .  346070_347460

*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*KBXPS00:	Mhm .  357840_357970
*PS1DW:	so bearing that in mind let's see what it says at verse twelve whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness well there will be some of the sons of the kingdom thrown into the darkness outside because this this proved futile they they have n't er lived in faith have they Some of them gone away from the kitchen .  357970_380540
*KBXPS00:	Mhm .  380620_380720
*PS1DW:	er refrained outside where there is where they 're weeping and .  380720_387140
*KBXPS00:	Er another scripture here to suggest whether this this is on the same sort of er apart from that 's it chapter thirteen and Luke .  387140_397360
*PS1DW:	Hold on just a sec .  397360_399400
*KBXPS00:	chapter thirteen have you got the volume too high there .  399400_407860
*PS1DW:	I think perhaps I have have n't I .  407860_409800
*KBXPS00:	Mm you 've got the volume too high yeah you wo n't get you 'll get your feedback that means you 've got the volume too high where 's the volume .  409810_415320
*PS1DW:	Yeah it 's on eight now shall I put it on .  415320_418660
*KBXPS00:	Oh you 've got it miles too high yeah you 've got it miles too high that 's why you 're getting feedback turn it right down right down to about number two or three or something like that .  418660_425710
*PS1DW:	Oh we wo n't be able to hear .  425710_426840
*KBXPS00:	Well you do n't want to hear what you .  426840_428340
*PS1DW:	Yeah read some of that then eh .  428340_429300
*KBXPS00:	you do n't want to hear too much of what you 're recording anyway do you .  429300_431230
*PS1DW:	Erm .  431230_431370
*KBXPS00:	Yeah this is in Luke chapter thirteen .  431370_434620
*PS1DW:	Matthew Mark Luke and John Luke Luke thirteen yes .  434620_443740
*KBXPS00:	and probably if you go from about twenty five or somewhere round there you 'll get the context of it .  443740_452210
*PS1DW:	Yeah twenty five says when once the householder has got up and locked the door and you start to stand outside and knock at the door saying sir open to us but in answer he will say to you I do not know where you are from then you will start saying we ate and drank in front of you and we 've taught in our broad ways but he will speak and say to you I do not know where you are from get away from me you are workers of unrighteousness .  452210_490670
*KBXPS00:	Mm this one now there is where you 'll .  490670_495310
*PS1DW:	there is where your whipping and the gnashing of your teeth will be when you see Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God .  495310_506170
*KBXPS00:	in the kingdom of God but your half of it 's thrown outside .  506170_508200
*PS1DW:	Yes but you 'll also be going outside yes .  508250_510820
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  510820_511320
*PS1DW:	erm .  511320_511660
*KBXPS00:	that mentions Abraham Isaac and Jacob there again does n't it .  511780_515730
*PS1DW:	Yeah .  515740_515750
*KBXPS00:	I 'm just wondering if there that 's related to that scripture that I 've just showed you .  515750_518960
*PS1DW:	Oh yes .  518960_519410
*KBXPS00:	It seems to be on the same lines do n't it .  519750_521780
*PS1DW:	Yes because Matthew Mark Luke and John were all witnesses of Jes Jesus' ministry on the earth were n't they .  521790_528880
*KBXPS00:	Mhm .  528900_529050
*PS1DW:	And erm they recorded different things but Mat but also they recorded the same things as well .  529340_536570
*KBXPS00:	Mm see the relation is also the sons of the kingdom will be the ones where the gnashing of the teeth er er will be .  536710_542270
*PS1DW:	Yes .  542270_542540
*KBXPS00:	outside the kingdom then .  542740_544790
*PS1DW:	yes yes that 's why it tells us in verse twenty four of Luke thirteen ex exert yourself vigorously to get in through the narrow door .  544790_556050
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  556530_556870
*PS1DW:	because many I tell you will seek to get in but will not be able .  557560_561850
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  561850_562280
*PS1DW:	So .  563250_563440
*KBXPS00:	going back to the the other chapter .  563630_565840
*PS1DW:	See we if I can just say Mark now you and I know this truth pe pe people in the world generally do n't know what you and I know do they That 's why the .  565840_575780
*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*PS1DW:	of the kingdom must go from door to door from city to city from village to village they do n't know about it but once we do know about it then we 're sort of accountable are n't we .  575780_586640
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  586660_586780
*PS1DW:	That 's right yes .  587550_588250
*KBXPS00:	responsible yeah .  588250_589040
*PS1DW:	we do n't want to be like these ones that erm got to know and it and er that have done away it says erm that 's where the gnashing and at the tooth will be thrown outside .  589040_602790
*KBXPS00:	You see this one in chapter page of Matthew and verse twelve as I mentioned I was just wondering if some if that 's got something to do with the faith of the army officers or something like cos .  602790_614620
*PS1DW:	Oh yes I think erm .  614620_616620
*KBXPS00:	whether it 's related to that particular thing .  616620_619560
*PS1DW:	Yes .  620200_620330
*KBXPS00:	you know .  620330_620560
*PS1DW:	well it well it would be but it 's a set pattern for us as we are today .  620560_624310
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  624310_624720
*PS1DW:	Yes the army officers shall we just read a bit more of that bit .  630280_634530
*KBXPS00:	Mm a bit further back probably .  634530_635860
*PS1DW:	Yeah just to get the picture of it .  635860_637970
*KBXPS00:	Mm cos it 's got in relation to that ai n't it Somehow or other .  637970_641120
*PS1DW:	Yes that 's .  641120_641520
*KBXPS00:	it 's sort of in relation to it there must of been some reason why he said that to take them to hear more to other people .  641530_646660
*PS1DW:	Yes .  646660_646970
*KBXPS00:	must of had a bearing on him saying that .  647540_649130
*PS1DW:	Oh yes I think the story is that Matthew heard this voice shall we just read from there .  649130_653840
*KBXPS00:	Mhm .  653840_654070
*PS1DW:	Because then Jesus said to him who was he talking to let's let's start off on the verse one after er after he had come down from the mountains great crowds followed him that 's Jesus is n't it .  654200_667880
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  667880_668050
*PS1DW:	and with a leprous man came over and began doing a to him saying Lord if you just want to you can make me clean and so stretching out his hand he touched him saying I want to be made clean and immediately his leprosy was vanished away then Jesus said to him see that you tell no one but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses appointed for the purpose of a witness to them when he entered into Calpurnia that 's the other two that the other .  668060_706960
*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*PS1DW:	is n't it .  706960_707570
*KBXPS00:	Mhm .  707620_707880
*PS1DW:	When he entered into Calpurnia an army officer came to him and tricking him and saying sir my manservant is laid up in the house with paralysis being terribly tormented he said to him when I get there I will cure her in reply the army officer said sir I am not a fit man for you to enter under my roof but just say the word and my manservant will be healed .  707890_743590
*KBXPS00:	That 's the old faith int it .  744020_745390
*PS1DW:	Exactly Jesus was saying to this officer that I 'll cure your master when I get there .  745390_750550
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  750550_750590
*PS1DW:	but what but what marvellous faith he must of had .  750590_753870
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  753870_754090
*PS1DW:	Yes you say they were they .  754090_755250
*KBXPS00:	Mm yeah .  755250_755550

*PS1DW:	that 's right Mark yes .  757150_758080
*KBXPS00:	He had the faith that 's the main thing int it .  758080_760220
*PS1DW:	Yes er it goes on to say erm for I too am a man placed under authority having soldiers under me see Jesus was a man of authority the other officer was saying the same .  760270_773310
*KBXPS00:	Mm the bribery yeah .  773310_773760
*PS1DW:	Mm that 's right and I say to this one be on your way and he 's on his way and to another come and he comes and to my slave dither and he does it Hearing that Jesus became amazed and said to those following him I tell you the truth but no one in Israel have I faced to a greater face so that 's quite some statement that Jesus has made .  773760_798750

*KBXPS00:	faith which he had .  859730_862080
*PS1DW:	Yeah well .  862080_862310
*KBXPS00:	There must of been some particular reason why why why he mentioned that which maybe might be difficult to try and realize .  862310_869160
*PS1DW:	Yes I can see your point Mark I see .  869250_872540
*KBXPS00:	you know in other words it might take a bit of time to work it out there is some reason why he must of said that must n't did n't he .  872540_877690
*PS1DW:	Yes why did he go on to speak about this .  877690_878890

*PS1DW:	Yeah .  919420_919840
*KBXPS00:	because that required faith at the same sort as the army officer had .  919840_925350
*PS1DW:	Yes and the .  925370_926760
*KBXPS00:	and the ones that had been cast out would be without that thing so that 's why it 's gone in relation to that it 's because those that did n't have the faith that the army officer had would be cast out as the sons of the sons of the kingdom that 's why he mentioned it in likeness .  926760_940360
*PS1DW:	The the type .  940360_941220
*KBXPS00:	there .  941610_941740

*PS1DW:	Yes .  948760_949100
*KBXPS00:	that 's why he said related to it somehow .  949100_951550
*PS1DW:	Yes not that you 've all had that same faith as the other officer had .  951550_955910
*KBXPS00:	Mm cos there that chapter thirteen .  955910_956720
*PS1DW:	but not to that degree degree yeah .  956720_958240
*KBXPS00:	Mm it carries on of the same account there then he said to the army officer you see .  958240_962340
*PS1DW:	Yes .  962340_962800

*PS1DW:	and everybody will have an opportunity of learning about that kingdom .  981730_985880
*KBXPS00:	Mm you see at the end of the day one has to work out if this is gon na be an earthly er point towards the kingdom that 's the different between this faith and any other faith is n't it Any other faith does n't believe there 's gon na be an earth left does do they They be .  985880_1003610
*PS1DW:	Has a yes .  1004430_1004790
*KBXPS00:	they believe it 's all going to be in a story do n't they Basically .  1004870_1006760
*PS1DW:	Yes a lot of people will read that yes .  1006770_1008470
*KBXPS00:	but you see unless the day was cut short no flesh would be saved anyway so it proves in Matthew that there is gon na be some flesh left .  1008470_1014810
*PS1DW:	Yes that 's right .  1014810_1016850
*KBXPS00:	and as we 've learnt in first Corinthians chapter fifteen that all different animals have different sorts of flesh we 've got different flesh than than different animals have n't we .  1016850_1027830
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1027830_1028010

*PS1DW:	Aye do you know why that is do n't you .  1044130_1045830
*KBXPS00:	Cos it 's cos of the sin obviously .  1045830_1047310

*KBXPS00:	Yeah .  1051010_1051110
*PS1DW:	but and this kingdom takes over Jesus was a ransom sacrifice he brought bought people back that 's those that have faith so in the new when this new system comes round when the king comes round the earth we 'll start to grow young again and then that way we 'll have a sort of a different flesh wo n't we .  1051110_1069190
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  1069190_1069450
*PS1DW:	When we grow young again .  1069450_1070890
*KBXPS00:	Mhm it 'll be you see you are if you I think if you believe in in God which is the main point of the thing then you can believe who 's capable of anything .  1070890_1081300
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1081310_1081320
*KBXPS00:	I mean you 've got to bear in mind that God created the the heavens and and the earth and any human that 's er in God 's memory who 's is deceased out the way if you 've got enough faith you can believe that you can bring anything back .  1081320_1096290
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1096290_1096390

*KBXPS00:	with God .  1107170_1107410

*KBXPS00:	Mm .  1110730_1110850
*PS1DW:	when he was on the earth he cured that .  1110850_1112770

*PS1DW:	Exactly .  1119260_1119570
*KBXPS00:	Mm so people that just believe that you 're going to heaven have n't quite got the faith to believe that there 'll be people on earth as well .  1119570_1126870
*PS1DW:	Exactly yes .  1127270_1127630

*KBXPS00:	Mm and that and that at the end of the day I suppose there has to be a point for the kingdom and it was n't easy to get into that because all the the the accounts are all about how big a struggle it is to get into the kingdom .  1149270_1163750
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1163750_1163960
*KBXPS00:	which proves that it would n't be easy to get in there anyway so .  1163960_1167790
*PS1DW:	No .  1167790_1167880
*KBXPS00:	it is n't granted automatically it 's something that has to be worked out because it 's not easy to get there it 's a narrow gate .  1167880_1174440
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1174450_1174460

*PS1DW:	Yes and you 've got the time .  1419760_1421690

*PS1DW:	Mm .  1450190_1450610

*PS1DW:	Yes .  1510110_1510360
*KBXPS00:	do they .  1510360_1510570
*PS1DW:	Well it the reason you know the reason why some are going to heaven when you think of a kingdom .  1510570_1517310
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  1517310_1517500
*PS1DW:	and you think of our country here in England .  1517500_1519860
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  1519860_1520240

*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*PS1DW:	to go to heaven to be part of this kingdom but for the rest of mankind which are obedient which do accept er the truth they will live in paradise on the earth .  1555030_1566750
*KBXPS00:	Mm you see a lot of the er the English scriptures talk about the the paradise in in its right context you can just examine the the the Christian script which you might get confused because there 's a lot of er things that can take them both ways .  1566750_1584740
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1584770_1584860
*KBXPS00:	like for instance chapter ten of John verse sixteen which talks about other sheep which are not of this fold you you might think that er that 's talking about what er the logical sense of that scripture is that the dividing line with sheep and you get different sort of folds do n't you .  1584860_1604260
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1604260_1604440
*KBXPS00:	So at that time that could of been taken into the context of or one anyway going to the same place .  1604450_1610020
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1610020_1610090
*KBXPS00:	which only in future years that er it 's added up to er significant point .  1610090_1614190
*PS1DW:	That 's right and then er those ones those sheep which you 've just mentioned er are a myth .  1614190_1620910
*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*KBXPS00:	oh mm cos one thing really gave the key away was in the the sermon on the mount where Jesus said that the meek ought ought to inherit the earth .  1621400_1635480
*PS1DW:	Yeah .  1635480_1636100
*KBXPS00:	which proves that er that it 's a separate class .  1636270_1640300
*PS1DW:	For those who are going to heaven .  1640300_1642690
*KBXPS00:	well mm this is the point at the end of the day to prove the truth you 've got ta prove in your mind that there is gon na be a separate sort of clasp between the what there there is a scripture I think .  1642690_1651910
*KBXPSUN:	Come on .  1651910_1652390
*KBXPS00:	it 's in first Corinthians it talks about for I think I 'm in a vision of the third heaven which was actually a vision it was n't a reality it 's like a revelation was a vision I do n't think it was the reality of heaven was it It was vision .  1652390_1665920
*PS1DW:	I ca n't comment without just looking at it Mark er I 'm afraid .  1665920_1670080
*KBXPS00:	No there was a vision and I think the the Apostle had was of the third heaven .  1670080_1673630
*PS1DW:	Yes yes you may be right but I 'm I 'm just about erm in the dark a bit .  1673690_1678890
*KBXPS00:	the third heaven I thought it I think I 've I 've looked in the re the aid book what does the third heaven it was er it was more of a a dream more of a sym symbolic dream more than natural reality of vision of heaven do you know what I mean .  1679110_1694380
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1694580_1694710
*KBXPS00:	You see a lot of the er a lot of the vision that they had .  1694710_1700260
*PS1DW:	Something typifying .  1700260_1700510
*KBXPS00:	Mm the visions that they had were not as reality they were only like visions they had .  1700510_1706660

*PS1DW:	Yes .  1716780_1716900
*KBXPS00:	that even in in in the revelation the very beginning chapters to of had one to about chapter seven were very easy to understand once you understand what they 're saying because they 're all letters to each congregation at that time were n't they .  1716900_1734510
*PS1DW:	Yes they were yes .  1734510_1735260

*PS1DW:	Yes .  1760760_1760820
*KBXPS00:	one logical thing is that erm if erm letters were sent to er to angels which I do n't know whether that the judges believe that then you would n't actually need to send the literal letters to er angels who it because they 'd be far advanced in in whatever they 've got .  1760820_1781560
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1781600_1781690
*KBXPS00:	so you know the these one thing you 'll have to work out in a logical side of revelation .  1781700_1787390
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1787390_1787690
*KBXPS00:	in other words if you read it without any experience you might start thinking that it 's giving you a vision of the real heaven where as it 's just symbolic .  1787690_1796310
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1796320_1796330
*KBXPS00:	it 's all symbolism and this is one of the things you have to work out to to find out whether there is er .  1796330_1805900
*PS1DW:	You know can I just ask you something Talk about angels you know these are heavenly erm spirits are n't they .  1807310_1820570

*KBXPS00:	they do exist .  1869490_1870630
*PS1DW:	Then then the demons are these proper angels at one time .  1870630_1874410

*PS1DW:	angels .  1875130_1875530
*KBXPS00:	Er to to work the truth out of things one has to think what Adam Adam had lost in the beginning what Jesus had to gain back cos according to the Corinthian 's letter that erm Jesus came back to buy back what Adam had lost and if you can work out what Adam had lost in the in the first place then you can see the point why you 're put on the earth and you can see that it that he he was given a commandment not to take off the the tree of kno knowledge written by were n't he .  1875530_1909950
*PS1DW:	That 's right .  1910100_1910660
*KBXPS00:	If he can work out that er what would of happened if he probably would n't of taken that .  1910670_1915580
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1915610_1916030
*KBXPS00:	and what was taken away when when he did break the rule then you can work out what Jesus brought back .  1917620_1922960
*PS1DW:	Yes that 's right then you can work that out .  1922960_1924630
*KBXPS00:	which was God 's spirit in some way .  1924630_1926270
*PS1DW:	Yes .  1926270_1926510

*KBXPS00:	Mm cos that 's what Jesus came to buy back God 's spirit .  1937730_1939900
*PS1DW:	That 's it because he was a perfect man Jesus .  1939910_1941760
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  1941760_1941960
*PS1DW:	not not like erm any descendants that would go on from Adam were born imperfect were n't they .  1941960_1948640

*PS1DW:	Well getting back to these fallen angels in what way must try and lead mankind today .  1960510_1967840
*KBXPS00:	One of the big ways is is spiritualism and things that are not real things that are sort of er blind in the mind of the unbeliever as it were in other words material things probably and things that have under revelation .  1967840_1986140
*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*KBXPS00:	according towards the under revelation he talks about how these these dumb idols and these pieces of gold have got nothing in them and that 'd be way in which the the ones would be caught out because of these gold or whatever have got nothing in them you see .  1986140_2004870
*PS1DW:	What what about Ouija boards .  2004900_2006640
*KBXPS00:	Well this is another method is n't it Er .  2006640_2009220
*PS1DW:	0 . 
*KBXPS00:	of tricking people into believing sort of things that are n't true which they 're saying that er they 're talking to deceased people like people said they talked to er Elvis Presley .  2009220_2024380
*PS1DW:	Yes .  2025010_2025320
*KBXPS00:	has been er one woman that claims to continuously talk to him from where he where he where he is where you know .  2025390_2033880

*PS1DW:	Yes .  2041820_2042090
*KBXPS00:	obviously beyond that that sort of thing ca n't prove anyway but she 's claiming to to talk to this particular singer whatever you know .  2042090_2052460
*PS1DW:	Lots lots of people claim in fact ever such a lot of people claim that they 've got communication with the dead for instance that as you know I 've got a caravan ai n't I at Rudyard Lake .  2053440_2063510
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  2063510_2063800
*PS1DW:	And there 's a lady there and er got a caravan and her husband had died and she wanted me to swap caravans her 's was actually a better condition caravan than mine .  2063800_2075110
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  2075110_2075210
*PS1DW:	where it she said it was too big for her and er she wanted something smaller with a swap well I did n't swap for the reason mine was overlooking the lake it was in a better position and er then she told me the reason she wanted to swap cos er she said it was too big cos her husband had died I started to speak to her about when God 's kingdom comes on the earth these dead ones will come back these loved ones .  2075210_2098950
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  2098950_2099210
*PS1DW:	oh he 's already with me now she says .  2099210_2101600
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  2101650_2101730

*KBXPS00:	Mm .  2103160_2103280
*PS1DW:	and she she was absolutely sure and there 's lots of people that .  2103280_2106320
*KBXPS00:	Mm .  2106400_2106840
*PS1DW:	say things like that .  2107180_2107940
*KBXPS00:	Mm well actually when when somebody passes away lots of people say that when they pass away they 've received their spirit .  2107940_2113200
*PS1DW:	Yes .  2113250_2113410
*KBXPS00:	that 's came to them .  2113410_2115080
*PS1DW:	Yes so what act so do you know Mark what it is that makes these people think those things .  2115080_2122410
*KBXPS00:	Well there must be another force that makes them see them things must n't there .  2122410_2126430
*PS1DW:	Yes .  2126440_2126450
*KBXPS00:	Er it is n't actually controlled by them .  2126450_2129020
*PS1DW:	No .  2129020_2129320
*KBXPS00:	it is actually some other thing .  2129690_2131140
*PS1DW:	and .  2131140_2131340
*KBXPS00:	you know .  2131340_2131910
*PS1DW:	and this other force is the fallen angels the demons if they they can have oh this women used to say oh he 's with me he he 's in bed with me at night .  2131910_2140370
*KBXPS00:	Mhm .  2140370_2140470
*PS1DW:	so these demons these fallen angels have got you see you 've got to serve them and and those of the bible but once you 're dead you go to the grave you see and that 's it you 're not conscious of anything at all it says .  2140470_2153600
*KBXPS00:	Mm what the .  2153600_2154140
*PS1DW:	but but these things .  2154140_2155330
*KBXPS00:	You 've got to bear in mind though that that that the scriptures which you can use in the Hebrew context were before the resurrection was possible so you had to be careful that er that you do n't bounce because when Jesus came to the earth he changed that though did n't he He he made possible for for a resurrection .  2155330_2174250
*PS1DW:	Oh that 's right .  2174250_2175270
*KBXPS00:	you know what I mean .  2175280_2175690
*PS1DW:	Yes but only for a for a for a a few is n't it .  2175690_2178440
*KBXPS00:	Well obviously .  2178450_2178650
*PS1DW:	Relatively few and compared those that are going in the end going to another year .  2178820_2182650
*KBXPS00:	Well the scriptures do say that that er there are those that 'll be lost .  2182650_2186850
*PS1DW:	Yes well in .  2186850_2188410
*KBXPS00:	so there 's got ta be some hope for those that have have gone lost or whatever has n't there .  2188410_2192640
*PS1DW:	Erm in the past .  2192650_2195980
*KBXPS00:	Mm no well there is n't much hope for those that rejected Jesus in his time .  2195980_2201430
*PS1DW:	No I 'm .  2201430_2202860
*KBXPS00:	cos he mentioned that those were liable further to start him as a .  2202860_2205220
*KBXPSUN:	0 . 
*KBXPS00:	because he was actually there at the present if they if they could n't believe that when he was around then they 've got a big problem have n't they .  2205220_2213530
*PS1DW:	That 's right yes if they coul God 's son on the earth during these .  2213540_2217010

*KBXPS00:	Mhm .  2219090_2219240
*PS1DW:	then they 're not gon na accept him any time are they .  2219240_2221320
*KBXPS00:	That 's right so they they were n't liable anyway .  2221320_2222390
*PS1DW:	Yes .  2222390_2222820
*KBXPS00:	a complete destruction .  2222820_2223800
