@Comment:	conversation #111 (Tape 002411)
*CHR:	Lovely greenery dear.
*SUS:	Oh are we   (        ) everything we do?
*CHR:	Why, why does it worry you?
*SUS:	It doesn't worry me, it's just a bit silly walking about with a voice   (        ) you.
*NOR:	Here we are. (        ) .
*CHR:	Thank you dear.
*SUS:	Mum, did you make my sandwiches today?
*NOR:	No.
*SUS:	Didn't think so.
*NOR:	Should've made them  (        ) .
*SUS:	They were nice.
*CHR:	Were they nicer than usual?
*SUS:	No, different.
*CHR:	Different.What was the difference?
*SUS:	Got prawns and garlic.
*CHR:	What the flavour in the prawns you mean?
*SUS:	No, garlic.
*NOR:	 (        ) considering I   (        ) with it.There was prawns with garlic mayonnaise.
*CHR:	Mm.Looks very green dear.
*SUS:	It's lovely.
*CHR:	Do you think I'm environmental?
*SUS:	Why did they choose you to tape?
*CHR:	Ha, there was a knock at the door.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Nah
*NOR:	Nah or no?
*CHR:	I'm to explain roughly what they're up to, so I invited them in, they then explained exactly what they were up to , (        ) fine I'll do it.
*SUS:	I'll be pleased.
*NOR:	You can turn the radio off darling, we're not listening to it.
*SUS:	They say you could borrow the Walkman?
*CHR:	They gave me, the equipment, and the tapes and the batteries and eh, the recorded paper and all the rest of it, cos that's part, essential part of the whole thing.
*NOR:	You hang, handed back didn't you?
*CHR:	Oh yes, yes.
*SUS:	How many people are they taking then?
*CHR:	I've no idea, I didn't ask.
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*NOR:	 (        ) what work they use, in general conversation these days.
*CHR:	Oh, accents, things like that.Spoken, spoken English as opposed to record of written English, that's the essence of it.
*SUS:	If I'd taken it, the language   (        ) would be different.
*NOR:	Of course, but I think they'll have a wide
*CHR:	Mm.
*NOR:	variety of people, otherwise their research isn't valid, is it?
*CHR:	Yes, the, the lady in question was saying what, she had to have, I think, I think what she was saying was, that for every person over forty five she had to have somebody under forty five.
*NOR:	Presumably the same number of men as women and
*CHR:	Yeah, probably.
*SUS:	What, do you have to stand there when you walk down the street, and when you go to   (        ) 
*NOR:	Only when you're having a conversation.
*CHR:	When I answer the telephone, I switch it off.I done that numerous times today   (.) but I'm trying to do it right by keeping it going all the time when I'm likely to be in conversation, so there are occasional blank spaces on the tapes.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	It was quite funny yesterday, because, he, when I went out in the garden there was a football nestling in the rose bushes, I heaved it back over the fence, thirty seconds later the two boys came roaring out of the house, and about thirty seconds after that
*SUS:	It's back over again.
*CHR:	it, no, it's up in the app  (.) top of the apple tree, and they were chucking sticks at it, trying to get it down again.
*SUS:	Why don't you just open the back gate so that they can come and collect their stuff when they want it?
*CHR:	Well I've said it actually, if you do it frequently you can't be bothered I suppose.
*NOR:	Probably their dad said you mustn't go in there too often.
*CHR:	Mm.
*NOR:	It takes   (        ) snob  (.) 
*SUS:	You'll be pleased to know dad, that I am going to go to the   (        ) tomorrow night.
*NOR:	Oh 
*CHR:	Oh no 
*NOR:	You haven't been there for ages.
*SUS:	Mm.
*CHR:	utterly overwhelmed dear, why?
*SUS:	Going  (        ) .
*NOR:	Does she go there from time to time?
*SUS:	Mm.
*NOR:	Has she said there's much the same people there or different crowd?
*SUS:	Same people really.
*NOR:	Does she still see Judith?
*SUS:	Judith  (        ) .
*NOR:	I find that hard to believe, how she  (        ) .
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*NOR:	Pardon?
*SUS:	Exactly.
*CHR:	So Sam doesn't like her either.
*SUS:	Mm.
*NOR:	It's not so much not liking, it's not really trusting people, like us.
*CHR:	I think not liking must come into it partly.
*SUS:	Mm 
*CHR:	Mean to say , that, that's the honest  (        ) .
*NOR:	It doesn't mean , it doesn't endear you to people does it?
*CHR:	No exactly, not likely my dear.
*SUS:	No I don't dislike Judith.
*NOR:	No, quite.
*CHR:	No.
*SUS:	I just wouldn't, if she rang up and says   (        ) I'd say no thanks.
*CHR:	Yes quite.
*NOR:	Thanks very much.
*CHR:	You don't like her.
*SUS:	No.
*CHR:	You've no reason to like her.
*SUS:	Mm.
*CHR:	Okay.
*NOR:	Why somebody lets me down like that  (        ) .You're not, you don't trust them, you're not going to put yourself on the line   (        ) are you, suppose  (        ) .There's plenty of other people in the world. (        ) you might think of some.
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	She's not really very with it, is she?Not very intelligent.
*SUS:	Not sort of thing   (        ) even if she did  (        ) .No, I, I wouldn't write her a snidey letter, I'd sit down and say look   (.)  (        ) .
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	I haven't seen him since  (.) 
*NOR:	Oh.Not planned to see  (        ) . (        ) , his name, address, (        ) .
*SUS:	Why?
*CHR:	What was that for?
*SUS:	You  (        ) .
*NOR:	That reminds me
*CHR:	Why did you want  (        ) ?
*NOR:	Cos Mrs  wanted her to use her  (        ) .
*CHR:	Oh.
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	It's a question of how you dance round them I suspect rather than the actual pole.
*NOR:	Mm.She wanted someone who would teach them, erm, (        ) .
*SUS:	Remember that silly thing we did at school once me with Charlotte and Suzanne and somebody else, do you remember?There was four of us and  (        ) .
*NOR:	 (        ) .Use the erm, they   (.) they invited the Chislehurst May Queen,dan  (.) maypole dancers to come to the next open evening.
*SUS:	No I'm not talking about that.
*NOR:	Oh sorry.
*SUS:	At Bromley High.
*NOR:	No I don't remember.
*SUS:	At   (        ) a silly sketch.
*NOR:	I never saw it.
*SUS:	You did, you did, (        ) floppy hats on.
*CHR:	Don't remember that.

*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	and said what had happened, and I also spoken to Cathy.Cathy would have come

*NOR:	Oh yes, (        ) .
*CHR:	Mm.
*NOR:	Another thing she couldn't step in, and do it over the head with someone who was supposed to be doing on that March.
*CHR:	No, no no, no.
*NOR:	But having left till the morning when she was due, I couldn't even let Cathy know because it puts her in an awkward position, suddenly turn up on the day.But it was Friday she did it, and Thursday we were expecting her, so there would have been time when she had  (        ) .I mean she hadn't even let me know the night before.
*CHR:	Mm.
*NOR:	It was only a chance that I rang her.

*NOR:	but now I don't know whether to pretend, just to leave it, or to say anything, don't want Cathy to think I was ungrateful.
*CHR:	I still haven't got my first aid certificate.I think perhaps, I shall contact Cyril, and say how about that drink we we've agreed to, we, we've enjoyed together?

*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Ring Cathy and mentioned it, but she was grateful for having interest.

*CHR:	Is there still a boycott at the canteen?
*SUS:	No. (        ) .

*NOR:	 ((huff)) 
*SUS:	They did, they come in and they   (        ) us and then they go home again.
*NOR:	Who are they?
*SUS:	Nobody knows.
*CHR:	I think you should do a survey, approach them with a clipper board as they come in and say
*NOR:	Which course you on?
*CHR:	delighted to see you, (        ) 
*SUS:	Well it's a joke , because, they take up all the seats, like they're in two   (        ) seats of four, and a, there is no way you can  (        ) , half the students  (        ) , these silly old people come in and they take up four seats and eat our lunch.
*NOR:	You   (        ) for everybody  (        ) .
*SUS:	Yeah, but at times they're expensive.
*NOR:	Shouldn't be, the more people that eat it, the cheaper it, the, should help keep the prices down.
*SUS:	Yeah, but they do   (        ) though. (        ) .
*CHR:	Certainly 
*NOR:	Perhaps it's the college's bit of charity.
*CHR:	Even the canteen staff don't know who they are.
*SUS:	Bet they do.
*NOR:	Ladies from the street, with poor with poor pensions .
*SUS:	Yeah they're regulars, they come in every day.
*NOR:	Mm .
*CHR:	 ((cough)) I don't think, eh, (        ) college of fashion should be supporting the ladies of the streets dear.
*SUS:	I   (        ) like it though.
*NOR:	Maybe they're the cleaners.
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	You mean bag ladies or street ladies?
*SUS:	Bag ladies.
*CHR:	Aha.
*SUS:	I know they're definitely not cleaners.
*NOR:	Do you  (        ) .
*SUS:	No.Right, one woman she comes in, with an ice cream tub, and fills up with food and goes home, in an ice cream tub.
*NOR:	She must be very poor.
*SUS:	Erm you don't know you know because the more our college prices keep going up and up, B H S   (        ) on it, they are cheaper than our corned beef.

*NOR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	Ice cream tub.
*CHR:	Does she pay for it?

*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Strange business.
*SUS:	Yeah, but  (        ) .
*NOR:	Maybe not.
*SUS:	But then again the students' bar is ridiculously cheap.
*CHR:	Do they go into the bar?
*SUS:	No. (        ) thirty P for a coke.Fifty P for a Cinzano and lemonade, or whatever.
*CHR:	Mm, mm.
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	What's a pint of bitter?
*SUS:	Don't know  (        ) .You know, how come the bar managers

*SUS:	erm, how come the bar meals used to be so cheap when the canteen's  (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Of course, ((cough)) , there's a big profit. (        ) .
*NOR:	It seems to me this student bar, does have to make a vast profit.Anyway it's probably run by students.
*SUS:	 (        ) .Yeah it is.
*CHR:	Is there   (        ) bar   (        ) students?Is there a steward?
*NOR:	Might be a man in charge, but they probably don't have to pay lots of wages.
*SUS:	There is there No.
*NOR:	And make lots of profit.
*SUS:	 (        ) But, I don't think it makes any profit, but, you know, (        ) profit.
*SUS:	That's why it's cheap.
*CHR:	Mm.
*NOR:	Whereas pubs are different, they are out, they have to pay a lot of people and their rent and everything else and they are ours to make a profit.
*SUS:	 (        ) 
*NOR:	 (        ) .Except for a small diversion and nibble some bits of lamb when I was cutting up the meat lunchtime, and to try and   (        ) serving of it.
