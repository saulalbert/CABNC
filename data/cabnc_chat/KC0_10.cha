*ENI:	 ((laugh))  (.) Belinda   (.) if we can start with you more or less   (.) erm   (.) I heard the other day that you're   (.) half thinking that you might like to be   (.) a nurse?
*NOE:	Yeah, that's it.That's right.Mhm.
*ENI:	 [whispering] Can you speak up a bit.
*UNK:	Speak up a bit Belinda!
*ENI:	What erm   (.) what sort of nurse are you thinking about?
*NOE:	Nursery nurse, looking after young children in nurseries and stuff like that.Mhm.
*ENI:	I can imagine you doing that.
*NOE:	Can you?
*ENI:	Aha.
*NOE:	Mhm.
*ENI:	I can.
*NOE:	Yes.I'm going, for work experience I'm going to Saxted Ministry up there hopefully   (.) to see what it's like looking after children   (.) you know, like a nursery and everything.So hopefully I can get the job there   (.) from that two weeks, and then   (        ) 
*ENI:	That would be wonderful!
*NOE:	what it's like.Yeah.
*ENI:	I didn't 
*NOE:	Yes.
*ENI:	know there was one at Saxted 
*NOE:	Yeah, it's called Rainbow.I think, isn't it?Yeah.
*UNK:	Oh that's right, yes.
*ENI:	And is that for children who are   (.) living there or just go in for the day?

*ENI:	And what qualifications mus must you have for that?
*NOE:	Erm, I don't really know at the moment, I gotta look up and see what it needs, like   (        ) and things    (.)  (        ) to do   (.) and study, things like that.
*ENI:	Mhm.
*NOE:	Mm.Mhm.

*ENI:	That's a good idea!
*NOE:	Yeah.
*ENI:	You get a feeling for it then.
*NOE:	Yeah.
*ENI:	I think it's one of the best jobs for a girl that there are don't you?
*UNK:	Well I think so, I think   (.) erm   (.) as long as they can go and work with children   (.) and then   (.) they've got the time when they can leave off and come, but it's having the whole time, well then they've children all their life haven't they?
*ENI:	Yes.
*UNK:	This is the only thing if   (.) you go sort of privately   (.) you know?
*ENI:	Yes.
*UNK:	You can fe  (.) start of with children and you are finishing up with children!
*ENI:	Well that   (.) well tha  (.) wo would tha would you not think that's a good thing?
*UNK:	Erm
*ENI:	I mean, for instance, if you do the   (.) the very high grade Norlands nanny training   (.) they go on till they're   (.) grey and   (.) experienced it all 
*UNK:	 [laughing] Like me  [] !
*ENI:	haven't they?Well, you know i  (.) don't they?Well 
*NOE:	Yeah.
