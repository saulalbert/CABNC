*PS101:	Erm therefore it does n't really I mean therefore she does n't pass So there is some judgement and skill involved And I think her judgement is impaired by the fact she feels nervous And is anxious not to overdo it and cos that 's another where you fail again . 
*PS102:	Yes unless somebody . 
*PS101:	bad enough But he would n't be letting you use your time if you were that poor at it because they do build you up very slowly over two years she 's been doing it .  25015_36985

*PS101:	Has she not passed dogs on or They 're more like children than dogs .  173905_179675
*PS102:	Oh yes Yes more like more like children than children to her actually Erm the only thing that occurred to me I just wondered if she knew somebody who had a dearly loved dog that did n't want to train it but you know she could perhaps just take along for the joy of running it and training it but I think part of the pleasure is the reflected glory you know it 's my dog .  179675_203215
*PS101:	Well it 's .  203215_203985

*PS102:	I was just trying to remember whether they did Joan 's do at the last year But I 've got a feeling they did n't No they they did n't because the that 's right because it was cancelled last year it was the year before she did But I thought they were perfectly acceptable and surprised in a way that so many people commented adversely on them Because they do n't make a bad noise .  287545_322625
*PS05X:	I think it 's people who do n't like trad jazz Lynda .  322625_324465
*PS102:	That 's right .  324475_325045

*PS05X:	Mm .  363355_363555
*PS102:	But might not be the best thing because if for any reason the buyer says that they did n't they 're not going to pay .  365225_379705
*PS05X:	I I I think we 've got to accept that that on that business we have we have do not have secure terms period .  379705_386175
*PS102:	Right but should we insure it fully .  386175_389495
*PS05X:	Not fully But contingency .  389495_391365
*PS102:	Contingency is I thought was just sort of between here and the airport .  391405_395395

*PS102:	0 . 
*PS05X:	That is what it is for That is what it is Contingency is if the customer having the buyer having said he will cover the insurance does n't .  399915_410315
*PS102:	Mm .  410815_411015
*PS05X:	and then does n't get his money does n't pay us .  411015_414495

*PS05X:	we can claim .  414615_415345

*PS05X:	Yes .  419335_419425
*PS102:	Fine O K .  419625_420195
*PS05X:	Yes We will probably have to prove that we have not been paid for the consignment .  420885_426235
*PS102:	Interesting .  426235_426735
*PS05X:	Interesting possibility But it it it 's not covering from factory to airport or anything of that sort It is definitely covering .  426735_432535
*PS102:	Right covering part of the risk .  432725_433805
*PS05X:	Yes .  434105_434245
*PS102:	But not the .  434245_434995

*PS102:	I do do it for .  445424_446501
*PS05X:	Do you Right O K Ah .  446501_468031
*PS102:	contingency only .  468271_474991
*PS05X:	I suppose it it does n't matter very much one way or the other does it .  474991_481271
*PS102:	What to them cheaper .  481271_483721
*PS05X:	Cheaper to us erm the trouble with it is of course we never actually add it in Do we .  483721_489951

*PS102:	But it 's usually .  503881_504661
*PS05X:	It is a small sum yes that 's quite true Great .  504731_507201
*PS102:	I do add it into the costs if it 's .  507201_514411
*PS05X:	Ah Yes .  514951_520391
*PS102:	do n't know do they .  520401_520781
*PS05X:	No that 's true That 's quite true Now er Richard rang me at five o'clock yesterday .  520791_525821
*PS102:	That 's an old fashioned half an hour .  525831_528101
*PS05X:	Yes He did say that he 'd tried to ring before I got back from lunch but I 'm not one hundred percent certain Erm but it was n't it was twenty past two when I got back from lunch Erm and the erm I saw John at lunchtime and I mentioned it to him because he he said that it had n't even occurred to me till then because he said I 'm concentrating on the surveying side and I thought ha ha ha to you my friend Would you like Richard 's work telephone number .  528211_558401
*PS102:	why not Did you discover what company he works for .  558681_561411
*PS05X:	No I did n't I 'm afraid .  561411_562361
*PS102:	Oh .  562361_562511
*PS05X:	No I did n't erm I did n't ask But he said er and I said that I gather you 're seeing Lynda the weekend if you do find anything perhaps you could pass it on to her And John said oh it will give me something to do It is a bit desperate is n't it .  562511_580951
*PS102:	0 . 
*PS05X:	I think Lewisham have got themselves into a ludicrous state over people er Erm being pushed sideways into jobs that do n't match and being paid full price I do n't want Erm being paid their full salary Yeah we do n't want you any more so go and go and twiddle your thumbs in this corner but they 're still paying them twenty thousand a year Absolute farce Absolutely farcical .  580951_616211
*PS102:	But I thought John had been put into a job that in fact he was born to and getting his teeth into .  616211_622511
*PS05X:	Absolutely Absolutely but he 's up against the fact that nobody wants to know what he 's doing Quality control I mean er client satisfaction things of that sort I 'm not quite sure what he 's into But er being a local authority they 're saying oh come on Why make the effort .  622511_641521
*PS102:	I mean sadly that really was in a sense what making local authorities answerable was supposed to stamp out .  641521_647891
*PS05X:	Yes And of course local government is the most wonderful procrastinator in the world is n't it .  648131_652071
*PS102:	Yes but if they truly were answerable for their own budgets .  652181_655191
*PS05X:	Oh sure .  655191_655701
*PS102:	which they 're still not .  655851_656631
*PS05X:	No .  656631_656781
*PS102:	and you know never will be now .  656801_657941
*PS05X:	That 's right That 's absolutely right .  657951_659431
*PS102:	er that things go on like that .  659431_660571
*PS05X:	That 's right And that 's going to be .  660581_661671
*PS102:	But who does it benefit It does n't benefit I was quite convinced that ninety nine percent of people do not actually enjoy sitting doing nothing You like to feel useful .  661671_671431
*PS05X:	Oh absolutely .  671431_672131
*PS102:	But who does that benefit apart from the fact they 're getting a salary at the end of the day .  672131_675651
*PS05X:	Nobody Nobody Nobody But but when initially presented to you here 's twenty thousand a year for doing nothing my friend It 's it has an element of appeal does n't it .  676611_684911
*PS102:	Well clearly you 'd rather being doing that than doing .  684911_687441
*PS05X:	Getting nothing for doing nothing .  687441_690061
*PS102:	Yes Yes But why ca n't they get their act together and . 
*PS05X:	Yes Yes I agree .  696411_697701
*PS102:	I suppose at the end of the day yes you 're right He 's as well sit pushing papers around pretending to be busy but drawing the salary than being made redundant which is what ought to be happening .  697741_707451
*PS05X:	Yes .  707951_708061
*PS102:	But they could possibly they surely must be able to do it through natural wastage to some extent .  708061_712061
*PS05X:	I would have thought so .  712061_712531
*PS102:	I mean all the time .  712641_714751
*PS05X:	This Guys er business incidentally They 're now saying four hundred jobs will go but less than a hundred will be made redundant The other three hundred will go through natural wastage .  715151_726911
*PS102:	They said six . 
*PS05X:	They said six hundred originally apparently but then and now they 're talking four hundred There was some rather naff comments about the union people cohse I mean what a shower Erm On television last night there was some waffling about nothing and complaining they had n't been told .  728791_745381
*PS102:	I do n't I honestly do n't know what the answer is with the National Health but it 's going to take years and years and years But probably we 'll always .  745381_754281
*PS05X:	I think the Guys situation is a very interesting experiment It 's a shame it 's going on under a microscope spotlight or whatever but erm Spotlight I mean do n't a microscope Erm but even so it 's er it 's it 's interesting And Guys needs it for goodness sake Guys definitely needs it .  754281_776141
*PS102:	If you look at all the nationalized industries that have been privatized they 're all making thumping great profits now I would n't say it was like the Gas Board like B T And I would n't say that we were being fleeced I mean I I think we 've always been fleeced up to a certain point but they were always making a loss in the past and .  776141_796881
*PS05X:	Well their their accounting was cock-eyed in commercial terms Lynda It it really was different accounting which is hardly comparable Erm and I see nothing wrong with making decent profits as long as you 're not actually ripping people off as a monopoly .  796881_812371
*PS102:	Yes I think it 's a bit dubious what they do with the profits after .  813421_816271
*PS05X:	Well Oh that that 's a different matter That is a surely .  816291_818951
*PS102:	I mean with something like British Gas erm to make the enormous profit they 've made surely it must be possible to reduce the price to the consumer .  818951_827721
*PS05X:	I would have thought so yes .  827911_829361
*PS102:	And they can give you all sorts of reasons why .  829361_832241
*PS05X:	Erm I I I must say I have n't read or heard anything about the British Gas thing .  832711_835021
*PS102:	billion .  835871_836131
*PS05X:	Oh yes I knew they 'd made a lot of money But erm what they were going to do I do n't know .  836501_841051
*PS102:	justify why they 're not going to reduce the price .  841281_843051
*PS05X:	But the South West Water Authority or whatever they 're called erm also made a big profit did n't they But the guy said well ninety percent of this has got to be spent on a small proportion of the works which we are required to do over the next decade .  843081_856821
*PS102:	Well that 's fine You know if British Gas training themselves more efficient or whatever else it is fine .  856821_863091
*PS05X:	Yes Yes Yes it 's when you see British Telecom repainting all their vans with this silly new logo that you get a bit twitchy do n't you .  863091_870171
*PS102:	0 . 
*PS05X:	Mm .  872351_872581
*PS102:	I think the health length of waiting lists for operations and the furore about the fact that you 've got to ring up and find where the shortest list is and all that .  874701_888451
*PS05X:	Mm .  888581_888641
*PS102:	which is a sensible thing to do in a way Lots of people say well I do n't mind waiting or whatever .  889281_893351
*PS05X:	Well Norman on his wall has a a a list of er theoretical waitings for the different specialists at Orpington hospital and presumably he 's got one beside it for Queen Mary 's as well .  893351_903781
*PS102:	Mm .  904231_904291
*PS05X:	So he can actually look at and say oh well Queen Mary 's is the place for you to go my friend .  904611_908111
*PS102:	And some people might say oh I do n't want to go there I 'd rather wait .  908111_910861
*PS05X:	That 's right Absolutely .  910891_912051
*PS102:	You know it 's going to work out .  912051_912851
*PS05X:	So it it 's happening already .  912921_914441
*PS102:	Yes .  914441_914691
*PS05X:	To some degree .  914691_915831
*PS102:	But er they 're never going to I do n't think they 're ever going to get on top of the waiting lists because they 're introducing so many new operations .  916451_922961
*PS05X:	That 's right Yes .  923361_923801
*PS102:	So And there are people living longer and needing them But it 's always going to .  924051_927721
*PS05X:	You you have got to have a waiting list to use the facilities reasonably fully .  928021_933111
*PS102:	Yes otherwise you 'd have sort of hanging around and asking .  933721_935941
*PS05X:	That 's right .  935991_936351
*PS102:	how is that hip .  936821_937551
