*NOR:	I bet you have your coffee haven't you?
*CHR:	We have thank you dear, Susan's looked after us very nicely, yes, yes, all's well.
*LYN:	You got these bits, (        ) after the address, I don't think  (        ) .
*CHR:	What bits?Oh you mean the lining for the wedding, the bridesmaid dress.Oh I see so.So .
*LYN:	Is it near enough?
*CHR:	That's, that's the outer one .
*LYN:	That's the lining.And that's .
*CHR:	That's the lining.
*LYN:	That's of the erm.
*CHR:	The net.
*LYN:	The outer one.
*CHR:	Oh I see.
*LYN:	You know it's going to be near enough match.Great problems.
*NOR:	The right  (        ) .
*LYN:	Well this is it, and I thought underneath.
*NOR:	Is the   (.) the net going underneath.
*LYN:	The net goes on as well.
*NOR:	Oh yeah.
*LYN:	It's all underneath.
*NOR:	 (        ) .
*LYN:	This is the top.
*NOR:	 (        ) .erm, so it's a sort of net  (        ) .
*LYN:	The net is just a  (        ) .
*NOR:	Yeah.
*LYN:	Yeah.Oh yeah in fact if anything  (        ) .
*NOR:	Well I felt that it was better than having white.
*LYN:	Yes.
*NOR:	Net, erm.It's a very deep blue.
*LYN:	 (        ) .
*NOR:	And the bridesmaid's, the little bridesmaid's jacket are this colour and this colour in print and   (        ) all out of fabric and erm   (        ) definitely go for the darker.
*LYN:	Yes.
*NOR:	Something more bluey.
*LYN:	Must be hard.
*NOR:	Got to get the right  (        ) .
*LYN:	Rather you  (        ) .
*NOR:	You think you no a colour until you try the er, and the one I actually picked out when she measured it off, she'd only got three yards and I needed four and a half.
*LYN:	Oh.
*NOR:	So she said I'm sorry, so I got the next nearest, I just cannot waste any more time  (        ) .
*CHR:	What a   (.) pest .
*LYN:	When's the wedding?
*NOR:	 (        ) , but if I don't do it at half term it would be left to the end   (        ) .
*CHR:	Well, poor old Veronica is going on holiday or something of that sort .
*NOR:	No, she's been.
*CHR:	Oh has she?
*NOR:	Yes.
*CHR:	Ah, good.
*NOR:	But she's also got lot's of other.
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	Wedding's, similar to  (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes.
*NOR:	But we have booked with her, she knows it's coming, but I want to be able to start when she wants to start, (        ) .
*LYN:	Rather than hanging on.
*NOR:	Well also there's all the fittings, fitting them round   (        ) and trips to   (        ) and all the other things.
*LYN:	What  (        ) .
*NOR:	Erm   (.) it's not   (        ) no, the little ones are, cos them going to be three quarters and it's got a full skirt with a, an over panel, and she's got frills in the back of her skirt and got an over panel over it, can't describe it, it is pretty, and the neck is just slightly on the edge of the shoulder, (        ) got a frill and no sleeves, and the little ones got puff sleeves and high neck.
*LYN:	Hm.
*NOR:	They have that particular one because the two little girls   (        ) wanted to be bridesmaid's  (        ) , have just been bridesmaid's and have these dresses and Anna thought the colour was so pretty, cos she went into Laura Ashley and got one in the sale of   (        ) last years stock.
*LYN:	Yeah.
*NOR:	For Layla, seven pounds.
*LYN:	Oh gosh, you wouldn't have done better than that, that's for sure.
*NOR:	They do   (        ) in adult size in.
*LYN:	Hm.
*NOR:	So they choose this fabric   (        ) being the right  (        ) .
*LYN:	Hm.
*NOR:	And the same type of fabric as Anna's dress.
*LYN:	I'm sure it'll look lovely, if it, I mean if you've got grown up bridesmaid's in every one, you will expect seeing   (        )  (.) 
*NOR:	Anna actually chose the  (        ) .
*CHR:	I rather suspect that the, I even said about the strong colour of the net, I suspect, that when 
*NOR:	Trouble with it?
*CHR:	when it's a single thickness strong the colour won't be as strong as that anyway .
*NOR:	It looks   (        ) it won't show anyway .
*CHR:	No.
*NOR:	The underneath.
*CHR:	Is it, is it really just a puffer is it?
*NOR:	Veronica said if you can't get anything the right colour, get white, but white got a very starkly difference.
*LYN:	Yeah.
