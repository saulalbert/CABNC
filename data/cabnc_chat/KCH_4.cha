*DAV:	Mhm mm. •184269_184285•
        Cos Gordon wanted to go to straight through this   and the turn table. •184285_184598•

*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	What was the shape we were talking about yesterday? •186504_186733•
*DAV:	It's a triangle. •186734_186818•
*JAN:	That's right. •186819_186861•
        It's got a  curve on each end. •186862_187031•
        Yeah? •187031_187038•
        And what is the matter with that? •187064_187343•
        That's it. •187344_187508•
        And then it goes backwards. •187521_187751•
        No actually it doesn't have a curve, it is a triangle but it's got a longer base hasn't it? •187751_188125•
        It would extend so that it could just jump back. •188125_188336•
*DAV:	Right. •188386_188392•
        To there. •188440_188455•
*JAN:	Mm. •188455_188462•
*DAV:	Up to the top. •188522_188547•
*JAN:	Then you can get an engine tuned without using the turntable  these . •188547_189371•
*DAV:	Like •189371_189389•
*JAN:	Cos James is pointing, it goes backwards. •189389_189851•
        You've got engines facing in opposite directions. •189852_190349•
*DAV:	Oh. •190349_190360•
        Ha! •190360_190374•
*JAN:	 ((yawn)) 
*DAV:	I'll walk. •190375_190510•

        There's one man  I was was always good at playing with those  lost my   •194648_194989•
*JAN:	Yes . •195017_195023•
*DAV:	in an exam. •195023_195082•
*JAN:	You're nearly laughing aren't you? •195083_195218•
        Yes, that's all we ever do. •195218_195313•
*DAV:	But then when you got a the new one is that when you've got the tape recorder on you go wo ho ho ho ho ho! •195315_196064•
*JAN:	Though sometimes, when they've been smashed into  and then I have to turn the other way, they go oh! •196101_196673•
        Horror struck aren't they half the time. •196680_197167•
        Somebody asked to keep it. •197267_197582•

*DAV:	The brake van. •198907_199029•
        The face was on the other end  and it was looking really surprised. •199029_199453•
*JAN:	Yes. •199549_199563•
        What sort of face did he have then  to make it look surprised? •199563_200421•
        How did they draw a face? •200439_200671•
