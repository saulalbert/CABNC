*JAC:	Yeah. •185442_185532•
        And it's blind cause of all the bushes the other side. •187382_189732•

*TON:	Firmed up the tyres. •240902_241552•
*JAC:	Firmed up the tyres a little bit. •241552_248742•
        Oh! •248742_248782•
        It always feels very well not very slightly different to driver when you pump the tyres up. •248782_254932•
        When they needed it you know? •254932_256302•
*TON:	Hm. •256302_256472•
        Yeah. •256712_256972•
*JAC:	Cause the front tyres tend to go down more because they're carrying more weight. •259832_267152•
        They've got the engine. •267332_268182•
*TON:	Mm. •268182_268322•
