*BET:	I think it's the wet. (.) Which is Ann's?
*PAU:	You what?
*BET:	Which is Ann's 
*ANN:	Which is mine?
*BET:	without sugar?
*PAU:	The one on the  (        ) .
*BET:	That one, okay, right, oh!How long has the kettle been on?
*PAU:	It's just been  (        ) .
*BET:	Oh right.Oh might as well go and sit down then Ann, waiting for   (.) blast off! (.) 
*ANN:	Ooh!
*BET:	It is chilly, honestly and I don't want to put the heating on again.I, I'll hold it off for the   (.) I'm economizing on the 
*ANN:	Doesn't sound very hopeful.Does erm Bob er m know a lot about growing plants and things as well as vegetables?
*BET:	Oh yes, he, he 
*ANN:	I'm looking, I want somebody who knows something about gardening.I'm trying to find out why one of our azaleas has turned up its toes.
*BET:	Albert over the road will be the best one to 
*ANN:	Oh.
*BET:	tell you that, cos he was erm, erm school
*ANN:	Oh.
*BET:	grounds gardener.He 
*ANN:	I'll try 
*BET:	he would deal with shrubs more than, Bob hasn't got a, I mean he grows flowers and   (        ) 
*ANN:	I know 
*BET:	and things like that.
*ANN:	yeah.Thank you.
*BET:	Erm, but erm, I mean he nearly does know, but I mean Albert is  (.) 
*ANN:	Is it lit?
*BET:	Mm mm Albert is the gard he, you know, really good gardener.Er I mean he shows   (        ) 
*ANN:	Well they're both in tubs, they're both planted in ericaceous compost which is what we were told.
*BET:	Yeah
*ANN:	When we   (.) fed them before the winter we gave them proper er   (.) fertilizer for things that need acid soil.
*BET:	Mm mm
*ANN:	I know they can be affected by wind and frost and it turns the leaves brown and kills off the buds, but why is only one affected?And as soon as it's 
*BET:	Are they different kinds?Or 
*ANN:	No.
*BET:	are they exactly the same?
*ANN:	They're the same kind exactly but they're different colours that's all.They're both in, they're both in wooden half barrels.
*BET:	But, but don't azaleas don't azaleas shed their leaves?
*ANN:	Erm I think some do   (.) but some are evergreen and these are evergreen.
*BET:	Oh!Because I had one   (.) in the garden here and we moved it actually when we, we took the er hedge out er to put the fence and the gate on er and we moved it somewhere else and it er it just died off.Er but it used to er shed its leaves.
*ANN:	Well, yeah I think some do.
*BET:	And I think you're supposed to prune a little bit, aren't you?
*ANN:	They're not big enough to prune yet.They're, they're about er
*BET:	But should you not prune them lightly to 
*ANN:	eighteen inches.
*BET:	encourage new growth? (        ) you see 
*ANN:	No i it's er 
*BET:	Albert going past, he's back and forwards to the garden.
*ANN:	It said in the gardening book.It didn't say much about them.Really it's about, you know, huge erm rhododendrons, it's only a little bit at the end of that.But erm
*BET:	I've got a book here.
*ANN:	you know that er polythene that's got wire netting in between it like a, like a wire netting sandwich with po with clear polythene on the outside?We bent some of that round the windward side of the barrel 
*BET:	Oh right yes a sort of   (        ) 
*ANN:	and I, and tied a lump of string round it to keep it on.So it's been sheltered from the wind.
*BET:	Ooh unless the 
*ANN:	We've made sure 
*BET:	cat's done something on it.
*ANN:	Oh God, next door's cats.Er I thought I had one in the house yesterday I went, as Sheila was going erm   (.) Jackie  was in her garden
*BET:	Oh yes
*ANN:	and I was telling her that that was the daughter-in-law of Mrs  who lived there before 
*BET:	Owned the house originally.
*ANN:	Graham did
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	and er I'd left the front door and the inner door open and
*BET:	It don't switch off I'll have to go and do it.
*ANN:	oh, and er the cat was lurking around   (.) however, it had gone somewhere else. (.) I can't
*BET:	Oh gosh!I've done it full!
*ANN:	Oh never mind I'll drink half of it. (.) Yeah, azaleas.
*BET:	It's a weak one anyway, Ann.
*ANN:	It just says, where is it? [reading] Lime-free soil plus large quantities of peat or leaf mould.Some shade during the heat of the day  [] .Er it doesn't get any.Erm when the sun's at the hottest anyway it's sheltered it only gets, oh and the other thing is, you, er it, it doesn't say here but you're supposed to, it's supposed to be somewhere where they'll be sheltered from the early morning sun if there's been 
*BET:	Oh!
*ANN:	a frost.Oh we've had frost we haven't   [laughing] any early morning sun   [] anyway.Thank you.
*BET:	They said your azaleas reach five to eight feet. (.)  (        ) it doesn't say, does it?
*ANN:	I gave it some water cos I 
*BET:	They might be different types, you see.One might 
*ANN:	Yeah but 
*BET:	 (        ) you see what I mean?
*ANN:	I know it's, it's just turning up its toes.
*BET:	Oh!Dear, dear.
*ANN:	How much are car mats, Paul?
*PAU:	I think they're within the region of two quid each up to about five pound each.
*ANN:	Mm I can afford that.
*BET:	 [reading] Evergreen Azaleas.Mostly small plants three to four feet high  [] .Is that what you've got?
*ANN:	Yes they are small cos I got them 
*BET:	 [reading] Small dark green leaves,
*ANN:	to go in these half barrels 
*BET:	flowering prolifically May and June.Mostly hybrids.Forms of   (        ) azalea.Look for the   (        ) hybrid   (        ) flowering June July.Exceptionally hardy but needing shade. (        ) .
*ANN:	Well it's against the garage wall.
*BET:	Mostly very hardy, large flowers, pink   (        ) no pruning needed.Propagated by layers. (        ) 
*ANN:	It said in my book just tidy them up if you, you know, if they needed a bit of tidying up.
*BET:	 (        ) planting out   (        )  [] .No, it doesn't say any more than that.No, it doesn't say 
*ANN:	That's more or less what it said in my book except erm they need to be shaded from early morning sun if there's been a frost.Well we've had plenty of frosts but there's been no early morning sun.I know there's been wind
*BET:	Oh there's been a lot of wind   (        ) 
*ANN:	but er 
*BET:	which probably is bad as a frost.
*ANN:	Yeah
*BET:	Have you got them in separate containers?
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	Ah yes, I think you told me.
*ANN:	And the, they're beside the garage facing towards the kitchen
*BET:	Mm   (.) oh they're sheltered 
*ANN:	and the sun always comes along the side of the house.I can tell because me, me washing always blows towards the gate, to the back gate
*BET:	Mm mm
*ANN:	right?
*BET:	Mm mm
*ANN:	Erm   (.) so that must be, that's south over there isn't it?
*BET:	Mm mm
*ANN:	Well it should be a south wind, it's not even a north wind. (.) 
*BET:	That's west   (.) that's south
*ANN:	Yes, that's right.
*BET:	No
*ANN:	Hang on.
*BET:	That's west, that's east, that's north
*ANN:	Wait a minute,wh which, which direction's Scot oh me nose.
*BET:	that's south, that's south, that's south
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	that's south 
*ANN:	Well it's coming   (.) along the side of the house along there.
*BET:	Yeah, but that'll be like a tunnel, you know, when the wind's blowing because the wind hits our front 
*ANN:	Yeah 
*BET:	windows and is it the one er nearest the front that is 
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	Oh yeah, no
*ANN:	But it's only about er   (.) what's in between the two barrels?Th the,th you know that erm small cauldron with er primroses in?
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	That's all that's separating them, I mean they're close together
*BET:	Yes, but different plants respond differently to   (        ) 
*ANN:	and it's not big enough to shelter the other one and the other one looks perfectly healthy.
*BET:	Mm   (.) unless you've just got some disease.
*ANN:	Good cup of coffee that.
*BET:	Eh?
*ANN:	I said it's a good cup of coffee that.
*BET:	Oh!Thank Paul  ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Thank you Paul!
*BET:	It's the one coffee I get made per day.I get one in the morning and then at night.Well he makes tea at night.He makes a cup of tea at night and that's his effort. (.) So er Sheila  was saying that erm   (.) Andrea's in Lon er Bath.
*ANN:	Oh!
*BET:	Erm I said what's she doing she says she's gonna do archaeology.
*ANN:	Oh yes now 
*BET:	But she said she's only, she said she's twenty one and she said 
*ANN:	I think Edith 
*BET:	she's got no A levels yet.
*ANN:	Well what about erm Kathleen's Jenny is seventeen!
*BET:	I know, I know and she's coming to Newcastle
*ANN:	Yes
*BET:	erm University
*ANN:	Yeah
*BET:	cos she said she'd just bought a flat  (        ) 
*ANN:	Mhm
*BET:	she's gonna lend to them.Erm but I mean I thought Andrea was going in catering and she says well that's what we hope.We thought that would be best for her   (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh yes she was very keen wasn't she when she used to come and stay with her Grandma?
*BET:	But she says she's now wanting to do archaeology erm but she says she hasn't got any A levels!
*ANN:	You can't do that without A levels.
*BET:	So she says I don't think she's really capable of getting any.So she's just left  (        ) 
*ANN:	Yes
*BET:	Andrea
*ANN:	Yeah   (.) oh 
*BET:	So she says Graham erm forgot the name, what do they call him?
*ANN:	And Jennifer's doing er did she say history and politics?
*BET:	Oh right is she doing history and poli oh 
*ANN:	Aha, yeah 
*BET:	Erm Gillam, he's working for some er publishers in London.
*ANN:	Mm so he must be twenty
*BET:	Oh he'll be
*ANN:	four, five?
*BET:	Yes I think, cos he's through university.
*ANN:	Oh and is Ann still in Kenya?I didn't ask her any of it.
*BET:	Yeah she's in Nairobi, mhm
*ANN:	Er yes
*BET:	Nairobi and she says they come across, she comes across occasionally.They were gonna let the house.
*ANN:	Well I thought Edith said she came across at Christmas cos if you remember, we've always sent her Christmas cards to her house in, near Harrogate haven't we?
*BET:	That's right, yes, yes.
*ANN:	Well we didn't know where else to send them.
*BET:	No.Cos she said 
*ANN:	But I'm sure 
*BET:	she'd gone for a couple of days when she was up but she says she hasn't been up to see her for about eighteen months! (.)  (        ) 
*ANN:	You know when er the fir when we went up to Edith's, when she'd first moved in, for 
*BET:	Yeah 
*ANN:	coffee?
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	Didn't Edith say then that Ann came across for Christmas? (.) To be with the children, mm 
*BET:	Well that's two years ago!Isn't it?
*ANN:	Oh yes it will be.
*BET:	It it wasn't last   (        ) well, it'll be nearly two years 
*ANN:	No she's be erm Edith moved in was it January or February?
*BET:	January.
*ANN:	That's right because we got a card in the, in our Christmas card saying that they were moving back to 
*BET:	That's right.
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*BET:	Right.
*ANN:	and er they hope to be in by January the   (.) something?
*BET:	I knew it was January
*ANN:	Yeah, oh   (.) cos that's when she said Frank, Frank only came for a short while or something? ((laugh)) 
*BET:	 ((laugh)) Yes
*ANN:	So he doesn't have to pay taxes.
*BET:	I mean they must find they must find it expensive because I mean if they're keeping that house on   (.) they have to have somebody going in to look at it, won't they?And they'll have a home in Nairobi.
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	Still it must pay them, must pay them to do that.
*ANN:	Oh   (.) what's Paul doing?
*BET:	Perfectly honest I don't know he spends a lot of time   [laughing] in there  [] .
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) Oh I wa I was wa 
*BET:	I don't quite know what he does sometimes
*ANN:	I was watching for him erm I'd been to the loo and I glanced out the er landing window and I thought it looked too tall for you.I thought it was his shape moving behind your kitchen net curtain and er I thought oh I'll dash and ask him now about those car mats so I can go and get them.
*BET:	Well I, tell him what kind of car it is.
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	Erm
*ANN:	Well this is, this is why I thought perhaps erm   (.) I didn't want to ask Jim too much or he would know I was buying them for him you see.
*BET:	That's right yes.
*ANN:	And I remember this time in Winners when he, he picked them up and looked at them and said I don't think these are the right ones for my car and that, that's why I thought 
*BET:	They were too small you see, weren't they?
*ANN:	and I was thinking where on earth is there a shop in   (        ) that sells, sells things like that or do you have to go to a garage and I'd forgotten that that fruit 
*BET:	Yes 
*ANN:	shop was one now.
*BET:	Yes it's, it's very useful actually.I've been up there buying things for him in the past when he was er operating the taxi and he hadn't time to go himself.
*ANN:	Yeah
*BET:	And er if they haven't got it they'll get it for you.They're very good.
*ANN:	Mm 
*BET:	Yeah
*ANN:	You mean if they haven't got any I'll have to make a model.I bought him one Christmas years and oh hey, we were just married and I ordered him an extending ladder from the Co-op
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	and I ordered it in November, it finally came in February.So I bought 
*BET:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	him something else for Christmas, something smaller and I made him a model out of matchsticks and I said this is the prototype 
*BET:	Oh my 
*ANN:	of your Christmas present! ((laugh)) I 
*BET:	goodness!That would need some concentration 
*ANN:	I, I just sort of made erm two short ladders about two inches long.
*BET:	Oh right.
*ANN:	I think I did it with a pair of tweezers to, so I could stick the 
*BET:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	matchsticks together and then I stuck one half on top of the other to make it look like an   [laughing] extending ladder  [] .
*BET:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Yes
*BET:	When is his birthday then?
*ANN:	Er Wednesday.
*BET:	Oh right, right.So he's er an April   (.) erm birthday?
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	He's always telling me all the best people are born in April.
*BET:	Well my, my   (        ) vary.Jennifer, she was born on April Fool's Day. (.) I think that must 
*ANN:	Oh yes.
*BET:	be awful being an April Fool.
*ANN:	I'll tell you who else is the first of April as well.Mrs  at this end of the old people's bungalows.
*BET:	Oh yes!I know who you mean.I see he er the son's re er well he hasn't retired he's er given notice that he's not er going to be on the market committee now.Oh I saw your photograph in the  (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh
*BET:	Did you see it?
*ANN:	I'll tell you why he's probably not going to be on the mar market committee because his daughter had a
*BET:	Yes he said 
*ANN:	jewellery stall.
*BET:	he said there's been a lot of erm talk about his daughter and erm son-in-law having a stall and   (        ) is one of the markets where he intends to trade in and erm he thinks 
*ANN:	This is 
*BET:	that the   ((clears throat)) he'll be sort of for a right.
*ANN:	She's on the council, the town council, his daughter.
*BET:	Is she?
*ANN:	Fiona  yes.According to Jim she's never opened her mouth and said a single thing yet but er
*BET:	 ((laugh)) She turns up?
*ANN:	Yes.Well I suppose he's had a lot of flack, I mean look at the
*BET:	Well he says that 
*ANN:	everyone says if you want a council house in   (        ) you've got to 
*BET:	Well that's mentioned in the art was mentioned in the article as well 
*ANN:	you've got to join the Liberal Party and you've got to be related to Ian 
*BET:	Erm he got a lot of flack 
*ANN:	But let's face it 
*BET:	when he was on the housing erm 
*ANN:	well all his three children got houses at, at eighteen.None 
*BET:	Yes 
*ANN:	of them married
*BET:	Yeah
*ANN:	and when   (.) when this one who's got the market stall was pregnant
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	she gave up her flat and went to live with her mother.
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	When she was pregnant again, I think the father by then was divorced so she married him, she immediately got a house
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	no, she had a house to start with.When you think of all the families on the waiting list 
*BET:	I know they're waiting   ((clears throat)) 
*ANN:	and single eighteen year olds being given 
*BET:	Yeah 
*ANN:	houses it's, it's, they left themselves wide open for 
*BET:	That's right well that was 
*ANN:	people to 
*BET:	mentioned in the article as well about the housing committee 
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	in the   (        ) erm   (.) well   (        ) silly to put yourself in that predicament wouldn't it?
*ANN:	Mm
*BET:	It's mad.
*ANN:	It is.Stupid.
*BET:	I'm going   (        ) 
*ANN:	But remember when 
*BET:	this afternoon   (        ) 
*ANN:	Are you?
*BET:	I've been 
*ANN:	Oh yeah 
*BET:	we're having a salad to make.That's what he's doing in the kitchen washing the, cos Paul says if you're back late I'll be having my dinner before you come, I says okay.
*ANN:	I forgot to check wha if Jim's got a meeting tonight.If he has I've got to think of something to cook   (.) that he can finish off cooking so he can eat it before I get back from aerobics so I can stick mine   [laughing] in the microwave to warm up  [] .
*BET:	You warm it up?You warm it up?
*ANN:	Yes, I mean it 
*BET:	 (        ) mhm
*ANN:	it doesn't need to be absolutely freshly cooked.Yes.No this is why I ca I don't know if you remember, but erm she was interviewed by a reporter, Fiona  and she,i when the market traders were all on strike and you know all those months the   (        ) 
*BET:	 ((clears throat)) 
*ANN:	er and there was only the two fruit stalls there
*BET:	Yeah.
*ANN:	and occasionally the fish st well
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	yes occasionally three fruit stalls and one fish stall, she said er the market, the market hadn't ceased trading, trading, it was perfectly healthy it was doing very well!Cos I thought, I 
*BET:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	thought where have you been?I mean there had been how many?Ninety was it?
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	Sometimes a hundred.
*BET:	Mm mm
*ANN:	And er four stalls at the most there and according to her it was perfectly healthy and there was nothing wrong with it.I thought, and then I happened to go, Jim came to carry the fruit and vegetables for me and when it had opened again, and there was she with this, I looked at Jim and I said ah!That's why she said that she's got this jewellery stall.
*BET:	Oh!I didn't know what stall, type of stall she had I just read about it in the paper  (        ) 
*ANN:	I haven't had a proper look around the market for   (.) I looked 
*BET:	I went down
*ANN:	I looked at the buttons next to the fruit stall because what I usually do I go and get the fruit and vegetables, if Jim's on the right shift he takes them home, otherwise I buy them while it's quieter, the man keeps them for me, I go straight across the leisure centre to soft clay cos it's only open on Wednesdays and then on the way back one of them walks
*BET:	Oh you put them in the pram.
*ANN:	and I put the fruit and   [laughing] vegetables in the buggy   [] and we come straight home cos it's time to eat by then.
*BET:	Mm mm
*ANN:	I'll have another cigarette and then I must dash.
*BET:	Yes I'm going to the street and getting an early lunch and getting myself organized for   (.) going out.
*ANN:	What time are you to go up?
*BET:	Well half past two I usually erm
*ANN:	Dorothy was telling me   [laughing] this morning   [] you know when we were at erm nursery?
*BET:	Mm mm
*ANN:	 ((lighting cigarette))That's lit erm   (.) I heard Mrs  you've got your hands full there.Dorothy told me why.She'd er Mrs  had asked James to close the cupboard and he called her a   [laughing] stupid idiot  [] .
*BET:	Mm!
*ANN:	Yes.Oh that's gone out.
*BET:	Oh my!
*ANN:	And now Martin's taught him to call people stupid zombie so Dorothy's not pleased.
*BET:	Oh dear!He's not going to be very popular with her help at  (        ) .Oh he'll soon get out of it.I mean they, they settle down, they settle down   (        ) 
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	I mean it's good for them learning to be amongst a lot of children and they soon learn that erm they can't have their way.
*ANN:	Well her boys are quite amenable really but erm
*BET:	Bryony is the one 
*ANN:	Bryony you know
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	the tantrum screaming carries on when she doesn't want her coat on to go out.
*BET:	Yeah.I had a bit 
*ANN:	I mean 
*BET:	of that with Joshua last 
*ANN:	if she 
*BET:	week and he's got to the stage now where don't want to
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	and he starts crying if you insist erm and you have to be pretty firm with him
*ANN:	Mm mm
*BET:	and won't say anything er go away, go away 
*ANN:	Yeah Bryony went if you, well she's not so bad now she's got over that phase where she refused to have her coat on, but if you're trying to get her ready erm and she doesn't want to get ready, she'll say either go away or don't do that to me if I'm trying to get her coat on.
*BET:	 ((laugh)) Oh dear!The joys 
*ANN:	And and James sometimes says I don't want to hear that!
*BET:	 ((laugh))  (        ) 
*ANN:	Well   (.) she says it's not her and I don't remember saying that.
*BET:	Oh!Oh well, it must be you then. ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	I mean, no if he says something that I don't like I usually say oh that's not very nice is it?
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	But if er   (.) if I'm s if I say to him you're not, you're not eating properly, sit up and, you know,pu bring your plate near to you

*ANN:	Jim said that to me yesterday and I said isn't he on holiday?
*BET:	Well he seems 
*ANN:	That, that
*BET:	to be having a long holiday!
*ANN:	Jim said to me last night   (.) is er Jimmy    (.) h is he not working?
*BET:	No!I've just seen him go past.I thought, I wonder if you knew cos he's been about a lot lately.
*ANN:	I haven't noticed.
*BET:	Mm yes he's been 
*ANN:	Oh!
*BET:	going out with the dog rather than Shirley.
*ANN:	Oh. (.) I wonder if erm Shirley's sister's working because she often meets her   (.) nieces   (.) yes her nieces from school and she has her nephew with her, you know, Judith's.
*BET:	Oh!Do does her sister live here now?
*ANN:	No I
*BET:	Cos didn't she leave her husband?
*ANN:	Oh she remarried.She's 
*BET:	Oh has she remarried has she?
*ANN:	she's got, yes, have you seen her
*BET:	No I haven't 
*ANN:	eldest daughter,
*BET:	I don't know 
*ANN:	Ruth, you know the one I used to look after?Well, when she first left her husband she moved in with Shirley 
*BET:	With Shirley yes.
*ANN:	and er how did they all fit in that house?
*BET:	I don't know   ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) Cos there was Shirley and Jimmy, and Ann and Sarah, and Judith, and Ruth and Christopher, and Christopher was   (.) was Christopher nine? (.) Or was he at  road, by then?Erm Ruth was definitely at Goosehill School.She's very tall, very slim and very, very attractive.She's really pretty.
*BET:	Mm I don't know 
*ANN:	And Christ Christopher's six foot something and a very handsome young man.
*BET:	And does her sister work?
*ANN:	Well this is what I was wondering because
*BET:	Mm   (        ) 
*ANN:	because Shirley seems to have been looking after, anyway she married this   (.) Robert
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	apparently she used to go out with him before she married   (.) Derek, I think her first husband was called.And now she's got er Rona and Sophie   (.) I can't remember the boy's name.
*BET:	So she's got six children altogether?She had three to her first marriage.
*ANN:	I can't no, she's got Ruth and Christopher, Judith's the mother 
*BET:	Oh!Oh right.
*ANN:	She's got Ruth,a Shirley's Ann, to me, looks more like Judith than she looks like her mother.
*BET:	Oh right!Yes.
*ANN:	Except of course, Ann's blonde and 
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	er   (.) Shirley's black, or it was.She seems to have gone very grey very quickly.
*BET:	Oh!
*ANN:	You know, really, really quickly.
*BET:	Well I, I suppo this is her sister you're talking about?
*ANN:	Mm mm.No!Shirley herself.
*BET:	Shirley.Oh I hadn't noticed it  (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah, her sister's got slightly lighter hair than, than Shirley had.
*BET:	I do I don't know her sister much.
*ANN:	But I think they live at Pegswood.But the other thing is, Judith's husband plays   (.) in a band   (.) now   (.) I'd, I th it might be a pipe band, I'm not sure
*BET:	Oh!
*ANN:	and he travels arou they go   (.) or is it a   (        ) band? [laughing] I don't know  [] , erm but he sometimes goes abroad with it I think, but he, he goes to different parts of the country and Judith goes with him.I know erm when there was only Ruth and Christopher   (.) before Judith had Rona, they sometimes used to come and stay with Shirley.I would think it would be easier for   [laughing] Shirley to go to their house   [] to look after them now.
*BET:	I'd have thought so, yes, yeah.
*ANN:	But I think, I think 
*BET:	Does, does the boy come to this, the, the girl come to this school?
*ANN:	No, erm the little ones?
*BET:	Yes.
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	Oh and they live at Pegswood, do they?
*ANN:	Well
*BET:	I just think they might   (        ) 
*ANN:	I wonder well they did, they certainly were living in Pegswood, but I've noticed when they bring the children to school the car frequently comes along the river way.
*BET:	Oh they must live down there somewhere or maybe   (.) I mean 
*ANN:	So that to come   (.) that way
*BET:	they've gotta be, they're coming from the bottom of Bennet's Walk or from
*ANN:	Or from 
*BET:	 (        ) Courts   (        ) street 
*ANN:	or from up the hill or somewhere, yes.
*BET:	Mm
*ANN:	Or unless they come from Stobb Hill and come by the station and over the crossing.
*BET:	Well that means they've gotta come over the crossing.
*ANN:	I know but it's, it's sometimes
*BET:	Gotta be quicker!
*ANN:	it's sometimes very difficult to 
*BET:	The traffic!
*ANN:	turn into Goose Hill off erm
*BET:	That's right
*ANN:	off the main road. (.) Right, I'd better go and get ready and go and get those car mats.
*BET:	Well make sure you get the right ones.
*ANN:	I know.
*BET:	Ask, can these be changed if they're not right?
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*BET:	Keep the bill.
*ANN:	Yes.
*BET:	Keep the bill.
*ANN:	I'll take the jars.I've got some jars there's s bottles and things for the erm
*BET:	I've got milk bottles that I, you know, when I bought the odd bottle   (        ) 
*ANN:	I've still, oh 
*BET:	and I don't know wh how to get rid of them!
*ANN:	I've still got one milk bottle left.
*BET:	Well I've got three because sometimes they, they haven't got milk in the Co-op and they haven't got milk in the, in Iceland
*ANN:	Mm
*BET:	I call at Louie's and he 
*ANN:	Oh!
*BET:	had bottled milk.
*ANN:	I didn't know they sold them.
*BET:	Yes!Yes.Erm so I've bought a few bottles and I don't   (        ) 
*ANN:	Well take them, take them back.Is there a crate there or what?Take them back there.
*BET:	Oh I never thought!Yes, I never thought.That's an idea.
*ANN:	I wonder if that has, does that milkman still come round here?Has he got any   [laughing] customers left  [] ?
*BET:	I don't   (        ) I think he does, I think he comes late at night, Paul er said cos sometimes he's up watching videos or whatever
*ANN:	Oh I've heard the milkman 
*BET:	erm 
*ANN:	I've heard bottles rattling early in the morning but I, sort of one o'clock, two o'clock but I hadn't 
*BET:	cos I was sort of lying in bed sort of late 
*ANN:	noticed who it was 
*BET:	one night when Paul came up and I wasn't asleep and I saw like   (.) this bright light
*ANN:	Mm
*BET:	and Paul was coming up the stairs, I said is that the police, is that a police car?And er   (.) he said no, it'll be the milk, it's the milkman, he comes at this time.So it must be that one
*ANN:	Mm mm
*BET:	because the other chap comes about half past eight in the morning, nine o'clock.
