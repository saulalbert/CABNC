@Comment:	conversation #7 (Tape 055407)
*GIL:	No I know what you mean. (.) I've never really found it that much of an insult ever anyway, but I just think that it's a bit of a term which doesn't really apply to us.Do you know what I mean?We've got hippyish tendencies but we're not hippies.
*JEM:	Well also I mean the term hippy I mean it's not really a real term I don't think.Shall I put a bit more, do you reckon that's enough   (.) that's okay that little bit of sauce innit?Do you reckon there's enough there?
*GIL:	Is Nancy eating?
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	Er er er er er well what else could you put in that would make it more 
*JEM:	More more tomatoes and more tuna.
*GIL:	I might, I would maybe think it might be worth making a little bit more actually.
*JEM:	Right.Shove it all in.Do you wanna chop,mu mush that up a bit?
*GIL:	Okay. (.) But then I'm pretty shit at measurements and stuff   (        ) cook the dinner 
*JEM:	Well what's left I can have tomorrow. (.) Erm in that case   (.) are these, this stuff here   (.) is it yours?
*GIL:	What stuff?
*JEM:	This stuff.
*GIL:	No. (.) It might be Frank's or someone's.
*JEM:	I reckon it is.Or Na  (        ) 
*GIL:	Oh she won't mind you using it anyway.She's got so much tuna she could bloody start an aquarium up.
*JEM:	 [laughing]  (        ) tuna  [] 
*GIL:	Mind you, they're all dead so it wouldn't be a very active aquarium really would it? (.) Think the pasta's done.
*JEM:	Right do you wanna   (.) turn it off then.
*GIL:	Do you wanna taste it to check cos I might've got it wrong?No I think it's done actually, what am I talking about, I have got a brain.I can make decisions.I'm a graduate.
*JEM:	Another thing I I've realized recently right, I, I have a brain, I can make decisions, I have an opinion 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	that can be valued by people.
*GIL:	 ((laugh))  (.) I've always valued your opinion.
*JEM:	Yeah I know you have but    (.)  (        ) anyone else has.
*GIL:	Do you mean straight? ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	Yeah, yeah basically.
*GIL:	 [laughing] You know I'd never really valued the   [] the erm   (.) the truth in that term, straight heads do definitely think very differently.Andy's a real mate he   (.) just kept saying straight heads   (.) er for all the times when I might have said   (.) oh, I couldn't really talk to some people last night and he'd say what you mean straight heads? [laughing]  (        )  [] he's right. (.) Totally different wavelength man. (.) 
*JEM:	It's not just, I don't, well I d I don't think it's 
*GIL:	No it's not just straight heads but like quite a lot of the time it is straight heads.
*JEM:	I think the thing is   (        ) people who are very straight aren't likely to   (        ) people who are like very   (.) limited in their m their way of thinking.
*GIL:	Probably maybe a bit of a chicken and egg situation and the egg might have come before the chicken?
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	Yeah. ((laugh)) Funny way of putting it. [singing] Deep in my heart   (.) safe from the guards   []  (.) 
*JEM:	Is there lots of space at the table?
*GIL:	Er I can make some space, is it nearly dinner time?
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	I'll open the wine then. (.) 
*JEM:	Let the wine breathe. ((laugh))  (.) It's really funny right erm   (.) in the office today this guy Paddy   (.) got a er a an, an invitation, like a formal invitation to erm a posh do
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	and erm he, he was trying to work out how, how to write the reply correctly.And he asked this girl er
*GIL:	Can you say that again, sorry?
*JEM:	This guy Paddy in the office
*GIL:	Yeah?
*JEM:	he had an invitation to a posh do, you know a black tie type of thing?
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	A for a formal   (        ) invitation
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	and he wasn't sure like how, what was the correct way   (.) to reply to it, right?
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	And so he asked this girl Jane and, and then he asked me   (.) and erm and er had I sat down and thought about it I could have said well er what I thought, you know, the correct way er but I thought well   (.) there's correct and there's correct and I think the right way is to write to it and to say yes thanks   (        ) 
*GIL:	No there is actually a very formal way of doing it though isn't there?There's, I see what you mean, there's correct and correct.
*JEM:	Oh yeah, yeah but I, I but I just thought   (.) so I, so I, [laughing] so I, so I said to him   [] well I, if it was me I'd just write back and say thanks, yes I'll come actually, thank you very much 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	cos I thought what you talk about is such a load of bollocks and he looked at me madly, and I thought oh how funny, I thought  (        ) .I'm gonna have to start explaining myself to people a bit more actually
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	cos they get very, they misunderstand me.
*GIL:	Yeah but I mean, it doesn't really matter if they misunderstand you does it?But I mean I know what you mean.I   (        ) a lot, cos I remember erm   (.) when Claire was   (.) I got a really formal invitation to something   (.) and I asked Claire how you were supposed to reply   (.) and she told me the exact wording of how you should reply and I just looked at her   (.) I looked at her and I said I'm not bloody writing that. (.) Cos it sounded so stiff and so er
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Cheers, lovely 
*JEM:	alright? (.) 
*NAN:	Oh dear   (        ) 
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 ((laugh)) Good job     (        )  ((laugh))  (        ) 
*JEM:	I mean the whole point of it is right is it doesn't make any difference how you reply to an invitation.
*GIL:	Well I know, I mean especially if you know the people, what's the point of being formal if you know the people?
*JEM:	Exactly.
*GIL:	It's so ridiculous.
*JEM:	 (        ) with, with posh people, if th if they were being pissed off by the fact that you didn't reply to the invitation properly then he's a dickhead. (        ) 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEM:	people. (.) 
*GIL:	Did you even try? (.) Did you even try to get it out or did you just think oh well? (.) 
*NAN:	 (        )  (.)  ((music))
*GIL:	Oh what!That wasn't doing what I was asking it to do. (.) I wanted it to forward wind, I think I pressed the wrong button. (.) I've got   (.) I did have the other one, Crossroads, but the reason why I had it was because Dave was in the house and he had it. ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	Right, right, yeah.
*GIL:	And then he fucked off and left me and he didn't give me   (.) I di this, it really pisses me off the way that people like leave before you get round to taping the tapes that you liked, do you know what I mean? [mimicking] D'ya know what I mean  [] ? (.) 
*NAN:	I know what you mean, yeah.
*GIL:	Now I wonder if this is doing what it's supposed to do, let's have a check. (.)

*GIL:	Yeah it's also the fact that they didn't have a job or anything and they had the daytime to potter about, do you know what I mean?

*GIL:	So what they're now saying that you've got to 
*NAN:	Well they want me to pay   (.) three days until she moved in.
*GIL:	 [laughing] Ah ha you're joking  [] ?

*GIL:	That is just stupid isn't it?It'll be about three pounds or something.
*NAN:	Exactly.
*GIL:	Or it'll be about twenty quid or something.
*JEM:	 (        ) cos the amount of m m time well, and the   (        )

*NAN:	I know.
*GIL:	just stupid, you should say that to them, make them feel really stupid.

*JEM:	And also there's a, bloody hell 
*NAN:	It's so bur it's so bureaucratic.
*JEM:	it's a, it's for the students for God's sake, I mean they shouldn't be making like more hassles. (.) 
*NAN:	They are basically real   (        ) 
*GIL:	This is what pisses me off so often you know, things like the halls of residence and stuff are there to help the students and they don't, they just try and rip them off for every cent they can do it for.
*NAN:	Yeah.They er I mean in, in Handsworth right, on this bottom corridor, the boys' bottom corridor, it is in such a bad way you know like they keep erm   (.) like   [laughing] putting their fists through windows   [] and things like that, and the amount of repairs and fining.Like th what they did one time they all had erm
*GIL:	What just cos they're all yobs?
*NAN:	Yeah.They all had something one night and erm   (.) er
*GIL:	I wouldn't bother Nance we're all gonna get 
*NAN:	a vegetable   ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	done anyway. ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	 [laughing] a nice vegetable  [] 
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) Yeah, was it fungus by any chance?

*NAN:	Mm I'd like half.
*JEM:	it's not er it's not all horrible.It's nice and   (        ) 
*NAN:	Anyway yeah they had this, this fungus and erm   (.) they, they kicked down a door and erm got extremely, extremely energetic and like   (.) put like erm   (.) er er er in this store, it was a storeroom and they'd put things like the projectors and erm   (.) er catering equipment 
*GIL:	And in this door was what?
*NAN:	In this store  (.) 
*GIL:	Oh yeah?
*NAN:	It was a door to a storeroom and inside this store there was all video equipment, catering equipment
*GIL:	Oh dear.
*NAN:	and they put it in the sinks and   [laughing] baths   [] all round the hall
*GIL:	And turned taps on?
*NAN:	No they didn't turn the taps on, they just left it all round the hall and, and the door frame had been kicked off and all things like this you know?
*GIL:	Oh dear.Did they get caught? ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	Well the people that done it didn't get caught but   (.) the corridor on which it happened was fined for all the equipment.
*JEM:	Oh!
*NAN:	A lot of money.
*GIL:	So did the people on the corridor know who it was?
*NAN:	Yeah.
*GIL:	Only they, they, they must be f mad with them.
*NAN:	Yeah.They're obviously not gonna say anything but they are very mad. (.) 
*GIL:	They should get them to pay for it.
*NAN:	I know.Well I think they are going to, the people that did it tt are gonna pay for it anon er anonymously
*GIL:	Yeah.
*NAN:	via the er   (.) hall inhabitants, you know, that cannot afford it.
*GIL:	Yeah.So at least they won't get done for it cos they'd probably go up to disciplinary and stuff wouldn't they?
*NAN:	 (        ) that on?
*JEM:	Mm.
*GIL:	Erm   (.) lordy lordy.I remember that we, we had erm a corridor fine in our hall   (.) for er just something stupid like they   (.) one of the ceiling tiles got broken or something. (.) But we w did you have to pay a deposit? (.) It came out of our deposit.
*NAN:	 (        ) we did, fifty pounds.
*GIL:	Mm.
*NAN:	That's true. (.) I should get that back shouldn't I?
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) 
*NAN:	Mm there's no reason why I shouldn't get that deposit back.
*GIL:	No.
*NAN:	Because last   (        ) 
*GIL:	And that's why they've mentioned it isn't it?
*NAN:	Yeah.
*GIL:	Cos with us getting it back was automatic.I think   [laughing] you were in a shitty hall Nance  [] .
*NAN:	I know. (        ) 
*GIL:	What, what happened about your posters?They just walked in and saw that you had posters up and
*NAN:	Yeah the cleaners, you know the cleaners have got a key to your room and that   (.) and you   (        ) 
*GIL:	What cos you'd used Blu Tak or something?
*NAN:	Yeah.Oh basically you weren't allowed anything up on any wall.
*JEM:	Well we weren't supposed to have posters up in our hall either.
*GIL:	Really!
*JEM:	Mm. (.) 
*NAN:	And erm y every time the cleaners came round on a Tuesday   (.) it's not ev er everything had to be on the bed, including chairs er everything, you know, you had to have your desk   (        ) 
*GIL:	 [laughing] My cleaner used to come in and I'd be in bed  [] .And she used to clean round me and stuff.
*NAN:	Cos our cleaners won't clean if it's erm   (.) occupied or   (.) not everything is cleaned from the floor   (.) they won't change the bed sheets unless you've actually taken them off and   (        ) 
*GIL:	We're, oh no we didn't, they didn't do that for us either.
*JEM:	Well we we had that.We had to erm   (.) like have, you wouldn't, you wouldn't 
*GIL:	No   (        ) 
*JEM:	wouldn't get bed sheets unless they were actually stripped off the bed, things like that.
*NAN:	Mm.
*GIL:	But I, I, me and Claire, by the time we left U H, had a store of bed sheets to bring to our new house.Just because like they'd leave them for us and we hadn't changed them. (.) And we'd just shove them on, under the bed and stuff.I had thousands, I mean I gave a load back cos I had loads of them.And the reason why   [laughing] they were shoved under the bed was because   [] I hadn't got round to sort of you know, doing anything about it sort of thing.
*JEM:	Mm.Mm.
*GIL:	But I mean my cleaner used to come in and just sort of like   (.) clean around me and chat a bit. (.) Dave's cleaner in High Hall used to do loads of stuff for him, she used to wash his mugs up and all sorts of things.
*NAN:	Mm.Mm.They do in the self catering flats.But erm  (.) 
*GIL:	I'm gonna try a bit of your bread.
*NAN:	they're really funny and finicky about a lot of things, you know? (.) It does my head in.And basically they ha and the other thing, right, I found out what they had for dinner the other night right? (.) We had jacket potatoes right, which is literally mouldy and baked hard so you'd get about   (.) out of a jacket potato you'd probably get about that much potato and the rest is just skin and mould and hardness   (.) quiche which is just like processed cheese and processed eggs and everything you can imagine just total packet mix
*GIL:	Mm.
*NAN:	it tastes like blancmange rather than quiche
*JEM:	Mm.
*NAN:	and erm   (.) salad which is just like   (.) brown lettuce. (.) And y and I was paying eighteen pounds a week to be catered for.
*GIL:	Wh why doesn't someone do anything about it? (.) 
*NAN:	Apparently   (        ) 
*GIL:	Like take it to N U S or something.
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	Because that is just a pile of shit 
*NAN:	We're not even 
*GIL:	they're ripping everybody off in that hall.
*NAN:	we're not even in it, we've de-affiliated from erm
*GIL:	Oh that's, that's why it's in that, basically that's why
*NAN:	Oh
*GIL:	people, that's why erm N U S is there to protect man.
*NAN:	And nobody   (.) Handsworth is   (.) in a funny neck of the woods basically, it's like off campus, it's university accommodation
*GIL:	Miles away.
*NAN:	miles away, off campus, you know, they haven't got to make it look good 
*JEM:	So you haven't got, you haven't got any any back up kind of from the 
*NAN:	No 
*JEM:	campus, the whole campus feeling I guess is   (        ) 
*NAN:	Yeah, yeah.
*JEM:	Mm.
*NAN:	It is, it's sort of like   (.) it's sort of like extradited from the rest of the er   (.) the rest of the whole university, you know, nobody really cares about what goes on at Handsworth. (.) But it's like wherever I, you know, if you get    (.)  (        ) a halls of residence on campus you would get put in Handsworth, like if you chuck a telly out of the, like one   (        ) 
*GIL:	 [laughing] It's like a prison isn't it  [] ?
*NAN:	Yeah.It's like, you know  (.) 
*GIL:	Or a rehabilitation centre. ((laugh)) 
*NAN:	Yeah.But it hasn't got anything going for it, basically, whatsoever
*GIL:	Mm.
*NAN:	it's got   (.) three TVs though which are really rubbish and one small bar called The Bin, Village Inn it's called, and it is absolutely tiny, and really crap.
*GIL:	Mm.
*NAN:	Very expensive as well.It's more expensive than on campus, I mean we haven't got a pub there, we haven't got   (.) like the Guild bars or anything like that.
*GIL:	It's worse than being on Griffin Close.
*NAN:	Because there's no erm, there's no   (.) like for freshers there wasn't any sort of entertainments during freshers' week on at Handsworth, it was all at campus.
*GIL:	Mm. (.) So how, how do you get in to campus then?Do you, is there one bus that goes all the way in?

*NAN:	The whole university is.
*GIL:	When did they do that?Do you know? (.) 
*NAN:	Last year I think, (        )

*GIL:	th no you can, but all student cards and stuff are all negotiated by N U S.
*NAN:	I know.And the N U S, you know   (.) it is, in a way it is a good thing but in a way it isn't because when they were actual when they actually belonged to the N U S erm   (.) they weren't get because it's a small university, they weren't getting much funding from the US er the N U S or erm any support really.I mean it's just like   (.) Aston is, it is, is, it's, it's a university but it hasn't been a university for that long, it was a technological institute before 
*GIL:	Mm.

*GIL:	So they don't really know how it runs do they?
*NAN:	No.They don't know how it's gonna work.I mean it   (.) I mean er the reason why it was set up really was the nineteen ninety two sort of like coming into the single European market and everything 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*NAN:	that's what gave them the sort of, the idea to set it up but   (.) I mean Aston is good because   (.) now we're    (        )  (.) n now we're not
