*ALI:	St Lucia St Lucia. •_•
*BOB:	Yeah. •_•
*ALI:	When Raymond came and did the windows last week, he said he'd booked up  I   •_•
*GRA:	I've got  •_•
*ALI:	the same time as we go to Cyprus and he hasn't actually booked a flight yet but he's got the villa cos Aily a few doors along, remember she's got a villa in erm •_•
*BOB:	Aye, •_•
*ALI:	it's near, it's near Orlando. •_•
        What? •_•
*BOB:	Is it her villa he cleans her windows? •_•
*GRA:	My horse! •_•
*ALI:	Yes, he cleans her windows as well. •_•
        Her name's Ann •_•
*GRA:	Dad! •_•
*ALI:	because he mentioned and I said is that the lady that lives in America? •_•
*GRA:	My horse ran away! •_•
*BOB:	Mummy's speaking   •_•
*GRA:	My horse ran away so I got away. •_•
*ALI:	Remember last year when they went to America  •_•
*BOB:	So the  again last year, were they? •_•
*ALI:	Slightly younger than me erm, no, but he'd mentioned that and he said erm •_•
*BOB:	 (        ) 
*ALI:	if he wanted to book again that she could let her, his, her villa. •_•
        So it's free for October, the complete month of October and erm he hasn't booked a flight yet because the fares are so expensive. •_•
*BOB:	Did he tell you how much they charge? •_•
*ALI:	Yes. •_•
        The last time you saw Raymond, remember he said it was erm, how much further. •_•
        I think there's gonna be six this time. •_•
        There's Raymond and his wife and his wife Sherry's I think brother and his wife and little baby and then somebody else. •_•
        So there'll be six people. •_•
        So they've got to book the flight but they might book it nearer the time when hopefully they'll get a cheaper flight. •_•
        He's tried direct flights and so on but he thought four hundred pounds, four hundred and fifty was a bit much although he'll get the villa so cheaply. •_•
*BOB:	Yeah. •_•
*ALI:	So he goes in October  you went and er same time as us  •_•
*BOB:	Quiet, Annabel  •_•
*ALI:	September the thirtieth, first two weeks in October, Bobby. •_•
        First two weeks in October. •_•
*BOB:	 (        ) 
*ALI:	But, that's what he wants just now but if he can get the flight then it, it could end up being the second and third or the third and fourth week. •_•
        But Ann says it's free the whole month  •_•
*BOB:	 (        ) 
*ALI:	well he can't cos he's self-employed. •_•
