        With all the greenhouse effect and everything. •170362_172432•

*SUS:	Anyway they're nice old bales though, I wouldn't mind a few of them. •570442_574392•
        Well I was looking out the other side cos I was trying to work out where Glynis lived. •575052_579482•
*CAR:	You were looking at the lambs. •579482_581432•
        We didn't come this way, Glynis doesn't  •581432_583062•
*SUS:	Oh that's right. •583072_583382•
*CAR:	live along this side. •583732_584312•

*CAR:	So you're not even in the right place. •585352_587122•
*SUS:	That explains why I couldn't see where she lived. •587232_590132•
*CAR:	That's correct. •590132_591452•
*SUS:	That's quite nice  tiles again though. •591452_596782•
*CAR:	Yeah, nice house. •596782_599122•
*SUS:	It makes you think of summer dunnit? •599122_604962•
        You know you look out and see the sunshine and the illusion of warmth  cos you're, we're in the car. •604962_609802•
*CAR:	It's warm in the car. •609892_610922•
*SUS:	Yeah. •610922_610982•
        Be nice in the summer and just put  instead of doing her up in all these great big snowsuits, you know? •611632_620802•
*CAR:	Yeah. •621112_621182•

*CAR:	Yeah. •626632_626932•
*SUS:	And sandals  and no socks, that'll be lovely. •626932_631062•
        I hope by then that I'll have her, you know, that she'll be dry. •631062_636032•
        In fact I had thought once she gets over this erm tooth coming through  that I might erm start trying to potty train her. •636082_695902•
*CAR:	Mhm. •695922_696042•
*SUS:	See if she's interested, you know, to see if she's ready. •696042_700502•

*CAR:	Yeah? •711942_712032•
        Good idea. •712032_712962•
*SUS:	I ought to start, really  really and truly I ought to start buying them in now in sort of double, double packs, you know, get two  cos they're expensive to buy. •714882_724442•
        Sort of three pounds for a couple of little, little pairs of knickers and that and that's a lot when you think they  when she first starts she's gonna be getting through seven or eight  pairs a day . •726582_735552•
*CAR:	I know. •735552_735772•
*SUS:	You know, you, you sort of think well   have to have plenty in. •735772_774482•
        I've got some up in the suitcase which I can use but  Oh I, I'll have a look. •774482_777302•
        I, I still like the Ladybird ones best, they wash nice. •777302_793242•

*CAR:	 (        ) 
*SUS:	we can't afford it now . •885662_888232•
        Never mind. •888232_888432•
        Maybe we should earmark  perhaps my birthday, to go out. •888432_899092•
        Arrange it in advance you know? •899342_902722•
*CAR:	Mm. •904132_904202•
        I don't like the thought of anybody else  come to babysit though personally. •904202_908042•
*SUS:	No  but •908202_909222•
*CAR:	I know people keep saying oh we'll do it for you but  •909222_911562•
*SUS:	We'll do it,yeah I know. •911562_912282•

*CAR:	Yeah. •917502_917602•
*SUS:	and do it that way. •917602_919132•
        I don't know what day my birthday's on this year. •919502_921172•
        Oh it's still Christopher's birthday anyway  didn't mean to start talking about mine, only as a means for having a meal out. •921382_927522•
*CAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*CAR:	Oh whee! •927522_928092•
*UNK:	 ((cough)) 
*SUS:	Mind if he's coughing like that  erm  don't know. •942882_949562•
        Don't suppose I'd get in the surgery tomorrow now. •949572_956852•
        If it's just a cough to go with the cold then there's nothing they can do anyway, but if it's an asthmatic cough then I can give him some erm  Ventolin. •956852_968242•
*CAR:	That's what he's had before. •968582_975632•
*SUS:	He is wheezier but  •975632_980252•
*CAR:	He's had it for a week. •980252_987662•
*SUS:	Mind I hadn't noticed. •987662_991962•
        I must be a terrible mother, I just haven't noticed. •991972_995102•
*CAR:	You're used to it. •995112_997092•
*SUS:	Well  He doesn't get them quite as frequently now though as he did. •997092_100381•
*CAR:	No. •100381_100387•
*SUS:	Not quite cos I mean at one time, when he was Christopher's age  god he was never free from cold was he? •100397_100991•
        We'd have a respite of about a fortnight if we were lucky before he went down with the next one. •100997_101462•
*CAR:	Yeah  •101464_101488•
*SUS:	In fact I remember I took him out of school for nearly three weeks to try and  •101488_101875•
*CAR:	Get rid of  the  •101878_102037•
*SUS:	get his health  yeah  •102045_102113•
*CAR:	bronchial infection that he had. •102126_102226•
*SUS:	Yeah, that's right. •102226_102323•
        And also because I didn't think they were doing that much there with him anyway. •102324_102986•
        I reckon he learnt more in that three weeks at home than he ever did there. •102986_103384•
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*SUS:	Yeah. •103384_103404•
        ring up  make an appointment for Dr . •103404_104091•
        He's sometimes easier to get into. •104137_104342•
        Chris hasn't been too bad though, his ears have been reasonable. •104342_105524•
*CAR:	Is he still on medicine or not? •105546_105829•
*SUS:	Well it's there. •105829_105963•
        I stopped, I stopped using it, I must admit. •105964_106166•
*CAR:	Why? •106183_106199•
*SUS:	Well it made him drowsy for one thing, it kept knocking him out. •106199_106947•
        And er  he could hear me perfectly well. •107036_107097•
        I thought well it's there for next time. •107097_107282•
        Soon as there's any  slightest hint of hearing loss I can  . •107282_108066•
        In a way though, perverse though it sounds, I'd rather let it get fairly bad and take him back •108356_109160•
*CAR:	Mhm. •109171_109177•
*SUS:	because it's only by that way that  if, if he's gonna need the grommets or something in his ear  then he really needs to get it sorted out this year. •109184_110272•
*CAR:	Yeah. •110284_110294•
*SUS:	I don't want him to start in the January and then have to be off school for three weeks because  •110294_110827•
*CAR:	Mm. •110827_110848•
*SUS:	he's got to go to hospital to have his ears done and things like this, you know? •110867_111154•
        If it's gonna plague him and give him trouble let's get it sorted out this year, even if it means that he has a little bit of temporary deafness  for a little while, you know? •111277_113869•
        Oh dear   •114341_114918•

*SUS:	That's the Mercury. •118718_118801•
        It's a nice theatre that. •118802_118998•
        What was here before they put these up Carl? •118998_120276•
        I can't remember, or was it just  a bit of ground? •120280_121624•
*CAR:	Mm. •121624_121637•
*SUS:	Wonder if Tamsin had any luck selling her house. •121637_122774•
*ROB:	What I don't understand  is when erm  she jumped into the beauty parlour door, how did erm  change so quickly? •122808_123458•

*CAR:	It was somebody else Robert who was in there already. •123753_124265•
*ROB:	Oh. •124265_124280•
*SUS:	Yeah it's all  all very clever. •124280_124465•
        Yes it's what pantomime's all about. •124632_125388•
        Thinking on your feet, improvisation. •125388_125650•
        It's great. •125655_125851•
        I enjoyed doing pantomime. •125959_126149•
        Oh I wasn't a very convincing Prince Charming though,don't think I'd do it again . •126149_127145•

*CAR:	Not the same as putting on a big performance though is it? •129806_130157•
*SUS:	No it's a bit different. •130169_130274•
        When you put the  and that's the difference about drama at college is you're doing it to please yourself  and the, the group that you're in with and  ultimately I suppose your tutor  but when you do something like a pantomime when you're doing it to please the punters  •130274_131906•
