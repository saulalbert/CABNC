        Look you can see it's all brown. •516775_518655•
        Ugh. •518655_518725•
        If we just wipe round the outside of the tank though, I think that will help. •518725_524405•
        Cos it's gone all funny inside, can you see? •524405_536115•
*TIM:	Yeah. •537645_537795•

*CHR:	Ugh. •541915_542035•
*DOR:	I think it's the kind of food we're using cos it's different food from the  food that we had at the beginning. •542035_552455•
        It didn't seem to get as bad as this at the beginning. •552455_554335•
*CHR:	Why didn't it seem to get as bad as this? •554335_559015•
*DOR:	I don't know. •559125_560315•
        It just did n't. •560325_563735•
*CHR:	Is it because mummy •565955_567885•
*DOR:	Pardon? •568715_569105•
*CHR:	Is it because we've given them a different  have we already used a pot up? •569105_575125•
*DOR:	Yes we used the little pot and then we bought that box. •575295_577775•
*TIM:	Mummy. •577775_577935•
*DOR:	Hello. •577935_578395•
*CHR:	Where's the little pot mummy? •578915_581875•
*DOR:	What's your problem? •581905_583045•
        You alright? •583045_583425•
*TIM:	I wanted to put water in there. •584795_585905•
*DOR:	You want to put water in? •585905_587795•
        Well we'll just give them one more swish. •587795_589045•
*TIM:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Little pot mum. •589045_590245•
*DOR:	What little pot? •590245_593115•
        The fish food you mean? •597085_599115•
        Well the thing was, because we bought a box and the box  was a bit flimsy, I thought we would put the new fish food into the old pot, you see. •599115_607295•
        So the old pot has still got some in  but it's really the new food. •607545_611345•
        Do you see? •611345_612625•
*CHR:	Why didn't you keep it in the box? •612625_618175•
*DOR:	There's still some food in there as well. •618255_622905•
        Right, okay. •623105_623445•
        If you want to put your jug of water in now, this is your moment. •623995_626525•
        Do you want to get a jug  full. •626525_627615•
        Do you want to get some from the tap? •627615_630565•
*CHR:	Why? •630565_630645•
*DOR:	You can if you want to. •630645_631915•
        Because it'll probably need more than what's in the bucket anyway. •631915_634875•
