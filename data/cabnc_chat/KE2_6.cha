*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	If I could erm   (.) only remember which booklet it was. (.) Erm   (.) That pa that page   (.) or was it?No, perhaps it wasn't a booklet.Perhaps it wasn't a booklet. (.) I'm just wondering why, cos someone's been dealing with that
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	just this week. (.) No!I can't, I'll have to find it some other time but er   (.) right yellow book two, let's have a look yellow book two. (.) No!I'll leave it.

*ADR:	Do you wanna do some   (.) erm 
*TER:	Have you done that booklet?
*ADR:	booklet?This bo , I haven't finished it.
*TER:	Erm you, have you done any on it?
*ADR:	Yes.
*TER:	Right, let's mark what you've done.
*ADR:	That goes with that.
*TER:	You do this in your school book do you?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Right, that's right. (.) That's right.
*ADR:	Shall I tick it?
*TER:	Can do if you want.That's right.
*ADR:	Is this all right?
*TER:	Well er yes, A five is on   (.) the answer is on the erm   (.) back cover of your book.
*ADR:	Is A four alright?
*TER:	A four's alright, yeah.Now loo , look on the, no no, wait a moment!Look on the back cover of your booklet   (.) inside the back cover. (.) Right, that's alright. (.) They're alright. (.) That's right.Right.Right. (.) Right.Right.Right.Right.Right.Right.Right.
*ADR:	Are they all right?
*TER:	Mhm.Right.
*ADR:	Shall we co continue with that or do you want
*TER:	You can do if you want.Is that   (.) but you're doing that at school are you as well?
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Right okay.So B six.Er, (        ) one to mark here.
*ADR:	Yep.This one.
*TER:	Well, I think perhaps   (.) what we'll do cos you've missed quite a few of these out so I think what we'll do   (.) erm is to   (.) leave that   (.) what you're doing there for a moment   (.) we'll go through this   (.) mark this   (.) and the one's you haven't done we'll do   (.) so that you've got this one straight.Okay?
*ADR:	Okay. (.) There's only one I didn't do.That one.
*TER:	Oh yes!So there is.Well, well anyway we'll do do that and see   (.) see what the other's like. (.) You've been caught! (.) Right!This one   (.) posts are erected at a hundred metre intervals on a motorway, how many posts are there in a distance of four thousand seven hundred kilometres?
*ADR:	Twenty seven.
*TER:	No.As I say, you have been caught   (.) in a little trap!Posts are erected
*ADR:	Forty sev six posts.
*TER:	posts are erected every hundred metres, right?
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	There's a hundred metres   (.) there's two hundred metres   (.) there's three hundred metres   (.) how many posts in three hundred metres?
*ADR:	Four.Sorry!
*TER:	Mm.
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Right.Because at no metres there's one post   (.) and at the end of a hundred metres you've got   (.) two posts   (.) so you got one post more
*ADR:	So it must be forty six.
*TER:	 (        ) distance.
*ADR:	That's what I say, forty eight.
*TER:	Forty eight   (.) right!Got it?Always 
*ADR:	Okay.
*TER:	be wary of that.And the same thing applies   (.) posts are a hundred metres apart.
*ADR:	Mm.
*TER:	If you are at the fifth post   (.) how far have you gone from the start?
*ADR:	Six hundred metres.
*TER:	How far have you gone from the start?
*ADR:	Four hundred.
*TER:	Right!Fifth post, one, two, three, four, five   (.) the fifth post   (.) you have gone four hundred metres.
*ADR:	Oh.
*TER:	So   (.) wherever you get that sort of question   (.) just stop and think
*ADR:	Okay.
*TER:	because it's either one more or it's one less.The only   (.) time   (.) that that doesn't apply   (.) is if you are thinking in terms of posts in a fence around a square field or round a circular field.
*ADR:	Okay.
*TER:	Because now   (.) after one hundred metres you've got two posts   (.) after two hundred metres you've got three posts, after three hundred metres you got four posts, after four hundred metres you've got five posts   (.) but after you've five hundred metres you've only got five posts cos that one doubles up.
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	So you got one, two, three, four, five spaces and you got one, two, three, four, five, posts
*ADR:	Mhm.
*TER:	but on a straight line   (.) your 
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	spaces are one less than the number of posts.Alright?
*ADR:	Okay.
*TER:	So   (.) just remember that.That's why I said you have been caught!That's a ste , one of those little trap questions.
*ADR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Now this one, four hedges together have a mass of two hundred grams   (.) how many have a mass of two and ha ?
