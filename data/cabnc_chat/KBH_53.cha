*CAR:	So what, what you do, what sort of type of things did you get? •341932_348382•
*ADA:	, in the picture it's really , it looks more like a jacket rather than a blouse. •349022_355412•
*CAR:	Oh right. •356512_356872•
*ADA:	But, erm, I mean all the fabric we went to get, they just cotton and erm •357172_365812•

*CAR:	Oh. •389062_389142•
*ADA:	But I mean the style of it is obviously jacketed person, blousey, cos it's  collar and she's got three buttons at the front and it's fitted as a jacket as opposed to a tuck in a blouse. •389982_408052•
*CAR:	Oh right. •408052_409282•

        Wear it as a skirt as a jacket  blouse. •425272_427202•

        Well, she  her, her sleeping habits during the day change to afternoons, and, well today she's been she had about two hours this afternoon, so if we did our normal and gave her tea at five o'clock, and send them up for a bath at half past six, there's no way she'd be asleep. •653922_675802•
*ADA:	No. •677382_677442•
*CAR:	So we sort of switched all around now, so she eats with us at half past six stroke seven, goes up for a bath at seven thirty,eight o'clock and she's in bed by nine, then she, she's usually asleep by half past ten, but eh, it seems to have cured the problem we had with her , wanting, wanting me all the time, after she's gone to bed. •677442_706672•

*ADA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	Well this one seems to go to bed a bit later now, so she goes longer, but she's feeding all day today,, I'm at  every couple of hours, so with a bit of luck, I'll finally put her to bed maybe half past nine ten o'clock, she might go through till three or four, which isn't bad. •713662_740772•
*ADA:	No. •743542_743612•
*CAR:	It's usually half past nine till, I wasn't so good last night, she went until two, but then she didn't wake up again until seven. •744552_761682•
