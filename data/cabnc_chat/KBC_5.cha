*ELA:	I know what i i  (.)  ((sigh))  (.) I suppose it is a good case though.And close to the end a few people that were hanged a are innocent.But I think if you did bring back hanging it'd cut out some of these flaming crimes.
*AUD:	I do as well.
*ELA:	You know, I mean, for all the 
*GOR:	Well there should be some 
*ELA:	if 
*GOR:	degrees of it shouldn't there?

*AUD:	Yeah but if you're one of the innocent ones.
*ELA:	I know, I said that to Kevin, if you're part of the family 
*AUD:	Yeah.
*ELA:	of the innocent 
*AUD:	It's 
*ELA:	one.
*AUD:	very difficult.It was funny case though Hanratty weren't it?Because sh I mean she was a eye witness and she picked him out.
