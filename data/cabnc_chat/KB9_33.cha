        And it'll be in the post today. •_•
        post . •_•
        No, no doubt about it. •_•
        And he said he's telling him point blank that he's, if there's any problems with invoices or anything, you have to deal with Andrew, he has to come back to me and deal with me direct! •_•
*ANN:	So  he's realized how long you've been waiting? •_•
*TRA:	Yeah. •_•
        And he said, it's not on, he said what he, he said er  getting the money he said we've got a lot of money in American bank and he said and getting that back it's just a pain in the arse! •_•
        It's a bloody nuisance! •_•
        And it's not often Michael swears. •_•
        And, he said it's a bloody nuisance! •_•
        He said, but he said it doesn't give us the excuse of not paying the invoices on time, and he said  erm  I have warned him for it this morning and he said he will process it, and he said the cheque will be in the post here on Monday. •_•
*ANN:	Well he told you twenty four hours didn't he? •_•
        Forty eight hours. •_•

        And he said, I do apologize, he said, for the mucking about, he said we want to work with our sub-contractors very, very, closely and have a good er relationship with them for ongoing work and stuff like that. •_•
        And he said I agree with what you say, it's not the principle of, of making everybody wait like that. •_•
*ANN:	No. •_•
