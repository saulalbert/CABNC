*AND:	Has it been alright today? 
*DOR:	It's been comparatively peaceful today. 
*AND:	Good.  When did everybody get up? 
*CHR:	 Mum could you cut my  meat? 
*DOR:	They all  sort of surfaced   
*AND:	 You were all asleep  when I er 
*DOR:	I think I'd   (.) had I finished my breakfast when, no   (.) I think you just came just as I was about to take my first mouthful of cereal. It was about quarter to eight before everybody, well   (.)  after that   
*CHR:	 No but it  wasn't. 
*DOR:	What time did you get up?  (.) What time did you go? 
*AND:	I left at twenty to eight. 
*DOR:	Mm. It was about   (.) ten to eight   ((eating)) when Christopher got up.  (.) But Tim was still asleep   (.) till about quarter past eight . 
*AND:	Oh. 
*TIM:	And I shouted for daddy. 
*AND:	 Did you? 
*DOR:	 Which is  unheard of. Yes you did  shout for daddy. 
*AND:	 You shouted for  daddy? I was already at work. 
*DOR:	There was no daddy. He'd gone to work already.  (.) So then we had a bit of a wonder whether or not Christopher should go to school. And I decided he was, should stay at home. (.)  
*AND:	It's probably just as well cos 
*DOR:	Mm. 
*AND:	pool his strength for tomorrow. 
*DOR:	He was a bit sort of wobbly on his legs at the beginning of the day  but he's been   
*CHR:	 Yeah. 
*DOR:	 fine since. 
*AND:	 And Tim's going to   
*DOR:	Nursery. 
*AND:	Holly Cottage tomorrow. Aren't you? (.)  
*TIM:	Ow. Where    (  )  (.) Look I found a yellow  (  ) . 
*DOR:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	We did go down to the library. Cos I thought it would, it was such a warm day I thought it would be quite nice for him to have a walk   (.) see if he   (.) was alright. Anyway managed to walk to the library and walk down the shops  (  ) . But when we got back we had to lie down in front of the video for a bit. ((laugh))  
*TIM:	Mum  (  )  
*CHR:	Mum, can I   (  ) for a minute please. 
*DOR:	Mhm. 
*AND:	So you just did your own private trip to the library  (  ) ? 
*DOR:	Yeah I rang up and said I wasn't gonna go    (.)  (  ) the children. Anyway it turned out we met Ann and   (.) erm both Martin and Ian are   (.) been having a similar trauma. 
*AND:	Have they? 
*DOR:	Mm. 
*AND:	Oh. 
*DOR:	Ian's been sort of talking about all sorts of strange things in his sleep and 
*AND:	Really? 
*DOR:	delirious and hot   (.) hot 
*AND:	Yes. 
*DOR:	 (  ) fever.  (.) So 
*AND:	It's odd. A bug they're passing around. 
*DOR:	Mm. Must be. 
*AND:	Child to child. 
*DOR:	And she said Martin was hot but nothing too traumatic. A bit like these two really. 
*AND:	Mm. (.)  
*DOR:	But Ian had been sick as well. (.)  
*AND:	So it's likely they picked it up from them. 
*DOR:	I should think so. Although Christopher didn't really see much of them did he? Oh he did on Thursday didn't he? 
*AND:	Mm. 
*DOR:	I would have thought Tim would have had it worse from   (.) contact erm wise.  (.) These things don't work like that do they? 
*AND:	No.  (.) And is the parentage alright? 
*DOR:	Mm. (.)  
*AND:	Only strikes children. 
*DOR:	Yeah. Well it certainly did   (.) in both these cases.  (.) Although I met Theresa on the way back from erm   (.) school and she said Alec was at the doctors cos   (.) not the way back from school, way back from the library. And she said Alec was at the doctors cos he was feeling   (.) under the weather. 
*AND:	Yeah. 
*DOR:	So I don't know what that's in aid of. (.)  
*AND:	Julia   (  ) ill  so she   
*DOR:	 Was she? 
*AND:	won't be at work tomorrow. 
*DOR:	Oh dear. What's the matter with her? 
*AND:	  (  )  
*TIM:	 I don't want the meat. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) What's the matter with her? 
*AND:	Sore throat. 
*TIM:	I don't want the meat. 
*DOR:	You don't want the meat? 
*TIM:	No. 
*DOR:	You usually like meat. 
*AND:	It probably needs chopping up. 
*DOR:	Mm. Let's chop it for you. 
*TIM:	No I don't want it chopped. 
*DOR:	Tim listen.  I'm going to chop you   
*TIM:	 I don't want   
*DOR:	I'm going to chop you one piece of meat okay? We'll take away the other piece. 
*TIM:	A big pieces. 
*DOR:	Yeah. There you go. It'll be nice now. Nice and tasty.  (.) Well done Christopher. 
*AND:	Mm. 
*DOR:	You alright? 
*AND:	Must be getting better.  (.) So, it's been a nice warm day has it? 
*DOR:	Well it has really. It's been a bit sort of muggy this afternoon but we went out in the garden and we sort of just pottled around you know? 
*AND:	Better than the weekend weather that I saw? 
*DOR:	Yeah. 
*AND:	 ((laugh)) It's amazing how the worst weather we've had recently has been on   (.) Saturdays and Sundays isn't it? 
*DOR:	Mm. It's certainly very wet out there. (.)  
*TIM:	We had a go on the swing. 
*AND:	Did you? You've been on the swing? 
*DOR:	Apart from her sore throat was Julie okay? 
*AND:	 Seemed alright. 
*TIM:	 I   (  ) wobbly. 
*DOR:	Mm? 
*AND:	Yeah.  (.) No it was a fairly quiet day really. Not many people seemed to be at work. 
*DOR:	Oh. Where are they all? 
*AND:	Some at meetings  (  ) . Like you know  all   
*TIM:	 Yeah   
*AND:	the people who went to Pontepool last week? Well they're all off in Bromsgrove  this week  (  ) . 
*TIM:	 Potato. 
*DOR:	Mm. (.)  
*AND:	 (  ) and big Patrick and  Sue   (  )   
*DOR:	 Oh yeah, in Bromsgrove  yeah. Mm. What do they do? 
*AND:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Mm. 
*AND:	 (  )  (.) 
*TIM:	You gave me lots. 
*DOR:	I did not. 
*TIM:	You did. 
*DOR:	I certainly didn't give you lots of meat. 
*TIM:	I'm full. 
*DOR:	Oh that's alright. You don't need to have anything else. (.)  
*TIM:	I want my pudding. 
*DOR:	Oh no.  If you're full you won't need pudding. 
*AND:	 No it'll be a tiny pudding  if you're   (.) not gonna eat er finish all that. (.)  
*TIM:	It's too much. 
*DOR:	Well that's okay. You can leave it but you just don't get pudding as well. (.)  
*AND:	You eat just a little bit more. Cos then you can have a little pudding. That's it, you eat just a little bit more. (.)  
*TIM:	 (  ) 
*AND:	That's very tasty mummy.  (  ) Certainly looks as though it's a   (.) Rosemary Conley type thing. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TIM:	 (  ) eat it.  (.) You help me   (  ) meat. (.)  
*AND:	Whoops, it's in your eye. 
*TIM:	Oh. Oh. 
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TIM:	Potato. 
*AND:	 Potato in your eye. 
*DOR:	 Getting potatoes  in your eyes. 
*TIM:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	That's a funny place to put potato.  (.) Mm broccoli doesn't want to come on the fork. Come here broccoli. (.)  
*TIM:	Broccoli can't get on fork very well can it? 
*DOR:	We rang grandma of course to say we wouldn't be swimming. 
*AND:	So she's at home alright is she? 
*DOR:	There's a lot of things we're not doing isn't there at the moment? 
*AND:	Mm. 
*DOR:	Yes.  (.) She's fine. (.)  
*CHR:	And there are a lot of things we are doing.

*CHR:	It feeled like just this morning. 
*DOR:	Mm.

*TIM:	  (  )  
*DOR:	 Oh, right. I think that was a different boat  to the one that they showed you on the telly. (.)  
*AND:	I was telling you about the Queen Mary. Because it was on the back of   (.) something which he was making recently. You know he was cutting out  some card   
*DOR:	 Mm. He showed  me what it was. But I couldn't tell that it was the Queen Mary at the time because he'd already cut it out.
