               [6017] If you wanted to borrow money from the bank to, to buy anything there were two ways of getting money.<br>
               [6018] You could go to the bank and ask for a loan.<br>
               [6019] And mostly you got a dusty answer because if you hadn't got shares to put down as collateral, you didn't get your loan.<br>
               [6020] And the other way of doing it was to go on hire purchase.<br>
               [6021] And when you wanted to buy something like a three piece suite, you went to somewhere like Bentalls   ... and they took you into a little room, soon as you said to the man well I want to buy this on hire purchase and you went in to a little room   ... and the man sat down and you filled in a long form.<br>
               [6022] You told him what your husband earned.<br>
               [6023] Erm   ... what you, er what you   ... could manage in the way of repayments what, er er you had to put one third of the full price down.<br></td>
