*NIN:	Well  and they'd made little buns. •438672_440632•
        They were very nice really. •440712_442022•
*CLA:	Oh it's a tribute to the •443632_444412•
*NIN:	The state of the kitchen wasn't. •444412_445722•
*CLA:	Well  that'll be a tribute to the manufacturer, sure. •446342_448852•

*NIN:	And Robin and and erm  Carol doing that er cabbage  cabbage  •450432_454332•
*CLA:	Oh that revolting  •454712_455532•
*NIN:	That was horrible. •455532_456222•
*CLA:	That was terrible. •456292_457092•
        I remember Jill though. •457092_459152•
        I don't remember the mix but mm I don't know that, I vaguely remember now, yes but •459152_462192•
*NIN:	Oh they were all there •462192_462992•
*CLA:	Mm. •462992_463052•
*NIN:	because we'd gone out, I think it was the christmas shopping we were doing on our own. •463052_466292•
*CLA:	Was it? •466572_466732•
*NIN:	Mm. •466952_467152•
*CLA:	Mm. •467152_467362•
        Yes I've got a hazy recollection but . •467452_468802•
        Mm. •470672_470902•
        Jill'll remember. •472192_472712•
        But she was a lot younger surely, Jill? •472912_474472•
        And she'd be a bit  •474552_474962•
*NIN:	Oh she'd be young, erm •476432_477942•
*CLA:	Younger than them I mean. •478082_478852•
*NIN:	They weren't, oh they were younger than Caroline and erm Ken. •479712_483292•
*CLA:	Mm mm mm. •483492_484262•
        Mm. •485622_485732•
*NIN:	But then  look at Chris. •485732_487352•
        He must have been interested in cooking, mustn't he? •487352_489712•
*CLA:	I don't  Chris  •489802_490482•
*NIN:	No I think the young fellows today are more because of course they go into the flats don't they? •490482_495032•
*CLA:	Mm well that's true of course. •495142_496132•
*NIN:	I remember when Mike and Robin went into their flats I  spent quite a long time with them  •496552_501592•
*CLA:	Yeah I know. •501592_501842•
        Mm. •501842_501912•

        Mhm. •501982_502132•
*NIN:	Showing them how to do simple dishes. •502132_504572•
*CLA:	Mhm. •504642_504872•
        But erm  quite frankly I can't see myself ever getting  given the same sort of circumstances. •507332_512442•
*NIN:	Well no. •512442_513542•
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	I can't either. •513952_514962•
        Knowing you I   no it's laughable. •515392_517562•
*CLA:	Yeah. •523552_523642•
*NIN:	Can't imagine you meeting me with a nice cooked dinner and a  a cake  made by your own fair  •525522_532772•
*CLA:	No I  •533482_533622•
*NIN:	with a candle on . •533622_534442•
*CLA:	No. •534442_534832•
        Use a soldering iron or a blow lamp or something, not  •536422_538492•
*NIN:	Burnt toast. •539112_539402•
*CLA:	Ah no, it's not really burnt, it's the way I like it though. •539402_543332•
        Must admit technically  •543332_544662•
*NIN:	Well it used to smoke. •544662_546742•
*CLA:	Well yes technically speaking I suppose it is burnt but  well done I   •546772_552132•
*NIN:	Well it doesn't taste very nice. •552702_554782•
*CLA:	I can't agree cos I, that's how I like it. •555372_556802•
*NIN:	And the Well you used to scrape some of it off because it was all over the   •556802_560772•
*CLA:	Oh if it gets really charred I know but •560862_561962•
*NIN:	 ((laugh)) 
*CLA:	if it's really charred that's a bit  •561962_564172•
*NIN:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*CLA:	Certain degree of blackness even but  •565112_566812•
*NIN:	And how d'you get toast  charred so that you've got to scrape it off but it isn't burnt? •568442_573992•
        Oh I  •573992_574242•
*CLA:	Well leaving it that little bit too long, you know. •574282_576042•
*NIN:	 (        )  (.) 
*CLA:	Remember Robin coming home   I don't believe it, burnt  burnt toast  from an electric toaster. •578602_584652•
        I don't know how he does it. •585102_587252•
*NIN:	I don't know. •587722_588812•
*CLA:	Mm. •590312_590792•
        Oh well. •592032_592532•
        Doesn't feel like Sunday  does it? •598372_600372•
*NIN:	No. •600372_600532•
        I've not seen any more sight of that heron. •602442_606322•
*CLA:	No. •607152_607532•
*NIN:	I don't, I think it was just a flash in the pan. •608072_610222•
*CLA:	I don't think, well. •610222_610682•
*NIN:	I don't think  I'm certain there's not  •610682_611842•
*CLA:	I think it's much to do about nothing quite honestly. •611842_613762•
*NIN:	I do. •613762_613902•
*CLA:	I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some sort of er •614742_617362•
*NIN:	Well I don't feel like having a plastic heron. •617362_619422•
*CLA:	Well I mean how do all the rest of the they've not all got bloody herons, plastic herons perched on the side have they? •619752_624262•
*NIN:	No. •624592_624752•
*CLA:	Plastic   •625222_625652•
*NIN:	But you know d'you remember me going round the corner and seeing that erm  •625772_629372•
*CLA:	Mm. •629372_629682•
        Mm. •629682_629902•
*NIN:	pond with all those plastic ducks on? •630032_631522•
*CLA:	Flipping ducks on it. •631522_632372•
        Yeah I know. •632442_632742•
*NIN:	That might have been some  deterrent of some description. •632742_635402•
*CLA:	I don't think so somehow. •636192_637282•
        That was just   •637282_637602•
*NIN:	but I'm I'm certainly not having little plastic ducks  •637752_640022•
*CLA:	Art nouveau. •640452_•
*NIN:	and  little gnomes about. •641252_643552•
*CLA:	Mm. •643782_644092•
        That's interesting er  that erm  comment Steve made about the  postcard. •646012_650792•
        And the bird of prey silhouette, you know? •651892_653612•
        I can  •653612_654442•
*NIN:	Mm. •654442_654502•
*CLA:	believe that being  rather effective. •654502_656282•
*NIN:	Well actually I have read about the heron that er I think was it  I'm not sure that   •656282_661782•
*CLA:	What the plastic  plastic heron ? •661872_663072•
*NIN:	Oh  yes. •663102_664372•
*CLA:	Mm. •664372_664532•
        Mm. •665782_665932•
*NIN:	No way. •665932_668802•
*CLA:	Mm. •672452_672552•
        But that silhouette business, that could work you know. •672552_675232•
*NIN:	Mm. •675232_675292•
*CLA:	I can see that working. •675292_677772•
        Birds of prey. •679362_680442•
*NIN:	Well  really when you think, it's only the same way as  er laying the hose amongst your flower beds. •681282_688512•
        For cats. •689282_689912•
*CLA:	Oh the snake you mean? •691022_692082•
        Yeah. •693222_693322•
*NIN:	Mm. •693322_693642•
*CLA:	Mm  I've still to have that proved to me to be honest. •694142_696292•
        It's a damn great snake  •697252_698442•
*NIN:	Well I have. •698442_698792•
*CLA:	isn't it? •698882_699082•
        If you think about it. •699112_699782•
*NIN:	Yes. •700162_700252•
        Well I think  well, you know when we used to leave ours across the, the lawn there? •700252_704192•
*CLA:	Mm, yeah. •704192_704682•
*NIN:	Well  •705762_706122•
*CLA:	Cat didn't bother. •706412_706952•
*NIN:	Samba no he •706992_707972•
*CLA:	No. •707972_708112•
*NIN:	Well he did he did for a bit. •708112_709532•
*CLA:	Are you sure? •709942_710472•
*NIN:	Yes, I've watched him sort of er  warily  •710832_713642•
*CLA:	Waiting  •713642_713792•
*NIN:	walk round. •713792_714282•
        But then he got so used to it that he didn't bother. •714282_716252•
*CLA:	Mm, yeah. •716252_716942•
        That's what I mean. •717682_718152•
        It may, if it's any effect at all it's very short lived I think. •718152_720402•
*NIN:	Mm. •721452_721522•
        I don't think pepper's a very useful deterrent. •721572_723622•
        I've sprinkled loads of  •723932_725082•
*CLA:	No. •725082_725152•
*NIN:	pepper round. •725152_725722•
*CLA:	One shower of rain and you've lost it anyway. •726002_727412•
*NIN:	Mm. •727552_727632•
*CLA:	I'd have thought. •728062_729402•
        Mm. •731462_731772•
*NIN:	I think the only deterrent is putting  netting or something over it but er •732952_739992•
*CLA:	Mm. •740022_740082•
*NIN:	you can't put netting over your whole garden can you? •740152_742552•
        It's silly. •742592_742972•
*CLA:	No no. •742972_747052•
        We'll have to watch that pond though   leaves next year. •747652_750642•
*NIN:	Mm. •750792_750872•
*CLA:	Well this year of course. •751742_752242•
        Mm. •760352_760442•
*NIN:	Well I can't really see what you can do, only have netting over that when the leaves start to fall. •760442_764202•
*CLA:	Well yes  I could be a little bit more erm  attentive to the damn thing couldn't I? •764202_770442•
        We need to scrape quite a lot of that out but erm  not all by any means. •772092_782342•
        See a certain percentage have blown in I think off the grass and if I had some sort of a  •782392_785462•
*NIN:	I was just er yeah. •785462_787042•
        I was just gonna say that. •787042_788102•
*CLA:	Mm. •788102_788132•
        Mm. •788132_788252•
*NIN:	I think our problem here is it gets so windy with being on the corner. •788252_791732•
*CLA:	Mm. •793562_793702•
        Mm. •800362_800422•
        Yeah. •800422_800532•
*NIN:	D'you want any more tea? •800562_801972•
*CLA:	Oh yes please. •802022_802322•
        But I think  mm  mm. •802322_808122•
*NIN:	That was a silly question wasn't it? •808122_810112•
*CLA:	It was unnecessary wasn't it?oh yes I'll want a bit of a hand then. •810112_822082•
        With  the top window •822082_823692•
*NIN:	Yeah. •823702_823712•
*CLA:	I've left it with two screws holding it at the moment. •823712_828292•
        As we did,painting the outside yeah. •828292_829942•
*NIN:	Yes. •829942_830082•
        it won't blow out though? •830082_831402•
*CLA:	No not at all. •831522_831742•
        I'm gonna hold it while you take the two final screws out. •831802_834562•
*NIN:	Oh I see.? •834652_838692•
*CLA:	Yeah. •838692_838762•
        Cos it's almost impossible to get at it. •838772_853072•
*NIN:	It won't erm  I think •853082_856742•
*CLA:	What? •856742_856852•
*NIN:	once you've got the window done it won't be too bad will it? •856862_860252•
*CLA:	You mean the whole frame? •860252_861252•
*NIN:	Mm. •861252_861312•
*CLA:	And the opening light? •861312_862842•
*NIN:	Mm. •862952_863172•
*CLA:	It won't be too bad, will it? •863182_864502•
*NIN:	Oh I mean, what I mean is you've not •864502_866532•
*CLA:	Well there's not a tremendous amount of burning left. •866542_867992•
        There's only  one skirting board  and the pipe cover. •867992_873362•
*NIN:	Mm. •873602_873972•
*CLA:	The casing round the other cupboard. •873972_877232•
*NIN:	Mm. •877232_877402•
*CLA:	And that's it I think. •877412_878982•
        And possibly the edges of the cupboard doors, I don't know. •878982_881402•
*NIN:	Yes, they're not very brilliant. •881412_882892•
*CLA:	No. •884662_884982•
        Mm certainly want cleaning up. •884982_886192•
        I may end up taking them off completely though. •886192_889862•
        I think that may be easier to do  rather than do them in situ, you know? •889862_939252•
*NIN:	Are you going to have a piece of cake? •939252_940872•
*CLA:	Oh yeah. •940872_941152•
*NIN:	 (        )

*NIN:	It's quite good though. •953392_954002•

*CLA:	I know they cut some for them but  •955762_957322•
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	 ((laugh)) 
*NIN:	It's a wonder Caroline didn't. •957322_958562•

*NIN:	She usually stuffs doesn't she? •959022_959602•

*CLA:	Yeah. •991702_991762•
        Pick him up at twenty five to four. •991872_100345•

*CLA:	Oh god I know. •100765_100789•
        You're telling me. •100789_101008•

*NIN:	Cos it's been piled on so •101562_101700•
*CLA:	Yeah. •101787_101812•
        I can't get over that screw in the woodwork. •101813_102026•
*NIN:	I know! •102026_102078•
*CLA:	Good god. •102130_102142•
        I've seen dust before but  and bits of fluff and rag and stuff but I've never seen a bloody, and a nail  damn great screw! •102142_102801•
*NIN:	Well it's the same as the, the way they've papered the walls round. •102802_103084•
        They've just papered over things. •103084_103206•
        You know? •103206_103227•
*CLA:	They've papered over,I know . •103227_103337•
        I know. •103337_103458•
        Mm. •103458_103476•
*NIN:	It wouldn't have been, if they'd had any furniture in when we, when we first got in  I wouldn't have been surprised to see it painted round there as well. •103477_104132•
*CLA:	Oh the  you mean? •104214_104279•
        Oh aye. •104284_104331•
*NIN:	mm. •104495_104521•
*CLA:	Mm. •104994_105022•
        Mm. •105022_105041•
        No, coming back to the  . •105041_105212•
        I would prefer to keep it in natural wood if we can but  •105222_105766•
*NIN:	Oh yeah. •105766_105797•
*CLA:	all those splodges of white  are putty. •105797_106037•
*NIN:	Are they? •106055_106152•
*CLA:	Mm. •106355_106363•
        Unfortunately. •106363_106377•
*NIN:	And there's nothing at all you can cover them with? •106378_106673•
*CLA:	Well  except to take them out. •106673_106866•
        Scrape the bits of putty out    and put some  filler in that will accept stain. •106908_107475•
*NIN:	I think that'd be better. •107475_107756•
*CLA:	Mm. •107756_107766•
        But that's a  fairly long  job though. •107767_107975•
*NIN:	Er yes, but I mean it it  it would be worth it. •107975_108697•
*CLA:	Mm. •108896_108907•
        See it won't accept stain anyway  with that varnish on. •108907_109254•
*NIN:	Well I don't like this colour stain anyway. •109254_109475•
*CLA:	Well I don't. •109475_109493•
*NIN:	It's a nasty colour. •109515_109704•
*CLA:	You can't burn that off though. •109705_109804•
        It's dust. •109804_109885•
*NIN:	You couldn't  •109886_110024•
*CLA:	What? •110032_110045•
*NIN:	just give a dab of paint over? •110045_110226•
        A dark paint. •110226_110252•
*CLA:	It'd stand out a mile wouldn't it? •110252_110386•
*NIN:	Would it? •110433_110551•
*CLA:	Well  perhaps not as  obviously  •110551_110667•
*NIN:	Well if you did it with a small brush? •110667_110819•
*CLA:	Well it would still stand out wouldn't it cos it's a different colour? •110819_111098•
        Mm. •111098_111104•
        Not as  •111104_111120•
*NIN:	You don't  •111121_111155•
*CLA:	not as obvious perhaps as the white but  •111155_111282•
*NIN:	That's what I mean. •111282_111445•
*CLA:	Mm. •111541_111553•
        Mm. •111553_111558•
        But I'll have to get rid of all that varnish before it'll take any other stain. •111559_111917•
*NIN:	Mm. •111917_111931•
        See what it's like. •111941_112287•
*CLA:	I  what it's like when? •112287_112449•
*NIN:	When you've got rid of the varnish. •112450_112698•
*CLA:	Mm. •112698_112740•
        I may have to use varnish stripper. •112740_112859•
        Get a kind of varnish stripper for it. •112864_113051•
*NIN:	Well it might be better than erm  doing it any other way because •113051_113484•
*CLA:	I don't think it'll burn off. •113485_113708•
*NIN:	No I'm thinking of the fumes. •113709_114311•
*CLA:	After all the other fumes I don't think that'll matter. •114311_114659•
*NIN:	After what? •114659_114678•
*CLA:	After the fumes of the paintwork, I don't think that'll  •114678_114937•
*NIN:	Won't that be worse than ? •114937_115082•
*CLA:	No. •115082_115093•
        Not as bad as. •115093_115155•
        No no. •115155_115862•
*NIN:	Oh. •115862_115866•
        Cos I remember when you did twenty seven. •115866_116148•
*CLA:	Mm. •116148_116165•
        Ah well that was a varnish paint. •116165_116272•
*NIN:	That was quite  •116307_116342•
*CLA:	That was a varnish paint. •116342_116458•
*NIN:	And that won't, that'll just be   stain? •116458_116816•
*CLA:	Varnish. •116853_116863•
        No. •116863_116877•
        It is a stain varnish. •116877_117694•
        In other words varnish, with a stain added to the varnish before you apply it. •117694_118084•
*NIN:	Mm. •118084_118115•
*CLA:	As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it with  •118165_118312•
*NIN:	Oh I see. •118312_118393•
*CLA:	relatively clear varnish. •118527_119106•
*NIN:	Mm. •119106_119113•
        Once we've got those tiles off at the bottom there •119114_119355•
*CLA:	Mm? •119355_119361•
*NIN:	well we might as well paint   •119361_119551•
*CLA:	Well I think, I mean they're very nice, it would rather, I'd prefer to, it would be nice to have  tile there to break it , but not those damn things and they certainly won't come off and go back. •119564_120629•
*NIN:	They're a bit messy aren't they? •120629_120876•
*CLA:	Mm. •120885_120918•
        One two three four five six seven eight, twenty four. •120929_121238•
        Two dozen. •121238_121733•
        Mm. •121733_121763•
*NIN:	How many did we get in the pack? •121763_121898•
*CLA:	The pack. •121898_121921•
        I don't know . •121922_121951•
*NIN:	I think it was twenty five. •121951_122116•
*CLA:	I really don't know. •122116_122199•
        Oh it varies, the pack doesn't it? •122199_122448•
*NIN:	Mm. •122448_122455•
*CLA:	Think it is twenty five actually. •122455_122658•

*NIN:	But erm  finding the right tile . •123309_123721•
*CLA:	Yeah. •123721_123739•
*NIN:	In any case you don't want them all the same do you? •123743_123955•
        I think we're better off just snapping it off. •123955_124172•
        Wonder what state the wall's in? •124172_124350•
*CLA:	Doesn't really matter all that much. •124350_124468•
        I'd skim over the plaster anyway. •124468_124664•
*NIN:	Mm. •124680_124683•
        Be a right mess won't it? •124683_125090•
*CLA:	Mm. •125091_125092•
        It's highly probable I'll finish up skimming anyway. •125092_125322•
*NIN:	Mm I was just thinking that. •125334_125488•
*CLA:	mm. •125488_125501•
*NIN:	I mean the way, what have they done here? •125501_125889•
*CLA:	Well what have they done anywhere? •125889_126253•
        Mm. •126253_126263•
*NIN:	Well they ran short of tiles or they they wouldn't be bothered cutting. •126263_126533•
        I bet  •126622_126647•
*CLA:	That's more likely the case. •126647_126713•
        Mm. •126713_126721•
*NIN:	One two three four  •126721_127021•

*NIN:	Yes, there was three more there. •127776_128014•
*CLA:	Mm. •128084_128103•

*CLA:	Yeah. •128668_128682•
*NIN:	It looks quite effective . •128689_128910•
*CLA:	Oh it's quite effective if it's done correctly, yes. •128911_129139•
        As it is now it's bloody awful. •129139_129430•
*NIN:	Have you had some cake? •129430_129591•

*NIN:	with us making a row won't they? •143778_144123•

*NIN:	taken her to get  on her feet . •168667_168799•
*CLA:	Of course, good god yes. •168853_168923•

        Of course, oh yeah. •169794_169815•
        Oh yes. •169972_170152•
        Yes it was on the radio this morning about that erm  it is in England somewhere I think   a woman's given birth to a fifteen pound  some ounces kid. •170152_171438•
*NIN:	Oh dear me. •171448_171644•
*CLA:	Good gracious. •171644_171664•
        Tremendous size that is isn't it? •171664_171736•
*NIN:	Mm. •171736_171746•
        Yeah. •171746_171785•
*CLA:	Mind its weight, I don't know about the size but  mm. •171785_172799•
        We seem to have a tremendous lot of seagulls don't we? •172799_173011•
        Over that playing field there. •173014_173054•
*NIN:	Well it's being so windy isn't it? •173063_173297•
*CLA:	Yeah well I, no I'm generalizing throughout the year. •173297_173530•
*NIN:	Well we're not that far from the sea are we? •173547_173706•
*CLA:	Of course not, that's true. •173726_173907•
        Yeah. •173907_173942•
        Mm. •173942_173952•
        Oh yes but I mean they  they seem to concentrate pretty well round these playing fields for some reason. •173952_175294•
        blackbird there. •175294_175304•
*NIN:	Yeah I know. •175307_175327•
        the way they land. •175344_175469•
*CLA:	Yeah it's interesting to watch the different birds, the different methods of landing. •175469_175735•
        Some are quite accurate. •175735_175838•
        The others are a bit sprawling those blackbirds I think . •175838_176083•
*NIN:	Mm the . •176394_176468•
*CLA:	Yeah. •176468_176512•
        caw caw caw   That looks like an old one to me doesn't it? •176843_177240•
*NIN:	An old fella  •177249_177317•
*CLA:	Yeah. •177337_177344•
        Well not an old fella necessarily. •177344_178218•
*NIN:	I'm still sort of puzzling  what the best thing, best thing to do for that hedge down there. •178224_178816•
        Cos we can't er  until we get  it cleared all the way along it  although, it seems to change. •178817_179861•
        If you look •179861_179916•
*CLA:	Hang on. •179916_179940•
        What seems to change? •179943_180024•
*NIN:	The hedge. •180059_180127•
        If you look from here  •180127_180235•
*CLA:	In what way does it ? •180235_180404•
*NIN:	Well if you look from here •180424_180546•
*CLA:	I'm looking from here. •180548_180620•
*NIN:	And then you go along. •180620_180705•
*CLA:	I'm going along. •180705_180772•
*NIN:	By the time it gets to that  all that rubbish that we're going to shift. •180772_181174•
*CLA:	Er oh yes, there in front. •181174_181284•
*NIN:	Well then if you look it  tends to change to a different variety  trees. •181297_181610•
*CLA:	Oh it does there. •181610_181651•
        See what you mean. •181651_181809•
        Yes. •181823_181846•
        Yeah   •181847_181848•
*NIN:	I don't  •181848_181921•
*CLA:	it definitely does change doesn't it? •181921_182001•
        Mm. •182002_182003•
*NIN:	I don't know what they are, but one of those trees has little catkins on it. •182005_182313•
        Very poor. •182315_182395•
*CLA:	Yes. •182395_182439•
*NIN:	So it obviously  •182439_182476•
*CLA:	I'm not surprised  they're poor  . •182476_182616•
*NIN:	I know I know. •182616_182809•
*CLA:	Mm. •182853_182859•
*NIN:	But erm  it wants the roots  clearing •182859_183128•
*CLA:	Yeah. •183128_183139•
*NIN:	and feeding and •183139_183273•
*CLA:	Mm. •183279_183295•
        Mm. •183296_183297•
        Mhm. •183297_183301•
*NIN:	It's a shame though to let them die because they're  I like to have a, a different  I don't want it all the same. •183301_184088•
        It's  boring isn't it? •184142_184177•
*CLA:	Oh you're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia aren't you? •184177_184645•
*NIN:	That gives interest, especially  •184645_184774•
*CLA:	Same  •184774_184789•
*NIN:	into the corner. •184811_184854•
*CLA:	Mm that's why I don't want to clip that erm bottom hedge too cleanly. •184854_185314•
*NIN:	No but I think •185314_185399•
*CLA:	Lop it down. •185399_185459•
        Yes I agree. •185459_185514•
        Lop it down but erm •185514_185629•
*NIN:	I think we need to, for this time round  because it'll soon get, you know •185629_186226•
*CLA:	Take its own   •186309_186410•
*NIN:	. •_•
*CLA:	Mm. •186410_186434•
        Mm. •186434_186445•
        Yes maybe you're right. •186446_186544•
*NIN:	But I do think for now we're just going to have to chop it down. •186544_186824•
*CLA:	Mm. •186836_186856•
*NIN:	It's going to get worse and worse if we don't. •186856_187292•
*CLA:	Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter, hedge cutter you know? •187292_187723•
*NIN:	Yes. •187723_187733•
        I looked in the paper to see if there was any. •187733_187917•
*CLA:	No there weren't. •187918_187957•
*NIN:	They're very expensive to buy aren't they? •187957_188166•
*CLA:	Oh new they are certainly yes. •188166_188283•
*NIN:	Yes, and you want a double action one? •188283_188548•
*CLA:	Preferably. •188548_188578•
        Not essentially. •188578_188631•
*NIN:	I, I wouldn't think that erm  like the different length of the blades. •188632_189010•
        You don't want a very big one. •189018_189136•
*CLA:	I don't think you need the, think it's a twenty four is it?no. •189149_189458•
*NIN:	I would think they're more trouble than they're worth unless you've got •189458_189750•
*CLA:	Yeah. •189750_189760•
        They could be. •189760_189820•
*NIN:	a great big  •189950_190001•
*CLA:	Mm. •190001_190008•
        Oh and you'd have to be that little bit more careful too. •190009_190295•
*NIN:	Mm. •190295_190327•
        Yes exactly. •190374_190718•
*CLA:	Mm. •190769_190783•
        Mm. •190783_190805•
*NIN:	. •_•
        I think that's what   •190806_190949•
*CLA:	And again, unless the motor is fairly hefty  •190949_191445•
*NIN:	Mm. •191447_191500•
*CLA:	it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out. •191500_191684•
        Because it's doing more work isn't it? •191698_191910•
*NIN:	I don't . •191928_191973•
*CLA:	Mm well in theory. •191973_192058•
        A bigger area, bigger length. •192079_192161•
        You're cutting more at the same time. •192161_192254•
*NIN:	Yeah I was looking at the petrol driven ones. •192254_192508•
*CLA:	Good god. •192508_192567•
*NIN:	I know. •192568_192598•
        That's what  I thought. •192598_192733•
*CLA:	Stone the crows. •192748_192857•
        Cor. •192865_192878•
*NIN:	It took me breath away so •192878_193068•
*CLA:	Good gracious me. •193068_193213•
*NIN:	Mm. •193239_193265•
*CLA:	No no. •193274_193477•
*NIN:	Just how •193477_193686•
*CLA:	What? •193827_193852•
*NIN:	much  erm  how much can you cut with those as opposed to having  needing  the erm, the other ones that are used for trees. •193852_194865•
        Erm •194865_194881•
*CLA:	Chainsaw ? •194881_194897•
*NIN:	chainsaw. •194898_194899•
        I couldn't, forget the word. •194899_195077•
        The chainsaw. •195077_195086•
*CLA:	Oh they'll take er do a fair amount of work but erm  I think, certainly as far as the hedge is concerned •195086_195659•
*NIN:	Well I know that. •195659_195717•
*CLA:	Yeah hang on. •195717_195914•
        Hang on. •195914_195941•
        In a well established hedge like that •195941_196061•
*NIN:	Yeah. •196061_196078•
*CLA:	I would think er the loppers, if the erm  hedgecutter won't tackle it the loppers will •196078_196531•
*NIN:	Yes but what I was thinking more •196537_196722•
*CLA:	Mm. •196722_196737•
*NIN:	is the rest of the, round there  round at the side there. •196737_197218•
        I mean a lot of the  you know when we start getting rid of all the rubbish down that side? •197218_197675•
*CLA:	Er I wouldn't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm that bush there. •197676_198014•
        That's a little bit too heavy for it. •198014_198190•
*NIN:	Which bush? •198190_198309•
*CLA:	Well the one  where the hedge terminates and •198309_198959•
*NIN:	Mm  well. •198959_199002•
*CLA:	That dead looking well dead  •199002_199247•
*NIN:	No. •199276_199294•
        No but would it do to, I mean you're going to have a lot of the  stuff that we chopped off •199294_199938•
*CLA:	Yeah. •199940_199953•
*NIN:	to put to, if we're getting a trailer and getting rid of it all. •199953_200311•
*CLA:	Yeah. •200312_200313•
        Yeah. •200413_200433•
*NIN:	You're going to have to cut it down still further into smaller pieces aren't you, to get as much as you can in the trailer? •200433_200893•
*CLA:	Oh I see what you mean, to cram on the trailer. •200893_201054•
        Yes. •201077_201089•
        Yes yes. •201089_201143•
*NIN:	Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to revert to erm  a chainsaw? •201151_201770•
*CLA:	Er  combination of both I should think. •201777_201879•
        I, well I'm not too concerned about that anyway. •201880_202065•
        I can use the loppers. •202065_202167•
        If we were doing it seven days a week, fair enough, you'd probably need a chainsaw but   anything, the loppers or the handsaw. •202167_202945•
*NIN:	Oh handsaw? •202945_202957•
        Oh that's hard work. •202957_203068•
*CLA:	No. •203068_203077•
        No no no no not the really not the thick ones  •203077_203346•
*NIN:	Mm. •203439_203452•
*CLA:	But erm •203452_203512•
*NIN:	Well I was just thinking of taking the work out of it. •203512_203848•
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*NIN:	Mm it's one hell of a lot of work   •203852_203971•
*CLA:	But you see we don't really need a chainsaw do we? •203971_204312•
*NIN:	No I wouldn't say so normal but er there's quite a lot to   •204313_204634•
*CLA:	No. •204634_204640•
        No. •204640_204650•
        No. •204650_204664•
        To hire one possibly for a specific  specific job but •204664_205002•
*NIN:	I wonder how much they are to hire? •205002_205201•
*CLA:	Not very dear. •205228_205261•
*NIN:	Oh aren't they? •205261_205334•
*CLA:	What erm chainsaws? •205371_205569•
*NIN:	Mm. •205585_205649•
*CLA:	I think  last time I looked at the hire list, price, price list •205649_205997•
*NIN:	Mm. •206011_206053•
*CLA:	I think about  five six quid a day something like that, they were last year. •206285_206624•
        Mm. •206625_206626•
*NIN:	Oh that's not bad really. •206628_206736•
*CLA:	Oh it isn't bad if you've got a lot of erm chainsaw work to do. •206737_207181•
        That can be done in a day you know. •207181_207560•
*NIN:	Yeah. •207560_207584•
*CLA:	Mm. •207584_207615•
        Now whether that's erm  including all the protective clothing or not I dunno. •207616_208040•
*NIN:	I don't know. •208040_208141•
*CLA:	There might be a different charge for that but  •208179_208406•
*NIN:	Er did you  think any more about the er  rubbish clearance that was, they were advertising in the paper? •208531_209078•
        I mean what d'you think? •209082_209245•
*CLA:	Oh the  twelve quid's worth wasn't it? •209245_209344•
        Was it twelve? •209358_209463•
        Sixteen. •209476_209524•
*NIN:	Sixteen quid for one load. •209572_209701•
        What's a load? •209701_209801•
*CLA:	What is, well yes. •209801_209851•
        Anything that'll fill a skip, it'll be a skip. •209851_210105•
*NIN:	Skip . •210105_210155•
*CLA:	And I suspect that'll be the smallest skip, I don't know. •210155_210364•
*NIN:	I would imagine so. •210374_210421•
*CLA:	Did it say from? •210421_210569•
        What did it just say? •210569_210751•
*NIN:	No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I  •210751_210969•
*CLA:	Mm. •210974_210989•
        Mm. •210989_210997•
        Mm. •210997_211008•
*NIN:	thought mm I wonder how much a load is. •211008_211214•
*CLA:	Well yes, it's probably the smallest skip. •211215_211410•
*NIN:	But it'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite a lot of it. •211410_211806•
*CLA:	See I don't see erm  them shifting very much for that because by the time you've  got a bloke out  paid his wages, paid for the  the erm  skip shifter, transporter you know. •211807_213050•
*NIN:	Well if this is a skip. •213050_213158•
        It might just be a trailer. •213158_213307•
*CLA:	It might be a trailer. •213307_213398•
        It might be an open back lorry, you know. •213398_213713•
*NIN:	Mm. •213713_213726•
*CLA:	Mm. •213726_213741•
*NIN:	A lorry? •213741_213767•
*CLA:	Yeah. •213767_213781•
*NIN:	Well we could get rid of I doubt it whether they're going to shift that  •213781_214050•
*CLA:	Well, you know mm. •214095_214217•
*NIN:	I doubt that. •214300_214348•
*CLA:	But again on a costing basis I mean hourly. •214348_214547•
        How long is it gonna take a chap to load loads? •214547_214746•
*NIN:	Yes but I'm thinking I mean there's so much to do here Larry, you er  you know, you're not a young man any more. •214747_215313•
        You can't er do too much. •215323_215527•
*CLA:	Er I had noticed. •215527_215639•
        Yes. •215759_215769•
        Yes. •215770_215771•
        Yes. •215771_215792•
*NIN:	It's no good wearing yourself out if you can get anything done  •215792_216038•
*CLA:	I was worn out already. •216038_216137•
        What are you on about ? •216137_216274•
*NIN:	You know what I mean. •216274_216390•
*CLA:	I'm knackered. •216461_216560•
        Mm. •216574_216607•
*NIN:	But it makes sense to me to have a little bit of help. •216607_216945•
*CLA:	Oh I'm not adverse to having  bit of help •216945_217149•
*NIN:	Mm. •217149_217155•
*CLA:	you know of the right sort. •217157_217268•
        No no no, no no no, no  Erm •217268_217705•
*NIN:	You're usually pretty independent. •217730_218012•
*CLA:	A little perhaps but er  I mean you can have people that are more damn trouble than they're worth can't you? •218299_218576•
        Quite honestly. •218581_218609•
*NIN:	Mm. •218609_218634•
*CLA:	Spend your time watching •218634_218708•
*NIN:	Well you know the, all the stuff that you've got  at the side where •218708_219022•
*CLA:	Ah well that's straight on the trailer, yeah. •219023_219198•
*NIN:	Is it? •219198_219224•
*CLA:	Well more, more or less, yeah. •219236_219504•
        One or two things I'll be keeping but most of it  it's just straight, that's why it's all piled up ready to go. •219504_219970•
*NIN:	Ah but I wasn't just meaning on the concrete bit. •219970_220257•
        I was meaning on the soil. •220257_220477•
        There's loads and loads of what you trimmed off the . •220477_220751•
*CLA:	Oh that's not rubbish that's just erm off the trees isn't it? •220751_221057•
*NIN:	Well it's still got to be got rid of hasn't it? •221057_221251•
*CLA:	Chuck it over the fence and it'll go straight in, more or less straight in the trailer won't it? •221260_221740•
*NIN:	It'll be just like you  to get your trailer and your car down there when er   arrive and . •221745_222383•
*CLA:	Oh highly probable. •222402_222449•
        Sod's law, yes . •222449_222516•
*NIN:	I know . •222516_222537•
        I can't get over the fact that, that all •222537_223237•
*CLA:	What? •223240_223268•
*NIN:	all through the winter we've had daisies all over the grass. •223268_223667•
*CLA:	Oh yes you mean the fact that they've been in flower ? •223667_224020•
        Mm. •224029_224040•
        Mm. •224041_224042•
*NIN:	You don't usually see daisies do you ? •224052_224269•
*CLA:	I honestly don't know Nina. •224270_224384•
        I don't know. •224384_224480•
*NIN:	Mm don't think it's dry enough to cut the grass is it? •224508_224736•
*CLA:	Oh I , no I wouldn't do it today. •224736_224931•
        No, crikey no. •224939_225068•
*NIN:	No I don't think so. •225069_225147•
        It doesn't look very promising. •225147_225647•
*CLA:	No. •225769_225778•
*NIN:	 (        ) 
*CLA:	Mm. •225778_225796•
        Mm. •225796_225802•
*NIN:	It makes it hard work doesn't it? •225832_225989•
*CLA:	Oh yes. •226066_226084•
*NIN:	Have to do a bit at a time. •226187_226348•
*CLA:	I'm going to investigate, see if I can't do a I don't think for one minute I will but it's possible  do a conversion  er into erm  the box type. •226348_227440•
        Cos that way all the  or most of the cuttings at least, go into the box wouldn't they? •227461_227904•
        It's possible. •227931_227965•
*NIN:	Oh it might be more trouble than it's worth. •227965_228165•
*CLA:	It might be. •228165_228320•
        It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small vacuum cleaner  and cutting the erm  •228320_228679•
*NIN:	Ah don't use  •228679_228826•
*CLA:	No? •228826_228858•
*NIN:	No I, I prefer using it just as it is quite frankly. •228873_229228•
*CLA:	Well it's not a big thing, it's only  you know what I mean don't you? •229229_229435•
        That yellow and green one? •229441_229540•
*NIN:	Yes I know what you mean but I don't fancy you messing about with the  grasscutter. •229552_230153•
*CLA:	No •230153_230167•
*NIN:	Cos I find it  if there's anything else attached to it  •230167_230543•
*CLA:	It depends which mounting. •230543_230732•
        Keep the centre of gravity low  and there'd be no problems. •230732_230995•
*NIN:	No I don't, I can't agree with you there. •230996_231266•
*CLA:	Mm. •231266_231272•
        Maybe not, no. •231272_231299•
*NIN:	No, leave well alone. •231299_231711•
*CLA:	Mm    •231711_231717•
*NIN:	don't you? •231717_231774•
        And then you just make a mess of what you've already got. •231777_232058•
*CLA:	It's quite possible but erm    •232058_232462•
*NIN:	Mm but I, I mean I can use it as it is now but anything else on to it I would find it difficult. •232462_233173•
*CLA:	Well I'm gonna bash on with the erm •233223_233456•
*NIN:	Right, are you ready for the window yet? •233456_233695•
*CLA:	Well er yes please. •233695_233741•

*CLA:	Okay. •234283_234337•
        Right. •234337_234358•
