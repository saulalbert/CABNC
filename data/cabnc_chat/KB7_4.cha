*ANN:	and this that and the other  but people must have heard what went on and and  you know the next morning they'd see a black eye and just carry out a normal conversation as though  •249328_250466•
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	and you know they hadn't heard it all and •250609_250834•
*STU:	Yeah. •250834_250842•

*STU:	Yes. •253032_253061•
*ANN:	Ooh I thought he was going to, ooh I felt  made me go cold and I  I thought if, if I hadn't been here on my own I'd have been very tempted to go round and  and say is there anything I can do. •253414_254594•
        Or I'd have called the police I think. •254594_254879•
        I weren't sure what I'd have done but •254969_255090•
*STU:	Bad as that? •255117_255158•
*ANN:	Oh . •255158_255161•

        She was screaming and you could hear her crying. •255899_256161•
        Then you hear, she pounded up the bloody stairs and he was after her  and I reckon  well the only room with a lock  •256243_256779•
*STU:	As you say is the bathroom. •256930_257029•
*ANN:	is the bathroom, so she must have been in there cos he's hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it. •257029_257620•
        Bloody hell of a row. •257620_257736•
        Or whether she opened it or whether she was in the front bedroom with something behind the door I dunno but  •257967_258466•
*STU:	That's his •258628_258668•
*ANN:	and she run back down the stairs and the front door was opening and banging and shutting, whether she run outside or what  I don't know what happened, the dog was bloody barking. •258668_259571•
*STU:	Oh lord. •259681_259765•

*ANN:	And they had company as well there's a car there, blue car. •260477_260715•
*STU:	Who Ann and Rita or? •260715_260775•
*ANN:	Or Ann and Rita. •261108_261172•
        I don't know. •261172_261209•
*STU:	Sally innit? •261301_261372•
*ANN:	I don't know who it was. •261391_261607•
*STU:	It was Sally if it was a blue , blue cavalier. •261715_262172•
        T D O something something something. •262364_262677•
*ANN:	Sally can't drive so it must be some •262677_262838•
*STU:	Can't she? •262933_262964•
*ANN:	Her latest beau I should think, I don't know. •263196_263528•
*STU:	Maybe. •263528_263543•
        Maybe maybe. •263543_263697•
*ANN:	But it was  I mean I could hear it over the telly. •263952_264169•
        I know I don't have the telly on full blast but  I could hear it •264331_264783•
*STU:	Mm. •264789_264795•
*ANN:	above the telly. •264885_264934•
        When I first heard the first noise I thought what the bloody hell's that and I turned the sound down. •264976_265366•
*STU:	Yeah. •265368_265374•
*ANN:	Thought bloody hell, put it back up but you could, it was really distressing me cos •265374_265932•
*STU:	You knew what was possibly going on. •266008_266179•
*ANN:	Yeah. •266206_266217•
*STU:	Mm. •266303_266309•
*ANN:	A woman and that don't I mean  if you're having just an argument  it's raised voices but a woman doesn't scream and  cry like that unless  •266393_267337•
*STU:	Unless there's something really •267353_267614•
*ANN:	something awful going on. •267621_267726•
*STU:	Mm. •267734_267740•
*ANN:	I mean Ann and Rita reckon they're not married or anything but why the hell does she stay with him then? •267740_268730•
        She's not got a bloody •268792_268940•
*STU:	Well there you go I mean  •268940_269010•
*ANN:	she's got no children. •269034_269093•
        They're only young. •269210_269284•
        It's her house. •269284_269560•
        Isn't his. •269694_269742•
        He couldn't, she bought it without, with her father and •269863_270134•
*STU:	Mm. •270134_270142•
*ANN:	and he come and lived with her in it. •270233_270624•
        Bloody hell. •270700_270764•
        I know I mean I stayed with him but I had three kids. •270764_271217•
*STU:	Gonna say you're you're  •271217_271296•
*ANN:	I had three kids, where could I go with them? •271379_271572•
*STU:	Mm. •271572_271584•
        Mm. •271584_271590•
*ANN:	If I'd have been on me own I mean that's all I was waiting for, mine to grow up so I could clear off. •271623_272220•
*STU:	Yeah. •272227_272238•
*ANN:	If I'd have been on me own I wouldn't have stopped bloody long. •272347_272631•
        I mean even if she walks out he doesn't, no court in the land would give him the house if it's hers. •272631_273397•
        evicted and then she could come back again. •273739_273904•
*STU:	Mm. •273914_273939•
*ANN:	Well if she went to the police they'd chuck him out. •274236_274419•
        He has no legal rights to the property. •274530_274729•
        It's in her name, she's, her father's helping her  paid the deposit or something and she clears the mortgage  she has no right, he has no right to it all if she went to the police. •274729_275703•
        They'd just turf him out wouldn't they? •275703_276397•
*STU:	Mm. •276397_276404•
*ANN:	Well why stay in a relationship like that? •276420_276545•
        Don't understand it. •276548_276858•
*STU:	Certainly a bit rough, a bit hard. •277135_277285•
*ANN:	Went quiet about half past ten so whether he buggered off out or what I don't know. •277311_277679•
*STU:	Mm maybe. •277679_277701•
*ANN:	Certainly the front door was opening and banging and shutting. •277819_278079•
*STU:	Say I'm surprised Ann and Rita haven't sort of didn't •278243_278595•
*ANN:	Well banging on the wall probably with all the other banging and   •278731_278975•
*STU:	maybe. •278982_278988•
        Maybe. •279001_279016•
        They  part of the banging. •279016_279297•
*ANN:	So much bloody banging going on. •279297_279474•
*STU:	Probably part of the banging  Ann and Rita. •279474_279718•
*ANN:	And the people on this side  you don't know how they were reacting as well. •279718_279977•
        Say, they was a quite young couple. •280064_280239•
        We don't hear them that much do we? •280239_280397•
        Mornings is the  time I hear them most. •280449_280713•
        Cos they go out to work at half past eight and you hear them between half past seven and half past eight •280806_281207•
