*ANN:	Really, really good!
*GRA:	er   (.) and that was one of the problems, I couldn't tighten them, I didn't have

*GRA:	the right equipment because, they're awkward to put on because the nuts are on the top of the   (.) on the top of the blade.
*ANT:	Yeah.
*GRA:	So you gotta get away and underneath and I haven't got the   (.) rer rer  (.) the socket spanners that would do it, so   (.) well I haven't got a spanner let alone a socket ones that would do it!And er

*GRA:	Wha what this is in the management   (.) side?
*SAR:	Oh yeah, er well   (.) be a different one to that to start with   (.) but it'll be earlier.What's actually happened is, first of all Tracey's leaving, she's been promoted to Area Telesales Manager for Talking Pages   (.) so she's going up to Slough   (.) and   (.) Michelle will be going for that position, and one other girl     (.)  (        )  (.) and the two others that are on management development, one is now leaving cos she's like, burnt out, she doesn't want to do it any more   (.) and the other one's going into the field so   (.) it's literally just me and this other girl and Michelle, but I'm obviously just starting, but next time around   (.) it'll just be me again Di , and Dianna  is good at her work
*ANN:	Mm.
*SAR:	but she jus just hasn't got a   [laughing] personality  [] !
*ANN:	Yeah.
*SAR:	Erm, she's a very aggressive person!
*GRA:	Oh right.
*SAR:	And manner 
*ANN:	Oh yeah.
*SAR:	not, not even like in the right situation, she's like just aggressive all the time and nobody particularly gets on with her or likes her because of this.And, they do say that they don't feel that   (.) unless she changed her personality
*GRA:	Mm.
*SAR:	she probably wouldn't become a manager, because usually you think you can change and develop but   (.) I think she'll be then be able to become a manager and she'll   (.) sort of learn, [laughing] but she'd have to   [] actually change her personality for it.
*ANT:	Would she have to change her personality or not?
*SAR:	 [whispering] Shut up  [] !But, er, so hopefully Michelle will get this next   (.) Tracey's position, and obviously sort of in   (.) in the meantime and providing her position comes up they   (.) are bringing in a Telesales County Secretary, which wasn't gonna come in for about a year cos they wanted to sort of like, trial it, but now they've decided if that's what they want the position to do   (.) erm   (.) it'll probably happen in the next two months and they said for me to go for it from our division, so I said right, okay.
*ANT:	 [whispering] Oh she won't like that  [] !
*GRA:	That'll be in Southend, will it still?
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	Good!
*SAR:	Well it's actually just basically the team   (.) it's a new position that they've actually made   (.) within each team now, within each division   (.) which is like, you're dealing with higher accounts but a different type of account as well.
*GRA:	Oh, jolly good!
*ANN:	Oh very good!

*SAR:	I was gonna say, for the other one
*GRA:	But we haven't got his yet.
*SAR:	That's gotta be   (        ) more than that, cos that's basically what my fares cost.
*GRA:	Well his'll be a thousand pound for the operation, being a major operation, it will be the fact that it's skull.
*ANN:	It'll be very, very expensive.
*SAR:	Well when I had my boob done   (.) including consultation, his was about seven hundred pound.
*ANN:	Mm.
*SAR:	I had my face done, and oh God, it was about five hundred pounds!
*GRA:	Well Mr  was over a thousand pound for the   (.) gall bladder operation 
*SAR:	Yeah.
*GRA:	but
*ANN:	I never 
*GRA:	er 
*ANN:	even knew, (        ) that one.
*GRA:	but he won't get that now for it because   (.) they've graded them, so that if it's, it's keyhole surgery type now it's er, it's a lower figure than
*SAR:	Because, you're not actually opening them up.
*GRA:	That's right.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*SAR:	Oh!
*GRA:	So that was the embarrassment I had to do when we went and saw er, Mr erm     (.)  (.) I had to say to him, you charge BUPA rates do you?And, he said yes I do and waved the leaflet at me, he says I know all about that but   (.) but you've got to now otherwise you you 
*SAR:	Mm!
*GRA:	could find yourself let in for two or three hundred pound   (.) because

*GRA:	BUPA won't pay it.
*SAR:	Well shall we go in the dining room?
*ANN:	Did you know how much I'd lost?

*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	where th  (.) the a apparently, you know, they put them right as se when you're very young now 
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	but they have found that   (.) in a lot of cases that the   (.) bones starts growing so therefore, when you're   (.) in your late teens, twenties, maturing   (.) your bottom jaw is growing out from the rest of   (.) your jaw bone.So they had this girl which they showed er, where they had to   (.) break all the bone up under here

*GRA:	Oh!Pull yo co co well you can imagine why people hid themselves away.And this chap, I mean he was   (.) oh this, it was almost sickening to look at!
*SAR:	Mm
*GRA:	And   (.) this   (.) th th this three surgeons go out from here   (.) and they do all their research on the various and they operate from eight o'clock at night to eight in the morning, non-stop, using three theatres, each doing a forty five minutes   (.) one, and then another one takes 
*SAR:	Cos they can't eat properly with cleft palates anyway
*ANN:	No.
*SAR:	can they?
*GRA:	No.
*ANN:	No.
*GRA:	And this chap in pen, and   (.) it showed them drawing on his   (.) lips when he was anaesthetized where you
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	thought he'd cut and things like this   (.) and then they showed you the chap the next day   (.) and he was completely different!He he could walk down the street without people looking and staring at him.They're amazing!
*ANN:	Terrible for them!They're awful!
*GRA:	Amazing , what they can do now!But, but they're saying that, ooh apart from I think the   (.) what they're really saying is that it's   (.) better to wait till   (.) in 
*SAR:	You're older.
*GRA:	you're older and do it then 
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	because   (.) as I say,

*GRA:	Ooh!
*ANT:	five P a minute.
*GRA:	Oh yes.
*ANT:	So it's quite expensive.
*ANN:	It is very expensive innit?
*GRA:	Well I know with Arnold and Antony is   (.) Arnold's not so bad cos he uses his quite a bit er   (.) but the tendency with Antony is, when the bill comes in each month   (.) th  (.) the rental is double what   (.) the usage is most of the time.
*SAR:	Mm.
*ANT:	Oh we try and use ours   (.) as little as possible but still we've had high bills.Where's the   (        ) love?
*SAR:	In the drawer behind you.
*GRA:	Well I've switched my office phone over and, well they actually wrote to me, but I've switched mine over to this   (.) er   (.) discount, if you do more than a hundred pounds worth a quarter.
*ANT:	Is it Mercury?
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	No, B T.
*ANT:	Oh!

*SAR:	That's for , for Antony.
*GRA:	that they've just   (.) discounted   (.) users.But you can't   (.) I only get it on line one   (.) because line two   (.) I just use as an a   (.) as an incoming call line, or if I'm  (.) .caught on one and I want to ring out in the other at the same time I can use it.
*ANT:	Doug's got tha , a goo , a good system, which is another new one.It's it's part of the Star system.But he he's got a   (.) two lines on one phone
*GRA:	Mm.
*ANT:	and you only need a normal phone
*GRA:	Mm.
*ANT:	er, I suppose it's got one of those R buttons on
*GRA:	Ah yes!
*ANT:	but it's now   (.) erm, if the phone rings and he picks it up ah, er and he's talking to someone on the phone   (.) someone else tries to ring
*GRA:	Yes.
*ANT:	erm   (.) it won't be engaged, they will get a er er er, a erm voice saying   (.) erm   (.) the caller is on another call at the moment please hold the line
*ANN:	Mm.
*ANT:	and, you hear o this, er like three beeps   (.) and if you press the R it will hold wha , the conversation you're on
*GRA:	You're on an  (.) you can now go 
*ANT:	and you can speak to the other people, and then you switch back 
*GRA:	Mm, it's 
*ANT:	or, hang up and then the phone will ring and you'll get the other who's 
*GRA:	Mm.
*ANT:	there.It's quite clever.
*GRA:	But it could be annoying to the person holding on. ((laugh)) 
*ANT:	And they've got 
*GRA:	cos you've been answered so you start clocking up don't you, at that point?
*ANT:	And they've got a call barring system as well, as well , I like that! (.) Erm   (.) say, you ca , you can   (.) tap in a code
*GRA:	Yes.
*ANT:	and that phone will be useless, won't be able to ring out on it
*GRA:	Yeah.
*ANT:	or   (.) you can ha , tap another code in and it'll only make local calls   (.) and another code you can only make nationals 
*GRA:	Mm.Mm.
*ANT:	er , calls in this country   (.) and erm   (.) another code and it, you 
*GRA:	Mm.
*ANT:	can phone anywhere you like   (.) all over the world.
*GRA:	Yeah.Trouble is with this quarter, with this discount I'm probably   (.) not going to get to a hundred pound at the office because I've been using it at home so much.
*SAR:	Mm!
*GRA:	But I now get er er er, get an itemized bill from   (.) Telecom, so I'll be able 
*SAR:	Yeah.
*GRA:	to   (.) re-charge on the basis of what's been charged.
*ANT:	So what happens, say if you pho , phone the dirty phone numbers?
*GRA:	Th that'll be on.
*ANN:	That's right!
*ANT:	You can, you can find out.
*GRA:	Well I only did it out of curiosity basically to   (.) to see how much   (.) er, one spent in   (.) in calls with th , like Lyndsey in Hong Kong.
*ANT:	Yeah.
*GRA:	And I suppose it's almost
*ANT:	Mind you, that's pre , I've only ever known that 
*GRA:	fifty percent of your phone bill on most occasions.
*SAR:	The only 
*ANT:	Only on 
*SAR:	unusual calls we 
*ANT:	on 
*SAR:	make are er itemized.
*ANT:	on normal phone bills, but er the international calls   (.) international call they do.
*GRA:	Yeah.Well it only gives you units used though 
*ANT:	Yeah.
*GRA:	it doesn't   (.) tell you the number it went to.
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	And this does you see, you get it with the number.
*SAR:	Do you know all that now?
*GRA:	It's quite interesting that where you think you've   (.) you've rung say, Freda or Amber   (.) in the evening and you've had quite a lengthy conversation in, mentally you think that
*ANN:	Yeah.
*GRA:	and when the bill comes in you find it was only eighty six P or something like 
*SAR:	Yeah.
*GRA:	that.
*SAR:	You expect it to be more like three quid or something.
*GRA:	Yes tha that's right!
*ANT:	And, do you know now, from from Bournemouth   (.) erm 
*GRA:	That's er er, Antony 
*ANT:	frequently used   (.) trunk calls
*GRA:	there's some on the
*ANT:	frequently used trunk calls
*GRA:	Mm.
*ANT:	erm   (.) are not   (.) for example, if you phone   (.) London from Bournemouth it's not   (.) the same band as   (.) if you phoned   (.) erm 
*GRA:	That's right.
*ANT:	Brighton from Bournemouth
*GRA:	That's right.There are 
*ANT:	because it's 
*GRA:	numbers   (.) there are areas 
*ANT:	Yeah.
*GRA:	now aren't there?
*ANT:	It's   (.) London, Bristol, Yeovil   (.) where else was it?I wasn't really looking.But not from
*GRA:	Yes.
*ANT:	they don't do it from   (.) Banford, for example, that's 
*GRA:	Oh!
*ANT:	not the same   (.) exchange.
*GRA:	No.
*ANT:	It must be this new dish that's changed, it must be   (.) I dunno.Obviously some
*GRA:	I was interested too that   (.) got the new phonebooks
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	at work, and they got all the Mercury numbers in 
*SAR:	Yep!
*GRA:	as well.
*ANT:	Ours has got our mobile number in as well!
*GRA:	Has it?
*ANT:	Yeah.And it don't cost any more.
*GRA:	No, I know!
*ANT:	You could have one of the
*SAR:	Oh it should have a Mercury numbers in cos all they actually do is rent a B T line and pay for it.
*GRA:	Yes, I know , yes.
*SAR:	So
*GRA:	But th they they   (.) cheaper to use aren't 
*SAR:	Yes.

*SAR:	Local 
*GRA:	Yes.
*SAR:	calls are do 
*GRA:	Yes.
*SAR:	about three, four times as expensive

*SAR:	Yeah.
*ANT:	if you've got no B T lines.
*GRA:	Yes, it's only on erm   (.) trunk calls that you really
*SAR:	Mm.
*GRA:	score isn't it?
*ANT:	In fact, I think in Bournemouth you can actually make locals on Mercury now at the normal rate which is good!
*SAR:	Well you might be able to get long distance   (        ) 
*ANT:	I think it's all a bit complicated for me!I can't understand it all!
*GRA:	Well what used to be simple and straightforward now leaves you with th  (.) wondering whether you got the right card in your pocket 
*ANN:	Mm.
*GRA:	or something doesn't it?
*SAR:	Mm.We haven't had a phone call so it must be good!Mustn't it?
*ANN:	Are you going to explain this to them?
