*TON:	Yeah.
*JAC:	For I'm afraid my 
*TON:	I 
*JAC:	love there are, till it becomes automatic ,
*TON:	Mm .
*JAC:	it could take a little while.
*TON:	I pulled up fairly tight behind a car
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	and then I was trying to come out and I started to pull out into a gap and Brian said oh know, don't pull out   (.) I said oh okay, he said the thing is your fairly tight so your gonna have to come out slowly so you need a bigger gap than otherwise.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	And the gap wasn't really big enough, do you know what I mean?
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	It would off been o okay if I just been able to pull out and drive down the road
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	because I had to pull out round the stationery vehicle as well, I would off taken too long getting out
*JAC:	Yeah.
*TON:	and I'd have caused the other one to slow down.
