*DAV:	That shows you how long our tank is, it's the other side. •537892_543412•
*CHR:	Don't you think it would reach? •544512_553572•
*DAV:	Well it probably would, but I got to  anyway. •554372_556822•
*CHR:	Yes  What's that? •563472_564392•
        That's an unleaded only pump I think. •564532_566302•
*DAV:	Oh it's premium, it's premium unleaded. •566632_568152•
*CHR:	Yes. •569172_569332•
*DAV:	Mind you they talk about premium don't they? •569332_571202•
*CHR:	You save a few more coppers don't you? •572382_574272•
*DAV:	Yes, you do. •574272_575092•
*CHR:	Forty five point four, I'll, I'll sort this out in a minute, I don't normally have this trouble at the station. •575402_581272•
        Ah, I can't see what  •581742_582512•
*DAV:	It's the same price as the other one, so, presumably it's the same stuff. •583492_586862•
*CHR:	Ah well. •586862_587392•
*DAV:	Yes, yep,. •588652_589382•
        It's the B S seventy seven premium, it's very small letters, I don't think it's anything different. •590982_595032•
