*AMY:	Hello  (.) 
*HEL:	Hello how what do you think?
*AMY:	It's nice.
*HEL:	It goes on a lot better than Amy's.
*AMY:	Does it?
*HEL:	Yeah. (.) Do you like their suit.
*AMY:	What?
*HEL:	Do you like their shell suit?
*AMY:	Like whose?
*HEL:	Deborah's and Catherine's? (.) 
*AMY:	Am I sleeping in here?
*HEL:	Yeah.
*AMY:	Or not up there?
*HEL:	Yeah, I mean wallpaper, you don't have to stay away from it.Didn't you, I mean, it's not like paint.There what d'you think?Gone up quite well.
*AMY:	Pardon?
*HEL:	It's gone up quite well.
*AMY:	Yeah.You can see the joins though  (        ) .
*HEL:	Well you won't so much when it's dried.
*AMY:	Hm.
*HEL:	You can't see them very well. (        ) .
*AMY:	You've still got the tape recorder on.
*HEL:	I know   (.) Oh I've got to get these tapes used up.
*AMY:	All of them?
*HEL:	Oh no, I don't think I should use all of them, about half of them I should think.
*AMY:	Ten, how many you on?
*HEL:	Seven I think.
*AMY:	Eight, (        ) eight.
*HEL:	Does it?Oh well, I'm on eight, I've done seven.I've only got to do it to the end of today so, I don't think I'm going to use twenty do you?
*AMY:	No.
*HEL:	Oh, fed up with this aren't you?
*AMY:	Hm   (.) What's   (        ) doing in my  (        ) .
*HEL:	He's written Clare's room, wallpapered on the first of June, that's a bit optimistic, by Helen and Alistair.
*AMY:	I   (        ) done that writing.
*HEL:	Probably.What daddy's like. (.) Anyway makes it look a little smarter doesn't it, than with a green carpet, it'll look nice, yes.
*AMY:	I can't choose another carpet can I?
*HEL:	No.It looks better all the same colour instead of some walls green, some walls white.
*AMY:	Yeah.
*HEL:	So I assume Half a Sixpence is finished.Was it good?
*AMY:	Yeah.
*HEL:	Quite a nice film.
*AMY:	It's a weird story.
*HEL:	I had to do that for O'level.
*AMY:	What?
*HEL:	That story.
*AMY:	Writing?
*HEL:	No I had to study the book.
*AMY:	Why?
*HEL:	Well for English literature they set you so many books to study, that was one of them. (        ) a stupid book .
*AMY:	 (        ) questions .
*HEL:	Yes, from all the characters and
*AMY:	Pardon.
*HEL:	From all the characters and how they fitted into the story.
*AMY:	Did you pass?
*HEL:	Only just  ((laugh)) .I don't like that book at all, it was a book.
*AMY:	What other books are there?
*HEL:	You have a Shakespeare play, you had Silas Marner I think I quite liked that one.I had one of J-   (.) uhum, oh I can't remember his name, another play.George Bernard Shaw.
*AMY:	Hm, (        ) .
*HEL:	Thought that was fairly silly as well.That was four, I think that was probably all I had, two books, two plays, it's quite enough.
*AMY:	What're you having for dinner?
*HEL:	Chicken casserole, and you can have a little bit.
*AMY:	 (        ) .
*HEL:	Well you look better than you did, you've got some colour in your face now.
*AMY:	I'll have a tiny bit.
*HEL:	You can have a little bit of something to eat  (.) 
*AMY:	Hopefully I'll be better tomorrow.
*HEL:	I hope so poppet. (.) Hope to get you back to school on Monday, it seems awful if you've had a week off and then your not well.
*AMY:	Yeah.
*HEL:	This was all a bit sudden, I though you were better.
*AMY:	Hm   (.) Have you finished yet?
*HEL:	Well I need daddy to a   (.) start along there  ((yawn)) .
*AMY:	Why can't you?
*HEL:	Well the light has got to come off and you've got to drop a perpendicular so that you know, cut the paper straight, it helps if you put it up straight instead of wonky.
