*CHR:	You see they've quoted C Freight, New York to Bombay, and it probably includes F O B New York on fifty tons, twenty thousand six hundred and fifty five U S dollars, now that is over four hundred dollars per ton, know that sounds generous to me Lynda. •232854_235252•
*LYN:	When you think you can go all the way from here to New Zealand for what, what was it? •235300_235939•
*CHR:	Well, well  •235947_235981•
*LYN:	Ninety pounds . •235981_236091•
*CHR:	Remember that you've got some fairly chunky stuff here, you've got some pieces which weigh an awful lot, where's the  •236094_236761•
*LYN:	You'd you'd think the . •236761_236858•
*CHR:	I'm talking by ton, yeah. •236962_237052•
*LYN:	Yeah, but what difference do you, do you think there might be a premium to pay for . •237140_237485•
*CHR:	Heavy chunks, er there's no way you're going to get some of this stuff into big big boxes erm, and I mean some of it, there's one piece here eight point nine metres long. •237488_238532•
        Nine point six metres long, it's heavy and it's awkward. •238952_239456•
        Seven, two fifty millimetres long, six point eight metres long, and when it's seven point two five metres by three point eight five metres, that's sixteen feet by thirty two feet, ehm, and it's thirteen millimetres thick, it ain't half gonna weigh.. •239627_241504•
*LYN:	. •_•
        You  you  need  need  more  more than one man to pick it up. •241746_242011•
*CHR:	Yes, I mean that's well over three tonnes a piece. •242024_242263•
        Jolly good eh. •242583_242705•
*LYN:	I'd be  actually move it . •242854_243168•
        Well if that's their estimate, if it's possible that they're right, have you already then?. •243609_244128•
*CHR:	I queried it, I mean she gave me a precise figure of twenty thousand, and six hundred and fifty five something or other. •244215_244706•
*LYN:	But you haven't reduced that too . •244717_244919•
*CHR:	Well I actually went back and said I don't think it's going to cost anything, I told him original twenty four thou-, and I've halved it too about twelve thou. •245002_245788•
*LYN:	Twenty. •245843_245879•
*CHR:	Twelve thou, you see, I'm just wondering whether I should quote on a C I F basis  which I can do you see, on the basis of, this if I add it up . •245920_247295•
*LYN:	. •_•
*CHR:	You see, it's another five per cent. •249041_249151•
