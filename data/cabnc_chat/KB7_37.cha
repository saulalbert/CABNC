        Really. •149416_149428•
*STU:	Really  at all er  apart from the  moral support. •149528_149932•
*ANN:	Moral support  well you need that other stuff first  •149973_150281•
*STU:	 (        )

*ANN:	No well I'll go with you, if you want. •150409_150513•
*STU:	It isn't very long  Shouldn't be in there long  just a matter of signing all the things, checking all the  details over, putting in what he hasn't filled in already. •150513_152172•
*ANN:	And I'm hoping that they get that letter, you seeing them  weekend . •152172_152603•
*STU:	Yes. •152810_152816•
*ANN:	And you're not working Saturday morning, instead of going to work  late we can go a bit early and  do a bit of shopping ourselves. •152819_153984•
*STU:	Go to town next Thursday  •153984_154421•
*ANN:	Before Monday. •154421_154480•
*STU:	Thursday morning can't you? •154522_154915•
*ANN:	Don't know if I could do the electric one  definitely  Guess that's about whether the   I'd like one of them, one of them and  yeah but we don't know when it can be delivered, so we can't do it that early  you can't say yeah but  but er we'll let you know, well we can  so  it's there  that's what we wish, they'd  the bills go and we'll let you know when you can be  the keys can be available for you to put it in. •154916_157578•
*STU:	And so the  Can't  first . •157578_157795•
*ANN:	Mm, I know. •157795_157885•
*STU:	That's the first job  first one in   then you  get the carpet sorted out. •157886_158559•
*ANN:	Yeah cos it's much easier than dragging all   •158582_158788•
*STU:	At least at least you know how  you know  if he says you can have this one or this one  yeah cos the choice between one or the other  and he says well I can fit this one immediately, but, this one I've gotta order. •158868_159828•
*ANN:	They've gotta send for. •159829_159927•
*STU:	I mean it might  might just sway as to one way or the other if there's a bit of a  well we like them both, but which one, you know? •159981_160996•
*ANN:	I don't wanna get carpets without you with me  cos you have to live with them as well. •160996_161308•
*STU:	I can have a look at them, now  in the catalogue. •161320_161799•
*ANN:	Yeah but they won't be exactly the same in shops. •161799_162019•
*STU:	No, true. •162019_162325•
*ANN:	Similar but not the same. •162325_162468•
*STU:	No not the same, that's true. •162468_162601•
        Mind you I suppose out of a catalogue it's  at least you can feel them and see them  all that. •162601_163027•
*ANN:	Oh and I'd rather •163027_163145•
*STU:	Only on   see the whole roll. •163145_163362•
*ANN:	I'd rather go in the shop and see it  cos sometimes, especially if it's got a pattern on  turn out to be better than the catalogue  cos when it comes, it don't look the same, and then the same colour do you? •163363_164503•
        Cos a  reproduction's never  perfect is it? •164503_164735•
*STU:	No. •164735_164742•
*ANN:	In a photograph it's never  true  then you go in a shop and what you see is what you get. •164742_166549•
*STU:	Definitely  There's only a, there's only really  what two carpets  and these are    •166899_167273•
*ANN:	carpet   •167284_167294•
*STU:	two main bit. •167294_167496•
*ANN:	for a bathroom, I mean  neither were very good. •167496_167715•
*STU:	Yeah but then again  yeah but as I say if you  if you want the same in the bathroom and the bedroom  •167715_168134•
*ANN:	Well I don't  •168178_168240•
*STU:	and the same in the hall in the living room •168262_168400•
*ANN:	So two colours. •168400_168510•
*STU:	you only got two carpets to sort out  and a bit of lino  rather than having a different one with this one and a  different one for that one and then  a different one for •168510_169712•
*ANN:	Yeah, I'll go and put that  together those •169712_169909•
*STU:	Alright. •169993_170011•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	Alright dear. •170011_•
