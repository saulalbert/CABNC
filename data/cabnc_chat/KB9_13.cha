*UNK:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	You feel you've wasted a lot of years  probably   
*UNK:	 Yeah.

*TRA:	Just being ordinary and 
*UNK:	Yeah! 
*TRA:	You know sort of  
*UNK:	 Yeah! 
*ANN:	 Yeah! 
*UNK:	George had no affection in him, I found that out. 
*ANN:	Really? 
*UNK:	No affection. 
*ANN:	Now you surprise me cos I would have thought cos you   (.) always went round holding hands and  looked so happy. 
*UNK:	 Not with George  wouldn't have hold your hand. Wouldn't have touched you! 
*ANN:	Oh? 
*UNK:	No! No way! The most affection you got from George was a pat on head! 
*ANN:	 ((laughing)) Oh crumbs ! ((laugh))   
*UNK:	 Oh no, you see   he used to say about   
*TRA:	  (  )  
*UNK:	people that held hands. He used to be quite    (.)   (  )   
*ANN:	 Yeah! 
*UNK:	about people. 
*TRA:	Oh! I see    (  )   (  )   
*UNK:	 Yeah!  Yeah! 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	See it's funny, he used to think all people just, he used to say, oh he's doing that for show. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*UNK:	He'd never had affection so he couldn't give it. 
*ANN:	No. No. 
*UNK:	You know, but   
*ANN:	 No. 
*UNK:	I used to make allowances for the way he was brought  up. 
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*UNK:	He was brought up with his grandma and that.  Well I   
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*UNK:	thought he's never had affection. 
*TRA:	No. People of that age, it's like David's grandma they don't know what affection   (.)  means. 
*ANN:	 No! 
*UNK:	 No! 
*ANN:	They say we're daft for showing our affection. 
*UNK:	Yeah. But you should do. I only just realized that. Well it's taken me a long time to even be able to give affection. 
*ANN:	Yeah.  I'm sure. 
*UNK:	 When you're  not used to it  it's   
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*UNK:	funny! 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	You know. 
*ANN:	Oh I think it's all  part of it. 
*UNK:	 Oh! Dennis has got more  in his little finger than  George   
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*UNK:	had in his body! 
*ANN:	Well, I think it's   (.) but I mean, we can, I can honestly say never go er past we always tell each other we love  each other. 
*UNK:	 Yeah! 
*ANN:	And I think you should. 
*UNK:	You should!  Yeah. 
*ANN:	 Even  my dad.  I give   
*UNK:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	my dad an odd cuddle now and again, I'll say   
*UNK:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	I love you.  You   
*UNK:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	know. 
*TRA:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	 I mean it's just, yeah   
*UNK:	 Well George wasn't like that.  He wasn't like  it   
*ANN:	 Well   
*UNK:	he was a man's man through and through.  Too much   
*ANN:	 I think   
*UNK:	so. 
*ANN:	I think life's too short, and I think as you're getting older you realize, I mean   (.)  like losing my mum   
*UNK:	 Now he's worse   
*ANN:	i   
*UNK:	he's worse now is George, well I should say worse or better, now you see he'll cry now.

*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*UNK:	that's it. You know, that's it 
*ANN:	Yeah.

*TRA:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Yeah, we were saying I bet George really  regrets   
*UNK:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	what he's done. 
*UNK:	But you see him, cos he won't register as an alcoholic, he won't 
*ANN:	No. 
*UNK:	won't help himself. 
*ANN:	No. 
*UNK:	You know. He  thinks he   
*ANN:	 It's a  shame innit?
