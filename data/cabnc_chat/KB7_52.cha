*STU:	 (        )  (.) 
*ANN:	What have you lost?
*STU:	I can't find the car keys.
*ANN:	Oh we won't go far without them.
*STU:	Took them back in  (.) 
*ANN:	I lock the door   (.) you lock them in? (.) on your knee.
*STU:	I must of had them on my lap and normally put it straight to the ignition.
*ANN:	And off we'd jolly well go.Broke my nail   (        ) look at that.
*STU:	Oh dear you   (        )  (.) 
*ANN:	It looks horrid doesn't it? (.) I caught it on a   (.) rack in the  (        ) 
*STU:	Nasty, nasty, nasty.
*ANN:	It was hanging on so I had to take it off    (        )  (.) they are a bloody nuisance them racks you know, dangerous
*STU:	Are they? (.) 
*ANN:	It's a wonder people haven't had serious injuries from them really.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Don't know we get away with it   (.) they want the whole lot bloody scrapping and the new lot   (.) all the rust ones, there's hardly one decent   (        ) is there?
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	Chucked all the duff ones out  (        ) 
*ANN:	At least, yeah, I should think nine tenths of them would go, very    (        )  (.) there's yesterday's winner darling.
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	Still trotting along  ((laugh)) .
*STU:	That's where all my horses go.
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (.) I got   (        ) ride on a horse, poor horse with me on it  (        ) 
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	There's heavier people than me that ride  (        ) , jump jockeys are nearly as heavy as me that ride.
*STU:	That's true   (.) true, (        ) not that
*ANN:	No, she's
*STU:	that er she's not 
*ANN:	She's not fat but she's a big lady like me.
*STU:	She's   (        ) same sort of weight as you?
*ANN:	Yeah   (.) yeah, she's a big   (        ) lady like me, solid.
*STU:	Tall isn't she?
*ANN:	Yeah    (.)  (        ) jockeys are eleven stone aren't they, er jump jockeys   (        ) jump jockeys are  (.) 
*STU:	All the weight and that are   (        ) aren't they?
*ANN:	Yeah, (        ) and going over jumps and god knows what else which one's    (        )  (.) quite a way really isn't it? (.) it's quite comfortable eleven, eleven and a half, eleven stone over jumps innit?
*STU:	Ten stone's  (        ) 
*ANN:	Is it?
*STU:	Ten stone is   (        ) race, why I  (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) do they have   (        ) weights   (        ) do they   (        ) jump jockeys, (        )  (.) 
*STU:	Some time you get a   (        ) to carry ten stone, he's got seven pound   (        ) from, so carries nine stone seven  (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) ten stones about   (        ) twelve stone    (        )  (.) it certainly is a  (        ) 
*ANN:	I think I quite enjoy a ride   (.) yeah  (        ) .Did you like horses, you don't fancy getting on the back of one?
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	Oh, thought you would. (        ) you are a large, but
*STU:	Yes, what I'm saying, yeah whatever cart horse 
*ANN:	Especially this one it does say, it will have to be a bloody great stallion wouldn't it? (.) but er, (        ) I think it will be quite enjoyable.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        )  (.) Wash the curtains today in the pub   (.) Oh god, I got a frog in me throat.
*STU:	 (        )  (.) 
*ANN:	Where you going to park? (.) 
*STU:	 (        )  (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	No, (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	I can't understand why people who do, who work in town don't use that one really.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Pardon.
*STU:	I doubt they do as well.
*ANN:	Oh I don't know, cos there's a hell of a lot of people parking, same cars in that multi-storey in there.
*STU:	Let's have a look then.
*ANN:	 (        ) can if you want, in the   (        ) it's not that far to go around and   (        ) use one for the whole day.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Pardon.
*STU:	 (        ) I suppose.
*ANN:	Yeah, that gets pretty full weekends but   (        ) I don't like that one   (.) every week in The Standard there's always a, you know, this break in, that break in and
*STU:	When you park your car you've got the   (        ) breaking in.
*ANN:	I know, but that one seems worse than anywhere, isn't it, every week you know stolen out of the   (        ) car park   (.) car broken into, I mean who's, I can't imagine with all them cars in there that nobody ever seems to see anything.
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	Or they do, and turn a blind eye.
*STU:	Quite often that happens late at night, doesn't it, you know
*ANN:	Yeah
*STU:	after chucking out time.
*ANN:	I think a lot of people are just, you know, I'm not getting involved in them, they might belt me one, walk away, anyway you can't blame them, sad, people can't, people can't say it were you and your boy, you know, leave that, leave that alone or else I'll go and get a policeman, the fear of them
*STU:	Young
*ANN:	belting them one.
*STU:	go and get a policeman, time you've gone and got a policeman they're off 
*ANN:	They're gone 
*STU:	you know, so, there's no
*ANN:	seen so much of it that it, that somebody will see some of it   (.) but then, well maybe there, and he didn't really erm, you know, you get out of it quick.
*STU:	Turn a blind eye don't they?
*ANN:	Yeah, cos they don't want to get involved and they're frightened of the consequences.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) more police statements and probably hours   (        ) police stations
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	that to find out that you shopped them they just as liable to put a brick through your window, or belt you one, or damage your car next time they see it.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	So you can't blame people in that respect really.
*STU:	So it's, if you want to get it done this will be one hell of a big car park won't it?
*ANN:	Yep.
*STU:	If only  (        ) 
*ANN:	That's er, quite full dear.
