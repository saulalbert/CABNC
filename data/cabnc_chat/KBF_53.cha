*LEE:	With I don't think so. •568295_569935•
*BRE:	No. •569935_570245•
        For one thing I don't want to pick up with people like Joe  again or Jean . •570245_576261•
        They're part of a life that's completely over. •576693_579793•
*LEE:	Different isn't it? •579853_580423•
*BRE:	And totally different outlook interests. •580423_583363•
        No I think either Guildford . •584213_585633•
*LEE:	I think Guildford . •585633_586313•
*BRE:	Ideal for me. •586313_587773•
        Cause it's got the University and evening classes and all the rest of it. •588083_593813•
        Well it's a city well isn't actually is it? •593813_596383•
        It's a town and Neil would get more chance  •596383_598713•
*LEE:	Neil would get more chance in working. •598713_600963•
        Yeah. •601063_601273•
*BRE:	Because you know there's a lot more going on in Guildford. •602793_606183•
        Mind you I mean what I think Woking's going to be a lot more for youngsters. •606573_611213•
        We've got the bowling alley opening in in February. •611213_614053•
*LEE:	Yes  •614563_614963•
*BRE:	I don't know what kids would be able to afford it. •617193_619053•
        So what age what age is it going to apply. •619053_621173•
*LEE:	You see this business of Neil staying in bed all day. •621173_623053•
        Part of it is that   interests. •623613_626873•
        Except his karate but then he hasn't got the money to follow things up anyway. •626873_634653•
*BRE:	No  I always think I mean it it just annoys me though I think  I get well I just get I just think it's a waste of the day. •634653_649823•
*LEE:	Well it is but I musn't let it annoy me Brenda because in a way he must know what he's doing. •650213_657243•
*BRE:	Well that's it. •657283_658463•
        I mean  •658533_658763•
*LEE:	He's probably used staying in bed as his escape. •658953_665743•
*BRE:	Oh that's it cause you won't be so bored will you. •665743_668313•
*LEE:	Got away from your mother and •668313_669713•
*BRE:	The fact you're sleeping you're not thinking about it. •669713_672293•
*LEE:	That's right. •672293_672523•
        That's right. •672523_673593•
*BRE:	And you know you try and sort of block things out. •673593_675663•
        It's just a sort of mental •675663_676933•
*LEE:	Yes yes •676933_677303•
*BRE:	escape really. •677303_678303•
        It's a sort of block out  •678383_679463•
*LEE:	I know that Pam Palmer said of one of her friends whose husband who's having he didn't like his work. •679463_689043•
        He's not happy. •689043_691693•
        And she said er Angela said to her oh poor Neil has to stays in bed until one o'clock every Saturday and then on Sunday he has a  he gets up late and then he has a long rest in the afternoon and Pam said to me he's copping out. •691693_708523•
*BRE:	Mm. •708663_708753•
*LEE:	As you see Jerry who was at ease with  when he  like everybody and there were times when his job got him down. •711653_721873•
        But his attitude  he'd been taught to get on and do things so that he would be painting the back of the house or going on with his hobby or doing jobs on the car. •721923_732883•
        He would just do them. •732883_736713•
        Well you've got to get on with it haven't you? •736713_741623•
*LEE:	Yes. •741953_742033•
*BRE:	You can't you know. •742163_744163•
        I'd be interested to know whether Neil did that list of things I asked him to do. •744923_749543•
*LEE:	Like what? •749663_751453•
*BRE:	Well I asked him to bring the dust bins in. •751553_753763•
        Empty the dishwasher erm  with Paul's help to re-hang the curtains. •753763_763863•
        You know that my big the curtains to the patio? •763913_768003•
        You know they're on brown rings with little little tiny screw screwed in metal rings in the brown things? •768003_778123•
*LEE:	Hm. •778173_778493•
*BRE:	And you thread them on the curtains through this little metal ring. •778953_783213•
        Well those have started to come away. •783213_785413•
        Now you can't just replace them. •785413_788343•
        You've got to take the whole down. •788863_791073•
        You've got to lift the whole lot off the wall and unthread the curtains and put back the right number of rings and hooks and it's a palaver and I haven't done it. •791073_800653•
        I took the thing down but I haven't put it back. •800763_802773•
        So I said the rings are in the top drawer of the bureau in the garage. •802773_807553•
        If you go and get them get Paul to help you to remount the whole thing. •807553_812223•
        It needs somebody with  or whatever you see. •812223_815843•
*LEE:	Mm. •815843_815913•
*BRE:	There's that to do. •815983_817723•
        And what else was there? •818783_819913•
        Oh I asked him to go to the insurance company and find out whether I'm covered with them for having my aerial replaced and I wrote a letter asking if he could be empowered to sign the claim form for me  •819913_830613•
*BRE:	Now I wonder whether he managed to do it? •830613_831643•
*LEE:	Did you leave him a note? •831673_832103•
        Or did you just ask him to do it? •832103_835783•
*BRE:	I wrote it down. •836063_836303•
        I wrote it all down I asked him as I wrote it down. •836303_837393•
*LEE:	What did he say? •837393_837783•
*BRE:	Well because he was half at the time it was just before I left at about nine to come down here you see. •837783_841603•
*LEE:	Mm. •841603_841663•
*BRE:	Having said that you don't know whether •841663_842493•
*LEE:	You don't know •842493_843213•
*BRE:	How he's feeling at the moment. •843223_843843•
*LEE:	No no. •844513_844753•
*BRE:	Oh I do know how he's feeling. •844753_846373•
        He's feeling he's feeling defeated. •846383_847173•
*LEE:	Well now  •847173_847693•
*BRE:	That's it. •847693_848063•
        I mean the thing is. •848073_848643•
        You try not to you know I mean. •848643_849543•
        You think to yourself oh well. •849543_850143•
        You know things will get better you just feel  Oh God! •850193_852073•
        I've been through this •887603_888093•
*LEE:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	That's right. •889413_890213•
        Every slightest thing is very dramatic to me. •890223_892163•
*LEE:	Yes yes at the moment. •892163_893043•
*BRE:	Where you know I would just take things in my stride. •893743_900103•
        But the slightest thing is so stupid . •900433_904063•
        When I went to that stress management course we were told to use physical resources like deep breathing and actually making yourself sit down and making yourself go floppy. •904233_932613•
        and let every muscle let it relax. •932733_936723•
        That was a power   . •936723_937773•
        That's  a week or so. •937773_958283•
*LEE:	Oh marvellous. •958283_959103•
*BRE:	When I first when I was first driving in the early 1970's you could park in the quarry car park any time you fancied except the few days before Christmas. •959103_975573•
*LEE:	Don't they charge you? •975673_978523•
*BRE:	Oh you you you paid but you could always get a place there  I could remember a lot of parking time when I wasn't driving. •978523_988573•
        As near enough all three parks were full. •988583_991233•
*LEE:	Yes those days are over. •991233_992753•
*BRE:	again. •994973_995023•
        They're meant to last three  two. •995023_101098•
*LEE:	Oh. •101098_101107•
*BRE:	Trees are lovely in that little   •101112_101209•
*BRE:	There are a lot Carla she is so tired. •101209_102483•
*LEE:	Yes. •102497_102521•
*BRE:	Cause on a Friday night  all week she's in and Thursday night Friday night Saturday and Sunday it's all like rehearsals for the Sound of Music. •102521_103612•
*LEE:	Yes yes  Are you going to slacken down the dancing a bit when she's in secondary school? •103614_104644•
*BRE:	Er well we'll see how she goes. •104644_105006•
        The thing is I mean. •105006_105182•
*LEE:	Like when she's in the first two classes it won't matter so but as she'll approach the G C S C •105211_105804•
*BRE:	Yeah but I think now as she's so advanced in her dance •105813_106323•
*LEE:	She is she's well on. •106358_106474•
*BRE:	The fact is now I mean where like two years ago she was taking two and three exams at a time. •106479_107065•
        Now  it's just one sort of a year. •107065_107313•
*LEE:	Yes yes. •107313_107339•
*BRE:	Where it was twice or three times in a year. •107339_107756•
        But now I think they don't many so it's not you know  this up to sort of like thirteen they've been taught  constantly once to that age. •107756_109067•
        I mean she's still you know less bothered about the older ones but it's very sort of because of the school work and Saturday jobs and •109076_109932•
*LEE:	Mm yes •109936_110008•
*BRE:	and all that I mean you know they're not they don't have to be as committed •110026_110404•
*LEE:	No no. •110445_110502•
*BRE:	When they're sort of younger •110570_110737•
*LEE:	Mm mm. •110744_110789•
*BRE:	Well she'll she'll I mean. •110789_111188•

*LEE:	No. •112535_112564•
        I think •112564_112590•
*BRE:	No. •112590_112596•
        I mean it's about I mean you know I mean it's like today I mean Jeannie  said oh well you come with us shopping if you don't want to go dancing. •112605_113546•
        You know I gave her the ultimatum like you can come with us but damn well I wouldn't have let her come. •113546_114029•
*LEE:	No no. •114037_114124•
*BRE:	You know I mean I sort  •114148_114241•
*LEE:	You  yes •114241_114305•
*BRE:	But I mean the fact is there's no way she's got she gets the idea •114305_114633•
*LEE:	You didn't hear me saying oh golly I'd love to have her come with us? •114633_114903•
*BRE:	No that's it because  •114910_114992•

*BRE:	The fact is she's she's dedicated to her dancing. •115074_115454•
        So •115531_115539•
*LEE:	Mm she must be at this stage. •115545_115776•
*BRE:	you know there's no ifs and buts skiving off because she wants to do something else. •115776_116185•
        I mean the other week she wanted to go to a school disco and I said look hang on n get your priorities right. •116185_116680•
        And I said okay and I said to her dance teacher in front of her she wants to go to a disco. •116686_117273•
        And she said to her  she said er her teacher said to her oh you know do you  what you were doing. •117273_118257•
