Clare (PS0E9)              [6] I'm not.
Helen (PS0E8)              [7] You just tip it carefully ... that will do for
                           the time being and eat those first
Clare (PS0E9)              [...] ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [8] I don't feel we've done a lot this half term
                           have we?
Clare (PS0E9)              [9] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [10] I don't think we've done much this half term.

Amy (PS0EA)                [16] Oi!
Clare (PS0E9)              [laugh]
Helen (PS0E8)              [17] Jenny's didn't come out very well.
Amy (PS0EA)                [18] Didn't she?
Helen (PS0E8)              [19] No couldn't really ... hear very well.
Amy (PS0EA)                [20] Will I listen?
Helen (PS0E8)              [21] No not now I'm going to put it away.
Amy (PS0EA)                [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [22] Well it's not so easy when they're further away
                           is it? ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [23] That'll have a nice sound with you eating

Clare (PS0E9)              [31] Well if daddy goes back up to work tomorrow I
                           think we might go out to London.
                           [32] You've booked Taff haven't you?

*** 2 (Tape 004702) ***
Unknown speaker (KCDPSUNK) [34] I wasn't really expecting to go into Jenny's.
Clare (PS0E9)              [35] No ... I suppose she felt pretty awful about
                           not inviting Amy to the party.
Helen (PS0E8)              [36] Yes.
                           [37] She might do.
Amy (PS0EA)                [38] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [39] I don't think she expected a present ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [40] Why why didn't she?
Helen (PS0E8)              [41] Well I think that Amy didn't go to Lucy's party
                           I think
Amy (PS0EA)                [42] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [43] I think if you didn't go to Lucy's party I
                           don't think.
                           [44] Jenny was expecting a present.
                           [45] From what's come in.
                           [46] She looked a bit surprised didn't she?
Clare (PS0E9)              [47] Yes hmm
Helen (PS0E8)              [48] You know ... she'd rather do Chimneys or
                           something tomorrow than London Zoo.
Amy (PS0EA)                [49] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [50] We rather go to Chimney's tomorrow than to
                           London Zoo.
Clare (PS0E9)              [51] Oh.
                           [52] I was asking.
Helen (PS0E8)              [53] Would you?
Clare (PS0E9)              [54] Probably.
Amy (PS0EA)                [55] Yeah.
                           [56] [...] to London Zoo.
Helen (PS0E8)              [57] Don't you like London Zoo particularly?
Amy (PS0EA)                [58] I don't ... Clare doesn't really like going
                           round all the creatures do you?
Clare (PS0E9)              [59] What?
Amy (PS0EA)                [60] Would you like go [...] .
Clare (PS0E9)              [61] Might not be right.
                           [62] I would quite like to go to Chimneys actually.
                           [63] It's not too far aways.
Helen (PS0E8)              [64] No it's easier.
                           [65] But it's easier if you got tact.
Clare (PS0E9)              [66] Why [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [67] It's easier if you've got tact tomorrow
Clare (PS0E9)              [68] Mm ... Why?
Helen (PS0E8)              [69] Well ... because tac doesn't finish till till
                           half past twelve.
Clare (PS0E9)              [70] Don't you [...] got one of those [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [71] Don't know how they've decided whose has got
                           one.
Amy (PS0EA)                [72] Decide what?
Clare (PS0E9)              [73] Could be just our way.
Helen (PS0E8)              [74] I don't know how they decided who's got one ...

Clare (PS0E9)              [75] Do you think it's worth twenty five pounds?
Helen (PS0E8)              [76] [laugh] That must be it ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [77] You can't get too many people doing it unless
                           Marks and Spencers [...] free.
Helen (PS0E8)              [78] I don't think Marks and Spencers will give them
                           free.
Clare (PS0E9)              [79] Twenty five pounds? ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [80] Did you like Amy's ... suit?
Amy (PS0EA)                [81] Not very much but I [...]
Clare (PS0E9)              [82] Do you know what you can wear underneath it?
Helen (PS0E8)              [83] I think you're supposed to wear a T-shirt.
Clare (PS0E9)              [84] It's a bit cold.
Helen (PS0E8)              [85] Hmm. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [86] I was just reading that.
Clare (PS0E9)              [87] Peter.
None (PS1KL)               [88] Huh?
Helen (PS0E8)              [89] Who did Eve have on her plate ... Amy?
Amy (PS0EA)                [90] Mrs Tiggywickle.
Helen (PS0E8)              [91] Who did Eve have on her plate?
Clare (PS0E9)              [92] Plate?
                           [93] Mrs Tiggywinkle.
Helen (PS0E8)              [94] Mrs Tiggywinkle did she?
Amy (PS0EA)                [95] I was telling her what it said.
Helen (PS0E8)              [96] You haven't done any
Amy (PS0EA)                [97] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [98] You haven't done any reading have you?
                           [99] ... You'd better read a chapter before we go
                           out this afternoon.
Amy (PS0EA)                [100] He's got a musical test which says don't
                           they're tired they're tired and then he said the pig
                           says I'm not [laugh] and then the people said Oh
                           dear and then he said I'm hungry and then they said
                           they're hungry and he says I'm not and he's sleepy
                           [laugh] .
                           [101] I don't like [...] story.
                           [102] [cough] She read that to me.
                           [103] [cough] It was quite easy um I read it again
                           to her ... .
                           [104] It was quite a good reason really.
Helen (PS0E8)              [105] Well I think Jenny's um sort of
Amy (PS0EA)                [106] We've never had hardly seen it before because
                           I haven't lawn in that book before have I?
Helen (PS0E8)              [107] You haven't had what?
Amy (PS0EA)                [108] Lawn.
Helen (PS0E8)              [109] Ah.
                           [110] ... The word you mean?
Amy (PS0EA)                [111] Yes.
Helen (PS0E8)              [112] Ah.
                           [113] Perhaps not.
Amy (PS0EA)                [114] Pardon?
                           [115] Oh is that in her book?
Helen (PS0E8)              [116] You could read it could you?
Amy (PS0EA)                [117] Mm.
                           [118] But if I just she said lawn so I knew what it
                           said.
Helen (PS0E8)              [laugh]
Amy (PS0EA)                [119] But she made it first than me.
                           [120] ... I've been through quite a lot.
Helen (PS0E8)              [121] Mm.
                           [122] Yes you're doing quite well
Amy (PS0EA)                [123] I've got two [...]
Clare (PS0E9)              [124] Said long words like that kept using very long
                           words.
                           [125] Like I shall excavate this house.
Helen (PS0E8)              [126] [laugh] I hope not.
Clare (PS0E9)              [127] [...] you aught to use long words.
Helen (PS0E8)              [128] That's probably what they want to know.
                           [129] Which words you do use.
Clare (PS0E9)              [130] Can't remember [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [131] In conversation. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [132] You going to take it to Jenny's with you
                           tomorrow?
Helen (PS0E8)              [133] I suppose so.
                           [134] I suppose we'd better take it wherever we go.
Amy (PS0EA)                [135] Yeah you can just [...] about it [...] .
Helen (PS0E8)              [136] They can hear what you're saying now.
Amy (PS0EA)                [137] Yes I can hear everyone.
Helen (PS0E8)              [138] It only picks
Clare (PS0E9)              [139] Hello! ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [140] Stop it.
Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [141] No.
                           [142] Stop it.
                           [143] Not, well just behave.
                           [144] You shouldn't have done.
                           [145] Doesn't make it any better if you messed about
                           ... it picked up what I said but it didn't pick up
                           very well what Jenny said.
Clare (PS0E9)              [146] Yep.
                           [147] But what I said.
Helen (PS0E8)              [148] Don't know.
                           [149] I didn't listen listen to
Amy (PS0EA)                [150] A bit better
Helen (PS0E8)              [151] I think it takes you forty five minutes to
                           listen to it all back again.
Clare (PS0E9)              [152] Yeah. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [153] Is Jenny quite happy at the moment she's going
                           to [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [154] I don't think she's much choice has she?
Amy (PS0EA)                [155] She hasn't got much of a choice for what?
Helen (PS0E8)              [156] Where Amy's going or you've got to go there
                           and you ... think of the positive [...] ... When's
                           their they've had their open day or is there another
                           one?
Clare (PS0E9)              [157] Don't know.
Clare (PS0E9)              [158] Thank you.
                           [159] ... Don't know quite what that was. ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [160] I should think that was [...]
Clare (PS0E9)              [161] What?
Helen (PS0E8)              [162] I should think they'll have another one nearer
                           the end of term.
Clare (PS0E9)              [163] Oh yes. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [164] [...] people.
                           [165] She only has other people to her house.
Helen (PS0E8)              [166] Well she only had a small party didn't she?
Clare (PS0E9)              [167] Yes she's only got that small house.
                           [168] It's tiny ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [169] Oh Amy you don't even like them.
Clare (PS0E9)              [170] I am only looking at them.
Helen (PS0E8)              [171] Come on eat up we want to get out.
Clare (PS0E9)              [172] Quarter past two
Amy (PS0EA)                [173] Not no nasty day.
                           [174] What does that say?
Helen (PS0E8)              [175] No it's not a nasty day.
                           [176] It's a better day.
Clare (PS0E9)              [177] No what that says?
Helen (PS0E8)              [178] Oh those are those turtles.
Amy (PS0EA)                [179] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [180] Nintendo.
Clare (PS0E9)              [181] Oh I thought it said no
Amy (PS0EA)                [182] No there not there the turtles.
Helen (PS0E8)              [183] Are they?
Clare (PS0E9)              [184] Yes.
Helen (PS0E8)              [185] What's Nintendo?
Amy (PS0EA)                [186] It's a super mummy [...] .
                           [187] Nintendo is like a pocket computer.
Helen (PS0E8)              [188] Oh is it?
Clare (PS0E9)              [189] Huh.
                           [190] You know better than those um ones that [...]
                           has got you know?

Helen (PS0E8)              [192] Lucy's had her er
Amy (PS0EA)                [193] What's that say?
Helen (PS0E8)              [194] [...] car.
                           [195] Sony.
                           [196] That's who makes it.
Amy (PS0EA)                [197] Well [...] he's got one like that.
Helen (PS0E8)              [198] Hmm.
Amy (PS0EA)                [199] Red.
Helen (PS0E8)              [200] Hmm.
Clare (PS0E9)              [201] Not the colour I would have chosen.
                           [202] I think I would have chosen black.
Helen (PS0E8)              [203] Would you?
Amy (PS0EA)                [204] Hmm.
Helen (PS0E8)              [205] Mm.
Amy (PS0EA)                [206] Out of the other ones ... white if there was
                           ... I would have chosen white.
Clare (PS0E9)              [207] I would have chosen red.
Helen (PS0E8)              [208] Don't you like red?
Amy (PS0EA)                [209] No not much.
                           [210] ... I like yellow that's my second favourite
                           colour.
                           [211] Nice bright colour.
                           [212] ... my favourite's that
Clare (PS0E9)              [213] That's a lovely pink isn't it? [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [214] Mm.
Clare (PS0E9)              [215] I like that pink ... I like peach as well
Amy (PS0EA)                [216] That's a nice colour ... Everyone's got a
                           favourite colour ... I wonder what daddy's is.
Helen (PS0E8)              [217] Don't know really.
Amy (PS0EA)                [218] Might be black.
                           [219] Ask him. ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [220] Mummy that's like an [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [221] Yes not with your mouth full [...]
Clare (PS0E9)              [...] ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [222] Can I have another cutlet?
Helen (PS0E8)              [223] That's your third.
Amy (PS0EA)                [224] I know. [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [225] So you'd like a film for your camera.
Amy (PS0EA)                [226] Yes please.
Helen (PS0E8)              [227] I should think that Mr Staton would put it in
                           for you wouldn't he?
Amy (PS0EA)                [228] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8)              [229] Um
Amy (PS0EA)                [230] There's a competition for the best photograph
Helen (PS0E8)              [231] Oh well you'd better take your camera then.
                           [232] Amy you can have that other little one if you
                           like.
                           [233] Would you like that for your holiday?
Clare (PS0E9)              [234] Yes please.
                           [235] I'd like it now for my [...] .
Helen (PS0E8)              [236] Hmm you may have that one.
Clare (PS0E9)              [237] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [238] You may have that one.
Clare (PS0E9)              [239] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [240] You can have that one.
Amy (PS0EA)                [241] Are we having a boat rip around the needles?
Helen (PS0E8)              [242] Hmm.
Amy (PS0EA)                [243] I might take one of the needles.
Helen (PS0E8)              [244] Well take a few photographs.
Amy (PS0EA)                [245] Yes
Helen (PS0E8)              [246] I mean don't forget.
                           [247] You're usually hopeless
Amy (PS0EA)                [248] All right.
                           [249] I'll put it in my back pack.
Helen (PS0E8)              [250] And take a photograph of everybody ... as you
                           set off.
                           [251] Mr Staton always takes a group one so if you
                           say just a minute I'd like one too. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [252] I'll get pictures of Mrs. just about to fall
                           in the sea or something [laugh] ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [253] Just about what?
Amy (PS0EA)                [254] And then Mr Staton asleep on the lake or
                           something
Helen (PS0E8)              [255] [laugh] You'd be lucky to find one of Mr
                           Statton asleep
Clare (PS0E9)              [cough] [laugh]
Helen (PS0E8)              [256] I don't think he's going to go to sleep while
                           he's in charge of thirty of you.
Clare (PS0E9)              [257] Then [...] here you are just [...]
Amy (PS0EA)                [258] Is he in charge?
Helen (PS0E8)              [259] He's in charge, yes.
                           [260] He's Head Master.
Amy (PS0EA)                [261] What comes if someone's ill?
                           [262] ... I suppose there are bound to be a couple
                           of people. ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [263] I don't know.
                           [264] ... Maybe if you really are they'll send you
                           home.
Amy (PS0EA)                [265] On your own?
Helen (PS0E8)              [266] No.
                           [267] One of the staff would have to come with you.
                           [268] Not that [...] one of the ... that couple.
Amy (PS0EA)                [269] Yeah
Helen (PS0E8)              [270] You can't ring the doctors on the Isle of
                           White. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [271] Oh if you have been really ill [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [272] I should think the one's whose most vulnerable
                           is Clare Montgomery.
                           [273] She's just had her operation. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [274] I'm surprised she's still going on it so soon
                           after.
                           [275] She gets a cough.
                           [276] If by any chance she catches it off me she's
                           going to have a really sore throat isn't she?
Helen (PS0E8)              [277] I think she wants to go.
                           [278] I don't think anybody wants to be left behind.
                           ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [279] [...] take more crisps.
Helen (PS0E8)              [280] No I think you've had enough.
Clare (PS0E9)              [281] Oh I've only had a few.
                           [282] I didn't have many did I?
Helen (PS0E8)              [283] No.
                           [284] Don't know really. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [285] I'm quite looking forward to it.
                           [286] You know er you get your packet money each day
                           and you can buy things.
                           [287] But I'm not over keen on nuts.
Helen (PS0E8)              [288] Good fun .
                           [289] I think if Mr. Statton says you'll be so tired
                           ... would you like to go and get your reading book
                           and get a hanky and [...]
Amy (PS0EA)                [290] You get prizes afterwards so that er one had
                           the best kept room and another one
Clare (PS0E9)              [291] Can you get a hanky?
Helen (PS0E8)              [292] Where have you come?
Amy (PS0EA)                [293] About five are the best people to live with.
Helen (PS0E8)              [294] [laugh] You might get one from happiest.
Amy (PS0EA)                [295] Happiest me?
                           [296] If I wake up with ear ache that's
Clare (PS0E9)              [297] There isn't any?
Helen (PS0E8)              [298] Aren't there?
Clare (PS0E9)              [299] No.
Helen (PS0E8)              [300] Is the box not in there or is the box empty?
Clare (PS0E9)              [301] The box is empty.
Helen (PS0E8)              [302] Is it?
                           [303] ... Hmm hmm.
                           [304] I'd better get another box.
                           [305] I'd better get some from Boots then I think.
Amy (PS0EA)                [306] Yes because I've run out.
Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [307] Well you read a bit to Clare while I go and
                           get the

                           [309] Next morning on the shore was so happy that he
                           wanted to jump.
                           [310] All right come along Lindy he shouted.
                           [311] Let's explore.
                           [312] I'll race you to the stone ... wall
Amy (PS0EA)                [...]
Clare (PS0E9)              [313] To the stone wall by run as fast as I could
                           ... [...] one one but Lindy did not mind.
                           [314] Your legs are longer she said are you argon
Amy (PS0EA)                [315] Aught
Clare (PS0E9)              [316] Aught to win.
                           [317] Let's explore either the water said Bill.
                           [318] At first Lindy did not want to go over the
                           wall.
                           [319] There might be wild animals on the other side
Helen (PS0E8)              [320] Right let's
Clare (PS0E9)              [321] she said.
Helen (PS0E8)              [322] Come on then here's a hanky.
Clare (PS0E9)              [323] I'm not afraid said Bill Boyd.
                           [324] I'm not afraid of anything
Helen (PS0E8)              [laugh]
Clare (PS0E9)              [giggle]
Helen (PS0E8)              [325] Good big blow good big blow
Amy (PS0EA)                [326] Can I have another puff [blowing nose]
Helen (PS0E8)              [327] Might be.
Amy (PS0EA)                [328] Thank you.
Clare (PS0E9)              [329] Girls are not afraid either said Lindy.
                           [330] Pardon me.
                           [331] When she come out after them.
                           [332] Once David got off off the wall
Helen (PS0E8)              [333] There y'are
Clare (PS0E9)              [334] they made the best ... discovery.
Helen (PS0E8)              [335] Good girl.
Clare (PS0E9)              [336] Of all there was a pond.
                           [337] It was a sa so big that it was almost a lake.
                           [338] Trees and bushes grew right down to the very
                           edge of it.
                           [339] You could
Amy (PS0EA)                [340] Friend's house .
Helen (PS0E8)              [341] Pardon?
Amy (PS0EA)                [342] I've got a friend's house [...] on the back
Clare (PS0E9)              [343] stand on the bank and

Clare (PS0E9)              [345] throw little stones into the water to make

Clare (PS0E9)              [347] rings and splashes

Helen (PS0E8)              [349] Oh I've done that one.
Clare (PS0E9)              [350] Mummy!
Helen (PS0E8)              [351] Yes.
                           [352] Good girl.
Clare (PS0E9)              [353] Um what did they make their best discovery
                           what's their best discovery?
Helen (PS0E8)              [354] The pond ... I think.
                           [355] There was a pond.
Amy (PS0EA)                [356] So what shall I do now
Clare (PS0E9)              [357] Discovery .
                           [358] They made the best discovery of all.
Helen (PS0E8)              [359] Hmm
Amy (PS0EA)                [360] Where?
Helen (PS0E8)              [361] Just leave it at the moment I'm trying to here
                           if you can't
Amy (PS0EA)                [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [362] If you can do it yourself do it but I'm trying
                           to hear Amy read.
Clare (PS0E9)              [363] It looks deep said Lindy.
                           [364] How deep deep do you think it is.
                           [365] It's deep deep
Helen (PS0E8)              [366] It's deep enough
Clare (PS0E9)              [367] enough to swim away
Helen (PS0E8)              [368] It's deep enough to swim in
Clare (PS0E9)              [369] in.
Helen (PS0E8)              [370] Answered
Clare (PS0E9)              [371] answered and deep enough for a boat if we had
                           one.
                           [372] If we had a boat we could row across to the
                           island of a picture
Helen (PS0E8)              [373] for for a

Helen (PS0E8)              [380] nic.
Helen (PS0E8)              [381] Picnic
Clare (PS0E9)              [382] I couldn't see where it was.
                           [383] Picnic.
Helen (PS0E8)              [384] Yes.
Clare (PS0E9)              [385] [...] The island was a small one in the this
                           has got a heart middle of the pond I couldn't find
                           the right line that's why I did that.
Helen (PS0E8)              [386] All right
Clare (PS0E9)              [387] It had all trees on it and looked as if it had
                           been made for picnics.
Helen (PS0E8)              [388] Hmm hmm
Clare (PS0E9)              [389] The children looked all along the bank to see
                           if they could find a boat.
                           [390] Suddenly they heard a quiet noise
Helen (PS0E8)              [391] I should think [...]
Clare (PS0E9)              [392] A quiet noise.
                           [393] Lindsy jumped with fright.
Helen (PS0E8)              [394] Fright.
Clare (PS0E9)              [395] What was that Bill? she whispered.
                           [396] Bill did not answer
Clare (PS0E9)              [397] For a moment.
                           [398] He was frightened himself ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [399] Though though
Clare (PS0E9)              [400] though he did not want Lindy to know that they
                           ... listened until they heard a noise again ... Then
                           Bill laughed.
                           [401] Oh Lindy you were were
Helen (PS0E8)              [402] You were
Clare (PS0E9)              [403] Afraid he said.

Helen (PS0E8)              [405] Of nothing ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [406] Girls afraid
Helen (PS0E8)              [407] Girls are always afraid of nothing
Clare (PS0E9)              [408] nothing.

Helen (PS0E8)              [410] It was only
Clare (PS0E9)              [411] Only a only frogs.
                           [412] They must be at the end of the pond.
                           [413] Let us go and see then said Lindy.
                           [414] There might be some tadpoles too.
                           [415] The children went to ... on tip toe but the
                           frogs stopped singing.
Amy (PS0EA)                [416] Can I go can I go and play with tennis

                           tennis?

Helen (PS0E8)              [422] Hmm
Clare (PS0E9)              [423] The water was warm and suddenly
Helen (PS0E8)              [424] And shallow
Clare (PS0E9)              [425] and shallow.

Helen (PS0E8)              [431] green plates

Clare (PS0E9)              [434] green plate.

Helen (PS0E8)              [436] A bit like
Helen (PS0E8)              [437] No plate.
                           [438] Very like it.
Clare (PS0E9)              [439] Like plants.

Helen (PS0E8)              [446] All along
Clare (PS0E9)              [447] I forgot.
                           [448] I thought that was that word.
                           [449] Croak croak croak one frog began to croak all
                           by himself.
                           [450] Others ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [451] Hm hm

Clare (PS0E9)              [458] from all over the pond until they made a long
                           chorus croak croak croak they are saying.
                           [459] A frog climbed on to a lily leaf quickly
Helen (PS0E8)              [460] quite
Clare (PS0E9)              [461] quite oh where am I?
                           [462] Quite close to Lindy and Bill.
                           [463] His eyes stuck ... out from his head like
                           little squab knobs
Helen (PS0E8)              [464] [laugh] that's difficult.
                           [465] Knobs.
                           [466] It's a silent K.
Clare (PS0E9)              [467] Knobs of I thought he was a squab knob
Helen (PS0E8)              [468] Yes it's a bit difficult that one.
                           [469] It's a silent K you know like knees knobs.
Clare (PS0E9)              [470] Cob knobs I said.
                           [471] [laugh] Knobs.
Helen (PS0E8)              [472] Start from where it says little knobs he ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [473] Okay.
                           [474] He looked could look at the children over
Helen (PS0E8)              [475] Although
Clare (PS0E9)              [476] Although he were needed
Helen (PS0E8)              [477] Although they were nearly
Clare (PS0E9)              [478] Nearly behind him ... Were him
Helen (PS0E8)              [479] Watch him.
Clare (PS0E9)              [480] Watch him Lindy said Bill and see if you can
                           see if you can see his
Helen (PS0E8)              [481] Tongue
Clare (PS0E9)              [482] tongue shoot out or
Helen (PS0E8)              [483] Shoot out our
Clare (PS0E9)              [484] Our teacher told us that frogs ... toot
Helen (PS0E8)              [485] tongues
Clare (PS0E9)              [486] tongues are stick
Helen (PS0E8)              [487] sticky
Clare (PS0E9)              [488] sticky at the ends.
                           [489] That is why they can catch flies so easily
                           with them.
                           [490] How would you like to catch your dinner by
                           putting out your tongue?
                           [491] I would
Helen (PS0E8)              [492] I wouldn't
Clare (PS0E9)              [493] I wouldn't like it at all answered.
                           [494] Why wouldn't she?
Helen (PS0E8)              [495] Would you like to catch your dinner by putting
                           your tongue out to catch it?
Clare (PS0E9)              [496] No
Helen (PS0E8)              [497] No
Clare (PS0E9)              [498] Why?
Helen (PS0E8)              [499] I wouldn't like it at all answered Lindy
Clare (PS0E9)              [500] Lindy.
                           [501] But it must be nearly dinner time now.
                           [502] I do feel hungry.
                           [503] We better go home then said Bill but we shall
                           come back here again.
                           [504] We may be able to find a boat next time.
Helen (PS0E8)              [505] There.
Clare (PS0E9)              [506] The apple orchard.
Helen (PS0E8)              [507] Your reading's getting a lot better I think.
                           [508] You're doing very well.
Clare (PS0E9)              [509] They are long chapters.
                           [510] I think that was quite enough.
Helen (PS0E8)              [511] It's a long book.
                           [512] A hundred and twenty eight pages.
Clare (PS0E9)              [513] I know
Helen (PS0E8)              [514] Hmm
Clare (PS0E9)              [515] What's that one?
                           [516] Well of course Miss MacDonald wouldn't have
                           wouldn't mind you to keep a book for quite a long
                           time.
Helen (PS0E8)              [517] No.
                           [518] No it's all right.
                           [519] Right let me get cleared up and then we'll go
                           into Bromley.
                           [520] ... You're going out with Clare?
*** 3 (Tape 004703) ***
Unknown speaker (KCDPSUNK) [521] Let's just have a look at your erm camera.
                           [522] What do you need your money for?
Clare (PS0E9)              [523] Nothing.
Helen (PS0E8)              [524] Nothing.
                           [525] You haven't made your bed.
Clare (PS0E9)              [526] I know.
                           [527] I haven't really had time.
Helen (PS0E8)              [528] Neither of you have thrown either of your old
                           hankie boxes away.
Clare (PS0E9)              [529] Amy keeps getting mine out of the bin.
Helen (PS0E8)              [530] Well ... erm throw them in the bin down
                           outside erm ... you got a two hundred.
Clare (PS0E9)              [531] Why why can you put it on different things?
Helen (PS0E8)              [532] Well you can have different fims .
                           [533] I thought it might be easier to get you what
                           you've got in already ... you've still got tea round
                           your mouth and have you cleaned your teeth cause
                           they weren't very clean um ... you could take Tom's
                           midnight garden with you ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [singing]
Helen (PS0E8)              [534] Oh you're not going in your earrings
Clare (PS0E9)              [535] Oh mummy I never wear them otherwise.
Helen (PS0E8)              [536] Well you won't wear them.
                           [537] You'll take them off.
Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [538] I don't think they're very suitable.
                           [539] They're for playing.
Clare (PS0E9)              [540] What?
Helen (PS0E8)              [541] They're for playing in.
                           [542] Not really suitable for ... come on throw your
                           dirty empty tissue boxes away.
                           [543] Come on put your coat on then Amy.
                           [544] See if we're locked up.
                           [545] No. ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [546] Mummy.
Helen (PS0E8)              [547] What?
Clare (PS0E9)              [548] [...] wear the jackets with all the badges?
Helen (PS0E8)              [549] Yes I should think so.
Clare (PS0E9)              [550] Where is it?
Helen (PS0E8)              [551] Do you want to wear that?
                           [552] I'm not sure.
Clare (PS0E9)              [553] Can I wear this then?
Helen (PS0E8)              [554] Erm
Amy (PS0EA)                [555] No it wasn't Mum.
Clare (PS0E9)              [556] It's not there.
Helen (PS0E8)              [557] Is it in your bedroom?
Clare (PS0E9)              [558] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [559] Is it hanging up in your bedroom?
Clare (PS0E9)              [560] I've looked ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [561] Nice little purse.
Helen (PS0E8)              [562] Yes it's a nice little purse.
                           [563] Don't break the coat hanger. ...
Amy (PS0EA)                [564] I've got to take the purse to the Isle of
                           White.

                           [567] You can save it
Clare (PS0E9)              [568] What on earth did you put in your pockets?
Helen (PS0E8)              [569] Oh goodness knows.
                           [570] Well does it fit you?
Clare (PS0E9)              [571] The arms are quite big but that doesn't matter
                           ... [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [572] I'm not sure that it's mildly clean.
Clare (PS0E9)              [573] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [574] I don't know that it's terribly clean.
Amy (PS0EA)                [575] That's the Isle of White.
Clare (PS0E9)              [576] Pardon?
Amy (PS0EA)                [577] Badge.
                           [578] You've got the badge on the arm.
Clare (PS0E9)              [579] Where?
Helen (PS0E8)              [580] The Isle of White.

                           [588] We seem to have a lot of dirty tissues and
                           stuff.
Amy (PS0EA)                [589] There not mine.
Helen (PS0E8)              [590] Hmm I don't know whose they are. ...
Clare (PS0E9)              [591] Have you got my hankies?
Helen (PS0E8)              [592] Oh I've just thrown a whole load of screwed up
                           ones out.
                           [593] Go and get a few more.
                           [594] Remind me we must get some handkies.
                           [595] Are you putting a coat on Clare or are you
                           going like that?
                           [596] ... Let's hope we can find a parking space.
                           [597] Right.
                           [598] Is that everything.
                           [599] So you want a film and you want a back pack.
                           [600] And you want a
Amy (PS0EA)                [601] I don't need a very big back pack because all

Helen (PS0E8)              [602] It's got to carry your lunch hasn't it?
Amy (PS0EA)                [603] My lunch [...] and my camera.

Clare (PS0E9)              [605] Fits me doesn't it?
Amy (PS0EA)                [606] If I put my camera in the front [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [607] Come on.
Clare (PS0E9)              [608] The coat does fit me.
Helen (PS0E8)              [609] Yes it looks rather nice.
                           [610] You've got France on it as well.
Clare (PS0E9)              [611] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [612] France and you've got all your American ones.
Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [613] No France here.
*** 4 (Tape 004704) ***
Unknown speaker (KCDPSUNK) [614] Well it says jeans and a jumper or trousers
                           and a jumper.
                           [615] I mean it it well no it says thick trousers
                           and a warm cardigan or a jumper.
                           [616] Erm I mean I should think you want to take
                           some shorts in case it's warm do you.
Clare (PS0E9)              [617] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8)              [618] You going to take your white trousers?
                           [619] Your new white ones?
Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [620] Are you going to wear those at the disco?
Clare (PS0E9)              [621] Yes.
Helen (PS0E8)              [622] Rather than your black ones?
Clare (PS0E9)              [623] Yes. ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [624] I thought you could probably take both.
                           [625] I don't think it's been very erm generous with
                           out of school wear but you can change when you get
                           back.
                           [626] I think you'd better take your Scots Park
                           jumper and your red cardigan in case you manage to
                           spill

Helen (PS0E8)              [628] all your dinner down your Scotch Park jumper
                           or something
Clare (PS0E9)              [629] Yeah
Helen (PS0E8)              [630] because you haven't got two.
Clare (PS0E9)              [...] ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [631] Well you've got that one that Daddy put on in
                           the wash and washed too hot.
Clare (PS0E9)              [632] Yeah ...
Helen (PS0E8)              [633] I think we might have a job parking.

Unknown speaker (KCDPSUNK) [634] Now the problem is going to be finding any

                           can you?
Clare (PS0E9)              [642] No.
Helen (PS0E8)              [643] Not the not the easiest place to get into but
                           still
Clare (PS0E9)              [644] Aren't we close up?

Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [651] No a bit bigger [...] seems to me if we'd
                           moved up a bit we would have had a bit more room.

                           [653] [...] a large space here.
Clare (PS0E9)              [654] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8)              [655] They haven't given me a very large space.
                           [656] It's probably why it's left.
*** 6 (Tape 004706) ***
Unknown speaker (KCDPSUNK) [657] Right I think that Salisbury's is probably the
                           best place for a back pack do you.
Clare (PS0E9)              [658] Shall we go there first?
Helen (PS0E8)              [659] Yes.
                           [660] Do you want a new washing bag and a salon to
                           take with you or are you not bothered?
Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [661] Mm?

Helen (PS0E8)              [664] [laugh] You can't have Amy's.
                           [665] You've only got the one.

Clare (PS0E9)              [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [667] Oh nothing.
                           [668] I just thought you'd like a new one.
                           [669] Oh right.
                           [670] In that case.
Clare (PS0E9)              [671] All we've got to have is
Helen (PS0E8)              [672] Well I certainly wouldn't bother taking any
                           shampoo if you can't have a hair drier.
Clare (PS0E9)              [673] Well Charlie'll have to so we can all wash our
                           hair.
Helen (PS0E8)              [674] Well Charlie's not going.

Clare (PS0E9)              [676] Yes [...]
Helen (PS0E8)              [677] She can sit on it can she?
Clare (PS0E9)              [678] Yeah easily.
                           [679] It comes down to about here.
Helen (PS0E8)              [680] Hmm.
                           [681] ... How often does Amy wash hers then?
Clare (PS0E9)              [682] What

Clare (PS0E9) [1922] [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [1923] Well it's probably the best way, then your all in the same
              dish.
Clare (PS0E9) [1924] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8) [1925] You can see the difference when you go on the trip, some

Helen (PS0E8) [1944] She what?
Clare (PS0E9) [1945] Told him off.
Amy (PS0EA)   [1946] Why?
Helen (PS0E8) [1947] It probably wasn't his fault.
              [1948] His mother shouldn't of sent him with so much money.
Clare (PS0E9) [1949] He said it was his money.
Helen (PS0E8) [1950] His going .
Amy (PS0EA)   [1951] Don't think he lives with his mother.
              [1952] Cos she's, cos she's.

Amy (PS0EA)   [1954] Not quite sure what, he says erm, he was protected by
              Social Security, and it, and then they [...] .
Clare (PS0E9) [1955] What's it mean by protected?.

Clare (PS0E9) [1969] Well, I'm pretty su- ... .
Amy (PS0EA)   [1970] Maybe she hasn't told her best friend that she was
              leaving.
Clare (PS0E9) [1971] I'm pretty sure that Matthew Paynes is still there.
Helen (PS0E8) [1972] Oh yes, I think so.
Clare (PS0E9) [1973] I've seen him, and I don't know why Michelle's moving,
              without his brother.

              from next term.
Clare (PS0E9) [1989] No tomorrow.

              to pleased about it.

              the playing field, and then Katherine, I found to get, I sat,
              found a way to get them near Matthew [...] and then Katherine
              said [whispering] [...] , I tickled him on the back, and I'd kept
              on doing that. [...] .
Amy (PS0EA)   [1994] I don't think we need to make any more buns yet.
Clare (PS0E9) [1995] Hm.
Helen (PS0E8) [1996] No, I think that'll last you a little while.
Clare (PS0E9) [1997] We'll make a cake though, like we do on Sunday.
Helen (PS0E8) [1998] Alright.
Clare (PS0E9) [1999] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8) [2000] Ok.
Clare (PS0E9) [2001] What kind of cake, chocolate?
Helen (PS0E8) [2002] Hm, if you want.
Clare (PS0E9) [2003] I would like normal.
Amy (PS0EA)   [2004] Oh we always have normal.
Clare (PS0E9) [2005] Erm, then, coffee.
              [2006] Oh I don't like chocolate.
Helen (PS0E8) [2007] Don't you?
Clare (PS0E9) [2008] Not as much as a normal or coffee.
Helen (PS0E8) [2009] I've brought some stuff to make a lemon cheesecake, cos
              lemon's were reduced.
Clare (PS0E9) [2010] Hm, I'll make that for you then [...] .
Amy (PS0EA)   [2011] Yes.
              [2012] A lemon cheesecake.
              [2013] I won't eat it but, any way.
Clare (PS0E9) [2014] Don't you like it?
Amy (PS0EA)   [2015] I don't like it.
Clare (PS0E9) [2016] Simply adore that one, chocolate bun, strawberry moose.
              [2017] Haven't made one of those for ages.
Amy (PS0EA)   [2018] No, I love strawberry moose, that's delicious.
Clare (PS0E9) [2019] Then it first it's strawberry moose, then it's erm lemon
              cheesecake, then it's chocolate biscuit cake.
Amy (PS0EA)   [2020] Oh, I don't know my order, I don't.
Clare (PS0E9) [2021] What d'you like best mummy?
Helen (PS0E8) [2022] Oh I don't know.
Clare (PS0E9) [2023] I'm not sure what I like best, I seem to like quite a bit.
Helen (PS0E8) [2024] A lemon cheesecake , bun, strawberry moose.
Clare (PS0E9) [2025] Hm.
Helen (PS0E8) [2026] The trouble with strawberry moose is, it takes ages to
              make doesn't it?
Clare (PS0E9) [2027] I like strawberry moose's .
Helen (PS0E8) [2028] Beat it for ten minutes, that's it seems an awfully long
              time to just stand there and.
Clare (PS0E9) [2029] Oh.
              [2030] Can't you beat it with the erm.
Helen (PS0E8) [2031] Hm, for ten minutes.
Clare (PS0E9) [2032] I'll do that.
              [2033] It's worth it strawberry moose.
Helen (PS0E8) [2034] Over the gas.
Clare (PS0E9) [2035] Over the gas?
Helen (PS0E8) [2036] Hm, you have to beat it in a pan of boiling water.
Clare (PS0E9) [2037] What, just beat?
Helen (PS0E8) [2038] The egg yolks and the strawberries and the sugar.
Clare (PS0E9) [2039] Oh, there lovely mixture, to watching boiling water.
Helen (PS0E8) [2040] Hm, trouble is it tends to come over the top of the bowl.
              [cough] .
Clare (PS0E9) [2041] Ah.
Helen (PS0E8) [2042] [cough] .
Clare (PS0E9) [2043] I didn't know you put them, glass on ... gas.
Helen (PS0E8) [2044] No you don't, you put the saucepan with some water in it,
              you boil that and put the bowl mixture in ... in the saucepan.
Clare (PS0E9) [2045] Oh right.
Helen (PS0E8) [2046] Your just boiling water round the outside.
Amy (PS0EA)   [2047] Hm, yeah.
Clare (PS0E9) [2048] What d'ya mean by put water on for boiling water?
Amy (PS0EA)   [2049] You put your pan with some boiling water in and then you
              put the bowl with all the stuff in on top.
Clare (PS0E9) [2050] I just thought it was grass.
Helen (PS0E8) [2051] In the pan .
              [2052] No, glass.
Clare (PS0E9) [2053] Oh glass, I thought you said grass, [...] .
Amy (PS0EA)   [2054] What happens if you put boiling water on glass?
Helen (PS0E8) [2055] Nothing, depends what sort of glass it is.
              [2056] If you pour boiling water on ordinary glass it will
              probably crack.
Clare (PS0E9) [2057] What, what's on there the glass [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [2058] Yes.
              [2059] If you fill a milk bottle with boiling water I would think
              it would crack, might do.
Clare (PS0E9) [2060] And a cup?
Helen (PS0E8) [2061] Pyrex is alright.
Clare (PS0E9) [2062] What's Pyrex?
Helen (PS0E8) [2063] That's my bowls are made off.
Clare (PS0E9) [2064] Is that real glass or is it?
Helen (PS0E8) [2065] I don't know what they do to it, but it's a stand the
              temperature much better.
Clare (PS0E9) [2066] Is it still glass?
Helen (PS0E8) [2067] Pyrex.
              [2068] It's glass of a sort, but I don't know what, I don't know
              what they do to make it much more heat resistant, you can put it
              in the oven.
Clare (PS0E9) [2069] Can you?
Helen (PS0E8) [2070] Oh yeah, that casserole tops Pyrex.
Clare (PS0E9) [2071] Is it?
              [2072] I thought that was plastic.
Helen (PS0E8) [2073] If that was plastic it would melt.
Clare (PS0E9) [2074] No.
Helen (PS0E8) [2075] In the oven.
Clare (PS0E9) [2076] Well what you put in the oven ?
Helen (PS0E8) [2077] You can't stick it in the oven that's plastic.
              [2078] Nothing!
Clare (PS0E9) [2079] The oven is made of plastic.
Helen (PS0E8) [2080] No it's not, it's made of glass and metal.
Clare (PS0E9) [2081] Oh.
Helen (PS0E8) [2082] It's not made of plastic.

Helen (PS0E8) [2536] But when it comes down to it you can't do it can you?

*** 42 (Tape 004909) ***
None (PS6ST)  [2561] What've you been doing all day today? [...] .

None (PS6ST)  [2576] That's about all really, nothing very exciting, I mean we
              were probably at Jenny's an hour.
Helen (PS0E8) [2577] [...] .
None (PS6ST)  [2578] Erm, there's a sort of shop in the mall that sort of
              sells, oh it, it does key cutting and heeling and stuff, we got
              one from there in the end.
              [2579] We had a look in Salisbury's but she didn't like any of
              them there.
              [2580] There so expensive.
Amy (PS0EA)   [2581] Now what shall we do?
None (PS6ST)  [2582] You can wash the erm, the beaters, and you can put the
              cream next to the other bowl and I'll mix them altogether when
              I've got the lemon juice in.
Amy (PS0EA)   [2583] [...] .

              that.

              [2590] Oh come on.
Amy (PS0EA)   [2591] I didn't mean to.
None (PS6ST)  [2592] Well, would you like to wash and dry your hair?
              [2593] Oh come on I'm tired .
Clare (PS0E9) [2594] Look what's Clare done .
Amy (PS0EA)   [2595] Sorry.
None (PS6ST)  [2596] Right.

None (PS6ST)  [2598] Right, well would you like to go up and run Amy a bath
              then please, cos I haven't got this finished and.
Helen (PS0E8) [2599] What's this?
None (PS6ST)  [2600] Oh my dress I need to shorten it.
*** 43 (Tape 004910) ***
Helen (PS0E8) [2601] Look!
              [2602] Clare you were asked to run a bath that doesn't mean to
              say you go across the landing six times, just run her a bath and
              Amy will you get in it and then come down Clare.
Clare (PS0E9) [2603] I know, [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [2604] I'm tired and I don't want to cope with you, otherwise you
              both go to bed this minute.
Clare (PS0E9) [2605] What did you say?
Helen (PS0E8) [2606] I said you run her a bath.
Clare (PS0E9) [2607] I am .
Helen (PS0E8) [2608] And then , well why is you clumpering across the landing
              six or seven times?
              [2609] Why all the screams?
              [2610] I'm tired.
Clare (PS0E9) [2611] [...] screaming.
Helen (PS0E8) [2612] Well just run her a bath and then come down.
              [2613] If you don't, you go to bed.
*** 44 (Tape 004911) ***
Helen (PS0E8) [2614] Alright, here you are.
Clare (PS0E9) [2615] Mummy.
Helen (PS0E8) [2616] What?
Clare (PS0E9) [2617] Do you go up to half term and [...] .
              [2618] What's half term?
Helen (PS0E8) [2619] Well your on half term now aren't you?
Clare (PS0E9) [2620] Oh, well I can't just have lots of terms, half terms, cos
              the next one half term.
Helen (PS0E8) [2621] Half what?.
Clare (PS0E9) [2622] And then there's a lot more.
Helen (PS0E8) [2623] [yawn] What are you talking about?
              [2624] You have a term and then in a middle of the term you have
              a half term don't you?
Clare (PS0E9) [2625] Then you have a nice place.
Helen (PS0E8) [2626] Well.
Clare (PS0E9) [2627] Go home.
Helen (PS0E8) [2628] Well I don't know whether you go home from boarding
              school, you probably just have a day off, I don't know, I haven't
              been to boarding school.
              [2629] Right, were do we get, sharp words [cough] .
              [2630] The spider affair as it was called went all over the
              school before the day was out, it caused a great deal of
              laughter.
              [2631] When mother, Mams Arougeaye heard of it she sneered.
              [2632] To think that a French woman should be so foolish she
              said, though I didn't like spiders or earwigs or moths or even
              snakes.
              [2633] Mams Audyponch should be ashamed to make her exhibition of
              herself.
              [2634] The first form talked about it more than any one else, of
              course they squealed with laughter when they saw the poor Mary
              Lou Manselle and Gwendoline, all falling victims to the same
              spider, jolly clever spider said Irene, it means the only three
              people in the form that it ... that would be scared of it, I take
              my hat off to that spider, can't think why it chose my desk said
              Mary Lou, no, that was a shame said Gwendoline, poor Mary Lou it
              must of been an awful shock for you when you saw it, I wonder who
              put it there?
              [2635] There was a silence for the first time it occurred to
              first form that the spider might of been put there on purpose,
              they looked at one another.
              [2636] It was a dirty trick to put it into to poor Mary Lou's
              desk said Jean, she can't help being scared of things I suppose,
              she almost jumped out of her skin when she saw it, I should of
              thought any joker in our form would of been decent enough to
              popped it into say Alicia's desk, not if it happened to be Alicia
              who popped it in said a sly voice, you do so love playing tricks
              don't you Alicia?
              [2637] You and Daryl where in the first form room before
              afternoon school and I'm sure we'll all remember you saying you'd
              like to put a spider down Mary Lou's neck.
              [2638] It was Gwendoline speaking, Alicia glanced at her, well I
              didn't do it she says, nor did Daryl, sorry to disappoint you
              darling Gwendoline, Mary, but we just didn't, if it was any one I
              should think it was you.
              [2639] Mary Lou's my friend said Gwendoline, I wouldn't do that
              to her.
              [2640] Well if you've almost drowned her one week I should think
              you could quite well bring yourself to put a spider in her desk
              the next week said Daryl.
              [2641] It's pretty funny that you and Alicia were the only ones
              in the classroom before afternoon school persisted Gwendoline
              angry that no one seemed to agree with her suggestion.
              [2642] Shut up said Catherine shortly, we know it wasn't Daryl or
              Alicia because they say so.
              [2643] The spider must of got in there by accident and that's
              that.
              [2644] Well I think began Gwendoline that the class took [...] at
              once.
              [2645] Be quite Gwendoline, Gwendoline shut up, shut up
              Gwendoline, Gwendoline shut up.
              [2646] There was nothing to do but to shut up, Gwendoline was
              sulking exasperated.
              [2647] It had been such a good idea and all that had resulted
              from it was a double punishment for her and a complete failure to
              make anyone believe to Alicia or Daryl had played the trick.
              [2648] True the first formers had had to go to bed an hour
              earlier, but they all voted it was worth it, Gwendoline felt
              vicious about the whole affair, she'd determining not to be put
              off by her first day there .
Clare (PS0E9) [2649] What [...] erm hours early.
Helen (PS0E8) [2650] She did.
              [2651] She determine not to be put off by her first failure, but
              to go on doing things to Mary Lou so that in the end the class
              would have to put the tricks down to Alicia and Daryl.
              [2652] She thought she would also hint to Miss Potts that Alicia
              and Daryl were at the bottom of things, but she didn't get very
              far with this, she had to go and see Miss Potts about some
              returned homework.
              [2653] She stood very neatly beside her in the little room that
              Miss Potts shared with Mams Audiponde at North Tower.
              [2654] Miss Potts I was awfully sorry about that spider affair
              the other day, she began, of course Alicia and Daryl were in the
              classroom before hand, I'm sure they know something about it, I
              heard Alicia say, Miss Potts looked up, are you trying to sneak
              she said, or in more polite language to tell tales, because if
              so, don't try it on me.
              [2655] At the boarding school I went to Gwendoline we had a very
              good punishment for sneaks, all the girls in the sneak dormy gave
              her one good spank with the back of a hair brush.
              [2656] You may have a lot of interesting things to tell me, but
              it's no use expecting me to listen.
              [2657] I wonder if the girls here out the same punishment for
              sneaks, I must ask them.
              [2658] Gwendoline went flaming red, as sneaks, fancy Miss Potts
              daring to call her that.
              [2659] Gwendoline Mary Lacy a sneak, all because she just wanted
              to drop a kindly hint, Gwendoline didn't no what to say she felt
              as if she'd like to burst into tears, but Miss Potts always got
              very impatient with girls who did that.
              [2660] She went out of the room longing to slam the door as she
              often did at home, but she didn't dare to here.
              [2661] She felt very sorry for herself, if her mother new what an
              awful school she'd come to she would take her away at once, Miss
              Winter too would be horrified.
              [2662] But Gwendoline wasn't quite so sure about her father, he
              can say things at times very like Miss Potts said.
              [2663] The week went by, it was a very pleasant week, hot with a
              cool breeze that made games and swimming even more pleasant than
              usual, Alicia and Betty were practising hard for the school
              sport, both were excellent swimmers and divers .
Clare (PS0E9) [2664] That's what I use.
              [2665] That's not very nice is it .
Helen (PS0E8) [2666] Hm no, well try not to keep banging it.
Clare (PS0E9) [2667] It does on her and it's quite sharp.
Helen (PS0E8) [2668] Oh dear.
              [2669] Daryl tried to imitate all they did, she was good to, but
              not quite so good as they were, but she was quite fearless and
              divide of the highest diving board and went down a chute in all
              kinds of peculiar position.
              [2670] The only unhappy person that week was Mary Lou.
              [2671] She'd got into a lot of trouble over many little things,
              for instance, her clothes in the changing room were being thrown
              down in a pool of water, and was soaking wet, she had to take
              them to matron to be dried, matron was cross.
              [2672] Mary Lou can't you hang your things up properly in that
              changing room?
              [2673] You know there always puddles of water on the floor from
              the girls coming in and out of the pool.
              [2674] I did hang them up matron said Mary Lou mildly, I know I
              did, then Mary Lou's tennis racket sudden showed three broken
              strings, they were not frayed, but looked as if they've been cut,
              Mary Lou was upset.
              [2675] My new racket she said, look Gwendoline, who would think a
              new racket would go like that.
              [2676] It couldn't said Gwendoline pretending to examine it very
              closely, those strings have been cut Mary Lou someone's been
              playing a trick on you, what a shame.
              [2677] Mary Lou was miserable, she couldn't believe she had any
              enemy's, for when she found buttons cut off on her Sunday dress,
              she new someone was being unkind and mean, Gwendoline comforted
              her.
              [2678] Never mind I'll sew them on for you, I hate sewing but
              I'll do it for you Mary Lou.
              [2679] [cough] . So making a great show of it Gwendoline sowed on
              the six blue buttons one night.
              [2680] The first former's stared at her in surprise, they knew
              she never mended any thing if she could help it.
              [2681] How did those buttons come off asked Jean?
              [2682] That's what I'd like to know said Gwendoline smugly, six
              buttons all ripped off I'm putting them on for Mary Lou because
              I'm so sorry any one should play at such a dirty trick.
              [2683] I'd like to know who cut the strings of her tennis racket
              too, the first formers looked at one another, it certainly is
              queer the way things have been happening to poor Mary Lou lately,
              even her prayer book had disappeared and some of her pencils had
              gone.
              [2684] True there'd been found in Alicia's desk, but everyone
              thought that was just an accident, now they began to wonder if
              someone had put them there, not Alicia, Lizzie wouldn't do a
              thing like that, but somebody, it was getting near half term and
              new the girls were excited because some of them were expecting
              visits from there parents.
              [2685] Any parent who lived [clears throat] not to far away would
              be sure to come.
              [2686] Daryl [...] because her father and mother were coming.
              [2687] They lived a long way away, but they decided to take a
              weeks holiday in Cornwall and decided to see Daryl in the middle
              of it.
              [2688] The girls began to talk about there families, I wish my
              three brothers could come said Alicia, we'd have some sport then.
              [2689] I wished my little sister could come said Jean, I'd love
              to show her Mallory Towers.
              [2690] Is your mother coming Sally asked Mary Lou?
              [2691] No said Sally she lives too far away.
              [2692] Daryl remembered something your mother had told her in a
              letter a week or two before, she said that she'd met Sally Hopes
              mother and had liked her and she said to that she'd seen Mrs
              Hopes baby.
Clare (PS0E9) [2693] Who?.
Helen (PS0E8) [2694] Sally.
              [2695] Sally's sister a little girl of three months, Daryl had
              meant to tell Sally what her mother had said and had forgotten
              and now she remembered.
              [2696] Oh Sally I expect your mother won't come because of the
              baby she said.
              [2697] Sally went stiff, she stared at Daryl as if she couldn't
              believe her ears, her face went quite white.
              [2698] When she spoke she sounded as if she was chocking.
              [2699] You don't know what your talking about she said, what
              baby? we haven't a baby, my mother won't be coming because it so
              far I tell you.
              [2700] Daryl was puzzled, but Sally don't be silly my mother says
              in a letter she's seen your baby sister she's three months old
              she said.
              [2701] I haven't got a baby sister said Sally in a low [noseblow]
              queer voice, I'm the only one, mother and I have been everything
              to each other, daddy has to go, go away such a lot, I haven't got
              a baby sister.
              [2702] [clears throat] . Girls looked at Sally curiously,
              whatever could be the matter with her she sounded so queer.
              [2703] Oh right said Daryl and Elsie you ought to know I suppose
              any way, I'd suspect you'd like a sister, it's nice having one.
              [2704] I should hate a sister said Sally, I wouldn't share my
              mother with anyone, she walked out of the room her face as wooden
              as ever, the girls were really puzzled, she's a funny one said
              Irene, hardly ever says anything, all closed up, somehow, but
              sometimes those closed up people burst open suddenly and then
              look out, well I'll shall certainly write and tell mother she's
              mistaken said Daryl and she did so.
              [2705] Then the mesh, she told Sally the next time she saw her,
              I'm sorry I made that mistake about you having a sister she said
              to Sally, I've written to tell mother you've said you haven't one
              she must of been mistaken what your mother said.
              [2706] Sally stood still and gazed, glared at Daryl as if she
              suddenly hated her.
              [2707] What you want to go interfering for she burst out, leave
              me and my family alone, little busy body always sticking your
              nose into other people's affairs, Daryl's temper flared up, I
              don't she said, you gua rd your tongue Sally, I never meant to
              interfere and I can't think what all the fuss is about, either
              you have a sister or you haven't, I don't care.
              [2708] You tell your mother not to interfere either said Sally,
              writing letters about my family.
              [2709] Oh don't be so silly flared back Daryl really exasperated
              now, any one would think there was a deep dark mystery the way
              you go on, any way I'll just see what my mother says when she
              next writes to me and I'll tell you.
              [2710] I don't want to know, I won't know said Sally as she put
              her hands ... put out her hands as if she was fending Daryl off,
              I hate you Daryl Rivers, you with, you with your mother who comes
              to see you often, sends you things and writes you long letters
              and comes to see you.
              [2711] You boast about that to me you do it all on purpose, your
              mean, mean, mean.
              [2712] [clears throat] . Daryl was utterly taken about, what in
              the wide world did Sally mean, she watched the girl go out of the
              room and sat down on the form completely bewildered.
              [2713] Right, half term at last.
Clare (PS0E9) [2714] Half term at last.
Helen (PS0E8) [2715] [cough] Hm.

Clare (PS0E9) [4458] I didn't know he was called Pink.
              [4459] Ah, winter came and it rain much colder, snow fell and
              covered everything Pink
Helen (PS0E8) [4460] Covered everything.
              [4461] Pink.

Clare (PS0E9) [4477] Mm, I want to read all of it.
              [4478] Pink's beautiful feathers grow dull, why did they grow
              dull?
Helen (PS0E8) [4479] Again he's probably not eating the right things.
Clare (PS0E9) [4480] And dirty in all the rain and fog.
              [4481] He longed for the white spring days, at last the morning
              were light

Clare (PS0E9) [4483] were lighter.

              gone, some of the days were quite warm and Pink started to
              pressured?
Helen (PS0E8) [4485] To practice.
Clare (PS0E9) [4486] Practice the song he knew.
              [4487] They were not very good at the, he had forgotten all the
              best bits.
              [4488] Then it really was spring the apples orchard was in
              flower.
              [4489] Pink, Pink shouted the chaffinches to each other, oh Pink

Helen (PS0E8) [4506] Call.
Clare (PS0E9) [4507] call rang out.
              [4508] Why did they have pink on it, that's why it's called Pink?
Helen (PS0E8) [4509] Mm.
              [4510] That's why he's called Pink, I think.
Clare (PS0E9) [4511] He loved bathing.
Helen (PS0E8) [4512] Bathing.
Clare (PS0E9) [4513] Oh bath ... bathing.
Helen (PS0E8) [4514] Well it's called bathing isn't it?
              [4515] You don't say I'm going to have a bathing.
              [4516] I'm going bath, I'm going bathing.
Clare (PS0E9) [4517] Bathing to the winter fog.
Helen (PS0E8) [4518] Did you find it?
Amy (PS0EA)   [4519] Yes.
Clare (PS0E9) [4520] He made his feathers dirty so he liked
Helen (PS0E8) [4521] So he looked. [cough]
Clare (PS0E9) [...]
Helen (PS0E8) [4522] For.
Clare (PS0E9) [4523] for one of those deep puddles made by the spring rain.
              [4524] He dripped his
Helen (PS0E8) [4525] He dipped.
Clare (PS0E9) [4526] he, he dipped his head, that's what I said
Helen (PS0E8) [4527] Mm.
Clare (PS0E9) [4528] under the splash
Helen (PS0E8) [4529] Under and splashed.
Clare (PS0E9) [4530] the water all over his self with the wings, with his
              wings, then he flew up into a tree to tie
Helen (PS0E8) [4531] Tidy.
Clare (PS0E9) [4532] tidy his feathers and dry in the sun.
              [4533] His feather grow white every day until his breast was a
              good all colour.
              [4534] Pink thought to himself I very fine bird.
              [4535] He, and, he wanted a friend to admire him
Helen (PS0E8) [4536] Mm, good girl. [cough]
Clare (PS0E9) [4537] and listened to his songs, he every
Helen (PS0E8) [4538] He even.
Clare (PS0E9) [4539] He [...] thought of making a nest
Helen (PS0E8) [4540] I think that's for little babies isn't it?
Clare (PS0E9) [4541] Yeah.
              [4542] What you say?
              [4543] He [...] lady.
              [4544] They're not the same birds
Helen (PS0E8) [4545] Mm, I think they're supposed to be.
Clare (PS0E9) [4546] cos that ones horrible and dirty with
Helen (PS0E8) [4547] Well that's the lady bird and they're never so pretty as
              the men birds.
Clare (PS0E9) [4548] Aren't they?
Helen (PS0E8) [4549] No, not the birds.
Clare (PS0E9) [4550] Why?
Helen (PS0E8) [4551] It's always men that have the pretty colours.
              [4552] Are you going to read this page?
Clare (PS0E9) [4553] One day he remembered the hen chaffinch thought
Helen (PS0E8) [4554] That.
Clare (PS0E9) [4555] that had flower
Helen (PS0E8) [4556] That had flown.
Clare (PS0E9) [4557] flown with him in the nest
Helen (PS0E8) [4558] In the.
Clare (PS0E9) [4559] in the winter and
Helen (PS0E8) [4560] She.
Clare (PS0E9) [4561] she was nice so, she would admire his fine colours and did
              not seem much herself, so, she wanted
Helen (PS0E8) [4562] So she would.
Clare (PS0E9) [4563] would listen to him, she is a wife I want Pink thought.
              [4564] Thought Pink, the little hen was pleased, she too wanted
              to make a nest.
              [4565] Pink took her to the garden and showed her the rose arch.
Helen (PS0E8) [4566] Mm.
Clare (PS0E9) [4567] Look, oh yes that's it, dear.
Helen (PS0E8) [4568] Look my dear.
Clare (PS0E9) [4569] My dear, he said, this seems a good place for a nest.
              [4570] Why does it seem a good place for a nest? [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [4571] Don't think she thinks much of it. [cough]
Clare (PS0E9) [4572] He no ... nobody
Helen (PS0E8) [4573] Nodded.
Clare (PS0E9) [4574] Nobody
Helen (PS0E8) [4575] She nodded.
Clare (PS0E9) [4576] nodded but looked at an apple tree over the hedge.
              [4577] The next day they began to build the nest in the apple
              tree.
              [4578] Is that the apple tree?
Helen (PS0E8) [4579] No, here's the apple tree, I think that's the rose arch,
              but she didn't think that was such a good idea, and she was
              probably quite right.
Clare (PS0E9) [4580] Pardon?
Helen (PS0E8) [4581] She was probably quite right.
Clare (PS0E9) [4582] This one [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [4583] Yeah, here we are.
Clare (PS0E9) [4584] The little hen worked all day getting moss and wood and
              bind up those
Helen (PS0E8) [4585] These.
Clare (PS0E9) [4586] These [...] put in a heap with
Helen (PS0E8) [4587] Where.
Clare (PS0E9) [4588] where two branches met.
              [4589] When they
Helen (PS0E8) [4590] When they're. [cough]
Clare (PS0E9) [4591] there were
Helen (PS0E8) [4592] Enough.

              pushed herself r ... round and round, soon then there was [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [4596] Was shaped.
Clare (PS0E9) [4597] shaped like a cup with bright
Helen (PS0E8) [4598] She bought, brought.
Clare (PS0E9) [4599] she brought more moss still and pressed into shape with in
              the same way.
              [4600] Turning herself round and round
Helen (PS0E8) [4601] Have we nearly finished?
              [4602] Yes you nearly finished.
Clare (PS0E9) [4603] Good.
Helen (PS0E8) [4604] Mm.
Clare (PS0E9) [4605] I wish you wouldn't keep trying
Helen (PS0E8) [4606] Turning.
Clare (PS0E9) [4607] turning round and round like that said Pink.
              [4608] You make me feel quite dizzy.
              [4609] Don't watch then she answered chaffinch
Helen (PS0E8) [4610] Cheerfully.
Clare (PS0E9) [4611] cheerfully, why don't you sit in the tree and sing to me,
              when all the moss and, was in place the [...] chaffinch went to
              find her hair.
              [4612] Horse hair
Helen (PS0E8) [4613] Horse hair.
Clare (PS0E9) [4614] What's horse hair?
Helen (PS0E8) [4615] What, horse hair from the horses tail I should think.
              [4616] Horse hair. [noseblow]
Clare (PS0E9) [4617] Horse hair for lying
Helen (PS0E8) [4618] For the lining.
Clare (PS0E9) [4619] lining the inside of the nest.

Clare (PS0E9) [4630] Green
Helen (PS0E8) [4631] Don't want it to show up, does she.
Clare (PS0E9) [4632] Why?
Helen (PS0E8) [4633] Well cos then it will be obvious and cats might come up
              and get the eggs or something.
Clare (PS0E9) [4634] [...] it must do.
Helen (PS0E8) [4635] It mustn't do that.
Clare (PS0E9) [4636] Do that.
Helen (PS0E8) [4637] She doesn't want it to show up.
Clare (PS0E9) [4638] Why, he looks a bit sad.
Helen (PS0E8) [4639] I don't think he's doing very much do you?
Clare (PS0E9) [4640] No.
Helen (PS0E8) [4641] I think he's letting his wife do all the work.
Clare (PS0E9) [4642] Yes.

              has it?
None (PS6ST)  [4837] No.
Helen (PS0E8) [4838] But uhum, it sticks, whilst the other one just curls
              straight back up at the edges didn't it.
None (PS6ST)  [4839] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8) [4840] Dreadful.

              to put the paper up that sticks haven't you?

              fold that up.
              [4864] Well I thought wall paper ought to stick because wall
              paper was on Amy's bedroom.

              bothered me it was the uhum, the fact that the edges just doesn't
              stay down.
None (PS6ST)  [4891] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8) [4892] I think I might cut another piece of paper, the side won't
              stay flat.

              ballet, she won't see Neighbours at all.
None (PS6ST)  [4937] [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [4938] No.

Helen (PS0E8) [4944] But, you know she just puts it on, she doesn't want to do
              any thing for a hour or so and just sit and recover.
              [4945] I don't think you can really grumble.
              [4946] Has she not ... I mean she never watches it after tea if
              you notice, she'll always go out and play or something.

Helen (PS0E8) [4948] She'll watch it half an hour in the evening before she
              goes to bed if she gets the chance.
              [4949] She doesn't watch all that, she doesn't watch all that
              much really ... I think she gets more tired than Amy in a way.
None (PS6ST)  [4950] Hm. [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [4951] I think Clare lives more on her nerves.
None (PS6ST)  [4952] Hm.

Helen (PS0E8) [5093] Oh no, I don't think I should use all of them, about half
              of them I should think.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5094] Ten, how many you on?
Helen (PS0E8) [5095] Seven I think.

Helen (PS0E8) [5105] Probably.

              [5107] ... Anyway makes it look a little smarter doesn't it, than
              with a green carpet, it'll look nice, yes.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5108] I can't choose another carpet can I?
Helen (PS0E8) [5109] No.
              [5110] It looks better all the same colour instead of some walls
              green, some walls white.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5111] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8) [5112] So I assume Half a Sixpence is finished.
              [5113] Was it good?
Amy (PS0EA)   [5114] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8) [5115] Quite a nice film.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5116] It's a weird story.
Helen (PS0E8) [5117] I had to do that for O'level.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5118] What?
Helen (PS0E8) [5119] That story.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5120] Writing?
Helen (PS0E8) [5121] No I had to study the book.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5122] Why?
Helen (PS0E8) [5123] Well for English literature they set you so many books to
              study, that was one of them.
              [5124] [...] a stupid book .
Amy (PS0EA)   [5125] [...] questions .
Helen (PS0E8) [5126] Yes, from all the characters and
Amy (PS0EA)   [5127] Pardon.
Helen (PS0E8) [5128] From all the characters and how they fitted into the
              story.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5129] Did you pass?
Helen (PS0E8) [5130] Only just [laugh] .
              [5131] I don't like that book at all, it was a book.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5132] What other books are there?
Helen (PS0E8) [5133] You have a Shakespeare play, you had Silas Marner I think
              I quite liked that one.
              [5134] I had one of J- ... uhum, oh I can't remember his name,
              another play.
              [5135] George Bernard Shaw.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5136] Hm, [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [5137] Thought that was fairly silly as well.
              [5138] That was four, I think that was probably all I had, two
              books, two plays, it's quite enough.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5139] What're you having for dinner?
Helen (PS0E8) [5140] Chicken casserole, and you can have a little bit.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5141] [...] .
Helen (PS0E8) [5142] Well you look better than you did, you've got some colour
              in your face now.

Helen (PS0E8) [5144] You can have a little bit of something to eat ...
Amy (PS0EA)   [5145] Hopefully I'll be better tomorrow.
Helen (PS0E8) [5146] I hope so poppet.

              awful if you've had a week off and then your not well.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5148] Yeah.
Helen (PS0E8) [5149] This was all a bit sudden, I though you were better.
Amy (PS0EA)   [5150] Hm ... Have you finished yet?
Helen (PS0E8) [5151] Well I need daddy to a ... start along there [yawn] .
Amy (PS0EA)   [5152] Why can't you?
Helen (PS0E8) [5153] Well the light has got to come off and you've got to drop
              a perpendicular so that you know, cut the paper straight, it
              helps if you put it up straight instead of wonky.
