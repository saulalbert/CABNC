*CHR:	Lynda wasn't here yesterday when er   out. •862972_866172•
        Sorry? •866612_866742•
*NOR:	You'll have to warn her about it. •866742_867482•
*CHR:	Well I don't think it actually needs warning about. •868932_873852•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Well I believe it does. •875972_876902•
        I think it inhibits some people but  she will explain. •876902_881082•
        You saw the sheet didn't you? •881312_882462•
*NOR:	Well I didn't really look. •882622_888342•
*CHR:	It's irritating cos the clip won't go on the shirt. •888882_891112•
*NOR:	Which clip's that ? •891252_892542•
*CHR:	Well this microphone clip  shirt. •894622_897722•
*NOR:	Is that the kind they wear on the television? •897722_898742•
*CHR:	Yes. •898742_898862•
*NOR:	Why do you , why doesn't it work then? •898862_901642•
*CHR:	Well it's, the shirt just seems to be too fine for it. •902572_906652•
*NOR:	Wear a tough shirt  •906922_909992•
*CHR:	Yes. •911132_911222•
        Playing a tough game tomorrow. •911712_912722•

*CHR:	Croquet. •914872_915242•
*NOR:	Oh that's Saturday not Sunday is it? •915482_916582•
*CHR:	Yes. •917222_917502•
        Very irritating because er  if only I'd approached David earlier as I'd intended to. •919272_923382•
        Previous weekend they had an open day at er Dulwich Croquet Club. •923462_927172•

*NOR:	You were busy last  •931912_932302•
*CHR:	Of course I was on Sunday, yes indeed. •933792_934952•
        Indeed indeed indeed. •935092_942882•
        Yes I couldn't fit in much croquet then could I? •944812_955422•
        The implication was that it was going to be a bit warmer today wasn't it? •958852_963702•
*NOR:	I think the sun might come out a little later, I don't know about warmer but •964692_978652•
*CHR:	Mm. •978652_978712•
*NOR:	it's certainly going to be overcast now. •981242_983822•
*CHR:	have breakfast? •100062_100139•
        Thank you. •100139_100163•
        David and  were agreeing last night how much they like the road. •100163_100429•
*NOR:	Made up you mean? •100500_100585•
*CHR:	Yes. •100585_100634•
        Yes. •100660_100706•
        But er •100752_100782•
*NOR:	I must say I don't think twice now about opening that window whereas before I only did it  reluctantly because of all the dust  . •100836_101624•
*CHR:	Because of the dust flying in . •101652_101743•
        Yes, yes. •101743_101843•
*NOR:	Yeah. •101860_101866•
*CHR:	She too was saying that she had an urge to go down with her broom and sweep up the  these building works. •101880_102491•
        Right. •102563_102572•
        I'm gonna have some breakfast, aren't you? •102691_103290•
*NOR:	That's an idea. •103456_103638•
        They started off on grapefruit down there. •103638_104189•
*CHR:	Eating it, or •104286_104328•
*NOR:	No no, preparing. •104328_104399•
*CHR:	Oh, right. •104581_104593•
        Shall I finish it? •104611_104665•
*NOR:	Yes please. •104994_105119•
