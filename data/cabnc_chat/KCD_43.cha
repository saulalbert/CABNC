*HEL:	Look!Clare you were asked to run a bath that doesn't mean to say you go across the landing six times, just run her a bath and Amy will you get in it and then come down Clare.
*CLA:	I know, (        ) .
*HEL:	I'm tired and I don't want to cope with you, otherwise you both go to bed this minute.
*CLA:	What did you say?
