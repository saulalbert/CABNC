*JEA:	Mm. •206878_206885•
*BRE:	wherever that is. •206960_207022•
        London I think. •207072_207129•
        And he said that he'd phoned them and said could they change it and he'd finish at eleven then he can still start tomorrow night again at quarter to one . •207194_207926•
*JEA:	Mm. •207926_207932•
        Mm. •207932_207938•
        Mm. •207978_207985•
        Yeah. •208089_208117•
        Yeah. •208117_208134•
        Yeah. •208134_208150•
*BRE:	And he said if they can get someone else for the run they will. •208161_208384•
*JEA:	Yeah. •208472_208481•
        Mm. •208481_208488•
        Mm. •208502_208508•
*BRE:	But er  mm what else was we saying? •208508_208801•
*JEA:	Well we were talking about the general  lack of faith in governments   •208944_209364•
*BRE:	you was telling me about a suit. •209377_209502•
        This guy fifteen grand turned up for Paul. •209549_209725•
*JEA:	Oh yeah, yeah. •209725_209796•
        Suit comes along  and sits there sipping coffee. •209817_210279•
        Takes about three quarters of an hour. •210365_210530•
        I, I don't say that it was like being grilled by the K G B he was  most polite and courteous. •210530_211015•
        But he was going to find out where Paul  was. •211091_211401•
        He was going to find out. •211498_211556•
*BRE:	How did he get your address then? •211556_211658•
*JEA:	Mm? •211658_211664•
*BRE:	How did he get your address? •211679_211774•
*JEA:	Well •211894_211922•
*BRE:	When he worked in Safeways or something? •211933_212082•
*JEA:	Yes er  somehow they, they'd, they'd got it, or was it  or did I have to fill in a  a census form just at the time when Paul was with me? •212150_213291•
        When he happened to be with me. •213323_213441•
*BRE:	Right, yeah. •213466_213494•
*JEA:	They knew anyway. •213507_213579•
        They knew that he'd been here. •213633_213725•
        Er and I mean Paul wasn't trying to dodge anything. •213725_214039•
*BRE:	No. •214078_214084•
        Well that's what they say if there's, even people that come over here for a holiday for three months  have to pay it don't they? •214253_214782•
*JEA:	Yes. •214782_214791•
*BRE:	Sort of twice. •214826_214860•
*JEA:	So  er  and god knows what it's costing them to collect. •214917_215475•
*BRE:	Did Neil have to pay it? •215485_215582•
*JEA:	Oh yes. •215636_215675•
        Not, not the full amount. •215688_215798•
*BRE:	Mm. •215827_215833•
*JEA:	He pays the small amount and in fact I keep on meaning at the back of my brain  to get hold of him and say has he been paying it. •215898_216662•
        Cos when, when he was down at Andy's Aerials I think he used to go on foot to the post office every week. •216880_217507•
        When he got his  giro I think he used to pay  then and there. •217510_217910•
        It's only about a pound eighty a week or something for him. •218005_218480•
*BRE:	Mm. •218480_218486•
*JEA:	He was paying it and I must make sure that he is paying it. •218594_218803•
*BRE:	Yeah you'd better check it cos if, those one er pound eighty adds up don't they? •218833_219185•
*JEA:	Oh yes if it, it will be moi who has to foot the bill. •219196_219479•
        There's no question on that one. •219505_219692•
*BRE:	No. •219692_219699•
        No what about erm  your other friends. •219699_219943•
        What, what are they gonna do? •219943_220057•
        The ones that have got their, Shirley and Terry that have got their house on the market? •220057_220361•
*JEA:	They're not sure whether they're going to sell because er  •220480_220812•
*BRE:	Can they afford to stay? •220965_221080•
*JEA:	Marginally, now that Shirley has got a job. •221194_221439•
        That   •221448_221457•
*BRE:	So they just sort of put it on the market to see if it would sell? •221523_221758•
*JEA:	Well at the time they put it on the market we, we all three thought that it would be a good idea if, if both families  sold up and moved into something smaller and perhaps moved  near to each other  •221817_223060•
*BRE:	each other. •223199_•
*JEA:	in Stowmarket. •223215_223291•
        But now I, I just don't think that's going to happen. •223398_223673•
        I, I don't, I honestly Brenda I don't know whether I'm going to come back down here. •223673_224079•
        Whether I'm going to move to Norwich. •224157_224297•
        Whether I'm going to stay in Stowmarket. •224317_224514•
        So to be truthful Brenda, I'm happier not thinking about it. •224577_225049•
*BRE:	You've just gotta  what mood, the mood sort of takes you. •225062_225421•
*JEA:	Exactly. •225421_225480•
        Er at the moment I'm, I mean I'm even thinking of, of redecorating  my bedroom. •225480_226025•
*BRE:	Dave even came up with an idea we was talking about the other day. •226124_226463•
        And he said what, why doesn't Jean rent? •226463_226668•
        Put your money in the capital, rent and live on the capital. •226874_227218•
        Let the interest rent. •227251_227357•
*JEA:	Well I have thought about that vaguely Brenda. •227603_227884•
        It'll all depend on what the situation is when I sell. •227963_228259•
*BRE:	He said that cos then, you know he said she would have no upkeep of the house. •228321_228619•
*JEA:	Mm. •228694_228700•
        That's right. •228700_228734•
        That's right. •228734_228845•
        But I, I don't know whether Dave has, I mean  you see  my friend Pam  whose husband Steve is an airline pilot  she knows quite a bit about this because  Steve was an illegitimate child in London, in West Ham. •228895_230857•
        His mother was an office cleaner  and she conceived Steve by a married man. •230923_231490•
        Erm a poor, working class man. •231605_231803•
        No question of a divorce and marriage, she just had to get on with it. •231861_232193•
        She was able to keep Steve because where she lived  within the er there was a little coronet of little tatty houses that have since been pulled down  and she was related to fifteen  in fifteen out of the twenty two houses she had a relative. •232193_233813•
*BRE:	Mm. •233879_233885•
*JEA:	So she could always dump the baby on somebody. •233900_234120•
*BRE:	Mm. •234120_234127•
*JEA:	She'd got built-in babysitting facilities. •234133_234281•
        And  Steve knows a lot about being poor. •234309_234744•
        And Pam said that Steve said to her that when he was at West Ham grammar school, boys grammar school  everybody knew that the people who were best off were the council house people. •234768_235746•
*BRE:	Mm. •235850_235862•
*JEA:	If you were in private accommodation you were , you were nothing like so well off. •235862_236365•
        You see I have lived in private rented accommodation  with my mother in the late nineteen thirties. •236441_237149•
*BRE:	I'll just open these doors cos it'll be too cold to go out there once we go out. •237191_237776•
        so cold with the glass •237776_238008•
*JEA:	Mm. •238024_238041•
*BRE:	and the trouble is if you don't have the   here •238223_238565•
*JEA:	Yes . •238684_238693•
*BRE:	to circulate and •238716_239145•
*JEA:	And the trouble is that the, the, the English landlord has a name for being greedy. •239145_239522•
        And it, it wasn't very nice Brenda because  landlords are entitled to inspect where you live. •239534_240540•
        Or they were. •240540_240679•
*BRE:	Yeah but you wouldn't I mean like Dave said because er  •240679_240952•
*JEA:	Because it wasn't very comfortable. •240973_241040•
        You can't do exactly what you want  in, in a rented place. •241040_241385•
        You can't go putting up shelves and things  •241393_241613•
*BRE:	Yeah but in searching I mean  Sorry? •241613_241716•
*JEA:	You can't go putting up shelves. •241716_241829•
        If you put shelves on the wall in a rented house  those those shelves immediately belong to the landlord. •241829_242653•
*BRE:	Mm. •242653_242685•
*JEA:	That was the law then. •242954_243087•
        It may not be so now. •243087_243196•
*BRE:	No I was gonna say yeah because  I know Cheryl and Andy they, they had er erm  they rented a four bedroom detached house. •243196_243950•
        And they even actually decorated. •244002_244228•
        The landlord said to him you know  she, she she sort of took a lease out for three years on it. •244228_244933•
*JEA:	Yes. •244933_244939•
        But until recently  there hasn't been a lot of rented accommodation. •245010_245606•
        And  landlords have probably been quite pleased to get a decent tenant. •245606_246313•
        When my Mary-Ann had her rented rooms in Herne Hill  they had the top floor of a  of a three floor house. •246333_247198•
        And their landlord who was Polish was ever so delighted with them. •247210_247723•
        And he said, you know he talked to them and he said you can do whatever you like  because  Mary-Ann and Mitch were superior people. •247741_248336•
        They were going to keep the place clean. •248338_248506•
        They were going to keep it warm. •248506_248691•
        They weren't going to, to have wild parties. •248695_248972•
*BRE:	Mm. •248972_248992•
        But, but her place she had  erm it was unfurnished erm  but it was fantastic. •248998_249735•
*JEA:	Dave has got a point. •249735_249960•
        And the thought has crossed my mind. •249960_250122•
        And thank him very much for his idea and I will •250126_250400•
*BRE:	He makes me laugh cos he often says , when I, it's when I've spoken to you on the phone •250400_250844•
*JEA:	Yeah. •250858_250867•
*BRE:	and I'll come back and he'll say  has Jean thought about renting Bren? •250867_251137•
        I said she don't wanna rent and he said why? •251137_251364•
        He said if she then sold her house he said  put the capital he said  alright he said she  with not buying a you know, another house now  you know the fact is he said alright  if she got one in her area or wherever. •251364_252669•
        He said then she can put her capital he says and the interest on the capital •252669_253071•
*JEA:	Mm. •253071_253079•
*BRE:	that can pay the rent. •253081_253209•
*JEA:	Mm. •253209_253235•
        But you see •253235_253279•
*BRE:	And I said yeah but then she's got no house  to lead to a •253461_253846•
*JEA:	Mm. •253846_253867•
        And you're at the mercy of the landlord putting the rent up Brenda. •253867_254152•
        I mean I know that people have been hit by the mortgage rise and of course in my lifetime  I've never known anything like this. •254152_254953•
        Nobody has. •254993_255068•
*BRE:	Well like I mean I said to him I don't think, you know I mean  it was just ideas I think he said I'm not saying do it. •255082_255627•
*JEA:	Yes. •255627_255650•
        And I'm glad of people's ideas because •255650_255801•
*BRE:	But I said I don't think it's a good idea. •255802_256013•
        And  and I said he's got, you know she'd have nothing to leave. •256013_256367•
        And he said yeah but both her children are  •256367_256536•
*JEA:	Well my children are not worried about that. •256536_256657•
*BRE:	That's what he said. •256657_256756•
        He said they're both  you know  •256756_256833•
*JEA:	No they're not. •256833_256867•
        They're not. •256867_256919•
*BRE:	he said  he said not knowing her children he said but knowing what he sort of picked up about your kids •256919_257461•
*JEA:	Mm. •257461_257484•
        Mm. •257493_257508•
        Mm. •257508_257521•
*BRE:	he said. •257521_257534•
        You know to them he said it wouldn't be matter if there was nothing. •257534_257800•
*JEA:	No it wouldn't. •257820_257917•
*BRE:	Because they're both sort of comfortable and •257917_258059•
*JEA:	Very. •258059_258065•
*BRE:	you know and •258065_258164•
*JEA:	Very. •258202_258215•

*JEA:	Quite. •259260_259261•
        Quite. •259261_259272•
*BRE:	Look after me. •259272_259380•
*JEA:	They don't want that. •259380_259478•
        They do not, no  •259479_259572•
*BRE:	You know they don't want it. •259572_259676•
        Erm  different if you was really ill. •259677_259844•
*JEA:	Oh yes. •259844_259889•

*BRE:	Erm  but then you haven't got the security of renting I don't think. •260671_261167•
        Like you say you're at the mercy. •261167_261363•
*JEA:	Mm. •261363_261385•
*BRE:	I mean the fact you can do things and, alright you haven't got the upkeep if repairs need doing  but I think that keeps you going. •261385_262170•

*BRE:	I, I agree you don't need that great big house. •262577_262924•
*JEA:	No I don't. •262924_263028•
