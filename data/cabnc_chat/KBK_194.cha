@Comment:	conversation #194 (Tape 002902)
*CHR:	David is looking for somewhere to put his croquet club. •162022_167232•
*NOR:	What do you mean by that? •167232_170842•
*CHR:	Well he's got a croquet club without a ground. •170842_173282•
*NOR:	Oh you mean a club? •174302_175202•
        A number of people not a club stick? •176992_179482•
        It's not called like a golf club that you hit the ball with? •181892_185142•
*CHR:	Ah! •186002_186212•
        Correct. •186242_186742•
        He's looking for ground land. •187582_189662•
*NOR:	Not looking much of a hurry •189752_197462•
*CHR:	What's that thing out there hydrants or something? •197832_200722•
*NOR:	On which to play croquet? •202562_203942•
*CHR:	Yes. •204542_204992•
*NOR:	He  occasionally he gets by the club. •205112_209442•
*NOR:	Uncomfortable next to the Tigers. •209442_210892•
*CHR:	Excuse me. •213432_218922•
*NOR:	Erm. •219142_219202•
        Yes he was he is the Secretary of Eden Park Croquet Club which was an offshoot of Eden Park Cricket Club. •219202_227152•
*CHR:	Where is Eden Park? •227402_229252•
*NOR:	It's between Beckenham and Croydon. •229702_231852•
        And •234582_234902•
*CHR:	They don't have anywhere to play? •234902_237692•
*NOR:	at the moment they don't have anywhere to play. •237692_239462•
*CHR:	What do you need for a croquet club? •239892_243452•
*NOR:	Well you need ideally some space for about four or five tennis courts to run •243452_247662•
*CHR:	Quite a lot •248012_248782•
*NOR:	Well that would run you three lawns  •249342_252052•
*CHR:	How big is a lawn? •252052_253362•
*NOR:	which would be ideal. •253422_254362•
*CHR:	As big as a tennis court? •254362_256412•
*NOR:	I believe it's twenty four by sixteen ideally. •256412_260312•
*CHR:	Is that bigger than a tennis court? •260582_262022•
*NOR:	It's about the size of a double tennis court apparently. •262022_265652•
*CHR:	Double tennis court? •266072_268102•
*NOR:	Mhm. •268732_268922•
*CHR:	Gosh! •268922_269032•
*NOR:	With the surrounds. •269032_270232•
*CHR:	Presumably you can't use it for anything else because it needs to be very smooth and perfect. •275372_281322•
        Is there cold air blowing in this car? •281322_285342•
*NOR:	It's hot air blowing in. •285342_286512•
*CHR:	I know  any air but something's blowing. •286512_289102•
        You can erm  you can't use it for anything else but croquet? •294062_316162•
*NOR:	No. •316162_316222•
        But then it's not a very big area. •316222_318922•
        You know as you can't use a tennis court for anything else or bowling green for anything else. •318922_323192•
*CHR:	No. •323192_323252•
        But it does sound quite a big area to me if you haven't got the land in the first place. •323452_327902•
        It would mean somebody's got to give up something. •327902_331362•
*NOR:	You could fit it on a bowling green. •331652_333062•
*CHR:	But then who wants to give up a bowling green? •333822_335862•
*NOR:	Well I'm talking of space. •336282_337512•
        The area you need. •337932_339702•
*CHR:	You've got the area. •339702_340582•
        That's fine but you haven't got any land at all. •340582_342492•
*NOR:	Mm. •342812_342882•
*CHR:	It's quite a lot of land to find. •343382_345262•
*NOR:	Absolutely true. •345562_348122•
*CHR:	It's not like somebody's back garden. •348122_349802•
*NOR:	Yep. •350572_350732•
*CHR:	So where were they playing today? •365772_369522•
*NOR:	They went to Dulwich. •370702_372202•
*CHR:	Is there a croquet club there? •373052_374662•
*NOR:	Yes. •374822_375592•
        Burbidge Road. •375682_376762•
        Which is where Carlos used to live. •377162_378772•
*CHR:	How many croquet clubs are there around here? •380762_382412•
*NOR:	Very few. •385002_385542•
        Sydenham is possible. •386822_388982•
        ran an evening class affair. •389092_391482•
*CHR:	Not one in Bromley? •393922_394852•
*NOR:	No. •395082_395142•
        There's nothing in Bromley. •395182_396412•
        Apparently the Mayor last year or the Mayoress er was rather keen and organized a match between the Dulwich Club and her team nominally which turned out to be made up of masters from Dulwich College . •397112_420412•
        Well apparently they have a lawn and they play it. •421212_423462•
*CHR:	Well yes  people who play. •423902_427062•
*NOR:	Oh you need people who know the game anyway. •427062_429022•
        Then •429702_430102•
*CHR:	Oh no. •430102_430522•
        You need to know how to play. •430662_433622•
*NOR:	Oh indeed you do. •434662_435162•
        Mighty complicated it is too. •435832_437462•
*CHR:	Well I was reading that article in the Sunday Times with you and the chap who's the champion said he liked it because it's like chess and bridge. •438742_448152•
*NOR:	Mm. •448282_448352•
        Mm. •448352_448472•
*CHR:	A game of strategy. •448472_450412•
*NOR:	Or I mean David was saying you can do this you can do that you can do the other you can do this. •450932_456332•
        I I my mind was absolutely blown by the end. •457202_460552•
        It it was almost impossible to erm  •460922_463502•
*CHR:	If you were  •463502_465452•
*NOR:	latch on to everything. •466702_467602•
*CHR:	starting out out. •467892_468672•
        Doing it from scratch. •469292_470192•
        If somebody was used to teaching croquet they wouldn't tell you everything all at once. •470192_474592•
        And you can gradually build up. •476312_477542•
*NOR:	Well he was coaching me and he was very good. •477712_480922•
*CHR:	Oh good. •481242_481892•
*NOR:	Very good. •481892_482532•
        I can understand why he has been invited to coach. •482742_484892•
        Very good. •487302_487962•
