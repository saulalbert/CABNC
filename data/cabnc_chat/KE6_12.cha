*WEN:	Yeah, trying to get up there I mean you're waiting to see the show aren't you?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	So er, it's quite different ain't it   (.) still it's not a bad time to come out
*BEV:	No
*WEN:	is it?And I mean being that he parked there it was perfect weren't it?Didn't have a long walk or anything     (.)  ((yawn))  (.) so the next schedule go out is erm is
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	is it?
*BEV:	I don't know, is there skittles somewhere?
*WEN:	I don't know what they're doing of, I haven't a clue

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	mm
*BEV:	So, right here

*BEV:	Eh?
*WEN:	Pretty busy in that restaurant
*BEV:	Well people do go out to restaurants
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	I think it's marvellous they go out to a restaurant
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	but
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	really, have you?
*WEN:	Can't can I go on me own
*BEV:	Of course you can
*WEN:	You can't go on your own, what's, what's there in it going on your own?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	oh I know, please
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	mm?
*BEV:	stuck, he's stuck again   (.) isn't he?
*WEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	oh you might get him interested in different things
*WEN:	Ha, what
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	you never know
*WEN:	Could do
*BEV:	you're never too old to change
*WEN:	I'm not so sure about that one
*BEV:	Oh well   (.) oh dear
*WEN:	It was good weren't it?
*BEV:	It's brilliant  (.) 
*WEN:	But er Helen, she missed the best one, ah?It was better than the other one, it might of been the seats but I don't think so because I mean there was so much in this one
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	I mean the other was a nice story, but, I think this year's is better
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	more for the show
*WEN:	Yeah it was more of a show than a story weren't it?But there was something
*BEV:	It brought you to the place and then
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	and then it just it
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	erupted
*WEN:	Yeah it did   (.) my feet ache now
*BEV:	My feet are aching now, I've got thick tights on
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	shoes
*WEN:	I know
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	but I didn't know how cold it'll be, but
*BEV:	That's not a brilliant idea 
*WEN:	you see , no it isn't a brilliant idea but the thing is we didn't have much further to walk can we?
*BEV:	Yes
*WEN:	We could of done
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	the what?
*BEV:	I think
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	 [yawning] yeah, you are, great  [] 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	oh I put my half off, I doubt if I get my feet back in them, but, yeah
*UNK:	 (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*WEN:	 ((laugh)) oh dear
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	ah so you are, sure you will, sure you will
*BEV:	Then I can sew it up and I've only got the
*WEN:	One sleeve, oh
*BEV:	one sleeve
*WEN:	it's gonna be a good one you know
*BEV:	I hope so
*WEN:	I can see it, you know, it looks it right
*BEV:	When it gets the toggles on it should be okay
*WEN:	The what?
*BEV:	When it gets the toggles on it should be okay 
*WEN:	Yeah , but it looks like it's gonna be good some of them 
*BEV:	I don't know what one to do next really
*WEN:	Well you'll have to decide I mean you 
*BEV:	I think I'll do another plain one, but this one, some were plain
*WEN:	Yeah 
*BEV:	but  (.) 
*WEN:	mm
*BEV:	erm, that chunky one
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	it's not just plain, there's so many stitches   (.) erm stocking stitch and so many rib
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	so
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	it'll have some pattern but not
*WEN:	terrific amount
*BEV:	a terrific
*WEN:	mm
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	cos it has two bands of rib
*WEN:	Yeah   [yawning] oh, oh, oh god   [] well 
*BEV:	Then you can help me unpick it
*WEN:	 ((laugh)) Well that won't take long to unpick it will it?
*BEV:	No   (.) it hadn't been knitted up too long
*WEN:	No
*BEV:	that's what I don't want for it to er
*WEN:	Yeah
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	crinkle too quickly
*WEN:	Yeah, anyway once it's washed it's all gone anyway
*BEV:	Oh yeah  (.) 
*WEN:	so really that's not a problem
*BEV:	No   (.) but as you, I'll use that what's not a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	ha, ha, I bet you will, it won't take that long to unpick it though   (.) but I mean you've got a, quite a selection there to choose haven't you?
*BEV:	Yeah, oh if I can undo that one then I can do the sleeve
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	cos that'll be quite
*WEN:	Mm?
*BEV:	that will be quite intra intricate
*WEN:	Yeah, not much bigger job anyway, innit?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Well I'll look, I'll see how much of that plum is left
*BEV:	I think there's quite a lot of plum and
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	you can't use that much can you?
*BEV:	I think it was two balls
*WEN:	Plenty then innit?For that and 
*BEV:	and you've got two, well what was in them?You would of got two cos you would of been a big one won't you?Just that colour
*WEN:	That's right, but I mean all I want it for is the erm
*BEV:	Body
*WEN:	the body and use the black
*BEV:	Two black feet
*WEN:	That's right   (.) I think it looked very effective what that woman had on
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	so
*BEV:	can do one like that with that mustard up the top shelf 
*WEN:	Yeah it's nice innit?
*BEV:	with the black
*WEN:	That would stand out wouldn't it?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	That would be nice, you won't want that much for the sleeve
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	of black, so, do anything with black for ages
*BEV:	I saw your Andrew the other day
*WEN:	Eh?
*BEV:	I would think Andrew doing some
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Probably would 
*BEV:	three pound balls and three pound thirty, er three pound twenty seven
*WEN:	How much was it nine?Yeah it was nine, that's right, no it could be quite interesting actually, and then the other way
*BEV:	Or then you'd do like the four, four, four flares
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	flat back
*WEN:	Yeah, it's limitless innit, but the other way is to do right down the centre, one on one and one on the other
*BEV:	Yeah  (.) 
*WEN:	reverse it on the back or have the same on the back
*BEV:	No what, what you normally do with those is er, say one half black and one half yellow and you have a yellow sleeve that side
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	and a black sleeve that side
*WEN:	 [yawning] that's right  [] , limitless innit? (.) But it would be wise to use the plum before I got the cerise or the sea green
*BEV:	Well it would
*WEN:	Yeah, of course it would, well it only sat there anyway again innit?
*BEV:	Of course it does
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	 ((laugh)) 
*BEV:	haven't we?
*WEN:	Well we always do, I mean if you'd use all that was in that cupboard you'd have half a dozen jumpers
*BEV:	I know
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	Well I shall use the mohair next
*WEN:	Yeah, well there must be a fair amount of mohair
*BEV:	There is  (.) 
*WEN:	I mean that was an exceptionally good buy weren't it?
*BEV:	Well what I want is the black and the cerise
*WEN:	Mm  (.) 
*BEV:	because I'm not sure whether to put all different colours in
*WEN:	Well I think, I'd just experiment
*BEV:	or the black and the cerise and all the jacquards 
*WEN:	but you must yeah
*BEV:	because that could be quite effective
*WEN:	That would be effective, but I mean you don't want to do any that you've got to unpick, no that 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	is not viable that
*BEV:	Yeah, that's why I think if I did all the jacquard in the cerise
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	that would show up beautiful
*WEN:	Mm, yeah I think it would
*BEV:	because what they've done on that pattern, why they've got so many different colours, where it mixes so you've got your red and your 
*WEN:	Mm 
*BEV:	green, they've got like an orangey
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	you know where it crosses
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	you know like that one of Howard's jumper
*WEN:	Yeah, yeah
*BEV:	well they've got it so that the colours in the middle
*WEN:	Sort of mingle
*BEV:	mingle
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	and like you've sort of got a yellow and a green, they've put like an olive in that, an olive colour, but I haven't got colours that I can
*WEN:	No
*BEV:	mix like that 
*WEN:	not like that no
*BEV:	No, that's the thing
*WEN:	Oh well, oh, as long as you don't have to unpick, because that is awful
*BEV:	Oh I know
*WEN:	It's just a mess innit after?
*BEV:	Yeah, but I don't know it'll be quite effective
*WEN:	Yeah, oh yeah, but as I say it's limitless really
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	especially with a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	unless I go up that shop, top shop and have a look at those gramme balls, yellow, oranges
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	red and got those to put in the black
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	but there again my er 
*WEN:	How much were they?
*BEV:	Ninety nine P
*WEN:	Oh, that's not so bad is it?
*BEV:	No but there again
*WEN:	But there again you're buying again
*BEV:	Well I'd put in the cerise and have all the jacquard colours, it, it would look very effective
*WEN:	Mm it certainly would, it doesn't have to be different colours
*BEV:	No, no it doesn't   (.) how many black ones are there?
*WEN:	I can't remember
*BEV:	Two
*WEN:	No I don't think there was two
*BEV:	No just one
*WEN:	I think there was only one because they only had one, and I got one white cos they only had one I think, it was the other colours I'm sure I'd got two of, I must of done, cos I mean I've used a lot myself don't I?
*BEV:	Yeah  (.) 
*WEN:	No I, I would think the black and the white were one, but mind you it goes a long blinking way don't it?
*BEV:	Well I
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah   (.) but I think it was only one and one of those two, I, I'd picked the white up because there wasn't any black, for that first time
*BEV:	Mm
*WEN:	because I thought that was neutral didn't I? (.) 
*BEV:	Erm
*WEN:	I don't know if I had them or not
*BEV:	I wonder if I've seen one of those
*WEN:	Three hundred again I think    (.)  [yawning] it was   [] it was six balls weren't it?Two, four, six
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	but they want seven and I want to put that big bit at the bottom.
*WEN:	Have I used any black?I haven't have I?
*BEV:	No 
*WEN:	No  (.) 
*BEV:	Or was it seventy five ball?
*WEN:	I dunno
*BEV:	No
*WEN:	I think it was fifty, I do, but I'm not sure   (.) oh perhaps if we can get over there at the end of the, well it's the end of the month next week anyway innit?
*BEV:	Oh
*WEN:	I mean, you don't know what they've got over there now do you?I mean basically we go there and the meat shop don't we?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	There's not much else we want to look around at is there?
*BEV:	We wanna look at shoes
*WEN:	Shoes I
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	yeah
*BEV:	But then again it's not a brilliant idea going on a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	for wool when we've got so many
*WEN:	Oh yeah
*BEV:	cos we'll come back loaded up  (.) 
*WEN:	haven't got it right actually, I mean basically we can go up the top shop and buy what we like can't we?Get one, O nine, I mean providing you've got enough to do what you want to do in mohair
*BEV:	I don't know
*WEN:	no you'd have to get all out and have a look, but I mean if I go over there I'll bring back a load of D K and I know I will   (.) we'll see.
*BEV:	Well you see the trouble is when we're buying it over there right
*WEN:	You get the left overs
*BEV:	we buy six hundred
*WEN:	Six hundred, yeah
*BEV:	which is two hundred per person 
*WEN:	Yeah, well you see it's quite a point you know, cos if we go up the top shop, we just, well the most I would buy is four
*BEV:	Well that's four pound, four pound 
*WEN:	Well that's what four pound and four nines 
*BEV:	Forty 
*WEN:	thirty six
*BEV:	Four pound thirty six where you'd pay two pounds, four pounds for two hundred grammes
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	mm, dunno well we'll see anyway, it depends on you and what you're doing
*BEV:	But there again it's better wool that you're buying from the
*WEN:	What, at the top shop?
*BEV:	Yeah
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BEV:	yeah
*WEN:	Yeah, that's a very old make you know, that one's been going for donkey years, but it's those colours, I mean there's at least, well with the o 
*BEV:	Well the trouble is we go over there and we buy a good buy
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	but it might not be the colours that we're actually looking for 
*WEN:	Well I, I'm sure it wouldn't be, what did I say I said that sea green and the cerise
*BEV:	And I said the mustard
*WEN:	The mustard and the beigey one weren't it?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Er oatmeal
*BEV:	Er, yeah
*WEN:	Well that's, that's two jumpers each innit?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	I mean I've got plenty of black, so mustard and black whatever, whatever, cerise and black or something, that's daft really you know
*BEV:	It's very silly
*WEN:	I mean nine times out of ten we erm, we just go over there and buy what's there
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	regardless when we come back well what are you going to make with it?
*BEV:	See, that's what I've bought patterns now
*WEN:	Yeah, no well I think that, thinking about it seriously now
*BEV:	What I want to find one is one without a well
*WEN:	Without a well?
*BEV:	Yeah, so it can hang over trousers
*WEN:	Oh I see
*BEV:	A long one
*WEN:	What like a sweat top or some of them does 
*BEV:	Yeah, yeah 
*WEN:	but I er 
*BEV:	We know that one, that woman was wearing that white one 
*WEN:	Yeah yeah, yeah
*BEV:	now something like that, that can go over a skirt
*WEN:	Or anything and it's very versatile
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	No, thinking about it seriously it would be better to go up there, have a swifty through patterns you know, you need a bit of time
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	you need a bit of time
*BEV:	but then again it'll take me longer to find that one this morning
*WEN:	Oh, that was when I was waiting in the queue weren't it?
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Mm, it really 
*BEV:	it caught my eye and I thought well
*WEN:	Yeah, it really is stupid having all these left overs, alright as I said before I can make all that kid stuff, but in the end I've got too much to take over
*BEV:	Yeah   (.) and then again you don't always wanna, erm start all along, with them do you?
*WEN:	No
*BEV:	And then you've got different colours that don't really go with that, but  (.) 
*WEN:	Anyway I mean I've got a fair pile now to take in August ain't I?
*BEV:	Yeah  (.) 
*WEN:	No I, well the, the colours that I like you know the cerise and the
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	the green, I can, I, he's says to buy four of them without thinking about it cos they're so nice and that's really the thing that we don't do when we go to Basingstoke we start going around saying well which one shall I have, but they said that you haven't looked at it like I've looked at those and you looked at yours because that oatmeal colour will be very, very handy for erm sticking with anything and everything
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Well I mean I've looked round here for a pair of blinking shoes, the only trouble here er had over here is that I've got to go somewhere where they're wide enough and that's
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Littlewoods innit? (.) The only ones here that did a wider fitting that one, er at the time I bought some, well those with the gold on the back was Stead and Simpson and they did a wider fitting, but I don't know anybody else, but they may now
*BEV:	Probably do now
*WEN:	they may now, but erm, I mean these I've got on are Williams, they're an E fit that I, I particularly sent away for
*BEV:	Yeah
*WEN:	Well I don't want to do that any more cos you've got to wait three damn weeks nearly for the blasted things to come and then if they're no good you've got to send them back.
*BEV:	Yeah, but there again you see   (.) they're, you're not going into a shop saying oh they look nice
*WEN:	No, anyway those plimsolls they're, they're alright
*BEV:	Yeah 
*WEN:	now I said the others, they've got to be lace-ups though look, it's gotta be lace-ups 
*BEV:	It must be easier to find wider
*WEN:	Yeah because I mean if there, if you've got a high instep it still don't matter because you only widen your laces don't you?
*BEV:	Yeah 
*WEN:	Well perhaps I'll have a look in town next Friday then, I could definitely do with a pair
*BEV:	 [yawning] Well we could even, oh dear   [] we could even go
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	oh dear
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	 ((laugh)) yeah
*BEV:	don't we?
*WEN:	yeah   (.) yeah we do cos it's there innit?Quite right
*BEV:	If we're gonna spend money you might as well go to Littlewoods or
*WEN:	Mm
*BEV:	somewhere where it's decent

*WEN:	Yeah, but not only that when you get a couple of dickheads like we had
*BEV:	Oh I know
*WEN:	you know you've got to watch them, they're not watching you, you've got to watch them
*BEV:	That's what puts me off, when we have those two
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	and we went on that other side
*WEN:	Well we'll have to watch it this week and if er
*BEV:	That annoys me when I get 
*WEN:	Yeah 
*BEV:	people like that
*WEN:	Well it does me on a night like that, because the majority of people are either having a damn good lazy swim
*BEV:	But there's the lanes, there are nights when it's just even lanes 
*WEN:	I know yeah
*BEV:	so they just have
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	no, very annoying that, I mean that bloke going backwards and forwards is bad enough but

*WEN:	but then obviously that's all he does or what he does   (.) I mean which is
*BEV:	Yeah, but he's not a bad swimmer
*WEN:	Well he don't seem to be a bad swimmer at all he really don't 
*BEV:	he just don't like going down to the deep end 
*WEN:	Maybe   (.) but it is difficult when people do that because I mean the majority of us are going up and down and you get this one that's going across and 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	but the majority of people on a Tuesday night are going for a leisurely swim aren't they?
*BEV:	Yeah, they're going for a swim
*WEN:	Yeah
*BEV:	but
*WEN:	but not tearing about, anyway if they're
