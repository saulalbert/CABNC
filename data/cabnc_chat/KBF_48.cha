*BRE:	Course you can. •_•
        The decorator  that are in at Peter's at the moment  erm  they do everything. •_•
        They're fantastic. •_•
        And he was saying he said oh you've been good you've been feeding us with cups of teas. •_•
        They charge seventy pound a day per person and he said oh we'll charge you next to nothing. •_•
        He said in fact we'll come down  and he said, cos the er it's cracked round the outside. •_•
        He said and we'll take it up and repair it for you. •_•
        He said we might sort of say to you right we want fifty quid. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*BRE:	But he said we won't charge you the daily rate, we'll just charge you for the job. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        No. •_•
        No. •_•
        Yeah. •_•

        We're fed up with carpets and stain. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BRE:	I mean this carpet's three years old. •_•
        I mean it's •_•
*JEA:	I know. •_•
        I know. •_•
*BRE:	it's even going here now. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•

        And Peter's had that and he's had dado, and the dado bars! •_•
*JEA:	Ah! •_•
*BRE:	They look so nice. •_•
*JEA:	What a lot of people are doing is  they're not putting up rails but they're putting up a  erm a border  halfway up aren't they, or just not quite halfway up the wall. •_•
        Have you seen that? •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
