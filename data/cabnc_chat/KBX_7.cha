*DON:	Oh yes •518959_519409•
*NON:	It seems to be on the same lines don't it? •519749_521779•
*DON:	Yes, because Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were all witnesses of Jesus' ministry on the earth weren't they? •521789_528879•
*NON:	Mhm •528899_529049•
*DON:	And erm, they recorded different things, but but also they recorded the same things as well •529339_536569•

*NON:	Mm •556529_556869•
*DON:	because many I tell you will seek to get in, but will not be able  •557559_561849•
*NON:	Mm •561849_562279•
*DON:	So •563249_563439•
*NON:	going back to the, the other chapter •563629_565839•
*DON:	See we, if I can just say Mark now, you and I know this truth,people in the world generally don't know what you and I know do they? •565839_574099•
        That's why the •574599_575779•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	of the kingdom must go from door to door, from city to city from village to village, they don't know about it, but once we do know about it then we're sort of accountable aren't we? •575779_586639•

*NON:	must of had a bearing on him saying that •647539_649129•

*NON:	Mhm  •653839_654069•
*DON:	Because then Jesus said to him, who was he talking to, let's, let's start off on the verse one  after er after he had come down from the mountains, great crowds followed him  that's Jesus isn't it? •654199_667879•

*NON:	That's the old faith int it? •744019_745389•
*DON:	Exactly, Jesus was saying to this officer that I'll cure your master when I get there •745389_750549•
*NON:	Mm •750549_750589•

        Hearing that Jesus became amazed and said to those following him, I tell you the truth but no one in Israel have I faced to a greater face  so that's quite some statement that Jesus has made  •785569_798749•
*NON:	Mhm  •798749_798979•
*DON:	now we don't learn a lot about, we don't know much about this army officer except what we've just read, and even though the, we, we know of quite a few people in the bible, he says in Israel there's no one with greater faith than this army officer, so he's quite some man isn't he? •798979_814309•
