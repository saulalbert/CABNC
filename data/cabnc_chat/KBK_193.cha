*NOR:	When does this finish? •48025_64825•
*CHR:	Tonight. •76025_80625•
        I might carry on a bit tomorrow. •89325_102625•
        Depending on how many few tapes whatever I've done. •114325_142125•
*NOR:	How many   •142925_146625•
*CHR:	I don't think they've said that. •180925_195725•
        They've given me twenty or twenty four •197425_221925•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	twenty tapes. •231225_240225•
        I've done just over fifty percent of them so far. •252325_274125•
        No. •277525_288125•
        I've done about fifty percent I think. •288925_305425•
        I've just put in tape ten so we're nearly half way there. •315825_352225•
        There's no obligation to fill all the tapes. •359025_383525•
*NOR:	No and anyway it depends where you are   dinner party  talking to you. •384025_574025•
        It will be difficult   •574025_621225•
*CHR:	Yes. •639425_640725•
        It's very strange approaching Petswood from this side isn't it? •642425_676725•
        You either turn left to go to one side of Petswood or right to go to the other side of Petswood. •676725_711025•
        It's a  the railway provides quite a split. •713125_746425•
        It's a full car in front. •825125_836925•
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Mmm. •905925_907725•
        Teenagers probably. •909625_921225•
        Looking awfully big being rather young. •929225_959225•
*NOR:	Nice green  view. •995825_101522•
*CHR:	Good. •103042_103382•
*NOR:	I asked Suzannah what prompted her to go up to town tonight. •110212_114522•
        But she hasn't gone up there for ages. •114522_115992•
        She's  very low. •115992_120172•
        She was going to Spain for a holiday she and her friend Tracy •120232_126062•
*CHR:	Erm •126062_126192•
*NOR:	and Tracy has cried off. •126432_129032•
*CHR:	Oh dear! •129512_130102•
*NOR:	So she's had summer holiday plans fallen through. •130172_133652•
