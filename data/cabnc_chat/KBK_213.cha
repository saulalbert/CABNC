*CHR:	By Gosh! Hot stuff. 
*NOR:	Presumably they're awfully  (  )  
*CHR:	Yes. Hubbling bubbling oil. 
*NOR:	Whenever we come here we see somebody we know don't we? 
*CHR:	Do we? 
*NOR:	Mm. 
*CHR:	Who did we see the last time we were here? 
*NOR:	We saw Gill  ? 
*CHR:	Did we? Who's she? 
*NOR:	She used to live in   (  ) Close. Their younger daughter was the same age as Suzannah and went to   (  ) and went to the same national school. 
*CHR:	Oh really? 
*NOR:	Their elder daughter was in my guides. They went to Bromley High. Catherine was actually a year lower than Suzannah. They moved into Petts Wood into Birchwood Avenue. Then her husband left her. 
*CHR:	Oh gosh! 
*NOR:	They were divorced. We saw her here.  (  ) is still working in Sainsbury's. 
*CHR:	Does she? 
*NOR:	Saturday job. She works in the bakery. 
*CHR:	Oh. As opposed to an accountant. Where did she do her study or work or whatever? 
*NOR:	I think she did it in Orpington Tech. 
*NOR:	Aha. I bet Lynda's in for a lark for the next year. She's   (  ) round the corner when Raymond  (  ) . And then she'll come home some days and discover the place chockablock with students or three birds in bed with him or something. 
*NOR:	That's unlikely. I agree they are   (  )  (.)  
*CHR:	Sorry? 
*NOR:	 (  ) school again already.
