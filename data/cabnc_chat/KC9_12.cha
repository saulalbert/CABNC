*GIN:	Really! 
*UNK:	Mm, it's, it's, it's on this mornings news

*GIN:	Oh how awful. 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Oh that's awful. 
*UNK:	So. 
*GIN:	I wouldn't like it that dry. 
*UNK:	No. 
*GIN:	It's the same as that place in Australia where they haven't seen rain for seventeen years, I mean there's children who are grown up now at college have never seen a spot of rain, I'd hate that   (.) I'd rather have our, sometimes dismal climate. 
*UNK:	Well look how we get don't we, when er we've gone too long with   (  ) shower of rain 
*DIN:	Mm, mm. 
*UNK:	you know the  sun is nice   
*GIN:	 That's right  , 
*UNK:	and all that, but it the air get's so dry, that, that, you feel it wants dampening down. 
*GIN:	that's right, and when you do get the thunder storm well my family get into their bathing costumes and go out and stand in it because it's so lovely to have the rain. 
*DIN:	That's right. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) . 
*DIN:	Get away with that now. 
*GIN:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh))  (.) oh well, we, really the weather's not to bad, you, you haven't got to be to sensitive about things have you, you've got to just take it enjoy the lot, enjoy 
*GIN:	Yes, you have. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) . 
*GIN:	Yeah, so far we've been very lucky in, in Britain I think, apart from the hurricane damage, once or twice, on the whole our climates is not bad. 
*DIN:	Oh, you   (  )  . 
*UNK:	 Yeah, but, you're  mad getting worried to much, you know we had our green house all smashed up and everything and it's been  upsetting  , 
*GIN:	 Yes  . 
*UNK:	erm, when you think about after all  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Yes, exactly. 
*DIN:	Mm 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) . 
*GIN:	Exactly, you can't spend your life worrying about things, people are important. 
*UNK:	You've got to try and enjoy life. My wife's father er he said to me, cos he was, he worked hard you know, he had a tough life you know up in London and all that as, as a kid and that and he said to me what you want to do, enjoy everyday that you live, I said yeah, oh I said oh but you can't can you?, he said yes you can. I said but when you're doing the job that you don't like, oh don't do it he said don't do another one  ((laugh))  
*GIN:	Yes. 
*DIN:	 ((laugh)) . 
*GIN:	He's got the right out  (  ) . 
*DIN:	Too true. 
*GIN:	He's got the right out look. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) , but he died soon after that but he'd realised that he'd worked hard all his life 
*GIN:	Mm. 
*UNK:	you know 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*UNK:	really worked hard 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*UNK:	and at the end of it, see you always think that you're going on don't you? 
*GIN:	Mm, mm. 
*UNK:	and you think oh well I'll get my prize at the end. 
*GIN:	Mm. 
*DIN:	Mm. 
*UNK:	But, but, you don't know whether or not. 
*GIN:	 You never think this is my last day  . 
*UNK:	No, it can be can't it?  ((laugh)) . Go and enjoy every, every minute of it. 
*GIN:	Yeah, every days a bonus. 
*UNK:	Yeah, get, get the best out of it anyway  ((laugh)) . 
*GIN:	Yeah, you're quite right, or he's quite right. 
*UNK:	You don't have to worry too much about money do you really so long as you can manage with it. 
*GIN:	Ha  Harry, Harry Secombe is said after his heart attack there's no pocket in the shroud. 
*UNK:	No. 
*GIN:	Well he's right, there are no pocket's in a shroud and he's seemed much happier since. 
*UNK:	Yeah, oh yeah. 
*DIN:	 It's a shame with  . 
*UNK:	 That's what annoys me  with erm these big company's you know, opening on Sunday's really, because er, you can only get the money, I mean they've only got a certain amount 
*DIN:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	I mean if they could open nine days a week, they couldn't get any more money out of me because 
*GIN:	No, you haven't got it. 
*UNK:	No. 
*GIN:	No. 
*UNK:	 They're, they're  , 
*GIN:	 No, me neither  . 
*UNK:	all they're doing is erm, where people do it on a Saturday they, they won't do their, go football or something and then go on a Sunday, now I think it's nice to have a, a day when nothing happens. 
*GIN:	Yes, when it's all quite  all the shops are closed  . 
*DIN:	  (  )  . 
*UNK:	 Apart from religion or anything else, you know. 
*DIN:	Yeah, (  ) . 
*GIN:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	It, I think it's nicer when, when it 
*GIN:	Oh yes, not necessarily religious grounds I agree with you, it's just nice to have one day a week where everything is peaceful. 
*UNK:	That's right, yeah, where as it's now they're all going to open up, gonna go chasing  around   
*DIN:	 Just be like a Saturday  , (  ) . 
*UNK:	we shan't know which day, there'll be no weekend, will we really 
*GIN:	No. 
*UNK:	it won't be a weekend. 
*GIN:	No  (.)  
*UNK:	And that it's all for money and they're doing alright, I mean they're already making so many you know, millions they're making aren't they? 
*GIN:	Well the big ones are, yeah. 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*DIN:	Oh yes. 
*GIN:	There's only one thing, it might mean more part time jobs for college leavers and things if they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and they did, give them a foot up to start a job, then get taken on you know as   (.)  (  ) . 
*UNK:	But the one's that's gonna be hit I think are, people like old Lionel. 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*DIN:	Mm. 
*UNK:	Because he, he's not doing all that good you see, and when er, he, he re  he reckons on Sunday 
*GIN:	 Yeah Sunday morning  . 
*DIN:	  (  )  . 
*GIN:	But I prefer Lionel, I'll go round the supermarket's but I'll shop at Lionel's on the way back. 
*UNK:	We do, we don't buy  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Cos I can pick out his stuff or say I don't like the look of that one and he'll, he'll chuck it in the back. 
*UNK:	Mm, mm. 
*GIN:	And he'll often say to me look there's a fresh box under there, help yourself to what you want, i haven't opened that box. 
*UNK:	And, and if you complained about anything, er like we found, perhaps had a banana that's not been quite ripe, he'll give you two or three  the next time you go in if you say anything about it   
*GIN:	 Oh yes indeed, indeed  , well only last week I said do need some flowers, come on Thursday they're fresh, I said I want them now Lionel, I hate to be without flowers in the room and he said well have two for the price of one, he would insist that I had two bunches for the price of one. 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*GIN:	He's very good. 
*UNK:	I think he's alright really, he, he, suppose as fair as he can be. 
*GIN:	Yeah. 
*DIN:	 (  ) dogs. 
*GIN:	Yeah. Hello, good morning, good morning, all  (  ) . 
*UNK:	Can't   (  ) supermarket's gonna be open, I'll be getting their green grocery's down there and that   (  ) really. 
*GIN:	Yes. ((laugh)) . 
*UNK:	Told you it was a good idea to save throwing it. 
*GIN:	Brilliant. 
*DIN:	 (  ) to it. 
*GIN:	You taking them to Wimbledon? 
*DIN:	That's brilliant. 
*GIN:	My daughter says when, when did you go to Wimbledon? 
*GIN:	 (  ) . 
*DIN:	 (  )  hold a racket  . 
*GIN:	 Good ball boy    (.) a girl, quite right, gosh she's the same shape as Rocket. 
*GIN:	They're all good dogs, but he doesn't give it back though. 
*GIN:	He does  (  ) , oh yes he does. 
*GIN:	He might   (  ) he might do. 
*GIN:	She, she, yeah she's given it, (  ) oh well, we've got to walk old thing I suppose, and then go to Lionel's, get some more fresh fruit. You see they're again there you don't get it in a packet you can pick out the grapes you want. 
*UNK:	That's right, yeah. 
*GIN:	You can pick them out yourself. 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	Oh I, I find that    (  )  ((noise - train))quite good, you know. 
*GIN:	And also, you know sometimes he's prices are much better than the supermarket's  prices  . 
*UNK:	 Yeah  , mm. 
*GIN:	You don't have to pay for all that fancy lighting. 
*DIN:	I've noticed that some of the apples you've been getting from Safeway haven't been very good. 
*GIN:	No, Lionel's are better. 
*DIN:	They're quite sour. 
*GIN:	Mm, well apples at this time of the year are a bit sour. 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*DIN:	I'm sure Lionel's wouldn't be. 
*GIN:	Crunchy, yeah, true. 
*UNK:	I haven't had to buy any fresh  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Had enough on  the tree  . 
*DIN:	 Oh, you grow  your own, yeah. 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*UNK:	Well I have only got a few courts, 
*GIN:	Yes.

*GIN:	Mm, yeah. 
*UNK:	and they say not to eat apples and oranges, er, at one time they told you to eat the lot didn't they  apples a day keep the doctor's away  . 
*GIN:	 That's right, that's right   
*DIN:	See, I said it  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Yeah. 
*DIN:	And apples aren't all that digestible at times. 
*UNK:	 I think, and the acid  .

*GIN:	You know, it, it makes me smile sometimes when I say   (.) come and try the mo  modern politic approach to your ache, ache's and pains, your ailments. 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Most of it comes   (.) think so, I mean so much of it comes from the North American Indians that 
*DIN:	Mm. 
*GIN:	and right back into the er, the Keltic legions and the medieval monks. 
*DIN:	That's right, there's certainly a  (  ) . 
*GIN:	That's what I said to you, your dad when he didn't want to take Aspirins for his restrained back, and him, don't believe in these drugs and I said look, if a monk gave you this he'd, he'd give you the bark of a birch tree, pound it up in a pestle and water and you'd think it was magic   (.) and you'd take it and you, relax your muscles, is that what it is?, I said yes that's what Aspirin is originally   (.) birch bark. Well of course they used to use the poppy, for people in great pain 
*DIN:	Oh yeah, (  ) . 
*GIN:	amputations, child birth   (.) gosh the leaves are thick. 
*DIN:	Mm, they're lovely aren't they? When ever I see these big leaves you know these big ones 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*DIN:	they remind me of when I was at school. 
*GIN:	Sycamore oh, sycamore  and   (  )  . 
*DIN:	 used to get told to go out  in the Autumn and we used to get told by the, used to get taken out by the teacher into some woods and you would have to collect the leaves  (  ) . 
*GIN:	 Actually I   
*DIN:	 Could always  , could always see if   (  ) biggest, biggest leaves like these you know, (  ) . 
*GIN:	That is a Sycamore cos it isn't a, there isn't a conker tree around here that's Sycamore, there they are, that's it, that's a Sycamore tree, beautiful colour   (15.0) These are   (  ) Dances with Wolves. 
*DIN:	Oh, it's   (  ) in shop. 
*GIN:	If it's 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	If it's good, erm, can I say truthful  background of the Indians  . 
*DIN:	 Well, (  ) actually   (  )  and it might be based on a true story, don't know if it 
*GIN:	Do you remember when Vaughan was, Vaughan was doing his meditation 
*DIN:	Yeah. 
*GIN:	and he was trying to get in touch with a North American Indian, that a, thingamy in Wales was fixed up   
*DIN:	  (  )  . 
*GIN:	Wonder what ever came of that. 
*DIN:	Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about things like that, because you asked a straight forward and he goes way, way, over the head   
*GIN:	 Yeah, I know  , he does versify. 
*DIN:	and within three seconds my brain just switches off  ((laugh)) . 
*GIN:	Well I try to 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	I, I just ask him if, and it, the question that I'm interested in the answer to, like how did it go? and, now he talks at me for an hour until Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany, (  ) cos she can see I sort of trying to edge away  (.)  
*DIN:	 (  ) suddenly cross your legs, ouch  (  ) . 
*GIN:	That's a good idea. She said to me just say to him like I do enough Vaughany, don't want to hear any more. I said no, I, I would hate to offend him because it's all so well meant   (.) being a mother in law you have to watch it. 
*DIN:	 ((laugh)) , honestly you couldn't be much worse than  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Oh   (  ) mother in law is. 
*DIN:	  (  )  . 
*GIN:	 She's just  . 
*DIN:	I'm not buying her a present, I mean I'll chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if it comes, but we'll have to go to  (  ) , but erm, you know, she, (  )  . 
*GIN:	 As a person, you know, I'd never have any time  . Yes, yes, I mean you never, she lives in that great place and she's got no money   
*DIN:	  (  )  , they're not, they're not her presents are they, they're from Diane. 
*GIN:	No, of course, of course . 
*DIN:	So, I tell you what, if, if we do end up spending Christmas at   (  ) gonna give me the present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving Stella the   (  ) Christmas present  ((laugh)) . It so  (  ) . 
*GIN:	I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate her  but I  . 
*DIN:	 I couldn't  I'm afraid. 
*GIN:	Well, could do, what I can't forgive is that she was so spiteful to my daughter, she's a sun shiny little sole and she's so full of love for everybody she's so generous 
*DIN:	Why was she? 
*GIN:	she didn't want Vaughany to get married again. 
*DIN:	Oh. 
*GIN:	She used to say what Diane, I've never heard of a Diane, after they were married this 
*DIN:	 ((laugh)) . 
*GIN:	And when anyone treats my daughter like that I find it very hard to forgive, I know it hurts my kids, I'm much more up in arms than if they hurt me. Remember that first Christmas when she put the cat among the pigeons by saying to me your husband told me that he can't really afford he's flying because you spend all his money, when I, when I've been backing him, saving money for his aeroplane and his lessons and 
*DIN:	What did you say to dad? (.) did you say that to dad  didn't you say it   (  )  . 
*GIN:	 But I thought she was stirring it  you see and so did Diane. 
*DIN:	What did you tell  (  ) . 
*GIN:	I didn't believe her 
*DIN:	 You didn't, you never  . 
*GIN:	 But he said, I said it as a joke  when she was asking me about my flying and I said I don't do as much flying as I'd like to, I've, I've got a wife to support and she takes all the money. But I said I am the money   (.) I gave him his first flying lesson, I paid for it, like I bought his first three cars. 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	I excused myself and went to bed I think   (.) but she repeated it so solemnly you see not as, say somebody saying a joking sort of way. 
*DIN:	Yeah, good stirring  (  ) . 
*GIN:	And it was just after Frank had left her and gone to live in that place in  (  ) . 
*DIN:	Does, does anybody know what he's doing, (  ) . 
*GIN:	Don't know, last time I asked Diane she said oh he's, he's living with this machine he's got in 
*DIN:	What machine? 
*GIN:	some magic machine. 
*DIN:	What machine? Magic machine? 
*GIN:	Yes. 
*DIN:	What kind of machine? 
*GIN:	A machine he's designed, I don't know for what purpose, I didn't dare ask, I was going to ask Vaughan  . 
*DIN:	 It's not to, it's not  to isolate gamma rays  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Probably, but he was hiding he wouldn't come out because he said that the men from outer space were after him. 
*DIN:	It's funny you know, I've reading, I'm reading Silence of, Silence of the Lambs at the moment and er, you know, it's got in there, a lot of er, er, mentally ill patient's have got this idea that, men, men from Mars have  (  ) . 
*GIN:	Well I said to Diane you know, I didn't laugh, I didn't think it was funny, I thought it was sad and I said but he needs help, if Vaughan's you know, he's got two sons, but Mark's a bit hopeless and he was at Oxford anyway, I said surely somebody should go and get him some   (.) some treatment, sanitation. 
*DIN:	Yes. 
*GIN:	You can get cranks, you just believe in flying saucers and a quite happy harmless, but, I think they need checking on to make sure that they are   (.) happy with the life they're leading   (.) it bothers me a lot 
*DIN:	So where is he now? 
*GIN:	Well he's still in Manchester I think. 
*DIN:	Doing what? Is he living with, living in a  (  ) . 
*GIN:	I think he's in lodgings. 
*DIN:	Is he? 
*GIN:	But of course he got half the value of   (.) Trafford Hall, which was quarter of a million? 
*DIN:	Mm. 
*GIN:	Something like that, eighth of a million, it'll do me anyway. Oh listen to that bird, isn't it beautiful it's a Thrush. 
*DIN:	Well  (  ) . 
*GIN:	That's alright   (  ) degradable. Oh isn't it beautiful, he must think it's Spring. 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Oh it's gorgeous   (.) oh you beautiful bird. ((bird singing)). 
*DIN:	Oh, (  ) in't he? 
*GIN:	Like a spring sound. I hope they don't start nesting and then get all there  (  ) . 
*DIN:	 (  ) have a good time   (  ) wouldn't you?  Yes   
*GIN:	 Yes  , 
*DIN:	the  (  ) . 
*GIN:	this is, this is the end of November do not build your nest. 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Oh it's beautiful. 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Really doing his nut isn't he? Perhaps that is his er, this is, this is my place, (  ) . Yes, there he goes   (.) yes it was a Thrush   (.) You must come and try and hear the nightingale's again    (.)  (  ) again  (  ) , you haven't 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Oh, would you 
*DIN:	 (  ) . 
*GIN:	Would you try, you're supposed to try wish, wish for luck when you tread in it you know. 
*DIN:	Luck   (.) come on. 
*GIN:	Ooh, where did you go? oh don't look like that, no one 's gonna hurt you baby, might smack your bottom once or twice. Come 
*DIN:	Come on. 
*GIN:	Come 
*DIN:	In you get. 
*GIN:	Good boy, good lad  (5.0) , oh that Thrush song was a bonus wasn't it? Wasn't it gorgeous?
