*WEN:	Mm. •_•
        It depends, I mean  •_•
*MIC:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	if they go along  they might get better as you go they might get worse, who , who knows! •_•
        But er •_•
*BEV:	Oh isn't  good! •_•
*MIC:	Well  •_•
*WEN:	But  •_•
*MIC:	it hurt but it's gonna feel . •_•
        They'll be a result somewhere. •_•
*WEN:	Some of them, these are a bit hard in the middle you know. •_•
*MIC:	What? •_•
*BEV:	Spuds. •_•
*WEN:	Spuds. •_•
*BEV:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Mm, well I should of said, I mean like they used to. •_•
*MIC:	That's right. •_•
        I did a few of the last ones but . •_•
*WEN:	The thing is that when you erm  if you cut them down so much you are gonna have  total saute aren't you? •_•
*MIC:	Did you  pre-cook them? •_•
*WEN:	Yeah. •_•
*MIC:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	Yeah, I did. •_•
*MIC:	Mm. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*WEN:	But I mean, it just means cutting them smaller actually. •_•
*MIC:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	Don't you? •_•
        Oh I was sick of them  down there. •_•
        Blame it on . •_•
        Don't worry about the swimming cos we've been down there and she said yeah, I can't stir myself. •_•
*MIC:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	Lesley . •_•
*MIC:	Oh! •_•
*WEN:	Well Jenny's asked her you see. •_•
*MIC:	Mm. •_•
        Can't what? •_•
*WEN:	Stir herself. •_•
*MIC:	Oh! •_•
        I thought you said spare herself  I was gonna say  what has she gotta do,? •_•
*BEV:	He fell over then! •_•
*WEN:	Did he? •_•
        I didn't look. •_•
        She said she'd gone after that house  but she's not in the blasted catchment area though! •_•
*MIC:	Oh Christ! •_•
*WEN:	You know, like that great big effort we said about. •_•
*MIC:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	But  they can't sell them. •_•
*MIC:	That's right. •_•
*WEN:	But, so she might stand a chance. •_•
        Cos in the end I mean they've gotta sell them ain't they? •_•
*MIC:	They're growing up in the village. •_•
        And they've gone up from outside haven't they? •_•
*BEV:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	They reckon •_•
*MIC:	, sometimes the village  catchment is not •_•
*WEN:	What? •_•
*MIC:	Well  there could be no  in the village  in some instances. •_•
*WEN:	Yeah. •_•
        Well as she said, it's only minutes down the road  and they say  don't come into it. •_•

*WEN:	Potatoes. •_•
*BEV:	I'm afraid, some of them are alright but some of them are not. •_•
*WEN:	The what Mick,sorry? •_•
*MIC:	Well I say the er  it's a fair result  as far as catchment is concerned, it's one parish to the next. •_•
*WEN:	Mm. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*MIC:	That's what parishes are all about, that's all. •_•
*WEN:	They never bring in any in . •_•
