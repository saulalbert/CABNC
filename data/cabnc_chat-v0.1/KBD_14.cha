*TER:	No. •453882_454022•
        Well, a bit I intend carrying on as the  parliamentary candidate  and somebody had obviously asked Dave  why it is something has nothing whatsoever to do with the constituency. •454232_463302•
        That was last time's agent. •464002_465312•

        Well he's under a lot  or else he won't. •468782_471702•
        Still  he won't come if he thinks there's any  messing about. •471702_474882•
        I mean,it would be  zilch for the Labour Party to try and swap candidates now. •475212_481272•

        They've got to hope that it'll be resolved before then. •514582_517722•

        So I've said they can get stood on. •122762_123034•
        And I booked at the Claremont  which is, twenty eight pounds. •123034_123363•
        Well, I'm not being prepared to be held to ransom by them. •123375_123882•
        And I'm, I'm faxing  erm  I'm sorry, I'm not gonna fax it, I'm just going to send a letter to national office  about The Savoy in First Leisure. •123882_124742•

        So  erm  I'm sending one back to national office saying, these hotels are sending confirmation at the full price for local government conference. •128913_129739•
        Now  I, I've rung the Claremont and they've said, oh yes, it's the conference erm  you know  amount  and we're very,we were, I was very lucky cos we got the last three rooms. •129762_131001•
        And she said, we're absolutely booked up! •131037_131306•
        But, you see Bob told me about it, he said, well he, you know  booked at the Claremont because he'd had problems getting prices out of the others. •131306_132027•
        But, our union always stay at the Claremont and we've always found it, you know, okay. •132027_132473•
        But I'm, I'm not paying sixty five quid a night! •132473_132827•
        It's just stupid Francis! •132827_133008•

        A is central heating, C is car parking, D is  street car parking, E is special diets catered for, F, tea and coffee making facility, G is television in bedrooms at no extra charge  I is for  answering and J    K, I've, I'm, just to go all through this, disabled facilities, L  separate   M  bedrooms available with private telephones in, it's N, number of bedrooms available with  private bathroom and toilet or shower and toilet. •135847_138727•
        And that's what it says. •138736_138899•
        It was, was when I went Francis. •138907_139119•
        Night porter, Q is lifts to all floor, and S is swimming pool  and I know there's a swimming pool because  not that I ever used it, but  it, it was when I booked Francis. •139123_140224•
        It's right on the prom on the corner on, on North Prom. •140291_140723•
        It's not far from the Imperial Francis. •140733_140981•
        So  but it was erm  just go on that bit of the prom, it's huge! •141206_141723•
        It's a huge hotel on the corner. •141723_141899•
        You can't miss it. •141903_142053•
        I'll, I'll give you the the address anyway. •142078_142177•
        Erm, two hundred and seventy North Prom. •142196_142523•
        Yeah. •142530_142562•
        Two seventy North Prom. •142825_142932•
        Erm, and you just say what  yeah, two seventy North Prom. •142958_143571•
        It's, it's just past, if you keep going past the Pembroke  it's there. •143614_144112•
        But erm  that's right, going out. •144120_144573•
        Yes. •144573_144603•
        It's just past there. •144615_144716•
        You can't lose it Francis, cos it's one of the major hotels. •144725_145029•
        Yeah. •145029_145113•
        They've got, they've got lots of bars, there's a bar in the basement and there's bars upstairs, and a dance floor and a swimming pool and  I'm sure it will Francis. •145186_146223•
        I mean  yeah, well I don't blame him. •146237_147105•
        But it says  number of bedrooms available with private bathroom and toilet, or shower and toilet. •147105_147607•
        There are very few hotels of this standard that don't have showers and toilets. •147614_148063•
        So  it's twenty eight Francis, which is, I think is  yes. •148070_148678•
        Yes. •148758_148783•
        Well, it doesn't matter where we go to eat does it? •148849_149083•
        And we, can go and eat wherever we want. •149083_149324•
        Oh! •149734_149757•
        But  you can have bed and breakfast and evening meal if you want. •149757_150124•
        Erm, but generally,I mean cos Eileen and I go to a   we nearly always go somewhere like Carriages or  you know, somewhere Italian  which is, you know, it might, it all depends on what Jim's eating at the time. •150133_151525•
        But, but  you can't go wrong, there's plenty to eat in Blackpool can you? •151625_152250•
        In fact, I'm trying to think of a place that erm  we once went when we  at regional conference, it was behind the Claremont somewhere. •152250_152868•
        It was a  it was a  little Italian restaurant with about forty six  and we went at regional conference and it was astounding! •152868_153711•
        It was a really brilliant chef! •153736_153916•
        I'll try and get Bob to find the  the number of it. •153916_154258•
        Cos that was really  a really nice place. •154258_154538•
        But, you wouldn't have expected to find it where you found it. •154594_154974•
        No. •154974_154991•
        You know the road behind the promenade? •155058_155236•
        It was on that road. •155236_155405•
        And we only found it by chance, you know how you go off to  think oh I'll, I'll go and find a coffee or something, and we found this restaurant at lunch time and had a coffee there  and we looked at the menu and, you know, we, we couldn't believe it! •155405_156624•
        Yeah. •156635_156643•
        Well I'll try, I'll try and get Bob to remember the name of it. •156643_156952•
        Alright. •156952_156968•
        And so I'll see you when we get there Francis. •157056_157251•

        Well we'll spend it on food and drink Francis. •183170_183495•
        But erm  er, I feel a lot more comfortable cos I think sixty five pounds a night's outrageous! •183500_184207•
        For just spending  well, for us, when we're just, you're only there for  your breakfast aren't you? •184217_184885•
        You never go back again. •184885_184975•
        So  because we'll be able to have lunch at British Home Stores. •185126_185465•
        We'll not be able to break with tradition . •185486_185907•
        Geoff will insist that we go to British Home Stores for, well we'll, if, if we we're with Geoff and Louise, that's where we generally go to lunch, and  it's really nice! •185907_186829•
        It's a lovely  self-service  in Blackpool . •186829_187058•
        But    you know the Labour Party is worse than the Conservatives for traditions aren't they? •187058_187641•
        Mm. •187642_187643•
        Anyway, look  I'll find out from Bob about this restaurant and  see if there's a possibility that it might be worth booking before I go. •187643_188442•
        But I know that Jim's going to have to . •188442_188649•
