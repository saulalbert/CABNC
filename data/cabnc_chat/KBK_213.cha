*CHR:	By Gosh!Hot stuff.
*NOR:	Presumably they're awfully  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yes.Hubbling bubbling oil.
*NOR:	Whenever we come here we see somebody we know don't we?

*CHR:	Who did we see the last time we were here?

*NOR:	Aha.I bet Lynda's in for a lark for the next year.She's   (        ) round the corner when Raymond  (        ) .And then she'll come home some days and discover the place chockablock with students or three birds in bed with him or something.
*NOR:	That's unlikely.I agree they are   (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	Sorry?
