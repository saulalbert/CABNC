*NON:	What are you doing for your holidays this year, any  (        ) ?
*FRE:	I don't really yet.I was thinking of going.
*NON:	Hm.
*FRE:	I was thinking of going to Austria about the end of September October but, if Alexander's not going abroad I don't know, I shall have to   (.) change me mind probably, I'll have to have a word with Sue.
*NON:	 (        ) what's Sue doing with her holidays this year?
*FRE:	There not.
*NON:	Aren't they? ((laugh)) .
*FRE:	Well I think there in, well they can't go together, told you the last time you was here, they can't go on holiday together.
*NON:	Oh somebody got to business oh.
*FRE:	They can't leave the business .
*NON:	They had more staff last year they could leave in.
*FRE:	 ((cough)) pardon.
*NON:	They had staff they could leave in charge last year.
*FRE:	Haven't they got anybody now?
*NON:	Well they've only got one, one girl who sort of does clerical and stuff and reception, they haven't got a anybody who knows how to   (        ) .
*FRE:	 (        ) of there's.
*NON:	Yeah, yeah, they haven't got anybody who knows anything about the business, well not enough about it.
*FRE:	 (        ) really expensive are now, aren't they?
*NON:	Yeah  (.) 
*FRE:	I suppose   (        ) got a car.
*NON:	You know, moaning about these blokes like the postman going on strike over a seven per cent rise.
*FRE:	Oh I.
*NON:	I mean, they shouldn't want more than seven per cent because the cost of living, you know, the inflation's gone down, but then when a bloke gets forty five thousand quid, you know eh, on a firm where they've a, they've made a profit, but he got an increase of forty five thousand pound which was of, no, no about forty per cent rather, forty per cent increase in his salary, I mean it's bloody, I mean, how can, how can they expect, you know, the ordinary working man to put up with bloody awful increase, if, if they go and give bosses increases like that, I mean it doesn't make sense.
*FRE:	Yes, but it's only, it's only people that are in these higher executive jobs that get these bloody monies.
*NON:	Yeah, but then they shouldn't get it, they shouldn't do it.
*FRE:	I know.
*NON:	I mean as I say now, how can you turn round to a   (.) to a bloke who's, well doesn't matter what his on, eh, what, what ever his, his rate of pay is, how can you turn round to him and say you can't have more than seven per cent, and his got, his got something like a about twenty five, thirty per cent .
*FRE:	I think, I think your find that a lot of these big, big money people get paid according to results, and if they get good results they get good money.
*NON:	Yeah, but I don't think this bloke could have particularly good I don't think this bloke had particularly good results.
*FRE:	And if the results   (        ) results fall then they loose it .Hm.
*NON:	He hadn't had good results.
*FRE:	Well as that, from my experience, they only pay ya for what your worth, not what  ((laugh)) , don't pay ya because your good looking or anything like that  (.) 
*NON:	If a firm's not doing well they can't pay ya, can it?
*FRE:	Well  (        ) .
*NON:	That's, our, our Nick's people would, wouldn't it, and that was it.
*FRE:	Hm.
*NON:	They lost all the bloody trade.
*FRE:	Hm.
*NON:	I, even Nick, Nick said two years ago things started going down hill   (.) The best paid jobs these days, say what you like, (        ) don't like, is either in local government or something like that.There over paid vastly, local government.
*FRE:	Hm.Well I don't really know how much they get.
*NON:	Pardon.
*FRE:	I don't really know how much money they get.
*NON:	Well you've only got to look at adverts in the ruddy paper for
*FRE:	I mean   (        ) I no, I'm, I'm thinking more on the ordinary clerical and that executive stuff, not the   (        ) jobs .
*NON:	Oh well, I was flicking the .
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*NON:	 (        ) .
*FRE:	I mean I don't think there particularly well paid, but they, there well paid for what they flipping well do cos they don't, they, they, they'll do it, but I mean eh, that's the fault of the bosses, they should cut down there staff.You can't blame, you can't blame people for hanging about doing nothing if they've twice as many staff as they should've, and there paying them, I mean, that, that's an administrative error, not a   (.) well it seems to be very rift in local government that there over staffed 
*NON:	I, I think all these, all these people in local government and things, and eh, it was obvious when, you see adverts for jobs, what a bloody salaries there paying them, for a mediocre job.
*FRE:	Well I never look at the adverts do I?I'm not in  ((laugh)) .
*NON:	No, I don't suppose you do now, but, but I have would off worked for local authorities, because at one time they were very poorly paid.But it's all changed now, there the best paid people in the ruddy country.
*FRE:	Hm  (.) 
*NON:	There'll have to have a ruddy cut down  (        ) , over this staff over this community charge, there've been trouble here next.
*FRE:	Hm.
*NON:	Think about the money, about a quarter of the staff that they did have.Hm, there see, they are over staffed, there's no doubt about it, aren't they?
*FRE:	 (        ) .But I mean I say, that's not the fault of the people who work there, there not going to put themselves out of work.They should never have been taken on in the first place, any bet, that our, our problem should never have been taken on in the first place .
*FRE:	Well that's it , this is it, they, they take on staff to increase there own importance.
