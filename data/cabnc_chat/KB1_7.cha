*KAR:	 Well, well Richard won't. 
*ALB:	I know. 
*JUN:	Er. 
*ALB:	She's is his cousin. 
*KAR:	Is that   (.) maybe the other side, but I don't   (  ) be Wendy's side. 
*ALB:	She's his cousin. 'Cos I says to her one day, well why don't you ask yer, your relation, if he'll er, if he'll give yer a job. Give us a job, she said, he won't even pass the time of day with us. 
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*ALB:	I said, well, I, there must be summat there, out there, she said no, he said, she said it goes back a long time. But er, she says, never even   (.) speaks to us. And if we if if we ring up, he puts he just puts the phone straight down, soon as you tell him who it is. 
*JUN:	Probably goes back from when they went  (  )  
*ALB:	He said, I, she said I can live without him anyhow. 
*JUN:	It'll drop off, that. 
*SAS:	It won't. 
*JUN:	It will. Come on, (  ) yella. 
*SAS:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALB:	I found some Mighty Muscle in garage, you know. 
*JUN:	How much. 
*ALB:	You know that big round tin. 
*JUN:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	I, not how much is in it, but it'll probably be about that much in bottom. 
*JUN:	I know   (  ) wanting   (  ) to do this room, really, 'cos it would be too cold. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	Get away with one. 
*JUN:	I wish we'd just   (  ) too cold. 
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*ALB:	You won't, as far as   (  ) we're having to buy coal at that price. 
*JUN:	No, I know. Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal. 
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*JUN:	 (  ) how much. 
*ALB:	You know that big round tin? 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	I don't know how much is in it, but probably be about that much in bottom. 
*JUN:	 (  ) might be   (  ) really, couldn't   (  ) too cold. 
*ALB:	Get away with one. 
*JUN:	I wish we'd afford some   (  ) I mean, it's cold. 
*ALB:	You won't   (  ) while we're having the buy coal, at that price. 
*JUN:	No, I know. Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal. 
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*JUN:	We'll probably just buy some, and that lad'll ring up. 
*ALB:	He probably will. Especially if this mild weather stops. But it is mild today, ain't it. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*SAS:	 (  )  ((singing)) 
*JUN:	That's not a moo cow. 
*ALB:	Get down. 
*SAS:	It is. It is. 
*ALB:	It isn't. 
*SAS:	Mooo. 
*JUN:	That's it. That's what moo cows  do. 
*ALB:	 You're  crackers. 
*SAS:	It is. It is a moo cow. 
*KAR:	I mean like er, Eileen was saying summat yesterday, she said, she said I don't er, have   (  ) at home, she said, I decided to   (  ) I said I'm frightened, and sometimes   (  ) knows I'm not frightened. I said, I'm frightened someone's in the 'ouse, I'm frightened not waking everybody   (  ) well, well what do you do, I says, you don't, unless you have a go, you don't, I mean, if I'd turned out   (  ) you know, you don't really know. 
*JUN:	I know. 
*KAR:	I mean, that 
*ALB:	You might, and then again, you might be a millionaire inside three months. 
*KAR:	Yes, I said to her, think about it, I I was that frightened, I frightened meself to death, and I I wouldn't I wouldn't. I hated it. 
*JUN:	That's what I used to do every time I thought about selling 'ouse  (  )  
*KAR:	You just got to do it. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	I thought about it, and thought about it, and then then changed my mind. But this time I decided it's what I want to do and bugger it. If we don't sell it, we we haven't lost anything. 
*ALB:	Oh well. 
*JUN:	 (  ) sell it till we move. 
*KAR:	I honestly think  myself   (.)   
*JUN:	 As long as we're not worse off than what we were before we moved. 
*KAR:	I honestly think meself, that I might have a have a couple of hard months, maybe three, first three months might be a bit difficult for  me. 
*ALB:	 Oh, it probably will be. 
*KAR:	Well, I think, once he gets established, and once he starts getting work in, I think meself, that work will start, won't say rolling in, but I think the work'll start coming in after about three months and I can get established. 
*ALB:	Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten pences. 
*KAR:	I know. 
*ALB:	I know we're hard up, but you can  ten pence. 
*KAR:	 You never know, might be   (  ) to make enough money to take you out somewhere for a decent Christmas do. 
*ALB:	Oh    (  )   
*JUN:	 Yeah, Christmas party. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Yeah, might. 
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*ALB:	You might. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	 (  ) want to come work for him, did I tell ya. 
*ALB:	Who? 
*KAR:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Him that used to work with our Colin. 
*KAR:	Yeah. You know, er, well, 
*ALB:	Aye, the  (.)  
*KAR:	It, he would    (  )   
*JUN:	 It's gotta  be better than being on dole, innit. 
*KAR:	No, I don't know. 
*JUN:	Oh, is that  (  )  
*KAR:	No he's, no he's got a good job. He works at   (  ) with plenty of overtime. 
*UNK:	Benjy. 
*KAR:	Colin phoned him up, and er, it it   (  ) he mentioned, how he was starting up, and he said he might be interested, anyway Colin phoned him a couple of weeks ago to see if he was still interested in. Anyway he says he'd pay him the same money as what he's on there, 'cos he'd have to really, wouldn't just say, say  (  )  
*ALB:	You've, you've got to, but how the hell get it, if he don't get paid up front. 
*KAR:	What do ya mean? 
*ALB:	 Well, wages, 
*JUN:	 Got to   (  )   
*KAR:	Well, it have to come out of capital, at first. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	 (  ) put by ten or eleven thousand, or whatever it is, just come out of that. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	So we got money coming in. 
*ALB:	Mm. 
*JUN:	 (  ) our Karen. 
*KAR:	But er, I mean, I says, can't we manage without him, can't you manage by yourself, but Colin says he can't really, because 
*ALB:	He needs somebody. 
*KAR:	Yeah. Well, Colin's gotta be able to do a lot of office work, he's gonna be out doing quotes, you know what I mean, so he's going have to have somebody there. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Or I would apply for er, family credit straight away.  (  ) get coming in, I'm gonna say, yeah, we've got ten thousand pounds. But we don't know how long it'll be, before get any money coming in, and if you go on to family credit, you get it for six months, so that'll be our wages. So then, what what comes out of business we'll pay him anyway. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	You might have too much in bank for family credit, that ten thousand, it's only eight, innit? 
*JUN:	It's got, it's gotta know what   (  ) increase, when you running a business. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Oh, I don't know. 
*KAR:	If you apply for it straight away, could you say you don't know how much monies coming in. How much money your gonna coming in. 
*JUN:	His dad's in a new business, anyway,bec  so you should get forty quid a week at least, anyway. 
*KAR:	Thirty-five now, (  )  
*JUN:	Is it thirty-five, 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Bloody hell. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	It's like everything else 
*JUN:	I mean, that's seventy pound, you wouldn't have had, anyway, ain't it. 
*KAR:	No. 
*ALB:	Oh. 
*KAR:	I ju  I mean, it, now it's just getting me, more depressed than nowt else, I mean, I just wish that they'd phone and say yeah, we've got you a  insured. 
*JUN:	  (  )  
*KAR:	And then, I mean, 'cos we daren't say that to accountant know, to have 'ouse valued, 'cos what's point in, I mean, anybody said to us, er, get it sent off, you'll find, you're, somebody will insure ya. But what if they don't. 
*JUN:	You've lost all your    (  ) ain't ya. 
*KAR:	 Ya, so that's   (  )  the end of the world. Even if you find out they won't. 
*ALB:	No. Why don't you get a free   (.) put on market. 
*JUN:	No, the on  the company's, that's coming up with all the money got to  (.)  
*ALB:	Oh aye. 
*JUN:	do the valuation. And they ought to form   (  ) value of what, so they know how much it's worth, what the company that's gonna earn them the money want the money for the valuation. 
*KAR:	It's just another way of making a bit more money out it. 
*JUN:	That's it. 
*ALB:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Well, it's same as when you buying and selling 'ouses. You   (  ) when it comes out, when, the people that's, mind me cigarette, darling, the people that's gonna buy your 'ouse, who, mortgage company comes out and values it, they've got that to pay as well haven't they. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	The same as, I, them that buys our 'ouse, they'll have to pay whatever it cost for 'em to value our 'ouse, see if it's worth lending money, we'll have the same thing with er bungalow, down there. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	It's only money   (  ) I mean, how long are they 'ere. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Ten minutes. 
*ALB:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Mean, that woman come out, when when we had this done, didn't she, 
*ALB:	Mm. 
*JUN:	To to see if it were satisfac  she weren't here three minutes. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	No. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	What was that for, for  (  )  
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	You know when we had extension put up. 
*KAR:	Oh yeah, yeah, 
*JUN:	Well, 
*KAR:	Did it   (  ) value. 
*JUN:	They sent they sent 'em out from er, Abbey National and we had to pay, well we did pay 'im fifty pound, people that put the building on paid. 
*SAS:	 (  ) she keeps getting up. 
*JUN:	She's not. 
*SAS:	She is. 
*JUN:	She'll bite you, and our Whisky can  (  )  
*KAR:	She scratched him outside, didn't she. 
*JUN:	And, if she were here three and a half minutes, that's all she were 'ere, and it and it 'em fifty quid. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Bloody ridiculous. 
*JUN:	It's all a bloody money making racket. 
*KAR:	Another thing is, I'll tell why we don't want er, they always having valuations, they are, they come and value it, and then they give us money. That means we're gonna be paying extra eleven thousand with money we ain't got. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	That's another reason we're daren't send it off. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	Yeah, because if ya, if ya, get it before ya start your business. You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it. 
*KAR:	Yeah. Trust them, because it's in their   (  ) at the moment. Well, I still believe in   (  ) and I don't pushed around and say, no you can't have money, no you can't get insured, and so that means    (  ) others. 
*JUN:	 You haven't lost anything  have ya? 
*KAR:	Well, just er disappointment, I suppose. For what 
*JUN:	Well, yeah, 
*KAR:	Then again, I mean, I    (  )   
*ALB:	 There's always  summat else you can go and do. 
*KAR:	You know that, doing that, fabricating, and things like that, you know like actual welding and that type of   (  ) Er, we wouldn't make as much money out of that as you probably would 
*JUN:	No. 
*ALB:	No, you'll be, you'll be stuck to it, all time, and it's not good for 'im. 
*KAR:	No. 
*ALB:	And it kills your eyes welding. 
*JUN:	Benjy. 
*ALB:	But as he said to me, why don't you go   (  ) welding. I says, the point is I've got bad eyes as it is, 
*KAR:	 Yeah. 
*ALB:	 what's  the point in making them worse. 
*KAR:	I know. 
*ALB:	So, jump in me box, and I ain't jumping in me box blind, for the last ten years. I'll manage the way I am. (  )  
*KAR:	You see, that works where I 
*JUN:	Benjy 
*ALB:	Aye, 
*JUN:	Benjy, look at 'im. Benjy 
*ALB:	 (  )  (  ) 
*KAR:	Where are you, when it's gonna be, he said corner, then we'll make an office and a little canteen in that anyway. Then there's another long unit right at side of it, just enough to get one trailer in. I said, I said, if we do get going, and we do start finding out that it's going alright, he'll turn that, into like er, shop er, blasting shop. And like, 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	A spray area, then 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Employ a sprayer. So, I mean, we know what we want, but   (.) it's them and not us, I mean, it is frightening to start a business up, 'cos we don't know how much work we'll be getting, but, I mean, 
*JUN:	Well, it's same for anybody starting any business, ain't it, you don't know if it's gonna work    (  ) as well. 
*ALB:	 It might go well  for the first three or four months, and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a  few months  , 
*KAR:	 Yeah. 
*ALB:	you could be struggling to keep it above  (.)  
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	and especially, you know, these bloody big firms, they do not like paying bloody bills. 
*KAR:	No. 
*ALB:	I mean, you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business will still go under. 
*KAR:	Yeah, because of it. 
*ALB:	Because of it. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	They don't look on them things, how much you've got owed out to ya. I know. 
*JUN:	 When you look you see everything's a bloody risk, 
*ALB:	 Let's hope he gets off the floor. 
*JUN:	walking across roads a risk, ain't it. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	It's ju  just if you've got the nerve to do it. 
*ALB:	It's a risk with these buggers, what's in power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power. 
*SAS:	I got  (  )  
*ALB:	I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it tough at all. 
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	I can tell you that, now. 
*JUN:	Oohh. 
*SAS:	What? 
*JUN:	Oohh. 
*KAR:	You feel like   (  ) er, that's whose, like ex soldiers   (  ) throughout the company, and he said to Colin er, he said, how many people are you thinking about employ  , our Colin seems to think there'd be enough work to keep 'im going, like, he says, he says, well how many people are you thinking about employing, he says, only only me and me   (  ) like, it's oh, oh, he says, there's plenty of work to keep two of going, he said, I thought you employed about six. So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him, and he's got enough work for six, then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two of 'em. 
*ALB:	Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets the jobs done quicker  (  )  
*KAR:	Yeah, but then you still got six wages to pay out, haven't ya. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	That's it. He probably will have six later on, if he gets it off, but   (.) the thing is, I mean, he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half the time,y  you know, he'll be sat doing nothing, scratching his nose. Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the people that want a job, but don't wanna work for it. There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stainford, 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	round about here. 
*KAR:	Mind Lee's a, Lee's a good worker, he says that, he wants, you know, best worker what he can  (  )  
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	Yeah, but I mean, working for a mate, is different to working for a firm. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	You know, I mean 
*KAR:	Well, he's not a mate, he won't, he's working with him when he were at er   (  ) over in Brad  oh, here's Richard now. ((laugh))  
*ALB:	Aye, you'd better jump in bed with him, (  )  
*KAR:	 ((laugh))  (  )  ((laugh)) Oh dear, no but he is, Richard is the one with the   (  ) comical magazine, (  ) laughing bursts two incomes. I think that's part of  (  )  
*ALB:	Yes. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	Look, slow down, or you're driving me mad. 
*SAS:	Oh yuk. 
*KAR:	 (  ) weekend, aren't we? (  )  
*ALB:	Get settled. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Pity she can't go as well, you could have had a quiet weekend. 
*ALB:	Where's Gavin like, is he with Colin? 
*KAR:	No, in the barn, 'cos they went yesterday morning, and er, they end up sleeping last night, (  ) due back today  (  )  
*SAS:	I was   (  ) I was  (  )  
*ALB:	Don't make sense. 
*SAS:	Mmoo 
*KAR:	If I don't 'ave 'im, I'll be having 'im for a, you know, two days at a time. 
*SAS:	Mmoo. 
*JUN:	Well, if you 'ave 'im two days at a time, it's better than nowt at all innit. How's that came and stop 'ere. 
*KAR:	How long she's got to go for other one. 
*JUN:	Twelve, (  ) , he's got her ten days. 
*ALB:	Ten days. 
*KAR:	Yeah, (  ) could it   
*JUN:	  (  )  
*ALB:	 Could be ten, between ten and twelve days, couldn't it. 
*JUN:	 George, your birthday's not twenty-first ain't it, 
*KAR:	No. 
*JUN:	I thought it were twenty sixth. 
*KAR:	That's true. 
*ALB:	Well, you'll have to wait while  (  )  
*KAR:	A week before  (  )  
*JUN:	Oh, I said George, (  ) bed with ya, I said, that's worse   (  )   
*KAR:	 Oh Benjy lie down, what matter with ya. 
*JUN:	He's worse than your father  ain't he. 
*KAR:	  (  )  lie down now. Look. 
*JUN:	He's coming in. 
*KAR:	Lie down. 
*JUN:	Snuggled up on that blanket, little un. (  )  ((laugh))  
*SAS:	Lie down  (  ) . 
*KAR:	You'd do it for for Bert. 
*JUN:	He's he's like that with  everybody. 
*ALB:	 He's like with  everybody, ah, give us a cuddle. 
*JUN:	Yeah, but he won't keep bloody still. 
*KAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALB:	If you're cuddling me, you won't move  (  )  
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	What were you saying about er, (  )  
*JUN:	 (  ) two hours old. 
*KAR:	 ((laugh))  (  ) look in me dad's then. ((laugh))

*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	exactly older than me. First and twenty-first. 
*JUN:	You want to do what she's doing now. 
*SAS:	 (  )

*KAR:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	Oh. I thought it was that   (  ) wife. (  )

*ALB:	I can't understand   (  ) your cross. 
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*KAR:	I know. 
*ALB:	Cannot understand   (  ) or something.  Their as different as chalk and bloody cheese. 
*JUN:	 Plenty of different people   (  )  cheap, er, (  ) the other people who have different likes to you, but what, what you might think's attrac  attractive, somebody else'll 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	won't be, you know. 
*ALB:	 ((cough))  (  ) 
*KAR:	To be quite honest, without talking like a school   (  ) on a fence. They're not very happy, they ain't been happy for a while, but it's getting worse,wh  is, what is them now is, you know I say things to Colin, and Co  I mean, Colin'll tell me like, you know, you know, (  ) over there, and er, he's latest thing is, they built this little office. You know when you go into   (  ) on the right, er a coal-house and a wash- house ain't there. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	The coal-house part it's is quite wide now we've done it, big coal-house, but altered  (  )  
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	And then it twists, and like a small office, and when when I were there, after Michael had shown it me and Colin, he says oh, he says, er I'm come in here to get get out of way, and you know, he was like telling me, I thought I don't want to be a fiddle, because it's alright telling Colin, the boys 
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	telling yeah, 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	ain't it, yeah, it's not like a woman telling you problems. 
*JUN:	Don't knock my dusters off. 
*KAR:	Anyway, I just said, well, summat about   (.) about what I said, I says, yeah, (  ) nice to get away from it all, ain't it, to be by yourself, and that's all I said, and I think he knew that I I didn't want to  (  )  
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	but, and he said to Colin 
*ALB:	 ((cough)) oh shit. 
*KAR:	 (  ) said, he said, yeah, he said, it'll be ideal in here, he said, I can put, he said, put a full lock on door, and he said, I can come in here, he said, (  ) and so I thought, ah. 
*JUN:	Yeah but, there's not many people that you can  (  )  
*KAR:	Sasha, behave. 
*JUN:	I don't think I know anybody that hundred per cent 'appy. Well, I think it's got a lot to do with the climate we're living in, you know, 
*KAR:	Rushing about 
*JUN:	There's that much, there's that many people out of work, there's and  ((bird chirping)) 
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*JUN:	you know, there's that many pressures on people. 
*KAR:	I mean, it's like like Colin and I, I mean, like we're happy but then, no were not hundred per cent happy at all, (  ) But like, er, like some people I can't   (  ) if you get upset, some people eat more, some people eat less, or you know, some go into recluse, some get   (  ) and like Colin, 
*JUN:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	he's when he's depressed, he's goes like a raving sex mania, he 
*JUN:	I'm bloody glad Albert don't, he'll drive me   (  ) out of a bed. 
*KAR:	He takes all, takes all his   (  )  ((laugh))  
*SAS:	 ((singing)) 
*JUN:	Why didn't you stop  (  )  
*KAR:	No I think every   (  )  
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	I think everybody's got themselves summat some faults. 
*JUN:	Nobody's hundred per cent perfect. 
*KAR:	I mean, I don't think Colin's unhappy where he wants to do, then an offers an offer, like either they go in and make   (  ) share, but if they work all day. 
*ALB:	No, it's not er, it's so much   (.) I mean, he's at work all day, (  ) and he works all bloody hours that God sent, when they want, when they got down, 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	and what happens. He's got to build an office where he can go and let, sit in it, can't abide   (  )   
*KAR:	 That's right. 
*ALB:	Summat wrong somewhere. 
*JUN:	Now look at our Margaret and Peter. They've got no family, so they've got no pressures like that, they haven't got any money problems   (.) well they're not 'appy. They live two entirely  separate lives. 
*KAR:	 Yeah, I know.  There's is just a marriage of er  convenience. 
*JUN:	 Convenience. 
*KAR:	Innit it. 
*ALB:	Yeah, it's convenient  (  )  
*JUN:	It's a way of life, they've lived together that long, like, they don't want to  (  )  
*JUN:	If when you and Pete had that trouble, if our Margaret had er been working, I honestly think she would have left Pete. 
*KAR:	I know. 
*JUN:	But the only thing that our Margaret could come up with, was why should I, why should I leave me home and sell up, she said, when all my life, he's had money from the house. He'll have the money from the house, plus a wage every week. She said, and what will I have, she said, just the money from the house. She said, and where do I live. You know, he can move back home with his mum, she said, I suppose I can go back home to me mum, well then I've got to look for a job, you know. 
*KAR:	Mm. 
*JUN:	And I honestly think that was the only reason that she stopped for Pete. 
*KAR:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Yes. Because, she's she, he he were gonna get a wage every week. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	You know, and she worked all them years, and then when she weren't working, she have no money coming in every week. 
*ALB:	Yeah, but she's got all the shares. 
*JUN:	She hasn't, she got rid of them all. 
*ALB:	Aye, not with Bl  not with  (  )  
*JUN:	Yeah, but you could see, you could see, that, I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty pound a week. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	We'll he had his money he won't have to touch, he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week. 
*ALB:	Oh, aye, 
*JUN:	And he could start again. Find another woman and buy another house and start again. 
*KAR:	Mm. I mean like Jeremy and Kay, I mean, they're not happy. They pretend they are, but I mean like, he's  he's   
*JUN:	 They've  got to do, aren't they, I mean, after all bloody   (  ) harm they caused. 
*KAR:	 Yeah, you know, you know how flaming miserable and mardy he is. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	He's another one. But you see when he living with Ange, maybe he were younger then, but I mean like, when he were living with Ange, he had all the women as you know, plus he had Kay, plus he had, you know, Ange, he had everything, there was Kay, (  ) as well, weren't he, now he can't. 
*JUN:	No. 
*KAR:	But then again, if, even Kay over there with   (  ) she said something about er, oh we've been out, but, I told you I went to a   (  ) last Monday. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	 (  ) and she said something about, oh we've been to that new pub, she said, mind, she said, we had to come home at half past nine, she said, he'd had enough, she said, he were ready for bed, God, she said he's turning into a right old man, and you know what I mean, she didn't, she wouldn't, 
*ALB:	Exactly. 
*KAR:	She didn't realise what she was saying as such, but I thought, and I thought, yeah I know. 
*ALB:	 Yeah, well he is, what ten years. 
*KAR:	Thirteen you got from 'er. 
*ALB:	Thirteen years difference. 
*KAR:	She's, how old am I, twenty-two, so she's twenty-nine. Same age as our Kim 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Oh she'll be coming at thirty this year, won't she? 
*ALB:	You see, she's just coming into her prime, and now he's he's just  leaving it. 
*KAR:	  (  ) yeah. 
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*KAR:	He's really forty-three this year. 
*ALB:	Don't work. 
*KAR:	He'll be forty-three this year, and she'll be thirty this year. ((bird chirping)) 
*ALB:	The only thing, time that happens is, that is you hear about, 
*SAS:	 Look George   (  )   
*ALB:	if yo  if one's fifty over sixty, 
*JUN:	He's plucking his feathers out. 
*ALB:	then it works. But when your younger it, or even when you're young, you know, it does. But when you get into your forties  (.)  
*KAR:	Well, it's like, I mean like, 
*ALB:	 (.) It works. 
*KAR:	I'm   (  ) me and Colin are settling down a lot compared to what we were five year ago. I mean, like, like now, we were a, say even two and three years ago and   (  ) somebody'd said to me, are you going to Spain, and I would have said, yeah, we'll go to Majorca, lovely, we could stop out all night, do what you want. Now only three or four years later I'd say of yeah we're go to somewhere a bit quieter, so that kids can go to bed of a night time, we could have a    (  ) apartment. 
*ALB:	 Yeah, that's right, yeah. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	And that, I'm changing that way, but, if our kids have to be home with the, a group, when I went to see Squeeze. And it were a good group, I wanted to go see. Our think nowt about going and watching 'em. Johnny won't go anywhere like that. Kay's wanted to do what we do, and Johnny's not interested. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Like went to fair, she went to the riding, he  (  ) . He said, that's   (  ) ya like a big kid, going up fair. I mean, look at    (  )   
*JUN:	 I mean, that's all she is, yet, she's she's only a bloody   (.)   
*KAR:	Yeah, twenty nine. 
*ALB:	 (  ) Well, I like to go on rides.  I go on rides, June won't   (  ) go on. 
*KAR:	 I know. Yeah, well, that's what I mean, (  )   
*JUN:	Go on, shit. 
*KAR:	The thing is, like he is even apart apart from 'im being a lot older than 'er, he acts older. I mean, he acts like his always, er forty three, he acts like he's like, fifty sometime, well you you're older than, you know what I mean, he acts older than you, because as you say, you'll go on fair rides and   (.)   
*ALB:	  (  )  
*KAR:	Aye. 
*JUN:	Mind you, we're we're getting  on   (.)   
*KAR:	 No, but you know what I mean, I mean, (  )  
*ALB:	Yeah, I know what you mean. 
*KAR:	Fifty, 
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	Fifty-three. 
*JUN:	Four. 
*KAR:	Fifty-three, 
*JUN:	Fifty-four. 
*ALB:	 ((shouting)) I'm fifty-three  
*JUN:	 ((shouting)) Your fifty-four next birthday  you're only a couple of months off. 
*ALB:	Well, I'm fifty-three. 
*SAS:	He's  fifty-three. 
*KAR:	 'Cos you probably  do more things. You know younger things, than what he does. And he gotta  (  )  
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	He should be keeping himself young for 'er. 
*JUN:	Mm. 
*ALB:	Instead of 'er keeping him young, she's, he's making her old. 
*KAR:	That's it, yeah. 
*JUN:	 I think  Chris   on about moving to blinking Gainsborough, now. 
*KAR:	Gainsborough. 
*JUN:	Colin were telling me today. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	He said they've had twelve 'ouses them, since they've been married. 
*KAR:	God. 
*JUN:	I were talking to him on Friday, and er, I mean, they've not been down there five minutes. 
*KAR:	Oh no, Road. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Mind, I never been there 'fore, oh I can't remember, a few years, can't re  , last time I've been there. 
*JUN:	Mm. Well la  , last year, when you were doing that painting for er, Derek. 
*SAS:	Mum. 
*KAR:	Wait a  minute. 
*JUN:	 Er, Derek, paid him off, 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	and got Johnny   to finish it. 
*SAS:	Mummy. 
*JUN:	and er, I I saw Chris quite a lot, then, but I mean, they're not living how they used to do, I mean, they they were always boozing and that, (  )   
*KAR:	 Yeah, I know. 
*JUN:	she said they'd they'd cut down on boozing and everything.  ((cough)) But er, 
*KAR:	Give up, Sasha. 
*JUN:	I says to Tommy, why don't they buy one of them big caravans, I said, because every time they get  (.)  
*SAS:	Mum. 
*JUN:	it must be costing them a fortune, when every time they move, they alter 'ouse, they decorate and put new carpets down and    (  ) furniture   
*KAR:	 My God, we'll have to   (  )   
*ALB:	Yeah, well, I mean, I mean not   (.)   
*JUN:	 Yeah but I mean, twelve times, Karen. 
*KAR:	I know. You're saying like us, I mean, we wouldn't want to move again, I mean, if we move again, it's 'cos something's gonna happen with his business, ain't it, 
*JUN:	 Yeah. 
*ALB:	 Yeah. 
*KAR:	But, or because same thing like it were a couple of years ago, with  finances. 
*JUN:	 I mean, how how olds their oldest  (  ) , is it eighteen or seventeen. 
*KAR:	Is it Mandy whose older, 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	I mean, I thought Mandy's er, eighteen, nearly nineteen. 
*JUN:	So. 
*KAR:	Oh no, she must be older because er, Vicky's twenty   (.) she must be about eighteen. No, she's same age a Treena, twenty. 
*JUN:	So in twenty years, they've had twelve 'ouses 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	And you've been married how long? 
*KAR:	Twelve. 
*JUN:	Twelve years, and you've had  three. 
*KAR:	 Three. 
*JUN:	Christ, you better not be married twenty years, Karen, you might end up with another twelve. 
*KAR:	I know, but how many's your Pete and Margaret have, they had er, 
*JUN:	Er, they moved, they went on to  
*ALB:	 One, two, three. 
*JUN:	didn't they. 
*KAR:	Yeah, then t'   
*JUN:	Yeah, then, now they went to   (.) aye, they went to Oval, went to bungalow   
*KAR:	  (  ) yeah some four times. 
*JUN:	 four, yeah, four or five times, yeah. 
*KAR:	 Yeah.  Yeah. 
*JUN:	There's only us who never moved. 
*ALB:	Oh yeah. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Angie   (  ) how long's me mother been in there. I'm forty-eight this year, me mum must have been in there nearly fifty year. 
*ALB:	And we've only moved into here. 
*KAR:	In actual fact your Pete and Margaret have moved more, in the twelve years that they were married, I know they've been married longer now, but when,th  they been married twelve years and they moved four times, 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	we've been married twelve years, and we've moved three times, so we haven't moved as much as them, really. 
*ALB:	No. No. 
*JUN:	I couldn't keep moving  and   (  )   
*ALB:	 I couldn't move  like that. 
*JUN:	I mean, a couple of moves, is fair enough, yeah, but bloody twelve. 
*KAR:	No. 
*JUN:	And it's not as if they made money every time they moved, 'cos they haven't, 'cos they lost money on that 'ouse, there. 
*ALB:	Yes. 
*KAR:	I   (  ) won't it. 
*JUN:	Well, Chris said they moved because er, 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	Give up. 
*JUN:	er, transport, you know. It would be difficult for 'er to get back'ards and for'ards, and she were on her own all the time. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	That's why they moved. But they moved down, they moved from 'ere because he says, er, 
*ALB:	Too noisy, weren't it. 
*JUN:	 Too too noisy  and dogs were keeping them up all night. 
*KAR:	Oh. 
*JUN:	So I don't what the excuse is for moving from    (.)  Road. 
*KAR:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	Same thing, 'cos it's noisy down there. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*SAS:	I could scare you, Auntie June. 
*JUN:	Could ya. 
*SAS:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Go on then. 
*KAR:	Why people think it's noisy for us on a double main road, but it ain't really. 
*JUN:	Well, you get used it in don't ya. When our Norma come and stop here, she she was, 
*ALB:	Used to sleep  (  )  
*JUN:	I don't know how you sleep all night with all that traffic going up and down. 
*KAR:	No. 
*JUN:	But we never  hear it. 
*ALB:	 You don't hear it. 
*KAR:	No, we didn't. I remember one   (  ) first night we stopped there, buses were coming at crack of dawn, 
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	it must have been about four or five o'clock in morning, and now we never hear any traffic. 
*JUN:	No. 
*ALB:	No. Perhaps you get used to. 
*KAR:	Yeah. But we don't hear many people, on a road like that. 
*JUN:	No. I were thinking about that bungalow, and, well actually it's as far from   (.) our road, nearly as far from our road to there, as what is it from bungalow  window to road. 
*ALB:	 Where to   (.) yeah. 
*SAS:	 (  ) it really is  (  )  
*JUN:	Know, thinking about people walking back as far as t' shopping my point. There nowt much difference in, from t' garden  (.)  
*KAR:	I think the only trouble over there, is your to gonna have people parking in front of ya gate, like when they go to  the chip shop. 
*ALB:	 They won't   
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	They won't 'cos 'cos er, I'm afraid if they do, I shall be out straight away at 'em. 
*JUN:	Well, it's only a matter of parking at, parking your own car as well  
*ALB:	 I'll clamp the bugger, I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it. Park here at your  risk. 
*JUN:	 It'll  be awkward getting cars in and out, when you know, with one more to be out and, all these cars in road, like, but. 
*ALB:	That's the only difficulty. 
*KAR:	You'll probably end up say, leaving one on road all night. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Don't hurt    (  ) I mean, (  )   
*ALB:	 Oh, not leaving one on bloody road     (  )   
*JUN:	 Well, we could put 'em at  night time, it's just through time, if one backs in, comes in behind other. 
*KAR:	 Yeah. 
*ALB:	 It's  a one way street and all ain't it, that makes it worse. 
*JUN:	Why does it make it worse? 
*KAR:	Well, we don't have to have a problem, do we? 
*ALB:	No, but I mean. 
*KAR:	It's like barbed wire, I mean that's, Sasha come in 'ere. 
*JUN:	What backs onto that bungalow, Karen. 
*ALB:	Another 'ouse. 
*KAR:	Another 'ouse. 
*JUN:	Another 'ouse. 
*KAR:	Er, I told you what backs onto it, you know the right small on  , what you were going to see that time, but on the side. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	We went to see that, (  )  
*JUN:	 Oh. 
*KAR:	 That's  what backs onto it. 
*JUN:	Oh. well, at least they won't be looking int' bungalow will they, with it all being down, 
*KAR:	No. 
*JUN:	and that. 
*KAR:	Yeah, that's straight behind it. 
*JUN:	Oh. Not like them, I mean, they can see straight into our  (  )  
*KAR:	I'm not sure, but I think it was Mr   that had that bungalow built. You know Mr   
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Somebody told me that he had that built. 
*ALB:	Oh. 
*KAR:	Years ago before he had that 'ouse built on   Road. 
*ALB:	Oh. 
*JUN:	What you doing with the   (  ) a cup of tea. 
*KAR:	Sasha. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	She's there. 
*ALB:	She's there. 
*KAR:	Come 'ere. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Georgie babes. 
*KAR:	Them   (  ) can be   (  ) about, I mean, that's what it probably is. 
*JUN:	That's what it is. 
*ALB:	Dust, yeah. 
*KAR:	Oh. 
*JUN:	It's not so much now, it's so much that, 
*ALB:	 It's not his feathers, it's dust   
*JUN:	when he  (.)  
*KAR:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	when he does that, and he flaps, the dust off his body, 
*KAR:	Oh. 
*JUN:	You know like they're always picking their feathers. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Well, they have right tiny little scales, coming off their feathers, 
*KAR:	Oh. 
*JUN:	for the feathers to open out, like it's like wax. 
*ALB:	Wax. 
*KAR:	Oh, yeah,li  like like  birds have. Yeah, like birds have, 
*JUN:	 Yeah, like what they have on the crest. 
*KAR:	Yeah, yeah. 
*JUN:	Well, that's that's what  they're doing. 
*ALB:	 The problem is, it's dry. 
*JUN:	They're pulling it off, and when he's shed, he, all floated  (  )  
*KAR:	Is that what causes that parrot to  (.)  
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	To er, what call it. 
*ALB:	Yeah. We were  (  )  
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	No. 
*ALB:	Took us an age to cut it. 
*KAR:	 (  ) on there. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Oh, (  ) , or summat daft like that, they call it.  (  ) but, it's like sum  , it's like some people of being allergic to different things, you know. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	No, he wants to stay out, he pulls his feathers out when he's in cage. 
*KAR:	How do you   (  ) off feathers, and not off birds. 
*ALB:	You do, you get it off any bird. 
*JUN:	Yeah but some are not, not so much 'im 'cos he don't shed his feathers as much as 'im. 'e's not half, 'e's not half as dirty as 'im. I mean, you only have to look at top of that cupboard, and it were don't yesterday. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	That's  what I say. 
*JUN:	 Everywhere's  white, everywhere  white. 
*ALB:	 June, I did I did all dusting and polishing one day 
*SAS:	He's upside down. 
*ALB:	And this silly bugger's out, playing about. 
*KAR:	 (  ) heard that again. 
*ALB:	and when she came in, she said, you haven't done dusting. I said, I have, but I bloody have. But she wouldn't 'ave it. 
*SAS:	 (  )

*KAR:	I probably saw it, (  )  
*SAS:	Hello. 
*ALB:	I mean, before, before we got 'im, we could dust and  it used to stay all right. 
*JUN:	Actually dust off 'im, you, some of it you can't even see. The only time you'd see it, as if be in the light   
*ALB:	When it settles, I think. 
*JUN:	You know, you see it then. 
*ALB:	 When it settles on summat  dark. 
*KAR:	I know, I pulled   (  ) I told you, I'm having   (  ) deliver milk round, didn't I, they're ever so good. I'd only had it round about ten minutes  and I thought   (  )

*SAS:	I'm watching him flying about. I watch him flying about. 
*KAR:	You  (  )  
*ALB:	Last time he flew out, you were frightened. 
*JUN:	Our Tom don't like it when he flies and yet, they're not bothered about him, that one, that's the one that bites. 
*ALB:	He's more frightened of you than what you are of him, actually.
