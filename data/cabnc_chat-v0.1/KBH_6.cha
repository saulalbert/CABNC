@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 003906)
*ADA:	It would be eleven bedrooms and five receptions . •54325_88825•
        The point is, that  you've got to count, if , you've got to count one bedroom  •167225_269925•
*CAR:	Yes, I've got  •325325_330625•
*ADA:	you count one bedroom for all the . •335025_372425•
        You may even have to count two. •377325_396525•
        You certainly got to count one. •397725_420025•
        So two bedrooms out of twelve are no longer available. •420025_469625•
*CAR:	Sorry? •469625_472125•
        Say that again in English. •481225_493725•
*PAU:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	They're coming to collect the stuff next Thursday. •493725_549725•
        But I don't have to do it every day all day. •549725_596025•
        It's twenty tapes. •596025_612925•
        So that's twenty times ninety minutes. •618825_693325•
        talking about his  estimates. •740525_809525•
        Very exciting stuff and I've been telling her not to speak so loudly. •809525_897425•
        Have you had enough now? •904125_915525•
*ADA:	and then I'm talking about  right? •916225_968225•
        It's gonna cost five and a half thousand  mortgage. •968225_101842•
        At this point  would cost about  just, just about half. •101842_119862•
*UNK:	Six bedrooms would , six bedrooms would probably cost you two  to buy. •121962_127702•
        five and six bedroom houses and you won't get anything under two hundred thousand pounds. •134882_139422•
*ADA:	How much do you wanna to bet on that? •139432_144782•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ADA:	Mm? •146162_147002•
*UNK:	Where? •147042_147272•
*ADA:	I've been waiting for  on one. •147272_151882•
*UNK:	Where? •151882_151992•
*ADA:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	You've got to spend as much or twice as much there as you would there as you would anywhere else. •152222_157502•
        Those other properties, there isn't half the amount of work  need doing there as . •157502_161682•
        needs a lot of work. •163312_164092•
        If we moved in then we'd have to spend fifty thousand pound to get it up to scratch. •165062_168472•
        That's just to live in. •169322_170142•
*ADA:	Alright, O K, let's say two hundred grand, O K? •171812_173662•
        It's still fifty per cent less than one of those properties at Harrow Road, right? •173662_178662•
        Fifty per cent less on the mortgage means erm about three and a half thousand . •179412_190972•
        It's effectively eighteen thousand per annum saved, right? •190972_199202•
        The cost of  and  gain four bedrooms   •200982_221162•
*UNK:	the cheaper it should become. •221382_224722•
*ADA:	Oh yes it is, I don't doubt it  but the problem is  right? •224722_228972•
        And you've got to be realistic. •230302_233022•
        Because no bank is going to give you the money against the costs of the value of the property right? •233022_240332•
        They're gonna give you the  against equity  equity of some sort. •240972_250702•
        But the only way you can get the equity, right? •251532_254322•
        The only way we could get the equity. •254552_259902•
        We could do it. •259902_261302•
        The only thing I could do  I mean at the same time I'm saying O K I'll go in to do it this way, would be to actually say, sod this for a lark, instead of doing erm  totally private thing, gonna set up a private limited company  to issue  cheques. •262032_286872•
*JOE:	I really couldn't  I would never get the price I'd want for the alphabet. •288222_293142•
