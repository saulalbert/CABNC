*PS0CG:	That 's right Yes . 
*PS0CN:	Sally Now stop it Gosh end of the walk You should be tired Ah . 
*PS0CG:	Well I 'll have to have it if I want to throw it . 
*PS0CN:	No she this is what she does . 
*PS0CG:	She wants you to chase her I ca n't chase you I 'm far too old Ha got it . 
*PS0CN:	about three sticks on the way round so when we get here I 've got one to throw As she brings up one I 've got another one to throw and she drops what she 's got And this is how we 're going She 's been playing with the I thought well that 's good . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	she does n't need the extra belting around . 
*PS0CG:	Are you limping . 
*PS0CN:	Erm my arthritis is playing me up this week . 
*PS0CG:	Ooh . 
*PS0CN:	Do n't know why Whether what 's caused it . 
*PS0CG:	Cold A chill . 
*PS0CN:	My other knee got bad all of a sudden I mean I only had one bad knee but then this time I got two . 
*PS0CG:	Oh that 's rough . 
*PS0CN:	It is Sal Sally You do not . 
*PS0CG:	I 'll squeeze your paws I will I 'll squeeze your paws . 
*PS0CN:	Now I keep trying that with you oops Might be the weather I do n't know . 
*PS0CG:	Have you strained . 
*PS0CN:	I did gardening . 
*PS0CG:	Oh . 
*PS0CN:	Digging Could have been that . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Finds your weakest spots does n't it . 
*PS0CN:	It sure does I 'm not supposed to dig . 
*PS0CG:	Are n't you . 
*PS0CN:	Not really no Cos it aggravates the hip . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	what annoys me cos I love gardening . 
*PS0CG:	I used to do well I I still do all all the gardening that gets done I used to spend hours gardening . 
*PS0CN:	That 's what I like You go out there and you do n't realize how long you 've been out there . 
*PS0CG:	No No you do n't I do n't do so much now I 'm more a fair weather gardener . 
*PS0CN:	Well I keep going out there trying to keep the leaves down . 
*PS0CG:	That 's impossible round here . 
*PS0CN:	Well we 've got an oak out the front and I 've swept I 've got two bags . 
*PS0CG:	Oh I can imagine . 
*PS0CN:	The rest I 've put in the gutter off the path and of course the wind 's blown them all back off again . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Yes It 's funny whichever way the wind blows my back door and my front door both get covered with leaves . 
*PS0CN:	Yeah I want . 
*PS0CG:	It 's magic . 
*PS0CN:	really a continuous strongish wind to blow in one direction for quite a few hours It may blow them all into one spot . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Never happens like that though does it . 
*PS0CN:	We 've got one corner of the garden out the front and if the wind 's in the right direction it neatly puts them all together . 
*PS0CG:	Oh that 's . 
*PS0CN:	Cos the wall stops them And they 're much easier to pick up that way . 
*PS0CG:	That 's right . 
*PS0CN:	But she 's still got a load of leaves on her the old oak There 's still a lot more to come . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Oh yes there are I saw a gadget the other day in a magazine It was just like two dustbin lids Pick up a heap of leaves at one point . 
*PS0CN:	Oh yeah . 
*PS0CG:	I thought well you could use dustbin lids instead of sending of ten pounds to get two of their pieces of . 
*PS0CN:	I use my dust pan . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Yes I do . 
*PS0CN:	Because that 's smashing for just scooping up . 
*PS0CG:	Yes And you can hold them with a with a brush or the broom . 
*PS0CN:	Well I scooped it up and I got there You can always . 
*PS0CG:	Yeah . 
*PS0CN:	always wear rubber gloves anyway So often I just scoop a to put in And I even use it when I wan na shift snow I just if it 's a light snow . 
*PS0CG:	Yes That 's a good idea . 
*PS0CN:	I just scoop it up with that I found it a lot easier I mean I bought a lovely wide broom I thought oh that 'll be smashing for the snow just sweep . 
*PS0CG:	It 's hard work . 
*PS0CN:	And of course you do about a yard and then you 're stuck . 
*PS0CG:	You ca n't move No I find the best thing for snow cos we 've got an eight car driveway so you can imagine how much . 
*PS0CN:	Yeah That 's like we have to . 
*PS0CG:	snow I have to shift I get a thin long board and use that . 
*PS0CN:	It 's definitely easiest . 
*PS0CG:	As long as the board itself is n't too heavy . 
*PS0CN:	Well this is it I have to cos with the with the pan although I 'm bending it 's it 's not too bad because it 's not too heavy for me . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Well I get a board about here and just walk and push . 
*PS0CN:	Oh right It 's alright somebody had their windsc erm window smashed yesterday . 
*PS0CG:	I know A gentleman stopped me as I was coming back and he said do you own a white Austin Metro And it 's funny because the last car that I saw the fellow 's from I saw the fellow 's who did it . 
*PS0CN:	Oh you did . 
*PS0CG:	And got their car number Yes . 
*PS0CN:	Oh you have . 
*PS0CG:	And the police came and interviewed me about it That was a white Austin Metro Do n't think it 's the same young woman He said oh the car 's been broken into . 
*PS0CN:	No because it was funny cos we were talking to the lady She 's got a red setter And she 'd just arrived And she apparently She said do you know she said we 'd gone off to the woods and I suddenly remembered I 'd left my purse in the car . 
*PS0CG:	Oh no . 
*PS0CN:	She said so I went back and got my purse She said now apparently they 've got a horse somewhere round here and she said when she came back there was this car about half hour later after they 'd left here a car been broken into She said er it makes me wonder if I 'd left my purse in the car if it had of been our car that might have been dumped . 
*PS0CG:	Yeah . 
*PS0CN:	Well they 'd gone off and before Anthea had gone and I was still fiddling about getting the windows clean This car drew in there and a chap got out and I thought what dog 's he got You know . 
*PS0CG:	That 's what I always think I look for the dog or the jogging suit and if they have n't got a dog or a jogging suit I think what are they up to . 
*PS0CN:	Well see he he was quite tall and when he got out he was a bit scruffy looking and his shirt was hanging out below his jacket . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	And he got out I ca n't see any dog But he walked very purposefully erm straight up there and then I noticed he 'd got a hook . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	instead of a right hand . 
*PS0CG:	That 's useful for breaking into things is n't it . 
*PS0CN:	And I and I thought to myself oh no perhaps he 's legitimate He 's just going for a walk . 
*PS0CG:	No it 's odd . 
*PS0CN:	But it 's a maroony dirty maroony and black I think it was car And it was a W M X the letters were . 
*PS0CG:	Did n't you tell the police You should give them a ring and tell them if you saw a strange man . 
*PS0CN:	Well yeah I did I mean he disappeared from sight whereas the others . 
*PS0CG:	Well he would if you were waiting around here Of course you look as though . 
*PS0CN:	Ah I du n no One morning when I came here there was a car arrived here and it was a a dirty yellow one and thr two women and a bloke got out all dressed in black jeans and black jumpers . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	So I thought now that 's odd They did n't look the sort to go for a ramble . 
*PS0CG:	perhaps . 
*PS0CN:	And they come out and they sort of were looking around and there was a load of cars here And I thought I do n't like the look of that . 
*PS0CG:	Mm . 
*PS0CN:	So I was standing there and I thought to myself pretend I 'm looking at my watch and I 'm waiting for someone . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	And they hung about and hung about and then they came across here looked at the board and they kept turning round and looking where I was And I was still hanging there Then they walked down there but not out of sight of the cars Then they came back read the notice board again I must have been there about five or ten minutes . 
*PS0CG:	neat haircuts . 
*PS0CN:	They looked quite quite presentable . 
*PS0CG:	0 . 
*PS0CN:	One woman was very fat And I still stood there so I got in the car and wrote the number down . 
*PS0CG:	Good for you . 
*PS0CN:	Cos I thought I 'm never gon na remember it And eventually they got in and went off But they were they kept on looking at me to see if I was gon na move and I thought I 'm not gon na move till you move . 
*PS0CG:	Mm . 
*PS0CN:	Cos the fact that they only went down there came back and were milling around waiting I would n't have been a bit surprised cos the car was a filthy old car . 
*PS0CG:	You should have told you should have told the police Any car number you can . 
*PS0CN:	They had n't done anything . 
*PS0CG:	No But any car number you can get if they 're acting suspiciously please tell them That 's what they keep telling me . 
*PS0CN:	Oh I see Cos they had er . 
*PS0CG:	Because they came and interviewed me If you see anything suspicious The last time I phoned up I said the bicycle that was hidden in the bushes Obviously been stolen Down there that erm Davey and I found together His dog erm found it you know Sam Erm next day it was still there although he 'd phoned the police So I phoned them up in the afternoon and I said the bicycle that my friend Mr reported yesterday afternoon is still in the bushes I said and I have a feeling that there was somebody there watching me I could feel it I said and as I came back up what I call the straight path parallel with the road there were two men loitering in the bushes against the car park . 
*PS0CN:	Oi . 
*PS0CG:	Both very well dressed Jeans but clean and spruce and I said I have a feeling they could have been police And he burst out laughing and said you 're quite right madam they were police . 
*PS0CN:	No these did n't give me the feeling of being police . 
*PS0CG:	No But there 's one I thought how stupid It 's alright to park erm a non police car but there was a policeman actually sitting in the car while two of them loitered in there They were obviously staking out the place But while there 's a man sitting respectably in a car no-one 's gon na break into the other cars . 
*PS0CN:	I know . 
*PS0CG:	Not if they 're witnessed are they . 
*PS0CN:	No I mean because I mean erm . 
*PS0CG:	So the other police should have gone into the other should have gone away somewhere . 
*PS0CN:	I did n't I did n't cotton on to these two er these three . 
*PS0CG:	And yet you feel uneasy . 
*PS0CN:	Erm it was the way they sort of checked all the way round the car park as if they were looking to see which would be the best And I mean they did get out and have a little mooch around the car park . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	And I thought to myself no I 'm not gon na go out I did start to go out the park and I thought no . 
*PS0CG:	Yeah I 'm like you . 
*PS0CN:	Because what if they do break in Perhaps I 'm I 'm misjudging but perhaps what if they did how would I feel . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	So I thought no I 'll wait and see . 
*PS0CG:	Oh you should give the police that number Just to be on the safe side . 
*PS0CN:	I 've lost it now cos I 've chucked the matchbox out . 
*PS0CG:	Oh what a shame . 
*PS0CN:	But it was a yellow car and it had like soft toys and that in the back . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	On the back window ledge . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	Cos I thought to myself well I 'll never remember the make of car I mean I 'm I 'm hopeless with cars But I thought to myself oh you do you do look suspicious And then I was talking to somebody about this and they and they burst out laughing and said well we 've got a friend a male friend a mate of mine he said and he loves walking . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	He said and what he often does is because he lives over this area He 'll often cut through this way to go over to Wellington into Crowthorne and walk all the way round . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	He said he often walks through the woods on his own I had to laugh He must forgive us ladies do a sidestep He said he is legitimate He just loves walking . 
*PS0CG:	Oh yes But the police would much rather you told them when there 's no . 
*PS0CN:	Yes . 
*PS0CG:	nothing to be nothing wrong with it than that you did n't tell them and there might be something wrong with it . 
*PS0CN:	Oh I 'll have to keep my eyes open Cos I thought well the couple had only just walked up there and I thought to myself oh well he might meet up with them you know . 
*PS0CG:	The young the young officer who came to me he said of course we 're so glad you got the number you 're quite right it 's a car that 's been doing the same thing in Wokingham We only know that they live somewhere in the Wokingham area It 's lads who earn their living at this . 
*PS0CN:	Yeah yeah . 
*PS0CG:	They go from car park to car park He said er but of course the thing is they do n't expect elderly ladies to notice their car numbers and remember them Now I may not remember always the make first glance off unless I look at it But this was an eastern European car so they did n't expect me to know the make But I do remember numbers . 
*PS0CN:	Oh I 've got a terrible memory . 
*PS0CG:	And I scratched it on there to make sure that I did n't forget it . 
*PS0CN:	Oh I see . 
*PS0CG:	And as soon as I got home I wrote it down I put it on there with my key number or whatever it was It 's probably still there now It is it 's still there It 's still there . 
*PS0CN:	Oh this was this was er W M X I remembered that because what did it remind me of W M X . 
*PS0CG:	Like a B M X bike I expect . 
*PS0CN:	Yeah or a volk volkswagen or something . 
*PS0CG:	Mm . 
*PS0CN:	Something clicked as I looked at the number . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	It 's like with a lot of number plates Sometimes it oh that 's so and so 's . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	I mean a lot of mine I ca n't even remember me own number plate . 
*PS0CG:	0 . 
*PS0CN:	But I No I went back and got in the car and was fiddling about and I wrote it down on a matchbox you see . 
*PS0CG:	Yes good idea . 
*PS0CN:	But the funny thing is by the time I got home I still remembered it . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Cos you 'd written it down If you had n't written it down you would n't have . 
*PS0CN:	No Er this is I mean I 've just got that way I thought to myself well if I do n't write it down now cos that 's why I got back in my car . 
*PS0CG:	You should have told the police they 'd have been interested . 
*PS0CN:	Oh well then another time then I 'll remember that . 
*PS0CG:	Cos you see I said why why ca n't you trace the car I mean the number 's quite I said you you reaffirmed that the number was the same one that had been doing the same thing in in Wokingham He said the car belonged to an elderly lady in Wokingham We 've traced it that far She had sold it and she had n't told the erm Swansea people you know . 
*PS0CN:	Yeah . 
*PS0CG:	The vehicle licensing people It 's so easy to just write the slip and say I 've sold my car to mister so and so I always do it Erm and then that person she 'd sold it to she knew their address They went to him and he had sold it as well and they could n't . 
*PS0CN:	Yeah cos since they 've done away with the log book . 
*PS0CG:	And it had n't been registered . 
*PS0CN:	Where you used to have to send the . 
*PS0CG:	Exactly . 
*PS0CN:	log book in and it would come back . 
*PS0CG:	It had n't been registered so they 'd got the police have got no way of tracing it . 
*PS0CN:	No . 
*PS0CG:	Except keep driving round Wokingham looking for it . 
*PS0CN:	I mean they at least they could pick you up cos they 'd had the log book . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	In the old days . 
*PS0CG:	Yeah It was good was n't it . 
*PS0CN:	Yeah And each car they knew where they were did n't they . 
*PS0CG:	That 's right And the previous owner and the previous owner . 
*PS0CN:	That 's it Cos it was all written down . 
*PS0CG:	Yes . 
*PS0CN:	Oh all these barred stuff . 
*PS0CG:	They 've got everything on computers now and it does n't work half the time does it . 
*PS0CN:	Well it 's only as good as the person putting it in . 
*PS0CG:	Yeah too true . 
*PS0CN:	That 's what they used to say Still human error . 
*PS0CG:	Yes Oh yes . 
*PS0CN:	Until you get a computer for computing a computer . 
*PS0CG:	Yes With a mind of it 's own An intelligence . 
*PS0CN:	That 's what I mean Then that 's frightening . 
*PS0CG:	Yes It is is n't it .
