*LEE:	Oh. 
*BRE:	Erm 
*LEE:	Any phone calls? 
*BRE:	No.  (.) Tomorrow, cos dad's erm Nigel's gonna be phoning dad   (.) in the afternoon. So Jill's gonna phone you tomorrow, but you're not going out tomorrow morning are you? 
*LEE:	No. 
*BRE:	Jill's phoning you tomorrow morning. So it might be easier   (.) she said that she's going to visit Vic at two o'clock 
*LEE:	Mm. 
*BRE:	till about half three.  (.) Then she's coming home   (.) and then she's going back over there about six o'clock till eight o'clock. And she was gonna said, that she was gonna drop you off there at two then pick you up again at eight. Now you're not gonna wanna be six hours   (.) at a hospital bedside are you?  (.) And er Clare said tonight she's going and Joe's gonna probably pop over tomorrow. 
*LEE:	What time are they going? 
*BRE:	Well they just said tomorrow, Clare said tomorrow evening then Joe said oh no I'm gonna go Sunday. And Clare said oh I'm going tomorrow. So what I thought to do, if Jill phones tomorrow   (.) morning 
*LEE:	Mm. 
*BRE:	cos dad's gonna be working now till about three anyway so he's not gonna be able to take you. Say to Jill, yes you could go over with her at two o'clock   (.) and then come back with her about four. And just you're just gonna nip in with dad then and try and get your suit. (.)  
*LEE:	Mm. 
*BRE:	Yeah? 
*LEE:	Yeah. (.)  
*BRE:	I looked at that one again at Burtons today. Erm   (.) and the, is is James' sort of like the lightish grey, was it eighty nine, ninety nine sort of a slate sort of grey? 
*LEE:	Dunno. Might be. 
*BRE:	It's not, it's not a light grey with lines in it? Sort of, looks almost sort of shinyish? 
*LEE:	I don't know. I can't remember. 
*BRE:	You can't remember? Well they've got  that   
*LEE:	 No. 
*BRE:	and they've also got it in a dark green which is really nice. 
*LEE:	In a dark green? 
*BRE:	Yeah. Sort of erm  (.)  
*LEE:	Burtons in Woking? 
*BRE:	Yeah. It's sort of like an olivey green. Not bottle green.  (.) It's sort of like erm   (.) what's an olive green in here Jean? 
*JEA:	Well I was just looking round, is it like  the colour of that   
*BRE:	 Yes. Very  sort of lighter than, no lighter than that.  That's bottle   
*LEE:	 It's a lot lighter than  that. 
*BRE:	Yes.  (.) Something like in that picture. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*LEE:	It's like that. 
*BRE:	Yeah. 
*JEA:	Mm. Mm. 
*BRE:	Have you seen it?  (.) Yeah well that's eighty nine plus there's fifteen percent off. 
*LEE:	What are the ones that the Italians wear called?  Special ones. 
*BRE:	 What do you call  the double-breasted Italian suits? (.)  
*JEA:	Don't remember. (.)  
*BRE:	But what I'll do is, if tomorrow I get time   (.) I'll have a look in erm   (.) Top Shop. If I'm over that way. And if there is any decent suits then I'll let you know. 
*LEE:	Mhm. 
*BRE:	And then   (.) if you don't get it tomorrow perhaps  one night after school   
*LEE:	 It might be easier just to  hire one. 
*BRE:	No. Why pay fifty quid to hire one? 
*JEA:	It's ridiculous. 
*LEE:	  (  )  
*BRE:	 When you're gonna pay  seventy five quid and you've got one. 
*JEA:	 Mm. Mm   
*LEE:	 Yeah  but where am I gonna wear it again? I'll   (.) would   (.) outgrown it within a few months. 
*BRE:	Well no you buy a size bigger. 
*JEA:	Oh definitely yes. 
*BRE:	You like them bigger. I mean you buy it you're not gonna, I mean   (.) alright you're gonna have a bit more grown but you're only gonna get a bit more muscly. And you like them baggy anyway, you don't get one that fits you er buy   (.) That's why I said it would have been probably better to pay the extra twenty quid and bought the Italian style double- breasted 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	for their baggy effect see. 
*LEE:	Yeah but where can you buy them? (.)  
*BRE:	Tut   (.) that shop next door to   (.) erm Intersports. (.)  
*LEE:	Suit and Co   (.) I think that's called. 
*BRE:	No. That it's a nice man's shop. It's a beautiful man's shop. 
*LEE:	Yeah I know. It's dear. 
*BRE:	Yeah but I don't, see savings they've got on suits at the moment, special offers on them cos they're not shifting them.  (.) But it's ridiculous you   (  ) fifty quid a night to hire a suit.  (.) Because you pay your fifty pound and that's it.  (.) But this suit, I mean. That's what I said if you buy a grey suit   (.) the trousers   (.) you'll, I mean alright if you don't, I mean you'll wear, grey won't date. Will it Jean? 
*JEA:	No. No.  It never dates. 
*BRE:	 Green will  date. 
*JEA:	Yes. And you'll get bored with it. 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	But grey will not, I mean  Granddad Sid's   
*JEA:	 Goes on forever. 
*BRE:	sixty five and he's still wearing his grey suits. 
*JEA:	Yes. Yes. 
*BRE:	I mean dad got married in his suit. I mean now he's given it to granddad.  But grey, the actual   
*LEE:	 It doesn't fit him. 
*BRE:	Yeah it doesn't fit him. I mean it hasn't, I mean dad's was quite an expensive suit when he got married.  (.) I mean alright that's eighteen years ago. And the trous  I mean the jacket never   (.) I mean very rarely does a suit jacket style change. The trousers you get flared, but that's no problem cos you just have them altered. If you have them   (.) you know I mean I can't see, I mean you wear your trousers baggyish  and long  . 
*JEA:	 It's not  it's not time for flared trousers yet. 
*BRE:	No.  That's what   
*JEA:	  (  )  
*BRE:	I'm saying. It's not time. 
*LEE:	And I haven't got no shoes to go with   (.) whatever I get. 
*JEA:	Well, you'll get a pair of shoes  (  ) . 
*BRE:	Well you got to have shoes, we know you've got   (.) I mean you've got, need new school shoes. You've gotta have this new pair of shoes as well.  (.) No good worrying about it Lee, you've got   (.) I mean, you can't   (.) you've gotta have the things you've gotta have. 
*LEE:	Mm. (.)  
*BRE:	But you'll have to get your   (.) moonboots and things like that. You'll have to buy them for your skiing trip. 
*LEE:	Mm.  (  ) sort of been given a hundred pound upstairs. 
*BRE:	Because that's what   (.) they money they'd owed you? 
*LEE:	Does he? 
*BRE:	And it   (.) well you're meant to get fifteen pound aren't you, he's meant to pay you for the work? 
*LEE:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	But you haven't got fifteen pound.  ((laugh))  You're a bit skint. 
*JEA:	 Well I'm going to chip in with  thirty aren't I? 
*BRE:	Jean's gonna help towards your trip too. 
*LEE:	Okay. Thanks Jean. 
*BRE:	And nan's gonna help so  (.)  
*JEA:	Oh yes    (  )   
*BRE:	 You'll cope with it  but you've gotta buy, your moonboots we should be able to get the market Jill said   (.) around, I mean we can get them in cash and carry for nine ninety nine but   (.) we should be able to get them at Blackbushe market for five to six ninety nine. 
*LEE:	Yeah. 
*BRE:	We've managed to hire the jackets   (.) the Salopettes   (.) the ski glasses   (.) the socks   (.) I've sorted out, I've told nan to buy you for Christmas. That's no problem. The anorak we've hi  we've borrowed. So we've borrowed everything erm   (.) oh you've gotta buy some proper ski gloves. You want those   (.) cos they're thirty seven quid aren't they and they're in the sale for seventeen quid at the moment. (.)  
*LEE:	 (  ) 
*BRE:	Half price. Yeah I saw that but it's not, they're going quite quickly. Because 
*JEA:	Yes I'd I'd pounce on those because    (  )   
*LEE:	  (  ) has got? 
*BRE:	 We might have a look in Intersport cos Woking    (.) Yeah. But I looked today in   (.) erm cash and carry sport and they were the same price. No they were nineteen quid. But they were the short ones. The ones you want are the good long ones aren't they? And thermal 
*LEE:	Your hands are really warm. 
*BRE:	I know and they're thirty odd quid. The right price. 
*JEA:	Mm. And what are they down to? 
*BRE:	Seventeen ninety nine. 
*JEA:	Throw your body across them. 
*BRE:	Yeah. We'll see if we can pick up a pair of them. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	Perhaps you can have them for Christmas or something. Erm   (.) so we've managed to hire everything so all you've gotta, you've gotta buy is your moonboots. 
*LEE:	Mhm. 
*BRE:	Erm   (.) the suit you've got to have. You've got to have    (  )   
*LEE:	 I've got to have that by  December the thirteenth. 
*BRE:	Yeah well   (.) if we don't get it tomorrow we'll have to go one night, it's late night shopping till nine o'clock. 
*LEE:	Mm. 
*BRE:	If dad's on his half past four, if he can get to kip   (.) if you go over at seven o'clock one night. It's not gonna take you, it's only gonna take you and dad an hour isn't it? 
*LEE:	Mm. 
*BRE:	But he's got to do it on Access because   (.) there's no money in the bank to write a cheque out and pay for the suit. So I can't go and do it. 
*LEE:	Have I got any cash cards? 
*BRE:	No and you're not having cash cards either. 
*LEE:	Why? 
*BRE:	What do you want a cash card for? 
*LEE:	No it's    (  )   
*JEA:	 You can't  draw out cash if it isn't there. And, and that's the trouble with the cash card. You you tend to think    (  )   
*BRE:	 You can't have a cash card  with a post office account anyway. 
*JEA:	No. 
*LEE:	No with the Alliance though. 
*BRE:	Yeah but what do you wanna cash card for? 
*LEE:	So I can get money out if I ever need it. 
*BRE:	Yeah but that money is, you've saved   (.) and I mean nan put that in when you were younger too, a lot of it. So I mean it's for when you're older. When you're desperate, you need it, not to just draw out and spend. 
*LEE:	I know. I won't just draw out and spend. 
*BRE:	 No you don't   
*JEA:	 You will you know.  I'm the expert on that. 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	I've drawn out and spent. Because it was there. I I mean it's ever so difficult to resist the temptation 
*BRE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	to spend money. 
*BRE:	It it, it's like me. If I had an Access card   (.) I would buy him this that and everything. And I'd say oh come on we'll buy the suit. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	And then right, and then you can also buy   (.) the shirt and tie. 
*LEE:	Mm. 
*BRE:	You can afford that. Cos you've got all that money saved. We've had to sponge off him all week. Borrow all his money. And it ended up we owed him say ninety quid. 
*JEA:	 ((laughing)) I know. I know . 
*BRE:	Mind you he went out and he had to have er   (.) erm mind you he's had that, when you think of it you've had half of that back. I said to Dave   (.) I said how have you spent all that money? He said I've been giving Lee dinner money every day. I said well I wondered, he didn't ask me for it. I said I thought he was using his own. 
*LEE:	No   (.) all he's given me each day is paper money   (.) plus about one fifty. So all together   (  ) given me about five pounds. 
*BRE:	Yeah well it adds up. 
*LEE:	Yeah I know. 
*JEA:	 (  ) 
*BRE:	And we had to pay fifteen quid for the train ticket. So that's another twenty quid. We've  gotta   (  ) pay for your computer. 
*JEA:	 It adds up dreadfully  . I mean I'm subbing one   (.) well I'm subbing two of my lodgers. I'm subbing Neil   (.) but that's out of money which he gives me and which really in theory ought to be for my own, own use you know for fun but   (.) I get housing benefit for him, from the council. And most of that goes back to him for his karate and a   (.) pint of beer in the pub. And I, I sort of dole out a little here and a little there. And I'm also subbing my lodger Paul.  (.) Erm and it, it it mounts up. By the time you've bought them some cigarettes and given them some   (.) money for the   ((laughing)) pub  and said well if there er and the car hasn't got any petrol so you pay for ten pounds worth of petrol. You're through fifty pounds before you can blink an eyelid. 
*LEE:	Mm. 
*JEA:	It's one of the   (.) well known things about money. 
*BRE:	How much   (.) would you say, this lot here was Lee? 
*LEE:	 ((cough))Including these   (  ) and that here? 
*BRE:	Yeah. They're all Neil's presents. 
*LEE:	Erm   (15.0) Was there a sale on? 
*BRE:	No. 
*LEE:	No?  (.)  ((cough)) (15.0) Sixty? 
*BRE:	  ((laugh))  
*JEA:	  ((laugh))  Two hundred and fifty nine. 
*LEE:	Two hundred and fifty nine? 
*JEA:	Yeah. That was it, wasn't it Brenda?  (.) No more because I then paid another thirty   (.) approximately for that two hundred and eighty nine   (.) for that   (  ) that, that came to twenty seven and I had   (.) there were two items inside it, I forget what they are.  (.) There's another nearly thirty pound cheque on top of the   (.) Marks and Spencer charge card. 
*BRE:	Soon goes my darling. 
*LEE:	What time did you get in from the shopping? 
*BRE:	Mm weren't too bad. About quarter to eight. 
*JEA:	Mm. 
*BRE:	Didn't start until about twenty to six. 
*LEE:	Dad said you went out at four. 
*BRE:	Yeah we went and had something to eat first then  (  ) . You wouldn't like to make me and Jean a nice cup of tea would you please, darling. 
*LEE:	I'm not very well.

*BRE:	No that's alright. (  )   
*JEA:	 Just hot? 
*LEE:	Mm.
