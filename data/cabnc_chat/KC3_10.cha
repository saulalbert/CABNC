*FRE:	 [whispering] No  [] ! (.) Er not, it's not serious, I, I'd just like some independent er   (.) er info, you know?
*YVO:	Yes, yes.
*FRE:	Mm.
*YVO:	Er no we often don't have anybody in er physio.Does your hand hurt?Are you not happy about it? (.) 
*FRE:	Well I still 
*YVO:	It's still solid isn't it?
*FRE:	I still, I s it's still swollen and I still haven't got my full grip, I'm seeing the surgeon again today
*YVO:	Mm.
*FRE:	but er I'm having physio er privately you know on, on the thing
*YVO:	Mm.
*FRE:	but I'm, I'm rapidly running out of the allowance erm   (.) she appears to be   (.) satisfied
*YVO:	Right.
*FRE:	but obviously   ((laugh)) I, I'd like somebody else's opinion really
*YVO:	Yes, yes.
*FRE:	and I'm seeing the surgeon today and erm   (.) and I met somebody the other day who'd had it done and his fingers weren't affected, you know, so I mean it's just the luck of the draw I think.However   (.) I thought well I'm, I'm er
*YVO:	Mind you it does look better than when I saw it last.
*FRE:	Oh yes it is.
*YVO:	Isn't it?
*FRE:	Oh it is, it is, oh it is 
*YVO:	Yeah it's improving, yeah.
*FRE:	it's not er although the, the inflammation   (.) it was not good at the weekend.
*YVO:	Oh.Perhaps you're doing too much Fred and not resting it.
*FRE:	Say again?
*YVO:	You're doing too much, you're not resting it. ((laugh)) 
*FRE:	Well no I'm not I mean this is it erm you don't know er how much to do
*YVO:	No.
*FRE:	and how much not to do really.Oh.
*YVO:	Oh right   (.) hope the surgeon might be able to provide you with  (        ) 
*FRE:	Mm well   (.) I, I mean really I want him to tell me   (.) I mean she implies that I'm gonna get, you know, back   (.) fully back to normal but   (.) I   (.) I'm beginning to wonder myself
*YVO:	Mm.
*FRE:	er I, I mean I really can't doubt her but erm, you know, you, how you have hunches.
*YVO:	Yeah.
*FRE:	I feel as though I'm on a plateau at the moment although sh sh when I said that she said well   (.) i it is getting better so the 
*YVO:	There's a physio. [shouting] Trish    []  (.) I've got a patient for you Trish if you've got five minutes to spare please. ((laugh)) 
*TRI:	Oh dear.
*FRE:	Er he's ever such a nice patient though 
*YVO:	It's not serious.
*TRI:	Oh great!
*FRE:	he's ever such a nice patient.You didn't have the pleasure of meeting him when he used to work here.
*YVO:	 ((laugh)) This is Fred, he used to, he used to work in   (        ) 
*FRE:	Hello. (        ) contracture.
*TRI:	Is that what you've got?
*FRE:	Opera no, I've had it.
*YVO:	He's had an operation.
*FRE:	Mm.
*YVO:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	No no, I won't say that.Operation the sixth of December   (.) on the little finger   (.) er and my other fingers swelled up  (        ) 
*TRI:	Mm.
*FRE:	and are still not down. (.) Really what I'm wanting you to tell me is how normal is that and
*TRI:	 ((sigh)) To be honest I'm not, I erm   (.) not quite sure really.I mean have, have you been back to, to, to clinic following   (        ) 
*FRE:	Oh yeah yeah yeah.Well I had it done on the insurance you know 
*TRI:	Right yeah.
*FRE:	so I'm seeing the surgeon again today
*TRI:	Are you?You 
*FRE:	but of course he's the one who's done it
*TRI:	Mm.
*FRE:	so even if he sort of made a, a bodge, I'm not suggesting he has   [laughing] he's not likely to, to   [] say yes that's because of that.
*TRI:	So is the finger better then?I mean
*FRE:	Well   (.) erm it, oh well I mean it is better in as much as it was sticking out like that
*TRI:	Mm.
*FRE:	and I can   [laughing] whereas I   [] couldn't get a glove on now I can now.
*TRI:	Right.
*FRE:	I haven't got all that much movement.
*TRI:	Yeah.
*FRE:	Well you know I mean it's not too bad I suppose.
*TRI:	No I'd just be, I mean I must admit I've, I've not really seen one for years and years and years.You get quite sort of specialized.I think 
*FRE:	Yeah quite.
*TRI:	undoubtedly I think you need to ask him, you know, that erm just say to him that you're very concerned about the fingers
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*TRI:	and, you know, what can, what can   (        ) do about it.
*FRE:	Now the physio, I'm I'm having the, I'm having physio
*TRI:	Yeah.
*FRE:	and I was just saying to Yvonne er I'm rapidly running out of my physio allowance, you know, because of the amount that 
*TRI:	Yes, yeah, yeah perhaps you're not 
*FRE:	she's doing erm and she seems to imply that er it will get back to normal but, you know, I   (.) I just, I'm not er happy about that myself.
*TRI:	Well I would have thought so but really erm I think you just need to sort of 
*FRE:	I, I, I mean it really has been swollen and er inflamed 
*TRI:	So it's down a bit?
*FRE:	Oh yes.
*TRI:	Yeah.
*FRE:	Oh yes, yes yes yes.Oh yes and I had er pressure sores, you know?
*TRI:	Mm.Yeah, no I think you just need to be frank with him and you know say   (.) you're happy about the finger, fine, but just, you know, (        ) 
*FRE:	I'm more concerned about these
*TRI:	Yeah.
*FRE:	because these were okay  ((laugh)) 
*TRI:	Right
*FRE:	than, than this.
*TRI:	Yeah, well no I would be direct with him and say, you know
*FRE:	Yeah.
*TRI:	you're really worried about these
*FRE:	Yeah.
*TRI:	and, and just see, sort of see what, what he says really
*FRE:	Mm.
*TRI:	and if you're having physio that's, that's good but like you say   (        ) 
*YVO:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	No I mean I, I don't know how much.It, the bill was hundred and thirty eight quid last month   (.) and it'll be more than that this month and I think my yearly allowance is about three hundred, you know, so I'm rapidly running out. (.) Anyway thanks for your, no no 
*TRI:	Sorry I can't really sort of say I must admit I couldn't really see why they should be like that really cos I mean it is a bit puzzling cos if they've only just done anything, they've only been tampering with this finger so 
*FRE:	The, the, the the other thing er I, I have the feeling in this finger of, not pins and needles, but just a slight difference he's obviously cut some nerves I should imagine.But er you know I'm, as I say, I'm more concerned about those  (.) 
*TRI:	How annoying.But I must admit I haven't seen an I haven't seen, you know it's years well it'll be years   (        ) 
*FRE:	You see what what I'm up against is, I mean the physio who, who, I mean she's private of course 
*TRI:	Mm.
*FRE:	she is one wanting er referrals from Mr  so she's not going to say oh well you know there's something wrong there, you know?
*TRI:	Mm.
*FRE:	Is she?
*TRI:	No.
*FRE:	You see.Er er and er   (.) I'm not saying that there is necessarily, but even if there was she's not going to because she wants to preserve her, her referrals.Don't want me   (        ) 
*TRI:	Well I'd just say you're really worried about these fingers
*FRE:	Yeah.
*TRI:	and that, you know, (        ) and you just say, you know   (.) you know, what, what are you   [laughing] gonna do about this  [] 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*TRI:	you know, should it, should it actually be like  (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*TRI:	Then if you get some answers then you can always say to him well this is what, you know, this is what 
*FRE:	Yeah well I mean I saw him what, either a fortnight or three weeks ago, three, probably about three weeks, and at that stage my plaster that I'd had on after the er op had only been off perhaps a fortnight, it was Christmas intervening you see, so he had every sort of right to say, you know, oh well yeah   (.) it should be okay, yeah. (        ) 
*TRI:	Think the only thing you can do is as I say be honest and say that, you know, you're very worried about your fingers
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah.
*TRI:	 (        ) I know it's not a lot of help but erm
*FRE:	No well you, you
*TRI:	I'm, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to say whether it was   (        ) or not so  (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, well that, that's fine, that's all I wanted to know, I'm pleased you popped in,i it 
*TRI:	 [laughing] Sorry   [] 
*FRE:	yes but i it's sort of erm
*TRI:	Even if it's only to give you the confidence you know 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*TRI:	to sort of 
*FRE:	Yeah.
*TRI:	It's awful I  (        ) , I'm the same if I'm going to see a doctor, I think ooh
*FRE:	Well when you've got 
*TRI:	you forget what you were going to ask   (        ) 
*FRE:	Yes but when you've been, when you've been in the work as I have over many years with doctors, I was a mental welfare officer so I mean I know   (.) er, you know, you can be fobbed off.
*TRI:	That's right.No go for it. ((laugh))  (.) 
*FRE:	Right.
*TRI:	 (        )  ((laugh)) Well I hope it is   (        ) but they're not good are they?
*FRE:	Well if that,th 
*TRI:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Yes I'm, yeah, yeah I mean I can drive
*TRI:	But that's it?
*FRE:	er but I haven't got, I haven't got a grip. (.) 
*TRI:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Thanks very much.
*TRI:	get sorted out
*FRE:	Thanks.Cheers.
*TRI:	Okay, bye. (.) 
*FRE:	Oh well that was useful. (.) 
*YVO:	 (        )  (.)
