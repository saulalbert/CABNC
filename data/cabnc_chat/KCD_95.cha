        What daddy's like. •238585_238674•
        Anyway makes it look a little smarter doesn't it, than with a green carpet, it'll look nice, yes. •239347_239938•
*AMY:	I can't choose another carpet can I? •240125_240304•
*HEL:	No. •240348_240395•
        It looks better all the same colour instead of some walls green, some walls white. •240442_241151•
*AMY:	Yeah. •241260_241272•

*HEL:	No I had to study the book. •242998_243212•
*AMY:	Why? •243212_243245•
*HEL:	Well for English literature they set you so many books to study, that was one of them. •243605_244070•
        a stupid book . •244079_244338•
*AMY:	questions . •244338_244357•
*HEL:	Yes, from all the characters and •244360_244677•
*AMY:	Pardon. •244677_244683•
*HEL:	From all the characters and how they fitted into the story. •244683_245010•
*AMY:	Did you pass? •245010_245477•
*HEL:	Only just . •245477_245628•
        I don't like that book at all, it was a book. •245628_246069•
*AMY:	What other books are there? •246075_246365•
*HEL:	You have a Shakespeare play, you had Silas Marner I think I quite liked that one. •246526_247029•
        I had one of J-  uhum, oh I can't remember his name, another play. •247156_248064•
        George Bernard Shaw. •248064_248239•
*AMY:	Hm,. •248239_248274•
*HEL:	Thought that was fairly silly as well. •248502_248650•
        That was four, I think that was probably all I had, two books, two plays, it's quite enough. •248686_249395•
*AMY:	What're you having for dinner? •249404_250134•
*HEL:	Chicken casserole, and you can have a little bit. •250134_250445•
*AMY:	. •_•
*HEL:	Well you look better than you did, you've got some colour in your face now. •250459_251214•
*AMY:	I'll have a tiny bit. •251215_251260•
*HEL:	You can have a little bit of something to eat  •251369_251798•

*HEL:	Well I need daddy to a  start along there . •257927_258575•
*AMY:	Why can't you? •258575_258769•
*HEL:	Well the light has got to come off and you've got to drop a perpendicular so that you know, cut the paper straight, it helps if you put it up straight instead of wonky. •258888_259831•
