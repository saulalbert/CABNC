Gill (PS0BK)  [64] That's Dave's birthday, thirteenth of June.
Nancy (PS0BS) [65] Really?
              [66] ... Have you got any stamps?
Jemma (PS0BL) [67] No cos I only got it this summer cos my other one was
              nicked, my other one which had all my really nice visas in it,
              which I was really [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [68] I ordered mine from Nigeria.
              [69] And a few others.
              [70] I love that passport.
              [71] This passport is just fucking excellent, I love it.
Nancy (PS0BS) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [72] Well yeah, just because of the ... stamps in it and stuff,
              like real memories and s things.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Nancy (PS0BS) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [73] Oh shit you've lost yours totally?
Jemma (PS0BL) [74] Yeah it was nicked.
              [75] Stolen.
              [76] Gone.
Gill (PS0BK)  [77] Oh you would have thought though they'd send it back.
              [78] Do you know what I mean?
              [79] I mean that's so stupid not to send it back.
Nancy (PS0BS) [80] Where was it stolen from?
Jemma (PS0BL) [81] Well these, these these are the kind of people who nicked my
              address book which was sitting on my seat and which looked quite
              nice which wasn't in my bag, they nicked that. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [82] Where was it stolen from?
Gill (PS0BK)  [83] But that's so pointless cos it's got all the addresses, your
              addresses in it.
Jemma (PS0BL) [84] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [85] It's such a tossy, you sure it wasn't in the bag?
Jemma (PS0BL) [86] Yeah I'm absolutely positive, I remember leaving it on the
              seat.
              [87] It was stolen from my car, my car was broken into [...] ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [88] How long did you actually leave the er ... how long were you
              away from the car for?
Jemma (PS0BL) [89] Erm well it happened some time between about ... two and six
              [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [90] It was a bit silly to leave your bag on the front seat
              though.
Jemma (PS0BL) [91] Yeah but we were sitting in a er we were in a cul-de-sac in
              a nice area
Gill (PS0BK)  [92] Yeah you don't think do you?
              [93] You don't think at all.
              [94] Mind you, my mum was telling me, on Christmas day, right,
              Christmas day!
              [95] Erm ... you know that Georgian house on my road on th my
              side of the road, up the road?
              [96] Looks way out of place.
              [97] Well not as way out of place as a British Telecom building
              would look but, it looks quite [laughing] erm looks quite out of
              place [] , but erm this massive great obnoxious Georgian building
              ... erm ... was broken into on Christmas morning right?
              [98] They picked the lock [laughing] on the house, the front
              fucking door [] .
              [99] All the people were in bed in the house, woke up in the
              morning, the front door was wide open, the video and T V had
              gone, and the stereo.
              [100] ... And so they pi they we came into the house when
              everyone was asleep.
              [101] That would freak me out so much, you just wouldn't feel
              safe in your house ever again would you?
              [102] Cos equally a rapist could pick the lock and come in and,
              and ... do you know what I mean?
              [103] Er you'd just feel ... I couldn't believe that, thought
              fucking hell.
              [104] So my dad's having all the locks changed.
              [105] [laugh] Stepped up the security in our house.
              [106] Outrageous.
Nancy (PS0BS) [107] [...] stepdad?
Gill (PS0BK)  [108] No stepped up the security [laughing] in the house [] .
Nancy (PS0BS) [109] [laughing] Oh []
Gill (PS0BK)  [110] Hey Nance, Nance, Nance, Nance, you know you were telling
              me that you thought someone had died ... at work?
              [111] ... I, I [laughing] sort of heard [] Debbie and Chris
              talking the other day, and I might have got it totally mixed up,
              but I reckon, I heard Chris saying ... that, well basically what
              I gathered was that Andy might have a different father to Chris
              and it was Andy's father that's died, right?
              [112] Cos Chris was saying things like oh his, yeah he's been to
              the funeral and erm he's all of a sudden found that he's got
              loads of cousins he didn't even know about.
Nancy (PS0BS) [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [113] What, so he did, he didn't [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [114] But I wonder if I wonder if Chris and Andy, cos Chris and
              Andy's half brother is Steven who's Debbie's husband, I'm
              wondering if they knew that ... they had different fathers.
              [115] Cos they don't call each other they're half brothers. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [116] Maybe ... yeah.
              [117] Well Andy's, look how Andy's got ginger hair.
Gill (PS0BK)  [118] Mm.
              [119] Chris is dark and sort of like totally, doesn't look
              anything like Andy.
              [120] Not even one similarity.
              [121] Totally like
Jemma (PS0BL) [122] And what, they're supposed to be half brothers are they?
Gill (PS0BK)  [123] No they're supposed to be brothers.
Nancy (PS0BS) [124] But I reckon they've probably lived like brothers from a
              young age.
              [125] Cos look how much
Gill (PS0BK)  [126] Yeah, oh yeah.
Nancy (PS0BS) [127] older Chris is than Andy as well.
              [128] ... Well he isn't that much but he's a good nine years.
              [129] Nine, ten, eleven years older than Andy.
Gill (PS0BK)  [130] So maybe they did know. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [131] Yeah I reckon they did.
Gill (PS0BK)  [132] And just sort of like did, just called people
Nancy (PS0BS) [133] Or Andy may er Andy, Andy may be adopted or something like
              that.
Gill (PS0BK)  [134] Yeah maybe.
              [135] But it's just strange that Steven's called their half
              brother and they're called brothers.
              [136] Do you know what I mean?
Nancy (PS0BS) [137] Well maybe, yeah, but maybe Steven ... is er is a half
              brother through a third marriage erm ... at a later stage to when
              they ... his mum er they're er Chris' mum may have remarried, who
              Andy calls mum, erm remarried when Andy was ... you know, fifteen
              and Chris was twenty five and then they, and Steve was o old as
              well, Steve was quite ... however o however how old Steve is, he
              [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [138] So then he'd be a stepbrother.
Nancy (PS0BS) [139] Oh.
              [140] [...] mixed up.
Gill (PS0BK)  [141] [laugh] Maybe we don't know.
              [142] Maybe we're just gossiping. [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [143] Maybe we're just damn fucking nosy.
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [laugh]
Gill (PS0BK)  [144] It was funny cos I could hear them talking and I was really
              sort of like
Nancy (PS0BS) [145] So obviously then, I reckon it must be his dad ... and
              that's obviously why Andy [...] saying oh look your dad's died
              [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [146] Yeah.
Nancy (PS0BS) [147] Cos Chris doesn't seem that bothered really, does he?
              [148] Maybe he wouldn't know him.
Gill (PS0BK)  [149] Mm.
              [150] Maybe Andy didn't know him.
              [151] ... And he just went because it was ... his father's
              funeral.
              [152] ... But then why would he have to go to the morgue for an
              identification, he wouldn't know what he looked like.
              [153] ... Maybe he's next of kin. ... [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [...] [laugh]
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [154] [laughing] Stop it [] . [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [155] Aren't we nosy though?
              [156] Aren't I nosy I mean. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [157] I better go [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [158] Right, good luck.
Nancy (PS0BS) [159] Yeah. [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [160] You bloody lay into them.

              [168] [laugh] ... I love this song.
              [169] ... I haven't listened to it for ages. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [170] [...] what I've nicked today?
Gill (PS0BK)  [171] Oh yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [172] Not bad eh?
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh] ...

Gill (PS0BK)  [174] [singing] He said I'm not fighting for you any more and the
              queen as she seen his face some days before [] ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [175] Jane wants me to send her a postcard. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [176] [singing] up here on the hill []
Jemma (PS0BL) [177] [...] lot of people I work with actually.

Gill (PS0BK)  [180] Who you just got on with.
Jemma (PS0BL) [181] really, really friendly with me, yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [182] The thing is though there's so many people who are sending
              postcards won't send her one.

              [230] The thing about ... thing about if you go down the south of
              the islands they're so nice, it's very hard.
Gill (PS0BK)  [231] No I think we should do the north first, then go down to
              the south to meet Frank and Dave.
Jemma (PS0BL) [232] Yeah, yeah I, I reckon that's a good idea. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [233] [singing] order was heard ... still waiting for her word []
              ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [234] And what was it [...] asked [...] to do?
              [235] Mm [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [236] Yeah.
              [237] I'll get mine done er after work tomorrow. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [238] We need quite a few don't we? [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [239] Three. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [240] Three for each don't we? ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [241] Oh I don't know, I think, I don't know.
Jemma (PS0BL) [242] Well three for the [...] application forms, that's one
              [...] oh right, making three.
              [243] ... Not a bad little list to do is it?
              [244] ... I might do some shopping as well, get some food. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [245] It's a bit stupid to have all these doors open you know?
              [246] Thing is we want to listen to, shall we go in my room?
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
*** 2 (Tape 055402) ***
Gill (PS0BK)  [247] [sigh] ... I'm really, really, really changed dramatically
              from not eating very much to scoffing my face at every single
              available opportunity.
Jemma (PS0BL) [248] Really?
Gill (PS0BK)  [249] Mm.
Jemma (PS0BL) [250] I'm alright [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [251] It might just be today though.
              [252] ... Can I have a light? ... [singing] left it all [...] []
              Do you still wanna go to the pub later?
Jemma (PS0BL) [253] I think, yeah, [...] ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [254] Twenty to nine now, shall we just go for last orders or
              something?
              [255] ... Go about ten or something.
              [256] ... Yeah Judy seems to be finding her job very boring
              actually.
              [257] ... [singing] [...] [] . Apparently she's just pumping in
              er ... like addresses and stuff into a computer.
              [258] They're graduates. [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [259] [...] quite good today actually, we've got erm Pat ... who
              is like erm ... who is, I think she's like the personnel in
              charge of I know that she's in charge of personnel there
Gill (PS0BK)  [260] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [261] she's quite good and she said well you're intelligent, you
              can do this for me and she had me doing this like [...] phone
              calls ringing people up and
Gill (PS0BK)  [262] Mm.
Jemma (PS0BL) [263] [...] and
Gill (PS0BK)  [264] Brilliant.
Jemma (PS0BL) [265] And I, it was good, I was actually [...] ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [266] Actually recognized.
Jemma (PS0BL) [267] that I did have a brain and I was capable of doing things
              even though it was
Gill (PS0BK)  [268] Yeah. [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [269] very, anyone could do it, you know
Gill (PS0BK)  [270] Well thing is that I mean a lot of these jobs, I mean er
              yeah ... they recognize that, I mean a lot of them ... yo they
              think you're as thick as shit and treat you like you're as thick
              as shit just because you're doing a thick as shit job ... but you
              know they can't necessarily give you more
Jemma (PS0BL) [271] Yeah I [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [272] more er ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [273] they can't necessarily give you more er ... erm ...
              [laughing] don't suppose you want to get me a cloth do you [] ?
              [274] ... More erm responsibility cos you have to be trained for
              it.
              [275] Or know what you're talking about on the phone maybe.
              [276] ... Lovely, thank you sweetheart.
              [277] Ah! [laugh] ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [278] [...] the fact that she's, she's intelligent as well erm
              she, you know, she's gonna s she knew that I didn't know what I
              was talking about so she said right you look,yo you look er you,
              you ask them about this, this, this and this and they might say
              this to you, so I knew what, if they asked me, I knew what I was
              talking about rather than
Gill (PS0BK)  [279] Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [280] being completely lost. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [281] Mm.
              [282] ... [singing] Yes she's gone, gone, gone []
Jemma (PS0BL) [283] The only thing is my back has started to go.
Gill (PS0BK)  [284] Why?
              [285] Slouching around?
Jemma (PS0BL) [286] Sitting at a desk.
              [287] It really is hurting a lot.
              [288] ... Never mind. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [289] So how much money will you get for the three days' work
              you've done?
Jemma (PS0BL) [290] Erm ... I'm not sure really.
              [291] Wait and see.
Gill (PS0BK)  [292] Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [293] [...] going to cash my giro today as well you can only cash
              it at one of your local [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [294] How much is it?
Jemma (PS0BL) [295] Sixty three quid.
              [296] ... But that's for two weeks.
Gill (PS0BK)  [297] Oh yeah, yeah I suppose so.
Jemma (PS0BL) [298] Cos it comes in, it seems a lot cos it always comes in one
              big lump.
Gill (PS0BK)  [299] Did you sort out Housing Benefit ever?
Jemma (PS0BL) [300] I sent it off but I haven't had anything back.
              [301] I sent my rent book off as proof of the fact that I was ...
              of what the rent was
Gill (PS0BK)  [302] Cos you might get a big fat juicy cheque for that.
Jemma (PS0BL) [303] The thing is, I was thinking right, is it'll probably
              happen when I'm, if [...] come through, it'll probably happen
              while I'm away.
Gill (PS0BK)  [304] Yeah but what you could do, Nancy will be really
              responsible about things like that, you can say to her if a big
              fat Housing Benefit cheque comes for me cash it and put it in my
              bank.
Jemma (PS0BL) [305] But will she be able to do that?
              [306] Won't I have to countersign it or something first?
Gill (PS0BK)  [307] No. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [308] Yeah but I think on the back of the [...] giro there's a
              thing where you have to countersign it saying I authorize so and
              so
Gill (PS0BK)  [309] Mm.
              [310] ... Get her to forge it.
              [311] ... They won't ask for any, any ... do you know did you,
              were you there when Darrel was talking about that woman in the
              Post Office?
              [312] Cos I w he was, he was in the Post Office one day and he
              saw this old woman and she'd just cashed all her giros and this
              bloke just nicked it ... in the Post Office.
              [313] Just grabbed her handbag and ran off with it.
              [314] ... Sort of stood there watching her cash the giros and
              then nicked her money.
              [315] ... An old woman.
              [316] I mean she's probably not got any money.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [317] I think that's outrageous.
              [318] ... Well I don't mind, well I mean this is a horrible thing
              to say but I don't necessarily mind people robbing from the rich
              ... but when it's poor people robbing from the poor, it's a
              really wank off, really wanky thing to do, you know, I just think
              it's disgusting. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [319] Well you can understand it when somebody poor robs someone
              who's rich, but when someone who's poor robs someone else who's
              poor it's just ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [320] I've written Darrel a letter you know and er
Jemma (PS0BL) [321] Have you posted it?
Gill (PS0BK)  [322] No it's down there, and in it ... er I wrote it last night
              actually when I was feeling pretty fucked off so it's probably a
              bit out of order but I wrote to him and said erm ... tt Josh has
              been round this evening asking questions about what's happened
              with his money ... erm ... and I think you're really out of
              order. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [323] Thing is that he's in er he's in such a pickle, he's doing
              what ... I can understand him doing it cos I'd do it, he's kind
              of just putting it off ... having to sort it out.
              [324] ... But I said to him look Josh isn't exactly well off at
              the moment, he needs the money or ... what he bought so ...
              [sigh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [325] [...] cos I mean I get ... [...] er talked about it and I
              know about it and that kind of thing and I [...] that Darrel
              [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [326] I'm not saying anything because it's none of my business as
              far as I'm concerned
Jemma (PS0BL) [327] No.
Gill (PS0BK)  [328] it's between them.
Jemma (PS0BL) [329] Yeah. [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [330] No. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [331] I mean Josh is alright, I mean Josh will understand, if
              Darrel said to him look, this is the situation, Josh would
              understand ... to a certain extent.
Gill (PS0BK)  [332] Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [333] I'd quite like to know how much ... like how,wheth what
              Darrel actually ran away from, I mean he owes so many people
              money.
Jemma (PS0BL) [334] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [335] Well not,n actually that's not necessarily true, he owes
              his land he owed his landlord loads of money, I'm not sure
              whether he actually got round to paying him off.
              [336] [sniff] ... What would you feel like listening to? ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [337] Erm ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [338] Something in the same vein?
Jemma (PS0BL) [339] Yeah. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [340] I know what I feel like listening to, it's just whether or
              not I can find it.
              [341] ... I quite lis like [...] Tapestry.
              [342] ... Carole King.
Jemma (PS0BL) [343] Yeah. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [344] Mm it's a case of remembering what it's on the side o aha!
              [345] ... Have you done that, I, I saw a tape in your room the
              other day, erm ... lovingly compiled in Berkshire ... [laugh] it
              was like a ... it was like a tape in a box like
Jemma (PS0BL) [346] That's Josh's.
Gill (PS0BK)  [347] Oh what, who taped him that?
Jemma (PS0BL) [348] Erm oh I dunno, a friend of his.
              [349] ... Erm Martin [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [350] What sort of music is it?
              [351] Oh really?
              [352] He's the one that got busted at the [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [353] erm ... it's, it's a kind of ... dancey kind of ... hate
              the word but raveish type music but a bit mellower.
Gill (PS0BK)  [354] Mm.
              [355] ... Bit like that System Seven tape?
              [356] ... Of Simon's.
Jemma (PS0BL) [357] Yes, yeah.
              [358] Oh did you, you recorded that did you?
Gill (PS0BK)  [359] Mm.
              [360] ... It's good actually, very good.
              [361] ... I really like it. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [362] Yeah.
              [363] I'm, I'm gonna go up and see him before we go. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [364] Simon?
Jemma (PS0BL) [365] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [366] I am wondering actually what I should do about Helen.
              [367] See now I, I would like to speak to her to check she's
              alright.
              [368] But in doing so I'd be telling her that I knew that it had
              happened and therefore that Simon had talked to me.
              [369] ... Or that I would have to say oh Simon told me, and I
              don't think that is a very good thing to do really.
              [370] ... Cos she'd ask me how I'd know.
              [371] It wouldn't be a case of oh Si Helen I've heard on the
              grapevine ... would it?
              [372] ... Tell you who I might phone up in a minute [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [373] Yeah?
Gill (PS0BK)  [374] Vanessa.
              [375] ... And not
Jemma (PS0BL) [376] Vanessa and Dangerous?
Gill (PS0BK)  [377] [laughing] And Dangerous yeah [] .
              [378] And not tell her that I know and wait for her to tell me.
Jemma (PS0BL) [379] That ... what are, are they, what are the, the you know
Gill (PS0BK)  [380] [laughing] They're fucking engaged [] ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [381] Oh she didn't!
              [382] What [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [383] [laugh] That's what I mean.
              [384] But if she says something to me about it ... I mean if she
              says something to me about it I'm not gonna act surprised I'll
              say oh yeah I've heard. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [385] Who told you?
Gill (PS0BK)  [386] Liz.
              [387] ... What should I s er what should, would you be honest?
              [388] ... I mean I'm not gonna say look I hate Dangerous, I think
              he's an absolute wanker and how can you marry someone who's
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [389] uses the nickname Dangerous for fuck's sake.
Jemma (PS0BL) [390] cos you could, I mean if if she asked you about it, you
              know, you could just say well ... honestly I'm quite, I didn't
              think you were the kind of person who'd go for ... I know, I know
              that ... thing is I mean I can see, I can see that she's going
              for him because ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [391] What I might actually do is say well I re if she does
              actually a I mean what she'll probably do is say ... oh have you
              heard about me and Dangerous, and I'll say yes.
              [392] And she'll say ... and that's all I'll say.
              [393] And I'll say yeah, yeah I've heard.
              [394] ... And then if she says something like well what do you
              think I might just say well ... I haven't really talked to you
              very much about the way that you feel about Dangerous so I don't
              really know ... erm ... Dangerous, what a fucking stupid name!
              [395] And then if she says well ... and, and then I might say but
              I just would imagine that you'd have a lot more to do with your
              life before you thought about settling down and getting engaged
              to someone.
Jemma (PS0BL) [396] And also someone like him because I mean, I mean er
              obviously he, he seemed like a, I mean I'm sure he's a nice guy
              ... er I mean when it comes down to it he probably is a nice guy,
              he's probably nice to her but it's just the fact that he is so
              restricted in his views and ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [397] It's also the fact that I know for a fact, I know for a
              fact that she's very frightened of his temper when it happens.
              [398] I know she is.
              [399] Cos she's talked to me about it.
              [400] I mean there's been a couple of times that he's really lost
              his temper with her and erm ... and, and really flown off the
              handle, badly.
              [401] And I reckon that he's the sort of person who would turn
              into someone that would hit someo hit his ... his woman, because
              he takes her for granted enough as it is, and that, I reckon
              that's how wife battering starts because the husband starts
              taking the woman for granted so much
Jemma (PS0BL) [402] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [403] that, then starts taking their anger out on her
Jemma (PS0BL) [404] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [405] and, and ... if she's already scared of his temper and
              they've not even ... lived together, well they have lived
              together for quite a while actually ... so I mean it's not like
              they don't know each other but ... once they're married and
              they've been married for a couple of years I reckon, and he
              starts thinking of her more as a possession sort of thing ... I
              can, I can really imagine
Jemma (PS0BL) [406] I can just imagine
Gill (PS0BK)  [407] him starting hitting her.
Jemma (PS0BL) [408] I can imagine him being one of these, these, these er
              husbands who just want, who want, who will want to go out with
              the lads ... on his night out and will get, you know, he's a,
              he's ste I can imagine him being one of these stereotypical
              husbands who goes out [...] , gets pissed, comes back [...] , who
              wants the dinner on the table and
Gill (PS0BK)  [409] Mm.
              [410] I can imagine it going in that dir yeah that way.
              [411] It won't be like it for a couple of years.
              [412] ... But he's not the sort of person that'll say ah ... yeah
              we've been doing this for a little while, why don't we just take
              off and go somewhere and fuck it, fuck it, let's just go and do
              something together ... he's the sort of person that they would
              settle down into this safe little life and, which wouldn't
              actually be that safe for Vanessa, it'd be very ... very ... you
              know, much what Dangerous wants to do.
              [413] But I, I can understand why she'd want to marry, why she'd
              want to do that, cos she hasn't ha well had an awful lot of ...
              brilliant times in her life since she left Nigeria.
              [414] Nigeria was what kept her alive.
              [415] She hated living in England.
              [416] ... But I don't understand why she hasn't just earned the
              money and gone off somewhere.
Jemma (PS0BL) [417] Yeah but they're gonna, it's such a hard thing to do.
              [418] I mean
Gill (PS0BK)  [419] Especially by yourself, she doesn't know anyone she could
              do it with.
Jemma (PS0BL) [420] Yeah and, and if you could, I mean the thing is, if you're,
              if er, if we didn't have each other to go off with ... erm it
              would have made everything for us a lot different, I mean okay
              we're lucky we're in a situation where we do know a lot of people
              who are, who are like- minded
Gill (PS0BK)  [421] Mm.
Jemma (PS0BL) [422] and we could maybe find someone else to go off and do it
              with
Gill (PS0BK)  [423] Though it would be a case of finding someone else to go off
              with and not just sort of like, I mean we mentioned it years ago.
Jemma (PS0BL) [424] Well I remember when we first met we wanted to go and do a
              dissertation together didn't we?
Gill (PS0BK)  [425] [laughing] Yeah!
              [426] Oh can you remember [] walking around the streets of France
              ... saying yeah let's go and do our dissertation somewhere.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [427] Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [428] Funny isn't it how we meet people, how you can know them
              for ages then you just sort of talk to them, or once you start
              talking to them you realize that you've got
Gill (PS0BK)  [429] An awful lot in common, yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [430] [...] in common.
              [431] So much in common.
Gill (PS0BK)  [432] Yeah.
              [433] ... Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [434] You know I'm, in some ways you know I'm so glad I've never
              had like ... well before you know it used to bother me that I'd
              never had a long-term relationship and that ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [435] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [436] erm ... because it's something other people have and now,
              now I'm quite happy with myself and ... feel a lot more sure
              about the way I think and what I want
Gill (PS0BK)  [437] Mm.
Jemma (PS0BL) [438] erm it doesn't bother me in the slightest because I know
              that ... I would prefer maybe to be on my own ... than to be
              [...] restricted by someone.
Gill (PS0BK)  [439] Yeah because the other thing is that although ... erm ...
              you might have all these sort of high flying ideas about what you
              wanna do and you don't actually feel tied down by a relationship,
              actually ... you do live your life thinking well ... can't really
              do that because I wanna be with him.
Jemma (PS0BL) [440] Mm. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [441] It's just a different choice.
              [442] ... You might not necessarily feel stuck in it, but it does
              make you stick around.
Jemma (PS0BL) [443] You can get, you get yeah you can get tied into it without
              realizing it.
Gill (PS0BK)  [444] Yeah.
              [445] ... Yeah definitely.
              [446] It just makes leaving that much harder.
Jemma (PS0BL) [447] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [448] It makes [...] like doing anything that much harder.
Jemma (PS0BL) [449] Yeah. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [450] Definitely.
              [451] [sniff] ... Mm.
              [452] ... [laughing] What [] ? ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [453] No I was just worrying that I always thought that I would
              never ever like ... come across anyone who I thought that I can
              even vaguely click with but I just realized that I can ... and
              it's just quite a nice feeling. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [454] Have you er have you spoken to Pete yet?
Jemma (PS0BL) [455] No I've been thinking about that actually, I must ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [456] [laughing] You've been saying it for so long [] .
Jemma (PS0BL) [457] Well I know, I b I, I was thinking before I'll wr I, I
              should write to him but now I, I'm ... I'm getting towards the
              stage where I want to write to him.
Gill (PS0BK)  [458] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [459] Cos you can't just write to someone, you have to want to
              write to them really.
Gill (PS0BK)  [460] Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [461] Cos I'm thinking about it now, I mean ... it was totally my
              fault, it was, cos I wanted a relationship [...] he seemed, he
              seemed
Gill (PS0BK)  [462] Alright.
Jemma (PS0BL) [463] he seemed like, he, he, I looked at him, right, and I
              looked at everything about him and I thought ... that is the kind
              of guy I want, which is true, but it wasn't the guy. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [464] Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [465] And he never, we never really ... we never, we never
              discussed things, you know, we talked, we never discussed things
              really.
Gill (PS0BK)  [466] Mm.
Jemma (PS0BL) [467] I never felt like ... I never felt animated talking to him,
              you know if you talk to someone you get really, you really get
              animated and [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [468] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [469] we always, we always get like, you know, a buzz off it or
              whatever but
Gill (PS0BK)  [470] Oh you do get a total buzz off it
Jemma (PS0BL) [471] Yeah
Gill (PS0BK)  [472] I reckon.
              [473] Especially if it, especially if it's someone that you're
              snogging ... as well.
              [474] ... I do love this tape, I really love it.
              [475] Janet gave it to Frank for Christmas.
              [476] ... Ha! [whistling] ... [singing] make it ... and I just
              can't take it []
Jemma (PS0BL) [477] No I'm so, I'm so lucky I've met the people I've met, you
              know, so lucky.
              [478] ... I really am.
Gill (PS0BK)  [479] Yeah, I often think that actually.
Jemma (PS0BL) [480] I really am realizing it now.
              [481] And if I hadn't met the people I've met, I think I'd've
              been a very frustrated person ... cos erm, even though you can
              think of something,un unless, if you have other people you can
              go, if you say to somebody you could say, oh God, you know let's
              do this and this and this, or I think, really think this or this
              and someone else goes ... yes I do
Gill (PS0BK)  [482] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [483] as well, I agree with you
Gill (PS0BK)  [484] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [485] you're like ... I am right, even though you know you are
              it's like reinforcing your ideas.
Gill (PS0BK)  [486] Also it's kind of er ... even if you er sort of different
              people don't, I mean a lot of people don't discuss as much as we
              do.
              [487] ... I've really, really, really realized that.
              [488] Most people don't actually ... go into things as deeply as
              we do.
              [489] We've er oh it's, it's all to do with this sort of special
              thing that we found.
Jemma (PS0BL) [490] It is, it is true though.
Gill (PS0BK)  [491] Definitely.
              [492] I don't, I don't know anybody ... that I, I've ... I mean
              I've never seen a group, I mean you see it on films every
              [laughing] now and then you know [] , a group of people that
              really, really spark one another off, like in The Big Chill and
              all the things like that ... but erm ... I've never seen it
              before.
              [493] Not, not to the extent of what we've got.
              [494] ... Not as permanent.
Jemma (PS0BL) [495] My brother actually, Michael has been very good ... he
              still sees erm ... [...] cos he's always friends with [...] ...
              and they're really good friends.
              [496] I mean it's not, it's not the same kind of thing that we've
              got, it's a different kind of relationship cos he's a different
              kind of person
Gill (PS0BK)  [497] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [498] but erm it's good that he kept up with everyone, they are
              really good friends and he can really rely on them, they're all
              really decent
Gill (PS0BK)  [499] Mm.
Jemma (PS0BL) [500] really decent people, all, all decent blokes. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [501] That's a really lovely jumper, is it new?
Jemma (PS0BL) [502] Erm
Gill (PS0BK)  [503] Have I seen it before?
              [504] ... I don't think I have.
Jemma (PS0BL) [505] I got it in the summer ... erm but then for some reason I
              decided I didn't like it.
              [506] I it's nice but it's a bit, it's a bit erm impractical, it
              looks, it look it's not as thick as it looks, [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [507] Oh really?
Jemma (PS0BL) [508] I mean
Gill (PS0BK)  [509] It looks very thick.
Jemma (PS0BL) [510] Well feel it, it's not. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [511] Oh it's cos it's this new velvety stuff isn't it?
Jemma (PS0BL) [512] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [513] [laughing] Oh this new velvety stuff [] . ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [514] [...] talking about things and things like [...] everything
              from [...] the universe erm
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [515] [laughing] we, because we covered it, and er []
Gill (PS0BK)  [516] He's fucking mad, Simon, he always makes people think and
              talk about these mad things that they probably wouldn't talk
              about that often.
Jemma (PS0BL) [517] Yeah.
              [518] He's fucking excellent, he sparked me off [...] ... erm ...
              shit what was I saying? [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [519] Oh I don't know, I can't really remember.
Jemma (PS0BL) [520] Rewind the tape.
              [521] [laughing] Rewind the tape [laugh] rewind the tape, let me
              hear it [laugh] I'll remember []

                                     Bournemouth, then we went to Winchester
                                     and then we went to Cheltenham, [...] .

                                     [526] We went to see this bloke called Tom

                                     in Cheltenham, he's called Tom .

Jim (PS0BT)                          [535] Oh.
Gill (PS0BK)                         [536] But you must have met him, he's been
                                     up here a couple of times.
                                     [537] ... You might have met him vaguely.
                                     [538] Erm ... but er
Jim (PS0BT)                          [539] It sounds like a very familiar name,
                                     ask him if erm ... ask him if er any of
                                     his relations went to Cheltenham Junior
                                     School cos there was a bloke with that

                                     school at the college, and it's not a very
                                     erm ... common name [...]
Gill (PS0BK)                         [542] Did you know a bloke called er ...
                                     you didn't go to the kind of big school
                                     though?
Jim (PS0BT)                          [543] No, but I might have known him
                                     because he might have been a junior.
Gill (PS0BK)                         [544] What big school did you go to?
Jim (PS0BT)                          [...]
Gill (PS0BK)                         [545] [laughing] Do you know a bloke

                                     [551] Is there a photo of him in there
                                     somewhere?
Gill (PS0BK)                         [552] There's a photo of him in there.
Jim (PS0BT)                          [553] Yeah, I thought that was him.
                                     [554] I looked at it the other day and I
                                     thought I must remember to ask.
                                     [555] I didn't know him very well but,
                                     yeah, anyway ... [laugh] he erm
Gill (PS0BK)                         [556] Oh!

                                     Nick , not on the same times but oh ... I
                                     went out with her after he went out with
                                     her.
Gill (PS0BK)                         [560] Oh what at school?
Jim (PS0BT)                          [561] This, this man-eating girl.
Gill (PS0BK)                         [562] What was her name?
Jim (PS0BT)                          [563] Helena .
                                     [564] ... I can't er I dunno actually, I'm
                                     not sure if it was him, he had a friend
                                     called Rob ... and he was a blond
                                     beautiful boy as well and they were both
                                     blond beautiful boys together sort of
                                     thing
Gill (PS0BK)                         [565] Yeah.
Jim (PS0BT)                          [566] so it might've been Rob that went
                                     out with her, [...] but I dunno.
                                     [567] But I didn't know him very well but
                                     er he was, you know, seemed alright like

Unknown speaker (KC7PSUNK)           [989] Oh no this isn't drug induced at all

                                     [990] No!
Gill (PS0BK)                         [991] [laugh] ... No maybe not.

Unknown speaker (KC7PSUNK)           [1005] Ah ah!
Gill (PS0BK)                         [1006] Well there's not a lot of point
                                     having it now
Unknown speaker (KC7PSUNK)           [1007] Really?
Gill (PS0BK)                         [1008] really cos there's such a cross
                                     section of conversation going on, it's
                                     really funny there's this bit in the car
                                     when we went outside with the mike and ...
                                     on a ... at Claire's party and er ... erm

                                     speakers were up here and there's just a
                                     whaaaaaaa this massive rabble going on.
                                     [1009] Really funny.
Unknown speaker (KC7PSUNK)           [1010] I told you [...] anyway cos I got,
                                     I got a bloody [...] Erm so we were

Nancy (PS0BS)                        [1013] Oh when are they gonna collect it?
Gill (PS0BK)                         [1014] Next Friday.
                                     [1015] Friday evening.
                                     [1016] This Friday coming up, yeah.
                                     [1017] Yeah.
                                     [1018] ... It'll be quite funny.
Nancy (PS0BS)                        [1019] Mm.
                                     [1020] ... Can you imagine listening to
                                     all the tapes? [...]
Unknown speaker (KC7PSUNK)           [1021] It can't be that much of a great
                                     thing because I've got, I've got to go to
                                     a twenty first on Saturday.
                                     [1022] Do you wanna come?
                                     [1023] ... [...] Yeah.
                                     [1024] ... Erm ... some girl.
Gill (PS0BK)                         [1025] Well the, the first ones that we
                                     made going down from here, the car's
                                     making a racket, the stereo's like on full
                                     [laughing] blast [] you can't hear
                                     anything we're saying at all.
                                     [1026] Really.
                                     [1027] I mean occasionally there's a break
                                     where we'd sort of get this stupid
                                     laughter and stuff but most of it most of
                                     it is just sort of like ...
Unknown speaker (KC7PSUNK)           [1028] No but it'll be quite funny.
                                     [1029] It means we can get really pissed
                                     and you can charm them all [phonecall
                                     ends] .
Gill (PS0BK)                         [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS)                        [1030] So do you think you're go you're
                                     [...] tomorrow after ten [...] ?
*** 5 (Tape 055405) ***
Gill (PS0BK)  [1031] [singing] [...] asleep by his side [] Erm ... how's he
              affording to go to?
              [1032] ... I would imagine that he's getting help off his
              parents, to be honest.
              [1033] I don't know.
              [1034] I think he's da oh his dad's paying for everything first.
              [1035] What's the date today, the thirteenth?
              [1036] ... Yeah.
              [1037] ... Erm ... I think he's got his dad to pay off his ...
              [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1038] I suppose if you think about it his parents probably think
              it's probably good to get him out of London and get him doing
              something.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1039] Yes because at the moment he's just, I mean he's ... I
              mean he hasn't, I mean he had that job in Debenhams and that's it
              isn't it really?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1040] Yeah.
              [1041] ... So I guess I have done better than some people.
              [laugh]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1042] Mm Erm ... yes so he was just saying that, you know, the
              only night he's really been out since New Year's Eve was last
              Wednesday, he's just been in the whole time.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1043] Well
Gill (PS0BK)  [1044] He hasn't got any money or anything.
              [1045] I feel a bit, you know, sad.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1046] Yeah, and also he lives so far out and he was saying you
              know, Julie's up in er in Birmingham, Andy 's up in Birmingham,
              he's had no one to see, Eileen's come back up to Birmingham ...
              [...] he sees quite a lot of and er I think he's just a bit
              lonely.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1047] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1048] [laugh] Erm ... but I think it cheered him up saying oh do
              you wanna come to a party at the weekend sort of thing.
              [1049] That's gonna be really nice I think.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1050] I think I might come down actually.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1051] Yeah do that.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1052] I can't [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1053] Mm.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1054] so I may as well.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1055] It should be quite a, I mean it'll be a funny party and
              it'll just be ... it'll be good music.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1056] Well it would be nice, be nice to meet different meeting
              different people as well
Gill (PS0BK)  [1057] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1058] [...] and having, it's a scene, it's a crowd and
Gill (PS0BK)  [1059] And also it'll be good to go to a party in London where it
              isn't like totally drug oriented, there won't be any drugs
Jemma (PS0BL) [1060] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1061] there at all, it'll be just drinks and
Jemma (PS0BL) [1062] Really?
              [1063] I'm
Gill (PS0BK)  [1064] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1065] cos I'm, I'm, I think I'm going through a bit of a a
              slight
Gill (PS0BK)  [1066] Off it?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1067] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1068] I don't want anything to do with it really at the moment.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1069] [...] like a bit not pointless, well it, it's just that I
              don't really, I'm not getting anything from it at the moment so
Gill (PS0BK)  [1070] Yeah, same here.
              [1071] But I mean that's just the way it goes, you know, and it's
              good to have, you've got to have breaks.
              [1072] You can't just
Jemma (PS0BL) [1073] You'd have to be mad [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1074] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1075] really.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1076] But I s I know what you mean, I'm quite happy not to at
              the moment as well.
              [1077] ... Erm ... but I think it'll be a nice party and the
              music will be brilliant.
              [1078] This guy called Mark that erm ... tt that Frank and Janet
              ... know very well, he's a really very good D J indeed, you know
              he's, Janet's got a tape that he's made and he's got, using three
              decks at a time and stuff, he's very good.
              [1079] And it'll be really good sort of like funk ... go with,
              you know, sort of soully music and so it'll be really nice I
              think.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1080] Think it'll end up a bop?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1081] Yeah.
              [1082] ... And also my friend [...] is gonna come.
              [1083] I invited her last ... oh it was the last time I spoke to
              her.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1084] Good.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1085] And that'll be good for her as well cos it'll mean that
              she'll meet [...] and Craig
Jemma (PS0BL) [1086] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1087] and maybe she'll have someone to visit in London cos she
              hasn't really got any friends in London.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1088] Whereabouts does she live in London?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1089] Tt I think she lives in ... Clapham or something.
              [1090] ... [singing] the rain cries a little pity ... of one more
              forgotten hero []
Jemma (PS0BL) [1091] Was Nancy gonna come down do you think?
              [1092] Or is she gonna stay here?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1093] I don't know, I haven't asked her if she wants to come yet
              really I don't think.
              [1094] ... Oh no her sister and all her mates are coming up this
              weekend.
              [1095] ... [singing] and say for you [] It'd be quite good, it'd
              be quite good to be here actually but ... just to meet them but
              ... tt nah ... [singing] show you something []
Jemma (PS0BL) [1096] Yeah [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1097] Mm.
              [1098] ... Simon's just brilliant isn't he really?
              [1099] He just ... he can talk to anybody.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1100] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1101] Like this girl Tracey that he got on with really well, I
              mean I, I'd really disliked her, this girl that Claire knows.
              [1102] And when I arrived at this party, she is totally unsubtle
              ... and sometimes very rude, you know, and er ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [1103] Yeah well the thing about Simon that's excellent is that
              he just accepts people for what they are and he doesn't judge
              people
Gill (PS0BK)  [1104] Yeah.
              [1105] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1106] which means if you don't judge people then, you know ...
              it's just so much easier.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1107] Mm.
              [1108] ... Yeah. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [1109] I wonder how he's gonna find it not being with her.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1110] He's gonna find it hard as well I think, but on the other
              hand they haven't been communicating at all, you know, it's not
              like ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [1111] No it's not as if it happened suddenly.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1112] Mm.
              [1113] ... Yeah.
              [1114] I think Helen's gonna find it very difficult though.
              [1115] ... Just because even though they don't talk very much any
              more and stuff and he probably hasn't been spending much time
              with her,
Jemma (PS0BL) [1116] That he's been [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1117] the thought that he's been there and it's ... yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1118] Well I mean they're engaged for God's sake, you know.
              [1119] She thought they were gonna get married.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1120] Yeah.
              [1121] ... [singing] In the jingle jangle [] ... Yeah.
              [1122] ... Is Andy gone out?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1123] He's gone up to smoke I think.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1124] Oh has he?
              [1125] Shall we sit in my room?
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1126] Music.
              [1127] ... And that way you don't have to just sort of
Jemma (PS0BL) [1128] Do you know whose button this is?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1129] No.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1130] [...] ... [music] Yeah I think, I think Dave was, I think
              Dave felt a bit nostalgic coming back actually.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1131] Do you?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1132] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1133] What, a bit sad?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1134] Well he, he did when he came in here, he picked up his
              [...] and he looked round and it was all very different and then
              [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1135] What in here?
              [1136] In this room?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1137] Yeah.
              [1138] Yeah.
              [1139] ... I think maybe he's just come to realize [...] that ...
              [...] ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1140] Yeah.
              [1141] ... [singing] I'll come following you [] ... He d yeah it
              was odd when Frank said that cos apparently what happened, he
              just sort of started saying that he didn't think that Frank had
              really been there for him and that he was being a bit sort of
              selfish and stuff ... which I mean maybe he has been but the
              thing is if ... you know if Frank's making this massive effort to
              like fit in and meet new people and stuff then
Jemma (PS0BL) [1142] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1143] you know, Dave's bound to feel a bit neglected.
              [1144] ... It's a bit stupid to have all this in front of a ...
              bloody radiator innit?
              [1145] ... Whoops.
              [1146] We've gotta get a, we've gotta [laughing] [...] that thing
              [] .
Jemma (PS0BL) [...] ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1147] [singing] play a song for me []
*** 6 (Tape 055406) ***
Gill (PS0BK)  [1148] I did wonder what er like when I saw Ben I did wonder what
              he'd ... how he'd think, if I'd changed and stuff.
              [1149] ... You know?
              [1150] ... I'll tell you what, the bed that me and Frank slept in
              was [laughing] so gorgeous [] .
Jemma (PS0BL) [laugh]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1151] It was so nice, it was like erm ... [...] feather thing,
              feather, feather mattress.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1152] Feather mattress?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1153] Yeah.
              [1154] ... I think it was feather, or down or something.
              [1155] So it wasn't bouncy but the way that it fitted, or the way
              that you lay on it, it was just so comfortable, yeah, gorgeous.
              [1156] ... And I realized it was the first time I actually slept
              in a bed with Frank ever. [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1157] Yeah?
              [1158] I've ever, I've only slept with him once.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1159] Or like I've, I've slept with him in tents and stuff but
              not in a bed.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1160] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1161] [laughing] And Ben like [] when we were sort of there Ben
              sort of we'd been sitting around for a while and he said it's
              very embarrassing to have to ask this but you're staying the
              night and stuff ... erm are you two a couple [laughing] or are
              you just friends [] ... so no, just friends but it's alright, if
              you don't have any spare rooms we'll be perfectly happy to sleep
              together, don't worry.
              [1162] [laughing] It was just funny [] having him asking me.
              [1163] ... Yeah it was a good weekend it was, it was a very good
              weekend but packed ... so much packed in.
              [1164] You know I was only away for two nights, it felt like
              about a week. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [1165] You saw a lot of people, went a lot of places.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1166] Yeah.
              [1167] Shame Tom wasn't in.
              [1168] We were like ringing the bell and both of us were
              desperate for a crap, absolutely desperate, and desperate for a
              cup of tea cos we got up at ei er half seven. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [1169] [...] ... Oh well ... missed him.
              [1170] What a shame.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1171] It might have been easier actually to say she's not
              coming.
              [1172] ... Are you into going to a pub tonight?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1173] [...] I want to [...] wash my hair and
Gill (PS0BK)  [1174] I should stay in, I'm stupid going out again.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1175] [...] I mean I, I can see why you're going out but it's,
              you know ... I need, I need to have a night in I mean ... I've
              done, I've had so many stupidly late nights.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1176] Mm.
              [1177] ... Tell you what I must do actually whilst I'm thinking
              about it is do ... take one lot of washing out and put another
              lot in.
              [1178] [laugh] ... Yeah now we've got radiators it's very easy.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1179] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1180] [singing] Goodbye [] She wants me to ... don't know what
              she wants.
              [1181] ... I mean I'm quite happy to go to the pub with her I
              mean ... she's alright.
              [1182] ... I'm quite interested to see how I get on with her
              actually cos I've only ever known her in the context of Tom and
              Darrel really.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1183] Yeah.
              [1184] I find her a bit hard actually.
              [1185] ... [...] I get [...] she's not really interested in what
              I'm saying.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1186] Yeah, I know what you mean.
              [1187] It's the way that she kind of like answers before you've
              really got done finishing what you're saying.
              [1188] [laughing] Do you know what I mean [] ?
              [1189] You know when people do that and you just think well ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1190] [laughing] Yeah you can't [] really be listening to what
              I'm saying cos you ... cos I haven't [laughing] finished yet [] .
              [1191] ... Erm ... [laugh] Pizza Express tissues everywhere.
              [1192] That's better.
              [1193] [laugh] [sniff] Both T-shirts still look blue don't they?
Jemma (PS0BL) [...] ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1194] [singing] to be free [] .
              [1195] Maybe I put something in that's dyed them again [...] ...
              Hello
Jemma (PS0BL) [1196] Hello.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1197] come in love.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]

Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1200] Hi.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1201] Hello.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1202] How are you?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1203] Our heating's working again so it's bliss, absolute bliss
              ... and lovely.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1204] It's nice.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1205] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1206] Oh lordy!
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1207] Are they?
              [1208] Yeah Jim came over before and said that he was er ...
              going off to do work tonight.
              [1209] Andy's upstairs doing work.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1210] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1211] No he's doing it at home I think.
              [1212] I think he's, he's ... like the other day when he was here
              he was talking about how he was turning over a new leaf and
              stuff.
              [1213] ... So ... don't know how he's getting on.
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
*** 7 (Tape 055407) ***
Gill (PS0BK)  [1214] No I know what you mean.
              [1215] ... I've never really found it that much of an insult ever
              anyway, but I just think that it's a bit of a term which doesn't
              really apply to us.
              [1216] Do you know what I mean?
              [1217] We've got hippyish tendencies but we're not hippies.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1218] Well also I mean the term hippy I mean it's not really a
              real term I don't think.
              [1219] Shall I put a bit more, do you reckon that's enough ...
              that's okay that little bit of sauce innit?
              [1220] Do you reckon there's enough there?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1221] Is Nancy eating?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1222] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1223] Er er er er er well what else could you put in that would
              make it more
Jemma (PS0BL) [1224] More more tomatoes and more tuna.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1225] I might, I would maybe think it might be worth making a
              little bit more actually.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1226] Right.
              [1227] Shove it all in.
              [1228] Do you wanna chop,mu mush that up a bit?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1229] Okay.
              [1230] ... But then I'm pretty shit at measurements and stuff
              [...] cook the dinner
Jemma (PS0BL) [1231] Well what's left I can have tomorrow.
              [1232] ... Erm in that case ... are these, this stuff here ... is
              it yours?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1233] What stuff?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1234] This stuff.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1235] No.
              [1236] ... It might be Frank's or someone's.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1237] I reckon it is.
              [1238] Or Na [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1239] Oh she won't mind you using it anyway.
              [1240] She's got so much tuna she could bloody start an aquarium
              up.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1241] [laughing] [...] tuna []
Gill (PS0BK)  [1242] Mind you, they're all dead so it wouldn't be a very active
              aquarium really would it?
              [1243] ... Think the pasta's done.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1244] Right do you wanna ... turn it off then.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1245] Do you wanna taste it to check cos I might've got it
              wrong?
              [1246] No I think it's done actually, what am I talking about, I
              have got a brain.
              [1247] I can make decisions.
              [1248] I'm a graduate.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1249] Another thing I I've realized recently right, I, I have a
              brain, I can make decisions, I have an opinion
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1250] that can be valued by people.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1251] [laugh] ... I've always valued your opinion.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1252] Yeah I know you have but ... [...] anyone else has.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1253] Do you mean straight? [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1254] Yeah, yeah basically.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1255] [laughing] You know I'd never really valued the [] the erm
              ... the truth in that term, straight heads do definitely think
              very differently.
              [1256] Andy's a real mate he ... just kept saying straight heads
              ... er for all the times when I might have said ... oh, I
              couldn't really talk to some people last night and he'd say what
              you mean straight heads? [laughing] [...] [] he's right.
              [1257] ... Totally different wavelength man. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [1258] It's not just, I don't, well I d I don't think it's
Gill (PS0BK)  [1259] No it's not just straight heads but like quite a lot of
              the time it is straight heads.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1260] I think the thing is [...] people who are very straight
              aren't likely to [...] people who are like very ... limited in
              their m their way of thinking.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1261] Probably maybe a bit of a chicken and egg situation and
              the egg might have come before the chicken?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1262] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1263] Yeah.
              [1264] [laugh] Funny way of putting it.
              [1265] [singing] Deep in my heart ... safe from the guards [] ...

Jemma (PS0BL) [1266] Is there lots of space at the table?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1267] Er I can make some space, is it nearly dinner time?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1268] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1269] I'll open the wine then. ...
Jemma (PS0BL) [1270] Let the wine breathe.
              [1271] [laugh] ... It's really funny right erm ... in the office
              today this guy Paddy ... got a er a an, an invitation, like a
              formal invitation to erm a posh do
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1272] and erm he, he was trying to work out how, how to write
              the reply correctly.
              [1273] And he asked this girl er
Gill (PS0BK)  [1274] Can you say that again, sorry?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1275] This guy Paddy in the office
Gill (PS0BK)  [1276] Yeah?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1277] he had an invitation to a posh do, you know a black tie
              type of thing?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1278] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1279] A for a formal [...] invitation
Gill (PS0BK)  [1280] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1281] and he wasn't sure like how, what was the correct way ...
              to reply to it, right?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1282] Yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1283] And so he asked this girl Jane and, and then he asked me
              ... and erm and er had I sat down and thought about it I could
              have said well er what I thought, you know, the correct way er
              but I thought well ... there's correct and there's correct and I
              think the right way is to write to it and to say yes thanks [...]

Gill (PS0BK)  [1284] No there is actually a very formal way of doing it though
              isn't there?
              [1285] There's, I see what you mean, there's correct and correct.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1286] Oh yeah, yeah but I, I but I just thought ... so I, so I,
              [laughing] so I, so I said to him [] well I, if it was me I'd
              just write back and say thanks, yes I'll come actually, thank you
              very much
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1287] cos I thought what you talk about is such a load of
              bollocks and he looked at me madly, and I thought oh how funny, I
              thought [...] .
              [1288] I'm gonna have to start explaining myself to people a bit
              more actually
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1289] cos they get very, they misunderstand me.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1290] Yeah but I mean, it doesn't really matter if they
              misunderstand you does it?
              [1291] But I mean I know what you mean.
              [1292] I [...] a lot, cos I remember erm ... when Claire was ...
              I got a really formal invitation to something ... and I asked
              Claire how you were supposed to reply ... and she told me the
              exact wording of how you should reply and I just looked at her
              ... I looked at her and I said I'm not bloody writing that.
              [1293] ... Cos it sounded so stiff and so er
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1294] Cheers, lovely
Jemma (PS0BL) [1295] alright? ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1296] Oh dear [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [1297] [laugh] Good job [...] [laugh] [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1298] I mean the whole point of it is right is it doesn't make
              any difference how you reply to an invitation.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1299] Well I know, I mean especially if you know the people,
              what's the point of being formal if you know the people?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1300] Exactly.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1301] It's so ridiculous.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1302] [...] with, with posh people, if th if they were being
              pissed off by the fact that you didn't reply to the invitation
              properly then he's a dickhead. [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1303] people. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1304] Did you even try?
              [1305] ... Did you even try to get it out or did you just think
              oh well? ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [...] ... [music]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1306] Oh what!
              [1307] That wasn't doing what I was asking it to do.
              [1308] ... I wanted it to forward wind, I think I pressed the
              wrong button.
              [1309] ... I've got ... I did have the other one, Crossroads, but
              the reason why I had it was because Dave was in the house and he
              had it. [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [1310] Right, right, yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1311] And then he fucked off and left me and he didn't give me
              ... I di this, it really pisses me off the way that people like
              leave before you get round to taping the tapes that you liked, do
              you know what I mean?
              [1312] [mimicking] D'ya know what I mean [] ? ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1313] I know what you mean, yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1314] Now I wonder if this is doing what it's supposed to do,
              let's have a check. ...

Jemma (PS0BL) [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1412] It must be something like, like that.

Gill (PS0BK)  [1421] Mm. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1422] It is actually.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1423] It's reassuring, especially the way things are going at
              the moment.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1424] I haven't got a real tribunal to go to.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1425] What's this for?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1426] Oh at Handsworth, I'm meant to go there this evening to
              speak to the domestic bursar ... the residents' officer ... and
              someone else, God knows, from the university ... to put my case
              forward for why I had to leave Handsworth and that, why I
              shouldn't pay the money.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1427] Yeah but I mean you can't, you don't pay the money now
              just cos someone's moved in.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1428] Exactly, they're trying to screw me for every single penny
              ... they can get out of me [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1429] So what they're now saying that you've got to
Nancy (PS0BS) [1430] Well they want me to pay ... three days until she moved
              in.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1431] [laughing] Ah ha you're joking [] ?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1432] Every penny [...] it's getting really silly.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1433] That is just stupid isn't it?
              [1434] It'll be about three pounds or something.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1435] Exactly.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1436] Or it'll be about twenty quid or something.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1437] [...] cos the amount of m m time well, and the [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1438] Administration and stuff.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1439] Yeah.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1440] The administration [...] [speaking with mouth full] the
              price of ... stamps, phone calls, envelopes ... office time
Gill (PS0BK)  [1441] The [...] , like the administrative people have to deal
              with your three pounds.
              [1442] ... That is
Nancy (PS0BS) [1443] I know.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1444] just stupid, you should say that to them, make them feel
              really stupid.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1445] I will.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1446] And also there's a, bloody hell
Nancy (PS0BS) [1447] It's so bur it's so bureaucratic.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1448] it's a, it's for the students for God's sake, I mean they
              shouldn't be making like more hassles. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1449] They are basically real [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1450] This is what pisses me off so often you know, things like
              the halls of residence and stuff are there to help the students
              and they don't, they just try and rip them off for every cent
              they can do it for.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1451] Yeah.
              [1452] They er I mean in, in Handsworth right, on this bottom
              corridor, the boys' bottom corridor, it is in such a bad way you
              know like they keep erm ... like [laughing] putting their fists
              through windows [] and things like that, and the amount of
              repairs and fining.
              [1453] Like th what they did one time they all had erm
Gill (PS0BK)  [1454] What just cos they're all yobs?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1455] Yeah.

Nancy (PS0BS) [1462] [laughing] Yeah, yeah [] they were having
Gill (PS0BK)  [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [1463] fungus one night
Jemma (PS0BL) [1464] Do you want, does an does anyone want some of this bread
              because it is really nice and it's not

Nancy (PS0BS) [1468] Anyway yeah they had this, this fungus and erm ... they,
              they kicked down a door and erm got extremely, extremely
              energetic and like ... put like erm ... er er er in this store,
              it was a storeroom and they'd put things like the projectors and
              erm ... er catering equipment
Gill (PS0BK)  [1469] And in this door was what?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1470] In this store ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1471] Oh yeah?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1472] It was a door to a storeroom and inside this store there
              was all video equipment, catering equipment
Gill (PS0BK)  [1473] Oh dear.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1474] and they put it in the sinks and [laughing] baths [] all
              round the hall
Gill (PS0BK)  [1475] And turned taps on?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1476] No they didn't turn the taps on, they just left it all
              round the hall and, and the door frame had been kicked off and
              all things like this you know?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1477] Oh dear.
              [1478] Did they get caught? [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [1479] Well the people that done it didn't get caught but ... the
              corridor on which it happened was fined for all the equipment.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1480] Oh!
Nancy (PS0BS) [1481] A lot of money.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1482] So did the people on the corridor know who it was?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1483] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1484] Only they, they, they must be f mad with them.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1485] Yeah.
              [1486] They're obviously not gonna say anything but they are very
              mad. ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1487] They should get them to pay for it.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1488] I know.
              [1489] Well I think they are going to, the people that did it tt
              are gonna pay for it anon er anonymously
Gill (PS0BK)  [1490] Yeah.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1491] via the er ... hall inhabitants, you know, that cannot
              afford it.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1492] Yeah.
              [1493] So at least they won't get done for it cos they'd probably
              go up to disciplinary and stuff wouldn't they?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1494] [...] that on?
Jemma (PS0BL) [1495] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1496] Erm ... lordy lordy.
              [1497] I remember that we, we had erm a corridor fine in our hall
              ... for er just something stupid like they ... one of the ceiling
              tiles got broken or something.
              [1498] ... But we w did you have to pay a deposit?
              [1499] ... It came out of our deposit.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1500] [...] we did, fifty pounds.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1501] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1502] That's true.
              [1503] ... I should get that back shouldn't I?
Gill (PS0BK)  [1504] Yeah. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1505] Mm there's no reason why I shouldn't get that deposit
              back.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1506] No.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1507] Because last [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1508] And that's why they've mentioned it isn't it?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1509] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1510] Cos with us getting it back was automatic.
              [1511] I think [laughing] you were in a shitty hall Nance [] .
Nancy (PS0BS) [1512] I know. [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1513] What, what happened about your posters?
              [1514] They just walked in and saw that you had posters up and
Nancy (PS0BS) [1515] Yeah the cleaners, you know the cleaners have got a key to
              your room and that ... and you [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1516] What cos you'd used Blu Tak or something?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1517] Yeah.
              [1518] Oh basically you weren't allowed anything up on any wall.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1519] Well we weren't supposed to have posters up in our hall
              either.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1520] Really!
Jemma (PS0BL) [1521] Mm. ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1522] And erm y every time the cleaners came round on a Tuesday
              ... it's not ev er everything had to be on the bed, including
              chairs er everything, you know, you had to have your desk [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1523] [laughing] My cleaner used to come in and I'd be in bed []
              .
              [1524] And she used to clean round me and stuff.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1525] Cos our cleaners won't clean if it's erm ... occupied or
              ... not everything is cleaned from the floor ... they won't
              change the bed sheets unless you've actually taken them off and
              [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1526] We're, oh no we didn't, they didn't do that for us either.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1527] Well we we had that.
              [1528] We had to erm ... like have, you wouldn't, you wouldn't
Gill (PS0BK)  [1529] No [...]
Jemma (PS0BL) [1530] wouldn't get bed sheets unless they were actually stripped
              off the bed, things like that.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1531] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1532] But I, I, me and Claire, by the time we left U H, had a
              store of bed sheets to bring to our new house.
              [1533] Just because like they'd leave them for us and we hadn't
              changed them.
              [1534] ... And we'd just shove them on, under the bed and stuff.
              [1535] I had thousands, I mean I gave a load back cos I had loads
              of them.
              [1536] And the reason why [laughing] they were shoved under the
              bed was because [] I hadn't got round to sort of you know, doing
              anything about it sort of thing.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1537] Mm.
              [1538] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1539] But I mean my cleaner used to come in and just sort of
              like ... clean around me and chat a bit.
              [1540] ... Dave's cleaner in High Hall used to do loads of stuff
              for him, she used to wash his mugs up and all sorts of things.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1541] Mm.
              [1542] Mm.
              [1543] They do in the self catering flats.
              [1544] But erm ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1545] I'm gonna try a bit of your bread.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1546] they're really funny and finicky about a lot of things,
              you know?
              [1547] ... It does my head in.
              [1548] And basically they ha and the other thing, right, I found
              out what they had for dinner the other night right?
              [1549] ... We had jacket potatoes right, which is literally
              mouldy and baked hard so you'd get about ... out of a jacket
              potato you'd probably get about that much potato and the rest is
              just skin and mould and hardness ... quiche which is just like
              processed cheese and processed eggs and everything you can
              imagine just total packet mix
Gill (PS0BK)  [1550] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1551] it tastes like blancmange rather than quiche
Jemma (PS0BL) [1552] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1553] and erm ... salad which is just like ... brown lettuce.
              [1554] ... And y and I was paying eighteen pounds a week to be
              catered for.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1555] Wh why doesn't someone do anything about it? ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1556] Apparently [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1557] Like take it to N U S or something.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1558] Yeah.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1559] Because that is just a pile of shit
Nancy (PS0BS) [1560] We're not even
Gill (PS0BK)  [1561] they're ripping everybody off in that hall.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1562] we're not even in it, we've de-affiliated from erm
Gill (PS0BK)  [1563] Oh that's, that's why it's in that, basically that's why
Nancy (PS0BS) [1564] Oh
Gill (PS0BK)  [1565] people, that's why erm N U S is there to protect man.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1566] And nobody ... Handsworth is ... in a funny neck of the
              woods basically, it's like off campus, it's university
              accommodation
Gill (PS0BK)  [1567] Miles away.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1568] miles away, off campus, you know, they haven't got to make
              it look good
Jemma (PS0BL) [1569] So you haven't got, you haven't got any any back up kind
              of from the
Nancy (PS0BS) [1570] No
Jemma (PS0BL) [1571] campus, the whole campus feeling I guess is [...]
Nancy (PS0BS) [1572] Yeah, yeah.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1573] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1574] It is, it's sort of like ... it's sort of like extradited
              from the rest of the er ... the rest of the whole university, you
              know, nobody really cares about what goes on at Handsworth.
              [1575] ... But it's like wherever I, you know, if you get ...
              [...] a halls of residence on campus you would get put in
              Handsworth, like if you chuck a telly out of the, like one [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1576] [laughing] It's like a prison isn't it [] ?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1577] Yeah.
              [1578] It's like, you know ...
Gill (PS0BK)  [1579] Or a rehabilitation centre. [laugh]
Nancy (PS0BS) [1580] Yeah.
              [1581] But it hasn't got anything going for it, basically,
              whatsoever
Gill (PS0BK)  [1582] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1583] it's got ... three TVs though which are really rubbish and
              one small bar called The Bin, Village Inn it's called, and it is
              absolutely tiny, and really crap.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1584] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1585] Very expensive as well.
              [1586] It's more expensive than on campus, I mean we haven't got
              a pub there, we haven't got ... like the Guild bars or anything
              like that.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1587] It's worse than being on Griffin Close.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1588] Because there's no erm, there's no ... like for freshers
              there wasn't any sort of entertainments during freshers' week on
              at Handsworth, it was all at campus.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1589] Mm.
              [1590] ... So how, how do you get in to campus then?
              [1591] Do you, is there one bus that goes all the way in?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1592] One bus the sixteen, but it's like ... twenty minutes ...
              it's like catching the bus from Moseley erm Village
Gill (PS0BK)  [1593] Yeah.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1594] from here.
              [1595] You have to walk that far like to get the bus and then get
              in and then walk back home, it's not too far.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1596] But do they erm ... provide a minibus service
Nancy (PS0BS) [1597] No, no there's no
Gill (PS0BK)  [1598] to get back?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1599] no minibus service at all erm at any time of the day or
              night and they erm
Gill (PS0BK)  [1600] Cos we used to have like this minibus service back from
              the Guild
Nancy (PS0BS) [1601] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1602] even if you weren't in hall, and like girls used to get
              priority.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1603] Mm.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1604] You could hire out free rape alarms and all that kind of
              stuff.
Jemma (PS0BL) [1605] [...] yeah you hand your railcard over and get [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1606] Yeah, free rape alarm.
              [1607] That is just so shit but a lot of that is to do with the
              fa is A the whole of Aston disaffiliated from the Guild, from the
              N U S?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1608] The whole university is.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1609] When did they do that?
              [1610] Do you know? ...
Nancy (PS0BS) [1611] Last year I think, [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1612] That is just I just don't understand why universities do
              that, it's so fucking stupid.
              [1613] Cos that means that you can't get things like
Nancy (PS0BS) [1614] [...] apparently I was talking to like, cos you know a lot
              of my lecturers [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1615] erm like student cards and stuff cos that was all
Nancy (PS0BS) [1616] Mm I know.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1617] th no you can, but all student cards and stuff are all
              negotiated by N U S.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1618] I know.
              [1619] And the N U S, you know ... it is, in a way it is a good
              thing but in a way it isn't because when they were actual when
              they actually belonged to the N U S erm ... they weren't get
              because it's a small university, they weren't getting much
              funding from the US er the N U S or erm any support really.
              [1620] I mean it's just like ... Aston is, it is, is, it's, it's
              a university but it hasn't been a university for that long, it
              was a technological institute before
Gill (PS0BK)  [1621] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1622] it's only been a university now for about ... sort of ten
              year well not even that, five or ten years I think.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1623] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1624] And before it was sort of like the tech it was mainly erm
              sort of post graduate retr er sort of training centre ... for
              sort of science erm science graduates
Gill (PS0BK)  [1625] Yeah.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1626] and things like that and it only, it's only become ... and
              really it's only actually set up as a business school ... quite
              recently as well, I mean what in the past ten years or something
Gill (PS0BK)  [1627] Mm.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1628] as well.
              [1629] Erm my course has only been running for three years.
              [1630] ... I don't think they've actually had any graduates from
              my
Gill (PS0BK)  [1631] No.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1632] course yet either.
Gill (PS0BK)  [1633] Why?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1634] Cos it's only been running for three years
Gill (PS0BK)  [1635] Oh of course it's a four year course.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1636] [...] four year course. ... [...]
Gill (PS0BK)  [1637] So they don't really know how it runs do they?
Nancy (PS0BS) [1638] No.
              [1639] They don't know how it's gonna work.
              [1640] I mean it ... I mean er the reason why it was set up
              really was the nineteen ninety two sort of like coming into the
              single European market and everything
Gill (PS0BK)  [1641] Yeah.
Nancy (PS0BS) [1642] that's what gave them the sort of, the idea to set it up
              but ... I mean Aston is good because ... now we're [...] ... n
              now we're not
