*PS1BS:	Now now . 
*PS1BT:	of the eight cats . 
*PS1BS:	Oh I know she is Mm . 
*PS1BT:	living on your own syndrome So I think it 's the cats she catches anything from She worries and frets all the time It 's cos she 's nobody to talk to . 
*PS1BS:	Mm That 's what Julie and I were saying that when you live on your own you get a bit like that . 
*PS1BT:	Oh She she gets all wound up at home and then comes to work and where there 's people to sound off about everything under the er the sun . 
*PS1BS:	We were saying about John we was talking about John as well . 
*PS1BT:	Yeah . 
*PS1BS:	And the fact he ca n't just accept things he has to question things And we were talking about M E and how . 
*PS1BT:	Oh he 's a very intense person . 
*PS1BS:	how Dave I was saying about Dave and how he 's sort of taken taken a completely different attitude to things . 
*PS1BT:	More relaxed But . 
*PS1BS:	If he if he could n't do anything then he would accept it and not do it and then try a bit and if he had to go back to bed I mean he gave up work for a long time did n't he . 
*PS1BT:	Yeah But it 's such a sort of thing . 
*PS1BS:	And the contrast in personalities though they 're just . 
*PS1BT:	Well there 's a contrast in personality and you do n't really know whether anybody 's got the same thing because nobody 's narrowed it down . 
*PS1BS:	No oh no I mean . 
*PS1BT:	down . 
*PS1BS:	Yeah you ca n't . 
*PS1BT:	All they know is that they 're . 
*PS1BS:	But Julie was saying . 
*PS1BT:	different . 
*PS1BS:	about that sleeping treatment that he took tha that finished him off because he he he . 
*PS1BT:	Yes but . 
*PS1BS:	staked so much on that and we were we were agreeing . 
*PS1BT:	Oh yes I know . 
*PS1BS:	that the reason he did n't sleep was because the fact that he was just sitting around all day So you would n't sleep . 
*PS1BT:	But they did n't . 
*PS1BS:	then your body does n't need it . 
*PS1BT:	they did n't do it properly though . 
*PS1BS:	Oh That was the other thing she said that he he should have be gone into hospital . 
*PS1BT:	Course he should He tried to do it at home and that was . 
*PS1BS:	They co . 
*PS1BT:	ridiculous . 
*PS1BS:	did he have the opportunity to go into hospital to have it done . 
*PS1BT:	Erm well the . 
*PS1BS:	I would have thought . 
*PS1BT:	Yeah . 
*PS1BS:	so because erm . 
*PS1BT:	I mean Paul said with the blokes down in London and he he ga gave them the pills and sa told them that they go back home and so he did . 
*PS1BS:	Yes but the Julie said and she 's right of course you ca n't have the erm strength of drugs to to to administer at home because obviously . 
*PS1BT:	It was n't it was n't . 
*PS1BS:	you 've got to be monitored on that sort of thing You ca n't be put into . 
*PS1BT:	it was n't done right . 
*PS1BS:	a deep drugs and ni not have erm some medical staff monitoring you . 
*PS1BT:	Yeah it sounds like you did a lot of work yesterday . 
*PS1BS:	I told you we tal I talked I I disturbed her all day long . 
*PS1BT:	Oh look . 
*PS1BS:	What Why is that What is it . 
*PS1BT:	Oh . 
*PS1BS:	I was going to say it was just something stuck on the . 
*PS1BT:	It 's te I 'll pick it up i if it it was rust on the . 
*PS1BS:	No no It it it . 
*PS1BT:	No now that I 've seen it . 
*PS1BS:	while I was sitting from here I could erm see it had something stuck on it . 
*PS1BT:	The sheep seemed to have thinned out . 
*PS1BS:	Mm mm I think they must be up that other end cos th there 's about a couple of dozen yesterday I noticed . 
*PS1BT:	Only two down here They 're not eating our hedge . 
*PS1BS:	No see that one that 's going up near where I planted granddad 's honeysuckle . 
*PS1BT:	Mhm . 
*PS1BS:	They erm they er there was a lamb nibbling that yesterday and he 's taken off so the bits at the top and the bottom have no connection any longer so . 
*PS1BT:	Oh . 
*PS1BS:	It 's not I do n't think that 's granddad 's honeysuckle I must go out and check it . 
*PS1BT:	I do n't know where granddad 's is . 
*PS1BS:	No it 's ju it 's just down there . 
*PS1BT:	But that was a wispy one granddad 's was ever so big . 
*PS1BS:	No granddad 's never really took off . 
*PS1BT:	With big leaves . 
*PS1BS:	because of the of the drought When we were away it did n't get watered on I used to water it every day . 
*PS1BT:	Well everything looks as though it 's had a good water now . 
*PS1BS:	All four lilac trees have taken anyway I want to check that the . 
*PS1BT:	Did I tell me when we got up to erm Newcastle we turned on the local news they 'd had five inches of rain which is a winter 's rain in four days . 
*PS1BS:	Mm mm . 
*PS1BT:	The Metro station just down from Gosforth Park er was flooded to platform level . 
*PS1BS:	Oh Like d' ya do you remember Sheffield . 
*PS1BT:	And all the overheads were . 
*PS1BS:	flooded last year . 
*PS1BT:	Yeah And and everywhere you went the fields waterlogged . 
*PS1BS:	Actually standing in water . 
*PS1BT:	Standing in water all the way up Snow on the hills and everything . 
*PS1BS:	Mm . 
*PS1BT:	But fortunately you know we we only got tail end of it a bit of sleet . 
*PS1BS:	Whereabouts did you go yesterday You know you said there was a bus coming at half past eight Where did . 
*PS1BT:	Erm . 
*PS1BS:	you go I could n't . 
*PS1BT:	to . 
*PS1BS:	I could n't quite imagine what you were doing . 
*PS1BT:	went round the erm British Gas research establishment . 
*PS1BS:	Oh Was it mu was it very interesting . 
*PS1BT:	Amazing Amazing And very impressed The it 's a massive place and you know five or six hundred staff and erm it 's where they develop all the new technology for the gas fields delivery of gas to your house and everything But you see they 're spending a lot of the time you know on developing ways of repairing roads after they 've been in them And what 's impressive is they 're doing research that we should have been doing for years I mean it 's a bit much when the gas board is there showing us . 
*PS1BS:	How to research . 
*PS1BT:	how it 's developed materials it 's developed techniques and everything for mending roads So it 's er a bit humbling . 
*PS1BS:	So did you learn something . 
*PS1BT:	Yeah Quite a lot You see when the erm legislation changes shortly well the legislation is there but when it 's enacted erm they they will become responsible for repairing after their own hole digging and they have to provide us with guarantees . 
*PS1BS:	Certain standard and time to do it in . 
*PS1BT:	Yes but I 've they 've got to guarantee the repair for at least two years after they 've done it . 
*PS1BS:	Ah I see . 
*PS1BT:	So British Gas the commercial have worked out that there 's only one way to do that you do the job properly to start with . 
*PS1BS:	Mm Yes . 
*PS1BT:	And so they 're putting all the effort into doing it . 
*PS1BS:	Mm Well they . 
*PS1BT:	And er . 
*PS1BS:	do n't wan na amount of time of coming back again to do it have n't . 
*PS1BT:	It 's . 
*PS1BS:	they . 
*PS1BT:	well that 's lost money is n't it . 
*PS1BS:	Mm mm . 
*PS1BT:	So no it was very impressive I 'll I think it 's a bit much when you have highway engineers there and really they were showing us how it should be done And er . 
*PS1BS:	Mm mm . 
*PS1BT:	they proved you know some things certain rollers and stuff that we thought were useless you know Paddy 's dancing partner . 
*PS1BS:	Oh yeah . 
*PS1BT:	Erm well we thought that was out of fashion They 've shown that if you run it at the right speed and stuff it 's one of the most effective methods of doing it and erm the ones we say are the nice little plate compactors which are the best thing they are useless in comparative performance so . 
*PS1BS:	Mhm . 
*PS1BT:	er no it was good The money they spend on research I forget what it was the turnover was erm something like eight billion Or was it no i er it probably eight hundred billion It was in some figure you ca n't even relate to So . 
*PS1BS:	Well they must have a lot of money Is n't it British Gas' Chairman that 's just had that enormous pay rise . 
*PS1BT:	Well I think most of them have Oh yes but the Gas one has But I mean th the the standard of entertainment I mean put putting . 
*PS1BS:	0 . 
*PS1BT:	us all in that hotel for . 
*PS1BS:	Somebody was saying rang in complained to Peter about the the amount of what what are they getting It 's not it 's not quarter of a million is it It 's about two hundred thousand . 
*PS1BT:	Prob probably something like that . 
*PS1BS:	And Peter said well what would you consider a reasonable salary for him And I thought he would say something like you know something really silly about fifty sixty thousand but he said I think a hundred and fifty thousand 's enough And I thought well it is really is n't it . 
*PS1BT:	Probably is . 
*PS1BS:	And for for somebody who was ringing in an ordinary person just complaining . 
*PS1BT:	Mm . 
*PS1BS:	I I do think they have rather gone over the top . 
*PS1BT:	Well there you are If you want to attract the right people and keep them you have to pay them money . 
*PS1BS:	Yeah but do n't I 'm sure there must be a lot of right people who will work for a hundred and fifty thousand . 
*PS1BT:	Probably not . 
*PS1BS:	Well . 
*PS1BT:	The other thing that was interesting I learnt at dinner on Thursday night is under the government 's legislation within so many years nineteen ninety four I think they 've got to ha have reduced their market share from the original hundred percent to sixty percent as new firms come in to sell gas . 
*PS1BS:	Yes . 
*PS1BT:	Now as the bloke said there the only way you can do that with people coming in from the outside is that British Gas have got to keep pushing their prices up to make it worthwhile for somebody else to come in . 
*PS1BS:	For the competition to get in . 
*PS1BT:	You ca n't just suddenly say well we 're not gon na supply this quarter or something unless there 's somebody coming in . 
*PS1BS:	Mm mm . 
*PS1BT:	to do it To make it commercially attractive to somebody else British Gas have to got keep lifting their prices to a level that eventually somebody comes in and says oh yes . 
*PS1BS:	It 's worth my while . 
*PS1BT:	it 's worth me having a go . 
*PS1BS:	Yeah . 
*PS1BT:	I asked them if once they 'd got rid of the forty percent they could then get it back by dropping the prices you know they 've they 've . 
*PS1BS:	By by competing . 
*PS1BT:	satisfied them legally . 
*PS1BS:	Yeah . 
*PS1BT:	They were n't sure about that But they they thought they 'd probably struggle . 
*PS1BS:	I thought just assumed they would have known .
