I got some foot long   (.) pruners but the branches were hitting our thing and I were doing this and, you know, and now I've got 
*EVE:	And that's what's   (        ) shoulder.

*TOM:	It seems unusual.It, it w it would have been nice to have asked him, you know, how come they took it?What was the reason for it.

*EVE:	I know my, my sister's er grandson, he's had a computer, he's fourteen   (.) and er   (.) anyway, oh he wanted a bigger one costing about eight hundred pounds.And now he's, they've got one and I think it was about five hundred pounds, they bought this one s but they managed to sell the other one for about a hundred and fifty they say.

*EVE:	And they're expensive aren't they?
*TOM:	Er yes they are.
*EVE:	Ooh he, he's m mind you he, he reckons that's what he wants to do when he's older but   (.) I mean the life, or the career of anybody in computers is not very long is it?Because they're changing so rapidly.
*TOM:	Yes, yeah.
*EVE:	I mean my, one of my friend's   (.) sons, he was a computer man, he was working on his own but he's in his   (.) I should think he's getting on for about forty six   (.) and he was doing freelance but this recession   (.) the people who er the firms who were employing him are using their own staff   (.) and they're not calling on him now and er   (.) he's not done any computing for twelve months.
*TOM:	Mm mm.The building n next to us, where we are, you know   (        ) do you, on   (        ) 
*EVE:	Mm.
*TOM:	Street?There's a big glass building next to us, have you seen it, it's 
*EVE:	Mm.

*EVE:	Yes we kept going there when   (        ) yeah.
*TOM:	Th th that's going now
*EVE:	Yeah.
*TOM:	because somewhere er headquarters, they're going to do the work for all the region, so therefore they've gotta go
*EVE:	They're, yeah.
*TOM:	So all those computer people are out

*EVE:	What as to 
*TOM:	how many people they're gonna keep or not gonna keep so 
*EVE:	Oh 
*TOM:	we don't know who's gonna go or what, you know, it's quite worrying really but er 
*EVE:	Oh it is really isn't it?
*JAC:	Well you see he thought the Gas Board was here forever you know?
*EVE:	Well you do don't you?But
*TOM:	Well since they've gone private
*EVE:	And especially these computers where they change every  (.) 
*TOM:	Mm.
*EVE:	every few years don't they?
*TOM:	It's, it's er 
*ART:	 (        ) they employed 
*EVE:	Yes   ((laugh)) 
*ART:	they employed six thousand people and when the   (        ) came they all went to Law Street adjacent to the factory so they could walk across to the job and er look at it now, they've smashed it all down, it's gonna be an Asian big store.It's all been levelled now and taken away and they employed 
*EVE:	No they're not, it's supposed to be being used   (        ) 
*ART:	six thousand people.
*EVE:	I don't know whether you go down Valmer Road do you?
*JAC:	Not very often no.
*TOM:	I went, I went there about two years ago to Walkers Crisps and, that's just next door to er  (        ) .I went by but yeah a lot of it's all down, there's still, still a part being kept though isn't there?
*EVE:	Mm.Oh they've still got a small part there.
*ART:	Ah that's, that's the American section.
*TOM:	That's right.Mm.
*ART:	American United.
*TOM:	That's the   (        ) 
*ART:	We w we was   (.) partnerships you see well   (.) when our place collapsed they carried on   (.) just carried on a bit because they were connected with Japan.In fact er just before I retired they were saying, you know, my job's obsolete and that, and then   (        ) and says oh we're opening up a big depot in Japan.So you see it's gone there you see.
*EVE:	So you   [laughing] just retired in   [] retired just about the right   (.) time.
*ART:	Mm. (.) 
*TOM:	 (        ) you know, it's gonna be difficult to get another job now, so 
*EVE:	You're in the drawing office?
*TOM:	Yeah.
*ART:	Cos I've been silly in the past, I've told Evelyn lots of times and   (.) we had a new machine, a rapid na nailer, it er   (.) nailed er army sho er soles onto the   (        ) at five hun it used to do three hundred and fifty nails a minute and we m made one just for   (.) I er went out on the road, er to five hundred a minute you see, and er we were building the first half a dozen and er   (.) er there's two pawls at the back of the machine 
*EVE:	Ooh we don't want to know.
*ART:	Ah but th th th there's a rack and w one goes on and holds the horn post up to the boot while it's driven, then it comes out   (.) and there's two, one's half a tooth, so it ensures one or the other's in, and they work like that.So I was spinning the cam round, it hadn't got pinned to the shaft, just spinning it round on the shaft and these pawls were doing this   (.) and Les , the top one, he went to Kettering and then Don, the next top one, he went to er 
*EVE:	We don't want to know all this.
*ART:	r er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden, and er this top one,, and his mate come out of the toilet, been for a smoke, and er walking by I said hey Les, look at this, and I spun the cam round and it went bang and stopped dead.He said well you've got no bloody springs on the pawls, I says   (.) so I picked a tin of springs up, we kept it for anybody who wanted a spring for their bike, any spring where, you know the hooks on each end?
*TOM:	Mm.
*ART:	Well they broke off in wear and when you was overhauling a machine you'd throw these springs in the tin in case you ever wanted one.And he said er   (.) oh he says er er there's no, your spring's broke.I s so I showed him this tin full, I says well look they do break don't they?Anyway, do you know the easiest, er and at that time five pound were five pound, if I 'd 've gone to the foreman and then the er   (        ) 
*EVE:	Drawing office.
*ART:	drawing office, I 'd 've got five pound on a suggestion.Anyway in the fullness of time er  went to er
*EVE:	You said that.
*ART:	near Kettering, Don went to er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden   (.) and er I'd been there about a year and all of a sudden there was a call in for Shorteners at   (        ) so I went down on the bike and er   (.) what er the one over me who, who was elderly, well wasn't over me but he was er   (.) he was on my job but the senior man on it   (.) he come in, the boss had sent him in to have a look cos the er Shorteners were complaining, and er then they rang up for one of us, he said well I'm not leaving till I've solved this problem so I had to go.But er   (.) all he did was, you know the two pawls that go in and out?He made a bit of eight inch wire, like er a U piece, and the bar at, bottom bar of the U held the tail so if the springs broke the tails didn't duck under and smash the cam.It'd smashed the cam and, and the lever and bent the shaft   (.) colossal expense at that time.
*TOM:	Mm expensive   (        ) 
*ART:	Now him and his mate says ooh   (.) er you, your spring's broke.Now I were bloody daft, If I 'd 've gone to the foreman and wanted to put a suggestion in, I, I, I 'd 've beat   (.) sure they were crowing abou when he got    (        )  (.) but I was first really wasn't I?
*EVE:	Mm.
*ART:	I, I'd seen it before it happened
*EVE:	Mm.
*ART:	you see, and three more went like that eventually but er he got the dough and that was it.
*TOM:	That was it, mm.
*ART:	And Evelyn always says I'm too diffident to push my plate up and
*EVE:	Well, he used to come home and say that and I'd say put a suggestion in but
*TOM:	Mm.
*JAC:	Mm.
*EVE:	if he did I   [laughing] had to write to out for him  [] .
*JAC:	Mm.
*EVE:	Still we didn't do too badly.Anyway how long have you got to go before you retire?
*TOM:	Ooh eleven years officially.
*EVE:	Ooh.
*TOM:	 (        ) if it was up to me I'm 
*EVE:	Mm.
*TOM:	gonna go in nine.I shall go at sixty three at the latest, I'm not going on to sixty five 
*EVE:	Not staying longer.
*TOM:	and it might end up  (        ) 
*EVE:	No, no.
*TOM:	There's certain rumours that there's no   (        ) 
*EVE:	Still you might get a a big redundancy   (.) pay out if you do.
*TOM:	Well   (.) talking about a year's salary   (        ) 
*EVE:	Is that   (        ) 
*TOM:	You get a pension of course but it depends how many years 
*EVE:	Yes you get a pension.
*TOM:	you've been there and I've only been there thirteen years so
*EVE:	Oh.
*TOM:	that's not
*EVE:	Not as good.
*TOM:	they said about a quarter of my salary didn't they?
*EVE:	Mind you how many years were you in your pension?Not all that many.
*ART:	From the beginning weren't it?
*EVE:	No you weren't
*ART:	No?
*EVE:	the B U didn't have a pension scheme till after the war.
*ART:	No, no. (.) But talking about pensions i 
*EVE:	Do you get a pension in yours?
*JAC:	Only my own what I put in, no.I've been paying a full stamp since nineteen seventy four.
*EVE:	Yes, it's a good idea isn't it?
*TOM:	Yeah.The sad thing is   (        ) 
*EVE:	Well my friend never paid 
*ART:	Tal talking about pensions Tom, the chap er cha  (        ) with the office girls and that and, and checking our expense sheets, he, he er they put a notice on the board   (.) you could ante your   (.) what, in your pension, you could a put a bit more into it   (.) and I were looking at notice and he says ooh he says it's no good for you, he says er   (.) w well I told you about it didn't I?
*EVE:	Yes.And I said ooh 
*ART:	He said ooh he says you won't get no more if you retire.So I mentioned it to Evelyn and, being an office-wallah, you know, and any, any e extra money she were all there, she worked it out says ooh that, it were another ten bob a week you see, well we've been 
*EVE:	Which was a lot in those days.
*JAC:	Mm.
*EVE:	Well you had a rise as well.
*ART:	we've been glad we've been glad now haven't we er
*EVE:	So he anted his up.I mean ten shillings was a we a we was
*JAC:	Mm, quite a lot, yeah.
*EVE:	 ((laugh)) years ago.
*ART:	Yes but we're glad   [laughing] now  [] .
*EVE:	Oh yes because now   (.) mind you the B U pension's quite good because every year we, we get a p a percentage increase
*TOM:	Mm.Mm.
*EVE:	but I mean ours doesn't, mine doesn't, I mean mine's only a small one because I haven't done many years there.
*TOM:	Ours goes   (        ) cost of living it says.
*EVE:	But er, oh that's alright if it does but the B U is, is, you know, a really good one.
*JAC:	Mm.
*TOM:	But you've got to get some years in to get a really good pension, but I've got thirteen and   (.) the maximum you can get is forty years but you get, then get two thirds of the salary you would have got,
*EVE:	Mm.
*TOM:	your own salary, so that's pretty good for a pension isn't it?You know.
*EVE:	Still perhaps you get the earnings   (.) thing don't you?Earnings related as well sort of thing.
*TOM:	That's being stopped though   (        ) 
*EVE:	Has it?
*TOM:	It's gonna be in the year two thousand they're gonna wipe it out.
*EVE:	Oh, oh   ((laugh)) 
*TOM:	So that's it.
*EVE:	Oh dear I'm not   (        ) au fait with those things now.
*JAC:	No well this is why w you know like my girls have got just to take their own   (        ) now.
*TOM:	Take their own private ones see, (        ) 
*JAC:	Yeah.
*EVE:	Yeah my nieces are doing that, Audrey and er well her husband's self employed so er
*TOM:	See all the firms I've been to up till the Gas Board just gave you your money back for your pension.
*EVE:	Yes they did.
*TOM:	If they could have said to you would you keep it and, or transfer it t I would've said yes please.
*EVE:	Well they can do now, in those days they didn't.
*TOM:	But they, they could but they they didn't in my day, they just 
*EVE:	No.
*TOM:	gave it to you back and you got no choice in the matter, that was it.
*EVE:	No they didn't, no, we didn't in our place.
*TOM:	So that was a shame really as far as I'm concerned.
*ART:	Do you reckon the er 
*EVE:	Mm.Although Peter my friend's   (.) he, he did that but er it didn't come to much, they 'd 've saved it or something, one job, cos he was made redundant about three times   (        ) and er   (.) one, one place he was at   (.) they're supposed to have kept it and paying him it now but I don't know how they came about that bu because actually they we played him a dirty trick, they persuaded him to leave his job   (.) and then about nine years or probably less than that later   (.) you know and he was out again, redundant   (.) and, you know, I think they felt a bit guilty but he only gets about five pounds a week from, off that one, which is   (        ) 
*JAC:	Nothing is it?No.
*ART:	Er er do you reckon we ought to have had, you kn you know we went over to gas, I toyed with the idea of fetching that    (        )  (.) do you know, you know when this house were built we went looking at a depot where they've got all these grates and I took th funnily enough I took the measurements of the breast    (.)  [laughing] and er   [] the only one we found was just that   (.) dead on look, right across
*EVE:	Is that recorder still on?
*TOM:	Oh yeah   (        ) 
*ART:	Oh ye yes, yes it's still going.
*EVE:	Oh that's alright, finish one tape.
*ART:	Tape and
*EVE:	Mm.
*ART:	well we shan't finish that lot shall   [laughing] we at this rate  [] ?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	Well if you, if you finish three we're  ((laugh)) 
*ART:	You can't very well go in a pub   [laughing] can you  [] ?
*TOM:	No not really.
*EVE:	You've not seen Jackie's new lounge 
*ART:	I er 
*EVE:	have you?
*ART:	No.
*EVE:	It's beautiful int it?
*JAC:	Well it will be when it's finished, the curtains are 
*EVE:	Have you finished?
*JAC:	Well they came and fetched the curtains on Thursday, they've got to go back.
*EVE:	Why, what's the matter with those?
*JAC:	Not level, the dining room one was two inches shorter one side than the other, the tie-backs 
*EVE:	Really?
*JAC:	were all creased, and the lounge 
*EVE:	Ooh   (        ) 
*JAC:	is like this!They weren't level at all.They came back 
*EVE:	Ooh!
*JAC:	back and they were disgusted so they've taken them down and gonna make me a complete new set.
*EVE:	Oh, oh I didn't know that, mm.
*JAC:	Yeah.And he suggested tie-back is, cos it's, the pink is the thinner material, they're gonna pipe it instead of what they've tried.Oh the machining was dreadful.
*EVE:	Mm.Who, who was who was the
*JAC:	Well Maples, they contract out to this 
*EVE:	Ooh!
*JAC:	workshop
*EVE:	Oh I see, Maples.
*JAC:	But
*JAC:	Cos they should be good there shouldn't they?
*JAC:	Well this is it, the man was disgusted, he said oh dear.
*EVE:	Yeah.
*TOM:	They are very good though, they come when they say and they, they d they do something about it 
*JAC:	Oh they've been very good, oh yeah.
*EVE:	Mm.Yes.
*TOM:	they don't just leave it, they'll go and do it, you know?They've very good   (        ) 
*EVE:	Mm.Cos we had Linekars, course they've gone out of business, but when he came, when the boss came to this one   (.) he reckoned one of these was   (.) a bit out didn't he?
*ART:	Mm.
*JAC:	But this, I mean they measured, in fact he even measured the track to see the, make sure the track wasn't level, you know, and 
*EVE:	Yes.
*JAC:	Cos the windowsill is about an eighth of an inch out, well in one place
*EVE:	Mm.
*JAC:	but he still, the curtain was supposed to be something like sixty one and a half inches   (.) one was about a sixty one and the other was about a sixty three one end, you know? (        ) 
*EVE:	Tt oh that's sad.Oh what a shame.
*JAC:	As he said it was Christmas rush I think, you know?
*EVE:	Yeah oh of course it was just before Christmas.
*JAC:	But er you know they've just not done the edges properly either, you know  (        ) .So they've all gone back.Luckily we've got the old curtains.
*EVE:	Cos I've not seen it with the curtains   (        ) 
*JAC:	No   (        ) 
*ART:	Have another drink Tom? (        ) 
*EVE:	Do you want a drop more sherry?
*TOM:	 (        ) just a little drop then 
*ART:	Go on.
*TOM:	just a small drop.
*EVE:	You pour it out Arthur, I can't get that cork off very easily.
*ART:	 (        ) Tom, here you are then Tom   (        ) 
*TOM:	 (        ) do you want some more   (        ) 
*JAC:	No I'm fine.
*TOM:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	 (        ) have a martini.
*JAC:	No I'm fine thanks.
*ART:	Have a whisky.
*EVE:	No!You can't mix the drinks.I thought Tom might have a whisky if he's got a   (        ) 
*TOM:	 (        ) that's a funny   (        ) 
*ART:	Oh I, I don't want to don't want to butt in Tom 
*TOM:	sometimes I feel I'm sh 
*ART:	Ah never mind about it, what about  with his new car?
*EVE:	What sort is it?
*JAC:	It's a Ford Sierra.
*ART:	E Evelyn 
*EVE:	Oh it's the same sort is it? (        ) 
*JAC:	Yeah he had a Ford last time didn't he?
*EVE:	Yes it was a Sierra 
*JAC:	It's not quite the same, it was erm
*EVE:	Maroon colour?
*JAC:	Mm   (        ) 
*ART:	Do you reckon he's given,th there's been a lot of er goings er to-ings and from-ings, do you reckon they've had a whip round?
*EVE:	No!
*TOM:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	I don't think he could've been insured do you?
*ART:	Well there's been no end, there's been no end to it.
*EVE:	Well except for third party, how long 
*JAC:	It's funny, I don't know.Yeah.
*EVE:	he left it there, do you?
*TOM:	I don't know he's a s 
*JAC:	Mind you yours took a long time, you know that bump Tom had going to his 
*TOM:	Mm, mm.
*JAC:	mother's funeral?That was April, it's only just, you know?
*TOM:	Yeah but they sorted it straight away though didn't they? (        ) 
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*EVE:	Yes but I mean you get get the repair done don't you?
*JAC:	Ye yeah.
*TOM:	Yeah.
*JAC:	I mean that looked a write-off so I don't know   (        ) 
*EVE:	Well erm
*TOM:	You couldn't   (        ) 
*EVE:	 (        ) and he said it wasn't cos he   (        ) 
*ART:	Funnily, funnily enough he, funnily enough his car's on that picture    (.)  (        ) 
*TOM:	It is   (        ) oh well it is, it's there, yeah.
*EVE:	M Martin said when he   (        ) 
*ART:	Have you noticed how he, he creeps that bit, he   (.) you know, he, he don't keep back he, he just   (.) he gets just that bit behind the
*TOM:	Yeah.
*ART:	you know?
*JAC:	 (        ) during the day cos our cars are not there.
*EVE:	No well that's what I said i er   (.) and probably perhaps when you were on holiday.
*ART:	The road intrigues me Tom 
*JAC:	Yeah.
*ART:	how clean it looks and the, you know the marks, those black marks, they're the joints of the concrete where they 
*TOM:	That's right, (        ) 
*ART:	You know they kept   (        ) 
*EVE:	It looks very clean doesn't it?
*TOM:	Can you see the paving stones?They're white   (        ) 
*EVE:	Yeah, mm, that's what, yeah.
*TOM:	I've never noticed those before.
*EVE:	Mm.
*JAC:	Well that's the new bit they did, you know, the little
*TOM:	Do you know y y you, it's a different aspect, you go out here and all you see everything at ground level and you can't really see on top of everything 
*EVE:	Yes, mm,s see low, no.
*TOM:	But on there see you can see all the details can't you, (        ) at all.
*EVE:	Mm.
*JAC:	 (        ) 
*ART:	But I was struck, I was struck by the frame.
*EVE:	 (        ) 
*ART:	I think that frame's worth it these days, I
*EVE:	Yeah.
*ART:	I, (        ) but   (.) I reckon you've got a bit of money in the fra in the frame.Cos I was 
*EVE:	Oh that lady who came with this, she said er   (.) Arthur happened to say he'd just bought it, and she said how much did they charge you, twenty five pounds or thirty pounds?
*TOM:	Mm.
*EVE:	So I said no, only twenty.So apparently   (.) she said ooh he probably charges, perhaps if he's not very   [laughing] he reduces the price   [] but   (.) funny she said twenty five pounds.
*ART:	She seemed to know about it.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*ART:	And it's funny they came together and she, she pushed 
*EVE:	She knew, not quite together.
*ART:	in while I were   [laughing] with the other chap  [] .
*EVE:	No it was a minute afterwards because I thought 
*ART:	Well 
*EVE:	oh he's come back   (.) for the, this, to show to you.
*JAC:	Mm.
*EVE:	I thought perhaps he'd been to you and   (.) sort of were you interested and he he'd come back.But it was only a second 
*EVE:	No. (        ) 
*EVE:	after er sort of I'd more or less half a second   (        ) and I thought oh he's come back again   (        ) 
*ART:	But, but I had more to do with her than Evelyn but er from what little bits I've gleaned, you know, er I'm a bit into everything like, and I seem to think, I've got a f strange feeling that she's something to do with education and they're worried about children not speaking properly eventu 
*EVE:	No!
*ART:	Le let me finish.Er eventually they won't speak real English, with all this Asian kids in   (.) now al all the Asian children have gotta go in any school haven't they and th everything, well sooner or later er this mixture of languages is gonna spoil the English language isn't it?Bound to.
*TOM:	Yes it's bound to.
*EVE:	No what the they'll do, they'll put all the words that are used into a computer er from all these things won't they?And then they'll see how many   (.) are sort of used a lot and   (.) percentage and that's what they'll do.
*TOM:	Mm.But as Arthur says though perhaps some of the Asian words will start being used by the English people.
