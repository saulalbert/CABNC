*PS08Y:	No and of course the weeds will have a . 
*PS091:	Yeah they . 
*PS08Y:	a fine old time wo n't they . 
*PS091:	Yeah . 
*PS08Y:	Aha But your ground I imagine you 've kept it fairly cre free of weeds for quite a . 
*PS091:	Yeah . 
*PS08Y:	time now . 
*PS091:	Erm on our some of our small plants we do n't use any erm sprays or . 
*PS08Y:	No . 
*PS091:	we use erm a rake or a and we draw across the seeds and that 'll ra bring out the weeds . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS091:	I done that on my wheat this afternoon erm but we have to use fertiliser on ours cos . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS091:	we do n't have to sort of ai n't got ta take really too much muck . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Yes . 
*PS091:	cos we do half we muck erm I 've grown pretty well . 
*PS08Y:	Mm . 
*PS091:	so it gives the plants a boost . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS091:	so we do n't have too much muck so and like put some fertiliser on the other bits . 
*PS08Y:	I see Because in fact you ca n't put that compost on the or that muck on the when you say muck do you mean the compost that you make with the vegetables . 
*PS091:	Yeah . 
*PS08Y:	Yes Erm you ca n't put that on till it 's really broken down can you . 
*PS091:	No . 
*PS08Y:	So it 's erm you use up probably quite quickly what you 've got . 
*PS091:	Yes erm all our sort of cabbage stalks and beans stalks go onto the muck heap to turn into a sort of compost but other people they just sort of burn or take them away and buy a bag of compost . 
*PS08Y:	Yes . 
*PS091:	But erm bought bags of compost are n't so good cos if you use all er stuff you 're growing you put erm it back onto the ground . 
*PS08Y:	Mm Mm . 
*PS091:	what 's come off the ground . 
*PS08Y:	Mm yes Yes it seems reasonable does n't it to put it all back It 's all been natural stuff has n't it . 
*PS091:	Yes . 
*PS08Y:	Aha Which bit of the gardening do you like best .

*PS091:	Yeah I keep when I I I always scrape the vegetables sometimes but when I do though I keep cutting my fingers . 
*PS08Y:	Ugh yes yes . 
*PS091:	So I gave them to dad to do .
