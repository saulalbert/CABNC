*JEA:	There was, unless I was prepared to put a ruddy great nail through my door   (.) I couldn't hang the thing!
*BRE:	What did you decorate them or did you just leave them plain?

*BRE:	Perhaps we were going to and then decided 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	against
*JEA:	And I tried to fix it to the door   (.) and it wouldn't, I tried to do it up with Blu-Tack and would have none of it, I tried to do it with Sellotape and wouldn't do it   (.) the Sellotape kept on coming away   (.) something in the varnish I think that resisted that   (.) so then I thought, right I'll   (.) I'll tie the thing up in someway, I forget how, and blew away   (.) went down the drive!

*JEA:	This man is pathologically mean!
*BRE:	Well the these

*DAV:	I'm saying everything's turned off at the moment, alright?
*BRE:	Was it  (        ) ?
*DAV:	No, he's not sure, he don't think it is that h he's he's gonna cut the gas, he said it's not right    (        )  (.) the er central heating pumps are well hot, he said it shouldn't be like that   (.) so he to there's a little box up there he thinks it's probably this box   (.) but he's he's trying to figure out what it is up there because he's   (.) he's just such amazed at price of pieces 
*JEA:	Mm.
*DAV:	trying to work out exactly what's going round   (.) might have a
*BRE:	But did you tell tell him that, it doesn't get that hot in the conservatory?
*DAV:	No that's  (        ) .
*BRE:	Nothing to do with that and the radiator key?
*DAV:	No, can't be that   (.) no don't worry about that.
*BRE:	It's a worry, isn't it?
*JEA:	It is, I don't know.
*BRE:	I suppose even sort of, with a   (.) with a plumber, you know,y you don't   (.) I mean, I suppose they don't always know what they're looking for.
*JEA:	Well no because   (.) unless they put the system in and know exactly what it was   (.) there are so many different ways of delivering water.
*BRE:	Mm, the thing is the guy that used to live here was such a bloody prat!
*JEA:	Oh like Brian?
*BRE:	A didn't help chap!
*JEA:	Oh   (.) oh my dear!
*BRE:	And the jobs we've found
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	that that's gone wrong because he's a do-it 
*JEA:	Quite 
*BRE:	yourself chap 
*JEA:	Quite   (.) yes.
*BRE:	it's just totally unbelievable!
*JEA:	Yeah   (.) well this is my   (.) this my
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	this is the story of my life   (.) now in the bathroom I have had, I have had to pay   (.) a hundred pounds to Mr Butcher the plumber   (.) to put in   (.) a new   (.) shower thing   (.) because that was   (.) cheap and rough and   (.) eventually wore out   (.) should never have been put in.
*BRE:	What about your leak that came through the ceiling, is that cleared now?
*JEA:	Oh it's doing it again it's doing it again, dear   (.) oh yes, doing it again   (.) erm   (.) I had the plumber up to look at that   (.) cos I thought the plumbing was all wrong and he said no   (.) he said the plumbing is wrong   (.) the waste pipe of the   (.) en suite shower and the bath are connected, and they shouldn't be   (.) they should be separate, but they had been connected   (.) and that is bad   (.) but no, he said, what's happening is quite simple, he said erm   (.) the people using the en suite can't control the water it's going out   (.) he said the curtain doesn't fit flush against the wall, because the wall leans, you know
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and he said water is getting out, he said tell people to be more careful and put towels all round   (.) so in my lovely en suite I've got old towels all round my   (.) surround 
*BRE:	Oh!
*JEA:	I love that 
*BRE:	God!
*JEA:	Brenda, I adore it, it's me all over   (.) so   (        ) the bathroom   (.) I had endless trouble, as you know, with Shirley   (.) I had to buy stuff and Shirley came in   (.) and I gave her   (.) little   (.) presents of this and that and helped her with cooking meals for her   (.) she re-grouted practically   (.) my bath tiles and my en suite tiles because we thought   (.) water was going through the wall, and it was   (.) and then I had to replace the   (.) where you take the plug out in the bath, I forget what you call that, the trap
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	all that has had to be replaced   (.) because that was starting to drip down into the hall, again! (.) And then   (.) I had to th the shower just   (.) came, you know   (.) came to pieces in our hand, as it were it was not working as a shower   (.) so a plumber had to come   (.) Mr Butcher came into me 
*BRE:	 ((cough)) 
*JEA:	unscrewed the whole lot and he said this is cheap old rubbish! (.) It's continental   (.) and is not   (.) is not U K   (.) and that was   (.) a hundred pounds, more or less for his   (.) fee and   (.) and buying a and buying at   (.) a discount through somebody who I knew   (.) buying this   (.) new shower   (.) and the tappy things, you know 
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	the mixer things   (.) that's the bathroom. (.) And the next thing that's going wrong in the bathroom   (.) will be that I'll have to replace that   (.) central heating pump.
*BRE:	Is that going wrong then?
*JEA:	It's it makes an awful noise   (.) in the morning! (.) I I've got a bill to come in from the electrician for his call-out charge   (.) he diagnosed that it's was not an electrical fault   (.) and then thought it was an electrical fault by the noise, it was making a fizzing noise   (.) but he doesn't th he said it's, it's the pump   (.) the pump is   (.) on the way out   (.) it needs replacing   (.) house is built in nineteen eighty five! (.) So   (.) the bedrooms   (.) and they're not too bad because he hasn't been able to do anything   [laughing] in the bedrooms    []  (.) the bedrooms are alright   (.) except that over the lintels in most of the bedrooms   (.) the plaster   (.) is is not right, it's it's flaking in great lumps and rippling   (.) and cracked   (.) something to do with the 
*BRE:	So was he the guy that did everything himself then?
*JEA:	Yes and he hadn't the faintest idea of how to do it!
*BRE:	But that   (.) flakiness and that is obviously when it was new   (.) he didn't let it dry out, he just painted 
*JEA:	Quite.
*BRE:	over it.
*JEA:	That's right   (.) so   (.) you then go into the en suite room, well I cannot tell you the trouble I've had from the en suite! (.) Water pouring through into the kitchen   (.) water pouring down the electric wire of the lamp in the study!
*BRE:	What from there?
*JEA:	Yes   (.) and   (.) eventually   (.) Shirley and I thought, well I mean, we spent weeks grouting, we grouted and we grouted   (.) and still water was coming through and we grouted and at last it seemed to be dry   (.) and the man came and did the re-artexing on the insurance   (.) and I had wa new wallpaper put up, for which I paid extra because he only allowed eight pounds a roll, the insurance company only   (.) pays eight pounds a roll   (.) and I had eleven pound wallpaper and a border   (.) and having got the whole thing up   (.) the s the patches have appeared again!
*BRE:	And they won't pay out again will they?
*JEA:	Oh no   (.) er   (.) and I
*BRE:	Did they come and check it   (.) first or they just 
*JEA:	No, no they just take your word for it   (.) and   (.) now I have got   (.) as I said, I've got   (.) that, I've got to paint that over   (.) and reseal and I've got to make sure that nobody makes a mess in there, but the plumber said   (.) what you really need to do   (.) is to get rid of this cheap and tatty, horrible   (.) plastic tray   (.) which doesn't come right to the edge of the tiles
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and buy   (.) a screen   (.) five hundred pounds he says!
*BRE:	Mm, very clever isn't he?
*JEA:	I just looked at the man, I thought, I oh god I can't cope with this!
*BRE:	So you've just got a curtain round it?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	So you come down the stairs   (.) and you come into the kitchen   (.) in the kitchen   (.) we start with the refrigerator being put next to the   (.) cooker
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and I've had that taken out because I couldn't, I just could not stand it especially in hot weather!
*BRE:	You've got a new cooker haven't you?
*JEA:	I've got a a a well I got a new cooker   (.) had a have a new cooker because   (.) when they took the old one out it was already in seven separate pieces!
*BRE:	Those, bloody useless one though!
*JEA:	He bought it off the town dump! (.) so   (.) new fridge- freezer in the cu which is now free-standing in the corner   (.) bought it from Doug 
*BRE:	Oh I've seen that.
*JEA:	you know   (.) reduced price   (.) but never-the-less money   (.) new cooker   (.) gas hob removed because that was going U S   (.) and an electric hob put in   (.) the formica in the kitchen, if you remember when you first saw me, it was tiles it wasn't formica, it was ghastly tiles   (.) and when Ned lifted all that out   (.) it was black with with rotten mould!
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	The man hadn't grouted   (.) the tiles in properly   (.) he'd used some sort of rough old cement and the water was just going through and staying there!
*BRE:	Oh my God!
*JEA:	Fortunately   (.) Ned gave me that pink formica and the new sink as a present.
*BRE:	So you didn't to buy it.
*JEA:	Ha   (.) what else have we got?
*BRE:	Gas fire.
*JEA:	The gas fire   (.) I have formed a really deep and meaningful relationship with   (.) Andy at Anglia Gas   (.) he's been back and forth to my house, I know all about the fact that he hasn't got a girlfriend   (.) and his mother is a marvellous cook   (.) and that Worlingworth is a bit off the map   (.) he and I are buddies, dear! (.) I hate to think how much money I have paid over to Anglia Gas   (.) if I'd known what I was into   (.) I could have walked into that house then and I could, while I had all that money   (.) before I gave any   (.) away   (.) I could have said, right, I'm going to have to spend that, that, that, that and that   (.) and I would have done it and it would have   (.) I would've been   (.) alright because I wouldn't have had things going wrong!
*BRE:	Is it still working now, the fire?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	But after about three hundred quid innit?
*JEA:	Ha   (.) I could have had a lovely new one!
*BRE:	That's th the trouble is they keep repairing, (        ) they don't tell you this do they, I mean 
*JEA:	No!
*BRE:	they could have, sort of, said look 
*JEA:	In the end I bullied Andy, I said, Andy there is something fishy about this fire   (.) he said well it's possible he said that   (.) it was erm   (.) a display model   (.) and every time anybody came in   (.) and needed a replacement part instead of sending for the part   (.) they took it out of the display model!
*BRE:	God, what was that bloke! (.) Was he a youngster or what was he that lived in your house?
*JEA:	Well youngish, he'd got youngish children, you know.
*BRE:	Blooming idiot, weren't he!
*JEA:	Well   (.) totally! (.) I mean   (.) next time I buy a house I shall say excuse me but are you a blooming   [laughing] idiot? (.)  (        )  [] .
*BRE:	Are you gonna be   (.) but these D A Y, D I Y 
*JEA:	Oh.
*BRE:	are okay if they know what they're doing, but I mean th this this guy, I mean
*JEA:	My lovely Gerald was very, very clever   (.) he was a mechanic, he was a graduate mechanical engineer   (.) and he knew everything about cars that needed to be known.
*BRE:	Mhm.
*JEA:	And he thought as a result that he knew about everything else as well and Brenda, he didn't.
*BRE:	No.
*JEA:	Because another way in which I had to throw   (.) good money after bad was that after he died   (.) once I started having things done in the house   (.) they kept on turning up things that he had done that were absolutely N B G
*BRE:	 ((cough)) 
*JEA:	the al do you remember those wires hanging about in
