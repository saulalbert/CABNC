*PS1DS:	Yeah .  2166163_2166353
*PS1DR:	Is that right Four .  2167163_2170413
*PS1DS:	Four is twenty So it 's four so .  2171103_2174943
*PS1DR:	Four times five is .  2175903_2177363
*PS1DS:	Twenty Four times five equal twenty Er two times six equals twelve Er four times three equal twelve Er two additions left Alright .  2177363_2194393
*PS1DR:	Those two add So it 's like one two one two and one there and but put like erm seven add seven add seven is .  2194393_2228103
*PS1DS:	Is twenty one Yeah Seven add seven add seven is twenty one .  2231153_2236563
*PS1DR:	One .  2236563_2236753
*PS1DS:	And three times seven .  2236893_2238633
*PS1DR:	Right .  2238633_2238763
*PS1DS:	is twenty one and do it that way five and fives Okay Two addition questions .  2241403_2258433
*PS1DR:	Hang on .  2259053_2259343
*PS1DS:	Two ad yeah but you 've got right two multiple and two addition equations .  2259343_2262213
*PS1DR:	Not equations You told us this .  2262703_2264923
*PS1DS:	But i thi like these these are equations So two addition equations er three times se seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one Right Oh A so but you can also go .  2264943_2283433
*PS1DR:	Yeah Yeah add three .  2284383_2284843
*PS1DS:	Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one Do it that way on Do you follow .  2284843_2290023
*PS1DR:	Yeah .  2290023_2290163
*PS1DS:	me .  2290163_2290233
*PS1DR:	Yes I do Right Two multiplication .  2290273_2292053
*PS1DS:	Yeah .  2293003_2293153
*PS1DR:	and two addition .  2293443_2294473

*PS1DR:	And then this we do like .  2306263_2308793
*PS1DS:	Right she wants currency in two divisions in each right So it 's one two three four fi .  2310603_2316203
*PS1DR:	That multiplication is a .  2316313_2317133
*PS1DS:	yeah well divisions okay so it 's twenty one shared by say if that 's one two three four five six int it .  2317133_2327843
*PS1DR:	Oh I know what I 've got .  2327843_2330163
*PS1DS:	Six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen .  2330163_2334753
*PS1DR:	I know what I 've done I 've put the I thought it was er okay Six .  2334983_2340973
*PS1DS:	And division is shared by So you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen .  2342833_2351973
*PS1DR:	Have you got .  2351973_2352353
*PS1DS:	shared by three is six .  2352353_2354343
*PS1DR:	So like you go one two three four five six six times you swap .  2354593_2359593
*PS1DS:	Three .  2359593_2359743
*PS1DR:	six times three .  2359743_2360623
*PS1DS:	times three is eighteen .  2360623_2361363
*PS1DR:	is three times six .  2361363_2362263
*PS1DS:	Six Yeah and and you got .  2362263_2364253
*PS1DR:	Six times three and three times six .  2364253_2365113
*PS1DS:	A and division is eighteen shared by three is six and eighteen shared by six is three Yeah Got it .  2365113_2384613
*PS1DR:	I can not read .  2384883_2385443
*PS1DS:	Three sixes are eighteen You got it .  2388643_2393243
*PS1DR:	And you do the same there Hang on I have n't finished thirty three .  2393243_2395683
*PS1DS:	0 . 
*PS1DR:	one yet That 's what I do n't get Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I do n't a get how you do that Is it would you like us to put .  2395993_2417833
*PS1DS:	It 's fours int it It 's fours .  2417963_2420483
*PS1DR:	No two four six eight ten twelve .  2420533_2422343
*PS1DS:	Yeah It .  2423383_2423583
*PS1DR:	That 's twos .  2423763_2424093

*PS1DR:	Oh .  2461913_2462103
*PS1DS:	So it 's I would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six And on that one is er sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine .  2462103_2483093
*PS1DR:	four .  2483093_2483273
*PS1DS:	No Sixty three divided by nine is six Write six through it Ten six in n it .  2483943_2492093
*PS1DR:	No it 's ten sixes .  2492093_2493343
*PS1DS:	No no wait a minute Nines What should nine times ten Emma .  2495153_2499743
*PS1DR:	One nine is nine two nines are eighteen three nines are .  2499743_2506993
*PS1DS:	Twenty seven Four nines are thirty six five nines are forty five six nines fifty four seven nine are sixty three .  2506993_2525793
*PS1DR:	Oh thank you .  2525883_2526253
*PS1DS:	Right Yeah seven nines are sixty three .  2537623_2539443
*PS1DR:	Hang on a minute Six nines are .  2539443_2544603
*PS1DS:	seven nines are sixty three .  2544603_2545573
*PS1DR:	Hang on a minute Seven .  2547023_2549183
*PS1DS:	Seven nines are sixty three .  2549183_2550203
*PS1DR:	Sixty three .  2550203_2550653
*PS1DS:	Yeah .  2550763_2550833

*PS1DR:	Two nines are eighteen .  2555823_2557533
*PS1DS:	So that one there is sixes into si thirty six .  2557983_2562753
*PS1DR:	I know But I still do n't get what you have to write .  2562853_2565363
*PS1DS:	Well multiplication equation for this number line I would say is er I 've already told you that .  2565363_2572133
*PS1DR:	No but I do n't know what I have to I have to write .  2572133_2573733
*PS1DS:	Eight times four equals thirty six .  2573733_2576353
*PS1DR:	Do n't get it .  2576362_2581603
*PS1DS:	Because it 's one two three four five six seven eight no sorry nine times four is thirty six Nine times four equals thirty six Like this look .  2581603_2595103
*PS1DR:	Write it out on a piece of paper and you 'll and I 'll write them down .  2595103_2598743
