*ANN:	Yeah I pushed one down and the other one  down   •171125_192625•
*STU:	Automatically yes. •192925_201925•
        So, same as this. •201925_210825•
        If you press  this one, if you press record  it won't because there's a tape in but if you just press press record  automatic  and you press  record and the play button  but you can't press just the record button. •212825_386925•
        They automatically both go down. •387425_406925•
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	Provided there's a tape in the •412225_424525•
*ANN:	In the machine. •424525_438325•
*STU:	in the machine that •438325_452525•
*ANN:	I saw it actually when I was  just doing it and it went  how loud it was. •452525_501525•
        How could you be but it isn't look. •501525_524025•
        Can't hear it. •536625_541625•

*STU:	Yeah. •562325_563025•
*ANN:	I thought   loud. •563025_589725•
*STU:	noisy   •601125_602025•
*ANN:	Yeah. •606725_608125•
*STU:	You're gonna •608225_612025•
*ANN:	You could be an an obtrusive  making that noise. •612025_642725•
*STU:	No. •646025_647725•
        No it doesn't  •647725_664025•
*ANN:	Though it doesn't make a noise cos I was doing it wrong. •664025_694525•
*STU:	Yes. •712025_712925•
        It's going slowly now. •713025_735425•
*ANN:	Yeah. •735425_739525•
*STU:	Going much more slowly now as it records more  conversations. •741025_809125•
*ANN:	That's it. •826524_845525•
        Mm  Don't stop talking now. •845525_871125•
        silly. •950225_951625•
        It's all gonna go quiet now isn't it? •951725_970825•
        Nobody else'll say anything. •970825_104912•
*STU:	at all. •105042_•
*ANN:	That's ridiculous! •106882_107922•
        You gotta  •107922_109492•
*STU:	. •_•
        We'll just have to  put it down there some time and just  put it on. •109502_117312•
*ANN:	Yeah. •117312_117372•
*STU:	So you wouldn't know when it's on or when it's off. •117372_120322•
*ANN:	Mm. •120632_120792•
*STU:	Just have to try and, take a little while to get used to it. •120792_123522•
        Once you're used to it it's probably . •123562_126272•
        It's all a matter of getting used to being recorded. •126282_129332•
        Conversation. •129332_129432•
*ANN:	Yeah well it sounds ever so funny when you hear it   •130302_132412•
*STU:	I know. •132412_133152•
        Yeah. •133182_134142•
*ANN:	Horrible. •134142_134242•
        You think  I don't sound like that! •134312_138682•
        . Really makes you think. •138682_140222•
        I wish  done something about my  the way I speak. •140532_144372•
*STU:	Mm. •144822_145112•
*ANN:	Mine's terrible because I've got a low voice, a deep voice anyway. •145122_149802•
        Sound more like a man I do. •149802_150902•
        I do on the phone don't I? •151342_153182•
*STU:	Don't know really. •153192_154382•
        I've not really heard you much on the phone. •154392_156622•
*ANN:	Used to telephone didn't you? •156622_157982•
*STU:	Well yeah but •157982_159062•
*ANN:	Didn't know it was me. •159072_159842•
*STU:	Oh yeah I knew it was you so it didn't make a lot of difference. •159842_163842•
*ANN:	People have told me on the phone that I sound  cos I've got a deep voice I •163842_169602•
*STU:	You sound different. •169602_173072•
        Vera does. •173072_174162•
*ANN:	Does she? •174172_176392•
*STU:	Mm. •176782_176892•
        She sounds funny on the phone. •176892_179592•
        Most odd. •179592_180212•
        Phone her up and think  that's not Vera I'm talking to. •180272_184032•
        Doesn't sound like Vera. •184042_186072•
        But it is  although it doesn't sound like her. •186072_189082•
        Funny innit? •189082_189722•
*ANN:	What, her voice is different? •189722_190592•
*STU:	No it just sounds  •190592_191322•
*ANN:	Or does she talk different because she's on the phone? •191322_194082•
*STU:	No  just sounds  •194082_195422•
*ANN:	Some people do. •195422_197462•
        They put their phone voice on. •197462_199632•
*STU:	Yeah. •200042_200172•
        Yeah. •200172_200392•
*ANN:	Don't they? •200402_200862•
*STU:	Yeah. •202822_202932•
*ANN:	Oh I can't put any voice on, I've just got me own. •202932_206452•
*STU:	Mm. •207462_207622•
*ANN:	I find people do tend to put a  quite a lot do, put a telephone voice on. •207692_215022•
*STU:	Specially if you're phoning a posh restaurant. •215292_219382•
*ANN:	Yes. •219962_220002•
*STU:	Or something like that. •220032_223112•
        You tend to sort of I'd like to book a table for two •223952_229482•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	on Saturday night. •229922_230762•
        Rather than say  look mush I want a •231002_233372•
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*STU:	I want a table, you know. •233432_240422•
*ANN:	Oh I'd better go and wash our dishes dear. •241372_247432•
*STU:	Not many to do now  done them all. •248162_250982•
*ANN:	Most of them. •250982_251412•
        There's only yours. •251422_252052•
        Have you had  •252172_253782•
*STU:	What about  •253782_254572•
*ANN:	enough to eat? •254572_255242•
*STU:	Yes thank you. •255242_256012•
        Fine. •256422_256502•
        I would have done it actually when, when I took the plate out but the water in the bowl was cold. •256982_261452•
        Thought it was hot but it was cold. •261452_263202•
*ANN:	I think I've used most of the hot water. •264482_266252•
        I think I need to put the immersion on for just  a little while. •266252_270112•
*STU:	Mm. •270202_270262•
*ANN:	I need a bath as well but •271062_272902•
*STU:	Mm. •272902_273022•
*ANN:	I've used quite a few buckets of water washing walls. •273032_278112•
*STU:	Washing the walls and    What's going on outside? •278332_288572•
        Car or lorry or something going by by the sound of it. •288572_301082•
*ANN:	About that little  flat in   in Albany Road. •301082_304372•
*STU:	Yeah. •305052_305172•
*ANN:	You have to realize that  we're never gonna get away from work. •305472_309982•
        Cos when the wind blows you can smell a tandoori and   •309982_314622•
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	It's when you walk up that way you know you're getting near it •314632_316702•
*STU:	Yeah. •316702_316792•
*ANN:	cos you can smell it. •316792_318382•
        Won't bother you? •318392_319082•
*STU:	No. •319082_319332•
        Not really. •319332_321532•
*ANN:	Mhm. •322382_322612•
*STU:	fact it'll be quite handy in a way really, you know it's •323192_326892•
