@Comment:	conversation #6 (Tape 059903)
*UNK:	It'll not be a dodgy one. Put it in there, then. 
*ALB:	It won't be, it's not forced to be a building society. 
*KAR:	No, it isn't. It gonna   (  ) to be a building society. 
*ALB:	Oh, well, it might be Abbey National. 
*KAR:	No, it's come back, it's got Target Finance on it. 
*ALB:	Ah. Well that's o  that is a finance company   (.) and not a building society. If it says finance, it doesn't mean a building society. Nine times out of ten, it's a finance company. Same as er, Mercantile, and 
*JUN:	Well, 'cos I mean, we dealt with Mercantile, we dealt with Key Finance, 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Er  (.)  
*ALB:	We've dealt with summat Wagon. 
*JUN:	Key, that, when we first bo  when we first bought our car through that Scottis  that bloody bank. 
*ALB:	Scottish Amicable. 
*JUN:	Scottish Amicable. 
*KAR:	Like Widows. 
*JUN:	They're always ringing up. They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at night. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Asking us whether we  want to borrow some money. 
*JUN:	 Er, asking if there's  anything we co  , look at him walking about with that  (  )  
*KAR:	Everything, everything, what oh, papers have got, has got Legal and General on it. 
*JUN:	Mm. 
*KAR:	So, I thought, well   
*ALB:	 Yeah. 
*KAR:	it can't be a a dodgy  (.)  
*JUN:	I don't think it'll be anything dodgy. 
*ALB:	It won't be dodgy. 
*KAR:	Oh. 
*ALB:	But you can always, easily find out 
*JUN:	What usually happens, though. 
*ALB:	All you do, is pick the phone up and and get, oh now, what place do you ring. I forgot what place you ring, but we're find out, and you ring up to see what they're, what the company's like. You know, if it's a variable company. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Things like that, you could do that. 
*JUN:	 Different companies  take over, I remember that time we borrowed that four thousand pound. We started out with Key Finance and we ended up with Mercantile Credit, didn't we? 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	Changed companies three times, that time we had that four thousand pounds. 
*KAR:	You told me about that, yeah. Well   (  ) said that it will be a sm  a really small building society. He says, that, 'cos er, it's not   
*ALB:	 Well. 
*KAR:	Big building societies are not prepared to give you rates, and small building societies are wanting to get going 
*ALB:	You see, the only trouble with building societies is, it's the same when you buy a pigging house  , they put the money on what you've actually borrowed every year. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Well, finance companies only, you only get the interest on what is left. 
*JUN:	On the money that you owe. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	That's the difference. And between them both, you can, you could   (.) I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage, mortgage, and you could end up paying what, twenty thousand, twenty four thousand   (.) back. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Well, finance company. You, you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to, and you get a certain amount put on that, and that's it, it's fixed. 
*KAR:	 No. 
*ALB:	 You don't  pay no more. Say you'll, you'll you'll get twenty thousand five hundred, that, if you buy, if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures. You borrow twenty thousand, and the interest payments works out 
*JUN:	Benji 
*ALB:	very high 
*JUN:	He's alright. 
*ALB:	It's very high, you know, the interest payments are very high, but for that money you've borrowed you'll only pay say, just for a a figure, five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand, five you know, 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	five thousand pound, not. 
*KAR:	Not paying it for years and years all the time. 
*ALB:	But if you borrow it from a in  er mortgage company, you're gonna, you're gonna borrow twice that, you gonna have to pay twice that much back. Forty grand, you kn  that's the only difference, and 
*KAR:	I don't mind that so much though, 'cos they say we are paying a lot less back a month than other way. But I just got one thing that I want, that they gonna send me owt dodgy like a loan shark bloke or owt like that, I mean you, you're bound to be a bit nervous, you know. 
*ALB:	No, they won't send a loan shark. You you can tell loan sharks, straight away, because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent . Ma  maybe twenty nine, even thirty, depending, but if it er, mind you I don't know, because it's a long time since I had a look at 'em. But, you know, when you when you borrow money, you get er, an interest rate, don't you, over so many,yo  you've got to figure out ho  how many years you're gonna pay it back. You know. If you say, oh, we'll take it over ten years. Well you've got ten years interest to pay, ain't ya. So you pay the interest for for nine years, and they start paying your loan off. 
*KAR:	We're still having trouble getting insurance, and er, anyway I phoned, and I wrote him again yesterday, and he's given this number, who er, who he's with. 'Cos he had a right job, (  ) got plastic, 'cos he even   (  ) plastics, I mean that's 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Inflammable, ain't it. Anyway, er, the bloke who managed to get him insurance, this this, the premises are insured with him, 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	so I thought, well, if he's already got, er, part of his insurance without having  (  )  
*ALB:	Yeah, because he was in, paper, waste paper, and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal. 
*KAR:	That's where   (  ) cardboard and paper. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Sasha come in here, shut door. 
*SAS:	He's not coming in. 
*ALB:	But er, I can't understand why, because I mean, let's face it,he  he's only using fibre-glass and they're not that flammable 
*KAR:	No, what they're saying is. Not the flammable, it's the er indemnity, nobody can breathing it in who's in    (  )   
*ALB:	 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
*KAR:	They're frightened like, in years to come, like, they're gonna try and make a claim against them 'cos their er, been on the chest, is summat like that. 
*ALB:	Yeah. I, it's  health and safety, yeah. 
*KAR:	  (  ) er. 
*ALB:	Through the health and  safety, but. 
*JUN:	 Eighty  four we had this extension put up. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Sasha come in here. 
*ALB:	But, after saying that, 
*KAR:	There's a draught in  (  )  
*ALB:	what you gotta do, is make up your mind, what chemicals you're gonna use 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	and then find out all about 
*KAR:	What ya got? 
*SAS:	Don't know. 
*ALB:	them particular chemicals and then submit it to the, the insurance company, what them's the only chemicals you use, and the  company said this and that. 
*KAR:	  (  )  they told him that. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	And they still 
*KAR:	See he's off again, (  ) I bet it is. Just started itching. (  )  
*ALB:	Well, he has just flown about. 
*KAR:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	I say, he's just flown round bloody  house, 
*KAR:	 He has. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	Oh. I bet  (  )  
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	'cos I thought I'd look. 
*JUN:	Aye. 
*KAR:	I couldn't  (  )  
*ALB:	It might be dust out of his wings. 
*KAR:	Yeah   (.) I   (  ) every time I come here. ((laugh))  
*JUN:	Nineteen ninety one, ninety two. 
*KAR:	I must have sensitive eyes 
*JUN:	Eighteen hundred and fifty two. 
*ALB:	Dear me. 
*JUN:	We've had that pebble-dash nearly, nearly, it's nearly two years since they did that pebble-dash. Cost us two thousand nine hundred, and in two years, we've only paid, eight hundred, nine hundred  (.)  
*ALB:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	A hundred 
*KAR:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	 A hundred and forty pound, 
*ALB:	  (  )  
*JUN:	we've paid off in two years, Karen. 
*KAR:	How much. 
*JUN:	A hundred and forty pound. 
*ALB:	In two years. 
*JUN:	In two years. 
*ALB:	Now, if that had been a finance company, I would have paid a  damn sight more. 
*JUN:	 But it cost us    (.) thirty seven pound a month. But, last year, we put, no wait a minute, last year, we paid 'em four hundred and eight pound fifty two, and they put two hundred and seventy two pound fifty interest on. So actually all we paid, was 
*ALB:	Thirty seven, per cent  
*JUN:	 Thirty odd, thirty   (  )  
*ALB:	That's round about thirty-seven per cent, innit, somewhere around  there. 
*JUN:	 Yeah, we paid thirty eight pound off it last year. 
*ALB:	Makes more. It's ridiculous, you know, mortgage payments. When you think of it. 
*KAR:	I know. 
*JUN:	and on 'ouse, they put eight hundred and ninety eight pound, you could say, nine hundred pound interest on 'ouse. 
*ALB:	Oi. I don't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are, because, you know,it  it's totally unfair, 
*KAR:	They are. 
*ALB:	I mean, alright, we know you're handling large lumps of money, but when you think of it, if you, if you, borrowed it at a different rate, you know, same rate as you could do finance, 'cos which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	You know what I mean. Instead of having all these different mortgage companies, Abbey National and that, the government have er, have er, a whatsname to do it, they're wouldn't be half and a quarter. I mean, it happens all over the world, you know, in in the in the especially in the whatsname countries. 
*KAR:	I know. 
*ALB:	Communist countries. Everything's owned by the by the government and er, I know it's not a right good thing, like, but if it could work properly, it would be a damn good thing. 
*JUN:	Watch she don't bite ya. 
*ALB:	I mean, communism in England, 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	in it's   (.) in it's proper form would be a wonderful thing, but er, it's on  because er, it's only the rich people what make people poor. 
*KAR:	I know. 
*ALB:	The say as with damn education, like, at bloody Tory sods, they took all blinking, we gi  for al  for all these people what's going to college, every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing to keep 'em. 
*KAR:	No. 
*ALB:	So I my opinion, what this government's doing is stopping stopping the lower class, well I say lower classes, the lo  the the 
*JUN:	  (  ) isn't it. 
*ALB:	 poorer people, they stop 'em getting educated. That I'm I'm almost  convinced. 
*KAR:	 Yeah. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	It says, everything they're doing, it says, is going back to the eighteenth century, when you hear about these Kath  Catherine Cookson days, working for pennies and you  can't get educated   
*JUN:	  (  )  
*KAR:	un cutting back, 
*ALB:	They're cutting back on  education. 
*JUN:	 Oh, you're telling me   (.)   
*ALB:	They're making it so only the rich can be educated. 
*KAR:	Yeah, trying to turn it back into   (  )   
*JUN:	  (  )  at the end of the day. 
*ALB:	I mean, our Colin's there waiting for a grant and what's happening. Sweet nothing. Now we're, it were in bloody paper last   (.) on Thursday, they don't get nothing when they're on holiday. 
*KAR:	No, they don't, 
*ALB:	I mean, how the hell they supposed at eighteen year old without a job. 
*KAR:	Mm. 
*ALB:	If they have a job, they don't get no grants. And how can you have, hold a   (.) a job down 
*KAR:	I don't think  (.)  
*ALB:	 And do education at same time. 
*KAR:	 I'm not sure, but    (.) I think I don't got my family allowance until I were eighteen, I think, I think they used to give us    (  )   
*JUN:	  (  ) let me keep our Karen's   
*KAR:	 Oh. 
*JUN:	 So I've  got a form to fill in, actually. It should have gone back last week, and I  (  )  
*KAR:	It'll all stop when she gets her  grant through. 
*JUN:	 Don't knock me.  She said not necessarily. I think it will stop them   (  ) thought shit I'm not bloody going to declare it, (  )  
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	She applied for a grant, and in, er in career, it says like, 
*KAR:	Sasha    (  )   
*JUN:	 you'll, like you you   (  )   
*ALB:	No, you'll rip it. 
*JUN:	Left home, you know, we are, like, say our Karen  to leave home. 
*ALB:	 Aye. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	And she were living  in the parks. 
*ALB:	 Get up here. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	They used to give 'em subsidies to help 'em pay the rent, they've stopped that, so they've either to gerra job, to help put supplement to pay in the, you know, their housing accommodation, or they've got to stop school. In summer holidays, er, the grant don't   (.) they take that six weeks 
*ALB:	Off the grant. 
*JUN:	off the grant, so that actually they get six weeks money less, through the year, than they should do, where they're used to paying all through year 
*ALB:	For twelve months, now they don't. 
*JUN:	 Now, they don't get anything for that six weeks that they're not at school. 
*KAR:	No. 
*JUN:	So, you know, any girl that's not living at 'ome. She got to go out and work for that six weeks, to, to earn the money   (  ) feed the  (  )  
*ALB:	And where can you get that bloody kind of money, only   (  ) corner. 
*KAR:	Yeah, but where can you get a job. 
*JUN:	Well, that's it. 
*KAR:	Where can you job. 
*ALB:	Well, it's forcing the girls on to streets, ain't it. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	 (  ) corner. 
*JUN:	I mean, they're begging 'em you to ke  they're begging you to keep 'em on at school, and yet you can't get no help to keep 'em on. 
*KAR:	It's like other day, (  ) we were talking to this bloke like, and he were on about businesses, says you can't underst  , oh he said something about finances, (  ) how difficult it is to get finance to start a business up   (  ) and er, he said, I know, he said you can't me, he said. You seen all these adverts about starting your own business, you know, governments like, you know, doing all these courses and making it out as though it's it's dead easy to get fi  , you know   (  ) hitting your head against a brick wall 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	The only way you can start a business, is by starting it without insurance 
*JUN:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	straight off your own back, and then, you know, after it's running, get insurance. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	That ho  ninety five per cent of firms do that. 
*JUN:	  (  ) regulate. I mean it's   (  )   
*ALB:	 I mean, look at laddo round there what's been broke into. He's no insurance   (.) no insurance whatsoever, 'cos he couldn't afford it. 
*KAR:	I know. Ours is gonna us about a thousand pound for insurance. 
*JUN:	Oh. 
*ALB:	Well, a thousand pounds not a lot, Karen, but er   (.) it all depends what the, what what you gonna be insured for? 
*SAS:	It's not. 
*ALB:	I mean, even that, you're gonna you you gonna be insured for breaking in and break-ins and 
*KAR:	Yeah, I think it's everything. I think it's    (  )   
*ALB:	 That's what I mean, so what you're actually getting  for your, thousand pound isn't a lot of money. 
*KAR:	No. I think it's covered for like, like you say, like for some reason, say you had a fire, and you had to stop work. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	I think it's covered for that. Covered for personal injury, er, covered for hundred thousand, for like, that's what trailers, (  ) they've got   (  ) trailers in. It's covered for everything. 
*ALB:	I mean, you imagine somebody breaking in and setting fire to a trailer. 
*KAR:	I mean, it's a lot of money when you think Norma's paying nine hundred pound just for her car. For that Cabriolet. To me, you think phew a thousand pound, but cer  I mean, it's it ain't really very much, no. 
*JUN:	It's a high insurance for a car. 
*ALB:	What for car? 
*JUN:	 (  ) yeah. 
*KAR:	Right  (  )  
*ALB:	What how how comes that, then? 
*KAR:	Because, well, Cabriolet's are classed as dangerous, aren't they, because they're   (.) soft roofed. 
*ALB:	Oh, aye. 
*KAR:	It's not got no  (.)  
*JUN:	Aye, this  (  )  
*KAR:	Yeah, (  ) she's only been driving a year, two years. 
*ALB:	Soft top, yeah. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*ALB:	Well, I mean, look at our Connie's. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*ALB:	Three hundred and eighty for third  (  )  
*JUN:	Our Connie's were five hundred and seventy. 
*ALB:	 (  ) 
*JUN:	Now it's gone up to five hundred and seventy because that accident. 
*ALB:	I mean, when you look at it, it's for a third party fire and theft. Christ, that's gonna be a thousand pounds on a full comprehensive, just about. 
*KAR:	I know. 
*SAS:	I'm still  (  )  
*JUN:	Are ya. 
*ALB:	Well, I I I'll promise not to fondle. ((laugh))  
*JUN:	 (  ) need to tell her.

*SAS:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALB:	I don't know. Tell the truth innit. 
*KAR:	Aye.

*ALB:	It's only one like you had for    (  )   
*JUN:	 He does make  a lot of dust. (  )  
*KAR:	I thought, when, last time I were here, I kept thinking, well, why's he only doing it, 'cos I know he never done it before. When I thought, he says to Colin, I said, (  ) bird, you know, like, when something started to  (.)  
*ALB:	Wet your fingers  (  )  
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	Mind, er  (.)  
*ALB:	Might be dust. 
*KAR:	Mm. I'm not worn no make-up for ages, 'cos me eyes seem to be like, itching all of a sudden. 
*ALB:	Aye. 
*KAR:	So whether it's just that as well. 
*JUN:	Well, it can't be 'im, 'cos we always had    (  )   
*KAR:	 Yeah. 
*JUN:	 (.) it's gotta be 'im. 
*KAR:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	You bald headed mutt, aren't ya   (.) George. Old baldy. 
*SAS:	He's   (.) can he talk? 
*JUN:	Yeah.

*JUN:	Benji, come off. 
*SAS:	 (  ) 
*KAR:	I didn't, I mean, I don't like small   (  ) the right brightly coloured or what, but it looked like it were coloured like this, like this kind of colouring. 
*ALB:	Yeah. 
*JUN:	It it's blue. I'm sure, she said it's blue. 
*ALB:	It's got some cream in it as well ain't it. 
*KAR:	Well, (  ) more, so I couldn't see, but I just, to me it was just like er, thought it was like minky coloured. But mind ya, (  ) more like a, but what I was gonna say is, 
*ALB:	 Suppose to be a   (  ) but I mean   
*KAR:	 On back of it, on back of it, she's got like all them tapestry pictures laid over back of it. 
*JUN:	Yeah. 
*KAR:	She got, same on chairs, all, you can hardly see the suite, 'cos she's got, she says, and er, I says to her, I says to her, oh it's nice your suite, innit. She says yeah, if I can keep it clean, she got all cushions covered up, well like er, er    (  )   
*ALB:	 Keep it clean, there's only them two buggers. 
*KAR:	I know, but what's the point of having a new suite, and having old covers on it like that. 
*JUN:	They make me laugh, when they sit in 'ouse with blanket round them, so they don't have to turn 'eating up. 
*SAS:	I don't  (  )
