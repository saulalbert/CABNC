*ADR:	That's right yeah 
*MAR:	four different little net things of nuts
*ADR:	Yeah.

*TER:	Yes 
*MAR:	Yeah we saw that 
*ADR:	have you seen that?
*TER:	Yeah 
*MAR:	yeah.
*TER:	I don't think our squirrel is anything like as inte as intelligent as that one.
*MAR:	 (        ) that one 
*ADR:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ADR:	Well that one really is I mean cos I see them up in the woods quite a lot   (        ) 
*MAR:	Yeah, yeah 
*ADR:	cos the dog chases them   (        ) before she's got anywhere near them   (        ) 
*MAR:	That's right yeah.When when we have my daughter's dog with us
*ADR:	Yeah
*MAR:	erm she just takes off and  (        ) 
*ADR:	Yeah, that's right, yeah.
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*TER:	If she had one wish in life it would be that she could climb trees. ((laugh)) 
*ADR:	 [laughing] Yeah   [] I suppose so, yeah.Well she, she'll take cats on  (        ) 
*MAR:	Oh yeah
*ADR:	I think she thinks they're rabbits
*MAR:	Yeah?
*ADR:	I'm sure she does
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ADR:	but er    (.)  (        ) what's she seen?She'll go up up the path   (        ) and all I could see was this cat, and it was hanging on for dear life up this big tree and there 
*MAR:	Yeah, yeah 
*ADR:	was she sat at the bottom you know 
*MAR:	Oh yes   (        ) 
*ADR:	thinking oh
*MAR:	well Jess, Jess will sort of, if a cat came into our garden, she'd see it off 
*ADR:	Yeah well then we don't get cats in our garden cos she, she, they know she's there and then
*MAR:	she would see it off in no time at all.
*ADR:	Mm.
*MAR:	But we seem to er where we live erm at the top of Church Road
*ADR:	Yeah I know yes, yeah 
*MAR:	you're going down into   (        ) park
*ADR:	Yeah
*MAR:	whole lot of those sort of big houses have been converted into flats 
*ADR:	Flats yeah, yeah.
*MAR:	and erm I think there must be some people there who have brought cats in because all of a sudden there are a whole lot of cats about which there weren't before you see 
*ADR:	Cats, oh yeah I see, no that's right.
*MAR:	so that er they, they haven't learned to keep   [laughing] out of our garden yet    []  ((laugh)) 
*ADR:	But they have to in our garden because erm I know the first   (        ) she was a   (        ) the one we've got and the first day me husband brought her he went up to fetch her out the kennel and she sort of saw this cat and it's a   (        ) 
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ADR:	one it's   (        ) just over the fence and that   (.)  (        ) 
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ADR:	and there was this ginger and white cat hanging on to our fence 
*MAR:	 [laughing] on for dear life   [] 
*ADR:	 (        ) you know she walked straight to me again and    [laughing]  (        )  [] 
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ADR:	But she doesn't come in the garden now   (        ) 
*MAR:	 [laughing] Aah   []
