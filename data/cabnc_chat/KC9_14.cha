*DIN:	Where's the  (        ) .
*GIN:	Beg your pardon, you're right
*DIN:	I didn't recognise it, it hasn't got any leaves on.
*GIN:	I beg your pardon, it does look like a Beech bowl doesn't it?
*DIN:	Yeah it does, (        ) .
*GIN:	Yes, you're quite right it is.No up where the other's are, where they've just hidden in the bushes, I found sum brand new ones on Wednesday or Thur , after we had the heavy rain   (.) Why we going this way?
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh, I'm very fond of the meadow walk   (.) get any more wild  (        ) , (        ) actually, I suppose there are rabbits and things up here.
*DIN:	But there are.
*GIN:	We should come one day at dusk and the bunny hoppers will be out, or of course very early in the morning.
*DIN:	Why, you wouldn't come very early in the morning.
*GIN:	 ((laugh)) .
*DIN:	 (        ) . (        ) brooks lovely isn't it?
*GIN:	The what?
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh yes.
*DIN:	I don't think I've ever been to  (        ) , quite pleasant   (        ) .
*GIN:	Surely that's the , that is the house where Queen Elizabeth the first spent all her girl hood.
*DIN:	I've no idea.
*GIN:	 (        )  (.) perhaps it was burnt down and re-built or something   (        ) didn't seem at all tudorish did it?
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	 (        ) .You think all the big houses in London that are now   (        ) official Government   (        ) all along the strand big private houses, Savoy Palace, The  (        ) .
*DIN:	Mm.
*GIN:	Way back in the thirteen, fourteenth century.
*DIN:	Mm.
*GIN:	And your name sake Barnard of Bolier that's his palace opposite on the other bank of the Thames.
*DIN:	Mm   (.)  (        ) .I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
*GIN:	Eighty gardens, oh   (        ) made me laugh.
*DIN:	Well that's not what amazes me, eighty gardens.
*GIN:	Eighty gardens, but then as a place that size, and the didn't have any machinery don't forget everything had to be 
*DIN:	Well I expect now, they've got about five .
*GIN:	I should think they probably still, in the, in the high season, I should think they probably still need fifteen, twenty 
*DIN:	Oh look, (        ) tractor   (        ) .
*GIN:	I think it still belongs to the Duke of Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end wasn't he?
*DIN:	Mm.
*GIN:	And he said they have to systematically sell something to keep the place up.
*DIN:	Mm.
*GIN:	But if they can use that er beautiful water  (.) 
*DIN:	Ah right.
*GIN:	to generate their own electricity, save them a bomb and they can sell some as well.I know a lot of people say they shouldn't 
*DIN:	Good idea .
*GIN:	have houses that size, but I think it's an awful shame to let our heritage go.
*DIN:	Yeah, I agree, if people did  (        ) .
*GIN:	I tell you another thing that amazes me, how any one with a Sovereign right, (        ) were a Sovereign in those days, could have given up the palace of Westminster which is so beautiful, (        ) palace, together I suppose reigned after the Duke of   (        ) is it?
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	It was only built erm, what a couple of hundred years ago wasn't it?
*DIN:	What Buckingham Palace?
*GIN:	Mm.
*DIN:	I don't know, I didn't realise.
*GIN:	At Kensington, Kensington palace, but the palace of Westminster I think is the most beautiful building
*DIN:	Mm.
*GIN:	and of course they had the Thames which was their main highway, Thames was much easier to use than 
*DIN:	Well that was Buckingham Palace was er  (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh yes.
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	Oh yeah.
*DIN:	 (        ) .
*GIN:	I think Buckingham Palace is lovely compared to Westminster Palace, beautiful old stone and the, and the shape of it and it's windows, it's beautiful   (.) huge of course, there again the court then had loads and loads of er, there were ten  (        ) .
*DIN:	 ((laugh)) . (        ) .
*GIN:	And a lot of the Government, Governing people of the country   (.) Oh it is a bit chill and damp isn't it?Did you mention anything to your dad about wanting to watch   (.) Dances with Wolves?
*DIN:	Ah, I wouldn't of imagine for one second he would want to watch, so it might be better if I buy the video and see   (        ) 
*GIN:	No, no ,
