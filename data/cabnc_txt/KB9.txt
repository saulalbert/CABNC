Annette (PS1CX)            [80] Er, I don't need this do I if you've got that?
Tracy (PS1D1)              [81] Sorry we just thought it's better than carrying
                           her around.
Annette (PS1CX)            [82] Yeah okay just if it ... [cough] ... Hello
                           Becky Boo what have you got on eh? ...
Tracy (PS1D1)              [83] There was a horse running round and we got held
                           up with traffic.
Annette (PS1CX)            [84] Where at?
Tracy (PS1D1)              [85] There'd been an accident right outside [...]
                           Park, anyway there was some lad, I don't know was
                           he, is he or what, but he's on a horse and it's only
                           a baby, and I think it's thrown him and there's
Annette (PS1CX)            [86] Ah
Tracy (PS1D1)              [87] all bit and everything's come out so of course
                           the horse is running around free and he's trying to
                           catch it
Annette (PS1CX)            [88] he's trying to catch it spooking it even more
                           and
Tracy (PS1D1)              [89] A woman with a Jag parked in the middle of the
                           road and a caravan and what have ya
Annette (PS1CX)            [laugh]
Tracy (PS1D1)              [90] so they're trying to corner it and it's
                           munching on grass quite happily, you could see it
                           was watching a minute, but it was watching them away
                           and I think er any minute it's looking out the
                           corner of its eye and then it's just gonna go when
                           he sees it getting closer.
Annette (PS1CX)            [91] Do, shall I get one of these for David just to
                           jot down the hours?
Unknown speaker (KB9PSUNK) [92] Yeah
Tracy (PS1D1)              [93] I was just saying
Annette (PS1CX)            [94] I just saying that something like that,
                           something cheap, that doesn't matter if it gets
                           mucked up.
David (PS1D0)              [95] Oh that'll do.
Annette (PS1CX)            [96] One of those, okay ... Tracy ... what, what
                           about a calculator?
Tracy (PS1D1)              [97] Not into that
Annette (PS1CX)            [98] Could do with bigger buttons
Tracy (PS1D1)              [99] It's a bit gory colours, but [...] ... That's a
                           good'un.
Annette (PS1CX)            [100] That one?
Tracy (PS1D1)              [101] Yeah, well you'll need one as well won't ya?
Annette (PS1CX)            [102] Erm I'm gonna have to manage with little ones
                           for the time being.
Tracy (PS1D1)              [103] Oh you get that and use that and then if
                           there's any invoices to do I'll borrow it or would
                           you rather have one of those? ...
Annette (PS1CX)            [104] It's not really
Tracy (PS1D1)              [105] They're quite good it looks better than them
                           for office don't it? ... they're dual power battery
                           and solar
Annette (PS1CX)            [106] Oh so
Tracy (PS1D1)              [107] that's the same
Annette (PS1CX)            [108] that's same isn't it?
Tracy (PS1D1)              [109] Yeah, I suppose like if you're not in any
                           bright lights you can have it on the battery

                           father used to be a lot like David and he used to
                           get terrible headaches and it used to end up in a
                           really bad nosebleed and he started giving blood
                           regular and it stopped it.
                           [863] Apparently the body, his body was making too
                           much blood and the only way that he could release it
                           was by building, by nosebleeds ... it don't make
                           sense does it?

                           either pay cash and get your sixteen percent off
                           free ... or you can pay terms from July.

                           [1767] Yeah, well I'll probably pay cash, it's just

                           you want.
                           [1774] But there's nothing to stop you, if you take
                           it out on terms, there's absolutely nothing to stop
                           you coming in and paying, as long as you pay ...
                           before July, or by July ... you get

Tracy (PS1D1)              [1780] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [1781] I mean, I know it's sort of the cheapest

                [2271] Thirty days.
                [2272] But they're not paying thirty days.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [2273] I've just explained that to him.
                [2274] And he said he didn't know that, that he would get hold
                of Sen and ring me first thing, thing in the morning ... er, to
                tell me why Sen hasn't paid.
                [2275] He's got the invoice and everything.
                [2276] I said well you've sent us twenty thou ... I said there
                is no V A T on it which it should be!
                [2277] Deary me!
                [2278] He says.
                [2279] Has he got the invoi ?
                [2280] I said yes.
                [2281] And I said, we've been having, having the invoice
                outstanding since October at two and half thousand pound!
                [2282] I said, you actually owe me six thousand, one hundred
                and odd!
                [2283] And I said, you must realize I've a small company, and
                that's, in one respect that I've had to send those conditions
                because you're failing to meet the agreed thirty days payment!
Annette (PS1CX) [2284] Yeah.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [2285] And I said it's not on!
                [2286] I said we couldn't survive like that.
                [2287] And he said, well would you like to carry on with the
                contract?
                [2288] I said we're too far committed now to, I says to back
                out.
                [2289] I said, you know, we can't back out at this stage.
                [2290] And I said, but I said if there isn't the payments of
                the invoice when they are sent ... then ... you know, we've go
                you've gotta look at it.
                [2291] So that invoice wants
Annette (PS1CX) [2292] Doing.
                [2293] Yeah.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [2294] it wants doing and sending, and put in i put twenty
                eight days on.
Annette (PS1CX) [2295] Yeah.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [2296] Had to be paid, it can't be paid by the twenty eighth
                it's er ... you know ... well if I could've got hold of David
                or er, Andrew , I was gonna give Andrew a right bollocking for
                just pushing it in and he should've sent it to er, Michael ,
                Michael 's just got it shoved in front of his nose a in
                Edinburgh.
                [2297] He's just gone in to see if everything's alright at
                Edinburgh ... and of course, that's why he's had to report for
                that.
                [2298] Which was fair play to him, but bloody Andrew should
                have told him!
                [2299] It's agreed, the system of stage payments, it's all
                written to him.
Annette (PS1CX) [2300] And you've just spoken to him have you?
Tracy (PS1D1)   [2301] I've just spoken to Michael .

Annette (PS1CX) [2303] And you, you ... so he understands after he's sent you
                this?

                because you're failing to meet the standard agreement, you're
                not paying within the twenty eight days or the thirty days!
Annette (PS1CX) [2308] Mm.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [2309] I said I've got an invoice outstanding for October, and
                I said I can't afford to do that!
                [2310] He said, I realize that.
                [2311] Then he said, we wou want you to do that work he said,
                because you've got a good reputation.
                [2312] ... It makes, you know, if we ... we're not gonna go
                bust just to get twelve months bloody work out of him on a
                service contract!

                said, if they wanted that money back tomorrow we could only
                give them half that money back because of what we've got
Annette (PS1CX) [2314] Mm.

Annette (PS1CX)            [3217] Mm.
David (PS1D0)              [3218] you've done very well!
                           [3219] Haven't you really?
                           [3220] Your first ... your first year.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3221] Yeah we did well but erm ... we shouldn't
                           have ... like, you learn by your mistakes, but we
                           ... we kind of made profit and we shouldn't of done
David (PS1D0)              [3222] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3223] erm, and now the tax man has hammered us so
                           hard
David (PS1D0)              [3224] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3225] that we're really struggling!
David (PS1D0)              [3226] Yeah.
                           [3227] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3228] And we're really having to struggle to sort
                           of make ends meet.
David (PS1D0)              [3229] Yeah.
                           [3230] I know what you mean.
                           [3231] You ... it's a diffi it's difficult
Annette (PS1CX)            [3232] It's wrong int it?
David (PS1D0)              [3233] just striking up that balance int it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3234] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3235] Isn't it really?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3236] And of course, now they ... when we
                           originally moved in here we asked about the rates
                           and they said oh they co they wouldn't raise it
                           because it was an unfinished project
David (PS1D0)              [3237] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3238] and nobody had paid rates, and they wouldn't
                           pay rates until they'd actually finished building on
                           the land opposite.
David (PS1D0)              [3239] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3240] Anyway, when the accountant came in to do the
                           books ... he said er, oh he said you've got to pay
                           something.
                           [3241] So he said, I'll get onto them myself.
                           [3242] Anyway, apparently, he was told exactly the
                           same thing as I was told
David (PS1D0)              [3243] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3244] but of course, it had kind of stirred up a
                           hornets' nest!
                           [3245] Next thing they were down with the measuring
                           up and we'd just got a four thousand pound rate
                           bill!
                           [3246] And, they've actually rated it at ten and a
                           half thousand ... erm ... payable
David (PS1D0)              [3247] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3248] three thousand eight, and of course, well
                           Neil said there's V A T, I didn't think you had to
                           pay V A T on rates?
David (PS1D0)              [3249] I didn't, I didn't, you know, I don't
Annette (PS1CX)            [3250] You know?
David (PS1D0)              [3251] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3252] Er ... anyway ... so tha that's sort of you
                           know, made
David (PS1D0)              [3253] Mm.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3254] a big difference.
                           [3255] That's suddenly four thousand a year we've to
                           find.
David (PS1D0)              [3256] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3257] I mean, if, it's crippling us is this place!
David (PS1D0)              [3258] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3259] If it wasn't for this we could be ... it
                           would be quite good.
David (PS1D0)              [3260] Yeah.
                           [3261] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3262] But what can you do, there's nothing else
                           about?
David (PS1D0)              [3263] No it's ... that's it.
                           [3264] And a lot of businesses up and down are er
                           ... are in a bad way, really.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3265] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3266] Some very ... sailing very close to the wind.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3267] Yeah.
                           [3268] They're all finding it hard aren't they?
David (PS1D0)              [3269] Well, there's less and less work ... and the
                           work that does seem to be about ... is that
                           competitively priced that
Annette (PS1CX)            [3270] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3271] you know, it's negible whether you can make
                           anything even if
Annette (PS1CX)            [3272] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3273] you get the work.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3274] Yeah.
                           [3275] And then of course er ... money is floating
                           round very quickly.
                           [3276] No.
                           [3277] No.
                           [3278] I er, in fact, we, yeah, we just had a
                           problem yesterday, we started work for the Royal
                           Scotsman ... and ... erm ... well we started work
                           for them, like last year and we've been doing jobs
David (PS1D0)              [3279] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3280] and we've had invoices outstanding since
                           October.
David (PS1D0)              [3281] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3282] So Neil said, well ... these invoices weren't
                           forthcoming, so I said to them, the thing, the thing
                           is, if we start work and we buy a load of equipment
                           ... how are we gonna ... sort of, how long's the
                           cheque gonna, gonna be coming in, you know.
David (PS1D0)              [3283] And you have to fund it.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3284] So we asked for twenty thousand pound
                           upfront.
David (PS1D0)              [3285] Tt!
Annette (PS1CX)            [3286] So, anyway, and they said, and before we wi
                           we get this twenty thousand we also want the ou
                           October's invoices clearing up as well.
                           [3287] So, that was ... great.
                           [3288] Anyway, we've waited and waited ... we've
                           rung and we've rung!
                           [3289] Eventually a cheque came, instead of being
                           like, for six thousands er, nearly seven thousand it
                           came for four!
David (PS1D0)              [3290] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3291] Erm, the twenty thousand eventually arrived,
                           no V A T.
                           [3292] You know
David (PS1D0)              [3293] Yes.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3294] and all this sort of things.
                           [3295] So, of course, we were getting a little bit
                           panicky ... cos what's worrying me, and it still
                           worries me ... again ... we've put all this time and
                           effort in ... they may pay us ... alright, we've got
                           this twenty, they may pay us a second payment, but
                           are they gonna pay up on the third?
David (PS1D0)              [3296] Well tha that's always the catch isn't it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3297] You know?
David (PS1D0)              [3298] The last one.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3299] Yeah.
                           [3300] So we actually wrote down ... erm ... th the
                           equipment that we were buying was ours until paid
                           for in full.
David (PS1D0)              [3301] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3302] By them.
David (PS1D0)              [3303] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3304] And we sent this letter up to them.
                           [3305] Well we've had their director on the phone,
                           phone yesterday ... and more or less demanded his
                           twenty thousand back
David (PS1D0)              [3306] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3307] and, if you don't want the work we'll take it
                           elsewhere and all this.
David (PS1D0)              [3308] Mm.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3309] Erm
David (PS1D0)              [3310] Puts you off doesn't it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3311] Well I mean, what on earth do you do?
David (PS1D0)              [3312] Yeah.
                           [3313] Very difficult isn't it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3314] You just ... well Ne both Neil and I have
                           sort of felt well, to be quite honest it isn't worth
                           it.
David (PS1D0)              [3315] Yeah.
                           [3316] For what you make at the end of the day on,
                           on somebody's [...]
Annette (PS1CX)            [3317] No it's not worth it.
                           [3318] It
David (PS1D0)              [3319] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3320] well it, the running the business isn't I
                           don't think ... because by the time ... the tax
                           man's hammered you
David (PS1D0)              [3321] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3322] you know, the V A T man wants his money, I
                           mean the V A T man's been paid for all these
                           invoices
David (PS1D0)              [3323] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3324] and I still haven't got the money in.
David (PS1D0)              [3325] Yeah.
                           [3326] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3327] You know.
                           [3328] Everything's against you!
David (PS1D0)              [3329] Really V A T's, I think, and I think it
                           should only be paid when it, when the invoices
Annette (PS1CX)            [3330] Exactly!
David (PS1D0)              [3331] have been cleared, rather than always paying
Annette (PS1CX)            [3332] Exactly!
David (PS1D0)              [3333] for that quarter
Annette (PS1CX)            [3334] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3335] even if you've not got paid.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3336] Yeah.
                           [3337] Exactly!
                           [3338] Erm ... mm, I don't know whether there's any
                           way round it ... but ... that's sort of the set up
                           that they gave us when we started and I guess I'll
                           have to ... sort of conform to that, but ... it
David (PS1D0)              [3339] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3340] does seem unfair.
David (PS1D0)              [3341] Yeah.
                           [3342] That's right.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3343] I mean now there's a couple of people
                           quibbling about actually paying ... at the [...]
                           that we did.
David (PS1D0)              [3344] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3345] There's still six hundred and odd pound
                           outstanding.
                           [3346] Erm ... I can't honestly see us ever getting
                           that.
David (PS1D0)              [3347] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3348] Erm ... the funiculars ... they're quibbling
                           about the final payment.
David (PS1D0)              [3349] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3350] About them being late and everything else.
                           [3351] Er, you know, it's just a, and I've paid for
                           that and that and
David (PS1D0)              [3352] There's extenuating circumstances like that
Annette (PS1CX)            [3353] Oh dear!
David (PS1D0)              [3354] though isn't there?
                           [3355] As Neil said.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3356] Well yeah!
David (PS1D0)              [3357] Changes in specification
Annette (PS1CX)            [3358] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3359] er, equipment coming in late, er
Annette (PS1CX)            [3360] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3361] you know, I mean
Annette (PS1CX)            [3362] They don't seem to ... want to know though.
                           [3363] I mean, Neil's tried to explain to them ...
                           that, they were late with drawings and everything
                           else, it put us way behind in the beginning.
David (PS1D0)              [3364] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3365] But all, you know, they've just not listened
                           to him!
David (PS1D0)              [3366] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3367] So
David (PS1D0)              [3368] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3369] I guess it'll
David (PS1D0)              [3370] It's er stal stalling ... they're
Annette (PS1CX)            [3371] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3372] cos that's all it's doing innit?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3373] Yeah.
                           [3374] Well solicitor said she, it sounded to her as
                           if there's something more ... to it.
                           [3375] Maybe they don't have the money.
David (PS1D0)              [3376] Yeah.
                           [3377] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3378] And they're stalling all the time.
David (PS1D0)              [3379] Yeah.
                           [3380] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3381] But erm ... you see, they suggested going
                           down for a meeting ... he's up to his eyes in it!
David (PS1D0)              [3382] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3383] And
David (PS1D0)              [3384] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3385] he can't honestly spare time to go down there
David (PS1D0)              [3386] It's costing you money isn't it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3387] Well yeah
David (PS1D0)              [3388] And chase your own ... what's due to
Annette (PS1CX)            [3389] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3390] you.
                           [3391] That's, that's the [...] .
Annette (PS1CX)            [3392] And we know you're gonna have an argument.
                           [3393] So is it worth it?
David (PS1D0)              [3394] Yeah.
                           [3395] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3396] I, I, I personally feel that ... give it to
                           solicitor and let her deal with it, because
David (PS1D0)              [3397] Yeah.
                           [3398] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3399] just not worth the hassle.
                           [3400] Alright
David (PS1D0)              [3401] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3402] that's gonna cost
David (PS1D0)              [3403] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3404] but, but I mean you can only make it worse by
                           ... like you say, you're wasting your own time and
                           money
David (PS1D0)              [3405] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3406] you're not gonna get anywhere!
David (PS1D0)              [3407] Yeah.
                           [3408] Yeah.
                           [3409] All gets
Annette (PS1CX)            [3410] I mean
David (PS1D0)              [3411] a bit acrimonious doesn't it?
                           [3412] And er
Annette (PS1CX)            [3413] Yeah.
                           [3414] Don't it?
David (PS1D0)              [3415] er that sort of thing starts happening.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3416] Oh it's painful!
David (PS1D0)              [3417] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3418] It really is painful!
David (PS1D0)              [3419] Yeah.
                           [3420] It's getting ever more difficult isn't it?
                           [3421] Doing
Annette (PS1CX)            [3422] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3423] business.
                           [3424] Ever more.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3425] Yeah.
                           [3426] You just ... I,th all this bumph about sort
                           of trying to help small businesses and, things like
                           that, they do nothing!
David (PS1D0)              [3427] No.
                           [3428] No I know that.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3429] They do nothing at all!
David (PS1D0)              [3430] Yeah.
                           [3431] No it's er ... as you say, all, all the cards
                           are stacked i in
Annette (PS1CX)            [3432] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3433] such a way that it makes it ever more
                           difficult.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3434] Yeah.
                           [3435] The trouble is, see ... you know, you've
                           nobody you can go to, you, you've nobody that sort
                           of will listen to
David (PS1D0)              [3436] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3437] to all this and do something about it higher
                           up.
David (PS1D0)              [3438] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3439] I mean they just keep hammering and hammering
                           and more and more are going out of business.
David (PS1D0)              [3440] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3441] Alright,th the ... saying in the paper,
                           they're talking about ... stopping these big
                           companies, keeping these little companies waiting
                           ... there could be something they can do about that,
                           but how long is it going to be before they do
                           something?
David (PS1D0)              [3442] Yeah.
                           [3443] Yeah.
                           [3444] It's a
Annette (PS1CX)            [3445] In the meantime ... there's more and more
                           going bust every week!
David (PS1D0)              [3446] Well the trouble is, a lot of these MPs and
                           ... people on these committees ... are actually ...
                           they've got seats on the boards of a lot of these
                           big companies
Annette (PS1CX)            [3447] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3448] so it's not in their interests to push this
                           through.
                           [3449] The longer they can stall ... something
Annette (PS1CX)            [3450] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3451] like that
Annette (PS1CX)            [3452] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3453] er, you know, the better it is, and
                           particularly when you look at the ... the fever that
                           there is at the moment about ... electioneering
Annette (PS1CX)            [3454] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3455] is, is no big business isn't it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3456] No, that's true.
                           [3457] I mean maybe I should go and see local ...
                           erm ... MP or
David (PS1D0)              [3458] Local M P.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3459] whatever and, and, about the rates.
David (PS1D0)              [3460] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3461] And see, you know, if they can do something
                           about that, maybe it'd be right time.
David (PS1D0)              [3462] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3463] Bu cos we're actually the only ones that have
                           their rate bill ... Barry's hasn't.
David (PS1D0)              [3464] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3465] So, you know, they're
David (PS1D0)              [3466] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3467] just expecting us to pay!
David (PS1D0)              [3468] Yeah.
                           [3469] Yeah.
                           [3470] I would.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3471] And it's ... Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3472] That's what they're there for!
Annette (PS1CX)            [3473] Well, yeah that's true!
David (PS1D0)              [3474] Whether you've voted for them or not.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3475] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3476] And , you know ... in fact
Annette (PS1CX)            [3477] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3478] you pay your taxes and, and
Annette (PS1CX)            [3479] Yeah, it's very true that.
David (PS1D0)              [3480] you know, it can have [...] .
Annette (PS1CX)            [3481] I might do that.
David (PS1D0)              [3482] Yeah.
                           [3483] Because if, if they've singled yourself out,
                           it's, obviously, it's not right is it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3484] No it's not.
                           [3485] Well I said, well I'm not paying mine until
                           somebody else gets theirs.
David (PS1D0)              [3486] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3487] And have to pay theirs.
David (PS1D0)              [3488] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3489] But erm ... I suppose next thing'll be a
                           court demand and, how d'ya fight that?
David (PS1D0)              [3490] Yeah.

                           [3503] At least there isn't the same hassle as there
                           was at Calpers
David (PS1D0)              [3504] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3505] I mean ... alright, yes, you sort of have
                           worries, but most of the time, I mean, for all last
                           year it's run pretty well.
David (PS1D0)              [3506] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3507] It's only just recently that we sort of
                           starting our de we've had bits of aggro.
David (PS1D0)              [3508] Yeah.
                           [3509] Or at least, like
Annette (PS1CX)            [3510] So
David (PS1D0)              [3511] with this,a all the benefits are, you ... get
                           them personally don't you?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3512] Yeah.
                           [3513] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3514] Er rather than
Annette (PS1CX)            [3515] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3516] doing the same amount of hours er and
                           somebody else benefiting?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3517] That's it!
                           [3518] Yeah, that's it.
David (PS1D0)              [3519] Yeah.
                           [3520] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3521] I mean, it's, like his car for instance, I
                           mean, that's always been a dream he never thought
                           he'd ever be able to afford ... a new car, erm
David (PS1D0)              [3522] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3523] you know?
David (PS1D0)              [3524] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3525] And er, of course that's like a dream come
                           true for Neil, so
David (PS1D0)              [3526] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3527] that's
David (PS1D0)              [3528] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3529] why we want to make a success and he
                           [laughing] don't lose it all [] !
David (PS1D0)              [3530] Well, you know, you've got to have er
                           benefits of, of ... taking a course of action like
                           this haven't you?
                           [3531] Because
Annette (PS1CX)            [3532] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3533] otherwise ... you know
Annette (PS1CX)            [3534] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3535] what's the point?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3536] That's it.
David (PS1D0)              [3537] What's the point?
                           [3538] I mean i
Annette (PS1CX)            [3539] That's it.
David (PS1D0)              [3540] It's not that people want to get rich, it's
                           just that you make a nice living and ... enjoy
Annette (PS1CX)            [3541] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3542] what you like doing and that's it.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3543] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3544] You know?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3545] Yeah.
                           [3546] Yeah, can well do without the sort of, the
                           hassle and the aggro.
                           [3547] I mean, Calpers have made it ... a lot worse
                           for us.
David (PS1D0)              [3548] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3549] They have.
                           [3550] They've done
David (PS1D0)              [3551] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3552] everything possible to make life difficult!
David (PS1D0)              [3553] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3554] But er ... hopefully they'll leave us alone
                           soon.
                           [3555] But it doesn't help when we bring people like
                           Geoff you see, cos Geoff comes from Calpers
David (PS1D0)              [3556] Oh I don't, oh right.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3557] Oh yeah.
                           [3558] He did.
David (PS1D0)              [3559] I de I didn't recognize him.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3560] Really angry ... about it because they've had
                           to bring somebody else in to do ... Geoff's work.
David (PS1D0)              [3561] Yeah.
                           [3562] Yeah.
                           [3563] Right.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3564] So ... I mean it was Geoff's choice.
David (PS1D0)              [3565] Yeah.
                           [3566] Well, this is it, I mean, people ... you
                           can't make people do things, I mean, they've got to
Annette (PS1CX)            [3567] No.
David (PS1D0)              [3568] want to do it haven't they?
                           [3569] So
Annette (PS1CX)            [3570] Yeah.
                           [3571] This
David (PS1D0)              [3572] well
Annette (PS1CX)            [3573] is it.
David (PS1D0)              [3574] we've done very little there.
                           [3575] They ju just don't seem to be doing any steel
                           work at all.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3576] No.
                           [3577] Well, everybody keeps telling us they're not
                           doing anything.
                           [3578] They just don't know how they're surviving
                           but they keep going on!
David (PS1D0)              [3579] Yeah.
                           [3580] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3581] The man, he must have plenty of money to keep
                           it, carrying it
David (PS1D0)              [3582] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3583] as he is doing.
David (PS1D0)              [3584] Yeah.
                           [3585] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3586] But er
David (PS1D0)              [3587] no doubt it'll all come out in ... fullness
                           of time
Annette (PS1CX)            [3588] Well yeah
David (PS1D0)              [3589] won't it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3590] It will won't it?
                           [3591] Yeah.
David (PS1D0)              [3592] Things can't carry on indefinitely ... in any
                           business
Annette (PS1CX)            [3593] No.
David (PS1D0)              [3594] where nothing's being produced, can it?
Annette (PS1CX)            [3595] No.
                           [3596] Oh well he's, he's told the lads that ...
                           it's only a matter of time.
                           [3597] I think that's ... what more or less decided
                           Geoff that, yeah, he would take it.
David (PS1D0)              [3598] [...] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3599] But erm
David (PS1D0)              [3600] There you go.

David (PS1D0)              [3605] know, do a bit of everything.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3606] Well it means, you see, apparently Geoff's
                           done all the air braking at Calpers it means that
                           Neil can actually ... some of the time, be here ...
                           rather

                           [3610] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX)            [3611] Well , cos David really doesn't know anything
                           ... about the air braking or anything like that.
David (PS1D0)              [3612] Right.

                           us and had a few bits and baps off us, so
Annette (PS1CX)            [3624] Mm.

                           [3626] Yeah, cos er, I think Neil was telling you
                           that, they look as if they're gonna be buying plenty
                           of gas off us if we, when we start taking the air
                           products.

                           [3657] It's alright them asking you Teresa, but ...
                           you know, they, they should be prepared to pay you
                           more.

                an easy life you know.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [laugh]
Annette (PS1CX) [3898] There's nothing else to do all day but swan around.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3899] Who?
Annette (PS1CX) [laugh]
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3900] Who said that?
Annette (PS1CX) [3901] Well most people think we do.
                [3902] ... Feel like cutting myself down the middle!
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3903] Yeah.
                [3904] He's coming out.
Annette (PS1CX) [3905] Yeah.
                [3906] Hey they must have had a good meal other night.
                [3907] They spent eighty odd pound on a meal!
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3908] I asked him ... [...] ... did you have a sweet?
                [3909] He said, no, he said th that you could either have one
                or the other.
Annette (PS1CX) [3910] It was a lot weren't it for
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3911] They have a sweet or a starters, but they didn't have
                them both.
Annette (PS1CX) [3912] There's one at sixty odd which is, I think ri quite
                reasonable for three but ... eighty odd for three of them!
                [3913] It must have been a right
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3914] [...] of course it was
Annette (PS1CX) [3915] posh
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3916] more expensive [...]
Annette (PS1CX) [3917] Yeah , it must have been.
                [3918] As long as it were worth it! [laugh]
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3919] Never saw, you weren't meant to, and he says, no your
                mum said that we could either have a sweet or a starter, not
                both.
Annette (PS1CX) [3920] Yeah.
                [3921] It sounds awfully mean don't it?
                [3922] I, I said to your dad ... I said it's ... mm mm ... you
                know ... to actually say you can't have
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3923] Well if they were, if they were going home they wouldn't
                be ... having a starter and a steak and a sweet and all that
                lot would they?
Annette (PS1CX) [3924] No, but they are inconvenienced cos they're away from
                home but
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3925] But ... i i it's just
Annette (PS1CX) [3926] Well I don't know, I feel happier now your dad's had
                that bit of a do with that bloke, cos I feel that ... we can go
                to him
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3927] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX) [3928] and, and wi you know, hopefully get paid, there
                shouldn't be any problem.
                [3929] ... Cos that erm ... that Sen, that ... accountant
                obviously isn't up to much.
                [3930] He promised your dad, oh it'll all be sorted within
                twenty four, forty eight hours and that was how many, three
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3931] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX) [3932] four days ago?
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3933] I don't think he knows everything ab about that or what?
Annette (PS1CX) [3934] Erm ... he, he told him this morning on the phone, he's
                looked into it, he's the director ... and he apologizes.
                [3935] He rung to apologize this morning and said that it will
                be sorted ... and you will have your cheque.
                [3936] He said, I am sorry!
                [3937] I didn't realize things were like this.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3938] That's why ... you sent them the conditions!
Annette (PS1CX) [3939] Well, that's what Andrew said.
                [3940] If, if they'd have ... if they'd have talked to Andrew
                first, Andrew would have told him why we'd sent it.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3941] Andrew can't [...] , he's just sort of passed that, that
                on.
                [3942] Why has it gone to somebody who [...] ?
Annette (PS1CX) [3943] Well apparently ... it had gone to Andrew, and, Andrew
                had ... cos Andrew isn't in the office all the time, and he'd
                left it in the office, and ... I think they faxed it ... by th
                Andrew was gonna talk to somebody about it, but of course, by
                the time he'd got there, it'd already been done and this had
                happened so ... I'm gonna ring erm ... Job Centre when I get
                home.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3944] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX) [3945] I, they'll say, I know what they're gonna say.
                [3946] Like, you know ... there's nothing they can do.
                [3947] ... That's why, she'll be better to ... stick it and
                then she was to Aunty Anne's.
                [3948] At least when she finishes at, with Aunty Anne, it was
                seasonal.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3949] [...] she, she ... Anne's gone ... [...] Aunty Anne's,
                she won't have to go to that job [...] .
Annette (PS1CX) [3950] Yeah.

Tracy (PS1D1)   [3953] I'm starting to get a bit like that.
Annette (PS1CX) [3954] Yeah.
                [3955] ... [cough] ... Although I seem, I slept alright last
                night, but I think when you've got things on your mind ... no I
                didn't sleep alright, I was too warm, I tossed and turned most
                of night!
                [3956] I was really warm.
                [3957] ... Did you, you watched the ... programme, the Queen
                did you?

Tracy (PS1D1)   [3962] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX) [3963] get the video.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3964] Just, it's half an hour [...] wanted to watch that on B
                B C two ... half past eight to nine o'clock.
Annette (PS1CX) [3965] Oh I think it'd be nice to have a video, because like,
                when Rebecca gets older ... erm ... cos I personally, my own
                feelings are that ... we might get Charles as King, but after
                Charles there won't be anything cos they'll do away with them.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [3966] D'ya think?
Annette (PS1CX) [3967] Yeah.
                [3968] I think it will get to that.

                morning, let's get a meeting and go but ... I just feel that, I

Annette (PS1CX) [4019] And well, I'm sure David won't anyway.

                what we charged them, we charged them sixteen thousand each.

Annette (PS1CX) [4214] No!
                [4215] It's with ... it's got to go through, we've got to see
                if we can get all the fees paid yet.
                [4216] It's going through that ... system, and once they've
                given us the go ahead then we can go to the solicitor in
                Lancaster.
Donald (PS1D2)  [4217] I see.
                [4218] ... And then, [...] fee ... I can't see how he can,
                well, do you wrong ... when ... er erm fancy, and they're
                trying charge for a ... an hire of a crane?
Annette (PS1CX) [4219] Yeah.
Donald (PS1D2)  [4220] [laughing] Not your fault they had to hire a bloody
                crane [] !
                [4221] ... Pathetic!
Annette (PS1CX) [4222] No it's ... Tracy was telling David, and David said ...
                David was saying same thing, David wants to ... well like was
                saying this morning to Neil, we'll have to get a meeting up a
                go.
                [4223] But, I was saying to Tracy, I can't see the point of
                going just to have a row, because ... that's all it'll end up,
                I don't think they'll get anywhere ... by having a meeting, I
                think they'll just row.
Donald (PS1D2)  [clears throat]
Annette (PS1CX) [4224] Because they, probably they won't budge.
                [4225] You see, Neil's already put his side ... about, we
                worked er ... how can you hold us responsible for them being
                late in when
Donald (PS1D2)  [4226] That's it!
Annette (PS1CX) [4227] for a kick off anyway, you held us up for three, five
                months ... with drawings ... being late!
                [4228] Three months.
Donald (PS1D2)  [4229] Yeah.
                [4230] Yeah.
Annette (PS1CX) [4231] Whatever it was.
Donald (PS1D2)  [4232] They don't really understand that!
Annette (PS1CX) [4233] Before you let us have i the drawings.
                [4234] And there was all that messing about there, and then we
                couldn't foresee the wagon having two punctures, blah, blah,
                blah and the rest of it!
Donald (PS1D2)  [4235] That's right.
                [4236] You didn't
Annette (PS1CX) [4237] But
Donald (PS1D2)  [4238] do them.
Annette (PS1CX) [4239] they've just co totally ignored it you see, and still
                put it down, so they're obviously not prepared to budge.
Donald (PS1D2)  [4240] No.
                [4241] Well
Annette (PS1CX) [4242] So
Donald (PS1D2)  [4243] put it into legal hands then.
                [4244] ... And did you watch video last night?

Tracy (PS1D1)   [5263] And, I've just ... as a basic figure, I mean, they give
                up to a certain figure o before their hours you put a bit of
                tax and after that, but er ... we've allocated him to work, in
                the afternoons when I'm out, they allocate to her, the
                warehouse [...] , because I can't afford any, er, as I say,
                they repairs a machine, it goes out faulty, and the onus is on
                me and the company
Pat (PS1KS)     [5264] Yeah.
Tracy (PS1D1)   [5265] and he ha he hasn't been trained up fully yet so he, you
                know ... but plus, the course he's on at er college isn't doing
                him any good.
Pat (PS1KS)     [5266] That's what happened to our drill you see, you've had
                apprentice on it!

Pat (PS1KS)     [5272] I gi him general things on their own, I mean, it's, it's
                really quiet.
                [5273] I mean I ... as a company Cumbria Power Tools will
                always, you know, it will survive because there's only me and
