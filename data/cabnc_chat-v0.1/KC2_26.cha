*MAR:	That's the trouble. •175433_175490•
*DAV:	all over the country and you can't do it   •175491_175688•
*MAR:	You just can't no. •175689_175752•
        That's what we said to Tim. •175752_175904•
        We, we can't get down there because that's two days  you know? •175904_176129•
        And I have  I have paid for  English lights  just for the sake of a week  •176129_176816•
*DAV:	You can't satisfy all of them. •176874_177182•
*MAR:	No. •177182_177225•
*DAV:	That's the point. •177225_177303•
*MAR:	Yeah well •177304_177334•
*DAV:	It's just a question of you coming and doing your best. •177334_177998•

        See the other  •178015_178064•
*DAV:	You can't do any more. •178064_178165•
*MAR:	the other thing about coming over is it's bloody expensive in England. •178165_178491•
*DAV:	Yeah I know. •178491_178618•
*MAR:	You know? •178697_178722•
        And er  when I came over before and we did Hull  you know Warwickshire and   I did twelve hundred miles  in ten days. •178722_179503•
        Well it's a lot of driving   •179608_179837•
*DAV:	Yeah. •179837_179855•
*MAR:	you know? •179855_179903•
        I needed a rest when I got back. •179908_180099•
*DAV:	And it's a strain   •180099_180218•
*MAR:	It is, you know? •180219_180302•
*DAV:	Especially these days on these roads. •180302_180532•
*MAR:	Yeah. •180532_180572•
*DAV:	Well  •180572_180584•
*MAR:	Yeah. •180584_180606•
*DAV:	And they er adopted a scheme  last year  when they cut off part of the high street from traffic. •180964_182065•
*MAR:	Mm. •182073_182101•
*DAV:	And you went down the high street  and you turned sharp left  and went along Dock Street  and circling  supermarket at the bottom end of town  •182133_183612•
*MAR:	That's right yeah. •183612_183779•
        Yeah. •183780_183781•
*DAV:	They've cut that out now. •183788_183957•
*MAR:	Oh. •183973_183983•
*DAV:	You go straight down again. •183983_184085•
        And consequently the the high street  uncertain now •184085_184450•
*UNK:	Ooh •184450_184468•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Yeah. •184468_184514•
*DAV:	And they're all doing their shopping . •184514_184776•
*MAR:	I'm er I'm a believer in  er pedestrian precincts  you know? •184776_185315•
        Because if you want to do shopping or  just  window shopping, you should park outside of the town  or on the outskirts of the town  and you can walk in or you can get the  the bus service   •185315_186501•
*DAV:	Yeah, yeah, yeah. •186529_186585•
*MAR:	It's just as easy. •186590_186747•
*DAV:	But that's the problem, bus service •186747_186807•
*MAR:	Well yeah •186815_186919•
*DAV:	in this country today the  •186929_187124•
*MAR:	Well  it isn't a bus service is it, you know? •187124_187504•
*DAV:	No. •187504_187511•
*MAR:	Because you  feel obliged to them don't you? •187511_187867•
        Providing a service. •187867_187950•
*DAV:	been destroyed. •187955_188005•
*MAR:	Yeah. •188005_188036•
*DAV:	I think the best move they made in  in, in recent years has been the introduction  of what they call the   and it travels all the way in the town. •188051_189099•
        And forty pence you can get on and go up to your home, they pull up outside our gate. •189099_189642•
*MAR:	Yeah. •189642_189665•
*DAV:	And for forty pence  •189665_189744•
*GEM:	It's been a godsend for us to go down the street shopping, if you've got a load of shopping you just stop  right outside the gate. •189757_190323•
*MAR:	Yeah. •190323_190341•
        They did that, they did that in er  yeah they did that in Levington with er  •190341_190555•
*DAV:	Yeah. •190579_190607•
*MAR:	taxis. •190607_190623•
        You got  and you, you  a taxi came along  and you paid him forty P or fifty P, whatever •190623_191340•
*DAV:	Mm. •191340_191384•
*MAR:	and you went anywhere on that route, yeah? •191384_191657•
        And if you said you wanted to be off the route slightly, no problem he'd go around. •191657_192142•
*DAV:	That's it. •192143_192180•
        Yeah. •192180_192194•
*GEM:	It has it's routes, it goes round and round •192195_192339•
*MAR:	Yeah. •192339_192361•
*GEM:	and you can go on it  anywhere as far as you like for forty pence. •192361_192739•

*GEM:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	It even takes you over the hill into  •192985_193239•
*GEM:	We can get down on the high street any of these times and it drops us back up here. •193239_193656•
*DAV:	Yeah. •193665_193683•
*GEM:	It's a circular route all the time, it keeps going back to  the town centre •193687_194048•
