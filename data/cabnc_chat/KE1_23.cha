*STE:	What you doing man? (.) Tidying the shop, oh look you've put all    (.)  (        ) things up. (.) Wow!
*PAU:	 (        )  (.) So how's you?
*STE:	Ah alright.Off school thank fuck.I'm off for    (        )  (.) cos I have got no work experience cos   (        ) and she couldn't get me   (        ) work experience in June and now everybody else is in work experience I get the week off. (.) So that's pretty hot, (        )  (.) 
*PAU:	So where's Rick got to?
*STE:	Oh he's gone to the library to see    (        )  (.) I'll have to get  (        ) 
*PAU:	Great stuff. (.) So what's the trick to the solo on there?
*STE:	I don't know like, some of it's just real hard, most of it's just easy anyway it goes in the big diddly diddly diddly bit at the end, just      (        )  ((laugh))  (.)  (        )  (.) 
*PAU:	 (        ) stuff's no problem but er once it starts   (.) and get the medium stuff done as well 
*STE:	And there's the bit
*PAU:	so that when he gets up  (        ) 
*STE:	 (        ) three of my frets on the bottom string that you can't bend up, I don't know what's wrong.And you hit it and it bends up and it just dies   (.) and I've been sitting like, I mean I, I definitely don't think that it is anything with the way I hold it in like cos I've been sitting going   ((humming)) and I just, just hit it and it goes ee, it just dies so you can't bend, that's on   (        ) too. (        ) 
*PAU:	Och it might be   (.) I dunno   (.) it might be with you bending it   (.) that there's a bump on that string.
*STE:	Yeah on the, that's a thought,
*PAU:	I think  (        ) 
*STE:	Yeah.
*PAU:	But th it's something wrong with   (        )  (.) 
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*STE:	It looks real good with  (        ) 
*PAU:	That's what I thought, I thought you know fuck   (.) looks like a bloody comic shop for a change.That's why I stuck all the posters here    (        )  (.) think the back issues   (.) loosening up a bit it was getting pretty tight. (.) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Nine hundred series. (.) Well okay    ((laugh))  (.) Anyway I thought they'd ring here but   (.) couple of people, some, two women    (        )  (.) I thought it was Belfast Station   (.)  (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*PAU:	New window display and everything. (        )  (.) The big guns and the big guns   ((laugh)) I found a use for the fucking thing.That looks good actually     (.)  (        )  (.) I thought you'd be practising like mad   (.) on your day off.
*STE:	No.I was playing last night    (        )  (.) Gotta learn this   (        ) album I used to have ages and ages ago    (.)  (        ) fucking  (        ) .I was really annoyed last night, I was getting really      [laughing]  (        )  []  (.)
