*CAR:	And then they're being sponsored for Romanian Orphans
*PAT:	Oh that's
*CAR:	to raise money to take the equipment out there so that 
*PAT:	Oh that's good for Romania to decide oh that's good
*CAR:	So that they can actually get out of their cot and have a move for five minutes but  (.) 
*ADA:	 (        ) just gone to Romania   (.) uhm two weeks ago.She's she's a nurse so she's gone out there to work in an orphanage.overlap 
*CAR:	But it's not easy I mean you know I was reading an article ages ago a few months ago actually and saying you know if you think about it the sort of revolution was over a year ago and still the government hasn't done anything about it and I mean like a lot of provisions that have been brought into Romania sort of go in the front door and out of the back door and you know they sort of sent those of supplies like contraceptions and things like that for the women and   (        ) overlap 
*PAT:	and the doctors was selling them to to to rich Romanians and things like that so there's such a lot of corruption in the country.It's also saying that you know   (.) the family it's only the family unit that helps itself out so if you're an orphan
*CAR:	You haven't got a chance
*PAT:	You haven't got anyone to look after you because they just look after their own really.
