*PS05D:	Alright O K let's say two hundred grand O K It 's still fifty per cent less than one of those properties at Harrow Road right Fifty per cent less on the mortgage means erm about three and a half thousand It 's effectively eighteen thousand per annum saved right The cost of and gain four bedrooms .  171813_221163
