*TER:	You know the steep hill at, at erm   (.) between Martlesham and Woodbridge, you know   (.) as you left Martlesham you went down that steep hill down to the erm   (.) the pub at the bottom of the hill where you came out on the    (        )  (.) looks to me as if the new road misses that altogether
*MAR:	It goes round it.
*TER:	goes round that, goes to the Bealings side of it.Looks to me 
*MAR:	You ought to give John a ring tonight
*TER:	Yeah
*MAR:	you know and sort of erm tell him 
*TER:	yeah 
*MAR:	what   (.) we've done, you know say that you   (.) we only want to see
*TER:	Mm
*MAR:	 (        ) while you're still able sort of comfortably to drive and that sort of thing, I mean if   (.) you put it that way   (.) and you'll be saying anyway she's my er she's my only living
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	real relative.
*TER:	That's right.
*MAR:	I know they are of course 
*TER:	Mm
*MAR:	er because er her children but erm    (.)  (        ) say that we   (.) we didn't want to sort of upset her by erm you know
*TER:	Landing ourselves on them.
*MAR:	landing ourselves 
*TER:	That's right.
*MAR:	on them so 
*TER:	Mm 
*MAR:	we've arranged this   (.) five day break. (.) 
*TER:	But if we have everything ready   (.) to leave as soon as I get back from chess and I'll make sure I leave promptly   (.) if we can come straight away then, with a bit of luck   (.) we'll be on to the M twenty five b by half past four   (.) so we might 
*MAR:	How far round do we have to go on that?
*TER:	Practically the whole wa half way round.
*MAR:	Do we?Yeah  (        ) 
*TER:	About forty miles on it.It's not a lot further than Gatwick but in the other direction.
*MAR:	Yeah. (.) 
*TER:	But it's gonna take us, I mean, what Gatwick took us about three and a half hours didn't it?
*MAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	Well I reckon it's gonna take us three and a half hours to get to the other end, so two and a half hours to it   (.) and an hour on it if it's not too bad and then of course we've got to go up from there to Ipswich, Woodbridge   (.) but it's dual carriageway all the way now you see.
*MAR:	Yeah yeah.
*TER:	So I mean it's seventy miles so it should only take us another hour.
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*TER:	So   (.) perhaps four and a half hours, if we don't get held up on the M twenty five, four and a half hours would do so that, if we leave here at two, we could be there, you know, well by seven. (.) 
*MAR:	So you're going, you   (.) will be at three  (        ) 
*TER:	Quarter past five.
*MAR:	What's the time now?Oh yes erm

*TER:	Yeah.
*MAR:	and erm

*MAR:	cold chicken yes, and you can have the   (.) the other little erm apricot thing and there there is a yoghurt which I'm quite happy enough to have 
*TER:	Yeah.

*TER:	Have you got erm   (.) John  's telephone number in your erm  (.) 
*MAR:	Isn't it in there?
*TER:	It's not in the long book.
*MAR:	Oh.Well it must be in the front   (.) here of my, here   (.) one of those two small  (.)
