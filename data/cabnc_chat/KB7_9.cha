@Comment:	conversation #9 (Tape 018302)
*ANN:	There's not a lot more in here is there?  ((laugh))  (.) There's a bedroom, it's very  (  )  
*JIL:	They don't make them any more do they? 
*ANN:	No. (.)  
*JIL:	They call this the bedroom do they, or  (.) ? 
*STU:	Yeah.  I mean it's quite a good   
*ANN:	 This bedroom's got the  bay window. They've got security locks    (  ) same as ours. 
*STU:	 Security locks like   (.) like we've  like we've got at home. Yes. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	 (  ) can't you? (.)  
*ANN:	Quite nice  (  ) . 
*JIL:	Mm. (  )  
*STU:	Don't think  (  )  
*ANN:	No. 
*JIL:	Quite like the ceilings. They're different aren't they? 
*ANN:	Yeah, mm. 
*JIL:	Quite pretty. You've got erm point behind where you could  (  )  
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JIL:	In burgundy. I don't know what other colours they had  (  ) . But it's   (.) reasonably good quality.  (.) There's an airing cupboard    (  )  (.) Probably got a dead body in there. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*JIL:	I watch too many mysteries don't I? 
*ANN:	 (  )  (.) Cooker goes in there and the washing machine in there. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Nowhere for a fridge. Well you'd have to have it sticking out   (  ) round. 
*STU:	This is a bit silly isn't it? Not having any room for a fridge anywhere. 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	The cooker would have go in there and the washing machine in there. 
*STU:	Washing machine in there. 
*ANN:	No fridge. 
*JIL:	No he hasn't thought about it very well has he? (.)  
*ANN:	I'm afraid it would have to be sticking out. (  )  
*JIL:	Is it, is it a tall fridge? Or is it just an ordinary worktop one? 
*ANN:	No just an ordinary fridge. 
*STU:	There isn't a fridge. ((laugh))   
*ANN:	 Well there will be  . Just an ordinary one. 
*JIL:	 (  ) what the other ones are like. 
*STU:	Unless you, unless you get the fridge in the   (  ) cupboard. 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Oh this is just exactly the same only the other way round. 
*STU:	Same, the same but opposite. 
*ANN:	Yeah.  (  ) in the cupboard  (  )  
*STU:	Oh yeah. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*JIL:	Oh that's    (  )   
*ANN:	  (  )  It hasn't got a sink in this one. 
*STU:	It hasn't got a toilet  either. 
*ANN:	 Or toilet.  It's all been  ((laugh))  
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Er actually   (  ) it has been broken into, this one. 
*JIL:	Oh no. 
*ANN:	We looked at it  outside and and the window   
*STU:	 It looks like it yeah. (  )   
*ANN:	at the back there is broken. 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	 (  ) somebody's been helping themselves. 
*JIL:	 (  ) fire alarms keep   (  ) though don't they? ((laugh))  
*ANN:	Number seven. This is the  (  ) . 
*JIL:	 (  ) ? 
*ANN:	Yeah.  (.) Yeah you see    (.)  (  ) your washing machine. Cooker that 
*STU:	Oh I see. This is different isn't it? 
*JIL:	 Yeah. Got a bit more space. 
*ANN:	 Yeah. See you could have your cooker one  side and your washing machine and fridge, washing machine under there and fridge there. 
*JIL:	So what you've achieved is this piece over the stairs. 
*ANN:	Yeah. Mm.  I said the one upstairs was bigger. 
*STU:	 Yes. You said it was bigger  didn't you? Yeah. 
*ANN:	I was reading the things and I said it was a bigger   (.) upstairs is, are bigger than  the downstairs. 
*JIL:	 It's better cos  the other one's a little bit of an alley isn't it, the kitchen? 
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	It's quite pleasant that is. 
*STU:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Yeah you see  it's bigger cos the bedroom   
*STU:	  (  )  
*ANN:	is a bigger bed  bigger room altogether. 
*JIL:	 Goodness. What a difference. 
*STU:	 Oh there is a difference.  No this is the living room. 
*JIL:	Yeah. 
*STU:	This is the living room here. 
*:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Yeah that's right. This is the bedroom. 
*JIL:	But even so  
*ANN:	 But even  the bedroom's bigger. 
*STU:	Oh crikey that's a big bedroom too isn't it? 
*ANN:	It's bigger.  Most definitely. 
*STU:	 Yeah I said   (  )   
*ANN:	So you'd have    (  )   
*JIL:	 It's a lot better.  Yeah. Yeah. 
*ANN:	I could tell by the   (.)  you know the details   
*STU:	 Financial   (  )   
*ANN:	it just seemed that 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	The way they were reading. 
*ANN:	Yeah the way it was reading. I said to Stuart I'm sure 
*JIL:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	the upstairs is bigger  (  ) . He said that can't be. But you've got the hall and that underneath you see. 
*JIL:	Yeah  it's the landing and everything. 
*STU:	 Underneath us  yeah. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	It would be quite pleasant up here. 
*ANN:	Yeah. I like this one, I don't like the downstairs one so much. 
*STU:	No I like this much more. 
*JIL:	What  colour's the bathroom? 
*STU:	  (  )  the bathroom's even nice. 
*ANN:	It is isn't it? 
*STU:	I don't know why but it just is. 
*JIL:	Yeah. 
*ANN:	Yeah I prefer this one  definitely. 
*STU:	 I do.  Yeah I do. 
*JIL:	What's   (  ) this little cupboard? 
*ANN:	It's quite big as well isn't it? 
*JIL:	Yeah. You could put your hoover and ironing board in that. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	Cos they don't think of those things do they? ((laugh))  
*ANN:	No they never do, do they? 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Yeah I prefer this one  to downstairs. It's much better. 
*STU:	 I do.  (.) I do.  Yeah. 
*ANN:	You've also got   (.) the loft there you can shove 
*JIL:	Oh this one's locked  (  )  
*ANN:	rubbish  ((laugh)) .  (.) Well that one actually's not advertized so it might have gone. 
*JIL:	Oh. ((laugh))  
*ANN:	 (  ) we've only seen   (.) well we've seen advertized   ((laugh)) six  five six and seven   
*STU:	 Numbers five six and seven isn't it? 
*ANN:	but that one wasn't 
*JIL:	Oh right. That wasn't  (.)  
*ANN:	well there's no details in 
*JIL:	That's probably sold then because if I had a choice of four   (.) I would take the upstairs one wouldn't you? (  )   
*ANN:	 Yes.  (  ) said. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	Let's have a little look how it goes again if I may. Cos I haven't seen  (  )  
*STU:	I like the look well I like this one if out out out of all of them 
*ANN:	I do. Yeah I do. 
*STU:	this is much more   (.) much the nicer. 
*ANN:	I like it very much. 
*JIL:	Yeah I like it. 
*STU:	Much the nicer. 
*ANN:	As I say you've got plenty of room to have your 
*STU:	 (  ) there's room  (  )  
*ANN:	You know, you've got your washing machine goes in here   (.) the cooker there your fridge here. 
*STU:	Yeah. Yeah. 
*JIL:	You could get it all in there wouldn't you? 
*ANN:	You'd get everyth  , you'd get your cooker   (.) cooker goes there, fridge here, washing machine under there, you're 
*JIL:	Yeah. You're away. Plus it's a little bit 
*ANN:	Yes it's more 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Yeah  that other one was a bit narrow and   
*JIL:	  (  ) a bit more elbow room. 
*ANN:	Yeah. I like this one. 
*STU:	Yeah I do. 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	I definitely much prefer this one. And I say the rooms are bigger as well. 
*JIL:	Yeah, it's a good size. 
*STU:	Yes they are. Oh yes I definitely like the upstairs to the downstairs. 
*JIL:	And what number's this? 
*STU:	 Seven. 
*ANN:	 Seven.  Mm. 
*JIL:	This is much better you can   (.) almost see your furniture can't you? There's room to put it in. 
*ANN:	Yeah that's it. (.)  
*STU:	 (  )  afford this   
*ANN:	  (  )  
*STU:	Yeah.  Yeah. 
*ANN:	  (  )  
*STU:	 (  ) any of them. 
*ANN:	I like this one. 
*STU:	I like this one better   (.) than  the others. 
*ANN:	 Yeah. I definitely   (  )   
*STU:	That that  (  )  
*ANN:	Yeah that's, when I was reading the thing I said to you somehow the upstairs seemed much better. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	Cos it's quite a big  (  ) . 
*ANN:	It is. It is a nice size bedroom. 
*JIL:	Have you got 
*ANN:	Yes. 
*JIL:	wardrobes and dressing tables? So you'd  (  )  
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JIL:	Quite pleasant view as well. 
*ANN:	It is, that's it. It's not likely to be over   (.) well actually I don't we don't know if they're  gonna be building there. 
*STU:	 Well I think you'll  I think you'll find you'll get buildings 
*ANN:	 Eventually. 
*JIL:	  (  )  
*STU:	eventually round the back. 
*JIL:	It would be a good start wouldn't it? 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	Especially if you can get the right price. 
*ANN:	Well I certainly, yeah, I certainly like this one. (.)  
*JIL:	When you say you've had   (  ) what sort of figures are looking   (.) well, can you achieve? Do you know? 
*STU:	Thirty two thousand. 
*ANN:	Thirty two and a half maximum  wasn't it? 
*STU:	 Mm thirty  two and a half  at a push. 
*JIL:	 So really you  just wanna get something as cheap as possible and 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*STU:	Cheap but nice. 
*ANN:	Yeah. ((laugh))  
*JIL:	Cheap as possible but 
*ANN:	That's it. 
*JIL:	you want a bargain. 
*ANN:	And this one's, as I say it's twenty nine something so I mean it's   (.) it's about right isn't it? ((laugh))   
*JIL:	 Mm  . Yeah and there are all sorts of ways you could  (  ) . You could either go in with   (  ) cash  (  ) . Do you have any deposit at all? 
*STU:	No. 
*JIL:	 (  ) ? 
*STU:	No. I definitely like this one. 
*JIL:	The benefit of this one as well is   (.) if, let's just say we, that you knocked him right down on his money   (  ) force as cheap a buy as possible   (.) then ask if you can do a hundred percent. 
*NON:	Mm. 
*JIL:	Providing   (.) it's   (  ) providing it's   (  ) providing it's not   (  ) damp  (  )  
*STU:	That's right. 
*JIL:	new roofs and everything. I mean you'd have no problem with this. 
*STU:	No. None at all. 
*JIL:	No problem at all, no maintenance at all . Right, looks good. 
*ANN:	It does  yeah. 
*STU:	 Yeah.  Alright. 
*ANN:	I definitely like this one. 
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	So we could work towards   (  ) to knock him right down. Cos then obviously when the market lifts it's then   (.) that's where you're gonna gain. 
*ANN:	Gain. 
*STU:	Mm. (.)  
*ANN:	 Mm I definitely like this one so   
*JIL:	 Well it's a good size isn't it? 
*STU:	It is. Much better. Surprising really.  Only that   
*ANN:	 Yeah. 
*STU:	extra foot  more. 
*ANN:	 That's why I said  to you 
*STU:	Extra foot or extra few inches isn't it? 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*STU:	Just makes  all that difference. 
*JIL:	 Yeah. Just that extra what, eighteen  inches? That's all it is   (.) in the kitchen. And somehow   (  ) the rooms downstairs    (  ) the bay. 
*STU:	 Yes. Yes because of the bay. Yeah it makes   (.) makes that much difference. (  )  
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	I like the colour best up here. 
*ANN:	Yes I like the colour better. 
*JIL:	Another thing   (  ) you've got a window in the bathroom. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*STU:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	Mm. Funny  down here it's a dark hole. 
*STU:	  (  )  
*ANN:	Yeah down here there's no, no. 
*STU:	 (  ) the bathroom's quite nice  (  )  
*JIL:	Right. 
*ANN:	I know but in here there's no window at all it's er   (.) you've got to have the light on all the time.  (.)  Don't you? 
*JIL:	 Yeah.  It's the way the door is as well. The door   (.) in the other flat is here isn't it? 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JIL:	And you've got the bathroom and 
*ANN:	Yeah. (  )   
*STU:	 The bathroom, bathroom   (  )   
*JIL:	are here and th  there you've got the kitchen and the lounge.  It's turned over  (  ) . 
*STU:	 Kitchen to  kitchen to the front.  And the bathroom's   (  )   
*JIL:	 And I mean you don't  really need all that space. It's dark isn't it? 
*ANN:	It is dark. Mm. 
*JIL:	Then you have the noise of the fan where upstairs you've got the window. If you have a shower you can 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	let the condensation out. This kitchen's really quite  tiny  . 
*ANN:	 It's quite  but what I'm   (.) I mean where would you put your fridge? 
*JIL:	You don't do you? 
*ANN:	I mean you've really got to have a fridge in this day and age haven't you? 
*JIL:	Oh   (.) yeah. I mean you can't really afford to take a unit out. 
*ANN:	No. 
*JIL:	I mean 
*ANN:	No cos then you wouldn't have enough space. 
*JIL:	 And you haven't got   (  )   
*ANN:	 You couldn't have your fridge  sticking out here so you could go and   (.) to get  ((laugh))  
*JIL:	No you couldn't do that could you? Somebody hasn't thought, have they? 
*ANN:	No. 
*JIL:	Cos they've put a separate drawer unit in. 
*ANN:	Oh yeah. 
*JIL:	So you can't even lose that cos you lose your drawers. 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*JIL:	Cos this is a double base. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*JIL:	No I think number seven's the one. 
*ANN:	Yes. I do. 
*JIL:	It's better than this one. 
*ANN:	I like that one. (.)  
*JIL:	 (  ) like being upstairs wouldn't you? 
*STU:	 Yes. 
*ANN:	 Yes.  Well w  we said we'd prefer to be  upstairs   
*STU:	 Well we prefer stairs   
*ANN:	rather than have somebody above your head. ((laugh))  
*JIL:	 ((laugh)) And you can make the noise can't you?  (.) Also as well  
*ANN:	We work, we we work shift work so I I mean   (.) you know we get up at half past four in the morning and and if you've got people trundling about above your heads all hours of the night it's er 
*JIL:	Oh god. How are we gonna get out? 
*STU:	Erm   (.) we're not. (.)  
*ANN:	Oh.  ((laugh))  (.)  (  ) Stuart. ((laugh))  
*JIL:	Is it a security lock and I'm not turning the key round enough? 
*STU:	No you're not. Is is there a key in the 
*JIL:	No I've got the keys. (.)  
*STU:	No there's no key  (.)  
*ANN:	 Erm   
*JIL:	  (  )   (.) Can you hold it here so it's   (  ) security keys and I haven't turned it round the other way. 
*STU:	Mm. 
*JIL:	Do you feel like jumping out the window? 
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*STU:	Oh dear what a pity. Never mind we'll just have to stay here the night. 
*JIL:	 Yeah. 
*ANN:	  ((laugh))  
*JIL:	Oh well done. 
*ANN:	Window, oh we've done it. ((laugh))  
*STU:	I think it just needs a bit of  (.)  
*JIL:	Maintenance. 
*STU:	a bit of something on it just to 
*JIL:	Yeah. 
*STU:	 (  ) key. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh))

*STU:	WD forty. 
*JIL:	WD. 
*STU:	Yeah. (  )  (9.0)  
*ANN:	Ah that's it. (.)  
*JIL:	Oh I wonder if it's going to   (.) yeah. It's it's the security thing isn't it  (  )  
*STU:	Mm.  (  ) turn it right round the key   (  ) it should  (.)  
*JIL:	 (  ) 
*STU:	Yeah it's not 
*JIL:	It needs 
*STU:	It needs, just needs a little bit of attention. 
*JIL:	Just, yeah. (  )  
*STU:	That's to open it and that's to lock it.  (.) Take the key out and that should lock it now. (  )  
*JIL:	Yes. 
*STU:	But now it should   (.) yeah it does. 
*JIL:	Yeah. It's been just lying here. 
*STU:	That's now locked. You won't be able to shut it now   (.) because of that  (  ) . 
*JIL:	Oh right. 
*STU:	You could leave it open   (.) that way. If you leave it to there then that will click  then then you'll be alright. 
*JIL:	 That's handy  cos   (  ) to shut yourself out. 
*ANN:	No. 
*STU:	Not if you've turned it that way cos then you won't be able to   (  )  (.)
