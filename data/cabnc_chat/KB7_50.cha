*STU:	My house, my house, my  (        )

*ANN:	No  (.) 
*STU:	No point in buying   (.) fish extra if we know we're gonna be, have to wait or something  (.) 
*ANN:	If we're gonna be late, we'll have to buy the fish, cos we won't have time to cook anything.
*STU:	Oh fish and chips you mean, from the chippie?
*ANN:	Yeah, yes I'll just have a piece of fish and you can have   (.) fish and chips, we won't have time to cook anything will we?
*STU:	That's what I mean
*ANN:	Depending on the time.
*STU:	or I say   (        ) chicken alright? (.) 
*ANN:	Depending on how long we're gonna have to cook it, well I mean, (        ) , oh well   (        ) what I can   (.) still you'll have to   (        ) fish and chips  (.) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	still you perhaps have to buy fish and chips
*STU:	Why?
*ANN:	cos Ann hasn't got a lot of pennies anyway
*STU:	Nor has Stuey.

*ANN:	It can go in microwave.
*STU:	 (        ) or whatever's
*ANN:	Go in the microwave that's all, I ain't got much money at all, I didn't have that much left, I bought mum's cigs and that bit of shopping the other day and that was the end of that     (.)  ((sigh))  (.) we will survive.
*STU:	Pay day late again?
*ANN:	Even if we only have a tin of soup, that will do me.
*STU:	Yeah, I don't mind    (        )  (.) so it's pay day today
*ANN:	Yeah   (.) but you can't get it till tomorrow   (.) there is a little bit in the bank, but not a lot, go   (        ) wait till tomorrow   (.) and we must get to Chester Hill today  (.) .I like that, I don't like Jason Donovan but I quite like that, do you? (.) 
*STU:	Not bad  (.) 
*ANN:	I don't like him, I never have but I, try not, (        ) quite pleasant isn't it?
*STU:	Oh yes pleasant, oh yes pleasant.
*ANN:	I've never liked anything else he's had, (        ) particularly have you?But I just find that   (.) pleasant listening.
*STU:	Oh it's a pleasant sound.
*ANN:	Pleasant and nice songs I suppose I don't know it's just, quite like it, it's now big, it's about the most thing he's ever recorded that I have liked,
*STU:	Mm.
*ANN:	I've absolutely never been a Jason Donovan fan before   (.) Christmas number one's going to be Bohemian Rhapsody which I do like you know  (        ) 
*STU:	I know, will do.
*ANN:	yes, it's already going to the top of the charts   (.) to be number one for Christmas   (.) all the other Christmas songs are  (.) 
*STU:	They're all coming down and that one's er
*ANN:	yep
*STU:	going up  (.) 
*ANN:	that will do.
*STU:	They always   (        ) prices keep falling.
*ANN:	 (        )  (.) Well, I understand its   (.) reasoning  (        ) , but, I think if you've been very hard pushed   (        ) list, with this money, don't you?
*STU:	Mm, mm.
*ANN:	Considering I'm not supposed to have that   (.) cos I had it when Ann and   (        ) bought it   (        ) not sure if it's now   (.) are you?
*STU:	Not really, was, though I thought we were offering a reasonable price taking everything into consideration
*ANN:	 (        ) upstairs and
*STU:	 (        ) price market 
*ANN:	market 
*STU:	erm, how long we've been here sitting tenants er
*ANN:	I'm not thinking it object the sitting tenants 
*STU:	the   (        ) , I thought that was fair 
*ANN:	as it stands at the moment.
*STU:	fairly good deal.
*ANN:	Mm.See here, they're gonna get thirty six for it as it stands   (.) put it on the market as   (        )  (.) 
*STU:	Might do, yeah.
*ANN:	Might even   (        ) two years  (        ) .
*STU:	When you look at, look at the old houses on the market, erm, yeah, I think he might just, he might wait a while, there aren't that many buyers,
*ANN:	Oh that's it, that's why they're coming down, that's why   (        ) are quite pleased to see us dear, especially at this time of the year, not many people will buy Christmas time, think oh we'll wait and go and get Christmas over and the spring and  (.) 
*STU:	I think looking at the market you can, you can get a, erm detached, semi-detached sort of one you know one bedroom I suppose,
*ANN:	You can get two bedroom
*STU:	two bedroom at a push for about thirty four, thirty five, thirty six, thirty seven,
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	oh I don't know, I don't know, I think it will be a while getting rid of it yes, but I think he might get his price eventually, but it will take a long while to get it  (        ) , it's up to him if he wants a quick sale, (        )  (.) you know, thirty five yeah I, thirty five thousand I think  (        ) , as I say taking everything into consideration, I mean, failing three okay I know I did the   (        ) thirty three   (.) so take thirty five, thirty three and a half, oh   (        ) he ain't got much to worry about  (.) 
*ANN:	Well
*STU:	 (        )  (.) 
*ANN:	I'd better get some clothies on   (.) cause a bit of a stir round the estate agents  (        ) , naked from the waist down, (        ) darling
*STU:	 (        )  (.) 
*ANN:	What   (        ) that's ten minutes slow    (        )  (.) Just a-f-bout done all your paper work on them teams
*STU:	I know.
*ANN:	got a   (        ) he's coming tomorrow   (.) you know, got the bird   (        ) as well ain't we, that's why I got up early to I, go through   (.) deeply objective.
*STU:	Why, what's been  (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) it's completely anonymous number you know it's only   (        ) to be on that, said I'll wipe it off then, you bloody well won't, I think he wants to tell people before he can say   (        ) very wrong, could say something personal, (        ) if it was personal, no longer it, no you weren't   (        ) personal to you, but I'm quite happy to arrange it if you wish, no, no, no, no, no, (        ) , I shouldn't have to tell you not to take my points in full, there we go    ((laugh))  (.) it's driving me doing that in the factory having without people's permission, I want to know, I   (        ) ask permission if I'd er   (.) wanted to as a   (        ) without being asked to do it, I would of gone and seen personnel and asked, I would not of dreamed of doing it in a work's situation unless I was asked, say anything personal I'd turned it off   (.) not that it, apart from me and Stuart
*STU:	Go on.
*ANN:	apart from me and Stuart there's nothing personal on it really, we went me and er telling me about her problems I only put that on a tape do you?
*STU:	 ((laugh)) , its not er
*ANN:	you know, anything personal like that you turn it off don't you? (.) not that they know or care whi anyone's personal problems anyway, they don't know who we are  (.) 
*STU:	Cos a conversation like that very well be   (.) a private person will not be a 
*ANN:	 (        ) 
*STU:	but then again you, you might, you might come up and say, say something that   (.) that they wanna hear, you wanna hear?
*ANN:	Yeah, but
