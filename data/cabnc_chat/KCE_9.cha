*HEL:	Mm.He shouldn't have done that really, he was a bit naughty.
*JOA:	He,sh she ought to learn to sh she's, they was all on about how Shrimpy can't stick up for himself, and then flaming   (.) Emma does exactly the same but worse cos she gets Scott to do it for her. (.) She's gonna have to one of these, I'm not being funny but she can't stick up for herself, that girl can't.It's about time she had the courage to do it, herself if she's in a strop.There's no point getting Scott, cos what's gonna happen when she finishes with Scott?
