*NOE:	Nursery nurse, looking after young children in nurseries and stuff like that. •27345_31955•
        Mhm. •32775_32925•
*ENI:	I can imagine you doing that. •32925_33895•
*NOE:	Can you? •34645_34825•
*ENI:	Aha. •35285_35375•
*NOE:	Mhm. •35425_35645•
*ENI:	I can. •36665_36895•
*NOE:	Yes. •36975_37105•
        I'm going, for work experience I'm going to Saxted Ministry up there hopefully  to see what it's like looking after children  you know, like a nursery and everything. •37485_44025•
        So hopefully I can get the job there  from that two weeks, and then   •44095_49535•
*ENI:	That would be wonderful! •49715_51195•
*NOE:	what it's like. •51425_52665•
        Yeah. •53145_53205•
*ENI:	I didn't  •53205_53415•

        Yeah. •58995_59085•
*UNK:	Oh that's right, yes. •59085_59555•
*ENI:	And is that for children who are  living there or just go in for the day? •60115_64175•

*UNK:	Mhm, •66515_66665•
*ENI:	Oh Good! •67195_67965•

*ENI:	And what qualifications must you have for that? •71765_73915•

*NOE:	Right. •90775_90865•
        Mhm. •91445_91605•
        It's all to do with GCSE coursework and  see how we're getting on  during the two weeks and  we get experience for us when we leave school and go to work. •91675_101095•
*ENI:	That's a good idea! •102015_102655•

*ENI:	You get a feeling for it then. •103705_104745•

*ENI:	I think it's one of the best jobs for a girl that there are don't you? •105295_108545•
*UNK:	Well I think so, I think  erm  as long as they can go and work with children  and then  they've got the time when they can leave off and come, but it's having the whole time, well then they've children all their life haven't they? •108945_121135•
*ENI:	Yes. •121375_121785•
*UNK:	This is the only thing if  you go sort of privately  you know? •121785_126035•
