*DON:	Oh yes
*ANN:	from Himalayan anyway that er
*DON:	Oh it's, it's, it's an amazing isn't it when you think of all these languages, if erm, if they all come from Adam and Eve
*ANN:	Mm
*DON:	then you'd think they would be just one language wouldn't you?
*ANN:	Mm, when we have it this morning er talk, er in Watch Tower but he you know about
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	when, when er Jehovah confuse them because they want to what's the word, they'd er, they'd what's erm
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	mm just have a look er Genesis
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	is it?
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	Just have a look
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*MAR:	Genesis now then
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	Genesis where the one says, now all you continue to be of one language and of one set of words 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	so where did all of the other languages come from?It goes on to say   [reading] and it came about that in thy journeying eastward they eventually discovered a valid plain and a land of Shinar and they took up growing there and they began to say each one to the other come on let us make bricks and bake   (.) and bake with a burning process, so bricks served as stone for them and
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	served as malter for them.Now   ((cough)) they now said come on let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	in the heavens and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves for fear we may be scattered all over the earth  [] , well that was God's command wasn't it there they said be scattered all over the earth 
*MAR:	Mm, yeah 
*DON:	and they didn't want to be scattered all over the earth so they built this er, he wanted to make, to make a name for themselves didn't they?
*MAR:	Mm 
*DON:	 [reading] Come on might as well er sell the city or sell the town
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	in the heavens to make, and let us make it celebrated name for ourselves   [] it's, people today have just got the same attitude haven't they?They have to make names for themselves, so it mentions about, it says Jehovah verses
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	 [reading] and Jehovah proceeded to go down to see what they see, to see the city and they tell that the sons of man have gods, after that Jehovah said look there are one people and there is one language for the north and this is they start to do, why now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unobtainable for them, come now let us go down and their confuse their language  [] , he'd be speaking to angels now wouldn't he 
*MAR:	Mm 
*DON:	or to Jesus   [reading] and to confuse their language that they may not listen to one another 's language and accordingly Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth   [] so, and that was God's purpose for them to be er spread out all over the earth cos God knew that city life would only break down and all these centuries have passed since then and there's urgent proof throughout the year, the cities, the cities don't work so God had his own way, give it, the one, his way is the only one that works and thus when we pray for this king of
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	Columbia that only face over and our kingdoms that we have today, so   (.) one thing about language.
*MAR:	Yeah
*DON:	Now that, you speak the Russian language don't you er, I'm saying this now for the benefit of the tape
*ANN:	Yeah
*DON:	explain, speak their Russian language and
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	when he came like, he said, he was saying it's not, so he promised again he was saying
*ANN:	Well   (.) he, he telephoned me week after didn't he?He said he's at the home and everything's going alright and he's saying he's already sent us the, the, the invitation, but I have no invitation 
*MAR:	Haven't arrived yet 
*ANN:	I have nothing here, but I mean you said Ukraine already to buy it, they're not allowed calls, telephone calls, not out, not in, closed postage as well so it must be something stuck in there
*DON:	Oh yes
*ANN:	for I don't think advice er, what time you said will be in use?It's not very good even now they ought 
*MAR:	Mm, turn back 
*ANN:	the Ukrainian talk now, and they tried to get rid of Yeltsin
*DON:	Oh yes
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	is it, is it on the telly now?Or what times does it come on?
*MAR:	Well until, er quarter to ten will be one and then ten ten past 
*ANN:	No, be nine nine forty five I think
*DON:	Oh yes I want
*ANN:	so it's not very good, I'm not surprised so you'd better be er   ((laugh)) 
*DON:	I, I wouldn't go
*ANN:	No no it's too dangerous 
*DON:	no I wouldn't go 
*ANN:	we going revolution in there and if
*MAR:	We're going to Australia instead  ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	we're going to Australia or Jamaica somewhere
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DON:	Well you know really   (.) I can't, I can't see any point in staying around here myself, yeah, it's just my mum really, if anything happened to her then I'll move you know   (.) I'd move from Newcastle, Stoke On Trent area
*ANN:	How old is your mum?
*DON:	Eighty six
*ANN:	Oh that is big age, is she still with you or in a home?
*DON:	She's in a home  (.) 
*ANN:	This one, no, oh no this is
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	is she in a
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	no, she, no, nobody never so  (.) 
*MAR:	Mm
*ANN:	Very, very confusing this is, the world is going upside down and he don't know what's going to happen next you see, for instance looking a year ago, two years ago the wall, the Berlin Wall was standing and the Russian empire was feared, all over the world, and now this day, it just fell on its face
*DON:	That's just two years ago
*ANN:	Yeah 
*MAR:	Yeah 
*ANN:	it just fell on its face and it's such a shame that the land like that er, er rich in everything, neglected themselves to that state that they're begging for food
*DON:	Yes
*ANN:	it's, it's unbelievable, unbelievable 
*DON:	Yes 
*ANN:	but yet when you look in Book of Daniel which, where tau he talks about er the north king and the south king
*DON:	Yes it does
*ANN:	there, there, there be fighting and shoving and pushing for the power and then it says there that it will look as though the, the north king will take all over, all over the what, what spread all over the earth and then it says gradually he will go right back to his ho go home, gradually will be stepping back, right back to his home and there's going to be no helper for him
*DON:	Yes 
*ANN:	look what happened the communist just fell, fell on his face without a one shot
*DON:	It's amazing that is Anna isn't it?It really is amazing, that was, what you said, how long ago was it those?
*ANN:	Two years and
*DON:	No 
*MAR:	No 
*DON:	with
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	the, the, Daniel was living, you know, you know better than I do how many years, how many centuries Daniel was living before Jesus' birth then?
*DON:	He were, it was way before Jesus wasn't he?
*ANN:	Mm 
*MAR:	That's it 
*DON:	Way before Jesus then 
*MAR:	So it was , the prophecy was written then by Daniel for our, for our time and it just happened in our, because you know er, when he was er, when he finished the book write written and he said I have seen the, the, the erm visions and I've heard the voice, but I, and I've written down what I was told to do, but I do not understand and then the voice said to him well close that down, that book is not for you to understand, the generations that it's written for, it's written for the end of the times, they will come to understand it, and you see we actually witnessing what's happening
*ANN:	Yeah
*MAR:	the, what Daniel wrote there it's happening in our time
*DON:	 ((cough)) Yes, but when you, when you say it's the end of time it's, you get some people saying yes it's always the end, for some country it's always er collapses or what me have you, it's always then for some government or country
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	but now this is the end for worldwide isn't it?
*MAR:	Yeah
*DON:	Like, the old 
*MAR:	listen this is the end for the er political system, you see the half of it is collapsed already the, the north king so you see what's happening in the, in the, er   (.) south king  ((laugh)) 
*DON:	Oh yes
*MAR:	hmm
*DON:	I mean erm, was it nineteen eighty seven?When the stockmarket flopped
*MAR:	Yeah
*ANN:	Yeah
*DON:	and I did hear, somebody told me like that the reason erm house prices shot up, you went three times as a a as high in value in what a matter of moments
*MAR:	Yes
*DON:	and somebody said it was because since the stockmarket flopped people drew out and put the money in building societies, building societies were bursting at the seams, didn't want to, and banks as well, didn't know what to do with all this money, so, somebody went in for a loan and asked for fifty thousand and come out with a hundred thousand, they couldn't get it out, give it to people, a lot, a lot of people that really er   (.) weren't safe gambles
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	and now the er, they're not paying back, and the houses have come down and so what people are doing, or some people that have bought these houses, they're just giving the keys back and repossessing the house
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	cos if they decide to sell it now they couldn't
*MAR:	No
*DON:	and that was that the, it's probably thirty thousand less in price
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	and he probably hadn't paid that much anyway so he has to go out the house
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	probably hadn't paid that much, so these peo the ones that lent the money out, in really they er, and they really have suffered just, they probably thought that if we don't lend them the money somebody else will and get the interest and they'll grow bigger and much overtake us, you know, to, to take over our business, so er, so the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	agreed that they've lent this money out, but it's bounced back you see, it's bouncing back on them, and this, everything's bouncing back on everybody now, but it seems 
*MAR:	Mm 
*DON:	to be that way doesn't it?Everything seems to be failing.Erm, I remember years ago, well, well, say months ago, erm, one of the local estate agents were writing in one of the property news I think it was or the Advertiser, saying now is the time to buy, erm, whereas twelve months ago, now's the time to buy because they
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	gonna start going up again, well since they've had that, that wrote in the paper, they've come down even more
*MAR:	Oh
*DON:	so these local experts, you can't believe what they say   (.) the only way really is to, the scriptures don't they say give us an accurate er description of what's
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	happening in our time   (.) but, but and you think of what it says in Two Timothy with the 
*MAR:	Mm, mm  (.) 
*DON:	that's typical of our days isn't it?
*MAR:	Mm
*DON:	Too typical, typical of us now.
*MAR:	Love is of money, love is of pleasure and love is of everything about God   [laughing] in command, yeah   [] 
*ANN:	Uses it 
*MAR:	yeah  (.) 
*ANN:	chained up, such a beautiful, beautiful countries and just go to, to any, to any length to be destroyed.
*DON:	Yes.
*ANN:	And you know this time when I went on a plane and I looked down, I wasn't saying it to Ben
*MAR:	No
*ANN:	and I said to my husband why people want to go paradise of heaven, I says look down, how beautiful, it is really beautiful all green is 
*DON:	Yes it is isn't it?
*MAR:	Yeah
*ANN:	then going over this sea blue and I was, so beautiful, (        ) you know Catholic used to say, when you di died in paradise, always want to go up the somewhere else paradise and it's in here and look what happened they ruin and ruin and ruin and so be
*DON:	Well it's against the bible's prophecy isn't it?
*ANN:	Yeah, yeah 
*DON:	You know the way said have an
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DON:	I think that'll be to  (        ) .
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	yeah  (.) 
*MAR:	Shame
*DON:	When, when were you thinking if you went to going to Canaries, any time? (.) 
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DON:	There's plenty, a lot of money in
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DON:	hundred dollar notes
*ANN:	Oh we were going 
*DON:	You, you, you 
*ANN:	we were going to go Canaries but then we, just now we were looking at what, what did we, what was it
*MAR:	Jamaica
*ANN:	Jamaica 
*DON:	Oh yes 
*ANN:	or erm, anyway I've got a friend help me to 
*MAR:	Barbados Barbados 
*ANN:	oh Barbados, but we have to seen if their teletext if they let us do, but I've just talked to Jamaican people and they said their, their friend he got some contact wanting some order, then later on this lady says no it's best thing to do go to
*MAR:	Air Tours
*ANN:	Air Tours, they said me it's no use going somebody you don't know, you maybe seen them through they might take your money and that's it.
*DON:	Oh Jamaica you know   ((cough)) it'll be cost dearer to get there won't it?But er I think erm the pound goes a lot further there, you'll probably fe but I'd probably feel like a millionaire in Jamaica
*ANN:	Mm
*DON:	cos, it was like in the, the same with Poland wasn't it?
*MAR:	Mm
*ANN:	Yeah but I got by these people who've been to Jamaica, says that he gi if you give five pound tip for there, there what's erm they don't like it, it's not enough, they won't speak to you no more.
*MAR:	Five pound tip is not enough
*ANN:	I'm not going there
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DON:	I won't, I won't give them a tip if that's the attitude
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	They said the best way to give them
*DON:	Yeah  (.) 
*ANN:	No it's too cold in England, might go somewhere
*DON:	Mind you, you say it's too cold, this last few years, you know we're not being, oh we had some snow last year didn't we?
*MAR:	Mm

*DON:	Yes
*MAR:	but now this last few years we, it's a lot warmer winter than we, than we remember at the beginning

*DON:	Yes
*MAR:	unless somebody comes and gets you out and there's, there's nothing like it now 
*ANN:	They have insist operation now
*DON:	It's exciting though when you get deep snow   [laughing] isn't it for a little while, yes  [] ?
*MAR:	Yeah

*MAR:	Yeah, but it freezes that quick that when it falls overnight and then by the morning it frozen so hard that you can walk on top of it
*DON:	Yes
*MAR:	and not go through you know in a while you'll go through and not stay there
*DON:	You'd freeze to death wouldn't you?
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) Oh no you don't freeze when you're in the snow, you don't freeze because it's colder in the snow than it is, er it's, warmer in inside the
