*TER:	Do you know the pots there, the two that I bought were forty seven out at Havercom, they were seventeen out at Traygo
*MAR:	Oh
*TER:	so I got four more, had a look round thought I saw it, but Traygo was heaving   (.) I tried to park by the erm garden centre, but to not only were there people all parked there, there was a great articulated lorry delivering stuff, so you went in and you couldn't even then get out, go and park further up
*MAR:	Still you
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	going and pick up your own 
*TER:	well I parked 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	I parked sort of out in the car park and then got a tr a trolley and wheeled it rather than have to try and get back into that lot.
*MAR:	What else did you get?
*TER:	Flower pots and compost that's all   (.) oh let's have a drink of water  (.) 
*MAR:	Phone call from somebody who wanted to book the hall, erm children's party, and erm this person kept on saying are you the man that does the, that sort of lets out the hall
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	I am Mrs  who's sort of the secretary and books, does the booking for the hall, he couldn't get that, anyway it occurred to me afterwards it must of been the grandmother of that girl that bought the erm, cos he kept on talking a Michelle and   ((laugh)) that's the girl that bought our suite and I reckon it's her child's birthday party, she said erm   (.) you know my, you know my son-in-law, I said do I?Yeah, Frank, Frank    (.) and of course and then afterwards I realized that that was Michelle
*TER:	That's right, yeah  (.) 
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	oh did she?I always times, the thing I forgotten to think about was that lock, I really ought to do that
*MAR:	Anyway, erm   (.) she said will you tell
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	I said you know, will you bring your own things?Meaning you know paper plates and what not and she said oh last time sister Joyce would even let me use the kitchen, I said you can use the kitchen, I just wondered erm, you know, so anyway
