*CHR:	Where's Snoopy getting the money from to go to the Tiger's Head tonight? •171232_175322•
*NOR:	credit cards in use. •179692_180852•
        She can go where she likes. •180852_184892•
        I only gave her fifteen. •185042_187242•
        So I said I was tired of waiting for the money for my things and she can collect it from the students and have it when it came. •187262_200462•
*CHR:	Well done. •200702_201052•
        That was a fiver was it? •201522_202622•

*CHR:	Yes. •204912_205182•
        Presumably they've all got their films. •208292_209902•
        So they should jolly well be stumping up. •209902_212912•
