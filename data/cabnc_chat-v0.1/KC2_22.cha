*FLO:	Ah, my stomach's getting so hot  •552622_554122•
*FRE:	I'm only gonna get it four foot deep with it anyway  it wouldn't be four foot deep all over, it'll start off at two foot and then slightly slope down to the deep part •554122_571972•
*FLO:	Yeah •573082_573192•

*FRE:	Yeah, you definitely want a slope one better  •662042_671802•

*FRE:	Mm  the water in my other pond is crystal clear, see straight down to the bottom, and another thing I want this hedge quite high cos keep the sun off my pond, if you let the sun on the pond it'll just go green •689382_702462•
*FLO:	Yeah, if you shade it •703442_704742•

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	see when the water comes back out the filter it goes through this pipe right, a big unit type of thing •720012_733412•
*FLO:	Yeah •733492_733702•
*FRE:	the water flows by, it's got an ultra violet light in it and the ultra violet light rays kill off the er  •733702_743912•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*DAV:	can have enough of these you know. •743912_755482•
*FLO:	Enough of what? •757072_757552•
*DAV:	These insulator bits •757782_759292•
*FRE:	Ah? •760922_760952•
*UNK:	 (        )

*FRE:	Probably be at Ruth's by about eight I suppose  •795912_807362•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FLO:	If Brenda wanna go over here, or what, I'll go over anyway  •812732_826852•
*DAV:	I can never •827182_827732•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	Wrong L E D •829852_830462•
*DAV:	No, that, that L E D has been •830782_832922•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	all the way round •833202_833642•
*FLO:	Well change it then, ain't you change that yet, you found that this morning early •834252_839482•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FLO:	all you have to do is pull it off, they do come off you know? •839482_857262•
*DAV:	Yeah but I can't be doing with it  •857672_861362•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	I'm only going by what this •861362_863512•
*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FRE:	They ain't very far apart  they do grow big you know •863642_876862•
*FLO:	Yeah I know •877462_877872•
*FRE:	There's this old girl at er the top of the road you know, got them, she planted them half way down her garden, right, when they'd grown to about six foot high she said we could have the rest of their garden, so we did, that's how come our garden's so big cos people give our, give us the garden •878102_895612•
*FLO:	Mm  •897832_897922•
*FRE:	Council come round our house they'll say yeah your garden looks big  •900012_903122•
*FLO:	If you can't plant them closer together, instead of their roots going outwards they'll probably go downwards  •907082_915542•
*FRE:	Oh er •916292_916412•
*FLO:	Yeah, might do, there must be a reason why they say plant nineteen inches apart •917352_923692•
*FRE:	Of all the hedges I've seen they've been about eighteen two foot, about that far apart •923692_931842•
*FLO:	I'll have a look see how far ours are apart in the garden •934292_938562•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	yes and they've put in there and they're about two foot apart  •939482_946702•
*FLO:	Could be ages to grow like that, now it's grown a real good hedge, in fact no it ain't a good real hedge it's got massive great gaping holes in it •948012_958332•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	Who's that •958852_959882•
*UNK:	 (        )

*FRE:	Yeah, that's, once the conifers are all growing up, we're going to have a garden shed a greenhouse and I'm gonna build a summer house up the garden, that's by, by round where the pond is •976992_989142•

*FRE:	Yeah, but we want a proper greenhouse  don't have one in the stock room do you? •991782_998962•
*FLO:	No •100069_100079•
*FRE:	One of those aluminium greenhouses •100079_100221•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	they cost a lot of money they do •100645_100811•
*FRE:	Mm, I know, that's why I was •100827_100926•
*FLO:	cos it's made out of aluminium and you've got to put the glass in, it's really expensive I tell you •100944_101339•
*FRE:	Mm  •101610_101616•
*FLO:	No, sheds are pretty expensive as well they're a couple of hundred quid aren't they? •101616_102425•
*DAV:	My mate used to fix sheds, the garden sheds, had this little card with Chad on it said what no shed   •102444_103093•

*UNK:	 (        )  (.) 
*FLO:	No I want the green, I want the garden chair, I was thinking of getting a big garden chair and stick it in one of those lean-to •104829_108680•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FLO:	and lean it up against the garden shed, you know what I mean? •108680_109371•
*FRE:	Yeah  •109371_109374•
*FLO:	If a, bloody greenhouse on it's own, when they •109380_109643•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*FLO:	seriously •109643_109659•
*FRE:	When we had the gales a couple of years ago, I was in the kitchen making a cup of tea and I could hear all this glass smashing, and I went ooh what's going on, and the wind whistled across the field, it's all open field •109676_110929•
*FLO:	Yeah  •110929_110959•
*DAV:	Yeah  •110959_110990•
*FRE:	it flies down their garden and in between the two houses it acts like a wind •111006_111362•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	and you get gale force winds blowing down there and of course I opened the back door and there were panes of glass flying past •111369_112064•
*DAV:	No •112064_112101•
*FRE:	Yeah, swinging around us, literally big panes of glass and they were flying down and as soon as they got away from the houses, it opened up again, they were crashing down all over my drive and all over the road out there •112101_113316•
*DAV:	 ((laugh)) 
*FLO:	What were they from? •113316_113405•
*FRE:	From the greenhouse •113481_113712•
*FLO:	Oh •113712_113723•
*FRE:	Something fell in greenhouse and broke the pane to allow the wind to get into the greenhouse, which is oh dear me, as soon as the wind got into the greenhouse as I say blowing the other panes out •113723_114841•
*DAV:	Yeah •114841_114856•
*FRE:	and as soon as the panes been blown out, it was such a force, it was blowing them between two houses, smashing on the road, and in the end, once a few more panes had gone that was it the whole greenhouse, I sat there watching this greenhouse, it just suddenly launched itself off the bit on it, over our fence, it went, there was glass everywhere for weeks afterwards, when I was cutting the lawn, oh dear the •114856_117349•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	glass shattered  •117349_117416•
