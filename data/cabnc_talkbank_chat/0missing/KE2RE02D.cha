*PS0W4:	Doris you 're quite elderly are n't you I 'm very elderly my husband 's very elderly we manage very well . 
*PS0W6:	Well yes but you tell them that will you .

*PS0W6:	who er yeah and .

*PS0W2:	Yeah . 
*PS0W6:	hall it is a very cold . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah . 
*PS0W4:	Well when we have our meeting . 
*PS0W2:	Well it 's just a question of really of of some if someone can you know I mean . 
*PS0W4:	Are you going to put a new fire in or something . 
*PS0W6:	No no we 've we we were talking about it actually what we 've done and erm of course it 's the school children we 've got ta think about . 
*PS0W4:	Cos we have our meetings . 
*PS0W6:	There 's nowhere to put it away is there It 'll slide on th on castors . 
*PS0W2:	It 'll slide on ca I mean I moved it into the corner so that erm . 
*PS0W6:	Yeah is there anywhere that it can be put away when the children are not there Or when the children are there . 
*PS0W2:	Well I mean the children I mean if I go into the school and I and say to them look there is a fire there but you know please will you not use it but it 's just a question of whether the children fiddle with it really that 's . 
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W6:	We 'll have to think about it this week while they 're away they 're on holiday this week . 
*PS0W2:	Yes they are that 's true But it 's also a question of you know erm when it 's exhausted . 
*PS0W6:	Yeah well we can always arrange that . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah But I 'll talk to you some time about the heating because I mean the trouble is that no . 
*PS0W6:	Well er er the whole thing the the hall is is is a big worry because they wo n't insure us because it 's dangerous There 's no insurance on that hall to my knowledge there 's no insurance . 
*PS0W2:	I did n't know that . 
*PS0W6:	Michael said to me the first thing he said to me when I came here that 's the first I 'd do knock it down he said it 's it 's dangerous it 's not That 's what he said the first thing he said to me when I came here That 's that 's the first job you 've got ta do get that rid of that . 
*PS0W2:	So there 's no point in spending a lot of money on it . 
*PS0W6:	No that 's what I say and and I 've written to the insurer to the insurer to tell ask them what is the situation and we 're still waiting an answer . 
*PS0W2:	I see . 
*PS0W4:	But we did n't we . 
*PS0W2:	I thought I mean I the fire people gave it the all clear . 
*PS0W4:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	Erm and with and with the erm with those fan heaters in there there is as it were no fire risk from it . 
*PS0W6:	No Well fan heaters can be on you know but you ca n't hear feel them unless you 're next to them I think . 
*PS0W2:	Mm mm And the overhead heaters were no use either I mean that 's why we put the fan heaters in cos they were better than the . 
*PS0W6:	Well let me wait I 'll tell I 'll sh I 'll tell you what the insurers say when they come back when it comes I 'm waiting for them to answer . 
*PS0W2:	Right . 
*PS0W6:	But it 's not insured I can tell you that I have no erm er policy for it And I 've I was I do n't know if it was Michael or somebody else told me that they would n't insure it . 
*PS0W4:	Oh well we 've never known that have we . 
*PS0W2:	No we 've never known that have n't heard that . 
*PS0W6:	Well that 's well there 's no . 
*PS0W4:	Cos it was sort of insured when we first took it over . 
*PS0W6:	Yeah there 's no record of an insurance in the the file . 
*PS0W4:	Oh I see . 
*PS0W6:	And so I we have written to them and waiting for an answer . 
*PS0W2:	Right . 
*PS0W6:	So when we you see there 's no good putting anything in there erm or doing anything with it if we 're not going to use it or if it 's got ta come down in another year or two . 
*PS0W2:	No . 
*PS0W6:	Mind you when I said it 's got ta come down it might be five years before it comes down but you 've got ta think of your outlay first . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah I mean there 's no point in re-roofing it for instance . 
*PS0W6:	Oh no Not as as far as I know But we 'll see what they say . 
*PS0W4:	Is the insurance through the diocese Father . 
*PS0W6:	Well it 's it 's done it 's a di er no . 
*PS0W4:	No . 
*PS0W6:	it 's done privately but it 's the diocese have appointed the insurers . 
*PS0W4:	I see . 
*PS0W6:	We 're done through Peter . 
*PS0W4:	Mhm . 
*PS0W6:	he 's the insurance broker and it all works through Norwich Union . 
*PS0W4:	Mhm . 
*PS0W6:	Erm and he 's got some very good quotes for us . 
*PS0W4:	Yes . 
*PS0W6:	you do n't er insure a building according to its size now but according to the number of people who use it It 's far er fairer . 
*PS0W2:	Mm . 
*PS0W6:	I mean you might have a massive building . 
*PS0W2:	And hardly anybody using it . 
*PS0W6:	you 've got ta pay for it . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah . 
*PS0W6:	So it 's according to the number of people that use it go to mass how much you pay . 
*PS0W2:	Mm . 
*PS0W6:	erm on the insurance And it covers everything but as far as I know and I 'm willing to be corrected . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah I do n't know . 
*PS0W6:	that that is not insured . 
*PS0W4:	No well we do n't know we had thought that it was Especially after . 
*PS0W6:	No as far as . 
*PS0W4:	it was all done up . 
*PS0W2:	Mm . 
*PS0W4:	Yes after it was sort of . 
*PS0W6:	Well as far as well I know that Michael . 
*PS0W4:	renovated . 
*PS0W6:	Michael said to me the first thing he said to me that has to come down . 
*PS0W4:	How funny he never ever said anything like that to us You 've not heard that either . 
*PS0W4:	told me . 
*PS0W6:	That 's the first thing I know nothing about no well I know nothing about structure or anything else you know I mean . 
*PS0W4:	But they had I do n't know if you know it had been absolutely dilapidated the hall I mean it was absolutely run down and it was n't used But then there was this erm er er what was it called The scheme er er to help . 
*PS0W4:	The scheme the youth scheme and er . 
*PS0W2:	The . 
*PS0W4:	youngsters . 
*PS0W2:	Oh . 
*PS0W4:	so that if . 
*PS0W2:	The work work something something scheme and and they they 'd refurbish it all th th that we had to do was to pay for the materials they provided the labour And in fact you know I mean they er they made it . 
*PS0W6:	Well it looks alright to me . 
*PS0W2:	they made it useful again . 
*PS0W6:	But if I if I . 
*PS0W2:	Usable . 
*PS0W4:	if I had anything to do with it I would like those those gas fires that we 've got in the room at the back of the church there they 're ideal . 
*PS0W2:	The trouble is there . 
*PS0W4:	The trouble is there 's . 
*PS0W2:	no mains gas . 
*PS0W4:	there 's no gas . 
*PS0W2:	into the hall . 
*PS0W6:	No well . 
*PS0W2:	That is why we did n't we would of liked to have had it but the cost to put the mains gas in was going to be so enormous . 
*PS0W6:	Oh well . 
*PS0W2:	and the electric supply is limited to the heating that we 've got we ca n't put any more in because the mains supply again is not sufficient . 
*PS0W4:	0 . 
*PS0W6:	This is amazing because in Cornwall they would put in the gas for nothing . 
*PS0W2:	Well I mean you know I mean . 
*PS0W6:	Cos we had it done in our hall . 
*PS0W4:	they are now perhaps if you had a word with them . 
*PS0W6:	We we we had it in our hall we they put it into the building for nothing . 
*PS0W4:	Yeah . 
*PS0W6:	and then you have to wire erm plumb it in or whatever they call it . 
*PS0W4:	Yes . 
*PS0W2:	Yes that 's fair enough . 
*PS0W6:	but they put it in to the meter in . 
*PS0W2:	Well well th this was the problem it was gon na cost I do n't know how many hundreds of pounds just to have the s gas supply put to the hall and we felt that at that time we could n't do it . 
*PS0W6:	Well I had the one . 
*PS0W4:	Presumably there 's no gas here is there . 
*PS0W2:	There 's gas here . 
*PS0W6:	Yes . 
*PS0W4:	You have got gas here yes mhm there 's gas . 
*PS0W2:	Well that might be that might be worth a a query . 
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	I mean that might be worth a query if the Finance Committee are sort of erm er er worrying about the heating . 
*PS0W6:	Well well we 'll have to see what what the what the er insurance man says first . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah . 
*PS0W4:	Yes mhm . 
*PS0W6:	but it 's a long time pl er term we 've got ta look at it and we 've got to do something about it for for heating if we 're going to use it if we 're going to let it or something . 
*PS0W2:	Yeah . 
*PS0W6:	then there 's got to be heat in there . 
*PS0W4:	Mm But you see the rent Father . 
*PS0W6:	We each want the same same thing . 
*PS0W4:	the rent of the hall is very cheap . 
*PS0W6:	Yes but they 'll have to . 
*PS0W4:	But they have to put fifty pence into the . 
*PS0W6:	Yeah . 
*PS0W4:	the meter . 
*PS0W6:	yeah well the gas ones the same . 
*PS0W4:	That 's that 's fifty pence a yes . 
*PS0W6:	0 . 
*PS0W4:	Mhm mhm . 
*PS0W6:	They have to sort out . 
*PS0W4:	But i i i if you find out about the insurance see what that is . 
*PS0W6:	Yes . 
*PS0W4:	and then perhaps sort of contact the gas people again and see . 
*PS0W6:	Yes . 
*PS0W4:	I mean this was how long ago . 
*PS0W2:	Oh this was seven years ago I suppose . 
*PS0W4:	About seven years ago so . 
*PS0W6:	two years ago when I was at we had the gas put into the hall . 
*PS0W4:	Yeah . 
*PS0W6:	They did n't charge to put it in . 
*PS0W4:	No Well it would be worthwhile investigating anyway . 
*PS0W6:	Yeah . 
*PS0W4:	after we hear about the insurance . 
*PS0W6:	find out yeah it 's all an ongoing thing . 
*PS0W4:	Yeah it 's all go is n't it . 
*PS0W6:	Okay then thanks . 
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	It 's good is n't it . 
*PS0W4:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	Well I think so . 
*PS0W4:	0 . 
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W4:	I thought I was giving you a lift . 
*KE2PSUG:	0 . 
*PS0W4:	Well I I thought of perhaps you know of giving you a lift somewhere .
