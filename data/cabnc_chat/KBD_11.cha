*UNK:	When it 
*BAR:	if it's
*UNK:	when it got to the stage that we only open like, one and a half days a week
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	we said, well it's not really worth, from your company's point of view, such an expensive piece of   (.) equipment for a   (.) I mean, (        ) was doing the process thing then, you know, we could utilize the equipment elsewhere.But, er, if you're not really gonna be    (.)  ((break in recording))still like split cups but   (.) well 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	it's, it's useful for the gas sort of thing

*BAR:	Oh yeah!
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	Yeah, I know that.Well when everything's sorted, that's it.
*UNK:	So you got, there's a lot of wasted space in this club.
*BAR:	Mm!
*UNK:	Phenomenal amount of wasted space.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	I used to think what  (        ) .
*BAR:	Where does this lead to?
*UNK:	This is the back of the, the disco.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	Right, there was a disco 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	console   (.) on the back.
*BAR:	Mm.Right.
*UNK:	Aye.And I got, I've got about   (.) two hundred of these   (.) poly-foam chairs as well back 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	there, which   (.) I got off one of my   (        ) 
*BAR:	Here's the piano.
*UNK:	That's the piano.
*BAR:	 ((laugh))  (.) And these are  (        ) .
*UNK:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] . (.) I mean we have   (.) on a couple of occasions always done like fortieths and that, on a   (.) couple of them.We actually set up   (.) buffet in there
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	which worked   (.) reasonably well.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	I think one did it, you know what I mean
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	tart it up and whatever.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	Erm, and what else worked well   (.) erm   (.) for a while, we were doing the women's darts.And we had   (.) about three boards in here and we had a board in there.I mean, there must be about seven boards in all.
*BAR:	Right.
*BAR:	Was that a competition was it?
*UNK:	No, it was a weekly   (.) thing.Because, what they were doing, they were going to individual pubs
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*UNK:	Which couldn't cope
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	with it, and th wha on their knock-outs and their cups and everything they 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	wanted them all in one place.So
*BAR:	Aha
*UNK:	but erm   (.) there was a bit of jealousy in the la licensees started getting a bit er   (.) er
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	because we're taking the trade away from them, you know   (.) they would have obviously had 
*BAR:	They were all the other pubs and the darts  (        ) ?
*UNK:	Yeah.They'd have had a lot  (        ) .
*BAR:	A bit of competition from other place.
*UNK:	Well, at that stage we were talking to   (.) the men's darts secretary came along and was saying, he'd be quite interested in, in   (.) knocking up, you know, one of the Lancashire matches or something 
*BAR:	Oh!
*UNK:	like that.It's a 
*BAR:	Well it's the stage for it int it?
*UNK:	Th thing is, you can put it on there, put it on sta you can er film it, and bang it on the big screen over there.
*BAR:	Mhm.
*UNK:	which is what I, I, in the   (        ) I had Eric Bristow and Maureen  one night, and, I mean, it was just little dart board in the corner, but what I did was, I had a big screen like that   (.) and I just got   (.) student television service just to film it live and just throw it straight back up onto the big 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	onto the thing, so   (.) you know, it was like   (.) well it's better than being at the telly.I mean, it's better 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	than
*BAR:	Watching that.
*UNK:	because th on the telly they haven't got those.I mean, I'm 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	amazed at the, on the world championships, they've only got those   (.) lighting up boards 
*BAR:	That's right.
*UNK:	haven't they?
*BAR:	That's right, yeah.
*UNK:	You know, and, I, instead of having   (.) I mean 
*BAR:	Screen up.
*UNK:	why they don't just put a screen up 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	that beats me, you know.They do other sport etcetera.See what I mean?
*BAR:	Mm.Yeah.
*UNK:	Well that's part of the course because, we need to sort, with Johnny's entertainment out with a roof.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Alright.
*UNK:	They've got two or three 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	little leaks.What it is is, the ventilation   (.) on the roof, ventilation shafts   (.) when the wind's driven   (.) it drives under and leaks through.And we get it in two or three places, the toilets are, are the key one.
*BAR:	And you don't see   (        ) with that.
*UNK:	Roof tiles are a fu  (.) bloody cost a fortune! (.) Yeah, so   (.) damn!I didn't bring the   (.) I'll, I'll go and   (.) I'll go and get the key for that.No, I'll let you see it, may as well while you're here.
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	You can see floor
*BAR:	What's the floor, underneath the floor?
*UNK:	Concrete.
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	I think, what, what   (.) you mean 
*BAR:	What is 
*UNK:	the actual car it's just carpet.You see it was out in the, probably is still out in the hall that one.
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	I mean, (        ) closed now, it 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	was open when Colin was there that time of the day.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	You know, you'd have ten, they say 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	ten, if there was only ten people in, they'd all be drinking six or seven 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	pints.
*UNK:	You haven't got a cold shelf in here.But I mean, that wouldn't be 
*BAR:	No.
*UNK:	that's not that difficult to put in here.
*BAR:	We'll get them 
*UNK:	Yeah.Exactly.
*BAR:	I think we'll be able to get them to put them in for us.
*BAR:	No.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Oh we've gotta pay that one   (        ) haven't we?To pay that one?
*BAR:	I think so, yeah.We've got two coming   (.) for ourselves, but
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	we'll be able to get them off Gary I think, yeah.
*BAR:	And we'll be able to say look, we want, we want   (.) how man how many have you got behind there?Have you got cold shelves behind there?
*UNK:	We've got, one, two, three, four behind there.
*BAR:	Right.So we could get a couple for here 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	couldn't we?
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	And you're painting over that.I've gotta come and paint
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	I mean, really, if, if you look fifteen thousand, if you could spend fifteen thousand doing all this up
*BAR:	Ah yeah.
*UNK:	and you could write off barrels, you could still improve your barrel er, your barrels a week int it?
*BAR:	Oh yeah!Yeah.
*UNK:	You need, er you need to
*BAR:	Definitely.
*BAR:	Yeah.Oh yeah.
*UNK:	And you don't need   (.) say, you don't need, you only need like   (.) one private function a week.
*BAR:	And promotions, you know, Malibu promotion night where the 
*UNK:	Do promotions, that's right.Yeah.And yo and your er   (.) see what I mean about this area up here, I mean it's not a bad   (.) thingy.
*BAR:	No.No I mean, I don't think 
*UNK:	Just time to sit and have a drink and all that.
*BAR:	Well
*UNK:	I mean, if you wanted you can use the big screen.You see cos, we put it that position cos er, the only dead part of the club is just   (.) literally 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	in the corner.O the other way you can see the screen from everywhere.Erm
*BAR:	I mean, how much do you reckon it'll cost?If we said ou the carpet, we said well a certain area of the carpet wants   (        ) 
*BAR:	 ((sigh)) 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Erm
*UNK:	I mean, it's quite a big floor area   (.) when you look at it.
*BAR:	How much did you say 
*BAR:	Yeah, probably.
*BAR:	in all your nightclubs and, what did you say they do a  (        ) ?We'll   (.) nothing, we'll, won't be able to paint the floor and put the carpets down on 
*UNK:	I mean I 
*BAR:	that floor.
*UNK:	I would have thought   (.) to be honest, I would have thought you don't need any of that area
*BAR:	No.
*UNK:	carpeted.
*BAR:	Just to, probably, very ends of   (        ) 
*BAR:	Don't you, you want your raised area, this 
*UNK:	You want your two raised areas carpeted.
*BAR:	Er, by, by the bar would you say it   (.) no not right in front 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	you know, have that 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	running to about three foot back.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Yeah that
*BAR:	Well
*BAR:	but you don't really want it up to the bar if you're going to get 
*BAR:	No I'm saying that 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	you go right up to the bar
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you want it up to 
*UNK:	See if you put artists on   (.) and you have this area as   (.) some kind of   (.) without carpet on
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	in some ways, you haven't put, you can actually be, you know, dancing on this area.I mean,tha that's the problem we got at the moment.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	On Mary's do, what we did, I put   (        ) soul machine over here where the screen was
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	so people could dance on the er   (.) on the actual dance floor if they wanted.Erm   (.) I mean, it's not ideal but it really, it worked.It wor even, providing you haven't got a lot of   (.) if you've only got about a hundred people it's not too bad that cos it, it   (.) also creates a bit more atmosphere.But, it's a better   (.) i it's not a   (.) bad designed place in a sense that, that   (.) I mean, it's a reasonable size room
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	and you ca and three hundred people er, you can take three hundred quite 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	easily   (.) I mean, you know, we've had four, fives   (.) hundred in.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	You can take three hundred quite easily.But   (.) the erm   (.) the other thing about it is if you have a hundred people in   (.) it can be so also be a good atmosphere, you know?
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	Yet,i it's not one of those rooms where, if 
*BAR:	No.
*UNK:	you only get a hu yo you're struggling if you've only a got a hundred.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	Erm, what I'm, I've just arranged somebody to redo our speaker syste our original system with tannoys, we blew our tannoys   (.) speakers, and   (.) I didn't bother getting them replaced because we were going for a rock crowd   (.) so we just used Bernie and Nigel
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	P A there.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	What I've got, is I've got four of these directional speakers, there's two up and two on here   (.) and then two big bass ones which sit on a floor back there.And, so it's very loud on the dance floor but you can actually talk out, out here.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	Which I thought we need to redo if we're gonna get private bookings.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	Cos the one thing you always get when you've got a mixture of people, I mean, all thi this needs recovering basically as well.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	But I mean, that's not a big job it's just 
*BAR:	No.
*UNK:	re relinoing it basically.
*BAR:	Oh yeah. (        ) 
*UNK:	Oh yeah.
*BAR:	 (        )  (.) Filling the smoke 
*UNK:	Smoke machine 
*BAR:	up.
*UNK:	Yeah, you got a smoke machine   (.) we, we, we would set in little, in a hole in the back.
*BAR:	And all of these air conditioning valves are on?
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	Actually I'm having the,a th I mean I can get, I'm getting our system back in operation.It, it was gonna cost me a thousand but I've done a deal with a guy who'd got stuck with some in Manchester so it's gonna cost me five hundred which I'm getting done this Friday.Erm   (.) to put a satellite   (.) system, to put a satellite in would be three hundred quid in total.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	So   (.) I mean it's   (.) that's only one   (.) that's only one good'un, good night using it innit, a year?Pays for that.
*BAR:	Yo you're light, the er ceiling   (.) could you not get away with covering the, get the lights a colour blue?And er   (.) and   (.) you know, tidying up ceiling obviously   (        ) 
*UNK:	Right.
*BAR:	I mean, there's lots of bits and pieces you need for   (.) a 
*BAR:	I mean, if you just   (.) cover all the areas that were really 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	bad, er   (.) I reckon, I says, well what do you think   (.) yourself in, in, in
*UNK:	Well the, the big   (.) the single biggest cost is, is what we do with this   (.) a carpet area.
*BAR:	Mm. (        ) 
*UNK:	That's our single biggest cost, cos   (.) as I say, I had three quotes in total, and they were all sort of between thirteen and twenty three.
*BAR:	Yeah.Thousand.
*UNK:	Yeah.But that's, having said that, that's to carpet all this area 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	that back area I've just taken you through, that, the staircase, and the corridors out there.I mean, that's the carpet ev I just said like   (.) I wanted a quote to carpet 
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	everywhere.Erm   (.) what we were doing is,i what it was for, was for, for prospective buyers, they wanted erm   (.) a justification for 
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.
*UNK:	the money they were gonna spend.I mean, they wouldn't have spent that money.But, they wanted   (.) written quotes for   (.) a justification more or less.
*BAR:	Do you think it's better being like this?Looking there, or is it better sort of, clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space and
*UNK:	Well it's quite, it's a reasonable size 
*BAR:	I know it's a fair size, but   (        ) 
*UNK:	It's a fair size dancing 
*BAR:	you know 
*UNK:	space actually, I mean, you get about a hundred people on here, it's, it's, it's alright.In fact the, in fact it's,i at times it's too big.That's, my one, I don't know how you'd ever get over it, but that's my one   (.) criticism of the thing is that sometimes when you walk in   (.) it's the first thing that hits you and unless people are dancing   (.) it creates a cold atmosphere.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	Erm
*BAR:	I mean, if you've got your group on   (.) there's nothing better than having your floor there and are dancing on   (.) the floor at, at, in front of the group kind of thing like 
*UNK:	Yeah, but I mean a a if you have any
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	anything like a, a, a group takes all of this.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	If you have a
*BAR:	That's right.
*UNK:	a main group up, you know 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	you're struggling to get
*BAR:	But then if you did this floor space like 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	we said
*UNK:	Oh yeah.Yeah.I mean, I, I actually don't think you need carpet on   (.) I mean I, I don't 
*BAR:	Oh no.
*UNK:	think, I don't think you need any of this carpet, to be honest.
*BAR:	 (        ) black  (        ) , would that look nice?Black   (        ) carpet.
*UNK:	I dunno.
*BAR:	Ah, cos Peter was saying, I dunno, I dunno   (.) what the   (.) black  (        ) .
*BAR:	Don't have to be black  (        ) , you just want, you want something that er   (.) I don't know really, you'd have to think about it wouldn't you?
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	Yeah.Oh yeah.
*UNK:	Could do with probably somebody who knows what they're doing on it.
*BAR:	You want the carpet area full of seating 
*BAR:	Actually one thing Barry 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	don't you?
*UNK:	That's right.
*BAR:	Give it a bit of warmth when they're sitting right 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	down. (        ) the area.
*BAR:	That's one thing Ben  said though, which was quite useful, he said get some people down   (.) pick their brains.
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	You know, let them come down and give a quote 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	for whatever you're looking at 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	and pick what they thought, was the best thing you could do, and then don't, don't tell you but   (.) get them made.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	You know, and like 
*BAR:	That's right.
*BAR:	I say it, these guys are working on this all the time.
*UNK:	I mean, on a normal night   (.) it's, the raised areas fill up with people   (.) seated.
*BAR:	Yeah.

*BAR:	Mm. (.) And Jean's corridor.
*UNK:	Jean's corridor.
*BAR:	I resume, see if   (.) the places are  (        ) .
*UNK:	It, and we had ninety on it on Saturday.Bus dri bus driver nearly we nearly hit the   (.) the thing nearly keeled over cos he didn't realize how many he'd got upstairs and he went round the bend and it started to go. [laughing] And then   (.) cos you're not supposed to stand up upstairs  [] .
*BAR:	See the crack int bog.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	I think it's got a bit damaged on Saturday, then he put him back
*BAR:	Supposed to lift base. (        )  (.) But er   (.) generally needs
*BAR:	Oh I know.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Aye.
*UNK:	The trouble is, toilets are toilets and they don't   (.) and they 
*BAR:	Oh aye.
*UNK:	get damaged, I mean, you just have to keep   (.) bloody working on them, I
*BAR:	That's nice, in the toilet.
*BAR:	Yeah, take them in.
*BAR:	That's right mate.
*UNK:	As I say, it needs cleaning up of graffiti and a little bit of adjustment and
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	This is the problem, er,le 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	leaking roof.Cos these bloody tiles are expensive!
*BAR:	Yeah.

*BAR:	No.
*UNK:	I mean, everything's sorted out, then I will.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	I think what it probably needs, is just a guard round the top ventilation things
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	cos a they're open and   (.) the wind drives under it.
*BAR:	Well it   (.) and shut up to there with   (        ) and that you can

*BAR:	That's what I mean, and we'll be alright.
*UNK:	See   (.) this is er   (        ) that goes along here. (        ) . But what I wanna do is trough this and bury these pipes.

*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Put these under there.

*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	I mean you'd take   (.) could take twenty guys stood there.
*BAR:	I mean, (        ) damage is being done, say you have got seven guys there stood, what's 
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	the other one doing, I think can, can pull 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	this off.
*UNK:	Yeah.I know.
*BAR:	So they've nothing better to do.You got them on trough, then they're saying alright we'll do it somewhere else.

*BAR:	That's right.
*BAR:	Six is it?Oh.
*UNK:	Erm, you know   (.) er, I can't remember who they are, but it wasn't clientele, but I mean we could, you know we could

*BAR:	Up here.
*UNK:	and keep the carpet on the high   (.) seating areas.

*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	a little bit better, but I mean
*BAR:	 (        )

*BAR:	And practical really, isn't it?
*UNK:	you know.
*BAR:	As I say, people aren't going in in there to look at, oh! what a pretty carpet you've got.
*UNK:	No.

*UNK:	It's only to create an impression when you're doing it in the day time.
*BAR:	Yeah.That's right.
*UNK:	I mean, I don't know whether you've thought any more about that   (.) idea that Colin had, but, I mean, I don't know,yo cos you haven't   (.) said you do, you haven't really looked round it.
*BAR:	No, that's right, you know, the, the, the only thing we've, we've   (.) actually gonna trying to get that into a   (.) the bar   (.) is er     (.)  (        )  (.) segregate 
*UNK:	Perhaps er   (.) Jean's left actually  (        ) .
*BAR:	 ((cough)) 
*UNK:	This is   (.) this was   (.) the, the cloakroom and what we were   (.) what we were intending doing originally

*UNK:	On top of what's on?Right.
*BAR:	I don't know whether they were actually sitting right where the bevel or whatever.I know this sort of stuff is   (.) we had similar to when I worked in the shop   (.) er, used to, he had three quarters of this, guy come round in a van or whatever, back of a van 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and he laid it himself.
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	 (        ) and by the entrance and whatever er

*BAR:	So 
*BAR:	layer just, just to make certain.
*BAR:	Summat like that really, is, is obviously
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	And it's just stuck on int it?

*BAR:	Oh right.
*UNK:	I mean, so when we do have to do redecoration we just gotta let the volunteers in.

*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Er 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	some paper   (.) them toilets   (.) cos er, I'm, you know, I say, from our   (.) our, both side is   (.) something that's er   (.) I mean, everybody's looking purely from   (        ) and return sales.All you're looking at is for an income  (        ) , an income from it   (.) and er   (.) I reckon   (.) can do very well.

*BAR:	And five, ten of them 
*BAR:	And they'll all, they'll all be drinkers.
*UNK:	Yeah.But I mean   (.) sa ta so there's an at little atmosphere there anyway

*BAR:	As you said, they haven't actually, you know, it'd be   (.) if you could get some sort of portable

*BAR:	you know.Erm 
*UNK:	Well you ca you ca you can get that.
*BAR:	You can get, you can do something

*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Like you say, if you get your satellite T V in there 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you know, you can
*UNK:	Yeah.

*UNK:	Yeah.That's right.
*BAR:	It won't cost any to give it a go would it?
*BAR:	No.If Colin's   (.) if Colin's up for it, it wouldn't at all.I mean, it needs to perhaps   (.) perhaps they can do something for the first couple
*BAR:	Oh yeah, need some sort of er
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	idea to get it going and get it off the ground even if you   (.) you put your beer on at, well I just thought of couple   (        ) Boddingtons put their   (.) they're   (.) they're gonna put their, they're gonna put there's at a pound a pint.
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	You know, just to attract some people, you know, approach the brewery, say look what about a few keg?And if you get   (.) two or three keg   (.) put that money into free stock you know.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Say you   (        ) 
*UNK:	Cleaner's not, the cleaner's not done behind here yet.
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	If you open it up, if you do get it open, and advertise it at Boddingtons a pound a pint, get them straight   (.) to come in.You're not making a fortune at first, but once you get it going
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	You said about traditional
*BAR:	The only other thing is the  (        ) .
*BAR:	Depends where your money is really.
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	Whe whe where's your cellar?
*UNK:	Right underneath.Right at the bottom.
*BAR:	Yeah, but if, if you
*BAR:	How big's your fire exit, entrance?
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	 (        )  (.) the fire exit   (        ) 
*BAR:	You could put it behind, you could feed it through the wall behind to where that 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	spacious room is where all your chairs are couldn't you?
*UNK:	Yeah.We probably could, yeah.Th well, it's no, it's not quite the back.
*BAR:	 (        )  (.) how would you get in there?
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Yeah, that's the, that's the thing I was 
*BAR:	Well, it's got, it's a bit dry this.
*UNK:	I know.It's a bloody, yeah.
*BAR:	You can still  (        ) . (        ) 
*UNK:	It's fucking ridiculous!
*BAR:	Erm   (.) cos you'd tell the brewery wouldn't you?
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	The only other thing to do is, is do what er   (.) er, we did at one time and just get a   (.) bright beer and open it up and   (.) er, and then pull it.And have it.
*BAR:	 (        )  ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	I know.
*BAR:	Now there's a thought.
*UNK:	It er, you'd have problem with er
*BAR:	But would you?
*UNK:	Depends tha I don't know what sort of draw you can put on that pump here. (.) They're getting smart.
*BAR:	But I wanna do what the Three Miners do in Lancaster don't they?
*BAR:	That's that er   (.) that's a traditional beer innit? (        ) 
*UNK:	Yeah.That's right, yeah.
*BAR:	 (        ) they gotta   (        ) but he's knocking it straight 
*UNK:	Yeah.

*BAR:	It's just getting it up here.
*BAR:	 [laughing] Yeah!Yeah  [] !Yeah, very strong lad this.
*BAR:	You might have to do it later.
*UNK:	Can I look at the telly?
*BAR:	Yeah, course you can.I was gonna 
*BAR:	It's in here.
*BAR:	suggest that.
*BAR:	Up here and then get  (        ) .
*BAR:	Oh, oh that's my order for Thursday.
*UNK:	Oh right.
*BAR:	Have you got line cleaner?Yeah?

*BAR:	Yeah?
*BAR:	That's put a  (        ) .
*UNK:	A fair, int it doing?
*BAR:	The bar, the bar, on the bar.
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	The bar's there, I mean I was thinking you had your stool, painted that white on
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	or a red   (.) a deep 
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*BAR:	sort of red behind the bar, maybe get a couple more like that.
*UNK:	Yeah, a lick of paint and, and 
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*UNK:	and, and that, you know and you can 
*BAR:	And then we'll fill the shelves up.
*BAR:	That's right.
*UNK:	All, all, one thing we haven't discussed is, is these ar these arrears int it, that we've got?This, the rates 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	is the biggest one int it?
*BAR:	Right.Right.
*UNK:	Now, I don't know if it's worth asking 
*BAR:	Well I could 
*UNK:	council to, if you could like lump it with the next year 's.
*BAR:	El e Elliel, Elliel said that er they could probably   (.) twist the council's arm
*BAR:	What's that for Barry?
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Well, this, you know we're on about this money
*BAR:	Yes.
*UNK:	well, there is, there is ba bad debts, you know which er
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	I don't know if I've got them here.
*BAR:	How much is that for?
*UNK:	Well it was er   (.) it was about
*BAR:	Twenty two.
*UNK:	here we are, that's it er   (.) it's rent which we we're gonna clear
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	there's twelve for rates, and the twelve and, other two's ours which we're   (.) we 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	can, we can stand on that.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	You've got, you've got like   (.) water rate, twelve hundred, er, rates, twelve   (.) but er, what we could try to do is approach them and see if we can lump it in with this year and that, obviously have to pay higher
*BAR:	I mean, some of it is   (.) is the next two month anyway   (.) erm 
*UNK:	Yeah.But we we'd usually have   (.) no 
*BAR:	but 
*UNK:	rents, er we've no er   (.) we've lease to pay back have we or owt like that?
*BAR:	Oh and the other   (.) the other thing is, is, is by asking Fred for
*BAR:	To pay.
*BAR:	That's right.
*UNK:	But even so, then ask Fred on the long term would be ideal.Er, the biggest thing is for us is   (.) is making payable for you.
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean 
*UNK:	At first 
*BAR:	we've not gone any further with this Fre with Fred because 
*BAR:	No.
*BAR:	we're just leaving it   (.) so we sort ourselves out first on, on how 
*BAR:	Yes.
*BAR:	we feel happy with it and
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and whe how, how, whether you want   (.) Fred involved in, in what way.
*UNK:	Well it's really that's needed be here, you know, if we ca 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	if we can 
*BAR:	And 
*UNK:	if we can resolve it   (.) with   (.) cos then you're getting summat on a different style of thinking to that, you know, I know Fred doesn't wanna be involved but then you've always got somebody, well we'll have to go and see Fred first.
*BAR:	Mm.
*UNK:	And, and I don't know.
*BAR:	Yeah, you could work it 
*UNK:	Go see Fred and he's probably got a few more pounds ready available than 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	than we have.
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*UNK:	You know, that's the er 
*BAR:	That's right.
*UNK:	bit difficult.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	And that's your er, cos er personally 
*BAR:	Oh, I've got the 
*UNK:	I'll say that it's not.
*BAR:	accounts in various   (.) off-shore   [laughing] islands and, and
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	black bin liners in his back garden  [] .
*UNK:	If we can sort him out with rates and, I don't know.
*BAR:	If he can o if we can offset, if we can use all, if he'll   (        ) out time type of thing 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	with that
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	erm   (.) the oh er
*UNK:	You've gotta put an offer in and pay it so much a month haven't you or something and, and, and get it paid off over a period of time?
*BAR:	And then you can do it without Fred and, really, with Fred is, is at the end of day you could pro  (.) proof pay load could go back to yourself and I, I E  (.) and ourselves, but by having him that other cut   (.) you're gonna be saying well   (.) it's all a bit more than   (.) your share.I mean, from my point of view   (.) I don't think he's ever 
*BAR:	I don't think Fred'd be looking for anything as a return.
*UNK:	No.
*BAR:	Not in the shor 
*BAR:	I'd be quite happy to come 
*BAR:	not in the short term.Not in the short term.
*BAR:	you get tucked into it, and obviously there we'll keep it   (.) sort of low profile.But giving it a good clean out   (.) and getting 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	it dus painted behind the things whatever, come on Sunday or whatever   (.) and just say that you might 
*BAR:	In return, yeah.Just take a
*BAR:	quite keen just to sort of get 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	mucked into it
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	just to save money
*UNK:	See if you can get
*BAR:	but as long as, I say, the biggest thing from my point er   (.) is   (.) not to so lose money if you can do from where we're going.
*BAR:	No.
*BAR:	And use the fifteen grand to its best   (.) image in the way that you feel then you can turn round and run a club   (.) so it can get people in.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	And we can get the lighting in.Because that's what your best thing is
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	you've got the ideas   (.) and th the motions.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	And for yourself, and what we don't wanna do is like I say, is spend money that   (.) is just gonna disappear and say shit!We haven't really improved the pub's   (.) barrelage   (.) if goes away.
*BAR:	No.I mean,th the other aspect of the, of the fif  (.) the other aspect of the, the brewery and me that I was   (.) talking about, er I'm thinking about is that we we could do with   (.) you know, okay those,th those figures are   (.) I mean, unless they're really realistic it's gonna be   (.) you know, six months or so
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	before we start getting up to the kind of figures where we can actually see a   (.) you know 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	a profit each week 
*UNK:	Mm.
*BAR:	a a, a, reasonably substantial profit, I mean 
*UNK:	That's right, yeah.
*BAR:	so, with the best will in the world it's going to be six months so let's   (.) so we need a little of breathing space
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	on that six months.Now   (.) er, er obviously if, if we can, if we can get the money off the brewery cos   (.) you know, if we can get a little bit more 
*BAR:	That's right, yes.
*BAR:	than we actually need to spend that   (.) that 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	enables us to   (.) you know, have that breathing space   (.) erm   (.) so we can start 
*BAR:	Well what, what we can, you know I say, he's offering us this fifteen unsecured if we can, mind you 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	I don't know if we can squeeze any more or what
*UNK:	I reckon
*BAR:	but, but, you know if say well look, you know, we could do with twenty five and he turns round and   (        ) he might say well   (.) you know,yo he might say no
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	but we know we've got fifteen just to get us 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	going.
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.
*BAR:	What he said then is look, you know   (.) hey he's, all you're saying really 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	is ah, if your barrelage is there then what we do is buy   (.) five or six barrels from Morecambe Bay Wines.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	You can soon get rid of those.
*BAR:	You can say Morecambe Bay Wines and buy   (.) all his
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	cos what I, I just said to him I said look, I says a er sometimes I says it's an awkward time drop for us.Says well we'll get it delivered here   (.) you know, only without 
*BAR:	Yeah well that's 
*BAR:	invoice.
*BAR:	That's what we wanted innit?
*BAR:	Well what we do, what we use 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*BAR:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	What we do is buy it barrelled and and 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	get out be 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	Morecambe Bay License form.
*BAR:	Barrel or keg.
*UNK:	Because we ca we can live on thirty pound on barrel   (        ) can't we?I think we can do.
*BAR:	I'd like you to   (.) just purely myself, I'm not saying I'm   (.) right and you're not right and people like 
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	my o my own personal view is if we just   (.) pay the fifteen and it's sort of off in there straight away and then spend   (.) but not to sort of say, well you can spend it and update it can't you?But spend what we feel is gonna make the club
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	better image like you say
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	somebody comes to look at it just for a view   (.) I mean, I say, I, I'm quite happy coming like I said th  (.) if you motion behind there, make the bar presentable   (.) we'll fill it out with stock   (.) then that'll look better
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	but if we do display 
*UNK:	Put more stock in.
*BAR:	we've got a load 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	of tent cards and display things 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	that could decorate that.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	You know, and we'll do it ourselves, I say   (.) I mean, what you want Barry is like wanna keep it   (.) low profile.
*BAR:	Mm.
*BAR:	But we've both got time to sort, I say, somebody, we'd enjoy doing it.Because we, we, we either do it ourselves and spend 
*BAR:	Before the cricket season.
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	I mean, America are getting a private cup for here.
*BAR:	 ((laugh))

*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and your promotions and 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*UNK:	That's something we will, we will be able to do is, you know, is 
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean things like what I want on desperately quickly is Rebel Yell cos they're   (.) spending a fortune in the rock, well all our punters all know it.I mean you go down in London it's the   (.) it's just like Rebel Yell everywhere, but it's all heavy rock   (.) so 
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	I mean it's just perfect for that, but   (.) I know they do a display unit and things like 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	that.But I mean, I have to go 
*BAR:	Well that's all it wants.

*BAR:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and I said well I want it on but he said you'll have to go for this.

*UNK:	Oh well, yeah.
*BAR:	quite a pleasant evening.See, my idea originally was that   (.) cos it comes back from when I used to go in the   (.) in the Blue Anchor in Lancaster after work   (.) I mean we had everybody in there!We had like market traders in there   (.) managers of Marks and Spencers and Woolies 
*UNK:	Yeah.

*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	o'clock?
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	It destroyed all that.
*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	And then er, they brought it back and then they started doing   (.) to quarter to six, but it still wasn't good enough cos   (.) you can't, you can't have all these people in suits and briefcases stood outside a pub for quarter of an hour waiting   [laughing] for it open  [] , you know 
*UNK:	No.
*BAR:	I mean it   (.) wasn't good

*UNK:	Yeah.
*BAR:	the sort of
*UNK:	Well that's it, yeah.
