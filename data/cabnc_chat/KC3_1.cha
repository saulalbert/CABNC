*FRE:	Hello  how are you? •31415_33225•
*JAN:	Er   •33725_33915•
*FRE:	 (        ) 
*JAN:	How are you? •34045_34295•
*FRE:	Alright. •34295_34545•
*JAN:	I'm not gonna pass it down to you. •35015_39125•
*FRE:	You're not? •39125_39485•
*JAN:	No. •39835_39995•
*FRE:	Are you sure of that? •40135_40805•
*JAN:	I'm gonna leave you to it. •40995_42835•
        Pete  •42835_43035•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAN:	it's Fred . •43115_43985•
        I'll leave, I, I won't stay with you cos I don't want you get too   •44275_49915•
*FRE:	Okay then. •63475_63745•
*PET:	Collapse, me too. •63745_64095•
*JAN:	Go in and sit down a sec. •64095_65135•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	I'm moderately well. •65135_67185•
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Let me come quite clean  on that and tell you that you, at the very moment I hope you are being recorded. •67185_71755•
*PET:	Good heavens. •72315_73005•
        a cross section. •85105_104165•
*FRE:	Yes er actually the lady dropped in on me yesterday so I  •104275_112965•
*PET:	Well I suppose it's erm •115455_130375•
*FRE:	Sounds quite an interesting •132025_133305•
*PET:	an interesting idea. •134765_139375•
*FRE:	Yeah, I thought so. •140055_142645•
*PET:	I'm not convinced  that  we can establish  exactly what we're after  erm  the sort of conversation or communication  •144725_168625•
*FRE:	What  •168675_168765•
*PET:	that people use. •168765_169855•
*FRE:	Yeah, it seems to me that erm  they are  it's er going to be a comparative thing  from  nineteen ninety two, and then in, we'll say nineteen ninety seven for argument's sake. •170265_189125•
*PET:	The trouble is  •192505_193135•
*FRE:	Or, or or gradually er on. •193135_195035•
*PET:	increasingly I think nowadays  people  converse in  not a foreign language, because the  terms that people use are  familiar but meanings that they  intend  are not, and the computer people are the worst because they use ordinary words  which mean completely different things in the  •198235_248125•
*FRE:	Than  •250105_250365•
*PET:	context of,of people just  •250365_251925•
*FRE:	Yeah  •252925_253185•
*PET:	talking •253285_253585•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •253795_254565•
*PET:	and  there they, they talk about a database  which is a  it's not an English word •254565_266285•
*FRE:	No a computer •266475_267545•
*PET:	so what on earth does it mean? •267645_269275•
*FRE:	Mm. •269765_270005•
*PET:	Well  I used the word to er in a report I was writing   years ago   it was ten years ago  and I knew what I meant but I hadn't sat down and defined what I meant, perhaps I should have done. •270645_291535•
*FRE:	Mm. •292195_292515•
*PET:	Since then a   program's been written called Database One which means something completely different  which has been updated to Database Two and Three and may be Four, which mean different things, that's why they've got different numbers, they do more clever things  and  nowadays you talk, you hear people talking about databases and they all mean different things. •293395_328095•
        They usually mean  a file  of information which is processed by different, completely different  •329545_343475•
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	computer systems. •344225_344785•
        One, as it were, to pick out addresses, one to pick out  socio-economic groups, one to pick out motor cars, one to pick out number of bedrooms, one to pick out whatever, and  trivially or, or superficially everyone says the same thing, a database, it's on the database, now  •346965_368375•
*FRE:	Yeah. •368585_368995•
*PET:	the file is there, that's a computer term, or  exactly that, a a, a listing of names, addresses and houses and cars and everything else, and a file is a defined computer term, what you do with it is the next thing •369365_391125•
*FRE:	Mm. •391485_391615•
*PET:	and  the way in which you do what you do with it  depends on what you put in. •392185_402175•
        If you only put people in who are owner-occupiers then you will not have all the information, all the people, who are in rented accommodation. •402275_413115•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •413465_414405•
*PET:	If you only put in people who live in houses, you'll not have all the people who live in maisonettes and flats •414615_420835•
*FRE:	Mm yeah  •421025_421825•
*PET:	. •_•
        If you are  not eligible to be put in if you don't have a motor car then you're discounting an enormous number of people who may have motorcycles or motor caravans or, you know, something which is perfectly valid but it invalidates the information that you think you are getting out of the file because you only put in  certain  perfectly reasonable, groups of er of things and in, in, in Boots there's a, there's a er there's a  a wonderful expression or   actually is, is the one I'm particularly thinking about, you know we, we sell  shall we say a million bottles of aspirin a year, it is in fact considerably more than that, and that is perfectly reasonable and valid and  mm  but  in the definition of that we obviously only included what Boots the Chemists sold because that's all the people who •421825_501985•
*FRE:	Yeah, that's  •502155_502965•
*PET:	sold bottles  •502965_503215•
*FRE:	Yeah  •503215_503715•
*PET:	of aspirin •504085_504635•
*FRE:	Yeah. •504635_504695•
*PET:	made by Boots. •504755_505645•
        But now of course there's Crooks and that means, not bottles of aspirins, bad example, but Strepsils the lozenges for example, are now sold in an enormous range of private pharmacies which are not Boots and they are therefore completely outside the term output, it may be a restricted term, it may not be the one we want, but that is what it was meant and that is what the number is generated from. •505645_535245•
        Now of course er  we've sold the er chain of chemists in Canada who might have sold bottles of aspirin but, before we sold the chain, there was another enormous quantity of bottles of aspirin which wasn't defined, it was  something which was introduced after, long after we defined what we meant by outputs of aspirin. •535545_568935•
        And  the rate of change of, of, of  society  no the background to what we're doing, shifts the  goalposts is the fashionable term but what you thought you meant you no longer mean, and of course, if one is meticulously methodical, one adjusts the definition as the circumstances change •569005_597915•
*FRE:	Yes, yeah  •597915_599125•
*PET:	we don't do that. •599235_600135•
*FRE:	Yeah. •600335_600515•
*PET:	Not with a thing like outputs of aspirin, I mean everyone in Boots knows what the outputs of aspirin are  just strange that they are in fact three times what we'd thought they were and we've  course there's Crooks, course there's this, course there's that  tremendous discernment, tremendous understanding but if you haven't got that tremendous understanding, you've just joined the company, you  think you know  something and you don't because   not what they think they are •600765_631415•
*FRE:	Mm, mm •631815_631915•
*PET:	and er  •632485_633315•
*FRE:	Anyway, how are you? •633505_637765•
*PET:	I, I'm not too bad. •637765_643325•
        I feel that er  it's been a, a slightly peculiar month really. •643325_650385•
        Sort of, when we went to see Jan's mother for Christmas, I was saying to myself yeah, mm  this time last year  I was on holiday from work •659375_674185•
*FRE:	Yeah. •674245_674365•
*PET:	now I am retired and er  last year I was feeling a bit decrepit, you know I used to go for a full walk round  after lunch, after dinner, around where she lives and   it's much harder now . •674365_694245•
*FRE:	Mm, how long is it since you  knocked off work  sick? •695595_698175•
*PET:	Well I got flu in February last year •698235_703935•
*FRE:	February ninety one? •704255_706835•
*PET:	Yeah. •706835_707185•
*FRE:	so  ah. •707185_709285•
*PET:	And I never went back. •709775_711415•
*FRE:	Yeah. •711715_711905•
        But you were presumably feeling not well before then? •712445_716045•
        Yeah. •716045_716495•
*PET:	Well you, you, you, you, you know the, you know the, the scenario that   everything goes wrong, you know, everything goes wrong you know from time to time and you say to yourself oh it'll get better •716495_731835•
*FRE:	Mm. •732015_732155•
*PET:	it gets better  and you say ooh I'm tired •732225_735655•
*FRE:	Yes, that's right. •735665_737725•
*PET:	oh I've had a bit of a day or erm ooh, whatever it is, and erm  I  said to myself I am making allowances for being tired and getting, getting on a bit, you know, and  that went on for quite a while actually until I said to myself   I'm making up allowances you know, I'm  •737735_769595•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •769595_769885•
*PET:	there is something seriously, seriously queer  you know maybe it's a brain tumour, you know, maybe it's er I'm going potty, maybe it's all sorts of things, and fortunately I er I I went to the vet and erm   two weeks before he retired  but you know he, he was full of experience, that's really what I'm saying, he wouldn't be retiring otherwise  •770655_796425•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah  •796555_797115•
*PET:	and er he said to himself there's something I, I, I don't know what it is necessarily but there is something, go to a specialist and the specialist was very very good  you know blah blah blah blah you want some I want some tests, you know, so I had some tests, you know and  the crew that were doing the tests they knew what they were looking for and they either found it or they didn't, don't know. •797215_821465•
        But in due course  er  when I was still off with flu, erm back to the specialist  another test, you know, and  that was er  March, April of last year and the result of it was that there is something in there which is characteristic of what's, what we call multiple sclerosis which  seems to me is about as broad as it's long, you know, it's, it's a very large   •822245_862795•
*FRE:	Yes it's one of those erm illnesses that erm  the average person knows of it and, and knows  just a little bit but doesn't know very much. •862795_876815•
*PET:	Well and I, it seems to me that the, the er I mean you go, you go to the er to the M S Society and you find  just about everybody there, you know, you find people who, who are in wheelchairs, you find people who are walking around, you find people who are  er  controlling their diet  you find people who are taking extreme  dietary  precautions, no, not precautions, no they are taking extreme care of their diet, er er I mean  on gluten-free diets and you know what that means •877315_920325•
*FRE:	Mm. •921845_921985•
*PET:	you can't have anything which has any  •922065_923695•
*FRE:	Yeah. •923695_923795•
*PET:	wheat or barley or anything connected  and you find other people who are walking around relatively  independently and you find people who are walking around  slowly  •923895_940255•
*FRE:	Mm. •940685_941045•
*PET:	and you find erm  people like Lynn  you know, bless her, who now, who  isn't too bad when she's not too bad and isn't too good when she's not too good, you know, and  it is such a very very   Not only can you not put anything visibly in  in common with everyone that's got it, even the people  that have got it can't say  I cannot do this  period, they say oh well I'm not too good  now but maybe last week or maybe next week •943075_981249•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •981249_982839•
*PET:	So it's erm  it's all a bit peculiar. •982919_988969•
        You now have to get, in er er, because there was a sort of erm gradation from being off ill, which wasn't familiar, to being off long term sick which you can't have any experience of  to erm early retirement on health grounds and you just can't have any experience of that either  erm to being retired and it's,it's, it's quite interesting •988969_101966•
*FRE:	Mm. •102120_102139•
*PET:	going from one to the other in a year   •102139_102452•
*FRE:	Yeah, I thought it was longer than that you know. •102452_102761•
*PET:	Well erm the er  the first and most  horrific incidence was I think  in the May, no no no it wasn't May, it was  when we went down to to Cats in London  which was  at the end of  eighty nine  beginning of  ninety  and I went to, I went to the  the doctor in June of nineteen ninety and  odd things were sort of going through nineteen ninety, but it wasn't until nineteen ninety one  and I was off ill and  it all went •102761_110062•
*FRE:	Mm. •110396_110405•
*PET:	so it's, it's all part of er life's rich tapestry •110412_110955•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*PET:	and erm •110969_111043•
*FRE:	Yeah. •111043_111069•
        And is Janet, has Janet been able to go back to work yet? •111115_111662•
        Er obviously she's not fit at the moment. •111662_111844•
*PET:	Well •111844_111852•
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	she's been back •111852_112066•
*FRE:	She has? •112071_112136•
        Yeah. •112136_112150•
*PET:	and erm in fact she was back all the  all the, all the summer •112150_112659•
*FRE:	No I meant  fairly recently •112664_112908•
*PET:	No. •113023_113053•
*FRE:	is it since she er was not well, mm. •113053_113342•
*PET:	Erm we had gone down to, to, to  Bognor to the christening of her, our  nephew and  she wasn't too,that was in November, it was sort of middle of November, and  something was going wrong there and so when I, when I was retiring on the twenty seventh of November she couldn't come in and er  •113342_116915•
*FRE:	Was that to Boots? •116951_117461•
         •117471_•
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	yeah, yeah. •117481_117560•
*PET:	month of December was sort of off and  trying to do odd things and then she  went down with this, this flu er  which was  progressively worse since the new year. •117589_120084•
        So, you know what these girls are, they sort of I personally, you know, as it were a trained scientist, a certified chemist who   you tend to, to take a, a slightly  er diagnostic view of things, but that's not quite right, but you take a slightly  objective view of things and I, I, I, I've been thinking to myself   ah it is  rotten unfair on girls because sometimes sort of between about fifteen and twenty five, but now I suppose because they're all growing up so much earlier it's between ten and twenty, they have a pretty monumental change, they, and, and  it's not a bundle of laughs but they can talk to their friends, they can see their friends and talk to their mothers, they can get a vague way it's gonna affect them and they can  you know, sort of, let's say twenty, twenty five  settle into a routine which has  variations every, during the four weeks and they vary between individuals, I mean  it's well known •120114_129903•
*FRE:	Yeah, that's right. •129904_129986•
*PET:	you know that some don't really have a great deal of problem, others really do have a sort of off work for two or three days every month and it's not a bundle of laughs because, you know, that really must be difficult, but  they, they get a rough idea of how it  for them •129986_132151•
*FRE:	Mm. •132272_132278•
*PET:	and it goes through their, for the rest of their twenties, the rest of their thirties and most of their forties and then suddenly  bang  maybe something ghastly seems to be happening which they are absolutely unaware of, you know, they don't know why they are  crying or, or  er unable to cope with whatever they can't cope with  and that's it, that's them off and they start worrying about er osteoporosis and you know an enormous number of, of now medically defined problems of the menopause, and they may start going on to all sorts of things like hormone replacement therapy or even primrose oil or whatever the hell  and they're sitting there  at an age when they are  fairly loaded up with experience and maturity and all the rest of it  and they don't know what they are doing . •132463_139678•
        All the  wisdom of er in, in writing and doctors and everything else says  oh it all varies you know some do this and some do that  some go straight through in a regal dignified way and they just carry on into relatively old age, you know, smooth as  relaxed, nothing to worry about, away. •139678_142425•
*FRE:	Mm, mm  •142425_142475•
*PET:	And  tt Jan was er was  er wondering  during last year and went on to hormone replacement therapy because she was  and the doctor was a bit concerned about possible osteoporosis which is erm brittle bone   •142475_144766•
*FRE:	Yeah  •144830_144837•
*PET:	it's, it's obviously a thing which, if one can possibly avoid it's a good idea to   and erm   I must say it helped but it  you don't know what is helping because you know  we don't know what her symptoms are going to be . •144949_147471•
        Maybe H R T was helping what her symptoms would have been if she hadn't taken them, maybe they were worse because she was, maybe they were the same in spite of it, but I dunno. •147480_149163•
        Er anyhow the, the eventual thing was maybe her blood pressure was going up higher than it should and maybe  whether the cumulative stress of having a husband off in my state, maybe   •149185_150815•
*FRE:	Yeah what  •150946_150985•
*PET:	her, you know maybe  all sorts of things   •151065_151594•
*FRE:	Yeah well this is,this is it I mean there are often a lot of things happening at the same time er er some of which as you just sort of hinted at are sort of er erm  of a psychological er er have a psychological factor in them which all add to it don't they? •151594_153427•
*PET:	Well  my feeling is that  you know if if you're car doesn't run  tinker with the carburettor  and if it still isn't running right, tinker with something else, if you like, the fatal thing is  to tinker with both  because then you just don't know what you've got, and erm she's been on, on  this hormone replacement which is er er  no big deal but, you know, hormones are   •153478_157059•
*FRE:	Well  •157078_157091•
*PET:	big things. •157189_157268•
*FRE:	I, I, I've met ladies who have, have really benefited •157268_157603•
*PET:	Oh yeah •157651_157696•
*FRE:	from it. •157696_157801•
*PET:	oh yeah. •157801_157831•
*FRE:	Yeah. •157831_157841•
*PET:	Erm  her blood pressure was being, being depressed  er by some other, you know, blood pressure regulator and erm  one of the side effects of hormone replacement may be, yeah,that  people's  susceptibility to migraine is heightened. •157863_162238•
        So you, you, you, you've got at least three things which are all sort of brewing up there and you think good grief what a, what a, what a state to be in because the poor doctor doesn't know what on earth to do, poor Jan doesn't know, well it's worse for Jan cos she's sitting there thinking I'm going potty or, you know, can't stand properly or you know is leaning over or, or  numb down one side of her face or, or  or  whatever it was, it was it was the, the dizziness I think actually which  which was most alarming. •162238_166301•
        And so erm   get flu on top of it all erm  •166815_167332•
*FRE:	Quite. •167332_167338•
*PET:	It really is a very difficult, difficult erm •167364_167680•
*FRE:	Yeah there's quite a bit of flu about at the moment isn't there? •167680_168016•
*PET:	Yeah. •168016_168035•
        Well what  I know the answer is  is to say don't worry  be concerned but don't worry because worrying doesn't do you no good, it doesn't do the condition no good and it doesn't do everybody else any good either because they just say oh she's  you know what she is, depressed by whatever it is and that's, as it were, objectively logical but  what seems to me to be the absolutely  overwhelming is to say he's not worried, he's desperately concerned, he's more concerned than humans can possibly be but  if god isn't worried, what on earth are we burning up our resources worrying about because if he's not worried  concerned yes, but he's not worried. •168036_174181•
*FRE:	Who are you talking about now? •174270_174528•
*PET:	God. •174528_174557•
*FRE:	Oh god, yeah. •174557_174659•
        Yeah. •174659_174679•
*PET:	I mean he is desperately concerned, I mean he, he loves us all with a concern which just er er  er er is greater than anything we can understand, so  concern at the  at the slightest  er doubt about, I can't understand how concerned he is but er  I totally relax  •174679_177059•
*FRE:	Yeah  •177165_177185•
*PET:	but if the god of heaven is concerned  that's fine, he's not worrying because he created the whole thing, therefore it seemed to me pretty good  reason to be concerned   •177228_178754•
*FRE:	Concerned but not worried. •178841_178951•
*PET:	but not worried, and I'm certainly not  •178951_179099•
*FRE:	Yeah I, well I'm with you mm •179100_179265•
*PET:	you know, lying awake at nights you know  cos er three and four in the morning  everything's quiet, you know, •179265_180321•
*FRE:	Mm. •180333_180355•
*PET:	the heating's off  •180460_180521•
*FRE:	Yeah. •180521_180537•
*PET:	I think people who are  liable to worry about their condition  have a very very difficult time at three and four in the morning and er  old ladies are particularly vulnerable I think. •180545_183543•
*FRE:	Well I, I had a period of waking up at four •183543_183778•
*PET:	Isn't it   •183778_183950•
*FRE:	and not going off again. •184004_184111•
*PET:	Isn't it •184150_184227•
*FRE:	Mind you •184235_184251•
*PET:	demoralising? •184251_184259•
*FRE:	Yeah but I'd far sooner do that than not get off to sleep at night. •184259_184878•
*PET:	Yeah I think that's  that's right, you know. •184878_185057•
        That's where everyone's different of course but erm I, I think it is, it is  it is  a factor that erm  one can watch television or can listen to the radio or one can go for a walk or do all sorts of things as it were before  noon and midnight but three or four in the morning, you know, when everything is  •185112_188080•
*FRE:	Mm •188080_188095•
*PET:	at a very low level I think it's a very potentially demoralising thing  •188109_188552•
*FRE:	Mm although  •188569_188702•
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah although it didn't, it didn't  I I wasn't too concerned about it, I thought well you know I'm resting er and er I'm the sort of person who only needs about six hours, if I get six hours I'm okay  erm, you know, on a regular basis I'm talking about. •188739_190853•
        So er I mean it didn't really affect me too much. •190862_191351•
*PET:	But it's  a low time isn't it? •191351_191815•
        And it can be •191855_191941•
*FRE:	Mm. •191955_191968•
        Well  •191982_192011•
*PET:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	er well er here again I think er it's the old old story of erm it affects different people different ways. •192040_192794•
        Where some people are  better at night  I'm erm I'm now talking about before going to bed •192794_193902•
*PET:	Mm. •193935_193961•
*FRE:	than first thing in the morning  erm  whereas I, I think probably I am probably better as soon as I get up than last thing at night. •193961_195364•
*PET:	Yes er I, I, I, I think   one's either an owl or a  some other bird which,which doesn't at night but does by, by, by day you know. •195412_197235•
*FRE:	 ((cough)) 
*PET:	Yeah I, I, I think that er  the, the, the M S Society have er er say that we've got eighty thousand members in the United Kingdom, Great Britain, Northern Ireland  only problem is they appear to have eighty thousand different conditions  •197501_200108•
*FRE:	Yeah yeah  •200108_200180•
*PET:	That's absolutely right. •200180_200285•
        Every doctor will say you know  •200286_200466•
*FRE:	Yeah yeah. •200466_200503•
*PET:	people do differ •200503_200593•
*FRE:	Yeah. •200608_200642•
*PET:	and some of them differ so much from others who you put in the same box and you  •200642_201378•
*FRE:	Mm. •201385_201431•
*PET:	think well maybe we've got the box wrong. •201483_201576•
*FRE:	Mm. •201576_201582•
*PET:	I think, I think that's it and er  tt •201587_201778•
*FRE:	You mentioned Christopher , what er the last time  it's, I'm going back a little while, the last time I was talking with Janet  he, she was a bit unhappy, I think he was in er a teaching practice at the time  and she was wondering how he was going to go on. •201871_204399•
*PET:	 ((sigh)) 
*FRE:	That must be the best part of the year ago I should think though now. •204399_205005•
*PET:	Yeah. •205005_205023•
        Well the, the, the, the, the sort of, the sort of background as I have seen it  he never  struck me as being particularly clever or bright  it's just that he always seemed to be very well taught and academically successful and exams never seemed an undue problem, and so  he went off to  Wolverhampton Poly which he selected for, you know, all the usual reasons, reasonable place, reasonable course, a reasonable this a reasonable that,tt  erm to do computer science which of course all the kids want to do now  erm twentieth no it isn't it's a sort of nineteen eighties version of wanting to be an engine driver isn't it? •205023_211941•
        They all want to be  so he went off to be a computer scientist and  either  he was too interested in  er  what he describes as cult television which you think   •212188_213898•
*FRE:	 ((yawn)) 
*PET:	but it's not  television,it's, it's Doctor Who and, and Prisoner and, you know  er very  interesting and very easy for enthusiasts to  direct a lot of their time and energy to  maybe I don't  maybe there was a  increased pressure to work and study  which was erm self motivated rather than being externally imposed, maybe he   maybe there was a  fundamental    lack of enthusiasm in him for  what is described as the hardware of computing, the, the, the, the, the instruments, the machines  maybe there was a less than  comprehensive understanding of what is known as the firmware, that's to say I mean  operating systems that are built into the thing to make it work, you've got to understand  the firmware because otherwise you don't understand what the machine will  think you mean and what that will do and  I would have thought that whereas superficially you can ignore the firmware, it's all in there, it understands  as you, I would have thought, grew into a  er a graduate computer scientist you've got to have some idea about that. •213943_227102•
        Er maybe he was, I think, a little superficial in his enthusiasm for what is referred to as the software, that's to say that's the computer programs that you  •227154_228721•
*FRE:	Yeah. •228733_228765•
*PET:	write, you write and er  feed into the thing which it operates along the rules defined by its firmware which someone else has put into it. •228765_230355•
        Anyhow, whatever it was, maybe  a little, as Jan says, he also had a a bad flu bug at a bad time  anyhow he crashed out of the computer science course  and he announced that he was  only regarding the computer science course as being a stepping stone to being a teacher so the sensible thing to do would be to go on to the teacher training course at Lancashire, an education course, cos that's what he wanted to do. •230358_234218•
        So that cost an awful lot of money because he was on a grant of course and he, he spent er about a year as a trainee teacher and we thought that was great because he was, he was dealing with, with er    •234229_236323•
*FRE:	Wasn't he in juniors yeah yeah •236323_236437•
*PET:	Well I can't remember what the terms are, infants er •236448_236749•
*FRE:	There's infants and juniors isn't there? •236749_237083•
*PET:	Yeah it,it's the very young ones •237083_237214•
*FRE:	Ah infants. •237220_237266•
*PET:	it was the very young ones and er  the vast majority of  infant teachers are girls •237349_238150•
*FRE:	Yeah. •238174_238216•
*PET:	and so he had a  a degree of uniqueness and er in the area that he was  vast numbers of  ethnic minorities  so he was er he was  a white male vegetarian  •238230_240512•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*PET:	and I would have thought it was absolutely great, you know,he really, I would have though  had a stimulating, challenging  lovely environment to, to, to be in, I, I, I, I, I hoped that if he was going , I thought he was going to  go on, it was just going to be very expensive tt paying his fees, his this   •240512_243042•
*FRE:	 ((sigh)) 
*PET:	I was therefore  a little surprised and very disappointed when he failed his teaching practice. •243050_244203•
        Erm  I was, I was a bit erm   about that, you know, I just though what on earth now? •244224_245929•
        He is unemployed and receiving state benefit as employed which  isn't very much  •245929_246952•
*FRE:	Is he at home or is he down there? •246953_247229•
*PET:	He wants, wants to stay with us forever   •247229_247403•
*FRE:	Yeah quite. •247403_247439•
        Quite. •247450_247470•
*PET:	I erm  am obviously feeling guilty cos I'm not feeling guilty but  it makes me  cough a bit to go to the post office every week and get vastly more disability er invalidity benefit than he gets, vastly more. •247510_250371•
        And each month Boots Pensions Limited pay me a very reasonable  pension. •250403_251458•
*FRE:	Mm. •251466_251504•
*PET:	large, not generous but I think good grief poor Christopher's sitting there . •251504_252477•
        I agree the state is picking up his, his  rent  which is er er quite a lot er but even so, you know,he hasn't got very much money and  cannot have a very   enthusiastic view of what the future holds •252478_255239•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •255354_255392•
        It's a very bad time. •255513_255702•
*PET:	It is bad •255702_255831•
*FRE:	Yeah. •255831_255853•
*PET:	So he's, he's now doing er A level psychology and G S C E sociology at  night school  whilst he is keeping his days free to try and get a job  which is not easy anywhere •255853_258282•
*FRE:	Right. •258282_258313•
*PET:	it is  no easier in greater Wolverhampton, and if you have eczema and a congenitally weak back you aren't actually falling over yourself in prospects for  the best  chances. •258321_260258•
        So erm we're both  very concerned, not worried, very concerned about what on earth he is doing and what he is going to do. •260446_262247•
*FRE:	Yeah quite. •262432_262473•
*PET:	You know he's twenty two, twenty three years old, you know, you know  whatever he's doing he's liable to be with him for a few years yet  and what can one see     •262473_263752•
*FRE:	Yeah. •263845_263858•
*PET:	You know? •263869_264000•
*FRE:	Yeah. •264357_264384•
*PET:	There just doesn't seem to be anything  on the, on the  horizon. •264390_264734•
        So after he's, he's sat these two exams  erm •264763_265359•
*FRE:	Is he doing them this year? •265373_265791•
*PET:	Yeah, •265791_265811•
*FRE:	Mm. •265811_265829•
*PET:	he may be eligible to be on a  training course, for what we don't know, but er after you've been unemployed six months you are either required to or you have the opportunity to, or you can  go on a state training course but what they train you for or to do we, we haven't actually got  defined yet. •265829_269113•
        And  possibly  either after that or  simultaneously with that or  to transfer there, he might go up to  live in his father's house up in Yorkshire, Mytholmroyd  er er I dunno but it seems to me that if there is a worse place to be unemployed than Wolverhampton, West Riding has gotta be erm  a  competitor  •269123_273429•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah •273496_273539•
*PET:	and Hebden Bridge and Sowerby Bridge seem to be, you know, on each side of Mytholmroyd, you know, on a railway line from Halifax which goes through to  and Todmorden and places. •273711_275390•
        Beautiful part of the world, you know, maybe that's exactly what you wanna do, you wanna kick out Wolverhampton and go for Mytholmroyd particularly if you've got a house or if your father's got a house there which is  there maybe a lot, a lot , a lot going for it but  you're looking for this long term prospects   •275458_277617•
*FRE:	Yeah quite er it doesn't sound too good. •277627_277934•
*PET:	So er I  I thought to myself well  I dunno, I dunno  all these Newton girls have been off to Sri Lanka or   or, or Zaire or wherever   and you'd  you know, isn't that great? •277934_280205•
        Don't really want to  he's not very keen on the prospect of going  V S O or  whatever. •280205_281199•
        And then I say to myself oh come on, oh don't say when I was your age I wanted  did  nearly or whatever. •281227_282232•
        Say •282254_282257•
