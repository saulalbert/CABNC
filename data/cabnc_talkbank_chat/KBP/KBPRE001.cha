*PS065:	Mm Mm .  1907693_1908053

*PS066:	Mm .  1914473_1915003

*PS066:	Yeah .  1960613_1960783
*PS065:	I would think er the loppers if the erm hedgecutter wo n't tackle it the loppers will .  1960783_1965313
*PS066:	Yes but what I was thinking more .  1965373_1967223
*PS065:	Mm .  1967223_1967373
*PS066:	is the rest of the round there round at the side there I mean a lot of the you know when we start getting rid of all the rubbish down that side .  1967373_1976753
*PS065:	Er I would n't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm that bush there That 's a little bit too heavy for it .  1976763_1981903
*PS066:	Which bush .  1981903_1983093

*PS065:	Oh I see what you mean to cram on the trailer Yes Yes yes .  2008933_2011433
*PS066:	Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to u revert to erm a chainsaw .  2011513_2017703
*PS065:	Er combination of both I should think I well I 'm not too concerned about that anyway I can use the loppers If we were doing it seven days a week fair enough you 'd probably need a chainsaw but anything the loppers or the handsaw .  2017773_2029453
*PS066:	Oh handsaw Oh that 's hard work .  2029453_2030683

*PS066:	Oh are n't they .  2052613_2053343

*PS066:	I do n't know .  2080403_2081413

*PS066:	I would imagine so .  2103743_2104213
*PS065:	Did it say from What did it just say .  2104213_2107513
*PS066:	No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I .  2107513_2109693

*PS065:	Well yes it 's probably the smallest skip .  2112152_2114103
*PS066:	But it 'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite a lot of it .  2114103_2118063
*PS065:	See I do n't see erm them shifting very much for that because by the time you 've got a bloke out paid his wages paid for the the erm skip shifter transporter you know .  2118072_2130503
*PS066:	Well if this is a skip It might just be a trailer .  2130503_2133073
