        I said oh by the way when are you intending to move out? •_•
        And he said the  they were pressing him for completion  that very minute. •_•
        You see nowadays the solicitors are falling over themselves to do the conveyancing. •_•
        Whereas when you and I were buying houses it was  oh it's a long process and it can't be hurried. •_•
        Now they're just desperate. •_•
        And I, he said something about, muttering something about before Christmas. •_•
        I hope he is gone before Christmas. •_•

*JEA:	Mm. •_•

*BRE:	Coloured. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah I think you know he's such a er er he does, he he's very clean but he's not a good housewife. •_•
        So nothing white will come out dazzling. •_•
*BRE:	Right. •_•
        Erm  so Ron, Terry slippers. •_•
        Marks and Sparks. •_•
        Are you gonna get them down here or up in Newmarket ? •_•
*JEA:	Oh  down here. •_•
        I'm gonna get everything I possibly can down here. •_•
*BRE:	Right so erm  M and S we'll put in   •_•
*JEA:	Yes I'd love to think that I can struggle back with the tree. •_•
        But I'm not sure that I could. •_•
*BRE:	With what? •_•
*JEA:	I'm very tempted. •_•
        By the time everything is packed into that bag  that's going to be heavy but on the other hand I'm going to have taxis. •_•
        On Waterloo on Sunday I'll be able to get a taxi very easily   •_•
*BRE:	yeah. •_•
*JEA:	Erm  if they can tie a a handle on to the tree  If they're selling them in Guildford Marks. •_•
        If they're selling those imitation trees, and if they've got that wonderful one that looks like a real tree  if they can say to me yes, we can  rope it up for you in such a way that it's got a handle on it. •_•
        I could carry it back. •_•
*BRE:	Well it has. •_•
        In the box it's got a handle. •_•
        It's one of those plastic  boxes. •_•
*JEA:	Oh well, there. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
        And what I'll do is, I'll not only pack my Christmas presents into that. •_•
        I'll also pack everything that's in that little black  little black bag. •_•
        Everything I've brought with me. •_•
*BRE:	You won't get it all in that. •_•
*JEA:	Well I think that probably Neil's clothes will have to go back in a Marks and Spencers •_•
*BRE:	Right. •_•
*JEA:	one of those bags, don't you think? •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	Well I think  see  cos you're gonna get, alright tomorrow they're all little things. •_•
*JEA:	They're tiny. •_•
*BRE:	Tiny things. •_•
        Erm  see how you pack it. •_•
        See what you get tomorrow. •_•
        I mean  the tree's not desperate to get . •_•
        You can get it  if you've got  •_•
*JEA:	If the worst comes to the worst I can do without that. •_•
        I can er either buy one in Asda or somewhere or forget about it and have a fresh tree. •_•
        But I've had fresh trees since I've been in  in Stowmarket and I've, I've come to hate them. •_•
        They're, you know  you, you get the earth you, Richard  usually goes and gets the earth for me. •_•
        Drops half of it all over the carpet as he's bringing it in. •_•
*BRE:	Yes. •_•
        Too much bloody mess . •_•
*JEA:	And have you ever put a tree  a Christmas tree in a tub and packed earth round it and got the bloody thing to stand up straight? •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
        No. •_•
*JEA:	Not on your nelly! •_•
*BRE:	But that  I mean where do you  nearest M and S? •_•
*JEA:	Norwich is the best. •_•
        Ipswich is the nearest. •_•
        Norwich is the better bet because Ipswich is being redeveloped  and only about  a third of the space at the moment is being used for the, for shopping. •_•
        I don't know whether they'll have managed by Christmas to get it all done. •_•
        They were  expanding. •_•
*BRE:	The thing to do  perhaps  tomorrow morning  to phone Ipswich  Marks to see if they've got them in stock. •_•
*JEA:	Good idea. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	But I think you're gonna have enough to carry back •_•
*JEA:	I think so. •_•
*BRE:	without lugging that big box . •_•
*JEA:	I I don't think I could manage it. •_•
        I can see   fits being had by  party. •_•
*BRE:	presents than worry about the tree at the moment. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Cos you've gotta, I mean   •_•
*JEA:	I love that tree. •_•
        I fell in love with that   •_•
*BRE:	I know you did dear. •_•
        But you can't even leave it down here and pick it up later •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	because it'll be too late. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        I, I want it for Neil and  Paul and even for   •_•
*BRE:	Well why don't you get him to, can't you go with, take Neil into Norwich? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
        I can  •_•
*BRE:	And get him to carry it. •_•
*JEA:	I can get, you see Mark will  Mark will do anything at the moment cos he's quite interested in me. •_•
*BRE:	Well phone, if it comes to it phone Mark at Norwich and ask him to deliver one. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Alright might cost you an extra fiver. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	But it's worth it cos you, you wouldn't get there in petrol  and back would you? •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	Right let's just go through the rest of this. •_•
        Jean to get. •_•

*JEA:	I think that Marks' winter tights will probably be better. •_•
*BRE:	Okay. •_•
        Er  Jackie? •_•
        Smiths or bookshop? •_•
*JEA:	Er yes. •_•

        Talk to  myself very seriously. •_•
        No but there, there aren't any  there didn't seem to be any concerts  erm happening within the vicinity. •_•
        I mean they travel all over the world these people. •_•
        And I, I suspect that they're on their way out because the way they  leap and scream and bang and thump  I should think that they , most of them have been on drugs. •_•
        He has on, or had on his wall  a poster with the itinerary of their, of their tour. •_•
        This, this group that he's so fascinated by. •_•
        And I keep on forgetting the name of the group. •_•
*BRE:	Right Sheila , calendar Smiths. •_•
*JEA:	Oh. •_•
        What's the name of the group that he's so mad on. •_•

*JEA:	I suppose they're making the money. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah aren't they? •_•
        Right Bob and Glynis, tin of biscuits. •_•
        The  tin of biscuits. •_•
        They're all Stowmarket? •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        I couldn't contemplate hauling that lot back. •_•
*BRE:	Simon ask Richard. •_•
        That's Stowmarket isn't it? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Well you've got  all you've got left, you've got my presents to get tomorrow. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	And  that leaves you with just five in Stowmarket. •_•
        Wine and some biscuits. •_•
*JEA:	That's not bad is it? •_•
*BRE:	No •_•
*JEA:	I mean they're going to be very easy to buy. •_•
*BRE:	And you've bought eighteen presents today. •_•
*JEA:	Oh my goodness! •_•
*BRE:	Eighteen people. •_•
*JEA:	I say! •_•
        . That's amazing isn't it? •_•
*BRE:	So you had thirty four people this year to buy for. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	but I mean if you'd bought all the extras, last year you had about fifty. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	So tokens are small,, paperback will be small, calendar will be small. •_•
        So they're not major presents •_•
*JEA:	No they're not. •_•
        No. •_•
*BRE:	tomorrow. •_•
*JEA:	They're not weighty ones. •_•
        Brenda  could you pass me up my, my box of, of er coloured ribbons and things. •_•
        I just want to love and admire it. •_•
        . It's so Christmassy! •_•
        . It's got gift tags hasn't it, as well as pretty. •_•
        Ah. •_•
        Incidentally I was glad that although I didn't feel  one hundred percent I was glad that I wandered round Liberties. •_•
        Because I went up to their fabric department  and  I want to  after Christmas I'm going to wash all the covers on the  er settees, you know er  the dralon. •_•
        And I want to make if I can a couple of  deeper coloured cushions and if I can  I want to make tie-backs for the curtains because everything in that room is so blooming pale. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	Well Liberties sell a fabric that they call  poult, P O U L T  for what was it? •_•
        Two fifty. •_•
        And they had acetate at four fifty. •_•
        And they had the most marvellous colours. •_•
        I think that they only intend them for linings. •_•
*BRE:	Oh that's what I wanna get. •_•
        Some of that tomorrow. •_•
*JEA:	Well I will get some too. •_•
        Put it down on my side as well. •_•
        Because I'm not going to buy any more tree decorations this year. •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
        I'm . •_•
        Either last year or the year before. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Now shall we see what we can get in this bag? •_•
*JEA:	Yes please. •_•
*BRE:	Right. •_•
        Oh it's got a little padlock. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Isn't it lovely! •_•
*BRE:	Has it got a key though? •_•
        No. •_•
*JEA:	No it's just a little neat  pretty thing. •_•
*BRE:	Actually you have got a key. •_•
*JEA:	Oh how nice . •_•
        I thought it was just a decoration. •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
        You've got two keys. •_•
*JEA:	Well I never. •_•
*BRE:	gonna love that. •_•
        Now if anybody pinches it  alright they can  break it, but •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	I'd leave the two big baskets will probably, I think all the smaller things in here. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Do you? •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	stand up. •_•
        That's it isn't it? •_•
*JEA:	What about the erm  the baskets, the toiletries. •_•
        What do you think to do with those? •_•
*BRE:	I think put them  in case in the Marks and Sparks bag. •_•
        Cos they're quite heavyish. •_•
*JEA:	They are aren't they? •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BRE:	Pack them very tight  in one bag. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	These are gonna be the most awkward things. •_•
*JEA:	I wondered if they would go in there. •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
        See. •_•
*JEA:	Mo. •_•
        Just won't. •_•
        Oh they do. •_•
        Well that's very clever Brenda. •_•
*BRE:	No   Do you want the hangers? •_•
        Do you desperately need the hangers? •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	Cos they're gonna be bulky. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        Hangers are a pain. •_•
*BRE:	Even if you  had to after Christmas take it back  they won't know. •_•
*JEA:	They don't worry about the hangers, no. •_•
*BRE:	You just say you don't have the hangers don't you? •_•
*JEA:	That's right. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        The hangers could in fact go, go in there because that looked to be rather a good hanger, frankly. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	No, that one's a nuisance. •_•
        That one's a nuisance. •_•
*BRE:	That one's alright though. •_•
*JEA:	That one's fine. •_•
*BRE:	They're lovely  •_•
*JEA:	They are beautiful. •_•
*BRE:	It's not too heavy then. •_•
        And you've got room in there if you want  •_•
*JEA:	Have a little hold  oh yes I can manage that for short distances. •_•
        I think perhaps that can be thrown out because otherwise it's going to scratch that that nice tin. •_•
*BRE:	I can take the tin of biscuits out if you feel it's too heavy. •_•
        Oh we can try it tomorrow, thinking about it. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        No I can lift that. •_•
        I mean I couldn't walk for any great distance with it but  I'm going to have taxis. •_•
*BRE:	and get them to carry it. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah that's gonna scratch it. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	That'll be easier for you anyway •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	so you've got a bit of padding there you can put  •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BRE:	Pack the biscuits along with your clothes. •_•
        Inside and it won't  •_•
*JEA:	That's right. •_•
        It won't get scratched. •_•
        It's a lovely thing. •_•
*BRE:	You've got two   •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
        I'm wondering whether the things from that  will lie in the top of this. •_•
        Well we'll see when, when we get the things tomorrow. •_•
        They're all going to be small aren't we, aren't they? •_•
        They're going to be •_•
*BRE:	All  •_•
*JEA:	tiny things tomorrow. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	Course you've got your tree as well. •_•
*JEA:	Oh the tree! •_•
        That could go in with the er wrapping paper couldn't it? •_•
*BRE:	They  to keep that separate. •_•
*JEA:	I suppose so. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        It hasn't got it's own tree shaped bag has it? •_•
        A tall thin bag? •_•
*BRE:	No. •_•
        No. •_•
        Cos •_•
*JEA:	They were all big bags that we had? •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
        That's fine then. •_•
        I don't mind looking after it. •_•
        Yes. •_•
        Yes. •_•
*BRE:	So it stays upright then. •_•
        No, none of them are heavy. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
        Ooh. •_•
*BRE:	Well  I spent today in Marks and Sparks or you spent. •_•
        Seventy four pound was mine  and a hundred and eighty five pound was yours. •_•
