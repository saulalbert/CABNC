*ANN:	Hey, you know, talking about the ducks on the river, you know that  elderly, ever so refined lady •141338_141960•
*JAM:	Who brought bread to feed  •142008_142120•
*ANN:	Yes. •142120_142148•
*JAM:	the ducks? •142148_142169•
        Yes. •142169_142186•
        Yes well, that's right. •142324_142473•
*ANN:	I think she must have been  quite well off some time, had fallen on  really hard times. •142473_143053•
        I mean, she told me  oh, a couple of years ago that she was eighty. •143158_143592•
        And, I better get this dinner out. •143785_143930•
        And erm  she always thought of her husband as daddy. •143977_144473•
*JAM:	Mhm. •144494_144509•
*ANN:	And her daughter  I think she must have been getting on because  around the time she told me that she was eighty, she happened to mention that her daughter was forty. •144690_145790•
*JAM:	She had no grandchildren   •145790_145971•
*ANN:	I know, her daughter, er her daughter's not married. •145975_146165•
        Well I haven't seen her feeding the ducks  for about three or four months. •146216_146989•
        I wonder if she's died or she's ill? •146989_147157•
*JAM:	She's always going to jumble sales. •147309_147419•
*ANN:	I know. •147419_147467•
        All, all her clothes came from jumble sales. •147467_147729•
        Everything. •147746_147805•
        She she was buying, long after nylon shirts went out of fashion, there there was a pile of nylon shirts, and she said I'm, I'm just looking to see if this  if these will be suitable for daddy. •147941_149048•
        I can't remember  er, she gave me the reason why she wanted these for  oh, he, he, he always wears his cuffs out or something. •149142_150417•
        She was quite pleasant to talk to, I liked listening to her. •150436_150962•
        I don't think I know her name. •150976_151130•
        So, I couldn't even ask anyone. •151257_151405•
