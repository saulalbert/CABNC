*SUS:	Well   (.) yeah we, we usually go erm
*UNK:	These are two fifty each to go in.
*SUS:	Yeah, it's a lot innit?
*PAT:	It's a hell of a lot   (        ) 
*SUS:	It is for little ones, you know when you think
*PAT:	Hour and a half you get for that.
*SUS:	Mm.
*PAT:	See when we go normally there's no time limit, but   (        ) busy week you have a   (.) we had the orange armbands, you, you trade your key in for an or orange armband   (        )

*PAT:	And then you've got this disk on the wall which change colours, (        ) you know 
*CAR:	Yeah.
*SUS:	Yeah.
*PAT:	And when your wedge comes up, and that comes up flashing orange the bloke hits an old  (        ) 
*CAR:	Yeah well what happens if you just get in at the end of your   (.) or a at the time before they change the band, the colours? (.) 
*PAT:	Well   (        ) but I mean we, we   (        ) 
*CAR:	No cos I've seen this done before right, I mean it's over a certain time, but if you go in at the end of the time
*PAT:	Yeah.
*CAR:	and you, you, you
*UNK:	No for a while it's flashing   (.) the orange.
*CAR:	Yeah but you don't, you never, if you get 
*PAT:	I know what Carl mean if you, you get   (        ) five minutes before it's up
*CAR:	you never get the same amount of time as anybody else.I've always thought that's a, that's a totally unfair system.It's best with the, what, the best way I've seen it is with a numbers disk. (.) Say from one till ten cos they're the early ones   (.) and then they get a certain time, then your numbers eleven to twenty 
*UNK:	Yeah but what I'm saying is erm   (.) the orange disk was flashing for a long while before the buzzer   (        ) 
*CAR:	Yeah but it's flashing just as long for those who bought it first time round, isn't it?
*UNK:	Yeah.
*PAT:	Mm.
*CAR:	You still get extra, you still, you don't
*UNK:	Anyway it's plenty of time

*CAR:	No I was gonna say normally if you don't, if there's no time restriction
*PAT:	They, they, they actually tell you   (.) in the queue.She'll say right    (.)  (        ) going in she'll say right   (.) the next lot will be going in in er ten minutes to one which may be a quarter of an hour's time like, you know, so it's all timed   (        ) they don't let a few   (.) there's a   (        ) the second go in.
*CAR:	Yeah, mhm.
*UNK:	Oh I see.
