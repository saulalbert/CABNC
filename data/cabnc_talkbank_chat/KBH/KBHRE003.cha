*PS05F:	Yeah he 's out all this week Well my dad wo n't pass them on to Terry Me dad said he 's had enough Well we were debating whether to give it to you or not But I thought well if Terry notices he might Well in fact two really big estimates .  1819853_1847123
*PS05D:	Who Terry .  1851323_1851603
*PS05F:	Yeah And one wanted re-estimating the other one wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done We give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail So she had a list of about five things she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest But she 's got about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes So I worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to Terry to sort those out And they 're both about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work .  1851793_1890013
*PS05D:	Well you ca n't afford to lose them can you .  1890013_1892463

*PS05D:	So what 's going to happen then .  1892683_1894973
*PS05F:	God knows He said I asked asked well I left a message on Saturday for him to sort them out did n't I He already knew about that And then I asked my father on Tuesday to remind him and he said he 'd already said he 'd fetch them in on Tuesday And he my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning But he 's he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices So I do n't know Well I mean he 'd done he 's done this first estimate these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in you know they 're well keen on our prices .  1894973_1941883
*KBHPSUN:	they ca n't pursue it till we come back to them .  1941883_1944593
*PS05F:	They 're not pursuing it until we put these things out My father just turned round I 've had enough of it if Terry 's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to Brian I said yeah then I get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to Terry and then there 's an argument If he if he says anything to me I 'll just have to tell him But he 's not doing the estimates he 's been given and he ca n't afford to throw money away It 's cos he 's working for him at the moment money He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he has n't worked for him He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way I mean Brian 's pulled in a lot of work lot of people kind of saying come back again on Thursday So he 's he 's If we got Terry to do that we 'd be well away They they would love him I mean one of them it was annoying really cos Terry 's just not pulling his weight .  1944593_2005623
*KBHPSUN:	I do n't understand it if I live to be a hundred I wo n't understand it .  2005623_2019423
*PS05F:	And also it 's cos that you know after we had that row about Terry after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop and er he 's already owing Brian a day Guess who 's doing the extra day got my dad to cover a day And then he takes a day off Bank Holidays and he ca n't do it because my dad But then tomorrow he 's actually doing his own work So he could easily have And on Monday .  2019423_2057313
*PS05D:	So who 's covering tomorrow .  2057313_2058893
*PS05F:	Well my brother 's covered practically all week and Brian 's doing tomorrow Terry phoned up asking what Tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering And he said well my father is doing today I ca n't do today I 'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you should n't be going in I mean he has n't been in the shop once this week Somebody 's got to tell him to .  2058893_2083873
*PS05D:	So do Dave and Terry in the shop .  2083873_2102553

*KBHPSUN:	I 'm not doing it .  2144483_2145173
*PS05D:	What 's the point of carrying on like that .  2145173_2149893
*PS05F:	Well he 's going to carry on like that is n't he Not unless someone puts their foot down .  2149893_2154173
*PS05D:	And if your father is currently taking your side of things worth sounding him out as to how far he 'll take .  2154173_2159573
