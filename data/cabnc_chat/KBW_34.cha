*MAR:	Oh.
*DOR:	And wait in the car park down there.
*MAR:	Oh.Round that   (        ) 
*DOR:	Cos that'll save me five minutes.

*DOR:	It's the in thing though isn't it?Off the shoulders and
*MAR:	Yes yes and   (        ) you see.And and the underskirt and everything's all in with the dress isn't it? (.) Well anyway   (.) she's a nice   (.) I like her very much.He's chosen  (        ) 
*DOR:	A nice girl   (        ) 
*MAR:	But he's, he's got this he's got this   (        ) now.

*MAR:	Yes. (        ) really, and erm   (.) I I've brought the service and things for you.Erm Mr , you know Douglas   (.) did the prayers.
*DOR:	Oh yeah.
*MAR:	But erm   (.) the church you see was burnt down where he's gone to but it's nearly finished, altering it.And and in a sense it's been a blessing in disguise.
*DOR:	Yeah.
*MAR:	Because you go in and they've got this new entrance hall.
*DOR:	Yeah.
*MAR:	And   (        ) made a gallery round   (        ) for the Sunday school.And then you go into 
*DOR:	They had a fire at Saint Leonards and they've been saying that really it's been a good thing.Cos they've had to rethink what they want.
*MAR:	What's   (.) where yes.And they've 
*DOR:	Cos otherwise you're tied by you know 
*MAR:	Yes that's it.So 
*DOR:	preservation orders or this that and the other.
*MAR:	Yes, yeah but when it gets burnt down you, I mean they can't   (        ) 
*DOR:	 [laughing] There's no preservation   (        )  [] .
*MAR:	So and er we got there fairly early, cos the taxi well the taxi man got lost, that's another story.The taxi man got lost in Manchester.Anyway we got, we got there in time
*DOR:	Oh no wonder he wanted you to set off early.
*MAR:	Eh?
*DOR:	No wonder he wanted you to set off early, he didn't know where he was going.
*MAR:	 (        ) anyway we had a nice trip up past   (        ) and back through Prestwich and all round.Till we found out that and he said oh I know where I am now.Just tu 
*DOR:	He didn't charge you for all that?
*MAR:	No, he took some off.Fortunately.
*DOR:	Oh that was nice.
*MAR:	He said ooh he said it was my fault.So he took   (        ) anyway   (.) er    (.)  (        ) I'm getting mixed up with me stories I think. (.) And at this church   (.) we got there early and the   (        ) soon as we walked in there the, the church warden says   (.) toilets are there.Thanks very much we said.
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) You must have looked the type.
*MAR:	So we we  (        ) .You know we said where we'd come from, that sort of.So they let us look all round, they said  (        ) .So we did you see.Because er   (.) it's marvellous what they've been able to do.It's not quite finished.
*DOR:	I expect it was packed was it?
*MAR:	It was full  (        ) .And er the thing was, we found out afterwards why they'd done it.The organ pipes are in the middle of the chancel and you couldn't see the east window at the  (        ) .
*DOR:	No.
*MAR:	Oh well they said that's because they'd not got that section finished
*DOR:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	and  (        ) .But the old gargoyles off the church were saved and they've stuck them up all over the   (.) on the erm dividing piece between the church and this new   (.) er   (.) section.They've got a lovely new kitchen  (        ) .Very nice.
*DOR:	I bet  (        ) 
*MAR:	Oh yes they said.But we've had a very very   (.) well we've still got him   (.) a good   (.) treasurer.Who knew what to do and instead of 
*DOR:	Yeah.
*MAR:	instead of saying, telling the er insurance people that they'd give them the bills and they could pay them as they came in, he said they'd got a lump sum. (.) And he's been able to invest it
*DOR:	Mm.
*MAR:	himself.
*DOR:	Mm.Mm.
*MAR:	And he wanted, he was a man that knew what he was doing.
*DOR:	Knew where to get extra 
*MAR:	Get extra money.
*DOR:	interest.
*MAR:	And he said er   (.) he's paid, he's paid for everything.Just a little bit more money they wanted then he shoots off home.
*DOR:	I'm sure, you know, with Alan and this new building, he's been very good.
*MAR:	Yeah.
*DOR:	Because he's known the right people.
*MAR:	Yes.
*DOR:	And when things have turned up and they've not been quite right he's known  (.) 
*MAR:	Yes.
*DOR:	There's something sort of practical about him.You know the  (.) 
*MAR:	Yeah that's what he, they said he's been marvellous, this treasurer.They said we wouldn't have got
*DOR:	No.
*MAR:	but they've gotta let him.You see.
*DOR:	Mm.
*MAR:	But he, he said to the insurance people no I don't want you just to keep on paying the bills.
*DOR:	Yeah.
*MAR:	He said we'll have a lump sum.And he got the lump sum and they was investing it and just drawing out when he   (.) needed it.
*DOR:	That's it. (.) 
*MAR:	Course it was very nice and we got a proper dinner   (.) at this erm   (.) mind you we were absolutely famished by the time we got there. [laughing] Didn't get me dinner till gone three  [] .
*DOR:	Yeah.Thought you'd be late.What time was the wedding?
*MAR:	Mm?
*DOR:	What time was the wedding?Half eleven?
*MAR:	Twelve.
*DOR:	Oh twelve. (.) Did you have elevenses before you set off?
*MAR:	Mm?
*DOR:	Did you have elevenses before you set off?
*MAR:	 (        ) set off at  (        ) .I had   (        ) but erm   (.) we set off from Irene's at half past ten you see.
*DOR:	Oh  (        ) .
*MAR:	It took him three quarters of an hour to get us there.So anyway we'd had a good look round and this ch church warden said hey   (.) you'd better go and get some seats cos it's going to get  (        ) .Now you've come early he said, have a sit there he said and you'll see everything.
*DOR:	Yeah. (        ) 
*MAR:	Cos they only booked seats for the immediate family.So we sat on this row and it was   (.) Paul and his young lady and David   (.) all in the row with us.And er
*DOR:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Yeah.It was very nice.All there they were.I've had a right good chat to David. (.) So he, they came to erm   (.) Saint, Saint Kevins on Sunday morning.And I reckon   (        ) Sunday I'd have got a lift home.
*DOR:	Oh right.
*MAR:	 (        ) had a real good chat with them all Sunday night.
*DOR:	Yeah.Just pleased you'd got that extra space.You're not worrying about rushing off.
*MAR:	Well I would have been rushing off.Anyway it wouldn't have been fair to Irene really   (        ) cos we went   (        ) Sunday afternoon. (        )
