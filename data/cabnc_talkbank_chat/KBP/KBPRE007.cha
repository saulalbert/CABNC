*PS066:	Yeah true .  416343_417563

*PS066:	Yeah .  423583_423853
*PS065:	Erm So I can use that as an experimental piece . 
*PS066:	Where .  429823_429973
*PS065:	there 's stuff come to think of it it 's the one in the hall The doorway that 's bricked up Yeah .  430893_435673
*PS066:	Oh of course I keep forgetting there was a doorway there when we arrived .  435673_438533

*PS066:	Yeah .  441043_441133
*PS065:	Erm it 's exactly the same varnish stain as this .  441133_444123
*PS066:	Is it .  444123_444783
*PS065:	So I can muck about on that piece before I tackle it in here so mm stripping goes .  444843_450853
*PS066:	Oh I see what you mean To to er see .  450853_453663
*PS065:	Without staining without what .  453663_454843
*PS066:	Mm that 's true To see if w what colour we can get that we like instead of this .  455173_459723
*PS065:	Yeah Yeah That 's right .  459803_460413
*PS066:	Mm .  460743_460843
*PS065:	First of all what 's the best stripping medium Whether it 's gon na be gentle heat whether it 's gon na be varnish stripper Paint stripper What the hell And then see the go on .  460843_469463
*PS066:	Er w do you have to strip it .  469463_470363
*PS065:	If we want to change the colour Unless we 're going to use a varnish stain as such But it 's very and it looks a bit crummy that stuff I always think .  472913_479293
*PS066:	Ooh Ooh well I do n't know .  479343_483853
*PS065:	Mm See look at .  483853_488033

*PS065:	Pardon .  488423_488603
*PS066:	It 's a big area to strip Why would n't it .  488793_491253
*PS065:	Well it 's only what erm the architrave the arch there this side that side and that one there .  491253_495883
*PS066:	Well I mean if you had it sort of darker would n't it stain darker slightly .  495883_498233
*PS065:	Well as I say you ca n't stain varnished wood Nina .  498233_500983
*PS066:	Oh .  500983_501213
*PS065:	You can put a varnish stain on Varnish stain but erm In in this particular light now I can see where they 've put on thick blodges that run down .  501213_521433
*PS066:	I know it 's terrible is n't it .  521433_523353
*PS065:	Mm .  523683_523823
*PS066:	I would n't think that was a professional job .  523823_527123
*PS065:	Oh what was I do n't think .  530213_531383
*PS066:	But well originally what would they have done with it When it was built .  531383_535753
*PS065:	Oh no I do n't think I do n't think it 's from square one It probably would be varnished from square one but that 's not the original varnish .  535753_542273
*PS066:	No .  542433_542593
*PS065:	Should n't think no .  543513_545123
