# CABNC transcription project

## Outline
A detailed conversation analytic transcription of naturalistic conversations from a subcorpus of the [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) amounting to around 4.2 million words.

## Accessing and using CABNC data

The names of folders and files in the CABNC project correspond to the names of original tapes and audio file names from the [Audio BNC](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC).

## Using / contributing transcripts

Transcriptions are made using [Jeffersonian CA transcription conventions](http://homepages.lboro.ac.uk/~ssca1/notation.htm), and the CHAT CA file formats and transcription symbols provided by the [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/) transcription system.

To use or contribute to these transcripts:

1. download and install [CLAN](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/),
2. download the correspondingly titled audio file from the [Audio BNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access),
3. transcribe and push new files or refine existing transcripts using CLAN.

## BNC Data and Usage

### Accessing BNC data

The data on which this project builds is available here:

* Full [BNC transcripts are available in HTML format](http://bnc.phon.ox.ac.uk/transcripts-html/) via the AudioBNC 
* Audio data and Praat TextGrid are available on the Oxford Phonetics Institute [AudioBNC site](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/AudioBNC#Access).

If you want to perform complex searches on BNC data:

* Lancaster University's [BNCweb tool](http://bncweb.lancs.ac.uk/): provides a useful web interface for searching the BNC and checking the audio location of sections of transcript.

### Subcorpus Data Selection Rationale

[The Audio BNC](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) contains about 7.5 million words of recorded speech, all of
it already roughly transcribed, with audio recordings of sufficient quality for
automated phonetic transcriptions, and full Praat TextGrid files aligning audio
to transcriptions are available for the entire corpus. There are also
comprehensive wordclass and part-of-speech tag annotations. Within the overall
BNC corpus, this project focuses on a subcorpus of more naturalistic,
conversations from informal contexts. These include 152 rough transcripts of
audio files, labelled by the original BNC transcribers with the following tags:

* Overall category: Demographically sampled (subjects carrying audio recorders around)
* Interaction type: Dialogue (rather than speeches/monologues)
* Genre type: conv. (conversation).

These are conversations around water-coolers, in corridors, bus-stops, homes
etc. and as such are most useful for analysing natural talk-in-interaction.
There are 4,228,314 words in this subcorpus.
