*STU:	Really   (        ) at all er   (.) apart from the   (.) mor  (.) moral support.
*ANN:	Moral support   (.) well you need that other stuff first 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) side.
*STU:	Hold me up while I sign, you know.
*ANN:	No well I'll go with you, if you want.
*STU:	It isn't very long   (.) Shouldn't be in there long   (.) just a matter of signing all the things, checking all the   (.) details over, putting in what he hasn't filled in already.
*ANN:	And I'm hoping that they get that letter, you seeing them   (.) weekend  (        ) .
*STU:	Yes.
*ANN:	And you're not working Saturday morning, instead of going to work   (.) late we can go a bit early and   (.) do a bit of shopping ourselves.
*STU:	Go to town next Thursday 
*ANN:	Before Monday.
*STU:	Thursday morning can't you?
*ANN:	Don't know if I could do the electric one   (.) definitely   (.) Guess that's about whether the    (        )  (.) I'd like one of them, one of them and   (.) yeah but we don't know when it can be delivered, so we can't do it that early   (.) you can't say yeah but   (.) but er we'll let you know, well we can   (.) so   (        ) it's there   (.) that's what we wish, they'd   (        ) the bills go and we'll let you know when you can be   (.) the keys can be available for you to put it in.
*STU:	And so the   (.) Can't   (        ) first  (        ) .
*ANN:	Mm, I know.
*STU:	That's the first job   (.) first one in    (        )  (.) then you   (.) get the carpet sorted out.
*ANN:	Yeah cos it's much easier than dragging all   (        ) 
*STU:	At least at least you know how   (.) you know   (.) if he says you can have this one or this one   (.) yeah cos the choice between one or the other   (.) and he says well I can fit this one immediately, but, this one I've gotta order.
*ANN:	They've gotta send for.
*STU:	I mean it might   (.) might just sway as to one way or the other if there's a bit of a   (.) well we like them both, but which one, you know?
*ANN:	I don't wanna get carpets without you with me   (.) cos you have to live with them as well.
*STU:	I can have a look at them, now   (.) in the catalogue.
*ANN:	Yeah but they won't be exactly the same in shops.
*STU:	No, true.
*ANN:	Similar but not the same.
*STU:	No not the same, that's true.Mind you I suppose out of a catalogue it's   (.) at least you can feel them and see them   (.) all that.
*ANN:	Oh and I'd rather
*STU:	Only on    (.)  (        ) see the whole roll.
*ANN:	I'd rather go in the shop and see it   (.) cos sometimes, especially if it's got a pattern on   (.) turn out to be better than the catalogue   (.) cos when it comes, it don't look the same, and then the same colour do you?Cos a   (.) reproduction's never   (.) perfect is it?
*STU:	No.
*ANN:	In a photograph it's never   (.) true   (.) then you go in a shop and what you see is what you get.
*STU:	Definitely   (.) There's only a, there's only really   (.) what two carpets   (        ) and these are    (.)  (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) carpet   (        ) 
*STU:	two main bit.
*ANN:	 (        ) for a bathroom, I mean   (.) neither were very good.
*STU:	Yeah but then again   (.) yeah but as I say i i if you   (.) if you want the same in the bathroom and the bedroom 
*ANN:	Well I don't 
*STU:	and the same in the hall in the living room
*ANN:	So two colours.
*STU:	you only got two carpets to sort out   (.) and a bit of lino   (.) rather than having a different one with this one and a   (.) different one for that one and then   (.) a different one for
*ANN:	Yeah, I'll go and put that   (        ) together those
*STU:	Alright.
*ANN:	 (        )
