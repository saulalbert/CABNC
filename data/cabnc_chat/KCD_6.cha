*UNK:	Right I think that Salisbury's is probably the best place for a back pack do you.
*CLA:	Shall we go there first?
*HEL:	Yes.Do you want a new washing bag and a salon to take with you or are you not bothered?
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Mm?
*CLA:	I've got plenty.
*AMY:	You can't take mine.
*HEL:	 ((laugh)) You can't have Amy's.You've only got the one.What?
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Oh nothing.I just thought you'd like a new one.Oh right.In that case.
*CLA:	All we've got to have is
*HEL:	Well I certainly wouldn't bother taking any shampoo if you can't have a hair drier.
*CLA:	Well Charlie'll have to so we can all wash our hair.
*HEL:	Well Charlie's not going.Why is hers very long
*CLA:	Yes  (        ) 
*HEL:	She can sit on it can she?
*CLA:	Yeah easily.It comes down to about here.
*HEL:	Hmm. (.) How often does Amy wash hers then?
*CLA:	What
*HEL:	How often does Amy wash
*CLA:	Every day.
*HEL:	Every day?Oh gosh.
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Oh careful.It's getting worse this road.Look at all this lot.
