*HEL:	 (        ) 
*NON:	Where's this off -here? •129028_129429•
*HEL:	Hm. •129429_129450•
        . Yes . •129554_129596•
*NON:	. •_•
*HEL:	Yes, but I can't make the. •130041_130646•
        You can't just pull that across, might look a long way out . •130696_131115•
        It's wrong, as from there, that's where it starts to go wrong. •132361_134802•
        Here. •134989_135060•
*NON:	Hm  . •135125_135156•
*HEL:	It's not easy is it? •135156_135730•
        . I suppose what we should of done is, done the next one along the drop down there and then matched it all up backwards isn't it? •135912_137389•
        Hm. •137389_137407•
*NON:	No, we do the next one. •137407_137735•
*HEL:	I don't think it'll be a bad idea, I don't think I can match this one off, do you? •137759_138342•
        Well it's never going to go straight and it's going to put the whole lot out isn't it? •138342_•
