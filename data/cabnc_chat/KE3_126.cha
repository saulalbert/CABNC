@Comment:	conversation #126 (Tape 011115)
*TON:	I heard Brad having a conversation again today about  Ooh I don't feel I heard him saying why don't we feel very happy about this and not  and not happy with the subjects and I  don't feel very happy about running the session  so  go up this way  he's never done the work you see  so he's trying to learn it from instructions and things  and  a lot of the time you need to have actually done it to be able to talk about it  •830352_872222•
*MUM:	Yeah  from experience. •872732_873572•
*TON:	So it's not his  his fault but  a lot of the training that we have to deliver is to do with  procedures that he hadn't dealt with  whereas  a lot of the procedures  are things that I'm familiar with  there's only some  the job centre stuff  •873922_896182•
*MUM:	It takes an awful lot of different kind of practical experience. •896182_899252•
*TON:	Yeah. •899892_900172•
*MUM:	Text books don't teach you everything. •902312_903922•

*TON:	Oh  good. •922882_923532•
*MUM:	Yeah  so it must have been alright cos there was no letter it just said with the compliments and just take it to  •923532_929572•
*TON:	Right  right. •929572_931022•
*MUM:	two things back so •931022_932212•
