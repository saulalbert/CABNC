*PS0W3:	A bit resigned to it now .  103213_103893
*PS0W4:	a bit more resigned there 's another there 's another sort of erm possibility I mean if they sold their house quickly of course then you know they 'd come down here obviously and they 'd try and look for something but it 's not likely that they 'd sell their house that quickly .  104343_122793
*PS0W3:	No .  124053_124173
*PS0W4:	but if they did and .  124173_125563

*PS0W4:	you know they 'd all come down but if they do n't erm .  126163_130113
*PS0W3:	Christopher would travel .  130113_130693
*PS0W4:	possibility is that Marilyn would stay up there for another year with Carris you know in their house and Timothy of course and erm then sort of move down here .  130693_143073
*PS0W3:	What after Carris has done her er gcses .  143473_145283
*PS0W4:	I imagine so is she due to do them next year .  146183_148003

*PS0W2:	Yes that 'd be me .  162363_163673
*PS0W4:	but if they ca n't well .  163673_164903

*PS0W3:	Oh yeah I mean that 's that 's the .  172743_174203
*PS0W4:	and erm Marilyn will come down of course when she 's at she 's worried as well about whether she 's going to get a job cos er I mean they need to have erm a second income I should think .  174203_187533
*PS0W3:	Well yeah but I do n't think the job 's erm I mean that 's not the problem for her because she can always go on the agency you see and she can do general midwifery .  188553_197903

*PS0W4:	No well that 's probably erm .  213443_214303
*PS0W3:	no I do n't think that 's a problem .  214303_215233
*PS0W4:	no that 's not a great consideration .  215233_216283
*PS0W3:	I I do n't see that as a .  216283_217053
*PS0W4:	Well I think it 's just .  217053_217953

*PS0W4:	This present mayor was away on holiday at the time he said perhaps that I should of seen that erm it would go to committee .  758223_764733
*PS0W3:	I mean I have gone to the trouble I have been in to see the planning officer that 's dealing with it erm I 've written to every single member of the planning committee I 've written to the Environmental Health who have written back to me saying they offer no objections and there because the smell wo n't be a problem so I 've written them back another stinking letter and saying well erm .  764783_784273
*PS0W2:	Come and live next door .  784273_785123
*PS0W3:	I I completely disagree with your thoughts on the fact that there wo n't be a smell so much so that the slightest smell if the if the er proposal gets the go ahead and I shall be on to your office and asking to speak to you personally to come and smell this erm .  785123_801303
*PS0W4:	And the rubbish I mean the the environmental people .  801303_803823
*PS0W3:	Oh they they say it 's all controllable so that I 've I 've answered I have n't just let the Environmental Health wash over me I 've actually written back to them again er I 'll be interested to see whether I get a letter back from them but I phoned up the Council this morning and they 're rejecting on two grounds one is to do with the highway and the sort of the traffic situation coming in there although the the authority the Highway Department are n't objecting to it and the other one is erm on local environmental issues I think you know that is is unsuitably unsuitable environmentally to the area well I can only say that I 'm grateful to the planning to the planning offices for they 're going out on a limb if you like because I think they 're on thin ice erm and so long as the committee will will back them up I mean I do n't know of what else I could of done as a person .  803823_853753
*PS0W2:	No nothing I do n't think you could of done any more you got it to committee and and there 's nothing more than you can do than that .  853993_858963
*PS0W3:	erm so that if if they then go to an appeal er I was talking to this planning officer and I was saying that I think I 'll consult them he said I do n't think you 'll need to he said and of what you 've done so far is pretty good and I can get access to all the letters that have been written in in objecting into the into the homes .  859873_877793
*PS0W4:	Have a lot of other people written in and objecting .  877793_879133
*PS0W3:	I think there 's I think there 's quite a few and I think this is what swayed it the fact that they have had erm I know of at least ten say ten there 's one two three on the other side of the road which is good because Bob which is another one so that 's four there 's which is the other side of the shop is five there 's us six Jean seven the eight erm the guy the other side of the which is nine there is Ginny over the and the erm old persons' home that 's ten that I know of for certain about er and then I 've heard of other people were gon na be writing in now whether they actually did or not I do n't know .  879133_924263
*PS0W4:	Mm as you see you you really do need .  925323_927273

*PS0W2:	We would of done the same sort of thing and could of gone in to see the planning officer but I just I just assumed you know that that life was fair but of course there 's no justice in this life .  935773_942493
*PS0W3:	But er the only the only yes no the only other thing I would of said that you could of perhaps done would be go to to a Local Authority ombudsman .  942493_949503
