*DAV:	Assume I'm not here. 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Right. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Yep. Right. Presumably kicking the opponent's ball, it's, it's  not acceptable. 
*DAV:	  (  )  , it's not a fault, the only time it's a fault is when you're erm, I don't know the words really, when you're actually in play, so if you were to take a, if you were actually doing this 
*CHR:	Is that right? Yes. 
*DAV:	then, that's a fault. 
*CHR:	Oh, yes  . 
*DAV:	 It's  actually taken. 
*CHR:	I understand, yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	Yes. 
*DAV:	 (  ) , I'm still in play as it were, and I do that then it's  (  ) . 
*CHR:	Right, right, I see. 
*DAV:	But it's not a fault if you, erm, sort of walk up to that ball and erm, do this, it's not a fault. 
*CHR:	No, I see. 
*DAV:	O K? 
*CHR:	Yes, good, O K.
