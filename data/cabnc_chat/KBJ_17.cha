@Comment:	conversation #17 (Tape 052017)
*EMM:	Four add four and then 
*CHR:	Four add four equals eight.Two times four equals eight, right?
*EMM:	Yeah, like that.And then two 
*CHR:	And   (.) two times four is eight.
*EMM:	Erm I didn't write it like that then.
*CHR:	Right.Share the total of fives
*EMM:	Yeah, I done, yeah I done 
*CHR:	Er 
*EMM:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Five, five, five is fifteen.
*EMM:	Five add five add five
*CHR:	Erm is fifteen.
*EMM:	and then erm  (        ) .
*CHR:	Right.Is fifteen.
*EMM:	And then 
*CHR:	And sixes 
*EMM:	Sixes   (.) six 
*CHR:	si 
*EMM:	add six add six 
*CHR:	add six 
*EMM:	add six
*CHR:	is thirty six.Right.Six times six is thirty 
*EMM:	I've done that one.
*CHR:	sixes.That's it.Okay?
*EMM:	Erm   (.) this.I'll leave that out.
*CHR:	Leave that out.Add them up.
*EMM:	Mm.
*CHR:	 (        )  (.) That much closer    (.)  (        ) can use those pictures.
*CAR:	Take a look.
*CHR:	Are they near the box?
*EMM:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*EMM:	Is that right?Four 
*CHR:	Four is twenty!So it's four   (.) so
*EMM:	Four times five is
*CHR:	Twenty!Four times five equal twenty.Er   (.) two times   (.) six equals twelve. (.) Er   (.) four times three equal twelve. (.) Er, two additions left.Alright.
*EMM:	Those two add?So it's like one, two, one, two and one there and   (.) but put like   (.) erm   (.) seven add seven   (.) add seven is  (        ) .
*CHR:	Is twenty one.Yeah.Seven add seven add seven is twenty one 
*EMM:	One.
*CHR:	 (        )  (.) And three times seven
*EMM:	Right.
*CHR:	is twenty one   (.) and do it that way, five and fives.Okay?Two addition questions.
*EMM:	Hang on.
*CHR:	Two ad yeah but you've got right two multiple   (.) and two addition equations.
*EMM:	Not equations!You told us this!
*CHR:	But i thi , like these, these are equations.So   (.) two addition equations   (.) er   (.) three times se  (.) seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one.Right?Oh!A so, but you can also go
*EMM:	Yeah.Yeah add three.
*CHR:	Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one.Do it that way on.Do you follow 
*EMM:	Yeah.
*CHR:	me?
*EMM:	Yes I do.Right.Two multiplication
*CHR:	Yeah.
*EMM:	and two addition.
*CHR:	Two addition.Right.
*EMM:	So you, like, you  (        ) .
*CHR:	Yes, that's right.
*EMM:	Then, it's like erm 
*CHR:	One.
*EMM:	seven times three, and three times seven.
*CHR:	And three times seven.That's right.
*EMM:	And you do the same there.
*CHR:	Same on the adds.
*EMM:	And then, this   (.) we do   (.) like
*CHR:	Right, she wants currency in two divisions   (.) in each, right?So it's   (.) one, two, three, four,fi 
*EMM:	That multiplication is a 
*CHR:	yeah well divisions, okay, so it's twenty one shared by   (.) say, if that's one, two, three, four, five, six int it?
*EMM:	Oh I know what I've got!
*CHR:	Six times three is eighteen   (.) or three times six is eighteen.
*EMM:	I know what I've done.I've put the, I thought it was   (.) er   (.) okay.Six.
*CHR:	And division is shared by.So you got to do eighteen shared by   (.) six is three   (.) and eighteen
*EMM:	Have you got
*CHR:	shared by three is six.
*EMM:	So like, you go one, two, three, four, five, six   (.) six times   (.) you swap 
*CHR:	Three.
*EMM:	six times three 
*CHR:	times three is eighteen 
*EMM:	is three times six.
*CHR:	Six.Yeah, and and you got 
*EMM:	Six times three and three times six.
*CHR:	A and division is   (.) eighteen shared by   (.) three   (.) is six, and eighteen shared by six is three!Yeah? (.) Got it?
*EMM:	I cannot read   (.)  (        ) .
*CHR:	Three sixes are eighteen! (.) You got it?
*EMM:	And you do the same there?Hang on!I haven't finished   (.) thirty three 
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*EMM:	one yet.That's what I don't get.Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I don't a get how you do that? (.) Is it, would you like us to put
*CHR:	It's fours int it?It's fours 
*EMM:	No two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve
*CHR:	Yeah.It 
*EMM:	That's twos.
*CHR:	No, but it's going to fours look.It's going to   (.) fours.
*EMM:	Alright.
*CHR:	Going into fours.
*EMM:	What would I put?
*CHR:	Er   (.) one four is four, two fours are eight, and thre three fours is twelve.As   (.) this is been shared by   (.) lines int it?
*EMM:	Yeah and it's on that one.You do it like that do you?
*CHR:	Yeah, cos it's being shared by
*EMM:	Oh!
*CHR:	So it's, I would say that is   (.) er   (.) nine times four equals thirty six.And on that one is   (.) er, sixty three shared by nine   (.) six time   (.) sixty three divided by nine
*EMM:	 (        ) four.
*CHR:	No!Sixty three divided by   (.) nine is six!Write six through it.Ten six   (        ) innit?
*EMM:	No, it's ten sixes.
*CHR:	No, no wait a minute.Nines.What should nine times ten Emma?
*EMM:	One nine is nine, two nines are eighteen, three nines   (.) are
*CHR:	Twenty seven.Four nines are thirty six, five nines are forty five, six nines fifty four, seven nine are sixty three.
*EMM:	Oh thank you.
*CHR:	Right. (.) Yeah, seven nines are sixty three.
*EMM:	Hang on a minute!Six nines are
*CHR:	 (        )  (.) seven nines are sixty three.
*EMM:	Hang on a minute!Seven
*CHR:	Seven nines are sixty three!
*EMM:	Sixty three.
*CHR:	Yeah.
*EMM:	You work them out like that look.
*CHR:	Yeah.Well seven nines, well ee er, it takes you so long 
*EMM:	Look one , one nine is nine
*CHR:	Yeah.
*EMM:	Two nines are   (.) eighteen.
*CHR:	So that one there is   (.) sixes into si thirty six.
*EMM:	I know!But I still don't get what you have to write!
*CHR:	Well multiplication equation for this number line   (.) I would say is   (.) er   (.) I've already told you that.
*EMM:	No, but I don't know what I have to, I have to write!
*CHR:	Eight times four equals thirty six.
*EMM:	Don't get it.
*CHR:	Because it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven   (.) eight, no sorry, nine times four is thirty six.Nine times four equals thirty six.Like this look!
*EMM:	Write it out on a piece of paper and you'll   (        ) and I'll write them down.
*CHR:	No!You do it yourself!I've told you what to do.You do it like that.
*EMM:	I don't get it though!
*CHR:	I'll tell you if it's right. (        ) I'm just writing the answers out for you!I told you what to do.That's lazy!Int it? [laughing] You crafty cow!If I give you a bit of paper and the lot, yeah well you know what to do and go to school and   (.) fill them in!Couldn't it  [] ?
