*JEA:	Yes.

*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	frightened me
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	cos of this.
*JEA:	Yes you can't afford to lose it.
*BRE:	That's right and I mean, you know, it's like now my hair needs cutting and   (.) you know 
*JEA:	 ((cough)) 
*BRE:	you just feel, I think when you've sort of lost much weight 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and I mean   (.) you know, and I always feel the blooming cold!I mean I feel 
*JEA:	Oh yes.
*BRE:	the cold anyway but sort of 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	I said to Dave you could feel my hip bones   (.) and it oh 
*JEA:	Ah!
*BRE:	it was awful!I dunno 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	you know I always said   (.) wouldn't it be lovely to be thin and I said thank God 
*JEA:	No!
*BRE:	for a bit of fat on you!
*JEA:	Oh absolutely!
*BRE:	I said because
*JEA:	Well I remember Jackie  telling me, she came back from   (.) sh she came up to meet me in London one day and she came up with   (.) the woman, a German woman, who at that time was   (.) a buyer for Army and Navy   (.) er   (.) women's fashions   (.) and this woman said that   (.) the model girls   (.) who are so thin   (.) she said   (.) they're always bursting into tears and crying because they're under such stress to keep their weight down   (.) and   (.) their boyfriends don't like it because   (.) the girls are are lovely to have on their arms to take out, you know everybody sort of goggles, you know, lovely slim girl with yellow half way down her back etc.   (.) but, in fact, these girls get very, very ratty!
*BRE:	Mm   (.) have you seen Jackie   (.) lately?
*JEA:	She phoned me a couple of days ago and said, you know, that life was really quite on top of them   (.) her   (.) mother-in-law died and they've had all the problems of putting the old man into a home   (.) the main problem 
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	being of course, is first of all find your home   (.) and while he wasn't in a home he was driving the neighbours mad because he's beginning to get confused and wander about and   (.) maintain that he hasn't had his dinner when two people   [laughing] have already taken him in lunch  [] , you know   (.) and the other problem is erm   (.) er er having found him a very nice home, he didn't want to go!
*BRE:	He didn't want to go?
*JEA:	No   (.) not likely! (.) He wanted to stay in his own place   (.) but Jackie and Neville were nearly driven mad   (.) running up and down to Letchworth when all that they had to do, Jackie's full time teaching and Nev is trying to build as many kitchens or build as many doors   (.) for millionaires as he possibly can.
*BRE:	So how's erm   (.) young Neil?
*JEA:	Neil   (.) poor boy   (.) he had a driving lesson yesterday   (.) came home and said I don't want to do any more!
*BRE:	What driving?
*JEA:	Mm   (.) so   (.) he was going to go up to.
*BRE:	I bet!
*JEA:	Neil, bring cup of tea in here and we'll talk about it   (.) and I didn't really want to spare the time because you could imagine that I wanted to get ready to come away   (.) but I I made myself sit and really give him time
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and he said   (.) he lacks, he totally lacks confidence.
*BRE:	This is what he said?
*JEA:	Yep   (.) and   (.) and he doesn't seem to be able to concentrate   (.) and I said, but Neil you can drive, when you go out with me   (.) you drive beautifully   (.) yes but yours is an automatic car, I said, it's not that I said   (.) you've got road sense   (.) you know what you're doing, I said your good. (.) No I'm not I'm awful! (.) I said look Neil   (.) you can drive, but let's not   (.) let's not take it that I'm saying that you must drive   (.) let's go into the question of why you're making a mess of it at this time   (.) and we, oh honestly   (.) Brenda if I've got black circles under my eyes do not be surprised because, of course, this all goes back to his absolutely, appallingly, stupid mother!
*BRE:	He's really on a downer, isn't he?
*JEA:	He is, he said   (.) my mother said she could have been a forensic scientist if it ha if I hadn't been born! (.) Well Brenda   [laughing] you can tell, I hit the roof  [] ! (.) I mean normally I never criticize the woman because after 
*BRE:	No!
*JEA:	all mothers are sacred   (.) but I just had to put the boot in on her, I'm afraid, I said   (.) stuff! (.) I said she could have taken a degree in her spare time in th she's only she's not yet forty   (.) I said that's absolute rubbish I said th the world is full of these damn women going around saying, if only I hadn't had children I could have been Lord Chief Justice of England, I said, it isn't true! (.) I said an er I said do you think that I wasn't a career woman, I said I gave it all up for yo er to have to look after my young babies   (.) and then when the babies were no longer young, when I   (.) got through that phase of my life I went back and combined   (.) looking after a home very adequately, thank you! (.) With quite a difficult job, I said this is a   (.) I said your mother is living in a fantasy world, of course, I see the stupid bitch prancing around Stowmarket with her silly nose in the air! (.) She's a very conceited woman, Pete  the adulterous told me she was a very conceited woman   (.) and   (.) er Neil says I I I'd have to talk to him to him about this, she couldn't discuss anything with him   (.) she would lay down the law, that was how it had to be   (.) and I said no   (.) I said Gerry and I, I had no hesitation, as I said, in putting the boot in   (.) and Brenda and Dave   (.) take the same the attitude to children   (.) that   (.) you let them   (.) first of all when they're small, you have to tell them no   (.) like you do not 
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	put your handy   (.) in the fire, dear!
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And then when they get bigger   (.) you give them more and more freedom   (.) to do just what they want to do and all you do is watch carefully and make sure they're not doing anything   (.) obviously, outrageously daft   (.) but you let them find themselves   (.) and if there are problems they bring their problems to you and you sit down and you quietly talk about it, there's not shouting, no   (.) I say you've got to do this because I am your parent!
*BRE:	That's obviously her, that was her answer.
*JEA:	 (        ) that's her answer   (.) yes.
*BRE:	You just sort of wa  (.) you know, argue it an 
*JEA:	I know. (.) and and he says too   (.) he had to admit that he's lazy.
*BRE:	Who Neil?
*JEA:	Neil   (.) yeah   (.) and he said my mother is a lazy cow!
*BRE:	Yeah but don't you think he  (.) he he finds, I mean if   (.) alright y y you're not ex always exactly like your parents but if you've bro , if he's brought up, his mother's lazy
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	so I mean   (.) you know, that's part of his life isn't it?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	I mean it's he won't know better.
*JEA:	This is what I said to him   (.) this is what I said to him   (.) an but he said I I see you with all your get up and go   (.) so I didn't make any reply to that.
*BRE:	No.
*JEA:	I thought, well   (.) let it sink in.
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	And I came in one day   (.) a few days ago an and running around like a   (.) bee on heat   (.) with erm   (.) cries of oh   (.) I've got so much to do and no time left in which to do it and I went   (.) ha   (.) I said yes, if you   [laughing] got up early, you know  [] !
*BRE:	That's right   (.) he cos he is very bad on timing isn't he?
*JEA:	Shocking!
*BRE:	I mean, like you say, you ought   (.) you know   (.) you ought to buy her a talking alarm clock for Christmas.
*JEA:	Oh yes, he's got to   (.) have an alarm clock.
*BRE:	Or a radio one 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	so tha that would actually
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	the noise.
*JEA:	Of course, I've I've left him in the charge of   (.) of not   (.) I haven't asked Paul to take him   (.) under his wing over the weekend, but I've left Neil a list of things that I would like done.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	Like get back the dustbins which   (        ) took them out   (.) but she didn't bring them back at the end of the drive   (.) erm   (.) and I hope that Paul   (.) tells him off!
*BRE:	And make him do it, do it.
*JEA:	An and you know, says, look Neil you've got to get your ideas together   (.) because that's what Neil has lacked, he's lacked   (.) masculine influence.
*BRE:	Mm    (.)  (        ) 
*JEA:	It's no good 
*BRE:	now, I mean   (.) you've been very to Neil   (.) over the last year or so   (.) and I mean now it's time to get his act together.
*JEA:	Oh yes.
*BRE:	She can't keep on
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	I mean
*JEA:	I mean I've stopped   (.) I've   (.) I I don't any longer get up and get anybody's breakfast for them.
*BRE:	Nope   (.) but if you get, you know 
*JEA:	I get out   (.) I get out of bed at eight o' clock when the   (.) last of the lodgers has gone   (.) well the last of the   [laughing] two lodgers  [] 
*BRE:	Mm   (.) but you can't 
*JEA:	gone 
*BRE:	you know,y y there's no more now, I mean, running around 
*JEA:	 (        ) er of being unemployed the thi  (.) Neil is the third lodger, of course tha  (.) who   (.) get's out of the pit   [laughing] at about eleven o' clock in the morning  [] !
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	But er that's   (.) from now on Neil has got to carry th  (.) the responsibility for his own actions.
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	I'm not going to bail him out by jumping into the car.
*BRE:	And really he's got to, I mean, you know, alright with work wise   (.) I mean he's got to take   (.) even if, I mean   (.) the kids these days, I mean, even at Neil's age, I mean   (.) you know, I've come the conclusion now   (.) these kids   (.) they think the world owes them something!
*JEA:	Yes they do.
*BRE:	They're not like in our day
*JEA:	I know   (.) no.
*BRE:	I mean they really think   (.) I mean it's like Lee   (.) he's doing this work experience an  (.) yes it's great an it's a bit boring, mum   (.) and Dave said   (.) Lee, you know   (.) wake up!
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	This is reality!
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	This is what people go to work in an office 
*JEA:	Quite.
*BRE:	work nine to five thirty.
*JEA:	Yes   (.) yes.
*BRE:	He said we  (.) I tell you what I didn't like, mum   (.) an I said what? (.) He said, making the tea, I said tough!
*JEA:	Yes, exactly!
*BRE:	I said what do you think   (.) you go 
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	into   (.) your   (.) I said you go into a job, your earning
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	twenty five grand a year an  (.) and you're sat at that desk and you're boss? (.) I said it doesn't it work like that Lee!
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	I said you're the general dogsbody!
*JEA:	Quite   (.) quite.
*BRE:	He said oh God! (.) And I said we 
*JEA:	That's the way life goes 
*BRE:	you know I said that is life!
*JEA:	Yeah   (.) mm.
*BRE:	He said, God, he said   (.) I didn't realize it's like that, I said, no you didn't!
*JEA:	Do you do you think they get a false idea from the television or something,wha what is it?
*BRE:	Well I dunno I thi I think the teachers to be honest, Jean, no you 
*JEA:	Ah!
*BRE:	know   (.) th the teachers in this   (.) I mean   (.) you know I don't know, I mean   (.) so some of the teachers have got   (.) got really weird ideas! (.)  (        ) 
*JEA:	Have they?
*BRE:	I mean, you know,it it's unbelievable! (.) But
*JEA:	Ooh I'd like to know what their weird ideas are.
*BRE:	Well it's just erm   (.) ah I don't know, I mean   (.) there's there's certain things   (.) I mean,it it's like this maths    (        )  (.) I mean, I I spoke to her   (.) erm   (.) and she said yes Lee had come on and everything in his maths   (.) and I said we  (.) the thing is, I said, knowing Lee has difficulty   (.) in in th l in the high level maths, yes you don't want to drop him, but   (.) surely   (.) I said I'm willing to help   (.) in my spare time, Lee's willing to do it and I said   (.) can't you show Lee   (.) I said I'm not   (.) I wasn't trying to tell her
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	you know, that what you were told 
*JEA:	No, no, no, no   (.) no 
*BRE:	 (        )  (.) and I think   (        ) 
*JEA:	Yes well I think I told him a wrong, you see, there were two   (.) there there are two ways of tackling it and I don't think the way I told him is what they want for the examination purposes, at all!
*BRE:	Oh I don't know   (.) he under , when   (.) you that told he understood it a lot more   (.) than when she said it   (.) and she sort of went all 
*JEA:	She's probably trying to explain them in a very complicated way of doing maths.
*BRE:	No she answered me, she said well I haven't got time to sit down, explain it to them, they just gotta, if they're in a high level they should be able to grasp it and I 
*JEA:	Frankly I think that's very bad 
*BRE:	that's no attitude!
*JEA:	you know, that is no attitude! (.) That's bad!
*BRE:	You know the fact is they've got to   (.) erm   (.) be explained.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	Erm   (.) I mean, Carla I can't fault her teachers.
*JEA:	No, no 
*BRE:	at that church one   (.) she has learnt so much   (.) erm   (.) I mean this   (.) to speak French, now she speaking it in three weeks!
*JEA:	She's excellent isn't she   (.) yes.
*BRE:	You know, it's unbeliev 
*JEA:	Three weeks!
*BRE:	three weeks, that's all she's been doing it.
*JEA:	That's marvellous.
*BRE:	You know, I mean   (.) but this teacher won't stand no nonsense   (.) and I said to Lee   (.) y you were at it three years before you could speak like Carla speaks it! (.) You know she has learnt so much! (.) Erm i in this school, I mean 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	they're very strict   (.) I mean 
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	you know   (.) but I think half of Lee's it   (        ) there's no discipline
*JEA:	No ha
*BRE:	but then
*JEA:	and when you try t  (.) in the past when I tried to find some way   (.) of imposing discipline, there is no way because   (.) quite rightly, you're not allowed to strike children, I never wanted to and I   (.) I hardly ever did   (.) at one school where   (.) there was a marvellous spirit of give and take   (.) I used to whip off my little black velvet slipper occasionally and whack some of the larger boys about the top of the thigh.just for fun, you know   (.) but I'm not a believer in using your fists, you ought to be using your brain to teach with   (.) but   (.) there were no   (.) there are no sanctions, if you say   (.) you must stay behind after school, you have to send a letter home   (.) and half the parents will write back and say my son or daughter is not staying after school and that is that!
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And that's their right   (.) and so   (.) you think of something else we  (.) you're not allowed to take them out of a favourite lesson, you're not allowed to say   (.) you are going to miss your football or a P E   (.) P E teachers and the football teachers, quite rightly, say   (.) if you can't keep discipline in your class why    (.)  [laughing] why should we be penalized  [] ?
*BRE:	Mm   (.) that's right.
*JEA:	And er   (.) you're pretty helpless really.
*BRE:	You are.
*JEA:	You see the only way that you can really discipline them   (.) is when you have a school where   (.) the rules have been very, very strict from the moment that they went into that school   (.) and they have had their noses held to the grindstone   (.) with work up to their brows   (.) and they just don't think of being tiresome   (.) and anybody who is tiresome is pulled out and put in a special room on their own, called a sin bin   (.) an which is rather boring   (.) and made to work even   ((laugh)) harder!
*BRE:	Mm   (.) but no what I'm   (.) sort of, getting back, I mean, you know, I don't   (.) I think it's the kids   (.) I mean, I dunno why? (.) Whether they have too much or what they have   (.) but, I mean   (.) they're just   (.) they just think everybody owes them something, and it's like Neil, I mean, to me   (.) I mean   (.) I can't see why he can't get off his backside   (.) and go and work in a supermarket   (.) but it's not the job they want, the same answer I said to  (        ) 
*JEA:	I think at the moment Brenda he would take   (.) any job if he could get one.
*BRE:	He would take if offered it?
*JEA:	Yes I think so I   (        ) 
*BRE:	There's a lot of   (        ) I mean it's like 
*JEA:	To be fair   (.) to be fair to him I think that he would   (.) erm   (.) he's set his heart on going and working at the lawn mower place on the production line 
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and he isn't   (.) in my opinion   (.) really considering half the other jobs, but he has said that he wants that   (.) and by the mercy of providence   (.) this business of Lee being flung out by Andy   (.) and being   (.) put back onto the   (.) into the job centre coincides with my being   (.) very tight on money.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	You'll notice that I've said to you   (.) we're going to run the  (        ) .
*BRE:	That's right, yeah.
*JEA:	And I'm going to pay it back   (.) with lodgers money really.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	I mean   (.) my dear, I said to Paul, Paul yesterday was was   (.) babbling on about   (.) if Karen would take him back and I said Paul   (.) I shall be extremely displeased if you ever leave this house   (.) to go back to   (.) Karen, you know o after only being with me for something like three or four weeks, I said you'll never come back again   (.) I said I'm not going to be messed about like that!
*BRE:	No that's right! (.) What did he say to that?
*JEA:	Oh    [laughing]  (.) I'm counting on you, lodgers money  [] !
*BRE:	That's right.
*JEA:	And I am Brenda!
*BRE:	Yeah, but thing is   (.) I mean, you know, there's a lot of kids out there, I mean I've know with, sort of, Lee's friend   (.) you know, okay, with us I mean   (.) with Lee o okay we don't I've often said to him, why don't you get a Saturday job? (.) And he said no   (.) and I said okay, fair enough   (.) but then, you know   (.) you can say to Lee, well   (.) if you want something   (.) now you're gonna have to work
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	and then he will, he'll go and do something.
*JEA:	Yes   (.) mm let's go here   (.) I won't talk.
*BRE:	Erm
*JEA:	Erm
*BRE:	but thing is there's a lot lot of like Lee's friends and that and they say   (.) well I couldn't work in a shoe shop and I wouldn't work in a, and I say why?
*JEA:	Quite.
*BRE:	Well they say, well would you do jobs you don't like? (.) Yes if I need the money.
*JEA:	The   (.) the only job which I told Neil I do not expect him to take   (.) is working for   (        ) waste disposal   (.) because he did that, this time last year   (.) and before he started he was full of big talk about you make a lot of money and you get a lot of tips at Christmas   (.) he found that   (.) you do not make a lot of money   (.) and you do not get generous tips at Christmas
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and he used to come home   (.) looking as white as a sheet   (.) sick to the teeth   (.) and he used to just go to bed and collapse in a heap, he isn't strong enough to do it and it's pointless for him to try   (.) but other than that he can do anything he fancies.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	I vir  (        ) I just got 
*BRE:	Neil, I mean he 
*JEA:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	No but I mean he has had a bad start 
*JEA:	 (        )  (.) and hasn't had the example of either a mother or a father   (.) who understands the necessity of 
*BRE:	But there are a lot of 
*JEA:	 (        ) work.
*BRE:	that have had the support   (.) but they won't get off their backsides and it tends to be this ge generation.
*JEA:	Well you know when my son was eighteen   (.) he and his friends were entertaining each other to pocket parties at which they were   (.) working out   (.) what University courses they were going to apply for
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	and what they wanted was the easiest ones   (.) and they came up with the answer   (.) economics   (.) Gerald simply, we Ge Gerry and I put our heads together and went bib bib bib bib bib, you know as good parents do   (.) and we both presented him with a   (.) fait accompli you either take an engineering degree, we don't care what sort   (.) or   (.) you go out to work in a bank   (.) because   (.) economics   (.) you will not get a first   (.) because you are not reader and t to   (.) get a first in economics, which is what you'll need if you're gonna make any money out of it 
*BRE:	Mm 
*JEA:	and have a decent life   (.) to get a first or either a two one in economics   (.) you have got to read   (.) a very great deal, you've got to be a reader, a student   (.) a taker of notes, a writer of essays   (.) and we said that is not you   (.) so    (.)  ((laughing))within two 
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	minutes he was looking through all the advertisements for civil engineering  [] .
*BRE:	That's right   (.) but you had the encouragement, who's that waving?
*JEA:	Who   (.) where?
*BRE:	That car in front   (.) I dunno, he was waving, I just hope it wasn't   (.) waving at us.
*JEA:	That one E E?
*BRE:	I dunno.
*JEA:	The Fiesta?
*BRE:	Maybe she wasn't waving at us 
*JEA:	No 
*BRE:	it was only for a minute.
*JEA:	Oh.
*BRE:	No, no, no, she's not
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	I think she's realized she's made a mistake    (.)  [laughing] she was waving away  [] .
*JEA:	Oh yes, yes, yes.
*BRE:	And thought it was somebody else.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	But er   (.) no I mean there's   (.) th there's   (        ) 
*JEA:	 ((cough)) 
*BRE:	that they've just, you know   (.) I mean some of the kids   (.) I don't know where we were going   (.) me and Dave   (.) somewhere or other we were   (.) and there was some kids an and their attitude, you know, it's   (.) well why should we do this, you know 
*JEA:	Mm.
