*PHI:	Right what do you want? •835272_839732•
*DAV:	Take one sheet. •839822_842102•
*PHI:	I've got one sheet. •842412_842992•
*DAV:	Take the green crayon then. •842992_845892•
*PHI:	Right, I've got the green crayon. •845892_847112•
*DAV:	Put it that way. •847542_848162•
*PHI:	Hang on let me just  turn the television down. •849562_851842•
        You  you keep your eye on it so that when your tram programme comes on we can watch it. •855312_859122•
        Right. •860362_860622•
        What to do? •860852_861252•
*DAV:	Well it's •867522_867872•
*PHI:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	that way you need it. •869602_871402•
        I want a table for this. •871762_873822•
*PHI:	Well you can't use these tables. •874132_875722•
        Don't  let me just move this  magazine. •875722_879572•
*DAV:	Write  five on it. •886812_889762•
*PHI:	Have I got to write five on mine? •889872_892052•
*DAV:	Yes. •892252_892392•
*PHI:	Right. •893222_893592•
        My green pen doesn't write very well. •893872_895692•
        There you are. •895762_896102•
*DAV:	Double add. •899802_900382•
*PHI:	Double add? •900942_901322•
        I'm not used to double add. •901322_903112•
        Five plus plus  equals •905612_909672•
*DAV:	Equals •910012_910812•
*PHI:	Equals, equals? •910922_911932•
        Well this is a bit of a nonsense. •913822_915442•
        What's that? •925422_925782•
        One hundred plus plus •925782_927452•
*DAV:	Equals, equals. •928502_933182•
*PHI:	Equals, equals. •933912_934652•
*DAV:	Now it gets easier. •934652_935762•
*PHI:	Mhm. •936632_936962•
*DAV:	Now it gets really even harder. •939302_940472•
*PHI:	Well which way is it? •942692_943572•
        Does it get harder or easier? •943572_944812•
        Three hundred. •948332_949062•
*DAV:	Mm. •949642_949832•
*PHI:	Oh, three hundred and four. •950592_951832•
        I, I'm not understanding when you're doing plus plus when you're writing down yourself. •957962_961952•
        What are you trying to prove? •965312_966332•
*DAV:	Divide •967502_967862•
*PHI:	Mm. •968002_968492•
        Well that's, that's, that's very good for divide, but that's a square root sign. •969862_973102•
*DAV:	A square root. •973102_975232•
*PHI:	A square root at three hundred and four? •976252_978022•
*DAV:	Yes. •978022_978112•
*PHI:	Haven't a clue. •979732_980372•
*DAV:	Equals •981282_981732•
*PHI:	Equals  now what do you want me to do with all these? •982572_985322•
*DAV:	Guess. •988902_989082•
*PHI:	Oh I'm guessing. •990102_990822•
*DAV:	Write your name at the top. •993322_994552•
*PHI:	It's alright writing my name Dave but what am I doing? •997002_999382•
        Mm? •100665_100678•
*DAV:	It's easier and easier. •100754_100881•
*PHI:	Well it doesn't look easy. •100996_101072•
        Look, I'll do the usual. •101072_101193•
        Let me write you down some sums. •101193_101489•
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	And you, you can answer them. •101501_101671•
*DAV:	Okay. •101721_101739•
*PHI:	Sorry. •102455_102482•
        I've put an answer in where you don't want. •102499_102643•
        There you are. •106939_106972•
        There's a nice list of sums for you. •106987_107149•

*DAV:	What  •107308_107317•
*PHI:	those. •107317_107343•
        That's it. •107489_107645•
*DAV:	Well it isn't easy. •107645_107793•
        It's the right one. •107875_108845•
*PHI:	yes, you got it right. •109062_109134•
        I, I shouldn't have written that. •109166_109281•
