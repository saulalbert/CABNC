@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 040702)
*FRA:	A lot of cars at the school this morning. •127641_127847•
        I parked right on the end of the erm  the lane, just  •127899_128397•
*LYN:	Mm  •128397_128404•
*FRA:	in, there was just enough room for me. •128404_128506•
*LYN:	Mm? •128611_128617•
*FRA:	Course we were late anyway  well not late for John's but  •128707_129287•
*LYN:	Which way do you go  •129613_129651•
*FRA:	When I came back  •129651_129691•
*LYN:	into ? •129691_129729•
        Cos you can cut through that   •129918_129990•
*FRA:	I turn round and go back, yeah. •129993_130085•
*LYN:	Mm. •130152_130165•
*FRA:	And of course the coach had come up the hill  couldn't overtake where I was parked, blocking off the entrance to the lane where I'd just come out of so that the string of cars coming down the road and the first one wanting to turn in and of course the coach had covered it. •130207_131328•
*LYN:	Oh yeah •131328_131337•
*FRA:	It was completely blocked off  coach couldn't go backwards because there was cars behind it. •131342_132068•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	So I gingerly walked down and crept into the car realized that I was the one that had caused all that  •132068_132595•
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	and drove off    •132595_132674•
*LYN:	And ignored   •132706_132738•
*FRA:	Slinked off into the mist. •132738_132844•
*LYN:	So he couldn't back back then  •132844_133095•
*FRA:	No  no that that was it, completely stalemate. •133632_133826•
*LYN:	 ((laugh)) 
*FRA:	big Volvo estate was facing  if he'd go down there, I can get through and he can come back again and  he wasn't gonna do that. •133951_134637•
        Too much  brain damage   •134656_135156•
*LYN:	there's a big notice at the end of the lane which says  •135270_135730•

*LYN:	Oh, yeah. •136118_136189•

*LYN:	and turn and go back again. •136678_136839•

*LYN:	Mm •157972_157978•

*FRA:	give you a free colour portable with it. •163134_163625•
*LYN:	Oh. •163625_163641•

        He came in  and trampling this brake fluid all over the carpet. •173479_174430•
        He got through to the  base camp to find out when the  chap was coming to fix it. •174430_175187•
        Five minutes later he came in trying to tell  tell us jokes and each time he'd been paddling through this brake fluid and the carpet is just  you know, brains •175190_176382•
