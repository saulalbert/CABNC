*GIL:	I did wonder what er like when I saw Ben I did wonder what he'd  how he'd think, if I'd changed and stuff. •121524_122166•
        You know? •122248_122263•
        I'll tell you what, the bed that me and Frank slept in was  so gorgeous . •122263_122716•
*JEM:	 ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	It was so nice, it was like erm   feather thing, feather, feather mattress. •122716_124037•
*JEM:	Feather mattress? •124063_124140•
*GIL:	Yeah. •124206_124212•
        I think it was feather, or down or something. •124224_124592•
        So it wasn't bouncy but the way that it fitted, or the way that you lay on it, it was just so comfortable, yeah, gorgeous. •124613_125743•
        And I realized it was the first time I actually slept in a bed with Frank ever. •125743_126060•
*JEM:	Yeah? •126196_126226•
        I've ever, I've only slept with him once. •126226_126422•
*GIL:	Or like I've, I've slept with him in tents and stuff but not in a bed. •126457_126725•
*JEM:	Yeah. •126895_126903•
*GIL:	And Ben like  when we were sort of there Ben sort of we'd been sitting around for a while and he said it's very embarrassing to have to ask this but you're staying the night and stuff  erm are you two a couple  or are you just friends   so no, just friends but it's alright, if you don't have any spare rooms we'll be perfectly happy to sleep together, don't worry. •126903_128481•
        It was just funny  having him asking me. •128481_129159•
        Yeah it was a good weekend it was, it was a very good weekend but packed  so much packed in. •129198_130038•
        You know I was only away for two nights, it felt like about a week. •130038_130351•
*JEM:	You saw a lot of people, went a lot of places. •130351_130649•
*GIL:	Yeah. •130649_130690•
        Shame Tom wasn't in. •130741_130832•
        We were like ringing the bell and both of us were desperate for a crap, absolutely desperate, and desperate for a cup of tea cos we got up at er half seven. •130832_131565•
*JEM:	Oh well  missed him. •132990_133181•
        What a shame. •133181_133240•
*GIL:	It might have been easier actually to say she's not coming. •133240_133827•
        Are you into going to a pub tonight? •133848_134101•
*JEM:	I want to  wash my hair and •134119_134411•
*GIL:	I should stay in, I'm stupid going out again. •134411_134629•
*JEM:	I mean I, I can see why you're going out but it's, you know  I need, I need to have a night in I mean  I've done, I've had so many stupidly late nights. •134629_135490•
*GIL:	Mm. •135815_135830•
        Tell you what I must do actually whilst I'm thinking about it is do  take one lot of washing out and put another lot in. •135848_136537•
        Yeah now we've got radiators it's very easy. •136537_136744•
*JEM:	Yeah. •136852_136878•

*GIL:	Yeah, I know what you mean. •139368_139474•
        It's the way that she kind of like answers before you've really got done finishing what you're saying. •139475_139778•
