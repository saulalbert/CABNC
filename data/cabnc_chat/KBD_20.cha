@Comment:	conversation #20 (Tape 064301)
*BAR:	See this was, this was the dance floor before
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	er, where it follows this line.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	And it was a sort of   (.) funny shaped thing.Yeah.Just to here.And it was like, nothing, so we just extended all this out   (.) and made it into a stage come, a bigger dance floor cos the I don't know why they wa always seem to have this trends that, they have these trends in the seventies and that was, and eighties of having small dance floors 
*ALA:	Right tiny dance floors, yeah.
*BAR:	Right, that's   (.) and the disco console was open to the public so the public could just wander in and tap the D J on the   (.) back and tu change his records for him or whatever.It's a   (.) stupid opera so we've fenced that in.Erm   (.) but this is the area up here   (.) Anne, that I was sort of thinking that we could   (.) if we can, some kind of trellis or something   (.) around this raised area here   (.) you could actually open this bit   (.) as the, as a pub on a
*ALA:	With what?Sorry!
*BAR:	as a sort of pub, you know, on a Saturday and Sunday in the season. (.) Food and that.You know, and with a big screen you can have like   (.) sport or Grandstand or
*ALA:	Right.
*BAR:	ro music videos or whatever you wanna do. (.) Get satellite in and get M T V on.Mind you, the satellite's gonna cost three hundred quid!Roughly.
*ALA:	This is like cocktail bar bit
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	isn't it?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	 ((cough)) 
*BAR:	I mean, change all the, paint o pa  (.) paint all the, change all the green to sort of red 
*ALA:	Green shouldn't be up anyway.
*BAR:	Yeah.Red, and then you got the white pick out
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and you got the blue seats, so you've got red, white and blue haven't you?
*ALA:	Yeah. (.) They aren't cheap chairs these either 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	are they?
*BAR:	Oh no.Nothing was cheap, I mean 
*ALA:	No I wouldn't have thought it was.
*BAR:	the seats are good, you know, these tables are bloody heavy!And they've done a   (.) you know, they did a good job when they built it.Erm   (.) I mean, you can see what he, what he intended doing   (.) was   (.) the plans were beautiful!This was   (.) gonna be   (.) there's a piano there on that 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	raised area there, so this was like a piano bar
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	there was gonna be a big fountain   (.) in the middle there
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	this wasn't gonna be disco
*ALA:	No.
*BAR:	a big fountain in the middle there
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and an orange grow
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	type affect, it was gonna be called the ora this was the blue one, so that was the orange
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	purple, whatever.The bar was a double-sided open
*ALA:	Bar across that other side?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Great!
*BAR:	And the other side
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	which was gonna be a big glassed disco
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	in there, and that was gonna be the disco, and this was the, you know, I mean it was a good idea, I don't know why he pulled out with   (.) went half-cock.Erm   (.) you know.
*ALA:	True.
*BAR:	These are the things we were talking about yesterday   (.) these uprights.I mean they just
*ALA:	Erm 
*BAR:	open for
*ALA:	well you could shorten them anyway.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	You could just shorten them And 
*BAR:	I mean they're very sort of vandal   (.) easy or whatever.Vandal a fa er vandal friendly   (.) hooligan friendly aren't they?
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Whatever!You know, I mean we just got them cheap   (.) erm   (.) lampshades from now on er cos it's not worth it cos th the expensive ones are just getting damaged all the time.
*ALA:	We could shorten them anyway and just put lamps on them.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Whatever.If you don't hang them on Gerry's   (.) thingy anyway.
*BAR:	No you don't.That's right. (.) See, if you sort of somehow trellis that area, that side in you could actually have this mo more intimate if people just wanted to
*ALA:	Snog!
*BAR:	sit in here.Yeah.Yeah.If you got, you know, if you got a character behind the bar   (.) could er   (.) attract people   (.) by his own force of personality.
*ALA:	I think erm   (.) you could   (.) but you know, really then you think when 
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	they come in we can start 
*BAR:	Oh yeah.Yeah.Yeah it is. (.) Cos I wouldn't lo  (.) I mean I actually don't think you can do, if you're gonna do   (.) people are gonna eat I th I think you're gonna be pushed at   (.) more than about hundred and fifty to two hundred. (.) You know, depends on how you retail it first but 
*ALA:	I think it depends which it, what you 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	do.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Erm
*BAR:	I mean, it depends a as you say, er yeah I mean it does depend that.Cos if, if you, if you, if you wanted to you could always utilize all the dance floor area   (.) tables and things, you know.If you had that kind of function that you   (.) you know
*ALA:	Mm.Makes it difficult to do a big functions though in here with that stage.
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*ALA:	You know, to set out 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	you co there's no way 
*BAR:	Yeah it does.
*ALA:	you can set out for two hundred.
*BAR:	No.No.What we did do 
*ALA:	And so 
*BAR:	very well
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	erm   (.) we were we some of the jazz stuff, I mean 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	it   (.) it, it never worked in a sense that it wasn't commercially viable
*ALA:	No.
*BAR:	but   (.) things like Kenny Ball and that we'd had 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and we had like the ta  (.) trestle tables in all these alcoves and people came and actually booked a meal
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and, and, you had a meal and sat and watched   (.) the band and everything.It wor i I mean   (.) for those   (.) it did work 
*ALA:	Different   (        ) sort of like 
*BAR:	it did work.
*ALA:	Yeah.Just 
*BAR:	But 
*ALA:	need the
*BAR:	you can see everywhere.And it did 
*ALA:	Put hot food 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	up at the back as well there.
*BAR:	Mm.Have you actually   (.) ever seen round this place properly?
*ALA:	Not properly.No I haven't really.Whe whe where do you get to that round, round 
*BAR:	No.
*ALA:	part?
*BAR:	No, you can't that's one of the   (.) do you wanna sta I'll just go and get the key so you can have a 
*ALA:	Yeah, go on.
*BAR:	quick look in there.
*ALA:	I'll go up there.
*BAR:	Get your bearings.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	It actually looks bigger looking that way   (.) than it does when you're up there looking back, I think.Erm   (.) I'm thinking of atmosphere. (.) But if we   (.) if we carpet the two raised areas in a sort of   (.) attract hardwearing linoey type affect on there cos you can 
*ALA:	What about the slipping?
*BAR:	you can dance.Well   (.) you get
*ALA:	The carpet, don't it really up here?
*BAR:	No.Well i it's been down   (.) since it opened so that's
*ALA:	Oh!
*BAR:	gotta be eight or nine years.
*ALA:	Mm!It's done well then.
*BAR:	It's done well.
*ALA:	It was on 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	concrete 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	like.Oh right.So this is just, this is just virtually there, you can't get through that way anywhere?
*BAR:	No you can't, no.
*ALA:	Oh.Right.
*BAR:	Like, so it's sort of self-contained   (.) in one 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	sense. (.) Er
*ALA:	Right.So it'll have to be that one in there.
*BAR:	And
*ALA:	Oh!So   (.) right. (.) Right.
*BAR:	When Trish  had a   (.) do   (.) in here, her fortieth   (.) she let 
*ALA:	A what?
*BAR:	er Trish  had her fortieth birthday   (.) here.She laid   (.) there's a tremendous amount of wasted space here   (.) really.
*ALA:	There is!
*BAR:	 (        )  (.) Erm
*ALA:	Ah!This stage across.
*BAR:	Yeah.She laid out in here and people just wandered in off the back end   (.) here.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	But I mean we've always wanted to utilize this but we can't really   (.) we built that wall here   (.) and it's just a   (.) this is the back of the disco.I mean   (.) al it's all, none of it's sort of 
*ALA:	Determined wall.
*BAR:	determined walls, I mean, it's no   (.) no wall there at all.I mean we put this up just 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	to break that 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	 ((sneeze))  (.) because this is the console bar. ((cough)) 
*ALA:	Is that Cola?
*BAR:	It's for   (.) it's for the cellar, yeah.
*ALA:	This is nice and big innit?
*BAR:	Well it's not, I mean
*ALA:	Should think they've had quite a few  (        ) .
*BAR:	Not bad.Oh yeah!Mm.Obviously you've got a better eye tha than I have, but er
*ALA:	You wa er what you want in here is one tha is tha is what's e what's extraction like?Is it good?
*BAR:	Fine.
*ALA:	You want a chair for over here for doing 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	American stuff.
*BAR:	Yeah, you do, yeah.
*ALA:	Do   (.) kebabs and everything.
*BAR:	Yeah.We've got erm   (.) somewhere, a pizza oven.
*ALA:	Oh!You, have you got a 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	pizza oven?
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ALA:	Right.So that's alright.I've enough afternoons  (        ) . ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	Well, you won't need to do that now.It's somewhere anyway, we've got 
*ALA:	Jesus wept!
*BAR:	pizza oven.
*ALA:	What is it?
*BAR:	Ice making machine.
*ALA:	What's that, a dishwasher?
*BAR:	Glass washer, yeah.
*ALA:	Glass washer, I meant.
*BAR:	We've got er 
*ALA:	Have you got one behind bar?
*BAR:	No.There's not.
*ALA:	There int one behind the bar?
*BAR:	No.
*ALA:	Oh out in garden.Oh right!I see.
*BAR:	So basically they've gotta just tray it up
*ALA:	What you want is 
*BAR:	tray it up here and then 
*ALA:	yeah, here and then
*BAR:	bang it straight in.Erm
*ALA:	Why's your bar so high?I can't reach your pump   (.)  (        ) .
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Have you?
*BAR:	We like to keep the floor nice and sticky so the staff can't run away!
*ALA:	Oh I see.
*BAR:	Once they're behind here they're stuck all night.
*ALA:	Think you got some cleaning, you just want   (.) that back in.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	You know what I mean, it's got   (.)  (        ) . (.) And all that up there.Mm!Now then, so you'd   (.) carpet them two
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	and then   (.) summat   (.) washed
*BAR:	Well you see, hardly anybody ever sa  (.) they don't really sit in this area, all they do is er, I mean, they only sit 
*ALA:	Around the bar.
*BAR:	right at the end of the, you know 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	when it's full   (.) they'll sit on those two tables.
*ALA:	You were going to clear that area anyway, don't they?
*BAR:	Yeah.I mean, everybody round here just stands   (.) or sits on those bar stools.
*ALA:	Mm. (.) Yeah.
*BAR:	When people first come in they go for the raised areas and sit down.O 
*ALA:	You have to see.
*BAR:	or they stand at the bar.It's, and, and if you actually look on the actual area we're talking about, there's only one, two, three, four, there's only about   (.) half a dozen tables.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Which is, you know, at maximum you're gonna get twenty four people sat around there anyway.So I think, in a way, it's erm   (.) a bit wasted carpeting it all.Cos it's a big area 
*ALA:	I do.
*BAR:	to carpet.
*ALA:	One, two, three
*BAR:	I mean   (.) the quotes we had ranged from sort of
*ALA:	Well you,wo did you look to change the carpet 
*BAR:	eighteen to twenty seven.
*ALA:	 (.) because of the name on it?
*BAR:	Well   (.) yeah, and 
*ALA:	You are?
*BAR:	and it's getting past it to be honest.I mean, these metal strips are down there for the public entertainment license, they weren't gonna give us it because the carpet was lifting.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	So   (.) I mean, not, weren't gonna give us it, but we had to do it for
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you know, at the time.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	And you can see like   (.) like there   (.) can you see straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet, but there's er been a li a bit of a leak at some stage.
*ALA:	Oh right, I see.
*BAR:	There's one there.I mean
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	if you've got it carpeted, once you got that you, you're   (.) you're stuck aren't you?You know 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you've either got   (.) I mean, we've either gotta put a   [laughing] table on top of it or   [] 
*ALA:	Yeah, that's it, or sit on there or get 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	somebody to stand with it 
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALA:	you know.Yes.
*BAR:	Erm   (.) or replace the whole damn carpet.I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune   (.)  (        ) !
*ALA:	Bloody hell!It must, it must have been absolute   (.) arm and a leg.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	Absolute arm and a leg. (.)  [sighing] Er   [] 
*BAR:	But it   (.) it's not a bad size room in the sense that 
*ALA:	No it int, no, it's, it is 
*BAR:	in the sense that you can get three hundred in
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	well we often get four hundred in if you're   (.) you know, I mean, just have the right 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	party   (.) erm
*ALA:	How many you licensed for?
*BAR:	Three hundred.
*ALA:	Three.
*BAR:	But, you can get   (.) but a hundred people can have a decent atmosphere as well.
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	You know, it 
*ALA:	Well that, that's good you see 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	cos I mean some places that are fairly big   (.) th the, if you've got hundred in they just, it looks empty don't it?
*BAR:	No that's right.That's right.I mean 
*ALA:	Erm 
*BAR:	that's the Carlton's problem innit?You know, if it, unless it gets 
*ALA:	Ooh!God!Yeah.
*BAR:	unless he's got five hundred in yo yo you feel as if you're in a barn   (.) aircraft hanger.
*ALA:	Well that's right.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	But the sort of chromea and all that sort of lends itself to one of them aircraft things doesn't 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	it?Yeah.
*BAR:	It does.It does, yeah. (.) So you wouldn't have to spend a fortune on, on, on   (.) I mean it's only a matter of   (.) most of it's a matter of paint, and then hanging a few things up isn't it?Change the atmosphere.
*ALA:	Well er, yeah well it is, but I think   (.) cos one, you've got to look at, oh a bit of a design as well a  (.) while you're at it you might as well just get one or two bits
*BAR:	Oh yeah.Yeah.
*ALA:	you know 
*BAR:	Yeah, yeah.True.
*ALA:	Erm   (.) oh yeah.One, two   (.) it's alright, I'm trying to   (.) think. ((laugh))  (.) if you're gonna   (.) make all this into a dance floor and all the rest of it what's the be a er er er   (.) benefit of having a stage? (.) If all this is virtually gonna be   (.) it's virtually gonna be dance floor int it really?
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	Well there is no benefit.
*ALA:	Cos if you didn't have that it'd make this room more viable   (.) in as much as erm, the point of view of doing   (.) doing catering   (.) and, functions and all the rest of it.You can't, you couldn't   (.) say right we'll do a function for   (.) hundred and fifty and two hundred, and really to do, you've got to be looking to do a, a sit down function for two hundred
*BAR:	Right.
*ALA:	if you, because   (.) it's more than the Headway can do 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	comfortably.And it's more than   (.) er, and you can certainly do a better job than the Carlton so   (.) I mean, you don't call, I mean, you don't call him any   (.) competition at all I don't   (.) but, you've got to look at being able to do functions for two hundred.
*BAR:	Mm.Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it?
*ALA:	Well it is, but having, yeah but with their 
*BAR:	Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms?
*ALA:	I'm talking about the Carlton.
*BAR:	Right.
*ALA:	Not Chelstons.
*BAR:	Not Chelstons, right.
*ALA:	The Carlton up 
*BAR:	Right.
*ALA:	here.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	It, really and truthfully, like the Headway do plenty of functions and the rest of it   (.) but   (.) you can do a better job than Headway.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	No two ways about,wi it   (.) in a min in a  (        ) .But if you can do, if, if you can do a two hundred thing for sit down   (.) you're gonna be in among the functions.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	Definitely.Plus the fact like you sa er like I say, if you're gonna have a dance floor in here there int any benefit about having the raised area is there?
*BAR:	No, that's very true.
*ALA:	And er, and it, it   (.) it makes a lot of difference actually.I would have thought so.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	I mean, cos the bands can still set up can't they?
*BAR:	Oh yeah.
*ALA:	If they sit up   (.) here 
*BAR:	Well you can do what, yeah.
*ALA:	Yeah.But they still sit up there and they can still see them.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	And it's makes it a   (.) it makes it a different space, totally different.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	And like I say, if you're gonna carpet it   (.) er not carpet it, you're gonna cover it   (.) you might as well cover it   (.) totally.
*BAR:	Oh yeah.Well 
*ALA:	I wonder what you'd use though?
*BAR:	You ca you're gonna, you're gonna cover it, I mean we've got to re 
*ALA:	You've gotta cover that anyway.
*BAR:	we've got to re-cover that 
*ALA:	That's what 
*BAR:	stage anyway.
*ALA:	So you're not   (.) so all you're 
*BAR:	So 
*ALA:	doing is taking that out, but 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	surely in a lot of ways it might   (.) makes all the difference Barry.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	Makes it   (.) and it makes in a way   (        ) so that it, it's not a
*BAR:	Well you can create a dance floor area with tables and chairs.
*ALA:	Yeah, course you can.
*BAR:	All you do is just   (.) put them round there.
*ALA:	Just put them round.
*BAR:	I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House
*ALA:	Well that's   (.) terrific!
*BAR:	they've got er actual   (.) flat floors.
*ALA:	Get rid of all that and you have got more table area because   (.) i they can sort of sit in th in the, the 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	gangway
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	you know, so I think, I think that would   (.) it's alright I just keep freezing up.
*BAR:	Do you wanna sit in there rather than 
*ALA:	No my, I'm better stood here.
*BAR:	Oh.
*ALA:	No I'm better stood here.But I've got to   (.) I do this you know, I just sit and look.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	Oh no, I don't stand a lot.
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALA:	Well that's   (.) but I've, I've got to er, so I think definitely that wants to come out.Erm   (.) and er
*BAR:	Because, I mean, if you ever got anything you really need a little, you could always bring a little stage in.
*ALA:	Well    (        )  (.) Yeah.Staging's no problem is 
*BAR:	No.
*ALA:	it?
*BAR:	No.
*ALA:	You know
*BAR:	I mean
*ALA:	now we need erm   (.) alright we're gonna, we'll keep   (.) these mirrors and everything.Them mirror tiles and everything.
*BAR:	I should think so.They cost us a fortune!
*ALA:	Cos I mean them marked  (        ) .I nearly ca what they call it?Aren't they?
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	Called the  (        ) .Er, it's just that re-seating that   (.) just on that middle one actually, that's bad int it?
*BAR:	Mm.Well I've,yo  (.) you need to redo the, the fixed seating.I mean, some of it o you'll get away with, but generally you re you need to recover it, it's going all over the place   (.) and it
*ALA:	What if you could get something with stars and stripes on?
*BAR:	Mm.Yes, but it's dirt   (.) on it.The trouble with the American red, it's a, it's, it's not a maroon it's a
*ALA:	No, it's
*BAR:	bright pillar box type 
*HUG:	Mm.
*BAR:	red innit?
*ALA:	Yes.
*BAR:	You know it's
*ALA:	Oh my God!You don't want to 
*BAR:	So if anybody, if anybody spills anything on it or whatever 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	it's gonna show like a  (        ) .
*ALA:	Yeah.Well that's one's left, cos that one, well it's better than green when it's down isn't it?
*BAR:	Mm.But I thi 
*ALA:	I know that sort of creates that atmosphere there but I think erm   (.) sorry!Go on.Get them lamps down, I think.Cos I mean,yo you can easily chop them off and put summat else smaller on can't you with lamps on?
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	If you want to create that sort of an atmosphere.Are we   (.) there int a door is there from kitchen to there?
*BAR:	Well it's
*ALA:	There's just a hatch which is alright 
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	because then   (.) well that'll just do service from there, but the only trouble about that is that  (        ) .Anyway, not to worry.
*BAR:	Alright.
*ALA:	Round again then.Nay problem.
*BAR:	I mean, if you've got a function you haven't got that much of bar trade
*ALA:	No, but 
*BAR:	in the sense that 
*ALA:	No.
*BAR:	being busy have you?
*ALA:	No.
*BAR:	You know.
*ALA:	No.No.And is   (        ) erm   (.) yeah I think that'd make all the difference if that comes out.You can soon redo the D J's little er
*BAR:	Oh yeah.No, I think you'd leave the D J's   (        ) 
*ALA:	Oh yeah, but I mean you can soon sort of make it so that it's er 
*BAR:	Oh yeah, well   (.) Jean keeps buying 
*ALA:	it's extended.
*BAR:	Jean keeps, [laughing] Jean keeps buying these   (.) this atrocious cheap wallpaper and sticking it everywhere  [] !
*ALA:	Oh my God!
*BAR:	 ((laugh))  (.)  [laughing] Look at that  [] !
*ALA:	Well yeah, it looks erm   (.) you can put same thing up, but properly.
*BAR:	Oh yeah.Yeah.
*ALA:	Erm   (.) that's that 
*BAR:	Well on that you could do something stars and stripesey all round there couldn't you?
*ALA:	Yeah you could.Yeah.
*BAR:	Yeah.

*BAR:	Yeah, I mean, the other thing on, on American of course, is you can do all that Cajun stuff can't you?
*ALA:	Yeah, that's, that's, yes, that's what I wanna

*BAR:	Oh.
*ALA:	I've never been interested in American stuff.Well Cajun stuff and all that I thought, and then there's them   (.) you can do some long kebabs and all that, that's why if we get one of them charcoal grills that you can   (.) pa shoo,shee shoo .You know, not er   (.) all easy.And, and if you're gonna do burgers we'll do   (.) proper burgers, you know   (.) not   (.)  (        ) .But you can do like, you can do vegetarian burgers and all sorts.So erm   (.) is that paper up there?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Look erm   (.) could do with being  (        ) , having a doorway across back of here couldn't they?Oh!I don't know though   (.) bu er, opening and shutting doors don't appeal to me   (.) when you  (        ) .
*BAR:	No.No.True.
*ALA:	Looks nice but
*BAR:	Yeah I mean this looks   (.) almost like a school   (.) but I mean
*ALA:	Well, no, well, I thi but I think some, some   (.) you're better with two shelves really.In, in a way for for quick, quick 
*BAR:	Well nowadays, nowadays everybody wants two drinks anyway don't 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	they?I mean it's not like 
*ALA:	No, but, but 
*BAR:	it used to be a
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	everybody wanted warm   (        ) 
*ALA:	When you think about if you   (.) just   (.) serving two or three hundred   (        ) to keep opening and shutting bloody cupboard doors, erm, fridge doors, it's no good.Chill's best, I think anyway.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	So erm   (.) so, yeah, right, I've got   (.) oh! (        ) 
*BAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALA:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	Yeah, I thi yeah I think you're right actually.You need to get rid of that and it's   (.) and create a dance floor
*ALA:	Yeah, create 
*BAR:	what, and what I'd do is I'd put a few more spots in
*ALA:	Yes.
*BAR:	no, those spots around 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	there shining on the 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	floor, put some round the back so 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you actually just use
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	see, but I er, I think creative use of spotlights is better   (.) than, than specialized lighting effects, which A, cost a fortune, but B 
*ALA:	And you get out of 
*BAR:	as soon as you've seen them they're out of date.
*ALA:	Well that's it.That's right.
*BAR:	Cos they're only effective one time, that's the first time you see them.
*ALA:	 (        ) , yeah.
*BAR:	After that, it's
*ALA:	And we don't want to fork, I mean, (        ) 
*BAR:	No.No.So erm   (.) I mean you can just use coloured spots it in, I mean, those at the moment are just literally stage spots, all they are i are on, and on dim 
*ALA:	Oh right.Yeah.
*BAR:	then you can dim them up or whatever 
*ALA:	Yeah, I have them
*BAR:	but they can't flash
*ALA:	No.
*BAR:	so what we need is a small unit in there and, and, I mean, it's only   (.) two or three hundred quid   (.) er, and a few erm
*ALA:	Most places where erm, you know they've got them in that, where you go to
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	you can pick stuff up for next to nowt.Just have it ready- made, say you want it for
*BAR:	Yeah.Well, marvellous!
*ALA:	But I think er   (.) er   (.) yeah I think that's definite, take that out, it really, it really would make   (.) the difference to erm
*BAR:	Yeah it would, actually, thinking about it.
*ALA:	Would, it'd make it   (.) it'd make it   (.) well, it'd just transform it, I mean, just no two ways about it, I think.You've got that erm   (.) what time's that chap coming, half past three?
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Well I think er   (.) is this, alright if I look in here or 
*BAR:	Yeah, course.
*ALA:	I'll just get my erm
*BAR:	Yeah, I mean i it's   (.) keep on walking round till you get familiar with it.

*ALA:	Oh!You can't be doing with that.
*BAR:	I mean   (.) but okay, well all it means is, you get twen yo once you start getting busy you get twenty twos not elevens.I mean
*ALA:	And thirty sixes eventually  (        ) .
*BAR:	And thirty sixes that's right.
*ALA:	Yeah.

*BAR:	That's right.
*ALA:	Then er   (.) which is nice,i it   (.) forty's lovely!Forty's absolutely lovely to do.And that, and that's it, but I mean, to do, to have somewhere to do two hundred like this would be absolutely incredible!Could always do small weddings down there and, and then the big do 
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	at night up here. (.) That'd make   (.) that just totally makes it different.I want to just go and have a look in them   (.) you see if you've   (.) well anyway    (        )  (.) Well erm, I might get   (        ) to a certain extent.Cos you're nearly

*ALA:	Brilliant!
*BAR:	No messing!
*ALA:	Right, depends what the   (.) and quite honestly, if you bring these down   (.) and make them a bit more romantic

*BAR:	there.
*ALA:	O as it is?
*BAR:	Yeah.As it is.
*ALA:	Yeah.Packed out. (.)  [sighing] Er  [] 
*BAR:	But you see the other thing, the other thing that er that's worth, when you've had the smaller dos, you know 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	sort of even, even like sixty, eighty people   (.) you can lay one of these raised areas out as the big cold buffet area 
*ALA:	Oh the buffet, yeah.Yeah.
*BAR:	which kills a lot 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	of space in the club.
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	The only thing that worries me about taking that out is that you then create a massive   (.) empty space, if you have got 
*ALA:	No you don't.
*BAR:	sixty, seventy people you have to then
*ALA:	No you don't because what you do is, you do it down there.
*BAR:	Well
*ALA:	And this is off
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	innit?
*BAR:	Yeah.Then you go back and sit up there.
*ALA:	That's it.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*ALA:	Yeah.You do it down there, and this is erm   (.) if you did it over there it would look absolutely dreadful!You do it down there, you set it up in the middle and you set it up really nice and cosy.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	And then er
*BAR:	We got a lot, we got a, quite a lot of these little blue tables so you could actually
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	surround the dance floors 
*ALA:	Oh yes.No, no 
*BAR:	but we
*ALA:	messing.
*BAR:	push, you know, push people into the dance floor so they're there anyway.
*ALA:	Yeah, and you make a totally, you make a totally different erm   (.) it's, it   (.) in one sort of minor operation if you like, alright, minor to a 
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	certain extent, you've totally transformed it Barry.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	And it, it 
*BAR:	That's right.
*ALA:	definitely looks so different.I mean, even if you didn't do anything else.
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	But I think erm, you've just got to er, we've just got to er   (.) gerrit sorted.It, it, it int gonna take much sorting   (.) and get the   (.) you know
*BAR:	Mm.We could use that chrome railing around
*ALA:	Well you co 
*BAR:	area 
*ALA:	yeah you could use that chrome railing elsewhere, we could 
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	you know.I don't think you, you've, you've got to try in a way not to shut it off   (.) too much   (.) erm   (.) and yet it,i you've just got to sort of be able to   (.) not shut it off but sort of create different areas
*BAR:	Mm.
*ALA:	within one big area   (.) i i if you can and I think shutting things, I think putting trellising up to, not trellising but   (.) that sort of thing, to a certain extent at the minute   (.) we don't need and   (.) I think   (.) I'll have to come a time er too when it's open as well to get
*BAR:	Now,wha what I was just thinking of
*ALA:	Yes.But it could be just on a Saturday and Sun 
*BAR:	is it, if you, if you're using, if you're gonna use it as a pub as well 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	on a Saturday and a Sunday 
*ALA:	Mm.
*BAR:	which I think you can do with Amer certainly in the summer season   (.) if you Americanize it and all that and, and just, well I mean, we, we did 
*ALA:	You could have a glorious MacDonalds couldn't you?
*BAR:	Yeah.That's right.Then, you know   (.) you wanna start from that and build back out bits 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you know 
*ALA:	Definitely 
*BAR:	cos I mean if they walked into here on stood on that bar hundred and twenty people 
*ALA:	Well actually you don't want them, you want them in here and bar's there.
*BAR:	Well that's right.
*ALA:	And that's the bar they use.
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.That's right.
*ALA:	You don't sort of use
*BAR:	No we have that closed and
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and try and sort 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	of shutter it off in some 
*ALA:	Yeah.
*BAR:	way.I mean maybe 
*ALA:	Well I think 
*BAR:	maybe even getting   (.) literally shutters rather than those grills.And then you can 
*ALA:	No, I think, I think, I think
