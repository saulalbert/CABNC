*HAZ:	speaking alternately. •401866_402376•
*ZAR:	they're they're speaking alternately and er, it was  •402386_404646•

*UNK:	Yeah. •630676_630866•
        Hi! •630976_631096•
*GRA:	Oh, it's a •631096_632606•
*HAZ:	 (        ) 
*GRA:	just trying to sort out this business of this  the offices  that we're being let in the Strand Theatre that er  people are moving in this week and they've got no authority to move you see. •633206_646246•
*ANN:	Really? •646246_646676•
*GRA:	This is what , I spoke to Nigel about on the phone on Friday and said he could  •646756_649356•
*ANN:	Yeah. •649616_649716•
*GRA:	stop it, so  so he had to erm  just talk to our solicitors this morning and try and get this sorted out  between the two solicitors. •649716_659126•
*ANN:	Did you get through to him? •659126_660306•
*GRA:	Yes, yes, got through. •660306_661146•
        Well not David it's a er, Susan   got  •661366_663410•
*ANN:	Mm. •663770_663890•
*GRA:	Susan. •663980_664160•
*ZAR:	Have you read it now cos I shall have to  •664160_665980•
*UNK:	Hello! •665980_666100•
*GRA:	So erm  •666100_666370•
*ZAR:	take it back? •666370_666700•
        I can't do it, can you do these •666700_667620•
*UNK:	How have you been, alright? •667620_668290•
*HAZ:	That a bathroom cabinet up there? •668320_669860•
*ZAR:	 (        ) 
*GRA:	so they're, you know, explain the situation to her because it's between the two solicitors to sort out now and get the writ, writ sorted out before  anything could be signed to  to allow them to  move in. •669860_681050•
*ANN:	Yeah. •681880_682010•
*GRA:	It's a tricky situation actually because •682010_684820•
*ANN:	Well what do you say the  •687200_688210•
*GRA:	the lease  •688210_688390•
*ANN:	the ? •688390_688730•
*GRA:	well the, the people who have the actual lease of the offices  have gone out er  gone out of business in a sense, they're no longer operating  and  because, they were part of a bigger organization, that bigger organization guaranteed the rents. •688760_705920•
        Now this bigger , this other organization which  wants to put er  another tenant in as in a, as a sub-let to their lease •706770_716750•
*ANN:	Yeah. •717140_717300•
*GRA:	and, I am saying that  they haven't got the lease •718530_724240•
*ANN:	Yeah. •724240_724690•
*GRA:	even though they might be part and parcel of the same organization, they are not the leaseholders so they can't  make the arrangements, so if they want to make the arrangement they must have the lease assigned to them first, then we will come to terms with them over land and to under under let. •725860_739050•
*ANN:	Yeah. •739840_740160•
*GRA:	But, you know, they're just being  going on as if they are  in a position to grant •740480_748040•
*ANN:	To do. •748200_749140•
*GRA:	to do! •749140_749720•
        And, having said that we haven't, at this moment, approved an under-let anyway, so •749720_754110•
*ANN:	No. •754110_754540•
*GRA:	But, you know, the situation is difficult in that  if the  people did move in there's  not a lot you can do about it because  it would mean that  you would have to surrender the lease, which means you've let  the guarantors off the hook for paying the then  and you're left without a tenant whatsoever. •755990_780460•
        Erm it's, it's trying to get an amicable solution to it. •780460_785170•
*ANN:	Yeah. •790660_791400•
*GRA:	Oh. •791520_791810•
*ANN:	Darling, will you get me a  a scone, another scone  teacake  •792300_799200•
*GRA:	Teacake. •799300_799540•
        Aha. •799830_800480•
*ANN:	and erm  and a  coffee. •800480_802400•

*ANN:	Can you er pay, pay  •819420_843890•

        Yes, yes  •910620_910770•
*HAZ:	Anything  •911170_911260•
*GRA:	yes. •911570_911660•
*HAZ:	exciting at the office? •911660_912600•
        No! •912600_912700•
*GRA:	Oh well, yes. •912700_914690•
*ANN:	Well lots of mail. •914690_915430•
*HAZ:	Lots of mail? •915430_916420•
*GRA:	Lots of mail. •916500_917160•
        An interesting situation which I've just explained to Ann, whereby at the weekend  there's a set of offices in the Strand Theatre which  the company that we're operating from there stopped  •917160_931580•
*HAZ:	Can you manage? •931830_932360•
*GRA:	business •932360_932520•
*UNK:	Yeah. •932560_932800•
*GRA:	but they're part of a much bigger organization who  •932950_934300•
*HAZ:	Mm. •934300_934920•
*GRA:	was guaranteeing the rent, so the rent  has been paid even  •934950_937430•
*HAZ:	Paid. •937430_937790•
*GRA:	though the office  •937790_938130•
*HAZ:	Yeah. •938130_938290•
*GRA:	has been vacated  and they wanted to grant an under-let to another •938290_941420•
*HAZ:	Yeah. •941420_941640•
*GRA:	body of people to try and reduce the rent they were paying  erm  but it, it's er, it's initially a difficult situation that we have said yes we don't mind you  erm  we don't mind granting you that, but  we want to know  if you will accept an assignment of the lease  from the previous company cos  •941870_963700•
*HAZ:	Mm. •963700_964140•
*GRA:	from our point of view  in nineteen ninety three, we have to deal with somebody over a revision of the rent  and if the company doesn't exist  it makes it very difficult! •964220_973990•
*HAZ:	Yeah! •973990_974080•
        Yeah. •974080_974340•
        Quite! •974340_974760•
        Yeah. •974760_975070•
*GRA:	You see, so  these people were going to move in at the weekend so had to put a stop to that cos they had no authority to move in there  until the solicitors try and get this thing sorted out. •975160_984260•
*HAZ:	I wonder what they'll do? •984320_985690•
*GRA:	But it , it's a  it leaves you this interesting situation in that  if  they had moved in  what do you do, cancel the lease and get them out? •985690_995590•
        Which means the guarantor no longer has to pay you the rent so you  you don't really want to forego that either, yeah. •996390_100169•
*HAZ:	So you really, bit of a clever stick aren't you? •100169_100624•
*GRA:	Yes. •100624_100631•
*HAZ:	Yeah. •100632_100633•
        Very, very . •100633_100672•

*HAZ:	It'll come out in the wash I guess! •100805_101115•
