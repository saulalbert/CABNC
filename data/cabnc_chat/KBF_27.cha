*JEA:	Mm. •257666_257672•

*JEA:	Do you know Dave  I read erm  there's a magazine called Good Housekeeping  and it's been going for  it had been going for seventy years, last year it started in nineteen twenty one, women's magazine, very good one  and they had a sort of seventieth birthday issue •261552_263116•
*BRE:	Do you want a cup of tea now? •263141_263226•
*JEA:	and  one woman said that the year, nineteen twenty one  she was a bride of eighteen years old and she took Good Housekeeping and she's got the whole lot  although she's now a very old lady, and she said  my first lot of housekeeping was done in a  house in Wales where we had water from the well  we had to  build the fires up by hand  we could get Welsh coal cheaply  but they had to  you know  use paper and kindle  and we swept with brooms and my life has never been easier  she said I had three children in four years and my life has never been easier  she said and all these modern things came in  life has  got more and more complicated and difficult ! •263270_267890•

*DAV:	Yeah. •273239_273251•
*JEA:	and one boy chose to write about plumbing  and do you know, he found that there was nothing written down about plumbing  in the early nineteen seventies  there were one or two plumbing text books, they were very expensive and you could only get them through The Institute of Plumbers  plumbing is something that until about nineteen seventy five  was passed from father to son or uncle to nephew  it was a sort of secret craft  you know, you can  •273356_276151•
