*HEL:	What you gonna do?Ask her for it    (.)  ((laugh)) I am, she's alright, she's
*UNK:	In very small doses
*HEL:	Yeah, she's always been alright with me, you know, so I can't say about anybody else, I mean she's already, she's always been really nice to me, but   (.) like them people she goes around, well she used to go around with Lisa  and Vicky and all that lot and when she used to go around with them she used to be bitching them off behind their back and going oh you're my best friend, to their faces.
*UNK:	 (        )

*HEL:	No
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	I mean she's a, she's a nice enough person but she just gets in a strop so easily, you, you know
*UNK:	Maybe she needs to grow up a bit more
*HEL:	Yeah probably   (.) I think she'll always be like it though, cos her mum's just the same, she's just like her mum, you know   (.) her mum got in a strop every day because she couldn't go round, down the
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	club and have a fag, her mum's given up smoking, so Joanne's really worried now   ((laugh)) oh  (.)
