@Comment:	conversation #11 (Tape 040804)
*FRA:	Well they seem quite tempted.
*STE:	I can't remember what their names were, did you get their names again?
*FRA:	No I didn't.I know it was Princetown T V but
*STE:	Yeah.
*FRA:	Probably serve the prison I should think. (.) Well I must remember to memorize this this time. (.) Lovely tube on this innit?
*STE:	They're pretty good sets aren't they?Yeah.
*FRA:	I should think it must be that one there or    (.)  ((snooker on the telly))James Wattana  (.) 
*STE:	Fancy living here in preference to   (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah!He must be doing very well over here.Very delicate. (.) Don't suppose he's   (        ) in his part time.
*STE:	No. (.) 
*FRA:	Cor he is good, there's no doubt about that, look at that, right between the two.Whoops
*STE:	Ooh!
*FRA:	oh dear. (.) Cor  (        ) 
*STE:	Mm. (.) 
*FRA:	Excellent. (.) I know Jackie  said well you shouldn't, you should try the Toshibas they're as good as gold those are. (.) 
*STE:	Telling the truth there. (.) 
*FRA:	It's er Hitachis are the ones he didn't er rate at all.
*STE:	Oh yeah? (        ) Hitachi as well I think.That's a duffer innit?
*FRA:	 [laughing] Yeah  [] 
*STE:	Still if we move them on   (.) fifty five quid I reckon   (        ) nice set that'll tempt somebody.
*FRA:	Yeah.
*STE:	Or we could buy another one   (        ) then don't we?
*FRA:	Yeah. (.) Right   (.) Oh that's right, that's what I ordered off Eddy today, two S D seventeen ten.
*STE:	Yeah.
*FRA:	That one.
*STE:	Quite a good set.
*FRA:	Mm. (.) No I think I can probably make t one out of two of those.
*STE:	Well we'll get three of them, that price.
*FRA:	Getting these done aren't we, gradually?
*STE:	Yeah   (        ) 
*FRA:	The non-working stuff.
*STE:	it helps dunnit?
*FRA:	Yeah.
*STE:	I mean some of these you ain't even looked at, the Panasonic and things like that, it might be
*FRA:	Yeah
*STE:	something simple.
*FRA:	it's a bit long in the tooth that one.Still it's worth a look probably.
*STE:	It's thirty quid innit, to somebody like Jack ?
*FRA:	Yeah.Looked at the Sony   (.) that needs erm    (.)  (        ) 
*STE:	Er a tuning fault or something innit?
*FRA:	Yeah it's just got erm   (.) blank   (        ) in it. (.) That's another Hitachi isn't it down there the same as we've got over there? (.) 
*STE:	Oh yeah. (.) F S T Tosh there as well.Shouldn't be too serious should it?
*FRA:	We haven't looked at that have we, that one?I'm not sure.
*STE:	Don't know. (.) 
*FRA:	Or is that the one that has got the burnt out bits in it? (.) 
*STE:	But I can clear these out for ninety quid apiece I think I'd move them just to get rid of them don't you?
*FRA:	Yeah.Yeah. (.) He lives in Bradford, my goodness what a choice. (.) James Wattana 
*STE:	In Bradford now is he?
*FRA:	Yeah. (.) Must like the food up there I should think. (.) Ah that was a brave shot.
*STE:	Well    (        )  (.) they don't have a   (.) test signal then. (.) 
*FRA:	Mm.Seems to have a bit of a  (        ) 
*STE:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Tried a tape in it?
*STE:	No. (.) 
*FRA:	Just for a joke.
*STE:	Just sending out a pulse on them    (.)  (        ) stopped there.
*FRA:	You can always   (        ) the tape     (.)  (        )  (.) It's actually running. (.) That mains lead in front of you   (.) wants plugging in.
*STE:	Ah. (.) Ah right.Stop, stop, stop
*FRA:	Mm. (.) I really should er phone Breezy up and call his bluff and find out  (.) 
*STE:	Which of these is   (        ) tuner?
*FRA:	That's it. (.) Yeah you run the tape don't you to tune these in.Run it without a tape I think it is to get the test signal.Still 
*STE:	Oh is it?
*FRA:	you'll find it that way anyway won't you? (.) 
*STE:	Should go all the way up and then back down shouldn't it? (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah they do no they do go round. (.) Pretty sure they do anyway, (        )  (.) Blinking slow innit that direction?Or is it blinks fast in the other direction?
*STE:	Oh I see.Ah.
*FRA:	One of them is a fast tune.That's it, that's fast tune. (.)
