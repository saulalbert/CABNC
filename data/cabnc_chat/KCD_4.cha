*UNK:	Well it says jeans and a jumper or trousers and a jumper.I mean it it well no it says thick trousers and a warm cardigan or a jumper.Erm I mean I should think you want to take some shorts in case it's warm do you.
*CLA:	Yeah.
*HEL:	You going to take your white trousers?Your new white ones?
*CLA:	 (        ) 
*HEL:	Are you going to wear those at the disco?
*CLA:	Yes.
*HEL:	Rather than your black ones?
*CLA:	Yes. (.) 
*HEL:	I thought you could probably take both.I don't think it's been very erm generous with out of school wear but you can change when you get back.I think you'd better take your Scots Park jumper and your red cardigan in case you manage to spill
*CLA:	yes
*HEL:	all your dinner down your Scotch Park jumper or something
*CLA:	Yeah
*HEL:	because you haven't got two.
