@Comment:	conversation #7 (Tape 018207)
*ANN:	And if we make an appointment to view some places and then we'll know what time we've got to doing the shopping and fit it in round taking mum.Seeing mum.
*STU:	 (        ) something erm next week.
*ANN:	So you don't fancy this afternoon?
*STU:	In the morning.Oh yeah well   (.) yeah I mean if if they if 
*ANN:	Cos as I say if we did see Sefton Avenue or New Drove today.
*STU:	If there's nothing available.That's what I meant.
*ANN:	Oh yeah, there's plenty of time. (.) I don't really want to go on a Saturday. (        ) Saturday afternoons with mum. (.) 
*STU:	 (        ) Saturday afternoons with Helen.
*ANN:	 (        ) well I wouldn't be absolutely   (.) if, if I had to go out then I'd have to go out. (.) Then there's always Saturday morning   (        ) see Helen but then Stuart likes to sleep in. ((laugh)) But no I think Saturday's out really.It's not a day for viewing houses. (.) We could go out Sunday?And mum could come as well.
*STU:	I don't know whether they work   (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) Oh yes.People at work all the week don't they?
*STU:	Yes.
*ANN:	Gets dark in the evenings then then then   (.) definitely.That's the only time you can view a property.I mean unless somebody's living in it you can't go in the evenings in the winter can you?And I don't   (.) fancy a house that somebody's actually living in.Cos then you've got ta wait while they
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	And it can all fall through because theirs is falling through or they can't get out when you want and   (.) that can go on for   (.) Can it not?
*STU:	Yeah. (.) 
*ANN:	Sometimes it just can't be helped cos there's nothing   (.) in your price range you know that you like that   (.) isn't empty but   (.) I would prefer   (.) an empty property so that when we decide and then whatever just  (        ) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Certainly if we'd see something that would do this afternoon, or   (        ) New Drove   (        ) today, that's fine.
*STU:	No problem. (.) 
*ANN:	Two of them at New Drove are downstairs and one is an upstairs.The one upstairs, because it hasn't got a bay window
*STU:	Yes.
*ANN:	is larger. (.) The upstairs one is slightly larger.
*STU:	The upstairs one's larger? (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) number seven which is an upstairs one   (.) hasn't got any bay windows.It is   (.) larger than the two five and six that are downstairs.
*STU:	Who's selling that one?
*ANN:	Well one's Cornerstone.One's Cornerstone 
*STU:	So one's Cornerstone and two are the other  (        ) 
*ANN:	Two are Hansard 
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I think it's Cornerstone one that's   (.) the larger of the two, the three. (.) Six   (.) seven.Hansard.
*STU:	Hansard.
*ANN:	They're doing five and seven so they've got one above each other.
*STU:	So they've got   (.) one   (.) one's doing two and one's doing one.
*ANN:	One's doing five and seven which is   (.) this is for two and one's doing six which is this one.
*STU:	Yeah. (.) 
*ANN:	Seven is definitely slightly bigger than six and five. (.) I checked it out.The lounge is fourteen by ten. (.) The bedroom is thirteen nine by nine   (        ) instead of eleven by eight. (.) That kitchen's thirteen by five, that totals eleven by seven.
*STU:	Neither here nor there is it?
*ANN:	No.None of it's much difference.It's only a diff er it's a matter of two feet here and
*STU:	Yes.
*ANN:	But then I don't mind  (        ) .I don't mind living upstairs or on the ground.Well I mean if they've got the key to both might   (.) haven't decided on both of them you might as well go and see them.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Both of them.See which one you like the best or if you like them at all. (.) But as it's   (.) got that financial package
*STU:	That's Cornerstone?
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Don't know whether the same applies to the other two.
*ANN:	 (        ) it.The financial package  (        ) .
*STU:	With Cornerstone?
*ANN:	 (        ) Cornerstone.
*STU:	Doesn't actually say that in   (.) Pantiles 
*ANN:	No
*STU:	Oh.Just have to ask  (        ) .
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	But actually the one at Cornerstone is fifty pound cheaper than the both of them at Hansard.
*STU:	 ((laugh)) 
*ANN:	It is!
*STU:	Fifty pound.
*ANN:	One's nine nine fifty and one's nine nine
*STU:	 (        ) five, yeah.
*ANN:	So it's forty five pound different. ((laugh))  (        ) 
*STU:	Well that's a good way, if you think about it he's got, he's got four flats there   (.) hasn't he?
*ANN:	Oh yeah.
*STU:	Four flats at thirty thousand.That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses.They could be sixty thousand apiece.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	Whereas if he had, if he sold them as separate houses he'd probably get forty thousand apiece.
*ANN:	Yeah that's just   (        ) Yeah.
*STU:	Forty five thousand even apiece.
*ANN:	Yeah.
*STU:	But he's making the money by selling them as flats.
*ANN:	Yeah.The only difference is he's had a few thousand extra because it's got two kitchens and two bathrooms. (        ) partitions and 
*STU:	Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings.
*ANN:	But apart from that oh an extra bath instead of the other bedroom
*STU:	Yeah.Yeah.
*ANN:	and erm another kitchen instead of a dining room or something and that's the only difference.Say three four thousand probably.For the extra bits and pieces that's all.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	I don't know how many of them there are. (.) Whether they only had four flats or whether there's a   (.) flat on another block and another block of fours down the road.I mean I don't know.
*STU:	Only assume there's   (.) you've got that one block.
*ANN:	Well there might be   (.) four blocks of four or   (.) I du n no.
*STU:	No I don't think so.Not enough space for them.
*ANN:	No I don't know.I mean you know the area better than me.
*STU:	Unless they've knocked them garages down or something  (        ) 
*ANN:	I've no idea  (        ) .I know them council houses aren't usually   (        ) but I mean I can't visualize how much land there is. (.) I only know that by going to school and   (.)  (        ) 
*STU:	Yeah. (.) 
*ANN:	 (        ) where they are. (.)  (        ) 
*STU:	Yeah. (.) 
*ANN:	Probably should have gone the other way into town but
*STU:	 (        ) that
*ANN:	Eh?
*STU:	Neither here nor there. (        ) 
*ANN:	Well you could have gone sort of like round the Rainbow and   (.) that way on.That's what I meant.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	 (        ) the bypass   (        ) that end of town   (.) would have been perhaps a little bit clearer.
*STU:	 (        ) If you look at the first it might help you to decide whether you like 
*ANN:	That's it.Whether you wanna go and see it.
*STU:	Whether you wanna go and see them or not.Whether you like the positions.
*ANN:	I mean we know where Sefton Avenue is and we know that's
*STU:	Well we know where it is.
*ANN:	a nice house. ((laugh)) 
*STU:	Well we don't know really.We haven't seen it have we?
*ANN:	Well I mean   (        ) I mean 
*STU:	Yeah but we haven't actually looked ins 
*ANN:	No but I mean I know which house it is with that   (        ) one, and you do don't you?
*STU:	I think so yes.
*ANN:	Well I think so as well.
*STU:	But it would be nice just to go and have a quick   (.) check.
*ANN:	Oh I think, just to make sure that   (        ) 
*STU:	Just to make sure I like it.Or 
*ANN:	it is the house that we're thinking about.We think it is.
*STU:	You may not like it.
*ANN:	I said as soon as I see it in the paper oh that looks nice.Where's that?I mean   (.) not sure.
*STU:	 (        ) is it?Or is this the one round the other end?
*ANN:	It's that one.
*STU:	It's up here.That one there right on the corner yeah?
*ANN:	Yes.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	That's it.
*STU:	I thought there was a separate   (        ) but it's not, no it's not is it?
*ANN:	Think it is.
*STU:	It's an older property.Got the double glazing. (.) Alright.
*ANN:	 (        )  (.) Looks nice.Nice house though isn't it?
*STU:	Yeah it's an older, more solid house.
*ANN:	You know sometimes I like as I say they've got 
*STU:	Yeah.Yeah Yeah true.Very true.
*ANN:	they've got erm
*STU:	Very true.
*ANN:	Yeah it's a nice house. (.) 
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	And this is a back, the back door  (        ) 
*STU:	Oh I see.Yeah.
*ANN:	this one because you, there's the back view look I mean that's   (.) that's a back door isn't it?So you have the downstairs back and the the front stairs go up to the   (.) can't actually see    (        )  (.) That's definitely the back door.
*STU:	There's a parking space as well.
*ANN:	Oh yeah it says allotted parking space. (.)
