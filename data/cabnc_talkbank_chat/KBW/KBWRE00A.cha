*PS08A:	Mm .  424943_425193

*PS08A:	Mm .  435963_435993
*PS087:	I do n't know how long it 's going to go on for or what it is exactly but I thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see .  435993_440753
*PS08A:	Mm .  443683_443783
*PS087:	But at least things have moved and at least they 've gone round So I 'm pleased really are you Interesting that they 've done it so quickly is n't it After seeing him because he thought that once he 'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started but they must have got themselves over that .  443783_465593
*PS08A:	Yeah Well I mean everyone .  468503_471593
*PS087:	Yeah .  471593_471623

*PS08A:	I know they do .  490873_491233
*PS087:	We could can prime them up on what to say and types of things to talk about so they do n't get moaned down or something Bogged down .  494303_508323
*PS08A:	So he 's had to go in what did you say Three times a week .  508323_511223
