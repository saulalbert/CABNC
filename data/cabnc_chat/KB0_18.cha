*ALA:	Yes for the, you know printing the leaflet  •579825_602725•
*MAR:	How much notice do you require? •623525_686425•
*ALA:	 (        )  (.) 
*JOH:	How quickly do they do it? •717225_729125•
*ALA:	The same day. •732625_744925•
*MAR:	Ah. •747025_747325•
*JOH:	Only, I could take it to work, you know, •747625_763625•
*MAR:	Mm. •779825_783425•
        Er now then  bring it on Friday and show it to to Granville. •787925_865225•
*JOH:	I'll  I'll get another copy. •875325_887725•
        I'll leave that with Kenneth for now •890125_901225•
*MAR:	Mm. •901925_903825•
*JOH:	and I'll bring one on Friday with me. •903825_918025•
        I did ask, I did mention it to Granville on Saturday. •921425_942025•
*MAR:	Aha. •948625_952525•
*JOH:	Because, you know, he said what it was gonna cost him in the future. •953825_982425•
        So if we can save some cost •991025_100292•
*MAR:	Mm. •100742_101062•
*JOH:	But it's  once you get more than twenty copies  •101112_105432•
*MAR:	Yes. •107222_107482•
*JOH:	and that  makes the copying quite reasonable. •107482_109202•
*ALA:	Oh I see, it's not an ordinary photocopier? •109372_112682•
        It, it  •112682_113032•
*JOH:	Oh yeah. •113032_113272•
        But they've got two. •113772_114742•
        This one's called an, an offset •114742_116292•
*ALA:	Mm. •116592_116952•
*JOH:	printer. •116952_117232•
        you've got an ordinary photocopier and an offset. •117902_119442•
        The ordinary photocopier works out a bit more expensive. •120462_122742•
*ALA:	Mm. •123102_123542•
*JOH:	But you see, using the offset   that case I don't know what's   •123542_127292•
*MAR:	Well he'll generally want about seventy copies. •127362_129792•
*JOH:	Yeah. •129792_129872•
        In that way it works out much better. •129872_131042•
*MAR:	Mm. •131692_131922•
*JOH:	Because there's an example there, you know, hundred  two hundred, whatever you want. •132392_135822•
        There's an example there. •135822_137912•
*MAR:	Mm. •137912_137972•
*JOH:	Like, I just  really that  we could reduce the scale of costing. •138982_143032•
        A little bit. •143642_144032•
*MAR:	Well why not? •144382_144832•
*JOH:	You know? •145052_145362•
        It's gonna help my school and it will help us as well. •146962_148862•
        It will do two things won't it? •149612_151302•
*ALA:	Oh it's the school does it? •151382_152502•
*JOH:	It's the school does it. •152722_153332•
        Erm because we've got a printing system for the school  they're, they're now letting out their printing services to others in the community. •153872_160172•
*ALA:	Mm. •161512_161902•
*JOH:	Erm  so if you like it's, it's officially done because therefore they're advertising it  in our last newsletter we send to every parent •162252_168692•
*MAR:	Mm. •169372_169682•
*JOH:	this advert went on the back of it. •169682_170872•
        So if anybody locally wanted . •171522_173262•
        So basically all I would have to do is take them with me and  I'd bring them home on the same day. •174012_184752•
*MAR:	Mm. •184752_184832•
*JOH:	So it's done there and then. •184832_187322•
*ALA:	Apart from that I've got all the information we want here  •188392_192262•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	Certainly you can. •192292_193492•
*UNK:	We have an open door. •198872_200662•
*PHI:	Well yes. •200662_200992•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	the  the whole of the  •201772_203282•
*JOH:	I thought  but I thought it was erm  I mean you haven't •204342_207582•
*ALA:	Er no it's, it's  no we haven't had two sides  •207582_210372•
*JOH:	If you have two sides it'll be quite a few won't it? •211392_214252•
        And sixty copies will be three pound. •214252_219372•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	Cos some of these places  in town, people have to charge you VAT as well don't they? •219732_224402•
        Which is  •224402_224562•
*ALA:	Oh yes, yes. •224842_225302•
*JOH:	what pushes  well if you go to somebody it pushes the cost up doesn't it? •225302_228742•
*MAR:	Mm. •229062_229742•
*ALA:	And a lot of the commercial ones charge you about ten pence a •230702_233282•
*JOH:	Oh some of them charge you ten plus VAT don't they? •233362_235152•
*ALA:	Mm. •235242_235502•
*JOH:	Which is what adds it up you know, really. •236102_237492•
        So it would •237812_238222•
*MAR:	Well  run out now because I've got all the information I want. •238942_242652•

*MAR:	Oh yes. •274842_275492•
*JOH:	Erm they've  there's all the different amount of things you've gotta learn  I mean  it's even different from a  from a computer isn't it? •275492_284332•
        You know it's  •284332_284872•
*ALA:	And a computer you've got a spellchecker. •286302_289242•
*JOH:	Well she's got a spellchecker on this one. •289242_291122•

*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	It's what? •295272_295572•
*JOH:	it's got one small letter and two capitals. •295602_297642•
*MAR:	? •_•
*JOH:	No. •300102_300252•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	Oh it's a, it's a, it's a good one. •300282_302392•
        We bought it from Smith's on Saturday, it's a Brother. •302392_305472•
        But they were making an offer, if you brought your old machine in they'd offer you thirty pound off. •305882_311512•
        So we thought we may as well take it. •311662_316472•
*ALA:	Mm. •319212_319632•
        Yes I  I've been busy today. •321012_323532•

*JOH:	Oh. •328322_328542•
*ALA:	 ((laugh))  (.) 
*MAR:	Well I've got er an electric typewriter. •331902_333862•
        Originally my son had it and he went over to a printer. •334152_338892•
*ALA:	Mm. •340522_340742•
*JOH:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	A computer and a printer, mm. •341172_342732•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	A wordprocessor? •344382_345812•
*MAR:	A wordprocessor, yeah  •348872_349692•
*ALA:	Mm. •352492_352782•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	You see the beauty of  the beauty of the  computer or wordprocessor compared to an electronic typewriter is you can finish your document and then do your spellcheck. •356602_366372•
*MAR:	Yes. •366782_367032•
*ALA:	Whereas with the electronic typewriter you've got to do it er  •367162_369662•
*MAR:	Oh yeah. •369662_370002•
        Yes . •370322_370592•
        It's really a better, faster ordinary typewriter in a way. •371402_374572•
*ALA:	Mm. •374632_374862•
*MAR:	. •_•
        Otherwise they're pretty well the same as an ordinary typewriter. •376092_387982•
        But er with a wordprocessor of course you can alter things. •387982_394062•
*ALA:	Mm. •394862_395032•
*MAR:	You can er  •395232_395912•
*ALA:	Mm. •401402_401562•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	And of course you can shift er  a block. •402552_406642•
        Move it that way or some sort of thing. •407162_410162•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Do you take sugar Alan? •410162_414582•
*ALA:	No I don't, thanks. •414652_415392•
        Yes this was really rather extravagant getting this new one, it was an  •416862_427212•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	Does anybody want to buy an Amstrad? •429712_432072•
*JOH:	Are you giving it away? •433032_438672•
*ALA:	Selling it. •439992_441492•
*JOH:	Oh yes I know that. •441492_443752•

*ALA:	Who else are we expecting? •454822_460702•
        Erm •465052_465132•
*JOH:	I think it's just Maria  •465302_467682•
*ALA:	I think it's only Maria not represented isn't it? •472112_478182•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	I wonder if  •478182_480652•
