*PS101:	going to teachers staffed The more you educate your teachers the more they 're going towards I 'm not saying if there 's an argument against educating them .  928995_962305
*PS05X:	Do you think there is an argument for finding natural teachers as opposed to set of people to get on with the job .  962655_978425
*PS101:	How would you find them to start with .  981245_984825
*PS05X:	I do n't know .  984825_985315

*PS101:	But how do you know when you 're eighteen whatever is a natural teaching ability or merely a wish to try it .  1012375_1020475
*PS05X:	Maybe eighteen is not the right age to be recruiting teachers .  1020475_1022965
*PS101:	recruit Well how do you know you 're going to be a doctor or anything when you 're eighteen then you know you ca n't you 're teaching .  1028385_1038965
*PS05X:	No I accept it Accept that .  1040085_1041685
*PS101:	I mean it is a longer training now what it used to be standard is required I think you need a lot of knowledge especially nowadays when they 're insisting on all this national curriculum you 've got to have a very broad ability And then of course you need and you 're going to avoid chance like this and or whoever you You 've got to be educated in child development and child psychology and the emotional development of children as well as their physical and educational intellectual .  1043725_1079805
*PS05X:	Mm .  1079805_1079865
*PS101:	You 've got to have all that side of it and if you 're in teaching it 's a bit ridiculous to be in any job if you do n't know something about the history of it I mean no one 's suggesting doctors sit and learn all the theory of and the history of the development of medicine but I 'm sure that it 's important to have some knowledge of your area .  1081435_1103725
*PS05X:	Mm Yes .  1104565_1104795
*PS101:	So you would n't just push it all out and how do you discuss new educational reforms if you have n't any idea about the original previous .  1104795_1115945
*PS05X:	Yes .  1116295_1116635
*PS101:	reformat I mean you 've got to be you knowledgable about your the area in which you work so I do n't think you can just wipe out the history of education that 's irrelevant .  1116995_1128125
*PS05X:	No .  1128565_1128645
*PS101:	In fact there 's a great argument teaching teachers a lot more about the legal areas these days as a teaching Instead of just relying on your union .  1131695_1142335
*PS05X:	Yes .  1143295_1143675

*PS05X:	I did n't get round to ringing Christine last night .  1217365_1228505
*PS101:	I could n't get through to yes her number 's still engaged unless it 's been reported .  1229405_1234415
*PS05X:	Mm .  1236165_1236255
*PS101:	She might have just had it off the hook yesterday .  1236505_1245255
*PS05X:	Come on .  1245255_1245935
*PS101:	Students with O A level passes for ninety three percent of training teachers Eight out of ten graduates have a good second class honours degree It 's not such a high percentage in maths as it is Twelve and a half thousand early retirements in eighty nine .  1258115_1291545
*PS05X:	Mm .  1291545_1291645
*PS101:	Four thousand retirements through ill health doubles the number to eighty seven .  1293215_1298645
*PS05X:	Aha .  1299135_1299365
*PS101:	A good honours graduate now has a starting salary of eleven thousand five hundred why should good honours graduate teachers earn fifty percent medical medical practitioner seventy five percent less than new accountants or eighty percent less than new civil engineers .  1312065_1331065
*PS05X:	Yes it 's not they 've turned it into a total university trained job erm people have n't given award .  1334215_1344215
*PS101:	Well apparently used to be trained .  1345335_1348515
*PS05X:	No taken them they 're taken to be professionals though are n't they .  1350095_1354225
*PS101:	That would be the theory .  1354775_1355705
*PS05X:	Professionally speaking I 've never had taken that .  1355705_1367065
*PS101:	Educational is not seen as a vital part of national right that must be somebody The wages earned by unskilled workers in Germany are twice as high as those earned by teachers here .  1377105_1408305
*PS05X:	likely do n't it .  1415965_1416525
*PS101:	across the board trouble is when you get these differential spend all the interpretation on them not that you 're rewarding the good teachers but that some teachers are not worth rewarding Now if you really are a weak teacher .  1429415_1451325
*PS05X:	out .  1451355_1451725
*PS101:	Then your then your feelings perhaps do n't matter in the overall picture of the education but bearing in looking at the teachers in our school we we really do n't have a weak teacher except perhaps Mr who 's obviously not been well these last three years erm .  1451815_1474397
*PS05X:	He is weak on discipline .  1475127_1476537
*PS101:	He is very high in his guild his musical know gets a lot of work from the children and the children really like his classes .  1476687_1483837
*PS05X:	So does that mean that he is a good teacher of music he 's just not a good disciplinarian .  1484007_1488187
*PS101:	To be a teacher you 've got to have control of your children and you ca n't .  1488737_1492377
*PS05X:	Yes .  1492417_1492507
*PS101:	possible however good you are at your subject .  1492507_1494147
*PS05X:	Right right .  1494147_1495087
*PS101:	You must have control of your class sometimes if you do n't under when I say he 's a weak teacher I do n't mean he 's a bad teacher I would n't single him out I would just say he 's not a strong teacher for the reason that he 's only got part of it under his belt properly yet .  1495407_1512507
*PS05X:	Mm .  1512777_1512857
*PS101:	But you know you ca n't you might say well this teacher does n't have such good displays on her wall but then she might be ever so good at another area I mean is not a display lady she does n't have artistic creative sort of flair like say Polly did .  1514217_1533342
