@Comment:	conversation #12 (Tape 002012)File not found : 
*CHR:	I was rather irritated yesterday because I had a phone call from   •_•
*LYN:	Yes? •_•
*CHR:	And he called Gary  saying we don't have the P elevens. •_•
        And I  I said oh well that's fair enough so I dug them out and sent them to him. •_•
        And after I'd stamped and sealed the envelopes  he rang back he said I haven't got the copy VAT certs either. •_•
        I was not pleased at that! •_•
        And I, wouldn't have occurred to me to send the P elevens. •_•
*LYN:	Actually that's not true either because I sent the P elevens to Steve and Matthew  for his approval before we sent them off. •_•
*CHR:	And he sent them back again? •_•
*LYN:	Erm. •_•
        I don't know whether he sent them back. •_•
        I sent , I didn't send him the originals I sent a copy. •_•
*CHR:	Oh right. •_•
*LYN:	I doubt that he sent them back. •_•
*CHR:	Oh well, I I've sent the ones from the drawer •_•
*LYN:	Fine. •_•
*CHR:	off and said I want them back! •_•
*LYN:	Oh right. •_•
*CHR:	And he said fine. •_•
*LYN:	We haven't got copies of them . •_•
*CHR:	No. •_•
        That that, well  you know if there's a query in the next fortnight we know where they are don't we? •_•
        But I was annoyed and I thought well that's fair enough because I wasn't aware that those particular documents were required by the accountants to sort things out, but •_•
*LYN:	Why were they required? •_•
*CHR:	I don't know. •_•
        I didn't ask him but he said he required them. •_•
        But I know that copy VAT certs, the VAT certs, VAT payment return, returns that's what they're called aren't they, are required. •_•
        And so we hadn't sent them. •_•
*LYN:	Oh. •_•
*CHR:	Down to our  that is. •_•
*LYN:	Well where were they? •_•
*CHR:	Well they're here in the  drawer where they're kept. •_•
        There's there's a VAT file in there and that's where they get put. •_•
        Bit silly isn't it? •_•
        This is a unhelpful  because  it's winding that way yet it looks as if it's winding that way, doesn't it? •_•
*LYN:	What onto the spool here? •_•
*CHR:	It looks as if it's reeling on to that spool. •_•
*LYN:	Yes. •_•
        But it's reeling onto that one? •_•
*CHR:	It's not it's reeling through there. •_•
        Very confusing and the fact that they've stuck that label on there doesn't help very much either. •_•
*LYN:	No, so, when it's full you have to put another tape in, does it •_•
*CHR:	Yes. •_•
*LYN:	click or does it? •_•
*CHR:	I don't know. •_•
        I thought it would actually reversed on the first side. •_•
        Erm •_•
*LYN:	And do the other side. •_•
*CHR:	Yes and I thought it was mucking it up so I just swapped it over the way it was. •_•
        Erm we shall see. •_•
        We shall see. •_•
*LYN:	It doesn't tell you . •_•
*CHR:	Well it it tells you quite a lot, but it doesn't actually mention that bit . •_•
        I've got, I have got oodles of instructions here. •_•
