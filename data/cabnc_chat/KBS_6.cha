*UNK:	I think it's terrible the way these people ignore me she said when I made a complaint! •123385_123775•
        About the car this was. •123874_123979•

        They ignore me completely! •124184_124303•
        I think it's terrible an old woman like me! •124303_124548•
*DAD:	There's more self pity. •124614_124797•
        But she , didn't, is she gonna phone up Frank or •125083_125309•

*MUM:	And she started to say this morning, oh you're alright! •130002_130268•
        And then she changed her mind I think. •130268_130416•
        You're alright, you something and then she stopped. •130589_130775•
        And I told her once, I said I'm sick to death of hearing you say that every time I come! •130967_131339•
*DAD:	But she didn't have a lot to say about Roe's conversation? •131346_132022•

        She'd asked about dad any road, she said, course this is in the afternoon so she didn't then, only this trouble hadn't started then about no money, you see. •132435_133251•
        They Roe said he was alright  but lonely. •133312_133646•
