*ALA:	Don't let me stop people finishing their teas. •798455_800535•
*PHI:	Anybody want a second cup of tea? •801075_818755•
*ALA:	Er •818795_818895•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	There's some more tea there I think. •820075_827585•
*UNK:	I'm alright thankyou. •828025_831215•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	Can we begin? •832655_833345•
*PHI:	Yes indeed. •833465_833915•
        Sorry Alan. •833915_834275•
*ALA:	Erm I  I think the only person missing is Idris, so  I don't  •836025_841935•
*PHI:	Yes I have an apology from Idris. •842565_844305•
        He rang me up last night  to say that he is more or less confined to barracks now in the evening now that Phil is home. •844305_852485•
*ALA:	Mm. •852485_852595•
*PHI:	He can't leave her. •852595_854445•
        And he erm sends his apologies. •854445_856445•
*UNK:	Apology from Mrs , she's not too well tonight. •856505_858966•
*ALA:	Right. •859846_860206•
*UNK:	Erm Mrs erm Eileen , one of our elderlies, she's tied up with her husband who's in hospital. •860206_871200•
*ALA:	Mm. •871550_871610•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*PHI:	And Mrs  is ill as you know, Rhoda is ill. •872880_875825•
        And an apology from Merle from Salisbury Park. •876355_879355•
*ALA:	Right. •879355_879685•
        Erm  from the eighth chapter of the letter to the Romans   For we are saved by hope. •881195_896535•
        But hope that is seen is not hope. •897895_899625•
        For what a man seeth, why does he yet hope for? •900945_904255•
        But if we hope for that we see not  then do we with patience wait for it. •906205_911425•
        Likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities. •913255_916245•
        For we know not to what we should pray for as we ought. •917265_920485•
        But the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. •921675_926965•
        And he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god. •928625_937515•
        And we know that in all things god works for good for them that love him. •939155_944505•
        To them who are called according to his purpose . •945205_948245•
        Let us pray. •949235_949725•
        Father we pray  that you will work for good with us. •956005_961775•
        Help us as we look to the future. •963815_966685•
        May we be guided by your spirit. •968655_970645•
        May your spirit guide our prayers and our thoughts  and our hopes. •972955_977385•
        And father we pray that our hope may not be in vain  but  may lead us  to sharing again in your kingdom. •979895_990645•
        And father we pray too for those who are not well and unable to come. •990645_996355•
        May they be sustained and kept according to their need. •998205_100114•
        And father we pray for ourselves. •100368_100559•
        And we pray too for those whom we represent. •100711_100923•
        That we may work together according to your will so that you may work for good in us. •101081_101725•
        Amen. •101822_101851•
        Er  Sadly, although I sent you a letter with suggestions for discussion I forgot to keep a copy of it for myself. •102268_103161•
        So, but I hope  if I stray too far from the path somebody will remind me. •103216_103728•
        I suggest that the first thing is erm  comments on  what recommendation you will be thinking of making to the church  in regard to the visit of er Mr and Mrs . •103828_105185•
        Has anybody anything to say? •105782_105910•
*UNK:	No, and do you want this? •106085_106188•
*ALA:	Oh, maybe I should have it. •106278_106415•
        Thank you. •106559_106586•
        Erm •107428_107464•
*UNK:	Well I think er  several points should be ventilated and er I, I think the, while you're doing the agenda this evening you could add something to each item in turn •107503_108945•
*ALA:	Mm. •108945_108951•
        Erm •108991_108997•
*JOH:	The only thing one would say though whilst agreeing with   some of the, the matters perhaps that may be aired have a bearing on the other matters in the agenda. •109022_109996•
        Perhaps number one  the one that's in the first paragraph •110069_110392•
*UNK:	Yes. •110446_110463•
*JOH:	I'll be in a position tonight, perhaps after some discussion, to make a recommendation one way or the other. •110531_111322•
*UNK:	Yes. •111367_111389•
        Well  well er  yes well   from what I've already learnt, and I've got to be rather blunt in this matter, I'm afraid that  Carol  's  expectations •111421_113134•
*JOH:	John . •113155_113164•
*UNK:	John  rather's expectations regarding the amounts, they're very ambitious indeed and  I can't speak for Salisbury Park but if we're expected to pay a share of  any alterations and so forth erm it would be very difficult for us to meet that commitment. •113223_115421•
*ALA:	Mm. •115421_115428•
*UNK:	Because we  er if, if his erm  if his er desires were carried out we'd, well we'd be talking about thousands of pounds. •115428_116429•
        Literally. •116429_116457•
        And the  •116465_116487•
*ALA:	Mm. •116522_116560•
*UNK:	I don't know whether I've spoken out of place because I'm not a member of Salisbury park but on the assumption that erm  that we would have to share in the •116831_117731•
*ALA:	Mm. •117731_117765•
*UNK:	expense you see.. of any changes. •117771_118030•
*ALA:	Are there any other comments on his visit? •118391_118592•
        Er  •118793_118807•
*JOH:	Well just to keep the ball rolling, my first impressions were good and he seemed to  be er  there was some drive about them. •119079_120037•
        His sermon er  well it was erm a reasonable sermon. •120051_120554•
        We're not going to get a good preacher. •120554_120692•
        The good preacher can get a much better church than this set up. •120711_121167•
        So we're er  we're sort of well down the list as far as that's concerned. •121167_121659•
        Erm  at first I was slightly put off by his choosing Cain and Abel as er •121772_122317•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	certainly yeah. •122331_122445•
*JOH:	the start the sermon but it, it seemed to er develop reasonably. •122473_122845•
        Erm  but I was er that was my own impression. •123033_123395•
        I rather admired what he's doing for Margaret because, as far as I can see, he's taking  er as she's not able, as far as I can see, to er exist, to  live on her own and he seems to be taking over from elderly parents. •123404_125320•
        But erm  I was er  somewhat put off altogether by comments I heard from people who had been in much closer contact than I was because I, I saw him  very little of him really. •125320_127271•
        So I think other people have er  a contribution to make which is, well it would be important. •127273_128379•
*ALA:	Anybody else with a comment? •128379_128469•
*PHI:	Well personally I mean  erm  Margaret impressed me greatly but I think  John was  inclined to be full of his own importance for one thing. •128469_129807•
        He was exceptionally demanding and  my  fairly long conversation was that he almost lead me to believe that he had got the job because when he started making comments about putting his grandfather clocks in the church  er thirty of them. •129807_131768•
        And building a   •131782_131861•
*ALA:	Thirty grandfather clocks? •132052_132198•
*PHI:	Yes. •132198_132207•
*ALA:	Oh goodness! •132207_132266•
*MAR:	What, thirty? •132298_132385•
*PHI:	Thirty, yes. •132481_132568•
*MAR:	Or or one ? •132568_132640•
*PHI:	He said he was a collector of antiques so I said I'd better keep out of the way. •132648_133231•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	Three O he said. •133231_133384•
        But the other thing that worried me, he was inclined to be  erm  mind you I felt aggression in his sermon a little, but he did incline to be very uptight. •133384_134611•
        Nervous. •134686_134736•
        And I feel that erm coming to a good pastorate, I think he would  with his history of having had trouble, trouble  I think possibly he, he  he would be ill •134852_136232•
*ALA:	Mm. •136299_136356•
*PHI:	Because he was, he was a bundle of nerves, he couldn't keep still. •136356_136687•
        And er  you know he was  I mean for instance at Salisbury Park he probably didn't mean anything but on Saturday when I was saying goodbye to him he said  now I hope there'll be somebody here at ten past ten to open this church tomorrow. •136790_138171•
        I like to be here half an hour before the service. •138228_138437•
        So I said well I said, I usually try to get here quarter past ten or soon after  but it all depends on traffic because I live the other end of the town. •138568_139614•
        Er however, I got there at quarter past ten and he followed me in. •139614_140067•
        And then, no sooner got in he said by the way, two glasses of water for me. •140136_140544•
        I'm a two glass water man. •140629_140754•
*ALA:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	So I said it's quite alright Mr , we're not very well off in Salisbury Park but we do possess a carafe and that holds three. •140851_141725•
*ALA:	 ((laugh)) 
*PHI:	And then he said here's the hymns, put those hymns up now. •141747_142057•
        I said that's not my job, it's the organist. •142073_142288•
        But I thought oh dear me. •142319_142442•
        That was  my feeling and I feel  that er •142463_142889•
*JOH:	Not conducive to a   •142923_143059•
*PHI:	Not, not for Salisbury Park. •143062_143259•
        Not for me. •143259_143311•
*UNK:	No. •143409_143430•
        I'll, I can endorse that by saying that we shouldn't, as I noticed a certain offhandedness with him that I didn't like at all. •143430_144287•
*ALA:	Mhm. •144301_144318•
*UNK:	I, I, I don't know why he talks that  of attitude but there we are. •144318_144717•
*IDA:	Mr chairman as a colleague I  felt he was alright. •144921_145449•
*ALA:	Mm. •145496_145537•
*IDA:	We had a  quite good fellowship together. •145656_145897•
        I heard him here  and I think our people was  well impressed in some respect. •146097_146927•
        We endorse what you said. •147028_147196•
        There was a terrible nervousness which you don't expect from a man of that age, and of that standing in the ministry. •147247_148049•
        And then it was further endorsed because I went to hear him at Johnstown and I thought to myself well  I felt sorry that he was erm  what's the word I want? •148193_149746•
        Well he was erm, oh I can't think of the word I want now but er he, he was glued to his notes   •149799_150338•
*ALA:	Mhm. •150370_150444•
*IDA:	You know? •150503_150521•
        There was no freedom. •150607_150681•
        No freedom. •150726_150780•
        Erm  not really and it was a, a different type of sermon. •150873_151289•
*JOH:	Yes. •151289_151308•
*IDA:	Er  I felt another thing which I, I wasn't too happy about but then again one can  soon change these things. •151308_152675•
        For instance the, the hymns that he all had, I presume at Salisbury Park  er certainly with us  and at Johnstown and at the Rio where there's no alternative, was all from the congregation   •152823_154010•
*JOH:	Yes  yes. •154019_154107•
*IDA:	Now   he knew beforehand because we told him when he came, first came here that we also use Mission Praise, and you do. •154155_155046•
*JOH:	And we do. •155046_155121•
*IDA:	I, I would have thought, personally, I would have thought he would at least have chosen one from Mission Praise for the benefit of the for the people who, who like  •155136_155974•
*ALA:	Mm. •155983_156013•
*IDA:	that sort of thing, you see. •156013_156081•
        And I think   •156081_156107•
*ALA:	Well you do get more modern hymns in that don't you? •156188_156397•
*IDA:	Beg your pardon? •156397_156438•
*ALA:	You get more modern hymns in that. •156438_156616•
*IDA:	More modern hymns and I should have thought, you know, er  I would have liked him being a little more up to date  •156616_157309•
*ALA:	Mm. •157431_157476•
*IDA:	in that respect. •157476_157541•
        Personally. •157656_157705•
        I liked him as a man and I thought er Mrs  was a delightful lady. •157905_158322•
        She was a very sweet person. •158322_158389•
*JOH:	Oh she was delightful. •158389_158431•
        Yes, yeah. •158431_158579•
*IDA:	Erm  but I think I can  agree with what Norah has said  er er er regarding the possibility of aggressiveness there. •158579_159750•
*PHI:	Mm. •159812_159820•
*IDA:	If I may just add one other thought. •159986_160343•
        Whoever the minister that comes to us, I think that they should accept the manse without question. •160343_161084•
        That's what we like to do brethren. •161182_161395•
*ALA:	Mm. •161444_161452•
*IDA:	All down through the years. •161452_161543•
        Haven't we? •161603_161676•
*ALA:	Yes. •161676_161714•
*IDA:	Some of them being too large. •161725_161857•
        But we've had to bear with it. •161966_162068•
        Too cold  but we've had to bear with it. •162082_162377•
        And why there should be such a change these days in that line I, I, I can't quite agree with it. •162377_162963•
        Er for two persons, two people, that manse was adequate I would say. •162963_163400•
        I was delightfully surprised with it myself. •163496_163877•
        A reasonable  •163877_163914•
*PHI:	Well I know you were all seemed to be you were all amazed when you went in. •163914_164304•
        I could tell by the expression on your faces when  only I felt  •164337_164608•
*IDA:	Yes I was amazed. •164608_164678•
*PHI:	it was only fair to take them in and then they know  •164678_164905•
*ALA:	I think, •164905_164927•
*PHI:	what we were talking about. •164948_165054•
        Well   •165054_165065•
*ALA:	Yes you did right. •165092_165175•
*PHI:	But each one said ooh it's not as small as we thought it was you see. •165191_165627•
*ALA:	Mm. •165666_165705•
*PHI:	But erm  it's just having that one room with a kitchen I think for  if someone calls probably you see. •165790_166488•
*UNK:	Mm. •166597_166610•
        Nice little room though. •166610_166714•
*JOH:	It could be. •166714_166786•
*UNK:	True. •166786_166798•
        Table and a couple of chairs and  portable television if you want it. •166881_167268•
*UNK:	Mm. •167290_167296•
*UNK:	Quite nice. •167349_167390•
        And adequate. •167428_167558•
*UNK:	But er you know reasonable demands are all well and good. •167577_167834•
        Perhaps if he, if he, if he could ask a thing like this then I'm sure  Salisbury Park would oblige. •167843_168300•
        But you know, if he's saying, well we do, we would like the house  redecorated all well and good. •168302_168776•
*UNK:	Oh well yes those are those are normal things. •168776_169002•
*UNK:	No but as erm  Mrs  has mentioned to me, when it comes to er converting an existing garage into a den or a study and then asking for another garage to be built. •169002_170175•
        Well  you know, it's not good enough is it? •170250_170647•
*JOH:	I would think that's out because it would destroy the value of the house er that, that has got to be sold some time. •170647_171135•
*PHI:	House, of course, and it wouldn't suit another person would it? •171135_171360•
*ALA:	Yeah. •171363_171381•
*JOH:	But er I wouldn't agree that that er manse that house is suitable for a manse. •171381_171748•
*UNK:	Mm. •171768_171774•
*JOH:	It wants at least one more room downstairs. •171885_172103•
        It would be very unfair to er Margaret that every time somebody called she's got, she's banished to the kitchen. •172103_172699•
        And er  he, he could use the er  his vestry or another room at the, the church but somebody calling in the evening, he's not going to take them over to a  a cold room for an interview. •172869_173973•
*MAR:	But, but if he knew, if he knew Ken that they were coming. •174131_174325•
        You know? •174325_174399•
*JOH:	Ah but then he wouldn't necessarily. •174399_174531•
*MAR:	Mm. •174531_174538•
        But most people duly come surely make an appointment? •174548_174794•
        But I, I think •174845_174956•
*UNK:	No, some do some don't. •174956_175066•
*MAR:	I  think in some way here, with this particular situation  as okay we, we go into the question of the house now  the house shouldn't be the issue here. •175105_176071•
*JOH:	No. •176134_176144•
*UNK:	Oh no, not  not   •176144_176199•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	with this situation the •176208_176347•
*UNK:	The question has been raised, that's right •176370_176519•
*MAR:	Erm obviously the er  and  as Alan's asked us few weeks ago, permission to explore  maybe looking for the finances, if and when it became the situation. •176519_177559•
*JOH:	That's right. •177559_177586•
*MAR:	But if er John  came last week and to all of us  we were of a like mind that yes, he fitted the calling here  everything else  I, I see then that the manse would be the issue but  basically now we're talking in many ways  other issues are affecting the call here  than the manse so therefore the manse goes down the, the pecking order. •177633_179639•
*ALA:	Erm •179746_179769•
*MAR:	But basically the matter we consider  is John  the suitable man for the ministry? •179769_180242•
*ALA:	Yes I I think  I think that is the proper order to do things. •180242_180553•
*JOH:	Yes. •180553_180572•
*ALA:	I think first of all we want to know  er as far as it's possible, which of course is always er  within the limitations of our abilities whether we think he's a man that we can recommend to the church, that they should call him. •180592_182096•
        Now the people I've heard speaking so far  don't seem to think so. •182188_182722•
        Is there anybody who disagrees with that assessment? •182722_183002•
        Just to complete the picture. •183062_183248•
*UNK:	Well  we had him for the weekend and er  looking back on the weekend  we were reasonably impressed with the man and his wife. •183369_184729•
        And er from his conversation  he appeared  to be a homely sort of a chap and er  he was outspoken but he would call a spade a spade. •184729_186041•
        Er  in church his diction was clear for all to hear. •186060_187017•
        He spoke well to the children  and er his sermon message did have a, a reasonable amount of substance in it. •187108_188208•
        But under the circumstances of being there on trial, I did feel that he was  very nervous. •188352_189220•
        Er the Saturday evening we  were in the lounge and  chatting away for two or three hours and he, he could not keep still. •189380_190658•
        He was  •190671_190711•
*PHI:	Mm that's right yeah. •190711_190764•
*UNK:	moving to the left and to the right and sliding down. •190783_191075•
*PHI:	Down and moving his seat   •191075_191204•
*UNK:	He, he  •191208_191236•
*UNK:	He's uncomfortable. •191242_191296•
*UNK:	He was uncomfortable. •191333_191424•
        And when he was in the pulpit I felt that he was  there was tension  there was tension there •191534_192346•
*ALA:	Mm. •192355_192394•
*UNK:	Er whether  he did say in a conversation that he, he knows when this nervousness er er and depression is coming on and he takes medication and it's alright. •192398_193613•
        But er  that's to be seen   •193701_194060•
*PHI:	I might add that Idris rang me up last night, I was on the telephone for about three quarters of an hour with him. •194310_194912•
*ALA:	That's typical Idris. •194965_195068•
*PHI:	But he did ring up. •195155_195246•
        He  he said  you're one person I can talk to, you listen to me and I can talk to you and er he didn't want to worry you at that time but  for him, he didn't think he was suitable. •195246_196610•
        Even Idris who er they're desperate for  but he Idris didn't think  you know, he could cope with the four churches. •196723_197589•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	Well Idris rang me up last night which is not unusual because he often rings, you know •197737_198163•
*PHI:	Yeah. •198163_198188•
*IDA:	once a week to me and I ring him occasionally, and er  his first remark which was quite erm natural he said well you know Ernest, he said  I've heard many ministers. •198230_199274•
*PHI:	Yes   •199387_199396•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*IDA:	Like we all have, haven't we? •199410_199554•
        And we're, we're all  guilty of being critics. •199554_199962•
*PHI:	Mm. •200053_200059•
        Mm. •200062_200068•
*IDA:	But erm Idris said, in effect, which is an expression which we've all used at some time or another, he did nothing for me. •200068_201071•
*PHI:	That's right, yes. •201130_201207•
*IDA:	In inverted commas. •201237_201295•
        He did nothing for me. •201319_201385•
*PHI:	Mm. •201385_201397•
        Mm. •201397_201403•
        Mm. •201427_201433•
*IDA:	You see? •201548_201573•
        And er  I knew what Idris was referring to you see. •201629_201960•
*JOH:	I thought   •202094_202107•
*IDA:	Somehow or another erm  Idris and I have clicked, somehow or another  and erm I understand him and he understands me. •202156_203168•
*ALA:	Mm. •203185_203224•
*IDA:	And that's how we've er been able to get on so well together  •203274_203500•
*PHI:	Yes, same here. •203500_203545•
        Same here. •203545_203563•
*IDA:	you know? •203586_203609•
*PHI:	Yeah. •203689_203729•
*IDA:	Er  but I would add this to you know  please do not depend in any way upon Beria  •203729_204433•
*PHI:	No cos he •204476_204531•
*IDA:	Because it's  it's folding up, it's dying quickly. •204531_204857•
*PHI:	Yes. •204857_204870•
*ALA:	I'm, I'm afraid that is so. •204893_205035•
*IDA:	That is so. •205036_205077•
*ALA:	I, I don't  I honestly don't know what we're going to do about Beria  •205077_205462•
*IDA:	No I don't, but  So it's more or less a threesome if anything at all. •205462_205822•
*ALA:	Mm. •205899_205933•
*IDA:	Really. •206020_206035•
*GET:	I thought his nervousness was because of the ordeal of  you know er being before us as a  •206090_206856•
*PHI:	But it shouldn't be after all that time. •206858_207291•
*GET:	you know? •207291_207305•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	This was one of the one of the things I asked him wasn't it? •207305_207593•
        When we were when we were  •207593_207749•
*GET:	Yes. •207780_207796•
*JOH:	talking afterwards about the team ministry and working together and the problems and  his experiences. •207796_208532•
*IDA:	You're not nervous are you Peter ? •208541_208612•
*UNK:	 ((laugh))  (        ) 
*GET:	No but under the circumstances a man that  a man who  •208612_208841•
*IDA:	take the biscuits . •208891_208979•
*GET:	yeah, who has  er had you know •208979_209261•
*JOH:	Yeah. •209327_209336•
*GET:	a nervous problem •209336_209433•
*JOH:	Mm. •209505_209537•
*GET:	perhaps it was because of the situation. •209537_209845•
*UNK:	Mm. •209902_209913•
*GET:	You know, and perhaps  if he came, he would overcome it. •209913_210359•
*JOH:	Yes. •210388_210404•
        I agree but I think that anybody who speaks in public, you have nervousness beforehand and the moment you go to talk to the people  you know what you're going to say, you have a few notes in front of you and you talk to the people, if that is your job. •210404_211601•
*UNK:	Absolutely. •211601_211608•
*JOH:	It's what you do. •211609_211675•
*UNK:	Yes. •211726_211737•
*JOH:	No matter how much your knees tremble  underneath, underneath the table. •211799_212197•
        But you talk to people with the fervour of what you want to tell them. •212197_212644•
*UNK:	That's true. •212645_212660•
*JOH:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	Er I, I think I would agree with you there that I mean it's natural to be nervous •212660_213190•
*JOH:	Absolutely, yes. •213190_213272•
*ALA:	in a situation like that  •213272_213424•
*JOH:	Yes. •213490_213499•
*ALA:	but  usually once one gets sort of started it  it gets better. •213499_214144•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*IDA:	And  he, he possibly had done it at least a half a dozen times  •214150_214517•
*JOH:	Oh must have done. •214517_214612•
*IDA:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	Yes. •214718_214737•
*ALA:	Mm. •214737_214748•
*IDA:	Even even if he wasn't accepted on a first occasion he's probably had another two or three attempts elsewhere. •214748_215222•
*JOH:	Yeah. •215258_215268•
*IDA:	So he's done it before. •215302_215364•
*JOH:	And and lots of churches that he was telling us that he'd been in contact with. •215364_215603•
        And he must have gone to those churches for the first time. •215657_216002•
        And I don't suppose that, you know, a new ministry is so very different from meeting people in a new church. •216002_216406•
*IDA:	That's right. •216407_216501•
        People are the same everywhere. •216501_216652•
*JOH:	Well yes. •216652_216735•
        And they are all there willing you to do well. •216735_217076•
*IDA:	Yes, yes. •217076_217222•
*JOH:	Whatever, you know, audience you're speaking in front of. •217254_217393•
        I mean of course you're going to be judged  adversely perhaps, but in a church you are being  listened to by people who are of like mind, and therefore willing you to have something of  value and interest to say to them. •217544_218835•
*ALA:	Er  yes that, that is important because I mean when you feel that people are sympathetic •219029_219543•
*JOH:	Mm. •219558_219574•
*ALA:	then it's easier to speak. •219574_219718•
*JOH:	Mm. •219720_219728•
*UNK:	Oh yes. •219804_219871•
*JOH:	And we wouldn't have invited him if we weren't sympathetic would we? •219871_220169•
*ALA:	Hardly . •220169_220176•
*JOH:	You know. •220176_220185•
*GET:	Oh well if he's a nervous person he wouldn't think like that would he? •220185_220579•
*JOH:	Well exactly. •220579_220742•
*JOH:	No I feel that this ties in with his nervous breakdown. •220742_221029•
*UNK:	Mm. •221054_221071•
*JOH:	We had a somewhat similar experience at a previous church  I was at where we were looking for a minister  and the, the man er who was, who came to us was again very nervous and excitable and so on. •221078_222304•
        Fortunately we had a doctor in our congregation who er was had some knowledge of psychiatry  and he had a fairly long session with him, just the two of them. •222622_223866•
        And he strongly recommended us not to accept this man. •223882_224371•
        And this man went to another church not so very far away so we knew what happened  and certainly we were very glad we accepted our doctor's opinion. •224371_225291•
*JOH:	Mm. •225352_225358•
*ALA:	Mm. •225363_225378•
        Well it looks as though er  there's a fairly clear majority against  er making a call as far as I read it. •225378_226506•
        I don't, do you want a show er do you want to vote? •226506_226866•
*UNK:	Oh, does anybody  know the  of the the younger people  the younger members of the churches? •226866_227483•
        Did he appeal to the younger members? •227605_227767•
        Or •227767_227776•
*UNK:	No. •227776_227787•
        Not  not as far  •227787_227839•
*UNK:	oh well  •227858_227900•
*ALA:	Er •227900_227912•
*UNK:	if we send a recommendation to   •227912_228057•
*MAR:	a recommendation to the church you see, so I •228057_228282•
*UNK:	Erm •228316_228325•
*MAR:	You must know the feeling of this meeting first mustn't you? •228325_228611•
*ALA:	Yes. •228611_228626•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	But one, one would say no, I mean, I don't disagree with what you said about  er the children's address, well I do  personally. •228626_229341•
*PHI:	Yes. •229402_229435•
*MAR:	Erm  he  the same children's address here as he did in Salisbury Park. •229537_229896•
*PHI:	Did he? •229896_229995•
        Mm. •229995_230006•
*MAR:	I would think so, about the elephants? •230006_230166•
*IDA:	That's right. •230167_230207•
*PHI:	Yeah. •230266_230297•
*MAR:	Right. •230327_230349•
        And in, in  er •230349_230454•
*PHI:	Our children weren't  •230454_230524•
*MAR:	the children didn't even know he was talking to them. •230524_230649•
*PHI:	Mm. •230724_230732•
        He stayed up on the pulpit or whatever didn't he? •230739_230943•
*MAR:	Erm  you see if this the pulpit, he didn't come  •230943_231078•
*UNK:	Yeah. •231109_231141•
*MAR:	And what I was gonna say Alan was, perhaps like Mr  you know we had one of the ones sitting here that did go up to two services. •231141_231904•
        I also went to Johnstown yesterday. •231904_232131•
        So I heard him in Salisbury Park last week and in Johnstown yesterday. •232131_232563•
        I felt a, a degree of obligation because of my commitment with Johnstown now •232570_232943•
*ALA:	Mm. •232960_232982•
*MAR:	so I went to Johnstown yesterday afternoon. •232982_233242•
        Well I, I've gotta be honest in what I'm saying, I sat through two services yesterday  the morning service did a lot for me. •233305_234104•
        But the afternoon service did nothing. •234104_234360•
*UNK:	Mm. •234360_234366•
*MAR:	The morning service in fact I would, I've gotta say it Norah. •234366_234632•
*PHI:	Mm. •234683_234694•
*MAR:	The minister we had taking the service yesterday morning I think felt as much on trial in Salisbury Park  •234694_235144•
*PHI:	I'm sure he did. •235145_235212•
        Yes he did. •235212_235299•
*UNK:	Yes, yes. •235299_235376•
*MAR:	because he was a student with us    •235415_235601•
*PHI:	It was . •235601_235686•
        Mm. •235686_235692•
        Yeah. •235692_235725•
*ALA:	Mhm! •235725_235732•
*MAR:	And  had come back yesterday  •235842_235924•
*PHI:	He was nervous wasn't he? •235924_235984•
*UNK:	He was. •235999_236014•
        Yeah. •236014_236027•
*MAR:	after his first appointment was as much on trial as Kenneth . •236027_236380•
*PHI:	Yeah. •236446_236466•
*MAR:	And, but  yesterday •236474_236629•
*PHI:	Hasn't he improved? •236630_236727•
*MAR:	relaxed •236727_236755•
*UNK:	Definitely improved. •236755_236824•
*MAR:	unwound himself and you could tell his two years, what it had done for him. •236824_237101•
*UNK:	Hadn't it just? •237102_237205•
*MAR:	Marvellous. •237205_237227•
        But  •237242_237272•
*UNK:	yes, incredible. •237272_237392•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	a number of people said to me how much they enjoyed yesterday's service. •237392_237719•
*PHI:	Mm. •237751_237760•
*UNK:	Yeah. •237760_237766•
*MAR:	He also took a communion service again which was    •237766_238043•
*UNK:	yeah. •238138_238149•
*MAR:	But I came home and feeling I could relate all I'd  •238149_238383•
*UNK:	Yeah. •238392_238417•
*MAR:	But I sat in  yesterday afternoon  and I felt sorry for the man's daughter who'd been given a hymn  the service. •238417_239350•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	Who was put on a spot. •239350_239509•
        Erm and as you said he, he couldn't leave his notes. •239509_239838•
        Cos I'll have to confess to you, I saw him diligently once looking below the pulpit •239838_240304•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	at his, at his notes •240304_240481•
*UNK:	Yeah. •240544_240557•
*MAR:	of what he was gonna do next. •240557_240776•
*UNK:	Yeah. •240776_240797•
*MAR:	Erm there was the whole time a sense of anxiety about him. •240834_241184•
        Alright  he knew he had to go to  afterwards, half past three, but he couldn't unwind one bit there. •241241_241726•
        And there are occasions, I think we all agree, alright we have to have notes, but you must unwind a little bit to get near to the people. •241726_242495•
        And I would not feel that Kenneth  would could get near to any one of us. •242495_242778•
*ALA:	Mm. •242905_242914•
*MAR:	But I hate to say it because obviously he wants to find, to go somewhere. •242914_243365•
        But I don't think this is the place . •243365_243480•
        And heart to heart, having sat through two, I went home  it was heavy. •243525_243984•
*ALA:	Mm. •244161_244170•
*GET:	Well a lot of our people said they liked him didn't they? •244170_244484•
*IDA:	Yes, oh yes. •244484_244678•
        Yes. •244692_244717•
        Yes erm  you see we're in a different, different situation than what you are at Salisbury Park. •244717_245275•
        We haven't had to make a demand upon our congregation to make such a decision for twenty two or twenty five years you see? •245275_246273•
*ALA:	Mm. •246273_246302•
*IDA:	Whereas you've had to do that at Salisbury Park you see? •246302_246622•
        May I just say I went to erm Johnstown yesterday because  I had half promised our friends here that I would go to support them. •246622_247543•
*ALA:	Mm. •247551_247569•
*IDA:	It wasn't actually my Sunday. •247569_247739•
        I, I'd forego'd that Sunday afternoon for agreeing to come there. •247764_248153•
        That's why I went. •248154_248238•
        But I, I also wanted an endorsement •248238_248565•
*UNK:	Mm. •248584_248590•
*IDA:	of what I heard the previous week. •248590_248816•
*ALA:	Mm. •248882_248889•
*IDA:	And I think naturally we would all like that. •248928_249360•
*ALA:	Erm •249430_249452•
*UNK:	Well  going back to the very first meeting that we had •249552_249842•
*ALA:	Mm? •249842_249845•
*UNK:	I did come away that er  really wasn't struck. •249845_250334•
        But I didn't like at all  the er  excuses he made for his wife. •250334_250950•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*UNK:	er that we weren't employing her. •250991_251485•
*ALA:	Mm. •251576_251594•
*UNK:	Well right-oh  we er  I don't think we ever do expect that much. •251594_252046•
        But all the same, at the same time, we do expect them to mix. •252087_252440•
*ALA:	Mm. •252531_252557•
*UNK:	If they're going to mix with the church then they'll be only too happy to  take some part in it. •252557_253088•
*ALA:	Mm. •253154_253188•
*UNK:	But then in the sermons  when he came here to preach  er I didn't see any sign of nervousness myself. •253270_254057•
        Couldn't see any sign of nervousness myself  but er I'm very happy with his sermons, quite good. •254170_254850•
        But er at the same time the further I go on, the more apprehensive I get about it. •255075_255547•
        Whether  coming here or not and I don't really think that, you know, coming back to it  I don't think he would fit in. •255547_256514•
*ALA:	Mm. •256660_256666•
        Er  well •256666_257042•
*UNK:	We are rather an old congregation, there's no doubt about it, apart from the  here. •257042_257796•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	But er  you can, I mean we've got, of course I'm not too young myself  but er we are set in our ways. •257844_258623•
*ALA:	Mm. •258682_258690•
*UNK:	And that takes up with the . •258690_258902•
        Can't alter that. •258965_259024•
*JOH:	What bothered me most was the fact that he  •259128_259307•
*UNK:	Mm? •259307_259313•
*JOH:	What bothered me well one of the things that bothers me is the fact that he said that he wouldn't like to do hospital chaplaincy because he wouldn't like to go visiting because he's got no small talk. •259321_260233•
        And I'm just wondering what the  the knock on effect of that is in the visiting of the, the members who can't get into church and who can't receive communion in church, and who may like to receive it in their home, or in the home, where they live. •260417_262131•
        Because you don't just suddenly go in  give communion to someone and walk away again do you? •262229_262550•
*UNK:	Mm. •262649_262655•
*JOH:	You, you you establish a rapport of listening for a little while to whatever it is that they've got to say, and their troubles and their anxieties  and I wasn't happy that  •262655_263588•
*ALA:	Mm. •263735_263777•
*JOH:	there would be that sympathy. •263826_263979•
        I'm certain that the sympathy is there with his wife. •264007_264266•
*PHI:	Yes. •264297_264312•
*UNK:	Yes. •264348_264357•
*JOH:	Absolutely. •264392_264448•
        But I don't how much that compassion and love for fellow  people goes beyond his wife to the congregation. •264532_265319•
*PHI:	Mm. •265319_265325•
*JOH:	I don't know. •265325_265402•
        I don't know. •265402_265554•
*ALA:	Mm. •265566_265602•
*JOH:	And if, if he says to us in meeting that he's got no small talk and no  erm ability for visiting  in a hospital situation where you can ask people how they are, and then can move to the next person you've got to see  I'm not sure how he would be visiting someone in their home. •265641_267460•
*ALA:	Mm. •267692_267742•
*JOH:	 (        ) 
*IDA:	It's also a question isn't it, of whether you appoint a man because he's a good preacher or secondly because he's a good pastor. •267861_268568•
        That's really the question isn't it? •268658_268809•
*ALA:	Mm. •268809_268818•
*PHI:	You never get the two? •268824_268916•
*IDA:	You can't get the two. •268968_269040•
*UNK:	 (        ) 
*JOH:	You're very lucky if you do aren't you? •269040_269200•
*IDA:	I would say the second is the more important. •269735_269903•
*PHI:	The more important being a good pastor. •269903_270131•
*JOH:	Yeah but you must, that, that, that your congregation, that all the people in the pastorate must know that they can go to you and that you will listen. •270131_270681•
*UNK:	Yes that's  •270689_270745•
*JOH:	And that you, they, they  that they will have, for the time that they are in your company, your whole attention. •270808_271397•
        And your whole mind concentrated on what happens to be  concerning them. •271549_272124•
        Whatever else you've left behind at home. •272241_272401•
*ALA:	Mm. •272401_272411•
*JOH:	But for that moment  you are there for them. •272515_272880•
        in their service. •272880_272930•
        You know? •273176_273193•
*ALA:	Mm. •273241_273290•
*IDA:	In other words, the skills of a counsellor? •273336_273485•
*PHI:	Yes. •273517_273536•
        Yes. •273536_273547•
*JOH:	Definitely. •273547_273588•
        Definitely. •273669_273697•
*ALA:	Er well as far as I can see erm  with, with a few minor reservations, the  the elders would prefer not to recommend to the church that a call be issued. •273740_275042•
        have I got it right? •275042_275120•
*UNK:	Mm. •275178_275192•
*UNK:	Yes. •275192_275212•
        I think you are right. •275212_275255•
        I think   •275255_275282•
*GET:	Well you've got to have a unanimous decision haven't you? •275286_275489•
*UNK:	Mm. •275521_275527•
*GET:	And I mean you know, there's three to one isn't it? •275550_275791•
*ALA:	Erm  oh you mean in favour  •275829_276047•
*GET:	In favour, yeah. •276047_276111•
*ALA:	of a call? •276111_276168•
*GET:	Yeah. •276168_276183•
*ALA:	Yes. •276183_276219•
        Well  certainly I mean, one would want to have a substantial majority in favour of a call to issue it. •276258_277120•
        Now whether in fact the church meeting would come to a different conclusion from us I've no means of knowing but  probably not because most of you know something about the church that you're working with. •277171_278342•
*UNK:	Well  impressed with   •278356_278515•
*GET:	That's what I'm saying. •278572_278642•
        Our, our people seemed   •278678_278787•
*UNK:	They all liked him   •278790_278852•
*UNK:	our congregation yesterday and erm  the feeling I got was that erm  we couldn't support a minister ourselves, and we're  and, well at least the congregation think that they're there entirely to help Salisbury Park. •278858_280566•
        Erm and I think I go with them on these lines. •280566_280818•
        And we're hoping to get something out of that sale •280918_281186•
*UNK:	Mm. •281229_281235•
*UNK:	and what we're trying to do is plough whatever we get back into the group •281281_281761•
*ALA:	Mm. •281796_281822•
*UNK:	so that erm  more or less Salisbury Park are the people who really  they said that whatever the decision, decision they make, they would fall in with them. •281884_282695•
*ALA:	Mm. •282713_282732•
*UNK:	So er it looks as if the decision's against, so  I'm almost sure that the decision at Johnstown will be against. •282790_283404•
*ALA:	Well •283404_283413•
