*ALA:	Er, yes. •147355_147411•
*MAR:	Did you have, did you read those words? •147411_147590•
*ALA:	Er  yes, I just glanced through it. •147590_147815•
*MAR:	Oh! •147859_147862•
*ALA:	Well  actually there's no decision yet from the church meeting •147862_148315•
*MAR:	Yeah. •148326_148337•
*ALA:	so we've still got to •148446_148578•
*MAR:	. •_•
*ALA:	Yes, but they could  •148662_148791•
*MAR:	And they could  •148809_148923•
*ALA:	sell it. •148923_149005•
*MAR:	I mean, my favourite  but . •149005_149184•
*MAR:	Mm. •149421_149442•
*MAR:	And it was a major problem of finance  it seems to me  when you've two possible avenues left to take. •149507_150180•
*MAR:	When you  I think it's  yes. •150180_150313•
*MAR:	One is  getting a loan from the church •150357_150811•
*MAR:	Mm. •150811_150832•
*MAR:	and repaying it at  five percent interest or whatever is a rate of  •150832_151172•
*ALA:	Yes. •151172_151221•
*MAR:	fare. •151242_151272•
        And  there's no guarantee they'll  they'll lend it. •151459_151714•
*ALA:	If they ask for money. •151722_151826•
*MAR:	The other is to apply to come back   that  I  the interest that I . •151859_152397•
        I was told that , over a year ago   but I haven't found any yet! •152526_153315•
*ALA:	I see! •153386_153439•
*MAR:	I've got a lot of information about charitable trusts but all ! •153452_153756•
        I can't see that any one of them which is  you know, would have that as one of the things. •153834_154494•
*ALA:	I see. •154546_154574•
*MAR:	Now I haven't finished, but I mean I, it really is at the top of my mind,, you know it hasn't  I haven't given it top priority. •154574_155067•
*MAR:	Well you've got a lot of other things to think about I'd say. •155152_155360•
*MAR:	Well all the other things have been  more urgent, so therefore, I haven't really pursued it to its limits. •155360_155791•
*ALA:	Mm. •155863_155902•
*MAR:	So, you know if  if you find there's a  position for  when they absolutely need help  you know, phone me again or write to me again and tell me you've  you've, you've set everything . •155945_157217•
*ALA:	Well keep in touch. •157578_157617•
*MAR:	But, well I mean I  it's a  so far, I really don't push. •157617_157790•
*ALA:	I see. •157845_157880•
*MAR:	I've got the names of lots of  •157880_158002•
*ALA:	Mm. •158071_158112•
*MAR:	I'll try to get started. •158112_158229•
        But, you know  if you need some   I can't  any of them , as being willing to . •158308_158993•
*ALA:	Mm mm. •159188_159203•
*MAR:	In the pipeline. •159203_159290•
        But there may something at the   there might  •159321_159556•
*MAR:	Oh there there might be! •159556_159656•
        I think might be  because it's a  the four churches together. •159685_160215•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	That's right,. •160297_160692•
*MAR:	If it  need it  to share the cost of the new one  but once it goes on the  •160692_161734•
*MAR:	 •161755_•
*MAR:	four churches •161762_161797•
*ALA:	Yes. •161797_161803•
*MAR:	and not on the one. •161803_162017•
        and er, also  therefore  you'll have the , if you like •162017_162558•
*ALA:	Yeah. •162570_162573•
*MAR:	or . •162675_162682•
        I wish some other churches would come and . •162707_162977•
*ALA:	Well we'll be stuck into finding a finance man  er, to watch the cost over the . •162977_163852•
*MAR:	You need ? •163852_163921•
*ALA:	Yeah, I mean . •163921_164031•
*MAR:	You've gotta look at  the same as . •164032_164218•
*ALA:	Have you got •164218_164334•
*MAR:	Erm   in the personals •164343_164510•
*ALA:	to me . •164518_164560•
*MAR:	and the personal situation now  is that  economic climate   get a house  how many are talking here! •164622_165998•
*ALA:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	sometimes from a . •165998_166041•
*MAR:	Like, you'd better   can I get rid of these? •166041_166363•
*ALA:	Please! •166363_166376•
*MAR:	Would you be able stay with the one you've got? •166376_166552•
*MAR:	Well the one we've got above our   in fact, there's one next door to us going for sale at the moment  and they're asking advertised prices   else you'll be getting about fifty thousand on top  that's ours. •166552_167851•
        It was a short   she wants fifty thousand pound for ! •167851_168319•
        And because  that one  even if we didn't rule out   it says fifteen forty. •168319_169110•
*ALA:	Mm. •169110_169133•
*MAR:	And it seems for the churches  we'd then be looking up to point  forty , fourteen percent  for fifty thousand pounds. •169133_169886•
*ALA:	, actually  John was suggesting  that we might talk nicely to John's dad about the money they've got invested in the sale of their , their ground. •169896_170767•
        I don't know how far we'd get but er  it's worth looking at. •171001_171296•
*MAR:	The only thing is though, I mean, you see but  I think the church itself  and  I would say the church as the group now •171296_171922•
*ALA:	Mm. •171976_171992•
*MAR:	would be looking at that  as a more meaningful  contribution to . •171992_172500•
*ALA:	Mm. •172500_172520•
*MAR:	Well what else can you talk ? •172576_173095•
        So to be able to   the  sweepstake   in the past  another church and they could be, they could be  on the interest  you know, the amount  towards  running costs such as this. •173095_176499•
        Well, to me running costs wouldn't be  and the cost of towards  borrowing  a house is the same way you know. •176502_177159•
*MAR:	Well exactly! •177159_177215•
        The point is that   looks very nice . •177215_177631•
*ALA:	Yeah. •177655_177663•
*MAR:	You know, but I mean if the church cannot find   contributions it really can't ! •177663_178191•
        Well you see , like  like  . •178191_178672•
*ALA:	Exactly! •179109_179128•
        Yes well  erm  we're still going to have to talk about it with the elders you see. •179128_179766•
*MAR:	Sorry, what did you say? •179766_179915•
*ALA:	We're still going to have to talk about with the , with the  •179916_180107•
*MAR:	With the  •180127_180173•
*ALA:	joint elders group. •180173_180265•
*MAR:	Yes, yes, yes, yes •180282_180360•
*ALA:	Erm •180360_180387•
*MAR:	Quite right! •180387_180428•
*ALA:	which meets on Monday. •180428_180755•
        Er so  I might be in touch with you after that. •180755_180980•
*MAR:	Oh right. •180980_181045•
        But I mean even now you can  you can read that thing out to me. •181045_181395•
*ALA:	Yes. •181395_181398•
*MAR:	I mean, that, that was  you er   goals, you know. •181398_181847•
        No, no messing, I mean I did that   ages ago and I,, it just arrived! •182011_182447•
        I think I was already in . •182461_182574•
*ALA:	Did you have a good holiday by the way? •182574_182730•
*MAR:	Lovely holiday, thank you. •182730_182793•
        But I but I was there for a fortnight and when I came back  I, you know it's  preparing for Synod just takes all the time we have somehow and I •182796_183601•
*ALA:	Oh yes. •183636_183655•
*MAR:	I  I was only off the plane just last week  I'd better have a look at this   •183655_184289•
*ALA:	Yeah. •184289_184298•
*MAR:	dear, dear, dear! •184298_184421•
*ALA:	Just a , matter of interest where do you come from because on this  dictionary thing I'm supposed to put down what people's local accent is? •184421_185067•
*MAR:	Ah, that's good! •185236_185364•
        Only Oxford, no I'm, mine is in in  inexplicable because I've lived in so many places and I pick up accents! •185477_186137•
        I was born in Lancashire, so that's  •186143_186325•
*ALA:	Mm. •186325_186332•
*MAR:	the basis of it all. •186332_186512•
        I've had the roughest edges knocked off it when I went to University. •186513_186799•
        And , but then I went to live in  Northern Ireland so I've got a picked up a fair bit of Northern Ireland. •186799_187265•
*ALA:	Yes well, it does happen when, •187439_187576•
*MAR:	Cos it's a hybrid, it's an old  •187595_187691•
*ALA:	It  •187708_187727•
*MAR:	 (        ) 
*ALA:	it does happen when you move around. •187727_187920•
*MAR:	Yeah it does. •187952_187993•
*ALA:	In  I think it happened to me to some extent. •187993_188286•
*MAR:	Well it does, if if  if you pick up  accents, some people never change! •188305_188726•
*ALA:	That's true. •188727_188790•
*MAR:	some people, doesn't matter where you go they never change! •188790_189056•
        But, if you are at all I mean , you, I think you pick up reflections. •189094_189534•
*ALA:	Mm. •189571_189577•
*MAR:	You know, I haven't been consciously , striving to change my accent. •189577_190012•
        In fact, you know I'm consciously now not to become a Welsh accent  because if I've got the Welsh accent added to it all it'll be horrendous! •190037_190730•
*ALA:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAR:	But er    •190892_190914•
*ALA:	Right. •190914_190936•
*MAR:	I have  •191313_191390•
*MAR:	Yeah. •191391_191392•
*MAR:	isn't it? •191392_191632•
*ALA:	Yes. •191633_191634•
        It's at least distinctive! •191995_192162•
*MAR:	It is. •192221_192244•
        On the notice you sent out  the other day for Monday's meeting •192244_192628•
*MAR:	Yes. •192628_192654•
*MAR:	I think you put a paragraph first  that said maybe we will need to consider  our recommendation •192654_193338•
*ALA:	Yes. •193338_193344•
*MAR:	and the, of course, you went onto to number one the man's    two er, group secretary  who draws it out  I forgot what the other one was. •193344_194037•
*ALA:	Yes. •194037_194048•
*MAR:	Maybe in some thing which  at the moment  is that the be number one. •194048_194916•
*ALA:	Er  which , which one you mean, the •194916_195043•
*MAR:	Well that number one be the question on recommendation. •195072_195313•
*ALA:	I see! •195384_195437•
        Oh yes! •195442_195469•
        Well I was thinking that. •195469_195582•
*MAR:	Yeah. •195597_195606•
        But it really is, it might have got lost in the paragraph mighten it? •195606_195915•
        Cos when the  comes underneath. •195915_196056•
*ALA:	I see what you mean. •196056_196171•
*MAR:	It isn't being critical at all but  on this position situation that might the first thing that we •196172_196708•
*ALA:	Oh yes, I was assuming that  erm  I , I didn't really set it out as a formal agenda just as a •196708_197479•
*MAR:	Just as a note  •197516_197586•
*ALA:	a reminder, like. •197603_197683•
*MAR:	Erm  I don't know what the situation will be in the other churches. •197683_198132•
*ALA:	Mm. •198158_198166•
*MAR:	And I must say between us at the moment  there wasn't a strong feeling  what it's all about. •198166_198893•
*ALA:	Not a strong feeling in favour? •198893_199211•
        No? •199211_199222•
*MAR:	No, I'm only saying  as prepared  with  •199223_199545•
*ALA:	Mm. •199545_199551•
*MAR:	. •_•
*ALA:	Well erm •199584_199713•
*MAR:	I mean, this is nothing to do with a  don't worry that's  we don't want them thinking that the house is the issue cos it isn't, alright? •199722_200370•

        That's a pity! •203111_203224•
*MAR:	Yeah  well that's    erm, I mean, the only talking is between us at the moment it's just, you know,. •203353_203891•

*MAR:	Mm. •211704_211729•
