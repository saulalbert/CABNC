               [1828] The machine, an original  Boston Tacker from the early nineteen hundreds was prepared by Taffy for showing at the exhibition this month at Wellingborough branch.<br>
               [1829] The organizers of the exhibition wanted a  Boston Tacker to stand in the foyer to tie in with the theme of the seventy fifth anniversary of the B U   ... locating   ... however, locating the complete model has proved something of a headache like the Model T Ford, the  Boston Tacker was always very common but is now something of a rarity   ... and the branch had finally settled for head to be borrowed from C and J Clarke, shoe machi , museum in Street, Somerset.<br>
               [1830] Luckily, Taffy returning from his annual holiday remembered that there was a complete  Tacker in the factory of a local manufacturer   ... still being operated.<br>
               [1831] The directors of the firm kindly gave B U permission to borrow a  Tacker for the exhibition and after Le Leicester branch arranged a temporary replacement, Taffy began working, cleaning up the machine to showroom condition.<br>
               [1832] Taffy spent five days cleaning, polishing, painting   ... he copied the motives which were missing from and old nineteen hundred and eight B U machinery catalogue   ... which he examined with a watchmaker's glass.<br>
               [1833] Taffy  spent the   ... majority of his time at B U   ... as a serviceman at  Risden and Leicester branches, but had an eighteen month period during world war two assembling jet engines at  Powerjets, Wexton His wife   ... and he lives in  Spencefield area of Leicester  [] .<br></td>
