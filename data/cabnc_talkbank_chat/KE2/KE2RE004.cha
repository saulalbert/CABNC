*PS0W2:	Right okay .  1104414_1104964
*PS0W7:	I I knew that erm I uns I sa understand some of it but some of it I find a bit hard to understand like this bit it says be careful sometimes the unknown side is is the longest side and sometimes it is not But I thi I I ca n't I know that you have to take it away .  1104964_1123454
*PS0W2:	Yes but the thing is this in a right angle triangle .  1123664_1126374
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1126374_1126614
*PS0W2:	the longest side is called what Cos it .  1126614_1129524
*PS0W7:	The hypotenuse .  1129524_1130664
*PS0W2:	The hypotenuse right So the longer side is always the hypotenuse .  1130664_1133564
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1133564_1133654
*PS0W2:	Right Now what is the formula for your Pythagoras theorem .  1133654_1139204
*PS0W7:	The sum of the erm I do I do n't I know my dad 's taught me a different one to Miss she she taught me that erm i the oh hang on It 's back here I got a new book today so but she taught that is was ha Erm if I can find it The right angle triangle The areas and squares on the two short sides add together to equal the area on the square of the hypotenuse .  1139434_1173319
*PS0W2:	Right The square on the hypotenuse .  1173319_1176519
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1176519_1176689
*PS0W2:	equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides .  1176689_1181189
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1181189_1181419
*PS0W2:	The square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides .  1181419_1188189
*PS0W7:	Okay .  1188189_1188409
*PS0W2:	Alright .  1188409_1188789
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1189739_1189929
*PS0W2:	And the squ hypotenuse is always the longest side It 's the side opposite the right angle .  1190619_1198669
*PS0W7:	Mhm .  1198669_1198939
*PS0W2:	So there 's your right angle that is the hypotenuse and the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares that 's the su the area of that square and the area of that square add together the sum of the squares on the other two sides .  1199339_1213419
*PS0W7:	Okay .  1213589_1214039
*PS0W2:	Alright The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides So what they 're saying is this that the square on that side .  1215449_1232829
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1232829_1233279
*PS0W2:	is thirty six so what 's the length of that side .  1233989_1237589
*PS0W7:	Erm that must be nine .  1237589_1243769
*PS0W2:	No .  1246079_1246529
*PS0W7:	Sorry Aha What then .  1246799_1249039
*PS0W2:	The square root of thirty six What two numbers amount to .  1249039_1252459
*PS0W7:	Six .  1252459_1252579
*PS0W2:	That 's right So the that side must be six centimetres .  1252749_1255529
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1255529_1255999
*PS0W2:	The square is six times six which is thirty six That is four square centimetres .  1256389_1261449
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1261449_1262059
*PS0W2:	It 's four centimetres and the square is sixteen so what must be the area of that square .  1263139_1269409
*PS0W7:	Twenty .  1269409_1269699
*PS0W2:	Twenty Right So you 've got to find what number multiplied together makes twenty .  1270119_1276549
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1276549_1276969
*PS0W2:	So it 's going to the length of that side is going to be the .  1278079_1282749
*PS0W7:	So you square the root of twenty Find the square root of twenty do n't you .  1282749_1286609
*PS0W2:	You find the square root of twenty That 's right And how do you find the square root of twenty .  1286609_1290779
*PS0W7:	Just use that .  1290779_1292239
*PS0W2:	You 'll use that yes .  1292239_1293949
*PS0W7:	Mm mm .  1293949_1294209
*PS0W2:	Are n't you lucky .  1294469_1295129
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1295129_1295479
*PS0W2:	Because I we never had sa we never had erm calculators .  1295629_1298729
*PS0W7:	Wha what did you have to do then .  1299309_1301099
*PS0W2:	So you had to find the square root of by ar either arithmetic by .  1301299_1305089
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1307259_1307349
*PS0W2:	doing in an arithmetic way or you had to use a sca a log table You had to use log tables You had to use this sort of thing like find it up in a mess has n't it Erm I had to go to a table like that which said square roots and I had to look up twenty .  1307349_1338709
*PS0W7:	It 's got on the back actually Back of this book .  1339279_1342869
*PS0W2:	Square roots twe .  1342869_1343819
*PS0W7:	Oh yeah .  1348349_1349159
*PS0W2:	square root is twenty and it 's four point four seven two one .  1349159_1355049
*PS0W7:	Yeah square root .  1355749_1356909
*PS0W2:	That 's right But as you say you can use this .  1356919_1363019
*PS0W7:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	Which one do you push now .  1363019_1364829
*PS0W7:	That one .  1364919_1366849
*PS0W2:	That 's right Four point four seven two .  1366859_1370239
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1370359_1370669
*PS0W2:	So you know that 's well the way you do it So th that 's how you find that So now when you got these three here .  1370729_1376979
*PS0W7:	I 've done these .  1376989_1378199
*PS0W2:	You 've done those have you .  1378209_1379469
*PS0W7:	Yeah look Here are .  1380009_1380579
*PS0W2:	Well let's see that you got them right shall we .  1380619_1382559
*PS0W7:	Six five A .  1382559_1383029
*PS0W2:	So this one you 've got twenty five equals nine plus some number Right .  1383679_1394139
*PS0W7:	Mhm .  1394309_1394539
*PS0W2:	So that is going to be sixteen is n't it .  1396769_1399529
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1399979_1400179
*PS0W2:	No it is n't .  1401909_1402379
*PS0W7:	Yes it is .  1402589_1402879
*PS0W2:	Yes it is sixteen So what 's that gon na be .  1402879_1404889
*PS0W7:	Sixteen to erm square root of sixteen .  1405799_1409189
*PS0W2:	Sixteen .  1409859_1410199
*PS0W7:	is four .  1410199_1410659
*PS0W2:	Four So that 's .  1410659_1411369
*PS0W7:	0 . 
*PS0W2:	gon na be four So C five A have you got four .  1411369_1413409
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1413739_1413819
*PS0W2:	Yes you have Right Now B again that the square root of that is going to equal the square root of that plus the square root of that So you 've got sixteen .  1413819_1425229
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1425929_1426099
*PS0W2:	Or rather sixty four e eighty one equals sixty four plus some number So sixty four from eighty one .  1426099_1439489
*PS0W7:	Gives you six which is erm seventeen so it 's .  1440289_1446249
*PS0W2:	Gives you .  1446249_1446749
*PS0W7:	er seventeen .  1447189_1447759
*PS0W2:	Gives you seventeen So now for the answer to that one .  1447839_1450439
*PS0W7:	The square root of seventeen .  1450439_1451199
*PS0W2:	you want the square root of seventeen which is four point one two Right .  1451199_1457869
*PS0W7:	Mm .  1458099_1458159
*PS0W2:	So C again you 've got eleven elevens what are eleven elevens .  1458489_1465859
*PS0W7:	Er a hundred and twenty one .  1465859_1468209

*PS0W7:	Okay .  1549079_1549169
*PS0W2:	Cos I .  1549979_1550899
*PS0W7:	Is that the hypotenuse Yes .  1558109_1563119
*PS0W2:	Which is the hypotenuse .  1563119_1565039
*PS0W7:	That one .  1565399_1565979
*PS0W2:	Which one .  1566329_1566649

*PS0W2:	Right .  1570329_1570589
*PS0W7:	So so it must be it is erm can I write it down on here .  1572749_1591949
*PS0W2:	I 'll tell you what write it down on paper and then you can copy it into your book when you know you 've got it right How about that .  1592749_1599249
*PS0W7:	Hang on a sec Five point three nine .  1600389_1654649
*PS0W2:	Right I 'll settle for that .  1654989_1656549
*PS0W7:	Is that right the way I 've done it By the way I I did that so I did area of square along the side .  1657369_1663479
*PS0W2:	Well I mean you 've got the right answer so erm .  1665099_1669799
*PS0W7:	Shall I just write shall I copy it in .  1670569_1672689
*PS0W2:	Yes what have you done .  1674579_1675329
*PS0W7:	Erm five equals twenty five mm .  1677059_1685119
*PS0W2:	Five does n't equal twenty five .  1685449_1687829
*PS0W7:	Five fives are twenty five .  1687859_1688799
*PS0W2:	You have n't got five times you 've got five equals twenty five Five square equals twenty five .  1688969_1694129
*PS0W7:	That 's what I 've been doing I meant I mean that .  1694999_1697539
*PS0W2:	Yahhh But if you write that look Five equals twenty five is not true Five squared equals twenty five yes .  1697539_1709559
*PS0W7:	Okay then .  1710069_1710589
*PS0W2:	Right .  1710729_1711079
*PS0W7:	Yeah .  1711079_1711139
*PS0W2:	Be very precise But you should n't ever write five equals twenty five cos it does n't .  1711369_1715549
*PS0W7:	Okay then .  1716089_1716529
*PS0W2:	You mean five squared you mean five times five equals twenty five you 're looking for five squared so that 's the right thing to write Alright .  1716749_1723469
*PS0W7:	Okay That is the hypotenuse is n't it That there .  1740129_1778569
*PS0W2:	Yes Mhm .  1778569_1779409
*PS0W7:	C Do you do ninety nine take twenty five .  1782079_1814069
