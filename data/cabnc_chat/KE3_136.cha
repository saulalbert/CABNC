*MUM:	You can have some 
*CHR:	blow the   (        ) 
*MUM:	You can have some branches that curl back down here too
*CHR:	Mm.
*MUM:	they don't all have to go up.
*JAC:	No.
*MUM:	They can curl back down here.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*CHR:	Mm.
*MUM:	Cos they won't all go up on a tree.
*CHR:	A few gaps   (.) maybe just a little bit coming out.
*MUM:	Mr Who? (.)  ((laugh))

*JAC:	Erm   (.) we washed the car in   (.) today, we   (.) we didn't actually go shopping, no.
*MUM:	No.
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) we just   (.) really thoroughly did the car out   (.) but that's all we did   (.) we didn't go shopping.
*CHR:	You can get a straight twig without anything on it, can't you?
*JAC:	Mhm.
*CHR:	Or you can have twigs with bits joining on together can't you? (.) They do vary.
*MUM:	They go all different ways   (.) twigs.
*CHR:	Yeah   (.) they vary.
*MUM:	They'll be like one another ha.
*CHR:	Mm   (.) and my art's not too good I'm afraid.
*TON:	That's not bad.
*MUM:	What's wrong with your art my love? (.) Is it complications or what? ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Can't draw properly.
*MUM:	 [laughing] The way she said my art's not too good  [] .
*JAC:	 [laughing]  (        )  (.)  (        ) my art  [] .
*MUM:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Funny   (.) yes really hilarious!
*JAC:	 [laughing] Well it sounded like it Christine  [] .
*MUM:	 ((laugh))  (.) Oh dear.
*CHR:	 (        )  (.)  (        ) that twig joins there.
*MUM:	My art!.
*CHR:	No look at it 
*JAC:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	I mean that is suppose to be a tree   (.) does not resemble a tree at all, you'd think it was a   (.) carrot!
*TON:	Let's have a look.
*CHR:	Antlers!
*TON:	These   (.) they don't 
*MUM:	 (        ) 
*TON:	they don't   (.) join onto the trunk like that.
*MUM:	No they go up   (.) thick in thick ones and then come out from the 
*TON:	Mm.
*MUM:	if it was me I'd draw a thick trunk and lots of lines   [laughing] come out from it  [] .
*TON:	Mm.
*MUM:	 (        ) 
*JAC:	You don't I mean you don't see a tree with a flat top with all the branches coming out do you?
*CHR:	Mm   (.) well I can't think of any other way to draw it though.
*MUM:	They come out it in   (.) thick ones and then   (.) the thick ones are on the   (.) thin ones are on the thick ones.
*JAC:	Have you got an old piece of paper?
*CHR:	I'm terrible   (.) let me rub out the entire thing and start all over again, yeah?
*MUM:	Yeah it's the best thing, I find.
*CHR:	Here I go.
*JAC:	And you  (.) branches   (.) start off   (.) what are you going to do?
*MUM:	And rub out.
*CHR:	All of that.
*MUM:	Yes, that's right.
*JAC:	It'll be a mess 
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	Christine.
*TON:	No   (.) get, let   (.) start off   (.) yep   (.) on erm   (.) show you 
*CHR:	What   (.) I've just rubbed it all out.
*TON:	on a bit of paper.
*JAC:	Yep I need a separate bit of paper.
*CHR:	Daddy I have in my bag can you get that out? (.) A little spotted bag.
*MAR:	 ((cough)) 
*JAC:	I can't find a bit that    (        )  (.) Give me the pencil and let me show you.
*CHR:	I'll get   (.) you'll have to go just go right to the back   (.) just at the back   (.) otherwise you're gonna be flipping through millions of pages.
*JAC:	Okay. (.) Can I do it on there?
*CHR:	Yes   (.) yes okay.
*JAC:	Look you start off and you've got   (.) your trunk okay?
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	What haven't you got   (.) you got two or three perhaps   (.) two big ones 
*TON:	Can you turn that up.
*JAC:	coming off at the trunk   (.) see like that
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAC:	and you   (        ) 
*CHR:	Oh I see what you mean now.
*JAC:	another one like that   (.) and then what happens is you've got smaller branches   (.) lots of smaller branches   (.) coming off of piece
*CHR:	Yeah and then it joins up together doesn't it?
*JAC:	and then you've got smaller branches coming off of the smaller branches
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAC:	and it makes twigs.
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	So you've got   (.) an this this branch will keep going   (.) perhaps   (.) until it gets really tiny.
*CHR:	It's incredible cos all the little bits join together I mean what's that?
*TON:	No   (.) they don't they cross over   (.) and they tangle up   (.) but once a branch starts off   (.) it doesn't join on to another one.
*CHR:	I didn't mean that   (.) I meant   (.) when you look at a tree it's sort of got
*TON:	A cris-cross.
*CHR:	yeah sometimes you get a tree like   (.) with a little bit coming off the side
*TON:	Mm.
*CHR:	and then it's sort of joined together onto another branch and then there's a branch there.
*TON:	No   (.) I don' know what you mean.
*CHR:	Er it's hard to explain I can't explain that.
*MUM:	As Daddy says once they come out they don't join onto another.
*TON:	You see that one would sort of 
*CHR:	Mhm.
*TON:	carry on   (.) going and that one would go up behind it.
*JAC:	Look Christine if I draw it 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	as a diagram rather than as a tree.Right you've got one branch
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	you start off with one branch like that
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAC:	now that branch will divide into to two   (.) or you'll get one   (.) one bit coming off the side   (.) you might get another one up here
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAC:	right?So they're going to go   (        ) see then you get other branches coming off of that one
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAC:	the same   (.) and other branches coming off of that one   (.) and other branches coming off of that one   (.) it's sort of gets smaller and smaller and is gets
*CHR:	Mm.
*JAC:	so you   (.) you've got   (.) perhaps two off of there   (.) and then another one off of the side of there   (.) and as you go it gets   (.) it gets sl slightly smaller each time   (.) see what I mean?
*CHR:	Yes   (.) and it comes to just to to the 
*JAC:	to the 
*CHR:	light one then you stop don't you?
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) that's right   (.) see   (.) see what I mean?
*CHR:	Yeah.
*JAC:	It ge it you just sort of keep going until it   (.) stops   (        ) 
*CHR:	Right   (.) I'll clean that up and start again   (.) this is brilliant!
*TON:	Mhm.
*CHR:	Have you seen that?
*MUM:	Yeah.
*CHR:	Mum?
*JAC:	 [laughing] Nun  [] .
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	 [laughing] She can't find the stereo   (.) Oh lovely  [] .
*TON:	 ((laugh)) 
*CHR:	Pulling out one by one oh no   (.) ooh!
*JAC:	The worse thing I've ever done is wax for my legs   (.) I did it once   (.) mhm
*MUM:	I never did it.
*CHR:	What happened?
*MUM:	Did it work then did it?
*JAC:	Yeah it literally   (.) it's like sticking a sticking plaster on your legs and pulling it off.
*MUM:	and tearing it off   (.) urgh!
*JAC:	Only it holds onto the hairs so much that it rips them out   (.) so that you end up with   (.) legs with no hairs on it but   (.) ah! (.) It's best done very quickly. ((laugh)) 
*MUM:	My legs have never been hairy.
*JAC:	Mine are the  (.) only   (.) actually they're not as bad as they used to be   (.) they need doing now but     (        )  (.)  (        ) Daddy's   (        ) so they're not too bad.
*MUM:	No   (.) some people it if their hair's dark and it don't matter what length 
*JAC:	No.
*MUM:	of time   (.) they don't do it.
*JAC:	No mine aren't too bad really it's just that I don't like being    (        )  (.) having said that I had one  (        ) .
*TON:	 ((cough)) 
*CHR:	Mum   (.) so there's my basic trunk, trunks aren't straight aren't they? (.) They never   (.) straight
*JAC:	No.
*CHR:	straight, straight are they? (.) No not sort of   (.) bits sticking out   (.) Windy   (.) Windy   (.) hello darling.
*MUM:	Let her go.
*CHR:	He's beautiful   (.) good boy   (.) yeah   (.) are you a good boy? (.)  (        ) 
*MUM:	Ben   (.) go round there   (.) can't wedge through 
*CHR:	Hello darling.
*MUM:	oh ar alright then   (.) you've got him now!
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	 ((laugh)) 
*MUM:	I'd be in quick   (.) Oh 
*CHR:	 (        ) Windy
*MUM:	think he's a lovely cushion 
*CHR:	cushion 
*MUM:	ha   (.) hey   (.) he's got his cushion back   (.) Eh? (.) Got his cushion back   (.) ah   (.) oh Windy   (.) yeah.
*CHR:	They get them you can do sort of like
*MUM:	Oh Windy   (.) has he got his cushion back? (.) Oh dear   (.) That trunk divided into   (.) two or three different branches 
*CHR:	Yeah 
*TON:	I see 
*CHR:	it's sort of does   (.) that
*JAC:	That's right   (.)  (        ) .
*TON:	I think you need to make that a bit thicker   (.) so it divides into two 
*JAC:	Do you to as well or   (.) will he eat
*CHR:	I don't know what to do there.
*MUM:	I haven't tried to get one.
*TON:	Yeah but there isn't a flat top it divides sort of in the middle 
*MUM:	I don't know anybody    (        )  (        ) 
*TON:	Do see what I mean?
*CHR:	No I don't   (.) a flat top what you on about I haven't got 
*TON:	There isn't a flat top   (.) it divides   (.) sort of 
*CHR:	Eh!
*TON:	down the middle.
*CHR:	I see.
*TON:	Yeah?
*CHR:	horrible    (        )  (.) I gotta rub it out it's no good.
*JAC:	Yeah I suppose eventually you'll have to start giving him one won't you?
*MUM:	Yeah.
*JAC:	Cos otherwise er   (.) it's gonna 
*TON:	No.
*JAC:	lose him.
*CHR:	I'm just rubbing it out a little bit to give me a bit more space
*TON:	Mhm.
*CHR:	if you see what I mean, right   (.) I'll re-draw all that bit in a minute   (.) this is all gonna be sort of black.
*TON:	Right   (.) so if you mark in where you want it to split 
*MUM:	I wonder how he'll grow up.
*CHR:	Like that.
*MUM:	You got you you try it.
*JAC:	Ha ha ah.
*TON:	Down the middle so put the pencil   (.) sort of in the middle
*MUM:	Come and have a cuddle.
*TON:	and draw the   (.) the middle bit first   (.) do you see what I mean?
*CHR:	Mm   (.) like that?
*TON:	Yeah   (.) and the other side.
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) you don't 
*TON:	That's it.
*JAC:	wanna be grown up do you?
*CHR:	Looks like a waterfall ha   (.) then you just do a thicker one don't you?
*TON:	Then you take that and taper down a bit   (.) and then it's gonna split again
*CHR:	And it can split   (.) like that.
*TON:	Mhm.
*JAC:	Have you got used to the feel of him now?
*CHR:	And then does that go round like that?
*MUM:	I don't know.
*JAC:	Basically they feel   (.) just    (.)  (        ) 
*TON:	Mm   (.) you split it down the middle again   (.) so that will go off that way and then that branch go that way   (.) see?
*CHR:	Mm.
*MUM:	 (        )  (        ) when Jack comes in from work   (.) ha ha.
*CHR:	Then 
*TON:	And then it splits again and splits again.
*CHR:	I can't split it again look at the size of that line   (.) I'm gonna have to   (.) oh yeah I see what you mean.
*TON:	Mhm.
*CHR:	That's for my
*TON:	See the branches get smaller and smaller and smaller.
*CHR:	yeah.
*JAC:	That's slightly nice.
*MUM:	Yeah.
*CHR:	I've got   (.) we haven't gotta do any leaves it's just an ordinary tree
*TON:	Mhm.
*CHR:	of Autumn.
*JAC:	A winter tree.
*CHR:	Yeah   (.) and then it goes   (.) up again, yeah?
*TON:	Whatever you like dear   (.) it can bend round and
*CHR:	Whatever you like?
*CHR:	 ((laugh))  (.) it looks quite weird doesn't it? (.) Erm   (.) and I think I may do one in the middle of there   (.) and then leave that s like that.
*TON:	But if you were to split that   (.) one and that one again can't you?
*MUM:	He's ever so stupid he'll 
*CHR:	Oh alright then.
*MUM:	lie down with his head   (.) sideways on the floor and his bottom still up in the air.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*MUM:	 ((laugh)) 
*TON:	No don't get thicker.
*MUM:	Yeah.
*CHR:	Ha?
*TON:	Oh I see that's your
*MUM:	You're a daft dog baby 
*TON:	yeah 
*MUM:	that's what it is   (.) cos you're still a baby really.
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) oh it's lovely to see him not shaking and coming over to you.
*CHR:	Yeah, no   (.) mm.
*MUM:	It's certainly made a difference to him in that four days.
*JAC:	Oh yeah   (.) you're beautiful now.
*CHR:	You can't get any thinner than that.
*JAC:	Yes you are   (.) yeah   (.) you beautiful boy   (.) yeah 
*CHR:	Can you, you can't get any 
*TON:	Mhm.
*CHR:	than that?
*TON:	So now you can work on that one.
*CHR:	That looks weird   (.) Mummy does that look weird?
*JAC:	No   (.) cos you'll fill it in with all the other   (.) branches 
*TON:	Cos you you fill it in 
*CHR:	Yeah.
*TON:	with other branches, you see.
*CHR:	Don't worry about the lines in the middle and things like that because that's   (.) it's all gonna be shaded in.
*JAC:	Give your tummy   (        ) 
*CHR:	So 
*JAC:	yes you are   (.) His tail now when it's down it's still down between his legs but it's li  (.) it's limp isn't it?
*MUM:	Yeah, it's not curled up under.
*JAC:	No it was definitely pulled up under his 
*MUM:	Yes   (.) it's just   (.) down.
*JAC:	Yeah.
*MUM:	Hanging there.
*JAC:	Mm   (.) perhaps it'll go to sleep on his cheek.
*MUM:	Isn't that lovely that other hostage got out.
*JAC:	Oh yeah.
*MUM:	There's only two German ones there now.
*JAC:	Yeah, it's amazing really.
*MUM:	It happened so   (.) quickly hasn't it?
*JAC:	Yeah.
*CHR:	 [singing] Yeah   (.) it's going
*JAC:	Yeah.
*CHR:	it's going   (        ) 
*MUM:	It's we it's once the ball start rolling it
*TON:	Mm.
*MUM:	get's everybody out.
*CHR:	 (        )  (        )  []  (.) Oh I'm gonna split that once more I think.
*MUM:	Stand all that. ((laugh)) 
*JAC:	I like dogs that sit like these   (        ) I must admit.
*MUM:	Yeah, so have I.
*JAC:	 (        )  (.) there's Fred then and Hipner and they all like being cuddled   (.) to   (        ) don't they? (.) lovely   (.) Doesn't he look different to his other parts.
*TON:	They needed to write 
*MUM:	Yes, he does.
*TON:	a bit more   (.) and start making a bit more 
*MUM:	Oh yeah.
*TON:	Three D   (.) mm?
*CHR:	Right   (.) yes
*TON:	And how you can that you could draw   (.) imagine there's a branch
*CHR:	Mm.
*TON:	growing out   (.) that way   (.) and then curving up   (.) see what I mean?
*CHR:	Yes I se  (.) sort of growing up and then
*TON:	Mm   (.) but work so 
*CHR:	like that 
*TON:	behind   (.) so it it's it's growing that way 
*JAC:	Are you gonna come down  (        ) .
*CHR:	Mm.
*MUM:	No.
*TON:	and then up   (.) so you scr draw it starting to coming up like that.
*MUM:	He's that bad in those.
*CHR:	Yeah or you can draw it 
*MUM:	 [shouting] Windy! [] 
*CHR:	going up like those 
*MUM:	 [shouting] Windy! [] 
*CHR:	on the bottom   (.) then 
*MUM:	No!
*CHR:	up like that and as it goes up it gets thinner 
*MUM:	 [shouting] Oi! [] 
*CHR:	and thinner and thinner
*TON:	That's right.
*CHR:	like
*MUM:	No, I do it 
*CHR:	 (        ) 
*MUM:	but I do it very   (.) artfully and turn my back.
*TON:	It's that.
*CHR:	That   (.) so it looks as though it's going away.
*TON:	Then you can split   (.) split it several times as well.
*CHR:	Oh   (.) mm.
*MUM:	What did they tell you   (.) about Fred and me?
*CHR:	I reckon that looks really sort of weird   (.) I don't know why.
*TON:	Well draw 
*JAC:	I don't know.
*TON:	It'll look less   (.) the more branches you draw 
*CHR:	Windy   (.) hello darling.
*MUM:	I'll talk to somebody else then.
*TON:	the more real   (.) it will look like.
*CHR:	Yeah   (.) doesn't look 
*TON:	Come on.
*CHR:	too realistic at the moment.
*TON:	Well you wanna   (.) split it as often as you can.
*CHR:	Mm   (.) you saw where he had his thing done.
*JAC:	Mm   (.) slightly it's just a little so   (.) when he's head 
*CHR:	Oh yeah 
*JAC:	just a little tiny    (        )  (.) so that takes precedence 
*CHR:	Oh my god!
*JAC:	cos er   (.) it doesn't get in the way.
*MUM:	Ah! (.) occupied isn't he?
*JAC:	Yeah   (.) engaged    [laughing]  (.) you had it  [] .
*MUM:	I'll talk to somebody else then.
