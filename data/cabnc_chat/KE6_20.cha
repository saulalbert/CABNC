*WEN:	She said she didn't hear them. •_•
        Yesterday afternoon, well it started off on Saturday  and he ended up outside that house  I'm outside ours  there was three cars in the drive which you cannot get! •_•
        Right? •_•
        So one went right across the pavement. •_•
*SAN:	Terrible! •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*WEN:	Now added to that  by our wall  there was this ruddy great lorry again  it's a great bit thing with an open back right? •_•
        a long •_•
*SAN:	Yeah. •_•
*WEN:	open back. •_•
        So they park that up on the  pavement outside our wall  didn't come to our gate  but, and then  didn't it obstruct Alan's because they had it on the pavement, so anybody going down the pavement •_•
*SAN:	Out in the road. •_•
*WEN:	had to go out in the road! •_•
        So I said to Mick  I'm sure that's illegal. •_•
        Well he don't know! •_•
        Anyway, so  banging doors  people galore! •_•
        So come yesterday  there was  people going and all this business  and it ended up  with just  her car and one red one  then the red one goes out  she goes with the woman  they're outside there  two of those bloody King Charles! •_•
        And they were in the front room going wild! •_•
        Then the afternoon, we'd had lunch  anyway  I'd got up out the chair, I was so bloody livid! •_•
        I got up out the chair and er  went out the front door  and  I said to her for God's sake it's Sunday! •_•
        What do you mean? •_•
        I said well hell well you've got them going in there full pelt  you don't go in there to stop it! •_•
        And she said I can't hear them when I'm outside. •_•
        And I said, everybody can hear when they're walking down the pavement! •_•
        And er  I said to her, you know, you must realise that  when we're in here we can hear, no, you'd of thought they was in  around our feet! •_•
        Well I can't hear them! •_•
        She had the door open at the moment  with these bloody dogs yapping  and she looked at me and said I can't hear them! •_•
        So, I said to her right, I said  you wanna be in here  live in here  I said I'll invite you in! •_•
        And she went in and shut the door! •_•
        Well , that's it! •_•
        Mick said to me, what did she say? •_•
        What did she say? •_•
        So I told him! •_•
        And I said, you know, quite honestly Sandra she does nothing  to stop these dogs. •_•
*SAN:	She's deaf is she? •_•
*WEN:	Well I wonder if she's got a hearing problem, she'd never says she has. •_•
        But you think come on! •_•
        I mean ! •_•
*WEN:	I mean she had the door, the front door open! •_•
        At that •_•
*SAN:	I'm surprised she couldn't even hear! •_•
*WEN:	Oh! •_•
*SAN:	I mean we have double glazing. •_•
        The idea if you've got double glazing •_•
*WEN:	So have I! •_•
*SAN:	And yes, I can hear at my front door next door but one  the window. •_•
        If somebody goes up their path and she barks you can hear it! •_•
*WEN:	Well, I said to Mick, he's just got up now. •_•
        Oh, I said to him look  I said she obviously a person that takes no notice , but she lives out in the country. •_•
        Because she's in there! •_•
        When it goes on inside, she's in there! •_•
*SAN:	I'm sure she can't hear it. •_•
*WEN:	She said I can't  •_•
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	hear it when I'm out here. •_•
        So I said, well that's it! •_•
        I know he don't this Sandra  and I don't care a sod! •_•
        Bloody had a gutful of her! •_•
        I mean, for a start I don't think she should have four dogs shout out  in there all the hours that they are! •_•
        And er  I'm not saying they're ill treated  cos they're probably not, but there's different ways of ill treating isn't there? •_•
*SAN:	I mean they don't look scruffy  •_•
*WEN:	Certainly! •_•
*SAN:	you get fed but that's about it! •_•
        And they're in the warm you can't say they're •_•
*WEN:	No. •_•
*SAN:	they're not . •_•
*WEN:	Well I haven't seen her. •_•
        I saw her that one night look  take one of those little ones  going up the road  but I've, I mean  . •_•
        All these people there this weekend and I've not seen one dog go out! •_•
        And I mean you don't just stand at your window  but  at some time or other •_•
*SAN:	Well she's probably sharing a room  with the dogs ! •_•
*WEN:	Well they must be! •_•
*SAN:	It's like living in a dog's kennel! •_•
*WEN:	It's only a three bedroomed bloody semi after all! •_•
*SAN:	Well like living in a dog's  •_•
*WEN:	Yeah! •_•
*SAN:	kennel! •_•
*WEN:	Yep! •_•
        So I said to him, right  I said we either  go  I mean I keep saying to him you've gotta do something about this! •_•
        Either this plaster board holes or whatever the house  well the trouble is it costs  such a lot of money •_•
*SAN:	Yeah. •_•
*WEN:	you know, and we are, we have got that insulating lot. •_•
        Oh it's  she's cantankerous! •_•
        She's  whatever you say  don't wanna know! •_•
        Well I was bloody livid! •_•
        I was really livid! •_•
*SAN:	Who's the other side  of her? •_•
*WEN:	Well the bloke  but I mean he's not attached. •_•
        But he's out. •_•
        He's out •_•
*SAN:	I was gonna say the people on the other I know  •_•
*WEN:	No! •_•
*SAN:	they're not joined, so the other side never  •_•
*WEN:	But he he always at work or somewhere! •_•
        You know, I mean he's only a single bloke. •_•

*DOR:	Yeah. •_•
*WEN:	They blocked the pavement, there was three cars in the drive which you cannot get! •_•
*DOR:	Yeah. •_•
*WEN:	They blocked the pavement and there was this bloody great lorry  up against the path so anybody coming down or up the road  had to walk into the road  or , cross the road to the other side! •_•
        But yesterday afternoon  I mean, it was Sunday afternoon after all! •_•
*DOR:	Yeah! •_•

        And then she turned round and said well I don't hear it! •_•
        And I said, no but you have the door open •_•
*DOR:	 ((laugh))

        Very fabulous! •_•
        Beautiful! •_•
        Even in those seats we had were . •_•

        The seats were fantastic! •_•
        That's the one I liked best, the man in the blue. •_•
        Yeah, that's the one Bev liked liked best  and the merry-go-round that's just in there  cos of the fair •_•
*SAN:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	and there's the one that linked right round. •_•
        I mean that was  they  dimmed the lights so that they're not all erm  silvery grey  at one stage. •_•
        I mean, it was a job to say which one  •_•
*SAN:	I was gonna say,it's that one. •_•
*WEN:	Yeah, that's the one that went over  •_•
*SAN:	And then   •_•
*WEN:	that was the fair. •_•
        But erm  but the whole the point about this show was  three partners had stopped near the door  the whole ice was covered with people who  and er  apart from the juggler and you know  bits  •_•
*SAN:	Yeah. •_•
*WEN:	like that, but  but that isn't the woman. •_•
        That isn't the woman. •_•
        It was a blonde haired woman. •_•
*SAN:	Oh! •_•
*WEN:	But obviously she was the star when they . •_•
        But the actual  main star    is this one. •_•
        He was . •_•
        Lovely when they ! •_•
        You know, the production? •_•
*SAN:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	I'm sure they did do it well. •_•
        All that time  must of had a ball! •_•
        I thought that was   so this is , we had a bad night's sleep! •_•
        I would have said while I was putting out my washing cos I did it last night on purpose for the gas man coming in. •_•
        They're all asleep next door! •_•
*SAN:	Yeah, they don't have to get up! •_•
*WEN:	No! •_•
        No! •_•
        Anyway,and I have one for Connie, that's the little girl over . •_•
*DOR:	Oh right! •_•
*WEN:	Yeah. •_•
        Was one, there's two now. •_•
        And  so she's on medicine. •_•
        Erm  I know, like you do these  and er  I mean I, I've heard about Alan and Sue for a long time, I know they're having a lot of bother, you know with the  decorating and all that. •_•
        But she's got in there, well I hope Alan and Sue can settle now. •_•
        Apparently, a lot of the trouble they had was her father! •_•
        He says  him to go to work and look after the kid. •_•
        Well they got two kids now but , it was then, you know? •_•
        And er  Alan apparently wants to go to Spain  and Alan said well I'm not bloody working there, as he said, I don't wanna earn money like that! •_•
        And course, they had,with us you know  at one time  and now they've got that  holiday again now, so I mean none of them would of been cheap  when they did it. •_•
*DOR:	No. •_•
*WEN:	And er  I didn't realise that  you know, the father had  . •_•
        said about it. •_•
*SAN:	Mm. •_•
*WEN:	I didn't bloody know, I  worked it out. •_•
        Well he knows he can er, start off •_•
*DOR:	Without any hassle. •_•
*SAN:	Oh! •_•
*WEN:	Oh! •_•
        Doreen? •_•
*DOR:	Oh! •_•

*DOR:	Oh lovely! •_•
*WEN:	Fifteen  fifteen quid seats we had. •_•
        Two. •_•
*SAN:	Oh! •_•
*WEN:	And we had a nice coach this time. •_•
*SAN:	 (        ) 
*WEN:	Oh! •_•
        Somebody called Freeway Which is a lot of •_•
*SAN:	Kingston. •_•
*WEN:	Oh yeah, Kingston, yeah. •_•
        It was Kingston. •_•
*DOR:	And you didn't look out the    •_•
*WEN:	No. •_•
        And it was a beautiful warm  comfortable. •_•
        Last time we went up,last year was when erm     no heating like. •_•
*SAN:	Yeah. •_•
*WEN:	And it was an old coach. •_•
        I mean, alright the heating didn't go wrong  but it wasn't that, the coach itself was  you know, really rattled! •_•
        Rattled all the time! •_•
*SAN:	Yeah some are quite . •_•
        They've got a, I think they've one  ones. •_•
*WEN:	We had one  good one when we went to Bournemouth. •_•
*SAN:	They've got a double decker they use for the school run and that is absolutely on it's last legs by the look of it! •_•
*WEN:	Yeah, we had a double decker one time when we went to Bournemouth but I can't remember who it was. •_•
        But that wasn't  old. •_•
        Cos that was when Helen and  Tommy  's erm  wife left their clothes on there thinking it was staying there but it never, it came back. •_•
        It was on another run, we got another coach  come back  so they had to go out to where the one it was to •_•
*SAN:	 ((laugh)) 
*WEN:	pick up their clothes! •_•
        But I tell you what though that erm  ice rink place  it wasn't half full! •_•
        They fill them up! •_•
        Masses and masses amounts of people! •_•
        But that is, if you go up under your own steam I mean even dearer than the way we did it. •_•
*SAN:	Mind you it's getting to the end of the run as well isn't it now? •_•
