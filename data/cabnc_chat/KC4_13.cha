*FRE:	Yeah. 
*NON:	Ain't there any buses?

*NON:	Oh do they? 
*FRE:	and the buses, you know, the special buses run, no, the school doesn't run them. 
*NON:	No. 
*FRE:	But because there's a demand for it, the buses run to the school and pick them up at the school.

*NON:	And people weren't paying him. 
*FRE:	Oh yeah, this is it. 
*NON:	And he's still, one bloke went bankrupt, and he only got   (  ) amount off him, he's telling me the other week, he's, he's still five thousand pounds owing to him, though, work  he did twelve months ago   
*FRE:	 Course it is yeah.  Ah, it's hopeless isn't it? (10.0)  
*NON:	Well there's only one way to deal with them  (  ) , pay you on a monthly basis, or stop working for them. 
*FRE:	Oh yes, yeah  (.)  
*NON:	But when he went to Holland, his bill was twelve thousand pounds owing to him, (  ) . 
*FRE:	 Was it?   (.) Are they bringing the horses back? 
*NON:	Oh I, I, I just, I don't, (  ) not to get rid of them bloody horses, alright I know what horses cost. 
*FRE:	Well they are damned  expensive. 
*NON:	 Well  of course they are and bringing them over here must cost them   (  ) five hundred quid. 
*FRE:	Yeah, it must've cost him that to take them over there. 
*NON:	Sell them to the knackers yard. ((laugh))  
*FRE:	Wouldn't get much for them there. 
*NON:	Eh? 
*FRE:	Wouldn't get much for them  there. 
*NON:	 Aye, but  you haven't got to pay out have you? 
*FRE:	Oh no, no. 
*NON:	What the hell does it matter, why pay about five hundred pounds and, and that's two horses I've got, that's a thousand pounds. 
*FRE:	Yeah. Well they've got to go into quarantine, and that'll cost them won't he? 
*NON:	Don't have to go in quarantine horses don't. 
*FRE:	Don't they, oh.

*FRE:	They've got, they've, they've got, they haven't  got the   
*NON:	 But you see   
*FRE:	hooves, their hooves are not   (  ) . 
*NON:	 Charlie  , is on his last legs, has been for years and, might as well have him put down, (  ) as that Nick keep saying, I think I'll have to have him put down he, when  he takes him for a walk he collapses. ((laugh))   
*FRE:	  (  ) .  Well, have him put down over there  
*NON:	But they have to pay for the schooling over there, you know. 
*FRE:	Yes, I  (  ) . 
*NON:	I don't think Nick realised any of this when he went there, I don't think he looked into it enough. 
*FRE:	No. Don't eh, do the, do the Dutch people have to pay for the schooling? The children's schooling? 
*NON:	I don't know whether it's only a   (  ) English. 
*FRE:	Could be that. 
*NON:	Mm. I know, I don't know, I've no idea. 
*FRE:	They don't pay anything here do they? 
*NON:	No, no, no, no charge for schools here at all. 
*FRE:	Well you see they're always talking about what we don't get in this country, they don't tell you what they don't bloody get abroad. 
*NON:	 Yes  (  ) .  I don't know what their income tax is like is, (  ) . 
*FRE:	Well I've got no idea. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	I mean, I, I just know nothing about it, I know nothing about it at all. I mean the only country I spent a lot of time in, in, in Europe is Austria, and then I only stopped in remote villages, you know, more or less, so er, I mean they rely on eh, tourist trade, they rely on tourist trade, where, where I've 
*NON:	Eh? 
*FRE:	They rely on tourist trade. 
*NON:	 Oh yes. 
*FRE:	 In Austria  , they don't absolute in the  (  ) , I mean I know nothing about their industrial places at all. 
*NON:	I don't know their industrial 
*FRE:	I don't, I don't go to the towns or 
*NON:	 (  ) Holland, can to see  (  ) , look to me as if there were plenty of it when I was there. 
*FRE:	Oh I   (  ) plenty of industry at the moment, yeah. But I mean what the pay relative to us the cost of living and everything else, I don't know. 
*NON:	I don't think the cost of living is any cheaper than it is here, from what I can gather. 
*FRE:	Mm, well the cost of living is certainly no cheaper in Austria than it is here. I mean, I don't know what sort of taxes they have on eh, on drink and that sort of thing, but I think Austria is more or less the same  same sort of tax. 
*NON:	 I don't know whether  they have to pay income tax or what they have to do. 
*FRE:	Oh they're bound, I think they're, well, I don't know whether they thought 
*NON:	It's only   (  ) not going to stay, she's coming back. 
*FRE:	They have all sorts of local taxes and that, you know. 
*NON:	 Do they? 
*FRE:	 Yes.  The, well that's if in place of their age, but their local taxes they, they collect from everybody, you go into a restaurant 
*NON:	Oh yes I notice  (  ) . 
*FRE:	I'm, I'm not talking about VAT now, I'm talking about local tax. 
*NON:	 No, no  , yeah. 
*FRE:	So everybody who, who uses the services at a place, pays for it, you know. Don't know if you get it on hotel bills, I think they have to pay something, yes. On hotel bills, they don't, but usually they put it, including local tax, or something like, they always use to show it separately at one time, it's a percentage, but now, very often your bill just shows it as a, including local tax. 
*NON:	Aye. 
*FRE:	But, oh I don't know. They're always knocking the government in this country, it's not much   (  ) the government are, are they? Somebody's knocking them, whatever, ha, whatever   says. ((laugh))
