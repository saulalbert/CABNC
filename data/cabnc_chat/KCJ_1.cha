*PAT:	mm, mm  (.) 
*JAM:	you just cannot seem to get it out of your
*PAT:	that's what I said 
*JAM:	system you know, it's so, it's still hanging around in ya
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	you know, er, I don't think salt and food help
*PAT:	oh well it doesn't does it?
*JAM:	either what you do, now what you do
*PAT:	This is the thing 
*JAM:	you do not what's been wrong, what's been wrong 
*PAT:	exactly 
*JAM:	so I mean er, you know  (.) 
*PAT:	because let's face it, what suits one doesn't always suit another 
*JAM:	No 
*PAT:	I mean I could say well I could go on a diet, but, er and keep on this sort of thing like Margaret does you know 
*JAM:	Yeah 
*PAT:	but, erm, you see the point is that you're not, what suits one doesn't suit another
*JAM:	no   (.) another thing an'all   (.) we are sat here, you know, in the corner near the fire 
*PAT:	Aha 
*JAM:	I'm sure I'm getting a lot of fumes coming back out er 
*PAT:	you said that a couple of weeks ago
*JAM:	I mean   (.) yesterday after I had me dinner I dropped off to sleep for a couple of hours cos 
*PAT:	that could cause feeling   (        ) 
*JAM:	 (        ) and you're awake now
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	Last night   (.) I was sitting er what was I watching? (.) Forget what was on now
*PAT:	It was that murder mystery thing on last night wasn't it?Er, (        ) that was interesting that, that I, I liked that, him good that   (        ) 
*JAM:	Oh, I missed it, I knew there was something, that's when I fell asleep 
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	I fell asleep just after eight o'clock and I was er, well after ten when I woke up
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	and I was saying to myself, why should I be dropping off to sleep like this, it's gotta be fumes you know
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	like Jimmy next door, he's always dropping off and he got a vent put in at the bottom of his door, they took the pipe   (        ) out and behind   (.) you had a big open
*PAT:	yeah
*JAM:	which should of been bricked right the way in
*PAT:	that one's got a brick opening like that, that isn't bricked in
*JAM:	No, well that's supposed to be bricked right in, so it doesn't allow the fumes to accumulate inside 
*PAT:	it's it's a good size   (        ) as well 
*JAM:	Yeah 
*PAT:	that size
*JAM:	and that's what they've done, all then that   (        ) done ripped it 
*PAT:	mm, mm 
*JAM:	they clamped a big label on, well they didn't clamp one on ours so I take it was 
*PAT:	mm, mm 
*JAM:	supposed to be alright
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	but over the years you sit there and ya   (.) you know
*PAT:	well it must be the fumes
*JAM:	yeah
*PAT:	and what this thing up   (.) what's that up there?
*JAM:	in the summer it doesn't happen.Well that's supposed to be a vent 
*PAT:	Er, that's the vent is it?
*JAM:	it carried the fumes away
*PAT:	Oh I see
*JAM:	any surplus fumes around
*PAT:	aha, have, have you got one like that?
*JAM:	Oh aye but when the bloke went next door to Jimmy's, he, he said where's your vent and Jimmy says there it is up there, ah, and he got up there
*PAT:	I thought
*JAM:	he says I see you've got a towel up there
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	regarding a fire it's no good whatsoever, he says your trouble you're not getting a draught from your
*PAT:	yeah, aha
*JAM:	from your front door coming through and carrying the fumes away 
*PAT:	cos it'd have to be circulating around wouldn't it?
*JAM:	this part of the fire, he says, Jimmy says well I'll put a label on it then, well   (        ) why don't ya?You're supposed to break a   (        ) 
*PAT:	well that's commonsense 
*JAM:	he said well that's the trouble you could break the 
*PAT:	I would say that's dangerous 
*JAM:	then he says you want a vent in the bottom of your door 
*PAT:	Door aye, erm
*JAM:	so when, when they came the three of them
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	Ginger
*PAT:	
*JAM:	
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	he had a lot to say and Jimmy lost his temper with him, you know, and he said look, (        ) 
*PAT:	I'm not surprised yeah, mm, mm
*JAM:	forget it says
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	on your way he says, I'll get the job done, pay for it and I'll phone you up and you'll have to pay me
*PAT:	 ((laugh)) 
*JAM:	oh, ee
*PAT:	oh that'll be a different kettle of fish 
*JAM:	and er 
*PAT:	wouldn't it?
*JAM:	Hmm, he's wife says, he says, ooh, er, she was   (        ) when he, went in the back   (        ) says I'll be honest, yeah he says you're minding the right  (        ) , ooh he says er they wanna get erm you know and   (        ) 
*PAT:	mm, mm 
*JAM:	so he went back and he says er, oh he says er   (.) he says oh dear like, he says well carry on he says   (.) I'll have to take the door off, so he says can you give a hand to hold it, cos he had to cut er   (.) this er like and all grown   (        ) at the bottom of the door you know with
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	six inch  (        ) 
*PAT:	put one of them metal things in
*JAM:	and you put a grid on each side like a plastic grid, you know 
*PAT:	oh yeah, mm, mm I know
*JAM:	and there was only these er little screws, more like a nail with a, a little spiral on
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	and what you doing, you didn't screw them in you just break them in
*PAT:	oh yeah
*JAM:	and the spiral grips the wood you know
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	so he says I tell he says, er, he put the card up where the machine is, which he bore a hole in, I've got one of them mach er cutters, you know, a, a saw with a little braid on
*PAT:	oh yeah
*JAM:	and you can cut all different shapes you know 
*PAT:	mm, mm mm, mm
*JAM:	and he, when you drill a hole in the corner   (.) each corner and he just put it on he just oh it were real lovely and it was as simple as that
*PAT:	ah yes yes, yeah, aha 
*JAM:	he didn't clear, clear the hole or nowt he didn't
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	when he put the grid in that, that caused  (        ) 
*PAT:	I see
*JAM:	you know, took an hour down and he just got that done, but I, I've meant to ask him if those have made any difference, you know, having done in 
*PAT:	yes 
*JAM:	the, griding that brick in
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	but er, that is the trouble, half of these are not been put in properly and the fumes are coming back over
*PAT:	well it, it could cause the   (        ) many a   (        ) couldn't it?
*JAM:	and that's, I'm sure I put   (        ) over the years
*PAT:	Mm
*JAM:	where you're sitting in and she used to nod away 
*PAT:	I know she used to say that
*JAM:	aye, and er, when you wake up ooh you're   (        ) your throat's pouring, you're hot you've gotta get up 
*PAT:	Stands to reason doesn't it?
*JAM:	and stand at the back
*PAT:	That's right
*JAM:	the, you know to cool off   (.) what I do know before time, I woke up   (.) er   (.) phew the   (        ) you know
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	and lovely, I just woke up, er a couple of minutes before then the insurance lad come   (.) cos when I only, he should of come yesterday and I waited in but I couldn't, you know when I opened the door I says   (.) I, I he says, you know   (        ) 
*PAT:	aha, mm, mm 
*JAM:	 (        ) where you been, I says where you been, aye he says aye he says, my fault he says I didn't get round did I?So, this tiler were there with that you know, I says well why, you know   (.) and er   (.) I went back in and I turned the fire off altogether
*PAT:	Well it's sensible cos it's certainly   (        ) 
*JAM:	cos it wasn't, it wasn't that cold you know in the room, so I says well I, I wanna create more fumes, which one am I locking up?
*PAT:	it seems fairly warm   (        ) I still think it's nice and warm
*JAM:	Well you don't get much draught cos the fr well the front door see that's the   (        ) door here
*PAT:	yeah, mm, mm
*JAM:	you come in our front door there, that was a passage, when you get a draught from the front door, it passes this door and it goes straight to the back, down the stairs and back 
*PAT:	it's what you call straight through to the very end of the   (        ) mm, mm
*JAM:	you see
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	door, one door to another door
*PAT:	that's right
*JAM:	you get a straight through draught, from the front door through the passage, then it doesn't   (        ) into here
*PAT:	not do
*JAM:	and then it goes through to the back, now his, although it looks
*PAT:	similar
*JAM:	the same as our house   (.) when you open the door here
*PAT:	mm
*JAM:	his front door, the same, you've got er the stairs going up there
*PAT:	mm
*JAM:	but, when you go into the passage   (.) his door, he's got the door into the front room, same as ours, on the left, but when you get into the bottom of the passage, there's a brick wall in front of ya, and it comes round and his door to the back dining room is on this side here
*PAT:	oh yeah, mm
*JAM:	so he doesn't get a straight through draught like me
*PAT:	no you not do
*JAM:	by having that wall at the bottom 
*PAT:	that's right of course 
*JAM:	the draught always follows where there a, you know, two doors
*PAT:	mm, mm
*JAM:	two windows open
*PAT:	that's true  (.) 
*JAM:	but when ya, when you stand at the front door and er there's a blower breeze   (        ) and it's cold, if you put your hand round the door like that, you can feel a draught, you can feel it colder than the   (        ) you know and the letter box, the draught   (.) but if you take that and put a curtain up, it'll keep the cold out, you've stopped the draught so you're gonna win 
*PAT:	The draught from that's, yeah so you're not sure whether you're doing the right thing or not
*JAM:	Yeah so you know 
*PAT:	so it's true mm, mm
*JAM:	I said I dunno what to do for the best so, I just leave things the way they are and er hopefully that er you get some warm days where you needn't have the fire on, so you don't have fumes you know 
*PAT:	true mm, mm
*JAM:	if 
*PAT:	well you're better again Jim, you've got the fire er so you put the fire, you put the fire off, well this central heating comes from the back of that fire doesn't it, so if you've got the central heating on and you've got it on full 
*JAM:	Aye 
*PAT:	blast for the water, won't you get the fumes just the same as what you do from the fire?
*JAM:	No, because because the fire at the back is   (.) actually at the bottom of the chimney 
*PAT:	Ah I see yeah, yeah 
*JAM:	if this here is in the room innit?
*PAT:	mm, that's right
*JAM:	So you'll have fumes 
*PAT:	of course it is that's right and so, where the fumes from the central heating 
*JAM:	coming back through the side here 
*PAT:	go?By the side here
*JAM:	They got your central heating for your water
*PAT:	Yeah
*JAM:	in, behind the wall there
*PAT:	yes of course that's right and that's in the front 
*JAM:	you know the fuse 
*PAT:	it's come   (        ) 
*JAM:	oh your fuse is all at the back the 
*PAT:	yeah
