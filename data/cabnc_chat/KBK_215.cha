*CHR:	I'd be intrigued to know what those other two couples who were not informed about the cancelled christening feels. •242467_243045•
*NOR:	Yes  •243088_243115•
*CHR:	Or not unless they join in wholeheartedly with the other lot. •243290_243805•
*NOR:	Perhaps they turned up outside, looked in and saw nobody they knew and went away again. •244167_244990•
        I can ask Mary when I see  •244990_245566•
*CHR:	Mhm. •246116_246134•
        Has it been said that they hope to repeat the experience or ? •246134_246395•
*NOR:	I think they're more concerned that the baby has an operation now. •246455_246929•
*CHR:	What what is the situation there? •246929_247151•
*NOR:	Some time in June. •247151_247248•
        I expect they are waiting to called. •247399_247661•
*LYN:	You like some more coffee? •247991_248332•
*CHR:	Yes please. •248355_248415•
