*CAR:	Is there a lot of difference between  fishing in the evening? •_•
*ADA:	I don't know, I've not fished there in the evening, yet. •_•
*CAR:	That's true. •_•
*ADA:	This'll be my first  attempt  I would imagine  that it won't make a lot of difference  I could be wrong. •_•
*CAR:	Have you now learnt how to do this tying or do you have to go and see Terry every time? •_•
*ADA:	Erm  I think I've learnt how to do it, it's  fairly straightforward  but er  him having tied the leader on for me  I won't have to  go back to him anyway for quite some time. •_•
*CAR:	So you weren't concentrating when you were watching with him? •_•
*ADA:	I don't think so,the point is I'm not going to be called to tie a knot like this again  for maybe three weeks and then by then I'll make things up  it was really more for convenience than sitting down trying to work it out myself  so you know . •_•
*CAR:	Is there not a book of  angling knots? •_•
*TOB:	It means there must places doesn't it? •_•
*ADA:	No he's just practising at the moment lovey  he's practising his swing  but I agree if he stood that distance he wouldn't be able to hit the ball would he would you. •_•
*CAR:	It wouldn't reach it would it? •_•
*ADA:	He's right in the middle of the fairway though, it's a nice looking shot he's got to play isn't it? •_•
*TOB:	Mm. •_•
*ADA:	Oh this one isn't so nice  with all this sand. •_•
*CAR:	Oh look at all that sand. •_•
*ADA:	Ooh  well that was good wasn't it? •_•
*TOB:	Mhm. •_•
*ADA:	Clever boy. •_•
*TOB:	Clever. •_•
*ADA:	There we are and he'll go with the man who was practising his swing  what's the matter with him now  come on get on with it. •_•
*TOB:	Come on get on with it, ooh. •_•
*ADA:	Now that's Mark . •_•
*CAR:	Is it? •_•
*TOB:	How did you know? •_•
*ADA:	Cos I know what he looks like  it'll be like looking at you and saying that's Toby  cos I know what you look like as well  do you think? •_•

*ADA:	Ooh just stayed on the green  he's not pleased with it. •_•
*CAR:	Ooh. •_•
*TOB:	Why isn't he? •_•
