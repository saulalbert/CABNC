I know it's not the safest investment but it never was the   (.) safest   (.) investment.It was a   (.) at the time it was a   (.) I'd got the money and it was a bit of a speculation.But unfortunately it's not quite worked out   (.) to plan. (.) But I mean if  (.) 
*ANN:	If it, if if 
*STU:	I mean even with the market being depressed there's still gonna be eight hundred pounds in there. (.) 
*ANN:	So it's
