*NOR:	Has it left him with any impairments?
*CHR:	 (        ) say.Say at all, I didn't ask.Erm, but it's obviously been a very trying time for them.

*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	No, I envisaged when I bought those superb places that they would cover the fence.Oh, look at  (        ) .
*NOR:	Mm. (.)

*NOR:	Mm.

*NOR:	 (        ) .They're chili grapes.

*NOR:	The lavatera has to be put in a sunny spot, I think it'll have to go
*CHR:	 (        )  ((sigh)) Sorry not over there.
*NOR:	Next to that bush, (        ) .
*CHR:	There's already a hyperathan there, which Willy over chopped, it is a beautiful plant.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	There's no room for it.
*NOR:	 (        ) .They grow six feet tall.
*CHR:	Well, it needs a darn big space then, doesn't it?
*NOR:	I wouldn't be able to see it in the  (        ) .
*CHR:	Well I would recommend
*NOR:	Mm.
*CHR:	that you put it behind a save bush, chop that azalea bush, stick it back there, that'll keep the broom coming in.
*NOR:	You could put it along side that erm, if you put it stuck like that, it'll need staking, put it on the wall on the fence.
*CHR:	It doesn't need staking surely.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	I don't think so.Hasn't got a stake in there has it?
*NOR:	Yeah at the bottom.
*CHR:	Oh in the pot I mean, now.
*NOR:	It's not very big yet.
*CHR:	Weren't   (        ) taken?Right, I'm quite confident.Shame those   (        ) coming up, some of them purple.
*NOR:	Why?
*CHR:	I suppose they'll be alright when the iris disappear.Actually it's red and pink ones   (        ) that's rather nice.Very pleased at those original gerania 
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Not too sure.Used to come up purple as well as pink.This is a lovely colour of iris just here isn't it?
*NOR:	Mm. (        ) 
*CHR:	Why not have the lavatera in there, instead of the tree?
*NOR:	No, no, no, no, no, no, too untidy.
*CHR:	Mm   (.) Have you enjoyed the wallflowers this year?
*NOR:	Yes.
*CHR:	Mm.I think I'll be happier to get back to the   (        ) traditional gold and yellows and browns on wallflowers.
*NOR:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	Yeah.They'll certainly be colourful.
*NOR:	 (        )
