*DOR:	June 
*MAR:	June 
*DOR:	I took her class on Friday afternoon

*TIM:	mind the pips, the  pips   
*DOR:	 every time  I got to them they had about twenty odd teachers there at the  (  )  
*MAR:	No, but  (  )  
*DOR:	the last teacher will be 
*MAR:	Oh 
*DOR:	they wanted me for the whole day of Friday but I said I'm sorry I can only do you half day if you're interested, they were, they were desperate. 
*MAR:	Weren't  (  )  
*DOR:	No they wouldn't be when I'm des  when they're desperate, everybody rings me when I'm   (  )  ((laugh))  
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	well I don't want too much, see what I mean 
*MAR:	Mm 
*DOR:	having told them to stay at home with Tim, I don't want to be 
*MAR:	it's not fair to him, I mean when he's old enough to understand 
*DOR:	Well it's quite fun just going off for the odd day cos then he goes off to see Ian, he enjoys that   (.) but it was two afternoons last week cos I did Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon 
*MAR:	It's not bad really  normally   
*DOR:	 I've a  , well she's dumped hers on me 
*MAR:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	I mean she's got two children to dump on me so, I don't feel bad about that   (.) in, that we know, we decided that's what we, we didn't mind doing and there no trouble, if fact they're less trouble  cos they're together than they are   
*TIM:	 You going to go teaching? 
*DOR:	no, we're just talking about when I did last week   (.) remember when I went teaching last week and you went to Ian's house didn't you? Went in two  afternoons   
*MAR:	 Has Martin  got chickenpox then? 
*DOR:	Yeah   (.) anyhow I think she's hoping to come to   (  ) tomorrow   (.) cos erm, idea in the air that on Maundy Thursday instead of having an ordinary mums and toddlers we'll have a   (  ) in church for half an hour and then a run around cups of coffee with the big toys in the hall, (  ) a good idea 
*MAR:	Mm 
*DOR:	That'll be a nice idea, it's a bit tricky, you remember the Chris   (  ) what we did at Christmas, that went really well, and we thought perhaps something similar book for Easter, yeah, don't know what we'll do but    (  )  (.) cos people like John and  (  ) , so he's not teaching full time, in fact some of the schools have holiday aren't they? 
*MAR:	Mm   (.) that's why I thought you wasn't doing anything on that day, (  )   
*DOR:	 Well she wasn't going to  and then the elections got in the way. 
*MAR:	Got to, are we having that thing? 
*DOR:	Well we still don't know about that, and it said in the paper that they're having election in the church hall, nobody in the church knows about it. 
*MAR:	Mm, can't get it if they don't  (  )  
*DOR:	So if they don't act, they've had it, but, if they wrote and asked quick then  (  )  
*MAR:	 It's got to be someone with a   
*TIM:	  (  )  
*MAR:	with a caretaker hasn't it be elect them, there isn't one is there? 
*DOR:	Why a caretaker? 
*MAR:	To open it up and see to it  (.)  
*DOR:	Why can't they? 
*MAR:	don't usually. 
*DOR:	Oh, they will have to if they want to won't they? ((laugh))  
*MAR:	Pay the caretaker  (  )  
*DOR:	Well in that case I expect, you know, some of us could become a caretaker if they're having to pay us  ((laugh))  
*MAR:	 ((laugh)) you'll be up there for seven in the morning 
*DOR:	That's alright, open it up and then what do you do keep puffing along and sweeping  it up whether it's put   
*MAR:	  (  )  
*DOR:	cigarette ends on the floor 
*MAR:	They could do. 
*DOR:	 there not to smoke in the place   
*TIM:	  (  )  
*DOR:	but I  bet they will   
*MAR:	 Our Man   , our Manchester buses are not smoking 
*DOR:	Are they? 
*MAR:	They've   (  ) down now 
*DOR:	Very good, I don't see why we couldn't be really, it's so horrible for everybody else. 
*MAR:	and Birmingham station 
*DOR:	We're desperate for  those at work   
*MAR:	 Birmingham station  is non smoking 
*DOR:	Mm, I've noticed that one 
*MAR:	 They give them all   
*DOR:	 Well that's sensible  for  (  )  
*MAR:	It is, they've give it out on the trains as you're coming in 
*DOR:	Oh 
*MAR:	please remember Birmingham is treated as a no smoking area, if you are smoking put your lights out  (  )  
*DOR:	Mm, mm, (  ) of the King's Cross Society you could have a  King's Cross   
*MAR:	 Well that is it   
*DOR:	in Birmingham's Station couldn't you? 
*MAR:	I, well that's why they put all those election round the 
*DOR:	Mm 
*MAR:	 (  ) 
*DOR:	Is that what all this refurbishment's been about? 
*MAR:	Mm, mm, cos of King's Cross, had to come at all it's awful and one time you just went straight on the escalator and now you've got to go  (9.0)
