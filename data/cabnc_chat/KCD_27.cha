*HEL:	I think you've just cost me a fortune today.
*CLA:	Have I?
*HEL:	Take one of those boxes of tissues and use tooth brush, tooth paste.What, got some soap have you?
*CLA:	Yes, yeah.
*HEL:	Right, your tooth paste.
*CLA:	Thank you.
*HEL:	Right, these two can go up, oh that's Amy's soap.
*CLA:	Bored with it, so I'll   (        ) it out every day.
*HEL:	Yes, right.There's your film.
*CLA:	Ah thanks.
*HEL:	Right .
*CLA:	That's mine?.
*HEL:	Yeah.
*CLA:	Oh right.
*HEL:	There's your cartridges.
*CLA:	Do I need to take both packets?
*HEL:	I wouldn't think so, I can't think you'll get through ten cartridges myself, that seems rather excessive.
