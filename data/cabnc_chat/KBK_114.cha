*NOR:	No, just leaving   (        ) for now  (        ) .When I got to school I will  (        ) .
*CHR:	What does it actually prove, osmosis or diffusion?
*NOR:	Osmosis.
*CHR:	Pardon?
*NOR:	I think it's osmosis.
*CHR:	Ah, that's the passing of a  ((whistling)) , erm, er, erm, something, no it can't be osmosis, cos it's a part of membrane.Passing of a liquid 
*NOR:	No diffusion.
*CHR:	liquid, no diffusion can anywhere, doesn't have to pass membrane at all.Passing of a liquid through a membrane leaving part of it's substance behind.
*SUS:	It's something to  (        ) .
*NOR:	It's absolutely nothing   (        ) 
*SUS:	Osmosis is the passing of water from a place of high water density to place of low water density.
*CHR:	Boom, boom, super.
*NOR:	Is that right  (        ) ?
*CHR:	Yes what does that mean in practice Snoopy?
*SUS:	Don't know.
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOR:	Where does osmosis occur dad means?
*SUS:	It's anywhere.
*NOR:	Like, such as?
*SUS:	Body.
*CHR:	Does it?
*NOR:	From where to where in the body?
*CHR:	Kidneys or something like that.
*SUS:	I don't know.
*NOR:	Why do we need to know about osmosis?
*SUS:	We don't, I'm just telling dad, cos he   (        ) 
*NOR:	How come you know about it?
*SUS:	 (        ) college.
*NOR:	Yes, but I mean, how?
*SUS:	I can't remember.
*NOR:	Ah, well   (        ) 
*CHR:	There's er no practical application as far as you know.
*NOR:	There must be.
*SUS:	Yeah, things   (        ) in the body and I can't  (        ) .
*NOR:	Well really, what I'm trying to tell the children is that plants need water, it drinks up water in order to live.
*SUS:	Yeah, (        ) 
*NOR:	Drink, you can't see it if you put them in water, you just know the water's gone but it might of evaporated.I just make them see the colour going up the stem of a plant.You can do it with a turn the carnation pink or you know it's white, that sort of thing.I was just having a little experiment to see how it takes and how strong it is and I know what I'm doing.
*CHR:	Well I can't see that that would actually prevent   (        ) action.
*NOR:	Well that's all it is.
*CHR:	Is it?Oh.
*NOR:	Try to prove anything is so the water travels up the plant, I can't think of anything  (        ) .
*CHR:	You haven't got a plant there have you?
*NOR:	A theory is a plant, what else does it do?
*CHR:	No not when it's chopped off top and bottom like a stick from the fridge dear, it's not a plant.
*NOR:	It is a plant.
*CHR:	Oh.
