*JEA:	Well I don't know why, I was drawn to that colour.
*BRE:	It's that's my colour, isn't it?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	In your   (.) got my fork instead of a spoon didn't I?
*JEA:	Oh   (.) Ooh!
*BRE:	So it it's Paul   (.) has the other lodger gone yet?
*JEA:	Philip?
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	No, he's going   (.) pretty soon, I think.
*BRE:	He's a pain though is he?
*JEA:	Mm   (.) I went into his room   (.) and yet again   (.) he has got wet washing hanging up inside that room.
*BRE:	What in his bedroom?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	How does he put it out then?
*JEA:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	Where did you buy that top you've got on   (.)  (        ) ?
*JEA:	British Home Stores.
*BRE:	It's lovely.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Is that the one, when you were with me?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Looks really nice on.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	So have you seen this chap any more?
*JEA:	Mark?
*BRE:	This   (.) new man   (.) is his name Mark?
*JEA:	Little o little old one   (.) erm   (.) when did I see him? (.) Sunday.
*BRE:	Sunday?
*JEA:	We went over to Lavenham.
*BRE:	Where did you meet him at?
*JEA:	Marriage agency.
*BRE:	What Dateline?
*JEA:	No   (.) Destiny, a local one.
*BRE:	Oh you're not with Dateline any more?
*JEA:	No   (.) no good! (.) Not for me   (.) this local one is absolutely splendid!
*BRE:	Is it?
*JEA:	Mm   (.) You ca 
*BRE:	What about 
*JEA:	You can talk to the man who's running it.
*BRE:	Is Ron still going with his  (        ) ?
*JEA:	Oh yes, he's still with Trudy.
*BRE:	Do you reckon he'll end up getting married?
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	No   (.) what on   (.) her side or his?
*JEA:	Her side   (.) she won't have it.
*BRE:	Won't she?
*JEA:	No   (.) I've warned Ron   (.) he's such an obstinate so and so, he won't be told! (.) I said that I think you'll find, Ron that Trudy   (.) if she married would have to give up her   (.) late husband's occupational widow's pension   (.) so that the way you're going on now, where you go and stay with her for two or three days at a time   (.) is far better   (.) oh no, no, no, she'll be able to keep her pension    (        )  (.) I said I very much doubt it   (.) then I said   (.) people are so jealous   (.) that if she does marry you   (.) and he doesn't tell the firm   (.) I bet that one of her   (.) dear neighbours will   (.) oh no they're all very nice people round where she lives, I thought there's no good arguing with Ron!
*BRE:	Would she lose he pension then if she got married?
*JEA:	Well   (.) mostly, yes.
*BRE:	Careful when you put your cup  (        ) .
*JEA:	If you haven't, if you worked   (.) if you haven't worked at th sorry?
*BRE:	Careful when you pick that up, it's ever so slippery.
*JEA:	Oh my God! (.) If you get a   (.) a pension based on the fact that you're your late husband's widow   (.) when you are no longer your late husband's widow, but somebody's wife   (.) they don't have to pay you that pension.
*BRE:	Oh   (.) so I suppose Trudy doesn't know either?
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	Actually I can't blame her.
*JEA:	No   (.) and she doesn't want Ron   (.) to move into her house   (.) because there is no way that he could.
*BRE:	The thing is he's so   (        ) isn't he?
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	It doesn't, sort of, change anything   (.) Has he organized his  (        ) ?
*JEA:	Sorry?
*BRE:	Will he organize his  (        ) ?
*JEA:	No not really   (.) no   (.) it's still a great big   (.) muddly tip! (.) You have seen it, haven't you?
*BRE:	No.
*JEA:	Oh   (.) oh you must!
*BRE:	Cos how old is he?
*JEA:	Seventy.
*BRE:	He's quite good for seventy, in he?
*JEA:	Oh very   (.) oh yes.
*BRE:	The thing is now, you see there's no way   (.) would you change him?
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	But he wouldn't want it, would he?
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	This is lovely!
*JEA:	Mm! (.) I mean poor old Ron!
*BRE:	He's been going with her quite a while, though has he?
*JEA:	Yes, oh yes.
*BRE:	So she's just happy with that relationship, is she?
*JEA:	Yes   (.) in fact, to be perfectly honest with you   (.) the relationship is a bit more than she wants   (.) Ron     (.)  ((cough))  (.) is a bit of a pain   (.) I told him over and over again   (.) not to push his luck, I said for goodness sake, Ron, be   (.) grateful for what you've got   (.) apparently she   (.) doesn't like to make love with the lights on   (.) I said well if that's what she doesn't like that's what she doesn't like, you're not going to change a woman of sixty eight! (.) Oh    (        )  (.) the way she and her husband went on   (.) that's all in the past   (.) I said yes, but it's there was an awful lot of it.
*BRE:	That's right   (.) he should really, especially tha at her age!
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	He should, sort of, honour her wishes shouldn't he?
*JEA:	He should.
*BRE:	So has he all gone to his gr mother's at Christmas?
*JEA:	Mm   (.) yes   (.) I told Paul   (.) that he can bring a lady up   (.) at Christmas-time.
*BRE:	Is he not going home then?
*JEA:	No   (.) and erm   (.) I'm leaving a turkey in the freezer,an Paul is quite good at cooking   (.) standard cooking.
*BRE:	Yeah he'll he'll   (.) I remember he cooks for himself, doesn't he an ?
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	He   (.) I mean I know he eats you out of house and home, but   (.) he's quite a good lodger isn't he?
*JEA:	He's a very good lodger 
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	yes   (.) last week he helped me turn the garage out   (.) he took all the rubbish left over from the tip   (.) down to the tip.
*BRE:	So did Nev come and do your kitchen?
*JEA:	Well   (.) almost   (.) I got the cupboard done   (.) and I got the tiles   (.) lying by the side of the hob, but they haven't yet been cut to fit   (.) erm   (.) and glued down   (.) but one of these day's he'll get around to it.
*BRE:	He's doing a lot in his house?
*JEA:	Mm   (.) well Jackie rang me   (.) Thursday evening and said   (.) you know, then my life is get up early   (.) let the dogs out or whatever   (.) stagger into school   (.) stagger back   (.) do a meal   (.) do some marking   (.) fall into bed.
*BRE:	That's a lot.
*JEA:	That's her life.
*BRE:	Where's she going Christmas?
*JEA:	She's going home I think   (.) she's not having Benita and her mother up.
*BRE:	Are they?
*JEA:	They still can't do it.
*BRE:	What will Paul, just go and visit his mo Neil go and visit mum and then come back, cos although Paul's there 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	it's better isn't 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	it?
*JEA:	Yes   (.) that's right.
*BRE:	Are you gonna have a tree up?
*JEA:	Yes   (.) didn't buy any new   (.) ornaments when I was up in Liverpool   (.) cos I didn't see anything that I particularly liked   (.) but   (.) what Carla has done   (.) gives me an idea for making some extra bits for the tree   (.) Where did you get that   (        ) from?
*BRE:	Bernard Singers the what the netting?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Yeah that's all it is   (.) all it is is like 
*JEA:	Mm 
*BRE:	like netting.
*JEA:	Charlatan it's called.
*BRE:	Oh that's what it's called?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Mm   (.) ninety nine pence a meter.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Erm Singers do every colour, it's just the fact she wanted to give friends a present and I said 
*JEA:	Mm mm
*BRE:	you know,it it you can't afford to   (.) to 
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	do it
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	and I said to her one night, and we bought those bags of sweets, it was ninety nine pee for about forty
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and I said just put two or three in each
*JEA:	Mm 
*BRE:	that's enough for 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	a child 
*JEA:	Mm yeah.
*BRE:	and she had great fun, we 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	did them in an evening.
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	And I didn't use ribbon cos it would have worked expensive for her   (.) I just used that erm
*JEA:	I saw.
*BRE:	curly stuff 
*JEA:	the 
*BRE:	for her.
*JEA:	Yeah   (.) mm.
*BRE:	But for kids, I mean 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	they're only gonna throw 
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	it away, aren't they?
*JEA:	Mm   (.) oh yes.
*BRE:	And it'll be a   (.) you know, a waste, ribbon, so I 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	thought I'll just put that on it.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And she thinks they're wonderful.
*JEA:	Mm, they are 
*BRE:	Well 
*JEA:	I was just thinking   (.) what a dozen would look like hanging on my tree.
*BRE:	Yeah   (.) they're so simple.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	I mean, all I use   (.) I mean, if I was making them for somebody I would   (.) use about four or five layers   (.) and then I would put   (.) a piece of lace of braid or   (.) something at the top
*JEA:	mm.
*BRE:	just to make, if I was making them really 
*JEA:	Mm mm 
*BRE:	but for the tree I thought well I'm gonna make some   (.) I'm gonna make six, like the colouring we did erm   (.) the   (.) erm   (.) wa black, red and white

*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Erm   (.) but you see these si I mean, Debs do it as well all that   (.) that netting.

*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	which was a lot of money 
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	then.
