@Comment:	conversation #13 (Tape 029102)
*ENA:	Perhaps I shouldn't do this yet cos we haven't agreed it! But we have a new secretary. Er, if you agree it an  and   (  ) report. And I'm gonna ask Catherine to stand up so that you can all see who she is. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	We're involved in   (.) bringing things together, we're involved  lots of things and   
*UNK:	 At the back in black. 
*ENA:	there are lots of things    (  )   
*UNK:	 At the back in black. 
*ENA:	 (  ) committee, if you go downstairs you will see on the notice there a display of various things that we do, and on the windowsills there are   (.) various pieces of information   (.) free   (.) sheets that you can pick up and take away it will tell you about all sorts of issues! The way in which society   (.) imposes an agenda on us   (.) asks us questions in the churches. I think we're not too bad in doing that. But what we   (.) need to do   (.) as well, is to listen wha   (.) to what the churches are saying as they address these issues. And I want to   (.) erm   (.) ask you please   (.) if you have any comments about the work of The Old Church and Society Committee, the work we do fo  fo  for Synod and in the provence   (.) please make those comments known   (.) to Catherine or to your district representative! We need to hear from the local churches, from the district councils what's going on   (.) wha   (.) what the issues that concern you are   (.) so let's   (.) as well the ones that you see downstairs, we may already be addressing so have a look down there   (.) have a look at the, the information   (.) but if there are any issues you feel we ought to be addressing then please let us know so that we can put them on our agenda. That's all I want to say   (.) except to er, who, that Synod received the report of the Church and Society committee? I'm assuming you've read that report? Have you received it? 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*JOH:	Does anybody wish to make any comments or   (.) ask any questions about this particular section?  (.) Don't think that's a lack of interest, I think it's matter of discipline! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	Oh Good! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*ENA:	Okay then. (  ) . 
*JOH:	Thank you Peter and thank you Catherine   (.) erm   (.) we will give the view   (.) in due course. We move to the DP committee report which is on page seventeen.  (.) I'm gonna go very speedily and ask that we receive this report for debate.  (.) Good! 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*JOH:	Any comments on any section that is not pertaining to the resolution that was on page nineteen?  (.) Erm   (.) one from Mike     (.)   (.) Mike? 
*ALA:	 (  ) and   (  ) is that   (.)  (  ) , I always feel threatened   (.) or paranoid   (.) I just want to make a point on   (.) on paragraph seven   (.) the rule in which to review the   (  ) is that   (.) my understanding that   (.) review will be about   (.) the role and    (  )  (.) of the rule in which the   (.)  (  ) . 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	We will note that in a minute. 
*ALA:	Right. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Er 
*UNK:	I just wanna refer to item one which is to do with the Synod  (  ) . 
*JOH:	That's actually   (.) a different resolution. 
*UNK:	Is it? 
*JOH:	So we come back to  that. 
*UNK:	 Well   
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	Do you wannit    (.)   (  )   
*JOH:	 Ah! ah! 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Right   (.) I would  say   
*JOH:	 Sorry!  Sorry! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Any other comments about any other questions not pertaining to the resolution there?  (.) We therefore come to resolution two   (.) in which    (.)  (  ) to make it to paragraph one   (.)  (  )  
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	You're so gracious John! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	So   (.) it's just simply to er   (.) comment about the   (.) the future work that's gonna be done by Glanmole  (.) er, the work of investigation as I understand it at the end of that first section. 
*UNK:	Really, two things brought up investigation to consider   (.) the first is with   (  ) trusts   (.) the very important piece of work that's done by trusts on behalf of the provence   (.) another provence may or may not know that there are the trusts have now been   (.) er, between trusts   (.) erm   (.) South Wales trusts   (.) erm 
*UNK:	 Monmouthshire   
*UNK:	 North  Wales trust and Monmouthshire have now all been amalgamated into one   (.) and we're working through the implications of that. And we have had the trust secretary who has been working on our behalf voluntarily   (.) for some time now. I don't think anybody appreciates just how much, and I would like to put it on record, how much George   does   (.) on behalf of the provence   (.) a very considerable piece of work! If you   (.) were part of the trust meetings and saw the degree of work that he does do regularly on our behalf it is quite considerable   (.) he doesn't do it for nothing!  (.) I can't imagine that George is gonna continuing   (.) doing that forever   (.) and it may well be that we'll be faced with a possibility of, of what we do in the future   (.) to have that piece of administration done   (.) will we be able to assume that it could done voluntary in the future? Or will it be part of the administrative task of the church? So I'd, I'd like that to be   (.) er   (.) considered   (.) er, when this whole investigation is carried on. And the second point too, is to say   (.) is to ask, at least to consider, whether then in some centres the work of the Synod ought to be trimmed down to match   (.) the particular work   (.) that is being done. I mean tha  , is it all, you know, do we need all the time to have   (.) erm   (.) extra administrative help and in in, and in terms of which we've been talking about before, I know they might sound like two conflicting issues   (.) but one of the ways of ensuring we get the work done   (.) is   (.) do we trying too much at the Synod? Should we be thrusting more work down to districts   (.) and th  , and they'll   (  ) to do the job rather than always assume it should be done at this level? 
*JOH:	I think, I'm not going to encourage debate on that   (.) I think we've heard what Kenneth said   (.) particularly about the trusts   (.) the working done by the trust   (.) and would   (.) suggest that we ask Granville to take that on board as well and be within the   (.) presentations too. And I think some would be   (.) the less about the   (.) too much work perhaps being done by Synod   (.) and not enough by districts. I think it is something that we should   (.) encourage churches to talk about, the districts to talk about   (.) speaking of the district secretary   (.) I  (  ) ! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	But   (.) there we are   (.) I I think we'll just take that on board like that.  (.) Erm, resolution that Synod appoints Jo  , John   as Synod clerk for a period of up to three years   (.) to commence at a date mutually convenient to him   (.) and the present Synod clerk.  (.) Those in favour of that resolution?  (.) Any against?  (.) Right, (  ) .  (.) I think   (.) erm   (.) we are not going to say thank you to Eileen now   (.) because   (.) she is not finishing as Synod clerk and that's a conscious decision. It may be that   (.) er, Eileen will be Synod clerk this time   (.) next year as well we don't know. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Synod will divulge a degree of flex   (.) no, quite seriously, a degree of flexibility   (.) and we're grateful both to Eileen and er, to John   (.) for allowing that degree of flexibility to take place. And Synod will of course will be informed   (.) er, (  )  
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	when, when Synod clerk has changed. But we're grateful to Eileen for what she is doing   (.) and will continue to do   (.) and we're grateful to John for what he intends to do   (.) erm   (.) for three years at any stage   (.) wha   (.) at any stage in which they choose.  (.)  (  ) thank you.  (.) Then   (.) resolution three that Synod appoints the Reverend David  , Henry   and Nanette   as the rep  , as representatives on the Mission Council   (.) and this pertaining to paragraph two.  (.) Firstly, I think I should say that   (.) straight away one hopes that these three    (  )  (.) erm, and that's regrettable! But the background is that of fifty letters were sent out to a variety of people   (.) er, lay and ordained   (.) whatever that means! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Erm   (.) asking for permission to put their names forward   (.) and from the, the few letters we had   (.) the, this was   (  ) that we thought was the whitest knights   (.) in terms of Geography   (.) in terms of sex   (.) in terms of I wouldn't say intelligence, perhaps I should try to impress them! 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Erm   (.) are there any comments or questions  (  ) ?  (.) Those, those supporting that please show?  (.) Against?  (.) Erm   (.) now this present report is no longer necessary   (.) erm   (.) because paragraph three is now no longer accurate   (.) erm, because a change that took place in the General Assembly Executive Committee   (.) last   (.) the week before last.  (.) My feeling is   (.) that it wouldn't have   (  ) when there's a been a change   (.) perhaps   (.) there could be no   (  ) from the    (  )   
*UNK:	  ((sneeze))  
*JOH:	the secretary   (.) and as semi-executive now does not apply to this   (.) I would suggest that somebody, unconstitutionally, intervenes the Synod advocate   (.) and ignore this resolution   (.) and continue with the second Saturday of March   (.) and the second Saturday in April.  (.) Can you agree?  (.) Yo   
*UNK:	Yes. 
*UNK:	Agreed. 
*JOH:	Yes, (  ) .  (.) Does Synod accept the nominations in section ten? These nominations are   (.) do  , clearly written. 
*UNK:	Yes, if we could make a comment please the thing about   (  ) in July? 
*JOH:	Yes. 
*UNK:	Could it be looked at? 
*JOH:	Well it's erm     (.)  (  )  (.) and   (.) the   (.) see if you could another appointment   (.) erm   (.) for when he has got   (.)  (  ) . 
*UNK:	That's okay. 
*JOH:	Those in agreement with   (.) resolution five please show?  (.) And when we come to resolution six   (.) er, there is only one district council   (.) which has a made a nomination for the   (.) erm   (.) moderator for general assembly for ninety   (.) three, ninety four? And that was Mid-Wales district council. You will all find yellow sheets of paper   (.) if    (  )  (.) wondering why we're reading about   (.) the  (  ) .  (.) Mid-Wales district council   (.) erm   (.) I think unanimously   (.) wish to put this nomination of reverence in the past   (.) erm   (.) and   (.) the   (  ) nomination   (.) for moderator of general assembly   (.) from ninety three   (.) to ninety four.  (.) They have read   (.) it was proposed and seconded by the Reverends   (.) erm Mike   and Gethwyn     (.) and if   (.) there any questions   (.) I am sure that they are   (  ) to answer questions   (.) rather than ask them to speak to us. 
*UNK:	 (  ) , thank you. 
*JOH:	There was quite   (.) a lot of discussion in the Mid-Wales District Council about this nomination   (.) erm   (.) it wasn't  (  ) , that reminds me   (.) yes it was    (  )   
*UNK:	  (  )  
*JOH:	all members   (  ) votes   (.) voted in favour of it. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Erm   (.) so it had been thought about quite seriously. Is Synod willing to take this   (.) for the general assembly as a nomination   (.) for   (.) erm   (.) if she agrees to nomination for   (.) moderator general assembly. 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*UNK:	Could I, could I just ask what particular element she has for Wales to nominate, why why, why was Wales nominated  (  ) ?  (.) Any, you know particular reason for that, having got David here   (.) ah I I   (  ) I've decided to go through actually. 
*UNK:	But how? 
*UNK:	But I I of course felt the   (  ) of giving me something that he would be known by everybody in Wales. Er   (.) a  and therefore, I would of thought that was a   (.) everyone    (  )  (.) but I'm just wondering why it is that now   (.) what    (.)  (  ) of Wales? 
*JOH:	Are there any other questions   (.) to refer to district council? 
*UNK:	No. 
*JOH:	Can you answer? 
*BOB:	Well I felt one of two ways, firstly when we're looking for a moderator of the URC we're looking for a moderator for the whole church. And secondly, in terms of Liz     (.) Liz   is someone I know extremely well and have worked with   (.) in various functions and committees over the past. We have someone always there   (.) for those   (.) who have   (  ) er, society   (.) those who are poor   (.) er, women   (.) er, many of the issues that we feel   (.) very strongly   (.) and here, here   (  ) She had no   (.) sort of cultural   (.) historic resonance   (.) with the nation of Wales   (.) but I'm sure her    (  )  (.) and the way she approaches her whole ministry would mean that she'd have a lot of   (  ) than those of us here   (.) in the URC   (.) in Wales. 
*JOH:	The resolution is, comes before you from Mid-Wales district council, those in favour of sending   (.) er, Elizabeth's nomination forward, if she agrees to that   (.) please show?  (.) Those against?  (.) That is carried.  (.) We've come, I think to the end of our business, which is good! You will have tea at half past four which is   (.) which is   (.) er splendid!  (.) There are a couple of things I would like to say   (.) one is that you will find   (.) people have asked regards   (.) the paper which David mentioned in Northern Ireland   (.) that has been distributed   (.) it was pinned to another sheet of paper   (.) erm, headed The Last Attempt   (.) and there are more copies available   (.) it's simply to know   (.) where to find that  (  ) .  (.) We must have three minutes of relaxation before beginning Synod. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOH:	Before beginning  (  ) .  (.) Thank you for   (.) before yo  , before you start    (  )  (.) the   (.) please   (.) please   (.) we haven't quite finished!  (.) Before we actually have that three minute break   (.) erm, I think we should formally thank the Church of England of Holywell   (.) for its hospitality laid down  (  ) . 
*UNK:	 ((applause))
*UNK:	Ooh! Ooh! 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Erm 
*UNK:	Would like a cup of this er 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*UNK:	Sorry, now that's  (  ) ? (  )   
*UNK:	 No, no  I didn't! 
*UNK:	 (  ) . 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*UNK:	I knew these pews were hard! 
*UNK:	Ooh, I didn't realise they were that bad!  (.) I feel sorry for my poor congregation! 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Hello! 
*UNK:	There's a cup of tea  there. 
*UNK:	 Ooh  how kind!  (.)  Thank you   
*UNK:	 You   
*UNK:	very much. 
*UNK:	you're standing in the door. 
*UNK:	Thank you    (  )   
*UNK:	 What have  we got here? 
*UNK:	Thank you  (  ) . 
*UNK:	Well it's the   (.)  (  )  
*UNK:	Hello Arthur! 
*UNK:	Erm   (.) Owen was told we'd got to   (.)  (  ) . 
*UNK:	John! 
*UNK:	He's upstairs. 
*UNK:	Is he? Oh! 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*UNK:	Oh sorry! 
*UNK:	Day before it.

*JOH:	Shall we settle down!
