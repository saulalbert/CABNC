*TER:	Well he's so badly parked you see, he's got to wait for both traffics to go whereas I could go easily •_•
*MAR:	Yeah  Now where shall we look for a ruby wedding card? •_•
        You would generally go for that one in the market wouldn't you? •_•
*TER:	Well no I don't know that I would, I would probably go to erm the one, you know, by the egg basket •_•
*MAR:	Mm, funnily enough I don't like it in there  well I suppose I might get something in •_•
*GRO:	 (        )

*MAR:	well it's the only way the •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	well somebody else is coming, join onto us, but er  learner as well, why most of them seem to be learners don't they? •_•
*TER:	Yeah •_•
*MAR:	You hardly ever see a motor cyclist  these days  you know unless he's got an L plate up  of course you can't get passed because of the erm •_•
*TER:	Mind you the van's a long way behind him anyway •_•
*MAR:	Now he is, isn't it? •_•
        Now what are we going to do erm? •_•
*TER:	Well I think what I'll do, if I go round by the market I can drop you there by the multi-storey car park and you can then just walk through to Baston's can't you? •_•
*MAR:	Yeah •_•
*TER:	And I'll go down to the church and park by the church, how about that? •_•
        And then you can walk back down is that alright? •_•
*MAR:	Oh that way, yes •_•
*TER:	That's an ambulance would you believe •_•
*MAR:	Ooh  help •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*MAR:	anyway, one less, there's a car sort of in front of the ambulance kind of thing  •_•
*TER:	Yes I think that must of come out in the roundabout there, it wasn't in front before, erm, so I'll do that yes, I'll drop you off •_•
*MAR:	Yeah and I •_•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*TER:	and you can just walk through to Baston's, whatever and I'll go to Muriel •_•
*MAR:	Baston's or erm •_•
*TER:	Oh whatever you want •_•
*MAR:	go up to the shops by the egg basket if need be •_•
*TER:	So I'll see you back at the church  I mean if I can just park down by Devon Square I will, but otherwise I'll park •_•
*MAR:	Yeah, right •_•
*TER:	behind the church  •_•
*MAR:	Perhaps the ambulance has got somebody really ill in there or something  •_•
*TER:	I wouldn't of thought so, I would of thought it was more or less the van than anything else  •_•
*MAR:	It's a ruby wedding it is, isn't it? •_•
*TER:	Mm, mm  •_•
