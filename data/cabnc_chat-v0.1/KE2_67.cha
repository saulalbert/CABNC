*MAR:	So •690642_691082•
*TER:	Well Thompson needs  •693152_694082•
*MAR:	Bryant  •694082_694262•
*TER:	Thompson needs one and Bryant needs two. •694262_696492•
        And that's Thompson. •696492_701802•
*MAR:	I'm going with David this Saturday. •701802_709572•
        Worked hard hasn't he? •713222_714462•
        To get back there. •714462_715202•
*TER:	He has worked hard. •715202_716172•
        He only needed two at the last end. •717812_719572•
        Thompson needed three. •720322_721472•
        Erm  but he just had sort of he wasn't so good. •722572_726532•
        Well that's a better ball! •726532_727272•
        If he'd done that in the last erm, he'd have won it. •727272_730402•
*MAR:	And he's come back and sort of go round the back cos that other fellow sort of he came down •732562_737202•
*TER:	Mm. •737202_737362•
*MAR:	and then he appeared up the top there. •737362_739932•
*TER:	They come down to see  what the situation really is. •740242_743592•
*MAR:	Please! •744982_745332•
        Come on then! •745432_746352•
        Oh it's gone further though this •746402_748782•
*TER:	Yeah. •749712_752002•
*MAR:	Well presumably they , they have to throw or they're supposed to throw, or have they not? •752512_768702•
        Cos he just said that should of been enough. •770022_771662•
*TER:	Oh, he's looking worried! •773252_774392•
        Ooh ooh! •775962_776302•
        Ee ee! •777122_777762•
*MAR:	Well that's much better than the other two isn't it? •777972_780162•
*TER:	Yeah, I don't, yeah. •780232_781962•
        Could be two. •781962_782612•
        Yeah we've dropped two more. •784012_784942•
*MAR:	And he's got two more balls. •786162_787322•
*TER:	Mm. •787322_787632•
*MAR:	Well, is that a problem? •788352_789592•
        He's gonna try and knock  •792982_794322•
*TER:	So he's gotta  again. •794352_805132•
*MAR:	Yeah. •805212_805332•
        Oh it's going right through! •805332_805972•
        He's trying to knock David out of course isn't he? •805972_807592•
*TER:	Mm mm. •807592_807792•
        And drop himself in. •807792_808682•
*MAR:	Yeah. •808792_808862•
*TER:	Well I should think he's now got one red I should think. •808912_811702•
*MAR:	I suppose you could say David had it so often    that it be nice for him to get it. •816832_834852•
*TER:	I should think David will come out on the forehand and try and knock that  blue ball out. •835072_840542•
        The one that's  •840622_841052•
*MAR:	He's only got one there. •841052_842052•
*TER:	Mm. •842082_842482•
        Yes I  •842532_842732•
*MAR:	The  •842732_842822•
*TER:	thought he only got one. •842882_843852•
        Interesting to see which way he comes. •844952_846082•
        I think he'll come round this way. •846082_847122•
        Oh no he's not! •855142_857482•
        He's coming round the  back the other way. •857482_872322•
        Ooh ooh! •872502_875832•
        I probably only red still. •875832_879582•
        It's still his one. •881162_882072•
*MAR:	Still only got one. •882402_889932•
        Yes. •890172_890412•
        Well he's got three  so this is the fourth one from this fellow isn't it? •890562_898702•
*TER:	That's right! •898702_899292•
*MAR:	And Bryant has the last one? •901252_902922•
        No. •902922_903142•
*TER:	A chalk. •903142_903382•
*MAR:	So it just needs  David to get through? •919602_929402•
        He can do what he likes  •931372_935532•
*TER:	Yeah. •936212_936522•
*MAR:	with this last ball really. •936522_938872•
*TER:	Well, yeah. •938922_939552•
*MAR:	This red one. •939552_940222•
*TER:	If he gets another red he's won the match. •940222_942472•
        But if he  if he plays it and misses it he could give it to Thompson. •943112_946972•
        And if he  if he doesn't play  it'll be a draw. •946972_952212•
*MAR:	Oh not just , not just one ball he needs to play  •952622_968202•
*TER:	Yes. •969882_969982•
*MAR:	but two. •969982_971962•
*TER:	He needs two. •972032_975232•
        Thompson didn't play his. •975332_981612•
        It's all or nothing on this one! •981612_993992•
*MAR:	Oh dear! •994852_996882•
        So has that fellow won it? •996882_100661•
*TER:	No, it's one all. •100661_100719•
        it it's one red, so they're now  six all. •100719_101000•
*MAR:	Oh gosh! •101038_101060•
        It doesn't matter then. •101111_101244•
