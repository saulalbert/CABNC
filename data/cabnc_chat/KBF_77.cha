*LEE:	But I haven't  white shirts. •226225_243425•
*DAV:	You must, don't buy a stripy one cos a stripy one won't go with the shirt, the tie. •243425_303025•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*LEE:	nothing else. •305125_319025•

*DAV:	Well you see it's gotta be a reasonable fit. •442725_475225•

*BRE:	Might get your shoes on Wednesday. •647125_684725•
*DAV:	But make sure he's got his trousers on! •684725_700425•
*BRE:	Why does he have to have his trousers on? •700425_726725•
*DAV:	Well he has to put the suit on, try it on in the shop, to make sure it, wear his shoes there  cos even, the shoes he's got might be alright with it. •729925_826825•
*BRE:	But they they've got holes in. •834525_842025•
        He needs new school shoes. •842025_858625•
*DAV:	Yes but if they  are alright you know the type of shoes you want. •858625_885225•

*BRE:	Have you gone for the longer length? •104712_105772•
        Like with your school trousers or short short? •105852_107462•
*DAV:	You couldn't , they were long •108792_109592•
*LEE:	Short. •109692_109832•
*BRE:	Eh? •109832_109862•
*BRE:	you can't tell because he had trainers on. •110072_111872•

*DAV:	We may, he measured, we  the leg he had trainers on. •114222_116242•
        And matey done them a little bit longer. •116242_119282•
        He added a bit. •119672_119942•
        He done down to the top of the trainer •120232_121322•
*BRE:	Have they got turn-ups on? •121322_122752•
*LEE:	Yeah. •123432_123512•
*DAV:	and then down a bit more. •124372_126282•

*BRE:	Go and get your Benolin. •142022_144662•

*LEE:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	Four at a time? •150852_152612•
*LEE:	No. •152612_152702•
*BRE:	So how many times do you take it? •153472_157512•
        One spoonful or one ? •157942_159492•
*LEE:	two teaspoons. •159752_170592•
*DAV:	My pension. •172722_178022•
*LEE:	Getting old mate. •178022_183012•
*DAV:	. •_•
        Here you are. •183012_183572•
        If I was to pop my clogs at work or any time  you'd get fifty five thousand eight hundred eighty pounds. •183652_190752•
*BRE:	Quick, knock him off then. •190752_191772•
        . We'll knock him off quick. •192042_193672•
*DAV:	Plus  you get your three and a half grand back. •193722_197272•
        Plus you would get five thousand six hundred and six pounds  a year pension. •197272_202252•
        Plus the insurance on the house would pay up so you'd have, ha bloody hell, so you'd have about sixty grand in the bank. •202552_209202•
*BRE:	Must be worth twenty five grand then. •209312_211342•
*DAV:	No mortgage. •211572_211952•
*LEE:	 ((cough)) 
*DAV:	Think how many shirts with that you could buy then. •211952_215192•
        And at the moment  you know when I'm gonna retire Bren? •215192_221442•
*BRE:	When? •221922_222092•
        When is it? •222912_223882•
*DAV:	This ain't far away. •224152_225272•
*BRE:	With that fifty five, yeah? •225272_226632•
        Fifty five grand. •226722_229372•
        What if you don't  if you don't die before? •229372_231852•
*DAV:	You don't get it, do you. •232042_233972•
*BRE:	You don't get it? •233972_235182•
*DAV:	I retire  I'm sixty five right  this is not far away •235182_241322•
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*DAV:	when you say it like this. •241322_242652•
        On the fourth of July two thousand and nineteen. •242652_245642•
*BRE:	Is that ? •245772_246082•
*DAV:	That ain't far away is it? •246082_247012•
*BRE:	What's that? •247012_247372•
        At sixty five? •247892_248472•
*DAV:	Mm. •249012_249292•
*BRE:	You're sixty five in that year. •249292_250732•
*DAV:	And if I, if I stayed with Tescos and got me pension and that. •250772_257152•
        But I don't think it's with the A V C's it's just the pension. •257152_262392•
        I could, if I retire at sixty five I can have twenty  this is the best bit, twenty one thousand  pound in a lump sum. •262612_271412•
        And then I could have a pension which would be seven thousand six hundred and seventy three pounds a year which is  about a hundred and  twenty pounds •271412_283132•
*BRE:	A month. •283302_283732•
*DAV:	a week. •286522_286902•
        No a week. •289332_289552•
        Plus you would have that month's salary. •289622_294042•
*BRE:	What would you go  you wouldn't have a lump sum? •294052_295752•
*DAV:	Oh yeah, yeah. •295752_296652•
*BRE:	You'd have the lump sum as well? •296652_298072•
*DAV:	Oh I'd have the lump, no  you can  it would be more than that. •298312_305692•
        My pension, if I didn't have it  if I say I don't want the lump sum, the twenty one grand. •305692_311932•
*BRE:	Yeah. •311932_312122•
*DAV:	It would probably be fourteen thousand pound a year you'd work it on  two hundred and fifty pound a week. •312162_319712•
        But  if you're sixty five you haven't got much longer to go have you? •319712_322822•
        You know what   •324282_324812•
*BRE:	If you took the lump sum and  •324812_325562•
*DAV:	Yeah. •325842_325932•
        If you get your lump sum out  if you want a new car you get a new car. •325932_328912•
        Because you get your state pension as well. •328912_330782•
        Which is for a couple would be eighty three pounds. •331562_334572•
        So you'd be on  you'd have twenty one grand which you could put away. •334772_339902•
*BRE:	Live on the interest. •340002_341312•
*DAV:	No you couldn't live on the interest. •341482_345372•
        But see the way I, the way I assume, see this  the endowment on the house is paid    •345372_351232•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*DAV:	So that goes  fifteen thousand. •351232_351972•
        So you'd have like twenty, well so they  about twenty grand so you get twenty grand there. •352172_358042•
        By that time we should have about  I would say at least another ten thousand pounds in that account of yours. •358622_365182•
        So you'd have thirty grand there which   •365362_369892•
*BRE:	And those family assurance things. •369972_371852•
*DAV:	Yeah. •371852_372072•
        Plus the shares  which will be on my side. •372072_376142•
        Plus this pension so you'd be, you'd have your house paid for so you'd get a nice •376362_380642•
*BRE:	A nice nest egg. •380932_381332•
*DAV:	a nice lump you can  draw for a holiday and plus have a good living between. •381332_386992•
        That's why that, at the moment I don't see it  well I don't see it  a necessity  you to get a pension. •386992_397362•
*BRE:	Mm. •397362_397482•
*DAV:	But I think •397482_400222•
*BRE:	You got that family assurance thing haven't you? •400222_402002•
        And I've got my TESSA. •402012_402422•
*DAV:	That's what I mean, yeah. •402422_403992•
        That's why I say to you, you say oh we've got this we've got that we want that we want this but   er  I tell you two thousand nineteen and you're at nineteen ninety two. •403992_416112•
        That ain't far away though. •416112_418062•
        And plus the fact there's, I don't wanna work till I'm sixty five  I wanna pack up about  •418062_424372•
*BRE:	What about that pension if you want to pack up before? •424372_426962•
*DAV:	No it's, it is quite  reducing. •427882_429962•
        That's why you've gotta be er  put all your things together now. •429962_437222•
        See even that there  If for some reason you go back there and you're not happy with the suit •437322_456522•
*LEE:	 ((cough)) 
*DAV:	right? •456592_456682•
*BRE:	I shall , you know me. •456682_458502•
*DAV:	. •_•
        No let him try it on. •459902_460932•
        Don't take the suit away. •460932_463012•
        Alright? •463012_463322•
        Listening? •463322_463412•
*BRE:	Right. •463532_463932•
        Well what if he says well, it's alright you take it away and then bring it back? •464372_469542•
*DAV:	No. •469542_469662•
        Well it's no good to you. •469692_470902•
        Alright? •470902_470972•
        Don't take the suit away, the only thing I'm a bit dubious  well he said well take the suit home and try it  if it's not he said come back with it, he said and  we'll exchange it down here. •470972_481132•
        He said there's no problem with the exchange. •481132_483012•
        I came out that shop and I thought  and why the fucking hell didn't he let us try it on there and then? •483012_487842•
        And if it ain't the right size he can take the one that is. •487842_489872•
        So I thought perhaps matey only had a small and large. •489872_492712•
        Not a medium so he's given him the small so he's thinking if  if it doesn't fit  he's still made the sale. •492712_500442•
        If you see what I mean. •500592_501512•
        So you have to go back and have another shirt. •501512_505722•
        I mean he had about four or five different shirts there. •505722_509132•
        But it has to be white. •509182_510222•
*BRE:	What, did you think it would be too small? •510342_511522•
*DAV:	Well no cos matey, I don't think so cos matey said he is a small. •511522_514622•
        Cos I said to him I said well look, he likes his shirts baggy  he said yeah but you can't have a shirt too baggy with a suit. •514712_520322•
        So  •520322_520352•
*BRE:	But that shirt's okay cos it, I mean he can wear that to school can't he? •520352_526232•
        The rest of •526242_526382•
*DAV:	Oh yeah. •526382_526632•
        But he's gotta try it on and make sure it's not, if it's all tight he ain't gonna be happy in it is he? •526632_529862•
        That's if  •529862_530872•
*BRE:	he said today he said I don't know when I'm gonna wear the suit. •530882_533932•
*DAV:	Well you said he could wear it  well like you said most people  mm  I'll wear it. •533932_540752•

*BRE:	she's not well enough . •924592_925262•
        But  I mean I think Gill sort of worries the fact I think she's, I mean nobody said she'd be in there till Christmas. •925262_930292•
        The doctor just said •930292_930932•

        But now it's gone down, but there's no ulcer she had a laparotomy on Friday   the tube. •948942_953572•
        And there's nothing wrong with her  it was just sort of it's just nerves isn't it? •954412_958862•
        Strain and nerves. •958872_959252•
*DAV:	I keep thinking, I mean I can  when I first met her . •959252_965662•

        I mean he wouldn't sack his ex wife. •101445_101555•
        She still works with him in the shop. •101555_101844•
        And Gill gave her job to go and work in the shop  and he wouldn't let her go and work in it. •101844_102311•
        I said I thought it was you? •102311_102462•
        She said no he kept saying oh  we'll start you in a month, start you in a month  if I get rid of her. •102462_102830•
