@Comment:	conversation #46 (Tape 015402)
*JEA:	old ferry coming over from   (.) erm Harwich to the Hook of Holland.And I, I used to   (.) sort of sit in er put   (.) sit myself in my little erm bunk you know?
*BRE:	Yeah. ((yawn)) 
*JEA:	And the, the swaying of the ship and I used to sleep like a log.Everybody else round me was being sick. ((laugh)) Not me. ((laugh)) 
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) .I didn't sleep very well at all. (.) Up and down up and down   (.) all night.
*JEA:	You have?
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	Why?
*BRE:	Don't know.I
*JEA:	Excitement?
*BRE:	I think, a lot of it, you know I was   (.) burning a bit so I think a lot of it was sort of it thinking about that blooming boiler.
*JEA:	Yes.Yes.
*BRE:	And then you know Dave I think drew   (.) he was, he was ever so, ever so restless. [yawning] I don't know whether he was expecting the water to burst   (.) or what it was  [] .
*JEA:	Yeah I know.Ooh I know.
*BRE:	Cos when I went to bed I mean, you know I tested it and it didn't seem too bad.
*JEA:	No.No.
*BRE:	It seemed sort of hot   (.) but er   (.) I mean that's the trouble at the moment because   (.) even if it's something minor thing, it seems so dramatic.
*JEA:	Exactly.
*BRE:	You know especially to me at the moment.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	I don't know why.The smallest thing   (.) I mean it seems such a  (.) 
*JEA:	Well I think   (.) there must, this must be a very common feeling for a lot of people   (.) that they feel that they're balanced on a knife edge.There's so much   (.) we've had to pay out so much   (.) erm you've had to pay out so much on, on more mortgage than you expected.
*BRE:	Mm.Did you, saying that, did you see that programme on   (.) let me think   [yawning] oh dear  [] .It was on repossession. (.) One day in the week or the week before.It was on er channel four I think it was   (.) and it was all about these people that had been, you know encouraged to buy this house and then repossessed.
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	And   (.) did you watch it?
*JEA:	No I didn't see that one.
*BRE:	Oh it was horrible.And it was how people you know didn't want to er   (.) and they wouldn't.And they were saying that you don't give, the local erm MP was saying you know people just give their kids up and walk away.
*JEA:	Mhm yes.Mm.
*BRE:	And, but it was awful you know.There was so many of them.
*JEA:	It should not happen.I I mean I think it, somewhere somebody is being greedy.It shouldn't happen.And it seems to have happened because   (.) thirty years ago everybody like Jerry and me had a repayment mortgage which meant there were very few endowment mortgages.
*BRE:	Mm?
*JEA:	Now a repayment mortgage   (.) they will extend the term of the mortgage.
*BRE:	Yeah but when we had a when we had   (        ) 
*JEA:	And the endowment you can't extend it.Well I think they should make it so that you can extend it.
*BRE:	Yeah but when they 
*JEA:	I just don't think I just don't think repossessions should happen.
*BRE:	But repayment now is due as an endowment.
*JEA:	Well they should do something about it Brenda.That's all I can say.There should be some   (.) certain fund for bailing out people who are in real, terrible difficulties.Because you see 
*BRE:	Yeah because 
*JEA:	people   (.) people are not being helped.It's like my Neil.Nobody was helping him.
*BRE:	Nobody wants to know, do they?
*JEA:	No they don't. (.) 
*BRE:	Not with things sort of going on there's   (.) and now you think sort of it, it's time when people sort of would   (.) club together.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	But it was saying, er this, this programme was saying that that   (.) erm   (.) that they were buying a house.And it was telling you   (.) you know say they were, for argument's sake they was buying this house that was sort of up north and that.And they were buying this house and it was worth something like   (.) I don't know, they were, they'd got a twenty five grand mortgage.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	They hadn't got   (.) it it wasn't, I mean   (.) you know to us it was qu , a cheap mortgage but sort of up there it was probably, you know sort of 
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	a lot of money to him cos there's not the work and that.And they'd bought this mortgage and their repayment was something like about I dunno a hundred and eighty pound a month.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And they said you know, and then all of a sudden it had sort of gone up six percent.
*JEA:	Yes.That's right.
*BRE:	And it was five hundred quid.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And there was no way, you know at a hundred and eighty they'd struggled.
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	And they thought, because   (.) most people were, were sort of us.We thought oh we'll go for it.
*JEA:	Yes.Yes.
*BRE:	It's gonna be a struggle for a year.But you go for it.
*JEA:	Yeah of course.
*BRE:	And you don't dream of it
*JEA:	No.Nobody ever dreamed
*BRE:	going up.
*JEA:	Nobody ever dreamed of this. (.) 
*BRE:	I mean they reckon it's gonna go back up now don't they?
*JEA:	Yeah.Probably will. (.) I, you see I think that instead of, instead of Lawson putting interest rates up to squeeze inflation out of the economy   (.) he should have stopped all credit.When Jerry and I   (.) were young   (.) if at the end of the month there was no money in the account   (.) the bank used to write you a filthy letter if you were two pounds overdrawn.And you had   (.) if   (.) it was no good you wanting something   (.) and waving a bit of plastic at it.There was no bit of plastic to wave then.
*BRE:	There wasn't?
*JEA:	Not a thing.If you wanted to borrow money from the bank to, to buy anything there were two ways of getting money.You could go to the bank and ask for a loan.And mostly you got a dusty answer because if you hadn't got shares to put down as collateral, you didn't get your loan.And the other way of doing it was to go on hire purchase.And when you wanted to buy something like a three piece suite, you went to somewhere like Bentalls   (.) and they took you into a little room, soon as you said to the man well I want to buy this on hire purchase and you went in to a little room   (.) and the man sat down and you filled in a long form.You told him what your husband earned.Erm   (.) what you, er what you   (.) could manage in the way of repayments what, er er you had to put one third of the full price down.
*BRE:	Is that when you and Jerry were first married or
*JEA:	Yes.Yeah you had to put one third of the full price.So if a three piece suite cost say a hundred and fifty pounds, you had to put fifty pounds down.And the, the hundred over over two years on, on interest.
*BRE:	So people couldn't get in that state could they?You
*JEA:	You, you could not get into debt Brenda.You were not allowed to.
*BRE:	What you could afford   (.) you had.
*JEA:	Exactly.Exactly.
*BRE:	Now when did the   (.) I suppose the credit card they brought   (.) but as to what you say I mean   (.) the, these, these repossessions it's not the fact   (.) they can't afford the mortgage.It's the fact they can't afford   (.) all the   (.) the, the lifestyle to go with it, that's what Dave says.I mean the fact is   (.) you know there's blokes at work.Same mortgage as us and earning the same as Dave.I mean, you know they're in a dreadful state.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	I mean they spend their wages before
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And I think it's because they go out drinking and   (.) you know
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	They're always buying things for the home.And the cars.I mean   (.) majority of blokes at Dave's firm have changed their cars three times.
*JEA:	Yeah.Yeah.I know.People have come to expect that.Now you could do it in the nineteen seventies and er   (.) well   (.) yes I would say from nineteen sixty eight onwards with   (.) plastic card and   (.) revolv , what's called revolving credit.You could just run up the credit.I mean my, all my efforts after Christmas will be to get rid of these card debts.I promised   (        ) 
*BRE:	Yeah but with you it's   (.) I mean, alright you don't want it over you, but you will clear it.
*JEA:	Oh yes.
*BRE:	But thing is there's a lot of people that, that that don't.
*JEA:	No.Quite.Quite.
*BRE:	I mean I know I told you this 
*JEA:	I mean the only reason I'm I'm running up these debts is that now   (.) I've got so little capital left, that I've got to keep the capital for sheer disasters like   (.) the boiler.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And because you've got to pay that in cash.
*BRE:	But there's people that   (.) you know are still now spending them at Christmas.It's like Jen, still spending them.You know he's still got like two holidays left on them.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	But then still runs it up for Christmas.
*JEA:	Yeah.I mean I, I now will do no spending   (        ) 
*BRE:	Yeah but you you didn't have   (.) thousands outstanding before you, you know by spending yours like yesterday.You didn't think to yourself oh god I owe five hundred pound on   (.) Marks and Sparks   (.) I'll top it up .
*JEA:	No I had a fifty pound debt.
*BRE:	That's it.
*JEA:	And when the er and I've now got what?Er three hundred. (.) Now that when, as soon as I get my cheque from the British Legion   (.) for two hundred, roughly.I won't wait for the card, for the bill to come in for the card.I shall send that off to Marks. (.) I won't wait for them to send to me.
*BRE:	Oh can you send it off?
*JEA:	Yeah..
*BRE:	Yeah it's gonna be sort of six   (.) well it's longer now isn't it?Before you get the bills   (.) it's about eight weeks they said now.Seven 
*JEA:	I don't know.But they'll, they'll get their money tout suite .
*BRE:	Cos you'll   (.) you probably won't get the bill in anyway till after, well after Christmas will you now?
*JEA:	No.But they'll get their money.
*BRE:	And then, when they send you the bill then will they just, you won't get so much interest on it?
*JEA:	No they'll just say payment, thank you.And   (.) won't be quite so much.
*BRE:	Mind you er and even easier, what annoys me   (.) they've put the interest rate down on the cards.
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	Charging everybody
*JEA:	Mm.Yeah.
*BRE:	A twelve pound   (.) charge but putting their rates down on it.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	So it encourages people even more doesn't it?
*JEA:	Course it does.
*BRE:	Think, oh well   (.) when we normally was paying you know, I think Jenny's is something like
*JEA:	Twenty three percent A P R.It was, it was two   (.) it was something like two percent a month.
*BRE:	Jenny's is something like about   (.) eighty pound a month   (.) interest.
*JEA:	She must have a colossal debt.
*BRE:	Mm. (.) And then I said, cos I said well how are you doing your Christmas shopping.Mm flexi friends.
*JEA:	 ((sigh)) 
*BRE:	The majority of people   (.) I mean
*JEA:	I, I mean my five hundred pound limit on Marks   (.) was what I asked for.I could have asked for far more.They ask you 
*BRE:	When I talked to my mum, she had about a grand on, on debts.
*JEA:	Mm.Yeah.They ask you what you want.
*BRE:	And then she went in one day and she knew she'd had a thousand and said can I extend it?
*JEA:	Yeah.That's right.
*BRE:	Yeah, course you can.
*JEA:	Well do you know what my, did I tell you what my extension is, what happened with the   (.) Access.When I got into money difficulties in Woking.I simply phoned them and erm   (.) they put, they put it up   (.) so that I could buy things   (.) on Access that I could get, well I mean those were the days when I knew that you could sell a house like
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	just like that.I didn't know that I was going to have to sell my house for twenty five thousand less than all my neighbours were selling at.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And I mean this is where you get caught.
*BRE:	Mind you, you think if you'd stayed in there now.
*JEA:	Well I don't know what would have happened to me.
*BRE:	You'd have just, well I mean
*JEA:	Couldn't have survived.No.
*BRE:	They, they reckon they're going for about ninety five to a hundred and five down there.
*JEA:	Oh no.
*BRE:	Yeah!Cos I tell you who's   (.) not   (.) Poo next door to Poo.That was up for sale. (.) That hasn't gone still.That's been on the market for   (.) oh ages.And the corner house is up for sale.Next to you on the, the house on the   (.) if you stand at your front door
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	on the left.
*JEA:	Oh Heath, yes.On Heathlands Drive.
*BRE:	Yeah.On the corner that's for sale.
*JEA:	The 
*BRE:	Yeah.
*JEA:	Remember the ?Musical girl?
*BRE:	Yeah.Yeah.And that is I think going for about ninety eight.
*JEA:	 [whispering] That's ridiculous Brenda  [] .
*BRE:	Mm.Mm.
*JEA:	I know that if I wanted to come back here   (.) this is the time that I could do so.
*BRE:	Mm.Oh well it's a buyer's market isn't it?If you haven't got   (.) have mortgages and that.
*JEA:	I'm waiting until, I'm not thinking about the prices of anywhere until I've sold.Because 
*BRE:	And then you'll you'll get more value by selling yours up there, than you would down here.
*JEA:	Mm.Yes.Yes.
*BRE:	Much more because
*JEA:	Well.Houses are selling there.Very very slowly.But you do see   (.) the moving vans on the go.
*BRE:	Yeah.I mean they're they're talk , you was talking about   (.) a good year on the market round here.
*JEA:	Well   (.) I put mine on the market about ten week's ago.I haven't had a look, I haven't had a nibble yet.
*BRE:	No. (.) 
*JEA:	No it will be interesting, it will be interesting to see 
*BRE:	After Christmas it will.
*JEA:	Yes.Interesting to see exactly where the prices settle down.
*BRE:	Where was it they, oh that was it erm this repossession programme, they also had a house auction.And they had flats in London and there was like   (.) sort of   (        ) guys like Peter   (.) there.And they interviewed them afterwards.And one guy had bought three.He'd bought two flats in London
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and they rated at   (.) with the high, when the house boom was on
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	they were going for about a hundred thousand.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	He picked two flats up there for forty five thousand.
*JEA:	You can, in Ipswich erm   (.) Paul was looking at the, at the property you know because he'd like to meet a girl and the two of them, he'd like to buy   (.) and he'd like to meet some girl who's already got perhaps er either a council flat or   (.) something.He said that he and Karen could have, he said at the present prices he and this Karen that he's, that left him   (.) er they, they could have had erm a place together because   (.) some one bedroom flats, two bedroom flats around are going at thirty five thousand, thirty one.Prices like that up in the Ipswich area.
*BRE:	Mm.But this was for two flats.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And th it was like there was this couple and they were like I dunno   (.) about   (.) sixty, sixty five the pair of them.And they had no mortgage and they had a   (.) a little bungalow and everything.And erm   (.) th they went to an auction and she was saying how interesting it was.And she could have a like four bedroom house for fifty five thousand.
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	You know.I mean they, and they were in good areas.
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	But what it was, they were like   (.) it was like G A N do them er Man and Co And they had sort of like   (.) a job like Dave's and a lot of them what they've done   (.) is they've bought in this area, I mean probably most areas they've bought   (.) the repossessed they've got about eight or nine houses   (.) they're either renting them out or they're leaving them empty.The majority of them are empty round here.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	And then they'll just hang on to them
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	for about five or six years till the house goes up and then.
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.They, the building societies are worried about their repossessed houses.They thought that it was going to be all easy.I read this in the Telegraph.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	They thought oh, easy we're going to
*BRE:	Sell them at
*JEA:	parcel them out amongst the estate agents.And the estate agents don't want to know.Because people don't want to buy a repossessed house.For one thing they think it's unlucky.And the second thing is that repossessed houses very very quickly begin to look dirty and battered.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And   (.) I mean I remember myself when I was a young girl   (.) that you used to walk along a road and you'd see houses that were going to rack and ruin.And you see   (.) it's the central heating and the women opening and shutting doors and running round and keep 
*BRE:	But they don't
*JEA:	It's people who keep the houses going.
*BRE:	But there was a house on this repossession and   (.) it was sort of like   (.) just a sort of young couple and they'd bought this house and it was like a two bedroom house   (.) and they'd done up beautiful.
*JEA:	Ah.
*BRE:	Really nice.Well they just fell behind you know I mean
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	they obviously   (.) I mean, quite an expensive sort of social life and everything.
*JEA:	Yeah.
*BRE:	Whatever.And they just couldn't, he lost his job which is the same old story and er   (.) anyway they went back to visit and they kee they go back every two or three weeks to visit this house.They've got a ki , no they've got kids.They had got   (.) three kiddies that's right, cos the council housed them.And they were in this grotty council house now and they go back and they said   (.) and you saw them going back and saying look at the state of the garden.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	Look at the state of the, the woodwork looks tatty and
*JEA:	That's right.
*BRE:	we spent all these years on this and
*JEA:	Yes, yes.
*BRE:	all the mail and junk letters all through the door and everything looked tatty.
*JEA:	Mm.Mm.Mm.Mm.
*BRE:	And they said you know   (.) th there should have been a way round it where they kept this couple in there.
*JEA:	There should.There should.
*BRE:	It's now been empty six months.
*JEA:	Even if it's even if people had sold their houses to the local council   (.)  (        ) .You see in in, on the continent they do not build   (.) council ghettos.Li you know, like you lived in.Where you walk in and think oh these must be council houses as you're driving through.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	You, you find a house to rent   (.) that seems right for your   (.) about the price, perhaps a bit high but about right for your   (.) level of income.And you go to the local housing agency er the, the council housing agency, and you get a   (.) grant to help you with your rent.So that there aren't special council houses.An any house could be a council house.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And it means that
*BRE:	I don't think the council can afford to do it now can they?
*JEA:	No.They can't but they, it should, it should have been possible for the councils to have   (.) I don't know it, it   (.) it seems   ((sigh)) I, I put it down, I remember walking up and down on the beach with John  about eight weeks ago was it?He came to see me, it was before I had this illness er these two illnesses.Or was it after the diarrhoea but before the two lovely colds?And we were walking up and down on the beach at Aldeburgh   (.) and the most interesting part of our conversation was   (.) that we were saying we both started out as   (.) not conservatives, I've never voted conservative in my life, but we started out as very loyal people.British justice was marvellous.British parliament was wonderful.The queen is great.And John  said I now don't believe in anything.I mean   (.) you're talking, you're talking about old   (.) middle class rather staid people.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And, you should be taping this  ((laugh)) .
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEA:	You are! ((laugh)) Don't mean any disloyalty.Don't take me to the tower. ((laugh)) Erm   (.) but erm   (.) he was saying   (.) he now sees the weaknesses in   (.) and how, how pathetic are governments are.
*BRE:	Mm.Well they reckon now I mean 
*JEA:	I mean the poll tax Brenda!The poll tax!
*BRE:	But they make me die because   (.) you, you you're a day, I mean we got this sort of letter the bailiffs were coming in    (        )  (.) because we were a day late.A day late
*JEA:	Ridiculous.
*BRE:	on it.And I said   (.) there's people out there that don't even pay it!You know and   (.) I mean cos Dave totally refuses on on the poll tax to have a standing order or direct debit.
*JEA:	I have to Brenda.I have no option.
*BRE:	Yeah.Well he just totally sort of because I think he knows 
*JEA:	I, I was 
*BRE:	so many people that don't pay it.
*JEA:	Well it makes me very bitter because the , this is the sort of thing that John  and I we were going over   (.) one thing after the other.We we were brought up to believe that if you didn't do the right thing you would be punished.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And   (.) people are getting away with it.
*BRE:	But what I can't understand, I mean majority of people I mean erm   (.) you've gotta pay the debt in the end whatever.
*JEA:	Course you have. (        ) 
*BRE:	Why keep putting it off?People put it off and that is where they get in the trouble.
*JEA:	Well I don't know that it's that.I think that people who are living in a fixed abode are paying   (.) in the end.They're being taken to court and made to pay.But it's people like my lodger.
*BRE:	Yeah but they were saying now, it's like our, in the like local paper   (.) the poll tax is gonna    (        )  (.) prob , might be even go up double because of the non-payers.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	Because of not 
*JEA:	That makes me very angry.
*BRE:	not having to take them all, I mean having to take them to court.And they said, just said in the end   (.) again there was er an article or something and it was saying that   (.) you know that er did did you eventually get the money?And they said no they had to write it off.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	They never ever did pay it.
*JEA:	Well   (.) they are spending a fortune on hounding Paul. (.) They don't   ((sigh)) somebody
*BRE:	Cos he's at no fixed address is he?
*JEA:	Well   (.) he, he left   (.) he was with Karen   (.) he came to me   (.) he left me and went down to Gloucester   (.) he dithered about running up and down the road between Gloucester   (.) and here er Stowmarket.
*BRE:	Stowmarket. ((laugh)) 
*JEA:	Erm   (.) not knowing where he was going to, to park his bottom.And eventually, well I had a, I had a questionnaire   (.) letters were coming to him which I sent back because I, Paul had never told me where he lived in Gloucester.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	And I   (.) they were addressed to him and they were from the council and I simply said, er wrote on the outside   (.) erm no longer here, address not known.Which was true. (.) And then they sent me a questionnaire saying   (.) they understood that he'd   (.) he'd given my address, and was he res , was he still resident?And I said no.Did I know his address?I said no.Eventually an expensive chap, you're talking fifteen thousand a year, an expensive chap comes to interview me.
