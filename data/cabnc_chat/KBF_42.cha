*LEE:	Mhm. •103815_103837•
*BRE:	And then  if you don't get it tomorrow perhaps one night after school  •103837_104339•
*LEE:	It might be easier just to hire one. •104340_104497•
*BRE:	No. •104497_104511•
        Why pay fifty quid to hire one? •104511_104642•
*JEA:	It's ridiculous. •104731_104826•
*LEE:	 (        ) 
*BRE:	When you're gonna pay seventy five quid and you've got one. •104826_105148•
*JEA:	Mm. •105148_105171•
        Mm  •105218_105254•
*LEE:	Yeah but where am I gonna wear it again? •105254_105430•
        I'll  would  outgrown it within a few months. •105430_105536•
*BRE:	Well no you buy a size bigger. •105536_105685•
*JEA:	Oh definitely yes. •105721_105802•
*BRE:	You like them bigger. •105802_105856•
        I mean you buy it you're not gonna, I mean  alright you're gonna have a bit more grown but you're only gonna get a bit more muscly. •105856_106544•
        And you like them baggy anyway, you don't get one that fits you er buy  That's why I said it would have been probably better to pay the extra twenty quid and bought the Italian style double- breasted •106545_107459•
*JEA:	Mm. •107459_107487•
*BRE:	for their baggy effect see. •107493_107667•

        It's dear. •109480_109523•
*BRE:	Yeah but I don't, see savings they've got on suits at the moment, special offers on them cos they're not shifting them. •109542_110135•
        But it's ridiculous you  fifty quid a night to hire a suit. •110135_110566•
        Because you pay your fifty pound and that's it. •110566_110935•
        But this suit, I mean. •110935_111028•
