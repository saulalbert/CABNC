*NOE:	Moderator and friends let me say first of all that I'm glad to  be able to make these speeches  on behalf of the member churches of   and I'd like to  also on, particularly on behalf of the England and Wales , though I did realise having said that  that you have a minister of the University of Penryth is also a member of this Synod, and therefore, you've got me three things! •242131_244220•
        Er •244220_244232•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	I greet you  greet you on   on behalf of these. •244232_244758•
        And, but I, I'm glad to make a greeting from a, a wide range of churches  erm, I've got to discard this figure because I've got . •244758_245590•
        But including churches that are,Orthodox church and the Lutheran  Lutheran churches in Wales  and now  hopefully, during this year  some sanctity  churches in Wales. •245705_246958•
        And so that there will be a  a broad spectrum of people  who with us  confess a common faith, serve a common Lord and proclaim about our gospel  serving within this number of people in Wales and therefore I'm glad to bring you greetings  for that reason. •247079_248604•
        I'm glad to bring you greetings because  I think you serve a particularly unimportant purpose! •248687_249222•
        When, when I was asked to comment  before  John was, was ever elected  erm  is that  you elect moderators from , whatever happened to a moderator! •249246_250379•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	before you were chosen by whatever process  a number of us was asked to comment and one of the things I felt it important to say  was that the URC plays a very important role  both in being a bridge between all these nations  but also serving a particular reform tradition within Wales. •250463_252174•
        And that this larger responsibility, having more local responsibility combined in one small church is an important role. •252322_253065•
        But I think that came through in this morning's conversation. •253142_253350•
        And I'm glad also to  to to  greeting, it's my last part John, if you'd like to know! •253491_253974•
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*NOE:	Erm  because  out of that debate this morning I sense you have much to offer the rest of us  and I hope that that conversation will not be a conversation confined your Synod or to the  to the assembly of URC  but that we'll find ways of sharing that perception of ministry  with those of us in other churches  cos  you don't need me to tell me, tell you that that key question in the whole ecumenical debate, not just in these nations but worldwide  and I think that from within this reform tradition in which I share  I will hope that we will find ways of offering that perception  of ministry, in all its forms  as erm, a symbol and a sign of the ministry of the whole people of God  we have that to offer the churches in Wales  and worldwide  and I hope that we can find ways of doing that. •254014_259350•
        And for those reasons  and for the fact that I, more or less enjoyed the journey  and had to come anyway as a chauffeur! •259399_260067•
*UNK:	 ((laugh))  ((applause))
*UNK:	Thank you Noel. •260111_260381•

*ALA:	Thank you moderator. •261828_261900•

        All those in favour. •271460_271722•
