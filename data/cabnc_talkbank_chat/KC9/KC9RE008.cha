*PS0CG:	Well a quart is two pints .  680613_682463
*PS0CK:	Yeah .  682463_682613
*PS0CG:	And point five of a quart is one pint That makes it three pints Why they ca n't put three pints on instead of one point five quarts .  682613_689313

*PS0CJ:	I knew the face .  724703_725123
*PS0CG:	Used to go in for your model paints and coloured marbles .  725123_727013
*PS0CK:	That 's right yeah .  728153_729843

*PS0CK:	All those years I was there .  731833_732923
*PS0CG:	You have n't have n't changed You have n't changed I mean your face I knew straight out It was your hair that got me .  732923_737273
*PS0CK:	Well the grey come through and I was just sort of I thought I ca n't wait all those years with dark hair I had a friend who had long hair and she she let it grow right the way through And for nearly seven years she looked like an old woman of eighty .  737273_751523
*PS0CG:	Yes .  751523_751583
*PS0CK:	And I thought I am not gon na have that .  751583_753303
*PS0CG:	Well that 's right I agree with you .  753343_755213
*PS0CK:	So I more or less had a crew cut .  755213_756563

*PS0CG:	I know oh yes it always grows a dark bit .  762513_764073
*PS0CK:	but that all took I think when you 're older when you go grey it 's it you look softer and you get away with the grey coming through on white hair .  764073_770803
*PS0CG:	Yes That 's right .  770803_771393
