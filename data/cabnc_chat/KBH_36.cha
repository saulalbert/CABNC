*CAR:	Now do you know where two is in your mind?
*CAR:	Mm.
*CAR:	 (        ) , sorry the and, do you know where it comes in the troll?
*CAR:	In the middle.
*CAR:	Yes, on that F sharp, right.
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	Mm, one and two and, lovely, that's it, got it?
*CAR:	Mhm.
*CAR:	Though watch the beat there, then we'll be fine, good, let's go on.
*CAR:	 ((piano music)).
*CAR:	Yeah, now, are you going to put an F   (.) you put a four on that, so if you're doing it there, do a four also.
*CAR:	What on the A you mean?
*CAR:	 (        ) , yes on the A.
*CAR:	Oh right.
*CAR:	 (        ) the same.
*CAR:	What was I doing?
*CAR:	Put a five.
*CAR:	Oh right.

*CAR:	 ((piano music)) ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Then a four.
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	Good.Yes, now I wouldn't slur those quite so much as I would make that all legato.You try putting a thumb on the A, no do, do this slowly, making the whole thing legato.
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	The thumb da, da, yes, but, if you're in   ((piano music))it's a cord of G, you'll put a two on the B, final note, and then go up to a five on a G, not a one, it's better   (        ) to do that, see if you can try.
*CAR:	 ((playing piano))
*CAR:	That's it, do you find that difficult?
*CAR:	No, just awkward.
*CAR:	If, if, if you can't  ((piano music)), if you prefer to put a one there cross it out with a vengeance.
*CAR:	 (        ) Well I  (        ) .
*CAR:	Take a rubber to it. ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	 ((laugh)) I try to  (        ) .
*CAR:	And, it's, it's better roll than keep on using the thumb to get you out of the keyboard   ((piano music))but, if, I don't want it to spoil
*CAR:	Well I see, if it, if it.
*CAR:	See how it goes, but that's, that's good, now let me just  (        ) .
*CAR:	 ((piano music))
*CAR:	Good, very good  (        ) .
