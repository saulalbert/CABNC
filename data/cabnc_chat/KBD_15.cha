*TER:	I know!I just can't.Bob'll know.
*BAR:	Well you probably, I mean you, you as, you as well, so   (.) I mean, you probably won't 
*TER:	No he's 
*BAR:	be able to get there till this evening and you probably won't be able to see him will you?
*TER:	No.Well a as long as he knows I'm looking for him.They erm   (.) wa when we to we, we were staying at the Claremont   (.) and   (.) I don't, oh, I think we just decided we'd find a cup of coffee.It was M S F thing, we were with Margaret  about the   (.) M S F.And   (.) said, oh, let's go and find a cup of coffee   (.) but, have a bit of a walk and walk down to conference but we'll not walk down the prom
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	we'll walk down the road at the back   (.) and we'd only just turned round the corner from the Claremont and we found this restaurant   (.) and it was, it was an absolutely brilliant chef, really nice restaurant, really high quality   (.) and it was   (.) was   (.) quite reasonable price, it wasn't cheap.
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	So, when we found this we thought ooh, this is alright!You know, we'll   (.) so we've been quite a few times since, but I cannot think of the name of it.You see, Jim doesn't like, I mean, we'd go to Carriages probably   (.) cos it's a   (.) a proper Italian
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	that absolutely reeks with garlic and   (.) all the rest of it.Well   (.) that means Jim will pull a face!Or he'll start going 
*BAR:	Oh, this big international financier!
*TER:	Oh!No!Not, I mean, is the, when it comes down to food   (.) wi he's a traditionalist.So we've always got to find somewhere to eat that's 
*BAR:	You're gonna be pushed getting, you know, roast beef and Yorkshire in Brussels aren't you?
*TER:	God knows!
*BAR:	Steak and kidney pie!
*TER:	You're joking!Cos everybody sort of, just try to think, think of in Brussels.Why they go, they go to er   (.) a six course sort of have as much main course as you like.It's a   (.) a   (.) a re a really nice restaurant   (.) but you can pick all your food raw   (.) and they just, there's a chef cooking, and you just get one of these plates, you can have as many helpings as you want, they serve you a cold starter and a hot starter   (.) but there's   (.) a buffet that's about   (.) half the size of our club   (.) and one side of it it's all   (.) fish on a wet fish slab, and steak, and veal, and chicken and   (.) so there's every sort of meat you can think of, and you can pick a wooden platter full of it, so you go and give it the chef with this number that they give you   (.) and then they come serve you with whatever you want.And you can have as many helpings of whatever you want.And the salad stuff   (.) and fresh fruit and all that sort of thing, takes   (.) about the full length of our bar up   (.) you know, you, you couldn't think of a salad that isn't there.But you can't, and there's, then there's loads of hot veg.
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	There's no vegetables you can't mention.I think it's about twenty quid a head, but you can actually have as many meals as you want, or as many puddings as you want.
*BAR:	Yeah.
*TER:	It's   (.) it really is   (.) really very, very good.The Labour Party came to   (.) to use that quite a lot.Because   (.) they've got   (.) big seating areas as well, where they put, sort of eight tables together and all your party can sit together.
*BAR:	Mm.
*TER:	When we were there   (.) Stan  was with us and he'd   (.) been a few times to Brussels   (.) to with the Labour Party and, and he said oh it's great!Because   (.) usually you go off to a restaurant and if there's twenty of you   (.) you can't sit together can you?
*BAR:	No.No.
*TER:	But, he said, this restaurant makes a particular thing of   (.) seating big parties.It was a brilliant restaurant!Really   (.) really   (.) nice.So   (.) you know
*BAR:	Sergio's going to erm   (.) erm   (.) one, some Cubs visit to London at er   (.) half term.
*TER:	Baden Powell House?
*BAR:	Yeah, but the 
*TER:	Mary took it.It's brilliant!Absolutely great!
*BAR:	And er, so she said   (.) she, she wants to take the last couple of days away 
*TER:	Mm.
*BAR:	so she's, her aunty's going to Dublin, so I got these things and they were really cheap actually.There's the train fare from here to Holyhead return, the ferry, transfers to their hotel   (.) the best hotel in Dublin, The Burlington
*TER:	Mm.
*BAR:	is absolutely stupendous!Two nights bed and breakfast, full Irish breakfast, which means   [laughing] you won't need to eat until the evening  [] !
*TER:	You won't eat again.No.
*BAR:	Erm   (.) train, free bus passes round Dublin, includes their bus fares and, and train on those sort of metro type thing 
*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	they have in Dublin   (.) all for eighty five quid!
*TER:	Eh?
*BAR:	I know.
*TER:	Why?
*BAR:	The only problem is, that the hotel that Mary's like, ah!This looks beautiful.Cos I, I, that second hotel, (        ) hotel, the only thing, is the Burlington.And I daren't, I'm not gonna tell her, but I, I, I'm trying to say, well, it's a little bit out, it's in a park and er,th th but it looks gorgeous!I said, yeah I know.And it was, where they had their honeymoon.
*TER:	 ((laugh)) 
*BAR:	So I'm going, oh no!Not for    (        )  (.) just er   (.) Siobhan, and sister-in-law, erm   (.) is the head of Town and Travel and, Manchester 
*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	Town and Travel, and she got   (.) the   (.) presidential suite at the Burlington which is like a, you know, I mean, erm, it's absolutely gorgeous!And it was, it was about two hundred pounds a night and got it for ten pounds a night. ((laugh))  (.) That was about, well, ten years ago, when   (.) well   (.) well it's really appropriate.So I think, well   (.) this is a, this is actually on O'Connell Street, that's right in the centre.But I mean, that's actually th th one, one of the, that was the, the, the other ones like four star hotels were on O'Connell Street which actually opens    (        )  (.) only seventy seven quid.
*TER:	I know.
*BAR:	That's including all that travel and
*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	and   (.) I mean, it's incredible though!
*TER:	Mm.
*BAR:	And it's something like twenty quid for an extra night if you want to stay, the problem is the Holyhead ferries, they're dreadful!You know 
*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	one gets you in at seven fifteen which means   (.) you're only really getting one day
*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	you know, for that price, cos
*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	by the time you got in, checked in, got into the hotel, it's gonna be nine o'clock.
*TER:	Yeah.
*BAR:	You've missed the day, and, you've got Saturday then,th  (.) ferry back is ten o'clock on the Mo or whatever day, but the ferry back is at ten o'clock in the morning so you've got to leave at eight o'clock.
*TER:	So you really need to go the day before.
*BAR:	I mean, really, you've got to book an extra night to be honest.
*TER:	Mm.That's what I mean, you 
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.
*TER:	there's no point in you going 
*BAR:	No.
*TER:	for that, I mean, all you're doing is going on a ferry   (        ) 
*BAR:	I mean if the fe if the ferries were like   (.) early sort of bo got you in at lunch time
*TER:	Mm.
*BAR:	then that would be alright.And, and, that you could get say 
*TER:	Yeah.Cos you'd have more in the following day.
*BAR:	get say a late afternoon one back.Cos it's, and it's only about two and half  (        ) .
*TER:	Has it got to be on the ferry has it?
*BAR:	Yeah.Yeah.Cos it's part of the, that's why it's so cheap.
