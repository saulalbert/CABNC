*FRE:	Is that  •_•
*JOA:	Let me er I I'll get my glasses. •_•
*FRE:	It's come away from the zip er er I don't know whether it's er  •_•
*JOA:	Oh! •_•
*FRE:	repairable is it? •_•
*JOA:	Well that's easy, it only wants sewing up there Fred. •_•
*FRE:	Oh does it? •_•
*JOA:	Yes, do you want me to do it for you? •_•
*FRE:	If you would I'd be glad. •_•
*JOA:	Do you want it now or or later? •_•
*FRE:	No, no no, any time. •_•
*JOA:	Yes, that's simple. •_•
        Simple. •_•
        Have you got a zip in? •_•
        Oh yes your zip's the other, the other side. •_•
*FRE:	Ah yeah. •_•
*JOA:	Yes, will do. •_•
        It wouldn't take long to do it now but  I can't be bothered   •_•
*FRE:	No don't. •_•
*JOA:	being lazy. •_•
        Oh peace after Heidi! •_•
        she  was it the week, the new year's weekend? •_•
        She was away at Malcolm's cousin's  from the Sunday till the Wednesday evening  and we hadn't realized how much noise she makes until she came home on the Wednesday evening. •_•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	Three lovely peaceful days   then she comes in   peace is shattered,oh dear . •_•
        She's so full of life, whereas Tasha could be around and you'd •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	you, you didn't know she was er here, she'd have a book or some  •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	But the other night when Heidi, when she was practising her song, she's so dramatic all the time going  you know if only she'd do that when she's on the stage  you know put erm action into her singing. •_•
*FRE:	When's it taking place? •_•
*JOA:	Erm it's the last Saturday of half term so I should think it's about erm  when's half term? •_•
        Eighteenth on the Monday I think  so it'll be twenty  erm it's the fifth is it when I, no it won't  it's not as late as that is it  eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty one  about the twenty second, something like that. •_•
        It's usually the last Saturday of the half term because then she can have them during the week to practise. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	Well the, all the others go on a Saturday but Heidi said she would be in it if she didn't have to go on Saturday, every Saturday, because she goes riding you see at nine o'clock  nine till  four  so er Wendy said oh she'll have her up on a Sunday afternoon  the two or three principals. •_•
        And this erm play we went to  in The Haymarket, it was, it was difficult for children to understand but er  the scenery, the way they use the scenery, it was absolutely fantastic, you know, to make the  of a desert and a •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	all the satellites hanging down  it was very good the way it had all been done in, in that respect but  what I found was the first bit was very boring,I found  but when it got going a bit it was better but  the whole moral of the story was that nowhere is perfect to live  but it's hard for young children like this to   •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah quite. •_•
*JOA:	to know what it's all about, yeah. •_•
*FRE:	Quite. •_•
*JOA:	Gosh that was quick   •_•
*VIC:	Well straight up, Wendy was there so  straight up. •_•
*JOA:	Oh, it makes a change that Wendy's there on time. •_•
        She's a teacher at the school, you know, Wendy . •_•
        I don't know whether you've come across her at all. •_•
        That's how er Heidi started going to her drama classes. •_•
*FRE:	Er no  I was trying do you know I can't remember er Mrs  's christian name. •_•
*VIC:	Irene. •_•
*FRE:	Irene. •_•
        Yeah, I know it as well as anything but er er •_•
*VIC:	At times you just •_•
*FRE:	er er I don't know why I was thinking about it yesterday for some reason, oh probably because I got erm  the official invite to the er thing on Friday. •_•
*VIC:	Another cup of coffee Fred? •_•
*FRE:	Er no thank you. •_•
*VIC:	Would you like another cup? •_•
*JOA:	No thank you dear. •_•
        Is Wendy bringing her back? •_•
*VIC:	Er  •_•
*FRE:	Which is Wendy? •_•
        what's she look like? •_•
*VIC:	Erm  well I'd say it's curly sort of  oh it's dark hair, curlyish •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*VIC:	with glasses. •_•
*JOA:	And she never stops talking. •_•
*VIC:	Never stops talking. •_•
        Takes the younger age, reception age er  •_•
*FRE:	What was the name of the  teacher  tended to be on the slim side, longish hair, at the  do at Christmas? •_•
        She was with the children er er, looking at the stage, to the left. •_•
        Forty fiveish, fifty? •_•
*VIC:	Was she wearing trousers? •_•
*FRE:	Can't remember. •_•
*JOA:	Kay? •_•
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*JOA:	She was with the children. •_•
*FRE:	Don't tell me the er if you tell me the •_•
*VIC:	Kay   •_•
*FRE:	in fact she  •_•
*VIC:	Maybe I don't know her. •_•
*FRE:	she spoke to me as er er as though  •_•
*JOA:	No Lucy. •_•
*FRE:	as though she'd known me, you know, but I couldn't even remember seeing her before. •_•
        Don't think it was Kay. •_•
*VIC:	No, trying to think who else was there. •_•
*JOA:	Well it wouldn't be Heather  cos she's dark and short and young. •_•
*VIC:	Small? •_•
        No. •_•
*FRE:	Well •_•
*VIC:	Small erm •_•
*FRE:	not •_•
*VIC:	not particularly small  •_•
*FRE:	Is it er I, I mean I I'm •_•
*JOA:	I, I've no idea. •_•
*FRE:	I would have said she was medium height  slim build, possibly •_•
*VIC:	It's the only one I can think of that could  •_•
*FRE:	and er  •_•
*JOA:	remember seeing somebody in trousers. •_•
*VIC:	Yeah Kay, down to about her ears? •_•
        Yes. •_•
        That was Kay wasn't it? •_•
*JOA:	I, I don't I don't know Kay. •_•
*FRE:	what was the surname again? •_•
*VIC:	
*FRE:	, may have been her. •_•
        The funny thing was I was asking Irene who she was because I couldn't remember seeing her and then, later on, she came up to me  as though she'd known me, you know ? •_•
*VIC:	Yeah. •_•
        It was very good wasn't it? •_•
        The er •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, mm. •_•
*JOA:	And an unusual slant •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	on the story. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*VIC:	And then was it er a little while after that Malcolm and I went to see the  •_•
*JOA:	Racing Demons? •_•
*VIC:	No, the parents' panto  •_•
*JOA:	Oh yes. •_•
        Oh I didn't go. •_•
        You got me a ticket but I didn't go did I. •_•
        A cheese. •_•
        What was that called? •_•
*VIC:	Crumple Stilton or something wasn't it? •_•
        The parents at the school all get together and do a pantomime for the children. •_•
        Erm  I think they, I think they do that during the day and then in the evening it's on for  anybody else who wants to see that  take-off on cheeses. •_•
        That was quite good. •_•
        Yeah we went to see Racing Demons at the beginning of December didn't we? •_•
        Cos we went with Margaret and Roger. •_•
*JOA:	Mm I suppose, yes. •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
        It was quite  quite good, at the Theatre Royal. •_•
*FRE:	Oh we got sidetracked er erm about erm tt Blind Date didn't I? •_•
        I, I said I was you were speaking to an expert  er so we went off at a blind  tangent. •_•
        But they, they er  I mean you don't have to be too bright to realize that the questions have been given them and the answers have been given them. •_•
*JOA:	Well somebody, it was Hazel wasn't it? •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
*JOA:	She erm said well of course they know the questions beforehand and the, the answers are always written out for them  erm  but I, I wouldn't have thought all the answers because some of them come over quite spontaneously. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah yeah, but they are rehearsing for  two and a half hours . •_•
        They don't see the person  they don't see the er  they're kept separate but erm they are  rehearsed. •_•
        So er,you know. •_•
        and I could erm  I, I erm her name was Barbara erm  Actually it was rather interesting there oh have you remembered the name of that club? •_•
*JOA:	No. •_•
*FRE:	I would know it if you told me. •_•
*JOA:	Well I can see it on   •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
        anyway it doesn't matter. •_•
        Er but she's a member and we went there for lunch and it was the ideal place, you know, cos there weren't any, many people around and so we had quite a nice lunch  and erm whilst we were there we then had a drink in er in the bar and erm her  the, the secretary of the club, a lady, came to talk to Barbara and she mentioned that she'd seen her on Blind Date you see, and so I got to know more by listening to them two speaking er and er that's where I learnt about er that. •_•
        Erm  •_•
*VIC:	Well some of the questions you think erm  you think erm  you know, aren't they a bit well way out or  what made them ask that. •_•
*JOA:	Well I've said all along  •_•
*FRE:	Yeah and and some of the answers. •_•
*JOA:	how do they think up those answers in such a  •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	short time but er  •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah yeah. •_•
*JOA:	now we know. •_•
        It takes some of the erm  tt  oh what's, what's the word? •_•
        When er •_•
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*JOA:	No. •_•
        When you, when you think that they're racking their brains and it  •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	seems far more interesting than knowing that they've rehearsed for hours on end. •_•
*FRE:	I think sometimes the odd er the odd times people are •_•
*JOA:	Putting a bit more •_•
*FRE:	Yeah,and in fact in the programme I  the one that Barbara was in, I can remember the er, as it happens, I, I was out er when that programme came on and I taped it so I I, I've still got that particular programme, and the lady at the end  er on one of her questions she'd obviously forgotten what she was going to say er and sort of made something up and er she turned to er as they were just panning away from her, she turned to her next door neighbour and more or less said  I forgot what I was going to say, you know. •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*FRE:	Mm. •_•
*JOA:	Cos they don't have any notes or anything do they? •_•
        So •_•
*FRE:	No, no, no, oh no I mean er  •_•
*JOA:	It's supposed to look natural   •_•
*FRE:	Yes, yes and erm  oh yes I mean some of the things that, especially the er the more senior people now  those people on the erm programme last night, did you see it? •_•
*JOA:	Yeah. •_•
*VIC:	Yeah. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, •_•
*VIC:	Clarence. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah  er they, they wouldn't have come out with some of the things about er  I can't remember what was said that erm you know er wouldn't mind meeting you in the bath or •_•
*JOA:	Yes or under the shower, yes. •_•
*FRE:	that, that, that you know that yeah, that sort of thing erm  •_•
*JOA:	I think they are a bit er  •_•
*FRE:	Yes. •_•
*JOA:	I suppose that's just   •_•
*FRE:	I mean it, oh yes I mean actually  •_•
*VIC:	Make it lighthearted. •_•
*FRE:	actually erm the, the er it is a very good, from the television people's point of view, it is an excellent programme because people are interested aren't they? •_•
*JOA:	Yes. •_•
*FRE:	and furthermore they're interested in, in the way out somebody and that, in fact I think  •_•
*JOA:	Looks a little bit different. •_•
*FRE:	they sometimes manipulate  the questions so that the person picks  •_•
*VIC:	To make them   •_•
*FRE:	the right one that they would like to be picked . •_•
        Do you know what I mean? •_•
*VIC:	yeah yeah, could be. •_•
*FRE:	Erm oh did you, did you see the one with that, it was last week when they came back I think, that naive bloke, lad from Devon? •_•
*JOA:	Oh yes. •_•
*FRE:	Dear oh dear oh dear! •_•
*VIC:	Was that the one where the girl was a •_•
*FRE:	Nurse. •_•
*JOA:	A nurse or yes. •_•
*VIC:	and she was only a bit older? •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
        That's the one  •_•
*JOA:	Yes his  •_•
*FRE:	that's the one. •_•
*VIC:	He was eighteen and she was nineteen or something  •_•
*JOA:	And she kept saying how childish he was. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, oh it was predictable that wasn't go to work. •_•
        He was wasn't he? •_•
        Very immature. •_•
*VIC:	How  far  in front of us seeing it is it erm recorded? •_•
*FRE:	Erm  I think Barbara, I think it was July when she did it. •_•
        So that would be, and that would be about either November or December wouldn't it? •_•
*JOA:	Yes. •_•
*VIC:	Cos I suppose they do so many recordings and then screen them don't they? •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah  •_•
*VIC:	Sort of for the series and then, then there's a break. •_•
*JOA:	Well Cilla Black's one of the highest paid  erm  presenters isn't she? •_•
        On the television. •_•
*FRE:	Mm. •_•
*JOA:	Esther Rantzen for the B B C and Cilla Black I think on the A T V. •_•
*FRE:	The erm  did you see the one where  this was er er for the more senior ones again, er about the fifty mark, where the fellow was a hypnotist and  a very nice fella •_•
*JOA:	I can remember now you say hypnotist but I can't remember what happened in the programme but I can remember him. •_•
*FRE:	and er she was er the one he  •_•
*JOA:	Because they were on about, in the answers, about him hypnotizing them, one of them was especially. •_•
*FRE:	Oh, and the, the trip they had was to er  the Middle East, erm  in the desert •_•
*JOA:	I didn't see that. •_•
*FRE:	Oh you didn't see it? •_•
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Ah. •_•
        Oh well er what I was going to say is that er  I thought I'd summed the person up that he'd selected and I, I thought oh she er it's not gonna be easy for him, and it wasn't, you know, she was a bit of a  bit of a so and so I think really. •_•
        Full of her own importance, you know? •_•
*JOA:	Yeah. •_•
*VIC:	I often wonder if, when they've selected  a person say right, I'll choose number three, when number one goes by and number two goes by afterwards if they think oh you know, no, I would have preferred number two. •_•
*FRE:	Oh they would, I'm sure a lot of that's done. •_•
*VIC:	Well do they  •_•
*JOA:	Wonder if they have a, a, a chance  •_•
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*JOA:	of meeting up with them. •_•
*VIC:	afterwards. •_•
*FRE:	Well I heard, I, I wondered about that, and  erm I think they must have contact because  erm one of them who came back  bearing in mind there must be a, a, a, about a three month gap, had had a proposal from one of the persons  •_•
*VIC:	One of the others. •_•
*FRE:	who er she didn't pick. •_•
*JOA:	Oh. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*VIC:	But sometimes you can see ooh that one and that one who just go together and they don't choose each other  •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •_•
*VIC:	and then when they  •_•
*JOA:	And you're sitting here going oh choose so and so, you choose him  don't you ? •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah •_•
*VIC:	Yeah   •_•
*FRE:	But, but from the programme producer's point of view, I should think he, he doesn't want too many that are okay, he wants the er •_•
*VIC:	But it would be nice to get   •_•
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	Yeah yeah, yeah. •_•
*JOA:	I mean just lately they seem to  they really slang each other don't they? •_•
*FRE:	Mm, mm. •_•
*VIC:	I er, was it last week erm, yeah it must have been where the  the coloured lad  •_•
*JOA:	Yes. •_•
*VIC:	cos he was back last night wasn't he? •_•
        Two white lads and a coloured one and er it was a white girl and I often wonder if that's a good idea  er whether they should all be the same colour. •_•
*JOA:	Oh I think so because it must be an awful shock  for the girl to  go round the screen and they're faced with a coloured  although they don't bother so much these days do they? •_•
*VIC:	No. •_•
        She said he wasn't ugly enough didn't she? •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	But a few  well I was gonna say a few weeks ago, it might be longer than that, there was that very  large coloured girl that was on •_•
*FRE:	That's a few years ago, never mind a few months. •_•
*JOA:	No er  there was one  not so very  I'm sure not so not, not years ago but it was  •_•
*FRE:	do you there was one  very bonny lass and she was on the er, they, they had erm  composite programme the other  the other week and she was on that again. •_•
*JOA:	Oh is that where I saw her? •_•
*FRE:	Maybe. •_•
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*JOA:	I mean fancy being erm confronted with somebody like  like that. •_•
*FRE:	And in and actually in that programme it was a Nottingham fella who er  was confronted with her   •_•
*JOA:	Was it? •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
        So, yeah, she's a real extrovert. •_•
*JOA:	And then there's that er one who was a  •_•
*VIC:	That was a little while ago, that was big  •_•
*JOA:	she was big but she wasn't coloured was she? •_•
*VIC:	No, but she ran a pub or something  •_•
*JOA:	So she was . •_•
        Somewhere, yes. •_•
*VIC:	managed a pub and she was all  all over. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	But one, one of the coloured chaps where Tasha works said he was  he'd been to one of these Blind Dates, he was on but we haven't come across him yet have we? •_•
*VIC:	But he only said that a little while ago didn't he? •_•
        So if there's a three month •_•
*JOA:	Yes, he might be •_•
*VIC:	gap. •_•
*FRE:	Actually erm  Barbara took, went with her niece to, for the audition and er what I'm not sure of,and  Barbara got on and her niece didn't, what I'm not sure is whether, when she went down, she was thinking that, of sort of er an audition for herself or whether they approached her because apparently they, they don't get too many of the senior people. •_•
*JOA:	Oh. •_•
        No it's, it's not often really that you get a  senior •_•
*FRE:	In fact Barbara was saying to me er why don't you  er but it's not the thing that I'd want to do. •_•
*VIC:	Nice to have them now and again. •_•
        Mm   •_•
*JOA:	Did you see erm Wendy? •_•
*VIC:	No she, I think she was coming in and out cos the car door was open. •_•
*JOA:	So you don't know what time Heidi's  •_•
*VIC:	Half past four. •_•
*JOA:	Half past four. •_•
        Oh she's  •_•
*VIC:	And erm  •_•
*JOA:	late this week is she? •_•
*VIC:	Well she was only early  was it last week or the week before? •_•
        Whenever she was early because there was a christening erm on and they were using the hall afterwards. •_•
        And you know the door they go in •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*VIC:	to er  that little side door? •_•
        Well there were all blue and white balloons hanging up in the hall and by the door just these rows and rows of blue balloons and the door opens outwards •_•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*VIC:	and Wendy was saying how was she going to get the door open without all these balloons •_•
*JOA:	Going. •_•
*VIC:	coming out, yeah. •_•
*JOA:	So no doubt it was a boy  that was being christened. •_•
*VIC:	I would think so, blue, yeah. •_•
        So they decided that once the  christening party was in the hall which was gonna be three o'clock, they didn't stand much chance of erm •_•
*JOA:	Doing anything. •_•
*VIC:	No, so that's why they had it two till three that  day. •_•
        But it's now back to half past two till half past four and whoever's playing the dame arrived just in front of us •_•
*JOA:	Oh. •_•
*VIC:	so he's there. •_•
        Tt what did Malcolm say? •_•
        It was five  five weeks, four weeks on Friday till half term? •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*VIC:	Four weeks on Friday, that's all she's got to    •_•
*JOA:	Yeah  •_•
*VIC:	sort it out. •_•
*JOA:	Oh if I go into town  perhaps Tuesday  to get her tape  try to get her tape •_•
*VIC:	Well she said it's in H V M. •_•
*JOA:	erm  I'll perhaps give  , what are they called? •_•
        Windblowers a ring and see if they've got •_•
*VIC:	For the music. •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
        I could  actually tomorrow to see if it's in the library couldn't I? •_•
*VIC:	Mm and then just photocopy it. •_•
*JOA:	Oh you're not allowed to are you? •_•
*VIC:	Well they won't know will they? •_•
*JOA:	Oh well  yeah I'd have to bring it home to have it done. •_•
        Breaking the law, isn't it? •_•
*VIC:	Well I think it's only if you  want to do er  you know like  doing it for some, something or other isn't it? •_•
*JOA:	No when  used to get music for the Women's Own choir to do for Mothering Sunday, she used to say keep quiet where you got the copy from. •_•
*VIC:	Mm, I think it's when you want a lot. •_•
*JOA:	Or say if you've got a   ten or eleven running off. •_•
        Anyway I'll go in and steal it. •_•
        We walked past that place didn't we? •_•
*VIC:	H V M? •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*VIC:	We were on our way down to   but we weren't actually sure •_•
*JOA:	What it was called. •_•
*VIC:	Mm, so it wouldn't have been any good going in. •_•
*JOA:	Although you'd of probably recognized it. •_•
*VIC:	Well I said I thought it was called Seriously Orchestral. •_•
*JOA:	Well that's what it is isn't it? •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
        Were you buying this erm newspaper last week by any chance? •_•
*JOA:	Oh! •_•
*FRE:	Why? •_•
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	Get to France for a pound. •_•
*FRE:	Oh yes I saw it on the er box, mm. •_•
*JOA:	She's keeping, keep the coupons for Malcolm to send off haven't you? •_•
*VIC:	You collect er well all you've really gotta do is buy the paper Monday to Friday  collect four coupons •_•
*JOA:	Is that empty? •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
*JOA:	better move it. •_•
*VIC:	Collect four coupons and each  set of coupons allows you to claim up to four tickets and  it was a pound a ticket wasn't it? •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*VIC:	A pound a ticket, and you could go, there were three routes you could go  and any time up to March the twenty eighth •_•
*FRE:	Oh. •_•
*VIC:	and that was your fare from, you could go, Dover to  Calais •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*VIC:	Newhaven to Dieppe or  •_•
*JOA:	Dunno what the other one was. •_•
*VIC:	way down, was it Southampton somewhere?and that was your  ferry fare over for the day. •_•
        So erm we thought we might go for a day didn't we? •_•
*JOA:	Might do yes, the end of March. •_•
        He'd, I think he would have liked to have gone the four hour trip  over   I didn't think you'd like that. •_•
*VIC:	Well that one was the most restrictive because that you had to go, you could go any time between  was it eight and eleven in the morning, but you could only come back either something like  quarter to five, quarter to, no quarter to six was it? •_•
        Or quarter to two in the morning, there were only two you could come back on. •_•
        Whereas  the Dover to Calais you can go any time between this time and that time and come back any time between this time and  that time. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
        Yeah. •_•
*VIC:	But going to  Dieppe it docks on the quay or whatever is sort of right in the heart of erm the town so once you are off the ferry, you're there. •_•
        Well I suppose it depends what you  want to go for. •_•
*JOA:	Well he, he was asking me which I'd prefer and I said  I think you ought to consider Vicki not me  on the crossing. •_•
*VIC:	Well if you go  if you stay till quarter to one in the morning how can you be sure there's gonna be anything open to  •_•
*JOA:	To do. •_•
        Well that's it. •_•
*VIC:	to do. •_•
        So therefore if you come back  •_•
*JOA:	Paris nightclub. •_•
*VIC:	if you could come back before  •_•
*JOA:	Stripping club. •_•
*VIC:	if you come back on the one before you've only got about three and a half hours so you've got four hours on the ferry, three and a half there and then four hours back again haven't you? •_•
        Anyway we'll see what   •_•
*JOA:	Well Vicki's not very keen on crossing the water are you? •_•
*VIC:	No. •_•
*JOA:	So I thought the shorter journey would be  better. •_•
*VIC:	And if we don't go we've only lost a pound ticket. •_•
        So we'll see. •_•
*JOA:	snow  that day. •_•
*VIC:	Well I think they're going to repeat the offer aren't they? •_•
        They're supposed to be doing it again. •_•
*JOA:	Well we, at the erm school play we were talking to, who did you say, Mr ? •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
*JOA:	And he was telling, you know erm  it was the er Christmas thing, he was saying he'd been to France on a cheap ticket hadn't he? •_•
*VIC:	Through the Daily oh Express. •_•
*JOA:	The Express wasn't it? •_•
        Or The Mail? •_•
*VIC:	Daily Express. •_•
*JOA:	It was one of the better papers. •_•
        I mean The Sun is absolutely    I mean    I did have a go at reading the first one and I thought well I can't read this trash any longer, think I read two pages. •_•
*VIC:	Yes what did he, how much did it cost him? •_•
        Fifteen pounds did he say? •_•
*JOA:	they had, they went for  the weekend didn't they? •_•
        not for the, I don't think they went for the day. •_•
*VIC:	Think it was. •_•
*JOA:	Was it? •_•
*VIC:	Thought he said it was a day. •_•
        But they, they sailed sort of first thing in the morning and didn't come back till last thing at •_•
*JOA:	Night. •_•
*VIC:	night. •_•
        Thought it was only a day, and they were talking to somebody else on the ferry who said they did this trip every year didn't they? •_•
        And what good value it was, it was only costing them   hundred and  •_•
*JOA:	Well I really can't remember the figures. •_•
*VIC:	oh I thought he said a hundred and something pounds didn't he? •_•
*JOA:	Mm. •_•
*VIC:	And it had cost them about fifteen or something. •_•
        Mr  said he didn't have the heart to tell them how, you might think it's good value but he didn't when he'd only paid fifteen pounds fifty a ticket. •_•
        Have you got any more ideas for holidays or? •_•
*FRE:	Not erm I've sort of got several things that I'd like to do  •_•
*VIC:	In your mind that you'd like to do. •_•
*FRE:	I'm ever so disappointed that I've not been to Yugoslavia, I wanted to go to Dubrovnik, you know, it's been on the sort of list but I've never got round to it. •_•
*JOA:	It's a bit late now till things are sorted out. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah I'm afraid afraid so, and of course it's been damaged anyway now. •_•
        Egypt  er  is on my list. •_•
*VIC:	Oh up the Nile? •_•
*FRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JOA:	Mind you don't get in with the Carry On crew. •_•
*FRE:	Erm  yes there er, there are  I was talking to er  tt do you know June ? •_•
        She's  she's about my age I should think and she sometimes, once a month she does the coffee  wears glasses •_•
*JOA:	I'd perhaps recognize, yes tell by  •_•
*FRE:	anyway erm I was talking to her on the bus not too long ago and, I don't know how it came up but she was talking about Egypt, and er she'd been apparently oh some  a year or two back cos she did a, an evening course on Egyptology and she went through that, but she was telling me about a friend or friends of hers who'd been er and told me about the trip. •_•
        Erm then she put, he had done a newsletter to his friends which is beautifully done er and had sent her one and so she put it through my door so it was quite interesting. •_•
        On that holiday they er  they'd also been to Cairo as well as, and I mean some of the erm  trips erm are  they go to Luxor and you board a erm er the ship from Luxor to Aswan  and you don't get to Cairo and I think if you're going to Egypt you really want to go to Cairo  •_•
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*VIC:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	as well as. •_•
*JOA:	Oh yes, certainly. •_•
*FRE:	Er you know I, I, it's, it's on my list. •_•
*JOA:	It's mulling around up there. •_•
*FRE:	Now if you want to know what I'd like, which holiday I'd like and I probably will never do it, mind you I I need the person to go with because definitely you need a person to go with, I'd love to go on the Orient Express. •_•
*VIC:	You know I was I thought oh I wonder if it'll be the Orient Express, yeah. •_•
        Mm on the train. •_•
*FRE:	But er yeah  erm  but you er but it's so expensive  erm to do it properly •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
*FRE:	er to go right the way through to Venice and you've got to stay at Venice for at least a couple of days so oh and it, er, I think er, you're talking about two thousand at least just for that four days, you know? •_•
*VIC:	Mm. •_•
*FRE:	So  •_•
*JOA:	do that when we go, we shan't go that way to Venice when we go shall we? •_•
*FRE:	So it's the sort of thing where if somebody said to me right •_•
*VIC:	You can have whatever holiday you like •_•
*FRE:	No, no, no, no  you could only do that, I want you to go on the Orient Express, yes. •_•
        If they said you can go anywhere you like it would, that would cause  I would, I would  have difficulty deciding. •_•
*VIC:	Be debating which yeah. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah I've got another trip which I saw on telly, again which I shall never do I think, er which sounded pretty good, you flew, flew to er  •_•
*VIC:	Oh pardon me. •_•
*FRE:	Calgary, took a train over the Rockies to Vancouver and then a cruise ship up to Alaska and, and back via Vancouver and you saw the erm ice floes er dropping off and er er seals and that, dolphins and that and it looked pretty good. •_•
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	But then you flew back from Calgary I think  or it may have been Vancouver. •_•
        Now that was er  •_•
*VIC:	That looked worthwhile. •_•
*FRE:	That was about fifteen hundred two or three years ago so that'll be two thousand at least. •_•
*VIC:	A lot of money when you think it's just for, a holiday's just for, you know, short times. •_•
*FRE:	Yeah, yeah. •_•
        Yes I mean er when I er you know when I was on the Q E Two and was chatting with a fella  and er  he, they'd been, he'd obviously been cruising before and was on this cruise and er they were going on the er another Cunard ship a few months later, and it turned out that he was a hotelier who'd bought a hotel in Swanage some years ago, I think he'd had about seven bedrooms when he bought it and he gradually extended it, I forget how many he did tell me, and then he had a bit of a heart er  attack and er his doctor told him to, you know, well if I were you I'd just pack in your job which he did and that was about fifteen years ago he was  I dunno if he was eighty or he was approaching eighty if he wasn't and was in pretty good form, he was dancing, and er, you know, I mean there money's no object. •_•
        Er the er the lady  he was a widower and his, er his er he was with a lady who was a widow and erm I know for a fact that she'd not spent a penny, she hadn't you know for you know, of the trip or, or   he just wouldn't let her, I mean, I mean you, you've got to have some money haven't you to to keep  •_•
*JOA:	 (        ) 
*FRE:	to keep going like that? •_•
*VIC:	Hmm. •_•
        Well I'll have to keep doing these pools. •_•
*JOA:	That's right. •_•
        Well I keep sending these coupons off that come through the door •_•
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JOA:	entering competitions but  I don't get anything . •_•
