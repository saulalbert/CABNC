*PS1BT:	Right Now you said you were gon na tell me what 's happened on the news so far .  1422303_1425593
*PS1BV:	Three people have er been killed in a railway accident after their their car ran into the side of a train .  1426273_1435603
*PS1BT:	Oh dear .  1435863_1436323
*PS1BV:	Wh which is about er which is about er open er the day after tomorrow .  1436613_1446013
*PS1BT:	What 's open the day after tomorrow .  1448363_1449953
*PS1BV:	The level crossing .  1450143_1450883
*PS1BT:	Oh it 's closed now is it .  1451503_1452773
*PS1BV:	No they 're going to open it It 's new .  1454683_1457803
*PS1BT:	Aha What else has been happening .  1458233_1461273
*PS1BV:	And dad .  1461623_1462813
*PS1BT:	Yes .  1462813_1462983
*PS1BV:	You know that many level crossings are one barrier .  1462983_1465193
*PS1BT:	Yes .  1465733_1466043
*PS1BV:	Well that they showed us er a thing about the speed about about the traffic approaching lights when they 're starting flashing It showed you a car go over that going over tha a lorry going over crossing and the lights were starting to flash .  1468763_1489963
*PS1BT:	Well a lot of people do that It 's very dangerous .  1490473_1492683
*PS1BV:	But I was supposed to stop .  1492703_1494143
*PS1BT:	They ha as soon as the lights flash supposed to stop Be .  1494223_1496833
*PS1BV:	What the running of the railway line .  1496833_1498203
*PS1BT:	No they 're supposed to stop before the lights Silly .  1498633_1501163
*PS1BV:	Yeah .  1501813_1501923
*PS1BT:	Because on a lot of those the train .  1502343_1504703
*PS1BV:	Yes .  1505523_1505673
*PS1BT:	activates the lights as it 's approaching the crossing .  1506703_1510303
*PS1BV:	Yes cos most o most of that one barrier it said on the news that they 're o automatic .  1510833_1515953
*PS1BT:	That 's right So .  1517273_1519003
*PS1BV:	They have er special cameras which they take the line of the trains both sides .  1519003_1524393
*PS1BT:	Mhm And the barriers drop so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers the chances are the train 's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you So it 's a very silly thing to do .  1525083_1539303
*PS1BV:	Yes Like if it 's one metre away and there 's a car going across .  1539303_1546683
*PS1BT:	Well if you were that close and the lights started you 'd probably get across But if you like you know what it 's like when we come .  1546683_1553663
*PS1BV:	If if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway er th ah there 's only way you can escape Go round by the barrier pole .  1553663_1566113
*PS1BT:	Well yes but look at the crossings we 've got in Driffield .  1567363_1569593
*PS1BV:	Yes The barriers .  1570173_1571543

*PS1BV:	Full barriers Double are safe .  1573593_1575903
*PS1BT:	Well they 're different because they have them they 're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they 're .  1576713_1582363
*PS1BV:	Yes they are controlled .  1582363_1582943
*PS1BT:	controlled by a television Er .  1582943_1584743

*PS1BT:	That 's right .  1617943_1618853
*PS1BV:	And they 're trying to take away as many er possible erm mainly one barrier er railway gates as possible .  1618853_1625673
*PS1BT:	Well I did n't know they were trying to get rid of those .  1627673_1629353
*PS1BV:	Especially on busy main roads .  1629353_1630373
*PS1BT:	But some of the crossings around this area did n't have any barriers at all .  1630933_1634793
