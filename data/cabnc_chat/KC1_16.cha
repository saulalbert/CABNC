        Dad I want to screw it. •150399_150715•
*FRA:	Yeah, I've just gotta get this bottom one out. •150742_151091•
        Can you give it a tap underneath there? •151116_151371•
*JON:	Oh yeah. •151410_151478•
*FRA:	That piece. •151506_151534•
*JON:	 (        )  (.)  ((banging))
*FRA:	That's it   tap it up about here a minute. •151553_151987•
        See this piece goes up? •152039_152167•
*JON:	Yeah. •152167_152176•
*FRA:	Right, and give it a bash that way now. •152402_152775•
*JON:	But the screw on the top  cos I can only screw  •152775_153306•
*FRA:	 (        )  (.) 
*JON:	Mum, look what I had to do. •153350_153820•
*LYN:	Oh   •153873_153886•
*JON:	 (        )  (.)  ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Mm •153948_153954•
*LYN:	 (        )  (.)  ((banging))
*JON:	I'm just seeing if I can get these two shelves out. •153990_154406•
*LYN:	Well you give it a good bash then. •154444_154679•
*JON:	Look I'm turning it that way. •154722_155162•
*LYN:	That would be  •155203_155270•
*FRA:	Yeah     •155378_155397•
*LYN:	the ceiling  •155745_156141•
*FRA:	I don't think it's fixed to the ceiling actually that, I think it's just purely a  a framework  •156180_157395•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	nailed to the wall   •157502_157870•
*JON:	It's only a piece of wood that's  do you know what that is? •158850_159577•
        That's only  •159577_159743•
*LYN:	So you could take the framework off the front •159799_161282•
*FRA:	Yeah I think that's just  •161293_161429•
*LYN:	which leaves the superstructure on   •161429_161579•
*FRA:	Yeah  Screwdriver's   •161790_161848•
*JON:	Now that must be wobbly. •162008_162194•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*LYN:	 (        )  (.) 
*JON:	That won't come off. •162204_162278•
        Well these shelves won't come off. •162288_162444•
*GRO:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Should happen   now it's got bended. •162462_162861•
*FRA:	Well   •162861_162877•
*JON:	Mum do you like the sound? •162989_163108•
*LYN:	No  •163108_163152•
*JON:	Then  cover up the ears. •163152_163422•
        it's okay now. •163655_163691•
*FRA:	It always amazes me  build things like that  •163691_163904•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*FRA:	Yeah. •163922_163929•
*LYN:	So how does that come off the wall, the wooden ? •163929_164074•
*FRA:	It's held on , it's gonna take some doing actually. •164131_164455•
*LYN:	What the wooden part? •164538_164950•
*FRA:	Those slats, this back piece •164962_165098•
*LYN:	Yeah •165105_165117•
*FRA:	are nailed to the wall  •165117_165223•
*JON:	Yeah and that's only wall  •165264_165467•
*LYN:	Well, well I was just maybe wondering whether you might use a part of that to support the new cabinet   •165576_166485•
*JON:	Do you know that's only wall  that bit is only wall. •166662_167622•
*FRA:	Ten to one it won't match. •167624_167789•
*LYN:	too terrible to get off. •167789_168084•
*JON:	Listen listen please  •168084_168251•
*FRA:	Oh it's, you know   •168257_168339•
*JON:	That's only wall  •168733_169000•
*LYN:	Only wall? •169029_169213•
*JON:	Yeah, it's only   •169226_169297•
*LYN:	Right  do for that cos  might  •169375_169805•
*FRA:	I don't whether, I'm trying to think if he goes •170032_170743•
*LYN:	I don't know, I can't keep up with him but I expect   I think  •170788_171589•
*JON:	 ((laugh)) 
*LYN:	Don't fall, you're hardly on the stool Jon. •171845_173413•
        Erm  •173423_173432•
*JON:	Ah! •173487_173507•

*FRA:	Mm. •174449_174458•
*JON:	But you look there  that's wall  •174458_174764•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	those bits should come out. •174778_174865•
*FRA:	Oh don't knock this though cos  •174865_175108•
*LYN:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Why? •175267_175294•
*FRA:	 (        ) 
*JON:	Because look  •175294_175380•

*LYN:	Do you realize that? •176523_176677•
        You can have , you can take them  •177062_177613•
*FRA:	 (        )
