*JEA:	Not there  no, no  no. •_•
*BRE:	I mean that's a bit daft really! •_•
*JEA:	You know who it is that wants to make money on that? •_•
        That's that dreadful man,! •_•
        Councillor   he's had his greedy little eyes on that area for years. •_•

*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	I mean it might be  whatever year •_•
*JEA:	Well I went to a  a big meeting round about nineteen eighty five •_•
*BRE:	Yeah I remember you said  •_•
*JEA:	and they he wanted  to  where Marge  lived  remember The Grove  •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	They wanted to •_•
*BRE:	That whole bit? •_•
*JEA:	raise that and have that developed as a road, the other one, would  be closed •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	and developed   would be  destroyed  and another,another big road put in it's place and  he they they were after Horsell Moor  which is where they're going to put the Tesco's. •_•
*BRE:	Mm. •_•
*JEA:	That area's called Horsell Moor •_•
*BRE:	I don't think they made it  •_•
*JEA:	I bet  •_•
*BRE:	though, do you? •_•
*JEA:	Well I hope not! •_•
*BRE:	We do need one. •_•
*JEA:	Yes, we do we do need another store in Woking of that kind. •_•
*BRE:	But they're are not  •_•
*JEA:	Not there! •_•
*BRE:	how long has Anthony  been there, twenty  •_•
*JEA:	Ah  •_•
*BRE:	thirty years? •_•
*JEA:	Thirty years, easily, I mean it , it was already established when we arrived in nineteen fifty nine. •_•
*BRE:	But Dave said Tesco's can't do, what they did they did it at Weybridge, they said let us buy your sight  you say where you wanna sight and then they and we will build what you  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	want on that sight  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	for you. •_•
*JEA:	Mm, mm  yes. •_•
*BRE:	But as John still got a lot of work on, and Mary Ann? •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	Is it getting ? •_•
*JEA:	No, but Mary Ann's a  •_•
*BRE:	 (        ) 
*JEA:	public servant and they're  pretty well protected  erm John's firm is simply doing extremely well in spite of the recession. •_•
*BRE:	Yes right. •_•
*JEA:	I mean they're very pleased with him because he's the front man  having appeared on the Anneka Rice thing and being kissed by Anneka Rice in the full view of millions  I mean John can do no wrong  by by Johnathan   I doubt it. •_•
*BRE:	Did he manage to see get it did he video it? •_•
*JEA:	Yes Mary Ann's done it. •_•
*BRE:	Oh Mary Ann did it, he'll be able to see it. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	What did he think of Anneka Rice? •_•
*JEA:	Oh  you know  she is what she is what she'll be. •_•
*BRE:	Is that's right. •_•
*JEA:	Vital, lively, attractive. •_•
*BRE:	Yes. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	Did you see you with that gas that advert she did with that  poor woman! •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	Yes. •_•
*JEA:	I don't blame the woman for doing as much as possible on television  with in those advertisements because I think that woman  have got only a short  life in those ads because she'd get bored with them . •_•
*BRE:	Wonder why ? •_•
*JEA:	Well she she's  she gets up and does things doesn't she. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah that's what I mean, they say ooh can't stand this woman but I mean, I don't know why. •_•
*JEA:	Jealousy I think. •_•
*BRE:	Probably. •_•
*JEA:	Hell of a lot of  •_•
*BRE:	I mean  •_•
*JEA:	jealousy. •_•
*BRE:	she's got a lot of get and go   •_•
*JEA:	That she has  she has. •_•
*BRE:	this is taping now  so what was erm  Libertys did they have it? •_•
        remind me tomorrow  I must take those  twenty  vouchers •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	to erm  Debs •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	and Jenny was saying she went to  Debenhams yesterday they had a twelve day spectacular at eight thirty to eight thirty at night    there was  clothes they were half price  plus you got a third of ten per cent off. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	But I think all the sales will be off before Christmas. •_•
*JEA:	I  I looked at the fabrics in the Libertys •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	and  if I can't get want I want at the Famlingham Textile Centre which is  excellent  when I next need fabrics I shall come up, I will come up to London and I'll go to Libertys, but I will have measured first of all to within an inch as to what I want because •_•
*BRE:	It is expensive. •_•
*JEA:	Well some of the stuff is eighteen pounds a meter  but if you think of the cost of a  a well fitting jacket for somebody like myself, it's astronomical! •_•
*BRE:	You know what you should have done while you was up there this time  you should have took asked for some samples. •_•
*JEA:	Yes, my dear, I I did not feel well enough just  •_•
*BRE:	No do you think that they will? •_•
*JEA:	I didn't even think about, yes they will, they'll give you a little cutting, I suppose. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah, but not only that, I mean, they will now  all these shops are doing like a mail order •_•
*JEA:	That's interesting. •_•
*BRE:	and they would actually send  and I know why because erm  John Lewis in London  erm  Jackie wanted some fabric  and she'd seen it up there and Harrods  and erm  she found out she didn't have her card with her, just her Barclaycard  said would you post this we we'll have to charge you, like, two pound  •_•
*JEA:	Mm, mm. •_•
*BRE:	fifty packaging, but that's fine she said  •_•
*JEA:	Well yes it's very good. •_•
*BRE:	well I couldn't get up there because she know   •_•
*JEA:	Quite. •_•
*BRE:	park •_•
*JEA:	Quite. •_•
*BRE:	and  she wanted sort of so many meters of each  •_•
*JEA:	Mm  yeah  •_•
*BRE:	and they sent it to her. •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	And I suppose you could treat  •_•
*JEA:	Worth going. •_•
*BRE:	people this year, if they'd done all their Christmas shopping mail order. •_•
*JEA:	Oh yes  yes. •_•
*BRE:	Rather than, sort of go round themselves  I reckon we'll take that with us. •_•
*JEA:	Good idea! •_•
*BRE:	Might want them for a cup of tea . •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	I think we should have got away with a small Coke, shouldn't we? •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	That's nice of them. •_•
*JEA:	It's so big! •_•
*BRE:	We've been  thrilled with this work experience  cos was Dave originally  had these five days off  taping  and he said no, he said, you know you're so tired, have a little rest  we'll go up I'll go up on the train  only to get to the Selhurst Park he's got four or five train journeys   •_•
*JEA:	Yeah  mm •_•
*BRE:	and he has to get, like  Woking to Surbiton  Surbiton to Clapham Junction •_•
*JEA:	Yeah. •_•
*BRE:	Clapham Junction to erm  Thornton Heath  and he has Thornton Heath to Selhurst Park. •_•
*JEA:	Mm  yes. •_•
*BRE:	So it's five trips •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	there's no easier  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	way •_•
*JEA:	No  no  •_•
*BRE:	round it  and like Dave said  it would've cost him, sort of, seven or eight pound a day in petrol •_•
*JEA:	Mm  quite  •_•
*BRE:	and he managed to get a ticket for a week  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	for fifteen  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	pounds. •_•
*JEA:	Yes, yes quite •_•
*BRE:	You know it  •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	but erm I bought   •_•
*JEA:	 ((cough)) 
*BRE:	sort of, quarter past seven he's had to leave in the morning  to get there  and then not getting home to, sort of , seven o'clock  Dave picks up from the station  and I think  •_•
*JEA:	Part of life. •_•
*BRE:	and I, sort of, said to him it's he's enjoyed it, he hasn't, sort of , moaned. •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	He he just moans about the fact of making tea! •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	That just made us laugh because  •_•
*JEA:	Mm  quite •_•
*BRE:	I said to Dave, they've got no idea the youngsters, have they? •_•
        They don't •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	no idea what so ever  because erm  he starts on this  on Monday. •_•
*JEA:	Oh God! •_•
*BRE:	He's got three er  he's got the , two languages  the three sciences, biology, chemistry erm  what's the other one? •_•
        Science. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	there and  the maths . •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	So  but I think with this  I mean this homework, that's the only thing I don't believe in because  they've gotta revise it  which is brilliant, I mean,at the moment  but they also give them three hours homework a night! •_•
*JEA:	They're not thinking what they're doing, are they, they're  •_•
*BRE:	No I can't talk  •_•
*JEA:	overloading  •_•
*BRE:	I mean Jim was saying that Winston  has given them two weeks off so  •_•
*JEA:	Yes  yes. •_•
*BRE:	alright I don't  two weeks is too long I think  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	because obviously like  Kim very soon after revising she's going out. •_•
*JEA:	Yes, yes. •_•
*BRE:	Erm  but, I mean, you know, I think they need to they should say, no homework  for this week, because they've already  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	got a lot •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	just go through  revision •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	you know, two weeks before  •_•
*JEA:	Yes. •_•
*BRE:	or something, no time  •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	off school, •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	but total revision  I mean, the other night he sat in, he came home at four o'clock  and he was up till nine thirty  just doing homework. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	He's hardly got time to revise much cos he's so tired! •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	And erm  he he said it's stupid, he said they were given all this and it's the homework  it's nothing to do  with the revision you've got to do in his the exams! •_•
*JEA:	Yeah, ha  ha ha. •_•
*BRE:	You know, it's sort of, totally different. •_•
*JEA:	Mm. •_•
*BRE:	Are we fit or? •_•
*JEA:	Just about. •_•
*BRE:	Do you want or would like  •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	another cigarette? •_•
*JEA:	You have another cigarette  yeah. •_•
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*JEA:	I'm shattered! •_•
*BRE:	You'll be alright, when you get  •_•
*JEA:	I'll be fine once  once I've had another  five minutes. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah. •_•
*JEA:	Ooh! •_•
*BRE:	Well you'll sleep well now  always do. •_•
*JEA:	Yeah . •_•
*BRE:	Did you still put stilton cheese in that roll or  did you want that? •_•
*JEA:	No. •_•
*BRE:	Oh! •_•
        Is that  it all or  or did you try it? •_•
*JEA:	I Haven't needed try, Brenda, I can't I mean at one time I'd have devoured that. •_•
*BRE:	Yeah and me look how much I've eaten. •_•
*JEA:	No, no I can't I just can't eat  so I'm not forcing myself to eat, what I'm trying to do is only to eat the right things  and I must start vitamin supplements  I think I've got the age when I probably  need that, I mean, this cold  is a warning to me that my immune system is not as strong as it ought to be, I shouldn't have had another cold  so soon after getting rid of one! •_•
*BRE:	Crikey, cos the last time you were down you had that stinker didn't you? •_•
*JEA:	Yes yes  and this one isn't as bad, but  I shouldn't be having this one at all! •_•
*BRE:	At all, no  you need either a multi-vitamin or vitamin c. •_•
*JEA:	Probably a bit of both. •_•
*BRE:	Do you not take any  any at all? •_•
*JEA:	No, no I don't  the time has come I think! •_•
        Ah but tell me  what happened about your  fracas with Peter? •_•
*BRE:	Oh yeah, well I won't tape. •_•
