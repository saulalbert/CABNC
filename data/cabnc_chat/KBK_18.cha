        His initial is W. •677222_678392•
*CHR:	Yes, yes, he is William, erm,there are sixteen of the item outstanding on this order, eight required on this order and he says they haven't quite tested eight yet. •679732_692122•
        Some of the have passed test but they haven't quite got to eight yet, so erm. •693072_697312•

*CHR:	Yes, yes, erm, he said they may well have done sufficient of them by Monday. •699952_705892•
*LYN:	But it sounds as though everything . •705932_708852•
*CHR:	He said the rest of it's on schedule. •709262_710652•
*LYN:	Ah right . •711572_711832•
*CHR:	Yes , his looked at it in the last couple of days, so he said within within another week or so he's having the whole done  with them. •711832_719802•
*LYN:	Good. •719982_720092•
*CHR:	Goody goody goody woof woof woof  I can see exactly what this guy's means  about eh, huh, anything, anything in laboratories because the, the range of stuff in these magazines is phenomenal. •720092_740072•
*LYN:	Yeah. •741922_742092•
*CHR:	Absolutely incredible. •742092_743582•
