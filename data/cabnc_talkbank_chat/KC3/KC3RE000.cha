*PS0AA:	Well I suppose it 's erm .  115455_130375
*PS0A8:	Sounds quite an interesting .  132025_133305
*PS0AA:	an interesting idea .  134765_139375
*PS0A8:	Yeah I thought so .  140055_142645
*PS0AA:	I 'm not convinced that we can establish exactly what we 're after erm the sort of conversation or communication .  144725_168625
*PS0A8:	What .  168675_168765
*PS0AA:	that people use .  168765_169855
*PS0A8:	Yeah it seems to me that erm they are it 's er going to be a comparative thing from nineteen ninety two and then in we 'll say nineteen ninety seven for argument 's sake .  170265_189125
*PS0AA:	The trouble is .  192505_193135
*PS0A8:	Or or or gradually er on .  193135_195035
*PS0AA:	increasingly I think nowadays people converse in not a foreign language because the terms that people use are familiar but meanings that they intend are not and th th th the computer people are the worst because they use ordinary words which mean completely different things in the .  198235_248125
*PS0A8:	Than .  250105_250365
*PS0AA:	context of o o of people just .  250365_251925
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  252925_253185
*PS0AA:	talking .  253285_253585
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  253795_254565
*PS0AA:	and there they they talk about a database which is a it 's not an English word .  254565_266285
*PS0A8:	No a computer .  266475_267545
*PS0AA:	so what on earth does it mean .  267645_269275
*PS0A8:	Mm .  269765_270005
*PS0AA:	Well I used the word to mo er in a report I was writing years ago it was ten years ago and I knew what I meant but I had n't sat down and defined what I meant perhaps I should have done .  270645_291535
*PS0A8:	Mm .  292195_292515
*PS0AA:	Since then a program 's been written called Database One which means something completely different which has been updated to Database Two and Three and may be Four which mean different things that 's why they 've got different numbers they do more clever things and nowadays you talk you hear people talking about databases and they all mean different things They usually mean a file of information which is processed by different completely different .  293395_343475
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	computer systems One as it were to pick out addresses one to pick out socio-economic groups one to pick out motor cars one to pick out number of bedrooms one to pick out whatever and trivially or or superficially everyone says the same thing a database it 's on the database now .  344225_368375
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  368585_368995
*PS0AA:	the file is there that 's a computer term or exactly that a l a a listing of names addresses and houses and cars and everything else and a file is a defined computer term what you do with it is the next thing .  369365_391125
*PS0A8:	Mm .  391485_391615
*PS0AA:	and the way in which you do what you do with it depends on what you put in If you only put people in who are owner-occupiers then you will not have all the information all the people who are in rented accommodation .  392185_413115
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  413465_414405
*PS0AA:	If you only put in people who live in houses you 'll not have all the people who live in maisonettes and flats .  414615_420835
*PS0A8:	Mm yeah .  421025_421825
*PS0AA:	If you are not eligible to be put in if you do n't have a motor car then you 're discounting an enormous number of people who may have motorcycles or motor caravans or you know something which is perfectly valid but it invalidates the information that you think you are getting out of the file because you only put in certain perfectly reasonable groups of er of things and i in in in Boots there 's a there 's a er there 's a a wonderful expression or actually is is the one I 'm particularly thinking about you know we we sell shall we say a million bottles of aspirin a year it is in fact considerably more than that and that is perfectly reasonable and valid and mm but in the definition of that we obviously only included what Boots the Chemists sold because that 's all the people who . 
*PS0A8:	Yeah that 's .  502155_502965
*PS0AA:	sold bottles .  502965_503215
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  503215_503715
*PS0AA:	of aspirin .  504085_504635
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  504635_504695
*PS0AA:	made by Boots But now of course there 's Crooks and that means not bottles of aspirins bad example but Strepsils the lozenges for example are now sold in an enormous range of private pharmacies which are not Boots and they are therefore completely outside the term output it may be a restricted term it may not be the one we want but that is what it was meant and that is what the number is generated from Now of course er we 've sold the er chain of chemists in Canada who might have sold bottles of aspirin but before we sold the chain there was another enormous quantity of bottles of aspirin which was n't defined it was something which was introduced after long after we defined what we meant by outputs of aspirin And the rate of change of of of society no the background to what we 're doing shifts the goalposts is the fashionable term but what you thought you meant you no longer mean and of course if one is meticulously methodical one adjusts the definition as the circumstances change .  504755_597915
*PS0A8:	Yes yeah .  597915_599125
*PS0AA:	we do n't do that .  599235_600135
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  600335_600515
*PS0AA:	Not with a thing like a outputs of aspirin I mean everyone in Boots knows what the outputs of aspirin are just strange that they are in fact three times what we 'd thought they were and we 've course there 's Crooks course there 's this course there 's that tremendous discernment tremendous understanding but if you have n't got that tremendous understanding you 've just joined the company you think you know something and you do n't because not what they think they are .  600765_631415
*PS0A8:	Mm mm .  631815_631915
*PS0AA:	and er .  632485_633315
*PS0A8:	Anyway how are you .  633505_637765
*PS0AA:	I I 'm not too bad I feel that er it 's been a a slightly peculiar month really Sort of when we went to see Jan 's mother for Christmas I was saying to myself yeah mm this time last year I was on holiday from work .  637765_674185
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  674245_674365
*PS0AA:	now I am retired and er yes last year I was feeling a bit decrepit you know I used to go for a full wal walk round after lunch after dinner around where she lives and it 's much harder now .  674365_694245
*PS0A8:	Mm how long is it since you knocked off work sick .  695595_698175
*PS0AA:	Well I got flu in February last year .  698235_703935
*PS0A8:	February ninety one .  704255_706835
*PS0AA:	Yeah .  706835_707185
*PS0A8:	S so ah .  707185_709285
*PS0AA:	And I never went back .  709775_711415
*PS0A8:	Yeah But you were presumably feeling not well before then Yeah .  711715_716495
*PS0AA:	Well you you you you you know the you know the the scenario that everything goes wrong you know everything goes wrong you know from time to time and you say to yourself oh it 'll get better .  716495_731835
*PS0A8:	Mm .  732015_732155
*PS0AA:	it gets better and you say ooh I 'm tired .  732225_735655
*PS0A8:	Yes that 's right .  735665_737725
*PS0AA:	oh I 've had a bit of a day or erm ooh whatever it is and erm I said to myself I am making allowances for being tired and getting getting on a bit you know and that went on for quite a while actually until I said to myself I 'm making up allowances you know I 'm .  737735_769595
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  769595_769885
*PS0AA:	there is something seriously seriously queer you know maybe it 's a brain tumour you know maybe it 's er I 'm going potty maybe it 's all sorts of things and fortunately I er I s I went to the vet and erm two weeks before he retired but you know he he was full of experience that 's really what I 'm saying he would n't be retiring otherwise .  770655_796425
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  796555_797115
*PS0AA:	and er he said to himself there 's something I I I do n't know what it is necessarily but there is something go to a specialist and the specialist was very very good you know blah blah blah blah you want some te I want some tests you know so I had some tests you know and the crew that were doing the tests they knew what they were looking for and they either found it or they did n't do n't know But in due course er when I was still off with flu erm back to the specialist another test you know and that was er March April of last year and the result of it was that there is something in there which is characteristic of what 's what we call multiple sclerosis which seems to me is about as broad as it 's long you know it 's it 's a very large .  797215_862795
*PS0A8:	Yes i i i it 's one of those erm illnesses that erm the average person knows of it and and knows just a little bit but does n't know very much .  862795_876815
*PS0AA:	Well an an an and I it seems to me that the the er I mean you go you go to the er to the M S Society and you find just about everybody there you know you find people who who are in wheelchairs you find people who are walking around you find people who are er controlling their diet you find people who are obs s taking extreme dietary precautions no not precautions no they are taking extreme care of their diet er er I mean on gluten-free diets and you know what that means .  877315_920325
*PS0A8:	Mm .  921845_921985
*PS0AA:	you ca n't have anything which has any .  922065_923695
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  923695_923795
*PS0AA:	wheat or barley or anything connected and you find other people who are walking around relatively independently and you find people who are walking around slowly .  923895_940255
*PS0A8:	Mm .  940685_941045
*PS0AA:	and you find erm people like Lynn you know bless her who now who is n't too bad when she 's not too bad and is n't too good when she 's not too good you know and it is such a very very Not only can you not put anything visibly in in common with everyone that 's got it even the people that have got it ca n't say I can not do this period they say oh well I 'm not too good now but maybe last week or maybe next week .  943075_981250
*PS0A8:	Yeah yeah .  981250_982840
*PS0AA:	So it 's erm it 's all a bit peculiar You now have to get in er er because there was a sort of erm gradation from being off ill which was n't familiar to being off long term sick which you ca n't have any experience of to erm early retirement on health grounds and you just ca n't have any experience of that either erm to being retired and it 's i i it 's it 's quite interesting .  982920_1019670
*PS0A8:	Mm .  1021210_1021400
*PS0AA:	going from one to the other in a year .  1021400_1024530
*PS0A8:	Yeah I thought it was longer than that you know .  1024530_1027620
*PS0AA:	Well erm the er th th th the first and most horrific incidence was I think in the May no no no it was n't May it was when we went down to s to Cats in London which was at the end of eighty nine beginning of ninety and I went to I went to the the doctor in June of nineteen ninety and odd things were sort of going through nineteen ninety but it was n't until nineteen ninety one and I was off ill and it all went .  1027620_1100630
*PS0A8:	Mm .  1103970_1104060
*PS0AA:	so it 's it 's all part of er life 's rich tapestry .  1104130_1109560
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	and erm .  1109700_1110440
*PS0A8:	Yeah And is Janet has Janet been able to go back to work yet Er obviously she 's not fit at the moment .  1110440_1118450
*PS0AA:	Well .  1118450_1118530
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	she 's been back .  1118530_1120670
*PS0A8:	She has Yeah .  1120720_1121510
*PS0AA:	and erm in fact she was back all the all the all the summer .  1121510_1126600
*PS0A8:	No I meant fairly recently .  1126650_1129090
*PS0AA:	No .  1130240_1130540
*PS0A8:	is it since she er was not well mm .  1130540_1133430
*PS0AA:	Erm we had gone down to to to Bognor to the christening of her our nephew and she was n't too th that was in November it was sort of middle of November and something was going wrong there and so when I when I was retiring on the twenty seventh of November she could n't come in and er .  1133430_1169160
*PS0A8:	Was that to Boots D . 
*PS0AA:	0 . 
*PS0A8:	yeah yeah .  1174820_1175610
*PS0AA:	month of December was sort of off and trying to do odd things and then she went down with this this flu er which was progressively worse since the new year So you know what these girls are they sort of I personally you know as it were a trained scientist a certified chemist who you tend to to take a a slightly er diagnostic view of things but that 's not quite right but you take a slightly objective view of things and I I I I 've been thinking to myself ah it is rotten unfair on girls because sometimes sort of between about fifteen and twenty five but now I suppose because they 're all growing up so much earlier it 's between ten and twenty they have a pretty monumental change they and and it 's not a bundle of laughs but they can talk to their friends they can see their friends and talk to their mothers they can get a vague way it 's gon na affect them and they can you know sort of let's say twenty twenty five settle into a routine which has variations every during the four weeks and they vary between individuals I mean it 's well known .  1175900_1299040
*PS0A8:	Yeah that 's right .  1299050_1299870
*PS0AA:	you know that s some do n't really have a great deal of problem others really do have a sort of off work for two or three days every month and it 's not a bundle of laughs because you know that really must be difficult but they they get a rough idea of how it for them .  1299870_1321520
*PS0A8:	Mm .  1322730_1322790
*PS0AA:	and it goes through their for the rest of their twenties the rest of their thirties and most of their forties and then suddenly bang maybe something ghastly seems to be happening which they are absolutely unaware of you know they do n't know why they are crying or or er unable to cope with whatever they ca n't cope with and that 's it that 's them off and they start worrying about er osteoporosis and you know an enormous number of of now medically defined problems of the menopause and they may start going on to all sorts of things like hormone replacement therapy or even primrose oil or whatever the hell and they 're sitting there at an age when they are fairly loaded up with experience and maturity and all the rest of it and they do n't know what they are doing All the wisdom of er in in writing and doctors and everything else says oh it all varies you know some do this and some do that some go straight through in a regal dignified way and they just carry on into relatively old age you know smooth as relaxed nothing to worry about away .  1324640_1424260
*PS0A8:	Mm mm .  1424260_1424760
*PS0AA:	And tt Jan was er was er wondering during last year and went on to hormone replacement therapy because she was and the doctor was a bit concerned about possible osteoporosis which is erm brittle bone .  1424760_1447670
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1448310_1448380
*PS0AA:	i it 's it 's obviously a thing which if one can possibly avoid it 's a good idea to and erm I must say it helped but it you do n't know what is helping because you know we do n't know what her symptoms are going to be Maybe H R T was helping what her symptoms would have been if she had n't taken them maybe they were worse because she was maybe they were the same in spite of it but I du n no Er anyhow th th the the eventual thing was maybe her blood pressure was going up higher than it should and maybe whether the cumulative stress of having a husband off in my state maybe .  1449500_1508160
*PS0A8:	Yeah what .  1509470_1509860
*PS0AA:	her you know maybe all sorts of things .  1510660_1515950
*PS0A8:	Yeah well this is th this is it I mean th th there are often a lot of things happening at the same time er er some of which as you just sort of hinted at are sort of er erm of a psychological er er have a psychological factor in them which all add to it do n't they .  1515950_1534280
*PS0AA:	Well my feeling is that you know if yo if you 're car does n't run tinker with the carburettor and if it still is n't running right tinker with something else if you like the fatal thing is to tinker with both because then you just do n't know what you 've got and erm she 's been on on this hormone replacement which is er er no big deal but you know hormones are .  1534790_1570600
*PS0A8:	Well th .  1570790_1570920
*PS0AA:	big things .  1571900_1572690
*PS0A8:	I I I 've met ladies who have have really benefited .  1572690_1576040
*PS0AA:	Oh yeah .  1576520_1576970
*PS0A8:	from it .  1576970_1578020
*PS0AA:	oh yeah .  1578020_1578320
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1578320_1578420
*PS0AA:	Erm her blood pressure was being being depressed er by some other you know blood pressure regulator and erm one of the side effects of hormone replacement may be yeah that people 's susceptibility to migraine is heightened So y y y you you you you 've got at least three things which are all sort of brewing up there and you think good grief what a what a what a state to be in because the poor doctor does n't know what on earth to do poor Jan does n't know well it 's worse for Jan cos she 's sitting there thinking I 'm going potty or you know ca n't stand properly or you know is leaning over or or numb down one side of her face or or or whatever it was it was i i it was the the dizziness I think actually which which was most alarming And so erm get flu on top of it all erm .  1578640_1673330
*PS0A8:	Quite .  1673330_1673390
*PS0AA:	It really is a very difficult difficult erm .  1673650_1676810
*PS0A8:	Yeah there 's quite a bit of flu about at the moment is n't there .  1676810_1680170
*PS0AA:	Yeah Well what I know the answer is is to say do n't worry be concerned but do n't worry because worrying does n't do you no good it does n't do the condition no good and it does n't do everybody else any good either because they just say oh she 's you know what she is depressed by whatever it is and that 's as it were objectively logical but wh wh what seems to me to be the absolutely overwhelming is to say he 's not worried he 's desperately concerned he 's more concerned than humans can possibly be but if god is n't worried what on earth are we burning up our resources worrying about because if he 's not worried concerned yes but he 's not worried .  1680170_1741820
*PS0A8:	Who are you talking about now .  1742710_1745290
*PS0AA:	God .  1745290_1745580
*PS0A8:	Oh god yeah Yeah .  1745580_1746800
*PS0AA:	I mean he is desperately concerned I mean he he loves us all with a concern which just er er er er i is greater than anything we can understand so concern at the at the slightest er doubt about I ca n't understand how concerned he is but er I totally relax .  1746800_1770600
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1771660_1771860
*PS0AA:	but if the god of heaven is concerned that 's fine he 's not worrying because he created the whole thing therefore it seemed to me pretty good reason to be concerned .  1772290_1787550
*PS0A8:	Concerned but not worried .  1788420_1789520
*PS0AA:	but not worried and I 'm certainly not .  1789520_1791000
*PS0A8:	Yeah I well I 'm with you mm .  1791010_1792660
*PS0AA:	you know lying awake at nights you know cos er th three and four in the morning everything 's quiet you know .  1792660_1803220
*PS0A8:	Mm .  1803340_1803560
*PS0AA:	the heating 's off .  1804610_1805220
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  1805220_1805380
*PS0AA:	I think people who are liable to worry about their condition have a very very difficult time at three and four in the morning and er old ladies are particularly vulnerable I think .  1805460_1835440
*PS0A8:	Well I I had a period of waking up at four .  1835440_1837790

*PS0AA:	Yeah I think that 's that 's right you know That 's where everyone 's different of course but erm I I think it is it is it is a factor that erm one can watch television or can listen to the radio or one can go for a walk or do all sorts of things as it were before noon and midnight but three or four in the morning you know when everything is .  1848790_1880810

*PS0AA:	0 . 
*PS0A8:	That must be the best part of the year ago I should think though now .  2043994_2050054
*PS0AA:	Yeah Well the the the the the sort of the sort of background as I have seen it he never struck me as being particularly clever or bright it 's just that he always seemed to be very well taught and academically successful and exams never seemed an undue problem and so he went off to Wolverhampton Poly which he selected for you know all the usual reasons reasonable place reasonable course a reasonable this a reasonable that tt erm to do computer science which of course all the kids want to do now erm twentieth centu no it is n't it 's a sort of nineteen eighties version of wanting to be an engine driver is n't it They all want to be so he went off to be a computer scientist and either he was too interested in er what he describes as cult television which you think .  2050054_2138984
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	but it 's not television i i it 's it 's Doctor Who and and Prisoner and you know er very interesting and very easy for enthusiasts to direct a lot of their time and energy to maybe I do n't maybe there was a increased pressure to work and study which was erm self motivated rather than being externally imposed maybe he maybe there was a fundamental lack of enthusiasm in him for what is described as the hardware of computing the the the the the instruments the machines maybe there was a less than comprehensive understanding of what is known as the firmware that 's to say I mean operating systems that are built into the thing to make it work you 've got to understand the firmware because otherwise you do n't understand what the machine will think you mean and what that will do and I would have thought that whereas superficially you can ignore the firmware it 's all in there it understands as you I would have thought grew into a er a graduate computer scientist you 've got to have some idea about that Er maybe he was I think a little superficial in his enthusiasm for what is referred to as the software that 's to say that 's the computer programs that you .  2139434_2287214
*PS0A8:	Yeah .  2287334_2287654
*PS0AA:	write you write and er feed into the thing which it operates along the rules defined by its firmware which someone else has put into it Anyhow whatever it was maybe a little as Jan says he also had a f a bad flu bug at a bad time anyhow he crashed out of the computer science course and he announced that he was only regarding the computer science course as being a stepping stone to being a teacher so the sensible thing to do would be to go on to the teacher training course at Lancashire an education course cos that 's what he wanted to do So that cost an awful lot of money because he was on a grant of course and he he spent er about a year as a trainee teacher and we thought that was great because he was he was dealing with with er .  2287654_2363234
*PS0A8:	Was n't he i in juniors yeah yeah .  2363234_2364374

*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	and I would have thought it was absolutely great you know he really I would have though had a stimulating challenging lovely environment to to to be in I I I I I hoped that if he was going I thought he was going to go on it was just going to be very expensive tt paying his fees his this .  2405124_2430424
*PS0A8:	0 . 
*PS0AA:	I was therefore a little surprised and very disappointed when he failed his teaching practice Erm I was I was a bit erm about that you know I just though what on earth now He is unemployed and receiving state benefit as employed which is n't very much .  2430504_2469524

*PS0A8:	Mm .  2514664_2515044
*PS0AA:	large not generous but I think good grief poor Christopher 's sitting there I agree the state is picking up his his rent which is er er quite a lot er but even so you know he has n't got very much money and can not have a very enthusiastic view of what the future holds .  2515044_2552394

*PS0AA:	it is no easier in greater Wolverhampton and if you have eczema and a congenitally weak back you are n't actually falling over yourself in prospects for the best chances So erm we 're both very concerned not worried very concerned about what on earth he is doing and what he is going to do .  2583214_2622474
