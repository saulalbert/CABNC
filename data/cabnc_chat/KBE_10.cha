*JUL:	He sleeps in a normal bed all right.She was packing his stuff and I was bringing him upstairs to his room like away from her like.Like he knows she's in the house and he wants to go wherever she goes.But if she's not in the house it doesn't worry him.If he knows she's not there.So I can go upstairs and put him in his rocking chair.
*BET:	 (        ) rocking chair.Well there's not a lot I said to her does he sleep in that?It's a full size single bed?And she said yeah.I said bloody hell!I never knew a child of one could sleep in a normal size bed.

*JUL:	As soon as she was upstairs.He knew that she was up there   (        ) I let him sort of try and climb up.Well he climbed up the bloody first stair.Like he was behind er I never held him I was behind him like you know well it gives his legs a bit more like movement.Who's that who was on the telephone?
*UNK:	 (        )

*JUL:	That'll be it?
*UNK:	 (        ) she'll have to keep an eye on him then.
