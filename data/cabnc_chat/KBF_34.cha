*BRE:	Mm. •210168_210176•

*JEA:	Yes  and  eventually  Shirley and I thought, well I mean, we spent weeks grouting, we grouted and we grouted  and still water was coming through and we grouted and at last it seemed to be dry  and the man came and did the re-artexing on the insurance  and I had new wallpaper put up, for which I paid extra because he only allowed eight pounds a roll, the insurance company only  pays eight pounds a roll  and I had eleven pound wallpaper and a border  and having got the whole thing up  the the patches have appeared again! •228078_231074•
