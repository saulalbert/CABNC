        That's right. •262598_262656•
*DOU:	Right, so anyway, we've got as far as that and your  everything seems alright eh? •262656_264277•
*VAL:	That's okay. •264286_264337•
*DOU:	Right. •264382_264400•
        So it's quite simple  there's no  as far as my bit goes it is erm  erm  it's just really the  as I say, the roof design's going to  be used to design the roof for us. •264491_266239•
        Er,struts and whatever just for strengthening. •266239_266783•
*VAL:	Mm. •266811_266822•
*DOU:	Erm  it'll be basically the same shape as what you've seen in that. •266882_268413•
*VAL:	Mhm. •268413_268441•
*DOU:	Like that. •268545_268628•

        And that's quite a nice  •270307_270392•
*DOU:	Yeah. •270406_270416•
*VAL:	shape isn't it? •270550_270628•
        I was impressed by it. •270628_270727•
*DOU:	Aye, I quite like it myself. •270735_270970•
        And er  of course there'll be the, the  obviously the strengtheners will come through  cannot be divided up accordingly. •270970_272140•
*VAL:	Mm. •272257_272322•
*DOU:	Usually it's divided up to suit the  the er  tt, panels that's below. •272330_273492•
*VAL:	Right. •273505_273515•
*DOU:	Er,these actually run in line. •273843_274314•
*VAL:	Mhm. •274325_274345•
*DOU:	Right? •274350_274359•
        Say that one's in again, and er, er  and that, it's cos you're, you're relying on that being the  the support to, to support it. •274359_276404•

*VAL:	Mm. •276558_276564•

*VAL:	Right. •277390_277399•
*DOU:	they can carry the weight. •277419_277544•
        It's, really as I say, the design is all down to the size but  it  it's because of the snow fall that could go in, that can obviously because it's sloped like it cannae lie on it but •277570_278654•
*VAL:	Right. •278718_278734•
*DOU:	if it happens to give or  here, and it does nay get away right •278734_279102•
*VAL:	Right. •279102_279115•
*DOU:	there are so many to think, obviously, at some point that they may cover up so  again, that's where it's designed  the  •279120_279756•
