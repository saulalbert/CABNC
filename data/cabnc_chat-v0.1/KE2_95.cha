*TER:	That's right. •167803_167827•
*MAR:	on them so  •167827_167871•
*TER:	Mm  •167871_167886•
*MAR:	we've arranged this  five day break. •167886_168236•
*TER:	But if we have everything ready  to leave as soon as I get back from chess and I'll make sure I leave promptly  if we can come straight away then, with a bit of luck  we'll be on to the M twenty five by half past four  so we might  •168833_170913•
*MAR:	How far round do we have to go on that? •170936_171083•
*TER:	Practically the whole half way round. •171083_171253•
*MAR:	Do we? •171300_171320•
        Yeah  •171440_171446•
*TER:	About forty miles on it. •171451_171555•
        It's not a lot further than Gatwick but in the other direction. •171555_171906•
*MAR:	Yeah. •171927_171933•
*TER:	But it's gonna take us, I mean, what Gatwick took us about three and a half hours didn't it? •172119_172571•
*MAR:	Yeah. •172643_172649•
*TER:	Well I reckon it's gonna take us three and a half hours to get to the other end, so two and a half hours to it  and an hour on it if it's not too bad and then of course we've got to go up from there to Ipswich, Woodbridge  but it's dual carriageway all the way now you see. •172703_174050•
*MAR:	Yeah yeah. •174057_174125•
*TER:	So I mean it's seventy miles so it should only take us another hour. •174178_174456•
*MAR:	 (        )  (.) 
*TER:	So  perhaps four and a half hours, if we don't get held up on the M twenty five, four and a half hours would do so that, if we leave here at two, we could be there, you know, well by seven. •175194_176234•
*MAR:	So you're going, you  will be at three  •178995_179409•
*TER:	Quarter past five. •179552_179642•
