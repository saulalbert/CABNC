        And I felt  and I said I did not kill her and I was the murderer and Shameer said check  hit me but she didn't it felt like a hit and you don't accidentally do that do you? •693835_709323•
*JAC:	Well if it was dark and she couldn't see you she might have put her arm out and hit you it doesn't  what it feels like isn't always what it is if you see what I mean. •709323_718153•
*CHR:	You could see a little bit  but not much. •718153_725053•
