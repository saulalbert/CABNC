*CAR:	Is there a lot of difference between   (.) fishing a in the evening?
*ADA:	I don't know, I've not fished there in the evening, yet.
*CAR:	That's true.
*ADA:	This'll be my first   (.) attempt   (.) I would imagine   (.) that it won't make a lot of difference   (.) I could be wrong.
*CAR:	Have you now learnt how to do this tying or do you have to go and see Terry every time? ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	 ((laugh)) Erm   (.) I think I've learnt how to do it, it's   (.) fairly straightforward   (.) but er   (.) him having tied the leader on for me   (.) I won't have to   (.) go back to him anyway for quite some time.
*CAR:	So you weren't concentrating when you were watching with him?
*ADA:	I don't think so,th the point is I'm not going to be called to tie a knot like this again   (.) for maybe three weeks and then by then I'll make things up   (.) it was really more for convenience than sitting down trying to work it out myself   (.) so you know  (        ) .
*CAR:	Is there not a book of   (.) angling knots?
*TOB:	It means there must places doesn't it?
*ADA:	No he's just practising at the moment lovey   (.) he's practising his swing   (.) but I agree if he stood that distance he wouldn't be able to hit the ball would he would you. ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	It wouldn't reach it would it? ((laugh)) 
*ADA:	He's right in the middle of the fairway though, it's a nice looking shot he's got to play isn't it?
*TOB:	Mm.
*ADA:	Oh this one isn't so nice   (.) with all this sand.
*CAR:	Oh look at all that sand.
*ADA:	Ooh   (.) well that was good wasn't it?
*TOB:	Mhm.
*ADA:	Clever boy.
*TOB:	Clever.
*ADA:	There we are and he'll go with the man who was practising his swing   (.) what's the matter with him now   (.) come on get on with it.
*TOB:	Come on get on with it, ooh.
*ADA:	Now that's Mark .
*CAR:	Is it?
*TOB:	How did you know?
*ADA:	Cos I know what he looks like   (.) it'll be like looking at you and saying that's Toby  cos I know what you look like as well   (.) do you think?
*TOB:	Yeah   (.) you mean he's an old friend of yours.
*ADA:	Him?
*CAR:	Ha.

*ADA:	Did you see that? (.) Ooh that wasn't a bad shot was it?
*TOB:	No, he got that one.
*ADA:	Ooh just stayed on the green   (.) he's not pleased with it.
*CAR:	Ooh.
*TOB:	Why isn't he?
*ADA:	Cos he thinks he should have done better than that   (.) and he's right   (.) he should of done better.
*CAR:	Is that Ian Woosnam?
*ADA:	No.
*TOB:	Well anyway if you know 
*CAR:	Well it looks like him. ((laugh)) 
*TOB:	all the golfers you erm you'll be glad that one   (.) once
