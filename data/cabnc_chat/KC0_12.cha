@Comment:	conversation #12 (Tape 033503)
*ENI:	No, and of course the weeds will have a
*MOL:	Yeah, they   (        ) 
*ENI:	a fine old time won't they?
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Aha.But your ground, I   (.) imagine you've kept it fairly cre , free of weeds   (.) for quite a 
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	time now?
*MOL:	Erm   (.) on our   (.) some of our small plants   (.) we don't use any erm   (.) sprays or  (        ) 
*ENI:	No.
*MOL:	we use erm   (.) a rake   (.) or a   (        ) and we draw across the seeds and   (.) that'll   (.) ra , bring out the weeds.
*ENI:	Yes.
*MOL:	I done that   (.) on my wheat this afternoon   (.) erm   (.) but we have to use fertiliser on ours cos 
*ENI:	Mm.
*MOL:	we don't have to sort of, ain't gotta take really too much muck
*ENI:	Mm.Yes.
*MOL:	cos we do   (.) half, we muck erm   (.) I've grown pretty well
*ENI:	Mm.
*MOL:	so it gives the plants a boost
*ENI:	Yes.
*MOL:	so we don't have too much muck so, and like   (.) put some fertiliser on the other bits.
*ENI:	I see.Because, in fact, you can't put that compost   (.) on the, or that muck on the, when you say muck, do you mean the compost that you make with the vegetables?
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Yes.Erm, you can't put that on till it's really broken down can you?
*MOL:	No.
*ENI:	So it's erm   (.) you use up probably quite quickly what you've got.
*MOL:	Yes, erm   (.) all our   (.) sort of cabbage stalks and   (.) beans stalks go onto   (.) the muck heap   (.) to turn into a sort of compost, but   (.) other people they just sort of burn   (        ) or take them away and buy a bag of compost.
*ENI:	Yes.
*MOL:	But erm   (.) bought bags of compost aren't so good   (.) cos if you use all er, stuff you're growing you put erm   (.) it back onto the ground
*ENI:	Mm.Mm.
*MOL:	what's come off the ground.
*ENI:	Mm, yes.Yes, it seems reasonable doesn't it, to put it all back?It's all been natural stuff hasn't it?
*MOL:	Yes.
*ENI:	Aha.Which bit of the gardening do you like best?
*MOL:	Well erm   (.) the best bit, I like harvesting, I don't like   (.) the digging is alright but it hurt your back so 
*ENI:	Yes.You get   (.) yo wo once you've done a lot you suddenly 
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	feel it don't you?But the hoeing is nice and easy
*MOL:	Yeah, okay.
*ENI:	more or less.Mm.
*MOL:	We got erm   (.) various sorts of hoes.We got a Dutch hoe, that's 
*ENI:	Mm.
*MOL:	pretty easy to use.
*ENI:	Nice!
*MOL:	And erm, we got another hoe   (.) oh er, I don't like using it cos it's got wood and it keeps giving me splinters!
*ENI:	It's got, oh really, that's the handle is it, that does 
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	that?
*NOE:	Hiya Ben!
*ENI:	Ho 
*MOL:	Hello.Hello.
*ENI:	We've got a hoe that   (.) what is that hoe called, that we've got Noel?It's   (.) got these prongs that go like that.
*NOE:	Oh, what's 
*MOL:	Erm 
*NOE:	that for?
*MOL:	Oh yeah, I've got one of them.

*NOE:	Er, oh yes.
*MOL:	Erm , I got two of them.
*ENI:	Mm!

*ENI:	Do you?Yes th , there's something nice about the old tools isn't there?
*MOL:	Yes, cos they 
*NOE:	We've got one hoe that's at least two hundred years old!
*ENI:	Yes.
*NOE:	Yeah , yeah.And we've, but only found the   (.) middle part
*MOL:	Mm.
*NOE:	and I had it   (.) sharpened by Hector 
*MOL:	Yes.
*NOE:	and now it's as good as new!You can see it afterwards.
*MOL:	Yes, where erm   (.) my next neighbour gave me   (.) some stuff erm, then I went into her shed cos she had   (.) erm, some mice problems so dad went in there to   (.) have a look round, seeing the poison were   (.) wore off and we found   (.) quite a lot of old gardening chu , tools.
*ENI:	Ooh did you?

*MOL:	Yeah, erm   (.) when we're up the farm   (.) when er, after a few days we put the feed in them they smell.
*ENI:	Oh that's not nice is it?

*ENI:	Yes, that's because they've got a light on them isn't it?
*MOL:	Yeah.

*MOL:	Yeah, erm when we   (.) went in there for a few times used to get headaches and that.
*ENI:	Yes, nasty!
*MOL:	Yeah, but the weather was cold, when cold that er, it took away some of the smell
*ENI:	Mhm.
*MOL:	but as they got muddier it   (.) worsened.
*ENI:	Yes.I in the end it gets yuck!
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	 ((laugh)) 
*MOL:	Erm   (.) the really old sheds they're better than the new ones that

*ENI:	 ((laugh))  (.) That's right they, and they must be a bit fiddly to peel mustn't they?To scrape, rather.
*MOL:	Yeah.
*ENI:	Instead of a nice long scrape, you've got to go round corners haven't you?
*MOL:	Yeah I keep, when I   (.) I I always scrape the vegetables sometimes but when I do though I keep cutting my fingers!
*ENI:	Ugh, yes, yes!
*MOL:	So I gave them to dad to do.

*MOL:	Cos they'll, they'll work their way back in.
*ENI:	I'm sure.
*MOL:	Start eating the   (.) plants and that.

*ENI:	I've forgotten what they used to use so soot especially.My father used it, but I've forgotten what it was.
*NOE:	Never use it on vegetables, around vegetables   (        ) to stop   (.) insects creeping too.
*ENI:	Does it?
*NOE:	It'll stop them from   (.) crawling across, (        ) 
*ENI:	They don't like it?
*NOE:	just under the surface, they couldn't get  (        ) .
*ENI:	No.No.Aha.There are so many   (.) things you've got to be looking out for in those
*MOL:	Yes, erm   (.) I read up quite a lot of things about   (.) keeping pests away, but I don't   (.) dad reads them   (.) and tells me about them, but I forget cos they have to go back
