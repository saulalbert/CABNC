*CHR:	Where's Snoopy getting the money from to go to the Tiger's Head tonight?
*NOR:	 (        ) credit cards in use.She can go where she likes.I only gave her fifteen.So I said I was tired of waiting for the money for my things and she can collect it from the students and have it when it came.
*CHR:	Well done.That was a fiver was it?
*NOR:	 (        )  (.) 
*CHR:	Yes.Presumably they've all got their films.So they should jolly well be stumping up.
*NOR:	If she's not bothered to collect them
*CHR:	Yep yep suffer.Yep.
