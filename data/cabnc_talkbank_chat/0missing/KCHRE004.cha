*PS1BV:	They fell off . 
*PS1BT:	they did n't know a lot about steel they were made out of iron . 
*PS1BS:	Mm You can have a . 
*PS1BT:	And when he built his first engine it was made out of erm iron and stuff and was extremely heavy . 
*PS1BS:	I have n't done enough peppers What am I thinking of there . 
*PS1BU:	Is steel lighter than iron . 
*PS1BT:	Well not necessarily Chris Erm . 
*PS1BU:	Is it stronger but . 
*PS1BT:	It 's it 's stronger weight for weight you see or well it can be in certain circumstances . 
*PS1BS:	Grab a chair there . 
*PS1BT:	Steel tends to be a bit more elastic . 
*PS1BU:	Oh . 
*PS1BT:	Iron do iron certainly the stuff they used then cast iron was very brittle and . 
*PS1BU:	Aha . 
*PS1BT:	so it wo n't stand shocks . 
*PS1BS:	Mm . 
*PS1BT:	So if you put a big heavy engine going down a cast iron railway which wo n't . 
*PS1BU:	That might hit the railway . 
*PS1BT:	which wo n't be made properly . 
*PS1BU:	Ah . 
*PS1BT:	it 'll go and crack it . 
*PS1BU:	Mm . 
*PS1BT:	But I mean having said that there 's lots of cast iron bridges around still lo the one at Stamford Bridge is er . 
*PS1BU:	Mm . 
*PS1BT:	cast iron and I mean it 's no problem in that situation . 
*PS1BV:	And get a shock Ah ah The steam engine coming through .

*PS1BS:	That 's right . 
*PS1BT:	Anderson Street . 
*PS1BS:	Ooh .

*PS1BS:	I 'll take that I 'll take that one for you . 
*PS1BU:	And three crossings in about five hundred metres . 
*PS1BT:	Well that 's about right yes So you can imagine what it 'll be like cos erm twenty years ago in the summer well no twenty five years ago .
