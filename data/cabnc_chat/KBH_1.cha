@Comment:	conversation #1 (Tape 003901)
*ADA:	The two companies concerned are trying to record the spoken word.
*CHA:	 (        ) 
*CAR:	We don't want you on tape. (.) 
*ADA:	So the thing, the thing to do is to sort of dot around in the conversation things like pre antidisestablishmentarianism.And hopefully   ((laugh))  (.) 
*CAR:	This will get modern usage of words.Of, one of the words that she was talking about, people have started using wicked for   (        ) a normal phrase.I mean, it doesn't mean what it says in the dictionary any more.
*PAU:	That's a really wicked thing to say, he went, no it's not it's bad, it's not wicked.He thinks of wicked as being good, he doesn't, cause Mandy says wicked.
*CAR:	Yeah. (.) Well that's the idea anyway.
*PAU:	He goes round saying wicked, it's his favourite word. (.) 
*CAR:	Are you going to go to sleep, eh?Please    ((baby gurgling)) (.) That doesn't mean much, does it?
*ADA:	She's just looking over there to see which one she wants to throw up on. (.) 
*CAR:	Who do you want to go and gurgle at?Eh?
*PAU:	Oh not Uncle Brian, no no no. (.) 
*CAR:	No? (.) Have you had enough grub for a little while?There you are, go and see somebody.
*PAU:	 (        ) she's got a ginormous one.She had it  (        ) .Well don't   (        ) to me I've only just you
*ADA:	Come on, give Auntie Pauline a nice smile.
*CAR:	Go on, you do lovely smiles. (.) 
*PAU:	 ((baby talk)) (.) 
*CAR:	If she smiles it will be at your hairline.Pardon?
*UNK:	She won't be able to see that far, will she?
*CAR:	She might be able to see a blurred shape.
*PAU:	 (        ) she's just looked this way now.She kept looking over there.Don't know what she was looking at.What were you looking at?
*CAR:	Well she definitely looks at her mobile.
*ADA:	Yeah?
*CAR:	I know it drives you mad, the music but er  (.) 
*ADA:	I wouldn't mind if those blasted   (        ) slightly longer life in terms of the music they played.But unfortunately, you know, it's   ((singing)) or whatever.But it's   (        ) over again.
*CAR:	Well, yes.Well I mean that's what's nice for them, isn't it?
*PAU:	Yeah.You see they've got a short concentration.
*ADA:	Do you think   (        ) music in the background   (        ) sort of, do all the lyrics as well . ((laugh)) 
*CAR:	Oh of course Oh well done. (        ) the last half hour.
*PAU:	 (        ) a little bit wasn't it?
*CAR:	She's had a lot of that today.
*PAU:	Have you? (.) 
*CAR:	Well don't put it on too loud, will you?
*PAU:	 (        ) why babies have a suck there. ((laugh)) You say they're having milk, he went, what do you mean?Milk?What do you mean milk comes out there? ((laugh)) So I said well it's only when you've just had a baby like, you know, like cows.
*CAR:	Love him.
