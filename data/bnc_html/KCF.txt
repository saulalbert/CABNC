                           again Herbert?
                           [14] Every time you walk in she
Herbert (PS1EM)            [15] Well
Iris (PS1EN)               [16] walks out.
Herbert (PS1EM)            [17] well we can all go and listen to Coronation
                           Street. ...
Iris (PS1EN)               [18] Alright!
Herbert (PS1EM)            [19] Well you, cos you haven't seen it have you
                           Alison?
                           [20] ... You didn't er that [...] did you?
*** 2 (Tape 028002) ***
Alison (PS1EP)  [21] Yeah but I'm saying they're not paying ... they haven't
                gotta pay for that machine.
Herbert (PS1EM) [22] Who hasn't gotta pay for the machine?
Alison (PS1EP)  [23] Well if they're doing, somebody by hand's doing it, they
                haven't got that [...] of paying for that machine.
Herbert (PS1EM) [24] Yeah but ... the machine could do what a hundred people
                could do in a day, can't it?
                [25] The machine doesn't get tired like people do.
Alison (PS1EP)  [26] Yeah but I mean
Herbert (PS1EM) [27] The peo the machine only goes off bad if somebody hasn't
                been maintaining it.
                [28] ... And all you've gotta do is, with machine is put petrol
                or diesel or whatever it is to make [...] and check all the oil

Alison (PS1EP)  [29] And [...]
Herbert (PS1EM) [30] I know [...] but ... that offsets ... the labour is the,
                labour is the thing that costs a fortune. ...
Alison (PS1EP)  [...]
Herbert (PS1EM) [31] Yeah.
Alison (PS1EP)  [32] Well why don't you do it all before [...] and [...]
Herbert (PS1EM) [33] Well they do.
                [34] [...] and they've got it in but ... it wants it at
                different times doesn't it?
                [35] So you can't give it fertiliser.
Alison (PS1EP)  [36] Well I still think that ... well say you have a big
                massive thing and, and say it'd take ... a hundred people ...
                mm er I suppose the bigger it is the more economical it is.
                [37] But if you only had a small place it'd be more economical
                to have labour than it would to buy ... paying out thousands of
                pounds for machines and
Herbert (PS1EM) [38] No you don't buy the, they come round and do it for you
                don't they?
Alison (PS1EP)  [39] Well alright then [...]
Herbert (PS1EM) [40] You hire it for a day ... or whatever it is.
                [41] It costs ... just say for instance two hundred pounds for
                the tractor and, and his sprayer ... and er the chemicals on
                top.
                [42] ... That's done your whole field ... big field.
                [43] Now that two hundred pound will only pay one man for a ...
                for a week ... to do the same thing.
                [44] ... And he's gotta do it a few times, so then the cost
                becomes ... and, and you ... like let's be fair, we've had
                summers where it's ... the weeds er the weeds haven't grown,
                but you get a wet summer ... and the weather warms and the wet
                and the weeds go peooow up like that.
                [45] ... So that's, and then it doesn't ... stops [...]
Alison (PS1EP)  [46] Well alright then, why can't he put bark on it [...] ?
Herbert (PS1EM) [47] Well that, it costs.
Alison (PS1EP)  [48] [...] from everywhere.
                [49] Do it that way.
Herbert (PS1EM) [50] But it's still costs isn't it?
Alison (PS1EP)  [...]
Herbert (PS1EM) [51] Well then if you put a lot of bark on it ... and with
                vegetables, so they want [laughing] fertilizer []
Alison (PS1EP)  [52] Well [...]

                           going again on Monday. ... [...] ... [...]
Herbert (PS1EM)            [125] Well the thing is if he can get four hundred
                           quid why doesn't he get one of them new bikes that
                           Sinclair's brought out?
                           [126] ... Well, they run for an hour on a battery
                           ... without pedalling, three hours if you pedal.
Alison (PS1EP)             [...]
Herbert (PS1EM)            [127] It's a bike ... it's electric.

                           pedalling.
                           [138] If you pedal you can get as much as three
                           hours.

                           [167] You're not on a register.
Herbert (PS1EM)            [168] They put a stamp on you.
Alison (PS1EP)             [169] Stamp on where?
Herbert (PS1EM)            [170] On your hand.

Herbert (PS1EM)            [172] Well aye [...]
Alison (PS1EP)             [173] And you don't have to be twenty one either.

                           here.
Alison (PS1EP)             [175] No but [...] twenty one aren't you?
                           [176] You've got to be twenty one to vote there but
                           if you're, you're eighteen and you go in and
                           somebody else says you're twenty one you can vote.

                           country ... they've got a British passport.
Alison (PS1EP)             [178] No but I mean ... there are people that come
                           in here [...] and just living here.
Herbert (PS1EM)            [179] Yeah the Pakistanis!

                           all got British passports.
Alison (PS1EP)             [182] Well why are they allowed to have a British
                           passport?
Iris (PS1EN)               [...]
Herbert (PS1EM)            [183] [...] the empire we allowed them to have

Unknown speaker (KCFPSUNK) [...]
Herbert (PS1EM)            [184] They can get them because they are British.
Alison (PS1EP)             [185] Pakistan's British?
Herbert (PS1EM)            [186] Well it was, it was in the empire.
                           [187] It's in the commonwealth isn't it?
                           [188] And Indians and all this.
                           [189] And this is why we're trying to stop them
                           coming in.
                           [190] ... There's ten thousand a week coming in. ...

                           Germany this way in.

                           [196] All the rough jobs.
                           [197] They get in here ... then they bring their
                           families and then they're gonna ... fill the country
                           up aren't they?
                           [198] It's only a little tiny country.
                           [199] The Conservatives are trying to stop it.
                           [200] Th they're trying to get it through, the bill
                           through. [...]
Alison (PS1EP)             [201] And Labour won't stop them?
Herbert (PS1EM)            [202] No, Labour will allow them in.
                           [203] Course, what you've got to think of,
                           Conservatives are the one that started it in the
                           first place.
                           [204] So they've gotta try and kill it off now.
                           [205] But the Labour won't.
                           [206] But they didn't start it.
                           [207] Some things are very complicated [...] Alison.

Alison (PS1EP)             [213] Yes but they don't put it in words like you
                           put, they put it in blooming complicated language,
                           but tell lies.
Herbert (PS1EM)            [214] Don't, read between the lines.

                           a few lines.
                           [230] But he said
Herbert (PS1EM)            [231] [...] ?
Alison (PS1EP)             [232] Yeah he said, but the girl that was with him
                           said that you were very highly honoured to have a
                           letter that length cos usually she gets ... dear ...

                           gets a letter [] .
                           [234] So she said you're highly honoured to have a
                           letter that long.
                           [235] She's never seen one that long [...] .
Herbert (PS1EM)            [236] O over this election, what you've gotta do is

               [1759] ... But you go from the stairs and in the er
Iris (PS1EN)   [1760] You've got a kitchen diner.
               [1761] ... You've

Alison (PS1EP) [1767] I think you're better loo , looking in one that's all
               furnished out and that, cos I can't imagine that with furniture

Gordon (PS1ES) [1784] Right.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1785] some space there!
Alison (PS1EP) [1786] I know, it says garden to side. ... [...] .
Iris (PS1EN)   [1787] Well you can run what you like up your garden can't you?
Gordon (PS1ES) [1788] Mhm.
Alison (PS1EP) [1789] Well they the new ones on the ... front ... would they do
               that?
               [1790] ... Brand new, brand new one.
               [1791] ... Same as that.
               [1792] They're still building.
               [1793] ... I think this is why they can't sell cos they keep
               building on and people are going in the newer ones and not
               buying the ones that are lived in.
               [1794] ... And it's all ... all [...]
Iris (PS1EN)   [1795] Well you don't want a big roaring place do you?
Gordon (PS1ES) [1796] Oh heck, no!
Iris (PS1EN)   [1797] I mean, you're not gonna ... fill it with children are
               you?
Alison (PS1EP) [1798] Gonna fill it with little puppies!
Iris (PS1EN)   [1799] The smaller the better!
               [1800] I mean, I wish I had a small place.
Alison (PS1EP) [1801] And Kimmy wants to come and visit don't you?
               [1802] And you'll have this garden to run about in won't you?
               [1803] ... A big garden!
Iris (PS1EN)   [1804] I mean, we got a dining room that we use about three
               times a year!
Alison (PS1EP) [1805] Oh I'm not bothered about things like that, but I would
               have liked ... a decent size garden.
               [1806] ... That one that that bloke had in Wrexham, he'd got a
               go , good one there!
               [1807] ... Little bungalow.
               [1808] ... And like then, like dad said if you've got a decent
               sized garden at the back ... if you wanna extend ... you can put
               an extension on the back can't you?
Iris (PS1EN)   [1809] You can't extend on there.
Alison (PS1EP) [1810] No, cos it's a [...] one.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1811] It all depends what you're looking for Alison.
               [1812] You've just gotta make your mind up.
Alison (PS1EP) [1813] Yeah but the thing is, it's something that we've got to
               ... think for life really, or we're just gonna be in the same
               situation in ... a couple of years that we wanna ... something a
               bit bigger.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1814] That's right.
Alison (PS1EP) [1815] Won't we?
               [1816] ... I mean, we could be in a predicament that we've got
               to stay in there cos nobody will buy it!
               [1817] ... So how many houses are up for sale now?
Iris (PS1EN)   [1818] Prices are gonna come down aren't they?
Gordon (PS1ES) [1819] Yeah.
               [1820] ... But I said that ... and sort of just holding on a
               level now like, isn't it?
Iris (PS1EN)   [1821] Yeah, but I mean
Gordon (PS1ES) [1822] But erm ... but there's a lot ... trying to be sold like,
               isn't there?
               [1823] ... As you say ... they've gotta come down and probably
               ... we'll have to talk to them.
               [1824] ... To get, you know ... get the sales.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1825] The thing is if you're getting one that's lived in ...
               you're most likely to get the carpets and things like that in.
Gordon (PS1ES) [1826] Yeah.
               [1827] ... I mean like this.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1828] A brand new one you've got to fit haven't you?
Gordon (PS1ES) [1829] Yeah.
Alison (PS1EP) [1830] Mm.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1831] And even if you buy a cheap carpet to start with it's not
               gonna last long as i ,i ,i
Gordon (PS1ES) [1832] No, no.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1833] you know you've gotta yo , you're talking a thousand for
               carpets!
Gordon (PS1ES) [1834] Yeah.
               [1835] ... Yeah.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1836] Not many people that's lived in a house take the carpets
               cos they won't fit wherever else they're going.
Gordon (PS1ES) [1837] No, well that's it, they just
Alison (PS1EP) [1838] Especially if it's smaller ones cos they're probably
               moving onto a bigger house.
Iris (PS1EN)   [1839] Yeah.
               [1840] ... I don't know what you wanna big roaming house for?
Alison (PS1EP) [1841] I don't want a big roaming house, but I want ... a decent
               sized house ... and ... with a bit of garden!
               [1842] ... I'm not asking for much mother!
               [1843] ... Are we?
Iris (PS1EN)   [1844] It's what you live in I think.
               [1845] ... I mean, you're not gonna be ... it's not as though
               you're gonna be having people staying or ... erm ... I mean if
               you're gonna get a little place with a little single bed in
Alison (PS1EP) [1846] Can't invite people [...] .
Iris (PS1EN)   [1847] you can't invite people to stay.
               [1848] ... Can you?
Alison (PS1EP) [1849] Nope!
Iris (PS1EN)   [1850] It's ... I know, it's a place of your own, it's your own
               and it's not a big place to keep ... clean is it?
Gordon (PS1ES) [...]
Iris (PS1EN)   [1851] I mean, the more space you have, the more muck you'll
               make!
Alison (PS1EP) [1852] I know.
Gordon (PS1ES) [1853] And also it'll ... the ... bound to be ... building and
               that ... it'll, you watch them [...] .
