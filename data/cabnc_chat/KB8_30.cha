Some of these things as well, they've been pinching   (.) back from upstairs, toys they, they've played with when they were smaller   (.) and they don't play with them now and I put them upstairs out of the way and they keep going and finding them and bringing them down.  (.) That was up, cos they don't seem to play with that much now.  (.) So have you got all these things delivered now?

*MAG:	Do you have any more work to do? 
*JAM:	Well 
*MAG:	When, when    (  )   
*JAM:	  (  )  
*MAG:	You could hear such cheer when they, when they got the goal. 
*JAM:	Oh it was a great goal was that, wasn't it? 
*MAG:	 It was, yeah  and erm there was only Jim and I watching, the dog was lying peacefully   ((laugh)) then he jumped up   (  ) he started barking  he didn't   
*ANN:	  ((laugh))  
*MAG:	know what was going on. 
*JAM:	Peter   selling er, er a ticket to go, he didn't watch it. 
*MAG:	Jim says no, Kath's asked him if he would like to go but   (  ) he wanted to go down to Wembley er   (.) get yourself away! If you can, if you can get yourself a ticket. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*MAG:	Er he probably thinks he could get one through   (  ) but he says no, I've been once. But the second time, they tell me, isn't as good as the first  time when you go. 
*ANN:	  ((laugh))  
*MAG:	She says, well it's your team! (  )   
*ANN:	 Yes! 
*MAG:	cos it wasn't Sunderland that he went to see when he got the ticket the last time. I can't remember who he said it was   (.) but erm    (.)  (  ) I've always fancied going    (  )   
*ANN:	 So you get yourself down there, then. 
*MAG:	 (  ) Sunderland were there. ((laugh))  
*ANN:	Oh. 
*MAG:	I wouldn't have been bothered about any other   (.) cos you see it better on the, on the screen. 
*ANN:	Yes. 
*MAG:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Yes, you do. 
*MAG:	But you, you lose out a little bit on the atmosphere. 
*ANN:	Yes. 
*MAG:	Unless you can create your  own atmosphere. 
*ANN:	 Well, that's it. I mean you should have all your friends and neighbours in  and have a party! 
*MAG:	 Well the last  the last time when Sunderland got to the Final in seventy-three   (.) er there were five of us in the, in my house and I'd made red and white rosettes  ((laugh))  
*ANN:	  ((laugh))  
*MAG:	we had our red and white rosettes and when our, I was sitting watching the match and when they scored the goal my slippers went  up in the air. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAG:	And Jim er Bill grabbed the camera that was on the mantlepiece and he got a shot, not of me, but he got a shot of Pat and her friend and Bryan   and er, it was er, er, something I'll never forget. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*MAG:	 (  ) it really was   (.) So erm   (.) but I don't know, I, I think if Jim got a ticket, if he got two tickets and he said   (  ) do you wanna come?  I would   
*ANN:	 Mm. 
*MAG:	go like the shot but I, I certainly wouldn't go without Jim, without somebody else. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*MAG:	But I'll have to get me red and white coat out again    (  )   
*ANN:	 Well you wor  work on, work on Jim! I mean Pat said he can go so   (.) tell him to get two tickets and you'll go with him. (.)  
*MAG:	 (  ) red and white scarf   (  ) got plenty of other reds  ((laugh))  
*ANN:	I don't know if er 
*MAG:	I could, I could quickly get a Sunderland scarf, believe me, Ann. 
*ANN:	 Mm. 
*MAG:	There's shop in   (  ) sells them. 
*ANN:	Well our Nick used to have er a red, the red and white scarf and hat and everything. He had a tie   (.) there's drawers full of stuff upstairs belonging to him I don't know if there's anything in there. 
*MAG:	Do you remember when we used to    (  )   
*ANN:	 I knit him red and white stripe gloves. 
*JAM:	  (  ) yes. 
*MAG:	 (  ) red with a white tassel on it. 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*MAG:	Red and white scarf. (.)  (  )  
*JAM:	Mm. (.)  
*MAG:	Those were the days! 
*ANN:	Yeah. (.)  
*JAM:	Well, you know, apart from anything else they always   (  ) they were prepared to give me free tickets for the   (  ) would never do that. 
*MAG:	Yes, I know  (  )  
*JAM:	 (  ) I mean Newcastle, we went to Newcastle and they showed us round the ground er   (.) when there was no match on and we saw the trophies and the directors' box and various places like that. But they wouldn't let us in, if we wanted to go the match we had to pay. But er, Sunderland gave us free tickets, complimentary tickets not free tickets, complimentary tickets in the seats in the Grandstand! 
*ANN:	Aha. 
*JAM:	And er    (.)  (  ) were not cheap seats. 
*MAG:	No. 
*JAM:	And then we went round, you know where that   (  ) they had a training place at Washington? We went round there and showed us all the  way round   
*MAG:	 Did they? 
*JAM:	Yes er   (.) yes  cos er   
*MAG:	 When they  opened the ground at   (  ) a few years ago   (  ) Bill was still alive, and er we could go and visit, go into the ground and go and have a look round and it was open to the, the general public. Er, he took me down   (  )  ((laugh))  
*JAM:	 (  ) it was the tunnel where they came out and all round there  (  )  
*MAG:	Well, we, we went in from the    (  )   
*JAM:	 when there was a match on. 
*MAG:	and we went in from the   (  ) end and er   (.) down the pitch and in through the   (  ) saw the physio room and the, the changing room, baths   (.) upstairs   (  ) saw the trophy. 
*ANN:	Mm mm. 
*MAG:	 (  ) highlight in Hazel's life. ((laugh))  
*ANN:	 ((laugh)) 
*MAG:	And when I, I mean when I, I actu  actually felt quite emotional cos I'd not been to   (  ) Park to see a match for a long time and I mean we're living up here erm, and er, I just felt quite emotional when I got out and saw that lovely pitch it was in perfect    (  )   (  )   
*JAM:	 Oh, it's immaculate, oh yeah. 
*MAG:	Oh it was gorgeous! It was in the summer, before the season started.  (5.0) You haven't, you still haven't told me what this is made of? 
*JAM:	What, oh that's  (6.0)  
*ANN:	Jim, will you go and g  , what time does the off-licence shut? 
*JAM:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	The Victoria Wine.  Cos it's where, 
*JAM:	 Later isn't it?  Isn't it later? 
*ANN:	it's where I get my cigarettes from the Victoria Wine shop. (.)  
*JAM:	 (  )  (.)  (  ) this programme on. And there's this   (  ) to start with. Er, and Mo Mowlam, that's why I watched it cos Mo Mowlam was on     (  )  (.)  (  ) but anyway   (  ) all these nurses getting twenty thousand a year, staff nurses. 
*ANN:	No, what, he was talking about taxation. 
*JAM:	That's right. 
*ANN:	And that er they would be worse off because he said even staff nurses are getting more than twenty thousand pounds a year. 
*JAM:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Which of course charge nurses aren't getting anywhere near twenty thousand pounds a year and only a few   (.) erm nursing  officers. 
*JAM:	 Well  it's nursing officers, you have to get into that bracket if you get twenty thousand  a year. 
*ANN:	 Yes. 
*MAG:	Paul was er  telling all these nursery rhymes, nursery, fairy stories rather   
*JAM:	 There's this, there's, there's, there's Hague   (  ) this Hague  fellow  who's a tory   
*ANN:	 Hague is a   
*JAM:	you know, so I rang up to Anglia television last night in the programme and objected to this, 
*ANN:	And of course he had the  nurses' pay   
*JAM:	 this lie! 
*ANN:	scale in the other hand while he was ringing them.  Where's me purse? 
*JAM:	  (  )   (  ) make an announcement but no announcement was made. There was no announcement made at the end of the programme so, and they never got back to me, so I rang this morning first thing and last night they didn't ask me my name and address, but this morning they did. They got me name and address and telephone number at work and at home so   (  ) I told the unions that they had to write in and complain about it too. 
*MAG:	Mm. 
*ANN:	There you are. 
*JAM:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Thanks. 
*JAM:	and er   (.) but what, I mean    (  )   
*ANN:	  ((cough))  
*JAM:	who was sitting in the audience who is a nurse   (.) and er would've known and she would've been trying to get in and say this is not true.  (  ) But she did ask a question, she was the first question that was asked, the one about erm 
*ANN:	Yes, but that's all very well but, bout, but er 
*JAM:	it's too late then, that's what A  Angie said, Angie said, you know they, they make this and it's too late you can't undo the, the, it's a lie! 
*ANN:	 That's right!  So there's half the country thinking staff nurses are earning well over twenty thousand are owning, earning over twenty thousand. Your Pat said to me on Sunday while I was talking to her, she said, when she was saying oh well she doesn't know whether to vote Tory because 
*JAM:	They've never been so well off. 
*ANN:	she's done quite well under them. As Jim said, in six months time if he's redundant she won't be  feeling   
*MAG:	 Yes   
*ANN:	the same. 
*MAG:	it's true. 
*ANN:	But she said, I said oh   
*JAM:	 It was the La   it was Will Owen and the Labour government that brought  (  )  
*ANN:	I said oh Pat just, just, I said have you spoken to a nurse recently?  (.) You know, how demoralised they are and the state of the hospitals and things and she said, oh well, nurses er, they, they've always complained that they're hard up and, 
*MAG:	And they always have  been. 
*ANN:	 and  the rest of it. So, talk some sense into her will you? Just point out that they might be redundant and 
*JAM:	Well, if the Tories win, I mean the privatization will really go to town. I mean even the trusts. The ambulance men in Northumberland because it's a trust   (.) and they're paid by the trust 
*ANN:	That was another thing he said, wasn't it? 
*JAM:	 They, they   
*ANN:	That they privatized erm ambulance service, they're now the highest paid in the country. 
*JAM:	Which is 
*ANN:	and Jim, Jim's got their pay scale and, and 
*JAM:	Well the trust    (  ) paying them   
*ANN:	 They're being paid, 
*JAM:	less! 
*ANN:	they're being paid  less than the N H S   
*JAM:	 Than, than the N H S! 
*ANN:	ones! 
*JAM:	I mean just across, if they go down to Durham which is an N H S   (.) ambulance service. 
*ANN:	And that's, you know, anybody listening to that on the television would think, oh yes, that's true!  You know it's, it's   
*MAG:	  (  )  over there and you er believe  everything they've said. 
*ANN:	 once it's stuck in their head  then it's like reading things in the newspapers. 
*JAM:	What, what am I going for? 
*MAG:	Cigarettes. 
*ANN:	Er,fort  well if you, if you manage to get to Victoria Wines in time er, get me erm, (.) er twenty erm   (.) no, get me forty er Emb  what do they call them? Elite, please? If you've gotta go to the Co-op, just get me twenty of whatever's   (.) there is. 
*JAM:	Forty Elite? 
*ANN:	If you get to the Victoria Wine in time.  (.) I don't know if he will. I don't know if it shuts at five o'clock or what they do   (.) or if evening staff come on? I've never tried to go after   (.) five o'clock. 
*MAG:	Mind you, Ann, I suppose that's why Pat got thinking about a Tory er vote. 
*ANN:	No, she wasn't thinking, well she wasn't exactly thinking about a Tory vote. She said, well I, I don't know what to do, she said, I haven't read, you know, she hadn't read the election, she hadn't had time to read the election addresses, and she's not really interested in ac  actually so she hasn't watched it on the television. And I said, oh Pat, you don't want a Tory government in a  again, do you? And she said, well, I I I don't know, she said, you know we've done alright under them.  (.) What does she think's happening to education? What does she think's ha  happening to the hospitals? 
*MAG:	I don't think, probably she hasn't really thought it, she's, she's been more concerned with her own self but she's  (.) . can't, I don't know. I'll have to have a talk with her. 
*ANN:	 ((laugh))  Put your daughter straight! 
*MAG:	  (  )  I've, I've   (.) I've often thought I would never vote Tory but, I mean, I've been better off in some ways in that I was able to buy my council house. But that, as far as I can make out, is the only thing that I've benefited by, you know, with them being in. 
*ANN:	 Mm mm. 
*MAG:	erm 
*ANN:	The unemployed certainly haven't been better off. 
*MAG:	The, the thing  is   
*ANN:	 The  young people leaving school haven't been better off. 
*MAG:	Well it would be erm, the number of people who are being put out of work 
*ANN:	Yeah. 
*MAG:	and it's not just every week or every month, it's every day, when you hear of jobs being  lost   
*ANN:	 That's  right. (.)  
*MAG:	It's a, it's a    (  )   
*ANN:	 And isn't it a hundred, hundred and, hundred and fifty small businesses go bust every year? I mean they keep saying we've given the all, all these opportunities  to all these   
*MAG:	  (  ) a case in point   
*ANN:	small businessmen and  there's a hundred and fifty. 
*MAG:	 She tried to get, she's tried to get started making, doing her own business, spoke to her the other day and she's, well, Pat spoke to her on Sunday and she got more out of her than I did 
*ANN:	Mm. 
*MAG:	but er, she's not getting  (  )  
*ANN:	No. Paul next door left school, you know, he cou  all he wanted to be was a mechanic, it's, it's all he's ever been, he's really good. But he's learnt from his father 
*MAG:	Mm mm. 
*ANN:	and he couldn't a job and then, I me  I mean, he tried for apprenticeships all over the place and other jobs and he just couldn't get one! When his father died, when he was twenty- one, he took over the erm taxi business. Well it was private hire, but most of the work came from Northgate Hospital. 
*MAG:	Mm mm. 
*ANN:	You know they, they ran, they took the nurses, because the nurses home was a mile or, was it a mile or a mile and a half or something from the hospital, they had this, they took them in the morning and then they took them at lunchtime and then all the different shifts coming on and off they took them, and they had the schools run as well. And then, of course the er, they started running down Northgate hospital and they closed down the nurses home. So there was half his business worked out, wiped out in one go.  (.) And then erm, his schools run was way up into the country, quite a long way   (.) and then that was changed. First of all th  the erm registration went up, then something else went up and then   (.) two of his children from farthest away were moving so he was gonna be paid much less than that. Well the ordinary private hire, there's so many of them, I mean his dad had been doing it for years but there's so many started up. 
*MAG:	Yes. 
*ANN:	He couldn't compete! And, and then finally the council said, he actually had an Austin Princess, but you know Paul and his cars that that nineteen, I don't know what it is the car he's got in his garage now, but he buys old cars and completely rebuilds them, it looks like a new car now and he ha  he had an Austin Princess which, which actually it was a P reg and er they told him he couldn't run the service unless he bought a much newer car. And he couldn't do it, because, the pair of them, I mean, that was, that business was supporting his mother as well and between them, after they'd paid for the petrol, they were taking in less than a hundred pounds a week and that was for the two of them. 
*MAG:	Two. 
*ANN:	So he couldn't keep it going any longer and he had to give it up, so he's on the dole again. It's about   (.) oh, it's, it's over a year since he packed in and he's tri  applied for hundreds of jobs. He's applied for jobs in Washington and 
*MAG:	Mm mm. 
*ANN:	 you know it's quite   
*MAG:	 I, mm mm. 
*ANN:	a long way to travel to 
*MAG:	I read in er 
*ANN:	but see  you just get nothing. 
*MAG:	 in the paper just  last week Nissan had er   (.) about   (.) had some jobs 
*ANN:	He wrote  to Nissan. 
*MAG:	 going. 
*ANN:	That was  one of the places he   
*MAG:	 and they had, 
*ANN:	wrote to. 
*MAG:	they expected, they expected a lot of er   (.) applications. They got thirty thousand! 
*ANN:	Yes. 
*MAG:	Phew! You know, it was er, it was ridiculous    (  )   
*ANN:	 Thirty thousand   
*MAG:	that there, there, there had to be so many people 
*ANN:	Mm mm. 
*MAG:	who needed a job. 
*ANN:	Yes.  (.) Yes. 
*MAG:	And they expected a lot of but they didn't expect that many. 
*ANN:	They say unemployment's hitting the   (.) south now   (.) but I wonder how many jobs they get that   (.) thirty thousand apply for? 
*MAG:	Mm.  (.) Sorry state of  affairs. 
*ANN:	 Yeah.   (.) The teaching, teaching jobs are the same. Hundreds and hundreds applying for teaching jobs.  (.) Rubbish.  (.) Is that rubbish? What's this?  (.) Something from  (  )  
*MAG:	You won't get a copy of the completed er   (.) thing, will you? 
*ANN:	No.  (.) Nope! There's bits of paper everywhere you look. 
*MAG:	Well I think I'd better make a 
*ANN:	Whose key's this? (.)  
*MAG:	Got mine here. 
*ANN:	That's not your key, is it? 
*MAG:	No, (  )  (.)  
*ANN:	I'm sure it's not mine. 
*MAG:	Jim's? (.)  
*ANN:	Jim's is on his car keyring, I'll put it there until I find out. Unless it was a loose one that was lying on here   (.) cos Richard was 
*MAG:	I've got as many keys at home    (  )   
*ANN:	 Oh, I've got, 
*MAG:	and I haven't a clue    ((laugh))   (  ) I   
*ANN:	 oh, I've got, I've   
*MAG:	keep thinking I, you know, I should throw them out or something. 
*ANN:	I've got keys to these, there's an old lady opposite, I've got keys for her   (.) erm front door and back door. (.)  
*MAG:	Well I've got    (  )   
*ANN:	 She's got a, I think er   (.) has she got a   (.) no, I don't think she's got a key to my house now, she used to have er in case I lock meself out.  And Betty had, but that   
*MAG:	  (  )  
*ANN:	then we got the new front door so only Betty now has got er, a spare backdoor key   (.) which wasn't much good the day I bolted the door into the kitchen! Could only get as far as the kitchen. 
*MAG:	I've been grateful for Jessie   having my key because er I've locked myself out one or two  (.)  
*ANN:	Yes. 
*MAG:	You know, I get out the door and I think I've left the key   ((laughing)) in the lock. 
*ANN:	There's something extremely sticky on this windowsill. 
*MAG:	 (  ) 
*ANN:	Urgh! It's all claggy.  (.) I don't know what they've had on there, I'll have to wash it off properly. 
*MAG:	 (  ) oh there's my paper  (  ) . 
*ANN:	Oh. 
*MAG:	What happens as far as patients in hospital are concerned Ann when it comes to an election? 
*ANN:	Well if they've applied in time they can get a p  postal vote. 
*MAG:	Mm. 
*ANN:	Er   (.) or they can ask for someone to take them. Jim's actually running people from Comfort House   (.) there.  (.) Someone er   (.) asked   (.) it was someone who was deliving, delivering the erm election   (.) the polling cards. He'd been helping his wife to, she must work for the council and he'd been helping her and he said er   (.) the matron at Comfort House had asked and he, and he'd noticed Jim's name on when he delivered ours so he knew where they could, he'd take them. The only thing is in a place like that they're more likely to be Tory. However, Jim says he'll take them. 
*MAG:	 Where is Comfort House? 
*ANN:	It's er, a private nursing home   (.) do you know where the library is? 
*MAG:	Yes. 
*ANN:	You go past   (.) past the library   (.) past the ambulance station and round the corner. 
*MAG:	I haven't been as far down there, I've only been as far as the doctor's surgery, down that road.  (.)  What opposite, is that opposite the er, opposite   
*ANN:	 Oh, the clinic, yes, yes, yes. 
*MAG:	the library? 
*ANN:	No, it's further round than that. 
*MAG:	Oh. 
*ANN:	If you go, if you actually
