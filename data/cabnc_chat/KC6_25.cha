*GAV:	Is he a nice bloke?
*SUE:	No!He's just stupid!He's, he's already come in for one form   (.) put it, he's obviously filled one form in, he came up and he said can I have an application form for that job in the window, so I gave him one   (.) and he went, oh well I've just filled one in.I thought   (.)

I was going to so , to move   (.) or change out my draw   (.) shutting it up, turning it off, going away   (.) and somebody else had come, he kept, kept, kept doing that and he was stood there all the time and I thought   (.) I thought you definitely won't get the job!Well you're, you're not bloody suitable for it cos you keep getting   (.) under my bloody feet! (.) And then 
*GAV:	How old is he?
*SUE:	I dunno.Probably about twenty three I think.And he's filled all the front in and the back, like, referees and everything   (.) and he said   (.) inside you've got to give your details of your erm   (.) employment history   (.) and he'd not put anything in, said I didn't know whether to put anything on there cos I'm on a Y P.I said, what you mean a Y T S?He sa , and he looked and he went   (.) yeah, Y T.And I says, well   (.) you know, is it, is it a job?You've got to put it down.And he went, well no it's not a job.I said, well what is it then?He said, well I'm training.I said, well training to do what?He says I'm training on a Y T S.Jesus Christ!Is he really thick or what!I still don't know what he's doing!He were working for an erm   (.)
