Robert (PS0C1) [1] It's running.

               that you can hear, or will be hearing in the next half an hour
               or so will be that of the television.
Robert (PS0C1) [15] Yeah well that's a fact of life.
               [16] She ... she has to make out a form, with erm what was
               happening at the time and everything.
               [17] The duration ... and all that type of [...] .
               [18] But so far she's managed to record five minutes of
               conversation between me and her.
               [19] So ... and she's got twenty tapes ... C [laughing] nineties

Robert (PS0C1)  [73] Sorry?
Gillian (PS0BY) [74] Do you want a tea or a coffee?
Robert (PS0C1)  [75] Cup of tea please.

                it.

Gillian (PS0BY) [79] And said to her about erm ... putting the kids to bed.
Robert (PS0C1)  [80] Mm.
Gillian (PS0BY) [81] And said we'll try and get something sorted out before you
                babysit on the ... nineteenth.

Gillian (PS0BY) [85] Sorry?
Robert (PS0C1)  [86] Is it a marketing exercise for this?
Gillian (PS0BY) [87] I don't know.
                [88] Oh I've just been listening to your conversation with
                Dennis and Iris.
Robert (PS0C1)  [89] Yeah?

Gillian (PS0BY) [91] Mm clank, click pheew clank click [laugh] .
                [92] I couldn't understand what you ... you were saying to Iris
                though.
Robert (PS0C1)  [93] Couldn't you?
Gillian (PS0BY) [94] No.
Robert (PS0C1)  [95] Oh well [...]
Gillian (PS0BY) [96] Well you, all I heard was something about her sorting out
                some wool ... and
Robert (PS0C1)  [97] She was doing a tapestry thing.
                [98] ... I'm a little bit erm ... concerned with our Darrell.
                ...
Gillian (PS0BY) [99] Yeah oh I think he's just peed off with his ... father.
                [100] ... or
Robert (PS0C1)  [101] Yeah but it just st strikes me he's losing perspective of
                who's doing what for who.
                [102] ... I appreciate that the long term we gain as far as
                that property, yeah?
Gillian (PS0BY) [103] Yeah.
Robert (PS0C1)  [104] But the short term, he is not making us rich is he? ...
Gillian (PS0BY) [105] Not by doing it the speed he's doing it.
Robert (PS0C1)  [106] If he'd have taken his time and he'd have got himself
                some more work ... yeah?
Gillian (PS0BY) [107] Yeah.
                [108] ... Well I think he, it's just Friday night and ... he's
                coming up here tomorrow morning.
Robert (PS0C1)  [109] Is he, why?
Gillian (PS0BY) [110] Oh, I just said do we see you over the weekend
Robert (PS0C1)  [111] Mm.
Gillian (PS0BY) [112] and he says he's coming up tomorrow morning and erm ...
                but he's got places to go and people, you know how he says it,
                places to go ... people to see ... tomorrow afternoon and
                Sunday.
                [113] I asked him if he was going on his boat and he said no.
Robert (PS0C1)  [114] No, he's put it in his winter mooring hasn't he?
Gillian (PS0BY) [115] No idea.
Robert (PS0C1)  [116] Fair weather sailor Jim.
                [117] Despite all the rum bum baccy stuff. ...
Gillian (PS0BY) [118] I think it's just Friday night and he's ... yeah,
                basically.
                [119] ... I don't think Billy's telling him enough [cough] to
                be honest.
Robert (PS0C1)  [120] Why?
Gillian (PS0BY) [121] I just don't.
Robert (PS0C1)  [122] [yawning] What, he knows something's happened [] .
                [123] But he doesn't know what it is. ...
Gillian (PS0BY) [124] He doesn't seem to be involved in that many ...
                discussions about the company does he?
                [125] [yawning] Or what's happening.
                [126] I mean [] he was moaning about erm or those trade
                accounts weren't he?
Robert (PS0C1)  [127] Mm.
                [128] ... well it's not for me to say.
                [129] I don't know anything more about this business than he
                does.
Gillian (PS0BY) [130] Oh no.
Robert (PS0C1)  [131] [...] go as far as to say we probably know less about
                what's going on than he does.
Gillian (PS0BY) [132] Do we?
                [133] Oh.
                [134] Such is life.
                [135] ... I had a word with Steph on the phone.
Robert (PS0C1)  [136] Oh?
Gillian (PS0BY) [137] She's getting fat. ... [...]
Robert (PS0C1)  [...]
Gillian (PS0BY) [138] Yeah.
                [139] She goes to hospital on Thursday.
                [140] Eighteen week appointment.
                [141] She's had another scan.
                [142] ... Got to work on Sunday.
                [143] ... They're gonna work from ... nine thirty till four
                thirty this Sunday.
Robert (PS0C1)  [144] Mm.
Gillian (PS0BY) [145] And then every Sunday up to Christmas.
                [146] And if the ... trading's good enough they're gonna carry
                it on.
                [147] ... So ... how that will go with the Sun Sunday laws I
                don't know.
                [148] ... I'm waiting for Tesco's to ... foreclose on what they
                said they were gonna do.
Robert (PS0C1)  [149] And what's that then?
Gillian (PS0BY) [150] Well they're supposed to be opening on Sundays but didn't
                Texas and all those get fined last year?
Robert (PS0C1)  [151] Mhm.
Gillian (PS0BY) [152] For opening on Sundays?
Robert (PS0C1)  [153] Yeah but because there's a ... European Court ... ruling
                outstanding ... local authorities aren't gonna take them to
                court.
Gillian (PS0BY) [154] Oh. ...
Robert (PS0C1)  [155] Because the ... shop can just put an injunction on them,
                stopping them taking it any further.
                [156] Or they can sue them for loss of income.
Gillian (PS0BY) [157] Uhuh.
Robert (PS0C1)  [158] Yeah?
                [159] Are you having this bath?

Gillian (PS0BY) [186] She's not getting a look in?
Robert (PS0C1)  [187] Not so far.
Gillian (PS0BY) [188] Ha ha, I bet she winkles her way in if there's a free
                lunch going.
Robert (PS0C1)  [189] There isn't a free lunch on it, it's company internal
                software.
Gillian (PS0BY) [190] Oh.
                [191] ... Do you want mum to come to Argos with me tomorrow
                morning?
Robert (PS0C1)  [192] Why?
Gillian (PS0BY) [193] Well she isn't, I don't think she's doing anything
                tomorrow morning.
Robert (PS0C1)  [194] Are you asking me?
                [195] Why are you asking me?
Gillian (PS0BY) [196] Cos you said you'd come to Argos with me.
Robert (PS0C1)  [197] I said I'd stay here with the kids.
Gillian (PS0BY) [198] Oh is that what's the plan of action?
Robert (PS0C1)  [199] Yeah.
Gillian (PS0BY) [200] Sorry.
                [201] Right.
                [202] Okay.
                [203] ... Erm, I said I'd try and get over and see Steph one
                day next week.
Robert (PS0C1)  [204] Sorry?
Gillian (PS0BY) [205] I said I'd try and see Steph one day next week ... and
                take her some maternity clothes and erm ... I'll wash some of
                these baby things.
                [206] ... If not I've only got to put them up in the attic ...
                and bring them down in ... three month's time.
                [207] So I might as well take them over there and get rid of
                them.
                [208] She said she don't mind having the stuff in the house.

                           [...] I thought I what, I thought I got a little tin
                           of salmon there, so I thought right I'll have a
                           salmon sandwich and I had that and believe me I
                           felt, by three o'clock I could see myself picking me
                           up off the floor, I only got spots before my eyes as
                           such, but, I just had, I had four, five cups of
                           water, I didn't drink any tea, and I wish then, well
                           I don't know whether I could have felt any worse
                           when I had the sandwich or not to be honest.
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [519] Your father said er David was poor yesterday,
                           Monday, he kept coming over sick.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [520] But, I felt, I know, at one point I really
                           thought I was going to have to ring Iris to come and
                           just sit with the kiddies, but I thought well if I
                           drop down what the hell, devil this house gonna look
                           like in, with three of them ... let loose in.

                           said sometimes that salmon could make people feel a
                           bit, nothing wrong with that, it's just a tin of

                           anywhere else, I've seen it but in Argos,Wi , well
                           William looked in the catalogue on Tuesday for me,
                           but he said it was nineteen ninety nine in Argos
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [572] Yeah.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [573] but erm, had a little [...] with the
                           children's Christmas presents [...]
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [574] Who?
Gillian (PS0BY)            [575] Was it Monday, no it was yesterday, I was in
                           the loo and I could hear this paper being ripped and
                           I thought oh they've got one of my club catalogues,
                           I didn't think any more of it and then I could hear
                           Joseph going weee, [...] I thought what the devil's
                           he got, so went out, Joseph has got the flying
                           circus bus that was meant for Charlotte and him and,
                           Brenda and Charlotte was sharing the, the, garage
                           thing that I've brought ... so I thought well now
                           it's out, well they're not going to keep all that
                           till [...] I said to him whatever is Father
                           Christmas going to say, I said he's supposed to be
                           taking these away to bring I said er, what's Father
                           Christmas gonna say?, no Ben [laugh] [...] forget,
                           so I thought while they're out I could see Joseph's
                           playing a lot, way with this bus thing, he was
                           having a whale of a time, he thought that was great,
                           so I said to Charlotte I said do you like that bus?
                           [576] Cos that was meant for her you see, she said
                           no, I want the house, she meant the garage, so I
                           said don't you like the bus then Charlotte, no, bus
                           for Joseph, bus for the baby, so I thought well
                           that's decided it then now I, she, she better have
                           Mr Toot and
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [577] Don't make a lot of difference really does it?
Gillian (PS0BY)            [578] You see all
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [579] when it's
Gillian (PS0BY)            [580] all the figures all erm sit er all the same
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [581] yeah
Gillian (PS0BY)            [582] things you see, so erm, I thought right well
                           that's it Ben can have the garage, I'll go and buy
                           her the flying circus, Joseph can have the bus and
                           call it a day.
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [583] Mm.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [584] You know, I mean they've still got a couple of
                           books each and I've bought three
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [585] Swing
Gillian (PS0BY)            [586] the swing and I've bought them a couple of
                           wooden puzzles where you pick the bits up ... so, I
                           thought well then I'll call it a day there, and
                           that'll be that
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [587] Well this is this is it Gilly cos I mean
Gillian (PS0BY)            [588] Oh you can keep going though ... totally over
                           the top ... I thought well Joseph's was twelve
                           ninety nine and Ben's was fourteen nineteen ninety
                           nine and that's just tough that I've got you know, I
                           can't get Charlotte's any cheaper than that, but, I
                           mean they're not gonna know how much I've, they're
                           not gonna say well you've got five pound more than
                           what I have cos they're not of that age so, that's
                           how I've left it, that's what I'm gonna do, I'll get
                           her the circus and then they can swap them over and
                           Joseph will be happy that he got something on wheels
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [589] Yeah
Gillian (PS0BY)            [590] I said to Robert
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [591] He has got something on wheels from us
Gillian (PS0BY)            [592] yeah, I said to Rob you can't keep buying them
                           learning toys, they've gotta
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [593] Yeah
Gillian (PS0BY)            [594] play as well haven't they?
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [595] well that helps them as much really don't it?
Gillian (PS0BY)            [596] Yeah , so erm cos then I had the argument
                           about putting them back in the box.
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [597] Tell you what I've got, I keep getting, I, I
                           shall think I'll have another one tonight, is a
                           great big egg box
Gillian (PS0BY)            [598] Mm, well you see, these, these are big boxes
                           on their own there, putting them in another one
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [599] Yes, but I should you'd get one of those boxes
                           in the end [...]
Gillian (PS0BY)            [600] Do you think so?
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [601] Well, those size of those boxes
Gillian (PS0BY)            [602] Yeah, yeah
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [603] I've, I've got three of them now
Gillian (PS0BY)            [604] well I could do with, I could actually do with
                           one cos little bits and pieces, but erm, course then
                           when I've [...] them in
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [605] I do [...] rather use the [...] one, like me
                           I'd like two, cos I've got one full of bits and
                           pieces [...] and the odds, odds and ends I keep
                           [...]
Gillian (PS0BY)            [606] Oh ... [...] I've got, the one that I've
                           emptied this morning [...] .
                           [607] I think I found [...] just the tiny [...]
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [608] Yeah ...
Gillian (PS0BY)            [609] So this [...]
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [610] I [...] come up to that cow upstairs alright,
                           [...] alright
Gillian (PS0BY)            [611] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [612] you know er, I think I've got to get me eyes
                           tested, cos this can make
Gillian (PS0BY)            [613] Well you said that months ago
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [614] this, well this can make you feel, can't it?
Gillian (PS0BY)            [615] Mm, mm, I mean, its probably got to the st
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [616] Sometimes I look
Gillian (PS0BY)            [617] its probably got to the stage where you want
                           glasses all the time now, just you know erm
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [618] Yeah
Gillian (PS0BY)            [619] I mean that doesn't help as well, I know [...]
                           Sainsbury's or Tesco's and you have to keep taking
                           them off and putting them on
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [620] Yes.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [621] that doesn't help cos your eyes are not having
                           time to adjust erm without the glasses before you
                           put them back on again .
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [622] And I can't cope walking around in my reading
                           glasses but I've got to
Gillian (PS0BY)            [623] Mm.
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [624] when I want to look at prices.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [625] Pair of bi-focals or something.
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [626] Oh my god.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [627] No, I meant the ones with the half moons in
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [628] Yeah.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [629] or where they change half way down, so you
                           haven't got to keep taking your glasses on and off
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [630] Yeah, they are got
Gillian (PS0BY)            [631] Are they?
                           [632] ... I think bi-focals with the half brim bits
                           ...
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [633] So erm ... Which I thought well where's that
                           all [...] about the cake, other day, that three
                           pound one, and then two of us went
Gillian (PS0BY)            [634] Oh god [...]
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [635] there must be a reason ... you know, they,
                           they went well so I've got sixty of them, they take
                           them with me tonight and they said would there be

                           about ten o'clock and I thought well it's no good

                           yeah [laugh] .

                           time I felt fine, and then you see getting up at
                           five o'clock yesterday morning, by the time I got
                           off, it was your father that fell asleep on that
                           last drinking session, but I mean, as I said we
                           ain't used to drinking in the day like that
Gillian (PS0BY)            [laugh]

                           here.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1437] Oh, what was it you wanted?
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1438] The police one

Gillian (PS0BY)            [1444] look here ... well I, I know which one it is
                           cos they're on a separate page in the Argos book
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1445] Oh no , no
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1446] yeah, so I know what you're talking about ...
                           well didn't you say you got the police one the other
                           day?

                           I haven't got her so much, so I thought we, she, I
                           don't think she'd be into police, I thought if I
                           bought police and that was dearer and the amount
                           that I bought for Ben and Charlotte
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1456] mm
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1457] they'd better share the police and if it
                           comes to the crunch I can get a farm yard for the
                           birthday

Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1538] Yes, for his cars
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1539] Well actually I've, I've, I'm toying with the
                           idea, I haven't quite made my mind up, erm I've seen
                           some wax waistcoats
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1540] Oh
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1541] wax jackets but they're a waistcoat and I've,
                           I've ordered one really just to see what it's, it's
                           like, because erm at the moment I can, I just try
                           and get a bit closer to the door, I think we'll go
                           round again, erm ... cos in the, in my club book at
                           the moment, I, I can get twenty percent off and
                           which brings it down to, it's twe well say thirty
                           pound so twenty per cent off it brings me down to
                           erm ... brings it down to twenty four pounds and
                           then erm with my commission off that brings it down
                           to just under twenty one pound
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1542] mm
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1543] so I'm toying, that's what I'm toying with at
                           the moment, is this erm ... wax jacket
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1544] Oh.
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1545] well it's not a jacket, it's a sort, as I say
                           it's a waistcoat.
                           [1546] Oh there's one right in front of us, look,
                           blind as a bloody bat Gill.
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1547] Dad's just got in
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1548] Oh gawld, move forward a bit, so that's what
                           I was going to get, but erm in BeWise they've got
                           erm checked shirts and they're five ninety nine this
                           brushed cotton thing, so I thought if I get him that
                           waistcoat and a pair of cords, erm and get him one
                           of these brushed cotton shirts ... [yawning] that'll
                           be that sort of colour []
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1549] How much are the cords then?
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1550] What in the club book?
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1551] No
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1552] Cords in general?
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1553] eh?

Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1557] mummy, [...]
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1558] I think they're about fifteen something like
                           that, fifteen, sixteen, really depends whether you
                           buy needlecord or erm this thickish cord
Unknown speaker (KC8PSUNK) [1559] Well what do you want?
Gillian (PS0BY)            [1560] Well I'm, I'm easy, I mean the thickish cord
                           erm, washes ni , they wear better I think the
                           thickish cord but I mean erm and they're a bit
                           warmer, but if you shop about usually you can get
                           them erm the same price as the needlecord ... I'll
                           leave that with you, right.
