@Comment:	conversation #2 (Tape 028002)
*ALI:	Yeah but I'm saying they're not paying   (.) they haven't gotta pay for that machine.
*HER:	Who hasn't gotta pay for the machine?
*ALI:	Well if they're doing, somebody by hand's doing it, they haven't got that   (        ) of paying for that machine.
*HER:	Yeah but   (.) the machine could do what a hundred people could do in a day, can't it?The machine doesn't get tired like people do.
*ALI:	Yeah but I mean
*HER:	The peo the machine only goes off bad if somebody hasn't been maintaining it. (.) And all you've gotta do is, with machine is put petrol or diesel or whatever it is to make   (        ) and check all the oil 
*ALI:	And   (        ) 
*HER:	I know   (        ) but   (.) that offsets   (.) the labour is the, labour is the thing that costs a fortune. (.) 
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	Yeah.
*ALI:	Well why don't you do it all before   (        ) and   (        ) 
*HER:	Well they do. (        ) and they've got it in but   (.) it wants it at different times doesn't it?So you can't give it fertiliser.
*ALI:	Well I still think that   (.) well say you have a big massive thing and, and say it'd take   (.) a hundred people   (.) mm er I suppose the bigger it is the more economical it is.But if you only had a small place it'd be more economical to have labour than it would to buy   (.) paying out thousands of pounds for machines and 
*HER:	No you don't buy the, they come round and do it for you don't they?
*ALI:	Well alright then   (        ) 
*HER:	You hire it for a day   (.) or whatever it is.It costs   (.) just say for instance two hundred pounds for the tractor and, and his sprayer   (.) and er the chemicals on top. (.) That's done your whole field   (.) big field.Now that two hundred pound will only pay one man for a   (.) for a week   (.) to do the same thing. (.) And he's gotta do it a few times, so then the cost becomes   (.) and, and you   (.) like let's be fair, we've had summers where it's   (.) the weeds er the weeds haven't grown, but you get a wet summer   (.) and the weather warms and the wet and the weeds go peooow up like that. (.) So that's, and then it doesn't   (.) stops  (        ) 
*ALI:	Well alright then, why can't he put bark on it  (        ) ?
*HER:	Well that, it costs.
*ALI:	 (        ) from everywhere.Do it that way.
*HER:	But it's still costs isn't it?
*ALI:	 (        ) 
*HER:	Well then if you put a lot of bark on it   (.) and with vegetables, so they want   [laughing] fertilizer  [] 
*ALI:	Well   (        ) 
*HER:	 (        )
