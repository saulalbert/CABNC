*BRE:	 (        ) , yeah.
*JEA:	Yeah.Marg  keeps me informed, she said she meets Jo in the town and they exchange a few words with them  (.) 
*BRE:	Well what's Marg doing now then?
*JEA:	She's writing a children's book, erm, well she's written one, and it's going around to the publishers and she's written or she's writing a second.
*BRE:	Nice.
*JEA:	She is a, a fanatical gardener   (.) she goes and visits friends throughout the year, Marg has got her life well settled, yes.
*BRE:	Has she still got all that weight?

*BRE:	It is falling off .
*JEA:	Just as I predicted it would, it's falling off.She's happy you see.
*BRE:	Mm.Is she still seeing that chap?
*JEA:	I think so, yes.Doesn't say much about him cos he lives in Barnslow and only comes over occasionally that he can sort things out on the  (        ) .I rather think that he still lives in and as Marg said coyly to me one year, he had given her a lovely little candle in a special little bowl with, with water
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	safety candle, but it was very pretty, it's from Marks & Spencers and she said   (.) er your candle has, has just give up the rights of   (        ) last night   ((laugh)) .
*BRE:	 ((laugh)) .Oh   (.) yes cos she was rather large wasn't she?
*JEA:	Yes  (.) 
*UNK:	Are these taken?.
*BRE:	No.
*JEA:	No  (.) 
*BRE:	Do you want one or two?
*UNK:	Two.
*BRE:	I'll move round  (.) 
*JEA:	We won't be very long   (        ) .
*BRE:	Were going it won't be long before we go anyway.
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	Yeah, quite, quite, yes.Where do you come from then?
*UNK:	Er this part of  (        ) .
*JEA:	Oh yes, yes.That's an effort.
*BRE:	Trouble is where ever where you go at the moment, I mean all the cafe's you've got to wait and no seats is there, we tried another one before we came here.
*JEA:	Yes.
*BRE:	I must admit   (        ) this town short of cafe's for reason.
*JEA:	Mm, there used to be the Cardoma   (.) almost opposite here, it was an enormous cafe downstairs and an upstairs, and when that went there was nothing to replace it  (.) 
*BRE:	Are you ready to go?
*JEA:	Yes, I'm just, just scrobbling about Brenda to see where I've put my purse.
*BRE:	Don't worry I'll get this, Ray gave me some money, I've got ten pounds so
*JEA:	You sure?
*BRE:	Yeah, I'll go and sort this out.
*JEA:	Right, and I, I must get to the Nationwide.
