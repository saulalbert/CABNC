*CHR:	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. •200652_203562•
        It is straightforward, thirty five minutes, shall I set thirty five? •204032_207182•
*NOR:	Phorr, sticky out there isn't it? •207562_213022•
*CHR:	It's not very agreeable at all, is it? •213482_215202•
*NOR:	I forgot to take those rotten grapefruits back to Sainsbury's. •215782_219762•
*CHR:	Oh did you tell them? •219762_221102•
*NOR:	No, what, what would that do. •221202_222412•
*CHR:	Well I mean that, they don't expect necessarily to see the evidence do they? •222902_228902•
*NOR:	 (        )
