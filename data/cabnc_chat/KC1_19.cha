*STE:	and these aren't so expensive, but I mean these we know are fifteen so these have gotta be twenty five, twenty six quid •763342_768642•
*FRA:	Mm. •768642_768732•
*STE:	so he said it's across the board  put four thousand quid's worth off him the other day and I only give fifty pence off he said so I can't do much for you. •769052_775602•
