*GIL:	Do you want a tea or a coffee? •996555_997855•
*ROB:	Cup of tea please. •998885_999505•
*GIL:	I've just been filling in my books and reading all about it. •999775_100275•
        I rang mum up. •100530_100791•
*ROB:	Mm? •100820_100826•
*GIL:	And said to her about erm  putting the kids to bed. •100924_101290•
*ROB:	Mm. •101472_101489•
*GIL:	And said we'll try and get something sorted out before you babysit on the  nineteenth. •101489_101966•
        I said we didn't do too bad. •102092_102250•
        I said Ben was wet but I didn't, his bed wasn't, so  god knows   •102250_102472•
*ROB:	Is it a marketing exercise for the Sony Walkman really? •108027_108207•
*GIL:	Sorry? •108244_108263•
*ROB:	Is it a marketing exercise for this? •108263_108384•
*GIL:	I don't know. •108384_108437•
        Oh I've just been listening to your conversation with Dennis and Iris. •108437_108943•
*ROB:	Yeah? •108943_108949•
        Was it any good? •108949_108992•
*GIL:	Mm clank, click pheew clank click . •108992_109079•
        I couldn't understand what you  you were saying to Iris though. •109084_109229•
*ROB:	Couldn't you? •109229_109256•
*GIL:	No. •109256_109262•
*ROB:	Oh well  •109262_109274•
*GIL:	Well you, all I heard was something about her sorting out some wool  and •109353_109657•
*ROB:	She was doing a tapestry thing. •109657_109773•
        I'm a little bit erm  concerned with our Darrell. •109773_109867•
*GIL:	Yeah oh I think he's just peed off with his  father. •109867_109971•
        or  •109971_109974•
*ROB:	Yeah but it just strikes me he's losing perspective of who's doing what for who. •109974_110246•
        I appreciate that the long term we gain as far as that property, yeah? •110258_110418•
*GIL:	Yeah. •110438_110444•
*ROB:	But the short term, he is not making us rich is he? •110543_110672•
*GIL:	Not by doing it the speed he's doing it. •110672_110871•
*ROB:	If he'd have taken his time and he'd have got himself some more work  yeah? •110871_111273•
*GIL:	Yeah. •111273_111286•
        Well I think he, it's just Friday night and  he's coming up here tomorrow morning. •111929_112508•
*ROB:	Is he, why? •112557_112594•
*GIL:	Oh, I just said do we see you over the weekend •112594_112921•
*ROB:	Mm. •112961_112967•
*GIL:	and he says he's coming up tomorrow morning and erm  but he's got places to go and people, you know how he says it, places to go  people to see  tomorrow afternoon and Sunday. •113007_114026•
        I asked him if he was going on his boat and he said no. •114114_114303•
*ROB:	No, he's put it in his winter mooring hasn't he? •114303_114756•
*GIL:	No idea. •114756_114798•
*ROB:	Fair weather sailor Jim. •114886_114992•
        Despite all the rum bum baccy stuff. •115182_115360•
*GIL:	I think it's just Friday night and he's  yeah, basically. •115578_116476•
        I don't think Billy's telling him enough  to be honest. •116977_117707•
*ROB:	Why? •117797_117807•
*GIL:	I just don't. •117807_117932•
*ROB:	What, he knows something's happened . •118081_118221•
        But he doesn't know what it is. •118256_118373•
*GIL:	He doesn't seem to be involved in that many  discussions about the company does he? •118865_119310•
        Or what's happening. •119456_119537•
        I mean  he was moaning about erm or those trade accounts weren't he? •119537_120438•
*ROB:	Mm. •120445_120451•
        well it's not for me to say. •120482_120721•
        I don't know anything more about this business than he does. •120721_121016•
*GIL:	Oh no. •121016_121031•
*ROB:	go as far as to say we probably know less about what's going on than he does. •121119_121425•
*GIL:	Do we? •121562_121691•
        Oh. •121749_121753•
        Such is life. •121845_121875•
        I had a word with Steph on the phone. •122682_122992•
*ROB:	Oh? •122992_122997•
*GIL:	She's getting fat. •123166_123295•
*ROB:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Yeah. •123379_123390•
        She goes to hospital on Thursday. •123390_123605•
        Eighteen week appointment. •123605_123690•
        She's had another scan. •123776_123848•
        Got to work on Sunday. •124097_124202•
        They're gonna work from  nine thirty till four thirty this Sunday. •124554_125146•
*ROB:	Mm. •125233_125247•
*GIL:	And then every Sunday up to Christmas. •125247_125364•
        And if the  trading's good enough they're gonna carry it on. •125474_125793•
        So  how that will go with the Sunday laws I don't know. •125900_126529•
        I'm waiting for Tesco's to  foreclose on what they said they were gonna do. •127132_127659•
*ROB:	And what's that then? •127659_127727•
*GIL:	Well they're supposed to be opening on Sundays but didn't Texas and all those get fined last year? •127743_128305•
*ROB:	Mhm. •128332_128348•
*GIL:	For opening on Sundays? •128460_128537•
*ROB:	Yeah but because there's a  European Court  ruling outstanding  local authorities aren't gonna take them to court. •128575_129264•
*GIL:	Oh. •129264_129267•
*ROB:	Because the  shop can just put an injunction on them, stopping them taking it any further. •129795_130383•
        Or they can sue them for loss of income. •130383_130579•
*GIL:	Uhuh. •130661_130671•
*ROB:	Yeah? •130743_130757•

*GIL:	Yeah. •131016_131034•
        Are you happy about this car situation? •131034_131216•
*ROB:	Yeah. •131216_131222•
*GIL:	You sure? •131246_131376•
*ROB:	Yeah. •131403_131413•
        It's work I'm  concerned with. •131413_131590•
*GIL:	Why? •131672_131699•
*ROB:	enough done. •131779_131838•
*GIL:	You've got Monday haven't you? •132062_132156•
*ROB:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	You've got Monday haven't you? •132156_132431•

*ROB:	Sorry? •136533_136562•
*GIL:	She's not getting a look in? •136592_136719•
*ROB:	Not so far. •136795_136851•
*GIL:	Ha ha, I bet she winkles her way in if there's a free lunch going. •136881_137180•
*ROB:	There isn't a free lunch on it, it's company internal software. •137260_137631•
*GIL:	Oh. •137631_137637•
        Do you want mum to come to Argos with me tomorrow morning? •138801_139067•
*ROB:	Why? •139240_139246•
*GIL:	Well she isn't, I don't think she's doing anything tomorrow morning. •139451_139695•
*ROB:	Are you asking me? •139802_139862•
        Why are you asking me? •139862_139971•
*GIL:	Cos you said you'd come to Argos with me. •139971_140144•
*ROB:	I said I'd stay here with the kids. •140144_140475•
*GIL:	Oh is that what's the plan of action? •140475_143151•
*ROB:	Yeah. •143204_143210•
*GIL:	Sorry. •143210_143228•
        Right. •143272_143292•
        Okay. •143292_143307•
        Erm, I said I'd try and get over and see Steph one day next week. •143657_144043•
*ROB:	Sorry? •144123_144140•
*GIL:	I said I'd try and see Steph one day next week  and take her some maternity clothes and erm  I'll wash some of these baby things. •144171_145097•
        If not I've only got to put them up in the attic  and bring them down in  three month's time. •145525_146079•
        So I might as well take them over there and get rid of them. •146109_146499•
        She said she don't mind having the stuff in the house. •146502_146692•
