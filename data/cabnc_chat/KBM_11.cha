*CHR:	He's never here anyway, it don't matter 
*LYN:	No we've got a separate, spare room 
*CHR:	When's dad coming back? 
*LYN:	I don't know yet, I should think it'll be by the end of the month 
*CHR:	Why he ask you? 
*LYN:	He hasn't, got to wait for the things to come the, the bed and the car  and er they haven't ordered a carpet yet 
*CHR:	She, got to wait till they order a carpet? 
*LYN:	Well there's no use moving in till they've got a lounge carpet cos if they go in they'd just have to move everything to get it in 
*CHR:	Sodding hell    (  )   
*LYN:	 they haven't got a bed  anyway, we don't know when that's coming 
*CHR:	Why? 
*LYN:	They can't sleep on the floor can they? 
*CHR:	They can if I can, hmm, er when's the bed going to get there? 
*LYN:	We don't know 
*CHR:	Well when, did they order it? 
*LYN:	Mm 
*CHR:	From where? 
*LYN:	Oh one of those catalogues 
*CHR:	That's a rip off isn't it? 
*LYN:	No they're not, they got a   (.) was it thirty percent discount, first   
*CHR:	 Five   
*LYN:	time buyer or something 
*CHR:	Oh thirty 
*LYN:	I think it was thirty 
*CHR:	How much was the bed? 
*LYN:	Oh I think they said they were paying a hundred and ninety nine 
*CHR:	Where they get all their money from? 
*LYN:	They're not getting it, it's all on credit 
*CHR:	Oh that's bad news innit? 
*LYN:	Not if they can afford to pay it and they don't get too much, it's interest free credit on fridge freezer 
*CHR:	Well I know, it's still bad news cos they've got their mortgage and everything 
*LYN:	Well they're both working, they've got a good, good income every month now 
*CHR:	How much? 
*LYN:	I dunno, I think they should clear eleven hundred a month between them 
*CHR:	No in years  (  )  
*LYN:	I don't know how much  they're getting   
*CHR:	 clear eleven  what d'ya mean clear? 
*LYN:	Well after you've had your tax and insurance taken off, that's how much they should have between them 
*CHR:	What between them, that   
*LYN:	 at the  end of the month 
*CHR:	that's only twelve thousand, thirteen thousand a year, that's crap, that's what Gerrard gets just on  his own   
*LYN:	 Oh it  must be more then I don't know  then   
*CHR:	 it's double  that innit? Lesley gets more than Gerrard doesn't she? 
*LYN:	She does now, she's got this new job 
*CHR:	Oh, it's about twice that 
*LYN:	 (  ) what's Gerrard on ten thousand? 
*CHR:	More than that, twelve innit? 
*LYN:	Oh I don't think it's 
*CHR:	Twelve, thirteen, yeah cos he used to be on ten at the old place and he gets about two thousand  more   
*LYN:	 Oh  was then ten? Oh yeah, well after you've taken tax and insurance back you see, you've lost about three hundred, three fifty 
*CHR:	Yeah, under the Conservatives that, if you'd been under Labour you would of lost about four hundred   (.) didn't think of that though did you, didn't think your own son 
*LYN:	But they, the Conservatives are cutting down on the health service and everything else and the schools 
*CHR:	So? 
*LYN:	What are we going to do when there's no, no health service? They're going to get rid of it you know eventually 
*CHR:	No 
*LYN:	They are 
*CHR:	No  they're, they'll still be   
*LYN:	 that's the way it's going   
*CHR:	they'll still be a health service, but peo    
*LYN:	 No   
*CHR:	but people who can afford to pay for it will be, will be made to  at the time   
*LYN:	 Well that just   
*CHR:	which I think is right, if you can afford to pay for it then you should be made, made to 
*LYN:	But where do they draw the line at those who can afford to pay for it? 
*CHR:	I don't know, that's  up to them   
*LYN:	 No so  I draw the pay, a set amount each month and have peace of mind thank you very much 
*CHR:	Aargh 
*LYN:	even if I've never had to use it much 
*CHR:	Never even paid national insurance in your life have you mum? 
*LYN:	Your dad pays his share for me, comes out of his wages   (.) if I paid, it's just extra on top of all that, if I was paying any 
*CHR:	Well that, oh, it's no point in arguing 
*LYN:	Why? You ask me so I told ya   (.) no point in arguing, you won't make a very good politician, shut up, sod off 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) Don't use that language 
*LYN:	I can't win this argument so shut up 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) I shall bloody win 
*LYN:	Pardon? 
*CHR:	I shall bloody win 
*LYN:	That's enough 
*CHR:	Why shouldn't, why shouldn't we be made to pay for a health service? 
*LYN:	Because it's, it's a service for  everyone, as long as everybody gets the same   (  )   
*CHR:	 The only good thing, the only good thing about La  the only good  thing about Labour is that they would have brought back student grants so if I ever, if I ever do go to university then I'll get lots of money. 
*LYN:	And if Labour'd got in they'd of er, your dad said he'd er probably got a rise 
*CHR:	Would he? (.)  
*LYN:	Mm, I think  he   
*CHR:	 Rubbish  how much? 
*LYN:	Don't know, Labour'd be more   (.) give more to the public sector don't they than the Conservatives? 
*CHR:	Why he got a rise by the 
*LYN:	He might of done he said, he probably would of done in the la  the unions would of put in a big one for   (.) Mr Major wouldn't give one, still wouldn't have affected 
*UNK:	 (  ) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) do you care? Aha, do you want him to have more money? (.)  
*LYN:	Half his share 
*CHR:	So  (.)  
*LYN:	it, it  what did he say? 
*CHR:	 More for him to lose   
*LYN:	did he say B T had gone up twenty P this morning? 
*CHR:	this morning 
*LYN:	I think he said twenty P 
*CHR:	When'd he tell you that? 
*LYN:	overnight, he came home at lunchtime 
*CHR:	They went up ten overnight  to about, to about   
*LYN:	 Oh they've gone er   
*CHR:	to about what I paid for them 
*LYN:	Well I think he said they've gone up twenty when he came home   (.) I'm not sure 
*CHR:	Yeah it has, see  (  )  
*LYN:	How many have you got, three hundred? 
*CHR:	Three hundred and eighty 
*LYN:	Did he say I pay twenty pounds? So that's twenty P int it in a hundred? 
*CHR:	What? 
*LYN:	He said I've made twenty pounds overnight   (.) so that's, yeah they've gone up twenty P each cos I've got a hundred 
*CHR:	Make sense I suppose
