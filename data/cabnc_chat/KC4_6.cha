*NON:	Are you, I mean 
*NON:	 (  ) the erm 
*NON:	We, we haven't got accents as such have we? 
*NON:	No. 
*NON:	Oh, well we have but it's a  London   (  )   
*FRE:	 I don't think you  well   (  ) a month now, I mean cotton is a natural  (  ) . 
*NON:	Yeah that's right but I mean we're just  a south east London   
*FRE:	 I don't think   (  )   
*NON:	sort of accent. 
*FRE:	Well I, I would call it south London. 
*NON:	I would. 
*NON:	Well alright then. 
*FRE:	Anyway, call it south London. It's certainly not a north London accent. 
*NON:	The north London accent is exactly the same I used to live there for years. 
*FRE:	Did you? Oh. 
*NON:	Yeah. 
*FRE:	 (  ) 
*NON:	Oh, yeah. 
*FRE:	Well I lived in north east London. 
*NON:	Well it depends where you're, where you're going  (  ) . 
*NON:	 (  ) in Scotland  (  )  
*NON:	Oh   (  ) to Scotland. 
*NON:	Now there are treacle bites. 
*NON:	I'll   (  ) home. (  )  (.)  
*NON:	What's that treacle thing that we got from you the other day? That had to be kept in the fridge  (  ) . 
*NON:	I don't think so. It was a toffee tart? 
*NON:	Whatever it was. 
*NON:	Why? 
*NON:	I just wondered whether it was 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	Yes. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	What John? 
*NON:	It was in the fridge and the dog. 
*NON:	The fridge and the dog? 
*NON:	Was it that popular? 
*NON:	It was, it was very nice except that Fred had a piece and left the last couple of slices in the tin on the side and the dog took a shine to it so it was in a tin and then in the dog. 
*NON:	 (  ) you can't blame the dog for that. 
*NON:	Well as far as I'm concerned it was the dog    (.)  (  ) on the side. 
*NON:	Treacle pie was beautiful. 
*NON:	Was it? 
*NON:	Mm. Very good.  (15.0) I don't know why I don't eat it more often. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	 (  ) custard. (  )  
*NON:	Nothing. 
*NON:	 (  ) custard? 
*NON:	No. 
*NON:	 (  ) caramel   (.) it was sort of sludge. Dirty brown sludge. 
*NON:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	He used to do that to me at Sunday lunchtime. He used to sit and say all sorts of terrible things.  (  ) eat their dinner. I mean, he'd put his elbows on the table because we had the kitchen table  (  ) . 
*NON:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	 (  ) look at your father. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	Sue. I will have a little piece of that lemon pie. I'll have a very small piece. That's it. 
*NON:	 (  ) . Cos we, at lunchtime we have trays and we have six to a table, we have three up the side and one on the end. And sometimes it's pretty hard to get the one on the end in because they've, you've got jugs and things, and so you're pushing them all up. We couldn't get him and he had about this much off. And he came and he had a massive full plate of rice and curry and then he had custard and gooseberry pie sort of thing. And he came in and sat down and put his elbows on the edge of his tray and it all went   ((laugh)) whack over his blazer and it all slid down onto his trousers. And I was sitting up, up, say this is the head of the table I was sitting where mum is. And I saw it and everybody in the whole room saw it and burst out laughing cos it was so funny. 
*FRE:	Who was he? That did it. 
*NON:	Well   just sat down. 
*NON:	What a nice guy. 
*NON:	 (  ) make a speech. 
*NON:	Mm. William's on drums. 
*NON:	On drums? 
*NON:	Mm. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	Yes. 
*NON:	What he's going to be a drummer? 
*NON:	You don't have to go to Caterham school to become a drummer. 
*NON:	Do you see that   (  ) father with long hair and 
*NON:	Yeah. 
*NON:	Guitar. 
*NON:	What is he then? 
*NON:	I should think he's in the group, isn't he? 
*NON:	Who? Oh no, no, Philip's father, no. 
*NON:	Well perhaps he  (  )  
*NON:	He looks like one of the you know 
*NON:	Who was the man that gave the speech? 
*NON:	Philip  . The one with blond hair. 
*NON:	Yes. 
*NON:	Philip  . 
*NON:	Right. Well now his father 
*NON:	His old man is, has got long blond hair but he's bald on top 
*NON:	That's it, yeah. 
*NON:	and he wears erm sort of grey cowboy boots. 
*NON:	 (  ) . Baggy clothes. And he's got a silver guitar on his lapel 
*NON:	Yeah. But he's not a musician. He's a 
*NON:	I always thought he was a jazz  (  )  
*NON:	No he does, he does erm, er oh forgotten what you call it now. He designs   (.) buildings and windows and things.  (  ) An architect. 
*NON:	Well, he's a sort of architect. 
*NON:	A quantity surveyor? 
*NON:	Yeah. He doesn't design buildings 
*NON:	But he designs windows. 
*NON:	He designs certain bits on buildings like arches, and windows and things like that. 
*NON:	He's got a very nice vehicle. It's like erm a Range Rover isn't it? 
*NON:	Yeah. 
*NON:	Big. Great big thing. 
*NON:	Shogun sort of thing. 
*NON:	So we sat there and we decided he was obviously a musician. ((laugh))  
*NON:	He likes music but he's not a musician. 
*NON:	He looks like and I, first of all when we saw him I thought who the hell is that, can't be a father cos look at him, he looks terrible. 
*FRE:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	  (  )  
*NON:	  (  )  he looks  terrible   
*NON:	 Did he come to the ball?  Did he come to the ball Sue? 
*NON:	 (  ) should have seen   (  ) dad. Did you see the one who kept running up and down in the weird hat? Taking photos. 
*FRE:	Well that's his, that's his tribal  (  ) . 
*NON:	Yes, didn't you see him? 
*NON:	Oh what   (  ) yes. (  )  
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	Yes. 
*FRE:	He, he is a head of them, he head of the tribe. 
*NON:	One of the main tribes of  (  )  
*FRE:	They don't call them   (  ) they call them tribes or whatever it is  (  ) . 
*NON:	 (  ) is French? 
*NON:	Is it? 
*FRE:	And he er, well he's probably   (  ) French. 
*NON:	You see his dad is basically a king. 
*FRE:	A ki  king, that's right. 
*NON:	A king, a kingdom, so Richard's really a prince. 
*NON:	Oh. 
*NON:	Doesn't mean that   (  ) father of his is a queen does it? Runs up and down screaming and jumping up and down. 
*NON:	Well when did you see her? 
*NON:	Oh she goes to   (  ) matches. (  )  
*NON:	It's an embarrassment. You sort of creep into a corner and hope she doesn't see you. 
*NON:	 (  ) really nice. 
*NON:	She's alright to say hello to but then 
*NON:	One of the nicest mums there is. 
*NON:	Yes she is. 
*NON:	Well she's alright. 
*FRE:	I think she is too Alex. 
*NON:	You don't actually want to stand next to her though do you? 
*NON:	She is. When I was playing rugby and I hurt my thumb she actually lent me a very expensive Jaeger coat to keep me warm.  ((laugh)) She did and I got mud all over it   (  ) . 
*NON:	  (  )  you can't stand any too much she's always on the move. 
*NON:	She's nice. She comes to all the, all the   (  ) football. 
*NON:	Yes, she is, she's very nice but you don't actually want to, if you're on the, the touchline you don't want to stand next to her. 
*NON:	Why? 
*NON:	Well she's jumping up and down, she's screaming and laughing and shouting at people and hollering oh. 
*FRE:	That, that's what she goes there for. 
*NON:	I think the worst thing is when their team   (  ) at matches. They were losing and she knew they were going to lose and their last bloke was coming in and she was cheering them on.  ((laugh)) She was cheering them on. 
*FRE:	Ah we, we, her and I cheered   on who, who, who couldn't score, he never, they never got a score. (  )  
*NON:	Oh was that Trinity? 
*FRE:	No, it wasn't Trinity, no. It was   (  ) yeah they'd come quite a long way actually. 
*NON:	Oh yeah, hang on, I can't think who they are but they came all the way  (  ) . And we're all going out on the field going come on, very good, we're gonna beat your team, and we got our man and we scored about seven tries in the first three minutes. 
*FRE:	Oh not, hardly, not quite. 
*NON:	It's a very rough game Alexander. 
*NON:	Oh Alex's got some    (  )   
*FRE:	  (  )  twenty seconds. 
*NON:	telling you the rules. Tell daddy what they're changing. 
*NON:	Oh they're going to change the rules that erm, you know there's two scrumhalfs start on their side of the scrum, well they can't come round to the other side. Cos you know you've got 
*NON:	Yeah. 
*NON:	in the centre of the scrum you've half   (  ) and you've got 
*NON:	So as long as you're behind the ball you can keep moving 
*NON:	No. 
*NON:	Well you, that's what you can do at the moment. 
*NON:	Yeah but the new rules for our age group is you have half of the scrum and then you have the scrumhalf and he puts the ball in and he goes back to his side doesn't he? And the other scrumhalf   (  ) and normally the other scrumhalf will come round and tackle him. Or push him off the ball  or something   
*NON:	 Yes.  As long as he stays, stays behind the ball then he's allowed to do that. 
*NON:	 Well they're not allowed to, they're not allowed to  yeah but they're not allowed to do that any more. 
*NON:	He can't, so he can't come 
*NON:	No. And he can't, you can't do twist   (  ) any more. 
*FRE:	Can't you? 
*NON:	No. The number eight can't pick it up. 
*FRE:	Oh. 
*NON:	And erm I can't remember what the other one is. 
*FRE:	  (  )  
*NON:	  (  )  Oh you can't push more than one point four metres or something or other. 
*NON:	Oh my god! Do you take a tape measure with you? 
*NON:	No but, so if you    (  )   
*FRE:	  (  )  
*NON:	  (  )  
*NON:	  (  )  five minute scrum you can't  push over   
*NON:	 You can't push   (  ) . 
*NON:	That's  silly isn't it? 
*NON:	  (  )  yeah. The reason is you've got to take    (  )   
*NON:	  (  )  take out  all the extra sort of strain   
*NON:	 All of the extra strain on the   (  )   
*NON:	I suppose the trouble is yeah if you do push, if you do go for that the other side    (  ) cos you just sort of push them into the   (  )   
*FRE:	 What about when you   
*NON:	 Yeah! 
*NON:	in a big mangled heap. 
*FRE:	 what about when you, what about when you make   (  )   
*NON:	  (  ) the first row.  Oh as soon as, as soon as you, about over fifteens er is normal rules. This is all under fifteen. The good thing about being in the scrum is when you push over and they all collapse and you fall on top of them. Or you stand there and you walk over them. 
*NON:	Do they get as much pleasure about walking over you? 
*NON:	No cos I normally hit back. ((laugh))  
*NON:	What was this  (  ) ? 
*NON:	Tighthead prop. 
*NON:	Who? 
*NON:	Tighthead prop. 
*NON:	I think that's   (  ) tighthead prop. 
*NON:	Prop forward. 
*NON:	That's what it's called. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	 ((laugh)) 
*NON:	I don't know much about rugby. 
*NON:	 Better than golf. 
*NON:	  (  )  four   (.) five days really. 
*NON:	It's better than golf. 
*NON:	Don't you like golf? 
*NON:	No, boring. 
*NON:	Golf? 
*NON:	Yeah.   (  ) golf   
*NON:	 Why do you say  boring? 
*NON:	I dunno. ((laugh))  
*NON:	Golf is  (  )  
*NON:	Have you actually played it? 
*NON:	Yes. Lots. ((laugh))  
*FRE:	What golf? 
*NON:	Not   (.) I'm not very good at it.  ((laugh)) Boring. 
*NON:	 ((laugh)) Oh I see, as you're no good at it, it's boring. 
*NON:	No, cos it's, you just watch somebody smack a ball as hard as they can with the one wood and see how far it goes. 
*NON:	But you've got an objective, you've got to get it down a hole  (  ) . 
*NON:	 Yeah, put it in a hole. 
*NON:	Well yes I know but    (  )   
*NON:	 That's easy! 
*NON:	 (  ) look at the money they make, golfers. 
*NON:	Yeah look at the money skateboarders make.  ((laugh)) Do you know how much, do you know how much the world champion earns in one year? 
*NON:	No. 
*NON:	He will earn something like seven million dollars. 
*NON:	What, for skateboarding? 
*NON:	Yes he does. You ought to see his house. 
*FRE:	This is America is it? 
*NON:	He's got wooden hall, wooden lounge 
*NON:	Doesn't allow any pedestrians. 
*NON:	No pedestrians, no cars. Erm  he's got three videos   
*NON:	 He skateboards all the way from the house   (  )   
*NON:	he's got portable video TV little thing like er like the Sony ones on Virgin. He's got three TV's, computer   (.) video cameras, everything. 
*NON:	He's got his own skateboard ramp in his back garden and he video tapes what he does so that he can watch what he's doing wrong and all the rest of it. 
*NON:	And he's got   (  ) these twenty nine  twenty eight   
*NON:	 How ridiculous.  On a skateboard. 
*NON:	Why's it ridiculous? 
*NON:	What's so wonderful about skateboarding? 
*NON:	Well because he's very skilled. No I accept now that it's, it's extremely skilful. 
*NON:	 It's very skilful. 
*NON:	It's just as skilful as most other sports. Just as skilful as skiing, and, and er ice skating  though it's not   (  ) phenomenal about   (  ) sports   
*NON:	 It's just, you're just thinking that if there's anybody who skateboards  just skates and like really ragged clothes because you're not exactly gonna go out wearing a suit skateboarding cos as soon as you fall off you you're gonna rip it to shreds aren't you? 
*NON:	True. I cannot see   (.) skateboarding being  sports. 
*NON:	 It's in the  next Olympics. 
*FRE:	Oh yeah.   (  ) they do it on these er   (.) they must be   (  ) you know   
*NON:	 It's gonna be in the next Olympics. For speed, skating, slalom and round.  And street style. Are all gonna be in the next Olympics. 
*FRE:	As much a  sport as you could call erm   
*NON:	 Well I dare  say but it's far more dignified to play golf  (  ) . 
*FRE:	Oh what do you, you know erm   (  ) that sort of thing. 
*NON:	Why's it far more dignified? They're just stuck up normally. 
*NON:	No they're not. 
*NON:	Load of stuck up 
*NON:	To play golf erm   (.) it's really quite    (  )   
*NON:	 Have I got to play golf? 
*FRE:	Well golf is, is hardly a sport, it's not in the, it's not like it's in the Olympics is it? 
*NON:	No. 
*FRE:	No, it's a sport, but I mean it's erm   (.) Well to most people it's a pastime isn't it? 
*NON:	Yeah. 
*FRE:	Pastime for ordinary golfers. 
*NON:	What there's Nick Faldo, makes a lot of money at it anyway. 
*FRE:	Oh well, it's a sport for him, yes. But I say for most   (.) ordinary people who play  it, it's a pastime. 
*NON:	 It's not easy  hitting that little ball you know. 
*NON:	Yes it is. 
*NON:	It is not. 
*NON:	It is. 
*NON:	It is not. 
*NON:	It is. 
*NON:	It is not. 
*NON:	It is, it is. I can even slice it and I've only played golf once. 
*FRE:	Oh I don't know.  If you've got, if you've got   
*NON:	  (  )  
*FRE:	a good eye there's nothing hard in hitting the ball. It's if it goes where you want it to that's hard. 
*NON:	Precisely. Precisely. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*FRE:	Well that applies to any, any sport, any kind of sport. 
*NON:	Apart from cricket where you just smack it as hard as you can. 
*NON:	I, I, I think there's an art to that as well. 
*NON:	Yeah there is. I can play it, sort of. 
*FRE:	I dunno, cricket, cricket 
*NON:	I can bowl, I'm quite a bowler. 
*FRE:	cricket is  (  )  
*NON:	I'm extremely fast armed. Not very accurate.  ((laugh)) Well I, I can't, I don't bowl them out I have to bowl them about that far away from the wickets  (  ) . So I get, if I get them on target I normally get a couple of wickets. 
*NON:	Mm. 
*NON:	Cos I'm really fast. Or I get an L B. 
*NON:	Well he is at javelin, and what was the other thing he was throwing, the discus? 
*FRE:	Discus. 
*NON:	No. It's shot. 
*FRE:	No, no, no the shot. 
*NON:	 I don't like shot. 
*NON:	 Oh the shot  . Are you still doing that? 
*NON:	 No. 
*FRE:	 Putting the shot. 
*NON:	You were good. 
*NON:	No. 
*NON:	Didn't you come second in that? 
*NON:	Yeah but I was just got out of it, not very good at it. 
*NON:	Now I can't see any sense in throwing   (.) whatsit, the javelin. Now honestly 
*NON:	We were just saying you ought to be good at that. 
*NON:	Well I am. 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	 (  ) spear broke, you throw it at the ground. 
*FRE:	You don't you throw it at animals to kill them. 
*NON:	Yeah but basically downwards all the time. Why can't you see the point in throwing a javelin? 
*NON:	No I can't see much sport in that. 
*NON:	I can't see you do it this year. 
*NON:	Why not? 
*FRE:	Well I think it's a lot, there's a lot of  (.)  
*NON:	What is it that, you know, it doesn't achieve anything does it? 
*FRE:	Well of course it does. It, it achieves just as much as softly doing hop skip and a jump. What's the difference? 
*NON:	It, it achieves the same as somebody, somebody putting a ball in a hole with, with as least hits as he can. 
*FRE:	It achieves, it achieves as much as some, as somebody throwing a hammer. Or a shot. 
*NON:	Oh yeah. 
*FRE:	Or jumping, jumping over an eight foot fence. 
*NON:	Yes. 
*NON:	Well they're not, erm    (.)  (  ) are they? 
*FRE:	Can't tell the difference. 
*NON:	I know, they're all the same. You wrap all those, all that lot up in one sort of, you know  (  ) . 
*FRE:	Well I think it's very interesting. It it it it takes a lot of doing. 
*NON:	Yeah it does. It's got a lot of skill in it actually. 
*FRE:	There's a lot of skill in it. There's a lot of skill in javelin throwing. 
*NON:	It is. There's more skill in that than there is the discus. 
*FRE:	There is. 
*NON:	 Discus   
*FRE:	 Might just as well  
*NON:	  (  )  make a good   (  ) as well. ((laugh))  
*NON:	Yes. 
*FRE:	There's a lot of skill in discus sonny, don't you forget it. 
*NON:	Oh yeah there is actually. Oh shot put's probably the easiest to do. 
*FRE:	Shot put is more, is more 
*NON:	Brute force. 
*FRE:	Brute force. 
*NON:	Whereas javelin is a lot of skill  (  )  
*FRE:	 I mean the hammer, the hammer is   (  )   
*NON:	 Surely javelin is brute force as well? 
*NON:	Yeah but it's got to spill and spin right. 
*NON:	It isn't brute, isn't javelin the same, it's brute force. 
*NON:	No. Because however, however much brute force you put in, it's how you put through the javelin. 
*FRE:	It's how you put it through  (  )  
*NON:	If you   (  ) it as far as far as you can you've got to, when you throw javelin you've got to bring your arm through right, you've got to twist, you've got to make sure your wrist's tight   (.) you've got to keep your erm left foot planted. 
*FRE:	 (  ) 
*NON:	You've got to, oh you've just to keep it straight. It's very hard. 
*FRE:	Very, very   (  ) . 
*NON:	 Alright then, alright then. 
*FRE:	You see you don't just, you don't just go    (  ) like this   
*NON:	  (  )  technique in in playing golf. 
*NON:	Yeah, there is a technique. 
*NON:	That's alright then. 
*NON:	Golf   (  ) technique extremely easy. 
*FRE:	Yes but surely Alexander you're, you're only saying that er   (.) you don't er, the more you   (  ) golf. 
*NON:	Yeah I know but. I know that's all I said. 
*FRE:	I mean, the, you don't get many   (.) You do get youngsters as young as you  they do, they do, by, by the time   
*NON:	 Yeah but it's no  (  ) . 
*NON:	Well they start, it it's the same way that er very young people er start playing snooker don't they? 
*NON:	Well I play snooker. 
*NON:	Time they get to about sixteen or seventeen you know they can be up in the top players.  (.) You certainly make money if you begin  (  ) . 
*NON:	Young people play bowls these days too. 
*NON:	 ((laugh)) They don't make much money at it though  (  ) . 
*NON:	No, no. Bowls is a sport that they don't make much money. 
*NON:	 (  ) money I think it's the sport that counts. 
*NON:	I know  but I mean   (  )   
*NON:	 Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose  , it's how you play the game. 
*NON:	Oh dear. ((laugh))  
*NON:	They make a few quid don't they at bowls? 
*NON:	Well  they do   (  ) cheat or not. (  )   
*NON:	 No   (  )   
*NON:	  (  ) guys at the top   (  ) what is it Tony Al   Tony Alcock. 
*NON:	Tony Alcock. But they don't win  (  ) . 
*NON:	Oh you cruel thing. 
*NON:	Cruel?  (  ) . It's a very rough sport. 
*NON:	What is? 
*NON:	 I know it is. 
*NON:	 Rugby. 
*NON:	I don't know why you play it. 
*NON:	Cos I like hitting people.  (.) I like hitting my balls ugh. 
*NON:	 (  ) streak in you. 
*NON:	Yeah well I take after my mum. 
*NON:	Do you. Do you have er young boys at your school? Do they have to do all your bidding and fetching and carrying and things? 
*NON:	No. They used to but they don't any more they've taken all that sort of brilliant stuff away. But they did that to me when I was their age and now as soon as I get to fourteen when when you can, when you can, when you could do that   (.) And now today   (.) it's not fair. 
*NON:	Mm. 
*NON:	 (  ) . (8.0)  
*NON:	 (  ) . (.)  
*NON:	No it's probably   (.) right that you don't bully the youngsters. 
*NON:	Well, they did it to me. 
*NON:	Yes, but you didn't like it did you? 
*NON:	  (  )  . N  n  . But they did it to everybody, it happened to everybody. 
*NON:	 (  ) . Except when you get there and they stop it. 
*NON:	Yeah we're not even allowed to report them any more. Put them on the landing.  (.) No because it's just oh no you'll get them all cold. 
*NON:	Where you ever put on the landing? 
*NON:	Mhm. 
*NON:	Often. ((laugh))  
*FRE:	What for? 
*NON:	Hitting people normally. 
*NON:	Hitting people? 
*NON:	Yeah with my pillows. We had pillow fights. Bed slipper fights. 
*FRE:	Well you weren't the only one out on the landing then? 
*NON:	No everybody was. 
*FRE:	There was probably more of you on the landing than there was  ((laugh))  
*NON:	There wasn't. But one night we tried to get the whole entire floor out on the landing. Well some of us swapped and the Gammas didn't want to do it. All the Alpha Betas and most of the Gammas were out on the landing and they ran out of room. And so they started putting people downstairs   (.) everywhere and shoving them in corners that nobody even  (  ) . 
*NON:	Are you sorry that your Mr   's leaving? 
*NON:	No. Well I am a little bit. 
*NON:	Oh. Was he nice to you, all you boys? 
*NON:	Well he, (  ) , well, you know but just because he's leaving he he seems to think that he's got to upturn the, upturn the, upturn the term. And everything has gone to pot. 
*NON:	I'm very surprised at that. 
*NON:	Everything thing's gone all weird and nobody knows what's happening. They've changed all the things that used to be just because they know   (.) Like form twos always used to have an end of term leaving party. But now they're not just so all the people can have one because Mr and Mrs   are leaving. 
*NON:	Oh well. 
*NON:	It was the form twos, the only thing that I, that they had to, they had to look forward to in the whole time they were there. And I've been there since Alpha and I every year I've looked out and watched the form twos. And now suddenly just as soon as I come to form twos they've taken that away. 
*NON:	What you're in form two now? 
*NON:	Yeah. They've taken all the privileges away. 
*NON:	Ah. Is it only a temporary? 
*NON:	No. We don't know. We don't have any   (  ) teachers   (  ) for about eighteen months.  ((laugh)) He does look like one. Have you seen him? 
*NON:	No. 
*FRE:	Has he got a long brown habit on? 
*NON:	No but he's got hair like one. He looks 
*NON:	 Yeah but you won't be in, you   (  ) Alexander, will it? 
*FRE:	  (  )  
*NON:	I know it's good. No. 
*NON:	After, after er you break up in the summer? 
*NON:	Yeah I know that's good. 
*NON:	So next year form two can have their party? Ask if you can join them. 
*NON:	No. Wouldn't want to mix with that bunch anyway. 
*NON:	But you are one of them now. 
*NON:	What, one of the form ones? 
*NON:	Yeah I thought you were a form two? 
*NON:	Yeah but 
*NON:	Well what are the form ones like? 
*NON:	Oh I see form ones will be form two next year. Right. 
*NON:	 (  ) load of rabble. 
*NON:	Well, they're the same as you were last year aren't they? 
*NON:	Well yeah I know. But that's how the form twos thought of us last year as well    (  )  ((laugh)) load of rabble. 
*NON:	Yes. 
*NON:	That one year can make such a difference can't it? 
*NON:	 (  ) school he'll be  (  ) . 
*NON:	Oh you're gonna be the rabble again, aren't you? 
*NON:	I know, cool. I like being the rabble cos you never have any responsibilities. If you're form two they always look to you to, I mean we can't do our thing by ourselves but soon as something needs done, doing they look to us. 
*NON:	Well there you are you're the responsible lot aren't you? 
*NON:	I know but we can't do, we can't do anything apart from be told what to do by the teachers. We can't tell people what to do. 
*NON:	Well that's right. You shouldn't have to. 
*NON:	We're not allowed to wreak punishment apart from when our floor 
*NON:	That I believe is right too, why should you? 
*NON:	Why, because we were at, in Alpha and Beta and Gamma and form one we were always admitted punishment by form twos. Whatever they felt like they sort of  
*NON:	They've never had people like barks or tells  (  ) . 
*NON:	No they're called  (  )  
*NON:	 (  ) alright isn't he? 
*NON:	Yeah I know but he admitted a lot of punishments. 
*NON:	Did he? 
*NON:	Yes. 
*NON:	I don't think your mum would like you sticking that  (  ) . 
*FRE:	I was gonna say if you keep doing that you'll be getting some  (  ) . 
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	Would you like to say  (  ) . 
*NON:	Yes. (  )  
*NON:	 (  ) 
*NON:	Present from mummy. 
*NON:	 (  ) dishwasher. (  )  
*NON:	Oh shall we go and sit in the other room while daddy finishes the washing up? 
*NON:	Oh it's not fair that he did some  (  )  
*NON:	 (  ) did all the serious bits. 
*NON:	You made the gravy. 
*NON:	Well the rest  (  ) . 
*NON:	He didn't touch any of the rest of it. 
*NON:	What's up with your dishwasher? (  )  
*NON:	It is, it is but what's there is just saucepans and things.  (.) Well, come on we'll go and sit in the other room.  (.) These cups have lasted   (.) they're three years older than you are.
