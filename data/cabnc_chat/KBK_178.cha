*CHR:	It's the best thing of course so   (.) It's a very weird thing to be doing really isn't it?
*DAV:	 (        ) You can leave it there if you want even though it's the ladies  (        ) 
*CHR:	Yeah.Thank you
*DAV:	 (        ) club house just to the left.
*CHR:	Right.There's certainly a fancy er club house there isn't it?What's what's this fancy building here David?

*CHR:	Oh yes, yes.
*DAV:	I am not sure whether it's those certainly where you can see the right players  (        ) .Eileen's husband is the leading light in the bowls.

*DAV:	That's another club.Yes.This is the   (        ) club  (        ) 
*CHR:	Right.Yes.
*DAV:	I think he he had a heart attack recently. (        ) I think he is off of it now but I think he must be quite a leading light
*CHR:	Yes yes.
*DAV:	 (        ) speak to David .
*CHR:	Oh was he?
*DAV:	 (        ) 
*CHR:	 ((laugh)) Yes.Oh!Oh!Yes yes indeed now, now I'm there and there aren't I?
*DAV:	Now if you were using this this is what we would do.It's probably   (        ) erm, yeah I think you'd probably have a shot at your yellow.Doesn't matter if you go off because you could come up behind it
*CHR:	Mmm mmm
*CHR:	and   (        ) it once
*DAV:	Yes yes.Fine.
