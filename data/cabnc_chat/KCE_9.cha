*HEL:	I, I, I mean I don't know, I wasn't there for half the things she was talking about last night, I mean I was upstairs for three quarters of an hour trying to go to sleep   •661272_668352•
*JOA:	Yeah well I mean I was there and all they did was they didn't say anything to each other, in the same room, just acted totally normally but didn't say anything to each other . •668352_674052•
        Shrimpy's trying his flipping nice to try and let this drop and just . •674472_679382•
        We all know he still fancies her  he's just trying to, you know  keep it  he's just trying to forget it and try and act as normal as possible with her and hopefully things will get back to back to  what, what they were. •679382_690302•
        But flipping Scott, mister interferior •690732_693522•
*HEL:	Interferior ? •693522_693792•
*JOA:	Yeah interferer. •693792_696262•
        Flipping  no, it really annoys me that does. •696462_700642•
        They're always going on about how much Shrimpy  gets other people involved and  can't  stick up for himself aren't they? •700642_707462•
        And bloody  Scott runs rushing off and thinks he's mister hard man. •707472_711442•
        What sort of things are you gonna say anyway? •711442_716792•
*HEL:	Well I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna say that Joanne's a bit worried about Shrimpy  which is true •717272_722792•
*JOA:	Yeah. •722792_722892•
*HEL:	you know? •722892_723732•
        And I'm just gonna say  you know, I think it would  be better if Scott didn't rush in like that, you know? •724102_730902•
        I can understand why he did it, to be quite honest. •730902_733872•
*JOA:	Yeah but you say to her  that they're always on about how Shrimpy can't do anything for himself, and it's between Emma, it's not between  it was even Scott said to me at the beginning oh it's not between me, it's nothing to do with me, it's between Emma and Scott. •733872_746902•
*HEL:	Emma and Shrimpy. •747352_748732•
*JOA:	Emma and Shrimpy then. •748732_749652•
        And erm  he's been, then he rushes ahead full storm  don't he? •749652_756952•
*HEL:	Mm. •756962_756972•
        He shouldn't have done that really, he was a bit naughty. •756972_760952•
*JOA:	He,she ought to learn to she's, they was all on about how Shrimpy can't stick up for himself, and then flaming  Emma does exactly the same but worse cos she gets Scott to do it for her. •760952_772132•
        She's gonna have to one of these, I'm not being funny but she can't stick up for herself, that girl can't. •772432_779792•
        It's about time she had the courage to do it, herself if she's in a strop. •779792_783382•
        There's no point getting Scott, cos what's gonna happen when she finishes with Scott? •783382_786982•
        She really  •786982_787552•
*HEL:	Oh •797362_797542•
