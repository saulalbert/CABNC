*GIL:	 [singing]  (        ) asleep by his side   [] Erm   (.) how's he affording to go to? (.) I would imagine that he's getting help off his parents, to be honest.I don't know.I think he's da oh his dad's paying for everything first.What's the date today, the thirteenth? (.) Yeah. (.) Erm   (.) I think he's got his dad to pay off his   (.)  (        ) 
*JEM:	I suppose if you think about it his parents probably think it's probably good to get him out of London and get him doing something.
*GIL:	Yes because at the moment he's just, I mean he's   (.) I mean he hasn't, I mean he had that job in Debenhams and that's it isn't it really?
*JEM:	Yeah. (.) So I guess I have done better than some people. ((laugh)) 
*GIL:	Mm Erm   (.) yes so he was just saying that, you know, the only night he's really been out since New Year's Eve was last Wednesday, he's just been in the whole time.
*JEM:	Well
*GIL:	He hasn't got any money or anything.I feel a bit, you know, sad.
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Yeah, and also he lives so far out and he was saying you know, Julie's up in er in Birmingham, Andy  's up in Birmingham, he's had no one to see, Eileen's come back up to Birmingham    (.)  (        ) he sees quite a lot of and er I think he's just a bit lonely.
*JEM:	Mm.
*GIL:	 ((laugh)) Erm   (.) but I think it cheered him up saying oh do you wanna come to a party at the weekend sort of thing.That's gonna be really nice I think.
*JEM:	I think I might come down actually.
*GIL:	Yeah do that.
*JEM:	I can't  (        ) 
*GIL:	Mm.
*JEM:	so I may as well.
*GIL:	It should be quite a, I mean it'll be a funny party and it'll just be   (.) it'll be good music.
*JEM:	Well it would be nice, be nice to meet different meeting different people as well 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	 (        ) and having, it's a scene, it's a crowd and
*GIL:	And also it'll be good to go to a party in London where it isn't like totally drug oriented, there won't be any drugs 
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	there at all, it'll be just drinks and
*JEM:	Really?I'm 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	cos I'm, I'm, I think I'm going through a bit of a a slight 
*GIL:	Off it?
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	I don't want anything to do with it really at the moment.
*JEM:	 (        ) like a bit not pointless, well it, it's just that I don't really, I'm not getting anything from it at the moment so
*GIL:	Yeah, same here.But I mean that's just the way it goes, you know, and it's good to have, you've got to have breaks.You can't just 
*JEM:	You'd have to be mad   (        ) 
*GIL:	Yeah.
*JEM:	really.
*GIL:	But I s I know what you mean, I'm quite happy not to at the moment as well. (.) Erm   (.) but I think it'll be a nice party and the music will be brilliant.This guy called Mark that erm   (.) tt that Frank and Janet   (.) know very well, he's a really very good D J indeed, you know he's, Janet's got a tape that he's made and he's got, using three decks at a time and stuff, he's very good.And it'll be really good sort of like funk   (.) go with, you know, sort of soully music and so it'll be really nice I think.
*JEM:	Think it'll end up a bop?
*GIL:	Yeah. (.) And also my friend   (        ) is gonna come.I invited her last   (.) oh it was the last time I spoke to her.
*JEM:	Good.
*GIL:	And that'll be good for her as well cos it'll mean that she'll meet   (        ) and Craig
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	and maybe she'll have someone to visit in London cos she hasn't really got any friends in London.
*JEM:	Whereabouts does she live in London?
*GIL:	Tt I think she lives in   (.) Clapham or something. (.)  [singing] the rain cries a little pity   (.) of one more forgotten hero  [] 
*JEM:	Was Nancy gonna come down do you think?Or is she gonna stay here?
*GIL:	I don't know, I haven't asked her if she wants to come yet really I don't think. (.) Oh no her sister and all her mates are coming up this weekend. (.)  [singing] and say for you   [] It'd be quite good, it'd be quite good to be here actually but   (.) just to meet them but   (.) tt nah    (.)  [singing] show you something  [] 
*JEM:	Yeah  (        ) 
*GIL:	Mm. (.) Simon's just brilliant isn't he really?He just   (.) he can talk to anybody.
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	Like this girl Tracey that he got on with really well, I mean I, I'd really disliked her, this girl that Claire knows.And when I arrived at this party, she is totally unsubtle   (.) and sometimes very rude, you know, and er  (.) 
*JEM:	Yeah well the thing about Simon that's excellent is that he just accepts people for what they are and he doesn't judge people 
*GIL:	Yeah.Yeah.
*JEM:	which means if you don't judge people then, you know   (.) it's just so much easier.
*GIL:	Mm. (.) Yeah. (.) 
*JEM:	I wonder how he's gonna find it not being with her.
*GIL:	He's gonna find it hard as well I think, but on the other hand they haven't been communicating at all, you know, it's not like  (.) 
*JEM:	No it's not as if it happened suddenly.
*GIL:	Mm. (.) Yeah.I think Helen's gonna find it very difficult though. (.) Just because even though they don't talk very much any more and stuff and he probably hasn't been spending much time with her,
*JEM:	That he's been   (        ) 
*GIL:	the thought that he's been there and it's   (.) yeah.
*JEM:	Well I mean they're engaged for God's sake, you know.She thought they were gonna get married.
*GIL:	Yeah. (.)  [singing] In the jingle jangle    []  (.) Yeah. (.) Is Andy gone out?
*JEM:	He's gone up to smoke I think.
*GIL:	Oh has he?Shall we sit in my room?
*JEM:	 (        ) 
*GIL:	Music. (.) And that way you don't have to just sort of 
*JEM:	Do you know whose button this is?
*GIL:	No.
*JEM:	 (        )  (.)  ((music))Yeah I think, I think Dave was, I think Dave felt a bit nostalgic coming back actually.
*GIL:	Do you?
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	What, a bit sad?
*JEM:	Well he, he did when he came in here, he picked up his   (        ) and he looked round and it was all very different and then  (        ) 
*GIL:	What in here?In this room?
*JEM:	Yeah.Yeah. (.) I think maybe he's just come to realize   (        ) that    (.)  (        )  (.) 
*GIL:	Yeah. (.)  [singing] I'll come following you    []  (.) He d yeah it was odd when Frank said that cos apparently what happened, he just sort of started saying that he didn't think that Frank had really been there for him and that he was being a bit sort of selfish and stuff   (.) which I mean maybe he has been but the thing is if   (.) you know if Frank's making this massive effort to like fit in and meet new people and stuff then
*JEM:	Yeah.
*GIL:	you know, Dave's bound to feel a bit neglected. (.) It's a bit stupid to have all this in front of a   (.) bloody radiator innit? (.) Whoops.We've gotta get a, we've gotta    [laughing]  (        ) that thing  [] .
*JEM:	 (        )  (.) 
*GIL:	 [singing] play a song for me  []
